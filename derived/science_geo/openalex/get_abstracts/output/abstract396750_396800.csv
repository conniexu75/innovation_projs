https://openalex.org/W2012104865,"Background Macromolecular complexes are the molecular machines of the cell. Knowledge at the atomic level is essential to understand and influence their function. However, their number is huge and a significant fraction is extremely difficult to study using classical structural methods such as NMR and X-ray crystallography. Therefore, the importance of large-scale computational approaches in structural biology is evident. This study combines two of these computational approaches, interface prediction and docking, to obtain atomic-level structures of protein-protein complexes, starting from their unbound components. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we combine six interface prediction web servers into a consensus method called CPORT (Consensus Prediction Of interface Residues in Transient complexes). We show that CPORT gives more stable and reliable predictions than each of the individual predictors on its own. A protocol was developed to integrate CPORT predictions into our data-driven docking program HADDOCK. For cases where experimental information is limited, this prediction-driven docking protocol presents an alternative to ab initio docking, the docking of complexes without the use of any information. Prediction-driven docking was performed on a large and diverse set of protein-protein complexes in a blind manner. Our results indicate that the performance of the HADDOCK-CPORT combination is competitive with ZDOCK-ZRANK, a state-of-the-art ab initio docking/scoring combination. Finally, the original interface predictions could be further improved by interface post-prediction (contact analysis of the docking solutions). Conclusions/Significance The current study shows that blind, prediction-driven docking using CPORT and HADDOCK is competitive with ab initio docking methods. This is encouraging since prediction-driven docking represents the absolute bottom line for data-driven docking: any additional biological knowledge will greatly improve the results obtained by prediction-driven docking alone. Finally, the fact that original interface predictions could be further improved by interface post-prediction suggests that prediction-driven docking has not yet been pushed to the limit.

https://openalex.org/W2061516621,"Accumulating evidence suggests that the brain can efficiently process both external and internal information. The processing of internal information is a distinct “offline” cognitive mode that requires not only spontaneously generated mental activity; it has also been hypothesized to require a decoupling of attention from perception in order to separate competing streams of internal and external information. This process of decoupling is potentially adaptive because it could prevent unimportant external events from disrupting an internal train of thought. Here, we use measurements of pupil diameter (PD) to provide concrete evidence for the role of decoupling during spontaneous cognitive activity. First, during periods conducive to offline thought but not during periods of task focus, PD exhibited spontaneous activity decoupled from task events. Second, periods requiring external task focus were characterized by large task evoked changes in PD; in contrast, encoding failures were preceded by episodes of high spontaneous baseline PD activity. Finally, high spontaneous PD activity also occurred prior to only the slowest 20% of correct responses, suggesting high baseline PD indexes a distinct mode of cognitive functioning. Together, these data are consistent with the decoupling hypothesis, which suggests that the capacity for spontaneous cognitive activity depends upon minimizing disruptions from the external world."
https://openalex.org/W1972524786,"Cryptochromes are flavin-based photoreceptors occurring throughout the biological kingdom, which regulate growth and development in plants and are involved in the entrainment of circadian rhythms of both plants and animals. A number of recent theoretical works suggest that cryptochromes might also be the receptors responsible for the sensing of the magnetic field of the earth (e.g. in insects, migratory birds, or migratory fish). Cryptochromes undergo forward light-induced reactions involving electron transfer to excited state flavin to generate radical intermediates, which correlate with biological activity. Here, we give evidence of a mechanism for the reverse reaction, namely dark reoxidation of protein-bound flavin in Arabidopsis thaliana cryptochrome (AtCRY1) by molecular oxygen that involves formation of a spin-correlated FADH(•)-superoxide radical pair. Formation of analogous radical pairs in animal cryptochromes might enable them to function as magnetoreceptors."
https://openalex.org/W2037912573,"Background Mitochondrial dysfunction induces insulin resistance in myocytes via a reduction of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) expression. However, the effect of mitochondrial dysfunction on insulin sensitivity is not understood well in hepatocytes. Although research has implicated the translational repression of target genes by endogenous non-coding microRNAs (miRNA) in the pathogenesis of various diseases, the identity and role of the miRNAs that are involved in the development of insulin resistance also remain largely unknown. Methodology To determine whether mitochondrial dysfunction induced by genetic or metabolic inhibition causes insulin resistance in hepatocytes, we analyzed the expression and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of insulin signaling intermediates in SK-Hep1 hepatocytes. We used qRT-PCR to measure cellular levels of selected miRNAs that are thought to target IRS-1 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTR). Using overexpression of miR-126, we determined whether IRS-1-targeting miRNA causes insulin resistance in hepatocytes. Principal Findings Mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from genetic (mitochondrial DNA depletion) or metabolic inhibition (Rotenone or Antimycin A) induced insulin resistance in hepatocytes via a reduction in the expression of IRS-1 protein. In addition, we observed a significant up-regulation of several miRNAs presumed to target IRS-1 3′UTR in hepatocytes with mitochondrial dysfunction. Using reporter gene assay we confirmed that miR-126 directly targeted to IRS-1 3′UTR. Furthermore, the overexpression of miR-126 in hepatocytes caused a substantial reduction in IRS-1 protein expression, and a consequent impairment in insulin signaling. Conclusions/Significance We demonstrated that miR-126 was actively involved in the development of insulin resistance induced by mitochondrial dysfunction. These data provide novel insights into the molecular basis of insulin resistance, and implicate miRNA in the development of metabolic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2011210959,"Collagens V and XI comprise a single regulatory type of fibril-forming collagen with multiple isoforms. Both co-assemble with collagen I or II to form heterotypic fibrils and have been implicated in regulation of fibril assembly. The objective of this study was to determine the roles of collagens V and XI in the regulation of tendon fibrillogenesis. Flexor digitorum longus tendons from a haplo-insufficient collagen V mouse model of classic Ehlers Danlos syndrome (EDS) had decreased biomechanical stiffness compared with controls consistent with joint laxity in EDS patients. However, fibril structure was relatively normal, an unexpected finding given the altered fibrils observed in dermis and cornea from this model. This suggested roles for other related molecules, i.e. collagen XI, and compound Col5a1+/−,Col11a1+/− tendons had altered fibril structures, supporting a role for collagen XI. To further evaluate this, transcript expression was analyzed in wild type tendons. During development (E18-P10) both collagen V and XI were comparably expressed; however, collagen V predominated in mature (P30) tendons. The collagens had a similar expression pattern. Tendons with altered collagen V and/or XI expression (Col5a1+/−; Col11a1+/−; Col5a1+/−,Col11a1+/−; Col11a1−/−; Col5a1+/−,Col11a1−/−) were analyzed at E18. All genotypes demonstrated a reduced fibril number and altered structure. This phenotype was more severe with a reduction in collagen XI. However, the absence of collagen XI with a reduction in collagen V was associated with the most severe fibril phenotype. The data demonstrate coordinate roles for collagens V and XI in the regulation of fibril nucleation and assembly during tendon development.

IntroductionAbnormal collagen fibril formation is characteristic of the classic form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). 2The abbreviations used are: EDSEhlers-Danlos syndromeFDLflexor digitorum longus. Patients with classic EDS (types I and II) have a broad spectrum of generalized connective tissue defects including hyper-extensible skin, fragile skin with wide, depressed, callused scarring, inguinal hernias, and rectal prolapse as well as aortic root dilation and valve prolapse (1Beighton P. Beighton P. McKusick's Heritable Disorders of Connective Tissue. Mosby, St. Louis, MO1992: 189-251Google Scholar, 2Steinmann B. Royce P. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York, NY2002: 431-523Google Scholar). In addition, laxity in the joints, leading to instability and easy dislocation as well as joint hyper-extensibility, is a characteristic feature resulting from dysfunctional tendons and ligaments. More than half of all instances of classic EDS have been linked to heterozygous mutations in the genes for collagen V (3Sokolov B.P. Prytkov A.N. Tromp G. Knowlton R.G. Prockop D.J. Hum.

The most common mutation type in classic EDS is one that results in a functional loss of one Col5a1 allele (14Schwarze U. Atkinson M. Hoffman G.G. Greenspan D.S. Byers P.H. Am. J. Hum.

The fibril-forming collagen subfamily includes collagens I, II, III, V, XI, XXIV, and XXVII, and the genes cluster into three distinct clades (16Boot-Handford R.P. Tuckwell D.S. Bioessays. 2003; 25: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Collagens I, II, and III are the major components of all collagen fibrils. Collagens V and XI are quantitatively minor collagens found as heterotypic fibrils with collagens I, II, and III and have a regulatory function in fibrillogenesis (17Birk D.E. Bruckner P. Mecham R.P. The Extracellular Matrix: An Overview. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2011: 77-155Google Scholar). Collagens XXIV and XXVII have structural differences relative to collagens I, II III, V, and XI, and their specific roles remain to be elucidated.Collagens V and XI have multiple isoforms: [α1(V)]2α2(V); [α1(V)]3; α1(V)α2(V)α3(V); α1(XI)α2(XI)α3(XI) (18Hoffman G.G. Branam A.M. Huang G. Pelegri F. Cole W.G. Wenstrup R.M. Greenspan D.S. Matrix Biol. 2010; 29: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, there are collagen V and XI hybrids such as [α1(XI)]2α2(V) (19Kleman J.P. Hartmann D.J. Ramirez F. van der Rest M. Eur. J.

Despite being originally described as separate collagen types, collagens V and XI are now considered a single collagen type with multiple tissue-specific isoforms (17Birk D.E. Bruckner P. Mecham R.P. The Extracellular Matrix: An Overview. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2011: 77-155Google Scholar, 18Hoffman G.G. Branam A.M. Huang G. Pelegri F. Cole W.G. Wenstrup R.M. Greenspan D.S. Matrix Biol. 2010; 29: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The major isoforms of collagens V and XI, [α1(V)]2α2(V) and α1(XI)α2(XI)α3(XI), form heterotypic fibrils with collagens I and II in a regulated, tissue-specific manner. Interactions among fibrillar collagens regulate collagen organization in the fibril, resulting in tissue-specific fibril differences.Collagens V and XI have been shown to regulate fibrillogenesis by nucleating fibril formation. Fibril assembly assays manipulating these collagens in cell culture and in mouse models have demonstrated that reducing the ratio of collagens V and XI to collagens I and II results in fibrils with larger diameters. Reducing collagens V and XI also results in decreased numbers of fibrils assembled (22Birk D.E. Micron. 2001; 32: 223-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 23Segev F. Héon E. Cole W.G. Wenstrup R.J. Young F. Slomovic A.R. Rootman D.S. Whitaker-Menezes D. Chervoneva I. Birk D.E. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A targeted deletion of Col5a1 is embryonic lethal in a mouse model due to cardiovascular failure and a virtual lack of fibril formation in the embryonic mesenchyme (24Wenstrup R.J. Florer J.B.

This occurs despite the presence of normal collagen I secretion and demonstrates that collagen V is essential for the assembly of collagen I-containing fibrils in this low collagen concentration environment. The heterozygous (Col5a1+/−) mice were haplo-insufficient for collagen V and recapitulated many of the characteristics of classic EDS (25Wenstrup R.J. Florer J.B. Davidson J.M. Phillips C.L.

In a mouse model (cho/cho) with naturally ablated Col11a1 alleles, collagen XI is absent. Homozygous animals develop a chondrodysplasia (cho) with cartilage essentially devoid of fibrils, although collagen II is produced normally (26Seegmiller R. Fraser F.C. Sheldon H. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 48: 580-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 27Li Y. Lacerda D.A. Warman M.L. Beier D.R. Yoshioka H. Ninomiya Y. Oxford J.T. Morris N.P. Andrikopoulos K. Ramirez F. Cell. 1995; 80: 423-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In Col2a1-null cartilage, collagen II deficiency leads to an up-regulation of collagen I. Collagen I is not produced in normal hyaline cartilage but should form fibrils. However, as in cho/cho mice, the mutant cartilage lacks fibrils. The collagen XI molecule contains an α3(XI) chain that is derived from the Col2a1 gene; therefore, Col2a1-null mice lack this, and fibrils are not assembled (28Li S.W. Prockop D.J. Helminen H.

These studies corroborate the concept that collagens V and XI have similar regulatory roles in collagen fibrillogenesis.The purpose of this study is to elucidate specific regulatory roles of collagens V and XI in tendon fibrillogenesis. Specifically, it will be determined whether regulation of tendon fibrillogenesis involves unique, shared, and/or synergistic roles for collagens V and XI in development of the structural and functional properties of tendon.RESULTSTendon function in a Col5a1+/− mouse model of classic Ehlers Danlos syndrome was analyzed. The biomechanical properties of mature (P60) Col5a1+/- and wild type control FDL tendons were analyzed (Fig. 1). The cross-sectional areas of Col5a1+/− tendons were significantly smaller than the wild type tendons. The maximum load, maximum stress, and the modulus were not significantly different. However, a significant decrease in stiffness between Col5a1+/− and wild type tendons was observed. This decrease in stiffness is consistent with the hyper-extensible joint phenotype observed in patients with classic EDS.To address structure/function relationships, collagen fibril structure was analyzed in the tendons from Col5a1+/− and wild type mice at P30 (Fig. 2, A and B). The haplo-insufficient Col5a1+/− tendons had fibril structures comparable with wild type controls, with both genotypes showing a heterogeneous population of fibrils. The wild type tendons had near circular fibril cross-sections with the Col5a1+/− tendons composed of fibrils with less regular fibril cross-section profiles. In addition, there were larger numbers of small diameter fibrils in the Col5a1+/− tendons. This result was unexpected based on the fibril phenotype observed in the dermis of the Col5a1+/− animals (24Wenstrup R.J. Florer J.B. Brunskill E.W. Bell S.M. Chervoneva I. Birk D.E. J. Biol.

Steinmann B. Gitzelmann R. Byers P.H. Lab. Invest. 1979; 40: 201-206PubMed Google Scholar). To examine potential regulatory interactions involving collagen V and XI isoforms, an analysis of fibril structure was done on tendons from mice haplo-insufficient in both Col5a1 and Col11a1 (Col5a1+/−,Col11a1+/−) (Fig. 2C). The compound heterozygous mice had larger diameter fibrils compared with the wild type controls. In addition, there was a subpopulation of large, structurally aberrant fibrils in the compound heterozygous mice. This phenotype is comparable with the dermal phenotype observed in patients with classic EDS and in the Col5a1+/− mouse model. Comparable results were obtained from P90 tendons (data not shown). The tendons from Col11a1+/− mice also were analyzed, and the fibril diameter distribution and fibril morphology were comparable with that of Col5a1+/− mice. However, the diameter distribution in Col11a1+/− tendons has a larger percentage of small diameter fibrils with first quartile (Q1) = 37.7 versus 48.2 nm, and the resultant shift in the median 103.2 versus 134.7 nm. The remaining parameters were comparable (supplemental Fig. S1).FIGURE 2Mature Col5a1+/− tendons demonstrate a fibril structure comparable with wild type controls, whereas Col5a1+/−,Col11a1+/− tendons have an EDS-like fibril phenotype. A and B, collagen fibril structure was analyzed in the tendons from Col5a1+/− and wild type mice at P30 using transmission electron microscopy. Fibril structures in Col5a1+/− tendons and wild type controls were comparable, with each showing a heterogeneous population of fibrils with normal, near circular fibril cross-sections (arrow). However, there was an increased number of small and of large diameter fibrils in the mutant mice. In addition, the fibril cross-sectional profiles were less regular in the Col5a1+/− tendons (arrow). C, fibril structure in the compound heterozygotes appears comparable with the Col5a+/− tendon, but fibril cross-sectional profiles are more irregular. In addition, there is a subpopulation of structurally aberrant fibrils (arrow). D–F, fibril diameter distributions of tendons at P30 had a broad, heterogeneous population of fibrils with a bimodal distribution in wild type, Col5a1+/−, and Col5a1+/−,Col11a1+/− mice. Both sets of mutant tendons demonstrate an increased number of small diameter fibrils relative to the wild type controls. In addition, both mutant genotypes developed a shoulder composed of larger fibrils with a heterogeneous distribution of diameters. This shoulder was substantially better developed in the compound heterozygous versus Col5a1+/− tendon.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The fibril diameter distributions were analyzed at P30 for wild type, Col5a1+/−, and compound Col5a1+/−,Col11a1+/− tendons (Fig. 2, D–F). All three genotypes contained two distinct fibril subpopulations; a narrow distribution of small diameter fibrils and a heterogeneous distribution of larger diameter fibrils. Both mutant genotypes demonstrated an increased number of small diameter fibrils relative to the wild type control tendons. This is illustrated by the decrease in the first quartile (Q1) values: 92.8 nm in the wild type tendon and 48.2 and 69.7 nm in the Col5a1+/−, and Col5a1+/−,Col11a1+/− tendons, respectively. In addition, both mutant genotypes demonstrated an increase in the range, with fourth quartile (Q4) values increasing from 292 nm in the wild type to 338 and 389 nm in the Col5a1+/− and Col5a1+/−,Col11a1+/− tendons, respectively. This was the result of the development of a right-hand shoulder composed of large diameter fibrils in the mutant tendons. The Q3 value and increased interquartile range (Q4-Q3) define these differences; Q3 remains relatively constant in tendons from all 3 genotypes at 195–200 nm. Q4-Q3 is 92 nm in wild type tendons compared with 142 and 191 nm in Col5a1+/− and Col5a1+/−,Col11a1+/− tendons, respectively. This is consistent with a subpopulation of larger, heterogeneous fibrils in the mutant tendons.The relatively normal fibril phenotype in the Col5a1+/− haplo-insufficient tendon and the defects in the Col5a1+/−,Col11a1+/− tendons suggested a cooperative regulatory interaction in tendon fibrillogenesis that is absent in the dermis of Col5a1+/− mice. To address this, collagen V and XI α-chain expression was analyzed during mouse tendon development, focusing on the ubiquitous α1(V)2α2(V) and α1(XI)α2(XI)α3(XI) isoforms. All 5 α-chains were demonstrated during tendon development and maturation (P10 to P90) using a qualitative PCR analysis (Fig. 3A). The expression was further examined from E18 to P90 using quantitative real time PCR (Fig. 3B). These transcript analyses indicated comparable expression of the collagen V and XI genes required for the two different isoforms during early tendon development (E18 to P10). However, at P30-P90, collagen XI α-chains had low expression relative to collagen V α-chains. These analyses indicate that a number of different isoforms is possible during tendon development. To determine whether the collagen proteins were present, α1(V) and α1(XI) chain expression during tendon development was analyzed using immunoblots (Fig. 3C). Both α-chains were present during early tendon development (P4); however, at P30 only the α1(V) chain was present. Immunofluorescence localization analysis at P4 demonstrated reactivity for α1(V)- and α1(XI)-associated with tendon fibroblasts (Fig. 3D).FIGURE 3Differential expression of collagens V and XI during tendon development. A, qualitative transcript analysis of collagen V and XI α-chain gene expression from P10 to P90 indicates that a number of different isoforms are possible during tendon development. B, quantitative transcript analysis of collagen V and XI α-chain genes from E18 to P90 quantitatively depicts the different isoforms possible throughout development, showing a shift from early expression of both collagen V and XI α-chains to preferential expression of collagen V beginning at 1 month. All five α-chain genes decrease with development. The inset shows only the expression of the collagen XI chains with an expanded scale at 1–3 months. C, immunoblot analyses of α1(V) and α1(XI) chain expression during tendon development detected the α1 chains of collagens I, V, and XI. The position of cross-linked collagen I α-chains including β1,1 is indicated by the square bracket. Molecular weight markers are presented on the right. D, immunolocalization of collagens V and XI in early development shows reactivity for α1(V) and α1(XI) throughout the P4 tendon.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The regulatory roles of collagens V and XI in nucleation of protofibril assembly were analyzed during early tendon development (E18), where protofibril assembly is the dominant stage in fibrillogenesis. An analysis comparable with that described for the P30 tendons was done using tendons from wild type, both Col5a1 and Col11a1 heterozygous, and compound heterozygous mice. The results were analogous to those described for the P30 tendons. Both Col5a1+/− and Col11a1+/− tendons had fibrils with structures comparable with the wild type control mice (Fig. 4). However, the compound heterozygote (Col5a1+/−,Col11a1+/−) mice had more heterogeneous fibril diameters and larger fibrils, demonstrating a phenotype comparable with that observed in the mature compound heterozygous mutant mice.FIGURE 4Compound heterozygous (Col5a1+/−,Col11a1+/−) mice demonstrate a fibril phenotype in early tendon development. Col5a1+/− and Col11a+/− tendons show normal fibril morphology and a small increase in fibril diameter relative to wild type tendons (arrows in A–C). In contrast, compound heterozygous mice have larger diameter fibrils that are beginning to display irregular fibril cross-sections (arrows in D) compared with both the wild type and haplo-insufficient mice. Transmission electron micrographs are of cross-sections from E18 mouse FDL tendons.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fibril structure was analyzed in collagen XI-null (Col11a1−/−) or collagen XI-null and collagen V haplo-insufficient (Col11a1−/−,Col5a1+/−) tendons (Fig. 5). Both genotypes resulted in a severe fibril phenotype, with the compound mutant being significantly more severe. The Col11a1−/− tendons were composed of fibrils with a heterogeneous distribution of fibril diameters. In addition, there was a subpopulation of large diameter fibrils with aberrant fibril structures, i.e. the fibril cross-sections were irregular. When the effect of reducing collagen V in the absence of collagen XI was analyzed in the compound Col11a1−/−,Col5a1+/− tendons, the same basic fibril phenotype was observed but was considerably more severe than in the collagen XI-null tendon, the diameters were more heterogeneous, and the subpopulation of structurally aberrant fibrils accounted for a higher percentage of the total fibrils. Overall, the basic tendon architecture, i.e. organization of fibrils into fibers associated with tendon fibroblasts, was disrupted in both genotypes (Fig. 5, E and F). Tendon architecture is recognizable but disorganized in Col11a1−/−,Col5a1+/− tendons (Fig. 5F) with an obvious decrease in the number of fibrils compared with the wild type controls.FIGURE 5A severe collagen XI-null fibril phenotype is enhanced by reduction in collagen V, indicating synergistic regulatory roles. The loss of collagen XI in Col11a1−/− tendons (B and C) is associated with abnormally large fibrils with aberrant structures (arrows) compared with wild type controls (A). A deficiency in collagen XI coupled with a reduction in collagen V results in an increased severity of the fibril phenotype, including a substantial decrease in the number of fibrils (C). The disruption in fibrillogenesis results in disrupted fiber assembly (D–F, asterisks) and overall tendon structure. Again, this is more severe in the compound mutant tendons. Transmission electron micrographs of E18 mouse tendons in cross-section are shown. D–F are low magnification micrographs of regions comparable with those in A–C, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The fibril diameter distributions were analyzed in tendons with altered collagen V and XI expression at E18 (Fig. 6A). The results of the single heterozygous and compound heterozygous mice were analogous to those observed in P30 tendons. All three genotypes demonstrated a shift to larger diameter fibrils seen as an increase in the median from 35 nm in the wild type control to up to 43 nm in the mutant tendons. In addition, a broadening of the diameter distribution was observed as an increase in the interquartile range (Q3-Q1) from 7 to 11 nm. The Col11a1−/− and Col11a1−/−,Col5a1+/− tendons demonstrated an even broader distribution with Q3-Q1 increasing to 15 and 16 nm, respectively. All of the tendons with reduced collagen XI developed a right-hand shoulder on the distribution consistent with the structurally abnormal fibril population. The Q3 values shifted from 39 nm in wild type tendons to 43–48 nm in tendons with reduced collagen XI. The heterogeneity and size of fibrils in this subpopulation, defined by Q4-Q3, increased from 24 nm in Col11a1+/− and 38 nm in Col11a1+/−, Col5a1+/− to 69 nm in Col11a1−/− and 76 nm in Col11a1−/−,Col5a1+/− tendons.FIGURE 6Decreases in collagens V and XI lead to dysfunctional regulation of fibrillogenesis and a decreased number of fibrils assembled in early tendon development. A, fibril diameter distributions from E18 tendons with altered collagen V and XI expression are shown. The reduction in collagens V and XI was associated with changes in the diameter distributions relative to wild type controls. All mutant tendons except Col5a1+/− demonstrated the development of a right-hand shoulder with larger and more heterogeneous fibril diameters. This is illustrated by the increase in the range of the last quartile (Q4-Q3) that increases from 17 nm in wild type tendons to 76 nm in Col11a1−/−,Col5a1+/− tendons, with the other genotypes being intermediate. B, shown is analysis of fibril number in tendons with altered collagen V and XI expression. A decrease in fibril density of ∼20% is seen in Col5a1+/− tendons. Col11a1+/−, compound Col11a1+/−,Col5a1+/−, and Col11a1−/− tendons demonstrated a significant decrease in fibril number relative to wild type tendons of ∼26–29%. In contrast, the Col11a1−/−,Col5a1+/− tendons showed an ∼44% decrease. These data are consistent with nucleation and assembly of fewer fibrils. Horizontal lines indicate pairs of data that were significantly different from each other (p < 0.001) in analysis of variance. The down arrow and percentage indicate the % decrease in fibril density for each genotype compared with wild type controls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In addition, the number of fibrils assembled in tendons from the different genotypes was determined (Fig. 6B). All the tendons with reduced collagen V and XI demonstrated a reduction in the number of fibrils assembled. In the Col5a1+/− tendons there was a 20% reduction in fibril number, but this was not statistically significant. However, the reduction in fibril number was statistically significant (p < 0.001) in all other genotypes compared with the wild type controls. The Col11a1+/−, the Col11a1+/−,Col5a1+/−, and the Col11a1−/− tendons had a 26–29% reduction in fibril number. In contrast, the Col11a1−/−,Col5a1+/− tendons demonstrated a 44% reduction in fibril number. This reduction was significant relative to all other genotypes with reduced collagen V and XI (p < 0.001). These results are consistent with differential/coordinate roles for collagens V and XI in the regulation of fibril nucleation and initial assembly in early tendon development.DISCUSSIONIn the current study coordinate regulatory roles for collagens V and XI in fibril nucleation and initial assembly during tendon development were identified. This is the first demonstration of coordinate regulation involving collagens V and XI. Collagen V has been shown to regulate these early steps in dermis (25Wenstrup R.J. Florer J.B. Davidson J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2001090873,"In mammals, the transcriptional activity of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is regulated by the deacetylase SIRT1. However, whether the newly described nongenomic actions of STAT3 toward mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation are dependent on SIRT1 is unclear. In this study, Sirt1 gene knock-out murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells were used to delineate the role of SIRT1 in the regulation of STAT3 mitochondrial function. Here, we show that STAT3 mRNA and protein levels and the accumulation of serine-phosphorylated STAT3 in mitochondria were increased significantly in Sirt1-KO cells as compared with wild-type MEFs. Various mitochondrial bioenergetic parameters, such as the oxygen consumption rate in cell cultures, enzyme activities of the electron transport chain complexes in isolated mitochondria, and production of ATP and lactate, indicated that Sirt1-KO cells exhibited higher mitochondrial respiration as compared with wild-type MEFs. Two independent approaches, including ectopic expression of SIRT1 and siRNA-mediated knockdown of STAT3, led to reduction in intracellular ATP levels and increased lactate production in Sirt1-KO cells that were approaching those of wild-type controls. Comparison of profiles of phospho-antibody array data indicated that the deletion of SirT1 was accompanied by constitutive activation of the pro-inflammatory NF-κB pathway, which is key for STAT3 induction and increased cellular respiration in Sirt1-KO cells. Thus, SIRT1 appears to be a functional regulator of NF-κB-dependent STAT3 expression that induces mitochondrial biogenesis. These results have implications for understanding the interplay between STAT3 and SIRT1 in pro-inflammatory conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2089539705,"Sperm competition favors increases in relative testes mass and production efficiency, and changes in sperm phenotype that result in faster swimming speeds. However, little is known about its effects on traits that contribute to determine the quality of a whole ejaculate (i.e., proportion of motile, viable, morphologically normal and acrosome intact sperm) and that are key determinants of fertilization success. Two competing hypotheses lead to alternative predictions: (a) sperm quantity and quality traits co-evolve under sperm competition because they play complementary roles in determining ejaculate's competitive ability, or (b) energetic constraints force trade-offs between traits depending on their relevance in providing a competitive advantage. We examined relationships between sperm competition levels, sperm quantity, and traits that determine ejaculate quality, in a comparative study of 18 rodent species using phylogenetically controlled analyses. Total sperm numbers were positively correlated to proportions of normal sperm, acrosome integrity and motile sperm; the latter three were also significantly related among themselves, suggesting no trade-offs between traits. In addition, testes mass corrected for body mass (i.e., relative testes mass), showed a strong association with sperm numbers, and positive significant associations with all sperm traits that determine ejaculate quality with the exception of live sperm. An “overall sperm quality” parameter obtained by principal component analysis (which explained 85% of the variance) was more strongly associated with relative testes mass than any individual quality trait. Overall sperm quality was as strongly associated with relative testes mass as sperm numbers. Thus, sperm quality traits improve under sperm competition in an integrated manner suggesting that a combination of all traits is what makes ejaculates more competitive. In evolutionary terms this implies that a complex network of genetic and developmental pathways underlying processes of sperm formation, maturation, transport in the female reproductive tract, and preparation for fertilization must all evolve in concert."
https://openalex.org/W2120824216,"Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) are of significant health concern. The emergence of drug resistant E. coli with high virulence potential is alarming. Lack of sufficient data on transmission dynamics, virulence spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of certain pathogens such as the uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) from countries with high infection burden, such as India, hinders the infection control and management efforts. In this study, we extensively genotyped and phenotyped a collection of 150 UPEC obtained from patients belonging to a semi-urban, industrialized setting near Pune, India. The isolates representing different clinical categories were analyzed in comparison with 50 commensal E. coli isolates from India as well as 50 ExPEC strains from Germany. Virulent strains were identified based on hemolysis, haemagglutination, cell surface hydrophobicity, serum bactericidal activity as well as with the help of O serotyping. We generated antimicrobial resistance profiles for all the clinical isolates and carried out phylogenetic analysis based on repetitive extragenic palindromic (rep)-PCR. E. coli from urinary tract infection cases expressed higher percentages of type I (45%) and P fimbriae (40%) when compared to fecal isolates (25% and 8% respectively). Hemolytic group comprised of 60% of UPEC and only 2% of E. coli from feces. Additionally, we found that serum resistance and cell surface hydrophobicity were not significantly (p = 0.16/p = 0.51) associated with UPEC from clinical cases. Moreover, clinical isolates exhibited highest resistance against amoxicillin (67.3%) and least against nitrofurantoin (57.3%). We also observed that 31.3% of UPEC were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers belonging to serotype O25, of which four were also positive for O25b subgroup that is linked to B2-O25b-ST131-CTX-M-15 virulent/multiresistant type. Furthermore, isolates from India and Germany (as well as global sources) were found to be genetically distinct with no evidence to espouse expansion of E. coli from India to the west or vice-versa."

Prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthases are targets of nonspecific nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and COX-2-specific inhibitors called coxibs. PGHS-2 is a sequence homodimer. Each monomer has a peroxidase and a COX active site. We find that human PGHS-2 functions as a conformational heterodimer having a catalytic monomer (Ecat) and an allosteric monomer (Eallo). Heme binds tightly only to the peroxidase site of Ecat, whereas substrates, as well as certain inhibitors (e.g. celecoxib), bind the COX site of Ecat. Ecat is regulated by Eallo in a manner dependent on what ligand is bound to Eallo. Substrate and nonsubstrate fatty acids (FAs) and some COX inhibitors (e.g. naproxen) preferentially bind to the COX site of Eallo. AA can bind to Ecat and Eallo, but the affinity of AA for Eallo is 25 times that for Ecat. Palmitic acid, an efficacious stimulator of human PGHS-2, binds only Eallo in palmitic acid/murine PGHS-2 co-crystals. Nonsubstrate FAs can potentiate or attenuate actions of COX inhibitors depending on the FA and whether the inhibitor binds Ecat or Eallo. Our studies suggest that the concentration and composition of the free FA pool in the environment in which PGHS-2 functions in cells, the FA tone, is a key factor regulating PGHS-2 activity and its responses to COX inhibitors.

In this study, we examined the functioning of the human (hu) PGHS-2 conformational heterodimer by quantifying interactions involving huPGHS-2 and heme and different FAs and COX inhibitors. The data are consistent with a heme being bound to the POX active site of only one monomer, i.e. the catalytic monomer, of the huPGHS-2 dimer. Additional studies with FAs and COX inhibitors indicate that substrate FAs and one subset of COX inhibitors bind to the COX site of the catalytic monomer and that both substrate and nonsubstrate FAs and a second subset of COX inhibitors bind to the COX site of the allosteric monomer. The results of examining the interplay between FAs and COX inhibitors lead us to speculate that there can be important dietary effects on both base-line PG formation and responses to COX inhibitors. Diets leading to accumulation of different types of FAs in tissue have the potential to either potentiate or attenuate responses to COX inhibitors, depending on the diet and the inhibitor.

One unit of COX activity is defined as 1 μmol of O2 consumed per min at 37 °C in the assay standard mixture. A representative tracing obtained with a low concentration of AA is shown in supplemental Fig. S1. COX assays performed at high enzyme/substrate ratios were conducted in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 1 μm [1-14C]AA, 0.10–2.0 μm huPGHS-2, 5 μm hematin, and 1 mm phenol in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched with 100 μl of stop buffer consisting of ethyl acetate/acetic acid (95:5). The resultant samples were centrifuged at room temperature for 5 min at 4000 × g. An aliquot of the organic layer (100 μl) was subjected to HPLC on a Luna C18 (2van der Donk W.A. Tsai A.L. Kulmacz R.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15451-15458Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) column (5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm, Phenomenex) mounted on a Shimadzu HPLC system equipped with radio-HPLC detector (IN/US system, β-RAM model 4). The bound products were eluted in a gradient elution mode eluting with Solution A (acetonitrile/water; 30:70) for 5 min and then with a linear gradient of Solutions A and B (acetonitrile/water; 90:10) for 15 min, then Solution B for 8 min, and finally Solution A for 4 min; Solutions A and B both contained 0.1% acetic acid (v/v). The flow rate was 1 ml/min. Representative elution times for PGH2, 17-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid, and AA are 14, 18, and 30 min, respectively. Difference absorption spectra of apo-huPGHS-2 titrated with heme were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-2501 PC scanning spectrophotometer. Aliquots of a 200 μm hematin solution in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, containing 40 mm KCl, 0.1% C10E6, and 2% DMSO were added to a quartz cuvette containing 200 μl of 5 μm apo-huPGHS-2 in the same buffer solution without DMSO at room temperature (26Duncan T. Osawa Y. Kutty R.K. Kutty G. Wiggert B. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1222-1228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Huber 3rd, W.J. Backes W.L. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 373: 167-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The increase in absorbance at 408 nm was plotted in a linear form using the equation I0/α = (Kd/(1 − α) + e0), where I0 is the concentration of added heme; α, the fraction of enzyme sites occupied by heme, is given by α = Δ/Δmax, where Δ is the optical change measured (27Huber 3rd, W.J. Backes W.L. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 373: 167-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar); in this plot, the slope is equal to the Kd for heme binding, and the intercept (e0) represents the concentration of heme-binding sites. Titrations were also performed in the presence of palmitic acid and several COX inhibitors. Recombinant His6 N580A murine (mu) PGHS-2 was overexpressed in insect cells and purified as described previously (23Vecchio A.J. Simmons D.M. Malkowski M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 22152-22163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For crystallization, apo-His6 N580A, muPGHS-2 were reconstituted with a 2-fold molar excess of Co3+-protoporphyrin IX, followed by dialysis against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.6% (w/v) β-OG for 16 h at 4 °C. A 10-fold molar excess of PA was added to the Co3+-protoporphyrin IX reconstituted protein just prior to crystallization screening. Crystals were produced utilizing the sitting-drop vapor diffusion technique by combining 3 μl of protein solution with 3 μl of 23–34% polyacrylic acid 5100, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, and 0.6% (w/v) β-OG and equilibrating the resulting drop against reservoir solutions comprised of 23–34% polyacrylic acid 5100, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 20 mm MgCl2. The crystals were transferred to a solution of 30% polyacrylic acid 5100, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, and 0.6% (w/v) β-OG supplemented with 10% ethylene glycol for cryoprotection 15–30 min prior to data collection. Data were collected on beamline A1 at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (Ithaca, NY) using an Area Detector Systems CCD Quantum-210 detector. The data were integrated and scaled using MOSFLM and SCALA, respectively, in the CCP4 suite of programs (28Dodson E.J. Winn M. Ralph A.

Chem. 2010; 285: 22152-22163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) were utilized to minimize model bias. Specifically, initial phases for the muPGHS-2/PA co-crystal structure were determined by molecular replacement methods using PHASER (29McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14567) Google Scholar). The phases were then input into ARP/wARP (30Langer G. Cohen S.X. Lamzin V.S. Perrakis A. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar) to build most of the deleted portions of the model. Iterative cycles of manual model building and refinement using COOT (31Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23389) Google Scholar) and REFMAC5 (32Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) were then carried out to fit the remaining residues, adding waters, PA, and other ligand molecules. The final model includes two monomers in the crystallographic asymmetric unit comprised of protein residues 33–582 in monomer A and residues 33–583 in monomer B, Co3+-protoporphyrin IX, N-linked carbohydrates, and a β-OG detergent molecule. Minimized coordinates and stereochemical dictionary for PA were generated using the PRODRG server (33Schüttelkopf A.W. van Aalten D.M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (4291) Google Scholar). TLS refinement was carried out during the final rounds of refinement (34Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). Final refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. To verify that PA bound with its carboxylate interacting with Arg-120 in only one monomer of the murine PGHS-2/PA co-crystal structure, we performed the following experiments. In the first test, PA was modeled into the COX channel of monomer A such that the carboxylate interacted with Tyr-385 and Ser-530. This conformation is similar to the nonproductive conformations of AA and eicosapentaenoic acid observed in monomer A of the co-crystal structures of muPGHS-2/AA and muPGHS-2/eicosapentaenoic acid (23Vecchio A.J. Simmons D.M. Malkowski M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 22152-22163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Cycles of REFMAC5 refinement were performed, followed by calculation of 2Fo − Fc and Fo − Fc electron density maps. Inspection of the resulting electron density maps clearly showed negative difference density around the improperly placed carboxylate of PA at the apex of the channel and excess positive difference density around the ω-end of PA near the side chain of Arg-120. In the second test, we placed PA into the COX channel of monomer B and modeled ethylene glycol into the COX channel of monomer A of the muPGHS-2/PA co-crystal structure. After REFMAC refinement and generation of electron density maps, there were negative density peaks around the carboxylate and ω-end of PA. Similarly, there were excess positive difference density peaks within the channel of monomer A that were not accounted for by the ethylene glycol molecules. Finally, in the third test, we modeled both PA and ethylene glycol molecules into the COX channel of monomer A and assigned occupancies of 50% to each. REFMAC5 refinement followed by electron density map calculations clearly showed positive electron density peaks for the ω-end of PA near the apex of the channel and for carbons 3–5 near the opening of the channel. Hence, these tests support the modeling of PA into monomer A only such that the carboxylate lies near the opening of the cyclooxygenase channel near the side chain of Arg-120. van der Waals and hydrogen bond interactions were calculated using the program COOT. The upper limit on distance for consideration as a van der Waals contact is 4.0 Å. Superposition of coordinates between structures was done using the program LSQAB within the CCP4 suite of programs and the coordinates for all Cα atoms unless otherwise stated. Simulated annealing omit maps were calculated using CNS (35Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). Model validation was performed using MOLPROBITY (36Davis I.W.

The coordinates and structure factors for Co3+-protoporphyrin IX reconstituted muPGHS-2 in complex with PA have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, code 3QH0. Titration of apo-huPGHS-2 with hematin yielded a major UV-visible spectral peak with a λmax at 408 nm indicative of formation of a heme·PGHS-2 complex (Fig. 1A) (15Kulmacz R.J. Lands W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6358-6363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Percival M.D. Ouellet M. Vincent C.J. Yergey J.A. Kennedy B.P. O'Neill G.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The data are consistent with one high affinity heme-binding site per PGHS-2 dimer (i.e. 0.92 mol of heme/mol of dimer) with a Kd = 88 ± 17 nm (n = 6) and a nonsaturable lower affinity site(s) (Fig. 1, B and C). The nonsaturable site(s) may represent lower affinity binding to the hexahistidine tag on huPGHS-2 and/or other nonspecific hydrophobic sites on the protein. We presume that at least the higher affinity site represents binding of heme to a POX site of huPGHS-2. Heme titrations of huPGHS-2 were also performed in the presence of 20 μm palmitic acid (PA), 25 μm celecoxib, 50 μm naproxen, a combination of 20 μm palmitic acid and 25 μm celecoxib, and 1.0 and 2.5 mm aspirin. The Kd values for heme binding to huPGHS-2 were essentially the same in the presence of PA, celecoxib, naproxen, or aspirin (supplemental Tables S1 and S2). In parallel with the spectroscopic titrations, COX assays were performed with huPGHS-2 in the presence of different concentrations of heme (Fig. 1D). Maximal COX activity occurred at a ratio of about one heme per dimer. These titrations, which for practical reasons were performed at 37 °C and at relatively low enzyme concentrations, predict a Kd value of 5–10 nm. This value is significantly less than the Kd value determined spectrophotometrically (i.e. 88 nm) at 25 °C in 0–0.15% DMSO with a 200 times higher concentration of enzyme. Nonetheless, the spectroscopic heme titration data indicate that there is only one high affinity heme-binding site per dimer, and the COX assay data suggest that huPGHS-2 functions optimally with one heme bound per mol of dimer. We previously reported that the COX activity of huPGHS-2 is stimulated by some nonsubstrate FAs (24Yuan C. Sidhu R.S. Kuklev D.V. Kado Y. Wada M. Song I. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 10046-10055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 compares the concentration-dependent effects of several different nonsubstrate FAs on the COX activities of huPGHS-2 with 5 μm AA as the substrate; the Km value of huPGHS-2 for AA in the absence of other FAs is about 8.5 μm. The rate of AA oxygenation by PGHS-2 was increased by many nonsubstrate FAs. The most abundant free FA in many mammalian cells (39Górski J. Nawrocki A. Murthy M. Mol. Cell.

To date, little is known on potential oxidative damage and on protective antioxidative defense mechanisms in the brain of fish under cold shock. In this study, the concentration of cellular protein carbonyls in brain was significantly increased by 38% within 1 h after cold exposure (from 28°C to 18°C) of zebrafish (Danio rerio). In addition, the specific activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the mRNA level of catalase (CAT) were increased after cold exposure by about 60% (6 h) and by 60%–90% (1 and 24 h), respectively, while the specific glutathione content as well as the ratio of glutathione disulfide to glutathione remained constant and at a very low level. In addition, cold exposure increased the protein level of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) by about 50% and the mRNA level of the glucose transporter zglut3 in brain by 50%–100%. To test for an involvement of uncoupling proteins (UCPs) in the cold adaptation of zebrafish, five UCP members were annotated and identified (zucp1-5). With the exception of zucp1, the mRNA levels of the other four zucps were significantly increased after cold exposure. In addition, the mRNA levels of four of the fish homologs (zppar) of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) were increased after cold exposure. These data suggest that PPARs and UCPs are involved in the alterations observed in zebrafish brain after exposure to 18°C. The observed stimulation of the PPAR-UCP axis may help to prevent oxidative damage and to maintain metabolic balance and cellular homeostasis in the brains of ectothermic zebrafish upon cold exposure."
https://openalex.org/W1963856309,"ADAR2, an RNA editing enzyme that converts specific adenosines to inosines in certain pre-mRNAs, often leading to amino acid substitutions in the encoded proteins, is mainly expressed in brain. Of all ADAR2-mediated edits, a single one in the pre-mRNA of the AMPA receptor subunit GluA2 is essential for survival. Hence, early postnatal death of mice lacking ADAR2 is averted when the critical edit is engineered into both GluA2 encoding Gria2 alleles. Adar2(-/-)/Gria2(R/R) mice display normal appearance and life span, but the general phenotypic effects of global lack of ADAR2 have remained unexplored. Here we have employed the Adar2(-/-)/Gria2(R/R) mouse line, and Gria2(R/R) mice as controls, to study the phenotypic consequences of loss of all ADAR2-mediated edits except the critical one in GluA2. Our extended phenotypic analysis covering ∼320 parameters identified significant changes related to absence of ADAR2 in behavior, hearing ability, allergy parameters and transcript profiles of brain."
https://openalex.org/W2087845227,"Background Psoriasis is an immunoinflammatory disease associated with cardiovascular risk factors, atherothrombotic events, and hypercoagulability. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is potentially lethal and shares risk factors with psoriasis, but the risk of VTE associated with psoriasis is unknown. The present study investigated the potential association between psoriasis and VTE. Methods and Findings Information from nationwide prospectively recorded registers of hospitalization, drug dispensing from pharmacies, socio-economic data, and causes of death was linked on an individual level. In an unselected nationwide cohort, we used multivariate Poisson regression models controlling for age, gender, comorbidity, concomitant medication, socio-economic data, and calendar year, to assess the risk of VTE associated with psoriasis. A total of 35,138 patients with mild and 3,526 patients with severe psoriasis were identified and compared with 4,126,075 controls. Patients with psoriasis had higher incidence rates per 1000 person-years of VTE than controls (1.29, 1.92, and 3.20 for controls, mild psoriasis, and severe psoriasis, respectively). The rate ratio (RR) of VTE was elevated in all patients with psoriasis with RR 1.35 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21–1.49) and RR 2.06 (CI 1.63–2.61) for mild and severe psoriasis, respectively. Exclusion of patients with malignancies, and censoring of patients undergoing surgery did not alter the results. Conclusion This nationwide cohort study indicates that patients with psoriasis are at increased risk of VTE. The risk was highest in young patients with severe psoriasis. Physicians should be aware that patients with psoriasis may be at increased risk of both venous and arterial thromboembolic events."
https://openalex.org/W2086315831,"Reconciliation, a post-conflict affiliative interaction between former opponents, is an important mechanism for reducing the costs of aggressive conflict in primates and some other mammals as it may repair the opponents' relationship and reduce post-conflict distress. Opponents who share a valuable relationship are expected to be more likely to reconcile as for such partners the benefits of relationship repair should outweigh the risk of renewed aggression. In birds, however, post-conflict behavior has thus far been marked by an apparent absence of reconciliation, suggested to result either from differing avian and mammalian strategies or because birds may not share valuable relationships with partners with whom they engage in aggressive conflict. Here, we demonstrate the occurrence of reconciliation in a group of captive subadult ravens (Corvus corax) and show that it is more likely to occur after conflicts between partners who share a valuable relationship. Furthermore, former opponents were less likely to engage in renewed aggression following reconciliation, suggesting that reconciliation repairs damage caused to their relationship by the preceding conflict. Our findings suggest not only that primate-like valuable relationships exist outside the pair bond in birds, but that such partners may employ the same mechanisms in birds as in primates to ensure that the benefits afforded by their relationships are maintained even when conflicts of interest escalate into aggression. These results provide further support for a convergent evolution of social strategies in avian and mammalian species."
https://openalex.org/W1970074048,"Despite significant advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing, many important species remain understudied at the genome level. In this study we addressed a question of what can be predicted about the genome-wide characteristics of less studied species, based on the genomic data from completely sequenced species. Using NCBI databases we performed a comparative genome-wide analysis of such characteristics as alternative splicing, number of genes, gene products and exons in 36 completely sequenced model species. We created statistical regression models to fit these data and applied them to loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.), an example of an important species whose genome has not been completely sequenced yet. Using these models, the genome-wide characteristics, such as total number of genes and exons, can be roughly predicted based on parameters estimated from available limited genomic data, e.g. exon length and exon/gene ratio."
https://openalex.org/W2009130780,"Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) is a fibrotic lung disease that occurs in a variety of clinical settings, including toxin exposures, autoimmunity and lung or bone marrow transplant. Despite its increasing clinical importance, little is known regarding the underlying disease mechanisms due to a lack of adequate small animal BO models. Recent epidemiological studies have implicated exposure to diacetyl (DA), a volatile component of artificial butter flavoring, as a cause of BO in otherwise healthy factory workers. Our overall hypothesis is that DA induces severe epithelial injury and aberrant repair that leads to the development of BO. Therefore, the objectives of this study were 1) to determine if DA, delivered by intratracheal instillation (ITI), would lead to the development of BO in rats and 2) to characterize epithelial regeneration and matrix repair after ITI of DA.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with a single dose of DA (125 mg/kg) or sterile water (vehicle control) by ITI. Instilled DA resulted in airway specific injury, followed by rapid epithelial regeneration, and extensive intraluminal airway fibrosis characteristic of BO. Increased airway resistance and lung fluid neutrophilia occurred with the development of BO, similar to human disease. Despite rapid epithelial regeneration after DA treatment, expression of the normal phenotypic markers, Clara cell secretory protein and acetylated tubulin, were diminished. In contrast, expression of the matrix component Tenascin C was significantly increased, particularly evident within the BO lesions.We have established that ITI of DA results in BO, creating a novel chemical-induced animal model that replicates histological, biological and physiological features of the human disease. Furthermore, we demonstrate that dysregulated epithelial repair and excessive matrix Tenacin C deposition occur in BO, providing new insights into potential disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W1966954598,"A mathematical model is proposed which is able to describe the most important features of cell differentiation, without requiring specific detailed assumptions concerning the interactions which drive the phenomenon. On the contrary, cell differentiation is described here as an emergent property of a generic model of the underlying gene regulatory network, and it can therefore be applied to a variety of different organisms. The model points to a peculiar role of cellular noise in differentiation and leads to non trivial predictions which could be subject to experimental testing. Moreover, a single model proves able to describe several different phenomena observed in various differentiation processes."
https://openalex.org/W1983222482,"It is not yet known whether the scalar properties of explicit timing are also displayed by more implicit, predictive forms of timing. We investigated whether performance in both explicit and predictive timing tasks conformed to the two psychophysical properties of scalar timing: the Psychophysical law and Weber's law. Our explicit temporal generalization task required overt estimation of the duration of an empty interval bounded by visual markers, whereas our temporal expectancy task presented visual stimuli at temporally predictable intervals, which facilitated motor preparation thus speeding target detection. The Psychophysical Law and Weber's Law were modeled, respectively, by (1) the functional dependence between mean subjective time and real time (2) the linearity of the relationship between timing variability and duration. Results showed that performance for predictive, as well as explicit, timing conformed to both psychophysical properties of interval timing. Both tasks showed the same linear relationship between subjective and real time, demonstrating that the same representational mechanism is engaged whether it is transferred into an overt estimate of duration or used to optimise sensorimotor behavior. Moreover, variability increased with increasing duration during both tasks, consistent with a scalar representation of time in both predictive and explicit timing. However, timing variability was greater during predictive timing, at least for durations greater than 200 msec, and ascribable to temporal, rather than non-temporal, mechanisms engaged by the task. These results suggest that although the same internal representation of time was used in both tasks, its external manifestation varied as a function of temporal task goals."
https://openalex.org/W2133054367,"Background Whether intake of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), the plant-derived n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), could prevent cardiovascular diseases is not yet clear. We examined the associations of ALA intake with 10-year incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke in the Netherlands. Methods Data were collected from a general population of 20,069 generally healthy men and women, aged 20 to 65 years. Habitual diet was assessed at baseline (1993–1997) with a validated 178-item food frequency questionnaire. Incidences of CHD and stroke were assessed through linkage with mortality and morbidity registers. Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated with multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for age, gender, lifestyle, and dietary factors. Results During 8–13 years of follow-up, we observed 280 incident CHD events (19% fatal) and 221 strokes (4% fatal). Intakes of energy-adjusted ALA in quintiles ranged from less than 1.0 g/d in the bottom quintile (Q1) to more than 1.9 g/d in the top quintile (Q5). ALA intake was not associated with incident CHD, with HRs varying between 0.89 and 1.01 (all p>0.05) in Q2–Q5 compared with the bottom quintile of ALA intake. For incident stroke, however, participants in Q2–Q5 had a 35–50% lower risk compared with the reference group. HRs were 0.65 (0.43–0.97), 0.49 (0.31–0.76), 0.53 (0.34–0.83), and 0.65 (0.41–1.04) for Q2–Q5 respectively. Conclusion In this general Dutch population, ALA intake was not associated with incident CHD. The data suggested that a low intake of ALA may be a risk factor for incident stroke. These results warrant confirmation in other population-based studies and in trials."
https://openalex.org/W2028071047,"Objective To demonstrate that hypolipidemia is a typical feature of the mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and to assess the association between hypolipidemia and disease stage, dietary intake, and sex. Methods We compared daily dietary intake, body weight, and serumlipid and glucose levels in ALS mice and wild-type controls at different stages of the disease. Findings Total cholesterol low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and LDL/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio were significantly lower in ALS mice compared with controls. Subgroup analysis revealed that the incidence of hypolipidemia was significantly greater in male, but not female, ALS mice compared with control mice and that hypolipidemia was present at the presymptomatic stage of the disease. This hypolipidemia can be found without a decrease in the serum levels of other energy sources, such as glucose, in the presymptomatic stage. Conclusions Hypolipidemia is present at the presymptomatic stage of the ALS mouse model in the absence of malnutrition, significant neuromuscular degeneration or regeneration, and respiratory difficulty. Our findings suggest that hypolipidemia might be associated with the pathomechanism of ALS and/or lipid-specific metabolism rather than simply an epiphenomenon of neuromuscular degeneration or energy imbalance."

We used the Western Australian Data Linkage System (WADLS) to establish the presence of new cases of dementia between 1996 and 2009 according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Crude and adjusted hazard ratio (HR, 95% confidence interval, 95%CI) of dementia for each adiposity marker was calculated using Cox regression models. Other measured factors included age, marital status, education, alcohol use, smoking, diet, physical activity, and prevalent hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia and cardiovascular disease. Results Compared with men with BMI<25, participants with BMI between 25–30 had lower adjusted HR of dementia (HR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.70–0.95). The HR of dementia for men with BMI≥30 was comparable to men with BMI<25 (HR = 0.82, 95%CI = 0.67–1.01). Waist circumference showed no obvious association with dementia hazard. Men with WHR≥0.9 had lower adjusted HR of dementia than men with WHR <0.9 (HR = 0.82, 95%CI = 0.69–0.98). We found a “J” shape association between measures of obesity and the hazard of dementia, with the nadir of risk being in the overweight range of BMI and about 1 for WHR. Conclusions Higher adiposity is not associated with incident dementia in this Australian cohort of older men. Overweight men and those with WHR≥0.9 have lower hazard of dementia than men with normal weight and with WHR<0.9."
https://openalex.org/W2167981628,"Most spiders use venom to paralyze their prey and are commonly feared for their potential to cause injury to humans. In North America, one species in particular, Loxosceles reclusa (brown recluse spider, Sicariidae), causes the majority of necrotic wounds induced by the Araneae. However, its distributional limitations are poorly understood and, as a result, medical professionals routinely misdiagnose brown recluse bites outside endemic areas, confusing putative spider bites for other serious conditions. To address the issue of brown recluse distribution, we employ ecological niche modeling to investigate the present and future distributional potential of this species. We delineate range boundaries and demonstrate that under future climate change scenarios, the spider's distribution may expand northward, invading previously unaffected regions of the USA. At present, the spider's range is centered in the USA, from Kansas east to Kentucky and from southern Iowa south to Louisiana. Newly influenced areas may include parts of Nebraska, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, South Dakota, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. These results illustrate a potential negative consequence of climate change on humans and will aid medical professionals in proper bite identification/treatment, potentially reducing bite misdiagnoses."
https://openalex.org/W1986303828,"ric-8 (resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase 8) genes have positive roles in variegated G protein signaling pathways, including Gα(q) and Gα(s) regulation of neurotransmission, Gα(i)-dependent mitotic spindle positioning during (asymmetric) cell division, and Gα(olf)-dependent odorant receptor signaling. Mammalian Ric-8 activities are partitioned between two genes, ric-8A and ric-8B. Ric-8A is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Gα(i)/α(q)/α(12/13) subunits. Ric-8B potentiated G(s) signaling presumably as a Gα(s)-class GEF activator, but no demonstration has shown Ric-8B GEF activity. Here, two Ric-8B isoforms were purified and found to be Gα subunit GDP release factor/GEFs. In HeLa cells, full-length Ric-8B (Ric-8BFL) bound endogenously expressed Gα(s) and lesser amounts of Gα(q) and Gα(13). Ric-8BFL stimulated guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) binding to these subunits and Gα(olf), whereas the Ric-8BΔ9 isoform stimulated Gα(s short) GTPγS binding only. Michaelis-Menten experiments showed that Ric-8BFL elevated the V(max) of Gα(s) steady state GTP hydrolysis and the apparent K(m) values of GTP binding to Gα(s) from ∼385 nm to an estimated value of ∼42 μM. Directionality of the Ric-8BFL-catalyzed Gα(s) exchange reaction was GTP-dependent. At sub-K(m) GTP, Ric-BFL was inhibitory to exchange despite being a rapid GDP release accelerator. Ric-8BFL binds nucleotide-free Gα(s) tightly, and near-K(m) GTP levels were required to dissociate the Ric-8B·Gα nucleotide-free intermediate to release free Ric-8B and Gα-GTP. Ric-8BFL-catalyzed nucleotide exchange probably proceeds in the forward direction to produce Gα-GTP in cells."
https://openalex.org/W1977752020,"Background The stabilization or regulated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for cellular structure and function. Recently, we could show that the activation of the SK3-channel that represents the predominant SK-channel in neural stem cells, leads to a rapid local outgrowth of long filopodial processes. This observation indicates that the rearrangement of the actin based cytoskeleton via membrane bound SK3-channels might selectively be controlled in defined micro compartments of the cell. Principal Findings We found two important proteins for cytoskeletal rearrangement, the Abelson interacting protein 1, Abi-1 and the neural Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome Protein, nWASP, to be in complex with SK3- channels in neural stem cells (NSCs). Moreover, this interaction is also found in spines and postsynaptic compartments of developing primary hippocampal neurons and regulates neurite outgrowth during early phases of differentiation. Overexpression of the proteins or pharmacological activation of SK3 channels induces obvious structural changes in NSCs and hippocampal neurons. In both neuronal cell systems SK3 channels and nWASP act synergistic by strongly inducing filopodial outgrowth while Abi-1 behaves antagonistic to its interaction partners. Conclusions Our results give good evidence for a functional interplay of a trimeric complex that transforms incoming signals via SK3-channel activation into the local rearrangement of the cytoskeleton in early steps of neuronal differentiation involving nWASP and Abi-1 actin binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2047603099,"Previous studies demonstrated the human ability to implicitly recognize their own body. When submitted to a visual matching task, participants showed the so-called self-advantage, that is, a better performance with self rather than others' body or body parts. Here, we investigated whether the body self-advantage relies upon a motor representation of one's body. Participants were submitted to a laterality judgment of self and others' hands (Experiment 1 and 3), which involves a sensory-motor mental simulation. Moreover, to investigate whether the self-advantage emerges also when an explicit self processing is required, the same participants were submitted to an explicit self-body recognition task (Experiment 2). Participants showed the self-advantage when performing the laterality judgment, but not when self-recognition was explicitly required. Thus, implicit and explicit recognition of the bodily self dissociate and only an implicit recognition of the bodily self, mapped in motor terms, allows the self-advantage to emerge."
https://openalex.org/W1989022029,"Although pituitary adenomas are usually benign, unique trophic mechanisms restraining cell proliferation are unclear. As GH-secreting adenomas are associated with p53/p21-dependent senescence, we tested mechanisms constraining non-functioning pituitary adenoma growth. Thirty six gonadotroph-derived non-functioning pituitary adenomas all exhibited DNA damage, but undetectable p21 expression. However, these adenomas all expressed p16, and >90% abundantly expressed cytoplasmic clusterin associated with induction of the Cdk inhibitor p15 in 70% of gonadotroph and in 26% of somatotroph lineage adenomas (p = 0.006). Murine LβT2 and αT3 gonadotroph pituitary cells, and αGSU.PTTG transgenic mice with targeted gonadotroph cell adenomas also abundantly expressed clusterin and exhibited features of oncogene-induced senescence as evidenced by C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ induction. In turn, C/EBPs activated the clusterin promoter ∼5 fold, and elevated clusterin subsequently elicited p15 and p16 expression, acting to arrest murine gonadotroph cell proliferation. In contrast, specific clusterin suppression by RNAis enhanced gonadotroph proliferation. FOXL2, a tissue-specific gonadotroph lineage factor, also induced the clusterin promoter ∼3 fold in αT3 pituitary cells. As nine of 12 pituitary carcinomas were devoid of clusterin expression, this protein may limit proliferation of benign adenomatous pituitary cells. These results point to lineage-specific pathways restricting uncontrolled murine and human pituitary gonadotroph adenoma cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1992675615,"Spt5 is a transcription factor conserved in all three domains of life. Spt5 homologues from bacteria and archaea bind the largest subunit of their respective RNA polymerases. Here we demonstrate that Spt5 directly associates with RNA polymerase (Pol) I and RNA Pol II in yeast through its central region containing conserved NusG N-terminal homology and KOW domains. Deletion analysis of SPT5 supports our biochemical data, demonstrating the importance of the KOW domains in Spt5 function.

Based on these data, we propose a model in which Spt5 is recruited to the rDNA early in transcription and propose that it plays an important role in ribosomal RNA synthesis through direct binding to the Pol I complex. The study of ribosome biogenesis is fundamentally important. Multiple studies have connected dysregulation of the factors that affect ribosome biogenesis with cell transformation and cancer (1Treré D. Ceccarelli C. Montanaro L. Tosti E. Derenzini M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2004; 52: 1601-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 2Arabi A. Wu S. Ridderstråle K. Bierhoff H. Shiue C. Fatyol K. Fahlén S. Hydbring P. Söderberg O. Grummt I.

Transcription of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) 2The abbreviations used are: rDNA, ribosomal DNA; Pol, polymerase; NGN, NusG N-terminal homology; rRNA, ribosomal RNA; h, human; RNAP, RNA polymerase; CTR, C-terminal repeat. by RNA polymerase (Pol) I is the initial step of ribosome synthesis. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae (for simplicity referred to as “yeast”), Pol I produces the 35S rRNA precursor, which is co-transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally processed into the mature 18, 5.8, and 25 S rRNA species that form the bulk of the small and large ribosomal subunits. Pol I consists of 14 subunits; seven of which are Pol I-specific, whereas the other seven are shared with RNA Pol II and/or RNA Pol III. Pol I transcription initiation in vivo requires four additional factors: TATA-binding protein, Rrn3, core factor, and the upstream activating factor. Formation of the Rrn3-Pol I complex is a crucial step in the recruitment of Pol I to the promoter. As such, this step in transcription is tightly regulated. However, the initiation step alone cannot account for the magnitude of regulation of Pol I transcription observed in vivo (3Claypool J.A. French S.L. Johzuka K. Eliason K. Vu L. Dodd J.A. Beyer A.L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 5315-5326Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recent data demonstrate that transcription elongation by Pol I is also regulated and that transcription elongation by Pol I is functionally coupled to rRNA processing (5Schneider D.A. Michel A.

Thus, factors that influence the elongation step in transcription may play one or more important roles in overall ribosome synthesis. Although Pol I transcription elongation remains understudied, significantly more is known about factors that affect Pol II transcription elongation. One of these factors is the conserved Spt4/5 complex. In mammalian and Drosophila cells, Spt4/5 induces pausing of the Pol II elongation complex in close proximity to the promoter (reviewed in Ref. 8Saunders A. Core L.J. Lis J.T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). This pause is thought to facilitate pre-mRNA 5′-capping and can be a target for the regulation of gene expression. After release from the pause, Spt4/5 remains associated with the elongation complex and stimulates downstream transcription elongation (reviewed in Ref. 8Saunders A. Core L.J. Lis J.T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In yeast cells, a similar positive role for Spt4/5 in Pol II transcription has been described (9Hartzog G.A. Wada T. Handa H. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 10Rondón A.G. García-Rubio M. González-Barrera S. Aguilera A.

However, to date no negative role for Spt4/5 in Pol II elongation has been observed in yeast. In addition to its role in Pol II transcription, the Spt4/5 complex acts as a Pol I transcription elongation factor (12Schneider D.A. French S.L. Osheim Y.N. Bailey A.O. Vu L. Dodd J. Yates J.R. Beyer A.L. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 12707-12712Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We showed that Spt4 and Spt5 associate with Pol I and rDNA in vivo. Deletion of SPT4 leads to impairment of rRNA processing and a small increase in Pol I transcription elongation rate relative to WT. We proposed that Spt4/5 inhibits Pol I transcription elongation (12Schneider D.A. French S.L. Osheim Y.N. Bailey A.O. Vu L. Dodd J. Yates J.R. Beyer A.L. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We showed that Spt5 associates with Pol I directly in vitro and that the central region of Spt5 (including the NGN and the KOW domains of Spt5) mediates this interaction. Identical regions associate with yeast Pol II. Far Western analysis identified four subunits of Pol I that can interact with Spt5: A190, A135, A49, and A34.5. In vivo analyses support our biochemical data, demonstrating the importance of the KOW domains in Spt5 function. We also observed that the cold-sensitive phenotype of rpa49Δ strains is suppressed by spt5 mutations. Finally, we identified an unexpected direct association of Spt5 with the Pol I transcription initiation factor Rrn3. Together, these observations support a model in which Spt4/5 plays direct roles early in transcription elongation by Pol I. The strains used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. The cells were grown in YEPD (for recipes see Ref. 7Zhang Y. Smith 4th, A.D. Renfrow M.B. Schneider D.A. J. Biol.

Diploid strains were sporulated in liquid sporulation medium (10 g/liter potassium acetate and 5 mg/liter zinc chloride plus required nutrients) for 5 days with mild agitation at room temperature. Tetrads were dissected using a Zeiss Axioskop 40 tetrad micromanipulator. Chromosomal deletions leading to C-terminal truncations of Spt5 were constructed using standard PCR-based strategies (24Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4135) Google Scholar). The nomenclature of the mutant alleles indicates the amino acid length of the corresponding proteins (e.g. spt5(1–930) expresses a His7-HA3-tagged protein that includes the first 930 amino acid residues of Spt5). Spt5 protein abundance was measured by Western blot analysis using an anti-HA antibody (12CA5) and compared with epitope-tagged WT Spt5 (data not shown). The spt5ΔKOW2 mutant allele carries a deletion of a region of SPT5 that corresponds to amino acids 515–578. The spt5ΔKOW2 strain bears a chromosomal deletion of SPT5 complemented by expression of the mutant allele on a single copy CEN plasmid (supplemental Table S2) and was obtained by tetrad dissection of a diploid strain containing a heterozygous deletion of SPT5 (spt5Δ::HIS3Mx6/SPT5). We cloned regions of SPT5 corresponding to the indicated domains into pET41a (Novagen). We used the predicted Spt5 domain structure from European Bioinformatics Institute Data base (EMBL-EBI) and from Ref. 9Hartzog G.A. Wada T. Handa H. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar to select our domain end points. The plasmids expressing Spt5 and Spt5 domains are described in supplemental Table S2. For the expression of the Spt4/5 complex, SPT4 and SPT5 were cloned into pRSFDuet-1 and pETDuet-1 vectors (Novagen), respectively. We introduced a FLAG-His6-TEV-HA3-His6 epitope tag to the C terminus of Spt5 as described in supplemental Table S2. The sequences of the primers used for the cloning of SPT5 or SPT4 and a detailed description of cloning strategy are listed in supplemental Table S3 and the supplemental text. Pol I and Pol II were purified using a His7-HA3 C-terminal epitope tag on the A135 and Rpb2 subunits, respectively, using the same strategy described previously (25Keener J. Josaitis C.A. Dodd J.A. Nomura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33795-33802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). His6-Rrn3 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) from pNOY3162 plasmid and purified as described previously (25Keener J. Josaitis C.A. Dodd J.A. Nomura M. J. Biol.

Full-length Spt5 and Spt5 truncation constructs were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) as N-terminal His6-GST fusion proteins in the presence of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were lysed using a French Press (Thermo IEC) in TIB buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 400 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture; Roche Applied Science). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The proteins were purified from the soluble fraction using nickel affinity chromatography followed by glutathione affinity purification and a second nickel affinity purification step. Equal concentrations of the proteins were used when performing GST pulldown assays or far Western blot analysis. His6-Spt4 and His6-Spt5 were co-expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) in the presence of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The Spt4/5 complex was purified from the soluble fraction of the cell extract using nickel affinity chromatography followed by anion exchange chromatography (HiTrap Q; GE Healthcare), a second nickel affinity purification step, and a final anion exchange step (Mono Q; GE Healthcare). To test for interactions between Spt5 and Pol I or Pol II, HA-tagged Pol I and Pol II were incubated in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1% Nonidet P-40 (or an indicated percentage of Nonidet P-40)) with GST-tagged Spt5 (full-length or mutant constructs) immobilized on glutathione resin (GE Healthcare). To test for an interaction between Spt5 and Rrn3 or the Pol I-Rrn3 complex, we immobilized GST-Spt5 on glutathione resin in binding buffer and added either Pol I, Rrn3, or prebound Pol I-Rrn3 complex. The Rrn3-Pol I complex was formed as described previously (25Keener J. Josaitis C.A. Dodd J.A. Nomura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33795-33802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) using an equimolar ratio of Pol I:Rrn3 or with excess of Rrn3 (ratios 1:3.5 and 1:5). The resin was then washed three times with binding buffer and analyzed by Western blot probed with an anti-HA antibody (12CA5) or with a polyclonal anti-Rrn3 antibody. Far Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (26Edmondson D.G. Dent S.Y. Current Protocols in Protein Science. 2001; : 19.7.1-19.7.10Crossref Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Pure Pol I and Pol II subunits were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. After blocking, the blot was incubated with equal concentration of the GST-fused probes in the probe dilution buffer (1× PBS, 0.05% Tween, 2% milk, 1 mm DTT), followed by a series of washings. We then proceeded with the standard Western blot analysis protocol using a polyclonal anti-GST antibody (Z-5; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The rRNA oligonucleotide (corresponding to the first 40 nucleotides of 35S rRNA) was labeled with 32P at the 5′ end using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England BioLabs). EMSA was performed as described previously (27Hellman L.M. Fried M.G. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1849-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar) with modifications described in detail in the supplemental text. Spt4 and Spt5 form a heterodimer that influences transcription elongation by Pol I (12Schneider D.A. French S.L. Osheim Y.N. Bailey A.O. Vu L. Dodd J. Yates J.R. Beyer A.L. Nomura M. Proc. Natl.

Previously, we observed a physical interaction (co-purification and co-immunoprecipitation) of these proteins with Pol I. To determine whether this association is direct or mediated through a network of other proteins, we tested for binding of Spt5 to Pol I in vitro. We expressed yeast Spt5 with an N-terminal GST tag in E. coli and purified the protein using three affinity steps. Endogenously expressed Pol I bearing an HA tag on the A135 subunit was purified from yeast. These proteins were used to perform a GST pulldown assay in which Spt5 was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose resin and incubated with Pol I. After multiple washes, bound Pol I was detected by Western blot analysis using an anti-HA antibody (12CA5). As a positive control, we included HA-tagged Pol II purified from yeast. Human Pol II has been shown previously to directly bind hSpt5 (22Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Watanabe D. Takagi T. Hasegawa J. Handa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8085-8092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 23Ivanov D. Kwak Y.T. Guo J. Gaynor R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2970-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and as expected (9Hartzog G.A. Wada T. Handa H. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), yeast-derived Pol II directly associated with yeast Spt5 (Fig. 1B). Consistent with our results, the Cramer lab (28Martinez-Rucobo F.W. Sainsbury S. Cheung A.C. Cramer P. EMBO J. 2011; 30: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) has recently shown that recombinant yeast Spt4/5 binds directly to pure Pol II. As for Pol II, we observed specific association of Pol I with GST-Spt5 but not GST-only (Fig. 1B). Thus, Spt5 directly and stably binds to Pol I. To identify the domain(s) of Spt5 that bind to Pol I and/or Pol II, we constructed a series of Spt5 variants fused to GST and purified these constructs from E. coli (Fig. 2, A and B). After three affinity purification steps, these proteins were used in GST pulldown assays with either yeast-derived Pol I or Pol II. After multiple washing steps, the bound polymerases were detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2, C and E). The same regions of Spt5 are required for binding to either Pol I or Pol II (Fig. 2, C and E). The N-terminal region containing the NGN domain (construct B) binds to Pol I, although the amount of polymerase retained on the beads is less than in the presence of the full-length Spt5 (Fig. 2F). Because the first 244 amino acid residues do not bind to polymerases (construct A; Fig. 2, C–E), we conclude that the NGN domain mediates the detected association with Pol I and Pol II. This observation supports the model that the interaction of the NGN domains with RNA polymerases is conserved in all three domains of life (20Hirtreiter A. Damsma G.E. Cheung A.C. Klose D.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 546-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The mutant proteins that contained the central region of Spt5 including the KOW domains and related sequences (e.g. the linkers between the KOW motifs) but that lacked the NGN domain (constructs D and E) also associated with both polymerases (Fig. 2, C and D). However, the binding of these constructs to Pol I was not as robust as for the full-length protein (Fig. 2F). Indeed, binding of both polymerases to Spt5 was more robust when the immobilized construct contained a larger region including the NGN domain and at least two KOW domains (constructs C, G, H, J, and K). These constructs retained as much Pol I or Pol II as full-length Spt5. Therefore, we conclude that unlike bacteria and archaea, in eukaryotes the NGN domain of Spt5 is not sufficient for robust association with RNA polymerases. Instead, the additional sequences, most likely the KOW domains, appear to enhance the association of Spt5 with both Pol I and Pol II. These data demonstrate that the association of Spt5 with RNA polymerases is conserved but apparently more complex in eukaryotes compared with prokaryotes, consistent with the more complex domain structure of eukaryotic Spt5. We have shown that the central region including the NGN and at least two KOW domains is important for robust association of Spt5 with both polymerases in vitro. Recent data demonstrated that the NGN domain and the KOW domains of Spt5 are essential for survival (30Ding B. LeJeune D. Li S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 5317-5326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, because the presence of all four of the KOW domains is not required for binding to Pol I and Pol II in vitro, we predicted that deletion of one or more KOW motifs would not be lethal in yeast. To test our hypothesis and to verify our biochemical data in vivo, we constructed a variety of spt5 mutant strains carrying either C-terminal truncations or an internal deletion of KOW2 (Fig. 3A). These strains were tested for viability under different conditions. We confirmed previously published data that the CTR region of Spt5 is not essential in yeast (31Liu Y. Warfield L. Zhang C. Luo J. Allen J. Lang W.H. Ranish J. Shokat K.M. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 4852-4863Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The mutants spt5(1–930) and spt5(1–886) have mild growth defects at permissive temperatures (30 and 25 °C) and cold-sensitive phenotypes (slow growth at 16 °C) (Fig. 3B and data not shown). Interestingly, deletion of KOW4 together with the CTR deletion (allele spt5(1–797)) is viable. This strain also exhibits mild growth defects at 30 °C (Fig. 3B) and more severe cold sensitivity than spt5(1–930) and spt5(1–886). Spt5 abundance in all three mutant strains was not altered compared with WT (measured by Western blot; data not shown). These results are consistent with our biochemical data showing that the region containing KOW4 and/or CTR is not required for binding of Spt5 to Pol I or Pol II in vitro (Fig. 2). A mutant allele of SPT5 that contains an internal deletion of the KOW2 region (spt5ΔKOW2) is also viable. However, this strain has the most severe phenotype among the described nonlethal spt5 mutants exhibiting very slow growth at 25 °C (Fig. 3B) and lethality at 30 °C. Both spt5ΔKOW2 and spt5(1–797), have one of the KOW domains deleted; however, the phenotype of the spt5ΔKOW2 allele is significantly more severe than that of the spt5(1–797) mutant. We conclude that KOW2 is more critical for Spt5 function than KOW4 and the CTR combined. The observation that spt5(1–797) and spt5ΔKOW2 strains are viable supports our biochemical data indicating that fewer than four KOW domains is sufficient for interaction with RNA polymerases (constructs J, H, and K from Fig. 2). We were not able to isolate cells carrying deletions of two or more KOW domains. Spores carrying spt5(1–582), which lacks the C-terminal region including CTR, KOW4, and KOW3, do not grow at 30 or 25 °C (Fig. 3B). Even expansion of the C-terminal deletion to include the 188-amino acid residue linker between KOW3 and KOW4 (allele spt5(1–610)) is lethal (Fig. 3B). These data are consistent with previously observed lethality of an spt5(1–640) allele (30Ding B. LeJeune D. Li S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 5317-5326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To determine whether these lethal spt5 constructs could still associate with Pol I, we examined their expression and co-immunoprecipitation with the polymerase in heterozygous diploid cells. We did not detect any significant difference in the abundance of these truncated Spt5 proteins compared with the full-length protein when expressed in heterozygous diploids (spt5(1–582)/SPT5 or spt5(1–640)/SPT5; measured by Western blot analysis; data not shown). Moreover, truncated Spt5 expressed in the spt5(1–640)/SPT5 diploid strain was still able to associate with Pol I in co-immunoprecipitation experiments (data not shown), consistent with our in vitro pulldown assays (Fig. 2). These data demonstrate that the lethality of the spt5(1–582) and spt5(1–610) alleles is most likely due to defects in Spt5 function rather than impaired protein folding or defects in the binding of Spt5 to the polymerases. Our analysis of spt5 deletion mutants shows that cells with minor disruption of the region containing KOW domains can survive. However, larger deletions within the KOW domains are lethal. These results support the functional importance of the KOW domains in vivo and are consistent with our in vitro data. Because we have shown that Spt5 physically interacts with Pol I, we wished to determine which subunits of Pol I are involved in the interaction. To do this, we used far Western blot analysis. Blots carrying purified Pol I and Pol II were probed with three different Spt5 constructs fused to GST (Fig. 4A) and with purified GST as a negative control. Binding of the probes was detected using an anti-GST antibody (Fig. 4, B and C). A duplicate lane from the original SDS-PAGE gel was stained with silver nitrate to determine the identity of the polymerase subunits. We detected binding of all three Spt5 probes to the largest subunits of both Pol I and Pol II: A190 and Rpb1 (Fig. 4, B and C). The A190 subunit of Pol I is homologous to Rpb1 and to the β′ subunit of prokaryotic RNA polymerases (32Cramer P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The NGN-like domains in bacteria and archaea are known to bind to the β′ subunit or its homologues (20Hirtreiter A. Damsma G.E.

Thus, the observed interaction between Spt5 and the largest subunit of Pol I is conserved. Two of three Spt5 probes (probes C and D) also associated with three additional Pol I subunits: A135, A49, and A34.5. The third probe (probe F) associated with A135 and A34.5 in addition to A190. Binding of the probe F to the A49 subunit was not detected. Thus, the NGN domain is not sufficient for associat"
https://openalex.org/W2015014955,"The causative agent of anthrax, Bacillus anthracis, is capable of circumventing the humoral and innate immune defense of the host and modulating the blood chemistry in circulation to initiate a productive infection. It has been shown that the pathogen employs a number of strategies against immune cells using secreted pathogenic factors such as toxins. However, interference of B. anthracis with the innate immune system through specific interaction of the spore surface with host proteins such as the complement system has heretofore attracted little attention. In order to assess the mechanisms by which B. anthracis evades the defense system, we employed a proteomic analysis to identify human serum proteins interacting with B. anthracis spores, and found that plasminogen (PLG) is a major surface-bound protein. PLG efficiently bound to spores in a lysine- and exosporium-dependent manner. We identified α-enolase and elongation factor tu as PLG receptors. PLG-bound spores were capable of exhibiting anti-opsonic properties by cleaving C3b molecules in vitro and in rabbit bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, resulting in a decrease in macrophage phagocytosis. Our findings represent a step forward in understanding the mechanisms involved in the evasion of innate immunity by B. anthracis through recruitment of PLG resulting in the enhancement of anti-complement and anti-opsonization properties of the pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2142548510,"The haptic perception of ground compliance is used for stable regulation of dynamic posture and the control of locomotion in diverse natural environments. Although rarely investigated in relation to walking, vibrotactile sensory channels are known to be active in the discrimination of material properties of objects and surfaces through touch. This study investigated how the perception of ground surface compliance is altered by plantar vibration feedback.Subjects walked in shoes over a rigid floor plate that provided plantar vibration feedback, and responded indicating how compliant it felt, either in subjective magnitude or via pairwise comparisons. In one experiment, the compliance of the floor plate was also varied. Results showed that perceived compliance of the plate increased monotonically with vibration feedback intensity, and depended to a lesser extent on the temporal or frequency distribution of the feedback. When both plate stiffness (inverse compliance) and vibration amplitude were manipulated, the effect persisted, with both factors contributing to compliance perception. A significant influence of vibration was observed even for amplitudes close to psychophysical detection thresholds.These findings reveal that vibrotactile sensory channels are highly salient to the perception of surface compliance, and suggest that correlations between vibrotactile sensory information and motor activity may be of broader significance for the control of human locomotion than has been previously acknowledged."

However, post-transcriptional regulation, including mRNA processing, localization, turnover, and translation, add to the complexity and flexibility of gene expression (1Mata J. Marguerat S. Bähler J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 506-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Post-transcriptional control mechanisms of gene expression are dependent on RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), 2The abbreviations used are: RBPRNA-binding proteinBFbloodstream formPFprocyclic formAREAU-rich elementTAPtandem affinity purificationMCPmitochondrial carrier proteinqPCRquantitative PCR. which are ubiquitous and numerous in most eukaryotic genomes (2Glisovic T. Bachorik J.L. Yong J. Dreyfuss G. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). One fundamental aspect of post-transcriptional control of gene expression is, therefore, to define which RNA in a cell is regulated by a particular RBP and the mechanism by which regulation is achieved. The interaction of target RNA and RBP is often reliant on sequence elements in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of the target transcript, and this governs the mechanism of regulation of gene expression either via transcript stability or translational efficiency (3Barreau C. Paillard L. Osborne H.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 7138-7150Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar).

These polycistronic units have genes co-transcribed and subsequently processed by coupled 5′ trans-splicing and 3′ polyadenylation before translation (7Liang X.H. Haritan A. Uliel S. Michaeli S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 830-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Thus, trypanosomes seem to have lost the ability to regulate the initiation of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription, and trypanosome gene expression is regulated primarily at the post-transcriptional level (8Clayton C.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1881-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Processing of mRNA and transport are important parts of the gene expression machinery, which appear largely conserved among eukaryotes but do not seem to represent a major regulatory point in trypanosomes. Published works suggest the main point for controlling gene expression in trypanosomes is at the level of mRNA turnover and translational efficiency (9Hendriks E. Matthews K. Post-transcriptional Control of Gene Expression in African Trypansomes. Horizon Bioscience, U.K.2007: 210-238Google Scholar). Trypanosomes have life cycles in both a mammalian host and an invertebrate vector. Adaptation to these very different environments requires significant alteration in gene expression (10Matthews K.R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 11Matthews K.R. Ellis J.R. Paterou A. Trends Parasitol. 2004; 20: 40-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Consequently, surface protein expression, metabolism changes, and the cytoskeletal alterations that accompany parasite development during the life cycle must all involve post-transcriptional control of gene expression. The major replicative stages of T. brucei are the mammalian bloodstream form (BF) and insect procyclic form (PF). Several studies have been conducted indicating developmental regulation of ∼200–300 transcripts in each life cycle stage (12Jensen B.C. Sivam D. Kifer C.T. Myler P.J. Parsons M. BMC Genomics. 2009; 10: 482Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 13Kabani S. Fenn K. Ross A. Ivens A. Smith T.K. Ghazal P. Matthews K.

BMC Genomics. 2009; 10: 495Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and the differential abundance of specifically enriched BF or PF transcripts are assumed to be governed via mRNA stability (13Kabani S. Fenn K. Ross A. Ivens A. Smith T.K. Ghazal P. Matthews K. BMC Genomics. 2009; 10: 427Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To date very little is known about the RBPs that are involved in regulating target mRNA abundance of developmentally regulated transcripts. Zinc finger proteins are a large superfamily, and they constitute about 1% of many eukaryotic genomes (15Mackay J.P. Crossley M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Zinc finger proteins are categorized according to the nature and spacing of their zinc-chelating residues. Several families of zinc finger proteins, including the C2H2s, CCHCs, and CCCCs, have important functions as transcription factors that regulate a range of biological processes (16Brown R.S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Most zinc finger protein families are, therefore, associated with DNA binding or protein-protein interactions (15Mackay J.P. Crossley M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). However, several investigations have shown CCCH zinc finger proteins (ZC3Hs) to be involved in RNA binding (17Lai W.S. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9606-9613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). ZC3Hs are rare in number in many lower eukaryotes and in mammals (18Liang J. Wang J. Azfer A. Song W. Tromp G. Kolattukudy P.E. Fu M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6337-6346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) but have been found in a variety of organisms ranging from yeast to man (19Wang D. Guo Y. Wu C. Yang G. Li Y. Zheng C. BMC Genomics. 2008; 9: 44Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). RBPs have been shown to regulate mRNA abundance through a number of sequences, most notably AU-rich elements (AREs) found in the 3′-UTR of target transcripts (3Barreau C. Paillard L. Osborne H.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 7138-7150Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 20Blackshear P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Most studies on ZC3Hs have been conducted using the tandem ZC3H protein, tristetraprolin, and ARE-containing transcripts important in immune responses, like TNF-α (21Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have been identified as targets. In all cases where mRNA abundance of a target transcript is altered by a ZC3H, the mechanism of regulation involves destabilization. Some proteins containing variant ZC3H motifs, such as ZAP, have anti-viral properties (22Gao G. Guo X. Goff S.P. Science. 2002; 297: 1703-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Several ZC3Hs from Caenorhabditis elegans have also been shown to be involved in the regulation of development through RNA localization in the cell (23Reese K.J. Dunn M.A. Waddle J.A. Seydoux G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 445-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). There have been studies on three ZC3Hs in trypanosomes (TbZFP1, -2, and -3) (24Hendriks E.F. Matthews K.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 706-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 25Hendriks E.F. Robinson D.R. Hinkins M. Matthews K.R.

Chem. 2006; 281: 39002-39013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Only TbZFP3 has been investigated for a regulatory mechanism and found to control the expression of the variant forms of the insect stage-specific surface protein coat via translational repression rather than transcript stability (27Walrad P. Paterou A. Acosta-Serrano A. Matthews K.R. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000317Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, the ZC3Hs represent a novel and exciting family of RBPs involved in post-transcriptional control of gene expression. This study investigates one member of the T. brucei ZC3Hs, TbZC3H20. TbZC3H20 is shown to bind RNA in vitro and in vivo and is stage-specifically enriched in PF when compared with BF parasites. TbZC3H20 was also found to be required for normal growth of PF parasites. Using a combination of microarray analyses and RNAi, TbZC3H20 was found to control the mRNA abundance of two developmentally regulated transcripts encoding a mitochondrial carrier protein (MCP12) and a trans-sialidase (TS-like E). Here we demonstrate TbZC3H20 is involved in specific stabilization of these mRNAs in PF T. brucei via elements in the 3′-UTR of each transcript. The specific target mRNAs of TbZC3H20 defined in this study are important in the development of T. brucei, and understanding their regulation is a key part in understanding the life cycle of trypanosomes. This study is the first report of a ZC3H regulating a gene encoding a mitochondrial protein and the first to show ZC3Hs can regulate mRNA abundance (stability) as a post-transcriptional mechanism for regulating gene expression in trypanosomes. Most significantly, this work shows ZC3H-dependent stabilization rather than destabilization of a target mRNA, suggesting a broader involvement of ZC3Hs in regulating gene expression than previously thought. Oligonucleotides used in this study are shown in supplemental Table 1. The entire coding region of TbZC3H20 was PCR-amplified from T. brucei genomic DNA (strain 427) using primers that incorporated restriction enzyme sites HindIII and BglII or BglII and EcoRI. The PCR products were cloned first into the pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega) (to create pGEM 20) as described by the manufacturer and then into p2T7i (28LaCount D.J. Barrett B. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17580-17588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) (creating p2T7i 20) for tetracycline (tet)-inducible double-stranded RNA production (RNAi) or the Escherichia coli expression vector pGEX-2T. The pGEM 20 construct was also used to introduce a point mutation from CCCH to CCAH for each zinc finger motif of TbZC3H20. The first CCCH zinc finger motif was mutated (C70A) using the QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the TbZC3H20 CCCH ZFM1 F and TbZC3H20 CCCH ZFM1 R primers (supplemental Table 1) by the manufacturer's recommended protocol. The single site-directed mutant was verified by sequencing and then used in a subsequent round of mutagenesis using the same kit and protocol but with the TbZC3H20 CCCH ZFM2 F and TbZC3H20 CCCH ZFM2 R primers (supplemental Table 1) to introduce the mutation into the second zinc finger motif (C178A). This double site-directed mutant was verified by sequencing and then subcloned into the pGEX2T vector. The pLEW79-TbZC3H20-TAP construct was created as in Panigrahi et al. (29Panigrahi A.K. Schnaufer A. Ernst N.L. Wang B. Carmean N. Salavati R. Stuart K. RNA. 2003; 9: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), except the coding sequence used was that of TbZC3H20. For luciferase reporter assay constructs, the 3′-UTR of MCP12 and TS-like E were PCR-amplified from T. brucei genomic DNA using primers incorporating BamHI and XhoI restriction enzyme sites. PCR products were cloned into pGEM T-easy then subcloned into pGR86 (30Estévez A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 4573-4586Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). BL21 E. coli transformants, cultured in LB plus 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C, and grown to A600 0.4–0.6 were induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and left at 17 °C overnight shaking. After induction the cells were pelleted and resuspended in BugBuster (Novagen). The lysate was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter then applied to a GSTrapFF column (GE Healthcare) previously equilibrated with PBS. The column was then washed with 5 volumes of PBS, and proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl and 10 mm reduced glutathione, pH 8.0. The concentration of eluted protein was quantified by Bradford Assay. To 50 μl of “poly(A)/C/T/G”-Sepharose /agarose beads (Sigma), 500 nmol of GST-purified recombinant TbZC3H20 was added with 20× binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 50 mm sodium chloride final concentrations) and then rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed 4 times in 1 ml of wash buffer (100 mm sodium chloride) with incubations for 10 min at 4 °C. Finally, beads were resuspended in 4× Laemmli buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For Western analysis, proteins were transferred from SDS-PAGE to nitrocellulose by electroblotting. The membrane was blocked in 5% milk with PBS overnight at 4 °C, washed in PBS, and then incubation in the anti-peptide TbZC3H20 antibody for >3 h at 4 °C. The membrane was then washed 3 times in PBS, then incubated with swine anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to HRP (DakoCytomation) at 1:2000 dilution in PBS-Tween (0.1%) for 1 h at 4 °C. The chemiluminescence signal was detected using Pierce® ECL West Femto Western blotting substrate (Thermo Scientific) and captured using a LAS-3000 Fuji imager. Anti-peptide antibodies were produced in rabbits to the TbZC3H20 C-terminal peptide CGTDRGIEKGEGRGRN by Eurogentec. Crude serum was affinity-purified against the peptide (Eurogentec), and this used (1:10) in 1% BSA/PBS for Western analysis. T. brucei PF 29-13 cells and PF WT were cultured in SDM-79 medium containing 15% FBS at 27 °C. PF 29-13 cells had been previously engineered to co-express T7 RNA polymerase and tet repressor (31Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar) and were used to generate PF RNAi lines (29-13 cells). PF transfections were carried out as described in Hendriks et al. (32Hendriks E.F. Abdul-Razak A. Matthews K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26870-26878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were induced for RNAi with 1 μg/ml tet, and the uninduced and induced cells were counted daily with a Z1 Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter). Cells were maintained between 2 × 106 and 2 × 107 cells/ml. Genomic DNA was extracted from stable transfectants as described in Rotureau et al. (55Rotureau B. Gego A. Carme B. Exp. Parasitol. 2005; 111: 207-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Trypanosome RNA was prepared from 1–2 × 108 cells from BF and PF cells, grown in the presence or absence of tet and/or inhibitors (cycloheximide/actinomycin D) when required using the RNeasy kit as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen). RNA concentration was determined using a Nanodrop ND-1000. For Northern analysis 3 μg of RNA was electrophoresed on formaldehyde agarose gels and transferred to nylon membrane by capillary blotting. Blots were hybridized at 65 °C with riboprobes labeled with digoxigenin (Roche Applied Science), and stringency washes were at 65 °C, 0.1× SSC. Blot detection was by chemiluminescence using CDP-star (Roche Applied Science) as a reaction substrate. To quantify the level of transcript in each sample, densitometry of the signal obtained on a FujiFilm LAS-3000 was performed using QuantityONE software. Loading was equalized by the concentration of RNA loaded and signal obtained with tubulin or actin. Measurements for the rate of mRNA turnover in PF T. brucei were performed after treatment of cells with 5 μg′ml−1 actinomycin D for 1, 2, or 4 h. Translational inhibition studies were conducted on samples treated with 50 μg′ml−1 cycloheximide for 1, 2, or 4 h. Untreated samples for both the actinomycin D and cycloheximide transcription and translation analyses were also prepared from PF T. brucei. Primer sequences for qPCR are in supplemental Table 1. qPCR was performed as described previously (33Carnes J. Trotter J.R. Ernst N.L. Steinberg A. Stuart K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 16614-16619Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) using the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). In both RT-PCR and qPCR experiments, RNA was treated with DNase I by using the DNase-free kit (Ambion). Integrity of the DNase I treated RNA was confirmed by using an RNA nanochip on a BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Amplification conditions for qPCR were 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Each mRNA species was analyzed in triplicate. Thermal dissociation and agarose gel electrophoresis confirmed PCR generated a single product of the expected size. Data analysis was carried out by using the Pfaffl method with PCR efficiencies calculated by linear regression with LinRegPCR software (34Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25872) Google Scholar, 35Ramakers C. Ruijter J.M. Deprez R.H. Moorman A.F. Neurosci. Lett. 2003; 339: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2928) Google Scholar). Relative changes for target amplicons were calculated after normalization to β-tubulin mRNA and 18 S rRNA and were expressed as relative mRNA abundance from the respective control cells. To amplify interacting mRNA species with tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tagged TbZC3H20, RT-PCR was used with gene specific oligonucleotides within the coding regions (supplemental Table 1). RT-PCR reactions were performed in a standard thermocycler using TaqDNA polymerase. Amplification conditions were 95 °C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s and 50 °C for 90 s and 90 s at 72 °C. Amplification products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. For the microarray samples, PF29-13 p2T7i TbZC3H20 were grown in the presence or absence of tet for 48 h, and then RNA was isolated from 1–2 × 108 cells using the RNeasy kit as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen). RNA concentration was determined using an ND-1000 NanoDrop spectrophotometer. RNA samples were sent to Oxford Gene Technology Limited for microarray analysis. Three 60-mer gene-specific probes were synthesized for each gene across the T. brucei genome, where each probe was synthesized in situ directly onto each microarray chip. The RNA samples were labeled with Cy3 (green) or Cy5 (red), and each microarray set was carried out in triplicate, with a dye-switch for one of the replicates. Raw data were transformed into Excel spreadsheets (Microsoft Office) for green and red signal comparison (with background signal subtracted) to determine -fold change for each microarray probe. Expression of TbZC3H20-TAP in PF cells was induced for 48 h with tet, and TAP-tagged complexes were purified from 2 liters of cells harvested at a density of 1.5 × 107 cells ml−1. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C at 1300 × g for 10 min, washed in cold PBS with 6 mm glucose, and resuspended in 18 ml of cold IPP150 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Igepal) and 2 ml of 10% Triton-X100. Cells were lysed by rotation at 4 °C for 25 min and then centrifuged at 4 °C at 10,000 × g for 15 min to remove insoluble material. 200 μl of IgG Sepharose beads (“fast-flow,” GE Healthcare) were washed in IPP150 in an Econo-Pac column (Bio-Rad) at 4 °C for 5 min, then the cleared cell lysate was added to the washed column and rotated for 2 h at 4 °C to allow binding. The column was washed 3 times in 10 ml of cold IPP150 and once with 10 ml of cold tobacco etch virus cleavage buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Igepal, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT). The TAP tag was then cleaved by adding 1 ml of tobacco etch virus cleavage buffer and 100 units of tobacco etch virus protease (Invitrogen) and incubated the beads for 2 h at 16 °C. To the tobacco etch virus eluate recovered from the column, 3 volumes of CBB (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Igepal, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm imidazole, 2 mm calcium chloride) and 3 μl of 1 m calcium chloride per ml of eluate was added. 200 μl of calmodulin resin was added to a disposable 5-ml column and washed for 5 min at 4 °C with 5 ml of CBB. The sample was then transferred to the column containing the washed calmodulin resin and rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. The column was washed 5 times with 5 ml of CBB, and then the TbZC3H20-mRNA complexes were eluted with 250 μl of CEB (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Igepal, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm imidazole, 2 mm EGTA). To this recovered eluate, 0.5 ml of TRI Reagent® (Sigma) was added and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Isolation of RNA was then carried out as per the manufacturer's instructions, and the RNA pellet was resuspended in 10 μl of RNase-free water. The entire sample was then DNase-treated and reverse-transcribed as described above. In vitro transcribed RNAs were prepared using DNA templates and either SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase with NTPs at 37 °C for 2 h. RNA EMSA reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained 5 ng of digoxigenin-labeled (UTP) RNA and GST-TbZC3H20, GST TbZC3H20 ZFM mutant, or GST protein (500 nm) as indicated in a binding buffer of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25 mg/ml tRNA, and 0.25 mg/ml BSA. Competition assay reactions contained 500 nm GST-TbZC3H20 and 5 ng of labeled RNA with increasing amounts (ratios 1:0–1:200) of unlabeled competitor RNA. Each reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min with gentle agitation and then prepared for loading with the addition of 1 μl of BluejuiceTM Gel Loading buffer (Invitrogen). The entire mixture was loaded onto a 0.8% agarose gel in TAE buffer and electrophoresed at 25–40 V for 3–6 h. The RNA was then transferred to a nylon membrane by capillary blotting. Blot detection was by chemiluminescence using CDP-star as a reaction substrate, and images were captured by a Fujifilm LAS-3000. GeneDB (36Hertz-Fowler C. Peacock C.S. Wood V. Aslett M. Kerhornou A.

Only one ZC3H, TbZC3H20, was T. brucei-specific with solely conventional ZC3H motifs (37Kramer S. Kimblin N.C. Carrington M. BMC Genomics. 2010; 11: 283Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, as part of analyzing the family of TbZC3Hs, an investigation on TbZC3H20, a ZC3H containing two C7C5C3H motifs (Fig. 1A), was performed. To assess if TbZC3H20 could bind RNA, recombinant TbZC3H20 protein fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) was produced in E. coli and used in an RNA homopolymer binding assay. Heterologous expression of GST-TbU2Af35, a known RBP, and GST-alone were performed as positive and negative controls. Proteins were purified using GST affinity chromatography, and proteins of the expected size (70 kDa for TbZC3H20, 60 kDa for U2AF35, and 26 kDa for GST-alone) were confirmed by SDS-PAGE (not shown). Each protein (500 nmol) was individually allowed to bind polyU or- G or -C or -A linked to Sepharose beads. Protein binding RNA was revealed on SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 1B), showing GST-TbZC3H20-bound homopolymeric RNA, perhaps with a preference for polyG. The GST-TbU2Af35-positive control protein bound RNA as expected, whereas a negative control of GST protein alone did not bind homopolymeric RNA (Fig"
https://openalex.org/W2069627859,"To what degree juvenile migrant birds are able to correct for orientation errors or wind drift is still largely unknown. We studied the orientation of passerines on the Faroe Islands far off the normal migration routes of European migrants. The ability to compensate for displacement was tested in naturally occurring vagrants presumably displaced by wind and in birds experimentally displaced 1100 km from Denmark to the Faroes. The orientation was studied in orientation cages as well as in the free-flying birds after release by tracking departures using small radio transmitters. Both the naturally displaced and the experimentally displaced birds oriented in more easterly directions on the Faroes than was observed in Denmark prior to displacement. This pattern was even more pronounced in departure directions, perhaps because of wind influence. The clear directional compensation found even in experimentally displaced birds indicates that first-year birds can also possess the ability to correct for displacement in some circumstances, possibly involving either some primitive form of true navigation, or 'sign posts', but the cues used for this are highly speculative. We also found some indications of differences between species in the reaction to displacement. Such differences might be involved in the diversity of results reported in displacement studies so far."
https://openalex.org/W2029475270,"We previously demonstrated that protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ; PKC delta) is an oxidative stress-sensitive kinase that plays a causal role in apoptotic cell death in neuronal cells. Although PKCδ activation has been extensively studied, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms controlling PKCδ expression. To characterize the regulation of PKCδ expression, we cloned an ∼2-kbp 5′-promoter segment of the mouse Prkcd gene. Deletion analysis indicated that the noncoding exon 1 region contained multiple Sp sites, including four GC boxes and one CACCC box, which directed the highest levels of transcription in neuronal cells. In addition, an upstream regulatory region containing adjacent repressive and anti-repressive elements with opposing regulatory activities was identified within the region −712 to −560. Detailed mutagenesis studies revealed that each Sp site made a positive contribution to PKCδ promoter expression. Overexpression of Sp family proteins markedly stimulated PKCδ promoter activity without any synergistic transactivating effect. Furthermore, experiments in Sp-deficient SL2 cells indicated long isoform Sp3 as the essential activator of PKCδ transcription. Importantly, both PKCδ promoter activity and endogenous PKCδ expression in NIE115 cells and primary striatal cultures were inhibited by mithramycin A. The results from chromatin immunoprecipitation and gel shift assays further confirmed the functional binding of Sp proteins to the PKCδ promoter. Additionally, we demonstrated that overexpression of p300 or CREB-binding protein increases the PKCδ promoter activity. This stimulatory effect requires intact Sp-binding sites and is independent of p300 histone acetyltransferase activity. Finally, modulation of Sp transcriptional activity or protein level profoundly altered the cell death induced by oxidative insult, demonstrating the functional significance of Sp-dependent PKCδ gene expression.

https://openalex.org/W2032832704,"Dopamine, through D2 receptor (D2R), is the major regulator of lactotrope function in the anterior pituitary gland. Both D2R isoforms, long (D2L) and short (D2S), are expressed in lactotropes. Although both isoforms can transduce dopamine signal, they differ in the mechanism that leads to cell response. The administration of D2R agonists, such as cabergoline, is the main pharmacological treatment for prolactinomas, but resistance to these drugs exists, which has been associated with alterations in D2R expression. We previously reported that dopamine and cabergoline induce apoptosis of lactotropes in primary culture in an estrogen-dependent manner. In this study we used an in vivo model to confirm the permissive action of estradiol in the apoptosis of anterior pituitary cells induced by D2R agonists. Administration of cabergoline to female rats induced apoptosis, measured by Annexin-V staining, in anterior pituitary gland from estradiol-treated rats but not from ovariectomized rats. To evaluate the participation of D2R isoforms in the apoptosis induced by dopamine we used lactotrope-derived PR1 cells stably transfected with expression vectors encoding D2L or D2S receptors. In the presence of estradiol, dopamine induced apoptosis, determined by ELISA and TUNEL assay, only in PR1-D2S cells. To study the role of p38 MAPK in apoptosis induced by D2R activation, anterior pituitary cells from primary culture or PR1-D2S were incubated with an inhibitor of the p38 MAPK pathway (SB203850). SB203580 blocked the apoptotic effect of D2R activation in lactotropes from primary cultures and PR1-D2S cells. Dopamine also induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation, determined by western blot, in PR1-D2S cells and estradiol enhanced this effect. These data suggest that, in the presence of estradiol, D2R agonists induce apoptosis of lactotropes by their interaction with D2S receptors and that p38 MAPK is involved in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2073952570,"Background Despite the decades-long use of Bacillus atrophaeus var. globigii (BG) as a simulant for biological warfare (BW) agents, knowledge of its genome composition is limited. Furthermore, the ability to differentiate signatures of deliberate adaptation and selection from natural variation is lacking for most bacterial agents. We characterized a lineage of BGwith a long history of use as a simulant for BW operations, focusing on classical bacteriological markers, metabolic profiling and whole-genome shotgun sequencing (WGS). Results Archival strains and two “present day” type strains were compared to simulant strains on different laboratory media. Several of the samples produced multiple colony morphotypes that differed from that of an archival isolate. To trace the microevolutionary history of these isolates, we obtained WGS data for several archival and present-day strains and morphotypes. Bacillus-wide phylogenetic analysis identified B. subtilis as the nearest neighbor to B. atrophaeus. The genome of B. atrophaeus is, on average, 86% identical to B. subtilis on the nucleotide level. WGS of variants revealed that several strains were mixed but highly related populations and uncovered a progressive accumulation of mutations among the “military” isolates. Metabolic profiling and microscopic examination of bacterial cultures revealed enhanced growth of “military” isolates on lactate-containing media, and showed that the “military” strains exhibited a hypersporulating phenotype. Conclusions Our analysis revealed the genomic and phenotypic signatures of strain adaptation and deliberate selection for traits that were desirable in a simulant organism. Together, these results demonstrate the power of whole-genome and modern systems-level approaches to characterize microbial lineages to develop and validate forensic markers for strain discrimination and reveal signatures of deliberate adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W1988714897,"International wildlife trade is one of the leading threats to biodiversity conservation. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is the most important initiative to monitor and regulate the international trade of wildlife but its credibility is dependent on the quality of the trade data. We report on the performance of CITES reporting by focussing on the commercial trade in non-native reptiles and amphibians into Thailand as to illustrate trends, species composition and numbers of wild-caught vs. captive-bred specimens.Based on data in the WCMC-CITES trade database, we establish that a total of 75,594 individuals of 169 species of reptiles and amphibians (including 27 globally threatened species) were imported into Thailand in 1990-2007. The majority of individuals (59,895, 79%) were listed as captive-bred and a smaller number (15,699, 21%) as wild-caught. In the 1990s small numbers of individuals of a few species were imported into Thailand, but in 2003 both volumes and species diversity increased rapidly. The proportion of captive-bred animals differed greatly between years (from 0 to >80%). Wild-caught individuals were mainly sourced from African countries, and captive-bred individuals from Asian countries (including from non-CITES Parties). There were significant discrepancies between exports and imports. Thailand reports the import of >10,000 individuals (51 species) originating from Kazakhstan, but Kazakhstan reports no exports of these species. Similar discrepancies, involving smaller numbers (>100 individuals of 9 species), can be seen in the import of reptiles into Thailand via Macao.While there has been an increase in imports of amphibian and reptiles into Thailand, erratic patterns in proportions of captive-bred specimens and volumes suggests either capricious markets or errors in reporting. Large discrepancies with respect to origin point to misreporting or possible violations of the rules and intentions of CITES."
https://openalex.org/W2028067187,"Background Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is used as an animal model for human multiple sclerosis (MS), which is an inflammatory demyelinating autoimmune disease of the central nervous system characterized by activation of Th1 and/or Th17 cells. Human autoimmune diseases can be either exacerbated or suppressed by infectious agents. Recent studies have shown that regulatory T cells play a crucial role in the escape mechanism of Plasmodium spp. both in humans and in experimental models. These cells suppress the Th1 response against the parasite and prevent its elimination. Regulatory T cells have been largely associated with protection or amelioration in several autoimmune diseases, mainly by their capacity to suppress proinflammatory response. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we verified that CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (T regs) generated during malaria infection (6 days after EAE induction) interfere with the evolution of EAE. We observed a positive correlation between the reduction of EAE clinical symptoms and an increase of parasitemia levels. Suppression of the disease was also accompanied by a decrease in the expression of IL-17 and IFN-γ and increases in the expression of IL-10 and TGF-β1 relative to EAE control mice. The adoptive transfer of CD4+CD25+ cells from P. chabaudi-infected mice reduced the clinical evolution of EAE, confirming the role of these T regs. Conclusions/Significance These data corroborate previous findings showing that infections interfere with the prevalence and evolution of autoimmune diseases by inducing regulatory T cells, which regulate EAE in an apparently non-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W1969025179,"The microscopic origin of glass transition, when liquid viscosity changes continuously by more than ten orders of magnitude, is challenging to explain from first principles. Here we describe the detailed derivation and implementation of a Markovian Network model to calculate the shear viscosity of deeply supercooled liquids based on numerical sampling of an atomistic energy landscape, which sheds some light on this transition. Shear stress relaxation is calculated from a master-equation description in which the system follows a transition-state pathway trajectory of hopping among local energy minima separated by activation barriers, which is in turn sampled by a metadynamics-based algorithm. Quantitative connection is established between the temperature variation of the calculated viscosity and the underlying potential energy and inherent stress landscape, showing a different landscape topography or ""terrain"" is needed for low-temperature viscosity (of order 10(7) Pa·s) from that associated with high-temperature viscosity (10(-5) Pa·s). Within this range our results clearly indicate the crossover from an essentially Arrhenius scaling behavior at high temperatures to a low-temperature behavior that is clearly super-Arrhenius (fragile) for a Kob-Andersen model of binary liquid. Experimentally the manifestation of this crossover in atomic dynamics continues to raise questions concerning its fundamental origin. In this context this work explicitly demonstrates that a temperature-dependent ""terrain"" characterizing different parts of the same potential energy surface is sufficient to explain the signature behavior of vitrification, at the same time the notion of a temperature-dependent effective activation barrier is quantified."

Interestingly, when grown on the HF diet, they appeared to be protected against the effects of HF diet as compared to offspring of normally fed dams. The mechanisms involved in the protective effect of maternal HF diet are unclear.We thus investigated the impact of maternal high fat diet on offspring subjected to normal or high palatable diet (P diet) on metabolic and endocrine parameters. We compared offspring born to dams fed P or HF diet. Offspring born to dams fed control or P diet, when fed P diet exhibited a higher body weight, altered hypothalamic leptin sensitivity and metabolic parameters suggesting that maternal P diet has no protective effect on offspring. Whereas, maternal HF diet reduces body weight gain and circulating triglycerides, and ameliorates corpulence index of offspring, even when subjected to P diet. Interestingly, this protective effect is differently expressed in male and female offspring. Male offspring exhibited higher energy expenditure as mirrored by increased hypothalamic UCP-2 and liver AdipoR1/R2 expression, and a profound change in the arcuate nucleus astrocytic organization. In female offspring, the most striking impact of maternal HF diet is the reduced hypothalamic expression of NPY and POMC.HF diet given during gestation and lactation protects, at least partially, offspring from excessive weight gain through several mechanisms depending upon gender including changes in arcuate nucleus astrocytic organization and increased hypothalamic UCP-2 and liver AdipoR1/2 expression in males and reduced hypothalamic expression of NPY and POMC in females. Taken together our results reveal new mechanisms involved in the protective effect of maternal HF diet."
https://openalex.org/W2159581409,"The dentate gyrus is a site of continued neurogenesis in the adult brain. The CA3 region of the hippocampus is the major projection area from the dentate gyrus. CA3 sends reciprocal projections back to the dentate gyrus. Does this imply that CA3 exerts some control over neurogenesis? We studied the effects of lesions of CA3 on neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, and on the ability of fluoxetine to stimulate mitotic activity in the progenitor cells. Unilateral ibotenic-acid generated lesions were made in CA3. Four days later there was no change on the number of either BrdU or Ki67-positive progenitor cells in the dentate gyrus. However, after 15 or 28 days, there was a marked reduction in surviving BrdU-labelled cells on the lesioned side (but no change in Ki-67+ cells). pCREB or Wnt3a did not co-localise with Ki-67 but with NeuN, a marker of mature neurons. Lesions had no effect on the basal expression of either pCREB or Wnt3a. Subcutaneous fluoxetine (10 mg/kg/day) for 14 days increased the number of Ki67+ cells as expected on the control (non-lesioned) side but not on that with a CA3 lesion. Nevertheless, the expected increase in BDNF, pCREB and Wnt3a still occurred on the lesioned side following fluoxetine treatment. Fluoxetine has been reported to decrease the number of ""mature"" calbindin-positive cells in the dentate gyrus; we found this still occurred on the side of a CA3 lesion. We then showed that the expression GAP-43 was reduced in the dentate gyrus on the lesioned side, confirming the existence of a synaptic connection between CA3 and the dentate gyrus. These results show that CA3 has a hitherto unsuspected role in regulating neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the adult rat."
https://openalex.org/W2091193271,"Background The spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus in human remains a global health concern. Heterosubtypic antibody response between seasonal influenza vaccine and potential pandemic influenza virus has important implications for public health. Previous studies by Corti et al. and by Gioia et al. demonstrate that heterosubtypic neutralizing antibodies against the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus can be elicited with a seasonal influenza vaccine in humans. However, whether such response offers immune protection against highly pathogenic H5N1 virus remained to be determined. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, using a sensitive influenza HA (hemagglutinin) and NA (neuraminidase) pseudotype-based neutralization (PN) assay we first confirmed that low levels of heterosubtypic neutralizing antibody response against H5N1 virus were indeed elicited with seasonal influenza vaccine in humans. We then immunized mice with the seasonal influenza vaccine and challenged them with lethal doses of highly pathogenic H5N1 virus. As controls, we immunized mice with homosubtypic H5N1 virus like particles (VLP) or PBS and challenged them with the same H5N1 virus. Here we show that low levels of heterosubtypic neutralizing antibody response were elicited with seasonal influenza vaccine in mice, which were significantly higher than those in PBS control. Among them 2 out of 27 whose immune sera exhibited similar levels of neutralizing antibody response as VLP controls actually survived from highly pathogenic H5N1 virus challenge. Conclusions/Significance Therefore, we conclude that low levels of heterosubtypic neutralizing antibody response are indeed elicited with seasonal influenza vaccine in humans and mice and at certain levels such response offers immune protection against severity of H5N1 virus infection."
https://openalex.org/W1982793548,"Cytokines can be functionally active across species barriers. Bovine IL-10 has an amino acid sequence identity with human IL-10 of 76.8%. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether bovine IL-10 has immunomodulatory activities on human monocytes and dendritic cells. Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from healthy donors, and used directly or allowed to differentiate to dendritic cells under the influence of IL-4 and GM-CSF. Recombinant bovine IL-10 inhibited TLR induced activation of monocytes, and dose-dependently inhibited LPS-induced activation of monocyte-derived DCs comparable to human IL-10. By using blocking antibodies to either bovine IL-10 or the human IL-10 receptor it was demonstrated that inhibition of monocyte activation by bovine IL-10 was dependent on binding of bovine IL-10 to the human IL-10R. These data demonstrate that bovine IL-10 potently inhibits the activation of human myeloid cells in response to TLR activation. Bovine IL-10 present in dairy products may thus potentially contribute to the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis and allergy, enhance mucosal tolerance induction and decrease intestinal inflammation and may therefore be applicable in infant foods and in immunomodulatory diets."
https://openalex.org/W2050206490,"Adults born preterm with very low birth weight (VLBW; < 1500 g) have higher levels of cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors than their counterparts born at term. Resting energy expenditure (REE) could be one factor contributing to, or protecting from, these risks. We studied the effects of premature birth with VLBW on REE.We used indirect calorimetry to measure REE and dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to measure lean body mass (LBM) in 116 VLBW and in 118 term-born control individuals (mean age: 22.5 years, SD 2.2) participating in a cohort study. Compared with controls VLBW adults had 6.3% lower REE (95% CI 3.2, 9.3) adjusted for age and sex, but 6.1% higher REE/LBM ratio (95% CI 3.4, 8.6). These differences remained similar when further adjusted for parental education, daily smoking, body fat percentage and self-reported leisure time exercise intensity, duration and frequency.Adults born prematurely with very low birth weight have higher resting energy expenditure per unit lean body mass than their peers born at term. This is not explained by differences in childhood socio-economic status, current fat percentage, smoking or leisure time physical activity. Presence of metabolically more active tissue could protect people with very low birth weight from obesity and subsequent risk of chronic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2050045900,"Small non-coding micro-RNAs (miRNA) are important post-transcriptional regulators of mammalian gene expression that can be used to direct the knockdown of expression from targeted genes. We examined whether DNA vaccine vectors co-expressing miRNA with HIV-1 envelope (Env) antigens could influence the magnitude or quality of the immune responses to Env in mice. Human miR-155 and flanking regions from the non-protein encoding gene mirhg155 were introduced into an artificial intron within an expression vector for HIV-1 Env gp140. Using the miR-155-expressing intron as a scaffold, we developed novel vectors for miRNA-mediated targeting of the cellular antiviral proteins PKR and PERK, which significantly down-modulated target gene expression and led to increased Env expression in vitro. Finally, vaccinating BALB/c mice with a DNA vaccine vector delivering miRNA targeting PERK, but not PKR, was able to augment the generation of Env-specific T-cell immunity. This study provides proof-of-concept evidence that miRNA effectors incorporated into vaccine constructs can positively influence vaccine immunogenicity. Further testing of vaccine-encoded miRNA will determine if such strategies can enhance protective efficacy from vaccines against HIV-1 for eventual human use."
https://openalex.org/W1998440406,"Here, we demonstrate that troglitazone (Rezulin), a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonist, acted in synergy with heregulin to induce massive cell death in breast cancer cells. Although the combination of heregulin and troglitazone (HRG/TGZ) induced both apoptosis and necrosis, the main mode of cell death was caspase-independent and occurred via necrosis. This combination increased generation of superoxide in mitochondria, which in turn destabilized mitochondria potential. Pretreatment with N-acetyl-l-cysteine and catalase expression ameliorated cell death induced by the combination treatment, indicating a role of oxidative stress in mediating HRG/TGZ-induced cell death.

The activation of the HRG signaling axis has been considered as a poor prognostic factor in breast cancer and confers resistance to gefitinib (Iressa) and tamoxifen. However, our data presented here paradoxically suggest that HRG expression can actually be beneficial when it comes to treating breast cancer with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ ligands.

Breast cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death, accounting for one in three of all cancer cases diagnosed in women. Although overall survival continues to improve for breast cancer, intrinsic or acquired therapy resistance has been an ongoing obstacle to reducing overall breast cancer mortality. Combining different drugs is now widely used to overcome the problem of therapy resistance. Combination therapy often increases the likelihood of response, and in ideal combination may even be synergistic rather than simply additive. In addition, by keeping each drug at low dose, there can be the potential advantages of longer duration of action and less side effects. Heregulin (HRG), 2The abbreviations used are: HRG, heregulin; TGZ, troglitazone; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; PPAR, peroxisome proliferators activated receptor; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; ROS, reactive oxygen species; PPRE, PPAR response element; 3-MA, 3-methyladenine; MePyr, methyl pyruvate; NaPyr, sodium pyruvate; PI, propidium iodide; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. also known as neuregulin or neu differentiation factor, is a soluble secreted growth factor. The HRG gene family consists of four members, HRG-1, HRG-2, HRG-3, and HRG-4, of which a multitude of different isoforms are synthesized by alternative exon splicing (1Le X.F. Varela C.R. Bast Jr., R.C. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). HRG binds to HER3 receptors or HER4 receptors, or both, resulting in the formation of receptor homo- and heterodimerization. In mammary epithelial cells, HRG predominantly uses HER2 and HER3 dimers. Upon engagement of HRG with the heregulin extracellular domain, multiple signaling pathways, such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, RAS/MAPK, and JNK pathways, are activated. To date, most studies have shown that HRG exhibits a growth-stimulatory effect in a variety of cancer cells, including breast cancer cells. Several lines of evidence implicated activation of human epidermal growth factor receptors by HRG as a primary driver of malignancy (2Lupu R. Cardillo M. Cho C. Harris L. Hijazi M. Perez C. Rosenberg K. Yang D. Tang C. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1996; 38: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 3Vadlamudi R. Adam L. Tseng B. Costa L. Kumar R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2843-2846PubMed Google Scholar, 4Xu F. Yu Y. Le X.F. Boyer C. Mills G.B. Bast Jr., R.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 3653-3660PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of HER-3 by HRG is also involved in resistance to current EGF receptor-targeted therapies (5Hutcheson I.R. Knowlden J.M. Hiscox S.E. Barrow D. Gee J.M. Robertson J.F. Ellis I.O. Nicholson R.I. Breast Cancer Res. 2007; 9: R50Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HRG induces the progression of breast cancer cells to more resistance to anti-estrogenic therapy and to a more aggressive phenotype (6Atlas E. Cardillo M. Mehmi I. Zahedkargaran H. Tang C. Lupu R. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 165-175PubMed Google Scholar). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) belong to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily and are implicated in the pathology of numerous diseases, including obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and cancer (7Michalik L. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). PPARs consist of α, β, and γ subtypes. Among PPARs, PPARγ is of particular interest, because it is expressed in many human cancers and plays key roles in the proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of cancer cells. Accordingly, PPAR activation in cancer has been intensively studied. Recent studies have shown that ligand activation of the PPARγ receptor causes growth inhibition by inducing the differentiation or apoptosis of various human cancer cells (8Yoshizawa K. Cioca D.P. Kawa S. Tanaka E. Kiyosawa K. Cancer. 2002; 95: 2243-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Breast cancer cells often express prominent levels of PPARγ (9Mueller E. Sarraf P. Tontonoz P. Evans R.M. Martin K.J. Zhang M. Fletcher C. Singer S. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 465-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar), and mice with germ line deletion of PPAR (PPAR+/−) have a greater susceptibility to breast cancer (10Nicol C.J. Yoon M. Ward J.M. Yamashita M. Fukamachi K. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Carcinogenesis. 2004; 25: 1747-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), suggesting a strong causal link between PPARγ and progression of breast cancer. Among PPARγ ligands, troglitazone (Rezulin, Resulin, or Romozin) (TGZ), the most extensively studied compound, shows anti-tumorigenic effects in human breast cancer cells (9Mueller E. Sarraf P.

Williamson E. Patel M.K. Koeffler H.P. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 418-423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TGZ also exerts its anti-tumorigenic effects in colon cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro (12Sarraf P. Mueller E. Jones D. King F.J. DeAngelo D.J. Partridge J.B. Holden S.A. Chen L.B. Singer S. Fletcher C. Spiegelman B.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1046-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). However, there have been some apparently contradictory observations in which TGZ treatment increases the number of precancerous polyps in the colon in Apc mutant mice compared with untreated ones (13Saez E. Tontonoz P. Nelson M.C. Alvarez J.G. Ming U.T. Baird S.M. Thomazy V.A. Evans R.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1058-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 14Lefebvre A.M. Chen I. Desreumaux P. Najib J. Fruchart J.C. Geboes K. Briggs M. Heyman R. Auwerx J. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). It was also reported that activation of PPARγ signaling enhances mammary tumorigenesis via activation of Wnt signaling (15Saez E. Rosenfeld J. Livolsi A. Olson P. Lombardo E. Nelson M. Banayo E. Cardiff R.D. Izpisua-Belmonte J.C. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 528-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TGZ has been shown to stimulate growth of osteosarcoma (16Lucarelli E. Sangiorgi L. Maini V. Lattanzi G. Marmiroli S. Reggiani M. Mordenti M. Alessandra Gobbi G. Scrimieri F. Zambon Bertoja A. Picci P. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 98: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggesting that TGZ can trigger both stimulatory and inhibitory effects depending on the cell- and tissue-specific context (7Michalik L. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Although there have been trials with the use of PPARγ agonists in the treatment of cancer, such treatment was not successful as a monotherapy in breast (17Burstein H.J. Demetri G.D. Mueller E. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Winer E.P. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2003; 79: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and colorectal cancer (18Kulke M.H. Demetri G.D. Sharpless N.E. Ryan D.P. Shivdasani R. Clark J.S. Spiegelman B.M. Kim H. Mayer R.J. Fuchs C.S. Cancer J. 2002; 8: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In a recent study by Girnun et al. (19Girnun G.D. Naseri E. Vafai S.B. Qu L. Szwaya J.D. Bronson R. Alberta J.A. Spiegelman B.M. Cancer Cell. 2007; 11: 395-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), combining a platinum-based drug, carboplatin, with PPARγ ligands is showing highly promising results in inhibition of lung, colon, and ovarian cancer cell growth. However, platinum-based drugs, including carboplatin, are not normally used to treat breast cancer (20Kelland L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (3667) Google Scholar), although there is an ongoing trial using platinum-based therapy in triple-negative breast cancer patients who do not harbor a BRCA1 mutation (21Sirohi B. Arnedos M. Popat S. Ashley S. Nerurkar A. Walsh G. Johnston S. Smith I.E. Ann. Oncol. 2008; 19: 1847-1852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). TGZ, although it is one of the most extensively studied PPARγ agonists, has recently been withdrawn from clinical trials because of its hepatocyte toxicity. Rosiglitazone (Avandia), another PPARγ agonist, is still on the market, but the cardiovascular safety of rosiglitazone is currently the subject of vigorous debate, necessitating further efforts to minimize its side effects. Hence, there is a compelling need to seek alternative combinatorial therapies to target breast cancer with PPARγ ligands. Both HRG and TGZ have been found to exert not only inhibitory but also stimulatory effects on breast cancer cell growth. In this study, we demonstrate that these two-faced molecules, when combined, exert a pronounced synergy on cell death in breast cancer cells. We also explore molecular mechanisms by which these two compounds synergistically induce cell death in breast cancer cells.

Polyclonal anti-LC3 antibody was purchased from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO). Polyclonal anti-ATG7 antibody was obtained from Sigma. The human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, SKBR-3, and MDA-MB-453 were grown in complete medium, containing DMEM, McCoy5A, and RPMI 1640, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). MCF-10A cell line was grown in DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% horse serum 20 ng/ml EGF (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), 100 ng/ml cholera toxin (Sigma), and 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma). Unless otherwise stated, cells were grown to ∼60% confluence, serum-starved overnight, and then treated with heregulin β-1 (100 ng/ml) and/or troglitazone (10 μm). When N-acetylcysteine, kinase inhibitors, or PPARγ antagonist were used, cells were pretreated with these reagents for 1 h before the addition of heregulin and/or troglitazone. MCF-7 cell line was infected with adenoviral vectors containing by human catalase for 4 h before heregulin and/or troglitazone treatment. The human catalase-expressing adenovirus was further purified and concentrated by Vivapure AdenoPACK (purchased from Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany). MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with PPRE-luciferase reporter construct as well as pRL-SV40 Renilla internal control plasmid. After 16 h of transfection, cells were treated as indicated in the figure legends for another 24 h. Luciferase assay was performed 48 h after the transfection. Luciferase activity was normalized with control Renilla luciferase expression. Normalized luciferase activities of treated cells were expressed as fold increase compared with the untreated cells transfected with the same plasmid, arbitrarily set at 1. Experiments were done in duplicate, and the standard deviation was indicated. Apoptosis was measured by the quantification of the histone-complexed DNA fragments (mono- and oligonucleosomes) by ELISA (Roche Applied Science). Lysates from cells treated similarly to those described above were analyzed. The level of mono- and oligonucleosomes released into the cytoplasm was measured at 405 nm against reference wavelength (460 nm). Enrichment factor was calculated as the ratio of the sample cells to the absorbance of control cells as described previously (22Kulms D. Pöppelmann B. Yarosh D. Luger T.A. Krutmann J. Schwarz T.

To assess apoptosis and necrosis, cells were stained with YO-PRO-1 and PI as directed by the manufacturer (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and analyzed by flow cytometry (24Blanchard F. Rusiniak M.E.

Baaijens F.P. Bouten C.V. Cytotechnology. 2004; 46: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial ROS levels were quantified as described by the manufacturer. MCF-7 cells were seeded into 6-well plates and cultured overnight followed by serum starvation. The cells were then incubated with heregulin-β1 and/or troglitazone for the indicated periods of time. Before harvesting, cells were incubated with MitoSOX (final concentration, 5 μm) for 10 min. Cells were washed with PBS, collected, and kept on ice in the dark for immediate detection with a flow cytometer (Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer). For measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential, the mitochondrial membrane potential detection kit was used as instructed by the manufacturer (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). Cells were treated as above and incubated with 10 μg/ml JC-1 for 10 min, and then fluorescence was measured on a flow cytometer using FL1 and FL2 channels. Electron microscopy was performed as described previously (26Han J. Hou W. Goldstein L.A. Lu C. Stolz D.B. Yin X.M. Rabinowich H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19665-19677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Briefly, MCF-7 cells grown in tissue culture dishes and treated as above were fixed with 2.0% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% EM grade glutaraldehyde in PBS. After fixation, samples were dehydrated in a graded series of ethyl alcohol and embedded. Ultrathin sections of samples were placed on copper grids and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Sections were examined under a JEM 1011CX electron microscope (JEOL, Peabody, MA). MCF-7 cells were seeded onto coverslips in 6-well plates to obtain ∼60% confluence and then treated as described above. The cells were then incubated with anti-phospho-H2AX (Ser-139) mouse monoclonal antibody at room temperature for 1 h followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). Cells were then stained with DAPI (Molecular Probes Inc.). Cells were co-stained with antibodies to LC3, cytokeratin, and DAPI. Autophagy was quantified by counting the cells showing accumulation of LC3 puncta as described previously (27Uehara N. Matsuoka Y. Tsubura A. Mol. Cancer Res. 2008; 6: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Images were captured using a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescent microscope with Plan-NeoFluar 63×/1.25 oil lens and a CoolSnapPro (Media Cybernetics) digital camera with associated software. ATP levels were measured using a luminescence ATP detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luminescence was measured using Wallac microplate luminescence reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as counts/s and normalized to total protein concentration for each sample. The relative ATP level was calculated by dividing the counts/s of the treated samples by that of the control samples. MCF-7 cells were transfected with 100 nm pooled small interference RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotide (SMART pool) against ATG7 (obtained from Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) or with 100 nm nontargeting siRNA (siGENOME 5, Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) by Dharmafect I (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The knockdown effect was examined by Western blot. Both HRG and TGZ are well known differentiation-inducing factors in breast cancer cells. In agreement, HRG or TGZ alone induced differentiation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, as determined by Oil Red O staining. However, combinatorial treatment with HRG and TGZ (HRG/TGZ) did not increase the extent of differentiation, compared with either HRG or TGZ alone (data not shown). Rather, HRG/TGZ treatment led to a significant cell death, as shown in Fig. 1a. To measure the extent of cell death, MCF-7 cells were stained by PI and assessed by flow cytometry. HRG alone and TGZ alone induced cell death at 48 h of treatment, but their effects were modest. However, when HRG and TGZ were combined, this markedly increased cell death at 48 h of treatment (Fig. 1b) and led to virtually complete cell death at 72 h of treatment (data not shown). PARP has been widely used as an early indicator of apoptotic cell death, and its cleaved protein (89 kDa) is correlated with the extent of apoptotic cell death. As shown in Fig. 1c, compared with samples from control, TGZ alone, or HRG alone, HRG/TGZ treatment resulted in an increase in the ratio of cleaved to uncleaved PARP. To test whether the effect of HRG/TGZ on MCF-7 cells was not a cell line-specific effect, we assessed how other breast cancer cell lines respond to HRG/TGZ treatment. Apoptotic cell death was measured by the quantitative detection of mono- and oligonucleosomes (histone-associated DNA fragments) in the cytoplasmic fraction of cell lysates by ELISA. Combinatory treatment of TGZ and HRG significantly increased apoptotic cell death in both SKBR-3 and MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells as compared with either alone (Fig. 1d), suggesting that HRG/TGZ-induced apoptosis is not a cell line-specific phenomenon. Notably, although MCF-10A cell (normal-like diploid human breast epithelial cell line) was highly sensitive to TGZ alone as reported previously (28Sun H. Berquin I.M. Edwards I.J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4442-4447Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), it displayed a significant resistance to HRG/TGZ-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1e). HRG activates a vast number of signal transduction pathways. Among these pathways, we focused AKT, ERK, p38 MAPK, and JNK, which are known to regulate proliferation and apoptosis of breast cancer cells. HRG alone and HRG/TGZ induced a transient increase in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, JNK, AKT and ERK in MCF-7 cells, with a peak activation occurring at 5 min (Fig. 2a). Compared with HRG alone, HRG/TGZ treatment sustained these activations over longer periods of time. Of note, HRG/TGZ treatment significantly augmented the late phase p38 MAPK activation compared with either TGZ or HRG alone (Fig. 2a). It has been previously documented that the late phase of p38 MAPK activation followed by HRG treatment is correlated with HRG-induced apoptotic cell death in breast cancer (29Daly J.M. Olayioye M.A. Wong A.M. Neve R. Lane H.A. Maurer F.G. Hynes N.E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3440-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This suggests that the observed cell death in HRG/TGZ-treated cells might be attributed to the augmented late phase p38 MAPK activation. The kinetics of AKT, ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK activation in MDA-MB-453 and SKBR-3 cells were also comparable with that of MCF-7 cells, although the late phase p38 MAPK activation was observed at earlier time points in these cells compared with MCF-7 cells (data not shown). To further elucidate which signaling pathways mediate HRG/TGZ-induced apoptotic cell death, we examined the effect of various chemical inhibitors on HRG/TGZ-induced apoptosis. Pretreatment with PI3K/AKT inhibitor (LY 294002), JNK inhibitor (SP 600125), or MEK/ERK inhibitor (U1026) did not exert any protective effects against HRG/TGZ-induced apoptosis (data not shown). In contrast, p38 MAPK inhibitor SB 203580 decreased HRG/TGZ-induced apoptosis by about 35–40% (Fig. 2b), suggesting that p38 MAPK signaling is linked in part to HRG/TGZ-induced apoptosis. We next determined the effects of the early and late phase of p38 MAPK activation on HRG/TGZ-induced apoptosis. Blocking the early phase of p38 MAPK activity (SB 203580 was retrieved before the onset of the late phase activation) provided only modest protection from HRG/TGZ-induced apoptosis, as determined by PARP cleavage (Fig. 2c). SB 203580 is a reversible inhibitor (30Mackay K. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6272-6279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Therefore, even after the early phase p38 MAPK activation was inhibited by SB 203580, the late phase p38 MAPK activity was still fully reversible upon removal of the inhibitor as shown in Fig. 2c (right lane, middle panel). Contrary to the early phase blockade, blocking of the late phase p38 MAPK activation significantly reduced the extent of HRG/TGZ-induced PARP cleavage (Fig. 2c, top panel, middle lane), suggesting that the late phase of p38 MAPK activity plays a more significant role than the early phase activation in HRG/TGZ-induced apoptosis. PPARγ activation plays a major role in apoptosis in cancer cells. To investigate whether HRG/TGZ induces synergistic activation of the PPARγ receptor and thus triggers apoptosis, we assessed PPARγ activity using PPRE luciferase reporter construct. The combination of TGZ and HRG could stimulate the promoter activity to a higher level compared with TGZ or HRG alone (Fig. 2d). However, increased PPARγ activity did not correlate with HRG/TGZ-induced apoptosis, because pretreatment of GW9662, a potent antagonist of PPARγ, did not alter the extent of apoptotic cell death induced by HRG/TGZ (data not shown). Although HRG/TGZ treatment enhanced PPARγ activity also in MDA-MB-453 and SKBR-3 cells, GW9662 was not able to rescue these cells either (data not shown). As such, these data suggest that HRG/TGZ exerts its action through PPARγ-independent pathways. Given the central role of caspases in mediating apoptosis, we tested whether a pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk, could prevent or attenuate HRG/TGZ-induced cell death. Z-VAD-fmk efficiently blocked HRG/TGZ-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3a), as determined by nuclear fragmentation. However, a major portion of HRG/TGZ-treated cells still underwent cell death, suggesting that nonapoptotic/necrotic mechanisms contribute to the HRG/TGZ-induced cell death. To assess the extent of apoptosis and necrosis caused by HRG/TGZ treatment, HRG/TGZ-treated cells were stained with PI and YO-PRO-1. Viable cells with intact membrane exclude both dyes (live cells, YO-PRO-1−, and PI−), whereas apoptotic cells are permeable to YO-PRO-1, yet remain impermeable to PI (YO-PRO-1+, PI−) (31Martin G. Sabido O. Durand P. Levy R. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 71: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, necrotic (or late apoptotic) cells lose membrane integrity and become PI-positive. HRG/TGZ induced both apoptotic and necrotic cell death, but mostly through the necrotic (62%) rather than the apoptotic (13%) pathway (Fig. 3b, left panel). Necrotic cell death can be better defined by electron microscopy. The majority of the HRG/TGZ-treated cells displayed typical changes associated with necrotic cell death, such as discontinuities in plasma membrane, multiple large vacuoles, and leakage of cellular contents (Fig. 3c, left panel). The percentages of apoptosis- and necrosis-like cells based on electron microscopic determination were comparable (Fig. 3c, right panel) with those obtained using YO-PRO-1/PI staining. Furthermore, IM-54, a selective inhibitor of oxidative stress-induced necrotic cell death, substantially reduced HRG/TGZ-induced cell death (supplemental Fig. 1), supporting the notion that HRG/TGZ-induced cell death occurred primarily through necrosis. Notably, pretreatment of methyl pyruvate significantly reduced the extent of HRG/TGZ-induced necrosis (from 62 to 31%) with minimal impact on HRG/TGZ-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3b, middle panel), suggesting that HRG/TGZ-induced cell death is associated with metabolic stress. A comparable protective effect was also achieved with sodium pyruvate (HRG/TGZ + NaPyr) (data not shown). Of note, HRG/TGZ treatment resulted in marked depletion of cellular ATP levels compared with untreated cells (Fig. 3d). In contrast, supplementation of MePyr or NaPyr prevented HRG/TGZ-induced depletion of cellular ATP (Fig. 3d). These results suggest that pyruvate rescues the low energy status of HRG/TGZ-treated cells, further supporting the hypothesis that HRG/TGZ-induced cell death is mainly caused by metabolic stress. Low ATP concentration pushes the cell into necrotic cell death (11Mehta R.G. Williamson E. Patel M.K. Koeffler H.P. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 418-423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Saez E. Rosenfeld J. Livolsi A. Olson P. Lombardo E. Nelson M. Banayo E. Cardiff R.D. Izpisua-Belmonte J.C. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 528-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the major type of cell death observed in HRG/TGZ-treated cells. The medium in the HRG/TGZ-treated wells precipitously turned yellow with a concomitant drop in pH (Fig. 3e) before the onset of cell death, reinforcing the causal association between HRG/TGZ-induced cell death and metabolic stress. Meanwhile, 3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor (HRG/TGZ + 3-MA), showed only modest effects on HRG/TGZ-induced necrosis (from 62 to 69%) (Fig. 3b, right panel). Mitochondria play a major role in cellular energy metabolism, and metabolic stress can induce mitochondrial dysfunction (32Lin M.T. Beal M.F. Nature. 2006; 443: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (4642) Google Scholar). To test whether HRG/TGZ-induced cell death was associated with mitochondrial function, a change in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψm) was assessed by flow cytometric assessment of JC-1. JC-1 offers more reliable staining than rhodamines and other carbocyanines, because it can selectively enter into mitochondria (33Power C.P. Wang J.H. Manning B. Kell M.R. Aherne N.J. Aherne N.F. Wu Q.D. Redmond H.P. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 5229-5237Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). HRG alone had a slightly protective effect on Δψm, whereas TGZ alone destabilized Δψm (Fig. 4a). The combined treatment (HRG/TGZ) resulted in a further reduction in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential as indicated by a marked shift in JC-1 fluorescence (Fig. 4a). ROS are postulated to be a common trigger for mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, we asked whether HRG/TGZ treat"
https://openalex.org/W2006276883,"The use of fenfluramines can increase the risk of developing pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in humans, but the mechanisms responsible are unresolved. A recent study reported that female mice lacking the gene for tryptophan hydroxylase-1 (Tph1(−/−) mice) were protected from PAH caused by chronic dexfenfluramine, suggesting a pivotal role for peripheral serotonin (5-HT) in the disease process. Here we tested two alternative hypotheses which might explain the lack of dexfenfluramine-induced PAH in Tph1(−/−) mice. We postulated that: 1) Tph1(−/−) mice express lower levels of pulmonary 5-HT transporter (SERT) when compared to wild-type controls, and 2) Tph1(−/−) mice display adaptive changes in the expression of non-serotonergic pulmonary genes which are implicated in PAH. SERT was measured using radioligand binding methods, whereas gene expression was measured using microarrays followed by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). Contrary to our first hypothesis, the number of pulmonary SERT sites was modestly up-regulated in female Tph1(−/−) mice. The expression of 51 distinct genes was significantly altered in the lungs of female Tph1(−/−) mice. Consistent with our second hypothesis, qRT-PCR confirmed that at least three genes implicated in the pathogenesis of PAH were markedly up-regulated: Has2, Hapln3 and Retlna. The finding that female Tph1(−/−) mice are protected from dexfenfluramine-induced PAH could be related to compensatory changes in pulmonary gene expression, in addition to reductions in peripheral 5-HT. These observations emphasize the intrinsic limitation of interpreting data from studies conducted in transgenic mice that are not fully characterized."
https://openalex.org/W2086727836,"Ion Channel-Coupled Receptors (ICCRs) are artificial proteins comprised of a G protein-coupled receptor and a fused ion channel, engineered to couple channel gating to ligand binding. These novel biological objects have potential use in drug screening and functional characterization, in addition to providing new tools in the synthetic biology repertoire as synthetic K+-selective ligand-gated channels. The ICCR concept was previously validated with fusion proteins between the K+ channel Kir6.2 and muscarinic M2 or dopaminergic D2 receptors. Here, we extend the concept to the distinct, longer β2-adrenergic receptor which, unlike M2 and D2 receptors, displayed barely detectable surface expression in our Xenopus oocyte expression system and did not couple to Kir6.2 when unmodified. Here, we show that a Kir6.2-binding protein, the N-terminal transmembrane domain of the sulfonylurea receptor, can greatly increase plasma membrane expression of β2 constructs. We then demonstrate how engineering of both receptor and channel can produce β2-Kir6.2 ICCRs. Specifically, removal of 62–72 residues from the cytoplasmic C-terminus of the receptor was required to enable coupling, suggesting that ligand-dependent conformational changes do not efficiently propagate to the distal C-terminus. Characterization of the β2 ICCRs demonstrated that full and partial agonists had the same coupling efficacy, that an inverse agonist had no effect and that the stabilizing mutation E122 W reduced agonist-induced coupling efficacy without affecting affinity. Because the ICCRs are expected to report motions of the receptor C-terminus, these results provide novel insights into the conformational dynamics of the β2 receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2041847173,"Solid tumors are composed of cancerous cells and non-cancerous stroma. A better understanding of the tumor stroma could lead to new therapeutic applications. However, the exact compositions and functions of the tumor stroma are still largely unknown. Here, using a Lewis lung carcinoma implantation mouse model, we examined the hematopoietic compartments in tumor stroma and tumor-bearing mice. Different lineages of differentiated hematopoietic cells existed in tumor stroma with the percentage of myeloid cells increasing and the percentage of lymphoid and erythroid cells decreasing over time. Using bone marrow reconstitution analysis, we showed that the tumor stroma also contained functional hematopoietic stem cells. All hematopoietic cells in the tumor stroma originated from bone marrow. In the bone marrow and peripheral blood of tumor-bearing mice, myeloid populations increased and lymphoid and erythroid populations decreased and numbers of hematopoietic stem cells markedly increased with time. To investigate the function of hematopoietic cells in tumor stroma, we co-implanted various types of hematopoietic cells with cancer cells. We found that total hematopoietic cells in the tumor stroma promoted tumor development. Furthermore, the growth of the primary implanted Lewis lung carcinomas and their metastasis were significantly decreased in mice reconstituted with IGF type I receptor-deficient hematopoietic stem cells, indicating that IGF signaling in the hematopoietic tumor stroma supports tumor outgrowth. These results reveal that hematopoietic cells in the tumor stroma regulate tumor development and that tumor progression significantly alters the host hematopoietic compartment."
https://openalex.org/W2065287966,"Objectives To determine the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, in three groups of Peruvian adults, using fasting glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C). Methodology/Principal Findings This study included adults from the PERU MIGRANT Study who had fasted ≥8 h. Fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL and A1C≥6.5% were used, separately, to define diabetes. Subjects with a current diagnosis of diabetes were excluded. 964 of 988 subjects were included in this analysis. Overall, 0.9% (95%CI 0.3–1.5) and 3.5% (95%CI 2.4–4.7) had diabetes using fasting glucose and A1C criteria, respectively. Compared to those classified as having diabetes using fasting glucose, newly classified subjects with diabetes using A1C (n = 25), were older, poorer, thinner and more likely to come from rural areas. Of these, 40% (10/25) had impaired fasting glucose (IFG). Conclusions This study shows that the use of A1C as diagnostic criteria for type 2 diabetes mellitus identifies people of different characteristics than fasting glucose. In the PERU MIGRANT population using A1C to define diabetes tripled the prevalence; the increase was more marked among poorer and rural populations. More than half the newly diagnosed people with diabetes using A1C had normal fasting glucose."
https://openalex.org/W2042933746,"Background We describe the identification of, and risk factors for, the single most prevalent Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain in the West Midlands region of the UK. Methodology/Principal Findings Prospective 15-locus MIRU-VNTR genotyping of all M. tuberculosis isolates in the West Midlands between 2004 and 2008 was undertaken. Two retrospective epidemiological investigations were also undertaken using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis. The first study of all TB patients in the West Midlands between 2004 and 2008 identified a single prevalent strain in each of the study years (total 155/3,056 (5%) isolates). This prevalent MIRU-VNTR profile (32333 2432515314 434443183) remained clustered after typing with an additional 9-loci MIRU-VNTR and spoligotyping. The majority of these patients (122/155, 79%) resided in three major cities located within a 40 km radius. From the apparent geographical restriction, we have named this the “Mercian” strain. A multivariate analysis of all TB patients in the West Midlands identified that infection with a Mercian strain was significantly associated with being UK-born (OR = 9.03, 95%CI = 4.56–17.87, p<0.01), Black Caribbean (OR = 5.68, 95%CI = 2.96–10.91, p<0.01) resident in Wolverhampton (OR = 9.29, 95%CI = 5.69–15.19, p<0.01) and negatively associated with age >65 years old (OR = 0.25, 95%CI = 0.09–0.67, p<0.01). A second more detailed investigation analyzed a cohort of 82 patients resident in Wolverhampton between 2003 and 2006. A significant association with being born in the UK remained after a multivariate analysis (OR = 9.68, 95%CI = 2.00–46.78, p<0.01) and excess alcohol intake and cannabis use (OR = 6.26, 95%CI = 1.45–27.02, p = .01) were observed as social risk factors for infection. Conclusions/Significance The continued consistent presence of the Mercian strain suggests ongoing community transmission. Whilst significant associations have been found, there may be other common risk factors yet to be identified. Future investigations should focus on targeting the relevant risk groups and elucidating the biological factors that mediate continued transmission of this strain."
https://openalex.org/W1980736235,"Background A vast body of social and cognitive psychology studies in humans reports evidence that external rewards, typically monetary ones, undermine intrinsic motivation. These findings challenge the standard selfish-rationality assumption at the core of economic reasoning. In the present work we aimed at investigating whether the different modulation of a given monetary reward automatically and unconsciously affects effort and performance of participants involved in a game devoid of visual and verbal interaction and without any perspective-taking activity. Methodology/Principal Findings Twelve pairs of participants were submitted to a simple motor coordination game while recording the electromyographic activity of First Dorsal Interosseus (FDI), the muscle mainly involved in the task. EMG data show a clear effect of alternative rewards strategies on subjects' motor behavior. Moreover, participants' stock of relevant past social experiences, measured by a specifically designed questionnaire, was significantly correlated with EMG activity, showing that only low social capital subjects responded to monetary incentives consistently with a standard rationality prediction. Conclusions/Significance Our findings show that the effect of extrinsic motivations on performance may arise outside social contexts involving complex cognitive processes due to conscious perspective-taking activity. More importantly, the peculiar performance of low social capital individuals, in agreement with standard economic reasoning, adds to the knowledge of the circumstances that makes the crowding out/in of intrinsic motivation likely to occur. This may help in improving the prediction and accuracy of economic models and reconcile this puzzling effect of external incentives with economic theory."
https://openalex.org/W1989625705,"The Pure Parsimony Haplotyping (PPH) problem is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem that consists of finding the minimum number of haplotypes necessary to explain a given set of genotypes. PPH has attracted more and more attention in recent years due to its importance in analysis of many fine-scale genetic data. Its application fields range from mapping complex disease genes to inferring population histories, passing through designing drugs, functional genomics and pharmacogenetics. In this article we investigate, for the first time, a recent version of PPH called the Pure Parsimony Haplotype problem under Uncertain Data (PPH-UD). This version mainly arises when the input genotypes are not accurate, i.e., when some single nucleotide polymorphisms are missing or affected by errors. We propose an exact approach to solution of PPH-UD based on an extended version of Catanzaro et al. [1] class representative model for PPH, currently the state-of-the-art integer programming model for PPH. The model is efficient, accurate, compact, polynomial-sized, easy to implement, solvable with any solver for mixed integer programming, and usable in all those cases for which the parsimony criterion is well suited for haplotype estimation."
