https://openalex.org/W2043411905,"The Ti plasmid sequences (T DNA) maintained in four unorganized crown gall tumor lines were defined by using restriction endonucleases and molecular hybridization techniques. Each tumor line contains a “core” T DNA which is apparently responsible for maintaining the transformed state; the core T DNA is colinear with the Ti plasmid and contains the Ti plasmid sequences referred to as the “common DNA”—sequences found in all Ti plasmids studied to date. A given Ti plasmid does not always give rise to the same T DNA complement. The data suggest that the majority if not all of the T DNA is integrated into plant DNA, that preferred regions of the Ti plasmid serve as the points of attachment to plant DNA and that the T DNA can be linked to more than one site in the plant genome."

Sudden withdrawal of magnesium from the medium increased whereas high concentrations of magnesium decreased the basal tension of the arteries. The absence of magnesium in the medium significantly potentiated the contractile responses of both small and large coronary arteries to norepinephrine, acetylcholine, serotonin, angiotensin, and potassium. These data support the hypothesis that magnesium deficiency, associated with sudden death ischemic heart disease, produces coronary arterial spasm."

https://openalex.org/W1968935058,"Immunity to malaria is mediated, at least in part, by antibody. Resistance to infection has been passively transferred with immune serum or its immunoglobulin fraction in human1, simian2 and rodent3,4 malaria. However, because of the structural and antigenic complexity of the malaria parasites5,6, it has proved difficult to identify and characterise those parasite antigens against which protective antibody is directed. We have produced several hybrid cell lines secreting monoclonal antibodies against the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium yoelii, and we now report that, of the antibodies tested, only those specific for antigens exclusive to the merozoite were protective in passive transfer experiments. Other anti-P. yoelii monoclonal antibodies, apparently recognising antigens in the membrane of the infected erythrocyte, were not protective on passive transfer. The protective monoclonal antibodies should be useful in the isolation of the important antigens of this parasite."

The results indicate that at least some primary differentiation of embryonic cells is determined by internal factors that segregate in early cleavages, whereas patterns of cleavage are dictated by both internally segregating determinants and external cues."

These results, and others, suggest that patients with primary affective illness may have a supersensitive cholinergic system both when they are ill and when their symptoms are in clinical remission."
https://openalex.org/W2013691042,"Forty children were given a diet free of artificial food dyes and other additives for 5 days. Twenty of the children had been classified as hyperactive by scores on the Conners Rating Scale and were reported to have favorable responses to stimulant medication. A diagnosis of hyperactivity had been rejected in the other 20 children. Oral challenges with large doses (100 or 150 milligrams) of a blend of FD & C approved food dyes or placebo were administered on days 4 and 5 of the experiment. The performance of the hyperactive children on paired-associate learning tests on the day they received the dye blend was impaired relative to their performance after they received the placebo, but the performance of the nonhyperactive group was not affected by the challenge with the food dye blend."
https://openalex.org/W1993289125,The magnetic field of the action potential from an isolated frog sciatic nerve was measured by a SQUID magnetometer with a novel room-temperature pickup coil. The 1.2 x 10(-10) tesla field was measured 1.3 millimeters from the nerve with a signal-to-noise ratio of 40 to 1.
https://openalex.org/W2003991877,"Twenty-two young children, maintained on a diet that excluded certain foods, were challenged intermittently with a blend of seven artificial colors in a double-blind trial. Parents' observations provided the criteria of response. One child that responded mildly to the challenge and one that responded dramatically were detected. The latter, a 34-month-old female, showed a significant increase in aversive behaviors. These results further confirm previous controlled studies."
https://openalex.org/W1969281233,"The isolated turtle olfactory bulb was used to characterize synaptic interactions between mitral and granule cell dendrites. First, blockade of antidromic invasion of mitral cell dendrites caused a large decrease in the size of the inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) recorded in mitral cells, indicating that the IPSP results in large part from activity in the dendrites of mitral cells. Second, direct depolarization of mitral cells was followed by an IPSP. In the presence of tetrodotoxin, depolarization of mitral cells evoked calcium spikes (as would be expected for presynaptic membranes) followed by IPSP's. These findings demonstrate that regenerative sodium spikes and axonal pathways are not required for this inhibitory pathway and that the inhibition is indeed a result of local dendritic interaction. Such a pathway provides an obligatory synaptic inhibition of mitral cells following their activation and emphasizes the tight coupling that exists with reciprocal dendrodendritic synapses."

https://openalex.org/W2028260685,"By using conditional loss of suppression as an assay, we have been successful in screening for a yeast mutant which is defective in tRNA processing. The los1-1 mutation causes an accumulation of a subset of precursor tRNAs at the nonpermissive temperature. These pre-tRNAs are like those which accumulate in the yeast mutant tauthor36 (rna1) in that they have transcribed intervening sequences. The mutations at los1-1 and rna1 complement and segregate independently of each other. The los1-1 mutation affects the expression of all 8 tyrosine-inserting suppressor loci, but does not seem to affect rRNA or mRNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1999785503,"Blue light converts bilirubin in the skin of jaundiced rats to metastable geometric isomers that are transported in blood and excreted in bile. The same reaction probably occurs in jaundiced babies exposed to light, particularly during treatment with phototherapy. Excretion of unisomerized bilirubin is prevented by intramolecular hydrogen bonding, and the pigment has to be metabolized to more polar derivatives to be excreted efficiently."

https://openalex.org/W2007051069,"In cats anesthetized with chloralose-pentobarbital and artificially ventilated, electrical stimulation of the caudal end of the cut cervical vagus nerve has a biphasic effect on the bronchoconstriction induced by an intravenous infusion of serotonin. The response consists of a brief augmentation of bronchoconstriction followed by relatively prolonged bronchodilation. After muscarinic receptor blockade with atropine, vagal stimulation causes only bronchodilation. Vagally mediated bronchodilation is not affected by beta adrenergic blockade with propranolol, alpha adrenergic blockade with phenoxybenzamine, or adrenergic neuronal blockade with guanethidine, but is abolished by autonomic ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium. These findings support the conclusion that a nonadrenergic inhibitory nervous system is present in the pulmonary airways of the cat and that the system is supplied by preganglionic fibers in the cervical vagus nerves."

https://openalex.org/W2093727891,Growth of head-fold-stage rat embryos cultured with human serum for 48 hours was enhanced by supplementation with glucose. Embryo growth (protein and DNA contents) varied with the source of the serum. Serum from 16 of 19 untreated subjects produced normal embryos. Serum from five subjects undergoing cancer chemotherapy and six subjects receiving anticonvulsants was either lethal or teratogenic.

https://openalex.org/W2063048256,"We present three lines of evidence for the existence of an intramicrosomal pool of CMP-NeuNAc in liver slices incubated with 3H-NeuNAc: first, enrichment in the microsomal fraction over the cell homogenate of CMP-3H-NeuNAc relative to CMP-14C-NeuNAc, the latter added as marker for sugar nucleotide trapped between and adsorbed onto vesicles; second, removal from microsomes by isotonic sucrose washing of only half of the CMP-3H-NeuNAc synthesized in vivo under conditions which remove all the CMP-14C-NeuNAc; and third, complete loss of both sugar nucleotides upon treatment of microsomes by hypotonic shock or with low concentrations of detergents. Incubation of CMP-NeuNAc with microsomes in vitro showed that the intact sugar nucleotide was penetrating the vesicles. When the sugar nucleotide is labeled in the sugar moiety, microsomal vesicles accumulate soluble radiolabeled products. This accumulation was saturable and dependent on time, temperature and concentration of sugar nucleotide, and was also inhibited by substrate analogues and by pretreatment of microsomes with proteases. Together, these results provide strong evidence for the existence of a specific transport system for CMP-NeuNAc in microsomes."

https://openalex.org/W1973948176,"Gap junctions composed of intramembranous particles are frequently found to couple adjacent cells and are the sites of cell-to-cell exchange of physiologically important ions and molecules. In many vertebrate systems, the disappearance of gap junctions during development is thought to be due to a process of interiorization involving endocytosis. Intramembranous particle dispersal, however, is an alternative, more economical mode of gap junction removal. Studies on a metamorphosing insect, the moth Manduca sexta, show that mature larval gap junctions are maintained only briefly during early pupal stages as macular plaques of EF particles. After this stage, ecdysone initiates pupal cellular rearrangements, and the maculae break down by a “streaming out” of junctional particles in linear arrays away from the plaque periphery. A particle-free aisle, running along an intramembranous groove, lies in the center of these aligned arrays, and this groove is observed before particle streaming commences. As development proceeds, the particle-free aisles widen and the gap junctional particles are dispersed over the intramembranous E face, rather than being disposed of by “internalization”. Diapausing controls suggest that the intramembranous groove along which the junctional particles become aligned may be a cellular response to hormonal stimulation. Fracturing differences render comparable junctional particle redistribution more difficult to follow in vertebrate cells, making arthropod systems preferable for the analysis of gap junction breakdown in vivo. Particle dispersal rather than interiorization may thus be more widespread than currently suspected."

https://openalex.org/W2083586755,"A new transport mechanism explains the importance of the shape of bronchial bifurcations in the transfer of gases and particles between the atmosphere and the alveoli. Photographs of flow visualization experiments illustrate the effect in models of bronchial branching. The mechanism provides a means of nondiffusional transport that helps to explain normal respiratory exchange of gases as well as successful ventilation with very low tidal volumes, as in some lung diseases and in the high-frequency panting of dogs."
https://openalex.org/W1980909906,"The additional segments of five large marker chromosomes of methotrexate-resistant mouse melanoma PG19T3 cells are shown to consist of C-banding material. In situ hybridization indicates that these additional segments also contain a high proportion of sequences that will cross hybridize with mouse satellite DNA. Analytical density gradient centrifugation suggests that up to 60% of the DNA in the additional segments may be in the form of satellite DNA. Incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine for one complete S phase and staining with the Hoechst 33258 fluorescence plus Giemsa technique reveals complex asymmetries within the additional segments. These asymmetries are interpreted as showing a large repeating unit, which is likely to be involved in the amplification of the dihydrofolate reductase gene.

https://openalex.org/W1996942027,"Glucan, a macrophage stimulant, was evaluated for its ability to alter survival and phagocytic dysfunction in mice challenged with mouse hepatitis virus strain MHV-A59. Administration of glucan before the mice were challenged with the virus significantly prolonged median survival time but did not modify overall mortality compared with control mice given dextrose. Maximal effectiveness was achieved when glucan was administered both before and after the viral challenge. In contrast to the marked hepatic parenchymal cell necrosis observed in the control mice, glucan-treated mice exhibited reduced pathology. Intraperitoneal administration of MHV-A59 resulted in a significant depression of phagocytic activity compared with controls that were not exposed to the virus. The enhancement in phagocytic function in glucan-treated control mice was unaltered in virus-challenged, glucan-treated mice. Thus glucan is capable of increasing survival, inhibiting hepatic necrosis, and maintaining an activated state of phagocytic activity in mice challenged with MHV-A59. Macrophage stimulants may have a significant role in the modification of virally induced hepatic lesions."

https://openalex.org/W2059317042,"Mice implanted with morphine pellets demonstrated a 30-fold increase in tolerance to subcutaneously administered morphine but showed no cross-tolerance to subcutaneously administered heroin. When given morphine intracerebroventricularly, the mice showed no tolerance to morphine or cross-tolerance to heroin. These observations depended on the presence of the morphine pellet. If the pellets were removed prior to determinations of potency, the expected responses--tolerance to morphine and cross-tolerance to heroin--were obtained. The blood-brain barrier may be a prime site for the expression of morphine tolerance in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2039768754,"Analysis of lifetime studies of 243 beagles with skeletal burdens of radium-226 shows that the distribution of bone cancers clusters about a linear function of the logarithms of radiation dose rate to the skeleton and time from exposure until death. Similar relations displaced by species-dependent response ratios also provide satisfactory descriptions of the reported data on deaths from primary bone cancers in people and mice exposed to radium-226. The median cumulative doses (or times) leading to death from bone tumors are 2.9 times larger for dogs than for mice and 3.6 times larger for people than for dogs. These response ratios are well correlated with the normal life expectancies. The cumulative radiation dose required to give significant risk of bone cancer is found to be much less at lower dose rates than at higher rates, but the time required for the tumors to be manifested is longer. At low dose rates, this time exceeds the normal life-span and appears as a practical threshold, which for bone cancer is estimated to occur at an average cumulative radiation dose to the skeleton of about 50 to 110 rads for the three species."
https://openalex.org/W2001672615,"Groups of three to four mice were gavaged with aqueous solutions of 2 milligrams of morpholine, after which they were exposed to nitrogen dioxide in inhalation chambers at concentrations of 0.2 to 50 parts per million for up to 4 hours. At sequential intervals during the exposure, mice were frozen and pulverized in liquid nitrogen, and the mice powder was extracted with ice-cold 35 percent aqueous methanol and dichloromethane; organic-phase concentrates were analyzed for N-nitrosomorpholine with a thermal energy analyzer interfaced to a gas chromatograph. The N-nitrosomorpholine yields, ranging up to about 2.3 micrograms per mouse, were time-dependent relative to the duration of exposure to nitrogen dioxide and dose-dependent relative to the concentrations of nitrogen dioxide; control levels (in mice that were gavaged with morpholine or distilled water and then exposed to air instead of nitrogen dioxide) were less than 5 nanograms per mouse. These preliminary studies demonstrate the in vivo nitrosating potential of nitrogen oxides."

https://openalex.org/W1970189765,"Based on luminescence, the photoluminescent thermometer can in principle function in electromagnetic field coupling and perturbation. Several prototypal probes that have been constructed and tested demonstrate the feasibility of the concept. Temperature resolution of approximately 0.3 degrees C has thus far been achieved. The probes are needle-shaped, sturdy and less than 1 millimeter in size. This thermometer system has excellent potential application in monitoring and controlling tissue temperatures when microwaves are used to induce hyperthermia for cancer treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2032703379,"Close correlations between the development of the anticonvulsant effects of diphenylhydantoin and increases in tritiated diazepam binding were observed in rats from fetal day 16 to maturation. In contrast, significant decreases in tritiated diazepam binding were observed in 2- and 3-week-old rats that were exposed in utero to diphenylhydantoin. These changes can be correlated with reported increases in seizure susceptibility after prenatal exposure to diphenylhydantoin."
