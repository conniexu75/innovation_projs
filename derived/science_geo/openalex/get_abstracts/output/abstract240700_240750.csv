https://openalex.org/W1964353872,"Activation of the oncogenic kinase Akt stimulates glucose uptake and metabolism in cancer cells and renders these cells susceptible to death in response to glucose withdrawal. Here we show that 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) reverses the sensitivity of Akt-expressing glioblastoma cells to glucose deprivation. AICAR's protection depends on the activation of AMPK, as expression of a dominant-negative form of AMPK abolished this effect. AMPK is a cellular energy sensor whose activation can both block anabolic pathways such as protein synthesis and activate catabolic reactions such as fatty acid oxidation to maintain cellular bioenergetics. While rapamycin treatment mimicked the effect of AICAR on inhibiting markers of cap-dependent translation, it failed to protect Akt-expressing cells from death upon glucose withdrawal. Compared to control cells, Akt-expressing cells were impaired in the ability to induce fatty acid oxidation in response to glucose deprivation unless stimulated with AICAR. Stimulation of fatty acid oxidation was sufficient to maintain cell survival as activation of fatty acid oxidation with bezafibrate also protected Akt-expressing cells from glucose withdrawal-induced death. Conversely, treatment with a CPT-1 inhibitor to block fatty acid import into mitochondria prevented AICAR from stimulating fatty acid oxidation and promoting cell survival in the absence of glucose. Finally, cell survival did not require reversal of Akt's effects on either protein translation or lipid synthesis as the addition of the cell penetrant oxidizable substrate methyl-pyruvate was sufficient to maintain survival of Akt-expressing cells deprived of glucose. Together, these data suggest that activation of Akt blocks the ability of cancer cells to metabolize nonglycolytic bioenergetic substrates, leading to glucose addiction."
https://openalex.org/W1995181798,"Huntington disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the protein huntingtin (Htt)1, which leads to its aggregation in nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusion bodies2. We recently identified 52 loss-of-function mutations in yeast genes that enhance the toxicity of a mutant Htt fragment3. Here we report the results from a genome-wide loss-of-function suppressor screen in which we identified 28 gene deletions that suppress toxicity of a mutant Htt fragment. The suppressors are known or predicted to have roles in vesicle transport, vacuolar degradation, transcription and prion-like aggregation. Among the most potent suppressors was Bna4 (kynurenine 3-monooxygenase), an enzyme in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation that has been linked directly to the pathophysiology of Huntington disease in humans by a mechanism that may involve reactive oxygen species4. This finding is suggestive of a conserved mechanism of polyglutamine toxicity from yeast to humans and identifies new candidate therapeutic targets for the treatment of Huntington disease."
https://openalex.org/W2132349803,"Akt/PKB is a serine/threonine kinase that promotes tumor cell growth by phosphorylating transcription factors and cell cycle proteins. There is particular interest in finding tumor-specific substrates for Akt to understand how this protein functions in cancer and to provide new avenues for therapeutic targeting. Our laboratory sought to identify novel Akt substrates that are expressed in breast cancer. In this study, we determined that activated Akt is positively correlated with the protein expression of the transcription/translation factor Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) in primary breast cancer by screening tumor tissue microarrays. We therefore questioned whether Akt and YB-1 might be functionally linked. Herein, we illustrate that activated Akt binds to and phosphorylates the YB-1 cold shock domain at Ser102. We then addressed the functional significance of disrupting Ser102 by mutating it to Ala102. Following the stable expression of Flag:YB-1 and Flag:YB-1 (Ala102) in MCF-7 cells, we observed that disruption of the Akt phosphorylation site on YB-1 suppressed tumor cell growth in soft agar and in monolayer. This correlated with an inhibition of nuclear translocation by the YB-1(Ala102) mutant. In conclusion, YB-1 is a new Akt substrate and disruption of this specific site inhibits tumor cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2018448673,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive, rapidly metastazising neoplasm with a high propensity for marrow involvement. SCLC cells express high levels of functional CXCR4 receptors for the chemokine stromal-cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12). Adhesion of SCLC cells to extracellular matrix or accessory cells within the tumor microenvironment confers resistance to chemotherapy via integrin signaling and thus may be responsible for residual disease and relapses commonly seen in SCLC. We examined the signaling mechanisms that regulate CXCL12-induced adhesion of SCLC cells to fibronectin, collagen and stromal cells and the effects on SCLC cell chemoresistance. We found that CXCL12-induced integrin activation which resulted in an increased adhesion of SCLC cells to fibronectin and collagen. This was mediated by α2, α4, α5 and β1 integrins along with CXCR4 activation, which could be inhibited by CXCR4 antagonists. Stromal cells protected SCLC cells from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis and this protection could also be antagonized by CXCR4 inhibitors. We conclude that activation of integrins and CXCR4 chemokine receptors co-operate in mediating adhesion and survival signals from the tumor microenvironment to SCLC cells. Therefore, CXCR4 antagonists in combination with cytotoxic drugs should be explored in SCLC to overcome CXCL12-mediated adhesion and survival signals in the tumor microenvironment."

https://openalex.org/W2105733901,"Members of the LAP protein family, LET-413 in Caenorhabditis elegans, Scribble in Drosophila melanogaster, and Erbin, Lano, Densin-180 and hScrib in mammals, have conserved structural features. LET-413 and Scribble are junctional proteins involved in establishing and maintaining epithelial cell polarity. scribble also behaves as a neoplastic tumor suppressor gene. We show here that, in epithelial cells, hScrib is recruited at cell-cell junctions in an E-cadherin-dependent manner as shown by calcium switch assays in MDCK cells, re-expression of E-cadherin in MDA-231 cells treated by 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5Aza), and siRNA experiments. hScrib is restricted at the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells by its LRR domain, and is enriched in Triton X-100-insoluble fractions. In breast cancers, most lobular tumors did not express hScrib and E-cadherin while ductal tumors had a less frequent downregulation of hScrib. Our data provide additional insights on the modalities of recruitment of hScrib at the cell-cell junctions, and establish a potential link between the E-cadherin and hScrib tumor suppressors."

https://openalex.org/W2012526118,"Germline mutations in the human homolog of the patched1 (PTCH1) are associated with basal cell nevus carcinoma syndrome (BCNS or Gorlin syndrome), which is characterized by developmental anomalies, radiation hypersensitivity and a predisposition to medulloblastomas and skin tumors. Patched1 (Ptc1) functions as a receptor for Sonic hedgehog (Shh) in a wide range of biological processes. Binding of Shh to Ptc1 results in activation of Smoothened (Smo), which in turn stimulates expression of downstream target genes including Ptc1 and Gli1. Gli1 is a member of a family of DNA-binding zinc-finger proteins, including Gli2 and Gli3, that function in transcription control. Here, we report that inactivation of both Gli1 alleles in Ptc1+/− mice significantly reduces spontaneous medulloblastoma formation. Therefore, Gli1 is not only a marker of pathway activation but also plays a functional role in medulloblastoma formation. Interestingly, Gli2 levels were elevated in medulloblastoma cells but not in normal granule neuron precursors during cerebellar development in mice lacking Gli1. In cultured fibroblasts, Gli1 was more potent than Gli2 at inducing cell transformation. These results demonstrate that Gli1 plays a central role in medulloblastoma formation in Ptc1+/− mice and that Gli2 may also contribute to oncogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2164386659,"The gymnotiform weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus can capture prey using electrosensory cues that are dominated by low temporal frequencies. However, conventional tuning curves predict poor electroreceptor afferent responses to low-frequency stimuli. We compared conventional tuning curves with information tuning curves and found that the latter predicted substantially improved responses to these behaviorally relevant stimuli. Analysis of receptor afferent baseline activity showed that negative correlations reduced low-frequency noise levels, thereby increasing information transmission. Multiunit recordings from receptor afferents showed that this increased information transmission could persist at the population level. Finally, we verified that this increased low-frequency information is preserved in the spike trains of central neurons that receive receptor afferent input. Our results demonstrate that conventional tuning curves can be misleading when certain noise reduction strategies are used by the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2061873998,"Chronic inflammation plays an important role in insulin resistance. Inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), a mediator of inflammation, has been implicated in many human diseases including insulin resistance. However, the molecular mechanisms by which iNOS mediates insulin resistance remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that exposure to NO donor or iNOS transfection reduced insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 protein expression without altering the mRNA level in cultured skeletal muscle cells. NO donor increased IRS-1 ubiquitination, and proteasome inhibitors blocked NO donor-induced reduction in IRS-1 expression in cultured skeletal muscle cells. The effect of NO donor on IRS-1 expression was cGMP-independent and accentuated by concomitant oxidative stress, suggesting an involvement of nitrosative stress. Inhibitors for phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin, and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase failed to block NO donor-induced IRS-1 reduction, whereas these inhibitors prevented insulin-stimulated IRS-1 decrease. Moreover iNOS expression was increased in skeletal muscle of diabetic (ob/ob) mice compared with lean wild-type mice. iNOS gene disruption or treatment with iNOS inhibitor ameliorated depressed IRS-1 expression in skeletal muscle of diabetic (ob/ob) mice. These findings indicate that iNOS reduces IRS-1 expression in skeletal muscle via proteasome-mediated degradation and thereby may contribute to obesity-related insulin resistance.

Insulin resistance, reduced cellular responsiveness to insulin, is a major causative factor for type 2 diabetes, which accounts for over 90% of patients with hyperglycemia. Chronic, low grade inflammation has been implicated in type 2 diabetes and other human diseases including atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer.

However, how iNOS causes or exacerbates insulin resistance remains largely unknown. Insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 is a key molecule in insulin signaling that transduces a signal from insulin receptor (IR) to phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) (13.Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R.

Diabetes. 2001; 50: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms underlying reduced IRS-1 expression in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in vivo still remain to be clarified. NO is a signaling molecule that is involved in a variety of physiological and pathological cellular processes in various tissues including vasculature, central nervous system, and skeletal muscle (38.Stamler J.S. Meissner G. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 209-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). NO is produced by three distinct genes: neuronal and endothelial nitric-oxide synthases (nNOS and eNOS, also termed NOS1 and NOS3, respectively) and iNOS (also termed NOS2). In contrast to the activities of nNOS and eNOS that are tightly regulated by calcium-dependent calmodulin binding, iNOS does not require calcium ion or posttranslational modification for its activity. Therefore, iNOS expression is associated with prolonged, exaggerated NO generation up to over 1,000-fold compared with nNOS and eNOS (39.Kuo P.C. Schroeder R.A. Ann. Surg. 1995; 221: 220-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 40.Wink D.A. Miranda K.M. Espey M.G. Semin. Perinatol. 2000; 24: 20-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although iNOS expression is increased by various stimuli including acute inflammation, recent studies revealed that iNOS is expressed even in normal conditions in many tissues including skeletal muscle (11.Perreault M. Marette A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 41.Blottner D. Luck G. Cell Tissue Res. 1998; 292: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 42.Gath I.

Diverse actions of NO can be classified into two categories: cGMP-dependent actions that are well exemplified by NO-mediated vasodilation and cGMP-independent effects. In most cases, NO and NO-related compounds exert cGMP-independent effects through reactive nitrogen species-mediated nitrosative modifications of proteins, lipids, or DNA (45.Stamler J.S. Lamas S. Fang F.C. Cell. 2001; 106: 675-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar, 46.Drew B. Leeuwenburgh C. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Here we demonstrate that exposure to NO donor or transfection of iNOS caused a reduction in IRS-1 protein expression in a proteasome-dependent manner without altering the mRNA level of IRS-1. Furthermore we found that protein expression of iNOS was increased in skeletal muscle of genetically obese (ob/ob) mice compared with lean wild-type mice and that iNOS gene disruption improved the reduced IRS-1 expression in skeletal muscle of ob/ob mice. These data provide new insights into the molecular bases underlying chronic inflammation-involved pathogenesis of insulin resistance.

Cell Culture—Mouse C2C12 myoblasts were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. To induce differentiation into myotubes, after C2C12 myoblasts became confluent, the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum for 7 days. C2C12 myotubes were treated with the indicated concentrations of GSNO (10-1000 μm) or insulin (100 nm) in the presence or absence of wortmannin (100 nm), rapamycin (50 nm), SP600125 (25 μm), glucose oxidase (1 or 3.3 milliunits/ml), or ODQ (1 μm) for 24 h unless otherwise indicated. SNAP (500 μm), whose half-life is shorter than that of GSNO, was added twice to the culture media at 12-h intervals during the incubation for 24 h. Cell Transfection—C2C12 myoblasts were transfected with pCDNA3/iNOS or pCDNA3 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). pCDNA3/iNOS (53.Kuncewicz T. Balakrishnan P. Snuggs M.B. Kone B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F326-F336PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. B. C. Kone. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were harvested. Animals—iNOS knock-out (-/-) mice, genetically obese (ob/ob) mice, and wild-type C57BL/6J mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). iNOS-/- mice and ob/ob mice were back-crossed onto wild-type C57BL/6J mice at least 10 and 30 generations, respectively. The Institutional Animal Care Committee approved the study protocol. The animal care facility is accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. The mice were housed in mesh cages in a room maintained at 25 °C and illuminated in 12:12-h light-dark cycles; the mice were provided with standard rodent chow and water ad libitum. We mated heterozygous female +/ob C57BL/6J mice with male iNOS-/- C57BL/6J mice to obtain double heterozygotes with the genotype of iNOS+/- +/ob. Male littermates of iNOS-/- ob/ob, iNOS+/- ob/ob, and iNOS+/+ ob/ob C57BL/6J mice, which were generated by intercrossing double heterozygous iNOS+/- +/ob mice, were used for the study. Blood samples were collected under fed condition to measure glucose and insulin levels. The concentrations of blood glucose and plasma insulin were measured by Glucometer Elite (Bayer, Elkhart, IN) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Crystal Chem, Chicago, IL), respectively. After an overnight fast, under anesthesia with pentobarbital sodium (70 mg/kg BW, intraperitoneal), wild-type, iNOS+/+ ob/ob, and iNOS-/- ob/ob mice at 24 weeks of age received the insulin injection (humulin R, Eli Lilly, 5 units/kg BW) via the portal vein. At 5 min after insulin injection, skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius) was taken for biochemical analyses. Genotype Determination—Genotype was determined by PCR analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted from the tip of the tail. The primers and PCR conditions were as follows. For genotyping of iNOS gene, the sense primer was 5′-ACATGCAGAATGAGTACCGG-3′, and the antisense primer was 5′-TCAACATCTCCTGGTGGAAC-3′ for wild-type allele. The antisense primer was 5′-AATATGCGAAGTGGACCTCG-3′ for iNOS knock-out allele. The PCR analysis began with denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C each for 1 min with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The wild-type allele gave 108 base pairs, and the recombinant allele gave 270 base pairs. For genotyping of leptin gene, sense primer 5′-TGACCTGGAGAATCTCC and antisense primer 5′-CATCCAGGCTCTCTGGC-3′ for wild type were used. Sense primer 5′-TGACCTGGAGAATCTCT-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CATCCAGGCTCTCTGGC-3′ for mutated leptin gene (ob) were used. The PCR analysis began with denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C each for 30 s with a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Both wild-type and mutant alleles of leptin gene gave 100 base pairs. Insulin Tolerance Test—Insulin (15 units/kg BW) was intraperitoneally administered to fed ob/ob mice at the age of 23 weeks. Blood samples were collected at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after insulin injection. l-NIL Treatment—Obese (ob/ob) mice at 18 weeks of age received the intraperitoneal injection of iNOS inhibitor l-NIL (80 mg/kg BW) or phosphate-buffered saline twice (every 12 h) daily for 10 days. After the treatment, following an overnight fast, the animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (70 mg/kg BW, intraperitoneal), and then skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius) was taken for biochemical analyses. Tissue and Cell Homogenates—Tissue samples were homogenized as described previously (12.Sugita H. Kaneki M. Tokunaga E. Sugita M. Koike C. Yasuhara S. Tompkins R.G. Martyn J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: E386-E394Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly tissues were powdered under liquid nitrogen and homogenized in ice-cold buffer (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Following the incubation on ice for 30 min, the homogenized samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min. Cell lysates were obtained as described previously (54.Kaneki M. Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Yoshida K. Takekawa M. Liou J.R. Stone R. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly cells were lysed with cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% Nonidet P-40 or 20 mm CHAPS). Following incubation on ice for 30 min, lysate samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min. Aliquots of the supernatant containing equal amounts of protein, determined using the Bradford protein assay or Lowry assay, were subjected to immunoprecipitation followed by SDS-PAGE. Detection of Nitric-oxide Synthases—Partial purification of nitricoxide synthases (NOSs) was performed as described previously (43.Gath I. Ebert J. Godtel-Armbrust U. Ross R. Reske-Kunz A.B. Forstermann U. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In brief, 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose (100 mg/ml) (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the tissue homogenates, and then the samples were transferred to the column. After the column was washed twice with wash buffer A (4.6 mm Na2HPO4, 5.4 mm NaH2PO4, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.3), partially purified NOSs were eluted with elution buffer (4.6 mm Na2HPO4, 5.4 mm NaH2PO4, 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm NADPH, pH 7.3). Following acetone precipitation, partially purified NOSs were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-iNOS, -eNOS, and -nNOS antibodies. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating the lysates with the antibody at 4 °C for 5 h. The immune complexes were collected by incubation with protein A- or protein G-agarose beads for 1.5 h at 4 °C, washed three times with wash buffer B (50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. Cell lysates and tissue homogenates containing equal amounts of protein or immunoprecipitates were subjected to 7.5 or 10% SDS-PAGE after the addition of Laemmli sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. After transferring electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), the membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dried milk for 2 h at room temperature and incubated with primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. This was followed by incubation with secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at 4 °C. Western blotting chemiluminescence luminol reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used to visualize the blots. Bands of interest were scanned using Power Look (UMAX Technologies, Dallas, TX) and were quantified by using NIH Image 1.62 software (NTIS, Springfield, VA). Northern Blotting—Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Northern hybridization was performed as described previously (55.Fujimoto M. Maezawa Y. Yokote K. Joh K. Kobayashi K. Kawamura H. Nishimura M. Roberts A.B. Saito Y. Mori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 1002-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) using 32P-labeled cDNA probes for IRS-1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). cDNA probes for IRS-1 (56.Hirashima Y.

K. Ueki and K. Yokote, respectively. The probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a random primer DNA labeling kit version 2 (Panvera-TAKARA, Madison, WI). Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Assay—PI3K activity in the immunoprecipitates with anti-IRS-1 antibody was measured by in vitro phosphorylation assay using phosphatidylinositol (Sigma) as a substrate as described previously (57.Hirose M. Kaneki M. Sugita H. Yasuhara S. Martyn J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E1235-E1241PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly 5 μl of 100 mm MgCl2 and 10 μl of phosphatidylinositol (2 mg/ml) sonicated in kinase buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate) were added to the immunoprecipitates. The PI3K reaction was initiated by the addition of 1.5 μl of 1.5 mm ATP containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 6 n HCl and 80 μl of CHCl3/methanol (1:1). The samples were centrifuged, and the lower organic phase was applied to a silica gel TLC plate (Sigma), which had been prebaked for 1 h. The plate was developed in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/NH4OH (100:78:19:3.3), dried, and visualized by autoradiography. S"

https://openalex.org/W1967818195,"Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 signalling mediates communication between growth factor receptors and the cell nucleus and has been linked to several key events in the transformation process such as proliferation and invasion. We therefore sought to delineate the degree of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in breast cancer and potential links to upstream receptors such as VEGFR2, ErbB2, downstream targets, such as Ets-2, as well as clinico-pathological parameters, clinical outcome and response to tamoxifen. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was assessed by immunohistochemistry using a phospho-specific ERK1/2 antibody in three breast cancer cohorts including a total of 886 tumours arranged in tissue arrays. Cohort I consisted of 114 patients, cohort II of 248 postmenopausal patients randomized to either 2 years of tamoxifen or no adjuvant treatment and cohort III of 524 patients. Surprisingly, ERK1/2 phosphorylation correlated inversely with tumour size. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 was further associated with the presence of VEGFR2 (cohorts II and III) and the degree of phosphorylated Ets-2, indicating in vivo, a signalling cascade from VEGFR2 via ERK1/2 to Ets-2 phosphorylation. Interestingly, ERK1/2 phosphorylation correlated with better survival in untreated patients independently of lymph-node status and tumour size indicating that ERK1/2 signalling might be associated with a less aggressive phenotype. Finally, patients with oestrogen receptor positive and ERK1/2 phosphorylated tumours also had an impaired tamoxifen response."
https://openalex.org/W2064372625,"We report in silico identification and characterisation of a novel member of the ras association domain family 1 (RASSF1)/NORE1 family, namely, RASSF2, located at chromosomal region 20p13. It has three isoforms, all contain a ras association domain in the C-terminus. The longest isoform RASSF2A contains a 5′ CpG island. RASSF2A was cloned from a brain cDNA library and directly sequenced, confirming the genomic gene structure. In previous reports, we and others have demonstrated that RASSF1A is epigenetically inactivated in a variety of cancers, including sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC). In the present report, we analysed the methylation status of RASSF2A promoter region CpG island in sporadic CRC and compared it to K-ras mutation status. RASSF2A promoter region CpG island was hypermethylated in a majority of colorectal tumour cell lines (89%) and in primary colorectal tumours (70%), while DNA from matched normal mucosa was found to be unmethylated (tumour-specific methylation). RASSF2A expression was reactivated in methylated tumour cell lines after treatment with 5-aza 2-deoxycytidine. RASSF2A methylation is an early event, detectable in 7/8 colon adenomas. Furthermore, 75% of colorectal tumours with RASSF2A methylation had no K-ras mutations (codons, 12 and 13) (P=0.048), Fisher's exact test). Our data demonstrate that RASSF2A is frequently inactivated in CRCs by CpG island promoter hypermethylation, and that epigenetic (RASSF2A) and genetic (K-ras) changes are mutually exclusive and provide alternative pathways for affecting Ras signalling."

https://openalex.org/W2025954247,"The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) is a major regulator of cell-cycle progression and cellular differentiation. Central to pRB function is the pocket domain, which serves as the main binding region for cellular regulators. In tumors pRB is frequently inactivated by mutations in the pocket domain or by binding of viral oncoproteins to this region. A characteristic feature of these viral oncoproteins and many cellular pRB-binding partners is an LxCxE sequence motif, which interacts with pRB's pocket domain. Here, we show that the ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO is covalently attached to a distinct residue (K720) of pRB within the B-box of the pocket region that binds LxCxE-motif proteins. We provide evidence that SUMO preferentially targets the active, hypophosphorylated form of pRB and show that tumorigenic mutations of pRB in the pocket domain lead to a loss of SUMOylation. Notably, the level of pRB SUMOylation is controlled by the interaction of pRB with viral and cellular LxCxE-motif proteins. Inhibitors of pRB function, including the viral oncoproteins E1A and E7 and the cellular E1A-like inhibitor of differentiation EID-1, completely abolish SUMO modification of pRB. Conversely, pRB mutants deficient in binding of LxCxE-motif proteins exhibit a drastically enhanced modification by SUMO. Finally, we provide evidence that SUMOylation can influence pRB function, as the SUMO-deficient pRBK720R mutant exerts a slightly higher repressive potential on an E2F-responsive reporter gene than wild-type pRB. Taken together, these data identify SUMO modification as a novel post-translational modification of pRB that may control pRB activity by modulating LxCxE–pocket interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2077811740,"Centrosome duplication is a carefully controlled process in the cell cycle. Previous studies indicate that the tumor suppressor, p53, regulates centrosome duplication. Here, we present evidence for the involvement of the mammalian Krüppel-like transcription factor, KLF4, in preventing centrosome amplification following DNA damage caused by γ-irradiation. The colon cancer cell line HCT116, which contains wild-type p53 alleles (HCT116 p53+/+), displayed stable centrosome numbers following γ-irradiation. In contrast, HCT116 cells null for the p53 alleles (HCT116 p53−/−) exhibited centrosome amplification after irradiation. In the latter cell line, KLF4 was not activated following γ-irradiation due to the absence of p53. However, centrosome amplification could be suppressed in irradiated HCT116 p53−/− cells by conditional induction of exogenous KLF4. Conversely, in a HCT116 p53+/+ cell line stably transfected with small hairpin RNA (shRNA) designed to specifically inhibit KLF4, γ-irradiation induced centrosome amplification. In these cells, the inability of KLF4 to become activated in response to DNA damage was directly associated with an increase in cyclin E level and Cdk2 activity, both essential for regulating centrosome duplication. Cotransfection experiments showed that KLF4 overexpression suppressed the promoter activity of the cyclin E gene. The results of this study demonstrated that KLF4 is both necessary and sufficient in preventing centrosome amplification following γ-radiation-induced DNA damage and does so by transcriptionally suppressing cyclin E expression."

https://openalex.org/W2018813217,"The Delta-like (DLK1) gene is overexpressed in CD34+ cells from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients. DLK1 encodes an EGF-like homeotic transmembrane protein homologous to the notch/delta/serrate family. Although exogenous DLK1 promotes maintenance of murine hematopoietic stem cells, the functional effects of DLK1 overexpression in hematopoietic cells are unknown. We show that ectopically expressed DLK1 significantly inhibits differentiation and proliferation of human promyelocytic HL-60 cells. Unlike preadipocytes, where proteolytic processing of membrane-bound protein and release of a soluble form mediates differentiation inhibition, proteolytic release of the extracellular domain was not required for inhibition of hematopoietic cell differentiation. However, intracellular domain interactions were critical to this DLK1 function. We conclude that DLK1 overexpression in hematopoietic cells has important functional consequences. Our studies identify novel molecular mechanisms and indicate that DLK1 has activity both as a soluble and a transmembrane expressed protein. Our results support further investigation of the role of DLK1 in abnormal hematopoiesis in MDS."
https://openalex.org/W2002424419,"Tight junctions (TJs) regulate epithelial cell polarity and paracellular permeability. Loss of functional TJs is commonly associated with epithelial cell-derived cancers. Raf1-mediated transformation of rat salivary gland epithelial cells (Pa4-Raf1) induces transcriptional downregulation of the TJ protein occludin and forced re-expression of occludin rescues polarized phenotype of epithelial cells. In the present study, we used this model to examine how specific structural modifications in the occludin protein affect its function in vitro and influence tumor growth in vivo. Our results revealed that neither the C-terminal nor the N-terminal half of occludin alone were sufficient to rescue cells from transformation by Raf1. However, forced expression of an occludin mutant lacking the first extracellular loop was sufficient to rescue cells from Raf1-mediated transformation. Interestingly, forced expression of an occludin mutant lacking the second extracellular loop did not rescue the epithelial phenotype in vitro nor did it prevent tumor growth in vivo. These results demonstrate that the TJ protein occludin has a potent inhibitory effect on the Raf1-mediated tumorigenesis and the second extracellular loop of occludin appears to be critical for this function."
https://openalex.org/W2156013165,"ETV6 (ets translocation variant gene 6) TEL (translocation ets leukemia), encoding a transcriptional repressor, is involved in various translocations associated with human malignancies. Strikingly, the nonrearranged ETV6 allele is often deleted or inactivated in cells harboring these translocations. Although ETV6 translocations are infrequent in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), mutations or deregulated expression of ETV6 may contribute to leukemogenesis. To investigate the involvement of ETV6 in AML, we analysed 300 newly diagnosed patients for mutations in the coding region of the gene. Furthermore, we studied protein expression in 77 patients using two ETV6-specific antibodies. Five somatic heterozygous mutations were detected, which affected either the homodimerization- or the DNA-binding domain of ETV6. The proteins translated from the cDNAs of these mutants were unable to repress transcription and showed dominant-negative effects. In addition, we demonstrate that one-third of AML patients have deficient ETV6 protein expression, which is not related to ETV6 mRNA expression levels. In conclusion, we demonstrate that ETV6 abnormalities are not restricted to translocations and occur more frequently in AML than previously thought. Additional comprehensive studies are required to define the clinical consequence of ETV6 loss of function in AML."
https://openalex.org/W2024883983,"Germline BRCA2 mutations predispose to the development of pancreatic cancer. A polymorphic stop codon in the coding region of BRCA2 (K3326X) has been described, and although an initial epidemiological study suggested it was not disease causing, subsequent studies have been inconclusive. To investigate the biological significance of the K3326X polymorphism, we determined its prevalence in patients with sporadic and familial pancreatic cancer. Using a case-control design, we studied 250 patients with resected sporadic pancreatic adenocarcinomas, 144 patients with familial pancreatic adenocarcinoma, 115 spouses of patients with pancreatic cancer, and a disease control group of 135 patients without a personal history of cancer who had undergone cholecystectomy for non-neoplastic disease. The K3326X polymorphism was detected using heteroduplex analysis and DNA sequencing. The BRCA2 K3326X polymorphism was significantly more prevalent in individuals with familial pancreatic cancer: 8/144 (5.6%) vs 3/250 controls (1.2%) (odds ratio, 4.84; 95% CI, 1.27-18.55, P<0.01). One K3326X carrier with familial pancreatic cancer carried an alteration (IVS 16-2A>G) suspected to be deleterious. Excluding this case did not alter the significance of the association (OR: 4.24, P<0.01). In contrast, there was no difference in prevalence among individuals with sporadic pancreatic cancer - 7/250 (OR: 2.37, 95% CI: 0.61-9.27). The increased prevalence of the BRCA2 K3326X polymorphism in patients with familial pancreatic cancer suggests that this polymorphism is deleterious and contributes to pancreatic cancer risk."
https://openalex.org/W2079108606,"The death ligand TRAIL has been suggested as a suitable biological agent for the selective induction of cell death in cancer cells. Moreover, TRAIL synergizes with DNA-damaging therapies such as chemotherapeutic drugs or ionizing irradiation (IR). Here, we show that synergy of TRAIL and IR, that is, crosssensitization between TRAIL and IR for induction of apoptosis, entirely depends on Bax proficiency in human DU145 and HCT116 carcinoma cells. DU145 prostate carcinoma cells that have lost Bax protein expression due to mutation fail to activate caspase-3 and -9 when exposed to TRAIL and IR. In contrast, TRAIL sensitized for IR-induced apoptosis and vice versa upon reconstitution of Bax expression. Notably, both DU145 and HCT116 still express significant levels of the multidomain proapoptotic Bcl-2 homolog Bak. This indicates that Bak is not sufficient to mediate crosssensitization and synergism between IR and TRAIL. These data clearly establish distinct roles for Bax and Bak in linking the TRAIL death receptor pathway to the mitochondrial apoptosis signaling cascade upon DNA damage by IR."

Mutation analysis suggests that the Arg-5 and Lys-110 residues on the PCNA back side are the contact points of the two homotrimers in the doublet. Furthermore, short synthetic peptides encompassing either Arg-5 or Lys-110 inhibit double trimer formation. We also found that a PCNA double trimer, but not a homotrimer alone, can simultaneously accommodate chromatin assembly factor-1 and polymerase δ.

Consistent with this idea, PCNA-associated proteins possess a wide range of different functions such as replication factor-C, DNA polymerases δ and ϵ (pol δ and ϵ), chromatin assembly factor-1 (CAF-1), p21WAF1, DNA ligase, FEN1, XPG, MSH2, cyclins, and cyclin-dependent kinases (1.Tsurimoto T.

Interestingly, all of these proteins bind to the front side or outer surface of the PCNA trimer ring, which faces the replication primer. Thus far, there is no direct evidence that any protein binds to the back side. The connection between CAF-1 and DNA replication was initially suggested to be that CAF-1 was found in the replication foci (17.Krude T. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It is now clear that the process of chromatin assembly is tightly coupled to DNA replication or repair, for which the association of PCNA and CAF-1 is required (18.Shibahara K. Stillman B. Cell. 1999; 96: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 19.Moggs J.G. Grandi P. Quivy J.P. Jonsson Z.O. Hubscher U. Becker P.B. Almouzni G. Mol. Cell.

The CAF-1 complex is composed of three subunits, p150, p60, and p48 (21.Smith S. Stillman B. Cell. 1989; 58: 15-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), and the largest subunit is directly associated with PCNA (20.Zhang Z. Shibahara K. Stillman B. Nature. 2000; 408: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Here we present evidence that PCNA exists as a double trimer complex and that pol δ binds to one homotrimer and CAF-1 binds to the other homotrimer simultaneously, allowing chromatin remodeling to be coupled with DNA replication. Cells and Plasmids—CHO cells were maintained in minimal essential medium as described previously (22.Naryzhny S.N. Lee H. Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 1764-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) transformed by pT7hPCNA (23.Fien K. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Dr. B. Stillman (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). The plasmid pEGFPCNA (a kind gift of Dr. C. Cardoso, Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Germany) was created by joining the GFP and PCNA open reading frames with a flexible and hydrophilic linker so that GFP cannot interfere the formation of a functional PCNA homotrimer ring (24.Leonhardt H. Rahn H.P. Weinzierl P. Sporbert A. Cremer T. Zink D. Cardoso M.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). The pEGFPCNAL2 construct (a kind gift of Dr. C. Cardoso) is identical to pEGFPCNA except that it contains a nuclear localization sequence. Further manipulations were carried out in our laboratory to generate several deletion and point mutants using appropriate oligoprimers and PCR. Cross-linking by Formaldehyde and Two-dimensional PAGE—Crosslinking was carried out by incubating intact cells, total cell extracts, or purified proteins in PBS containing 1.0–1.5% formaldehyde at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding LDS buffer (final concentration, 2% LDS, 60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 0.001% bromphenol blue), or by adding glycine at a final concentration of 0.15 m. Protein analysis by two-dimensional PAGE and Western blot analysis was carried out as described previously (25.Naryzhny S.N. Lee H. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 930-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). PCNA Purification by Gel Filtration and SDS-PAGE—Cell extracts were prepared from bacteria (BL21 (DE3)) transformed with pT7hPCNA (23.Fien K. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) by sonication in buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture. The extracts were “cleared” by centrifugation and applied to a Sephacryl S200, 16/60 gel-filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). The main PCNA peak was collected and subjected to another round of purification using the same Sephacryl filtration system. PCNA eluted in PBS was subjected to UnoQ1 (Bio-Rad) liquid chromatography. PCNA was then further purified using the Superdex 200 10/300 GL gel-filtration system (separation range, molecular weight 10,000–600,000). In some cases, PCNA was further purified using Phenyl-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) chromatography prior to the gel filtration by the Superdex 200 10/300 GL system. However, without this extra step, the purity of PCNA estimated by SDS-PAGE, and silver staining was usually more than 95%. The isolation of the PCNA monomer by SDS-PAGE was carried out as described previously (26.Naryzhny S.N. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 238: 50-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Renaturation of these PCNA molecules was achieved by sequential dialysis in the following order: 1) buffer containing 4 m urea, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 2) 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 3) PBS containing 20% glycerol and 1.0 mm EDTA, and 4) PBS containing 50% glycerol. Immunoprecipitation and Immunostaining—For double immunoprecipitation, CHO cells transfected with pEGFPCNAL2 were treated with cell extraction buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture). The extracts (1 mg/ml protein) were then incubated at 4 °C overnight with agarose-conjugated PC10 monoclonal anti-PCNA antibody. The immunoprecipitate was washed four times with PBS after which PCNA complexes were dissociated from antibodies by treatment with elution buffer (0.1 m glycine, 0.125 m NaCl, pH 2.8). The pH of the supernatant was immediately adjusted to 7.0 using 1.0 m Tris, followed by a second immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody generated against the 125-kDa catalytic subunit of pol δ (C-2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Subsequently, the immunoprecipitate was washed four times with PBS, eluted with LDS sample buffer, and boiled for 30 s. The proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. For a negative control, normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz) was used. For the co-immunoprecipitation and subsequent Western blot analysis described in Fig. 4, D–F, total cell extracts of CHO cells transfected with either wild type or the R5A/K110A mutant PCNA construct were prepared as described previously (25.Naryzhny S.N. Lee H. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 930-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell extracts prepared in 800 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and the mixture of protease inhibitors) were centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected (first extract), and the pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of DNA digestion buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2), and treated with DNase I (10 units) for 10 h at 4 °C. The DNA digestion was stopped by adding 100 μl of 9.0 m urea and 2% Nonidet P-40. The supernatant (second extract) was collected after the solution was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The first and the second extracts were then combined (∼1.5 mg/ml protein) and subjected to immunoprecipitation, using 10 μl of a monoclonal antibody against the 150-kDa subunit of CAF-1 (NB 500-207, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), followed by incubation overnight with 40 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunoprecipitate was washed four times with PBS and boiled for 2 min in 150 μl of LDS sample buffer. The protein complexes were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using a goat polyclonal anti-CAF-1 (p150 subunit) antibody (C-21, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a mouse monoclonal anti-pol δ (p125 subunit) antibody, or a PC10 anti-PCNA antibody. Peptide-based Inhibition of PCNA Double Trimer Formation—Peptides were synthesized by Genemed Synthesis (San Francisco, CA) at >90% purity. Cell extracts prepared using hypotonic buffer (2.7 mm KCl, 1.0 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 15 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) were incubated with 0.1, 0.3, or 1.0 mg/ml peptide for 10 min on ice followed by cross-linking by treatment with 1.5% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. PCNA Structural Analysis—The following web-based programs were used to analyze PCNA structure: Deep View/Swiss-pdb Viewer, Hex 4.2 by David Ritchie, the University of Aberdeen, Scotland, UK, and RasMol Version 2.7.2.1. Mammalian PCNA Forms a Double Trimer Complex—To gain insights into the ability of PCNA to form complexes in mammalian cells, we analyzed endogenous PCNA by SDS-PAGE. As expected, only 33-kDa monomers were detected under these denaturing conditions (Fig. 1A, lane 1). However, when cells were treated with 1.5% formaldehyde for 30 min to cross-link proteins prior to SDS-PAGE, PCNA was detected at the positions of 33, ∼100, and ∼200 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 2). When the cross-linking time was extended to 90 min, essentially all of the PCNA molecules in the cells formed a ∼200-kDa protein complex (Fig. 1A, lane 3). Further extension of the cross-linking time to 3 h did not increase the size of complex beyond 200 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 4), suggesting that the complex formed in a specific way and had a defined structure. The cross-linking of cell extracts, which was more efficient than that of whole cells, showed essentially the same results (see below). To determine whether the 200-kDa complexes included other proteins, we carried out two-dimensional PAGE. As shown in Fig. 1B, 33-, 100-, and 200-kDa proteins were detected when cell extracts were cross-linked for 20 min. Essentially all of the PCNA molecules formed 200-kDa complexes when cell extracts were cross-linked for 90 min (Fig. 1C). Because the 100-, and 200-kDa complexes have exactly the same pI as the PCNA monomer (4.57), it is highly likely that they contain only PCNA molecules. Therefore, considering their molecular masses, the 100-, and 200-kDa complexes are most likely a singlet and a doublet of PCNA homotrimers, respectively. Although the double trimer may have a specific structure, it should also be noted that considerable cross-linking time was required to convert all of the single trimers into doublets that are stable enough to survive protein purification and subsequent gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3). Therefore, the PCNA double trimer complex may normally exist as a dynamic, loose complex. This could be the reason why a PCNA double trimer has not been observed by crystallography (7.Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 8.Krishna T.S. Kong X.P. Gary S. Burgers P.M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1994; 79: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar); nevertheless, this mode of dynamic and loose protein-protein interactions may be important in the regulation of many different cellular functions. Under our cross-linking conditions, we did not observe significant cross-linking between PCNA and other proteins. This may be because essentially all of the PCNA molecules exist in the cells as homotrimer doublets (albeit as a loose complex), and none of the lysine or arginine residues in PCNA and PCNA-binding proteins present at close enough proximity to be cross-linked. It should be noted that most PCNA-binding proteins are associated with PCNA through its center loop (41DSSH44) and the interdomain-connecting loop (121LDVEQLGIPEQE132), neither of which contains an arginine nor lysine residue (1.Tsurimoto T. Front Biosci. 1999; 4: 849-858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we do not anticipate that PCNA would be cross-linked with other known PCNA-associating proteins by formaldehyde, even when they form a complex with PCNA in vivo. To further confirm that the ∼200-kDa PCNA complex does not contain any other proteins, we repeated the cross-linking experiment using purified PCNA as substrate. High purity (>99%) PCNA was achieved using a combination of Sephacryl S200, UnoQ, and the Superdex 200 10/300 GL as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1D). Cross-linking of purified PCNA in its native form for 15 min using 1.0% formaldehyde resulted in the formation of the trimer and double trimer complexes (Fig. 1E, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). In contrast to PCNA molecules purified by gel filtration, those isolated by SDS-PAGE formed double trimers extremely inefficiently (Fig. 1E, lane 10). Furthermore, they formed many nonspecific complexes when cross-linked (see the smear in Fig. 1E, lane 10). It should also be noted that, in contrast to the PCNA molecules purified by gel filtration, those from SDS-PAGE formed substantial amounts of dimers when they are renatured (Fig. 1E, lane 9). These results strongly suggest that it is difficult for PCNA to return to its native conformation once it is completely denatured, especially when chaperones and other auxiliary factors are not available for the renaturation process. Furthermore, it appears that the native protein conformation is important for the formation of the PCNA double trimer complex. The Amino Acid Residues Arg-5 and Lys-110 Are Crucial for Double Trimer Formation—To further characterize the double trimer complex in mammalian cells, we analyzed GFP·PCNA fusion proteins produced in CHO cells transfected with pEGFPCNA (24.Leonhardt H. Rahn H.P. Weinzierl P. Sporbert A. Cremer T. Zink D. Cardoso M.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). It was previously shown that the GFP portion of this fusion protein did not interfere with the formation of a functional PCNA trimer (24.Leonhardt H. Rahn H.P. Weinzierl P. Sporbert A. Cremer T. Zink D. Cardoso M.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Consistent with this previous data, the GFP-human PCNA fusion protein produced in CHO cells behaved similarly to endogenous PCNA following crosslinking (Fig. 2, A and B). (The relative amount of endogenous PCNA is much lower than that of the PCNA fusion protein in this particular experiment (Fig. 2B, arrow).) As reported previously (24.Leonhardt H. Rahn H.P. Weinzierl P. Sporbert A. Cremer T. Zink D. Cardoso M.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), the GFP·PCNA fusion proteins appear to be localized in the replication foci (Fig. 2C). To further characterize the GFP·PCNA fusion protein, extracts prepared from CHO cells transfected with pEGFPCNA were subjected to two-dimensional PAGE using a pH 4–7, 13-cm gel strip and subsequent immunostaining using PC10. As shown previously (25.Naryzhny S.N. Lee H. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 930-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 27.Naryzhny S.N. Lee H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20194-20199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), three distinct isoforms of endogenous PCNA were detected (Fig. 2D, M, A, and B are for the main (pI 4.57), acidic (pI 4.52), and basic (pI 4.62) isoforms, respectively). The GFP·PCNA fusion protein also contained three distinct isoforms (Fig. 2D, denoted as M*, A*, and B*) that are nearly identical with the three endogenous isoforms, except their molecular mass (∼66 kDa) and pI (5.0, 4.95, and 5.05, respectively) were shifted. The differences in size and pI were predicted because of the addition of GFP. As expected, a 30-min cross-linking of the cell extracts resulted in the formation of trimer and double trimer complexes by endogenous PCNA (Fig. 2E, T and DT, respectively). Similarly, the GFP·PCNA fusion protein also formed trimer and double trimer complexes (Fig. 2E, T* and DT*, respectively). Consistent with the data in Fig. 1A, the monomer and large complexes have exactly the same pI (Fig. 2E), again suggesting that no other proteins are included in the trimer or double trimer complexes formed by the GFP·PCNA fusion proteins. To map the precise contact points between the two trimer subunits of the doublet, we analyzed complex formation by several pEGFPCNA point and deletion mutants on the surface of the PCNA structure. Both anti-GFP and PC10 antibodies were used for immunostaining to distinguish the (mutant) GFP·PCNA fusion protein and endogenous PCNA. The following mutants did not alter the formation of either trimer or double trimer: K13A, K14A, K254A (Fig. 3A), K20A, K80A, K117A, K191A, K240A, and K248A (data not shown). It should be noted that Lys-13 and Lys-20 are located inside the PCNA trimer ring, whereas Lys-117 and Lys-254 are on the surface of the front side. The rest of the mutation sites are located on the back side of the PCNA trimer ring. Further mutation analysis identified Arg-5 and Lys-110 as two critical amino acid residues for stable double trimer formation by formaldehyde-mediated cross-linking (Fig. 3A, lanes 8 and 10). We also examined the ability of synthetic peptides to inhibit PCNA double trimer formation. As shown in Fig. 3B, synthetic peptides encompassing Arg-5 (1MFEARLVQGSIL12) and Lys-110 (104EAPNQEKV111) inhibited formation of the double trimer complex, whereas a peptide (251LAPKIEDEEG260) corresponding to the amino acid sequence at the C terminus region (i.e. located on the front side) did not. None of these peptides inhibited the formation of the PCNA homotrimer complex (Fig. 3B). Consistent with the data obtained by mutation analysis (Fig. 3A), these results strongly suggest that the Arg-5 and Lys-110 residues are essential contact points between the two homotrimers of a PCNA doublet. It is interesting to note that the inhibition of double trimer formation by the aforementioned two peptides was only effective with cell extracts using hypotonic buffer containing 15 mm NaCl (Fig. 3B) and was not effective in the cells extracted with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 150 mm NaCl (data not shown). This result suggests that PCNA normally exists as a double trimer complex in physiologic salt concentrations. Although the complex may be loose and dynamic, it cannot be easily disrupted by short synthetic peptides under physiological salt conditions. The Formation of a PCNA Double Trimer Complex May Be Essential for Proliferation and Survival in Mammalian Cells—To gain insights into the effects of double trimer disruption in mammalian cells, we transfected CHO cells with wild type or the R5A/K110A double mutant construct. (Note that the amino acid sequences of hamster and human PCNA proteins are identical except for three residues.) We found that ∼5 and 35% of cells transfected by wild type and the mutant construct, respectively, exhibited a “rounded-up” phenotype 24 h post-transfection (Fig. 4, A and B). By 48 h post-transfection, the rates of rounded cells were 10 and 70% for cells transfected by wild type and R5A/K110A mutant, respectively. Flow cytometry showed that the rounded cells by R5A/K110A transfection were arrested in G0/G1 and died within a few days. However, most of the rounded cells in the wild-type PCNA-transfected population were normal mitotic cells and did not die. We also found that a R5A or K110A single mutant showed similar effects to the R5A/K110A double mutant (data not shown). These data, together with those shown in Fig. 3, suggest that Arg-5 and Lys-110 are essential for a double trimer formation and mammalian cell growth and survival. A Back-to-Back PCNA Double Trimer Complex, but Not a Homotrimer Alone, Can Simultaneously Accommodate Both DNA Polymerase δ and CAF-1—The front side and outer surface of the PCNA trimer can bind to many different proteins, including pol δ and CAF-1 (1.Tsurimoto T.

Almouzni G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1206-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). It was previously suggested that the back side might be involved in the regulation of various PCNA functions by interacting with other regulatory proteins (6.Fukuda K. Morioka H. Imajou S. Ikeda S. Ohtsuka E. Tsurimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22527-22534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, there is no direct evidence that any protein binds to the back side of the PCNA homotrimer. A back-to-back double trimer model can explain why no proteins normally bind to the back side of the PCNA trimer ring. In addition, the availability of two front sides in the trimer doublet to allow protein binding makes it possible for one PCNA complex to simultaneously “coordinate” multiple functions such as DNA replication, repair, and cell-cycle control (5.Maga G. Hubscher U. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3051-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we used a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to analyze the potential of PCNA on the chromatin to interact simultaneously with pol δ and CAF-1. We found that PCNA, CAF-1, and pol δ were present on chromatin in close proximity (data not shown). To determine whether PCNA can physically bind to pol δ and CAF-1 simultaneously, extracts prepared from cells transfected by wild-type PCNA were subjected to DNase I digestion and immunoprecipitated with PC10. The PCNA complexes in the precipitate were dissociated from the antibody beads and then were subjected to a second immunoprecipitation with an anti-pol δ antibody. The final precipitate, which was expected to be a PCNA·pol δ complex, was subjected to SDS-PAGE separation. The proteins on the membrane were then analyzed by sequential immunostaining without stripping off the previous antibodies with anti-CAF-1 (Fig. 4C, lane 1), -pol δ (lane 2), and PC10 (lane 3) antibodies. These data showed that the PCNA·pol δ complex also contained CAF-1 (Fig. 3C, lane 3), strongly suggesting that pol δ and CAF-1 are simultaneously associated with PCNA. To further confirm this result, we compared the binding patterns of CAF-1 and pol δ between wild type and mutant PCNA. The CAF-1 complexes were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal anti-CAF-1 (p150 subunit) antibody from cells transfected with either the wild type or the R5A/K110A mutant construct. The CAF-1 complexes were then analyzed by SDS-Western blot analysis using antibodies against pol δ (p125 subunit), CAF-1 (p150 subunit), or PCNA (i.e. PC10). The authenticity of the bands representing these proteins in the immunoprecipitates was verified by comparing with the immunostaining patterns of samples prepared from total protein extracts (Fig. 4, D–F, lanes 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, and 10) and immunoprecipitates (lanes 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, and 12). As expected, the p150 subunit of CAF-1 was present in the total extracts and the immunoprecipitate prepared from the cells transfected by the wild type or the mutant construct (Fig. 4D, lanes 1–4). Significantly, the CAF-1 complex immunoprecipitated from the cells transfected with wild-type PCNA also contained pol δ (Fig. 4E, lane 7). In contrast, the CAF-1 complex immunoprecipitated from cells transfected by the R5A/K110A mutant construct did not contain pol δ (Fig. 4E, lane 8), although wild type and the R5A/K110A mutant apparently have similar binding affinity for CAF-1 (Fig. 4F, lanes 11 and 12). It is therefore clear that PCNA homotrimers can bind either pol δ or CAF-1 (complex) but not both. Because the wild-type PCNA can form a back-to-back double trimer complex, it can accommodate both pol δ and CAF-1. However, the R5A/K110A mutant cannot form a double trimer complex and, therefore, cannot simultaneously accommodate both pol δ and CAF-1. This set of data, along with Fig. 4C, confirms that wild-type PCNA, but not the R5A/K110A mutant, can simultaneously accommodate CAF-1 and pol δ through PCNA double trimer formation. Although a PCNA trimer contains three identical surfaces to accommodate proteins with PCNA-binding motifs, the binding to a given protein (complex) appears to occur in a competitive manner at the expense of other PCNA-binding proteins (6.Fukuda K.

Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). This is probably because one PCNA-associating protein (complex) can occupy most of the PCNA homotrimer surface as in the case of the interaction between a PCNA homotrimer and DNA ligase 1 (30.Pascal J.M. O'Brien P.J. Tomkinson A.E. Ellenberger T. Nature. 2004; 432: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). It should be noted that both pol δ and CAF-1 are quite large and comprise at least four (p125, p60, p50, and p12) and three subunits (p150, p60, and p48), respectively. Therefore, one PCNA homotrimer could not physically interact with both the pol δ and CAF-1 complexes. A Functional Model of Mammalian PCNA—The βD2βE2 loop forms a handle-like structure that protrudes from the PCNA homotrimer back side (8.Krishna T.S. Kong X.P. Gary S. Burgers P.M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1994; 79: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). This could make it difficult for Arg-5 on one trimer to closely interact with Lys-110 on the other trimer. Furthermore, formaldehyde is a tight homobifunctional amine cross-linker that requires less than a 2-Å distance between the two amino acid residues (31.Orlando V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 99-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). However, it may be possible that sufficient proximity between Arg-5 and Lys-110 is achieved by a “locking-in” of the two PCNA trimers through loops and grooves. Consistent with this idea, topological analysis using the Hex program predicts that the lock-in can occur if the two trimers rotate slightly so that the βD2βE2 loop (Fig. 5B, L) of one trimer fits into a nearby groove around αA1 (amino acids 9–20, GSILKKVLEALK), αB2 (amino acids 209–211, LRYLNFFTKATPL), βH2 (amino acids 235–241, LVVEYKI), and βI2 (254GHLKYYL) of the second trimer (Fig. 5B, *). By this lock-in, Arg-5 and Lys-110 could be in sufficiently close proximity to be cross-linked by formaldehyde. Henderson et al. (32.Henderson D.S. Wiegand U.K. Norman D.G. Glover D.M. Genetics. 2000; 154: 1721-1733PubMed Google Scholar) argued that their data, which was obtained from Drosophila PCNA genetic studies, could make sense only if two PCNA trimer rings formed a back-to-back complex. Overall, our data provides direct evidence to support their speculation. This back-to-back double trimer model predicts that many cellular functions such as epigenetic control, DNA methylation, and mismatch repair processes are tightly coupled with DNA replication via the PCNA doublet complex.

https://openalex.org/W2050369011,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a malignant disorder of the hematopoietic stem cell characterized by the BCR-ABL oncogene. We examined gene expression profiles of highly enriched CD34(+) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from patients with CML in chronic phase using cDNA arrays covering 1.185 genes. Comparing CML CD34(+) cells with normal CD34(+) cells, we found 158 genes which were significantly differentially expressed. Gene expression patterns reflected BCR-ABL-induced functional alterations such as increased cell-cycle and proteasome activity. Detoxification enzymes and DNA repair proteins were downregulated in CML CD34(+) cells, which might contribute to genetic instability. Decreased expression of junction plakoglobulin and CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR-4) might facilitate the release of immature precursors from bone marrow in CML. GATA-2 was upregulated in CML CD34(+) cells, suggesting an increased self-renewal in comparison with normal CD34(+) cells. Moreover, we found upregulation of the proto-oncogene SKI and of receptors for neuromediators such as opioid mu1 receptor, GABA B receptor, adenosine A1 receptor, orexin 1 and 2 receptors and corticotropine-releasing hormone receptor. Treatment of CML progenitor cells with the selective adenosine A1 receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX) resulted in a dose-dependent significant inhibition of clonogenic growth by 40% at a concentration of 10(-5) M, which could be reversed by the equimolar addition of the receptor agonist 2-chloro-N6-cyclopentyladenosine (P<0.05). The incubation of normal progenitor cells with DPCPX resulted in an inhibition of clonogenic growth to a significantly lesser extent in comparison with CML cells (P<0.05), suggesting that the adenosine A1 receptor is of functional relevance in CML hematopoietic progenitor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2070453614,"FRA-1, a member of the FOS family of transcription factors, is overexpressed in a variety of human tumors, and contributes to tumor progression. In addition to mitogens, various toxicants and carcinogens persistently induce FRA-1 expression in vitro and in vivo. Although the mitogen induced expression of c-FOS is relatively well understood, it is poorly defined in the case of FRA-1. Our recent analysis of the FRA-1 promoter has shown a critical role for a TRE located at -318 in mediating the TPA-induced expression. The -379 to -283 bp promoter segment containing a critical TRE (-318), however, is insufficient for the induction of FRA-1 promoter. Here, we show that a 40-bp (-276/-237) segment, comprising a TCF binding site and the CArG box (collectively known as serum response element, SRE), and an ATF site, is also necessary for the FRA-1 induction by TPA and EGF. Interestingly, the -283 to +32 bp FRA-1 promoter fragment containing an SRE and an ATF site alone was also insufficient to confer TPA sensitivity to a reporter gene. However, in association with the -318 TRE, the SRE and ATF sites imparted a strong TPA-inducibility to the reporter. Similarly, EGF also required these motifs for the full induction of this gene. Using ChIP assays we show that, in contrast to c-Jun, SRF, Elk1, ATF1 and CREB proteins bind to SRE and ATF sites of the FRA-1 promoter, constitutively. RNAi-mediated knockdown of endogenous SRF, ELK1 and c-JUN protein expression significantly reduced TPA-stimulated FRA-1 promoter activity. Thus, a bipartite enhancer formed by an upstream TRE and the downstream SRE and ATF sites and the cognate factors is necessary and sufficient for the regulation of FRA-1 in response to mitogens."
https://openalex.org/W2018627787,"Since radiation-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis and ROS generation were partially prevented by HSP25 overexpression, similar to the treatment of control cells with antioxidant agents such as DPI and tiron, questions arise whether radiation-mediated ROS generation contributes to the apoptotic cell death, and also whether HSP25 overexpression can reduce ROS mediated apoptotic cell death. In the present study, radiation-induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria and activation of caspases accompanied by a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential in Jurkat T cells were shown to be inhibited by mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone, suggesting that mitochondrial ROS might be important in radiation-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. When HSP25 was overexpressed, effects similar to the treatment of cells with the antioxidants were obtained, indicating that HSP25 suppressed radiation-induced mitochondrial alteration that resulted in apoptosis. Furthermore, activation of p38 MAP kinase by radiation was associated with radiation-induced cell death and ROS production and PKCdelta was an upstream molecule for p38 MAP kinase activation, ROS generation and subsequent caspase-dependent apoptotic events. However, in the HSP25 overexpressed cells, the above-described effects were blocked. In fact, radiation-induced membrane translocation of PKCdelta and tyrosine phosphorylation were inhibited by HSP25. Based on the above data, we suggest that HSP25 downregulates PKCdelta, which is a key molecule for radiation-induced ROS generation and mitochondrial-mediated caspase-dependent apoptotic events."
https://openalex.org/W2118223144,"The degradation of von Willebrand factor (VWF) depends on the activity of a zinc protease (referred to as ADAMTS-13), which cleaves VWF at the Tyr1605-Met1606 peptide bond. Little information is available on the physiological mechanisms involved in regulation of AD-AMTS-13 activity. In this study, the role of ions on the ADAMTS-13/VWF interaction was investigated. In the presence of 1.5 m urea, the protease cleaved multimeric VWF in the absence of NaCl at pH 8.00 and 37 °C, with an apparent kcat/Km ≅ 3.4 × 104 m-1 s-1, but this value decreased by ∼10-fold in the presence of 0.15 m NaCl. Using several monovalent salts, the inhibitory effect was attributed mostly to anions, whose potency was inversely related to the corresponding Jones-Dole viscosity B coefficients (CIO4−>CI−>F−). The specific inhibitory effect of anions was due to their binding to VWF, which caused a conformational change responsible for quenching the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein and reducing tyrosine exposition to bulk solvent. Ristocetin binding to VWF could reduce the apparent affinity and reverse the inhibitory effect of chloride. We hypothesize that, after secretion into the extracellular compartment, VWF is bound by chloride ions abundantly present in this milieu, becoming unavailable to proteolysis by AD-AMTS-13.

VWF is synthesized in vascular endothelial cells and megakaryocytes and is present in these cells, plasma, and the subendothelial matrices. VWF is initially released into circulating blood as ultra-large multimeric forms, which are more hemostatically active than the smaller multimeric forms but are rapidly degraded into smaller multimeric forms ranging in size from 500 to 20,000 kDa in normal human plasma (1Sadler J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 395-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Degradation depends on the presence of the von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease ADAMTS-13, which cleaves VWF at the peptide bond between residues Tyr1605 and Met1606 (2Chung D.W. Fujikawa K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11065-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the past few years, several studies have clearly shown the involvement of ultra-large VWF and ADAMTS-13 in the occurrence of the syndrome referred to as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, which is characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and neurologic signs and other symptoms related to widespread formation of platelet thrombi in the microcirculation. Ultra-large VWFs are often present in the plasma of patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, due to the deficiency of ADAMTS-13 activity caused by an acquired auto-antibody against this metalloprotease (3Furlan M.

The abnormal presence of ultra-large VWF in plasma is thought to cause widespread platelet aggregation in the microcirculation and thrombus formation, which underlies the pathogenesis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. In contrast with other zinc proteases, such as the matrix metalloproteases, ADAMTS-13 does not need activation by other hydrolases to become proteolytically competent toward VWF (2Chung D.W. Fujikawa K. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11065-11070Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). VWF hydrolysis can be obtained in vitro under mild denaturing conditions, which generate partially unfolded VWF conformers that are susceptible to proteolytic attack by AD-AMTS-13. Moreover, early studies by Furlan et al. (7Furlan M. Robles R. Lämmle B. Blood. 1996; 87: 4223-4234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) on the specificity of the ADAMTS-13/VWF interaction showed that physiological concentrations of NaCl inhibit hydrolysis of VWF. Based on this observation, current functional assays that measure ADAMTS-13 activity are carried out either in the absence of NaCl or at very low NaCl concentrations (7Furlan M. Robles R. Lämmle B. Blood. 1996; 87: 4223-4234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Gerritsen H.E. Turecek P.L. Schwarz H.P. Lämmle B. Furlan M. Thromb.

Taken together, these observations prompted us to further investigate the effect of different ions on ADAMTS-13 interactions with VWF, in order to elucidate the mechanisms of control of ADAMTS-13 enzymatic activity under physiological conditions. Cell Culture and Stable Transfection—A pCDNA 3.1 expression vector (kindly provided by Dr. F. Scheiflinger; Baxter Bioscience, Vienna, Austria) containing the entire coding region and a small part of the 3′-untranslated region of the ADAMTS-13 gene (pCDNA 3.1-ADAMTS-13-WT) was used for stable transfection experiments. Human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium enriched with nutrient mixture F-12 (DMEM F-12) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/L l-glutamine, and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Approximately 5 × 106 HEK293 cells were transfected with 50 μg of pCDNA 3.1-ADAMTS-13-WT by electroporation with an Easyject Plus (Equibio-Celbio, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For selection, the medium was supplemented with 450 μg/ml Geneticin G418 sulfate (Invitrogen). Serum-free conditioned medium was applied to equivalent numbers of confluent cells and collected at 96 h. The functional activity of recombinant ADAMTS-13 was measured in the conditioned media of the transfected cells, using the previously described collagen binding activity (CBA) assay (8Gerritsen H.E. Turecek P.L. Schwarz H.P. Lämmle B. Furlan M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 1386-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and quantifying collagen-bound VWF with a commercial kit (Gradipore Ltd., French Forest, New South Wales, Australia) (10Favaloro E.J. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 2000; 114: 608-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The medium of untransfected cells was used as a negative control. Purification of Recombinant ADAMTS-13—Recombinant AD-AMTS-13 (rADAMTS-13) was purified from cell supernatants according to a previously described method (11Fujikawa K. Suzuki H. McMullen B. Chung D. Blood. 2001; 98: 1662-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. The ammonium sulfate precipitate (33%) was applied at room temperature to a butyl-Sepharose column (1.2 × 6 cm; Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. The eluted fractions were pooled, and ammonium sulfate was added to 40% saturation. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, dissolved in ∼3 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), gently stirred for 1 h with 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 5 mm iodoacetamide, and applied to a DG10 Bio-Rad column previously equilibrated with 50 mm MES-NaOH (pH 6.6)/0.1 m NaCl with one buffer change. The sample was further purified by heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography and DEAE ion exchange chromatography (1.5 × 10 cm), as previously described (11Fujikawa K. Suzuki H. McMullen B. Chung D. Blood. 2001; 98: 1662-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Purity was tested by SDS-PAGE using a 4–15% acrylamide gradient under reducing and nonreducing conditions. The band corresponding in the SDS-PAGE to the species with a molecular mass of 190 kDa was blotted, and N-terminal sequencing was performed using an automatic liquid phase sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences model 477A) connected to a high pressure liquid chromatography apparatus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences model 120A, phenyl-thio-hydantoin analyzer) and to a Bio-Rad reverse-phase C18 column. Identification of the cleavage products was based upon the known amino acid sequences of human ADAMTS-13 (11Fujikawa K. Suzuki H. McMullen B. Chung D. Blood. 2001; 98: 1662-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The concentration of the purified enzyme was determined using an E(280 nm) (mg/ml, 1 cm) = 1.45, based on the protein composition. Purification of VWF—Purified VWF was obtained from either a therapeutic factor VIII/VWF plasma concentrate (Fahndi, Grifols, Pisa, Italy) or as a recombinant preparation (a generous gift of Dr. Peter Turecek; Baxter Bioscience, Vienna). VWF purification was obtained using a two-step procedure, in which 5 ml of the reconstituted plasma concentrate at a concentration of 3000 units/ml in 5 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl (pH 8.00) at 25 °C was percolated through a 2 × 70-cm column containing Sephacril S-500 gel (Amersham Biosciences) to eliminate human albumin and other proteins. The peak containing VWF was further purified on a heparin-Sepharose column, using a NaCl concentration gradient (100–290 mm in 60 min) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The last peak to be eluted (200 mm NaCl) was pooled and further analyzed. SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions in 4–15% gradient gels showed the presence of a single band with an approximate molecular mass of 250 kDa. Assay of VWF-cleaving Protease Activity by CBA Assay for Kinetic Studies in the Presence of Urea—The VWF substrate was prepared by resuspending the purified preparation in 1.5 m urea, 5 mm Tris (pH 8.0). Digestion of VWF by rADAMTS-13 was investigated as a function of the enzyme concentration and different salts. rADAMTS-13 (2.5 μm in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 280 mm NaCl) was diluted with 1.5 m urea, 5 mm Tris (pH 8.0). Aliquots of 50 μl were then incubated with 5 μl of 93 mm BaCl2 (3 mm, final concentration) and 100 μl of VWF substrate for 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min at 37 °C to achieve degradation of VWF. The final concentrations of rADAMTS-13 were 13.25, 6.6, 3.3, and 1.6 nm. After stopping the digestion by adding 10 μl of 0.825 m Na2SO4, the incubation mixtures were centrifuged for 8 min at 2500 × g, and supernatants were used for the CBA assay of digested VWF substrate as described above (8Gerritsen H.E. Turecek P.L. Schwarz H.P. Lämmle B. Furlan M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 1386-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Absorbance was read at 450 nm using a reference filter at 620 nm on Benchmark Plus (Bio-Rad). The same method was carried out with rADAMTS-13 at a final concentration of 6.7 nm in presence of various concentrations (151, 76, 38.5, 19.75, 10.375, 5.68, 3.34, and 1 mm) of different salts to change both cations and anions (NaCl, NaF, NaClO4, tetramethylammonium chloride, and CsCl). The final concentrations of Na+ and Cl- were also checked potentiometrically by a Hitachi 717 automated analyzer (Roche Applied Science). In some experiments, BaCl2 was replaced by Ba(COO)2 at the same final concentration of 3 mm to investigate the potential effect of chloride present in the barium salt. Assay of VWF-cleaving Protease Activity by CBA Assay for Kinetic Studies in the Presence of Ristocetin—The CBA assay was also applied to evaluate the conformational effects induced in VWF molecules by ristocetin instead of urea. Accordingly, different concentrations of ristocetin (0.6, 0.8, 1, 1.2, and 1.5 mg/ml) were used in absence and presence of different concentrations of NaCl, NaF, and NaClO4 (ranging from ∼1 to 300 mm). To avoid ristocetin (sulfate salt) precipitation in the presence of BaCl2 used in the CBA assay, pretreatment of the ristocetin sulfate preparation (Helena Laboratories Corp., Beaumont, TX) with stoichiometric amounts of BaCl2 or Ba(ClO4)2 (with respect to lyophilized ristocetin) was always carried out to eliminate sulfate ions. Briefly, ristocetin was suspended in buffer at a final concentration of 15–20 mg/ml. The molarity of the ristocetin solution was calculated using a molecular mass value of 2166 Da. A stoichiometric amount of BaCl2 or Ba(ClO4)2 was then added, and the precipitated barium-sulfate was eliminated by centrifugation of the sample at 4000 × g for 15 min. The concentration of de-sulfated ristocetin in the supernatant was then calculated spectrophotometrically at 280 nm, using 4.41 as the extinction coefficient (0.1%, w/v). An aliquot of this solution was also used to check the presence of potentially contaminating sulfate ions by adding an excess of BaCl2: in no instance was further sulfate precipitation observed. The de-sulfated ristocetin was then used for the functional experiments that evaluated the activity of ADAMTS-13 toward VWF. Assay of VWF-cleaving Protease Activity by Electrophoretic Analysis of the Distribution of VWF—The VWF-cleaving protease activity of ADAMTS-13 was also evaluated using a modification of the immunoblotting assay described by Furlan et al. (7Furlan M. Robles R. Lämmle B. Blood. 1996; 87: 4223-4234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant form of VWF and plasma-derived ADAMTS-13 were used in these experiments. Citrated plasma samples were re-centrifuged at 2000 × g for 15 min and diluted 1:20 with a solution of 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm Pefablock. The protease was activated by preincubation with 10 mm BaCl2 for 5 min at 37 °C. 100 μl of the activated protease solution was immediately added to 50 μl of recombinant VWF (5 units/ml) and applied on the surface of a hydrophilic filter (VSWP; Millipore) floating on 50 ml of dialysis buffer (1.5 m urea, 5 mm Tris (pH 8)). The influence of different anions (F-, Cl-, and CIO4−) on the activity of ADAMTS-13 was evaluated by dialyzing the samples against 1.5 m urea, 5 mm Tris (pH 8) in the presence of 75 mm NaF, NaCl, or NaClO4. After 6 and 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, reaction mixtures were removed from the surface of membrane filters, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μlof0.2 m EDTA (pH 7.4) electrophoretically run on a low resolution, and the mixtures were then subjected to SDS-agarose gel to determine the multimeric pattern. The samples were run on a SE600 vertical electrophoresis system with 1.5 mm spacers (Amersham Biosciences), and the buffer system and gel composition were as described by Raines et al. (12Raines G. Aumann H. Sykes S. Street A. Thromb. Res. 1990; 60: 201-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Glycerol was also included in the agarose (Seakem HGT(P), BMA Rockland, ME) to reduce diffusion of the protein bands. A 1-cm-high 20% acrylamide plug (acr/bis 29:1) with 10% glycerol, 0.04% ammonium persulfate, and 0.08% TEMED in separating buffer was poured into the bottom of the gel sandwich and overlaid with a layer of water. After polymerization, a 13-cm-high separating gel (0.6% agarose, 30% glycerol in separating buffer) and a 0.7-cm-high stacking gel (0.6% agarose, 10% glycerol in stacking buffer) were poured into the gel sandwich. After the insertion of a 15-well comb (well depth, 0.7 cm), sample wells were formed pouring a cathode gel (1% agarose, 10% glycerol in cathode buffer). Samples were diluted in sample buffer, incubated at 60 °C for 20 min, and directly loaded on the gel. Electrophoresis was run at 18 mA constant current and at a temperature of 18 °C. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore) for detection by luminography according to Schneppenheim et al. (13Schneppenheim R. Lenk H. Obser T. Oldenburg J. Oyen F. Schneppenheim S. Schwaab R. Will K. Budde U. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2004; 92: 36-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfer was carried out overnight using a Trans-Blot Cell (Bio-Rad) at 15 °C and at a constant voltage of 12 V. For visualization of transblotted VWF, the membranes were blocked, incubated with the first antibody (1:2500; rabbit anti-human VWF from Dako) and second goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:3000; Bio-Rad) and treated with a luminol-iodophenol solution. The membrane was exposed to x-ray films (Hyperfilm ECL; Amersham Biosciences) or alternatively scanned with Typhoon System (Amersham Biosciences). Fluorescence Studies—Steady-state fluorescence titration measurements were carried out as described previously (14Di Stasio E. Bizzarri P. Misiti F. Pavoni E. Brancaccio A. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 107: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 15Griffon N. Di Stasio E. Biophys. Chem. 2001; 90: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) on purified VWF. Fluorescence emission spectra (λex = 280 nm) were recorded at 25 °C in a 1-cm quartz cell, using a Spex (Edison, NJ) FluoroMax spectrofluorometer, in 5 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and increasing amounts of salts (NaCl, NaF, and NaClO4) or unfractionated porcine heparin (100 units/mg; Calbiochem) with a mean molecular mass of 14.5 kDa. Any background signal (fluorescence or scattered light) from the buffer was subtracted, and fluorescence intensity was corrected for the progressive protein dilution (14Di Stasio E. Bizzarri P. Misiti F. Pavoni E. Brancaccio A. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 107: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 15Griffon N. Di Stasio E. Biophys. Chem. 2001; 90: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The decrease in fluorescence signal, usually defined as “bleaching effect,” due to the iterative exposure of the sample to the high intensity light beam, was restricted to <5% of the initial intensity. Second Derivative UV Spectroscopy—All measurements were conducted at least in duplicate at 25 ± 0.2 °C in 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). Protein concentration was determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm on a double beam Varian model Cary 2200 spectrophotometer (Palo Alto, CA), using extinction coefficients (ϵ) calculated on the basis of the amino acid composition. The ϵ values for VWF (as monomer) and rADAMTS-13 were taken as 0.44 and 1.45 ml/mg cm, respectively. The proteins used in these experiments had an absorbance value of ≈0.2 at 280 nm. The average exposure (α) of tyrosine residues to solvent in the VWF and ADAMTS-13 structures was calculated according to the method of Ragone et al. (16Ragone R. Colonna G. Balestrieri C. Servillo L. Irace G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), under 0 and 150 mm NaCl, NaClO4, and NaF. The unfolded state of the proteins was obtained in the presence of 6 m urea in 5 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0). The purification procedure described yielded a single component of ∼190 kDa (Fig. 1). In some preparations, a band at ≅90 kDa was also observed, perhaps an auto-hydrolytic product of ADAMTS-13 at the C terminus, because the same N-terminal sequence AAGGILHLGLLVAVG was observed in the two bands. The preparations containing >10% of the 90-kDa form were not used in the kinetic experiments. In the most abundant preparations, a minor band slightly above the major band of 190 kDa was also observed. The N-terminal sequence of this component was MHQRHPRA, suggesting that human embryonic kidney cells secrete an aliquot of ADAMTS-13 containing the signal peptide (11Fujikawa K. Suzuki H. McMullen B. Chung D. Blood. 2001; 98: 1662-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The major 190-kDa component had a specific activity toward VWF of 100 ± 10%/μg enzyme, as demonstrated by CBA assay, using pooled normal plasma from 50 healthy individuals as reference. ADAMTS-13 at concentrations ranging from 1.6 to 13.3 nm yielded a pseudo-first order kinetics of VWF hydrolysis. Fig. 2 shows that kinetic curves were fitted to a single exponential decay equation, allowing us to obtain pseudo-first order rate constants. If this rate constant is actually under pseudo first-order conditions, i.e. VWF << Km, then doubling VWF concentrations should not change the value of the rate constant, and these values should be linearly related to enzyme concentration. These pseudo-first order conditions were met because 6.6 or 13.2 μg/ml VWF (taken as monomeric species) was hydrolyzed by ADAMTS-13 with the same k value, i.e. ∼3 × 10-4 s-1 (data not shown). Moreover, the observed pseudo-first order rate constants were linearly correlated to ADAMTS-13 concentrations allowing calculation of the kcat/Km value on the basis of the relation: kobs = e0 kcat/Km (17Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1985: 105-106Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that under the experimental conditions of 1 mm NaCl, the kcat/Km value was equal to 3.4 ± 0.13 × 104 m-1 s-1. Fig. 2 also shows that increasing the concentrations of NaCl from 1 to 150 mm caused a severe reduction of the hydrolysis rate, which decreased ≅10-fold at the highest salt concentration. Because this finding suggests a strong dependence of VWF/ADAMTS-13 interaction on the ionic strength of the solution, we chose to investigate the dependence of this interaction on different salts, changing both the cation and the anion. NaCl, NaF, NaClO4, CsCl, and tetramethylammonium chloride at different concentrations were used to study the kinetics of VWF cleavage by ADAMTS-13. Fig. 3 shows that a Debye-Hückel plot of the experimental data yielded a slope of -3.3, which is among the highest values reported in the literature for protein-protein interactions (18Baerga-Ortiz A. Rezaie A.R. Komives E.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, the data reported in Fig. 3 showed that the salts used in these experiments had effects linked to the presence of specific anions. Whereas different cationic chloride salts caused similar effects on the kinetics of VWF/ADAMTS-13 interactions (see Fig. 4A), the change of the anionic component in sodium salts gave different magnitudes of effect (Fig. 4B). This finding raised the question of whether or not specific anion binding to either ADAMTS-13 or VWF (or both) might generate this negative effect. The pseudo-first order rate constants (kobs) of VWF cleavage were analyzed as a function of the individual anion concentration (A), using a simple scheme whereby one anion binding to one of the interacting proteins is able to completely suppress the ADAMTS-13/VWF interactions; accordingly, kobs=k∘/[1+[A/Kd]](Eq. 1) where k° is the rate constant in the absence of salt, and Kd is the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant of anion binding. The calculated Kd values followed the order Kd(ClO4) < Kd(Cl) < Kd(F), (Fig. 4B), indicating that the apparent affinity of fluoride is lower than that of chloride, which in turn has a lower affinity than perchlorate ion. In the inset of Fig. 4B, the values of the apparent equilibrium dissociation constants calculated at 37 °C for F-, Cl-, and CIO4− are plotted as a function of the respective Jones-Dole viscosity B coefficients (19Collins K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5553-5557Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The plot shows that there is a definite inverse relationship between these parameters, corroborating the concept that the inhibitory effect of anions results from specific binding regulated by the physico-chemical nature of the anion involved.Fig. 4A, experimental values of the pseudo-first order rates of VWF (6.6 μg/ml) cleavage by ADAMTS-13 (6.7 nm) as a function of NaCl (▵), CsCl (•), and tetramethylammonium chloride (□) at 37 °C and pH 8.00. Lines were drawn according to the best-fit parameter values of Eq. 1. Cs+, Kd = 29 ± 9 mm; Na+, Kd = 32 ± 10 mm; tetramethylammonium, Kd = 29 ± 8 mm. B, experimental values of the pseudo-first order rates of VWF cleavage by AD-AMTS-13 as a function of NaCl (○), NaF (•), and NaClO4 (□). Lines were drawn according to the best-fit parameter values of Eq. 1. F-, Kd = 48 ± 15 mm (long-dashed line); Cl-, Kd = 32 ± 12 mm (solid line); ClO4, Kd = 16 ± 4 mm (short-dashed line). In the inset, the values of the apparent equilibrium dissociation binding constant of the different anions are plotted as a function of the Jones-Dole viscosity B coefficients (20Cacace M.G. Landau E.M. Ramdsen J.J. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1997; 30: 241-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). The straight line is a linear regression with the r value indicated in the figure, and slope = 0.189 ± 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Control experiments were also carried out to check whether or not the presence of chloride present as BaCl2 could affect the measurement of the apparent Kd of chloride binding This was not the case, because the kinetics of VWF hydrolysis in the presence of added NaCl at concentrations of either 1 or 150 mm was almost the same when BaCl2 was replaced by Ba(COO)2 (the latter salt was chosen because its solubility is much higher than that of BaF2), as shown in Fig. 5. This implies that the small amount (3 mm) of chloride present as BaCl2 was much lower than the corresponding Kd of its binding; the experimental assay was not able to detect the effect of this small amount of additional chloride, which was, however, taken into consideration for the fitting procedures of experimental data involving chloride ion. On the basis of both the differential effect and the magnitude of the apparent Kd values, we presume that the contribution of ionic strength to the observed inhibition of ADAMTS-13/VWF interaction is actually negligible. The phenomenological effect of anions was specific and linked to the chemical nature of the anion involved. The potency series indicated above is compatible with the Hofmeister series (20Cacace M.G. Landau E.M. Ramdsen J.J. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1997; 30: 241-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). In the majority of cases, the positions of ions in the Hofmeister series correspond to the degree of their hydration (21Zavitsas A. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2001; 105: 7805-7817Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Accordingly, small ions of high charge density bind water tightly, whereas large monovalent ions of low charge density bind water weakly, relative to water-water interaction strength: this is expressed by the Jones-Dole viscosity B coefficients (19Collins K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5553-5557Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). However, the relative position in the series should be considered as indicative only because there will be considerable variation depending on type of protein, pH, temperature, and ion pair effects (22Lo Nostro P. Fratoni L.U. Ninham B.W. Baglioni P. Biomacromolecules. 2002; 3: 1217-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recent findings showed that binding to platelet GpIbα accelerates the hydrolysis of VWF by ADAMTS-13 (23Nishio K. Anderson P.J. Zheng X.L. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10578-10583Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). With this as background, we chose to investigate whether or not the negative linkage between anion binding and kinetics of VWF cleavage by ADAMTS-13 was influenced by another allosteric effector of VWF such as ristocetin. This molecule is known to trigger, upon specific binding to the A1 domain (24Matsushita T. Meyer D. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Ch"
https://openalex.org/W1978364451,"The controversial issue of protein phosphorylation from the photosynthetic apparatus of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has been reinvestigated using new detection tools that include various immunological and in vivo labeling approaches. The set of phosphoproteins detected with these methods includes ferredoxin-NADPH reductase and the linker proteins of the phycobilisome antenna. Using mutants that lack a specific set of linker proteins and are affected in phycobilisome assembly, we show that the phosphoproteins from the phycobilisomes correspond to the membrane, rod, and rod-core linkers. These proteins are in a phosphorylated state within the assembled phycobilisomes. Their dephosphorylation requires partial disassembly of the phycobilisomes and further contributes to their complete disassembly in vitro. In vivo we observed linker dephosphorylation upon long-term exposure to higher light intensities and under nitrogen limitation, two conditions that lead to remodeling and turnover of phycobilisomes. We conclude that this phosphorylation process is instrumental in the regulation of assembly/disassembly of phycobilisomes and should participate in signaling for their proteolytic cleavage and degradation."

Unfortunately, an effective therapeutic regimen is still lacking for advance stages of the disease. Recently, MEK5 has been shown to overexpress in prostate cancer and is associated with poor survival outcome. MEK5 exists as α- and β-isoforms. MEK5α induces cell proliferation by activating its downstream molecules, whereas MEK5β expression is associated with inhibition of cell growth. We have recently shown that exogenous expression of c-myc promoter-binding protein 1 (MBP-1) induces prostate cancer cell death (Ghosh, A. K., Steele, R., and Ray, R. B. (2005) Cancer Res. 65, 718–721). In this study, we have investigated whether inhibition of MEK5 signaling pathway can modulate prostate cancer cell growth. MBP-1 is a general transcriptional repressor and modulates a number of cellular genes. Therefore, we examined the endogenous expression status of MEK5 in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells upon recombinant adenovirus-mediated introduction of MBP-1. Our results demonstrated that MBP-1 expression reduced the endogenous MEK5α protein level; on the other hand, MEK5β expression was enhanced significantly. Transduction of MBP-1 modulates the downstream signaling molecules of MEK5, such as activation of the cyclin D1 promoter and MEF2C transcriptional activities in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. MBP-1 expression also modulates MEK5-mediated activation of NF-κB. Further analysis suggested that MBP-1 physically associates with MEK5 and induces proteasome-mediated degradation of the MEK5 protein, which appears to occur independently of ubiquitination.

Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among males in the United States. The American Cancer Society estimates that ∼11% of the male population in the United States will develop invasive prostate cancer in their lifetime (1.American Cancer SocietySurveillance Research: Cancer Facts and Figures. American Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA2002Google Scholar). Although the survival rates for prostate cancer are good upon early diagnosis, the treatments for advanced disease are limited. Androgen ablation techniques generally allow temporary remission of the disease. As androgen-independent prostate cancer cells eventually lead to death (2.Isaacs W.B. Cancer Surv. 1995; 25: 357PubMed Google Scholar), successful strategies to modify the biological behavior of these cells may potentially have the most significant clinical impact.The signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation, survival, and transformation are of prime interest in cancer biology.

Upon activation, the MAPKs selectively phosphorylate cellular targets, leading to regulation of gene expression and biologic events such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Although delineation of the role of several MAPKs has been actively investigated, the function of the MEK5 and its downstream molecule, BMK1 (also called ERK5) pathway, has just begun to be defined. BMK1 has been shown to be the target for MEK5, which activates transcription factors involved in cellular stress responses (4.Abe J.-I. Kusuhara M. Ulevitch R.J. Berk B.C. Lee J.D. J. Biol.

Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). MEK5 has two splice variants, MEK5α and MEK5β, and both variants have distinct tissue-wide distribution and cellular localization (7.English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Xu S. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

MBP-1, an ∼37-kDa cellular protein, has many intriguing properties such as transcriptional repressor activity, induction of apoptosis, and regression of tumor growth (8.Ray R. Miller D.M. Mol. Cell.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2775-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis suggests that MBP-1 has a high homology with Eno1 cDNA (8.Ray R. Miller D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2154-2161Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), designated as human α-enolase cDNA (16.Giallongo A. Feo S. Moore R. Croce C.M. Showe L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recent reports suggest that a 37-Da protein is alternatively translated from Eno1 cDNA, which binds and down-regulates c-myc P2 promoter activity (17.Feo S. Arcuri D. Piddini E. Passantino R.

Whether the full-length Eno1 gene product could have a function similar to MBP-1 in carcinoma cells is yet to be determined. We have shown that MBP-1 regresses tumor growth in nude mice (12.Ray R.B.

Physiologic cell death occurs primarily through an evolutionarily conserved form of cell suicide, termed apoptosis or programmed cell death, and can be influenced by a wide variety of regulatory stimuli (19.Reed J.C.

Liu T.J. Ray R.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2775-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that exogenous expression of MBP-1 in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells inhibits cell proliferation (23.Ghosh A.K. Steele R. Ray R.B. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of MBP-1-mediated prostate cancer cell death is unknown. Overexpression of MEK5 has been implicated in tumor metastasis and the poor survival rate of prostate cancer patients (24.Mehta P.B. Jenkins B.L. McCarthy L. Thilak L. Robson C.N. Neal D.E. Leung H.Y. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1381-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated whether MBP-1 regulates the MEK5/BMK1 cell survival-signaling pathway in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells for cell growth. We observed that MBP-1 inhibits MEK5 expression in prostate cancer cells and modulates MEK5/BMK1 signaling pathway, suggesting that this could be one of the mechanisms of MBP-1-mediated inhibition of prostate cancer cell growth.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and PC3 were purchased from American Type Culture Collection, and human embryonic kidney cell line transformed with SV40 large t-antigen (293T cells) was purchased from Invitrogen.

MEK5 protein was immunoprecipitated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to MEK5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the complex was examined for FlagMBP-1 by Western blot analysis using an antibody to FLAG. Cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using an antibody to HA epitope (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to detect exogenous expression of MEK5 or an antibody to FLAG epitope (Sigma) to detect MBP-1.RESULTSMBP-1 Represses MEK5 Expression in Prostate Cancer Cells—MEK5 overexpression in prostate cancer is associated with tumor metastases and unfavorable survival outcome (24.Mehta P.B.

To investigate the expression level of MEK5 upon MBP-1 transduction, prostate cancer cells (DU145 and PC3) were transduced with AdMBP-1 or dl312 for 72 h. Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis using a specific antibody to detect MEK5 expression level. A significant reduction in endogenous MEK5α protein level in cells was observed upon MBP-1 expression (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 4) when compared with cells transduced with the control virus (lanes 1 and 3). We also observed repression of the exogenous MEK5α protein level when coexpressed with MBP-1 (Fig. 1B, lane 2) as compared with vector (lane 1). MEK5 exists as α- and β-isoforms, and MEK5α induces cell proliferation (26.Cameron S.J. Abe J. Malik S. Che W. Yang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1506-1512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Our results suggested that MBP-1 inhibits endogenous MEK5α protein; on the other hand, a marked elevation in MEK5β expression was noted. Thus, these results suggested that MBP-1 modulates MEK5 expression in prostate cancer cells. Next, we tested whether direct suppression of endogenous MBP-1 by siRNA could elevate MEK5α expression level. PC3 cells were transfected with pRNA-MBPsi-4 or pRNA-SR, and stable transfections were selected. Pooled control or experimental (MBP-siRNA) cell lysates were analyzed for MBP-1 and MEK5α expression by Western blot using specific antibodies (Fig. 1C). The blot was stripped and reprobed with antibody to β-tubulin for a comparison of equal loading of protein. Our results suggested that MBP-1 expression level was markedly inhibited by siRNA targeted to MBP-1 but not by scrambled siRNA. On the other hand, MEK5α expression was enhanced in MBP-siRNA cells as compared with control cells. Densitometric analysis suggested a 2-fold increase of endogenous MEK5α expression in MBP-1 knockdown cells (Fig. 1C, lane 2) as compared with control cells (lane 1). We did not observe a detectable difference in MEK5β expression in control and MBP-siRNA cells. This result further suggested that MEK5 expression is regulated by MBP-1.MBP-1 Inhibits MEK5α-mediated Phosphorylation of BMK1— Activation of MEK5α leads to phosphorylation and activation of its downstream MAPK, BMK1 (5.Kato Y.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). To investigate whether MBP-1 interrupts MEK5-mediated activation of BMK1, prostate cancer cells were cotransfected with a constitutively active MEK5 construct (CMV MEK5D), CMV-FlagBMK1, or CMV MBP-1. Cell lysates were prepared after 48 h of transfection and subjected to Western blot analysis using a specific antibody to detect BMK1 activation. Expression of MEK5D leads to the activation of BMK1, which is evident from the slower migration of BMK1 on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A, lane 2). However, coexpression of MBP-1 significantly reduced BMK1 activation (lane 3). When the blot was stripped and reprobed for exogenous MEK5α expression using an antibody to HA epitope, a significant reduction in MEK5α expression level was observed in presence of MBP-1 (Fig. 2A, middle panel). The blot was reprobed with an antibody to β-tubulin for comparison of protein level. Therefore, these results suggested that expression of MBP-1 inhibits MEK5-mediated activation of BMK1.Fig. 2MBP-1 inhibits MEK5α-mediated activation of BMK1. A, DU145 cells were transfected with empty vector (lane 1), BMK1 and MEK5D (lane 2), or MBP-1 (lane 3). After 48 h of transfection, cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis using a specific antibody to detect BMK1 (top panel). The blot was reprobed with an antibody to HA epitope to detect exogenous MEK5α (middle panel). The blot was also reprobed with antibody to β-tubulin for comparison of protein level (bottom panel). B, DU145 cells were transfected with CMV BMK1 followed by transduction with dl312 (lane 1) or AdMBP-1 (lane 2). After 48 h of transfection, cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis to detect BMK1. Activation of exogenous BMK1, observed in DU145 cells, was inhibited in the presence of MBP-1 (top panel). The blot was reprobed for the detection of endogenous MEK5α using specific antibody (middle panel). The blot was also reprobed with antibody to β-tubulin for comparison of protein level (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because overexpression of MEK5 has been reported in prostate cancer patients (24.Mehta P.B. Jenkins B.L. McCarthy L. Thilak L. Robson C.N. Neal D.E. Leung H.Y. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1381-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), we became interested to examine whether MEK5 is constitutively active in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. To this end, DU145 cells were transfected with CMV-FlagBMK1 followed by transduction with dl312 or AdMBP-1. After ∼48 h of transfection, cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis using a specific antibody to detect BMK1. Activation of the exogenous BMK1 was observed in the lysates of cells transduced with the control virus as evident from the slower migrating band of BMK1 (Fig. 2B, lane 1). However, transduction of AdMBP-1 inhibited activation of BMK1 (Fig. 2B, lane 2). When the blot was reprobed for MEK5 expression, a significantly reduced expression level of the endogenous MEK5α was observed in the cells. Thus, our results suggested that MEK5 is constitutively active in human prostate cancer cells and expression of MBP-1 inhibits its signaling pathway by reducing MEK5α expression.MBP-1 Inhibits MEK5/BMK1-mediated Activation of MEF2C— The transactivation activity of a diverse group of transcription factors is up-regulated by MAPK-induced phosphorylation, resulting in altered expression of specific target genes. A member of the MEF2 transcription factor family, MEF2C (monocytespecific enhancer binding factor 2C), is a protein substrate of BMK1. Activated BMK1 enhances the transactivation activity of MEF2C by phosphorylating a serine residue at amino acid position 387 in this transcription factor (5.Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). We further examined whether MBP-1-mediated inhibition of BMK1 activation affects the transactivation activity of MEF2C using a Gal4-responsive reporter gene assay. DU145 cells were cotransfected with a reporter construct containing five copies of the Gal4-DNA binding domain upstream of the adenovirus E1b minimal promoter driving a luciferase gene (G5E1b-luc), the Gal4MEF2C fusion construct, along with CMV MEK5D, CMV BMK1, and/or CMV MBP-1. After 48 h of transfection, luciferase assay was performed. As expected, expression of BMK1 with MEK5D dramatically enhanced (∼44-fold) MEF2C-dependent reporter gene expression (Fig. 3A). This enhancement was significantly repressed when MBP-1 was coexpressed in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, these results suggest that MBP-1 expression interrupts MEK5/BMK1-mediated activation of MEF2C transcriptional activity.Fig. 3MBP-1 inhibits MEK5/BMK1-mediated target gene activation. A, MBP-1 inhibits MEK5/BMK1-mediated activation of MEF2C. DU145 cells were cotransfected with the a Gal4-responsive reporter plasmid, G5E1b-luc, and Gal4MEF2C fusion construct together with CMV MEK5D and CMV BMK1 with increasing doses of CMV MBP-1 (1 and 2 μg). After 48 h of transfection, a luciferase assay was performed and presented as -fold activation. B, MBP-1 inhibits MEK5D-mediated activation of NF-κB. Cells were cotransfected with a reporter construct containing c-fos minimal promoter with two NF-κB-binding sites linked to the luciferase gene (NF-κB-luc), CMV MEK5D, and/or different doses of CMV MBP-1 (1 and 2 μg). After 48 h of transfection, a luciferase assay was performed and presented as -fold activation. C, MBP-1 inhibits MEK5/BMK1-driven activation of the cyclin D1 promoter. Cells were cotransfected with a cyclin D1-luc reporter construct, CMV MEK5D, CMV BMK1, and/or increasing doses of CMV MBP-1 (0.5, 1, and 2 μg). Luciferase activity was determined after 48 h of transfection and presented as -fold activation. In all of the transfections, total plasmid DNA was kept constant by adding empty vector. Values are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)MBP-1 Expression Inhibits MEK5/BMK1-mediated Activation of NF-κB—It has been shown earlier that the MEK5/BMK1 signaling cascade activates NF-κB in mouse fibroblasts (28.Pearson G. English J.M. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7927-7931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Here, we investigated whether MBP-1 expression inhibits MEK5-mediated activation of NF-κB. Therefore, we first examined whether activation of MEK5/BMK1 pathway activates NF-κB transcriptional activity in androgen-independent human prostate cancer cells. DU145 cells were cotransfected with a reporter construct containing c-fos minimal promoter with two NF-κB-binding sites linked to the luciferase gene (NF-κB-luc), CMV MEK5D, and/or CMV MBP-1. After 48 h of transfection, luciferase assay was performed. Expression of MEK5D enhances luciferase activity by about 3-fold from the basal level (Fig. 3B). However, coexpression of MBP-1 inhibits MEK5αmediated NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent manner.MBP-1 Inhibits MEK5/BMK1-mediated Activation of Cyclin D1—Recently, the MEK5/BMK1 pathway has been shown to control cyclin D1 expression by activating its promoter in Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (29.Mulloy R. Salinas S. Philips A. Hipskind R.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5387-5398Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Here, we examined whether MBP-1 perturbs the effect of MEK5/BMK1 activation on cyclin D1 promoter activity in prostate cancer cells. A reporter construct driving the expression of the luciferase gene under the control of the cyclin D1 promoter region spanning positions -973 to +139 (cyclin D1-luc) was cotransfected into cells together with CMV MEK5D, CMV BMK1, and/or increasing concentrations of CMV MBP-1 plasmid DNA. Coexpression of MEK5D and BMK1 increased the luciferase activity by about 10-fold (Fig. 3C). MEK5D/BMK1-mediated activation of the cyclin D1 promoter activity was repressed significantly by MBP-1 in a dose-dependent manner. Together, these results suggested that MBP-1 inhibits MEK5/BMK1-mediated activation of the cell growth-promoting genes such as NF-κB or cyclin D1.MBP-1 Induces Proteasomal Degradation of MEK5α—We have observed that MBP-1 reduces both endogenous and exogenous MEK5α expression in prostate cancer cells. Therefore we asked whether this reduction of MEK5α protein level was due to proteasome-dependent degradation. To address this question, we transduced DU145 and PC3 cells with dl312 or AdMBP-1, and cells were treated with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, for 16 h. Cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using a specific antibody to detect endogenous MEK5α (Fig. 4A). Our results suggested that treatment of MG132 restores the MEK5α protein level from MBP-1-mediated depletion in both the cell lines. Similar results were obtained when cells were transfected with CMV HA-MEK5α and CMV-FlagMBP-1 and treated with MG132 followed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4B). To examine the specificity of MBP-1-mediated degradation of MEK5α, cells were cotransfected with MEK5β, an alternatively spliced form of MEK5 lacking the first 89 amino acid residues from the N terminus of the MEK5 coding region (7.English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Xu S. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28897-28902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and CMV-FlagMBP-1 expression plasmid DNAs. After 48 h of transfection, cells were lysed and subjected to Western blot analysis using an antibody to GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to detect MEK5β (Fig. 4C). We then investigated whether MBP-1-driven proteasomal degradation of MEK5α involves the ubiquitination-proteasome degradation pathway. For this, cells were cotransfected with CMV MEK5, CMV myc-Ub, and CMV-FlagMBP-1 or empty vector. Results suggested that MBP-1 does not induce ubiquitination of MEK5α. As a positive control, we cotransfected CMVp53 and CMV myc-Ub with or without CMV MDM2, and ubiquitination of p53 was observed as expected. Thus, it appears that MBP-1 specifically targets the MEK5α protein for degradation without involving ubiquitination.Fig. 4MBP-1 induces proteasome-mediated degradation of MEK5α. A, DU145 and PC3 cells were transduced with dl312 (lanes 1 and 2) or AdMBP-1 (lanes 3 and 4). After 36 h, transduced cells were treated with a proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (lanes 2 and 4), or vehicle (lanes 1 and 3) for another 16 h. Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for endogenous MEK5α expression by Western blot using a specific antibody. Blots were reprobed with an antibody to β-tubulin for comparison of protein load.

The function of glutamate receptors (GluRs) is highly dependent on their surface density in specific neuronal domains. Alternative splicing is known to regulate surface expression of GluR5 and GluR6 subunits. The KAR subunit GluR7 exists under different splice variant isoforms in the C-terminal domain (GluR7a and GluR7b). Here we have studied the trafficking of GluR7 splice variants in cultured hippocampal neurons from wild-type and KAR mutant mice. We have found that alternative splicing regulates surface expression of GluR7-containing KARs. GluR7a and GluR7b differentially traffic from the ER to the plasma membrane. GluR7a is highly expressed at the plasma membrane, and its trafficking is dependent on a stretch of positively charged amino acids also found in GluR6a. In contrast, GluR7b is detected at the plasma membrane at a low level and retained mostly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The RXR motif of GluR7b does not act as an ER retention motif, at variance with other receptors and ion channels, but might be involved during the assembly process. Like GluR6a, GluR7a promotes surface expression of ER-retained subunit splice variants when assembled in heteromeric KARs. However, our results also suggest that this positive regulation of KAR trafficking is limited by the ability of different combinations of subunits to form heteromeric receptor assemblies. These data further define the complex rules that govern membrane delivery and subcellular distribution of KARs.

Ionotropic glutamatergic synaptic transmission is mediated by the N-methyl-d-aspartate, AMPA, 1The abbreviations used are: AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid; Ab, antibody; ALA, replacement of two arginines by two alanines; EndoH, endoglycosidase H; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GluR, glutamate receptor; KA, kainate; KAR, kainate receptor; MAP2, microtubule-associated protein 2; nMDP, normalized mean deviation product; PNG-F, peptide N-glycosidase-F; RT, reverse transcription; VGluT1, vesicular glutamate transporter 1; WT, wild type. and kainate-type glutamate receptors (KARs). KARs play a variety of functions in synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability (1Huettner J.E. Prog. Neurobiol. (Oxf.). 2003; 70: 387-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 2Lerma J.

Sci. 2005; 26: 20-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). At a presynaptic level, KARs modulate transmitter release, thus inducing and regulating short and long term synaptic plasticity. At a post-synaptic level, KARs contribute to the post-synaptic response at some synapses and regulate neuronal excitability by the inhibition of K+ channels. These distinct roles of KARs are likely mediated by KARs with distinct subcellular localization and possibly different biophysical properties. KARs are hetero-oligomeric receptor channels composed of the subunits GluR5, GluR6, GluR7, KA1, and KA2 (4Bettler B. Mulle C. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 123-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 5Chittajallu R. Braithwaite S. Clarke V. Henley J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 26-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). A diversity of native KARs with distinct heteromeric combinations thus likely exists, although the subunit composition and stoichiometry of KARs are not known in detail. Hitherto we do not understand how subunit composition relates to the different functional roles that KARs play (1Huettner J.E. Prog. Neurobiol.

The biogenesis and intracellular trafficking of heteromeric receptor channels such as KARs are likely to be tightly controlled processes requiring proper folding and assembly, with the ER as the primary checkpoint of these complex events (6Ma D. Jan L.Y. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of ionotropic glutamate receptors contains critical determinants of receptor trafficking and is subject to alternative splicing in most glutamate receptors. Complex interactions of C-terminal domains with proteins that include PDZ proteins are important for the regulated trafficking of AMPA and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, especially during synaptic plasticity (7Wenthold R.J.

The GluR5, GluR6, and GluR7 KAR subunits exist under several splice variants isoforms (GluR5a, GluR5b, GluR5c, GluR6a, GluR6b, GluR7a, and GluR7b) that differ in the sequence of their cytoplasmic C-terminal domains. The mechanisms that lead to the differential membrane delivery of KAR subunits and their splice variants have recently been shown to depend on ER retention motifs and forward trafficking signals (9Jaskolski F.

An RXR motif functions as an ER retention signal in GluR5c and KA2, preventing surface expression of these receptors when expressed as homomers (9Jaskolski F. Coussen F. Nagarajan N. Normand E. Rosenmund C. Mulle C. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2506-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 14Barlowe C.

A stretch of positively charged amino acids in GluR5b (QRRTQRK) acts as a novel ER retention motif when coupled to a single transmembrane reporter protein (11Ren Z. Riley N.J. Needleman L.A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 52700-52709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), although this ER retention signal might be masked in fully assembled homomeric GluR5b receptors. In contrast, GluR6a is highly expressed at the cell surface and promotes membrane delivery of splice variants normally retained in the ER due to the presence of a forward trafficking signal containing a cysteine residue followed by a cluster of positively charged amino acids (9Jaskolski F. Coussen F. Nagarajan N. Normand E. Rosenmund C. Mulle C. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2506-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 12Yan S. Sanders J.M. Xu J. Zhu Y. Contractor A. Swanson G.T. J.

In the present study we investigated the intracellular trafficking and surface expression of the GluR7 splice variants. Although GluR7 is expressed at high levels in various neuronal populations, little is known about its functional properties and its role in glutamatergic synaptic transmission. GluR6 and GluR7 subunits are 86% identical at the amino acid level (15Bettler B. Egebjerg J. Sharma G. Pecht G. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Moll C. Stevens C.F. Heinemann S. Neuron. 1992; 8: 257-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) but display distinct electrophysiological properties. Recombinant GluR7 receptors expressed in HEK 293 cells form functional ion channels that only respond to very high concentrations of glutamate (16Schiffer H.H. Swanson G.T. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1141-1146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Domains involved in the functional differences between GluR6 and GluR7 have been identified in the L3 extracellular loop (17Strutz N. Villmann C. Thalhammer A. Kizelsztein P. Eisenstein M. Teichberg V.I. Hollmann M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 401-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GluR7 subunits can also assemble with GluR5, GluR6, and KA2 to form heteromeric channels (13Gallyas Jr., F. Ball S.M. Molnar E. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 1414-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Schiffer H.H. Swanson G.T. Heinemann S.F.

The two isoforms GluR7a and GluR7b contain distinct C-terminal ends of 64 and 55 amino acids, respectively, and both make functional homomeric channels (16Schiffer H.H. Swanson G.T. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1141-1146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The alternatively spliced C-terminal domain of GluR7a contains a motif identical to the export signal in GluR6a, whereas GluR7b displays an RXR ER retention motif. We have explored the surface expression and subcellular distribution of the two GluR7 splice variants expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons and analyzed the molecular determinants for their differential trafficking. We have also examined the effects of the co-assembly of GluR6 splice variants on the trafficking of GluR7 isoforms. Our results demonstrate the functional significance of GluR7 alternative splicing. RT-PCR Experiments—RNA was prepared from adult C57-BL/6 mice tissues using the Micro-Fast Track™ protocol (Invitrogen) with 50–100 mg of starting material. The RT step was performed on purified mRNAs (oligo(dT)-cellulose) with a specific reverse primer for the GluR7 subunit, 5′-GCTGGCTATGGAGATGGTCGGTG-3′. RT products were amplified in a first PCR round using the splice variant specific primer pairs 5′-CGGCTCTGAGGTGGTGGAGAATAAC-3′ (GluR7a and GluR7b forward), 5′-GCTGGCTATGGAGATGGTCGGTG-3′ (GluR7a reverse), and 5′-CTTCCTTCCCTGTCCAACGC-3′ (GluR7b reverse). Next, the first round PCR product was amplified in a second PCR round using a second set of splice variant specific primer pairs, 5′-CCCTCGGCTCTGGTGAAGAACAATG-3′ (GluR7a and GluR7b forward) (2Lerma J.

PCR was performed using 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 56 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C. The positive control condition was a two-round PCR experiment on plasmids encoding GluR7a and GluR7b cDNAs. DNA Constructs—Six consecutive c-Myc epitopes were introduced after the predicted signal peptide of rat GluR7a(Q) cDNA (Swiss-Prot accession number P42264-1) and subcloned in pcDNA3 vector. The BstXI site, located before the fourth membrane domain of the protein, was mutated in NheI restriction site by PCR, and an AflII restriction site was introduced after the stop codon. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using QuikChange XL kit (Stratagene). Hippocampal Cultures—Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons were obtained from 1-day-old pups of C57-BL/6 and GluR5–/–xGluR6–/– mutant mice (44Mulle C. Sailer A. Swanson G.T. Brana C. O'Gorman S. Bettler B. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 2000; 28: 475-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Hippocampi were dissociated with papain followed by mechanical trituration and plated at 50,000 cells/cm2 in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% d-glucose, 0.1 mg/ml transferrin, 25 μg/ml insulin, 2 mm GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), and 5 μg/ml gentamycin. 2% B-27 (Sigma) and 1 μm cytosine arabinoside were added 3 days after plating. Transfection—10–14-day-old hippocampal neurons were transfected using the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). 3 μgof DNA in 500 μl of minimum Eagle's medium was mixed with 10 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in 500 μl of minimum Eagle's medium and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Cultured medium was then replaced by 1 ml of minimum Eagle's medium complemented with the transfection mix. After 1 h of incubation, the transfection medium was replaced with 3 ml of growth medium. Experiments were performed 24 h after transfection. Glycosylation Assays—Glycosylation assays were performed using transfected COS-7 cells as described (9Jaskolski F. Coussen F. Nagarajan N. Normand E. Rosenmund C. Mulle C. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2506-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Endoglycosidase H (EndoH) and peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNG-F) were added to protein samples for 12 h at 37 °C. Immunostaining—To perform double staining for surface expression experiments, 10 μg/ml polyclonal anti-Myc antibody (Ab) (catalog number 06-549, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) was incubated with the cells for 20 min at 15 °C to limit antibody endocytosis. Cells were washed, fixed in paraformaldehyde (4%), and kept in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.3% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% saponin during the steps that require membrane permeabilization. Intracellular epitopes were detected using 0.5 μg/ml monoclonal anti-Myc Ab (clone 9E10, Roche Applied Science) incubated for 1 h at 20 °C. ER staining was performed with polyclonal anti-calreticulin Ab (1:500; catalog number PA3-900, Upstate Biotechnology) for 1 h at 20 °C. Secondary Abs, which were incubated for 1 h at 20 °C, included Alexa 568- and 488-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody IgGs (catalog numbers A11011 and A11001, Molecular Probes) and Alexa 568- and 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgGs (10 μg/ml; catalog numbers A11008 and A11004, Molecular Probes). For subcellular distribution of KAR subunits, neurons were incubated with monoclonal anti-Myc Ab or polyclonal anti-Myc Ab for 1 h at 20 °C. Neurons were then permeabilized with saponin and incubated with the monoclonal anti-MAP2 Ab (1:500; clone HM-2, Sigma), the polyclonal anti-vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (anti-VGluT1) Ab (1:500) (26Herzog E. Bellenchi G.C. Gras C. Bernard V. Ravassard P. Bedet C. Gasnier B. Giros B. El Mestikawy S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or the monoclonal anti-TAU1 Ab (1:500; MAB3420, Chemicon) for 1 h at 20 °C. Secondary antibodies were incubated as described above. Immunostaining Data Analysis—Confocal images were acquired on a Leica TCS SP2 microscope. The exposure settings and gain of laser were kept the same for each compared condition corresponding to undersaturated acquisitions. Images in the displayed figures were overexposed for a better demonstration but do not correspond to the analyzed images. The relative surface labeling value was analyzed as follows. Signal detection was performed using the Sobel edge detection method (approximation of the locale derivate by convolutions). Surface and intracellular labeled areas defined by the edge detection were measured (number of pixels, ≅10 nm2 per pixel). Relative surface labeling was calculated as the surface labeled area divided by the sum of surface labeled area and intracellular labeled area (percentage). 10–20 cells were measured in each condition to calculate the mean relative surface labeling. Colocalization was quantified after signal detection (Sobel method) by correlation calculation in each pixel of paired images as in (24Jaskolski F. Mulle C. Manzoni O. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Correlation images (normalized mean deviation product (nMDP) of the images) displays the pixel map of nMDP calculated for paired images. The Icorr index corresponds to the number of correlated pixels (nMDP > 0) over total number of pixels in the correlation image. The Icorr varies from 0 to 1, where 0.5 corresponds to randomly distributed signals. 10 paired images were measured in each condition so that we could calculate the corresponding mean Icorr. Image analysis was performed using MATLAB software (MathWorks). Statistical significance was tested using two-way analysis of variance followed by a rank sum nonparametric test. Splice Variant Isoforms of GluR7, mRNA Expression, and Membrane Delivery—GluR7a and GluR7b differ in terms of C-terminal cassettes of 64 and 55 residues, respectively, localized 14 amino acids after the end of the fourth membrane domain (Fig. 1A). Probes to detect GluR7 mRNA in previous experiments have not been designed to differentiate between the expression of the two splice variants (15Bettler B. Egebjerg J. Sharma G. Pecht G. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Moll C. Stevens C.F. Heinemann S. Neuron. 1992; 8: 257-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 19Wisden W. Seeburg P. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3582-3598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We first examined whether both splice variants were expressed in selected mouse brain regions with RT-PCR using specific oligonucleotides (Fig. 1B). Both GluR7 subunit splice variants were detected in the mouse nervous system with no apparent regional specificity of expression. To examine whether alternative splicing regulates subcellular distribution and surface expression of GluR7 splice variants, we tagged each splice variant by inserting six successive c-Myc epitopes in the extracellular N-terminal domain, just after the signal peptide. Myc-tagged GluR7a and GluR7b were transfected in cultured hippocampal neurons. Twenty-four hours after transfection, neurons were stained for surface expressed receptors (on living cells) and intracellular receptors (Fig. 1D; neurons from wild type mice). GluR7a and GluR7b were both expressed at the cell surface and distributed in clusters in the cell membrane (Fig. 1D, left column). Qualitatively, the surface staining was weaker for GluR7b than for GluR7a, suggesting differential membrane delivery. To quantify the surface expression of these isoforms, we used an image analysis method adapted from our previous work (9Jaskolski F. Coussen F. Nagarajan N. Normand E. Rosenmund C. Mulle C. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2506-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (see “Materials and Methods”). In neurons from wild type mice, GluR7a was detected at higher levels than GluR7b at the cell surface (Fig. 1E; relative surface labeling (percentage) was 48 ± 2% for GluR7a and 19 ± 3% for GluR7b, p < 0.005, n = 20). We validated our image analysis method by performing biotinylation assays in COS-7 cells transfected with GluR7a and GluR7b that yielded comparative results (see supplemental data available in the on-line version of this article). Cultured neurons derived from wild-type mice express endogenous KAR subunits (20Janssens N. Lesage A.S. J.Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1457-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 21Ruano D. Lambolez B. Rossier J. Paternain A.V. Lerma J. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1009-1017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) that may co-assemble with GluR7 and potentially regulate trafficking of the transfected subunits. Cultured hippocampal neurons from GluR5–/–xGluR6–/– mice (22Bureau I. Dieudonne S. Coussen F. Mulle C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6838-6843Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) have allowed the study of transfected GluR5 and GluR6 splice variants in the absence of these endogenous subunits (9Jaskolski F. Coussen F. Nagarajan N. Normand E. Rosenmund C. Mulle C. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2506-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In fact, cultured hippocampal neurons derived from wild-type mice do not express GluR7 mRNA (20Janssens N. Lesage A.S. J.Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1457-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 21Ruano D. Lambolez B. Rossier J. Paternain A.V. Lerma J. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1009-1017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We further verified the absence of the GluR7 protein in cultured hippocampal neurons from GluR5–/–xGluR6–/– mice in Western blots probed with a GluR6/7 antibody that should only detect GluR7a (see supplemental data). We thus used cultured neurons derived from GluR5–/–xGluR6–/–, which are devoid of GluR5, GluR6, and GluR7 subunits, to explore surface expression of GluR7 splice variants. In these cultured neurons, the transfected GluR7a splice variant was still expressed at a high level on the cell surface (Fig. 1E; in GluR5–/–xGluR6–/– neurons the relative surface labeling (percentage) for GluR7a was 45 ± 5%, not significantly different from that of WT). Thus, GluR7a readily traffics to the plasma membrane even in the absence of endogenous KAR subunits such as GluR6a. In contrast, the level of surface-expressed GluR7b was significantly lower than in neurons from WT mice (in GluR5–/–xGluR6–/– neurons the relative surface labeling (percentage) for GluR7b was 9 ± 1%; p < 0.01 for WT versus GluR5–/–xGluR6–/–). This result suggests that GluR7b is poorly expressed at the plasma membrane as a homomer and likely co-assembles with endogenous GluR5 or the GluR6 subunit when expressed in WT neurons. GluR7 Isoforms Are Differentially Retained in the ER—The low expression of GluR7b at the plasma membrane of neurons could be caused by retention in the ER, which serves as a quality control checkpoint for multimeric receptors and channels before export to the Golgi and to the plasma membrane (6Ma D. Jan L.Y. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The GluR7b splice variant strongly colocalized with calreticulin, an ER resident chaperone protein (23Leach M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29686-29697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). This colocalization appears in yellow in the merge image and in hot colors in the calculated correlation (nMDP) images (Fig. 2A; see “Materials and Methods”) (24Jaskolski F. Mulle C. Manzoni O. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, GluR7a staining was only partly colocalized with calreticulin in bright puncta, which may correspond to ER exit sites (Fig. 2A, left column, white arrowhead) (25Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). Using our correlation image analysis, we quantified the level of colocalization between the two markers by calculating for each paired image a correlation index, Icorr (see “Materials and Methods”). The level of colocalization between the ER marker and the two splice variants differed markedly (Fig. 2B) (mean Icorr was 0.58 ± 0.02 for GluR7a and 0.76 ± 0.02 for GluR7b; n = 10, p < 0.005), indicating preferential retention of GluR7b in the ER. To verify that overexpression of recombinant proteins does not saturate cell sorting capacity and lead to retention within the ER, we have transfected DNA mixes comprising various proportions of coding and empty vectors (coding/empty ratios of 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:4). Under all of these conditions GluR7b strongly colocalized with the ER marker, whereas GluR7a was expressed on the cell surface and partly colocalized with the ER in discrete dots. We also measured colocalization of GluR7 splice variants with the ER marker 4 and 10 days after transfection, because longer expression time leads to degradation of overloaded proteins. In this experiment, although the overall level of recombinant proteins decreases, differences between GluR7a and GluR7b in terms of colocalization with the ER marker are maintained (data not shown). To confirm the differential trafficking of GluR7 isoforms from the ER to the plasma membrane, we next examined the pattern of glycosylation of these subunits. In Western blots from total protein extracts of transfected COS-7 cells, GluR7a and GluR7b were detected at a higher molecular masses than predicted from the amino acid sequence of the tagged isoforms (Fig. 2C, lanes marked Input; black arrowheads), 110 kDa for GluR7a and 109 kDa for GluR7b. These bands likely correspond to glycosylated subunits, because GluR7 carries eight predicted N-glycosylation sites (Swiss-Prot accession number P42264). We treated protein extracts with PNG-F, which removes N-glycans. GluR7 proteins treated with PNG-F migrated to the molecular mass predicted for non-glycosylated proteins. Resistance to EndoH was conferred by mannosidase 2 processing of the protein that occurs in the Golgi apparatus. GluR7a was partially resistant to the treatment by EndoH, whereas no EndoH-resistant fraction could be detected for GluR7b (Fig. 2C), reflecting the low amount of proteins that have undergone the last phases of glycosylation in the Golgi apparatus. Native GluR7a was also partially resistant to deglycosylation by EndoH in protein extracts from mouse brain (see supplemental data in the on-line version of this article). The low surface expression of GluR7b can be explained by restricted export of the subunits from the ER, whereas GluR7a readily traffics from the ER to the plasma membrane. Subcellular Distribution of GluR7 Isoforms—The various roles of KARs in synaptic transmission depend critically on their subcellular localization in specific membrane domains in the axonal or somatodendritic compartments. It is not yet clear whether subunit composition and splice variants might play a role in the polarized trafficking of KARs in these neuronal domains. We examined the subcellular localization of tagged GluR7a and GluR7b transfected in cultured hippocampal neurons derived from GluR5–/–xGluR6–/– mice. To explore the distribution of tagged subunits in regards to axonal or somatodendritic compartments, we performed double labeling studies using antibodies either against the microtubule-associated proteins Tau1 (a marker of axons) or MAP2 (a marker of somatodendritic compartments) (Fig. 3A). We found that both GluR7 isoforms were present at the surface of MAP2-positive compartments (Fig. 3A, sections marked Soma and Dendrites). Similarly, both GluR7 isoforms were detected at the surface of axonal processes (Fig. 3B, row marked Axons). To examine the potential localization of GluR7 isoforms at glutamatergic synapses, cultured neurons were labeled with an antibody against VGluT1, a presynaptic marker (26Herzog E. Bellenchi G.C. Gras C. Bernard V. Ravassard P. Bedet C. Gasnier B. Giros B. El Mestikawy S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). No colocalization was found between VGluT1 staining and somatodendritic GluR7 isoforms, indicating that GluR7 is not targeted to post-synaptic sites in cultured hippocampal neurons (Fig. 3A, row marked Post-Synaptic) (colocalization index (Icorr) at post-synaptic sites is 0.51 ± 0.04 for GluR7a and 0.48 ± 0.01 for GluR7b, n = 10). We next explored the distribution of GluR7a and GluR7b at presynaptic sites on glutamatergic inputs. Both GluR7a and GluR7b concentrated at VGlut1 positive clusters on axonal processes (i.e. thin processes extending by >100 μm from the soma) of the transfected neuron (Fig. 3B, row marked Pre-Synaptic; white arrowheads) (colocalization index (Icorr) at presynaptic sites was 0.65 ± 0.01 for GluR7a and 0.62 ± 0.03 for GluR7b, n = 10 neurons; for both isoforms the difference between pre-"

To investigate the possible implication of mitochondrial abundance in the genesis of thyroid tumors, we have explored the gene expression profile of six oncocytic carcinomas and six mitochondrial-rich papillary carcinomas using cDNA-microarray technology. A supervised approach allowed us to identify 83 genes differentially expressed in the two types of carcinoma. These genes were classified according to their ontologic profiles. Three genes, NOS3, alpha-actinin-2 and alpha-catenin, suspected of playing a role in tumor genesis, were explored by quantitative RT–PCR analysis and immunohistochemistry. Of the 59 genes overexpressed in papillary carcinomas, 51% were involved in cell communication. Of the 24 genes overexpressed in oncocytic carcinomas, 84% were involved in mitochondrial and cellular metabolism. Our results suggest that mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes III and IV play a significant role in the regulation of reactive oxygen species production by oncocytic tumors."

https://openalex.org/W2100251396,"While estrogens are suspected risk factors for epithelial ovarian cancer (OCa), progesterone (P4) has been shown to exert protective effects. The biological actions of P4 in target cells are mediated by progesterone receptors (PRs) that exist principally as A- and B-isoforms. We observed overexpression of PR-A and PR-B protein in two lines of OCa cells when compared to two lines of nontumorigenic, normal human ovarian surface epithelial (HOSE) cells. Treatment of HOSE or OCa cells with estrone or 17beta-estradiol at 10(-8) M for a period of 72 h induced significant loss of PR-A and PR-B mRNA and protein expression, with the regulation primarily controlled at the transcriptional level. In contrast, breast cancer cells (line MCF-7) exposed to estrogens upregulated PR-A and PR-B expression. Of significance, both the inhibitory and stimulatory actions of estrogens were blocked by the specific ER-antagonist ICI 182,780 (ICI, 10(-5) M), confirming estrogen specificity. Co-treatment of estrogen-exposed HOSE, OCa, and MCF-7 cell lines with inhibitors of type 1- and type 2-17beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase did not affect the previously observed changes in PR expression, suggesting that the action of each estrogen is direct and not mediated via conversion to its metabolic counterpart. Green fluorescence protein (GFP)-PR-A and GFP-PR-B were localized in the cytoplasmic compartment of untreated HOSE cells and translocated to the nucleus after P4 treatment, while both chimera PRs resided in the nuclei of OCa cells in a ligand-independent manner. In OCa cell cultures, P4 (10(-6) M), but not RU486 (10(-5) M), induced apoptosis that was blocked by co-treatment with the antiprogestin but enhanced by co-treatment with ICI. In sharp contrast, P4 induced proliferation, while ICI and RU486 caused cell death in MCF-7 cells. In conclusion, this study is first to demonstrate estrogens as negative regulators of PR expression in HOSE/OCa cells and to provide a mechanistic basis upon which to explain the antagonism of estrogens on the anti-OCa action of progestins. It also raises the possibility of using progestin and ICI as a combinational therapy for OCa treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2108661304,"The mitochondrial carrier family transports a variety of metabolites across the inner mitochondrial membrane. We identified and cloned a new member of this family, KMCP1 (kidney mitochondrial carrier protein-1), that is highly homologous to the previously identified protein BMCP1 (brain mitochondrial carrier protein-1). Western blotting and in situ experiments showed that this carrier is expressed predominantly within the kidney cortex in the proximal and distal tubules. KMCP1 was increased during fasting and during the regenerative phase of glycerol-induced renal failure. We show that both situations are associated with transiently increased expression of superoxide-generating enzymes, followed by increased mitochondrial metabolism and antioxidant defenses. Given that KMCP1 expression occurs simultaneously with these latter events, we propose that KMCP1 is involved in situations in which mitochondrial metabolism is increased, in particular when the cellular redox balance tends toward a pro-oxidant status.

The main function of mitochondria is to create energy for cellular activity by the process of oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondria are also critical for other aspects of cell function such as modulation of calcium storage, heme biosynthesis, and apoptosis. Mitochondrial dysfunction, generally arising from oxidative damage or mutation to mitochondrial or nuclear genes, contributes to a wide range of human diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases and diabetes. Oxidative stress is a particularly important factor in mitochondrial metabolism; the respiratory chain continually produces free radical superoxide, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, cell damage, and death by compromising ATP production and increasing oxidative stress. All of these mitochondrially mediated processes require exchange of solutes between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytoplasm. Although the outer mitochondrial membrane is permeable to many small metabolites, transport of solutes across the inner mitochondrial membrane is achieved by members of the mitochondrial carrier protein family (or SLC25 family) (1Palmieri F. Pfluegers Arch. 2004; 447: 689-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). These proteins share a structure containing three domains repeated in tandem, each containing a conserved motif and folded into two transmembrane domains connected by a hydrophilic loop, (2Pebay-Peyroula E. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Kahn R. Trezeguet V. Lauquin G.J. Brandolin G. Nature. 2003; 426: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). The substrates transported by these carriers vary widely in their structure and size from the smallest, H+, to the largest and most highly charged species, ATP. Some mitochondrial carriers are present in all tissues, whereas others are tissue-specific and have a limited distribution reflecting their importance in special functions. Functional studies in intact mitochondria have indicated the presence of ∼20 carriers for the transport of metabolites involved in oxidative phosphorylation; the citric acid cycle; fatty acid oxidation; gluconeogenesis; lipogenesis; transfer of reducing equivalents; urea synthesis; amino acid degradation; and intramitochondrial DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. In this study, we identify a new mitochondrial carrier, KMCP1 (kidney mitochondrial carrier protein-1), that is expressed mainly in the kidney and that is highly similar to BMCP1 (brain mitochondrial carrier protein-1), a mitochondrial carrier expressed mainly in the brain (3Sanchis D.

Urea kinetic and creatinine kinetic kits were purchased from bioMérieux. Animals and Treatments—C57BL/6J mice (6–8 weeks old) were obtained from Elevage Janvier (Le Genest Saint Isle, France) and maintained under normal conditions with free access to food and water. On the day of the experiment, mice were injected intramuscularly with a 50% glycerol solution (10 ml/kg), gentamicin (100 mg/kg/d), or cyclosporin A (5 mg/kg/d). Furosemide (400 mg/kg), acetazolamide (200 mg/kg), hydrochlorothiazide (200 mg/kg), and acetylcysteine (15 mg/kg) were injected intraperitoneally as indicated. For diet assays, mice were fed a 0.01% NaCl, 3% NaCl, or 3% KCl diet for 1 week. For starvation assays, mice were deprived of food for 8–36 h. Metabolic acidosis was induced by addition of 0.28 m NH4Cl to the water for 48 h.

Purified protein was sent to Elevage Scientifique des Dombes (Lyon, France) for rabbit immunization. Rabbit sera were precipitated with ammonium sulfate as described (13Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) and purified by affinity chromatography on a KMCP1-N-hydroxysuccinimide column (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies were tested, and the most specific one was chosen for the following analysis. Immunoprecipitation Experiments—For immunoprecipitation experiments, mitochondrial proteins were solubilized overnight with immunoprecipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5)) at 4 °C and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. Anti-KMCP1 antibody was added to the supernatant for 2 h at room temperature. Immunoprecipitated proteins were retrieved by addition of protein A and analyzed by Western blotting. Cell Culture—The simian kidney epithelial cell line COS-7 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units of penicillin, and 50 μg of streptomycin. Cells were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions and harvested 24 h after transfection. HK2 cells were maintained in 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 50% Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with antibiotics, insulin, transferrin, selenium, triiodothyronine (4 pg/ml), dexamethasone (0.5 nm), fetal calf serum (1%), and epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml). When near confluence, cells were exposed to an equimolar solution of hydroxyquinolol/ferrous ammonium sulfate, 0.1 μm prostaglandin I2, or 0.1 μm angiotensin II. For cell starvation experiments, the cell medium was replaced with a nutrient-poor medium. Cells were harvested in Tris/sucrose buffer (10 mm Tris and 250 mm sucrose (pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors and DNase), frozen in liquid nitrogen for 5 min, and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. These steps were repeated twice. Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 750 × g for 10 min. Mitochondria were collected after centrifugation of the supernatant at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in Tris/sucrose buffer. RNA Analysis—Total RNA from mouse tissue was prepared using TRIzol reagent. Northern analysis of 20 μg of total tissue RNA was performed using a [α-32P]dCTP-labeled KMCP1 cDNA probe as described previously (14Cassard A.M. Bouillaud F. Mattei M.G. Hentz E. Raimbault S. Thomas M. Ricquier D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 43: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A [α-32P]dCTP-labeled R45 rRNA probe was used as standard. Quantification was achieved with a PhosphorImager. Reverse transcription PCR was performed with 2 μg of mouse mRNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCR was performed on a LightCycler instrument with 1 μl of the reverse transcription product and LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green mixture (oligonucleotides 5′-TGCTGCACGCGCTGATGAGGATAGG (forward) and 5′-TGGAAGCTCCACGCCGACCACAATG (reverse)). For in situ hybridization, brain and kidney sections were hybridized with mouse KMCP1 cDNA sense and antisense probes. Protein Analysis—Mitochondrial proteins were isolated from mouse tissues as described previously (11Pecqueur C. Alves-Guerra M-C. Gelly C. Levi-Meyrueis C. Couplan E. Collins S. Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Miroux B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8705-8712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial protein content was assayed by the bicinchoninic acid method. Protein were loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane by liquid electroblotting in 10 mm CAPS and 10% ethanol (pH 9). Nonspecific binding was achieved at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline and Tween 20 supplemented with 5% dried milk for 1 h. All antibodies were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, Tween 20, and 2% dried milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The appropriate peroxidase-conjugated antibody was used to reveal protein binding with an ECL kit. Quantification was achieved using Syngene GeneSnap software (Ozyme, Saint Quentin en Yvelines, France). All membranes were probed with anti-porin monoclonal antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc.) to normalize protein loading. COS-7 cells transiently transfected with KMCP1 were used as a positive control. Mitochondrial Respiration Analysis in Yeast—The yeast expression vector pYeDP containing the protein of interest was used to transform yeast strain IB111. Yeast growth rate was determined as described (15Gonzalez-Barroso M.M. Fleury C. Arechaga I. Zaragoza P. Levi-Meyrueis C. Raimbault S. Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Rial E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and proton leak measurements were obtained as described (16González-Barroso M.M. Fleury C. Bouillaud F. Nicholls D.G. Rial E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15528-15532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast mitochondria were isolated and resuspended in 0.65 m mannitol, 10 mm Tris maleate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 10mm phosphate, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (pH 6.8). Oxygen consumption and membrane potential were measured simultaneously in an Oxygraph chamber (Hansatech Instruments) in the presence of 3 mm NADH, 1 μg/ml oligomycin, and 100 ng/ml nigericin. The proton conductance of yeast was determined by measuring the oxygen consumption relative to the mitochondrial membrane potential (3Sanchis D. Fleury C. Chomiki N. Goubern M. Huang Q. Neverova M. Gregoire F. Easlick J. Raimbault S. Levi-Meyrueis C. Miroux B. Collins S. Seldin M. Richard D. Warden C. Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34611-34615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed using two other members of the mitochondrial carrier family, UCP1 (uncoupling protein-1) and the oxoglutarate carrier, as internal controls. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Analysis in COS-7 Cells— KMCP1, oxoglutarate carrier, and UCP1 cDNAs were cloned into the pTracer-CMV vector (Invitrogen) containing an SV40 promoter driving expression of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene and the cytomegalovirus promoter driving expression of the protein of interest. Transiently transfected COS-7 cells were harvested by trypsinization and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with the red fluorescent probe tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (100 nm; Molecular Probes, Inc.) with or without 10 nm oligomycin. Flow cytometry analysis allowed the identification of transfected cells by measuring green fluorescence, whereas membrane potential was determined by measuring red fluorescence. The ratio between transfected cells and non-transfected fluorescent cells was calculated and is expressed relative to control pTracer vector-transfected cells. Superoxide Dismutase Activity Analysis—Mouse kidneys were homogenized in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 250 mm sucrose and solubilized with addition of 0.1% of Triton X-100 at 4 °C. Basal pyrogallol autoxidation was measured at 37 °C at 420 nm by spectrophotometry in 0.1 m Tris/cacodylic acid buffer (pH 8.5), 2 mm pyrogallol, 1.7 mm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (pH 7) (Sigma). Superoxide dismutase activity inhibits this oxidation. Result are presented as the inverse of the ratio between autoxidation of pyrogallol and its oxidation in the presence of kidney lysate. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Comparison between groups was made using one-way analysis of variance. Differences were considered as significant if p < 0.05. Identification of a Novel Mitochondrial Carrier Family Member, KMCP1—To identify novel mitochondrial carrier family members, an in silico search was performed in UniGene (available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). A set of expressed sequence tags, mostly from adult mouse kidney, were found. They were similar but not identical to mouse and human BMCP1 (GenBank™ accession numbers BB609460, BB610721, BB619998, BB853686, BF786152, and BI691726). Primers designed based on a contig construction sequence using these expressed sequence tags were used to clone a mouse cDNA and a human cDNA (GenBank™ accession numbers NM_026232 and NM_001010875, respectively) termed KMCP1 (SLC25A30). The full-length cDNA was generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” KMCP1 is a 291-amino acid protein with a theoretical molecular mass of 32,245 Da. Alignment of its predicted sequence with BMCP1 showed a strong homology (Fig. 1A). In fact, if the N-terminal 20 amino acids present uniquely in BMCP1 are not included in analysis, these proteins share 80% identity. The relationship to other mitochondrial carrier proteins is shown in Fig. 1B. As in all mitochondrial carrier family members, the protein sequence displays both the 3-fold repeat structure of 100 amino acids and the characteristic mitochondrial motifs (Fig. 1A). The human gene maps to chromosome 13q14.11. To our knowledge, this locus is not genetically linked to any pathophysiological situation. The intron/exon structure of the mouse gene consists of 10 exons (Fig. 1A). The first exon is untranslated because the ATG site is located within the second exon. Exon 10 contains a TGA codon followed by a polyadenylation site and a very long untranslated region (2655 bp). KMCP1, a Mitochondrial Kidney Protein—Northern blot analysis of KMCP1 RNA expression in murine tissues revealed that KMCP1 was expressed as a 3.7-kb mRNA transcript mainly in the kidney and at lower levels in the testes and white adipose tissue (Fig. 2A). A weak signal was detected in other tissues. A polyclonal antibody was made against the recombinant mouse full-length KMCP1 protein expressed in E. coli as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Its specificity against KMCP1 compared with both BMCP1 and other members of the mitochondrial carrier family was tested by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2B). Anti-KMCP1 antibody detected 5 ng of KMCP1 inclusion bodies extracted from recombinant bacteria. This antibody detected the same amount of BMCP1, but barely detected other mitochondrial carriers such as UCP1, UCP2, and UCP3. The KMCP1 protein was also revealed by Western blotting in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with a mammalian expression vector overexpressing KMCP1 (Fig. 2C). Western blot analysis was performed using mitochondria from various tissues. Anti-KMCP1 antibody revealed a 30-kDa protein in kidney lysate that comigrated with KMCP1 overexpressed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2D). However, another band at a slightly higher molecular mass appeared in spleen and testis mitochondria (Fig. 2D), suggesting that the antibody cross-reacts with other proteins. To test this hypothesis, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. Although immunoprecipitation of spleen mitochondria followed by Western blotting did not reveal any band, immunoprecipitation of kidney mitochondria revealed the same 30-kDa band (Fig. 2E). This 30-kDa band immunoprecipitated from kidney mitochondria comigrated with KMCP1 immunoprecipitated from yeast expressing KMCP1. Finally, to confirm the mitochondrial localization of this protein, Western blot analysis was performed with lysate, a 10,000 × g supernatant, and mitochondria prepared from mouse kidney. The weak band detected in kidney lysate was strongly enhanced by mitochondrial enrichment (Fig. 2F). No signal was detected in the 10,000 × g supernatant. Thus, KMCP1 is a mitochondrial protein expressed mainly in the kidney. Sublocalization of KMCP1 in the Kidney—To determine more precisely the localization of KMCP1 within the kidney, real-time PCR was performed using mRNA from microdissected nephron segments as described previously (17Chabardes-Garonne D. Mejean A. Aude J.C. Cheval L. Di Stefano A. Gaillard M.C. Imbert-Teboul M. Wittner M. Balian C. Anthouard V. Robert C. Segurens B. Wincker P. Weissenbach J. Doucet A. Elalouf J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13710-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). KMCP1 RNA seemed to be predominantly expressed in proximal tubules, although a fair amount of expression was also detected in distal tubules and surrounding nephron segments (Fig. 3A). KMCP1 RNA was barely detected in glomeruli, the medullary part of the loop of Henle, and the collecting duct. In situ hybridization showed that KMCP1 RNA was clearly restricted to the renal cortex (Fig. 3B). These experiments confirmed a low level of KMCP1 RNA in the glomeruli and collecting ducts, with higher levels in the proximal and distal tubules. However, KMCP1 expression was as abundant in the distal tubules as in the proximal tubules (Fig. 3C). No staining was observed with a KMCP1 cDNA sense probe (data not shown). Finally, immunochemistry using anti-KMCP1 antibody followed by KMCP1 in situ hybridization within kidney cortex sections showed colocalization of staining between RNA and protein in tubular cells (Fig. 3D). Physiological Challenges and KMCP1 Expression—To understand the physiological relevance of KMCP1 in the kidney, KMCP1 expression levels were recorded in response to several well characterized models of perturbed renal function (Table I). Although a number of these physiological perturbances did not induce any change in KMCP1 expression, we found that a potassium-rich diet, fasting, and some of the drug-induced acute renal failure models significantly increased KMCP1 expression (Table I).Table IKMCP1 RNA variations in various physiological challengesKMCP RNA variationaKMCP1 RNA variations analyzed by Northern blotting are presented as means ± S.E.M.nbn is the number of mice in each group.p valuecp values were calculated versus the control using, one-way analysis of variance.DietWater deprivation for 12 h0.73 ± 0.132NSdNS, not significant; i.p., intraperitoneally; i.m., intramuscularly.Hyponatremic diet (0.01% NaCl)1.13 ± 0.253NSHypernatremic diet (3% NaCl)1.16 ± 0.125NSHyperkalemic diet (3% KCl)1.85 ± 0.365p<0.00118-h fasting1.92 ± 0.0711p<0.001DiureticsFurosemide (i.p., 400 mg/kg, 5 h)0.66 ± 0.084NSAcetazolamide (i.p., 200 mg/kg, 5 h)1.18 ± 0.012NSHydrochlorothiazide (i.p., 200 mg/kg, 5 h)1.30 ± 0.162NSInduced nephrotoxicityMetabolic acidosis (NH4Cl in water, 48 h)1.07 ± 0.104NSCyclosporin A (i.m., 5 mg/kg/d, 3 days)1.11 ± 0.212NSAcetyl cysteine (i.p., 15 mg/kg)1.29 ± 0.062NSGlycerol (i.m., 10 ml/kg of 50%, 3 days)1.81 ± 0.1317p<0.001Gentamicin (i.m., 100 mg/kg/d, 3 days)1.48 ± 0.1010p<0.05Cisplatin (i.p., 20 mg/kg, 3 days)1.75 ± 0.113p<0.05a KMCP1 RNA variations analyzed by Northern blotting are presented as means ± S.E.M.b n is the number of mice in each group.c p values were calculated versus the control using, one-way analysis of variance.d NS, not significant; i.p., intraperitoneally; i.m., intramuscularly. Open table in a new tab KMCP1 Expression during Glycerol-mediated Acute Renal Failure—Because KMCP1 RNA levels increased nearly 2-fold after glycerol injection (Table I), we chose to investigate this model of renal failure in a more detailed manner. Serum blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels were measured, and histological examination of mouse kidney was performed before and 3 h and 1, 2, and 3 days after glycerol injection. Both blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels increased 3 h after glycerol injection (13.7 ± 0.1 versus 5.1 ± 0.2 mmol/liter and 317 ± 37 versus 150 ± 19 mmol/liter, respectively; p < 0.01). During the following days, although creatinine levels progressively decreased to basal levels (164 ± 28 and 160 ± 16 mmol/liter on days 2 and 3, respectively), blood urea nitrogen levels still increased and reached a maximum on days 2 and 3 (46.8 ± 14 mmol/liter (p < 0.001) and 38.2 ± 11 mmol/liter (p < 0.01), respectively). Morphological changes were observed primarily in proximal tubules in the renal cortex. Although the basal membranes of tubules generally remained intact, most of them showed apical brush-border loss as early as 3 h after glycerol injection (Fig. 4A, upper right panel). In a few glomeruli, there was swelling of the mesangial space; however, most of them appeared to be normal. One day following glycerol injection, many of the proximal tubules showed cell vacuolization, detachment of epithelial cells, and necrosis (Fig. 4A, lower left panel). Changes in distal tubule cell morphology were also observed, with epithelial cell flattening and tubule dilatation (Fig. 4A, lower left panel). On days 2 and 3 after glycerol injection, the renal cortex showed a mixture of tubules that had undergone complete necrosis and tubules that had undergone tubular cell regeneration (Fig. 4A, lower right panel). Apoptosis was estimated by performing Western blotting using anti-caspase-3 antibody as well as TUNEL experiments. Caspase-3 levels increased progressively during the days following glycerol injection and reached a maximum on day 3 (2.8 ± 0.4-fold compared with control; p < 0.001) (Fig. 4B). TUNEL experiments conducted at 3 h and 3 days is in the kidney as early as 3 h after glycerol injection (data not shown). No change in the RNA levels of KMCP1 was observed 3 h following the insult (Fig. 4B). However, its expression increased 2–3-fold by days 2 and 3 both at the RNA (p < 0.001) and protein (p < 0.001) levels (Fig. 4B). In situ hybridization showed that KMCP1 RNA was strongly and specifically increased in proximal tubules on days 2 and 3 after glycerol injection (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, although KMCP1 expression did not change in tubules undergoing necrosis, it was highly up-regulated in regenerating tubules (Fig. 4C). In fact, cell proliferation as evidenced by PCNA followed the same time course as KMCP1, with increased levels of PCNA expression observed on days 2 and 3 (Fig. 4B). Cell differentiation as shown by vimentin levels began on day 3 (Fig. 4B). In addition, the level of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 increased progressively during the time course experiment (Fig. 4B) to reach a plateau on day 2. Because carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 regulates entry of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria, where they undergo β-oxidation, its level reflects mitochondrial lipid metabolism. Thus, the highest level of KMCP1 expression concurs with the highest degree of mitochondrial lipid oxidation. These results suggest that increased KMCP1 expression is associated with increased mitochondrial metabolism. Glycerol-mediated Nephrotoxicity Promotes Oxidative Stress— Because a previous study (18Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4390) Google Scholar) suggested that glycerol injection causes renal failure due to oxidative stress, we measured the expression pattern of heme oxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2, which are involved in the generation of superoxide. We also measured superoxide dismutase activity, which is known to be up-regulated in response to oxidative stress. Expression of heme oxygenase-1 was strongly and transiently increased on day 1 after glycerol injection, and expression of cyclooxygenase-2 increased on days 2 and 3 (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5A). Both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial superoxide dismutase activities were increased from day 1 to day 3 (Fig. 5B). It has also"

https://openalex.org/W2021100549,"The oncogenic potential of HTLV-1 Tax protein is partially ascribed to its capacity to activate NF-κB. The current view is that Tax acts first in the cytoplasm to dissociate NF-κB factors from the IκB proteins and enable their nuclear translocation, then Tax links p65(RelA), within the nucleus, to CBP/p300 and P/CAF, which are essential for its optimal transcriptional activity. Our present study challenges the paradigm that Tax–p65(RelA)-CBP/p300 assembly occurs in the nucleus. Using Tax mutants defective for nuclear localization we show that at low levels these mutants induce the nuclear translocation of NF-κB factors but not their transcriptional activity, whereas at high levels they trap CBP and free p65(RelA) in the cytoplasm and block, thereby, their transcriptional function. In contrast, wild-type (w.t.) Tax strongly stimulated NF-κB-dependent gene expression in all tested experimental settings. These data suggest that the Tax–p65(RelA)-CBP ternary complex is established in the cytoplasm rather than in the nucleus. When this complex is formed with w.t. Tax, the entire moiety translocates into the nucleus and exerts high transcriptional activity. However, if the complex is formed with the cytoplasmic Tax mutants, the resulting moiety is retained in the cytoplasm and is, therefore, devoid of transcriptional activity."
https://openalex.org/W2014689616,"We demonstrate using Ca2+-dependent calmodulin (CaM)-affinity chromatography and overlay with biotinylated CaM that the adaptor proteins growth factor receptor bound (Grb)7 and Grb7V (a naturally occurring variant lacking the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain) are CaM-binding proteins. Deletion of an amphiphilic basic amino-acid sequence (residues 243-256) predicted to form an alpha-helix located in the proximal region of its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain demonstrates the location of the CaM-binding domain. This site is identical in human and rodents Grb7, and shares great homology with similar regions of Grb10 and Grb14, and the Mig10 protein from Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that Grb7 and Grb7V are present in the cytosol and bound to membranes, while the deletion mutants (Grb7Delta and Grb7VDelta) have less capacity to be associated to membranes. Grb7Delta maintains in part the capacity to bind phosphoinositides, and CaM competes for phosphoinositide binding. Activation of ErbB2 by heregulin beta1 decreases the pool of Grb7 associated to membranes. The cell-permeable CaM antagonist W7 (N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide), but not the CaM-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor KN93, prevents this effect. Highly specific cell-permeable CaM inhibitory peptides decrease the association of Grb7 to membranes. This suggests that CaM regulates the intracellular mobilization of Grb7 in living cells. Direct interaction between enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP)-Grb7 and enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP)-CaM chimeras at the plasma membrane of living cells was demonstrated by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The FRET signal dramatically decreased in cells loaded with a cell-permeable Ca2+ chelator, and was significantly attenuated when enhanced yellow fluorescent protein-Grb7 chimera (EYFP-Grb7)Delta instead of EYFP-Grb7 was used. Finally, we show that conditioned media from cells transiently transfected with Grb7Delta and Grb7VDelta lost its angiogenic activity, in contrast to those from cells transiently transfected with their wild-type counterparts."

https://openalex.org/W2070906406,"The macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor is encoded by the c-FMS gene, and it has been suggested that altered regulation of c-FMS expression may contribute to leukaemic transformation. c-FMS is expressed in pluripotent haemopoietic precursor cells and is subsequently upregulated during monocytic differentiation, but downregulated during granulopoiesis. We have examined transcription factor occupancy and aspects of chromatin structure of the critical c-FMS regulatory element located within the second intron (FIRE - fms intonic regulatory element) during normal and leukaemic myelopoiesis. Granulocytic differentiation from normal and leukaemic precursors is accompanied by loss of transcription factors at FIRE and downregulated c-FMS expression. The presence of AML1-ETO in leukaemic cells does not prevent this disassembly. In nonleukaemic cells, granulocytic differentiation is accompanied by reversal to a chromatin fine structure characteristic of c-FMS-nonexpressing cells. In addition, we show that low-level expression of the gene in leukaemic blast cells and granulocytes does not associate with increased CpG methylation across the c-FMS locus."
https://openalex.org/W1991657373,"We have previously demonstrated an association between microsatellite instability and decreased CDK2-AP1 (p12(DOC-1)) expression in human colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines. In those same studies, induction of CDK2-AP1 expression promoted both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The goals of our present study were to better understand the mechanisms leading to reduced CDK2-AP1 expression in microsatellite unstable (MSI) CRC and to study further the effect of CDK2-AP1 modulation on cell proliferation and apoptosis utilizing RNA interference (RNAi) techniques. We used direct sequencing to screen for mutations of the poly (T)8 microsatellite-like region in the 3' end of the CDK2-AP1 gene in 24 CRC cell lines. We then utilized an in vitro human mismatch repair (MMR) recombinant system to assess for correction of the mutation and changes in CDK2-AP1 expression secondary to hMLH1 transfection. We also investigated the effect of CDK2-AP1 modulation in four settings: (1) native CDK2-AP1 absence, (2) endogenous CDK2-AP1 expression, (3) RNAi-induced CDK2-AP1 inhibition and (4) induced CDK2-AP1 over expression. The mutation - del T poly (T)8 - at the 3' end of the CDK2-AP1 gene was found in 3/12 (25%) of MSI CRC cell lines, but in none of the microsatellite stable samples (0/12). Interestingly, when wild-type MMR protein - MLH1 - was induced in an in vitro human recombinant system, the del T poly (T)8 mutation was reversed and CDK2-AP1 expression increased. RNAi-mediated CDK2-AP1 inhibition was associated with decreased apoptosis and increased cell proliferation in CDK2-AP1-non deficient CRC cell lines. We conclude that mutations in the microsatellite-like sequence of the CDK2-AP1 gene in MSI CRC are associated with decreased CDK2-AP1 expression. In addition, modulation of CDK2-AP1 expression in human CRC alters cell proliferation and apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2039847605,"Gene-silencing activity mediated by siRNA has been demonstrated in mammalian cells; however, the mechanism of its regulation is not well understood. Since downregulation of a number of genes occurs during adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP)-induced differentiation of neuroblastoma (NB) cells, it is possible that cAMP may play a role in regulating siRNA activity during differentiation. To study this, we utilized an NB cell line (NBP2-PN25) that expresses a short-lived green fluorescent protein (d2EGFP) under the CMV promoter. These cells were transfected with a retroviral plasmid that expresses U6 promoter-driven expression of siRNA targeted to d2EGFP and then were treated with cAMP-elevating agents (200 μg/ml RO20-1724, an inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, and 1 μg/ml prostaglandin A1, a stimulator of adenylate cyclase) for 2 or 24 h. The siRNA activity was measured by determining the level of intensity of d2EGFP protein by flow cytometry, and the level of d2EGFP mRNA by real-time PCR. The results showed that cAMP-elevating agents enhanced U6-driven siRNA activity directed towards d2EGFP in NB cells 24 h after treatment. One of the mechanisms of action of cAMP is mediated via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition; therefore, we have investigated the effect of a PI3K inhibitor on siRNA activity. This study showed that inhibition of PI3K also enhanced U6-driven siRNA activity towards d2EGFP. cAMP-stimulating agents increased U6 transcript levels, perhaps suggesting that increased siRNA activity may in part be due to an increase in transcriptional activity. When NB cells were transfected with a synthetic siRNA directed to d2EGFP, both cAMP elevation and PI3K inhibition similarly enhanced siRNA activity. Sodium butyrate, which inhibits the growth of NB cells similar to the effect produced by cAMP, did not affect U6-driven siRNA activity towards d2EGFP. Protein kinase C (PKC) activation or inhibition also failed to affect siRNA activity in NB cells. This study also showed that cAMP elevation and PI3K inhibition increases U6-driven siRNA activity directed towards an endogenous gene, p53. Our data suggest a role for the cAMP pathway in affecting the efficacy of siRNA system during differentiation of NB cells."
