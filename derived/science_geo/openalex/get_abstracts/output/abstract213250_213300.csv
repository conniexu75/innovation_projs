 of the active microsomal protein, and described some of the properties of the soluble system. This and other studies
 seemed to make clear that the integrity of microsomes as organized particles was not required for catalyzing the reactivation
 of the reduced forms of ribonuclease and lysozyme. Their findings suggested that the microsomal system might function to
 facilitate the conversion of at least two different polypeptide chains to the corresponding native proteins during the synthesis
 of most proteins containing disulfide bonds."

Direct proof that mevalonic and fatty acid syntheses are accomplished by an avian enzyme system through enzyme-bound intermediates was provided in a preliminary communication from our laboratory (3). Direct proof of the formation of enzyme-bound intermediates in fatty acid biosynthesis by an enzyme preparation of Escherichia coli was provided earlier in reports of the isolation of acetoacetyl-enzyme (4) and its conversion to butyryl-enzyme (5) and long chain fatty acids (4), and a report of the conversion of butyryl-enzyme to caproylenzyme (5). Earlier work by Lynen (6) also established that acetoacetyl-enzyme is formed by a particulate yeast enzyme system partially purified for the synthesis of fatty acids. The recent preliminary communication from our laboratory (3) provided the first direct evidence that the formation of malonyl-enzyme is the initial step in the synthesis of mevalonic and fatt,y acids by a pigeon liver enzyme system. Dat.a were presented to show that radioactivity of malonyl-enzyme was incorporated into @-hydroxy-P-methylglutaryl coenzyme A as well as into long chain fatty acids. In the present report this information is amplified and extended to include the synthesis of acetoacetyl-enzyme, butyryl-enzyme, and &ketohesanoylenzyme from malonyl-enzyme. Data are also presented to show the formation of acetyl-enzyme and butyryl-enzyme, and the synthesis of fatty acids from each of these compounds. The possibility that a long chain polyketo compound might be formed as an intermediate has also been investigated. No evidence was obtained to support, this proposal."

https://openalex.org/W2409213961,"The original observation of Brady and Gurin (1) and Dituri and Gurin (2) that citrate stimulated fatty acid biosynthesis has been confirmed and extended by many other workers (3-8). Brady, Mamoon, and Stadtman (4) showed that the stimulation of fatty acid synthesis by citrate was due in part to the generation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) by cis-aconitase and isocitrate dehydrogenase present in the enzyme preparation. They could partially replace the citrate effect by adding NADPH or other NADPH-generating systems. The replacement did not enhance biosynthesis as much as citrate, indicating that citrate probably played still another role in this biosynthetic process. In 1962, Martin and Vagelos (9, 10) showed that citrate specifically stimulated the acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase reaction in rat adipose tissue preparations. This reaction had been reported to be the rate-limiting step for fabty acid synthesis in a number of tissues (11, 12). Similar results were obtained by Waite and Wakil (13), who showed that isocitrate stimulated the catalytic activity of acetyl-CoA carboxylase from chicken liver. It would seem likely, therefore, that in addition to acting as a source of NADI’H, part of the stimulatory effect of citrate observed with soluble crude enzyme systems was due to the activating effect of citrate on the carbosylating enzyme. It should be noted, however, that the concentration of citrate needed for maximal fatty acid synthesis and for maximal carbosyla,tion activation is very high, about 10 pmoles per ml. We have reported a third role of citrate in fatty acid biosynthesis, that of a carbon source via the citrate cleavage enzyme (8). Recently Wakil et al. (14, 15) reported the elongation of fatty acids in a mitochondrial system by the successive addition of acetyl-Cog to intermediate chain length fatty acyl-CoAs (Cl0 to C,,). Similar results were reported by Stumpf and Barber (16) in mitochondria derived from avocado mesocarp. In addition to these chain elongation observations, Htilsmann (17, 18) has reported on the biosynthesis of fatty acids in rat or rabbit heart sarcosomes. The amount of fatty acid synthesis de nova in mitochondria, in all cases, is significantly lower than that observed with soluble enzyme systems. Moreover, even the combined rate of chain elongation, desaturation, and synthesis de novo is considerably lower than the rate of synthesis obtained with soluble enzyme systems."

https://openalex.org/W2026728962,"Lehmann and Ryan1 have noted the familial incidence of the low levels of serum pseudocholinesterase seen in several patients who were examined because of prolonged apnœa following the administration of suxamethonium. Kalow2 confirmed the hereditary nature of the hypersensibility to suxamethonium and studied the kinetics of the pseudocholinesterase of normal and drug sensitive individuals, discovering that they differed in their activity towards several substrates and their resistance to different inhibitors. The latter property was utilized to devise a technique3 called dibucaine number (DN) which clearly differentiated4 three types of persons that corresponded presumably to: (a) normal homozygotes characterized by having DN above 72; (b) abnormal homozygotes with DN below 35; (c) heterozygotes with DN between 45 and 68. Family studies suggested that one pair of allelic genes now called E1u E1a (Motulsky5) controlled the type of pseudocholinesterase present."

https://openalex.org/W2061725580,"CELLULAR changes accompanying ageing are known to occur in a number of organs, for example, liver1, bile ducts2, pancreas3, thyroid4 and prostate5, and may be due to an intrinsic change in the tissue cells or to humoral changes in the host. Most of this work, however, is based on histological investigations of fixed material and little is known about the biological potential of these tissues. In a preliminary investigation5 the response to hormones of prostatic tissue from young (1.5 months), adult (4–5 months) and old (24 months) mice was investigated in organ cultures and differences in reaction were described. The prostates of the old mice also showed a general epithelial atrophy, but with areas of giant cells and presumed hyperdiploid cells with large irregular nuclei. When these tissues were maintained in vitro on a medium containing normal adult human serum some of these changes regressed, but the cultures were maintained for a relatively short time (21 days). To investigate the effects of the humoral environment on tissues of different ages for longer periods, a series of experiments were carried out by grafting old and young prostatic tissue into hosts of different ages. These animals can be described as age chimeras6."
https://openalex.org/W1970412774,"DURING the course of investigations designed primarily for the characterization of mammalian tissue antibodies, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis was produced in guinea pigs by subcutaneous inoculation with an emulsion of rabbit brain in complete Freund's adjuvant. The principles of laboratory animal care as promulgated by the National Society for Medical Research were observed. In a representative experiment, encephalomyelitis was clinically manifested by paralysis in 6 of 8 animals. Circulating haemolytic complement (C′)1 levels, however, were unaltered after the injection of brain and during the course of illness, even though the paralysis usually terminated in death. The failure to detect changes of C′-levels in this condition lends support to Waksman's generalization that changes in C′ have not proved to be very useful as indices for characterizing the pathological mechanisms of certain human diseases2. In allergic encephalomyelitis, however, the blood-brain barrier may interpose a particularly severe restriction as far as changes in (C-levels may be concerned."

https://openalex.org/W2082660082,"IN spite of the claims of other systems, paper chromatography remains a major analytical tool of forensic toxicology. One of its minor disadvantages is that, in order to get sufficient material on to the paper to give an identifiable spot, a dilute solution must be applied by the tedious process of ‘spotting’ small aliquots and allowing them to dry between each application. We wish to report a very simple and reliable method in which the solution is allowed to flow continuously on to the paper, producing a spot about 0.5 cm in diameter."

https://openalex.org/W2002934143,"IN our laboratory, it was thought that work being done on oviduct physiology could be fostered by observing segments of oviduct under the influence of hormones and autonomic drugs. As transplants, the oviduct segments would not be influenced by a variable nerve supply. The hamster has very few histocompatibility genes, but these are capable of producing an antigen–antibody reaction that results in as strong a rejection of tissue as is produced by animals having innumerable histocompatibility genes. It is probably the structure of the cheek pouch, itself, which allows foreign tissue to be accepted."

Little has been published concerning the pharmacology of N-substituted hydroxylamines although Jones and Major2 examined the action of a series of hydroxylamino analogues of certain biologically active amines and Lewin3 commented on the toxicity of N-phenylhydroxylamine."
