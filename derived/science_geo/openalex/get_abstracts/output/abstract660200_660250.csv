https://openalex.org/W3088133050,"Background In the Republic of Korea (ROK), social distancing and public behavior changes mitigated COVID-19 spread. However, a second wave of the epidemic is expected in the fall if neither vaccine nor antiviral drugs become available. This study investigated the impact of non-pharmaceutical measures on short- and long-term outbreak dynamics. Methods A mathematical model based on Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered model is developed considering isolated and behavior-changed groups. Using the least-squares fitting method, transmission and behavior change rates were estimated using cases reported from February 16 to April 20, 2020. Findings The estimated transmission rate of COVID-19 was 4·6180 and behavior change rate was 2·6044. The model predicted the number of new cases to continuously decrease, with less than one case expected after May 6, 2020. Concurrently, a 25% reduction in behavioral changes during the outbreak would increase the case count by 60,000, resulting in 4,000 cases at maximum, exceeding the medical system’s capacity. As behavioral restrictions are eased, local transmission will likely increase, with forecasted second wave peak in October 2020. Interpretation Social distancing and public behavior changes have curbed the spread of COVID-19 in the ROK. Mathematical modeling demonstrates the importance of these measures in reducing and delaying outbreaks. Nevertheless, non-pharmaceutical interventions cannot eliminate the disease. In the future, vaccines and antiviral treatments combined with social distancing and public behavior changes will be paramount to ending COVID-19 epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W3088814033,"Background Suicide is a common phenomenon affecting people of all ages. There is a strong relationship between suicidal ideation and depressive disorders. Increasing number of studies suggest that epigenetic modifications in certain brain areas are the main mechanism through which environmental and genetic factors interact with each other contributing to the development of mental disorders. To verify this hypothesis, some epigenetic marks: H3K9/14ac, HDAC2/3, H3K27me2 and Sin3a, as well as p-S421-MeCP2/MeCP2 were examined. On the other hand, BDNF protein level were studied. Materials and methods Western blot analysis were performed in the frontal cortex (FCx) and hippocampus (HP) of suicide victims (n = 14) and non-suicidal controls (n = 8). The differences between groups and correlations between selected proteins were evaluated using Mann-Whitney U-test and Spearman’s rank correlation. Results Statistically significant decrease in H3K9/14ac (FCx:↓~23%;HP:↓~33%) combined with increase in HDAC3 (FCx:↑~103%;HP:↑~85% in HP) protein levels in suicides compared to the controls was shown. These alterations were accompanied by an increase in H3K27me2 (FCx:↑45%;HP:↑~59%) and Sin3a (HP:↑50%) levels and decrease in p-S421-MeCP2/MeCP2 protein ratio (HP:↓~55%;FCx:↓~27%). Moreover, reduced BDNF protein level (FCx:↓~43%;HP:↓~28%) in suicides was observed. On the other hand, some significant correlations (e.g. between H3K9/14ac and HDAC2 or between BDNF and p-S421-MeCP2/MeCP2) were demonstrated. Conclusions Our findings confirm the role of epigenetic component and BDNF protein in suicidal behavior. Lowered BDNF protein level in suicides is probably due to decrease in histone acetylation and increased level of factors related with deacetylation and methylation processes, including MeCP2 factor, which may operate bidirectionally (an activator or inhibitor of transcription)."
https://openalex.org/W3088506753,"The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has challenged many healthcare systems around the world. While most of the current understanding of the clinical features of COVID-19 is derived from Chinese studies, there is a relative paucity of reports from the remaining global health community. In this study, we analyze the clinical and radiologic factors that correlate with mortality odds in COVID-19 positive patients from a tertiary care center in Tehran, Iran. A retrospective cohort study of 90 patients with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive COVID-19 infection was conducted, analyzing demographics, co-morbidities, presenting symptoms, vital signs, laboratory values, chest radiograph findings, and chest CT features based on mortality. Chest radiograph was assessed using the Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema (RALE) scoring system. Chest CTs were assessed according to the opacification pattern, distribution, and standardized severity score. Initial and follow-up Chest CTs were compared if available. Multiple logistic regression was used to generate a prediction model for mortality. The 90 patients included 59 men and 31 women (59.4 ± 16.6 years), including 21 deceased and 69 surviving patients. Among clinical features, advanced age (p = 0.02), low oxygenation saturation (p<0.001), leukocytosis (p = 0.02), low lymphocyte fraction (p = 0.03), and low platelet count (p = 0.048) were associated with increased mortality. High RALE score on initial chest radiograph (p = 0.002), presence of pleural effusions on initial CT chest (p = 0.005), development of pleural effusions on follow-up CT chest (p = 0.04), and worsening lung severity score on follow-up CT Chest (p = 0.03) were associated with mortality. A two-factor logistic model using patient age and oxygen saturation was created, which demonstrates 89% accuracy and area under the ROC curve of 0.86 (p<0.0001). Specific demographic, clinical, and imaging features are associated with increased mortality in COVID-19 infections. Attention to these features can help optimize patient management."
https://openalex.org/W3089007535,"Immunotherapy checkpoint inhibitors, such as antibodies targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4, have demonstrated the potential of harnessing the immune system to treat cancer. However, despite encouraging results particularly with respect to survival, only a minority of patients benefit from these therapies. In clinical studies aimed at understanding changes in the immune system following immunotherapy treatment, ICOS (Inducible T cell CO-Stimulator) was shown to be significantly up-regulated on CD4+ T cells and this was associated with clinical activity, indicating that ICOS stimulatory activity may be beneficial in the treatment of solid tumors. In this report, we describe the generation of specific, species cross-reactive, agonist antibodies to ICOS, including the humanized clinical candidate, JTX-2011 (vopratelimab). Preclinical studies suggest that the ICOS stimulating antibodies require Fc receptor cross-linking for optimal agonistic activity. Notably, the ICOS antibodies do not exhibit superagonist properties but rather require T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated upregulation of ICOS for agonist activity. Treatment with the ICOS antibodies results in robust anti-tumor benefit and long-term protection in preclinical syngeneic mouse tumor models. Additional benefit is observed when the ICOS antibodies are administered in combination with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapies. Based on the preclinical data, JTX-2011 is currently being developed in the clinical setting for the treatment of solid tumors."
https://openalex.org/W3087842001,"To investigate the impact of endometrial thickness on the embryo transfer(ET) day on the clinical pregnancy outcomes of frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycles which have undergone hormone replacement therapy(HRT-FET).A total of 10,165 HRT-FET cycles performed between January 2013 to December 2017 in the Reproductive Medicine Center of Henan Provincial People's Hospital were studied retrospectively. All patients were grouped according to their endometrial thickness on the ET day (each group having an increment of 1mm between two neighboring groups). Multivariate regression analysis, curve fitting and threshold effect analysis were performed on all data.After adjusting for the age, duration of infertility, body mass index(BMI), infertility type and number and type of embryos transferred, a significant correlation was observed to be between the endometrial thickness and implantation rates (aOR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.06-1.10, p < 0.0001), clinical pregnancy rate(aOR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.07-1.14, p < 0.0001)and live birth rate (aOR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.06-1.12, p < 0.0001). The numerical value of the cut-off point for the endometrial thickness was 8.7 mm. When the endometrial thickness was less than 8.7 mm, with each additional 1 mm of endometrial thickness, the implantation rate increased by 32%, the clinical pregnancy rate increased by 36%, and the live birth rate increased by 45%.In the HRT-FET cycles, the optimal live birth rate would be obtained when the endometrial thickness remains within the range of 8.7-14.5 mm. If the endometrium is too thin or too thick, the live birth rate will be reduced."
https://openalex.org/W3088631570,"Introduction Commencing breastfeeding within one hour of birth is defined as early initiation of breastfeeding (EIBF). Both the mother and child benefit from EIBF. This study aims to identify the predictors of EIBF among Indonesian women. Methods This paper analyses data from a weighted sample of 6,616 women collected at the Indonesia Demographic and Health Survey (IDHS) 2017.The frequency of EIBF is measured by the proportion of children born in the two years preceding the survey who received breastmilk within one hour of birth. The analysis uses bivariate and multivariate logistic regression for complex sample designs, adjusted for confounders to examine the relationship of EIBF with women’s individual, household and community level characteristics. Results Overall, 57% (95% CI: 54.9%-58.2%) of the children born in the two years preceding the survey had EIBF. Statistically significant (p<0.05) predictors of EIBF are women’s non-working status, second or higher order of the birth of the most recent child, average or large size of the most recent child at birth, poor status of the household and non-agricultural work of the woman’s husband; while statistically highly significant (p<0.01) predictors are skin-to-skin contact with the new-born (OR: 2.62; 95% CI: 2.28–3.00), Caesarean deliveries (OR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.40–0.56), and skilled birth attendants (OR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.65–2.08). Caesarean deliveries reduce the likelihood of EIBF by half compared to vaginal deliveries. Women’s age, education or rural-urban residence display no statistically significant relationship with EIBF. Conclusion Skin-to-skin contact, mode of delivery and type of birth attendance exert the strongest influence on EIBF in Indonesia in 2017. EIBF should be continuously promoted and supported particularly among mothers who do not have early skin-to-skin contact with their new-born, who have Caesarean deliveries and who have no skilled birth attendant."
https://openalex.org/W3088728999,"Background Healthcare workers around the world are experiencing skin injury due to the extended use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic. These injuries are the result of high shear stresses acting on the skin, caused by friction with the PPE. This study aims to provide a practical lubricating solution for frontline medical staff working a 4+ hours shift wearing PPE. Methods A literature review into skin friction and skin lubrication was conducted to identify products and substances that can reduce friction. We evaluated the lubricating performance of commercially available products in vivo using a custom-built tribometer. Findings Most lubricants provide a strong initial friction reduction, but only few products provide lubrication that lasts for four hours. The response of skin to friction is a complex interplay between the lubricating properties and durability of the film deposited on the surface and the response of skin to the lubricating substance, which include epidermal absorption, occlusion, and water retention. Interpretation Talcum powder, a petrolatum-lanolin mixture, and a coconut oil-cocoa butter-beeswax mixture showed excellent long-lasting low friction. Moisturising the skin results in excessive friction, and the use of products that are aimed at ‘moisturising without leaving a non-greasy feel’ should be prevented. Most investigated dressings also demonstrate excellent performance."
https://openalex.org/W3088943791,"Dystrophin plays a vital role in maintaining muscle health, yet low mRNA expression, lengthy transcription time and the limitations of traditional in-situ hybridization (ISH) methodologies mean that the dynamics of dystrophin transcription remain poorly understood. RNAscope is highly sensitive ISH method that can be multiplexed, allowing detection of individual transcript molecules at sub-cellular resolution, with different target mRNAs assigned to distinct fluorophores. We instead multiplex within a single transcript, using probes targeted to the 5’ and 3’ regions of muscle dystrophin mRNA. Our approach shows this method can reveal transcriptional dynamics in health and disease, resolving both nascent myonuclear transcripts and exported mature mRNAs in quantitative fashion (with the latter absent in dystrophic muscle, yet restored following therapeutic intervention). We show that even in healthy muscle, immature dystrophin mRNA predominates (60–80% of total), with the surprising implication that the half-life of a mature transcript is markedly shorter than the time invested in transcription: at the transcript level, supply may exceed demand. Our findings provide unique spatiotemporal insight into the behaviour of this long transcript (with implications for therapeutic approaches), and further suggest this modified multiplex ISH approach is well-suited to long genes, offering a highly tractable means to reveal complex transcriptional dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W3088222638,"Apple replant disease (ARD) is a serious threat to producers of apple trees and fruits worldwide. The ARD etiology is not unraveled and managing options are either economically not applicable or environmentally harmful. Thus, interest is given in biomarkers that allow to indicate ARD situations at early time points in order to classify soils according to ARD severity but also to analyze the effectiveness to potential countermeasures. This study aimed at (i) identifying ARD biomarkers on the transcriptional level in root tissue by analyzing the expression of previously identified candidate genes in ARD soils of different origin and texture and (ii) testing the specificity of these marker genes to ARD. In vitro propagated M26 plantlets were submitted to a bio-test with three ARD soils, either untreated or disinfected by γ-irradiation. Expression of seven candidate genes identified in a previous transcriptomic study was investigated by RT-qPCR in a time course experiment. Already three days after planting, a prominent upregulation of the phytoalexin biosynthesis genes biphenyl synthase 3 (BIS3) and biphenyl 4-hydroxylase (B4Hb) was observed in the untreated ARD variants of all three soils. The phytoalexin composition in roots was comparable for all three soils and the total phytoalexin content correlated with the expression of BIS3 and B4Hb. The third promising candidate gene that was upregulated under ARD conditions was the ethylene-responsive transcription factor 1B-like (ERF1B). In a second experiment M26 plantlets were exposed to different abiotic stressors, namely heat, salt and nutrient starvation, and candidate gene expression was determined in the roots. The expression levels of BIS3 and B4Hb were highly and specifically upregulated in ARD soil, but not upon the abiotic stress conditions, whereas ERF1B also showed higher expression under heat stress. In conclusion, BIS3 and B4Hb are recommended as early ARD biomarkers due to their high expression levels and their high specificity."
https://openalex.org/W3088538291,"Background Anemia is a major public health concern among women of reproductive age leading to high maternal mortality in low- and middle-income countries. Of the prior studies conducted in Pakistan, most focused on large urban areas and did not explore the determinants of anemia among women of reproductive age (WRA) across socio-demographic, dietary, reproductive, and biological domains. Thus, we aimed to study the prevalence and determinants of anemia among WRA in rural Pakistan. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study in the Thatta district of Pakistan from September 2018 to January 2019 and enrolled 150 non-pregnant, married women. Data collectors administered a structured questionnaire to collect sociodemographic, reproductive and dietary data from women, who also provided stool and blood samples. We classified all WRA as anemic if their hemoglobin was <12.0 g/dl. We performed logistic regression analysis to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and their respective 95% CIs to assess the determinants of anemia. Results In our study, 61.3% of the enrolled women were anemic. In the multivariable analysis, we found that factors such as serum iron levels of less than 50 μg/dl (aOR: 7.17; 95% CI (2.94, 17.47)), history of breastfeeding (aOR: 2.43; 95% CI (1.04, 5.72)), living in a katcha house (aOR: 6.61; 95% CI (2.21, 19.87)), no consumption of meat (aOR: 4.18; 95% CI (1.66, 9.96)) were significantly associated with anemia among WRA. A history of more than one abortion (aOR: 0.06; 95% CI (0.01, 0.33) appeared protective for its association with anemia. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate a high burden of anemia and its complex determinants among WRA in rural Pakistan. A combination of nutritional and educational strategies should be designed to encourage rural women to consume iron-rich foods in their diet with an access to adequate food. Breastfeeding women should be encouraged to consume extra calories with sufficient intake of the food to continue exclusive breastfeeding and reserve the iron stores through amenorrhea to prevent themselves from becoming anemic."
https://openalex.org/W3088638542,"There is increasing interest in documenting adaptation of weedy plant species to agricultural ecosystems, beyond the evolution of herbicide resistance. Waterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus) is a native plant of the Midwestern U.S. that began infesting agricultural fields in the 20th century within the central portion of its range. We hypothesized that the vegetative growth and reproductive traits of waterhemp from this heavily infested central region provide differential fitness benefits in agricultural environments. We collected seeds from across the species’ native range, representing regions with varying degrees of waterhemp infestation, and planted them together in common garden soybean plots. A 2010 common garden experiment was conducted within the range of agriculturally weedy waterhemp (in Missouri), and a 2011 common garden experiment was conducted outside of this range (in Ohio). Days to flowering and flowering plant height, mature plant size data (height, number of branches, and length of the longest branch), and above-ground biomass were measured to estimate relative fitness. In both common garden locations, plants from regions where waterhemp occurs as an agricultural weed — including those from the heavily infested Mississippi Valley region (Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri) and the less severely infested Plains region (Nebraska, Kansas, and Oklahoma) — had higher relative performance in almost all fitness-related measures than plants from the Northeast region (Ohio, Michigan, and Ontario), which had little to no agriculturally weedy waterhemp at the time of our study. Further analysis revealed that fewer days to flowering in the Northeast populations can be largely accounted for by latitude of origin, suggesting a strong genetic influence on this reproductive trait. These findings suggest intraspecific variation in agricultural adaptation in a native U.S. weed, and support the use of agricultural weeds to study adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W3087778084,"Monitoring of cyanobacteria in freshwater ecosystems is a complex task, which is time consuming and expensive due to the chaotic population dynamics and highly heterogeneous distribution of cyanobacteria populations in water bodies. The financial cost constitutes a strong limitation for the implementation of long-term monitoring programs in developing countries, particularly in Africa. The work presented here was performed in the framework of an international project addressing the sustainable monitoring and management of surface water resources used for the production of drinking water in three African countries. We tested the potential of a citizen approach for monitoring cyanobacterial blooms, which are a growing threat to the drinking water supply. This pilot study was designed, implemented and evaluated in close interaction with the Pasteur Institute of the Ivory Coast and with the populations of three villages located on the shoreline of a freshwater lagoon located near Abidjan city. Based on the use of a smartphone application, the citizens of the three villages were invited to report water color changes, as these changes could reflect cyanobacteria proliferations. A two-year experimentation period has shown that it is possible to mobilize the local populations to monitor cyanobacterial blooms. The data collected by citizens were consistent with the data obtained by a classical monitoring of cyanobacteria performed over seven months, but it appeared that new approaches were needed to validate the citizen data. This participatory approach also provided great improvements to the understanding and awareness of local populations regarding water quality and cyanobacterial bloom issues. Finally, we discuss some of the difficulties and limitations of our participatory monitoring approach that should be considered by further implementations. Despite these difficulties, our work suggests that citizen monitoring is a promising approach that may complement the classical approach to sustainable monitoring of cyanobacteria in developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W3087809393,"Background Bone abnormality and leg disease in commercial broiler flocks are increasingly prominent, causing serious economic losses to the broiler breeding industry. Valgus-varus deformity (VVD) is a common deformity of the long bone in broilers that manifests as an outward or inward deviation of the tibiotarsus or tarsometatarsus. There is a paucity of studies on the molecular mechanisms of VVD. Results In this study, 6 cDNA libraries were constructed from spleen samples from VVD birds and normal birds. A total of 1951 annotated lncRNAs, 7943 novel lncRNAs and 30252 mRNAs were identified by RNA-sequencing. In addition, 420 differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs and 124 differentially expressed lncRNAs (adjusted P-value < 0.05) were obtained. A total of 16 dysregulated genes were confirmed by qPCR to be consistent with the results of the RNA-Seq. The functional lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network was constructed using differentially expressed mRNAs and target genes of the differentially expressed lncRNAs. 11 DE genes were obtained from the analysis. In order to gain insight into the interactions of genes, lncRNAs and pathways associated with VVD, we focused on the following pathways, which are involved in immunity and bone development: the Jak-stat signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Wnt-signaling pathway, mTOR signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway, Notch signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling pathway and Fanconi anemia pathway. All together, 30 candidate DE genes were obtained from these pathways. We then analyzed the interaction between the DE genes and their corresponding lncRNAs. From these interaction network analyses we found that GARS, NFIC, PIK3R1, BMP6, NOTCH1, ACTB and CREBBP were the key core nodes of these networks. Conclusion This study showed that differentially expressed genes and signaling pathways were related to immunity or bone development. These results increase the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of VVD and provide some reference for the etiology and pathogenesis of VVD."
https://openalex.org/W3088834865,"Background Poor knowledge concerning appropriate antibiotic use significantly influences the misuse of antibiotics within the community, especially in developing countries where there are weaker health systems to regulate antibiotic dispensing. Antibiotic misuse leads to antibiotic resistance. This study assessed knowledge of appropriate antibiotic use among buyers in the Moshi municipality, Northern Tanzania. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study in Moshi municipality between April and May 2017. Adults who bought antibiotics at drug outlets were invited to participate in the study. An exit interview was conducted with participants to collect their demographics and assess their knowledge concerning appropriate use of antibiotics. A logistic regression model was performed to determine factors associated with correct knowledge concerning antibiotic use. Results A total of 152 adults with a median age of 30.5 (IQR 25–42) years, were enrolled in the study. Slightly over half (n = 89, 58.6%), responded that they should stop antibiotics after finishing the dose as directed. Half (n = 77, 50.7%) thought that it was acceptable to share antibiotics with other individuals and over half of respondents (n = 95, 65.1%) thought that they should request the same antibiotics if they had used them to treat a similar illness in the past. Only 38 (25%) had adequate knowledge about the use of antibiotics. Sore throat and flu were respectively identified by 62.5% and 46.1% of respondents as conditions that can be treated with antibiotics. Higher levels of education (aOR = 4.11 95%CI = 1.44–11.71) and having health insurance (aOR = 9.05 95%CI = 3.35–24.45) were associated with better levels of knowledge concerning antibiotic use in various illnesses. Conclusion There is inadequate knowledge concerning the indications for antibiotics and their appropriate usage. Health promotion campaigns are needed to educate the population about appropriate antibiotic use and reduce their irrational use."
https://openalex.org/W3089069981,"Background Tuberculosis (TB) is amongst the top five causes of death in women of childbearing age (15-≤44 years). Little is known about treatment of pregnant women with drug-resistant TB (DR-TB). Treatment for pregnant women remains challenging and more complex in DR-TB/HIV co-infection, where an evidence-based guide to clinical practice is limited. The study reviewed treatment and pregnancy outcomes and birth outcomes of their new-born in a cohort of pregnant women with DR-TB from three MDR-TB hospitals during 2010 and 2018. Design/Methods Data were extracted from: TB register and patient clinic notes using a standardized case record form. Information on DR-TB treatment, pregnancy and Adverse Drug Events (ADEs) of twenty-six pregnant women treated with individualized second-line TB medications were captured. The frequency of favourable and adverse outcomes regarding disease and pregnancy were evaluated. Results The mean age was 29 years (SD ±5.1), with the minimum and maximum age of 21 and 40 years, respectively. Eleven (42.3%) were previously treated with first-line TB drugs, 11 (42.3%) never treated before and 4 (15.4%) were previously treated for DR-TB. Of the 26 women, 15 (57.7%) had at least one ADE, but most had more than one ADE. Seventeen women were successfully treated, and 22 live births recorded. Live birth outcome was significantly associated with trimester of initiation of DR-TB treatment (p = 0.036). The proportion of live births for the pregnancy trimester when DR-TB treatment was initiated, were 60.0%, 90.9% and 100.0%, for first, second and third trimester, respectively. Conclusion DR-TB treatment should be delayed until after the first trimester. Routine pharmacovigilance surveillance integrated antenatal and delivery services with an integrated record of DR-TB treatment during pregnancy is recommended. Prospective studies using standardised case record forms for DR-TB treatment for pregnant women could provide more insight on the effect of DR-TB treatment on the birth outcome."
https://openalex.org/W3089254537,"Distracted driving is a leading cause of traffic accidents. Certain executive functions significantly affect the willingness of distracted driving; however, little research has compared the effects of executive functions on distracted driving behaviors in different aged populations. This study explores and compares the behavioral and cognitive processes underlying distracted driving behaviors in young and mature drivers. A total of 138 participants aged 18–65 years old completed a self-report questionnaire for measuring executive function index and distracted driving behaviors. Independent sample t-tests were conducted for executive functions (motivational drive, organization, strategic planning, impulse control, and empathy) and driving variables to examine any differences between young and mature groups. Partial correlation coefficients and z-score of these comparisons were calculated to compare the differences between age groups. Furthermore, multiple hierarchical regression models were constructed to determine the relative contributions of age, gender, and executive functions on distracted driving behaviors. Results demonstrated the following: (1) Mature drivers performed better for impulse control, the executive function index as well as the measure of distracted driving behavior than young drivers; (2) the relationships between executive functions and distracted driving behaviors did not significantly differ between young and mature drivers; (3) for both young and mature drivers, motivational drive and impulse control were found to significantly improve the prediction of distracted driving behavior in regression models. The findings emphasize that similar behavioral and cognitive processes are involved in distracted driving behavior of young and mature drivers, and can promote a single strategy for driver education and accident prevention interventions for both age groups."
https://openalex.org/W3087801212,"Introduction Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has revolutionised the care of HIV-positive individuals resulting in marked decreases in morbidity and mortality, and markedly reduced transmission to sexual partners. However, these benefits can only be realised if individuals are aware of their HIV-positive status, initiated and retained on suppressive lifelong ART. Framed using the socio-ecological model, the present study explores factors contributing to poor ART uptake among community members despite high acceptance of HIV-testing within a Treatment as Prevention (TasP) trial. In this paper we identify barriers and facilitators to treatment across different levels of the socio-ecological framework covering individual, community and health system components. Methods This research was embedded within a cluster-randomised trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01509508) of HIV treatment as Prevention in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Data were collected between January 2013 and July 2014 from resident community members. Ten participants contributed to repeat in-depth interviews whilst 42 participants took part in repeat focus group discussions. Data from individual interviews and focus group discussions were triangulated using community walks to give insights into community members’ perception of the barriers and facilitators of ART uptake. We used thematic analysis guided by a socio-ecological framework to analyse participants’ narratives from both individual interviews and focus group discussions. Results Barriers and facilitators operating at the individual, community and health system levels influence ART uptake. Stigma was an over-arching barrier, across all three levels and expressed variably as fear of HIV disclosure, concerns about segregated HIV clinical services and negative community religious perceptions. Other barriers were individual (substance misuse, fear of ART side effects), community (alternative health beliefs). Facilitators cited by participants included individual (expectations of improved health and longer life expectancy following ART, single tablet regimens), community (availability of ART in the community through mobile trial facilities) and health system factors (fast and efficient service provided by friendly staff). Discussion We identified multiple barriers to achieving universal ART uptake. To enhance uptake in HIV care services, and achieve the full benefits of ART requires interventions that tackle persistent HIV stigma, and offer people with HIV respectful, convenient and efficient services. These interventions require evaluation in appropriately designed studies."
https://openalex.org/W3088258180,"There is an extensive literature establishing, validating, and quantifying a wide range of responses of fishes to fasting. Our study complements this work by comparing fed and unfed treatments of hatchery-raised Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus)—an imperiled fish that is endemic to the San Francisco Estuary and its tributaries in California, USA—across a diverse suite of endpoints over a two-month time series. The experiment was conducted at 15.9°C, and individuals were sampled at 12 time points as starvation became increasingly severe. We found that hepatosomatic index and condition factor were relatively sensitive to starvation, becoming significantly depressed at Day 4 and 7, respectively. Histological analysis of liver showed elevated cytoplasmic inclusion bodies at Day 7, followed by increased glycogen depletion, single cell necrosis, and hydropic vacuolar degeneration at Day 14, 21, and 28, respectively. Of four antioxidants measured, glutathione decreased at Day 4, superoxide dismutase increased at Day 14, catalase increased at Day 56, and glutathione peroxidase was not affected by starvation. The net result was a ~2-fold increase in lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde) in fasted fish that was highly inconsistent through time. RNA to DNA ratio and triglycerides in muscle were relatively insensitive to starvation, only consistently decreasing with fasting after mortality began increasing in the ‘No Feeding’ treatment, at Day 21. Together, these results suggest that Delta Smelt mobilize hepatic energy stores far more rapidly than lipids in muscle when subjected to fasting, leading to rapid atrophy of liver and the development of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies—possibly autophagosomes—in hepatocytes."
https://openalex.org/W3088395198,"Obesity is a common disease over the world and is tightly associated with diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and cancer disease. Although our previous study showed that the synthetic vanadium-protein (V-P) complex had a better effect on antioxidant and antidiabetic, the relative molecular mechanisms are still entirely unknown. Hence, we investigated the effect of the synthetic V-P complex on adipocyte differentiation (adipogenesis) using human preadipocytes to clarify its molecular mechanisms of action. The primary human preadipocytes were cultured with and without V-P complex during adipocyte differentiation. The cell proliferation, lipid accumulation, and the protein expression of transcription factors and related enzymes were determined for the differentiated human preadipocytes. In this study, the 20 μg/mL of V-P complex reduced the lipid and triglyceride (TG) content by 74.47 and 57.39% (p < 0.05), respectively, and down-regulated the protein expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPα), sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) and fatty acid synthase (FAS). Additionally, the V-P complex significantly up-regulated the protein levels of total β-catenin (t-β-catenin), nuclear β-catenin (n-β-catenin), phosphorylated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase alpha (p-AMPKα) and liver kinase B1 (p-LKB1). These showed that the inhibitory effect of V-P complex on human adipogenesis was mediated by activating Wnt/β-catenin and LKB1/AMPK-dependent signaling pathway. Therefore, the synthetic V-P complex could be considered as a candidate for prevention and treatment of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W3088661870,"Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a rare, but nearly uniformly fatal disease that is typically resistant to chemotherapy and radiation. Alternative strategies to target this cancer at a molecular level are necessary in order to improve dismal outcomes for ATC patients. We examined the effects of flavopiridol, a CDK inhibitor, in a panel of ATC cell lines. When cell lines were treated over a ten-point concentration range, CAL62, KMH2 and BHT-101 cell lines had a sub micromolar half-maximal inhibitory concentration, while no effect was seen in the non-cancerous cell line IMR-90. Flavopiridol treatment resulted in decreased levels of the cell cycle proteins CDK9 and MCL1, and induced cell cycle arrest. Flavopiridol also decreased the in vitro ability of ATC cells to form colonies and impeded migration using a transwell migration assay. In vivo, flavopiridol decreased tumor weight and tumor volume over time in a patient-derived xenograft model of ATC. Given the observed in vitro and in vivo activity, flavopiridol warrants further investigation for treatment of ATC."
https://openalex.org/W3089265570,"Most Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) cases are caused by deletions or duplications of one or more exons that disrupt the reading frame of DMD mRNA. Restoring the reading frame allows the production of partially functional dystrophin proteins, and result in less severe symptoms. Antisense oligonucleotide mediated exon skipping has been approved for DMD, but this strategy needs repeated treatment. CRISPR/Cas9 can also restore dystrophin reading frame. Although recent in vivo studies showed the efficacy of the single-cut reframing/exon skipping strategy, methods to find the most efficient single-cut sgRNAs for a specific mutation are lacking. Here we show that the insertion/deletion (INDEL) generating efficiency and the INDEL profiles both contribute to the reading frame restoring efficiency of a single-cut sgRNA, thus assays only examining INDEL frequency are not able to find the best sgRNAs. We therefore developed a GFP-reporter assay to evaluate single-cut reframing efficiency, reporting the combined effects of both aspects. We show that the GFP-reporter assay can reliably predict the performance of sgRNAs in myoblasts. This GFP-reporter assay makes it possible to efficiently and reliably find the most efficient single-cut sgRNA for restoring dystrophin expression."
https://openalex.org/W3088198220,"The purpose of the present study was to evaluate yellow mombin (Spondias mombin L.) juice as a vehicle for the Lactobacillus acidophilus NRRL B-4495 probiotic. The initial pH and fermentation temperature conditions were optimized by central composite rotational design. The beverage was evaluated for its chemical composition, bioactive properties, microbiological stability, survival in simulated gastrointestinal conditions and sensory analysis. The ideal conditions for probiotic juice production were an initial pH of 6.4 and 16 h of fermentation, with maximum viability of 12.9 ± 0.4 Log CFU/mL. The fermented juice showed a total phenolic concentration of 94.90 ± 7.12 GAE/mL and antioxidant activity, as measured by DPPH (0.31 ± 0.00 μmol TE/mL) and ABTS sequestration (2.59 ± 0.30 μmol TE/mL). Antibacterial activity could also be observed against S. aureus, E. coli and K. pneumoniae. The obtained formulation showed good microbiological stability when stored at 4ºC for 28 days. In addition, there was no significant change in viability after exposure to simulated gastrointestinal conditions. The sensory analysis showed that the probiotic beverage was not well accepted. However, the Just-About-Right (JAR) ideal scale test enabled identifying the specific attributes which need to be improved from the tasters’ point of view so that it is possible to improve product acceptance."
https://openalex.org/W3088735120,"Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) for the first six months of life is effective in preventing infant morbidity and mortality. However, 36% of Ugandan children below 6 months are not breastfed exclusively despite its active promotion. This study determined the prevalence and factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding among mothers working in the informal sector in Kampala district. A community based cross-sectional study targeting 428 interviews with mothers with children aged 0–5 months was conducted. Analysis was done using modified Poisson regression in Stata version 14. The prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding was 42.8%. The factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding included: attending antenatal care at least 4 times (APR = 1.24; 95% CI: 1.01–1.51), intention to exclusively breastfeed for 6 months (APR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.01–1.57) or longer (APR = 1.38; 95% CI: 1.06–1.76), proper breastfeeding practices (APR = 4.12; 95% CI: 2.88–5.90), age of the infant (APR = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.65–0.94) and (APR = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.39–0.60) for children aged 2–3 and 4–5 months respectively and working in a lower position (APR = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.55–0.83). Mothers should be encouraged to attend antenatal care where they learn about the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding to children below 6 months hence enabling them to make informed decisions about exclusive breastfeeding. The government of Uganda should ensure maternity leave benefits of the employment act are enforced in the informal sector to allow women to practice EBF."
https://openalex.org/W3088209530,"Net primary production (NPP) can regulate global climate change and carbon balance. Although scholars have qualitatively studied the influencing factors of NPP, few have quantified the contribution of different degrees of drought aggravation or mitigation and major land-use changes to NPP changes. Based on the temporal and spatial characteristics of NPP for 2000–2015 in the Chinese Loess Plateau, we quantified the contribution of drought, land use and land cover change (LUCC), and hydrothermal conditions to changes in NPP. Particularly, we analyzed the contribution of major land-use change and different drought levels to NPP. Our results showed that the 15-years average NPP was approximately 227 gC/m2 and decreased from southeast to northwest. Overall, NPP showed a linear increasing trend over the 15-years period. The results suggested that changes in hydrothermal conditions had the strongest impact on NPP (~61%), followed by drought (~33%), and land use and land cover change had the weakest impact (~1.4%). In particular, ~13% of the NPP decreases was affected by light drought aggravation, ~10% of the NPP decreases was affected by moderate drought aggravation, and ~0.3% was affected by the conversion of cropland to grassland or non-NPP main production land. Moreover, ~12.7% of the NPP increase was affected by light drought alleviation, ~9.4% was affected by moderate drought alleviation, and ~1.1% was affected by the conversion of grassland to cropland or forestland. The mechanisms underlying the effect of drought and land-use change on NPP were clarified and provide an important reference value for future research on the carbon cycle and regional ecological environmental restoration."
https://openalex.org/W3088765495,"Genes in the noncanonical WNT signaling pathway controlling planar cell polarity have been linked to the neural tube defect myelomeningocele. We hypothesized that some genes in the WNT signaling network have a higher mutational burden in myelomeningocele subjects than in reference subjects in gnomAD. Exome sequencing data from 511 myelomeningocele subjects was obtained in-house and data from 29,940 ethnically matched subjects was provided by version 2 of the publicly available Genome Aggregation Database. To compare mutational burden, we collapsed rare deleterious variants across each of 523 human WNT signaling genes in case and reference populations. Ten WNT signaling genes were disrupted with a higher mutational burden among Mexican American myelomeningocele subjects compared to reference subjects (Fishers exact test, P ≤ 0.05) and seven different genes were disrupted among individuals of European ancestry compared to reference subjects. Gene ontology enrichment analyses indicate that genes disrupted only in the Mexican American population play a role in planar cell polarity whereas genes identified in both populations are important for the regulation of canonical WNT signaling. In summary, evidence for WNT signaling genes that may contribute to myelomeningocele in humans is presented and discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3088833324,"The aim of this prospective study was to use direct matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) to rapidly diagnose periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs).Synovial fluid was taken from 77 patients (80 joints, 41 hips and 39 knees) who met the International Consensus Meeting criteria for PJI, and inoculated into blood culture bottles (BCBs) and onto conventional swabs. Positive blood cultures were analyzed using either direct or routine MALDI-TOF MS. Pathogen identification and the time to identification was recorded. Differences between groups were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test and Bonferroni's post-hoc test.Direct and routine MALDI-TOF MS both detected 64 positive results (80%), compared to 47 (59%) by conventional swabs (p = 0.002). Direct MALDI-TOF MS identified 85.3% of the gram-positive organisms and 92.3% of the gram-negative organisms. No fungi were identified by direct MALDI-TOF MS. In 17 BCBs that were flagged positive, identification by direct MALDI-TOF MS failed. Among the positive results in the direct MALDI-TOF MS group, Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 47%, followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (17%), Escherichia coli (9%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9%). The median time to microorganism identification was significantly shorter with direct MALDI-TOF MS (12.7 h, IQR: 8.9-19.6 h) than with routine MALDI-TOF MS (39.5 h, IQR: 22.8-46.0 h) or swabs (44.4 h, IQR: 27.2-72.6 h) (p < 0.0001). In pairwise comparisons, there were significant differences in the time of microorganism identification between direct MALDI-TOF MS and routine MALDI-TOF MS (p < 0.0001) or swab culture (p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference between routine MALDI-TOF MS and swab culture (p = 0.0268).Compared with current laboratory practice, direct MALDI-TOF MS shortened the time to microorganism identification and had superior results compared to conventional swabs, except for fungi. Further studies should investigate whether the earlier administration of appropriate antimicrobial agents can improve the treatment outcomes of PJIs."
https://openalex.org/W3088984531,"Wuhan, China was the epicenter of the 2019 coronavirus outbreak. As a designated hospital for COVID-19, Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital has received over 700 COVID-19 patients. With the COVID-19 becoming a pandemic all over the world, we aim to share our epidemiological and clinical findings with the global community. We studied 340 confirmed COVID-19 patients with clear clinical outcomes from Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, including 310 discharged cases and 30 death cases. We analyzed their demographic, epidemiological, clinical and laboratory data and implemented our findings into an interactive, free access web application to evaluate COVID-19 patient’s severity level. Our results show that baseline T cell subsets results differed significantly between the discharged cases and the death cases in Mann Whitney U test: Total T cells (p < 0.001), Helper T cells (p <0.001), Suppressor T cells (p <0.001), and TH/TSC (Helper/Suppressor ratio, p<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression model with death or discharge as the outcome resulted in the following significant predictors: age (OR 1.05, 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.10), underlying disease status (OR 3.42, 95% CI, 1.30 to 9.95), Helper T cells on the log scale (OR 0.22, 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.40), and TH/TSC on the log scale (OR 4.80, 95% CI, 2.12 to 11.86). The AUC for the logistic regression model is 0.90 (95% CI, 0.84 to 0.95), suggesting the model has a very good predictive power. Our findings suggest that while age and underlying diseases are known risk factors for poor prognosis, patients with a less damaged immune system at the time of hospitalization had higher chance of recovery. Close monitoring of the T cell subsets might provide valuable information of the patient’s condition change during the treatment process. Our web visualization application can be used as a supplementary tool for the evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W3088826250,"Black people are still considered to be one of the most stigmatized groups and have to face multiple prejudices that undermine their well-being. Assumptions and beliefs about other racial groups are quite pervasive and have been shown to impact basic social tasks such as face processing. For example, individuals with high racial prejudice conceptualize other-race faces as less trustworthy and more criminal. However, it is unknown if implicit racial bias could modulate even low-level perceptual mechanisms such as spatial frequency (SF) extraction when judging the level of trustworthiness of other-race faces. The present study showed that although similar facial features are used to judge the trustworthiness of White and Black faces, own-race faces are processed in lower SF (i.e. coarse information such as the contour of the face and blurred shapes as opposed to high SF representing fine-grained information such as eyelashes or fine wrinkles). This pattern was modulated by implicit race biases: higher implicit biases are associated with a significantly higher reliance on low SF with White than with Black faces."
https://openalex.org/W3087835444,"To study the shrinkage rule of borehole diameter and its effect on gas extraction, a visco-elastoplastic model for boreholes considering strain softening and the dilatancy characteristic was established to obtain the expressions of the coal stress, variation in diameter, and pressure relief range. The stress distribution and pressure relief effect of the boreholes in soft and hard coal seams were comparatively analyzed. The shrinkage rule of the borehole diameter was studied. The reasons for the rapid reduction in the extraction concentration of the borehole in soft coal seams were described. A technology of improving the gas extraction effect in soft coal seams was developed. The research results showed that the radius of the plastic softening zone is 0.405 m for a borehole in a soft coal seam and 0.224 m for that in a hard coal seam. This indicates that the borehole in a soft coal seam has a better pressure relief effect. The boreholes in both hard and soft coal seams will incur a shrinkage phenomenon; however, the soft coal seam has low strength and a weak ability to resist damage, and thus the surrounding coal will have a more intense creep deformation, leading to an instability failure during a short period of time and thus, a blocking of the extraction channel, thereby causing a rapid reduction in the gas extraction concentration. The borehole in a hard coal seam also shows a shrinkage phenomenon, but remains in a stable state without a blockage; thus, high-concentration gas can be extracted from this borehole for a long period of time. The geo-stress and coal strength are the two main factors controlling the amplitude of borehole shrinkage. From an increase in stress, the borehole in a hard coal seam shows a more intense creep deformation in a deep mine, which may lead to blockage. The key to improving the gas extraction effect in soft coal seams is to maintain a smooth extraction channel. The full screen pipe is installed through the drill pipe to retain an extraction channel, leading to an average gas extraction increase from 0.043 m3/min to 0.12 m3/min, an increase of 2.77 times. These research results are consistent with actual production, and can provide theoretical guidance for determining the gas extraction parameters."
https://openalex.org/W3088661528,"There are multiple surgical approaches to the repair of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). Here, we evaluated the outcomes of small-gauge pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), alone or in combination with scleral buckle (SB-PPV), for RRD repair using a standardized technique by 3 vitreoretinal surgeons: “extensive” removal of the vitreous with scleral depression and dynamic examination of the peripheral retina. One hundred eighty seven eyes of 180 consecutive patients treated for primary RRD by three vitreoretinal surgeons at a tertiary academic medical center from September 2015 to March 2018 were analyzed. Most RRDs occurred in males (134 [71.3%] eyes), affected the left eye (102 [54.3%]), and were phakic (119 [63.3%]). PPV alone was performed in 159 eyes (84.6%), with a combined SB-PPV used in the remaining 29 eyes (15.4%); focal endolaser was used in all (100%) cases. The single surgery anatomic success rate was 186 eyes (99.5%) at 3 months, and 187 (100%) at last follow up. Overall best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) had significantly improved at 3 months ([Snellen 20/47] P<0.00005) and last follow up ([Snellen 20/31] P<0.00005), as compared to day of presentation ([Snellen 20/234]). Our findings suggest that “extensive” removal of the vitreous and dynamic peripheral examination with scleral depression may lead to high single surgery success in primary uncomplicated RRD repair."
https://openalex.org/W3088713984,"Activin/myostatin signaling has a critical role not only in cachexia but also in tumor angiogenesis. Cachexia is a frequent complication among patients with advanced cancer and heavily pretreated patients. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of cachexia-associated genetic variants in refractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients treated with regorafenib. Associations between twelve single nucleotide polymorphisms in 8 genes (INHBA, MSTN, ALK4, TGFBR1, ALK7, ACVR2B, SMAD2, FOXO3) and clinical outcome were evaluated in mCRC patients of three cohorts: a discovery cohort of 150 patients receiving regorafenib, a validation cohort of 80 patients receiving regorafenib and a control cohort of 128 receiving TAS-102. In the discovery cohort, patients with any G variant in FOXO3 rs12212067 had a significantly lower response rate (P = 0.031) and overall survival (OS) than those with a T/T in univariate analysis (4.5 vs. 7.6 months, hazard ratio [HR] = 1.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09-2.46, P = 0.012). Among female patients, those with any G variant in INHBA rs2237432 had a significantly longer OS than those with an A/A in both univariate (7.6 vs. 4.3 months, HR = 0.57, 95%CI = 0.34-0.95, P = 0.021) and multivariable (HR = 0.53, 95%CI = 0.29-0.94, adjusted P = 0.031) analysis. This association was confirmed in female patients of the validation cohort, though without statistical significance (P = 0.059). Conversely, female patients with any G allele in the control group receiving TAS-102 did not show a longer OS. This was the first study evaluating the associations between polymorphisms in cachexia-associated genes and outcomes in refractory mCRC patients treated with regorafenib. Further studies should be conducted to confirm these associations."

Nevertheless, Myanmar has yet to achieve the WHO's target of 70% for early initiation of breastfeeding, and the country's target of 90% for exclusive breastfeeding. The purpose of this study was to assess the associations between early initiation of breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding and bio-demographic, socio-economic and behavioral factors in Myanmar. Using the 2015-2016 Myanmar Demographic and Health Survey, the analysis of early initiation of breastfeeding was based on a sample of 1,506 under-2 children and the analysis of exclusive breastfeeding was based on a sample of 376 children aged 0-5 months. Multiple logistic modeling, with heteroskedasticity-adjusted standard errors, was used. The prevalence rates of early initiation of breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding in the study were 67.9% and 52.2% respectively. Having a vaginal delivery (AOR = 2.5; 95% CI = 1.7-3.7) and having frequent (≥ 4) antenatal visits (AOR = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.5-3.8) were associated with higher odds of early initiation of breastfeeding. Having a postnatal checkup (AOR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.3-0.9) and having an infant that was perceived to be small at birth (AOR = 2.5; 95% CI = 1.1-5.7, for infants perceived to be large at birth) were significantly associated with decreased odds of exclusive breastfeeding. In order to promote optimal breastfeeding practices, this study suggested that delivery and quality of health services during pregnancy need to be strengthened in Myanmar."
https://openalex.org/W3089236612,"Background Stunting is a worldwide public health problem caused by factors that vary across regions, including in Ethiopia. Limited evidence to prevent stunting makes it difficult to design and prioritize appropriate interventions. Therefore, this study investigated the intervention priorities for the prevention of stunting among children 6–59 months old in Kemissie City Administration, northeastern Ethiopia. Methods A community-based individual matched case-control study was conducted from January to April 2017 including 107 cases and 214 controls. Controls were selected and matched with cases using the matching variable of child’s age. Data were collected by open data kit (ODK) software using a structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed using STATA version 13.0 and WHO (World Health Organization) Anthro 2005. A conditional logistic regression model was used for data analysis. From multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis, determinants of stunting were identified. A statistically significant level was declared by a conditional adjusted odds ratio (cAOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and p-value of less than 0.05. Main findings The wealth index 52 (48.6%) of the cases and 108 (50.5%) controls were categorized as poor. The mean height-for-age z-score (HAZ) for the cases and controls was -2.79±.67 and -0.55±.92, respectively. One-sixth (16.8%) of the cases and 29 (13.6%) of the controls were given prelacteal feeding. A majority 82 (86.9%) of the cases and 137 (69.1%) of the controls had undernourished mothers/care-givers. Slightly less than one-third 35 (32.7%) of cases and one-fourth 53 (24.8%) of controls were affected by repeated episodes of diarrhea. Mother’s body mass index (BMI) (conditional adjusted odds ratio [cAOR]) = 2.64; 95% CI: 1.28, 5.43), giving food priority to father (cAOR = 2.42; 95% CI: 1.23, 4.75), lack of exclusive breastfeeding for at least 6 months (cAOR = 2.44; 95% CI: 1.15, 5.17), no intake of meat by child (cAOR = 2.35; 95% CI: 1.21, 4.58) and child having repeated diarrheal episodes (cAOR = 2.0: 95% CI: 1.07, 3.86) were factors associated with childhood stunting. Conclusion Maternal nutritional status, food priority, duration of exclusive breastfeeding, no intake of meat and repeated episodes of diarrhea were the main determinants of stunting among children aged 6–59 months. Therefore, intervention measures to avert childhood stunting should include strengthening action on provision of essential nutrition, providing counseling to parents on giving food priority to children, promotion of optimal duration of breastfeeding and preventing diarrheal disease among children 6–59 months old."
https://openalex.org/W3087929347,"A study evaluating apparent digestibilities of protein and amino acids and their corresponding digestion rates in four small intestinal sites in broiler chickens was completed to further investigate dietary optimisation via synchronised nutrient digestion and absorption. A total of 288 male Ross 308 broiler chickens were offered semi-purified diets with eight protein-rich feedstuffs, including; blood meal (BM), plasma protein meal (PPM), cold pressed (CCM) and expeller-pressed (ECM) canola meal, high (SBM HCP) and low (SBM LCP) crude protein soybean meals, lupins and peas. Diets were iso-caloric, iso-nitrogenous and the test ingredient was the sole source of dietary nitrogen. Each diet was offered to 6 bioassay cages with 6 birds per cage from day 21 to 28 post hatch. On day 28, all birds were euthanized and digesta samples were collected from the proximal jejunum, distal jejunum, proximal ileum and distal ileum to determine apparent protein and amino acids digestibility coefficients, digestion rates and potential digestible protein and amino acids. Dietary protein source significantly influenced energy utilisation, nitrogen retention, apparent protein (N) digestibilities, digestion rates and potential digestible protein along the small intestine. Diets containing BM and SBM LCP exhibited the highest protein digestion rate and potential digestible protein, respectively. Digestibility coefficients and disappearance rates of the majority of amino acids in four sections of the small intestine were influenced by dietary protein source (P < 0.01) and blood meal had the fastest protein digestion rate. In general, jejunal amino acid and protein digestibilities were more variable in comparison to ileal digestibilities, and the differences in protein and amino acid disappearance rates were more pronounced between types of feedstuffs than sources of similar feedstuffs."
https://openalex.org/W3087970344,"Rapid changes in climate and land use threaten the persistence of wildlife species. Understanding where species are likely to occur now and in the future can help identify areas that are resistant to change over time and guide conservation planning. We estimated changes in species distribution patterns and spatial resistance in five future scenarios for the New England region of the northeastern United States. We present scenario-specific distribution change maps for nine harvested wildlife species, identifying regions of increasing, decreasing, or stable habitat suitability within each scenario. Next, we isolated areas where species occurrence probability is high (p > 0.7) and resistant to change across all future scenarios. Resistance was also evaluated relative to current land protection to identify patterns in and out of Protected Areas (PAs). Generally, species distributions declined in area over the 50-year assessment period (2010-2060), with the greatest average declines occurring for moose (-40.9%) and wild turkey (-22.1%). Species resistance varied considerably across the region, with coyote demonstrating the highest average regional resistance (91.81% of the region) and moose demonstrating the lowest (0.76% of the region). At the state level, average focal species resistance was highest in Maine (the largest state) and lowest in Massachusetts. Many of the focal species showed high overlap in resistance and land protection. Coyote, white-tailed deer, and black bear had the highest probability of resistance, given protection, while moose and wild turkey had the highest probability of protection, given resistance. Overall, relatively small portions of New England-ranging between 0.25% and 21.12%-were both protected and resistant for the focal species. Our results provide estimates of resistance that can inform conservation planning for commonly harvested species that are important ecologically, economically, and culturally to the region. Expanding protected area coverage to include resistant areas may provide longer term benefits to these species."

Men are reported to be less likely to undergo cardiovascular disease (CVD) health check than women. Gender difference could be one of the factors influencing health seeking behaviour of men and women. We aimed to identify gender differences in factors influencing the intention to undergo CVD health checks. Methods This was a cross-sectional survey using mall intercept interviews. Malaysians aged ≥30 years without known CVD were recruited. They were asked for their intention to undergo CVD health checks and associated factors. The factors included seven internal factors that were related to individuals’ attitude, perception and preparedness for CVD health checks and two external factors that were related to external resources. Hierarchical ordinal regression analysis was used to evaluate the importance of the factors on intention to undergo CVD health checks, for men and women separately. Results 397 participants were recruited, 60% were women. For men, internal factors explained 31.6% of the variances in likeliness and 9.6% of the timeline to undergo CVD health checks, with 1.2% and 1.8% added respectively when external factors were sequentially included. For women, internal factors explained 18.9% and 22.1% of the variances, with 3.1% and 4.2% added with inclusion of the external factors. In men, perceived drawbacks of health checks was a significant negative factor associated with likeliness to undergo CVD health checks (coefficient = -1.093; 95%CI:-1.592 to -0.594), and timeline for checks (coefficient = -0.533; 95%CI:-0.975 to -0.091). In women, readiness to handle outcomes following health checks was significantly associated with likeliness to undergo the checks (coefficient = 0.575; 95%CI: 0.063 to 1.087), and timeline for checks (coefficient = 0.645; 95%CI: 0.162 to 1.128). Both external factors 1) influence by significant others (coefficient = 0.406; 95%CI: 0.013 to 0.800) and 2) external barriers (coefficient = -0.440; 95%CI:-0.869 to -0.011) were also significantly associated with likeliness to undergo CVD health checks in women. Conclusions Both men and women were influenced by internal factors in their intention to undergo CVD health checks, and women were also influenced by external factors. Interventions to encourage CVD health checks need to focus on internal factors and be gender sensitive."

The aim of this study was to develop a model to simulate the effect of undocumented infections, seasonal infectivity, immunity, and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the transmission, morbidity, and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 in New York State (NYS) based on data collected between March 4 and April 28, 2020. Simulations predict that undocumented infections significantly contribute to infectivity, NPIs are effective in reducing morbidity and mortality, and relaxation >50% of NPIs from initial lock-down levels may result in tens-of-thousands more deaths. Endemic infection is likely to occur in the absence of sustained immunity. As a result, until an effective vaccine or other effective pharmaceutical intervention is developed, the risks of significantly reducing NPIs should be carefully considered.

African American (AA) men living below poverty in Baltimore City have a higher incidence of mortality when compared to either white males or AA females living below poverty. Previous studies in our laboratory and elsewhere suggest that environmental conditions are associated with differential gene expression (DGE) patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). DGE have also been associated with hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and correlate with race and sex. However, no studies have investigated how poverty status associates with DGE between male and female AAs and whites living in Baltimore City. We examined DGE in 52 AA and white participants of the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) cohort, who were living above or below 125% of the 2004 federal poverty line at time of sample collection. We performed a microarray to assess DGE patterns in PBMCs from these participants. AA males and females living in poverty had the most genes differentially-expressed compared with above poverty controls. Gene ontology (GO) analysis identified unique and overlapping pathways related to the endosome, single-stranded RNA binding, long-chain fatty-acyl-CoA biosynthesis, toll-like receptor signaling, and others within AA males and females living in poverty and compared with their above poverty controls. We performed RT-qPCR to validate top differentially-expressed genes in AA males. We found that KLF6, DUSP2, RBM34, and CD19 are expressed at significantly lower levels in AA males in poverty and KCTD12 is higher compared to above poverty controls. This study serves as an additional link to better understand the gene expression response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in those living in poverty."
https://openalex.org/W3088743991,"Clustering is an important technology of data mining, which plays a vital role in bioscience, social network and network analysis. As a clustering algorithm based on density and distance, density peak clustering is extensively used to solve practical problems. The algorithm assumes that the clustering center has a larger local density and is farther away from the higher density points. However, the density peak clustering algorithm is highly sensitive to density and distance and cannot accurately identify clusters in a dataset having significant differences in cluster structure. In addition, the density peak clustering algorithm’s allocation strategy can easily cause attached allocation errors in data point allocation. To solve these problems, this study proposes a potential-field-diffusion-based density peak clustering. As compared to existing clustering algorithms, the advantages of the potential-field-diffusion-based density peak clustering algorithm is three-fold: 1) The potential field concept is introduced in the proposed algorithm, and a density measure based on the potential field’s diffusion is proposed. The cluster center can be accurately selected using this measure. 2) The potential-field-diffusion-based density peak clustering algorithm defines the judgment conditions of similar points and adopts different allocation strategies for dissimilar points to avoid attached errors in data point allocation. 3) This study conducted many experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. Results demonstrate that the proposed potential-field-diffusion-based density peak clustering algorithm achieves excellent clustering effect and is suitable for complex datasets of different sizes, dimensions, and shapes. Besides, the proposed potential-field-diffusion-based density peak clustering algorithm shows particularly excellent performance on variable density and nonconvex datasets."
https://openalex.org/W3089006697,"Regional differences in tree growth can be used to approximate the geographical provenance of ring-width series ('dendro-provenancing'). This method relies on cross-dated ring-width series (reference chronologies) that are thought to represent the radial growth signal of trees in a given region. Reference chronologies are often established from ring-width series of living tree populations. Frequently, they are too short to allow for investigating the provenance of historical wood. Thus, references are extended by ring-width series from buildings and art-historical objects that exhibit best matching growth patterns with the living tree references. Yet, series from other provenances may erroneously be included. Thereby the local or regional growth signal of the references is progressively contaminated, but this has received little attention to date. I investigate this contamination risk using a simulation approach that allows for generating pseudo site chronologies that preserve the relevant statistical properties of the real site chronologies. While the exact provenance of historical wood is unknown, for simulated ring-width series the provenance is unambiguous. Hence, pseudo reference chronologies may be established while monitoring the signal mixture. Specifically, 15 site chronologies of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) from northeastern Switzerland were used to generate 15 pseudo site growth signals that span 1000 years. The simulation demonstrates that quasi uncontaminated references can be established in ideal circumstances for the study area. However, the thresholds for the similarity in between-series correlation must be very high. Even then, contaminated pseudo references occurred in rare cases during the simulation. Yet, elevation-specific pseudo references were established with lower thresholds. Simulation currently offers the only approach for assessing the contamination risk of reference chronologies, and it allows for elucidating the conditions under which acceptable levels of contamination can be guaranteed. Therefore, the present approach paves the way towards a practical simulation tool for dendro-provenancing."
https://openalex.org/W3087829180,"Anemia is a condition characterized by a decline in the number of functional red blood cells or hemoglobin. Women of reproductive age from low- and middle-income countries are at higher risk of anemia, which could lead to prenatal, obstetric and perinatal complications. The aim of our study was to explore associations between anemia status and a set of demographic, socio-economic and reproductive factors, among Ecuadorian women of reproductive age (WRA).We used data from non-pregnant, WRA (≥12 and ≤49 years) women enrolled in the nationally representative cross-sectional Ecuadorian National Health and Nutrition Survey 2012 (ENSANUT-ECU 2012). Anemia and moderate-severe anemia were assessed using hemoglobin concentrations cutoffs of <12 g/dL and <11 g/dL, respectively. Logistic regression was used to obtain unadjusted and adjusted prevalence odds ratios (aOR). All analyzes were adjusted for multi-stage sampling, stratification and clustering.The study population included a subset of 7415 non-pregnant WRA. Mean hemoglobin concentration was 12.84 g/dL (95% CI = 12.8-12.9). The overall prevalence of anemia and moderate-severe anemia was 16.8% and 5.0%, respectively. Some factors were associated with an increase in anemia prevalence odds: living in Guayaquil (aOR 1.82, 95% CI 1.16-2.84) and Quito (aOR 1.84, 95% CI 1.17-2.90) compared to living in the rural Amazon, having given birth to more than four alive children compared with being nulliparous (aOR 1.85, 95% CI 1.00-3.43), currently taking contraceptives compared with former use (aOR 1.46, 95% CI 1.09-1.97). In addition, moderate-severe anemia was associated with age and region of residence.In 2012, the prevalence of anemia among Ecuadorian WRA was considered a mild public health concern. However, we identified groups with higher anemia prevalence. Thus, emphasizing the importance of analyzing the prevalence in sub-populations of WRA and identifying populations where more frequent surveillance may be helpful."
https://openalex.org/W3087987445,"Background Early risk stratification for guiding treatment priority in the emergency department (ED) is becoming increasingly important. Existing prediction models typically use demographics, vital signs and laboratory parameters. Laboratory-based models require blood testing, which may cause substantial delay. However, these delays can be prevented by the use of point-of-care testing (POCT), where results are readily available. We aimed to externally validate a laboratory-based model for mortality and subsequently assessed whether a POCT model yields comparable performance. Methods All adult patients visiting the ED of a university hospital between January 1st, 2012 and December 31st, 2016 were retrospectively reviewed for inclusion. Primary outcome was defined as 30-day mortality after ED presentation. We externally validated one existing prediction model including age, glucose, urea, sodium, haemoglobin, platelet count and white blood cell count. We assessed the predictive performance by discrimination, expressed as Area under the Curve (AUC). We compared the existing model to an equivalent model using predictors that are available with POCT (i.e. glucose, urea, sodium and haemoglobin). Additionally, we internally validated these models with bootstrapping. Results We included 34,437 patients of whom 1,942 (5.6%) died within 30 days. The AUC of the laboratory-based model was 0.794. We refitted this model to our ED population and found an AUC of 0.812, which decreased only slightly to 0.790 with only POCT parameters. Conclusions Our POCT-model performs similar to existing laboratory-based models in identifying patients at high risk for mortality, with results available within minutes. Although the model needs further validation and evaluation, it shows the potential of POCT for early risk stratification in the ED."
https://openalex.org/W3088292047,"The effects of footwear on the walking kinematics, kinetics and electromyography (EMG) of individuals with chronic ankle instability (CAI) at different speeds are still unknown. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the kinematic, kinetic and electromyography differences between shod and barefoot walking at comfortable (CW) and fast (FW) speeds in individuals with CAI.Twenty-one individuals with CAI walked on a 5-meter walkway shod and barefoot at CW and FW speeds. A force plate was used to record the ground reaction forces, a 3-D motion analysis system to record the lower limb kinematics and a surface EMG system to collect the gluteus medius, vastus lateralis, gastrocnemius lateralis, gastrocnemius medialis, peroneus longus and tibialis anterior muscles activity. The dependent variables were ankle and knee angles and moments and normalized muscle activity. The shod and barefoot data during CW and FW were compared using a one-dimensional non-parametric mapping analysis.The main results of this study were that individuals with CAI exhibited more ankle dorsiflexion angle, knee extension and tibialis anterior muscle activation during the beginning of the stance phase during shod compared to barefoot walking. Also, the biomechanical effects of shoes are similar during walking at FW and CW.The biomechanical deficits associated with CAI were partly attenuated during the shod compared to the barefoot condition and these effects were similar at CW and FW. These findings are compatible with the concept that locomotor interventions using suitable shoes may enhance gait abilities in individuals with CAI."
https://openalex.org/W3088396153,"Antenatal progesterone prevents preterm birth (PTB) in women with a short cervix or prior PTB in daily vaginal or weekly injectable formulations, respectively. Neither has been tested for the indication of maternal HIV, which is associated with an elevated risk of PTB. The Vaginal Progesterone (VP) Trial was a pilot feasibility study of VP to prevent HIV-related PTB in Lusaka, Zambia. Using mixed methods, we concurrently evaluated the acceptability of the trial and the study product among participants. Over a 1-year period, we enrolled 140 pregnant women living with HIV into a double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of daily self-administered VP or placebo. We administered an endline questionnaire to all participants and conducted in-depth interviews with 30 participants to assess barriers and facilitators to uptake and retention in the trial and to study product adherence. All interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, translated into English as needed, and independently coded by two analysts to capture emerging themes. Of 131 participants who completed the questionnaire, 128 (98%) reported that nothing was difficult when asked the hardest part about using the study product. When given a hypothetical choice between vaginal and injectable progesterone, 97 (74%) chose vaginal, 31 (24%) injectable, and 3 (2%) stated no preference. Most interviewees reported no difficulties with using the study product; others cited minor side effects and surmountable challenges. Strategies that supported adherence included setting alarms, aligning dosing with antiretrovirals, receiving encouragement from friends and family, sensing a benefit to their unborn baby, and positive feedback from study staff. Participants who reported preference of a vaginal medication over injectable described familiarity with the vaginal product, a fear of needles and resulting pain, and inconvenience of a weekly clinic visit. Those who would prefer weekly injections cited fewer doses to remember. Perceived barriers to study participation included mistrust about the motivations behind research, suspicion of Satanism, and futility or possible harm from a placebo. We report key influences on acceptability of a randomized trial of VP to prevent PTB among HIV-infected women in Zambia, which should inform methods to promote uptake, adherence, and retention in a full-scale trial."
https://openalex.org/W3088449060,"Targeted gene delivery is important in biomedical research and applications. In this paper, we synergistically combine non-viral chemical materials, magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), and a physical technique, low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS), to achieve efficient and targeted gene delivery. The MNPs are iron oxide super-paramagnetic nanoparticles, coated with polyethyleneimine (PEI), which makes a high positive surface charge and is favorable for the binding of genetic materials. Due to the paramagnetic properties of the MNPs, the application of an external magnetic field increases transfection efficiency while LIPUS stimulation enhances cell viability and permeability. We found that stimulation at the intensity of 30 mW/cm2 for 10 minutes yields optimal results with a minimal adverse effect on the cells. By combining the effect of the external magnetic field and LIPUS, the genetic material (GFP or Cherry Red plasmid) can enter the cells. The flow cytometry results showed that by using just a magnetic field to direct the genetic material, the transfection efficiency on HEK 293 cells that were treated by our MNPs was 56.1%. Coupled with LIPUS stimulation, it increased to 61.5% or 19% higher than the positive control (Lipofectamine 2000). Besides, compared with the positive control, our method showed less toxicity. Cell viability after transfection was 63.61%, which is 19% higher than the standard transfection technique. In conclusion, we designed a new gene-delivery method that is affordable, targeted, shows low-toxicity, yet high transfection efficiency, compared to other conventional approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3088502066,"Background Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) remain one of the most common causes of morbidity among children in Ethiopia. Assessment of the magnitude of STH and its association with water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and identify barriers for school-level prevention assist public health planners to prioritize promotion strategies and is a basic step for intervention. However, there is a lack of evidence on the prevalence of STH and its association with WASH and barriers for school-level prevention among schoolchildren. Objective To assess the prevalence of STH and its association with WASH and identify barriers for school level prevention in technology village of Hawassa University; 2019. Methods An institution-based analytical cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of 1080 schoolchildren from September 5 to October 15, 2019. A two-stage cluster and purposive sampling technique were used to draw the study participants. A pretested, structured questionnaire, observation checklist, and in-depth interview were used to collect the data. Two grams of stool samples were collected from each study participant and examined using direct wet mount and Kato-Katz technique. Data were entered into Epi Info version 7 and analyzed using SPSS version 25. Both bi-variable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were done. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic content analysis method by Atlas-Ti software and presented in narratives. Results The overall prevalence of STHs was 23.1% (95% CI = 21.4, 27.6). The identified predictors of STHs were large family size (AOR = 2.03; 95% CI = 1.53–3.99), absence of separate toilet room for male and female (AOR = 3.33; 95% CI = 1.91–5.79), toilet not easy to clean (AOR = 2.17; 95% CI = 1.44–3.33), inadequate knowledge about STHs (AOR = 2.08; 95% CI = 1.07–3.44) and children who had travelled greater than 100 meters to access toilet (AOR = 3.45; 95% CI = 2.24–8.92). These results were supported by the individual, institutional, socio-economic and cultural qualitative results. Conclusion The STHs was moderate public health concerns. Reinforcing the existing fragile water, sanitation and hygiene programs and regular deworming of schoolchildren may support to reduce the burden of STHs. Also, increasing modern family planning methods utilization to decrease family size is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3088692224,"Significant intervals from the identification of suspicious symptoms to a definitive diagnosis of cancer are common. Streamlining pathways to diagnosis may increase survival, quality of life post-treatment, and patient experience. Discussions of pathways to diagnosis from the perspective of patients and family members are crucial to advancing cancer diagnosis.To examine the perspectives of a group of patients with cancer and family members in Alberta, Canada, on factors associated with timelines to diagnosis and overall experience.A qualitative approach was used. In-depth, semi-structured interviews with patients with cancer (n = 18) and patient relatives (n = 5) were conducted and subjected to a thematic analysis.Participants struggled emotionally in the diagnostic period. Relevant to their experience were: potentially avoidable delays, concerns about health status, and misunderstood investigation process. Participants emphasized the importance of their active involvement in the care process, and had unmet supportive care needs.Psychosocial supports available to potential cancer patients and their families are minimal, and may be important for improved experiences before diagnosis. Access to other patients' lived experiences with the diagnostic process and with cancer, and an enhanced supportive role of family doctors might help improve experiences for patients and families in the interval before receiving a diagnosis of cancer, which may have a significant impact on wellbeing."
https://openalex.org/W3087999834,"I investigate the association of perceived discrimination based both on race and other attributes such as age, gender, and insurance status on self-reported health access and health outcomes in a diverse and densely populated metropolitan area.Restricted data from the 2016 round of the New York City Community Health Survey was used to create prevalence estimates for both racial and non-racial discrimination. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the association of these discrimination measures with health access and health outcome variables.Among residents who perceived discrimination receiving health care during the previous year, 15% reported the reason behind such discrimination to race, while the rest chose other reasons. Among the non-race based categories, 34% reported the reason behind such discrimination to be insurance status, followed by other reasons (26.83%) and income (11.76%). Non-racial discrimination was significantly associated with the adjusted odds of not receiving care when needed (AOR = 6.96; CI: [5.00 9.70]), and seeking informal care (AOR = 2.24; CI: [1.13 4.48] respectively, after adjusting for insurance status, age, gender, marital status, race/ethnicity, nativity, and poverty. It was also associated with higher adjusted odds of reporting poor health (AOR = 2.49; CI: [1.65 3.75]) and being diagnosed with hypertension (AOR = 1.75; CI: [1.21 2.52]), and diabetes (AOR = 1.84; CI: [1.22 2.77]) respectively.Perceived discrimination in health care exists in multiple forms.

https://openalex.org/W3088276935,"Improvements to smallholder farming are essential to improvements in rural prosperity. Small farmers in the Kaziranga region of Assam operate mixed farming enterprises in a resource limited environment, which is subject to seasonal flooding. Participatory techniques, were used to elucidate the animal health challenges experienced in this landscape in order to inform and guide future animal health education and interventions. The flooding is essential for agricultural activities, but is a source of major losses and disruption. Farmers experience significant losses to their crops due to raiding by wild species such as elephants; predation of livestock by wild carnivores is also of concern. Access to veterinary services and medicines is limited by both financial and geographic constraints. Interviewees discussed nutritional and management issues such as poor availability of fodder and grazing land, while meeting attendees preferred to concentrate discussions on animal health issues. Livestock keepers were adept and consistent at describing disease syndromes. The key challenges identified by farmers were: foot-and-mouth disease; Newcastle disease; haemorrhagic septicaemia; chronic fasciolosis; diarrhoea; bloating diseases; goat pox; and sarcoptic mange. Improvements in the efficiency of farming in this region is a prerequisite for the local achievement of United Nations Sustainable development goals. There exist clear opportunities to increase productivity and prosperity among farmers in this region through a combination of vaccination programmes and planned animal management schemes, driven by a programme of participatory farmer education."
