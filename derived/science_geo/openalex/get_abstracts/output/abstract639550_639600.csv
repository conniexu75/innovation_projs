https://openalex.org/W2972836134,"The demand for agricultural crops continues to escalate with an increasing population. To meet this demand, marginal land can be used as a sustainable source for increased plant productivity. However, moisture stress not only affects crop growth and productivity but also induces plants' susceptibility to various diseases. The positive role of plant growth hormone, salicylic acid (SA), on the defence systems of plants has been well documented. With this in mind, a combination of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and SA was used to evaluate its performance on wheat grown under rainfed conditions (average moisture 10-14%). The selected bacterial strains were characterized for proline production, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), ammonia (NH3), and exopolysaccharides (EPS). Wheat seeds of two genotypes, Inqilab-91 (drought tolerant) and Shahkar-2013 (drought sensitive), which differed in terms of their sensitivity to drought stress, were soaked for three hours prior to sowing in 24-hour old cultures of the bacterial strains Planomicrobium chinense strain P1 (accession no. MF616408) and Bacillus cereus strain P2 (accession no. MF616406). SA was applied (150 mg/L), as a foliar spray on one-month-old wheat seedlings. A significant reduction in the physiological parameters was noted in the plants grown in rainfed conditions but the PGPR and SA treatment effectively ameliorated the adverse effects of moisture stress. The wheat plants treated with PGPR and SA showed significant increases in leaf protein and sugar contents and maintained higher chlorophyll content, chlorophyll fluorescence (fv/fm) and performance index (PI) under rainfed conditions. Leaf proline content, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant enzyme activity were higher in the non-inoculated plants grown in rainfed conditions but significantly reduced in the inoculated plants of both genotypes. Integrative use of a combination of PGPR strains and SA appears to be a promising and eco-friendly strategy for reducing moisture stress in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2972797625,"Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) is the primary sensor of nitric oxide. It has a central role in nitric oxide signalling and has been implicated in many essential physiological processes and disease conditions. The binding of nitric oxide boosts the enzymatic activity of sGC. However, the mechanism by which nitric oxide activates the enzyme is unclear. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human sGCα1β1 heterodimer in different functional states. These structures revealed that the transducer module bridges the nitric oxide sensor module and the catalytic module. Binding of nitric oxide to the β1 haem-nitric oxide and oxygen binding (H-NOX) domain triggers the structural rearrangement of the sensor module and a conformational switch of the transducer module from bending to straightening. The resulting movement of the N termini of the catalytic domains drives structural changes within the catalytic module, which in turn boost the enzymatic activity of sGC."

Such arrays have shown promise in quantum simulation of many-body systems. Norcia et al. now demonstrate that they can also be used as a platform for optical clocks. The researchers lined up 10 optical tweezers in a one-dimensional array, where each tweezer held either one or zero atoms of strontium. The atoms were subjected to laser light whose frequency was tuned to a clock transition in strontium. By monitoring the number of atoms in each tweezer, the researchers measured a long coherence time of a few seconds. Increasing the number of tweezers should improve the figures of merit of this platform. Science , this issue p. 93"
https://openalex.org/W2972603220,"As pollinator decline is increasingly reported in natural and agricultural environments, cities are perceived as shelters for pollinators because of low pesticide exposure and high floral diversity throughout the year. This has led to the development of environmental policies supporting pollinators in urban areas. However, policies are often restricted to the promotion of honey bee colony installations, which resulted in a strong increase in apiary numbers in cities. Recently, competition for floral resources between wild pollinators and honey bees has been highlighted in semi-natural contexts, but whether urban beekeeping could impact wild pollinators remains unknown. Here, we show that in the city of Paris (France), wild pollinator visitation rates are negatively correlated to honey bee colony densities present in the surrounding landscape (500m –slope = -0.614; p = 0.001 –and 1000m –slope = -0.489; p = 0.005). Regarding the morphological groups of wild pollinators, large solitary bee and beetle visitation rates were negatively affected by honey bee colony densities within a 500m buffer (slope = -0.425, p = 0.007 and slope = - 0.671, p = 0.002, respectively) and bumblebee visitation rates were negatively affected by honey bee colony density within a 1000m buffer (slope = - 0.451, p = 0.012). Further, lower interaction evenness in plant-pollinator networks was observed with high honey bee colony density within a 1000m buffer (slope = -0.487, p = 0.008). Finally, honey bees tended to focus their foraging activity on managed rather than wild plant species (student t-test, p = 0.001) whereas wild pollinators equally visited managed and wild species. We advocate responsible practices mitigating the introduction of high density of honey bee colonies in urban environments. Further studies are however needed to deepen our knowledge about the potential negative interactions between wild and domesticated pollinators."

Intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are common neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) (Mefford et al., 2012Mefford H.C. Batshaw M.L. Hoffman E.P.

Most of the associated genes regulate processes involved in neuronal morphology, synapse, and protein synthesis and turnover (Pinto et al., 2014Pinto D. Delaby E. Merico D. Barbosa M. Merikangas A.

In addition, SETD5 is lost in the 3p25.3 microdeletion syndrome, which is characterized by ID, microcephaly, congenital heart defects, and other phenotypic findings (Kellogg et al., 2013Kellogg G.

SETD5 encodes for a protein containing an SET (Su(var)3-9, enhancer-of-zeste, trithorax) domain, which suggests that it may have histone methyltransferase activity. However, it has been proposed that SETD5 regulates chromatin accessibility at promoter regions by stimulating histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, as described for its putative orthologs Set3p and UpSET (Deliu et al., 2018Deliu E. Arecco N. Morandell J. Dotter C.P. Contreras X. Girardot C. Käsper E.L. Kozlova A. Kishi K.

Homozygous deletion of Setd5 in mice is lethal at an early embryonic stage due to cardiovascular defects (Osipovich et al., 2016Osipovich A.B. Gangula R. Vianna P.G.

Few studies are reported on SETD5 molecular function during neural development and maturation and how its inactivation may lead to ID/ASD. SETD5 was suggested to mediate the transcriptional program necessary for limiting the establishment of synaptic long-term potentiation to physiological levels (Deliu et al., 2018Deliu E. Arecco N. Morandell J. Dotter C.P. Contreras X. Girardot C. Käsper E.L. Kozlova A. Kishi K. Chiaradia I. et al.Haploinsufficiency of the intellectual disability gene SETD5 disturbs developmental gene expression and cognition.Nat. Neurosci. 2018; 21: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). SETD5 was described as being associated with HDAC3 and with the polymerase-associated factor (PAF) complexes, while its intrinsic enzymatic activity has been neglected so far (Osipovich et al., 2016Osipovich A.B. Gangula R. Vianna P.G.

Wang S. et al.Setd5 haploinsufficiency alters neuronal network connectivity and leads to autistic-like behaviors in mice.Transl. Psychiatry. 2019; 9: 24Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Hence, several aspects of SETD5 remain unaddressed, in particular its function in regulating the chromatin state and organization, its importance for RNA transcriptional mechanisms, and the relation between altered gene expression and neuronal deficits. A better understanding of SETD5 functions is extremely relevant, not only for deciphering the impact of its different mutations but also for discovering new epigenetic processes associated with NDDs (Pinto et al., 2014Pinto D. Delaby E. Merico D. Barbosa M. Merikangas A. Klei L. Thiruvahindrapuram B. Xu X. Ziman R. Wang Z. et al.Convergence of genes and cellular pathways dysregulated in autism spectrum disorders.Am. J.

In this study, we revealed the SETD5 intrinsic methyltransferase activity, the inactivation of which leads to H3K36 hypo-methylation. This epigenetic alteration affects the RNA polymerase elongation rate, which affects the gene expression program that regulates neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation, synaptic transmission, and animal behavior. Temporal and spatial expression profiling revealed that SETD5 was expressed throughout the brain tissue in development and adulthood, with a higher expression in neural progenitors and post-mitotic neurons with respect to astrocytes (Figures S1A–S1E). Thus, we asked whether its silencing in neural progenitor cells could perturb the neurogenetic process during embryonic development. Initially, we adopted an efficient and selective short hairpin RNA (shRNA) for knocking down Setd5 (Figures S1F and S1G) by in utero electroporation in cortical progenitors at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) (Figure 1A). In neonatal (post-natal day 1 [P1]) brains, we noted that Setd5 knockdown (KD) cells showed a delay in radial migration (Figure 1A) and were largely positive for proliferation (Ki67) and progenitor markers (SOX2 and TBR2) compared to the control cells (Figure 1B). This suggested that Setd5 silencing altered the dynamics of proliferation and differentiation of cortical progenitor cells. We extended this analysis to Setd5 mutant mice, in which the Setd5 coding region is disrupted by the insertion of the LacZ gene, whose spatial activity recapitulates the endogenous Setd5 expression (Figure 1C). Since full Setd5 knockout (KO) animals died in utero (Osipovich et al., 2016Osipovich A.B. Gangula R. Vianna P.G. Magnuson M.A. Setd5 is essential for mammalian development and the co-transcriptional regulation of histone acetylation.Development. 2016; 143: 4595-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, Deliu et al., 2018Deliu E. Arecco N. Morandell J. Dotter C.P. Contreras X. Girardot C. Käsper E.L. Kozlova A. Kishi K. Chiaradia I. et al.Haploinsufficiency of the intellectual disability gene SETD5 disturbs developmental gene expression and cognition.Nat. Neurosci. 2018; 21: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we focused on the Setd5+/− mice that showed a 50% reduction in both mRNA and protein (Figure 1D), mirroring the genetics of the human pathology. Although at early stages wild-type (WT) and Setd5+/− embryos were comparable (Deliu et al., 2018Deliu E. Arecco N. Morandell J. Dotter C.P. Contreras X. Girardot C. Käsper E.L. Kozlova A. Kishi K. Chiaradia I. et al.Haploinsufficiency of the intellectual disability gene SETD5 disturbs developmental gene expression and cognition.Nat. Neurosci. 2018; 21: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we noticed that at mid-neurogenesis (E14.5), Setd5+/− cortices showed a mild increase in both apical (SOX2+) and intermediate (TBR2+) progenitors (Figure 1E). In addition, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) pulse and chase (24 h) coupled with Ki67 immunolabeling showed that a higher number of mutant progenitors remained in the cell-cycle, failing to initiate the differentiation (Figure 1F). Analysis of PH3+ apical and basal mitoses suggested that the most affected progenitors resided in the subventricular zone (SVZ) (Figure S1H). These findings suggest a role for SETD5 in controlling the proliferation dynamics of neural progenitors during development of the cerebral cortex. Setd5+/− post-natal animals were dwarfs compared to their WT littermates (Figure 2A). Adult mutant brains appeared grossly normal, but brain weight compared to total body mass was increased, cortical wall thickness diminished, and the ventricles were swollen (Figure S2A). According to the enhanced rate of proliferation during embryogenesis, we detected a relatively small but consistent increase in the overall neuronal population, as indicated by the general neuronal marker NEUN (+13%), with supernumerary late-born neurons (SATB2+, +12% and CUX1+, +9%) and a reduced number of early-born neurons (TBR1+, −11% and CTIP2+, −10%). This outcome is in line with the accentuated defect observed in SVZ progenitors, which preferentially generate late-born neurons through indirect neurogenesis (Sessa et al., 2008Sessa A. Mao C.A. Hadjantonakis A.K. Klein W.H. Broccoli V.

Huttner W.B. The cell biology of neurogenesis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar) (Figure S2B). We detected a decrease in the resident proteins of the pre- and postsynaptic compartments in both brain lysates and neuronal primary cultures (Figures 2B and S2C). Golgi-Cox staining revealed a decrease in the dendritic spine number of Setd5+/− principal neurons compared to controls, without changes in their shape (Figure 2C). Accordingly, Setd5+/− primary glutamatergic neurons in vitro displayed a reduction in synaptophysin puncta (Figure S2D). To examine whether synaptic transmission was also affected, we investigated spontaneous glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) in cortical slices from P30 Setd5+/− and littermate WT mice using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings (Figure 2D). While amplitude, 10%–90% rise time, and decay time constant were unaltered, the sEPSC frequency was significantly reduced in Setd5+/− neurons. Conversely, the average paired-pulse ratio of evoked EPSCs in response to pairs of local stimulations at a 50-ms interpulse interval was unchanged (Figure 2E), suggesting that the observed loss of synapses, rather than a presynaptic defect, may be responsible for the reduced sEPSC frequency in Setd5+/− mice. These findings reveal that Setd5 haploinsufficiency leads to mild cortical tissue defects with a significant electrophysiological impairment of cerebral microcircuits caused by a severe loss of glutamatergic synaptic contacts. We performed behavioral tests to assess the motor, social, and cognitive performance of Setd5+/− and WT littermate animals (Figures 3 and S3; Table S1). Setd5+/− mice exhibited a severe grade of hindlimb clasping (Figure 3A), which is a common neurological sign in mouse models of NDD (Brooks and Dunnett, 2009Brooks S.P. Dunnett S.B. Tests to assess motor phenotype in mice: a user’s guide.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). However, all of the animals showed comparable spontaneous activity in the open field. The time spent at the periphery of the cage was comparable, indicating that mutant mice did not develop heightened anxiety levels (Figure S3A) (Kas et al., 2008Kas M.J. de Mooij-van Malsen A.J. Olivier B. Spruijt B.M. van Ree J.M. Differential genetic regulation of motor activity and anxiety-related behaviors in mice using an automated home cage task.Behav. Neurosci. 2008; 122: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), as confirmed by no differences in the elevated plus maze test (Figure S3B). In addition, motor coordination and learning were not different between the two groups, as assessed by the rotarod test (Figure S3C). Accordingly, the time needed for accomplishing the beam-walking test was similar between genotypes (Figure S3D). Nevertheless, the mutants exhibited abnormal recurrent paw slipping (Figure S3D), suggesting a mild impairment in coordination skills. Next, we assessed animal behavior that is relevant for ID/ASD. Social attitude was tested by measuring the interaction between the subject, which was either a WT or an Setd5+/− animal, and a WT mouse (Silverman et al., 2010Silverman J.L. Yang M. Lord C. Crawley J.N. Behavioural phenotyping assays for mouse models of autism.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 490-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Mutant mice appeared to be far less social, as they spent less time interacting with the host, compared to the controls (Figure 3B). This effect was not due to an impaired sense of smell, since they were equally able to find food when it was either hidden or presented to them (Figure S3E). Since the mutant animals were subordinate to controls (Figure S3F), we also tested juvenile animals (P25) in which dominance is not yet established, confirming that the mutants were less social (Figure 3B). Furthermore, the three-chamber test (Papale et al., 2017Papale A. d’Isa R. Menna E. Cerovic M. Solari N. Hardingham N. Cambiaghi M. Cursi M. Barbacid M. Leocani L. et al.Severe intellectual disability and enhanced gamma-aminobutyric acidergic synaptogenesis in a novel model of rare RASopathies.Biol. Psychiatry. 2017; 81: 179-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), in which the stranger mouse was enclosed in a cage to blunt any effect of size or dominance, also suggested that Setd5+/− animals were less interested in interacting (Figure 3C). Finally, we estimated cognitive performance and memory retention based on the novel object recognition (NOR) test (Antunes and Biala, 2012Antunes M. Biala G. The novel object recognition memory: neurobiology, test procedure, and its modifications.Cogn. Process. 2012; 13: 93-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar) and eight-arm radial maze (Narita et al., 2010Narita M. Oyabu A. Imura Y. Kamada N. Yokoyama T. Tano K. Uchida A. Narita N. Nonexploratory movement and behavioral alterations in a thalidomide or valproic acid-induced autism model rat.Neurosci. Res. 2010; 66: 2-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the NOR assay, despite Setd5 mutants displaying a normal interest in the exploration, they failed to show the preference for the novel object that was exhibited by controls (Figure 3D). In the radial maze, we confirmed cognitive impairments since both the total time to perform the task and the number of incorrect choices were significantly higher in mutants compared to controls (Figure 3E). These analyses revealed the abnormal behavior of Setd5 mutant mice, which is in line with the clinical manifestations described in patients. We generated mouse primary NSCs carrying an inactivating mutation in one Setd5 allele by CRISPR-Cas9 gene targeting (Figures 4A, S4A, and S4B) (Zhang et al., 2014aZhang F. Wen Y. Guo X. CRISPR/Cas9 for genome editing: progress, implications and challenges.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2014; 23: R40-R46Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), which resulted in a 50% SETD5 decrease, modeling the human pathological condition (Figure 4B). Setd5 mutant NSCs displayed an increase in their proliferation, as confirmed by both the neurosphere assay (Figure 4C) and Ki67 and PH3 immunoreactivity (Figure 4D). Setd5 mutant NSCs exhibited an altered differentiation potential generating more TUBB3+/MAP2+ neurons and fewer O4+ oligodendrocytes compared to control cells (Figure S4C). Next, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to investigate the global gene expression upon Setd5 loss, showing that 861 genes were upregulated and 1,708 genes were downregulated after SETD5 depletion (Figures 4E and S4D; Table S2). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis identified several biological processes to be significantly altered in mutant cells, including RNA processing, mitochondrial organization, and synaptic plasticity (downregulation), as well as negative regulation of biosynthesis, negative regulation of transcription, and positive regulation of the cell cycle (upregulation) (Figure 4F; Table S3). We observed common GO terms between deregulated genes in Setd5 mutant NSCs and genes associated with ID/ASD (SFARI database), which indicates that our cellular model had aberrant features that may also occur in human NDDs (Table S3). Some SETD5-regulated genes identified in NSCs, specifically Nova1, Fus, Sfpq (RNA processing), and Polg (mitochondrial polymerase) were modulated similarly in vivo (Figure S4E). These findings suggest that SETD5 affects brain developmental processes such as neural progenitor cell-cycle and neuronal maturation by regulating the gene expression program. We investigated SETD5 distribution by performing chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing [ChIP-seq]) analyses in WT NSCs (Table S4). SETD5 was found to be localized on 4,729 genes and was enriched on gene bodies, but not on promoters (Figure 5A; Table S4). Comparative analyses with the pattern of histone modifications showed that SETD5 binding correlated with the H3K36me3 on active genes (Figures 5B and S5A). A total of 80% of SETD5 binding occurred within the H3K36me3 peaks (p < 0.001), enriched along the bodies of genes involved in cell-cycle control and RNA processing (Figure 5C; Table S5). H3K36me3 is generally deposited on the intragenic regions of active genes (Wagner and Carpenter, 2012Wagner E.J. Carpenter P.B. Understanding the language of Lys36 methylation at histone H3.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) (Figure 5D, blue), and, accordingly, our data suggested that SETD5 showed preferential binding along gene bodies with progressive enrichment toward the 3′ end of the gene and depletion in the promoter (Figure 5D, red). Furthermore, SETD5 occupancy directly correlated with H3K36me3 levels while being reduced on K27me3-marked repressed domains and K4me3-marked active promoters (Figures 5E and S5B). By using a multivariate hidden Markov model (ChromHMM) to determine chromatin states (Ernst and Kellis, 2012Ernst J. Kellis M. ChromHMM: automating chromatin-state discovery and characterization.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 215-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar), we found that SETD5 occupancy combined with H3K36me3 defined the transcription elongation state that is enriched at gene bodies (Figure 5F). In the same analysis, we also retrieved a unique SETD5-associated state that marked the transcription end sites (TESs) (Figure 5F). Considering that H3K36me3 deposition is enriched at exons while it is depleted from the first intron (Huff et al., 2010Huff J.T. Plocik A.M. Guthrie C. Yamamoto K.R. Reciprocal intronic and exonic histone modification regions in humans.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, Jonkers et al., 2014Jonkers I. Kwak H. Lis J.T. Genome-wide dynamics of Pol II elongation and its interplay with promoter proximal pausing, chromatin, and exons.eLife. 2014; 3: e02407Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), we compared the association of SETD5 with respect to the length of the first intron. We found that its occupancy increased proportionally with the first intron size expansion and consequently with gene length (Figure 5G). We also noticed that SETD5 was preferentially associated with genes with a higher number of exons and specifically genes with the highest exon density, which correlates these genomic features with H3K36me3 deposition (Figure 5G). Accordingly, both SETD5 and H3K36me3 coverage were very low on intronless genes (Figure S5C). We found that SETD5 preferentially associated with the most expressed genes (Table S6), similar to K36me3 enrichment (Figure 5H). Of note, genes with promoters containing CpG islands, which are associated with increased chromatin accessibility and transcription initiation, poorly correlated with SETD5 binding (Figure S5D). Since SETD5 has been associated biochemically with the PAF complex, we analyzed the genome-wide distribution of complex members PAF1 and LEO1 (Strikoudis et al., 2016Strikoudis A. Lazaris C. Trimarchi T. Galvao Neto A.L. Yang Y. Ntziachristos P. Rothbart S. Buckley S. Dolgalev I. Stadtfeld M. et al.Regulation of transcriptional elongation in pluripotency and cell differentiation by the PHD-finger protein Phf5a.Nat. Cell Biol. 2016; 18: 1127-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and noticed that their binding on gene bodies is higher on the SETD5 targets compared to the other expressed genes (Figures S5E and S5F). These data indicate a strong concordance between the genomic distribution of the SETD5 binding and the deposition of the H3K36me3 histone mark on neural cell chromatin. We found that the pattern of histone marks was not globally perturbed in mutant NSCs, including the distribution of H3K36me3 (Figures S6A and S6B; Table S4). However, considering the highly expressed genes, where SETD5 is enriched, we observed a reduction in H3K36me3 distribution along gene bodies (Figure 6A). Accordingly, we detected a significant decrease in H3K36me3 on the exons of the SETD5 target genes along with an increase in H3K36me2 levels (Figures 6B and S6C). We also measured a decrement in H3K36me3 at the 5′-UTR (where this mark is low) and the 3′-UTR (Figures 6B and S6D), which indicates that the perturbation of H3K36me3 has spread along gene bodies. These data support the direct involvement of SETD5 in depositing H3K36me3, while we did not retrieve any significant alteration in other chromatin modifications, including H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac, which correlates with active promoters, and the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 (Figures 6C–6E).

We report the diversity of terpene profiles across samples bound for the Washington dispensary market. The remarkable degree of variation in terpene profiles ultimately results from action of a family of terpene synthase genes, only some of which have been described. Using a recently available genome assembly we describe 55 terpene synthases with genomic context, and tissue specific expression. The family is quite diverse from a protein similarity perspective, and subsets of the family are expressed in all tissues in the plant, including a set of root specific monoterpene synthases that could well have agronomic importance. Ultimately understanding and breeding for specific terpene profiles will require a good understanding of the gene family that underlies it. We intend for this work to serve as a foundation for that."
https://openalex.org/W2972879831,"Arachis hypogea (Peanut) is one of the most important crops, and it is harvested and used for food and oil production. Being a legume crop, the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen is achieved through symbiotic association. Nitrogen deficiency is one of the major constrains for loss of crop productivity. The bacterium Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is known for interactions with plants. In this study, characteristics that promote plant growth were explored for their ability to enhance the growth of peanut plants under N2 deficit condition. In the presence of S. maltophilia, it was observed that fatty acid composition of peanut plants was influenced and increased contents of omega-7 monounsaturated fatty acid and omega-6 fatty acid (γ-Linolenic acid) were detected. Plant growth was increased in plants co-cultivated with PGPR (Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria) under normal and stress (nitrogen deficient) condition. Electrolyte leakage, lipid peroxidation, and H2O2 content reduced in plants, co-cultivated with PGPR under normal (grown in a media supplemented with N2 source; C+) or stress (nitrogen deficient N+) conditions compared to the corresponding control plants (i.e. not co-cultivated with PGPR; C–or N–). The growth hormone auxin, osmoprotectants (proline, total soluble sugars and total amino acids), total phenolic-compounds and total flavonoid content were enhanced in plants co-cultivated with PGPR. Additionally, antioxidant and free radical scavenging (DPPH, hydroxyl and H2O2) activities were increased in plants that were treated with PGPR under both normal and N2 deficit condition. Overall, these results indicate that plants co-cultivated with PGPR, S. maltophilia, increase plant growth, antioxidant levels, scavenging, and stress tolerance under N2 deficit condition. The beneficial use of bacterium S. maltophilia could be explored further as an efficient PGPR for growing agricultural crops under N2 deficit conditions. However, a detail agronomic study would be prerequisite to confirm its commercial role."

Ten male athletes were involved in a randomized, crossover study. The subjects performed 3 sets of 6 repetitions of EOL or TW half squat exercise followed by SLJ, CMJ, and 5 m sprint tests at 1 min, 3 min and 7 min, in separate sessions using a randomized order. Bayes factor (BF10) was reported to show the strength of the evidence. Differences were found using EOL for SLJ distance at 3 min (BF10 = 7.24, +8%), and 7 min (BF10 = 19.5, +7%), for CMJ at 3 min (BF10 = 3.25, +9%), and 7 min (BF10 = 4.12, +10.5%). Differences were found using TW exercise for SLJ at 3 min (BF10 = 3.88, +9%), and 7 min (BF10 = 12.4, +9%), CMJ at 3 min (BF10 = 7.42, +9.5%), and 7 min (BF10 = 12.4, +12%). No meaningful differences were found between EOL and TW exercises for SLJ (BF10 = 0.33), CMJ (BF10 = 0.27), and 5 m sprint (BF10 = 0.22). In conclusion, EOL and TW exercises acutely increase SLJ and CMJ, but not 5 m sprint performance. The PAP time window was found between 3 min and 7 min using both protocols. This study did not find differences between EOL and TW exercises, and so both methodologies can be used to stimulate a PAP response."

A total of 173 UPEC and DEC strains were examined for phylogenetic typing and urovirulence genes by PCR amplifications. In contrast to most reports, phylogenetic group A was the most prevalent in both UPEC and DEC strains, followed by B2 group. Amplification assays revealed that 89.32% and 94.29% of UPEC and DEC strains, respectively, carried at least one of the urovirulence genes, 49.5% and 31.4% of UPEC and DEC strains, respectively, carried ≥ 2 of the urovirulence genes, fim H gene was the most prevalent (66.9% and 91.4%) in UPEC and DEC strains respectively. Twenty different patterns of virulence genes were identified in UPEC while 5 different patterns in DEC strains. Strains with combined virulence patterns of four or five genes were belonged to phylogenetic group B2. Our finding showed a closer relationship between the DEC and UPEC, so raised the suggestion that some DEC strains might be potential uropathogens. These findings also provide different insights into the phylogenetic classification of E. coli as pathogenic or commensals where group A can be an important pathogenic type as well as into the classification as intestinal or extra- intestinal virulence factors."

We compared their concentrations of IL (interleukin)-1β, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, placental growth factor (PlGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the aqueous humor as well as their optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings, and baseline characteristics. We used logistic regression analyses to identify preoperative factors related to refractoriness to treatments.Of 119 treatment-naïve DME patients, 50 (42.02%) patients showed responsiveness [central subfield thickness (CST) < 300μm] after 3 IVBs, and 59 (49.58%) patients showed responsiveness after an additional dexamethasone implant, but 10 (8.40%) patients showed CST 300 ≥ μm even after both treatments. Refractory DME patients showed significantly higher number of hyperreflective foci (HF) in the OCT and higher average level of aqueous IL-1β at baseline (p<0.001 and p = 0.042, respectively). In the logistic regression analysis, higher number of HF in the OCT was associated with the refractoriness to both treatments (odds ratio [OR]: 7.03, p = 0.007).Higher number of HF in the OCT at the initial visit was associated with poor responses to IVBs and an additional dexamethasone implant."

A group of 274 patients was divided into two cohorts based on the history of prior RT: the RT group included 79 patients and the non-RT group included 195 patients. Postoperative (30-day) complications were compared between the groups with a nonstandardized evaluation system and the Clavien-Dindo classification.The grades of complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification were significantly higher in the RT group than in the non-RT group. The frequency of postoperative complications did not differ significantly between the groups according to the nonstandardized evaluation system.The Clavien-Dindo classification could serve as a useful, highly objective tool for grading operative morbidity after microvascular head and neck reconstruction when comparing similar defects and methods of reconstruction.

Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess associations between variables and ESBL-carriage.In total, 385 residents from 12 LTCFs (range 15-48 residents per LTCF) were enrolled. The prevalence of carriage of MDRGN was 18.2% (range among LTCFs 0-47%) and the prevalence of ESBL-E alone was 14.5% (range among LTCFs: 0-34%). Of 63 MDRGN positive residents, 50 (79%) were ESBL-E positive of which 43 (86%) produced CTX-M. Among 44 residents with ESBL-E positive fecal samples of whom data on contact precautions were available at the time of sampling, only 9 (20%) were already known as ESBL-E carriers. The prevalence for carriage of MRSA was 0.8% (range per LTCF: 0-7%) and VRE 0%. One CPE colonized resident was found. All fecal samples tested negative for presence of plasmid mediated resistance for colistin (MCR-1). Typing of isolates by Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) showed five MDRGN clusters, of which one was found in multiple LTCFs and four were found in single LTCFs, suggesting transmission within and between LTCFs. In multivariate analysis only the presence of MDRO in the preceding year remained a risk factor for ESBL-E carriage.The ESBL-carriage rate of residents in LTCFs is nearly two times higher than in the general population but varies considerably among LTCFs in Amsterdam, whereas carriage of MRSA and VRE is low. The majority (80%) of ESBL-E positive residents had not been detected by routine culture of clinical specimens at time of sampling. Current infection control practices in LTCFs in Amsterdam do not prevent transmission. Both improvement of basic hygiene, and funding for laboratory screening, should allow LTCFs in Amsterdam to develop standards of care to prevent transmission of ESBL-E."

Data were analysed using descriptive statistics.326 individuals completed the questionnaire (response rate 24%). 37% of responders were in their 5th- 6th clinical term, 32% were in their 7th-8th term and 31% were in the 9th-12th term. 69% of students had a specific safety concern in the past four weeks, 48% had observed an error and 68% noticed the violation of a patient safety rule. Though students perceived specific patient safety concerns, 56% did not speak up in a critical situation. All predefined barriers seemed to play an important role in inhibiting students' voicing concerns. The scores on the psychological safety scale were overall moderately favourable. Students felt little encouraged by colleagues and, in particular, by supervisors to speak up.Speaking up behaviour of students was assessed for the first time in an Austrian academic teaching hospital.

https://openalex.org/W2972928338,"Background Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an evidence-based treatment for depression that is increasingly implemented in healthcare systems across the world. A new form of rTMS called intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) can be delivered in 3 min and has demonstrated comparable effectiveness to the conventional 37.5 min 10Hz rTMS protocol in patients with depression. Objectives To compare the direct treatment costs per course and per remission for iTBS compared to 10Hz rTMS treatment in depression. Methods We conducted a cost analysis from a healthcare system perspective using patient-level data from a large randomized non-inferiority trial (THREE-D). Depressed adults 18 to 65 received either 10Hz rTMS or iTBS treatment. Treatment costs were calculated using direct healthcare costs associated with equipment, coils, physician assessments and technician time over the course of treatment. Cost per remission was estimated using the proportion of patients achieving remission following treatment. Deterministic sensitivity analyses and non-parametric bootstrapping was used to estimate uncertainty. Results From a healthcare system perspective, the average cost per patient was USD$1,108 (SD 166) for a course of iTBS and $1,844 (SD 304) for 10Hz rTMS, with an incremental net savings of $735 (95% CI 688 to 783). The average cost per remission was $3,695 (SD 552) for iTBS and $6,146 (SD 1,015) for 10Hz rTMS, with an average incremental net savings of $2,451 (95% CI 2,293 to 2,610). Conclusions The shorter session durations and treatment capacity increase associated with 3 min iTBS translate into significant cost-savings per patient and per remission when compared to 10Hz rTMS."
https://openalex.org/W2973060140,"Ligand-dependent differences in the regulation and internalization of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) have been linked to the severity of adverse effects that limit opiate use in pain management. MOR activation by morphine or [d-Ala2,N-MePhe4, Gly-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO) causes differences in spatiotemporal signaling dependent on MOR distribution at the plasma membrane. Morphine stimulation of MOR activates a Gαi/o–Gβγ–protein kinase C (PKC) α phosphorylation pathway that limits MOR distribution and is associated with a sustained increase in cytosolic extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity. In contrast, DAMGO causes a redistribution of the MOR at the plasma membrane (before receptor internalization) that facilitates transient activation of cytosolic and nuclear ERK. Here, we used proximity biotinylation proteomics to dissect the different protein-interaction networks that underlie the spatiotemporal signaling of morphine and DAMGO. We found that DAMGO, but not morphine, activates Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1). Both Rac1 and nuclear ERK activity depended on the scaffolding proteins IQ motif-containing GTPase-activating protein-1 (IQGAP1) and Crk-like (CRKL) protein. In contrast, morphine increased the proximity of the MOR to desmosomal proteins, which form specialized and highly-ordered membrane domains. Knockdown of two desmosomal proteins, junction plakoglobin or desmocolin-1, switched the morphine spatiotemporal signaling profile to mimic that of DAMGO, resulting in a transient increase in nuclear ERK activity.

In contrast, morphine is unable to cause any change in MOR distribution at the plasma membrane. This is due to activation of a Gαi/o–Gβγ–protein kinase C (PKC) α phosphorylation pathway, and it results in a sustained increase in cytosolic ERK only. Release of the morphine-stimulated MOR from this limited microdomain (by inhibition of Gβγ, PKC, or disruption of the lipid organization of the plasma membrane) caused redistribution of the receptor and activation of nuclear ERK (8Halls M.L. Yeatman H.R. Nowell C.J. Thompson G.L. Gondin A.B. Civciristov S. Bunnett N.W. Lambert N.A. Poole D.P. Canals M.

Therefore, different ligands cause clear differences in the spatial organization of the receptor that controls its spatiotemporal signaling. The molecular mechanism through which this change in receptor distribution leads to distinct signaling patterns remains to be addressed. The activation of different spatiotemporal signaling pathways by a GPCR can be controlled by a change in receptor location (8Halls M.L. Yeatman H.R. Nowell C.J. Thompson G.L. Gondin A.B.

Such a protein-interaction network could be physically associated with the GPCR or occur in close proximity within a localized area of the plasma membrane. Until recently, identification of a GPCR-signaling complex required prior knowledge of candidate proteins (e.g. functionally, by targeting likely candidates with chemical inhibitors or gene silencing, or physically, by choosing targets to identify during immunoblotting or immunostaining). Confirmation of a physical interaction within a complex could then be confirmed by biochemical or imaging techniques (e.g. co-immunoprecipitation, FRET, or proximity ligation assay). This approach has its limitations, as the investigator must first choose a likely candidate, and biochemical isolation of protein complexes usually preserves only very strong/direct interactions. The rise of proximity biotinylation proteomics approaches (12Lobingier B.T. Hüttenhain R. Eichel K. Miller K.B. Ting A.Y. von Zastrow M. Krogan N.J. An approach to spatiotemporally resolve protein-interaction networks in living cells.Cell. 2017; 169 (28388416): 350-360.e1210.1016/j.cell.2017.03.022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 13Paek J.

Here, we have used APEX2 (ascorbate peroxidase from the soy bean) proximity biotinylation proteomics to show that activation of MOR by DAMGO or morphine induces the assembly of different protein-interaction networks, and that these protein-interaction networks are critical for the activation of downstream signaling. DAMGO stimulation of the MOR led to increased proximity of the receptor to proteins that are essential for receptor internalization, but also identified protein networks involved in the activation of small G proteins. Based on this, we found a DAMGO-mediated activation of Rac1, a small G protein of the Rho family of GTPases that are important regulators of cytoskeletal organization and trafficking (14Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Small GTP-binding proteins.Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81 (11152757): 153-20810.1152/physrev.2001.81.1.153Crossref PubMed Scopus (2056) Google Scholar). The activation of Rac1 by MOR depended on two scaffolding proteins, IQ motif-containing GTPase-activating protein-1 (IQGAP1) and Crk-like protein (CRKL). Moreover, both IQGAP1 and CRKL were required for the DAMGO-mediated activation of nuclear ERK. In contrast, morphine stimulation of the MOR led to an increased proximity of the receptor to protein networks that are critical for the formation of desmosomes. Desmosomes are specialized regions of the plasma membrane that form cell–cell junction complexes and can assemble signaling hubs (15Kowalczyk A.P. Green K.J. Structure, function, and regulation of desmosomes.Prog. Mol. Biol. Transl. Sci. 2013; 116 (23481192): 95-11810.1016/B978-0-12-394311-8.00005-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 16Garrod D. Chidgey M. Desmosome structure, composition and function.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778 (17854763): 572-58710.1016/j.bbamem.2007.07.014Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Knockdown of desmosomal proteins desmocolin-1 (DSC1) and junction plakoglobin (JUP) transformed the morphine spatiotemporal signaling profile into that of DAMGO: transient activation of nuclear ERK. This suggests that the restricted distribution of MOR in response to morphine (and therefore activation of sustained ERK within the cytoplasm) is, at least in part, dependent on the formation of desmosome protein networks around the receptor. These data show that the distinct spatiotemporal signaling profiles stimulated by DAMGO compared with morphine activation of the MOR are not only dependent on the spatial organization of the receptor at the plasma membrane but also on the assembly of distinct protein-interaction networks in close proximity to the receptor. To identify protein-interaction networks that are important for activation of the distinct spatiotemporal signaling profiles elicited by DAMGO versus morphine stimulation of the MOR, we employed APEX2 (17Lam S.S. Martell J.D. Kamer K.J. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Mootha V.K. Ting A.Y. Directed evolution of APEX2 for electron microscopy and proximity labeling.Nat.

The APEX2 tag was added to the C-terminal tail of the FLAG–MOR (herein referred to as MOR) to generate FLAG–MOR–APEX2 (herein referred to as MOR–APEX2). As demonstrated previously for the MOR transiently expressed in HEK293 cells (8Halls M.L. Yeatman H.R. Nowell C.J. Thompson G.L. Gondin A.B. Civciristov S. Bunnett N.W. Lambert N.A. Poole D.P. Canals M. Plasma membrane localization of the μ-opioid receptor controls spatiotemporal signaling.Sci. Signal. 2016; 9 (26861044): ra1610.1126/scisignal.aac9177Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), all MOR–APEX2 were expressed at the cell surface (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1A), inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP (Fig. 1C), and recruited β-arrestin 2 to the plasma membrane in response to DAMGO (Fig. 1D). The lower level of expression of MOR-APEX (∼31% compared with MOR) was reflected in the smaller degree of cAMP inhibition and β-arrestin 2 recruitment to the cell surface in response to DAMGO. Importantly, MOR–APEX2 also maintained the ligand-dependent spatiotemporal signaling profiles of MOR. Activation of both MOR and MOR–APEX2 with an EC80 concentration of DAMGO (10 nm) (8Halls M.L. Yeatman H.R. Nowell C.J. Thompson G.L. Gondin A.B. Civciristov S. Bunnett N.W. Lambert N.A. Poole D.P. Canals M.

Signal. 2016; 9 (26861044): ra1610.1126/scisignal.aac9177Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) caused a transient increase in cytosolic and nuclear ERK (Fig. 1, E–H, and Fig. S2). In contrast, an EC80 concentration of morphine (100 nm) (8Halls M.L. Yeatman H.R. Nowell C.J. Thompson G.L. Gondin A.B. Civciristov S. Bunnett N.W. Lambert N.A. Poole D.P. Canals M.

Therefore, MOR–APEX2 is functional and maintains the ligand-dependent spatiotemporal signaling profile of MOR. Following the addition of biotin-tyramide to the cell culture medium, and activation by hydrogen peroxide, APEX2 biotinylates competent proximal proteins with its activity decreasing with distance over a 20-nm radius (18Hung V.

The biotinylated proteins can be identified by cell lysis and streptavidin pulldown, followed by either immunoblotting or MS.

GRK2 and GRK3 are important for receptor phosphorylation following activation by DAMGO, but not morphine (5Just S. Illing S. Trester-Zedlitz M. Lau E.K. Kotowski S.J. Miess E. Mann A. Doll C.

As anticipated, the addition of DAMGO caused an increase in the biotinylation of GRK2 that peaked at 3–4 min, before declining at 5 min (Fig. 1I and Fig. S1C). In contrast, there was no change in the amount of biotinylated GRK2 in response to morphine (Fig. S1, B and C). Interestingly, the kinetics of GRK2 biotinylation occur over a longer time scale than our previous measurements of GRK2 recruitment using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) and FRET (plateau at 2 min) (7Miess E.

This suggests a lag period between the recruitment of the protein detected by BRET/FRET, and the ability to observe a detectable change in the biotinylation status of the same protein by immunoblotting. As MOR–APEX2 activates the same spatiotemporal signaling pathways as MOR, and we can detect time-dependent changes in the biotinylation of proteins important in receptor regulation, we performed APEX2 proximity biotinylation assays followed by tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) to identify other proteins likely to contribute to ligand-dependent signaling. Cells transiently expressing MOR–APEX2 were treated with vehicle, 1 μm DAMGO, or 1 μm morphine for 10 min (after receptor redistribution but prior to internalization) or 60 min (after receptor internalization) (8Halls M.L. Yeatman H.R. Nowell C.J. Thompson G.L. Gondin A.B. Civciristov S. Bunnett N.W. Lambert N.A. Poole D.P. Canals M.

We used saturating concentrations of DAMGO and morphine to ensure full receptor occupancy and therefore maximal receptor activation and biotinylation of proximal proteins. Importantly, differential spatiotemporal signaling of the MOR is maintained in response to 1 μm DAMGO and 1 μm morphine (Fig. 4D). APEX2 was activated by a 1-min treatment with hydrogen peroxide at the end of the stimulation period, before quenching, cell lysis, and isolation of biotinylated proteins by streptavidin pulldown. Biotinylated proteins from three biological replicates were identified and quantified by LC-MS/MS (Table S1). In total, 374 proteins were identified across three independent replicates of the six experimental conditions, with 219 proteins showing a change in enrichment of more than 1.5-fold compared with vehicle controls (Fig. 2A). Although some proteins were enriched across all treatment groups, we also identified proteins that were unique to both drug treatment and time of stimulation. In some cases, proteins were absent in vehicle-treated samples but present following stimulation with DAMGO or morphine, or vice versa (i.e. ligand-induced). If this occurred in all three independent replicates, we imputed a fixed value for the missing conditions to analyze the data (see “Experimental procedures”).Figure 2Stimulation of MOR–APEX2 with DAMGO, but not morphine, identifies protein networks important for endocytosis.

This was chosen as it is well-documented that DAMGO causes robust internalization of the MOR by 60 min, whereas morphine causes very limited receptor internalization (8Halls M.L. Yeatman H.R.

Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) software identified a network of proteins important for endocytosis that was differentially affected by DAMGO versus morphine stimulation of MOR–APEX2 (Fig. 2, B and C, and Table 1). For example, stimulation of MOR–APEX2 for 60 min with DAMGO, but not morphine, caused an enrichment in proteins essential for endocytosis, including clathrin heavy chain (CLTC) and Rab7a.Table 1Proteins from interaction networks important for endocytosisGene nameProtein nameLog2 valueDAMGOMorphineACTN4Actinin α40.395−0.296ANXA5Annexin A50.3790.224ARF1ADP ribosylation factor 10.235−0.104ATP5F1BATP synthase F1 subunit β0.113−0.244CANXCalnexin.1.0560.091CKBCreatine kinase B0.9280.352CLTCClathrin heavy chain0.652−0.146CTTNCortactin0.7750.201EZREzrin0.11−0.868FLNAFilamin A0.356−0.069HNRNPKHeterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K−0.102−0.539HSP90AA1Heat-shock protein 90α family class A member 1−0.147−0.678HSPA5Heat-shock protein familyA (Hsp70) member 50.7950.379IQGAP1IQ motif containing GTPase-activating protein 11.1650MYH9Myosin heavy chain 9−0.129−0.489NCLNucleolin−0.359−0.651NPM1Nucleophosmin 1−0.159−0.475PACSIN2Protein kinase C and casein kinase substrate in neurons 2−0.7350PFN1Profilin 10.054−0.24RAB5CRAB5C, member RAS oncogene family0.4260.209RAB7ARAB7A, member RAS oncogene family0.294−0.432RACK1Receptor for activated C kinase 1−0.049−0.193RUVBL2RuvB like AAA ATPase 20.5−0.144S100A9S100 calcium-binding protein A9−0.972−0.139TFRCTransferrin receptor−0.52−0.744VIMVimentin−0.161−0.591 Open table in a new tab Interestingly, whereas stimulation of MOR–APEX2 for 10 min identified some proteins that were differentially affected by DAMGO versus morphine, IPA software did not identify any protein-interaction networks that were differentially affected by the two ligands at this time point (Fig. S3). In contrast, differences in protein-interaction networks were more apparent following a 60-min stimulation with ligand, so these interaction networks were examined in more detail. We first looked for novel protein-interaction networks that were specific for DAMGO stimulation of MOR–APEX2. Three interconnected canonical pathways were identified that were exclusively affected by DAMGO: (i) actin cytoskeleton signaling; (ii) signaling by Rho family GTPases; and (iii) integrin signaling. We listed all proteins within these three canonical pathways that were identified in at least two out of the three biological replicates in response to DAMGO. Of this list, if a protein was found in only one biological replicate for vehicle or morphine treatment, it was excluded due to low confidence. The only exception to this was when a protein was completely absent in vehicle-treated samples but present in two out of the three biological replicates following a drug treatment, or vice versa (i.e. ligand-dependent protein interactions).

In this study, eight Mexican H7N3 HPAI viruses from 2015–2017 were isolated and fully sequenced. No evidence of reassortment was detected with other avian influenza (AI) viruses, but phylogenetic analyses show divergence of all eight gene segments into three genetic clusters by 2015, with 94.94 to 98.78 percent nucleotide homology of the HA genes when compared to the index virus from 2012. The HA protein of viruses from each cluster showed a different number of basic amino acids (n = 5–7) in the cleavage site, and six different patterns at the predicted N-glycosylation sites. Comparison of the sequences of the Mexican lineage H7N3 HPAI viruses and American ancestral wild bird AI viruses to characterize the virus evolutionary dynamics showed that the nucleotide substitution rates in PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, and NS genes greatly increased once the virus was introduced into poultry. The global nonsynonymous and synonymous ratios imply strong purifying selection driving the evolution of the virus. Forty-nine positively selected sites out of 171 nonsynonymous mutations were identified in the Mexican H7N3 HPAI viruses, including 7 amino acid changes observed in higher proportion in North American poultry origin AI viruses isolates than in wild bird-origin viruses. Continuous monitoring and molecular characterization of the H7N3 HPAI virus is important for better understanding of the virus evolutionary dynamics and further improving control measures including vaccination."

This study sought to determine the relationship of inflammatory mediators and metabolites in cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) with spontaneous PTD (sPTD) and delivery within 14 days of presentation with symptoms of preterm labour (PTL). CVF samples from 94 (preterm = 19, term = 75) singleton women with symptoms of PTL studied between 19+0-36+6 weeks' gestation were analysed for cytokines/chemokines by multiplexed bead-based immunoassay, while metabolites were quantified by enzyme-based spectrophotometry in a subset of 61 women (preterm = 16, term = 45). Prevalence of targeted vaginal bacterial species was determined for 70 women (preterm = 14, term = 66) by PCR. Overall, 10 women delivered within 14 days of sampling. Predictive capacities of individual biomarkers and cytokine-metabolite combinations for sPTD and delivery within 14 days of sampling were analysed by logistic regression models and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Fusobacterium sp., Mubiluncus mulieris and Mycoplasma hominis were detected in more preterm-delivered than term women (P<0.0001), while, M. curtisii was found in more term-delivered than preterm women (P<0.0001). RANTES (0.91, 0.65-1.0), IL-6 (0.79, 0.67-0.88), and Acetate/Glutamate ratio (0.74, 0.61-0.85) were associated with delivery within 14 days of sampling (AUC, 95% CI). There were significant correlations between cytokines and metabolites, and several cytokine-metabolite combinations were associated with sPTD or delivery within 14 days of sampling (e.g. L/D-lactate ratio+Acetate/Glutamate ratio+IL-6: 0.84, 0.67-0.94). Symptomatic women destined to deliver preterm and within 14 days of sampling express significantly higher pro-inflammatory mediators at mid to late gestation. In this cohort, IL-6, Acetate/Glutamate ratio and RANTES were associated with delivery within 14 days of sampling, consistent with their roles in modulating infection-inflammation-associated preterm labour in women presenting with symptoms of preterm birth. Replication of these observations in larger cohorts of women could show potential clinical utility."

In addition to the use of sentinel fish, the examination of diseased fish is a fundamental part of all health monitoring concepts. PCR assays offer excellent sensitivity and the ability to test a broad variety of pathogenic agents in different sample types. Recently, it was shown that analysis of environmental samples such as water, sludge or detritus from static tanks can complement PCR analysis of fish and is actually more reliable for certain pathogens. In our study, we investigated whether the analysis of filtered water mixed with detritus of tanks including fish showing clinical signs of illness is suitable to complement health monitoring programs in recirculating systems. The obtained data indicate that pathogens such as Pseudoloma neurophilia or Myxidium streisingeri were exclusively or mainly found in fish, while mycobacteria were predominantly present in environmental samples. A combination of both sample types seems to be required for the detection of a broad range of infectious agents in zebrafish colonies using real-time PCR technology."
https://openalex.org/W2972542730,"Measuring pressures within complex multi-cellular environments is critical for studying mechanobiology as these forces trigger diverse biological responses, however, these studies are difficult as a deeply embedded yet well-calibrated probe is required. In this manuscript, we use endogenous cell nuclei as pressure sensors by introducing a fluorescent protein localized to the nucleus and confocal microscopy to measure the individual nuclear volumes in 3D multi-cellular aggregates. We calibrate this measurement of nuclear volume to pressure by quantifying the nuclear volume change as a function of osmotic pressure in isolated 2D culture. Using this technique, we find that in multicellular structures, the nuclear compressive mechanical stresses are on the order of MPa, increase with cell number in the cluster, and that the distribution of stresses is homogenous in spherical cell clusters, but highly asymmetric in oblong clusters. This approach may facilitate quantitative mechanical measurements in complex and extended biological structures both in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2972718470,"Key message: One QTL for resistance against Leptosphaeria maculans growth in leaves of young plants in controlled environments overlapped with one QTL detected in adult plants in field experiments. The fungal pathogen Leptosphaeria maculans initially infects leaves of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) in autumn in Europe and then grows systemically from leaf lesions along the leaf petiole to the stem, where it causes damaging phoma stem canker (blackleg) in summer before harvest. Due to the difficulties of investigating resistance to L. maculans growth in leaves and petioles under field conditions, identification of quantitative resistance typically relies on end of season stem canker assessment on adult plants. To investigate whether quantitative resistance can be detected in young plants, we first selected nine representative DH (doubled haploid) lines from an oilseed rape DY (‘Darmor-bzh’ × ‘Yudal’) mapping population segregating for quantitative resistance against L. maculans for controlled environment experiment (CE). We observed a significant correlation between distance grown by L. maculans along the leaf petiole towards the stem (r = 0.91) in CE experiments and the severity of phoma stem canker in field experiments. To further investigate quantitative trait loci (QTL) related to resistance against growth of L. maculans in leaves of young plants in CE experiments, we selected 190 DH lines and compared the QTL detected in CE experiments with QTL related to stem canker severity in stems of adult plants in field experiments. Five QTL for resistance to L. maculans growth along the leaf petiole were detected; collectively they explained 35% of the variance. Two of these were also detected in leaf lesion area assessments and each explained 10–12% of the variance. One QTL on A02 co-localized with a QTL detected in stems of adult plants in field experiments. This suggests that resistance to the growth of L. maculans from leaves along the petioles towards the stems contributes to the quantitative resistance assessed in stems of adult plants in field experiments at the end of the growing season."
https://openalex.org/W2973170669,"Mammalian mitochondrial NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD-IDH) catalyzes the decarboxylation of isocitrate into α-ketoglutarate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. It exists as the α2βγ heterotetramer composed of the αβ and αγ heterodimers. Different from the αγ heterodimer that can be allosterically activated by CIT and ADP, the αβ heterodimer cannot be allosterically regulated by the activators; however, the molecular mechanism is unclear. We report here the crystal structures of the αβ heterodimer of human NAD-IDH with the α subunit in apo form and in Ca2+-bound, NAD-bound, and NADH-bound forms. Structural analyses and comparisons reveal that the αβ heterodimer has a similar yet more compact overall structure compared with the αγ heterodimer and contains a pseudo-allosteric site that is structurally different from the allosteric site. In particular, the β3-α3 and β12-α8 loops of the β subunit at the pseudo-allosteric site adopt significantly different conformations from those of the γ subunit at the allosteric site and hence impede the binding of the activators, explaining why the αβ heterodimer cannot be allosterically regulated by the activators. The structural data also show that NADH can compete with NAD to bind to the active site and inhibits the activity of the αβ heterodimer. These findings together with the biochemical data reveal the molecular basis for the function of the αβ heterodimer of human NAD-IDH."
https://openalex.org/W2972545602,"The mesoderm is one of the three germ layers produced during gastrulation from which muscle, bones, kidneys, and the cardiovascular system originate. Understanding the mechanisms that control mesoderm specification could inform many applications, including the development of regenerative medicine therapies to manage diseases affecting these tissues. Here, we used human pluripotent stem cells to investigate the role of cell cycle in mesoderm formation. To this end, using small molecules or conditional gene knockdown, we inhibited proteins controlling G1 and G2/M cell cycle phases during the differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into lateral plate, cardiac, and presomitic mesoderm. These loss-of-function experiments revealed that regulators of the G1 phase, such as cyclin-dependent kinases and pRb (retinoblastoma protein), are necessary for efficient mesoderm formation in a context-dependent manner. Further investigations disclosed that inhibition of the G2/M regulator cyclin-dependent kinase 1 decreases BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) signaling activity specifically during lateral plate mesoderm formation while reducing fibroblast growth factor/extracellular signaling-regulated kinase 1/2 activity in all mesoderm subtypes. Taken together, our findings reveal that cell cycle regulators direct mesoderm formation by controlling the activity of key developmental pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2973210360,"In all metazoan species, sperm is produced from germline stem cells. These self-renew and produce daughter cells that amplify and differentiate dependent on interactions with somatic support cells. In the male gonad of Drosophila melanogaster, the germline and somatic cyst cells co-differentiate as cysts, an arrangement in which the germline is completely enclosed by cytoplasmic extensions from the cyst cells. Notch is a developmentally relevant receptor in a pathway requiring immediate proximity with the signal sending cell. Here, we show that Notch is expressed in the cyst cells of wild-type testes. Notch becomes activated in the transition zone, an apical area of the testes in which the cyst cells express stage-specific transcription factors and the enclosed germline finalizes transit-amplifying divisions. Reducing the ligand Delta from the germline cells via RNA-Interference or reducing the receptor Notch from the cyst cells via CRISPR resulted in cell death concomitant with loss of germline cells from the transition zone. This shows that Notch signaling is essential for the survival of the germline stem cell lineage."

https://openalex.org/W2972576538,"Migration of cells from both local and systemic sources is essential for the inflammatory and regenerative processes that occur during normal wound healing. CXCL12 is considered a critical regulator of CXCR4-positive cell migration during tissue regeneration. In this study, we investigated the expression of Cxcl12 and Cxcr4 during healing of a murine full thickness ear wound. We also investigated the expression of angiopoietin-like 4, which has been shown to participate in wound angiogenesis and reepithelialization. At time points up to 48hrs, complete blood counts were performed using automated hematology analysis, and the numbers of circulating stem and progenitor cells quantified using flow cytometry. Expression of both Cxcr4 and Angptl4 was significantly elevated within 3 days of wounding, and both were strongly expressed in cells of the epidermis. ANGPTL4 protein expression remained elevated in the epithelium through day 14. Cxcl12 expression was increased significantly at day 3, and remained elevated through day 21. Faint Cxcl12 staining was detectable in the epithelium at day 1, and thereafter staining was faint and more generalized. There were significantly fewer circulating total white blood cells and lymphocytes 1hr following ear punching. Similarly, there was a significant early (1hr) reduction in the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells. Further studies are warranted to investigate whether ANGPTL4 and CXCL12/CXCR4 interact or synergize to facilitate cell recruitment and migration, and to potentiate reepithelialization and wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W2972772767,"Feed accounts for the greatest proportion of egg production costs and there is substantial variation in feed to egg conversion ratio (FCR) efficiency between individual hens. Despite this understanding, there is a paucity of information regarding layer hen feeding behaviour, diet selection and its impact on feed efficiency. It was hypothesised that variation in feed to egg conversion efficiency between hens may be influenced by feeding behaviour. For this experiment, two 35-bird groups of ISA Brown layers were selected from 450 individually caged hens at 25–30 weeks of age for either low FCR < 1.8 ± 0.02 (high feed efficiency (HFE) or high FCR > 2.1 ± 0.02 (low feed efficiency (LFE)). For each of these 70 hens, intake of an ad-libitum mash diet at 2-minute time intervals, 24 h a day, for 7 days was determined alongside behavioural assessment and estimation of the selection of components of the mash. The group selected for HFE had a lower feed intake, similar egg mass and associated lower FCR when compared with the LFE group. Whilst feed intake patterns were similar between HFE and LFE hens, there was a distinct intake pattern for all layer hens with intake rate increasing from 0300 to 1700 h with a sharp decline to 2200 h. High feed efficiency hens selected a diet with 25% more ash and 4% less gross energy than LFE hens. The LFE hens also spent more time eating with more walking events, but less time spent resting, drinking, preening and cage pecking events as compared with HFE hens. In summary, there was no contrasting diurnal pattern of feed consumption behaviour between the groups ranked on feed efficiency, however high feed efficiency hens consumed less feed and selected a diet with greater ash content and lower gross energy as compared with LFE hens. Our work is now focused on individual hen diet selection from mash diets with an aim of formulating precision, targeted diets for greater feed efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2972876448,"Background The eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) is a cytotoxic protein mainly secreted by eosinophils granulocytes and plays a role in host defense against parasitic infections. Infection with Necator americanus (hookworm) is traditionally diagnosed by the Kato-Katz method which is inherently tedious, subjective and known to underestimate infection intensity. This study aimed to assess levels of serum ECP in relation to hookworm infection intensity. Methods Stool samples from 984 (aged 4 to 80 years) participants in a cross-sectional study conducted in the Kintampo North Municipality of Ghana were examined using the Kato-Katz and formol-ether concentration methods. Serum ECP levels were measured by ECP assay kit and compared between 40 individuals infected with hookworm only, 63 with hookworm- Plasmodium falciparum co-infection, 59 with P. falciparum infection and 36 with no infection. Results Hookworm infection prevalence was 18.1% (178/984). ECP levels were significantly higher in individuals infected with hookworm only (β = 2.96, 95%CI = 2.69, 3.23, p<0.001) or co-infected with P. falciparum (β = 3.15, 95%CI = 2.91, 3.39, p<0.001) compared to the negative control. Levels of ECP were similar between those with only P. falciparum infection and the uninfected control (p>0.05). Increased hookworm intensity was associated with a significant increase in ECP level (β = 4.45, 95%CI = 2.25, 9.11, rs = 0.193, n = 103, p<0.01). ECP threshold of 84.98ng/ml was associated with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 98% (95% CI = 92, 100), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 76% (95% CI = 62, 87) in classifying hookworm infection status with an AUROC of 96.3%. Conclusion Serum ECP level may be a good biomarker of hookworm infection and intensity and warrant further investigations to help improve current hookworm diagnosis."

Genetic transformation was confirmed by epifluorescence and plagiotropic hairy root growth in absence of growth regulators. Cytotoxicity was determined using the sulforhodamine B method, and the production of podophyllotoxin (PTOX) was measured by high performance thin layer chromatography scanning. Through these methodologies, HsTD10 was identified as the hairy root line with the highest cytotoxicity and PTOX production, which was corroborated by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and micrOTOF-Q II. A suspension culture of HsTD10 was established in which PTOX and carbohydrate consumption during growth kinetics were quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Procedures to increase the production and retrieval of PTOX in the HsTD10 line included selection of culture medium, addition of thiamine, and modification of the PTOX extraction method. The best combination of these variables was MS medium at 75% of its components with the addition of 2 mg L-1 of thiamine, extraction with methanol-dichloromethane, and sonication at 40 ± 5°C. During kinetics, growth-associated PTOX accumulation was observed. The specific growth rate (μ) was 0.11 d-1. The highest concentration of PTOX obtained with HsTD10 (5.6 mg g-1 DW) was 100 times higher than that reported for roots of wild plants and 56 times higher than that for in vitro nontransformed roots of H. suaveolens."
https://openalex.org/W2973217798,"Current trends suggest that significant gender disparities exist within Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education at university, with female students being underrepresented in physics, but more equally represented in life sciences (e.g., biology, medicine). To understand these trends, it is important to consider the context in which students make decisions about which university courses to enrol in. The current study seeks to investigate gender differences in STEM through a unique approach that combines network analysis of student enrolment data with an interpretive lens based on the sociological theory of Pierre Bourdieu. We generate a network of courses taken by around 9000 undergraduate physics students (from 2009 to 2014) to quantify Bourdieu's concept of field. We explore the properties of this network to investigate gender differences in transverse movements (between different academic fields) and vertical movements (changes in students' achievement rankings within a field). Our findings indicate that female students are more likely to make transverse movements into life science fields. We also find that university physics does a poor job in attracting high achieving students, and especially high achieving female students. Of the students who do choose to study physics, low achieving female students are less likely to continue than their male counterparts. The results and implications are discussed in the context of Bourdieu's theory, and previous research. We argue that in order to remove constraints on female student's study choices, the field of physics needs to provide a culture in which all students feel like they belong."
https://openalex.org/W2972526339,"Background More than 11,000 laboratories and companies developed their own next-generation sequencing (NGS) for screening and diagnosis of various diseases including cancer. Although inconsistencies of mutation calls as high as 43% in databases such as GDSC (Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer) and CCLE (Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia) have been reported, not many studies on the reasons for the inconsistencies have been published. Methods: Targeted-NGS analysis of 151 genes in 35 cell lines common to GDSC and CCLE was performed, and the results were compared with those from GDSC and CCLE wherein whole-exome- or highly-multiplex NGS were employed. Results In the comparison, GDSC and CCLE had a high rate (40–45%) of false-negative (FN) errors which would lead to high rate of inconsistent mutation calls, suggesting that highly-multiplex NGS may have high rate of FN errors. We also posited the possibility that targeted NGS, especially for the detection of low-level cancer cells in cancer tissues might suffer significant FN errors. Conclusion FN errors may be the most important errors in NGS testing for cancer; their evaluation in laboratory-developed NGS tests is needed."
https://openalex.org/W2972603548,"The hierarchical modular organization of functional networks in the brain is crucial for supporting diverse cognitive functions. Functional disorders in the brain are associated with an abnormal hierarchical modular organization. The default mode network (DMN) is a complex dynamic network that is linked to specialized cognitive functions and clinically relevant information. In this study, we hypothesize that hierarchical functional segregation and integration of the DMN within attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is abnormal. We investigated topological metrics of both segregation and integration in different hierarchical subnetworks of the DMN between patients with ADHD and healthy controls. We found that the hierarchical functional integration and segregation of the DMN decreased and increased, respectively, in ADHD. Our results also indicated that the abnormalities in the DMN are intrinsically caused by changes in functional segregation and integration in its higher-level subnetworks. To better understand the temporally dynamic changes in the hierarchical functional integration and segregation of the DMN within ADHD, we further analyzed the dynamic transitions between functional segregation and integration. We found that the adaptive reorganizational ability of brain network states decreased in ADHD patients, which indicated less adaptive regulation between the DMN subnetworks in ADHD for supporting correspondingly normal cognitive function. From the perspective of hierarchical functional segregation and integration, our results further provide evidence to support dysfunctional brain cognitive functions within ADHD linked to brain network segregation and integration."
https://openalex.org/W2973071092,"Methylation patterns established and maintained at CpG sites may be altered by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within these sites and may affect the regulation of nearby genes. Our aims were to: 1) identify and generate a database of SNPs potentially subject to epigenetic control by DNA methylation via their involvement in creating, removing or displacing CpG sites (meSNPs), and; 2) investigate the association of these meSNPs with CpG islands (CGIs), and with methylation profiles of DNA extracted from tissues from cattle with divergent feed efficiencies detected using MIRA-Seq. Using the variant annotation for 56,969,697 SNPs identified in Run5 of the 1000 Bull Genomes Project and the UMD3.1.1 bovine reference genome sequence assembly, we identified and classified 12,836,763 meSNPs according to the nature of variation created at CpGs. The majority of the meSNPs were located in intergenic regions (68%) or introns (26.3%). We found an enrichment (p<0.01) of meSNPs located in CGIs relative to the genome as a whole, and also in differentially methylated sequences in tissues from animals divergent for feed efficiency. Seven meSNPs, located in differentially methylated regions, were fixed for methylation site creating (MSC) or destroying (MSD) alleles in the differentially methylated genomic sequences of animals differing in feed efficiency. These meSNPs may be mechanistically responsible for creating or deleting methylation targets responsible for the differential expression of genes underlying differences in feed efficiency. Our methyl SNP database (dbmeSNP) is useful for identifying potentially functional ""epigenetic polymorphisms"" underlying variation in bovine phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2973179166,"Ribosome profiling (ribo-seq) provides a means to analyze active translation by determining ribosome occupancy in a transcriptome-wide manner. The vast majority of ribosome protected fragments (RPFs) resides within the protein-coding sequence of mRNAs. However, commonly reads are also found within the transcript leader sequence (TLS) (aka 5’ untranslated region) preceding the main open reading frame (ORF), indicating the translation of regulatory upstream ORFs (uORFs). Here, we present a workflow for the identification of translation-regulatory uORFs. Specifically, uORF-Tools uses Ribo-TISH to identify uORFs within a given dataset and generates a uORF annotation file. In addition, a comprehensive human uORF annotation file, based on 35 ribo-seq files, is provided, which can serve as an alternative input file for the workflow. To assess the translation-regulatory activity of the uORFs, stimulus-induced changes in the ratio of the RPFs residing in the main ORFs relative to those found in the associated uORFs are determined. The resulting output file allows for the easy identification of candidate uORFs, which have translation-inhibitory effects on their associated main ORFs. uORF-Tools is available as a free and open Snakemake workflow at https://github.com/Biochemistry1-FFM/uORF-Tools. It is easily installed and all necessary tools are provided in a version-controlled manner, which also ensures lasting usability. uORF-Tools is designed for intuitive use and requires only limited computing times and resources."
https://openalex.org/W2972474335,"Background As a result of decades of effort by many investigators we now have an advanced level of understanding about several molecular systems involved in the control of gene expression. Examples include CpG islands, promoters, mRNA splicing and epigenetic signals. It is less clear, however, how such systems work together to integrate the functions of a living organism. Here I describe the results of a study to test the idea that a contribution might be made by focusing on genes specifically expressed in a particular tissue, the human testis. Experimental design A database of 239 testis-specific genes was accumulated and each was examined for the presence of features relevant to control of gene expression. These include: (1) the presence of a promoter, (2) the presence of a CpG island (CGI) within the promoter, (3) the presence in the promoter of a transcription factor binding site near the transcription start site, (4) the level of gene expression, and (5) the above features in genes of testis-specific cell types such as spermatocyte and spermatid that differ in their extent of differentiation. Results Of the 107 database genes with an annotated promoter, 56 were found to have one or more transcription factor binding sites near the transcription start site. Three of the binding sites observed, Pax-5, AP-2αA and GRα, stand out in abundance suggesting they may be involved in testis-specific gene expression. Compared to less differentiated testis-specific cells, genes of more differentiated cells were found to be (1) more likely to lack a CGI, (2) more likely to lack introns and (3) higher in expression level. The results suggest genes of more differentiated cells have a reduced need for CGI-based regulatory repression, reduced usage of gene splicing and a smaller set of expressed proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2972850228,"Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are small single strand non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level, either by translational inhibition or mRNA degradation based on the extent of complementarity between the miRNA and its target mRNAs. Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is the most important horticultural crop in Argentina. Achieving an integrated control of diseases is crucial for this crop, where frequent agrochemical applications, particularly fungicides, are carried out. A promising strategy is based on promoting induced resistance through the application of environmentally friendly compounds such as phosphites, inorganic salts of phosphorous acid. The use of phosphites in disease control management has proven to be effective. Although the mechanisms underlying their effect remain unclear, we postulated that miRNAs could be involved. Therefore we performed next generation sequencing (NGS) in potato leaves treated and non treated with potassium phosphite (KPhi). We identified 25 miRNAs that were expressed differentially, 14 already annotated in miRBase and 11 mapped to the potato genome as potential new miRNAs. A prediction of miRNA targets showed genes related to pathogen resistance, transcription factors, and oxidative stress. We also analyzed in silico stress and phytohormone responsive cis-acting elements on differentially expressed pre miRNAs. Despite the fact that some of the differentially expressed miRNAs have been already identified, this is to our knowledge the first report identifying miRNAs responsive to a biocompatible stress resistance inducer such as potassium phosphite, in plants. Further characterization of these miRNAs and their target genes might help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying KPhi-induced resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2972947847,"Introduction The primary rational for using mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to rejuvenate damaged tissue is mostly based on their capacity to trans-differentiate and repair injured organs. However, previous studies have demonstrated that MSCs are beneficial even at very early stages, before differentiation and proliferation can be expected. The aim of the current study was to investigate the multifaceted immunological effects of systemically administrating MSCs in the setting of acute kidney injury (AKI) induced by ischemic-reperfusion (I/R). Methods A rat model of I/R induced AKI was used. The rats underwent a unilateral nephrectomy with simultaneously clamping the contralateral kidney for 60 minutes. Four treatment groups received intravenously, increasing doses of human MSCs and after 48 hours, the rats were sacrificed. Blood was taken to evaluate renal functions and to measure systemic inflammatory markers. Kidneys were taken for histopathologic examinations and evaluations of intra-renal complement activation and inflammatory mediators. Results Renal functions improved in U shaped dose dependent manner. Mean serum creatinine levels were 4.5, 2.9, 2.6, 1.7 and 4.1 mg/dL in I/R + placebo, I/R + 150x103 cells, I/R + 250x103 cells, I/R + 500x103 cells and I/R + 1,000x103 cells respectfully (p-values<0.05). Urea demonstrated consistent results with the same U shape improvement manner. The extensive activation of the complement system was ameliorated in the MSCs treatment groups. In addition, MSCs significantly decreased intra-renal levels of IL-1β and TNF-α. It should be noted that the highest doses of MSCs induced renal hypoxia, marked by the Hypoxy-probe staining. Conclusions The early beneficial effect of MSCs in the setting of AKI may be attributed to their immunomodulatory effects. Safe treatment with MSCs can block the deleterious activation of the complement cascade and alleviate the hazardous inflammatory mediator-related cascade."

Methods Twenty-four SHR (aged 3 months) were allocated to 4 groups: sham+sedentary, sham+trained, MI+sedentary and MI+trained. MI was performed by permanent ligation of the coronary artery. Exercise training (treadmill) started 96 hours after MI and lasted for 4 weeks (~60% maximum effort, 4x/week and 40 min/day). Cardiac function (echocardiography), thioredoxin reductase (TRx), total carbonyl levels, among other oxidative stress markers and D3 activity were measured. A Generalized Estimating Equation was used, followed by Bonferroni’s test (p<0.05). Results MI resulted in an increase in left ventricular mass (p = 0.002) with decreased cardiac output (~22.0%, p = 0.047) and decreased ejection fraction (~41%, p = 0.008) as well as an increase in the carbonyl levels (p = 0.001) and D3 activity (~33%, p<0.001). Exercise training resulted in a decrease in left ventricular mass, restored cardiac output (~34%, p = 0.048) and ejection fraction (~20%, p = 0.040), increased TRx (~85%, p = 0.007) and reduced carbonyl levels (p<0.001) and D3 activity (p<0.001). Conclusions Our short-term exercise training helped reverse the effects of MI on cardiac function. These benefits seem to derive from a more efficient antioxidant response and lower D3 activity in cardiac tissue."

The concept of palliative care is increasingly accepted, but the impacts of different major illnesses, geographic regions, and health expenses on DNR rates remain unclear.This study utilized the two-million National Health Insurance (NHI) Research Database to examine the percentage of DNR rates among all deaths in hospitals from 2001 to 2011. DNR in the study was defined as no resuscitation before death in hospitals. Death records were extracted from the database and correlated with healthcare information. Descriptive statistics were compiled to examine the relationships between DNR rates and variables including major illnesses, geographic regions, and NHI spending.A total of 126,390 death records were extracted from the database for analysis. Among cancer-related deaths, pancreatic cancer patients had the highest DNR rate (86.99%) and esophageal cancer patients had the lowest DNR rate (71.62%). The higher DNR rate among cancer-only patients (79.53%) decreased with concomitant dialysis (66.07%) or ventilator use (57.85%). The lower DNR rates in patients with either chronic dialysis (51.27%) or ventilator use (59.10%) increased when patients experienced these two conditions concomitantly (61.31%). Although DNR rates have consistently increased over time across all regions of Taiwan, a persistent disparity was noted between the East and the South (76.89% vs. 70.78% in 2011, p < 0.01). After adjusting for potential confounders, DNR patients had significantly lower NHI spending one year prior to death ($67,553), compared with non-DNR patients.Our study found that DNR rates varied across cancer types and decreased in cancer patients with concomitant chronic dialysis or ventilator use. Disparities in DNR rates were evident across geographic regions in Taiwan. A wider adoption of the DNR policy may achieve substantial savings in health expenses and improve patients' quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W2972691920,"Shrimp trawlers in the Barents Sea use a Nordmøre sorting grid ahead of a small-mesh codend to avoid bycatch while catching shrimps efficiently. However, small fish can still pass through the grid to enter the codend, which increases their risk of being retained. In this study, we quantified the selectivity of a standard Nordmøre grid used together with one of two different codend designs, namely a diamond mesh codend with square mesh panels and a codend with a square mesh sorting cone section, for deep-water shrimp (Pandalus borealis), redfish (Sebastes spp.), and American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides). For the first time, the selective properties of these two alternative designs were estimated and compared to those of a Nordmøre grid used together with a 35-mm diamond mesh codend, which is the compulsory gear used in the fishery today. With this traditional codend, the size selectivity of both bycatch species showed the expected characteristic bell-shaped size selection pattern, with low retention probability of very small fish and bigger fish but with high retention probability of certain sizes of juveniles. Using the square mesh sorting cone significantly reduced the maximum retention risk of redfish. The maximum retention with the diamond mesh codend with square mesh panels was estimated to be 14% lower than that of the traditional codend, but the difference was not statistically significant. The two alternative codend designs did not result in any significant reduction in bycatch of American plaice."
https://openalex.org/W2973019651,"The homeostasis of most organelles requires membrane fusion mediated by soluble N -ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) attachment protein receptors (SNAREs). SNAREs undergo cycles of activation and deactivation as membranes move through the fusion cycle. At the top of the cycle, inactive cis-SNARE complexes on a single membrane are activated, or primed, by the hexameric ATPase associated with the diverse cellular activities (AAA+) protein, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF/Sec18), and its co-chaperone α-SNAP/Sec17. Sec18-mediated ATP hydrolysis drives the mechanical disassembly of SNAREs into individual coils, permitting a new cycle of fusion. Previously, we found that Sec18 monomers are sequestered away from SNAREs by binding phosphatidic acid (PA). Sec18 is released from the membrane when PA is hydrolyzed to diacylglycerol by the PA phosphatase Pah1. Although PA can inhibit SNARE priming, it binds other proteins and thus cannot be used as a specific tool to further probe Sec18 activity. Here, we report the discovery of a small-molecule compound, we call IPA (inhibitor of priming activity), that binds Sec18 with high affinity and blocks SNARE activation. We observed that IPA blocks SNARE priming and competes for PA binding to Sec18. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that IPA induces a more rigid NSF/Sec18 conformation, which potentially disables the flexibility required for Sec18 to bind to PA or to activate SNAREs. We also show that IPA more potently and specifically inhibits NSF/Sec18 activity than does N-ethylmaleimide, requiring the administration of only low micromolar concentrations of IPA, demonstrating that this compound could help to further elucidate SNARE-priming dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2972705255,"Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a chromatin binding complex that represses gene expression by methylating histone H3 at K27 to establish repressed chromatin domains. PRC2 can either regulate genes directly through the methyltransferase activity of its component EZH2 or indirectly by regulating other gene regulators. Gene expression analysis of glioblastoma (GBM) cells lacking EZH2 showed that PRC2 regulates hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). We found that PRC2 directly represses several ISGs and also indirectly activates a distinct set of ISGs. Assessment of EZH2 binding proximal to miRNAs showed that PRC2 directly represses miRNAs encoded in the chromosome 14 imprinted DLK1-DIO3 locus. We found that repression of this locus by PRC2 occurs in immortalized GBM-derived cell lines as well as in primary bulk tumors from GBM and anaplastic astrocytoma patients. Through repression of these miRNAs and several other miRNAs, PRC2 activates a set of ISGs that are targeted by these miRNAs. This PRC2-miRNA-ISG network is likely to be important in regulating gene expression programs in GBM."

In this study, we demonstrated that surfactin can increase the activity of amoxicillin against avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) in vitro with antimicrobial assays such as minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC). Additionally in the model of chick infection, surfactin exerted adjuvant effects with amoxicillin against APEC by lowering the numerical value of mortality and liver bacterial loads, and regulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines et al. We concluded that surfactin can act as a novel antimicrobial adjuvant with amoxicillin against AEPC infection in chicken."

This cohort study determined the clinical characteristics and outcome of asymptomatic patients with NTM-SPN after surgical resection. Resected SPNs with culture-positive for NTM in six hospitals in Taiwan during January, 2010 to January, 2017 were identified. Asymptomatic patients without a history of NTM-pulmonary disease (PD) or same NTM species isolated from the respiratory samples were selected. All were followed until May 1, 2019. A total of 43 patients with NTM-SPN were enrolled. Mycobacterium avium complex (60%) and M. kansasii (19%) were the most common species. The mean age was 61.7 ± 13.4. Of them, 60% were female and 4% had history of pulmonary tuberculosis. The NTM-SPN was removed by wedge resection in 38 (88%), lobectomy in 3 (7%) and segmentectomy in 2 (5%). Caseating granuloma was the most common histologic feature (58%), while chronic inflammation accounts for 23%. Mean duration of the follow-up was 5.2 ± 2.8 years (median: 4.2 years [2.5–7.0]), there were no mycobacteriology recurrence or NTM-PD development. In conclusion, surgical resection is likely to curative for incidentally discovered NTM-SPN in asymptomatic patients without culture evidence of the same NTM species from respiratory specimens, and routine mycobacterium culture for resected SPN might be necessary for differentiating pulmonary tuberculosis and NTM because further treatment differs."
https://openalex.org/W2972504170,"Gap junctions (GJs), which consist of proteins called connexins, are intercellular channels that allow the passage of ions, second messengers, and small molecules. GJs and connexins are considered as emerging therapeutic targets for various diseases. Previously, we screened numerous compounds using our recently developed iodide yellow fluorescent protein gap junctional intercellular communication (I-YFP GJIC) assay and found that flunarizine (FNZ), used for migraine prophylaxis and as an add-on therapy for epilepsy, inhibits GJIC in LN215 human glioma cells. In this study, we confirmed that FNZ inhibits GJIC using the I-YFP GJIC assay. We demonstrated that FNZ inhibits GJ activities via a mechanism that is independent of calcium channels and dopaminergic D2, histaminergic H1, or 5-HT receptors. In addition, we showed that FNZ significantly increases connexin 43 (Cx43) phosphorylation on the cell surface, but does not alter the total amount of Cx43. The beneficial effects of FNZ on migraines and epilepsy might be related to GJ inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2973125447,"Bloodstream infections (BSI) are associated with high mortality. Therefore, reliable methods of detection are of paramount importance. Efficient strategies to improve diagnostic yield of bacteraemia within the emergency department (ED) are needed. We conducted a retrospective analysis of all ED encounters in a high-volume, city-centre university hospital within Germany during a five-year study period from October 2013 to September 2018. A time-series analysis was conducted for all ED encounters in which blood cultures (BCs) were collected. BC detection rates and diagnostic yield of community-onset bacteraemia were compared during the study period (which included 45 months prior to the start of a new diagnostic Antibiotic Stewardship (ABS) bundle and 15 months following its implementation). BCs were obtained from 5,191 out of 66,879 ED admissions (7.8%). Bacteraemia was detected in 1,013 encounters (19.5% of encounters where BCs were obtained). The overall yield of true bacteraemia (defined as yielding clinically relevant pathogens) was 14.4%. The new ABS-related diagnostic protocol resulted in an increased number of hospitalised patients with BCs collected in the ED (18% compared to 12.3%) and a significant increase in patients with two or more BC sets taken (59% compared to 25.4%), which resulted in an improved detection rate of true bacteraemia (2.5% versus 1.8% of hospital admissions) without any decrease in diagnostic yield. This simultaneous increase in BC rates without degradation of yield was a valuable finding that indicated success of this strategy. Thus, implementation of the new diagnostic ABS bundle within the ED, which included the presence of a skilled infectious disease (ID) team focused on obtaining BCs, appeared to be a valuable tool for the accurate and timely detection of community-onset bacteraemia."
https://openalex.org/W2973169461,"Several proteins have been proposed as candidate auto-antigens in the pathogenesis of Behçet's disease (BD). In this study, we aimed to confirm the cellular responses to candidate peptide autoantigens with high affinity for the HLA-B*51:01 molecule using computerized binding predictions and molecular dynamics simulations. We identified two new candidate peptides (HSP65PD, derived from heat shock protein-65, and B51PD, derived from HLA-B*51:01) with high-affinity to the HLA-B*51:01 binding pocket using the Immune Epitope Database for Major Histocompatibility Complex-I Binding Prediction and molecular dynamics simulations. The peptide-induced proliferation of lymphocytes from patients with BD, sarcoidosis, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (VKH) with panuveitis, systemic scleroderma (SSc) without uveitis, and healthy controls (HC) was investigated using the bromodeoxyuridine assay. The proliferative response of leukocytes to HSP65PD was significantly higher in BD (SI 1.92 ± 0.65) than that in sarcoidosis (SI 1.38 ± 0.46), VKH (SI 1.40 ± 0.33), SSc (SI 1.32 ± 0.31), and HC (SI 1.27 ± 0.28) (P = 0.0004, P = 0.0007, P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001, respectively, Mann-Whitney's U-test). The proliferative response of leukocytes to B51PD was also higher in BD than that in sarcoidosis, VKH, SSc without uveitis, and HC, whereas no significant differences were observed among the five groups in response to a control peptide derived from topoisomerase 1. A significantly higher response to HPS65PD and B51PD was observed in the HLA-B*51:01-positive patients with BD than in the HLA-B*51:01-negative patients. In conclusion, two peptides that had high affinity to HLA-B*51:01 in computerized binding prediction showed significantly higher response in HLA-B*51:01-positive patients with BD, indicating the usefulness of computerized simulations for identifying autoreactive peptides to HLAs."
https://openalex.org/W2972418042,"Prions cause transmissible infectious diseases in humans and animals and have been found to be transmissible by blood transfusion even in the presymptomatic stage. However, the concentration of prions in body fluids such as blood and urine is extremely low; therefore, direct diagnostic tests on such specimens often yield false-negative results. Quantitative preanalytical prion enrichment may significantly improve the sensitivity of prion assays by concentrating trace amounts of prions from large volumes of body fluids. Here, we show that beads conjugated to positively charged peptoids not only captured PrP aggregates from plasma of prion-infected hamsters, but also adsorbed prion infectivity in both the symptomatic and preclinical stages of the disease. Bead absorbed prion infectivity efficiently transmitted disease to transgenic indicator mice. We found that the readout of the peptoid-based misfolded protein assay (MPA) correlates closely with prion infectivity in vivo, thereby validating the MPA as a simple, quantitative, and sensitive surrogate indicator of the presence of prions. The reliable and sensitive detection of prions in plasma will enable a wide variety of applications in basic prion research and diagnostics."
https://openalex.org/W2973226270,"Objectives To examine the morbidities associated with workplace injury and to explore how clinical variables modify the risk of injury recurrence. Methods A case-control study was designed using Florida's statewide inpatient, outpatient, and emergency visits data obtained from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. We included adults who were admitted for a workplace injury (WPI) or injury at other places (IOP), and a matched population of random controls without WPI/IOP. The associations between WPI and clinical morbidities were assessed by univariate and multivariable regression, ranking predictors by information gain, area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), and odds ratios. We analyzed WPI recurrence using survival methods (Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression, survival decision trees) and developed prediction models via regularized logistic regression, random forest, and AdTree. Performance was assessed by 10-fold cross-validation comparing AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, and Harrell's c-index. Results A total of 80,712 WPI, 161,424 IOP, and 161,424 control patients were included; 485 distinct clinical diagnostic and 160 procedure codes were analyzed after filtering. Acute bronchitis and bronchiolitis, sprains and strains of shoulder and upper arm, ankle and foot, or other and unspecified parts of back, accidents caused by cutting and piercing instruments or objects, and overexertion and strenuous movements were identified as important consequences of WPI. The prediction models of injury recurrence identified several key factors, such as insurance type and prior injury events, although none of the models exhibited high predictive performance (best AUROC = 0.60, best c-index = 0.62). Conclusions WPI is associated to diverse serious physical comorbidity burden. There are demographic, social and clinical comorbidity components associated to the risk of WPI recurrence, although their predictive value is moderate, which warrants future investigation in other information source domains, e.g. deepening into the environmental and societal sphere."
