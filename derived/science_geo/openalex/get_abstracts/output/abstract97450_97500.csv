https://openalex.org/W2078644893,"We have used two electron microscopic tracers, asialoorosomucoid covalently coupled to horseradish peroxidase (ASOR-HRP) and lactosaminated ferritin (Lac-Fer), to investigate the internalization of proteins bound by the asialoprotein receptor of rat hepatocytes. Both ligands are cleared rapidly from the circulation of rats, are retarded in their clearance by an excess of ASOR and accumulate principally in the liver. Morphological examination of the livers of rats after injection of the probes confirmed that the hepatocyte is the principal liver cell involved in the clearance of galactose-terminating proteins. Internalization occurred via coated pits and coated vesicles of 1000 A diameter. At 30 sec to 2 min the tracers began to accumulate in a complex arrangement of larger smooth-surfaced vesicles and tubular structures at the sinusoidal periphery of the cell. Fluid phase pinocytosis did not appear to account for any of the uptake into larger vesicles. The particulate tracer, Lac-Fer, was closely apposed to the membrane of coated pits and vesicles, but was found scattered throughout the lumen of the larger vesicles, possibly indicating dissociation of the ligand from its receptor. Although occasional lysosomes were detected cytochemically in the cell periphery, vesicles containing Lac-Fer showed no demonstrable aryl sulfatase activity. At 5 min, the tracers began to appear in Golgi-lysosome regions of the hepatocyte and were present in small vesicles of <2000 A in diameter, larger irregular vesicles and tubules. Serial sectioning indicated that tubular structures in Golgi-lysosome regions were often interconnected to the larger vesicles, but that tubules in the peripheral cytoplasm were only occasionally connected to larger structures. Some of the Lar-Fer-containing vesicles in Golgi-lysosome areas at 15 min after injection were found to contain aryl sulfatase reaction product, indicating fusion with lysosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2047343074,"The complete nucleotide sequence (8024 nucleotides) of the circular double-stranded DNA of cauliflower mosaic virus has been established. The DNA molecule is known to possess three discrete single-stranded discontinuities, often referred to as ""gaps,"" two in one strand and one in the other. The sequence data indicate that gap 1, the single discontinuity in the alpha strand, corresponds to the absence of no more than one or two nucleotides with respect to the complementary beta strand. The two discontinuities in the beta strand, however, are not authentic gaps since no nucleotides are missing, but are instead regions of sequence overlap: a short sequence (19 residues for gap 2, t least 2 residues for gap 3) at one terminus of each discontinuity, probably the 5' terminus, is displaced from the double helix by an identical sequence at the other boundary of the discontinuity. Analysis of the distribution of nonsense codons in the DNA sequence is consistent with other evidence that only the alpha strand is transcribed. The coding region extends around the circular molecule from 4 map units of gap 1, the map origin, to map position 91, and consists of six long open reading frames. Our findings suggest, but do not prove, that the DNA sequence of the open reading frames is colinear with viral protein sequences. The cistron for the viral coat protein, which is probably synthesized in the form of a precursor, has been situated in coding region IV on the basis of its unusual amino acid composition."
https://openalex.org/W2125723285,"By examining both the transformation efficiency of yeast of various plasmids containing defined regions of the 2 mu circle genome and the characteristics of the resultant transformants, we have identified several regions of the 2 mu circle genome which are involved in 2 mu circle replication or recombination. First, by identifying those DNA fragments from the molecule which promote high frequency transformation of yeast, we have localized the origin of replication to a sequence partially within the large unique region, which, as determined by subsequent deletion analysis, extends from the middle of the inverted repeat region into the contiguous unique region. Second, by examining the relative efficiency of replication in yeast of hybrid plasmids containing either the entire 2 mu circle genome or a fragment of 2 mu circle encompassing the origin of replication, we have determined that efficient use of the 2 mu circle origin requires some function or functions encoded in the molecule at a site away from the origin. Third, by examining the ability of a mutant 2 mu circle molecule to undergo intramolecular recombination in yeast, we have identified a 2 mu circle gene which codes for a product required for this process."

Interactions of fibronectin with Staphylococcus aureus via this fragment may be important for bacterial opsonization and attachment."
https://openalex.org/W1968277533,"We have obtained the complete sequence of cloned full-length DNA (NS DNA) derived from influenza virus gene 8, which codes for two unique polypeptides, NS1 and NS2, and the sequence of the NS2 mRNA. Previously we showed that the mRNA for NS1 (∼860 nucleotides) is colinear with the viral RNA and maps from 0.05−0.95 units of the cloned NS DNA, and the body of the NS2 mRNA (∼340 nucleotides) maps from 0.59−0.95 units, suggesting that the two mRNAs are 3′ co-terminal and share the same poly(A) addition site. Sequencing studies have shown that the NS2 mRNA contains an interrupted sequence of 473 nucleotides. The nucleotide sequences at the junctions of the interrupted segment are similar to those of the consensus sequences at the splicing sites of intervening regions in eucaryotic mRNAs. The first ∼56 virus-specific nucleotides at the 5′ end of the NS2 mRNA are the same nucleotides as are found at the 5′ end of the NS1 mRNA, and this leader sequence of the NS2 mRNA contains the initiation codon for protein synthesis and coding information for nine amino acids which would be common to NS1 and NS2. In addition, both mRNAs contain 10–20 heterogeneous nonviral nucleotides at their 5′ ends. The ∼340 nucleotide body region of the NS2 mRNA can be translated in the +1 reading frame, and the sequence indicates that NS1 and NS2 overlap by 70 amino acids that are translated from different reading frames."

Twenty-four hours after footshock stress, when concentrations had returned to baseline, increases in MHPG-SO4 and emotional behavior could be elicited by previously neutral environmental stimuli that had been paired with the stress."
https://openalex.org/W1996434467,"The hindlimb of the spinal frog produces a wiping reflex evoked by electrically or chemically stimulating distal skin of the forelimb. The reflex was released in frogs supported on a flat surface or suspended. It was found to have two stages. During the first, the frog fixed the hindlimb in an intermediate posture irrespective of forelimb position. In the second, the movement depended on forelimb position, which determined the final posture of the hindlimb. In this final posure, all joints except the hip joint were fully extended; the hip angle was correlated with forelimb position and varied on repeated wipings. When the stimulus was applied to the skin of the back, the pattern of final postures was the same, but the intermediate postures differed. The organization of the wiping reflex is discussed in light of the hypothesis that movement is evoked according to changes in the equilibrium (postural state) of the system."
https://openalex.org/W2016240281,"The complete nucleotide sequence of a human α-globin pseudogene (ψα1) is presented. Comparison of this sequence with a normal human α-globin gene (α2) reveals that ψα1 contains both an initiator codon mutation and frameshift deletions which would prevent the production of an α-globin polypeptide. ψα1 contains two intervening sequences with sizes and locations characteristic of mammalian α-globin genes. However, the alteration or absence of putative splicing sequences suggests that a primary transcript of ψα1 would not be processed to produce a mature mRNA. The relationship of ψα1 to the adjacent duplicated α-globin genes α1 and α2 has been investigated at the nucleotide sequence level. ψα1, α2 and α1 each possess the sequence GCCTGTGTGTGCCTG directly following their respective poly(A) addition sites. Sequence analysis of α2 and α1 3′ flanking regions further reveals that the α-globin gene duplication units are exactly bordered by this homologous sequence. We discuss the possible evolutionary origin of ψα1 and other globin pseudogenes in the context of globin gene duplication."
https://openalex.org/W2087939650,"We analyze the nucleosome core assembly reaction which is mediated in vitro by a protein previously purified from Xenopus laevis eggs, now named nucleoplasmin in reference to its occurrence in the soluble phase of the nucleus of a wide range of vertebrate cell types. Nucleoplasmin is present in solution as a pentamer. We use nuclease digestion analysis to show that the protein assembles bona fide nucleosome cores in vitro from purified histones and DNA. Nucleoplasmin itself binds neither to DNA nor to the nucleoprotein particles which it assembles in vitro. However, it interacts with histones in vitro in such a way that histones no longer adhere to negatively charged surfaces. We have found no evidence for sterically specific interactions with particular histones. The initial rate of the nucleosome core assembly reaction mediated by purified nucleoplasmin in vitro is essentially identical with the rate of the nucleosome assembly reaction which occurs in the cell-free extracts of Xenopus eggs from which nucleoplasmin was purified. This rate is sufficient to account for the rate of nucleosome assembly required during the early development of Xenopus embryos."
https://openalex.org/W1982513951,"Disagreements about the somatic risks from low doses of ionizing radiation stem from two difficulties fundamental to the logic of inference from observational data. First, precise direct estimation of small risks requires impracticably large samples. Second, precise estimates of low-dose risks based largely on high-dose data, for which the sample size requirements are more easily satisfied, must depend heavily on assumptions about the shape of the dose-response curve, even when only a few of the parameters of the theoretical form of the curve are unknown."
https://openalex.org/W2071089590,"Application of arachidonic acid or prostaglandin G(2) to the brain surface of anesthetized cats induced cerebral arteriolar damage. Scavengers of free oxygen radicals inhibited this damage. Prostaglandin H(2), prostaglandin E(2), and 11,14,17-eicosatrienoic acid did not produce arteriolar damage. It appears that increased prostaglandin synthesis produces cerebral vascular damage by generating free oxygen radicals."
https://openalex.org/W1987936529,"Two coronaviruses were isolated from brain material obtained at autopsy from two multiple sclerosis patients. The viruses were neutralized by serum and spinal fluid from these patients. Although most of the population have antibody to these virus isolates, multiple sclerosis patients have slightly higher concentrations of serum antibody than controls. The results suggest that coronaviruses should be considered as one additional virus with a potential implication in the etiology of multiple sclerosis."

The intracellular parasites from these infected cultures can be isolated with high recovery rate and purity by simple Percoll gradient centrifugation."
https://openalex.org/W2000215645,"We have identified the viral mRNAs present in cells in which protein synthesis has been stringently inhibited prior to infection with adenovirus type 2. These species presumably represent the subset of viral mRNAs that are ""immediate early"" products, requiring only host cell genes of their expression, and they do not include any of the conventionally recognized early mRNAs. Treatment of cells with 100 microM anisomycin inhibits 99.6% of protein synthesis and substantially depresses (by 20--200 fold) the levels of the conventional early mRNAs from regions E1A, E1B, E2, E3 and E4. Also depressed are species encoding an 87K protein (11.6--31.5 map units) and a 13.6K protein (encoded a short distance to the right of 21.5 map units). The only mRNAs not depressed by this treatment are an mRNA for a 13.5K protein encoded between 17.0 and 21.5 map units, and the mRNA for the late 52,55K protein encoded between 29 and 34 map units, which is also present in small amounts at early times. Further proof that production of the mRNA for the immediate early 13.5K protein is independent of E1A gene function is provided by the observation that it can be detected in cells infected with the E1A deletion mutant dl312."

https://openalex.org/W2079033684,"The ability to see spatial structures of a wide range of sizes was measured for two groups of observers (mean ages, 18 and 73 years). All observers had good visual acuity. Although older and younger observers did not differ in ability to see targets with fine structure (high spatial frequencies), older observers were only one-third as sensitive to targets with coarse structure (low spatial frequencies) as were younger observers. This difference cannot be attributed to ocular pathology in the older observers or to changes in criterion. Older observers were also less able than younger observers to see moving targets. The reduced sensitivity of the older observers may adversely affect routine perceptual activities, such as face recognition and visually guided postural behavior, that depend upon low spatial frequencies."
https://openalex.org/W1975838036,"Data from adoption studies on handedness indicate that the effects of shared biological heritage are more powerful determinants of hand preference than sociocultural factors. Biological offspring were found to show nonrandom distributions of right- and non-right-handedness as a function of parental handedness; these distributions were consistent with the results of previous family studies. In contrast, the handedness distribution of adopted children as a function of parental handedness was essentially random."
https://openalex.org/W2064909871,"Infants, aged 2 to 4 months, discriminated synthetic speech patterns that varied in duration of the formant transitions; this variation provides information sufficient to signal the phonetic distinction between a stop consonant and a semivowel in adult listeners. In addition, the discriminability of a given difference in transition duration was a function of both the particular stimulus values and the total duration of the syllable. This contextual effect occurred even though the information for syllable duration came after the transition information. The obtained pattern of discontinuous discriminability was in accord with perception that is relational and categorical."
https://openalex.org/W1999101011,"To determine the effect of cell cycle position on protein synthesis, synchronized cell populations were metabolically labeled and the synthesis of the basic proteins, including histones, was examined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Exponentially growing S49 mouse lymphoma or Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were separated into G1 and S phase populations by centrifugal elutriation, selective mitotic detachment, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, or a combination of these, and pulse-labeled with radiolabeled amino acids. The histone proteins, both free and chromatin-bound, were completely resolved from some 300 other basic polypeptides in whole-cell lysates by a modification of the NEPHGE technique of O'Farrell, Goodman and O'Farrell (1977). Comparisons of matched autoradiograms from samples of G1 and S phase labeled cells revealed an equivalent rate of histone synthesis through the cell cycle of both S49 and CHO cells. Nuclei isolated from G1 phase S49 cells that were pulse-labeled containing between 13 and 15% of the newly synthesized nucleosomal histones present in S phase nuclei. Nuclei prepared from G1 phase cells that were pulse-labeled and then chased for 5 hr contained more than 90% of the labeled nucleosomal histones present in whole-cell lysates. It therefore seems likely tha differential alterations in the rate of histone synthesis do not occur to a significant degree as cells proceed through the cycle, but the association of newly synthesized histones with DNA takes place after the onset of DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W2007230848,"To define the molecular lesion which causes decreased beta-globin synthesis in beta+ thalessemia, four patients of diverse ethnic origin were studied. Each had a 2--3 fold higher concentration of beta-globin mRNA precursor than that found in control bone marrow cells from patients with sickle cell anemia. Globin RNA metabolism was analyzed in two of these patients. Transcription of the beta-globin gene appeared to be normal, since analysis of nuclear RNA indicated that beta-globin mRNA synthesis exceeded that of alpha in a 2 hr pulse but the cytoplasm contained a relative deficiency of labeled beta-globin mRNA. An abnormal RNA species approximately 650 nucleotides in length, which contained sequences transcribed from both the large intron and coding portions of the beta-globin gene, was found in one patient's bone marrow cells. The second patient's cells contained a significant amount of a 1320 nucleotide RNA species, not initially evident in normal cells, from which part but not all of the large intervening sequence had been removed. Our data thus indicate that mutations which affect RNA processing cause beta thalessemia."
https://openalex.org/W2135371383,"Erythrophores isolated from the scales of the marine teleost, Holocentrus ascensionis (Osbeck), are capable of rapidly aggregating or dispersing numberous red pigment granules within their cytoplasm by translocating them along radial paths delineated by bundles of radially oriented microtubules. Pigment translocation is accompanied by transformations in the morphology of the cytoplasmic matrix, or microtrabecular lattice (MTL), in which the pigment granules are suspended. It appears that the MTL as a whole contracts toward the cell center during aggregation, carrying the pigment granules inward along with it, and is restructured during dispersion, using the radial microtubules as guides. We examined the energy requirements of pigment migration and the accompanying MTL transformations. Cellular ATP was depleted using the specific metabolic inhibitors 2,4 dinitrophenol, NaCN and oligomycin. All three of these drugs, which inhibit oxidative phosphorylation by different mechanisms, prevent both pigment dispersion and MTL transformation to dispersed morphology, while aggregation is unaffected. Inhibitor-treated cells recover normal pigment movements and MTL morphology when inhibitor is washed out of the cells with fresh medium. Potential energy apparently is stored in the MTL by some ATP-dependent process during dispersion and is converted to kinetic energy during aggregation. The results of this study strengthen the hypothesis that the MTL, working in concert with the radial microtubules, is the vehicle for pigment translocation in the erythrophore system."
https://openalex.org/W2010942063,"Sequence analysis of a Schizosaccharomyces pombe DNA fragment revealed two tRNA coding regions separated by a seven nucleotide spacer. the 5'-proximal tRNA gene encodes a tRNAUCGSer sequence, which is interrupted by a 16 nucleotide intron at the 3' side of the base adjacent to the anticodon. The second tRNA gene encodes an initiator tRNAMet sequence. This DNA fragment, cloned into pBR322, was used as template for in vitro transcription in a nuclear extract of Xenopus oocytes. The tRNA genes were transcribed into one RNA precursor which contained both tRNA sequences. The primary transcription product initiates with pppG, contains a 9 nucleotide leader sequence, a 16 nucleotide intron, a 7 nucleotide spacer between the two tRNA molecules and an 8--9 nucleotide trailer sequence. RNA initiation was only observed upstream of the 5'-proximal tRNASer. We used RNA analysis to establish a sequence of the enzymatic steps of tRNA maturation in the nuclear extract. The first step in processing the dimeric precursor is an endonuclease cleavage which generates the mature 5' end of the tRNAMet. Further steps include the removal of the flanking sequences and addition of the CCAOH 3' terminus. The last step is the splicing of the tRNASer precursor to remove the intervening sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1966381184,"Senescence in Podospora anserina has long been shown to be under cytoplasmic control. Comparison of DNAs isolated from young and senescent cultures made it possible to detect the presence, in senescent cultures only, of a specific DNA (SEN-DNA). This DNA consists of repeated sequences arranged in a multimeric set of circular molecules. In this study we have examined one particular SEN-DNA whose monomer unit is 6300 bp long. Using the Southern hybridization technique, we have demonstrated that this SEN-DNA results from the amplication of a sequence of the mitochondrial chromosome. This amplification, which resembles the process leading to rho- (""petite"") mutations in yeast, is discussed in relation to the determinism of senescence."
https://openalex.org/W2053206318,"The flavin adenine dinucleotide--dependent monooxygenase in mammalian hepatic microsomes plays a major role in the oxidative metabolism of thioether-containing pesticides. Thirty-four compounds were tested, and it was determined that organophosphorus insecticides such as disulfoton and phorate are rapidly oxidized by the purified enzyme to their corresponding sulfoxides. The enzyme does not catalyze the oxidation of the thiophosphoryl and thiol sulfur atoms of these or other phosphorothioates and phosphorodithioates, or the oxidation of the sulfoxide to the sulfone. Carbamates aldicarb and Croneton are also oxidized, but at a lower rate."
https://openalex.org/W2010310072,"Noradrenergic neurons in the hypothalamus involved in feeding and satiety are activated by gastrointestinal receptors. In the unrestrained rat, sites were first identified at which norepinephrine injected in the medial hypothalamus caused spontaneous feeding, or in the lateral hypothalamus caused no response. The activity of in vivo norepinephrine at these two sites was characterized by localized push-pull perfusion. When a nutrient was infused directly into the rat's duodenum, the synaptic release of hypothalamic norepinephrine was enhanced at lateral sites insensitive to norepinephrine, but suppressed at medial sites reactive to norepinephrine. Thus, signals from duodenal receptors are conceivably sent to the rat's brain to end feeding by way of noradrenergic inhibitory neurons in the hypothalamus."
https://openalex.org/W2021413120,"The growth of human cancer cells from lung, breast, and uterine tumors was selectively inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by ozone at 0.3 to 0.8 part per million of ozone in ambient air during 8 days of culture. Human lung diploid fibroblasts served as noncancerous control cells. The presence of ozone at 0.3 to 0.5 part per million inhibited cancer cell growth 40 and 60 percent, respectively. The noncancerous lung cells were unaffected at these levels. Exposure to ozone at 0.8 part per million inhibited cancer cell growth more than 90 percent and control cell growth less than 50 percent. Evidently, the mechanisms for defense against ozone damage are impaired in human cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2039142057,"We obtained influenza viral DNA clones containing sequences derived from cytoplasmic viral mRNA and genomic viral RNA. Sequence analysis of terminal nucleotides of five independentlyisolated viral DNA segments showed that additional oligonucleotides were covalently linked to the 5' terminus of viral mRNA transcripts. The sequences of these additional nucleotides varied among DNA clones of the same gene and of different genes as well. These inserts also varied in length, ranging from 6 to 14 nucleotides. The heterogeneity of these sequences suggests that they were derived originally from cellular RNA molecules. These findings provide evidence that cellular RNA sequences are used to prime influenza viral mRNA transcription in infected cells. In addition, the sequences at both termini of vRNA were fully represented in clone pFV 88, indicating that the cloned DNA contained the complete viral gene coding for the hemagglutinin."
https://openalex.org/W2009896119,"The detailed neurite morphologies of neuroblastoma cells can be specified by heritable information. This paper reports an investigation into how that information is stored. Cells with neurites are incubated with the microtubule-depolymerizing drug Nocodazole. The neurites retract and the cell bodies round up. The neurites reextend when the drug is removed. 58% of all cells recapitulate their original neurite morphology in detail. The same percentage of recapitulation is observed among a subset of the cells, about half the population, which move across the substratum during retraction and reextension. The results suggest that the storage of morphological determinants survives an interruption in their expression. In addition, reexpression of specific morphology does not require external cues or maintenance of the overall geometry of the cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2075704840,"We have investigated the organization of transcriptional units within a 9000 bp segment of the terminally repeated region of the DNA genome of vaccinia virus, which uses its own enzyme system to synthesize mRNA within the cytoplasm of infected cells. RNA splicing, which has been demonstrated for DNA viruses that replicate within the nucleus of infected cells, does not appear to be involved in the formation of these first vaccinia virus mRNAs to be examined. Three immediate early mRNAs, approximately 1050, 600 and 1100 nucleotides long, were mapped between 3.21 and 4.24, 6.54 and 7.16, and 7.20 and 8.23 kb from the end of the genome, respectively. The direction of transcription was toward the end of the genome for the two larger mRNAs and in the opposite direction for the smallest one. Additional minor RNAs, which were larger in size, were mapped between and to the same DNA strand as the mRNAs of 1050 and 1100 nucleotides. No evidence for interrupted genes was obtained by nuclease S1 analysis after hybridization of RNA to labeled DNA. In addition, the 5′ ends of the mRNAs, which were specifically labeled by in vitro capping, hybridized to DNA adjacent to the body of the message."
https://openalex.org/W2045125575,"In kidney proximal tubules of male mice the mitochondria are larger and more electron-lucent, autophagic vacuoles and lysosomes (predominantly myeloid bodies) more numerous and voluminous, and exocytosed intraluminal myeloid bodies more common than in females. Males also have higher kidney activities of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase and lysosomal hydrolases, and excrete larger quantities of hydrolases and protein in the urine. Orchiectomy evokes the feminine pattern whereas testosterone administration induces the male pattern. Endogenous testosterone modulates mitochondrial structure and function and enhances the activity of the lysosomal-vacuolar system in proximal tubule cells."
https://openalex.org/W1972528263,"We have induced teratocarcinomas from female embryos heterozygous for electrophoretic variants of the X-linked gene coding for phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK). An embryonal carcinoma cell line, P10, has been isolated from such a teratocarcinoma. It has a normal female karyotype and cultures contain both PGK isoenzymic forms. Clonal populations derived from P10 also contain both PGK electrophoretic variants. In addition, both X chromosomes in these cells replicate in synchrony with the autosomes during early S phase of the cell cycle. These data indicate that the undifferentiated P10 embryonal carcinoma cells contain two active X chromosomes. When cultured under the appropriate conditions, the P10 cells differentiate to form a variety of tissue types. At least some of these differentiated cells contain an inactive X chromosome as determined by cytogenetic analysis. Apparently X chromosome inactivation accompanies the differentiation of these female embryonal carcinoma cells."

https://openalex.org/W2051120159,"Normotensive anephric rats infused with 2 milliliters of a hyperosmolar solution of either sodium chloride or mannitol showed an increase in arterial pressure that was very pronounced with the sodium chloride and that could be partly abolished by administration of an antagonist to the vasopressor action of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Rats with congenital ADH deficiency subjected to the same treatment showed smaller increments in arterial pressure that remained unchanged after administration of the ADH antagonist. Expansion of intravascular fluid volume was similar in all four groups and bore no correlation to the change in arterial pressure. It is concluded that about half of the increase in blood pressure induced by saline was attributable to the vasopressor effect of stimulated ADH and the remainder to an additional sodium-related factor, since it was more pronounced in the saline-infused than in the mannitol-infused groups. Expansion of the intravascular volume per se could only account for a minimal part of the increment in pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2028292452,"The lipid-linked and asparagine-linked oligosaccharides of two lectin-resistant and one parental Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line have been compared by glycosidase digestion and gel filtration analysis of radiolabeled glycopeptides and oligosaccharides. The additional glycosylation defect in a double mutant cell line (CHO-PhaRConAR) selected from a phytohemagglutinin-resistant single mutant cell line (CHO-PhaR) for resistance to concanavalin A has been identified as a block in the synthesis of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide precursor, resulting in a structure with seven instead of the normal nine mannose units. Both the CHO-PhaRConAR and CHO-PhaR cells were completely blocked in the synthesis of complex, acidic type oligosaccharides because of a previously demonstrated deficiency in a particular N-acetylglucosamine transferase activity.
