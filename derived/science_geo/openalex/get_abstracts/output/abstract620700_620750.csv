https://openalex.org/W2897416697,"Sustainably feeding the next generation is often described as one of the most pressing ""grand challenges"" facing the 21st century. Generally, scholars propose addressing this problem by increasing agricultural production, investing in technology to boost yields, changing diets, or reducing food waste. In this paper, we explore whether global food production is nutritionally balanced by comparing the diet that nutritionists recommend versus global agricultural production statistics. Results show that the global agricultural system currently overproduces grains, fats, and sugars while production of fruits and vegetables and protein is not sufficient to meet the nutritional needs of the current population. Correcting this imbalance could reduce the amount of arable land used by agriculture by 51 million ha globally but would increase total land used for agriculture by 407 million ha and increase greenhouse gas emissions. For a growing population, our calculations suggest that the only way to eat a nutritionally balanced diet, save land and reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to consume and produce more fruits and vegetables as well as transition to diets higher in plant-based protein. Such a move will help protect habitats and help meet the Sustainable Development Goals."

https://openalex.org/W2810388658,"The polyomavirus family currently includes thirteen human polyomavirus (HPyV) species. In immunocompromised and elderly persons HPyVs are known to cause disease, such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (JCPyV), haemorrhagic cystitis and nephropathy (BKPyV), Merkel cell carcinoma (MCPyV), and trichodysplasia spinulosa (TSPyV). Some recently discovered polyomaviruses are of still unknown prevalence and pathogenic potential. Because HPyVs infections persist and might be transferred by blood components to immunocompromised patients, we studied the seroprevalence of fourteen polyomaviruses in adult Dutch blood donors. For most polyomaviruses the observed seroprevalence was high (60–100%), sometimes slightly increasing or decreasing with age. Seroreactivity increased with age for JCPyV, HPyV6 and HPyV7 and decreased for BKPyV and TSPyV. The most recently identified polyomaviruses HPyV12, NJPyV and LIPyV showed low overall seroprevalence (~5%) and low seroreactivity, questioning their human tropism. Altogether, HPyV infections are common in Dutch blood donors, with an average of nine polyomaviruses per subject."
https://openalex.org/W2896848238,"TP53 (which encodes p53) is one of the most frequently mutated genes in cancers. In this study, we generated TP53-mutant pigs by gene editing via electroporation of the Cas9 protein (GEEP), a process that involves introducing the Cas9 protein and single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting exon 3 and intron 4 of TP53 into in vitro-fertilized zygotes. Zygotes modified by the sgRNAs were transferred to recipients, two of which gave birth to a total of 11 piglets. Of those 11 piglets, 9 survived. Molecular genetic analysis confirmed that 6 of 9 live piglets carried mutations in TP53, including 2 piglets with no wild-type (WT) sequences and 4 genetically mosaic piglets with WT sequences. One mosaic piglet had 142 and 151 bp deletions caused by a combination of the two sgRNAs. These piglets were continually monitored for 16 months and three of the genome-edited pigs (50%) exhibited various tumor phenotypes that we presumed were caused by TP53 mutations. Two mutant pigs with no WT sequences developed mandibular osteosarcoma and nephroblastoma. The mosaic pig with a deletion between targeting sites of two sgRNAs exhibited malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Tumor phenotypes of TP53 mosaic mutant pigs have not been previously reported. Our results indicated that the mutations caused by gene editing successfully induced tumor phenotypes in both TP53 mosaic- and bi-allelic mutant pigs."
https://openalex.org/W2896664589,"Recent studies suggest that peroxiredoxin1/2 (Prx1/2) may be involved in the pathophysiology of postischemic inflammatory responses in the brain. In this study, we assessed the distribution and function of Prx1/2 in mice after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). We investigated the distribution of Prx1/2 in the brains of mice both in vivo and in vitro using immunofluorescence staining. The expression of Prx1/2 after SAH was determined by Western blot. Adenanthin was used to inhibit Prx1/2 function, and Prx1/2 overexpression was achieved by injecting adeno-associated virus. Oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis were assessed both in vivo and in vitro. The neurologic function, inflammatory response, and related cellular signals were analyzed. The results showed that Prx1 was mainly expressed in astrocytes, and Prx2 was abundant in neurons. The expression of Prx1/2 was elevated after SAH, and their expression levels peaked before proinflammatory cytokines. Inhibiting Prx1/2 promoted neuronal apoptosis by increasing the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels via the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1/p38 pathway. By contrast, overexpression of Prx1/2 attenuated oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis after SAH. Thus, early expression of Prx1/2 may protect the brain from oxidative damage after SAH and may provide a novel target for treating SAH.-Lu, Y., Zhang, X.-S., Zhou, X.-M., Gao, Y.-Y., Chen, C.-L., Liu, J.-P., Ye, Z.-N., Zhang, Z.-H., Wu, L.-Y., Li, W., Hang, C.-H.

https://openalex.org/W2897268237,"In a mass casualty incident, the factors that determine the survival rate of injured patients are diverse, but one of the key factors is the time for triage. Additionally, the main factor that determines the time of triage is the number of medical personnel. However, when relying on a small number of medical personnel, the ability to increase survivability is limited. Therefore, developing a classification model for survival prediction that can quickly and precisely triage via wearable devices without medical personnel is important. In this study, we designed a consciousness index to substitute the factor by manpower and improved the classification accuracy by applying a machine learning algorithm. First, logistic regression analysis using vital signs and a consciousness index capable of remote monitoring through wearable devices confirmed the high efficiency of the consciousness index. We then developed a classification model with high accuracy which corresponds to existing injury severity scoring systems through the machine learning algorithms. We extracted 460,865 cases which met our criteria for developing the survival prediction from the national sample project in the national trauma databank which contains 408,316 cases of blunt injury and 52,549 cases of penetrating injury. Among the dataset, 17,918 (3.9%) cases died while the other survived. The AUCs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the different models with the proposed simplified consciousness score as follows: RTS (as baseline), 0.78 (95% CI = 0.775 to 0.785); logistic regression, 0.87 (95% CI = 0.862 to 0.870); random forest, 0.87 (95% CI = 0.862 to 0.872); deep neural network, 0.89 (95% CI = 0.882 to 0.890). As a result, we confirmed the possibility of remote triage using a wearable device. It is expected that the time required for triage can be effectively reduced by using the developed classification model of survival prediction."

Study 205891 (previously AI468038) investigated the efficacy, safety, and dose response of GSK3532795 in treatment-naive, HIV-1-infected participants. Study 205891 (NCT02415595) was a Phase IIb, randomized, active-controlled, double-blind, international trial. Participants were randomized 1:1:1:1 to one of three GSK3532795 arms at doses 60 mg, 120 mg or 180 mg once daily (QD), or to efavirenz (EFV) at 600 mg QD, each in combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) (300/200 mg QD). Primary endpoint was proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL at Week 24. Between May 2015 and May 2016, 206 participants received treatment. At Week 24, 76–83% participants receiving GSK3532795 and 77% receiving EFV achieved HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL. Fifteen participants receiving GSK3532795 and one receiving EFV met resistance testing criteria; 10/15 receiving GSK3532795 had emergent substitutions at reverse transcriptase positions M184, and one at position K65, while the participant receiving EFV did not have any nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)/non-NRTI mutations. EFV, relative to GSK3532795, had more serious adverse events (9% versus 5%) and adverse events leading to discontinuation (17% versus 5%). However, 3–4-fold higher rates of gastrointestinal adverse events were observed with GSK3532795 relative to EFV. GSK3532795 combined with TDF/FTC is efficacious with 24 weeks of therapy. However, GSK3532795 showed a higher rate of gastrointestinal intolerability and treatment-emergent resistance to the NRTI backbone relative to EFV.

https://openalex.org/W2895826243,"Exploiting the biodiversity of crops and their wild relatives is fundamental for maintaining and increasing food security. The species Cynara cardunculus includes three taxa: the globe artichoke, one of the most important Mediterranean vegetables, the leafy cardoon, and the wild cardoon. In this study, genotyping by sequencing (GBS) was successfully applied to reveal thousands of polymorphisms in a C. cardunculus germplasm collection, including 65 globe artichoke, 9 leafy cardoon, and 21 wild cardoon samples. The collection showed a strong population structure at K = 2, separating the globe artichoke from the leafy and wild cardoon. At higher K values, further substructures were observed, in which the wild cardoon was separated from the leafy cardoon, and the latter included the Spanish wild cardoons, while the wild sample from Portugal was admixed. Moreover, subpopulations within the globe artichoke set were highlighted. Structure analysis restricted to the globe artichoke dataset pointed out genetic differentiation between the ˝Catanesi˝ typology and all the other samples (K = 2). At higher values of K, the separation of the ˝Catanesi˝ group still held true, and green headed landraces from Apulia region, Italy (˝Green Apulian˝) formed a distinct subpopulation. ˝Romaneschi˝ artichoke types fell in a variable group with admixed samples, indicating that they should not be considered as a genetically uniform typology. The results of principal component analysis and Neighbor-Joining hierarchical clustering were consistent with structure results, and in addition provided a measure of genetic relationships among individual genotypes. Both analyses attributed the wild material from Spain and Portugal to the cultivated cardoon group, supporting the idea that this might be indeed a feral form of the leafy cardoon. Different reproductive habit and possibly selective pressure led to a slower LD decay in artichoke compared to cardoon. Genotyping by sequencing has proven a reliable methodology to obtain valuable SNPs and assess population genetics in C. cardunculus."
https://openalex.org/W2896137296,"Recent studies have demonstrated an effect of neurotrophins, particularly brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), on airway contractility [via increased airway smooth muscle (ASM) intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i] and remodeling (ASM proliferation and extracellular matrix formation) in the context of airway disease. In the present study, we examined the role of BDNF in allergen-induced airway inflammation using 2 transgenic models: 1) tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) conditional knockin (TrkBKI) mice allowing for inducible, reversible disruption of BDNF receptor kinase activity by administration of 1NMPP1, a PP1 derivative, and 2) smooth muscle-specific BDNF knockout (BDNFfl/fl/SMMHCllCre/0) mice. Adult mice were intranasally challenged with PBS or mixed allergen (Altemaria alternata, Aspergillus fumigatus, house dust mite, and ovalbumin) for 4 wk. Our data show that administration of 1NMPP1 in TrkBKI mice during the 4-wk allergen challenge blunted airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) and reduced fibronectin mRNA expression in ASM layers but did not reduce inflammation per se. Smooth muscle-specific deletion of BDNF reduced AHR and blunted airway fibrosis but did not significantly alter airway inflammation. Together, our novel data indicate that TrkB signaling is a key modulator of AHR and that smooth muscle-derived BDNF mediates these effects during allergic airway inflammation.—Britt, R.

https://openalex.org/W2895969107,"Background Sedentary behavior is thought to pose different risks to those attributable to physical inactivity. However, few studies have examined the association between physical activity and sitting time with cancer incidence within the same population. Methods We followed 38,154 healthy Norwegian adults in the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT) for cancer incidence from 1995–97 to 2014. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate risk of site-specific and total cancer incidence by baseline sitting time and physical activity. Results During the 16-years follow-up, 4,196 (11%) persons were diagnosed with cancer. We found no evidence that people who had prolonged sitting per day or had low levels of physical activity had an increased risk of total cancer incidence, compared to those who had low sitting time and were physically active. In the multivariate model, sitting ≥8 h/day was associated with 22% (95% CI, 1.05–1.42) higher risk of prostate cancer compared to sitting <8 h/day. Further, men with low physical activity (≤8.3 MET-h/week) had 31% (95% CI, 1.00–1.70) increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and 45% (95% CI, 1.01–2.09) increased risk of lung cancer compared to participants with a high physical activity (>16.6 MET-h/week). The joint effects of physical activity and sitting time the indicated that prolonged sitting time increased the risk of CRC independent of physical activity in men. Conclusions Our findings suggest that prolonged sitting and low physical activity are positively associated with colorectal-, prostate- and lung cancer among men. Sitting time and physical activity were not associated with cancer incidence among women. The findings emphasizing the importance of reducing sitting time and increasing physical activity."
https://openalex.org/W2896549747,"Introduction Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement gene testing is used increasingly to identify patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are most likely to benefit from crizotinib. This study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the ALK tests followed by crizotinib compared to the standard chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC from the Chinese healthcare system perspective. Methods A 10-year Markov model was constructed to compare the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of crizotinib with standard chemotherapy, guided by the ALK rearrangement tests: next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel tests and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. The health states included progression-free survival (PFS), progressed survival, and death. The costs examined included cost of drugs (pemetrexed, standard chemotherapy, salvage chemotherapy, and crizotinib), follow-up, palliative care, supportive care, severe adverse events, and ALK rearrangement testing. Results Under Patient Assistance Program (PAP), the model demonstrated that the patients using NGS panel tests spent US $31,388 and gained 0.780 QALYs, whereas patients using multiplex PCR spent US $31,362 and gained 0.780 QALYs, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of crizotinib with PAP compared to the control strategy were projected at $14,384 (NGS) and $13,740 (multiplex PCR) per QALY gained, respectively. Sensitivity analyses showed the utility of PFS and the costs of crizotinib and pemetrexed were the most impactful factors on the model outcomes. The results were robust to changes in all parameters. Conclusion ALK-rearrangement test positive followed by crizotinib may be cost-effective compared to standard chemotherapy from the Chinese healthcare system perspective when PAP was available."
https://openalex.org/W2897505982,"Whereas poor maternal nutritional status before and during pregnancy is widely associated with adverse birth outcomes, studies quantifying this association in low income countries are scarce. We examined whether maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and weight gain during pregnancy are associated with birth outcomes in rural Malawi.We analyzed the associations between pre-pregnancy BMI and average weekly gestational weight gain (WWG) and birth outcomes [duration of gestation, birth weight, length-for-age z-score (LAZ), and head circumference-for-age z-score (HCZ)]. We also determined whether women with low or high pre-pregnancy BMI or women with inadequate or excessive WWG were at increased risk of adverse birth outcomes.The analyses included 1287 women with a mean BMI of 21.8 kg/m2, of whom 5.9% were underweight (< 18.5 kg/m2), 10.9% were overweight (≥ 25 kg/m2), 71.8% had low WWG [below the lower limit of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendation], and 5.2% had high WWG (above IOM recommendation). In adjusted models, pre-pregnancy BMI was not associated with duration of pregnancy (p = 0.926), but was positively associated with birth weight and HCZ (<0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively). WWG was positively associated with duration of gestation (p = 0.031), birth weight (p<0.001), LAZ (p<0.001), and HCZ (p<0.001). Compared to normal weight women, underweight women were at increased risk of having stunted infants (p = 0.029). Women with low WWG were at increased risk of having infants with low birth weight (p = 0.006) and small head circumference (p = 0.024) compared to those with normal weight gain. Those with high BMI or high WWG were not at increased risk of adverse birth outcomes.WWG is an important predictor of birth outcomes in rural Malawi. The high prevalence of inadequate WWG compared to low pre-pregnancy BMI highlights the need to investigate causes of inadequate weight gain in this region."

Molecular markers associated with traits of these leaves should be helpful for the high-yielding breeding. In this study, 1366 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) markers covering the whole genome of durum wheat were used to genotype 150 cultivars collected from 46 countries and regions in the world. Leaf length, leaf width and chlorophyll content of the top three leaves were measured, respectively, in three consecutive years. Association analyses were performed on the leaf traits and SNP markers. A total of 120 SNP marker associations were detected on 13 of the 14 chromosomes. Among these markers, 83 were associated with the canopy leaf traits, 10 with 1000-grain weight, and 29 with kernel number per spike. This study is helpful for better understanding the potential and genetic basis of functional leaves, and facilitates pyramiding of the favorable alleles using marker assisted selection for ideal plant-type and high photosynthesis efficiency in durum wheat breeding."
https://openalex.org/W2897420401,"The possibility that oxidative stress promotes degradation of the extracellular matrix and a relationship between intraluminal thrombus (ILT) thickness and proteolytic activity within the abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) wall has been suggested. In the present study, the hypothesis that thin ILT is correlated with an increase in oxidative stress-related enzymes and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression within the human AAA wall was investigated. We also studied the antioxidant activity of superoxide dismutases, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and thioredoxin within the full-thickness AAA wall and through fluoroimmunohistochemical staining of catalase and MMP-9 expression within the inner and outer media, in relation to ILT thickness. Reactive oxygen species control the degradation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix by up-regulating proteolytic enzymes, such as MMPs. Results showed that oxidative stress and proteolytic enzyme expression were simultaneously, significantly higher within thin thrombus (≤10 mm)-covered aneurysm wall when compared with the wall covered by thick thrombus (≥25 mm). These findings provide the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of a causative link between oxidative stress instigating proteolytic enzyme expression at the tissue level and human AAA development. Presence of a thin circumferential thrombus should always be considered as a risk factor for the greatest increase in aneurysm growth rate and rupture, giving an indication for surgery timing.-Wiernicki, I., Parafiniuk, M., Kolasa-Wołosiuk, A., Gutowska, I., Kazimierczak, A., Clark, J., Baranowska-Bosiacka, I., Szumilowicz, P., Gutowski, P.

https://openalex.org/W2896355996,"Blueberry is a small fruit crop which includes a complex group of different Vaccinium species of various ploidy levels. Commercial blueberries have been grown in Europe most recently, so there is not much information available about their adaptation into new regions. In this work we investigated adaptation to the environmental conditions of northern Spain, in terms of flowering and ripening seasons, of a set of 70 blueberry cultivars including several of the most important cultivated American species (V. corymbosum, V. virgatum, V. macrocarpon and V. uliginosum) in order to identify which types are best-suited in this geographical area of Europe. Most materials showed high chilling requirements for flowering under local conditions, while materials with low-chilling requirements showed problems in the maturation process of the flowers. Most cultivars were early or mid-season while a relative lack of late-season cultivars was observed. GBS was used for the analysis of genetic diversity in this sample of 70 cultivars. A total of 5255 SNP markers were obtained and a cluster analysis revealed three main groups associated with the ploidy level of the species. A Principal Component Analysis revealed a grouping of the V. corymbosum cultivars according to their chilling requirements. A total of 29 SNPs were identified as being highly informative for diversity analysis and potentially useful for cultivar identification and for breeding purposes. The results obtained from this research should contribute to the expansion of this crop, as well as providing data about genetic diversity useful for the preservation of genetic resources or for future breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2898408336,"SEC2, a major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II)-dependent T-cell mitogen, binds MHC II and T-cell receptor (TCR) Vβs to induce effective co-stimulating signals for clonal T-cell expansion. We previously characterized a SEC2 mutant with increased recognition of TCR Vβs, ST-4, which could intensify NF-κB signaling transduction, leading to IL-2 production and T-cell activation. In this study, we found that in contrast to SEC2, ST-4 could induce murine CD4+ T-cell proliferation in a Vβ8.2- and Vβ8.3-specific manner in the absence of MHC II+ antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Furthermore, although IL-2 secretion in response to either SEC2 or ST-4 stimulation was accompanied by up-regulation of protein kinase Cθ (PKCθ), inhibitor of κB (IκB), α and β IκB kinase (IKKα/β), IκBα, and NF-κB in mouse splenocytes, only ST-4 could activate CD4+ T cells in the absence of MHC II+ APCs through the PKCθ/NF-κB signaling pathway. The PKCθ inhibitor AEB071 significantly suppressed SEC2/ST-4–induced T-cell proliferation, CD69 and CD25 expression, and IL-2 secretion with or without MHC II+ APCs. Further, SEC2/ST-4–induced changes in PKCθ/NF-κB signaling were significantly relieved by AEB071 in a dose-dependent manner. Using Lck siRNA, we found that Lck controlled SEC2/ST-4–induced phosphorylation of PKCθ. We also demonstrated that the IL-2R/STAT5 pathway is essential for SEC2/ST-4–induced T-cell activation. Collectively, our data demonstrate that an enhanced ST-4–TCR interaction can compensate for lack of MHC II and stimulate MHC II–free CD4+ T-cell proliferation via PKCθ/NF-κB and IL-2R/STAT5 signaling pathways. Compared with SEC2, intensified PKCθ/NF-κB and IL-2R/STAT5 signals induced by ST-4 lead to enhanced T-cell activation.

The therapeutic effect of ADC is significantly affected by its bioproduction process. This study aims to develop an effective ADC production process using anti-HER2 mAb-drug as a model therapeutic. First, a high titer (>2 g/L) of mAb was produced by Chinese hamster ovary cells from fed-batch cell culture. Both live-cell confocal microscopy imaging and flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that the produced mAb and ADC had strong and specific binding to HER2+ cell line BT474. Second, various conjugation conditions of mAb and drug, including linker selection, ratio of drug and mAb, and conjugation approaches, were investigated to improve the production yield and product quality. Finally, the ADC structure and biological quality were evaluated by SDS-PAGE and anti-breast cancer toxicity study, respectively. The ADC with integral molecular structure and high cytotoxicity (IC50 of 1.95 nM) was produced using the optimized production process.

https://openalex.org/W2896661923,"The Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) has been widely used to investigate the perception of the bodily self. Commonly used measures of the illusion are self-report questionnaires and proprioceptive drift of the participants’ hands towards the rubber hand. Recent studies have shown that these measures can be dissociated, suggesting they may arise from distinct mechanisms. In previous studies using questionnaires, participants were asked to base responses on their subjective feelings of body ownership, rather than their beliefs. This makes sense given the obvious fact that whereas participants may feel like the rubber hand is part of their body, they do not believe that it is. It is not clear, however, whether a similar dissociation between feelings and beliefs also exists for proprioceptive drift. Here, we investigated the presence of a dissociation between feeling and belief in the context of the RHI. When participants reported their feelings there was an increase both in the sense of body ownership over the fake hand as well as in the proprioceptive drift, compared to when they reported their beliefs. Strikingly, unlike the sense of ownership, proprioceptive drift was unaffected by the synchrony of stimulation. This may be an important way in which the two measures of the RHI differ."
https://openalex.org/W2896842156,"Organizational processes vary. Practitioners have developed simple frameworks to differentiate them. Surprisingly, the academic literature on process management does not-it typically strives for one method to manage all processes. We draw on organizational information-processing theory to systematically develop a new, theoretically motivated classification model for organizational processes. We validate this model using survey data from 141 process practitioners of a global corporation. We derive three distinct types of processes and demonstrate that an understanding of process variety based on process dimensions can differentiate processes better than existing frameworks used in practice. Our findings can enable process managers to make informed decisions and serve as a basis for contingent process management."
https://openalex.org/W2897845851,"Most glycosyltransferases, including B4GalT1 (EC 2.4.1.38), are known to assemble into enzyme homomers and functionally relevant heteromers in vivo. However, it remains unclear why and how these enzymes interact at the molecular/atomic level. Here, we solved the crystal structure of the wild-type human B4GalT1 homodimer. We also show that B4GalT1 exists in a dynamic equilibrium between monomer and dimer, since a purified monomer reappears as a mixture of both and as we obtained crystal forms of the monomer and dimer assemblies in the same crystallization conditions. These two crystal forms revealed the unliganded B4GalT1 in both the open and the closed conformation of the Trp loop and the lid regions, responsible for donor and acceptor substrate binding, respectively. The present structures also show the lid region in full in an open conformation, as well as a new conformation for the GlcNAc acceptor loop (residues 272-288). The physiological relevance of the homodimer in the crystal was validated by targeted mutagenesis studies coupled with FRET assays. These showed that changing key catalytic amino acids impaired homomer formation in vivo. The wild-type human B4GalT1 structure also explains why the variant proteins used for crystallization in earlier studies failed to reveal the homodimers described in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2896319870,"Background The current classification of human lung adenocarcinoma defines five different histological growth patterns within the group of conventional invasive adenocarcinomas. The five growth patterns are characterised by their typical architecture, but also by variable tumor biological behaviour. Aims The aim of this study was to identify specific gene signatures of the five adenocarcinoma growth patterns defined by the joint IASLC/ATS/ERS working group. Methods Total RNA from microdissected adenocarcinoma tissue samples of ten lepidic, ten acinar, ten solid, nine papillary, and nine micropapillary tumor portions was isolated and prepared for gene expression analysis. Differential expression of genes was determined using the R package “LIMMA”. The overall significance of each signature was assessed via global test. Gene ontology statistics were analysed using GOstat. For immunohistochemical validation, tissue specimens from 20 tumors with solid and 20 tumors with lepidic growth pattern were used. Results Microarray analyses between the growth patterns resulted in numerous differentially expressed genes between the solid architecture and other patterns. The comparison of transcriptomic activity in the solid and lepidic patterns revealed 705 up- and 110 downregulated non-redundant genes. The pattern-specific protein expression of Inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate-kinase-A (ITPKA) and angiogenin by immunohistochemistry confirmed the RNA levels. The strongest differences in protein expression between the two patterns were shown for ITPKA (p = 0.02) and angiogenin (p = 0.113). Conclusions In this study growth pattern-specific gene signatures in pulmonary adenocarcinoma were identified and distinct transcriptomic differences between lung adenocarcinoma growth patterns were defined. The study provides valuable new information about pulmonary adenocarcinoma and allows a better assessment of the five adenocarcinoma subgroups."
https://openalex.org/W2897872268,"Objectives To examine secular changes in the incidence of invasive beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections, and to assess the efficacy of immunoglobulins and clindamycin as adjunctive therapies in the management of Streptococcus pyogenes infections. Methods Retrospective cohort study of all cases of invasive group A (GAS), B (GBS), C or G (GCGS) streptococcal infections managed in a Canadian tertiary center from 1996–2016. Population incidence was measured for diabetics and non-diabetics. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by logistic regression. Results 741 cases were identified (GAS: 249; GBS: 304; GCGS: 188). While the incidence of invasive GAS infections fluctuated with no clear trend, incidence of invasive GBS and GCGS increased over time and were 8.4 and 6.3 times higher in diabetics. Mortality of invasive GAS infections decreased from 16% (6/37) in 1996–2001 to 4% (4/97) in 2011–15. Among patients with GAS infections, clindamycin administered concomitantly with a beta-lactam within 24 hours of admission decreased mortality (AOR: 0.04, 95%CI: 0.003–0.55, P = 0.02. Immunoglobulins had no such effect (AOR: 1.66, 95%CI: 0.16–17.36, P = 0.67). The protective effect of clindamycin was similar in patients with pneumonia/empyema compared to all others. Conclusion Incidence of GBS and GCGS infections increased due to an expansion of the high-risk population (elderly diabetics), but also rose in non-diabetics. No such secular change was seen for invasive GAS infections. The decrease in mortality in patients with invasive GAS infections presumably reflects better case-management. Adjunctive clindamycin reduced mortality in invasive GAS infections; immunoglobulins did not, but power was limited. The highest mortality was seen in patients with GAS pneumonia/empyema, for whom clindamycin was protective but underused."

The role of research assumes greater importance in Africa as it carries a larger share of the global burden of diseases, blindness, and low vision. ""Vision 2020- the Right to Sight"" is a WHO-IAPB collaborated initiative aiming to eliminate preventable blindness by the year 2020. High quality research in eye care is imperative for the initiative to succeed, however, there is a dearth of research in eye care in sub-Saharan Africa in general and specifically in the Eastern, Central, and Southern African (ECSA) region. Identifying the barriers that hamper research in this region is an important step towards the elimination of preventable blindness.A structured questionnaire using the SurveyMonkey program was sent to ophthalmologists in the ECSA region and South Africa through their respective regional professional bodies.Lack of funding, inadequate time and poor research knowledge were the main research barriers while the ability to improve eye health care through research was the main incentive for conducting research. The response rate for South Africa was low, restricting comparisons with other ECSA countries.The barriers mainly center on financial, human and administrative infrastructure and resources. In spite of the barriers, ophthalmologists in the study region are enthusiastic in research aiming to increase evidence-based knowledge to improve eye health care in line with the goals of ""Vision 2020- the Right to Sight"" initiative."
https://openalex.org/W2895926058,"Background Obesity and infertility are associated with poorer sexual function. We have previously shown that a lifestyle intervention in women with obesity and infertility reduced weight and improved cardiometabolic health and quality of life, which may positively affect sexual function. We now report on sexual function 5 years after randomization. Methods and findings In total 577 women, between 18–39 years of age, with infertility and a BMI ≥29 kg/m2 were randomized to a six-month lifestyle intervention targeting physical activity, diet and behavior modification or prompt infertility care as usual. Intercourse frequency and sexual function were assessed with the McCoy Female Sexuality Questionnaire (MFSQ), 5.4±0.8 years after randomization. 550 women could be approached for the follow-up study, of whom 84 women in the intervention and 93 in the control group completed the MFSQ. Results were adjusted for duration of infertility, polycystic ovary syndrome and whether women were attempting to conceive. The intervention group more often reported having had intercourse in the past 4 weeks compared to the control group (aOR: 2.3 95% CI 0.96 to 5.72). Among women reporting intercourse in the past 4 weeks, the intervention group (n = 75) had intercourse more frequently (6.6±5.8 vs. 4.9±4.0 times; 95% CI 0.10 to 3.40) and had higher scores for vaginal lubrication (16.5±3.0 vs. 15.4±3.5; 95% CI 0.15 to 2.32) and total ‘sexual function’ score (96.5±14.2 vs. 91.4±12.8; 95% CI 0.84 to 9.35) compared to the control group (n = 72). Sexual interest, satisfaction, orgasm and sex partner scores did not differ statistically between the groups. The intervention effect on sexual function was for 21% mediated by the change in moderate to vigorous physical activity. Conclusion A six-month lifestyle intervention in women with obesity and infertility led to more frequent intercourse, better vaginal lubrication and overall sexual function 5 years after the intervention.

https://openalex.org/W2896663238,"Accumulating evidence has revealed that both high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and homocysteine (HCY) are associated with increased risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and cardiovascular disease. However, it is unclear whether the coexistence of these conditions accelerates the risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS). We hypothesized that the combination of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and homocysteine (HCY) levels could exacerbate the development of MetS in a large prospective cohort study. We selected data from 3,170 individuals (1,614 men and 1,556 women) who participated in the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study. Participants with high hsCRP and HCY levels were categorized into quartiles. MetS was defined based on the criteria of the modified National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III. The prevalence of MetS was higher in participants with concurrent high hsCRP and HCY compared to those with low hsCRP and HCY levels. The incidence of MetS at the 6-year follow-up was the highest in participants with concomitant high hsCRP and HCY levels, regardless of obesity. Even after adjusting for potential confounding factors including body mass index in a multivariate logistic regression model, subjects with elevated hsCRP and HCY levels had a 2.50-fold increased risk of developing MetS at the six-year follow-up compared to those who did not have high hsCRP and HCY level. MetS is more prevalent in the concurrent presence of elevated hsCRP and HCY levels. The combination of the two conditions may contribute to an increased risk of MetS, but these factors may not be synergistic."
https://openalex.org/W2897263192,"A field experiment was performed to explore the compensation effects of different nitrogen (N) regimes on the growth and photosynthetic capacity in different leaf layers of the summer maize hybrid of LuYu9105 under waterlogging at the seedling stage. The results showed that waterlogging significantly decreased the maximum green leaf area (gLA) by 10.0~15.3% and 9.3~22.5%, mainly due to the reduction in the below-ear layer leaves at the silking stage in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Waterlogging also significantly decreased the ear leaf photosynthetic rate (PN), and Fv/Fm, Fv/Fo, ΦPSII and qP at the below-ear layer leaves at the mid- and late-filling stages, which was accompanied by a reduction in the duration of grain-filling (T) by 2.6~5.9%, thus resulting in a loss of grain yield by 7.0~18.5%. Interestingly, a shift in N from basal application to topdressing at the big flare stage was shown to compensate the adverse effects of waterlogging by through increased gLA and leaf photosynthetic capacity at the ear layer and the above-ear layer, as well as a greater grain-filling rate, resulting in an increase in grain yield by 9.9~27.0% and 17.8~25.8% compared to other N treatments. Therefore, this study showed that optimal nitrogen regimes during maize growth are capable of compensating for the impacts caused by waterlogging at the seedling stage."
https://openalex.org/W2895970519,"Determine the decay rate of HIV-1 DNA reservoir in vertically infected children during sustained viral suppression (VS) and how it is affected by the age at VS.This study included 37 HIV-1 vertically infected children on suppressive antiretroviral therapy for at least 4 years. Children were grouped according to the age of antiretroviral therapy initiation (≤0.5 or >0.5 yrs) and to the age at VS (≤1.5, between >1.5 and 4, and >4 years). Decay of cell-associated HIV-1 DNA (CA-HIV-DNA) level and 2-long terminal repeats (2-LTR) circles frequency were analyzed over 4 years of viral suppression using piecewise linear mixed-effects model with two splines and logistic regression, respectively.CA-HIV-DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells had a significant decay during the first two years of VS [-0.26 (95% CI: -0.43, -0.09) log10 copies per one million cells (cpm)/year], and subsequently reached a plateau [-0.06 (95% CI: -0.15, 0.55) log10 cpm/year]. The initial decay was higher in children who achieved VS by 1.5 years of age compared to those who achieved VS between >1.5 and 4 years and those after 4 years of age: -0.51 (95% CI:-0.94, -0.07), -0.35 (95% CI:-0.83, 0.14), and -0.21 (95% CI:-0.39, -0.02) log10cpm PBMC/year, respectively. The 2-LTR circles frequency decayed significantly, from 82.9% at pre-VS to 37.5% and 28.1% at 2 and 4 years of VS, respectively (P = .0009).These data highlight that achieving VS during the first 18 months of life limit the establishment of HIV-1 reservoirs, reinforcing the clinical benefit of very early effective therapy in children."
https://openalex.org/W2896518482,"Background Approaches to screening for active tuberculosis (TB) among people living with HIV are inadequate, leading to missed diagnoses and poor implementation of preventive therapy. Methods Consecutive HIV-infected adults hospitalized at Mulago Hospital (Kampala, Uganda) between June 2011 and July 2013 with a cough ≥ 2 weeks were enrolled. Patients underwent extensive evaluation for pulmonary TB. Concentrations of 43 cytokines/chemokines were measured at the same time point as C-reactive protein (CRP) in banked plasma samples using commercially-available multiplex kits. Advanced classification algorithms were used to rank cytokines/chemokines for their ability to identify TB, and to model the specificity of the top-ranked cytokines/chemokines individually and in combination with sensitivity constrained to ≥ 90% as recommended for TB screening. Results The median plasma level of 5 biomarkers (IL-6, INF-γ, MIG, CRP, IL-18) was significantly different between patients with and without TB. With sensitivity constrained to 90%, all had low specificity with IL-6 showing the highest specificity (44%; 95% CI 37.4–49.5). Biomarker panels were found to be more valuable than any biomarker alone. A panel combining IFN-γ and IL-6 had the highest specificity (50%; 95% CI 46.7–53.3). Sensitivity remained high (>85%) for all panels among sputum smear-negative TB patients. Conclusions Direct measurement of unstimulated plasma cytokines/chemokines in peripheral blood is a promising approach to TB screening. Cytokine/chemokine panels retained high sensitivity for smear-negative TB and achieved improved specificity compared to individual cytokines/chemokines. These markers should be further evaluated in outpatient settings where most TB screening occurs and where other illnesses associated with systematic inflammation are less common."
https://openalex.org/W2896904253,"Serial section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM) is the most promising tool for investigating the three-dimensional anatomy of the brain with nanometer resolution. Yet as the field progresses to larger volumes of brain tissue, new methods for high-yield, low-cost, and high-throughput serial sectioning are required. Here, we introduce LASSO (Loop-based Automated Serial Sectioning Operation), in which serial sections are processed in “batches.” Batches are quantized groups of individual sections that, in LASSO, are cut with a diamond knife, picked up from an attached waterboat, and placed onto microfabricated TEM substrates using rapid, accurate, and repeatable robotic tools. Additionally, we introduce mathematical models for ssTEM with respect to yield, throughput, and cost to access ssTEM scalability. To validate the method experimentally, we processed 729 serial sections of human brain tissue (~40 nm x 1 mm x 1 mm). Section yield was 727/729 (99.7%). Sections were placed accurately and repeatably (x-direction: -20 ± 110 μm (1 s.d.), y-direction: 60 ± 150 μm (1 s.d.)) with a mean cycle time of 43 s ± 12 s (1 s.d.). High-magnification (2.5 nm/px) TEM imaging was conducted to measure the image quality. We report no significant distortion, information loss, or substrate-derived artifacts in the TEM images. Quantitatively, the edge spread function across vesicle edges and image contrast were comparable, suggesting that LASSO does not negatively affect image quality. In total, LASSO compares favorably with traditional serial sectioning methods with respect to throughput, yield, and cost for large-scale experiments, and represents a flexible, scalable, and accessible technology platform to enable the next generation of neuroanatomical studies."

The economic burden of CIDP is not well understood.To assess the economic and clinical burden of CIDP and to compare the incremental burden relative to a matched control group without CIDP.This retrospective case-control analysis was conducted using data from the IQVIA Real-World Data Adjudicated Claims. Adults newly diagnosed with CIDP between 7/1/2010 and 6/30/2014 were identified and direct matched to controls without CIDP. Baseline characteristics were assessed and compared over a 6-month pre-index period. Healthcare resource use, costs and clinical characteristics were assessed and compared over a 2-year follow-up. Total cost differences over the 2-year follow-up were compared between matched cohorts using a generalized estimating equation model.The final sample comprised a total of 790 cases matched to 790 controls. Over the 2-year follow-up, cases more frequently experienced neuropathic pain, back pain and osteoarthritis and more commonly utilized opioids, anti-convulsants and anti-depressants. Compared to controls, more cases had ≥1 hospitalization (26.2% vs. 9.0%), and cases had a higher mean number of outpatient prescription fills (62.8 vs. 32.0) and physician office visits (34.7 vs. 13.0) (all p<0.0001). Cases had 7.5x higher mean total costs ($116,330 vs. $15,586, p<0.0001). Important cost drivers were costs for outpatient ancillary, radiology and HCPCS drugs (mean $76,366 vs. $4,292) and costs for inpatient care (mean $16,357 vs. $2,862) (both p<0.0001). Among cases, CIDP therapy (inclusive of both outpatient pharmacy and medical claims) accounted for 51.2% of mean total costs. After further adjusting for baseline clinical characteristics, cases were associated with a 6.1x increase in total costs compared to controls (p<0.0001).Our findings suggest a substantial clinical and economic burden among patients with CIDP relative to matched controls over a 2-year follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W2897620605,"The perception and recognition of facial expressions are crucial for parenting. This study investigated whether and how maternal nurturing experience and trait anxiety influence the perception and recognition of infant and adult facial expressions. This was assessed by comparing the performance of primiparous mothers (n = 25) and non-mothers (n = 28) on an emotional face perception task. Trait anxiety was measured using the Japanese version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). We found that mothers had higher recognition accuracy for facial expressions, but only of adults, not infants. Moreover, as trait anxiety increased, so did mothers’ sensitivity in perceiving facial expressions of both infants and adults. These findings suggest that maternal nurturing experience does enhance the recognition of adult emotional expressions, and an optimal level of maternal trait anxiety may enhance mothers’ sensitivity toward infants’ and adults’ emotional signals."

The aim of these studies was to investigate the effect of glass shape on the pouring accuracy of liquid volume. Methods In Study 1, using an online computerised task, participants (n = 211) were asked to pour liquid in glasses in a within-subjects design with factors of glass shape (straight, curved) and requested percentage fullness (10, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 75, 80, 90%). Curve estimations were carried out to determine if errors followed a linear or non-linear relationship. In Study 2, in a real world experimental study, participants (n = 96) were asked to pour water to the midpoint of pint glasses in a within-subjects design with one factor of glass shape (straight, curved, tulip, inverted). Differences between poured amounts were analysed using one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Results In Study 1, participants under-poured in curved glasses compared to straight glasses at all requested amounts. In Study 2, participants under-poured in curved (p < 0.001, dz = 1.51) and tulip (p < 0.001, dz = 0.59) glasses compared to straight glasses. Findings were inconclusive as to whether or not a difference was present between pourings in inverted and straight glasses. Participants displayed a tendency to under-pour in all glasses relative to requested amounts in both studies. Conclusions The shape of glassware appears to influence the pouring accuracy of liquid. Pouring in tulip and curved glasses was more inaccurate compared to straight glasses, possibly due to the height of liquid within the glass and volume changing in a non-linear relationship."

Using a within-subject analysis, we investigate whether or not second-movers exhibit some taste for inequality aversion by returning a larger (smaller) share of the available funds to first-movers who are initially endowed with a lesser (larger) endowment, respectively. Our data suggest that second-movers do not take into consideration the level of endowments when making their decisions as their behavior is consistent across distribution of endowments; i.e., they return the same proportion of the available funds regardless of the endowments. We indeed find that some second-movers have a tendency to return what they have received from first-movers. In our data, there is also a substantial proportion of second-movers who are selfish and return nothing. (JEL Codes: C72, C91, D3, D63)."

The aim of present study was to assess DNA damage response (DDR) mechanisms of IR-treated hiPSC-DCHs.The following IR-response characteristics in irradiated hiPSC-DCHs were assessed: 1) the kinetics of DNA DSB formation; 2) activation of major DNA repair mechanisms; 3) cell cycle changes and 4) reactive oxygen species (ROS), level of key markers of apoptosis and senescence.DNA DSBs were observed in 30% of the hiPSC-DCHs overall, and in 60% after high-dose (> 2 Gy) IR. Nevertheless, these cells displayed efficient DNA repair mechanisms, which reduced the DSBs over time until it reached 30% by activating key genes involved in homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining mechanisms. As similar to mature chondrocytes, irradiated hiPSC-DCH cells revealed accumulation of cells in G2 phase. Overall, the hiPSC-DCH cells were characterized by low levels of ROS, cPARP and high levels of senescence.The chondrocyte-like cells derived from hiPSC demonstrated features characteristic of both mature chondrocytes and ""parental"" hiPSCs. The main difference between hiPSC-derived chondrocytes and hiPSCs and mature chondrocytes appears to be the more efficient DDR mechanism of hiPSC-DCHs. The unique properties of these cells suggest that they could potentially be used safely in regenerative medicine if these preliminary findings are confirmed in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2896133128,"Vertebrates respond to stressful stimuli with the secretion of glucocorticoid (GC) hormones, such as corticosterone (CORT), and measurements of these hormones in wild species can provide insight into physiological responses to environmental and human-induced stressors. California condors (Gymnogyps californianus) are a critically endangered and intensively managed avian species for which information on GC response to stress is lacking. Here we evaluated a commercially available I125 double antibody radioimmunoassay (RIA) and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for measurement of CORT and GC metabolites (GCM) in California condor plasma, urate, and feather samples. The precision and accuracy of the RIA assay outperformed the ELISA for CORT and GCM measurements, and CORT and GCM values were not comparable between the two assays for any sample type. RIA measurements of total CORT in condor plasma collected from 41 condors within 15 minutes of a handling stressor were highly variable (median = 70 ng/mL, range = 1-189 ng/mL) and significantly different between wild and captive condors (p = 0.02, two-tailed t-test, n = 10 wild and 11 captive). Urate GCM levels (median = 620 ng/g dry wt., range = 0.74-7200 ng/g dry wt., n = 216) significantly increased within 2 hr of the acute handling stressor (p = 0.032, n = 11 condors, one-tailed paired t-test), while feather section CORT concentrations (median = 18 pg/mm, range = 6.3-68 ng/g, n = 37) also varied widely within and between feathers. Comparison of multiple regression linear models shows condor age as a significant predictors of plasma CORT levels, while age, sex, and plasma CORT levels predicted GCM levels in urates collected within 30 min of the start of handling. Our findings highlight the need for validation when selecting an immunoassay for use with a new species, and suggest that non-invasively collected urates and feathers hold promise for assessing condor responses to acute or chronic environmental and human-induced stressors."

https://openalex.org/W2897828444,"RIP2, one of the RIP kinases, interacts with p75 neurotrophin receptor, regulating the neuron survival, and with NOD1 and NOD2 proteins, causing the innate immune response against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria via its caspase recruitment domain (CARD). This makes RIP2 a prospective target for novel therapies, aimed to modulate the inflammatory diseases and neurogenesis/neurodegeneration. Several studies report the problems with the stability of human RIP2 CARD and its production in bacterial hosts, which is a prerequisite for the structural investigation with solution NMR spectroscopy. In the present work, we report the high yield production and refolding protocols and resolve the structure of rat RIP2 CARD. The structure reveals the important differences to the previously published conformation of the homologous human protein. Using solution NMR, we characterized the intramolecular mobility and pH-dependent behavior of RIP2 CARD, and found the propensity of the protein to form high-order oligomers at physiological pH while being monomeric under acidic conditions. The oligomerization of protein may be explained, based on the electrostatic properties of its surface. Analysis of the structure and sequences of homologous proteins reveals the residues which are significant for the unusual fold of RIP2 CARD domains from different species. The high-throughput protein production/refolding protocols and proposed explanation for the protein oligomerization, provide an opportunity to design the stabilized variants of RIP2 CARD, which could be used to study the structural details of RIP2/NOD1/NOD2 interaction and perform the rational drug design."
https://openalex.org/W2897907453,"Aberrant glycolytic metabolism is one of the hallmarks of carcinogenesis and therefore reversal of metabolic transformation is a promising drug target in cancer treatment strategies. Dichloroacetic acid (DCA) is known to target the glycolytic pathway in cancer cells and facilitates reversal of metabolic transformation from aerobic cytosolic accumulation of pyruvic acid, “the Warburg effect”, to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Recently, combination therapy particularly involving photodynamic therapy (PDT) has received considerable attention in oncology. We hypothesized that if DCA and PDT are combined, they might potentiate mitochondrial dysfunction and induce apoptosis by a reactive oxygen species (ROS) dependent pathway. We used MCF-7 cells as our in vitro model and 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) dependent PDT therapy to test our hypothesis. We found that combinatorial treatment of MCF-7 cells with PDT and DCA not only increased cell growth inhibition, but also affected mitochondrial membrane integrity perhaps via production of ROS, and enhanced apoptosis. Further, our results on ATP release during the combined treatment demonstrate that immunogenic cell death (ICD) is likely to be a potential mechanism by which PDT and DCA induce cancer cell death. Taken together, our study suggests a novel way of sensitizing MCF-7 cells for accelerated induction of apoptosis and ICD in these cells. The findings included in this study might have direct relevance in breast cancer treatment strategies."

Moreover, the non-coding regions of cpDNA display higher mutation rates than the conserved coding cpDNA, which has been employed for phylogenetic and population research. We analyzed the cpDNA of 332 gDNA samples from collections of Cornus florida and C. kousa (commercial cultivars, breeding selections, and wild kousa accessions from Asia), using the chlorotyping system developed on North America-native, wild accessions of C. florida. Our results indicated significant differences in chlorotype frequencies between the two species. Cornus florida samples were represented by all major chlorotypes previously described, whereas all C. kousa samples analyzed had only one of the chlorotype patterns shown by C. florida. The chlorotyping analytic panel was then expanded by sequencing the targeted three non-coding cpDNA regions. Results indicated a major difference in the maternally-inherited cpDNA between the two closely related Big-Bracted Cornus species. Chlorotype diversity and differences in the proportion of informative sites in the cpDNA regions of focus emphasized the importance of proper loci choice for cpDNA-based comparative studies between the closely related dogwood species. Phylogenetic analyses of the retrieved sequences for the other species of Cornus provided information on the relative utility of the cpDNA regions studied and helped delineate the groups (Big-Bracted, Cornelian Cherries, Blue/White-Fruited) within the genus. Genealogical relationships based on the cpDNA sequences and the inferred chlorotype networks indicated the need for continued analyses across further non-coding cpDNA regions to improve the phylogenetic resolution of dogwoods."
https://openalex.org/W2897373653,"The biomass yield (plant weight) of rice fluctuates from year to year. In a previous study, we demonstrated that six quantitative trait loci (QTLs) contribute to the variation in the plant weight of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of high-yielding Japanese rice cultivars. However, it remains unclear whether the effects of those QTLs are stable over multiple years. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of the alleles on the plant weight of RILs over multiple years, including a change of fertilization level (i.e., in different environments). Even though the biomass yields of all RILs fluctuated among environments, RILs that were selected on the basis of the genotypes of the detected QTLs had a stable rank order of plant weight that corresponded to their genotypes. This multiple-environment experiment reveals the highly significant contribution of both genotypic and environmental variances to the observed variance in plant weight. A marginally significant QTL-environment interaction was detected at only one of the six QTLs, with a subtle contribution. These results support the idea that the biomass yield of rice can be improved through QTL-based allele selection."
https://openalex.org/W2895919429,"Introduction The use of multimodal computed tomography imaging (MMCT) in routine clinical assessment of stroke patients improves the identification of patients with large regions of salvageable brain tissue, lower risk for haemorrhagic transformation, or a large vessel occlusion requiring endovascular therapy. Aim To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using MMCT compared to usual practice for determining eligibility for reperfusion therapy with alteplase using real world data from the International Stroke Perfusion Imaging Registry (INSPIRE). Methods We performed a cost-utility analysis. Mean costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient for two alternative screening protocols were calculated. Protocol 1 represented usual practice, while Protocol 2 reflected treatment targeting using multimodal imaging. Cost-effectiveness was assessed using the net-benefit framework. Results Protocol 1 had a total mean per patient cost of $2,013 USD and 0.148 QALYs. Protocol 2 had a total mean per patient cost of $1,519 USD and 0.153 QALYs. For a range of willingness-to-pay values, representing implicit thresholds of cost-effectiveness, the lower bound of the incremental net monetary benefit statistic was consistently greater than zero, indicating that MMCT is cost- effective compared to usual practice. The results were most sensitive to variation in the mean number of alteplase vials administered. Conclusion In a healthcare setting where multimodal imaging technologies are available and reimbursed, their use in screening patients presenting with acute stroke to determine eligibility for alteplase treatment is cost-effective given a range of willingness-to-pay thresholds and warrants consideration as an alternative to routine practice."
https://openalex.org/W2896284577,"There has recently been an increased research focus on the influence of social factors on human cognition, attention, and action. While this represents an important step towards an ecologically valid description of real-world behaviour, this work has primarily examined dyads interacting with virtual stimuli i.e. on-screen images of objects. Though differences between actions to images and real items are known, their relative sensitivity to social factors is largely unknown. We argue that because images and real items elicit different neural representations, patterns of attention, and hand actions, a direct comparison between the magnitude of social effects while interacting with images and real objects is demanded. We examined patterns of reaching as individuals performed a shape-matching game. Images and real objects were used as stimuli, and social context was manipulated via the proximity of an observer. We found that social context interacted with stimulus type to modulate behaviour. Specifically, there was a delay in reaching for distant objects when a participant was facing another individual but this social effect only occurred when the stimuli were real objects. Our data suggest that even when images and real objects are arranged to share the affordance of reachability, they differ in their sensitivity to social influences. Therefore, the measurement of social effects using on-screen stimuli may poorly predict the social effects of actions directed towards real objects. Accordingly, generalizations between these two domains should be treated with caution."
https://openalex.org/W2897785158,"Unique amongst the teleost, Plotosidae catfish possess a dendritic organ (DO) as a purported salt secreting organ, whereas other marine teleosts rely on their gill ionocytes for active NaCl excretion. To address the role of the DO in ionregulation, ligation experiments were conducted in brackish water (BW) 3‰ and seawater (SW) 34‰ acclimated Plotosus lineatus and compared to sham operated fish. Ligation in SW resulted in an osmoregulatory impairment in blood (elevated ions and hematocrit) and muscle (dehydration). However, SW ligation did not elicit compensatory changes in gill or kidney Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) activity and/or protein expression while a decrease in anterior intestine and increased in posterior intestine were observed but this was not reflected at the protein level. Following ligation in SW, protein levels of carbonic anhydrase (CA) and V-ATPase B subunit (VHAB) were higher in kidney but either lower (CA) or unchanged (VHAB) in other tissues. Taken together, the osmotic disturbance in ligated SW fish indicates the central role of the DO in salt secretion and the absence of a compensatory response from the gill."
https://openalex.org/W2896654617,"Assessing potential stroke treatments in the presence of risk factors can improve screening of treatments prior to clinical trials and is important in testing the efficacy of treatments in different patient populations. Here, we test our noninvasive, nonpharmacological sensory stimulation treatment in the presence of the main risk factor for ischemic stroke, hypertension. Utilizing functional imaging, blood flow imaging, and histology, we assessed spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) pre- and post-permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). Experimental groups included a treatment SHR group (sensory-stimulated group), control untreated SHR group (no sensory stimulation), and a treated (sensory-stimulated) Wistar-Kyoto normotensive group. Unlike our previous studies, which showed sensory-based complete protection from impending ischemic cortical stroke damage in rats as seen in the treated Wistar-Kyoto group, we found that SHRs at 24hr post-pMCAO lacked evoked cortical activation, had a significant reduction in blood flow within the MCA, and sustained very large infarcts regardless of whether they received stimulation treatment. If translatable, this work highlights a potential need for a combined treatment plan when delivering sensory stimulation treatment in this patient population."
https://openalex.org/W2896862961,"Utility scores are integral to health economics decision-making. Typically, utility scores have not been scored or developed with mental health service users. The aims of this study were to i) collaborate with service users to develop descriptions of five mental health states (psychosis, depression, eating disorder, medication side effects and self-harm); ii) explore feasibility and acceptability of using scenario-based health states in an e-survey; iii) evaluate which utility measures (standard gamble (SG), time trade off (TTO) and rating scale (RS)) are preferred; and iv) determine how different participant groups discriminate between the health scenarios and rank them.This was a co-produced mixed methods cross-sectional online survey. Utility scores were generated using the SG, TTO and RS methods; difficulty of the completing each method, markers of acceptability and participants' preference were also assessed.A total of 119 participants (58%) fully completed the survey. For any given health state, SG consistently generated higher utility scores compared to RS and for some health states higher also than TTO (i.e. SG produces inflated utility scores relative to RS and TTO). Results suggest that different utility measures produce different evaluations of described health states. The TTO was preferred by all participant groups over the SG. The three participant groups scored four (of five) health scenarios comparably. Psychosis scored as the worst health state to live with while medication side-effects were viewed more positively than other scenarios (depression, eating disorders, self-harm) by all participant groups. However, there was a difference in how the depression scenario was scored, with service users giving depression a lower utility score compared to other groups.Mental health state scenarios used to generate utility scores can be co-produced and are well received by a broad range of participants. Utility valuations using SG, TTO and RS were feasible for use with service users, carers, healthcare professionals and members of the general public. Future studies of utility scores in psychiatry should aim to include mental health service users as both co-investigators and respondents."
https://openalex.org/W2897028533,"Estimating equations can be used when measuring the height of elderly persons is not possible. However, such methods are not always applicable; therefore, it is necessary to consider several aspects, such as sex, age, and ethnicity of the studied population to generate these equations. This study aimed to compare and validate methods of estimating the height of the Brazilian elderly nursing home residents. An accuracy study was conducted with 168 elderly persons. A total of 23 equations were quantitatively evaluated by plotting the differences in means, the Student's t-test for paired samples, the coefficient of determination (R2), the root-mean-square error (RMSE), the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and by graphic analysis of the residuals. A significance value of p <0.05 was adopted. An equation was considered applicable when it had R2 >0.7, the lowest RMSE among the equations evaluated, ICC >0.7, and a confidence interval of 95%, with the smallest difference between the upper and lower limits. A greater mean height was noted among younger elderly persons and elderly men compared to up to 80 years and women elderly. Quantitative analysis revealed that equation for Puerto Ricans, using knee height and age, was the most applicable for the overall population (ICC = 0.802). The same equation was applicable for the elderly Brazilian male participants (ICC = 0.838) and for those aged 60-69 years (ICC = 0.895). None of the equations used were applicable for the height estimation of elderly women or individuals aged 70 years or more."
https://openalex.org/W2897905959,"Analysis of the large amounts of data accumulated in public databanks can facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of molecular biological processes. Community detection from molecular biological data is paramount in characterizing evolutionary and functional traits of organisms based on gene homology and co-expression, respectively. Although there are common tools to detect local communities from a large network, no toolkit exists for detecting communities that include an element of interest based on size sensitivity, i.e., functionality to obtain local communities with preferred sizes. Herein, we present the ConfeitoGUI toolkit for detecting local communities from a correlation network involving size sensitivity. We compared the toolkit with other common tools for detection in reconstructing communities of microarray experiments of mice. In the results, ConfeitoGUI was observed to be preferable for detecting communities whose sizes are similar to those of original communities compared to other common tools. By changing simple parameters representing sizes for the toolkit, a user can obtain local communities with preferred sizes, which is beneficial for further analysis of members belonging to the communities."
https://openalex.org/W2950120388,"NMDA receptors are important for cognition and are implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. GluN1 knockdown (GluN1KD) mice have reduced NMDA receptor levels, striatal spine density deficits, and cognitive impairments. However, how NMDA depletion leads to these effects is unclear. Since Rho GTPases are known to regulate spine density and cognition, we examined the levels of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 signaling proteins. Striatal Rac1-pathway components are reduced in GluN1KD mice, with Rac1 and WAVE-1 deficits at 6 and 12 weeks of age. Concurrently, medium spiny neuron (MSN) spine density deficits are present in mice at these ages. To determine whether WAVE-1 deficits were causal or compensatory in relation to these phenotypes, we intercrossed GluN1KD mice with WAVE-1 overexpressing (WAVE-Tg) mice to restore WAVE-1 levels. GluN1KD-WAVE-Tg hybrids showed rescue of striatal WAVE-1 protein levels and MSN spine density, as well as selective behavioral rescue in the Y-maze and 8-arm radial maze tests. GluN1KD-WAVE-Tg mice expressed normalized WAVE-1 protein levels in the hippocampus, yet spine density of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons was not significantly altered. Our data suggest a nuanced role for WAVE-1 effects on cognition and a delineation of specific cognitive domains served by the striatum. Rescue of striatal WAVE-1 and MSN spine density may be significant for goal-directed exploration and associated long-term memory in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2897339620,"The cyclic ratio (CR) schedule is a behavioural assay developed to study feeding in rats, in which the number of operant responses required to obtain food reward (the ratio requirement) increases and then decreases in a repeating cycle. In a recent study, we used the CR schedule with European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) to investigate the effects of an early-life manipulation on adult feeding behaviour. As this was the first time the CR schedule had been used with any bird species, a more in-depth evaluation is warranted. Here, we performed a fuller CR experiment with the same birds as the prior study, a year later. First, we examine the individual consistency of feeding behaviour between experimental sessions and also between CR schedules comprising different ratio requirement progressions. We found that between-session consistency was poor to moderate, and that a geometric ratio progression provided greater between-session consistency than an arithmetic ratio progression. Second, we tried to replicate some of the canonical findings from rats working on CR schedules. In contrast to findings from rats, we found that defence of feeding rates did not increase when starlings were acutely food deprived. However, as in rats, we found that the post-reinforcement pause increased linearly with the upcoming ratio requirement, suggesting that starlings were able to learn the cyclic nature of the schedule. Third, we compared the results from the present study concerning the impacts of our early-life treatment with those from our earlier study. We found that the majority of our previous findings were replicated in the same individuals one year on, reinforcing our previous conclusion that the early-life manipulation had canalised our birds into two groups with different patterns of feeding rate defence."
