https://openalex.org/W1991709039,"Polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) play a key role in stratospheric ozone depletion. Surface-catalyzed reactions on PSC particles generate chlorine compounds that photolyze readily to yield chlorine radicals, which in turn destroy ozone very efficiently. The most prevalent PSCs form at temperatures several degrees above the ice frost point and are believed to consist of HNO(3) hydrates; however, their formation mechanism is unclear. Results of laboratory experiments are presented which indicate that the background stratospheric H(2)SO(4)/H(2)O aerosols provide an essential link in this mechanism: These liquid aerosols absorb significant amounts of HNO(3) vapor, leading most likely to the crystallization of nitric acid trihydrate (NAT). The frozen particles then grow to form PSCs by condensation of additional amounts of HNO(3) and H(2)O vapor. Furthermore, reaction probability measurements reveal that the chlorine radical precursors are formed readily at polar stratospheric temperatures not just on NAT and ice crystals, but also on liquid H(2)SO(4) solutions and on solid H(2)SO(4) hydrates. These results imply that the chlorine activation efficiency of the aerosol particles increases rapidly as the temperature approaches the ice frost point regardless of the phase or composition of the particles."

Observations of short-period, shear-to-compressional wave conversions produced at the discontinuity yield a detailed map of deformation beneath the Izu-Bonin subduction zone. The discontinuity is depressed by about 60 kilometers beneath the coldest part of the subducted slab, with a deformation profile consistent with the expected thermal signature of the slab, the experimentally determined Clapeyron slope of the phase transition, and the regional tectonic history."

https://openalex.org/W1965749031,"Compared with pure metals and ionic salts, covalent solids such as silicon are hard and brittle because dislocations do not move in them except at high temperatures. A satisfactory explanation for this behavior has been lacking in spite of its great importance for the mechanics of materials and structures. It is shown here that the critical atomic process leading to the observed brittleness is analogous to a chemical substitution reaction. Analysis of this analogy with the aid of a correlation diagram yields the observed high resistive stress and high activation energy. When a kink on a dislocation line moves, it breaks the atomic bonding symmetry, a forbidden process."
https://openalex.org/W2075653325,"Three-dimensional numerical simulations were conducted of mantle convection in which flow through the transition zone is impeded by either a strong chemical change or an endothermic phase change. The temperature fields obtained from these models display a well-defined minimum in the vertical correlation length at or near the radius where the barrier is imposed, even when the fields were filtered to low angular and radial resolutions. However, evidence for such a feature is lacking in the shear-velocity models derived by seismic tomography. This comparison suggests that any stratification induced by phase or chemical changes across the mid-mantle transition zone has a relatively small effect on the large-scale circulation of mantle material."

Magnetic susceptibility cycles 20 to 60 centimeters in length appear to be controlled by the precession of the equinoxes. Cyclicity is particularly robust within a 24-meter interval in the lower Campanian, where overtone spectral peaks are observed as well as secondary susceptibility maxima within individual precession cycles. One model for this behavior is that sedimentation in the narrow Cretaceous South Atlantic was controlled by equatorial climate dynamics, with the precessional insolation signal rectified by the large land masses surrounding the ocean basin."

https://openalex.org/W1999352053,"The reaction K + NaBr --> KBr + Na is probed during the reactive collision by a continuous wave laser tuned to frequencies not resonant with excitation in either reagents or products. Transient [K..Br..Na] absorbs a laser photon giving [K..Br..Na](*), which can decompose to Na(*) + KBr. Emission from excited Na(*) at the sodium D lines provides direct evidence of laser absorption during the reaction. Different excitation spectra were observed, depending on which sodium D line was monitored. This difference is explicable if, in the absence of the laser, the reaction flux partially bifurcates to a second potential energy surface during the reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2038358345,"On the basis of presently available data, combined with present-day knowledge of the physics and chemistry of cloud particle development, it is possible to make the following generalizations about the mode of precipitation in natural clouds. 1) The all-water mechanism begins to operate as soon as a parcel of cloud air is formed and continues to operate throughout the life of the cloud. The ice-crystal mechanism, on the other hand, can begin to operate only after the top of the cloud has reached levels where ice nuclei can be effective (about -15 degrees C). Some clouds never reach this height; any precipitation from them must be through the all-water mechanism. In cold climates and at high levels in the atmosphere, the cloud bases may be very close to this critical temperature. In the tropics, approximately 25,000 feet separate the bases of low clouds from the natural ice level. 2) The number of large hygroscopic nuclei in maritime air over tropical oceans is entirely adequate to rain-out any cloud with a base below about 10,000 feet, provided the cloud duration and cloud depth is sufficient for the precipitation process to operate. Extensive trajectories over land will decrease the number of sea-salt particles, both because of sedimentation and removal in rain. Measurements show an order-of-magnitude decrease in the number of large particles as maritime air moves from the Gulf of Mexico to the vicinity of St. Louis, during the summer months. Measurements in Arizona and New Mexico show even smaller chloride concentrations, presumably because of the long overland trajectories required in reaching these areas. The maritime particles lost in overland trajectories apparently are more than replaced by particles of land origin. The latter are usually of mixed composition and are less favorable for the formation of outsized solution droplets. 3) Ice nuclei, required for the formation of ice crystals and for droplet freezing, are rather rare at temperatures higher than about -10 degrees C. This, of course, accounts for the fact that natural clouds undergo extensive undercooling. Because of the scarcity of suitable nuclei, precipitation through the ice phase usually is not found in clouds warmer than about -15 degrees to -20 degrees C. Natural cirrus clouds might provide ice nuclei for precipitation at somewhat higher temperatures, but this possibility has not been extensively studied. 4) Precipitation in tropical clouds invariably first develops through the all-water mechanism; points discussed in paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 above all work toward this end. Tropical clouds which reach to heights above about 25,000 feet also develop precipitation through snow pellets. The data for mid-latitude clouds are conflicting. Some measurements suggest that summer clouds in the central United States and in the semiarid Southwest develop rain largely through the all-water process; existing theories support such a suggestion. However, flight measurements indicate that there is considerably more ice and snow in the clouds than can be accounted for by present theory; as a consequence, one must be careful in ruling out the ice mechanism in these areas. It appears to me, however, that the ice particles in these clouds are best accounted for through the hypothesis of freezing of drops which have grown to fairly large size through diffusion of vapor. Thus, the ice would be only incidental to the precipitation development. Winter clouds in the central United States and almost all of the clouds of northern United States and Canada appear to precipitate largely through the ice-crystal mechanism. The relatively cold cloud bases and the continental sources of air masses in these regions appear to retard the warm-rain mechanism to the point where the ice mechanism dominates. But here again, a great deal of research must be completed before a firm conclusion can be drawn (18)."

A single Condylostoma could contain as many as six larvae. Related species may destroy many bivalve larvae in nature."
