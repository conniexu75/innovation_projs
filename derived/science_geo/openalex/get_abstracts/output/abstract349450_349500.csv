This substance was characterized as an indole derivative from its ultraviolet absorption spectrum and its behavior in various color and other chemical reactions. The analytical data agreed well with the empirical formula C14Hz103Nb.H2S04. The titration curve in aqueous solution revealed two titratable groups with PK’~ of 4.9 and pK’2 of 9.8. Both of these groups were believed to be basic in nature, and the pK’ value of the weaker suggested an acylated guanidine structure. Indeed, the value was very close to that reported in the literature for creatinine, while the formation of ammonia on treatment with alkali and the presence of one N-methyl grouping suggested that a creatinine residue might well be present in the molecule. The fact that only exceedingly small quantities of pure substance were available led to an investigation of this possibility by calorimetric means, and it was quickly determined that serotonin sulfate responded positively to both the Jaffe alkaline picrate reagent and the Benedict alkaline 3,5dinitrobenzoic acid reagent, with a color intensity equal (within an experimental error of about 10 per cent) to that of creatinine on a molar basis. Benedict’s study (2) of the specificity of the alkaline 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid reagent with respect to creatinine showed that derivatives and closely related compounds such as glycocyamidine could be readily distinguished by measuring both the intensity of color and the rate of color development. Comparison of serotonin sulfate with creatinine in this fashion again revealed almost identical behavior. It then became necessary to investigate the question of whether a creatinine-like residue was actually part of the molecular structure of serotonin, or whether, as now seemed more likely, the entity isolated and designated as serotonin sulfate was not in reality a complex containing an indole base, creatinine, and sulfuric acid. The behavior of serotonin on a paper chromatogram developed with butanol showed that the latter was indeed the case, for the creatinine chromogen was completely separable from the indole chromogen."

https://openalex.org/W1987740991,"NITRATE accumulation due to ineffective nitrate utilization may occur in plants in cases of deficiencies of either molybdenum1–3 or of sulphur4, 5. Though high in nitrogen, such affected plants show symptoms of nitrogen deficiency. It has also been suggested that the effect of molybdenum on legumes is due to its influence in the actual process of symbiotic nitrogen fixation rather than on nitrate utilization6, and that sulphur may indirectly affect legumes through its direct effect upon the nitrogen-fixing organisms."

https://openalex.org/W2012428385,"IN a recent note1, it was shown that irradiation of rats with X-rays diminishes very pronouncedly the rate of incorporation of carbon-14 into desoxyribonucleic acid. Simultaneously, an enhanced incorporation of carbon-14 into the total proteins of the organs was observed. This observation induced the investigation of the effect of irradiation on the incorporation of carbon-14 in the whole tissue."

https://openalex.org/W1989073812,Bacon and Bell1 isolated and identified fructose in fœtal sheep's blood. This was the first conclusive proof of its existence prenatally. They also showed it disappears from the blood of the new-born lamb within three days of birth. During 1948 we performed experiments designed to throw some light on the mode of formation and site of origin of this fructose. Cæsarean section was performed under spinal anæsthetic supplemented by pentothal (which we find to be without effect on the blood sugar). The ewe was immersed in saline at 38° C. into which the fœtus was delivered. Blood samples were taken from the maternal dorsalis pedis artery and the umbilical vein. The total reducing substances and the fructose were estimated by the Somogyi–Nelson2 method and the Cole3 modification of the Roe's method respectively. The difference was taken as an approximate measure of the glucose.

https://openalex.org/W1923910407,"The various colorimetric methods now employed for the estimation of tryptophan are not specific for tryptophan but give colored products with many compounds containing the indole nucleus, including indole itself. In order to facilitate studies of the enzymatic synthesis of tryptophan from indole and serine by extracts of Neurospora (1), a search for a rapid, quantitative method for the estimation of tryptophan in the presence of indole was undertaken. Tauber (2) reported that tryptophan gives a green fluorescence when treated with 70 to 72 per cent perchloric acid at room temperature. Modification of this procedure has led to a method for the rapid estimation of tryptophan, without preliminary extraction of indole, in hydrolyzed or unhydrolyzed tryptophan-containing materials."

https://openalex.org/W2094527099,"SIMULTANEOUS recordings were made of the alpha rhythm and eye opening in response to an auditory stimulus, using a standard electroencephalograph apparatus. By plotting the number of responses against the phase of the alpha rhythm, a curve was obtained which showed a variation of more than 2 to 1 in the number of responses in different parts of the cycle. The exact distribution of the responses was examined by means of an electronic timing device, which registered a point in the alpha cycle by a signal of short duration, and the eye opening by a similar signal. The time interval between the signals was then measured by recording the charge gained by a condenser. The measurements confirmed that the probability of a response was not randomly distributed in time, but showed peaks and troughs recurring at approximately 10 per second and in accurate phase relations with the alpha rhythm. Similar results were obtained for other voluntary movements."

In the course of these investigations it has been possible to establish the undermentioned theorem, which has proved to be very useful in evaluating the factorial moments of many probability distributions of a discrete nature."

https://openalex.org/W2023526203,"AMONG the outstanding changes in the world since 1832, when the British Association first held a meeting at Newcastle upon Tyne, has been the great increase in population, its expectation of life and its standard of living. The numbers of human beings in the world is now estimated at 2,300 millions, and they are increasing at the ate of 20 millions a year. What are the prospects of man being able to provide the food necessary to meet such a rise in demand, what are the problems involved, and how is scientific discovery contributing to their solution? These are the subjects deals with by Sir John Russell in his presidential address to the British Association at Newcastle this year (see p. 379)."

https://openalex.org/W2037715240,"SENSITIVITY to carbon dioxide in Drosophila melanogaster is believed to depend on the presence in the cytoplasm of an agent which has been called a 'genoid'. As established by L'Heritier and Teissier1, males of the standard sensitive stock transmit genoids, therefore sensitivity, to a variable but important fraction of their progeny. Sensitive females transmit it to all their offspring."

However, except in special circumstances, permission to copy must be obtained from the copyright owner in every case, and this causes much tedious Correspondence and delays."
