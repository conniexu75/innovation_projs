https://openalex.org/W2044198642,"DNA mismatch correction is a strand-specific process involving recognition of noncomplementary Watson-Crick nucleotide pairs and participation of widely separated DNA sites. The Escherichia coli methyl-directed reaction has been reconstituted in a purified system consisting of MutH, MutL, and MutS proteins, DNA helicase II, single-strand DNA binding protein, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, exonuclease I, DNA ligase, along with ATP (adenosine triphosphate), and the four deoxynucleoside triphosphates. This set of proteins can process seven of the eight base-base mismatches in a strand-specific reaction that is directed by the state of methylation of a single d(GATC) sequence located 1 kilobase from the mispair."
https://openalex.org/W2070125667,"The cell-cycle timing of mitosis in fission yeast is determined by the cdc25+ gene product activating the p34cdc2 protein kinase leading to mitotic initiation. Protein kinase activity remains high in metaphase and then declines during anaphase. Activation of the protein kinase also requires the cyclin homolog p56cdc13, which also functions post activation at a later stage of mitosis. The continuing function of p56cdc13 during mitosis is consistent with its high level until the metaphase/anaphase transition. At anaphase the p56cdc13 level falls dramatically just before the decline in p34cdc2 protein kinase activity. The behavior of p56cdc13 is similar to that observed for cyclins in oocytes. p13suc1 interacts closely with p34cdc2; it is required during the process of mitosis and may play a role in the inactivation of the p34cdc2 protein kinase. Therefore, the cdc25+, cdc13+, and suc1+ gene products are important for regulating p34cdc2 protein kinase activity during entry into, progress through, and exit from mitosis."

https://openalex.org/W1994340275,"Membrane-exposed residues are more hydrophobic than buried interior residues in the transmembrane regions of the photosynthetic reaction center from Rhodobacter sphaeroides. This hydrophobic organization is opposite to that of water-soluble proteins. The relative polarities of interior and surface residues of membrane and water soluble proteins are not simply reversed, however. The hydrophobicities of interior residues of both membrane and water-soluble proteins are comparable, whereas the bilayer-exposed residues of membrane proteins are more hydrophobic than the interior residues, and the aqueous-exposed residues of water-soluble proteins are more hydrophilic than the interior residues. A method of sequence analysis is described, based on the periodicity of residue replacement in homologous sequences, that extends conclusions derived from the known atomic structure of the reaction center to the more extensive database of putative transmembrane helical sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2025162213,"The v-myb oncogene, like its cellular progenitor c-myb, encodes a short-lived nuclear protein involved in processes affecting growth and differentiation in a number of cell types. Fusion proteins, in which v-myb sequences are linked to the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcriptional activator GAL4, can activate transcription from a reporter gene linked in cis to a GAL4 binding site. The domain of v-myb responsible for transcriptional activation is located between residues 204 and 254, and is both necessary and sufficient for activation. Intact v-myb and c-myb proteins can also activate transcription, via a myb binding site linked in cis to a reporter gene. A v-myb protein bearing a deletion in the activator domain is no longer capable of stimulating transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1514815542,"Abstract In this report we describe the alteration of the N-linked oligosaccharide terminal sequences of Chinese hamster ovary cell glycoproteins by expression of a beta-galactoside alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase cDNA. While wild type cells normally produce sugar chains terminating in the NeuAc alpha 2,3Gal linkage, the expressed enzyme competes with the endogenous sialyltransferase to attach an alternative terminal sequence, NeuAc alpha 2,6Gal. Subcellular localization of the NeuAc alpha 2,6Gal product by lectin-gold electron microscopy revealed localization throughout the Golgi apparatus cis to trans, post-Golgi membranes and vesicular structures. The results demonstrate the potential for purposefully altering terminal carbohydrate structures in vivo by mis-expressing terminal glycosyltransferases that compete with the endogenous enzyme normally produced by the cells."
https://openalex.org/W1994666467,"Exposure of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to an 18-base c-myb antisense oligomer before mitogen or antigen stimulation resulted in almost complete inhibition of c-myb messenger RNA and protein synthesis and blockade of T lymphocyte proliferation. Expression of early and late activation markers, interleukin-2 receptor and transferrin receptor, respectively, by PBMC was unaffected by antisense oligomer exposure as was the expression of c-myc messenger RNA. In contrast, histone H3 messenger RNA levels and DNA content were selectively decreased. These results suggest that c-myb protein deprivation does not perturb T lymphocyte activation or early molecular events that may prepare the cell for subsequent proliferation. Rather, it appears to specifically block cells in late G1 or early S phase of the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2074045232,"Immunocytochemical techniques revealed that the ""liver-type"" glucose transporter is present in the insulin-producing beta cells of rat pancreatic islets but not in other islet endocrine cells. Ultrastructural analysis of the transporter by the protein A-gold technique showed that it is restricted to certain domains of the plasma membrane, its density being sixfold higher in microvilli facing adjacent endocrine cells than in the flat regions of the plasma membrane. These results support a possible role for this glucose transporter in glucose sensing by beta cells and provide evidence that these cells are polarized."
https://openalex.org/W2109748889,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) is implicated in the differentiation of neurons in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. As a new approach to its role in neuronal development, we have used transgenic mice to selectively overexpress NGF in an innervated peripheral tissue, the islets of the pancreas. In two lines of mice, directed expression of NGF in the beta cells elicits a dramatic increase in the innervation of the islets, but not the surrounding exocrine tissue, by one class of sympathetic neurons. In contrast, the innervation by sensory and parasympathetic neurons appears unchanged. The results indicate that expression of NGF by a target tissue during neuronal development selectively influences the characteristics of its innervation."
https://openalex.org/W1576655502,"Previously, the transfer of the phosphoryl group between the EnvZ and OmpR proteins, which are involved in activation of the ompF and ompC genes in response to the medium osmolarity, has been demonstrated in vitro. In this study, we characterized mutant EnvZ and OmpR proteins in terms of their in vitro phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The proteins isolated from the mutants, envZ11 and ompR3, were found to be defective in seemingly the same aspect, i.e. OmpR dephosphorylation. The protein isolated from the ompR77 mutant, which is a suppressor mutant specific for envZ11, was found to be defective in another aspect, i.e. OmpR phosphorylation. These results imply that the phosphotransfer reactions observed in vitro play roles in the mechanism underlying the osmoregulatory expression of the ompF and ompC genes in vivo. We provide evidence that the EnvZ protein is involved not only in OmpR phosphorylation but also in OmpR dephosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W1577530404,"A gene encoding cobalamin-dependent methionine synthase (EC 2.1.1.13) has been isolated from a plasmid library of Escherichia coli K-12 DNA by complementation to methionine prototrophy in an E. coli strain lacking both cobalamin-dependent and -independent methionine synthase activities (RK4536:metE, metHH). Maxicell expression of a series of plasmids containing deletions in the metH structural gene was employed to map the position and orientation of the gene on the cloned DNA fragment. A 6.3-kilobase EcoRI-SalI fragment containing the gene was cloned into the sequencing vector pGEM3B for double-stranded DNA sequencing; the MetH coding region consists of 3372 nucleotides. The enzyme was purified from an overproducing strain of E. coli harboring the recombinant plasmid, in which the level of methionine synthase was elevated 30- to 40-fold over wild-type E. coli. Recombinant enzyme is a protein of 123,640 molecular weight and has a turnover number of 1,450 min-1 in the standard assay. These values are to be compared with previously reported values of 133,000 for the molecular weight and 1,240-1,560 min-1 for the turnover number of the homogenous enzyme purified from a wild-type strain of E. coli B (Frasca, V., Banerjee, R. V., Dunham, W. R., Sands, R. H., and Matthews, R. G. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 8458-8465). Limited proteolysis of the native enzyme with trypsin resulted in loss of enzyme activity but retention of bound cobalamin on a peptide fragment of 28,000 molecular weight. This fragment has been shown to extend from residue 643 to residue 900 of the 1124-residue deduced amino acid sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1516181260,"Abstract Menaquinol-fumarate oxidoreductase of Escherichia coli is a four-subunit membrane-bound complex that catalyzes the final step in anaerobic respiration when fumarate is the terminal electron acceptor. The catalytic domain of fumarate reductase consists of the FrdA subunit, which contains the active site, and a FAD prosthetic group covalently attached to His44, plus the FrdB subunit which contains at least two of the three nonidentical iron-sulfur clusters of the enzyme. To examine the role of covalently bound FAD in enzyme activity and electron transfer during anaerobic cell growth, site-directed mutagenesis was used to alter His44 of the FrdA subunit to a Ser, Cys, or Tyr residue. The resulting mutant enzyme complexes that were synthesized associated normally with the cytoplasmic membrane, but had decreased ability (greater than 70%) to reduce fumarate with reduced benzyl viologen, an artificial electron donor of low redox potential (Em = -359 mV; Clark, W. M. (1972) Oxidation-Reduction Potentials of Organic Systems, Robert E. Kreiger Publishing Co., Melbourne, FL). Even lower activities were measured when the higher potential, natural electron donor menaquinol was used, which, however, correlated with the slower growth rates of the different mutant complexes. In contrast to the normal enzyme, the mutant enzyme complexes were unable to oxidize succinate. Substitution of Arg for His44 produced a totally inactive enzyme complex that permitted no cell growth on nonfermentable substrates with fumarate as electron acceptor. All four mutant complexes contained noncovalently bound FAD in stoichiometric amounts. These data indicate a unique role of the 8 alpha-[N(3)-histidyl] FAD linkage in enzyme activity, by raising the redox potential of free FAD to permit reduction by both menaquinol and succinate."
https://openalex.org/W2097399934,"We previously demonstrated that a point mutation in the last intron of the human H-ras oncogene causes a significant increase in its expression and transforming efficiency. Here we establish the basis of this phenomenon. Using gene reconstruction experiments, we have identified a negative-acting element in the intron that is completely inactivated by the mutation. The effects of other nucleotide alterations introduced into this region suggested that the negative element might constitute an alternative exon. Transcripts containing this putative exon were identified and S1 nuclease analysis confirmed that the mutation prevents their synthesis. The abundance of these transcripts is low, apparently due to message instability and/or defective processing. The predicted product of the alternative transcript is suggested to lack transforming potential. Our findings demonstrate that alternative splicing normally operates to suppress p21H-ras expression and that this negative control is abolished by a variety of mutations that interfere with this process."
https://openalex.org/W1639082415,"Abstract A 2.4-kilobase cDNA clone for human steroid-sulfatase (STS) was isolated and sequenced, which encoded an enzymatically active protein. The deduced amino acid sequence comprises 583 amino acids with an N-terminal signal peptide of 21 or 23 residues and four potential N-glycosylation sites. Two of the N-glycosylation sites are utilized and were localized to the asparagine residues 47 and 259. STS has the solubility properties of an integral membrane protein. The resistance of STS toward proteinase K after translocation into microsomes suggests that most, if not all, sequences of STS are exposed at the luminal side of microsomes. The deduced amino acid sequence predicts two membrane-spanning domains (amino acids 185-211 and 213-237) separated by a helix-breaking proline residue. We propose for STS a three-domain model. Two glycosylated luminally oriented domains of 161 and 346 residues are separated by a hydrophobic domain spanning the membrane twice in opposite directions. STS expressed in BHK-21 cells is located predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum; smaller fractions are found in the Golgi, at the cell surface, multivesicular endosomes, as well as in lysosomes. The stability of STS in lysosomes may be related to the high homology of the two luminal domains of STS with the lysosomal sulfatases, arylsulfatase A, and arylsulfatase B. In spite of its similarity with these two lysosomal sulfatases, STS does not contain mannose 6-phosphate residues and is transported to lysosomes by a mannose 6-phosphate receptor-independent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2053373192,The helical filament that the RecA protein of Escherichia coli forms around DNA is the active apparatus in protein-catalyzed homologous genetic recombination. The actual position of DNA within this complex has been unknown. Image analysis has been performed on electron micrographs of filaments of RecA on double-stranded DNA and on single-stranded DNA to visualize a difference that is consistent with one strand of the double-stranded DNA. This localization of the DNA gives additional information about the unusual structure of DNA in the complex with RecA protein.
https://openalex.org/W1515794053,"In this study, we have investigated the structural and physical properties of the bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase accessory proteins. We find that T4 gene 44 and 62 proteins associate to form a tight, highly homogeneous complex, containing four gene 44 protein subunits and one gene 62 protein subunit. The molecular mass of the complex is 163,700 daltons. Sedimentation results suggest that the complex is quite asymmetric, with a prolate ellipsoid axial ratio of about 5:1. This protein complex is known to carry a DNA-dependent ATPase activity; we show by photoaffinity labeling that the ATP-binding sites reside in the gene 44 protein subunits of the complex. Equilibrium sedimentation and chemical cross-linking studies indicate that the T4 gene 45 protein self-associates to form a trimer in solution. This trimer species also appears to be quite asymmetric, showing an axial ratio for a prolate ellipsoid of about 6:1, assuming normal hydration."
https://openalex.org/W1593107187,"Abstract Vibrio cholera toxin and the heat-labile enterotoxin of Escherichia coli have been shown to differ somewhat in their ligand specificity and in the antigenicity of their binding sites. Therefore, the components of the oligosaccharide portion of GM1 bound by cholera toxin and the heat-labile enterotoxin of E. coli were identified by determining the concentration of GM1, derivatives of GM1, oligosaccharide isolated from GM1, or clustered oligosaccharide needed to inhibit toxin binding to GM1-coated plastic wells. The KIs for GM1, the C(7) sialosyl alcohol [corrected] of GM1, and ethanolamine-sialosyl-GM1 were similar (approximately 30-50 nM) for both toxins. N-Deacetylation of GM1 resulted in a small increase in KI; formation of the sialosyl methyl ester increased the KI 2-5 fold; loss of the terminal galactosyl residue (GM2) increased the KI by 10-15-fold; and removal of the sialosyl moiety (asialo-GM1) resulted in loss of inhibition of both toxins. Oligosaccharide isolated from GM1 had a KI for both toxins that was approximately 100-fold greater than that obtained for GM1 and approximately 1000-fold greater than that for a clustered oligosaccharide derivative having an average of 8 oligosaccharide residues (isolated from GM1) per molecule of poly-L-lysine. These results indicate that both toxins are functionally quite similar in their recognition of GM1 as a ligand in that each requires the free carboxyl group of sialic acid for optimum binding, does not need carbons 8 and 9 of the sialosyl moiety nor the acetyl groups associated with the sialic acid and galactosamine residues, and can have its binding to GM1 blocked by a nonlipid compound, i.e. oligo-GM1-poly-L-lysine."

https://openalex.org/W1558631456,"Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is a multifunctional microsomal enzyme that participates in the formation of protein disulfide bonds. PDI catalyzes the reduction of protein disulfide bonds in the presence of excess reduced glutathione and has been implicated in the reductive degradation of insulin; E. coli thioredoxin is homologous to two regions in PDI and can also degrade insulin. PDI activity, measured by 125I-insulin degradation or reactivation of randomly oxidized RNase in the presence of reduced glutathione, is non-competitively inhibited by estrogens; half-maximal inhibition was observed at approximately 100 nM estrogen. Other steroid hormones at 1 microM had little or no effect. PDI segment 120-163 (which corresponds to exon 3 of the PDI gene) and 182-230 have significant similarity with estrogen receptor segments 350-392 and 304-349, respectively, located in the estrogen binding domain but not with the steroid domains of the progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors or with thioredoxin, which is insensitive to estrogens. We propose the hypothesis that enzymes can acquire sensitivity to a hormone via exon shuffling to the enzyme gene from the DNA region coding for the hormone binding domain of the hormone's receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1570417326,"We have purified DNA photolyase from the autotrophic anaerobic archaebacterium Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum to near homogeneity by a two-column affinity chromatography. The purified enzyme has an Mr = 60,000 and shows near UV absorption peak at 440 nm and a fluorescence emission maximum at 462 nm indicating that it contains 8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin (coenzyme F420) as an intrinsic chromophore. The photolyase binds with high specificity to thymine dimer in DNA with an equilibrium binding constant, KA = 1.4 x 10(9) M-1, and a dissociation rate constant, koff = 1.4 x 10(-4) s-1 (t1/2 = 43 min). Despite 6-fold higher affinity compared to the folate-containing Escherichia coli photolyase the two enzymes apparently contact the same phosphates around the thymine dimer: the phosphate immediately 5' and the three phosphates immediately 3' to the dimer on the damaged strand and the phosphate across from the dimer in the minor groove on the complementary strand. The absolute action spectrum of the Methanobacterium photolyase in the 400-500-nm region closely matches the absorption of the enzyme-bound F420. The quantum yield (phi) over this region is constant and is approximately 0.2. The value is measurably smaller than the quantum yields reported for other DNA photolyases."
https://openalex.org/W1546069399,"It has been proposed that an elevation in cytosolic free Ca2+ may play a role in either mediating or antagonizing the ability of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake in adipocytes. This question has been addressed in the present studies using isolated fura-2-loaded rat adipocytes stimulated with a variety of agonists. The effects of insulin, oxytocin, norepinephrine, ATP, and ionomycin on cytosolic free Ca2+ levels were assessed and compared with their effects on transport-limited glucose oxidation. Oxytocin and ionomycin at concentrations which caused 3-5-fold increases in cytosolic Ca2+, by releasing Ca2+ from internal stores, had no effect on insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation. ATP and norepinephrine which caused more modest increases in Ca2+, by mechanisms at least partially dependent on external stores, inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation. Insulin had no effect on basal Ca2+ levels nor did it modulate the Ca2+ elevation caused by other agonists. These data suggest that insulin-stimulated glucose transport is not associated with an increase in cytosolic Ca2+. In addition, although there appears to be a correlation between inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport and the effect of certain agonists to promote Ca2+ influx, there is not a general obligatory relationship between an elevation in cytosolic Ca2+ and antagonism of this insulin action."
https://openalex.org/W2033799802,"Distal effects on the in vivo repression of the deo operon are thought to be mediated by the deoR repressor with DNA loop formation. Such loops are easily observed by electron microscopy when the oligomeric deoR repressor is added to a DNA fragment carrying the three genetically defined operators at their chromosomal distances. Upon binding of deoR to any two operators, single loops are formed, 280, 600, and 880 bp in size. With the deo operon, double loops are also formed, which are the combination of the 280 bp and 600 bp loops and the result of simultaneous binding of the protein to its three sites. The formation of both single and double loops is consistent with the long-range effects observed in vivo and with the cooperative involvement of all three operator sites in the repression."
https://openalex.org/W1597692828,"A murine monoclonal antibody, named anti-Fy6, which agglutinates all human red cells except those of Fy(a-b) phenotype was used for purification and characterization of Duffy antigens. Duffy antigens are multimeric red cell membrane proteins composed of different subunits of which only one, designated pD protein, reacts in immunoblots with the murine monoclonal antibody anti-Fy6. Affinity-purified detergent-soluble antigen-antibody complex obtained from red cells, surface-labeled with 125I yielded a complex pattern of bands when separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins that react with anti-Fy6 in immunoblots are: pA and pB (> 100 kDa) and pD (36–46 kDa). Electroeluted pD protein aggregates and generates bands of similar molecular mass to pA and pB proteins. Electroeluted pA and pB proteins disaggregate yielding pD protein. Oligomers and monomers of pD protein are present in red cells carrying Duffy antigens and absent in Fy(a-b-) cells. Six other proteins of molecular weight ranging from 68 to 21 kDa either associate or co-purify with pD protein. These proteins are only present in Duffy antigen positive cells. The pD protein is different in Fy(a+b-) and Fy(a-b+) cells by fingerprint analysis. Human antisera identify the same proteins in red cell carrying Duffy antigens as the murine monoclonal antibody anti-Fy6."
https://openalex.org/W1650161687,"An oxidized pterin species, termed compound Z, has been isolated from molybdenum cofactor-deficient mutants of Escherichia coli and shown to be the direct product of oxidation of a molybdopterin precursor which accumulates in these mutants. The complete structural characterization of compound Z has been accomplished. A carbonyl function at C-1' of the 6-alkyl side chain can be reacted with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine to yield a phenylhydrazone and can be reduced with borohydride, producing a mixture of two enantiomers, each with a hydroxyl group on C-1'. Compound Z contains one phosphate/pterin and no sulfur. The phosphate group is insensitive to alkaline phosphatase and to a number of phosphodiesterases but is quantitatively released as inorganic phosphate by mild acid hydrolysis. From 31P and 1H NMR of compound Z it was inferred that the phosphate is bound to C-2' and C-4' of a 4-carbon side chain, forming a 6-membered cyclic structure. Mass spectral analysis showed an MH+ ion with an exact mass of 344.0401 corresponding to the molecular formula C10H11N5O7P, confirming the proposed structure."

The structures of the major components with diesterified phosphate were assigned as follows (where M = mannose), according to a recently revised oligosaccharide structure for the mnn mutants (Hernandez, L. M., Ballou, L., Alvarado, E., Gillece-Castro, B. L., Burlingame, A. L., and Ballou, C. E. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 11849-11856). formula; see text The monoester derivatives were mixtures of the possible isomers produced by removal of one or the other phosphoglycosyl-linked mannose units, and they were shown to arise by chemical degradation during isolation. The mnn1 mnn2 mnn10 acidic oligosaccharide fraction contained a mono- and a diphosphate ester. The monophosphate consisted predominantly of a single isomer with a mannosyl phosphate unit located at the end of the outer chain in an oligosaccharide with the following structure, where x may range from 2 to 12. The diphosphate had a mannosyl phosphate in this formula; see text position as well as one on the terminal alpha 1----6-linked mannose in the core. The presence in the mnn1 mnn9 or mnn1 mnn2 mnn10 background of the mnn4 or mnn6 mutations, which are known to regulate phosphorylation in yeast, reduced phosphorylation by 90% but did not eliminate it.

https://openalex.org/W1602904527,"Abstract The light-stimulated production of inositol triphosphate (IP3), via hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2), can be demonstrated in an in vitro preparation of isolated distal segments of squid photoreceptors. The retina is labeled with [3H]inositol (Szuts, E. Z., Wood, S. F., Reid, M. S., and Fein, A. (1986) Biochem. J. 240, 929-932), and the rhodopsin-containing distal segments are isolated in artificial cytosol. Within 2 s after a flash, IP3 levels increase 200% (corresponding to an intracellular increase of approximately 5 microM), and the lipid precursor PIP2 decreases by 50%. Inositol bisphosphate (IP2) levels increase later, as a breakdown product of IP3. IP3 response is light-dependent, saturating when 0.5% of the rhodopsin is photoactivated. Guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate (GTP gamma S) binding demonstrates that the plasma membrane of most of the photoreceptor distal segments is intact or only transiently permeable. Membrane permeabilization enhances light-activated GTP gamma S binding but abolishes the light-activated IP3 production. Receptor-mediated production of IP3 is believed to be the result of a receptor-G-protein-phospholipase C cascade (i.e. Cockcroft, S., and Gomperts, B. D. (1985) Nature 314, 534-536). To test for G-proteins, we incubated the photoreceptors in AlF4- (an activator of G-proteins) in the dark. IP3 and IP2 were produced with a corresponding decrease in PIP2. Incubation with GTP or GTP gamma S, in hypotonic buffer, which causes transient leakiness, increased dark levels by IP3 by 50%. Addition of GTP in isotonic buffer enhanced the light-induced increase of IP3. These results localize the light-stimulated phospholipase C activity to the distal segments and suggest that a G-protein couples rhodopsin to phospholipase C."
https://openalex.org/W2040906030,"The origin of allostery is an unanswered question in the evolution of complex regulatory proteins. Anabolic ornithine transcarbamoylase, a trimer of identical subunits, is not an allosteric enzyme per se. However, when the active-site residue arginine-106 of the Escherichia coli enzyme is replaced with a glycine through site-directed mutagenesis, the resultant mutant enzyme manifests substrate cooperativity that is absent in the wild-type enzyme. Both homotropic and heterotropic interactions occur in the mutant enzyme. The initial velocity saturation curves of the substrates, carbamoyl phosphate and L-ornithine, conform to the Hill equation. The observed cooperativity depends on substrate but not enzyme concentration. The finding underscores the possibility that a single mutation of the enzyme in the cell could turn transcarbamoylation into a regulatory junction in the biosynthesis of L-arginine and urea."

https://openalex.org/W1863318531,"Binding of a murine N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)-specific IgG3 monoclonal antibody to a solid phase expressing GlcNAc determinants and phosphocholine (PC) determinants is enhanced by IgG3, but not IgG2b, PC-specific monoclonal antibody. The cooperative binding requires an intact Fc region on the GlcNAc-specific monoclonal antibody and is hypothesized to result from Fc-Fc association. Although the in vivo relevance of this phenomenon requires further study, intermolecular cooperativity in binding of antibody to multivalent antigens, such as bacterial cell wall antigens, could represent an adaptive mechanism for antibodies expressing low intrinsic affinities for highly repeated epitopes. Furthermore, the ability of antibodies of distinct specificity to participate in cooperative binding offers, at least in principle, new approaches to optimizing antibody targeting.—Greenspan, N.

https://openalex.org/W1550254361,"Translational frameshifts, both +1 and −1, are promoted by mutations in tufA and tufB, the two genes encoding the polypeptide chain elongation factor (EF) Tu of Escherichia coli. Strains harboring the mutant EF-Tu(Ala375→Thr) encoded by either tufA or tufB or by both, display a linear relationship between the frequency of frameshifting and the concentration of mutant EF-Tu, relative to the total amount of EF-Tu. A second mutant species, EF-TuB(Gly222→Asp), also promotes frameshifting. The frequency is strikingly enhanced by the combined action of EF-TuA(Ala375→Thr) and EF-TuB(Gly222→Asp) and exceeds by far the total contribution of the two mutant EF-Tus studied separately. These observations raise the question whether the formation of each peptide bond under conditions that no frameshifting occurs also requires the combined action of two EF-Tu molecules, in this case not differing functionally."

https://openalex.org/W1481799054,"Abstract The product of the cell cycle control gene cdc2 is required in yeast for transition through both G1 and G2 control points of the cell cycle. The homologous protein in higher eukaryotes has been shown to be a component of the mitosis promoting factor complex and may thus regulate entry through the G2 control point into mitosis. It is suggested from the work presented here that, as in yeast, the human CDC2Hs gene product (p34CDC2Hs) may also play a role in cell cycle control in the G1(G0) phase of the cell cycle. Interferon-alpha inhibits the growth of the human B-cell line Daudi in the G1(G0) phase of the cell cycle and prevents cells from entering S-phase. Culturing the cells with interferon-alpha inhibits the phosphorylation of p34CDC2Hs and causes the down-regulation of CDC2Hs mRNA. Phorbol ester also inhibits the Daudi cell cycle in G1(G0) and causes the inhibition of p34CDC2Hs phosphorylation and a reduction of CDC2Hs mRNA. These studies provide insights into the process of growth control and the cytostatic mechanism of interferon-alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1486096220,"Abstract We have previously shown that the sulfonylureas increase insulin-stimulated glucose transport in adipocytes mainly by enhancing the insulin-induced recruitment of glucose transporter from its intracellular storage pool to the plasma membrane (Jacobs, D. B., and Jung, C. Y. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 2593-2596). In order to determine if this sulfonylurea effect is mediated by a specific membrane-associated sulfonylurea-binding protein, in the present report we measured exact dose dependence of the transport enhancement activities of different sulfonylureas in adipocytes in primary culture and equilibrium binding affinities of these agents to various adipocyte membrane fractions. Glycuride was found to increase the insulin-stimulated, 3-O-methyl-D-glucose equilibrium exchange in cultured rat adipocytes by up to 60% with little effect in the absence of insulin. The effect developed gradually reaching the maximum level at 24 h of incubation. The effect was concentration dependent showing a simple, one-to-one stoichiometry and an apparent activation constant (Ka) of approximately 1 microM. Glypizide, tolazamide, and tolbutamide also enhanced the insulin-stimulated hexose transport by up to 60%, but with Ka of approximately 2, 11, and 25 microM, respectively. HB-699 and ciglitazone, non-sulfonylureas, were without effect under the same condition. In equilibrium binding experiments, [3H]glyburide was found to bind to adipocyte membranes at two or more protein-specific, saturable sites, with similar apparent dissociation constants (KD) ranging 1-3 microM. These protein-specific glyburide bindings were displaced not only by tolazamide and tolbutamide, but also by ciglitazone and HB-699, with indicated KD of 11-16, 80-85, 20-25, and 85-95 microM, respectively. However, with the plasma membrane fraction, the displacements by ciglitazone and HB-699 were partial and did not exceed 56-61% at maximum. Based on these findings, we propose that there is a sulfonylurea-specific-binding protein in the plasma membrane of adipocytes, and that this sulfonylurea-binding protein may play a key role in the enhancement of insulin-stimulated hexose transport by sulfonylureas, probably via potentiation of the insulin-induced recruitment of glucose transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1522045405,"We have purified and characterized a single-stranded DNA binding protein (N4 SSB) induced after coliphage N4 infection. It has a monomeric molecular weight of 31,000 and contains 10 tyrosine and 1-2 tryptophan amino acid residues. Its fluorescence spectrum is dominated by the tyrosine residues, and their fluorescence is quenched when the protein binds single-stranded DNA. Fluorescence quenching was used as an assay to quantitate binding of the protein to single-stranded nucleotides. The N4 single-stranded DNA binding protein binds cooperatively to single-stranded nucleic acids and binds single-stranded DNA more tightly than RNA. The binding involves displacement of cations from the DNA and anions from the protein. The apparent binding affinity is very salt-dependent, decreasing as much as 1,000-fold for a 10-fold increase in NaCl concentration. The degree of cooperativity (omega) is relatively independent of salt concentration. At 37 degrees C in 0.22 M NaCl, the protein has an intrinsic binding constant for M13 viral DNA of 3.8 x 10(4) M-1, a cooperativity factor omega of 300, and binding site size of 11 nucleotides per monomer. The protein lowers the melting point of poly(dA.dT).poly(dA-dT) by greater than 60 degrees C but cannot lower the melting transition or assist in the renaturation of natural DNA. N4 single-stranded DNA binding protein enhances the rate of DNA synthesis catalyzed by the N4 DNA polymerase by increasing the processivity of the N4 DNA polymerase and melting out hairpin structures that block polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W1558240830,"Abstract Murine monocytic leukemic (M1) cells were cultured in the presence of [3H]glucosamine and [35S]sulfate. Labeled proteoglycans were purified by anion exchange chromatography and characterized by gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in combination with chemical and enzymatic degradation. M1 cells synthesize a single predominant species of proteoglycan which distributes almost equally between the cell and medium after 17 h labeling. The cell-associated proteoglycan has an overall size of about 135 kDa and contains three to five chondroitin sulfate chains (28-31 kDa each) attached to a chondroitinase-generated core protein of 28 kDa. The synthesis and subsequent secretion of this proteoglycan was enhanced 4-5-fold in cells induced to differentiate into macrophages. This was not a phenomenon of arrest in the G0/G1 stage of the cell cycle, since density inhibited undifferentiated cells arrested at this stage did not increase proteoglycan synthesis. The chondroitin sulfate chains contained exclusively chondroitin 4- and 6-sulfate; however, the ratio of these two disaccharides differed between the medium- and cell-associated proteoglycans, and changed during progression of the cells into a fully differentiated phenotype. Pulse-chase kinetics indicate the presence of two distinct pools of proteoglycan; one that is secreted very rapidly from the cell after a approximately 1-h lag, and a second pool that is turned over in the cell with a half-time of approximately 3.5 h. Subtle differences in the glycosylation patterns of the medium- and cell-associated species are consistent with synthesis of two pools. Papain digestion suggests that the chondroitin sulfate chains are clustered on a small protease resistant peptide. The data suggest that this proteoglycan is similar to the serglycin proteoglycan family."
https://openalex.org/W1544872447,"Injection of bestatin into intact mice produces accumulation of di- and tripeptide intermediates in the degradation of short- and long-lived hepatic proteins, whereas lysosomal breakdown of endocytosed plasma asialoglycoproteins is not affected. The majority of the peptides are found in the liver cytosol, but a minor portion appears in a sedimentable fraction containing mitochondria and lysosomes (Botbol, V., and Scornik, O. A. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 1942–1949). We now report that (a) the primary location of the intermediates is the cytosol. The particulate fraction represents cytosolic peptides trapped within mitochondria, as evidenced by sedimentation equilibrium in sucrose gradients after loading lysosomes with Triton WR1339 and by the sensitivity of the particles to lysis by digitonin. (b) In isolated hepatocytes, where we can measure simultaneously protein breakdown and bestatin-induced peptides, the accumulation of intermediates parallels protein degradation of analog-containing, short- and long-lived proteins, even after stimulation of the latter by amino acid deprivation. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that bestatin inhibits cytosolic exopeptidases that complete the intracellular breakdown to amino acids of the major classes of hepatic proteins. The role of cytosolic exopeptidases is expected in the rapid degradation of abnormal proteins, a demonstrated cytosolic process. In stimulated degradation of long-lived proteins, the importance of cytosolic exopeptidases implies either that this process is largely cytosolic or, more likely, that peptides escape from autophagic organelles."
https://openalex.org/W1488068074,"We isolated a mutant strain of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli by nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis, which produces an immunologically altered B subunit of heat-labile enterotoxin. This mutant B subunit was detected as a monomer on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis even without prior heating, suggesting a problem in oligomer formation. Furthermore, this mutant B subunit could not form holotoxin with the native A subunit, and the affinity to GM1-ganglioside receptor was 10-fold lower than that of the native B subunit. The amino acid sequence analysis of this mutant B subunit revealed only one amino acid substitution compared with the native B subunit, at the 64th position from the N terminus (valine instead of alanine). These data suggest that the alanine at position 64 from the N terminus is important for the native B subunit to form an oligomer structure and express its functions."
https://openalex.org/W1608373451,"Abstract Single amino acid substitutions have been introduced throughout the N-terminal DNA binding region of the Mnt repressor, and the operator binding properties of the resulting mutant repressors have been assayed. These studies show that the side chains of Arg2, His6, Asn8, and Arg10 are critical for high affinity binding to operator DNA. Other side chains in the N-terminal region do not appear to play major roles in DNA recognition and binding. Specific alterations in the pattern of methylation protection afforded by the Arg2----Lys mutant protein suggest that Arg2 contacts the N7 groups of guanines 10 and 12 in the operator. In conjunction with previous results, these findings suggest that part of the N-terminal region of Mnt binds as an extended polypeptide strand within the major groove of the mnt operator."

Good quality crystals appear spontaneously only from a protein solution that had been stored for more than a year at 4 degrees C, although large single crystals are reproducibly obtained from fresh protein solutions by micro-seeding. The space group is P6(3)22 (a = b = 123.8 A, c = 81.6 A), with one monomer of the enzyme (34.5 kDa) in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. The crystals are well ordered and diffract to beyond 2 A resolution."
