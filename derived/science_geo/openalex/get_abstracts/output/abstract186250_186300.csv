Inelastic neutron scattering spectroscopy of the rotational transitions of the adsorbed hydrogen molecules indicates the presence of two well-defined binding sites (termed I and II), which we associate with hydrogen binding to zinc and the BDC linker, respectively. Preliminary studies on topologically similar isoreticular metal-organic framework-6 and -8 (IRMOF-6 and -8) having cyclobutylbenzene and naphthalene linkers, respectively, gave approximately double and quadruple (2.0 weight percent) the uptake found for MOF-5 at room temperature and 10 bar."

To investigate how insulin resistance arises, we studied healthy, lean, elderly and young participants matched for lean body mass and fat mass. Elderly study participants were markedly insulin-resistant as compared with young controls, and this resistance was attributable to reduced insulin-stimulated muscle glucose metabolism. These changes were associated with increased fat accumulation in muscle and liver tissue assessed by 1 Hnuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and with a ∼40% reduction in mitochondrial oxidative and phosphorylation activity, as assessed by in vivo 13 C/ 31 P NMR spectroscopy. These data support the hypothesis that an age-associated decline in mitochondrial function contributes to insulin resistance in the elderly."

Here we investigated the hypothesis that tumor response to radiation is determined not only by tumor cell phenotype but also by microvascular sensitivity. MCA/129 fibrosarcomas and B16F1 melanomas grown in apoptosis-resistant acid sphingomyelinase ( asmase )–deficient or Bax -deficient mice displayed markedly reduced baseline microvascular endothelial apoptosis and grew 200 to 400% faster than tumors on wild-type microvasculature. Thus, endothelial apoptosis is a homeostatic factor regulating angiogenesis-dependent tumor growth. Moreover, these tumors exhibited reduced endothelial apoptosis upon irradiation and, unlike tumors in wild-type mice, they were resistant to single-dose radiation up to 20 grays (Gy). These studies indicate that microvascular damage regulates tumor cell response to radiation at the clinically relevant dose range."

Reducing hsf-1 activity accelerates tissue aging and shortens life-span, and we show that hsf-1 overexpression extends lifespan. We find that HSF-1, like the transcription factor DAF-16, is required for daf-2-insulin/IGF-1 receptor mutations to extend life-span. Our findings suggest this is because HSF-1 and DAF-16 together activate expression of specific genes, including genes encoding small heat-shock proteins, which in turn promote longevity. The small heat-shock proteins also delay the onset of polyglutamine-expansion protein aggregation, suggesting that these proteins couple the normal aging process to this type of age-related disease."
https://openalex.org/W2139235078,"The isotropic magnetic moment of a free atom is shown to develop giant magnetic anisotropy energy due to symmetry reduction at an atomically ordered surface. Single cobalt atoms deposited onto platinum (111) are found to have a magnetic anisotropy energy of 9 millielectron volts per atom arising from the combination of unquenched orbital moments (1.1 Bohr magnetons) and strong spin-orbit coupling induced by the platinum substrate. By assembling cobalt nanoparticles containing up to 40 atoms, the magnetic anisotropy energy is further shown to be dependent on single-atom coordination changes. These results confirm theoretical predictions and are of fundamental value to understanding how magnetic anisotropy develops in finite-sized magnetic particles."

The individual junction bias currents are used to control the interaction between the qubits by tuning the energy level spacings of the junctions in and out of resonance with each other. Microwave spectroscopy in the 4 to 6 gigahertzrange at 20 millikelvin reveals energy levels that agree well with theoretical results for entangled states. The single qubits are spatially separate, and the entangled states extend over the 0.7-millimeter distance between the two qubits."
https://openalex.org/W2129159015,"The MW (moment magnitude) 7.9 Denali fault earthquake on 3 November 2002 was associated with 340 kilometers of surface rupture and was the largest strike-slip earthquake in North America in almost 150 years. It illuminates earthquake mechanics and hazards of large strike-slip faults. It began with thrusting on the previously unrecognized Susitna Glacier fault, continued with right-slip on the Denali fault, then took a right step and continued with right-slip on the Totschunda fault. There is good correlation between geologically observed and geophysically inferred moment release. The earthquake produced unusually strong distal effects in the rupture propagation direction, including triggered seismicity."
https://openalex.org/W2009423342,"Processes in the soil remain among the least well-characterized components of the carbon cycle. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are ubiquitous root symbionts in many terrestrial ecosystems and account for a large fraction of photosynthate in a wide range of ecosystems; they therefore play a key role in the terrestrial carbon cycle. A large part of the fungal mycelium is outside the root (the extraradical mycelium, ERM) and, because of the dispersed growth pattern and the small diameter of the hyphae (<5 micrometers), exceptionally difficult to study quantitatively. Critically, the longevity of these fine hyphae has never been measured, although it is assumed to be short. To quantify carbon turnover in these hyphae, we exposed mycorrhizal plants to fossil (""carbon-14-dead"") carbon dioxide and collected samples of ERM hyphae (up to 116 micrograms) over the following 29 days. Analyses of their carbon-14 content by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) showed that most ERM hyphae of AM fungi live, on average, 5 to 6 days. This high turnover rate reveals a large and rapid mycorrhizal pathway of carbon in the soil carbon cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2084786391,"The 3 November 2002 moment magnitude 7.9 Denali fault earthquake generated large, permanent surface displacements in Alaska and large-amplitude surface waves throughout western North America. We find good agreement between strong ground-motion records integrated to displacement and 1-hertz Global Positioning System (GPS) position estimates collected approximately 140 kilometers from the earthquake epicenter. One-hertz GPS receivers also detected seismic surface waves 750 to 3800 kilometers from the epicenter, whereas these waves saturated many of the seismic instruments in the same region. High-frequency GPS increases the dynamic range and frequency bandwidth of ground-motion observations, providing another tool for studying earthquake processes."
https://openalex.org/W2136535147,"Asymmetric divisions are crucial for generating cell diversity; they rely on coupling between polarity cues and spindle positioning, but how this coupling is achieved is poorly understood. In one-cell stage Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, polarity cues set by the PAR proteins mediate asymmetric spindle positioning by governing an imbalance of net pulling forces acting on spindle poles. We found that the GoLoco-containing proteins GPR-1 and GPR-2, as well as the Galpha subunits GOA-1 and GPA-16, were essential for generation of proper pulling forces. GPR-1/2 interacted with guanosine diphosphate-bound GOA-1 and were enriched on the posterior cortex in a par-3- and par-2-dependent manner. Thus, the extent of net pulling forces may depend on cortical Galpha activity, which is regulated by anterior-posterior polarity cues through GPR-1/2."
https://openalex.org/W2102499833,"Previous measurements of the hydroxyl (OH-) ion content of the calcium phosphate crystals of bone mineral have indicated a substantial depletion or near-absence of OH-, despite its presumed status as a constituent of the hydroxyapatite lattice. Analytical methods for determining bone crystal OH- content have depended on procedures or assumptions that may have biased the results, such as chemical pretreatment to eliminate interference from the organic matrix. We demonstrate a two-dimensional solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy technique that detects the proton spectrum of bone crystals while suppressing the interfering matrix signals, eliminating the need for specimen pretreatment other than cryogenic grinding. Results on fresh-frozen and ground whole bone of several mammalian species show that the bone crystal OH- is readily detectable; a rough estimate yields an OH- content of human cortical bone of about 20% of the amount expected in stoichiometric hydroxyapatite. This finding sheds light on the biochemical processes underlying normal and abnormal bone mineral metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1977560741,"Ubiquitylation is used to target proteins into a large number of different biological processes including proteasomal degradation, endocytosis, virus budding, and vacuolar protein sorting (Vps). Ubiquitylated proteins are typically recognized using one of several different conserved ubiquitin binding modules. Here, we report the crystal structure and ubiquitin binding properties of one such module, the ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM). We found that UIM peptides from several proteins involved in endocytosis and vacuolar protein sorting including Hrs, Vps27p, Stam1, and Eps15 bound specifically, but with modest affinity (K d = 0.1–1 mm), to free ubiquitin. Full affinity ubiquitin binding required the presence of conserved acidic patches at the N and C terminus of the UIM, as well as highly conserved central alanine and serine residues. NMR chemical shift perturbatio nmapping experiments demonstrated that all of these UIM peptides bind to the I44 surface of ubiquitin. The 1.45 Å resolution crystal structure of the second yeast Vps27p UIM (Vps27p-2) revealed that the ubiquitin-interacting motif forms an amphipathic helix. Although Vps27p-2 is monomeric in solution, the motif unexpectedly crystallized as an antiparallel four-helix bundle, and the potential biological implications of UIM oligomerization are therefore discussed.

The small protein ubiquitin can be ligated through its C terminus to the lysine side chains of acceptor proteins in a process of post-translational modification called ubiquitylation (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6955) Google Scholar). In the case of monoubiquitylation, a single ubiquitin is added to the target protein, whereas in other cases the attached ubiquitin is itself ubiquitylated to build a polyubiquitin chain on the acceptor protein. Ubiquitylation plays a critical role in maintaining protein homeostasis in the cell because it serves to target proteins for both proteasomal and lysosomal degradation (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6955) Google Scholar, 2Hicke L. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 107-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). It has recently become clear that protein ubiquitylation also plays important roles in a large number of other biological processes, including DNA repair, transcription, translation, signal transduction, organelle assembly, protein trafficking, and virus budding (3Pickart C.M. Mol Cell. 2001; 8: 499-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Thus, it is of general importance to understand how cells recognize and sort ubiquitylated proteins. The recognition of ubiquitylated proteins is frequently mediated by conserved ubiquitin binding modules, which include the UIM 1The abbreviations used are: UIM, ubiquitin-interacting motif; EGF, epidermal growth factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization; RMSD, root mean-squared deviation; Vps, vacuolar protein sorting.

Each of these motifs can bind ubiquitin in vitro, and the motifs are used in a modular fashion to add ubiquitin binding activities to a large variety of multifunctional proteins. Thus, understanding how ubiquitylated proteins are recognized and sorted within cells will require a full description of the structures and ubiquitin interactions of the different conserved ubiquitin binding modules. The UIM was originally identified based upon studies of the S5a subunit of the 19 S regulator in the human 26 S proteasome (17Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical and mutational analyses revealed that S5a (also called rpn10) contains two copies of a ∼30-residue sequence motif (initially denoted pUbS) that can bind ubiquitylated protein and polyubiquitin chains (5Young P. Deveraux Q. Beal R.E. Pickart C.M. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5461-5467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 17Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same region of S5a also appears to mediate contacts with ubiquitin-like proteins (18Hiyama H. Yokoi M. Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Maekawa T. Tanaka K. Hoeijmakers J.H. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28019-28025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 19Walters K.J. Kleijnen M.F. Goh A.M. Wagner G. Howley P.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1767-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The pUbS motifs have hydrophobic core sequences composed of alternating large and small residues (Leu-Ala-Leu-Ala-Leu) that are flanked on both sides by patches of acidic residues. Sequence analyses and iterative data base searches based upon the original pUbS motif have been used to define a more general UIM, which is found in a number of different proteins that function in a variety of biological pathways (4Hofmann K.F.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 347-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). These sequence analyses have also provided a more precise definition of the UIM as a 20 residue sequence corresponding to the consensus: X-Ac-Ac-Ac-Ac-Φ-X-X-Ala-X-X-X-Ser-X-X-Ac-X-X-X-X, where Φ represents a large hydrophobic residue (typically Leu), Ac represents an acidic residue (Glu, Asp), and X represents residues that are less well conserved (4Hofmann K.F.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 347-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). UIMs are particularly prevalent in proteins that function in the pathways of endocytosis and vacuolar protein sorting (4Hofmann K.F.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 347-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). These two linked pathways serve to sort membrane-associated proteins and their cargo from the plasma membrane (or Golgi) for eventual destruction (or localization) in the lysosome (yeast vacuole). Unlike proteasomal protein targeting, which requires at least a tetraubiquitin chain (20Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar), monoubiquitylation is sufficient to mark proteins for both endocytosis and lysosomal trafficking (21Terrell J. Shih S. Dunn R.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 347-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). These proteins are all required for endocytosis of receptor: ligand complexes, including the complex of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) with its receptor (EGFR) (27Shih S.C. Katzmann D.J.

Nature. 1998; 394: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Recent work from several laboratories has demonstrated that the UIMs in these proteins can bind ubiquitin in vitro and play essential roles in vivo, as deletion or mutation of the UIM sequences blocks receptor internalization (26Polo S. Sigismund S. Faretta M. Guidi M. Capua M.R. Bossi G. Chen H. De Camilli P. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 27Shih S.C. Katzmann D.J. Schnell J.D. Sutanto M. Emr S.D. Hicke L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The EGFR is ubiquitylated upon stimulation, and the Eps15 and Eps15R proteins are also phosphorylated and monoubiquitylated (26Polo S. Sigismund S. Faretta M. Guidi M. Capua M.R. Bossi G. Chen H. De Camilli P. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 33Wiley H.S. Burke P.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14013-14016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Strikingly, Polo et al. found that mutating either of the two UIMs found in Eps15 prevented Eps15 monoubiquitylation (26Polo S. Sigismund S. Faretta M. Guidi M. Capua M.R. Bossi G. Chen H. De Camilli P. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that UIMs can both bind ubiquitin and also direct protein ubiquitylation, although the relationship between these two activities is not yet fully understood. Upon internalization, ubiquitylated receptors can be sorted through the endosomal system to the lysosome via the vacuolar protein sorting pathway (reviewed in Ref. 35Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). UIM-containing proteins required for vacuolar protein sorting include Hrs (yeast Vps27p), Stam1 (yeast Hse1), and Stam2 (4Hofmann K.F.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 347-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). There appear to be strong parallels between the requirements for endocytosis and vacuolar protein sorting because the protein substrates of both pathways are ubiquitylated, the UIM domains of proteins in the pathway are required for proper sorting of substrates, and because Hrs, like Eps15, also becomes ubiquitylated in a process that again depends upon the integrity of its own UIM (26Polo S. Sigismund S. Faretta M. Guidi M. Capua M.R. Bossi G. Chen H. De Camilli P. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 27Shih S.C. Katzmann D.J. Schnell J.D.

Interestingly, vesicle formation during cellular vacuolar protein sorting also appears to be intimately related to another ubiquitin-dependent process; the budding of many enveloped viruses (reviewed in Ref. 37Pornillos O. Garrus J.E. Sundquist W.I. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 569-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). For example, we have recently shown that Hrs protein fragments, when fused to the C-terminal end of the structural HIV-1 Gag protein, can rescue the budding of virus-like particles that lack their cis-acting signals normally required for efficient virus budding. 2Pornillos, O., Higginson, D. S., Stray, K. M., Fisher, R. D., Garrus, J. E., Payne, M., He, O.-P., Wang, H. E., Morham, S. G., and Sundquist, W. I. (2003) J. Cell Biol., in press. The prevalence of the UIM and its important role in the monoubiquitin-dependent processes of endocytosis and vacuolar protein sorting has led us, and others (19Walters K.J. Kleijnen M.F. Goh A.M. Wagner G. Howley P.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1767-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 39Shekhtman A. Cowburn D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 1222-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), to study the detailed biochemical and structural basis for ubiquitin-UIM interactions. Toward this end, we have characterized the ubiquitin binding properties of UIM peptides from Eps15, Vps27p, Hrs, Stam-1, and Stam-2, and determined the high resolution crystal structure of the second UIM from Vps27p. To create GST-UIM fusion proteins for biosensor binding experiments, complementary synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (5′-phosphorylated) encoding UIM peptides were heat-annealed and cloned into the complementary NdeI and BamH1 sites of vector WISP94–18 (40Yoo S. Myszka D. Yeh C.-Y. McMurray M. Hill C.P. Sundquist W.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 780-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab GST-UIM fusion peptides were expressed in DH5α Escherichia coli cells. Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (OD600 = 0.4), and after 4 h at 23 °C the cells were harvested by centrifugation (4 °C), resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, supplemented with Complete Protease Inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science)), lysed with lysozyme (20 μg/ml) and sonication, and the supernatants were clarified by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting soluble extracts were held on ice and used immediately to minimize protein degradation. UIM peptides used in NMR chemical shift perturbation and crystallization experiments were made by FMOC (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid-phase synthesis, purified using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, and confirmed by MALDI mass spectrometry. Ubiquitin was expressed and purified as described (41Beal R. Deveraux Q. Xia G. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biosensor binding experiments were performed at 10 and 18 °C on a BIACORE 3000 using a CM5 research-grade sensor chip derivatized with anti-GST antibodies (40Yoo S. Myszka D. Yeh C.-Y. McMurray M.

GST-UIM fusion peptides or GST alone (negative control) were captured from soluble E. coli lysates at final densities of 1.1–2.3 kRU. Ubiquitin in running buffers (see figure legends) was flowed over the GST-UIM and GST surfaces at concentrations of 0, 4.1, 12.3, 37.0, 111, 333, and 1000 μm. Binding responses were recorded and globally fit to simple 1:1 binding models using the CLAMP software (43Myszka D.G. Morton T.A. Trends Biochem.

Chemical shift perturbation experiments were performed at 18 °Con a Varian Inova 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance 1H/13C/15N probe and z-axis pulsed field gradient capability. Both peptide and ubiquitin samples were dissolved in NMR buffer (90% 1H2O/10% 2H2O containing 20 mm sodium phosphate pH 6.0, 10 mm NaCl), and the unlabeled UIM peptides (∼10 mm) were titrated into 0.8 mm15N-labeled ubiquitin at final molar ratios of 0:1, 0.25:1, 0.5:1, and 1:1 (UIM:Ubiquitin). 1H/15N HSQC spectra (44Mori S.

Kneller, University of California, San Francisco). Normalized chemical shift changes (δ) were calculated using the equation: δ = 25[(δHN)2 + (δN/5)2]0.5 (45Cheever M.L. Sato T.K. de Beer T.

Amide chemical shift assignments for human ubiquitin were obtained from the VLI Research, Inc. (website: www.vli-research.com/ubshifts.htm). Vps27p-2 UIM (Table II) was crystallized under two slightly different conditions using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 23 °C. Crystal form I was grown by mixing 3 μl of protein solution containing 1.6 mm Vps27p-2 and 0.8 mm selenomethionine-substituted ubiquitin (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) with 2 μl of reservoir solution (0.1 m imidazole, pH 7.6, 0.2 m zinc acetate, and 26% 1,4-butanediol). Crystal form II grew from the same protein solution as form I when 3 μl of protein were mixed with 2 μl of a reservoir solution comprised of 0.08 m sodium cacodylate pH 6.5, 0.16 m zinc acetate, 10.4% polyethylene glycol-8000, and 20% glycerol. Both forms crystallized in space group P6222 with essentially identical unit cell dimensions a = b = 34.9 Å, c = 64.2 Å, indicating that the two crystal forms are isomorphous. Although the initial goal was to crystallize a complex of UIM peptide with ubiquitin, both crystal forms were found to contain only the Vps27p-2 peptide. Subsequently, we confirmed that crystals with the same morphology could be grown in the absence of ubiquitin under the same buffer conditions that grew crystals in the presence of ubiquitin, and that these crystals diffract equally well and index according to the same space group and cell dimensions. Data used in the analyses described here were from a form I crystal grown in the presence of ubiquitin and a form II crystal grown in the absence of ubiquitin. Crystallographic Data Collection and Processing—Data were collected from single crystals of each crystal form. Crystals were suspended in a nylon loop, rapidly cooled by plunging into liquid nitrogen, and maintained at 100 K for data collection. Prior to cooling, the form I crystal was soaked in reservoir solution made up with 15% glycerol. Form I crystal data were collected at beamline x12c at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Lab at a wavelength of 0.979 Å whereas form II crystal data were collected using a rotating anode x-ray source (λ = 1.5418 Å). All data were integrated and scaled in the HKL package (47Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter C.W.J. Sweet R.M. Methods Enzymol.Vol. 276. Academic Press, NY1997: 307-326Google Scholar).

Several identified FXR target genes serve critical roles in the synthesis and transport of bile acids as well as in lipid metabolism. Here we used Affymetrix micro-array and Northern analysis to demonstrate that two enzymes involved in conjugation of bile acids to taurine and glycine, namely bile acid-CoA synthetase (BACS) and bile acid-CoA: amino acid N-acetyltransferase (BAT) are induced by FXR in rat liver. Analysis of the human BACS and BAT genes revealed the presence of functional response elements in the proximal promoter of BACS and in the intronic region between exons 1 and 2 of the BAT gene. The response elements resemble the consensus FXR binding site consisting of two nuclear receptor half-sites organized as an inverted repeat and separated by a single nucleotide (IR-1). These response elements directly bind FXR/retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimers and confer the activity of FXR ligands in transient transfection experiments. Further mutational analysis confirms that the IR-1 sequence of the BACS and BAT genes mediate transactivation by FXR/RXR heterodimers. Finally, Fisher rats treated with the synthetic FXR ligand GW4064 clearly show increased transcript levels of both the BACS and BAT mRNA.

For example, bile acid-activated FXR exerts inhibitory effects on the gene encoding cholesterol-7α hydroxylase (CYP7A1), the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid synthesis, indirectly by inducing the gene encoding the short heterodimer partner (SHP). SHP then inactivates CYP7A1 by binding to liver receptor homolog 1, a competence factor for CYP7A1 expression (5Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R. Watson M.A. McKee D.D. Moore L.B. Galardi C.

A similar mechanism has also been shown for bile acid feedback repression of the sodium/taurocholate cotransporter peptide (NTCP), the major bile acid uptake protein in the liver (7Denson L.A. Sturm E. Echevarria W. Zimmerman T.L. Makishima M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Karpen S.J. Gastroenterology. 2001; 121: 140-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In contrast, bile acid-activated FXR directly induces the transcription of the gene for the bile salt export pump (BSEP), the principal bile salt efflux pump in the liver (8Ananthanarayanan M.

Thus, regulation of hepatic gene expression by FXR promotes a net efflux of bile acids from the liver. FXR induces transcription of SHP and BSEP by binding DNA sequences composed of two inverted repeats separated by one nucleotide (IR-1) as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) (5Goodwin B.

FXR also activates transcription of the ileal bile acid-binding protein (IBABP) and phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) genes via IR-1 elements in the promoters of these genes (9Grober J. Zaghini I.

In contrast to this IR-1 arrangement, FXR has also been shown to bind and activate an inverted repeat without a spacing nucleotide (IR-0). This IR-0 arrangement was found to be the cognate FXR element in the dehydroepiandrosterone sulfotransferase gene, which encodes an enzyme with bile acid sulfo-conjugating activity (11Song C.S.

Bile acids are synthesized in the liver from cholesterol and conjugated to glycine or taurine before they are secreted into bile canaliculi (12Bahar R.J. Stolz A. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 28: 27-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Vlahcevic Z.R. Pandak W.M. Stravitz R.T. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 28: 1-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In humans conjugated bile acids are the major solutes in bile, whereas unconjugated bile acids are almost nondetectable. Importantly, conjugated bile acids are less toxic and are more efficient promoters of intestinal absorption of dietary lipid than unconjugated bile acids (14Vessey D.A. Crissey M.H. Zakim D. Biochem. J. 1977; 163: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The primary bile acids in humans, cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, are synthesized via the concerted action of enzymes located in the endoplasmic reticulum, cytosol, mitochondria, and peroxisomes (13Vlahcevic Z.R. Pandak W.M. Stravitz R.T. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 28: 1-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The immediate precursors of the C24 bile acids cholate and chenodeoxycholate are the C27 compounds 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-5-β-cholestanoic acid (THCA) and 3α, 7α,12α-dihydroxy-5-β-cholestanoic acid (DHCA), respectively. Before chain shortening of THCA and DHCA via peroxisomal β-oxidation can take place, the C27 compounds have to be activated to their CoA thioesters. Current knowledge of the synthesis of bile acid-amino acid conjugates in human liver involves two independent enzyme reactions (15Solaas K. Ulvestad A. Soreide O. Kase B.F. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1154-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An ATP-dependent microsomal enzyme, bile acid-CoA synthetase (BACS), catalyzes the formation of the thioester intermediate and is considered the rate-limiting step in bile acid amidation (16Schersten T. Bjorntorp P. Ekdahl P.H. Bjorkerud S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 141: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was recently demonstrated that human very long chain acyl CoA synthetase homolog 2 (VLCS-H2) is a bile acid-CoA synthetase (17Steinberg S.J. Mihalik S.J. Kim D.G. Cuebas D.A. Watkins P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15605-15608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). VLCS-H2 belongs to a family that includes very long chain synthetase (VLCS) and fatty acid transport proteins. In the second reaction, the thioester bond is cleaved and an amide bond is formed between the bile acid and the amino acids glycine or taurine. The bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acetyltransferase (BAT) catalyzes this reaction (18Czuba B. Vessey D.A. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Here we show that FXR regulates the expression of genes required for bile acid conjugation to amino acids. We have used Northern analysis and micro-array technology to identify BACS and BAT as FXR target genes. Induction of BACS and BAT gene expression occurs through the direct interaction of FXR/RXR heterodimers with conserved IR-1 elements in the promoter of BACS and in the first intron of the human BAT gene. Finally we show that these genes are up-regulated in rats treated with a synthetic FXR ligand. These findings provide further evidence for the critical role of FXR in regulating bile acid homeostasis. Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis—Oligonucleotide microarray experiments were performed on 10 μg of total RNA and analyzed according to protocols developed by Affymetrix (Santa Clarita, CA). Briefly, after quality determination on test arrays, samples were hybridized for 16 h at 45 °C to Affymetrix Rat Genome arrays (U34A). Arrays were washed and then stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (genome arrays were amplified with an anti-streptavidin Ab). Stained arrays were scanned with the GeneArray scanner (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Raw data were collected and analyzed by using Affymetrix Microarray Suite and Data Mining Tools software. Experiments were done in two replicates from two rat primary hepatocyte pools. Each of the two compound-treated samples was compared with vehicle-treated samples resulting in four pairwise comparisons for each treatment. Genes with concordance exceeding 75% were considered statistically significant (p < 0.05). RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from rat primary hepatocytes and rat liver RNA using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and further purified by using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from rat liver total RNA using Oligotex (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five micrograms of poly(A)+ RNA was resolved on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel, transferred to nylon membrane, and cross-linked to the membrane with UV light. cDNA probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Rediprime II labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were hybridized using the Rapid hybridization buffer (Amersham Biosciences), washed according to the manufacturer's instructions, and quantified using a Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). Taqman Primers and Probes—Oligonucleotide primers and probes for rat SHP and BSEP were designed using the Primer Express program and were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. The sequences (5′→3′) were as follows: Rat SHP, forward primer (ttggatttcctcggtttgc), probe (6FAM-cagtgtttgactaadtgtccagcaggcc-TAMRA), and reverse primer (acccaggtaagggaaggcata); rat BSEP, forward primer (tgcatgtcaggagacggc), probe (6FAM-tcacattgtggaactcaatttcacccttg-TAMRA), and reverse primer (tcacgtccggtctagaagga). Primary Hepatocyte Cultures and Cell Lines—Primary rat hepatocytes were obtained from In Vitro Technologies plated on collagen-coated plates. Upon arrival (2 days after collagenase isolation), shipping media was replaced by fresh hepatocyte growth media (In Vitro Technologies). After a 2-h recovery period the cells were treated with vehicle (Me2SO) or the following FXR ligands: 100 μm 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholanic acid (CDCA), 1 μm 3-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-4-(3′-carboxy-2-chlorostilben-4-yl)oxymethyl-5-isopropylisoxazole (GW4064) (19Maloney P.R. Parks D.J. Haffner C.D. Fivush A.M. Chandra G. Plunket K.D. Creech K.L. Moore L.B. Wilson J.G. Lewis M.C. Jones S.A. Willson T.M. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 2971-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). After 48 h, total RNA was isolated from the cells. CV-1 cells were obtained from and maintained according to ATCC depository. cDNA Probes and Reporter Genes—Human cDNAs for BAT and BACS were PCR-amplified from reverse-transcribed HepG2 mRNA using primers 5′-atgatccagttgacagctacccctgtg-3′ and 5′-tcaagcatgttcctgtgcagctgcgtg-3′ for BAT, and 5′-gtaccatgggtgtcaggcaacag-3′ and 5′-cagagctcagcacagagtgcgc-3′ for BACS. The PCR amplicons, 1230 and 667 bp for BAT and BACS, respectively, were radiolabeled and used as probes for Northern analysis. Human BAT and BACS gene sequences were obtained from GenBank™. A fragment spanning ∼1.5 kb of 5′-flanking sequence of the BACS (VLCS-H2) gene was PCR-amplified from human genomic DNA using primers 5′-gctgtgagcacctggatcagtgc-3′ and 5′-gtgacgactgtcaccgaccaggag-3′ and cloned into XhoI-HindIII sites of pGL3-basic vector (Promega). A fragment spanning nucleotide –383 to + 2751 of the BAT gene was PCR-amplified from human genomic DNA using primers 5′-ccctggtctcctgcggtaccctcaggc-3′ and 5′-gcacaagcagggcacgcatgtggg-3′ and cloned into SacI-XhoI sites of pGL3-basic vector (Promega). The three-copy BACS IR-1 construct was generated by annealing the oligonucleotides 5′-agcttcccaaggggcagagacctgcggggcagagacctgcggggcagagacctgggag-3′ and 5′-gatcctcccaggtctctgccccgcaggtctctgccccgcaggtctctgccccttggga-3′ before ligation into HindIII/BamHI-digested TK-Luc. The three-copy BAT IR-1 was done using the oligonucleotides 5′-agcttcttggaggtcaagtgcctcgaggtcaagtgcctcgaggtcaagtgcctcgttg-3′ and 5′-gatccaacgaggcacttgacctcgaggcacttgacctcgaggcacttgacctccaaga-3′. Point mutations of FXRE (IR-1) sequences were done using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. For mutation of the BACS IR-1, an antisense primer (5′-gtggtgcccaaggaagcagagatttgggaacccaga-3′) and a sense primer (5′-tctgggttcccaaatctctgcttccttgggcaccac-3′) (mutated bases indicated in boldface type) were used in a PCR according to the manufacturer's directions. For mutation of the IR-1 in the BAT gene, the antisense primer (5′-aggcatcttggaaatcaagtgtttcgttcatccttg-3′) and the sense primer (5′-caaggatgaacgaaacacttgatt- tccaagatgcct-3′) were used. All oligonucleotides primers were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. The sequences of all constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing. Transient Transfections and Reporter Gene Assays—CV-1 cells were transfected using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, 30 ng of reporter plasmid, 10 ng of pCMX-hFXR, 10 ng of pCMX-hRXRα, and 10 ng of pCMV-β-galactosidase and 0.28 μl of FuGENE 6 were used in a final volume of 10 μl. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, the mixture was added to cells in 96-well plates and incubated for5hat37 °C. The cells were then treated with medium containing 10% charcoal/dextran-stripped fetal bovine serum and vehicle (Me2SO) or one of the following ligands: 100 μm CDCA, 1 μm GW4064, or 0.1 μm LG1305. After 24 h, cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. The normalized luciferase units (RLUs) were determined by dividing the luciferase activity by the β-galactosidase activity. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Core sequences of the BAT, BACS, and IBABP IR-1s are shown below in Fig. 2A. Annealed double-stranded oligonucleotides were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase II. hFXR and hRXRα were synthesized from pCMX-FXR and pCMX-RXRα expression vectors using the TnT T7 Coupled Reticulocyte System (Promega, Madison, WI). Binding reactions contained 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 75 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 15% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC), 3 μl each of synthesized receptor proteins, and 0.05 pmol of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide. Competitor oligonucleotides were added at 50- and 150-fold molar excesses. The oligonucleotides used for BAT and BACS IR-1s were 5′-agcttcttggaggtcaagtgcctcgttg-3′ and 5′-agcttcccaaggggcagagacctgggag-3′, respectively (only one strand is shown, and the IR-1 is indicated in boldface). IBABP IR-1 was 5′-agcttttccttaaggtgaataaccttggggct-3′. Animal Studies—Male F344/NHsd rats were fed ad libitum and were kept under standard light/dark cycle. The GW4064 compound was suspended in 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose vehicle for a dosing volume of 1 ml. Animals were dosed bis in die for 7 days with a 16-gauge 5.08-cm feeding needle to give a final concentration of 100 mg/kg. Identification of BAT as a FXR Target Gene—To identify FXR target genes expressed in the liver, primary rat hepatocytes were used for gene expression profiling experiments. Cells were treated for 48 h with CDCA (100 μm) or the synthetic FXR ligand GW4064 (1 μm), whereas control cells were treated with Me2SO (vehicle) before isolation of total RNA. To confirm that FXR target genes were regulated in this experiment, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis of total RNA was performed using specific primers for BSEP and SHP. SHP mRNA levels were significantly increased with the synthetic FXR agonist GW4064, whereas an increase of ∼2-fold was seen with CDCA compared with vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 1A) consistent with studies indicating that CDCA is a weak activator of SHP in vivo (20Li-Hawkins J. Gafvels M. Olin M. Lund E.G. Andersson U. Schuster G. Bjorkhem I. Russell D.W. Eggertsen G. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1191-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). BSEP mRNA levels were also induced by GW4064, and a 2-fold induction was seen with CDCA (Fig. 1B). Having verified regulation of FXR target genes in this experiment, total RNA from each sample was processed and hybridized to Affymetrix rat genomic U34A GeneChips according to Affymetrix protocols. Differentially expressed genes were identified by comparing hybridization signals for FXR ligand treated samples to signals for vehicle treated samples using the Affymetrix Microarray Suite and Data Mining Tools software. Expression profiling by a natural versus a synthetic FXR agonist of primary hepatocytes indicated some degree of overlap but also separation of activities by these ligands (Tables I, II, III). Two known FXR target genes, BSEP and SHP, and one novel target gene, namely bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acetyltransferase (BAT), were clearly differentially expressed in this experiment (Tables I and II). We decided to focus on the BAT gene for further characterization, because FXR has previously been shown to play a critical role in bile acid homeostasis. The BAT transcript was induced ∼2-fold by GW4064 as well as with CDCA in the micro-array experiment.Table IGenes regulated by GW4064 and CDCA in rat primary

tyrosine phosphatase (rVH6)-2.1AF022952Vascular endothelial growth factor B Open table in a new tab The Human BACS and BAT Genes Contain Potential FXREs—The finding that BAT is transcriptionally activated by FXR ligands suggested that the rate-limiting enzyme in bile acid-amino acid conjugation, bile acid-CoA synthetase (BACS) may also be an FXR target gene. To date, most functional binding sites (FXRE) identified in FXR target genes correspond to two inverted repeats spaced by one nucleotide as exemplified by the IR-1 from the mouse IBABP promoter (Fig. 2A). Analysis of the proximal promoter of the human BACS gene identified a potential IR-1 (5′-GGGGCAaAGACCT-3′) in the flanking region located ∼230 bp upstream of the transcription start site. Similar analysis of the proximal promoter and intron 1 of the human BAT gene identified an IR-1 (5′-AGGTCAaGTGCCT-3′) located in intron 1 at +2615 to +2628 relative to the transcription start site (Fig. 2B). Electrophoresis mobility gel shift assays (EMSA) and transient transfection experiments were next performed to investigate direct binding and functionality of the FXR/RXR binding to these sequences. FXR/RXR Heterodimers Bind to FXREs in the BACS and BAT Genes—EMSA experiments with a radiolabeled oligonucleotide spanning the BACS IR-1 showed that when incubated with in vitro translated FXR and RXR protein this element produced a significant band shift that was competed with 150-fold molar excess of unlabeled BACS or IBABP IR-1. No shifted DNA-protein complex was observed when either FXR or RXR was omitted from the EMSAs (Fig. 3A). An oligonucleotide containing the BAT IR-1 sequence was next radiolabeled and used in a gel-shift experiment (Fig. 3B). The BAT IR-1 produced a significant band shift when incubated with FXR and RXR proteins but not when incubated by RXR alone. Interestingly, a weak band shift was detected when the BAT IR-1 was incubated with FXR alone, indicating that FXR may bind as a monomer or homodimer to this DN"
https://openalex.org/W2028195118,"A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease is the deposition of plaques of amyloid β peptide (Aβ) in the brain. Aβ is thought to be formed from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in cholesterol-enriched membrane rafts, and cellular cholesterol depletion decreases Aβ formation. The liver X receptors (LXR) play a key role in regulating genes that control cellular cholesterol efflux and membrane composition and are widely expressed in cells of the central nervous system. We show that treatment of APP-expressing cells with LXR activators reduces the formation of Aβ. LXR activation resulted in increased levels of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and stearoyl CoA desaturase, and expression of these genes individually decreased formation of Aβ. Expression of ABCA1 led to both decreased β-cleavage product of APPSw (i.e. C99 peptide) and reduced γ-secretase-cleavage of C99 peptide. Remarkably, these effects of ABCA1 on APP processing were independent of cellular lipid efflux. LXR and ABCA1-induced changes in membrane lipid organization had favorable effects on processing of APP, suggesting a new approach to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

The generation of Aβ requires sequential cleavage of the type I integral membrane amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- then γ-secretase. β-Secretase cleaves APP extracellularly, leaving a 99-residue C-terminal fragment (C99) that remains membrane-bound. γ-Secretase then mediates an intramembranous cleavage, yielding the Aβ peptide (for review see Refs. 1Esler W.P.

Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13878-13883Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Recent studies show an essential role for LXRs in brain structure and function as aging LXRα/β knockout mice develop cellular lipid inclusions, abnormalities of the choroid plexus, and closure of the lateral ventricles (8Wang L. Schuster G.U. Hultenby K. Zhang Q. Andersson S. Gustafsson J.-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13878-13883Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Although this pathology is different from that of AD, LXRs could potentially have a role in modulating the course of chronic neurodegenerative diseases. An important target of LXRs is the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) (9Costet P. Luo Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28240-28245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). ABCA1, the defective molecule in Tangier disease, mediates efflux of cellular phospholipids and cholesterol to lipid-poor apolipoprotein, including apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and apoE, which are present in the cerebrospinal fluid (10Remaley A.T. Stonik J.A. Demosky S.J. Neufeld E.B. Bocharov A.V. Vishnyakova T.G. Eggerman T.L. Patterson A.P. Duverger N.J. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brewer Jr., H.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 818-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Treatment of mice with LXR agonists resulted in increased expression of LXR target genes in the brain, especially ABCA1 (8Wang L. Schuster G.U. Hultenby K. Zhang Q. Andersson S. Gustafsson J.-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13878-13883Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and LXR activation induces lipid efflux from glial cells (11Whitney K.D. Watson M.A. Collins J.L. Benson W.G. Stone T.M. Numerick M.J. Tippin T.K. Wilson J.G. Winegar D.A. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1378-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). These observations led us to hypothesize that activation of LXRs in neurons might induce ABCA1, resulting in cholesterol efflux and reduced secretion of Aβ. Cell Culture—Mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a cells stably expressing Swedish APP695 were previously described (12Thinakaran G. Teplow D.B. Siman R. Greenberg B. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9390-9397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Neuro2a-APPSw cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/OptiMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Tissue culture reagents were from Invitrogen. Transient and stable transfections were performed with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). 22(R)-Hydroxycholesterol and the synthetic LXR activator TO901317 were purchased from Sigma. 9-cis-Retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) was from Biomol, apoA-I was from Biodesign, and the apoE isoforms were from Calbiochem. Immunoblots—The cells were lysed in buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, and 2 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Postnuclear lysates were collected by spinning the lysed cells at 8000 × g for 5 min. Postnuclear lysates were fractionated in 4–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Polyclonal anti-ABCA1 antibody was purchased from Novus (Littleton, CO). Monoclonal anti-actin antibody was purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal anti-SCD antibodies were raised in rabbits (13Sun Y. Hao M. Luo Y. Liang C.P. Silver D.L. Cheng C. Maxfield F.R. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5813-5820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Cellular APP was detected by monoclonal antibody 22C11 (Chemicon). Detection of Secreted Aβ—In experiments with LXR activation, the cells were first induced with activators for 24 h in DMEM, 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum. The cells were then incubated in fresh medium for 4 h for Aβ measurements. In experiments with ABCA1 transient transfections, 24 h after transfection, the cells were incubated with DMEM, 1% lipoprotein-deficient serum with or without apolipoproteins for 6 h for Aβ measurements. After the indicated treatments, conditioned medium was collected on ice and centrifuged at 6000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris. Immunoprecipitation of Aβ or C99 was performed with monoclonal antibody 4G8 (Signet) and protein A/G-conjugated agarose (Santa Cruz). Aβ and C99 were then extracted in NuPAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen) and fractionated in 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris Gel (Invitrogen). Fractionated proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and blotted with monoclonal antibody 6E10 (Signet) after boiling. The immunoblots were developed using the ECL system (Pierce) scanned and quantified by ImageQuant (Molecular dynamics). Quantitation of Aβ40 and Aβ42 was performed using a commercial Aβ enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (BIOSOURCE). Cellular Cholesterol Efflux—The efflux experiments were performed as described (13Sun Y. Hao M. Luo Y. Liang C.P. Silver D.L. Cheng C. Maxfield F.R. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5813-5820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, Neuro2a cells were labeled with 1 μCi/ml [1,2-3H(N)]-cholesterol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in DMEM containing 5 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin:cholesterol at a molar ratio of 8:1 for 15 min at 37 °C. After washing, the cells were equilibrated in DMEM, 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 30 min and then used for efflux experiments. The cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml purified human apoA-I or apoEs in DMEM, 1% lipoprotein-deficient serum for 6 h, and the medium was collected and centrifuged at 6000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris and cholesterol crystals. The cells were lysed in 0.1 m sodium hydroxide, 0.1% SDS, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Efflux was expressed as the percentage of radioactivity in the medium relative to the total radioactivity in cells and medium. Statistical Analysis—The significance of differences between groups was assessed by Student's t test To evaluate the effects of LXR activators on APP processing, we employed neuron-derived Neuro2a cells, stably transfected with human APPSw containing a mutation that increases the formation of total Aβ (the Swedish mutation) (14Haass C. Lemere C.A. Capell A. Citron M. Seubert P. Schenk D. Lannfelt L. Selkoe D.J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The cells were treated with increasing doses of the synthetic LXRα/β activator TO901317 (TO), and Aβ secretion into medium was measured by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting (Fig. 1A). This revealed a decrease in the secretion of Aβ, with an approximate 50% reduction at 1 μm TO. The amount of the soluble form of APP (APPsα) in medium was not significantly changed by administration of the LXR activator (not shown). LXR acts in a heterodimeric complex with retinoid X receptor (RXR), and the response of genes to LXR activators is increased in the presence of RXR activators, such as 9-cis-retinoic acid (15Peet D.J. Janowski B.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). When cells were treated with 1 μm TO901317 plus 1 μm 9-cis-retinoic acid, there was a further reduction in Aβ secretion to 20% of control (Fig. 1B). Aβ formation was reduced when the cells were treated with the natural LXR activator, 22(R)-OH cholesterol, together with 9-cis-retinoic acid (Fig. 1C). LXR/RXR activation also decreased the secretion of Aβ formed from endogenous APP in 293 cells (data not shown), indicating that these effects were not dependent on overexpression of mutant APP. Aβ is secreted in several different forms. Although Aβ40 (40 amino acids) is the predominant species, Aβ42 (42 amino acids) is a minor but more amyloidogenic form. Whereas Aβ42 is formed predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum and trans-Golgi, Aβ40 is made in plasma membrane, endocytic compartments, and trans-Golgi (16Hartmann T. Bieger S.C. Bruhl B. Tienari P.J. Ida N. Allsop D. Roberts G.W. Masters C.L. Dotti C.G. Unsicker K. Beyreuther K. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1016-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 17Greenfield J.P. Tsai J. Gouras G.K. Hai B. Thinakaran G. Checler F. Sisodia S.S. Greengard P. Xu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 742-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Measurement of both forms of Aβ in medium of Neuro2a cells by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that LXR/RXR activation (1 μm TO, 1 μm 9-cis-RA) decreased the secretion of Aβ40 by about 70%, whereas Aβ42 was more moderately reduced (Fig. 2). Because the concentration of Aβ40 in medium was ∼8-fold more than that of Aβ42, the marked decrease in Aβ signal in Fig. 1 primarily reflects a reduction in Aβ40. Neuro2a cells treated with LXR/RXR activators (1 μm TO and 1 μm 9-cis-RA) showed a marked induction of ABCA1 protein (Fig. 3A). To determine whether induction of ABCA1 might be responsible for decreased secretion of Aβ, Neuro2a cells were transfected with ABCA1 and incubated with or without apoA-I. Transfection of ABCA1 resulted in levels of ABCA1 protein comparable with that induced by LXR/RXR activators (Fig. 3A). Expression of ABCA1 decreased the formation of Aβ without affecting cellular APP levels (Fig. 3B). Surprisingly, the major effect of ABCA1 expression was observed without the addition of the extracellular acceptor apoA-I, and there was only a slight further decrease in Aβ when apoA-I was added to medium (Fig. 3B). Measurement of cellular cholesterol efflux showed a small but significant increase in efflux (1.0 ± 0.1% of total cellular cholesterol) with expression of ABCA1 and the addition of apoA-I. Similarly, there was an increase in efflux of cellular phospholipids (1.9% of total cellular choline-labeled lipids). However, expression of ABCA1 alone did not increase cholesterol or phospholipid efflux compared with nontransfected controls. We also measured cellular cholesterol mass. Under our experimental conditions, there was no detectable cholesteryl ester in cells, either with or without expression of ABCA1. As a control for possible nonspecific effects of ABCA1 expression unrelated to functional activity, we transfected Neuro2a cells with a mutant form of ABCA1 (Walker motif mutant); this mutant is well expressed on the cell surface but inactive both in lipid efflux and binding of apoA-I (18Wang N. Silver D.L. Thiele C. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23742-23747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). When expressed at levels similar to those of wild type ABCA1, the mutant failed to alter Aβ secretion by Neuro2a cells (Fig. 3C), indicating that the effects of ABCA1 expression are related to the activity of the transporter, even though they do not require lipid efflux. Because apoE is a major apolipoprotein in the central nervous system and the apoE4 isoform is associated with increased risk of AD (19Corder E.H. Saunders A.M. Strittmatter W.J. Schmechel D.E. Gaskell P.C. Small G.W. Roses A.D. Haines J.L. Pericak-Vance M.A. Science. 1993; 261: 921-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (7082) Google Scholar, 20Schmechel D.E. Saunders A.M. Strittmatter W.J. Crain B.J. Hulette C.M. Joo S.H. Pericak-Vance M.A. Goldgaber D. Roses A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9649-9653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar), we also examined the effects of apoE on Aβ formation. Expression of ABCA1 with the addition of apoE also resulted in a profound decrease in Aβ formation (Fig. 4). Again, the major effect was attributable to ABCA1 expression alone. The addition of apoE2 resulted in a small but significant further decrease in Aβ formation, whereas apoE3 and apoE4 did not produce significant further reductions in Aβ secretion. The addition of apoE isoforms without ABCA1 expression did not affect Aβ secretion (not shown). Both β- and γ-cleavage of APP are required for the generation of Aβ. We next carried out a series of experiments to determine which step is affected by ABCA1 overexpression. To measure β-cleavage, we immunoprecipitated the β-secretase cleavage product (C99) from cell lysates. There was an 85% decrease of cellular C99 in Neuro2a-APPSw cells transiently transfected with ABCA1 compared with mock transfected control (Fig. 5A). γ-Secretase mediates the final step in Aβ generation (1Esler W.P. Wolfe M.S. Science. 2001; 293: 1449-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). To assess the direct effects of ABCA1 expression on γ-secretase cleavage of APP, Neuro2a cells were transfected with constructs encoding C-terminal APP fragments (C99) containing a Myc epitope tag. ABCA1 expression was found to decrease the cleavage of C99 peptide, indicating a decrease in γ-secretase processing (Fig. 5B). The addition of apoA-I did not provide a further significant decrease in Aβ generation (not shown). In addition to targeting genes involved in cellular cholesterol efflux and transport, LXRs also activate synthesis of mono-unsaturated fatty acids (21Repa J.J. Liang G. Ou J. Bashmakov Y. Lobaccaro J.M. Shimomura I. Shan B. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). SCD is a key LXR target gene that catalyzes the conversion of stearoylCoA to oleoylCoA and increases the content of mono-unsaturated fatty acids in cell membrane phospholipids (22Ntambi J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1549-1558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently shown that SCD activity decreases the amount of liquid ordered domains in the plasma membrane (13Sun Y. Hao M. Luo Y. Liang C.P. Silver D.L. Cheng C. Maxfield F.R. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5813-5820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). There are two forms of SCD, both LXR targets, with similar catalytic activity and cellular effects (22Ntambi J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1549-1558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using an antibody that recognizes both forms of SCD, we showed that treatment of Neuro2a cells with LXR activators resulted in a modest 1.6-fold increase in SCD protein (Fig. 6A). Transient transfection of SCD in Neuro2a cells resulted in a decrease in Aβ secretion into medium (Fig. 6B). Because Neuro2a cells have high basal levels of SCD activity, we also carried out similar experiments in 293 cells that have much lower basal SCD expression (13Sun Y. Hao M. Luo Y. Liang C.P. Silver D.L. Cheng C. Maxfield F.R. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5813-5820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Transient overexpression of SCD resulted in an increase in APPsα formation (not shown) and a profound decrease in Aβ generation (Fig. 7A) that was associated with a marked decrease in γ-secretase cleavage of the C99 peptide (Fig. 7B).Fig. 7SCD overexpression inhibits Aβ secretion from APP and C99 in 293 cells. A, 293 cells were transfected with APP (wild type) or APP with SCD expressing plasmid. B, 293 cells were transfected with C99 or C99 with SCD expressing plasmid. Aβ secretion was measured during 72 h of incubation; *, p < 0.01 compared with C99 transfected alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The idea that changes in cellular lipid metabolism might favorably influence APP processing has attracted considerable attention (23Wolozin B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5371-5373Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Cellular cholesterol depletion, based on treatment with cyclodextrins or statins, reduces membrane rafts, increases α-cleavage of APP, and reduces β-cleavage, leading to less Aβ secretion (24Kojro E. Gimpl G. Lammich S. Marz W. Fahrenholz F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5815-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). One explanation for these observations is decreased partitioning or trafficking of APP into cholesterol-enriched membrane domains where the β-cleavage enzyme resides (23Wolozin B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5371-5373Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 25Ehehalt R. Keller P. Haass C. Thiele C. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). In contrast, in our study LXR activators and ABCA1 expression were observed to decrease Aβ secretion in the absence of cellular lipid efflux, and this was not accompanied by changes in α-cleavage and was mediated in part by a decrease in γ-secretase cleavage of the C-terminal 99 amino acid peptide of APP. Our results suggest that ABCA1-mediated translocation of membrane cholesterol leads to a decrease in γ-secretase cleavage. This suggests either sensitivity of γ-secretase activity to membrane environment or altered trafficking of C99 to the site of γ-cleavage and represents a new mechanism to link alteration in membrane lipid organization and Aβ production. Our studies were undertaken as a test of the hypothesis that LXR activation would increase lipid efflux and thereby decrease Aβ generation. However, LXR activators decreased Aβ formation in the absence of extracellular acceptors (Fig. 1), and the addition of apoA-I or any of the three isoforms of apoE resulted in only minor further changes in Aβ (Figs. 3 and 4). Serving as a control for nonspecific effects related to ABCA1 expression, the Walker motif mutant of ABCA1 failed to decrease Aβ formation (Fig. 3C). These findings indicate that the decrease in Aβ is related to an intrinsic cellular activity of ABCA1. ABCA1 probably acts as a lipid translocase at the plasma membrane (26Hamon Y. Broccardo C. Chambenoit O. Luciani M.F. Toti F. Chaslin S. Freyssinet J.M. Devaux P.F. McNeish J. Marguet D. Chimini G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) and causes changes in plasma membrane morphology (27Wang N. Silver D.L. Costet P. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33053-33058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Recently, Vaughan and Oram (28Vaughan, A. M., and Oram, J. F. (2003) J. Lipid Res., in pressGoogle Scholar) showed that ABCA1 expression increases cell surface cholesterol oxidase-accessible domains, indicating a redistribution of cholesterol toward the outer membrane, independent of extracellular lipid acceptors. Decreased Aβ formation might result from an ABCA1-induced redistribution of membrane cholesterol either at the plasma membrane or in the Golgi or endocytic compartments. Although ABCA1-mediated lipid translocation could affect raft organization, it seems unlikely that an alteration in plasma membrane rafts fully accounts for our findings. ABCA1 appears to be localized in and to induce cholesterol efflux from nonraft membrane regions (29Mendez A.J. Lin G. Wade D.P. Lawn R.M. Oram J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3158-3166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and ABCA1 expression did not alter the distribution or amount of plasma membrane liquid ordered regions in 293 cells. 2Y. Sun, J. Yao, T.-W. Kim, and A. R. Tall, unpublished data. In contrast, SCD activity decreases membrane liquid ordered regions (13Sun Y. Hao M. Luo Y. Liang C.P. Silver D.L. Cheng C. Maxfield F.R. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5813-5820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and was associated with increased α-cleavage of APP, similar to the effects of cholesterol depletion, However, changes in SCD protein levels in Neuro2a cells were modest and unlikely to account for a major part of the effect of LXR activators. Both ABCA1 and SCD expression were associated with a decrease in γ-secretase cleavage of the C-terminal 99 amino acids of APP (Figs. 5B and 7). In the case of APPSw, ABCA1 decreased β-cleavage by 85% (Fig. 5A), but the overall decrease in Aβ secretion was only around 60% (Fig. 3B), which is comparable with the effect of ABCA1 on γ-cleavage (Fig. 5B). This suggests that under these conditions γ-cleavage is the rate-limiting step in Aβ secretion. Our findings suggest that this key enzyme of Aβ formation is highly sensitive to its membrane lipid environment, possibly reflecting the fact that γ-secretase mediates an intramembranous cleavage of APP. Alterations in membrane fluidity caused by lipid translocation or increased content of mono-unsaturated phospholipids could lead to a decrease in γ-secretase activity. Although the cellular compartmentalization of γ-secretase activity is not completely understood (1Esler W.P. Wolfe M.S. Science. 2001; 293: 1449-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), several reports suggest that Aβ formation mainly occurs in the endocytic compartments (30Perez R.G. Soriano S. Hayes J.D. Ostaszewski B. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Chen X. Stokin G.B. Koo E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18851-18856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) where components of γ-secretase, including presenilins, are shown to be present (31Kaether C. Lammich S. Edbauer D. Ertl M. Rietdorf J. Capell A. Steiner H. Haass C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). An alternative interpretation of our results is that induction of ABCA1 activity results in altered cellular trafficking of APP or the C-terminal fragment of APP, providing less substrate for γ-secretase cleavage. The finding that cellular cholesterol depletion leads to less Aβ secretion has fostered the idea that statins could be useful in the treatment of AD. Epidemiological studies have suggested that statin therapy is associated with decreased prevalence of AD (32Wolozin B. Kellman W. Ruosseau P. Celesia G.G. Siegel G. Arch. Neurol. 2000; 57: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar, 33Jick H. Zornberg G.L. Jick S.S. Seshadri S. Drachman D.A. Lancet. 2000; 356: 1627-1631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar). However, brain cholesterol is derived by local synthesis (not from plasma low density lipoprotein), and statins would have to be present in the brain at high levels to alter neuronal lipid metabolism. Although human studies show an association between statin treatment and decreased prevalence of AD, such associations can reflect the influence of confounding factors, as appears to be the case for statins and bone disease (34Coons J.C. Ann. Pharmacother. 2002; 36: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A recent placebo-controlled prospective trial of statin therapy in the elderly failed to show any improvements in cognitive function (35Shepherd J. Blauw G.J. Murphy M.B. Bollen E.L. Buckley B.M. Cobbe S.M. Ford I. Gaw A. Hyland M. Jukema J.W. Kamper A.M. Macfarlane P.W. Meinders A.E. Norrie J. Packard C.J. Perry I.J. Stott D.J. Sweeney B.J. Twomey C. Westendorp R.G. Lancet. 2002; 360: 1623-1630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). Inhibition of cholesterol esterification by acylCoA:cholesterol acyl transferase inhibitors has also been proposed to favorably affect processing of APP (36Puglielli L. Konopka G. Pack-Chung E. Ingano L.A. Berezovska O. Hyman B.T. Chang T.Y. Tanzi R.E. Kovacs D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Because cholesteryl esters have minor solubility in membranes and are thought to be present in cells as inert lipid droplets, it is unlikely that these effects are related to cholesteryl ester accumulation. One possibility suggested by our studies is that acylCoA:cholesterol acyl transferase inhibition leads to accumulation of cellular free sterol and conversion to LXR ligands via endogenous oxysterol synthesizing enzymes such as 24-cholesterol hydroxylase (37Lutjohann D. Breuer O. Ahlborg G. Nennesmo I. Siden A. Diczfalusy U. Bjorkhem I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9799-9804Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Cholesteryl esters were not stored in cells in appreciable amounts under the conditions of our experiments, and changes in cellular acylCoA:cholesterol acyl transferase activity are thus unlikely to account for the findings. Our findings, along with another recent report (38Koldamova R.P. Lefterov I.M. Ikonomovic M.D. Skoko J. Lefterov P.I. Isanski B.A. DeKosky S.T. Lazo J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13244-13256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), suggest that LXR activators currently being developed for the treatment of atherosclerosis might have therapeutic efficacy in Alzheimer's disease. LXR/RXR activation markedly decreased Aβ40 but had less effect on Aβ42 secretion. Although Aβ42 is thought to be more amyloidogenic than Aβ40, much more Aβ40 is secreted by neurons, and both forms are found in amyloid plaques (2Hardy J. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (10646) Google Scholar). Therefore, controlling the predominant Aβ40 secretion could be beneficial. Our results differ from another report where a 65% increase in Aβ42 and no significant change in Aβ40 was found in Neuro2a cells treated with TO and 9-cis-retinoic acid (10 μm) (39Fukumoto H. Deng A. Irizarry M.C. Fitzgerald M.L. Rebeck G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48508-48513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The reasons for this discrepancy are not clear. However, our findings substantially agree with another report (38Koldamova R.P. Lefterov I.M. Ikonomovic M.D. Skoko J. Lefterov P.I. Isanski B.A. DeKosky S.T. Lazo J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13244-13256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), which appeared while our paper was under review. Our results extend these latter studies by the direct demonstration that ABCA1 and SCD expression decreases Aβ formation and that these effects are observed without lipid efflux from cells and involve a decrease in γ-secretase cleavage. In contrast to the more general approach of cholesterol biosynthesis inhibition, LXR activation may directly regulate genes that favorably modulate plasma membrane composition and structure in the brain (8Wang L.

Tangier disease patients have not been reported with premature dementia, suggesting that ABCA1 may not have an essential role in protecting against AD.

The MTOC also localizes in front of the nucleus toward the direction of migration in EC sheets (7Gotlieb A.I. Spector W. Am. J. Pathol. 1981; 103: 271-282PubMed Google Scholar). Reorientation of the MTOC similar to that in endothelial cells (ECs) has been reported in other cell types and is an important determinant of polarized movement (8Malech H.L. Root R.K. Gallin J.I. J.

Cell Culture, Shear Stress, and Transfections—Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen) in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air incubator at 37 °C. BAECs on 38 × 76-mm slides at confluence were subjected to shear stress at 12 dynes/cm2 in a parallel plate flow chamber (14Tzima E. del Pozo M.A. Shattil S.J. Chien S.

For transient transfections, 2.5 μg of GFP-N17Cdc42, GFP-V12Cdc42, GFP-WTCdc42, and GFP-N19Rho or 2.25 μg of WTPKCζ, DNPKCζ, WTPar6, ΔNtPar6, PDZPar6, and Cdc42-binding domain and 0.25 μg of GFP using Effectene according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen) were used. Transfections for FRET assays used 0.5 μg of GFP-WTCdc42. After 10h in growth medium, cells were starved overnight in 0.5% serum prior to stimulation. GTPase Assays—Pull-down assays for activated Cdc42 were carried out as described for Rac (15Tzima E. Del Pozo M.A. Kiosses W.B. Mohamed S.A. Li S. Chien S.

Cdc42 FRET assays were performed as described previously (15Tzima E. Del Pozo M.A. Kiosses W.B. Mohamed S.A. Li S. Chien S. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6791-6800Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). BAECs were microinjected as described previously (17Kiosses W.B. Daniels R.H. Otey C. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 831-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) with GFP-WTCdc42, GFP-V12Cdc42, GFP-WTRac + Zizimin CAAX, and GFP-N17Cdc42 GFP (all at 50 μg/ml with the exception of N17 Cdc42 GFP, which was 200 μg/ml) and were maintained at 37 °C for 2 h. GFP-positive cells received a second microinjection of Alexa-p21-binding domain of PAK1 (PBD) (50 μg/ml) into the cytoplasm. Cells were then fixed in 2% formaldehyde. For shear stress Cdc42 FRET experiments, BAECs transiently transfected with GFP-WTCdc42 were serum-starved overnight in 0.5% serum-containing medium, loaded with Alexa-PBD as described previously (18Clarke M.S. McNeil P.L. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 533-541PubMed Google Scholar), plated on fibronectin (FN)-coated glass slides, and allowed to adhere for 2 h and then were subjected to shear. Images of fixed cells were acquired using a Bio-Rad 1024 confocal microscope. Calculations to account for bleed-through and background were performed as described previously (19Kraynov V.S. Chamberlain C. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Slabaugh S. Hahn K.M. Science. 2000; 290: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The resultant corrected 8-bit FRET images typically had a fluorescence intensity range of 30–110 for shear flow experiments and 30–100 for re-plating on FN experiments and were displayed using pseudocolor where blue was closest to 0 and red was closest to 110/100. Fibronectin was blocked by the addition of Fab fragments of antibody 16G3, which blocks both the αVβ3 and α5β1 binding sites for fibronectin. Alternatively, cultures were treated antibody 11E5, which is non-function blocking (a generous gift from Dr. K. M. Yamada). These cultures were added at 10 μg/ml to well spread cells on FN for 15 min before applying shear as previously described (14Tzima E. del Pozo M.A. Shattil S.J. Chien S. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4639-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 15Tzima E. Del Pozo M.A. Kiosses W.B. Mohamed S.A. Li S. Chien S. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6791-6800Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells were fixed for 10 min in methanol at –20 °C, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS, and blocked with 10% goat serum. Cells were stained with an antibody against γ-tubulin (Sigma) followed by TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma). Nuclei were stained with TOTO-3 (Molecular Probes). Confocal serial sectioned images were acquired using a Bio-Rad 1024 MRC scanning confocal microscope. To investigate the role of Cdc42 in flow-induced MT organization, we first asked whether shear stress could activate Cdc42. Pull-down assays were carried out in which Cdc42 GTP loading was determined by specific binding of the active GTPase to the PBD fused to glutathione S-transferase (20Bagrodia S. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27995-27998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 21Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Serum-starved BAECs subjected to shear stress for the indicated times showed an increase in Cdc42 activity that was detectable at 5 min and maximal at 30 min after shear stress. Activity decreased to basal levels 1–2 h after shear stress (Fig. 1). A previous study (22Li S. Chen B.P. Azuma N. Hu Y.L. Wu S.Z. Sumpio B.E. Shyy J.Y. Chien S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1141-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) showed that shear stress induced translocation of Cdc42 to the membrane fraction on a somewhat faster time scale. Whereas differences in technique cannot be excluded, the finding that membrane translocation can be regulated separately from biochemical activation (16del Pozo M.A. Price L.S. Alderson N.B. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2008-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 23Del Pozo M.A. Kiosses W.B. Alderson N.B. Meller N. Hahn K.M. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) may account for this discrepancy. Shear stress triggers integrin activation followed by new integrin binding to extracellular matrix (ECM) (14Tzima E. del Pozo M.A. Shattil S.J. Chien S. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4639-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 24Jalali S. del Pozo M.M. Chen K.D. Miao H. Li Y.S. Schwartz M.A. Shyy J.Y. Chien S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1042-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Additionally, integrins can activate Cdc42 (11Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Cell. 2001; 106: 489-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 25Price L.S. Leng J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Moreover, the time course of Cdc42 activation (Fig. 1) is consistent with it being downstream of integrin binding to ECM, which is detectable at 2 min and maximal at 30 min (14Tzima E. del Pozo M.A. Shattil S.J. Chien S. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4639-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). To test whether Cdc42 activation requires new integrin binding, ECs fully spread on FN were briefly treated with anti-FN antibodies. This treatment blocks excess unligated FN to prevent formation of new integrin-ligand connections without disrupting existing adhesions (14Tzima E. del Pozo M.A. Shattil S.J. Chien S. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4639-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 15Tzima E. Del Pozo M.A. Kiosses W.B. Mohamed S.A. Li S. Chien S. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6791-6800Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 24Jalali S. del Pozo M.M. Chen K.D. Miao H. Li Y.S. Schwartz M.A. Shyy J.Y. Chien S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1042-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Shear stress was then applied, and Cdc42 activity was assayed. The blocking antibody 16G3 strongly inhibited the shear stress-induced increase in Cdc42 activity, whereas the non-blocking antibody 11E5 had no effect (Fig. 1C). Thus, the activation of Cdc42 is downstream of new integrin binding to ECM in this system. Whether Cdc42 conveys spatial information to the MTOC or is simply required for MTOC movement is presently unclear in any system (10Palazzo A.F. Joseph H.L. Chen Y.J. Dujardin D.L. Alberts A.S. Pfister K.K. Vallee R.B. Gundersen G.G. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1536-1541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 11Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Cell. 2001; 106: 489-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). To address this question, we monitored the subcellular localization of Cdc42 nucleotide state by adapting a recently developed assay for localized Rac activity in which a GFP-tagged GTPase is introduced into cells together with an Alexa546-labeled effector domain from PAK (PBD) (19Kraynov V.S. Chamberlain C. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Slabaugh S. Hahn K.M. Science. 2000; 290: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 27Chamberlain C.E. Kraynov V.S. Hahn K.M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 389-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of the GTPase leads to the binding of the PBD and increased FRET between the two fluorophores. Because PAK binds equally well to Cdc42, we expressed GFP-Cdc42 and introduced Alexa546-PBD into cells by shear loading (18Clarke M.S. McNeil P.L. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 533-541PubMed Google Scholar). Images of GFP, Alexa, and FRET were taken for each cell, and FRET images were corrected for bleed-through as described previously (19Kraynov V.S. Chamberlain C. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Slabaugh S. Hahn K.M. Science. 2000; 290: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Control experiments to validate the assay showed that cells expressing dominant-negative N17Cdc42 that does not bind PBD had only low levels of FRET that we take as the base line (Fig. 2). In unstimulated cells containing WTCdc42, FRET was usually high in regions close to the nucleus and, in some cases, a weak positive FRET signal was present near cell edges. Constitutively active GFP-V12Cdc42 produced much stronger FRET at cell edges, often at the base of small protrusions that may be nascent filopodia, whereas perinuclear FRET was unchanged. To test whether WT protein can be activated, GFP-WTCdc42 was expressed together with the Cdc42 nucleotide exchange factor zizimin1 (28Meller N. Irani-Tehrani M. Kiosses W.B. Del Pozo M.A. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Zizimin1 induced a substantial increase in the Cdc42 FRET near cell edges in the vicinity of small protrusions. We noticed that Cdc42 activation was often lower at the base of large filopodia, suggesting that Cdc42 activity is more important for formation than maintenance of these structures. These results demonstrate the Cdc42 FRET assay shows the correct behavior. To visualize Cdc42 activation in response to shear stress, BAECs containing GFP-WTCdc42 and Alexa-PBD were subjected to fluid flow for various times and then fixed and assessed. We observed a marked increase in FRET near cell edges after 30 min, which returned to base line by 2 h (Fig. 3). FRET results were therefore consistent with the biochemical assay. Importantly, shear stress preferentially induced FRET in the downstream side relative to the direction of flow. To quantify polarity, images were analyzed by dividing cells in half relative to the direction of flow and the upstream or downstream localization of the FRET signal was assessed. When scored by eye, shear stress for 30 min induced a dramatic increase in the fraction of cells in which FRET was predominantly down-stream (Fig. 3). Polarization dissipated at later times of shear stress. Second, to quantify in a completely objective way, the number of pixels and pixel intensity in both halves were quantified. The total signal above the background was calculated for both upstream and downstream areas of cells. The results demonstrated higher Cdc42 activity in the downstream half in cells subjected to shear stress for 30 min. In contrast, Cdc42 activity was randomly distributed in unsheared cells and cells sheared for 2 h. Thus, shear stress activates Cdc42 preferentially downstream of flow. Cdc42 is required for lysophosphatic acid-induced MTOC reorientation (10Palazzo A.F. Joseph H.L. Chen Y.J. Dujardin D.L. Alberts A.S. Pfister K.K. Vallee R.B. Gundersen G.G. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1536-1541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) as well as MTOC reorientation in wounded astrocyte monolayers (11Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Cell. 2001; 106: 489-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether shear stress has an effect on MTOC orientation in confluent monolayers of BAECs subjected to fluid shear stress. MTOC orientation was assessed in fixed preparations stained for γ-tubulin and nuclei. Cells were scored for whether the MTOC position relative to the nucleus was within 120o relative to the direction of flow. 16 h of flow induced MTOC reorientation in the direction of flow in the majority of the cells compared with control cells where MTOC position was random (Fig. 4). To investigate the role of Cdc42 in this process, BAECs were transiently transfected with DNA constructs for wild type, dominant negative (N17Cdc42), or dominant active Cdc42 (V12Cdc42). Polarization of the MTOC was unaffected by WTCdc42 but dramatically inhibited by N17Cdc42. Importantly, expression of constitutively active V12Cdc42 also blocked reorientation of the MTOC in response to shear stress, indicating that correct spatial activation of Cdc42 rather than activity per se is essential for localization of the MTOC after shear stress. Expression of the Cdc42-binding domain of Wiscott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (29Tran Van Nhieu G. Caron E. Hall A. Sansonetti P.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3249-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) also abolished reorientation of the MTOC. To investigate the role of other members of the Rho GTPase family in the microtubule-dependent establishment of polarity, cells were transfected with dominant negative Rho and Rac. Polarization of the MTOC was unaffected by dominant negative Rac (N17Rac) or Rho (N19Rho). Previous investigators reported that the Par6-PKCζ complex controls cell polarity (11Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Cell. 2001; 106: 489-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 30Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Expression of the PDZ-mutated mPar6 or an N-terminal deletion mutant abolished MTOC reorientation in response to shear stress. By contrast, WTPAR6 had no effect. The N-terminal domain of mPar6 interacts with atypical PKCs (31Joberty G. Petersen C. Gao L. Macara I.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). To identify whether an atypical PKC is involved, we expressed a kinase-dead version of PKCζ in cells. This construct but not WTPKCζ blocked MTOC polarization in response to shear stress. We conclude that the mPar6/PKCζ is required for Cdc42-dependent orientation of the MTOC. Shear stress promotes integrin activation followed by formation of new integrin-ECM interactions, leading to changes in Shc, Rho, and Rac signaling pathways (14Tzima E. del Pozo M.A. Shattil S.J. Chien S. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4639-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 15Tzima E. Del Pozo M.A. Kiosses W.B. Mohamed S.A. Li S. Chien S.

A. 2001; 98: 1042-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Additionally, integrins can activate Cdc42 (14Tzima E. del Pozo M.A. Shattil S.J. Chien S. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4639-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 15Tzima E. Del Pozo M.A. Kiosses W.B. Mohamed S.A. Li S. Chien S. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6791-6800Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 25Price L.S. Leng J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 32Cox E.A. Sastry S.K. Huttenlocher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We now report that shear stress transiently activates Cdc42 and that blockade of new integrin-ligand connections blocks this event. Integrin-ligand binding therefore mediates activation of Cdc42 by shear stress. Previous studies showed that fluid flow induces formation of focal adhesions preferentially at the down-stream edge of the cells (33Davies P.F. Robotewskyj A. Griem M.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2031-2038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with the preferential activation of Cdc42 in a directional polarized manner downstream relative to the direction of fluid flow. Importantly, Cdc42 activation per se is not sufficient for MTOC reorientation since expression of V12Cdc42 also blocks MTOC orientation. Thus, polarized activity of Cdc42 is critical for correct orientation of MTOC. This result is particularly interesting in light of the role of Rac in shear stress-induced alignment. The correct spatial activation of Rac is required for the orientation of stress fibers with the direction of flow (15Tzima E. Del Pozo M.A. Kiosses W.B. Mohamed S.A. Li S. Chien S. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6791-6800Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In addition, although Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 all control the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (34Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar), only Cdc42 was responsible for shear stress-induced MTOC reorientation. In agreement with our findings, high Cdc42 activity was also observed at the leading edge of migrating cells using the Raichu-Cdc42 probe (35Itoh R.E. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Yoshizaki H. Mochizuki N. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar); however, this probe is constitutively membrane-bound. Thus the effect of Rho-guanidine dissociation inhibitor-dependent membrane-cytoplasm dynamics, which is an important aspect of GTPase localization (23Del Pozo M.A. Kiosses W.B. Alderson N.B. Meller N. Hahn K.M. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), could not be monitored. The results presented here provide a mechanism through which Cdc42 regulates the microtubule-dependent establishment of cell polarity under shear stress as the Cdc42 target protein, PAR6, and its associated protein, PKCζ, are essential for the reorientation of the MTOC. PAR proteins were identified as key regulators of cell polarity in early Caenorhabditis elegans development (36Kemphues K.J. Priess J.R. Morton D.G. Cheng N.S. Cell. 1988; 52: 311-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Our data show that PAR6 and PKCζ are involved in a signaling pathway directly responsible for the reorientation of the MTOC in response to shear stress. In conclusion, our results define a signal transduction pathway controlled by Cdc42 that links integrin activation and engagement to the establishment of polarity in cells subjected to shear stress. The formation of new integrin-ligand connections seems to be the first polarity signal, which leads to localized activation of Cdc42. Spatially restricted activation of Cdc42 then establishes and maintains polarity by promoting PAR6/PKCζ-dependent reorientation of the MTOC in the direction of flow. MTs are the first cytoskeletal components to assume orientation during cell shape change (37Oakley C. Brunette D.M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 343-354PubMed Google Scholar). They play a central role in alignment in the direction of flow as disruption of MTs blocks EC alignment by flow and prevents the induction of actin stress fibers (26Malek A.M. Izumo S. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 713-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional link among integrins, Cdc42, and MTs is therefore essential to the endothelial response to fluid shear stress. We are grateful to Nazilla Alderson for technical assistance. We thank Dr. I. Macara for supplying us with PAR6 and PKCζ constructs, Dr. Ken Yamada for generously providing anti-fibronectin monoclonal antibodies, and Dr. Klaus Hahn for advice in the development of Cdc42 FRET assays."
https://openalex.org/W2115328825,"Up to 50% of the increase in marine animal biodiversity through the Cenozoic at the genus level has been attributed to a sampling bias termed ""the Pull of the Recent,"" the extension of stratigraphic ranges of fossil taxa by the relatively complete sampling of the Recent biota. However, 906 of 958 living genera and subgenera of bivalve mollusks having a fossil record occur in the Pliocene or Pleistocene. The Pull of the Recent thus accounts for only 5% of the Cenozoic increase in bivalve diversity, a major component of the marine record, suggesting that the diversity increase is likely to be a genuine biological pattern."
https://openalex.org/W2007610433,"Heterotrimeric G-proteins of the Gα12/13 family activate Rho GTPase through the guanine nucleotide exchange factor p115RhoGEF. Because Rho activation is also dependent on protein kinase Cα (PKCα), we addressed the possibility that PKCα can also induce Rho activation secondary to the phosphorylation of p115RhoGEF. Studies were made using human umbilical vein endothelial cells in which we addressed the mechanisms of PKCα-induced Rho activation and its consequences on actin cytoskeletal changes. We observed that PKCα associated with p115RhoGEF within 1 min of thrombin stimulation and p115RhoGEF phosphorylation was dependent on PKCα. Inhibition of PKCα-dependent p115RhoGEF phosphorylation prevented the thrombin-induced Rho activation, indicating that the response occurred downstream of PKCα phosphorylation of p115RhoGEF. The regulator of G-protein signaling domain of p115RhoGEF, a GTPase activating protein for G12/13, also prevented thrombin-induced Rho activation, indicating the parallel requirement of G12/13 in signaling Rho activation via p115RhoGEF. These data demonstrate a pathway of Rho activation involving PKCα-dependent phosphorylation of p115RhoGEF. Thus, Rho activation in endothelial cells and the subsequent actin cytoskeletal re-arrangement require the cooperative interaction of both G12/13 and PKCα pathways that converge at p115RhoGEF.

The Dbl domain upon binding to Rho induces GDP/GTP exchange, whereas the PH domain acts as a membrane-anchoring domain for RhoGEF. p115RhoGEF structure is complex in that it contains a homologous core regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) domain at its N-terminal region by which p115RhoGEF interacts with α-subunits of G12/13 and functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for G12/13.

Chem. 2001; 276: 22614-22620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) that PKCα triggered Rho activation and promoted actin cytoskeletal changes in endothelial cells. As it is possible that PKCα may regulate Rho activation by inducing the phosphorylation of p115RhoGEF, the present study was carried out to determine the role of PKCα in signaling p115RhoGEF activation, and in thus triggering Rho-dependent endothelial actin re-arrangement. Materials—Human α-thrombin was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and endothelial growth medium (EBM-2) were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). Trypsin was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Anti-p115RhoGEF, anti-PKCα, anti-RhoA, normal goat IgG, and protein A/G beads were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (San Diego, CA). H3PO4 was purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals (Costa Mesa, CA). Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride, and Prolong Antifade kit were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Electrodes for transendothelial electrical resistance measurements were purchased from Applied Biosciences (Troy, NY). Gö6976 was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Rho activation kit containing GST-rhotekin-Rho-binding domain beads was purchased from Cytoskeleton (Denver, CO). Endothelial Cell Culture—HUVECs were cultured in a T-75 flask coated with 0.1% gelatin in EBM-2 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air until they formed a confluent monolayer. Cells from each of the primary flasks were detached with 0.025% Trypsin/EDTA and plated on either 100 mm dishes for phosphorylation analysis, 8-well electrodes for electrical impedance measurements, 6-well plates for serum response element (SRE) luciferase assays, or the cells were grown on coverslips for immunofluorescence microscopy as described below. In all experiments, the monolayer of HUVEC was incubated for 1–2 h in MCDB131 serum-free medium before treatment with inhibitors or agonists. In all experiments, cells were used between passages 4–8. DEAE dextran or Superfect was used for transfection of endothelial cells as specified by the suppliers' protocols. Adenoviral Infections—Adenoviral constructs containing the dominant negative mutant of PKCα (Adv-dnPKCα; K368R) was a generous gift from Dr. Viswanathnan Natarajan (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD). Cells grown to confluence in 100 mm dishes (phosphorylation and Rho activation) or on 12 mm coverslips (immunohistochemistry) were infected with 1 × 107 pfu of Adv-dnPKCα for 5 h in serum-containing medium, after which the media was replaced with fresh media. In parallel, monolayers were infected with adenovirus containing the β-galactosidase gene, LacZ (Adv-LacZ), to control for any nonspecific effects of viral infection on endothelial cell signaling. Adv-infected cells were then used to measure p115RhoGEF phosphorylation, Rho activation, and actin stress fiber formation as described below. Phosphorylation of p115RhoGEF—After serum deprivation for 1 h, HUVECs were labeled with 150 μCi/ml 32P for 4 h in phosphate-free minimum Eagle's medium. Cells were then stimulated with 50 nm α-thrombin for the indicated times, quickly transferred on ice, and washed 2× with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 500 μm Na3VO4 and lysed using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Triton-X, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 2 μg/ml each of pepstatin A, leupeptin, and aprotinin). After centrifugation, the cleared lysate was incubated with either control IgG or anti-goat polyclonal p115RhoGEF Ab for 2 h followed by addition of protein A/G plus agarose beads overnight. The beads were then collected by centrifugation, washed 6× with detergent-free radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 0.05% SDS and 2 μg/ml each of pepstatin A, leupeptin, and aprotinin). The above procedures were performed at 4 °C. Protein from each sample was eluted by boiling the beads in SDS sample buffer, electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose for visualization of p115RhoGEF phosphorylation by autoradiography followed by Western blotting with p115RhoGEF antibody to verify equal protein loading. Specificity of p115RhoGEF antibody was confirmed using normal goat IgG as negative control. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Endothelial cells grown to confluence in 100 mm dishes were serum-deprived after which they were stimulated with 50 nm α-thrombin for the indicated times. Cells were then washed 2× with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and protein concentration was determined. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein (300 μg) were incubated with 3 μg of either control IgG or anti-p115RhoGEF Ab or anti-PKCα Ab. After 2 h, 20 μl of protein A/G beads were added, and the samples were incubated overnight. Each sample was then centrifuged to retrieve the precipitated complex on the beads and washed 4× with wash buffer followed by addition of sample buffer. Proteins from each sample were eluted by boiling the beads, separated by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting with the antibody of interest. Measurement of Rho Activity—Rho activity was measured using GST-rhotekin-Rho-binding domain (GST-RBD) that specifically pulls down activated Rho (5van Nieuw Amerongen G.P. van Delft S. Vermeer M.A. Collard J.G. van Hinsbergh V.W. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 335-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Following infection with Adv-constructs as described above, HUVECs were serum-deprived for 1 h. Cells were then stimulated with 50 nm α-thrombin, quickly washed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline, and lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 500 μg/ml tosyl arginine methyl ester, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin). Cell lysates were immediately centrifuged at 8,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min and equal volumes of lysates were incubated with 30 μg GST-RBD beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 3× with wash buffer (25 mm Tris pH 7.5, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl), and bound Rho was eluted by boiling each sample in Laemmli sample buffer. Eluted samples from the beads and total cell lysate were then electrophoresed on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked with 5% nonfat milk, and analyzed by Western blotting using a polyclonal anti-RhoA antibody. Actin Stress Fibers—Following infection with Adv-constructs or indicated inhibitor, cells were stimulated for 5 min with 50 nm α-thrombin, rinsed quickly with ice cold Hank's balanced salt solution, and fixed with 4% paraformaldahyde. Cells were permeabilized for 3 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in Hank's balanced salt solution followed by incubation for 20 min with bovine serum albumin. Cells were then incubated with Alexa-568 phalloidin to label stress fibers. Following incubation, cells were rinsed 6× with Hank's balanced salt solution and mounted on slides using Prolong antifade mounting kit. Cells were viewed with a Zeiss LSM-510 confocal microscope using appropriate filters. Reporter Gene Constructs, Endothelial Cell Transfection, and Luciferase Assay—We used SRE reporter gene activity to address the role of p115RhoGEF in inducing Rho activation (28Hehner S.P. Hofmann T.G. Dienz O. Droge W. Schmitz M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18160-18171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We used a mutant containing the p115-RGS domain (RGS mutant) to address its role in thrombin-induced Rho activation. Transfections were performed using the DEAE-dextran method as described (14Mehta D. Rahman A. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22614-22620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). DNA (2.5 μg of p115-RGS cDNA and 2.4 μg of SRE luciferase cDNA) containing the RGS mutant of p115 and 2.4 μg of SRE luciferase were mixed with 50 μg/ml DEAE-dextran in serum-free MCDB131 medium, and the mixture was added onto confluent cells. For determining the role of PKCα-induced p115RhoGEF phosphorylation in signaling Rho activation, the transfected cells were treated with Gö6976 for 1 h prior to stimulation. pTKRLUC plasmid (0.1 μg) (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) containing Renilla luciferase gene driven by the constitutively active thymidine kinase promoter was added to normalize the transfection efficiencies. After 1 h, cells were incubated for 4 min with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) in serum-free medium, washed 2× with EBM-2 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and grown to confluence. Following 6 h of stimulation with 50 nm α-thrombin, cell extracts were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega). SRE-luciferase activity was expressed as the ratio of firefly and Renilla luciferase activity. Transendothelial Electrical Resistance—The time course of endothelial cell retraction, a measure of increased endothelial permeability, was assessed according to described procedures (34Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. Del Vecchio P.J. Keese C.R. Giaever I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7919-7923Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Briefly, HUVECs grown to confluence on gelatin-coated small gold electrodes (4.9 × 104 cm2) were serum-deprived for 1 h, after which they were treated with the indicated reagent prior to thrombin stimulation. For studies involving the p115-RGS mutant, endothelial cells grown to 70% confluence were transfected using Superfect transfection reagent following supplier's protocol. Cells were then stimulated with 50 nm α-thrombin to determine transendothelial electrical resistance across the monolayer. The small electrode and larger counter electrode were connected to a phase-sensitive lock-in amplifier. A constant current of 1 μA was supplied by a 10 V 4 KHz alternating current connected serially to a 1 mΩ resistor between the small electrode and the larger counter electrode. The voltage between the small and large electrode was monitored by a lock-in amplifier, stored, and processed on a PC. Data are presented as percentage change in their resistive (in-phase) portion of impedance normalized to its initial value at time zero. Thrombin-induced Phosphorylation of p115RhoGEF in Endothelial Cells Is PKCα-dependent—Cells grown to confluence were labeled with 32P-H3PO4 after which they were stimulated with thrombin, immunoprecipitated with p115RhoGEF Ab, and electrophoresed to determine p115RhoGEF phosphorylation by autoradiography. Thrombin induced the phosphorylation of p115RhoGEF within 1 min, and the response was sustained for 10 min after thrombin challenge (Fig. 1, A and B). We investigated the possibility that thrombin induces p115RhoGEF phosphorylation in a PKCα-dependent manner. We used Gö6976, an inhibitor of PKCα (35Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as an adenoviral construct containing the kinase-defective mutant of PKCα (Adv-dnPKCα), to address the role of PKCα in thrombin-induced phosphorylation of p115RhoGEF. Fig. 2A shows the autoradiograph of p115RhoGEF phosphorylation in response to thrombin in cells treated with Gö6976 (100 nm). Pretreatment with Gö6976 significantly reduced the thrombin-induced phosphorylation of p115RhoGEF (Fig. 2, A and B). To corroborate these findings, we over-expressed the kinase-defective mutant of PKCα by infecting endothelial cells with Adv-dnPKCα (Fig. 2C). In parallel, monolayers were infected with adenovirus containing the β-galactosidase gene, LacZ (Adv-LacZ), to control for the nonspecific effects of viral infection on endothelial cell signaling. As shown in Fig. 2D, thrombin induced the phosphorylation of p115RhoGEF in cells infected with Adv-LacZ; however, thrombin failed to induce the phosphorylation in cells over-expressing Adv-dnPKCα. Association of PKCα with p115RhoGEF—To determine whether thrombin-induced regulation of p115RhoGEF by PKCα required their interaction, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either control IgG, anti-p115RhoGEF Ab, or anti-PKCα Ab. Immunoprecipitated samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with anti-p115RhoGEF, anti-PKCξ, or PKCα Abs. As shown in Fig. 3, thrombin induced the association of PKCα with p115RhoGEF regardless of whether lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PKCα or anti-p115RhoGEF Abs. In contrast under similar conditions, PKCξ and control goat IgG showed no interaction with p115RhoGEF (Fig. 3). PKCα Phosphorylation of p115RhoGEF Activates Rho—To determine whether the PKCα-induced phosphorylation of p115RhoGEF is capable of signaling Rho activation, we measured Rho activation using the GST-Rhotekin fusion protein in cells over-expressing Adv-dnPKCα. Following viral infection, cells were stimulated with thrombin, and the lysates from cells infected with Adv-dnPKCα or Adv-LacZ were incubated with Rhotekin bound to GST beads to determine Rho activation. As shown in Fig. 4A, the inhibition of p115RhoGEF phosphorylation prevented the thrombin-induced Rho activation.

We used the N-terminal RGS domain of p115RhoGEF (p115-RGS), which inhibits p115RhoGEF function by blocking the interaction of p115RhoGEF with the α-subunits of G12/13 and by its GAP activity on Gα12/13, to address the role of G12/G13-induced Rho activation in endothelial actin cytoskeletal alterations. Thrombin induced the formation of actin stress fibers in cells infected with Adv-LacZ (Fig. 4B). However, thrombin failed to induce stress fiber formation in cells when PKCα function was inhibited by treatment with Gö6976 or after over-expression of dnPKCα (Fig. 4B). Inhibition of p115RhoGEF function by over-expressing the p115-RGS mutant also blocked thrombin-induced stress fiber formation. Thrombin induced a marked increase in SRE generation in control cells indicative of Rho activation, whereas this response was attenuated in the absence of PKCα or G12/13 activation (Fig. 4C). Inhibition of p115RhoGEF Activation by Blocking Gα 12/13 or PKCα Pathways Prevents Endothelial Cell Retraction—We measured transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) to determine the functional relevance of PKCα- and Gα12/13-induced 115RhoGEF activation in signaling endothelial barrier disruption. In cells transfected with vector alone, thrombin caused a significant decrease in TER, whereas this response was significantly reduced in cells either transfected with p115-RGS or treated with Gö6976 (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast, PKCβ inhibition using the PKCβ-specific inhibitor LY379196 did not show an appreciable alteration of the TER response (Fig. 5C). Thus, inhibition of Gα12/13 signaling or the PKCα-dependent phosphorylation of p115RhoGEF both prevent the thrombin-induced increase in transendothelial monolayer permeability (Fig. 5D), indicating that both signals converge on p115RhoGEF to activate barrier dysfunction. Rho is activated by the G12/13 family of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins through the stimulation of GEF activity of p115RhoGEF (23Wells C.D. Liu M.Y. Jackson M. Gutowski S. Sternweis P.M.

Using the N-terminal RGS domain of p115RhoGEF, which inhibits endogenous p115RhoGEF function by blocking its interaction with the α-subunits of G12/13 and by its GAP activity on Gα12/13, we show that thrombin activates Rho-dependent signaling and the endothelial permeability response via the G12/13 pathway. However, our results demonstrate the existence of another equally important parallel pathway activated by PKCα that also regulates p115RhoGEF function. We show that p115RhoGEF is phosphorylated within 1 min of thrombin stimulation. The phosphorylation of p115RhoGEF is mediated by PKCα as is evident by the experiments employing the PKCα inhibitor Gö6976 and expression of the kinase-defective PKCα mutant. PKCα was found to interact with p115RhoGEF after thrombin stimulation, implying that association of the two may be required for p115RhoGEF activation. We also show that PKCα-dependent phosphorylation of p115RhoGEF plays an important functional role in Rho signaling because inhibition of the phosphorylation prevented the Rho activation as well as actin stress fiber formation and endothelial barrier disruption responses. Taken together, these findings demonstrate an important role of PKCα-induced p115RhoGEF phosphorylation in the mechanism of activation of the Rho pathway in endothelial cells and its downstream effects on the actin cytoskeletal and endothelial barrier function. It is known that the GTP-binding/GTPase cycle activated by p115RhoGEF regulates Rho activation (38Kozasa T. Life Sci. 2001; 68: 2309-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). p115RhoGEF is a specific RhoGEF for Rho (20Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Sternweis P.C. Bollag G. Science. 1998; 280: 2112-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 24Wells C. Jiang X. Gutowski S. Sternweis P.C. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 37Hart M.J. Sharma S. el Masry N. Qiu R.G. McCabe P. Polakis P. Bollag G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25452-25458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar); however, little is known about the regulation of p115RhoGEF beyond that it is controlled by Gα12/13. The activation of p115RhoGEF involves its translocation from the cytosol to membrane as shown in NIH3T3 and COS-7 cells in response to lysophosphatidic acid stimulation. Studies showed that thrombin-induced Rho activation was PKCα-dependent (14Mehta D. Rahman A. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22614-22620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that PKCα phosphorylation of p115RhoGEF may be a parallel pathway mediating Rho activation. In this study, we provide evidence that PKCα-dependent phosphorylation of p115RhoGEF is capable of triggering the Rho pathway, and is thus involved in the mechanism of endothelial cell actin rearrangement and barrier dysfunction. Inhibition of PKCα-dependent p115RhoGEF phosphorylation significantly reduced the thrombin-induced decrease in TER, indicating that the phosphorylation is crucial in signaling the loss of endothelial barrier function. The observed association of PKCα with p115RhoGEF within 1 min of thrombin stimulation suggests that both components rapidly interact to induce p115RhoGEF phosphorylation. Because PKCα is a downstream effector of Gαq, our data suggests that the response is the result of Gαq-activated signaling. This result is consistent with the concept of dual regulation of p115RhoGEF that involves both the Gαq-PKCα and the Gα12/13 pathways. Thus, p115RhoGEF is positioned at the confluent point of these pathways because the activation of p115RhoGEF by either PKCα or Gα12/13 is sufficient to signal Rho activation and induce actin stress fiber formation and increase endothelial permeability. Among several GEFs identified, p115RhoGEF has the capability of not only activating but also inhibiting Rho activation following stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptors. p115RhoGEF contains an RGS domain at its N terminus through which it interacts with Gα12/13 (20Hart M.J.

Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar), thus providing a direct link between the Gα12/13-coupled receptor stimulation and Rho activity. The RGS sequence inactivates Gα12/13 signaling via its GAP activity (26Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). In the present study, we addressed the role of the RGS domain in thrombin-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction. We observed that the effects of expressing the RGS sequence of p115RhoGEF on endothelial barrier function were similar to that observed upon inhibition of PKCα phosphorylation of p115RhoGEF in that the mutant and inhibiting PKCα phosphorylation of p115RhoGEF prevented thrombin-induced Rho activation, actin stress fiber formation, and loss of endothelial barrier function. Thus, the activation of p115RhoGEF requires not only Gα12/13 but also PKCα-dependent phosphorylation of p115RhoGEF. The present results point to a new model of Rho activation in endothelial cells that requires the convergence of PKCα and Gα12/13 signaling pathways at p115RhoGEF. The activation of Rho by this mechanism is crucial in signaling actin cytoskeletal re-arrangement and the subsequent loss of endothelial barrier function.

We provide evidence that amiodarone toxicity is mediated by disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In mutants lacking calcineurin and various Ca2+ transporters, including pumps (Pmr1 and Pmc1), channels (Cch1/Mid1 and Yvc1), and exchangers (Vcx1), amiodarone sensitivity correlates with cytoplasmic calcium overload. Measurements of cytosolic Ca2+ by aequorin luminescence demonstrate a biphasic response to amiodarone. An immediate and extensive calcium influx was observed that was dose-dependent and correlated with drug sensitivity. The second phase consisted of a sustained release of calcium from the vacuole via the calcium channel Yvc1 and was independent of extracellular Ca2+ entry. To uncover additional cellular pathways involved in amiodarone sensitivity, we conducted a genome-wide screen of nearly 5000 single-gene yeast deletion mutants. 36 yeast strains with amiodarone hypersensitivity were identified, including mutants in transporters (pmr1, pdr5, and vacuolar H+-ATPase), ergosterol biosynthesis (erg3, erg6, and erg24), intracellular trafficking (vps45 and rcy1), and signaling (ypk1 and ptc1). Of three mutants examined (vps45, vma3, and rcy1), all were found to have defective calcium homeostasis, supporting a correlation with amiodarone hypersensitivity. We show that low doses of amiodarone and an azole (miconazole, fluconazole) are strongly synergistic and exhibit potent fungicidal effects in combination.

The emergence of drug-resistant fungi poses an increasing threat to the treatment of opportunistic fungal infections in patients with compromised immune systems, as occurs commonly in cancer and AIDS. This can only be countered by the discovery of new antifungal agents, particularly those that target different molecular pathways, and a better understanding of their mode of action. Recently, the antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone (AMD) 1The abbreviations used are: AMD, amiodarone; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetracetic acid; FLUC, fluconazole; MIC, miconazole; RLU, relative luminescence unit(s); WT, wild type; SC, synthetic complete.1The abbreviations used are: AMD, amiodarone; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetracetic acid; FLUC, fluconazole; MIC, miconazole; RLU, relative luminescence unit(s); WT, wild type; SC, synthetic complete. was shown to have potent fungicidal activity against not only Saccharomyces but also pathogenic yeasts such as Candida, Cryptococcus, Fusarium, and Aspergillus (1Courchesne W.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 300: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Viability of Cryptococcus neoformans after exposure to 10 μm AMD fell dramatically, with a 10-fold loss of viable cells after1hof treatment and only 0.001% viable cells remaining after 1 day. The cytotoxic effect of AMD appeared to be mediated by calcium, as evidenced by the ability of high (millimolar) concentrations of extracellular Ca2+ to ameliorate drug toxicity (1Courchesne W.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 300: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and by an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ upon drug application (2Courchesne W.E. Ozturk S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). There is emerging evidence that cytosolic Ca2+ entry in yeast is critical for survival under a variety of cell stresses, including hyper- and hypo-osmotic shock, protein unfolding agents, and antifungal drugs (3Cruz M.C. Goldstein A.L. Blankenship J.R. Del Poeta M. Davis D. Cardenas M.E. Perfect J.R. McCusker J.H. Heitman J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 546-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 4Matsumoto T.K. Ellsmore A.J. Cessna S.G. Low P.S. Pardo J.M. Bressan R.A. Hasegawa P.M. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 2002; 46: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The release of calcium from intracellular stores must be compensated by stimulation of extracellular calcium influx, a phenomenon commonly known as capacitative calcium entry (7Locke E.G. Bonilla M. Liang L. Takita Y. Cunningham K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6686-6694Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Thus, one possibility is that the cytosolic Ca2+ increase in response to AMD promotes cell survival and is due to capacitative calcium entry, as has been suggested by Courchesne and Ozturk (2Courchesne W.E. Ozturk S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, excessive or unregulated levels of calcium in the cytoplasm also lead to cell death and are implicated in the cytotoxicity of several drugs (8Andjelic S. Khanna A. Suthanthiran M. Nikolic-Zugic J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2527-2534PubMed Google Scholar) as well as fungal toxins (9Kurzweilova H. Sigler K. Folia Microbiol. 1993; 38: 524-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 10Lecourieux D. Mazars C. Pauly N. Ranjeva R. Pugin A. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2627-2641Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). To better understand the role of calcium in AMD toxicity, it is important to distinguish between a capacitative calcium entry mechanism triggered by store depletion or a loss in calcium homeostasis, possibly due to an effect of the drug on ion channels and transporters. The experiments described in this work address these two possibilities and begin to elucidate the cellular basis of AMD toxicity. We present a detailed investigation of how AMD disrupts Ca2+ homeostasis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The roles of different Ca2+ transporters, including pumps (Pmr1 and Pmc1), channels (Cch1, Mid1, and Yvc1), and exchangers (Vcx1), were evaluated in cells lacking these proteins and exposed to relatively low, therapeutically relevant levels of AMD. Pmr1 is an ATP-driven pump that sequesters Ca2+ and Mn2+ into the Golgi/secretory pathway and maintains cellular ion homeostasis under normal growing conditions (11Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Cell. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 12Marchi V. Sorin A Wei Y. Rao R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Homologues of Pmr1 are widely distributed in organisms including Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and humans and constitute the newly recognized SPCA subtype of Ca2+-ATPases (13Ton V.-K. Mandal D. Vahadji C. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6422-6427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Pmc1 is the yeast Ca2+ pump related to mammalian plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases that is induced under calcium stress (14Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) or in the absence of Pmr1 (12Marchi V. Sorin A Wei Y. Rao R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and serves to detoxify excess Ca2+ by sequestration into the vacuole. Vacuolar calcium sequestration is also accomplished by the H+/Ca2+ exchanger, Vcx1 (15Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 16Pozos T.C. Sekler I. Cyert M.S. Mol. Cell.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), which requires the proton electrochemical gradient generated by the vacuolar H+-ATPase. Calcium release from the vacuole is mediated by Yvc1, a transient receptor potential-like Ca2+ channel (18Palmer C.P. Zhou X.L. Lin J. Loukin S.H. Kung C. Saimi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7801-7805Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Cch1 is the yeast homologue of mammalian voltage-gated calcium channels and, together with the stretch-activated Ca2+ channel Mid1, constitutes a Ca2+ entry channel at the plasma membrane (19Paidhungat M. Garrett S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6339-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). There is experimental evidence for at least one other calcium influx channel of unknown molecular identity (5Bonilla M Nastase K.K. Cunningham K.W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2343-2353Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 20Muller E.M. Locke E.G. Cunningham K.W. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1527-1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these proteins regulate cellular calcium levels and are critical for proper functioning of the calcium signaling cascade. Calcium activation of calmodulin and the consequent activation of the calcium- and calmodulin-activated protein phosphatase, calcineurin, are believed to lead to a number of transcriptional and post-translational signals that mediate a variety of different cellular responses to extracellular cues, including cell cycle progression and the protein kinase C-mediated cell wall integrity pathway (reviewed in Refs. 21Cyert M.S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 647-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar and 22Fox D.S. Heitman J. Bioessays. 2002; 24: 894-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The conservation of several components of the calcium homeostatic machinery with higher eukaryotes makes yeast an excellent model to study the role of calcium signaling in AMD toxicity. The results of our analysis of deletion mutants point to a requirement for Pmr1-mediated Ca2+ homeostasis in the growth response to AMD. Similar to recent observations on other drug resistance mechanisms (3Cruz M.C. Goldstein A.L. Blankenship J.R. Del Poeta M. Davis D. Cardenas M.E. Perfect J.R. McCusker J.H. Heitman J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 546-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 6Edlind T. Smith L. Henry K. Katiyar S. Nickels J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we also demonstrate a critical role for calcineurin in AMD tolerance. Analyses of cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels by aequorin luminescence assays indicate a correlation between AMD-induced cytosolic Ca2+ increase and growth toxicity. Specifically, AMD seems to cause both Ca2+ influx at the cell membrane and release from internal stores, including the vacuole. To identify additional factors that mediate drug sensitivity, we screened nearly 5000 single-gene deletion mutants for hypersensitivity to AMD. We identify 36 mutants, implicated in known and novel pathways that may be important for drug resistance and detoxification. The results of this study indicate that AMD kills yeast by a mechanism different from that used by conventional antifungals such as the azoles and the polyenes. Finally, we show that low concentrations of AMD and an azole (miconazole and fluconazole) are strikingly synergistic in combination, suggesting that supplementation of conventional antifungal treatment with AMD may be a practical means of converting the fungistatic effect of the azoles into more effective fungicides. In summary, our findings provide important insights into the cellular effects of AMD and its potential efficacy in the treatment of fungal infections.

Data points are averages of duplicates, with S.D. equal to or less than 10%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Growth Assays for Drug Sensitivity—AMD was purchased from Sigma, dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide as a 20 mm stock, and stored at –20 °C. 10 μl of saturated seed cultures were inoculated in 3 ml of growth medium containing different concentrations of AMD (0–15 μm). Cultures were grown in a 30 °C shaker for 24 h, and growth was determined by optical density at 600 nm. To test the effect of divalent cations, AMD sensitivity was monitored in the presence of 10–25 mm CaCl2 or 10 mm MgCl2. Alternatively, the cation chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetracetic acid (BAPTA; Sigma) was added to final concentrations of 0.5 and 2 mm. To examine the role of calcineurin inhibition, FK506 was diluted from a stock of 0.2 mg/ml to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml and added to cell cultures grown in stationary 96-well plates at 30 °C. Miconazole and fluconazole were diluted from a stock of 5 mm (in Me2SO) or 2 mg/ml (in water), respectively. In the fluconazole screen with C. albicans, the seed culture was diluted by 1:100 and added to 1 ml of YPD containing different drug concentrations in a 24-well plate. After a 24–48-h incubation at 37 °C, 5 μl of cells were diluted into 1.5 ml of YPD containing no drugs and grown overnight. Growth was measured by absorbance at 600 nm. With C. neoformans, 50 μl of saturated seed culture was added to 5 ml of YPD supplemented with various drug concentrations. Cells were shaken vigorously for 20 h at 30 °C. 5 μl of cells exposed to AMD alone or 20 μl of cells exposed to both drugs were then diluted in 10 ml YPD and grown to saturation for 24–48 h. Growth was measured by absorbance at 600 nm. Genome-wide AMD Sensitivity Screen—200 μl of SC medium supplemented with 7 μm AMD was added to a 96-well plate and inoculated with 5 μl of freshly grown stationary phase yeast culture derived from single-gene deletion strains from the ResGen MATα deletion library (Invitrogen). Control cultures contained an equal volume of dimethyl sulfoxide. The plates were incubated at room temperature for a period of 12–24 h. Cultures were resuspended with a multichannel pipettor, and growth was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 600 nm in a SPECTRAmax 340 microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The relative growth of each strain was expressed as a percentage of A 600 of the control culture (i.e. no AMD). Strains with enhanced sensitivity to AMD were selected based on growth inhibition of 80% or greater relative to control. All candidate strains were retested for enhanced sensitivity in 4 and 8 μm AMD. Aequorin Luminescence Assay—Yeast strains were transformed with plasmid pEVP11-Aeq-89 (4Matsumoto T.K. Ellsmore A.J. Cessna S.G. Low P.S. Pardo J.M. Bressan R.A. Hasegawa P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33075-33080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) carrying the aequorin gene and then grown to midlog phase in SC medium lacking leucine. Cells were harvested, incubated with 0.25 mg/ml coelenterazine (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in the dark for 20 min, washed and resuspended in medium, and then incubated at 30 °C for 90 min to allow recovery. AMD (at specified concentrations) was added to 0.3 ml of cells in a cuvette through an injector, and luminescence was immediately recorded every second for 10 min in a luminometer (Lumat LB 9507). The maximal luminescence (L max) was determined as described (26Cruz M.C. Goldstein A.L. Blankenship J. Poeta M.D. Perfect J.R. McCusker J.M. Bennani Y.L. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. Antimicrob. Agents. Chemother. 2001; 45: 3162-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Specifically, cells were lysed with 1% digitonin in the presence of 1 m CaCl2, and a peak of RLU was recorded. Calcium concentration was calculated with Equation 1, [Ca2+]=((L/Lmax)1/3+[118(L/Lmax)1/3]-1)/(7×106-[7×106(L/Lmax)1/3])(Eq. 1) where L represents the RLU at a given time point. The base-line calcium concentration of pmc1 in SC and Me2SO was ∼0.38 μm, and that of pmr1 was about 0.52 μm. Methylene Blue Viability Assay—S. cerevisiae cells grown in media with and without the specified concentrations of AMD and miconazole were stained with methylene blue (Sigma) taken from a stock of 0.1 mg/ml. 250–300 cells were counted under a light microscope. Dead cells stain blue. FUN-1 Confocal Microscopy—The Live/Dead yeast viability kit was purchased from Molecular Probes. 50 μl of cells grown overnight in the presence or absence of drugs (as specified in Fig. 5) were incubated in SC medium at 30 °C for 1 h with 4 μm FUN-1 dye, which was diluted in SC from a stock of 200 μm in Me2SO. Immediately after incubation, the cells were examined under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (PerkinElmer UltraView LCI System) equipped with an inverted × 100 oil immersion objective lens. The fluorescent dye was excited at 488 nm by the krypton/argon laser. Conversion of FUN-1 into cylindrical intravacuolar structures was monitored by recording fluorescent micrographs at emission wavelengths of 600 nm (metabolically active and inactive cells) or 520 nm (metabolically inactive cells only). Pseudocolorization was done with Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe Systems Inc.). Hypersensitivity of the pmr1 Mutant to Amiodarone—To investigate the role of various calcium transport pathways in mediating drug sensitivity, we compared the growth of individual, isogenic gene deletion mutants in media supplemented with micromolar concentrations of AMD. As shown in Fig. 1A, the pmr1 mutant was strikingly more sensitive to AMD; in contrast, the pmc1 null strain showed a small but reproducible tolerance to the drug, relative to wild type. A survey of deletion mutants of the vacuolar H+/Ca2+ exchanger (vcx1) and all known Ca2+ channels in yeast (yvc1, cch1, and mid1) revealed a modest exacerbation of AMD sensitivity in both cch1 and mid1 mutants but not in the others (not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that some aspect of Ca2+ signaling, maintained in large part by the ATP-dependent calcium efflux pump, Pmr1, is important in mediating the growth toxicity of AMD. Extracellular Calcium Modulates Amiodarone Toxicity—Extracellular calcium has been reported to confer a dose-dependent abrogation of susceptibility to KP4 fungal toxin in the yeast Ustilago maydis (28Gage M.J. Bruenn J. Fischer M. Sanders D. Smith T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 775-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Here, 10 mm CaCl2 or MgCl2 appeared to protect cell growth against AMD toxicity, whereas BAPTA, a membrane-impermeant cation chelator, enhanced AMD toxicity, consistent with the removal of Ca2+ (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the protective effect of increasing Ca2+ concentrations (10–25 mm) on AMD sensitivity was most significant in strains lacking Pmr1 (not shown), which may reflect, at least in part, the known dependence of this strain on extracellular Ca2+ for optimum growth (29Durr G. Strayle J. Plemper R. Elbs S. Klee S.K. Catty P. Wolf D.H. Rudolph H.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1149-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Mn2+ can be a surrogate for Ca2+ in a number of physiological processes but was ineffective in conferring protection (data not shown). Monovalent ions (K+ and Na+) were previously reported to have little or no effect on AMD toxicity to yeast (1Courchesne W.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 300: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Ion Selectivity Mutants of Pmr1 Confirm the Specific Role of Calcium in Amiodarone Toxicity—Since Pmr1 mediates the high affinity transport of both Ca2+ and Mn2+ into the Golgi (11Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Cell. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 24Wei Y. Chen J. Rosas G. Tompkins D.A. Holt A. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23927-23932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), it was of interest to determine whether the enhanced sensitivity of pmr1 mutant to AMD was a consequence of a loss of Ca2+ or Mn2+ transport. We have previously described two ion selectivity mutants of Pmr1, Q783A and D53A, which show nearly exclusive transport of either Ca2+ or Mn2+, respectively (23Mandal D. Woolf T. Rao R. J. Biol. Cell. 2000; 273: 23933-23938Google Scholar, 24Wei Y. Chen J. Rosas G. Tompkins D.A. Holt A. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23927-23932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These mutants were expressed in a yeast strain devoid of endogenous Ca2+ pumps, with the additional deletion of calcineurin to maintain viability (pmr1pmc1cnb1) (11Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Cell. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 15Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Selective loss of Ca2+ transport in Pmr1 mutant D53A resulted in loss of tolerance to AMD, similar to the host strain lacking Pmr1 and Pmc1 (Fig. 1C). In contrast, selective loss of Mn2+ transport of mutant Q783A did not alter AMD sensitivity. These results are consistent with the inability of extracellular Mn2+ to protect against AMD toxicity, and they establish the specific role of Ca2+ ions in mediating the cellular effects of the drug. Loss of Calcineurin Function Enhances Toxicity of Amiodarone—Calcineurin has been shown to be nonessential for normal growth but critical for survival during membrane stress in C. albicans (3). The enhanced AMD sensitivity of the triple mutant, pmr1pmc1cnb1 (Fig. 1C) relative to the individual gene deletions (Fig. 1A) suggested that loss of calcineurin may be synergistic with loss of the Golgi Ca2+ pump Pmr1. To confirm this, we investigated the effect of FK506 (1 μg/ml), a potent inhibitor of calcineurin, on the AMD sensitivity of wild type and pmr1 strains (Fig. 1D). As predicted, the addition of FK506 exacerbated the AMD sensitivity of the pmr1 mutant. Additionally, the cnb1 mutant, lacking functional calcineurin, displayed increased sensitivity to AMD at higher concentrations of the drug (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these data confirm the importance of calcineurin in the Ca2+ signaling pathway involved in drug sensitivity. Amiodarone Triggers Calcium Influx in Yeast Cells—Next, we investigated whether AMD induced calcium entry into yeast and whether calcium entry correlated with drug sensitivity. Calcium-dependent luminescence of the aequorin-coelenterazine photoprotein complex was monitored in the first few minutes immediately following drug addition. In all strains examined, application of AMD resulted in a biphasic elevation of cytoplasmic calcium that was dependent on AMD concentration (Fig. 2, A–C). The first peak of calcium occurred extremely fast (within 1–1.5 min) and was followed by a sustained rise that lasted for the duration of the assay. The magnitude of both phases, as well as the kinetics of the initial elevation was steeply dependent on AMD concentration, with maximal increase observed between 10 and 20 μm AMD. Elevation of cytosolic calcium was found to correlate with AMD sensitivity; thus, the addition of 10 μm AMD elicited the largest luminescence changes in the pmr1 mutant, whereas the pmc1 mutant showed similar changes relative to wild type (Fig. 2D). Estimated cytosolic calcium concentrations of the initial peak, based on the calibration described under “Experimental Procedures,” reached 0.7 μm in wild type and pmc1 and close to 1 μm in pmr1 cells; the second sustained rise remained around 0.5 μm for WT and pmc1 but stayed at 0.75 μm for pmr1. Ca2 + Entry in Response to AMD Comes from Extracellular and Intracellular Stores—It was of interest to determine the relative contribution of extracellular and intracellular Ca2+ stores to the biphasic elevations of cytosolic Ca2+ observed in Fig. 2. When we used the membrane-impermeant cation chelator BAPTA (5 mm) to deplete extracellular Ca2+, the first peak of AMD-induced aequorin luminescence in wild type cells was eliminated, indicating that external calcium contributed to the rapid, initial rise in cytoplasmic calcium (Fig. 3A). Following a short lag, a broad, sustained rise was observed in BAPTA-treated cells that probably corresponded to the second phase of luminescence seen in the absence of BAPTA. These results implied that Ca2+ release from intracellular stores must contribute to cytosolic elevation of Ca2+ and, further, that Ca2+ entry from extracellular sources is not required to trigger release from stores. The transient receptor potential-like channel Yvc1 has been shown to mediate Ca2+ release from the vacuole in response to hypertonic shock (30Denis V. Cyert M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We investigated the contribution of vacuolar Ca2+ release by examining aequorin luminescence in the yvc1 mutant (Fig. 3A). The changes in intracellular Ca2+ in the yvc1 mutant were essentially similar to wild type in the absence of BAPTA. The first peak of wild type cells reached ∼0.8–0.9 μm, and that of yvc1 was about 0.7 μm. The second sustained rise in both strains ranged from 0.59 to 0.66 μm of free calcium. Strikingly, BAPTA treatment completely abolished Ca2+ elevation in the yvc1 mutant. These results indicate that whereas the firs"
https://openalex.org/W2032267444,"Meiotic cohesin complexes at centromeres behave differently from those along chromosome arms, but the basis for these differences has remained elusive. The fission yeast cohesin molecule Rec8 largely replaces its mitotic counterpart, Rad21/Scc1, along the entire chromosome during meiosis. Here we show that Rec8 complexes along chromosome arms contain Rec11, whereas those in the vicinity of centromeres have a different partner subunit, Psc3. The armassociated Rec8-Rec11 complexes are critical for meiotic recombination. The Rec8-Psc3 complexes comprise two different types of assemblies. First, pericentromeric Rec8-Psc3 complexes depend on histone methylation-directed heterochromatin for their localization and are required for cohesion during meiosis II. Second, central core Rec8-Psc3 complexes form independently of heterochromatin and are presumably required for establishing monopolar attachment at meiosis I. These findings define distinct modes of assembly and functions for cohesin complexes at different regions along chromosomes."

Hsp70 facilitates the removal of injured proteins by ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. This process can be driven by geldanamycin, an irreversible blocker of Hsp90. We hypothesize that CAIR-1/BAG-3 inhibits Hsp-mediated proteasomal degradation. Human breast cancer cells were engineered to overexpress either full-length CAIR-1 (FL), which binds Hsp70, or a BAG domain-deletion mutant (dBAG) that cannot bind Hsp70. FL overexpression prevented geldanamycin-mediated loss of total and phospho-Akt and other Hsp client proteins. dBAG provided no protection, indicating a requirement for Hsp70 binding. Ubiquitinated Akt accumulated in FL-expressing cells, mimicking the effect of lactacystin proteasomal inhibition, indicating that CAIR-1 inhibits proteasomal degradation distal to protein ubiquitination in a BAG domain-dependent manner. Protein protection in FL cells was generalizable to downstream Akt targets, GSK3β, P70S6 kinase, CREB, and other Hsp client proteins, including Raf-1, cyclin-dependent kinase 4, and epidermal growth factor receptor.

Chaperoned client proteins are instead targeted for proteasomal degradation when the folding/re-folding activity of Hsp proteins is interrupted.

Hsp90 is a protective chaperone when complexed with p50/immunophilin, p23, and ATP but drives client proteins to poly-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation when ATP-depleted and bound in complex with Hsp70 and P60HOP (10Neckers L.

The removal of client proteins by proteasomal degradation is a potential mechanism of action for the regulation of cell survival, proliferation, and transforming activities in cancer and other cellular stresses and is thus a logical target for molecular therapeutics.

It binds irreversibly to the ATP-binding site of Hsp90 driving Hsp90-bound client proteins to the degradation pathway and preventing Hsp90 from recycling into a constructive protein chaperone mode. The current model of proteasomal degradation mediated through Hsp interaction places the client protein initially in complex with Hsp90, which then recruits Hsp70 and P60HOP (see Ref. 1McClellan A.J. Frydman J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E1-E3Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar and reviewed in Fig. 10). Client proteins are ubiquitinated by ubiquitin ligases (21Jiang J. Ballinger C.A. Wu Y.

Chem. 2001; 276: 42938-42944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), and these poly-ubiquitinated proteins are then targeted to the proteasome for destruction. We evaluated the effect of CAIR-1 on the fate of a client protein known to be degraded in response to GA to explore the role of CAIR-1 in Hsp70-Hsp90 complex-mediated proteasomal degradation. The serine/threonine kinase Akt/protein kinase B is one of several proven Hsp90 client proteins (22Basso A.D. Solit D.B. Munster P.N. Rosen N. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 23Sato S. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We now report that CAIR-1 abrogates the GA-driven degradation of Akt, allowing for continued Akt signaling. Whereas proteasomal degradation of Akt is markedly inhibited by CAIR-1, the capacity of Akt to be ubiquitinated in response to GA remains. Overexpression of CAIR-1 mimics the effect of the proteasomal inhibitor lactacystin, preventing the loss of poly-ubiquitinated proteins, without altering the capacity of the cell for ubiquitination. Inhibition of proteasomal degradation, similar to Akt, was observed for other Hsp90 client proteins. This suggests the negative co-chaperone function of CAIR-1 is a generalizable function. Protection of ubiquitinated client proteins is dependent upon the presence of the BAG domain, placing Hsp70 in a central position in this multimolecular degradation complex. These findings provide a possible explanation for the anti-apoptotic effects of CAIR-1 and suggest that targeting CAIR-1/Hsp70 interactions may be a novel molecular target for intervention.

Geldanamycin (GA) was generously provided by the Developmental Therapeutics Program, NCI, National Institutes of Health. Preparation of CAIR-1 Mutants and Stable Transfectants—The full-length human CAIR-1 (FL) and the BAG-domain deleted CAIR-1 (dBAG) sequences were generated by PCR from plasmid containing the full-length CAIR-1 message, previously verified and published sequence (26Doong H. Price J. Kim Y.S. Gasbarre C. Probst J. Liotta L.A. Blanchette J. Rizzo K. Kohn E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4385-4395Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Amplified sequence was confirmed prior to subcloning into pCIneo for stable transfection. The 50-amino acid BAG domain deletion mutant (dBAG; deleted amino acids 445–494) (14Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewksi S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar) was engineered with an novel internal HindIII site. Both FL and dBAG constructs are tagged with His6 at the N terminus. FL CAIR-1 was generated using primers 1 and 2 and dBAG by ligating the N terminus (primers 1 and 3; below) to the C terminus (primers 4 and 2).

Stable clonal cell lines were established with G418 selection. Cells were maintained in G418 400 μg/ml until split for treatment and lysis. Transient transfection was done to confirm the findings of the single cell clonal sublines. Briefly, MDA-435 cells were subjected to transfection using FuGENE 6 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. At 24 h, cells were washed, incubated with 2 μm GA for 18 h, and then lysed for study. Cells were transfected with His6-CAIR-1. CAIR-1 expression was confirmed by its His6 tag. Lysate Production and Immunoprecipitation and GST Pull-down Experiments—Cells were exposed to 10 μm lactacystin and/or 2 μm GA unless otherwise indicated, with a 0.1% Me2SO vehicle control. Total cell lysates were prepared from subconfluent cells using modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm Na3VO4,4mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate) and subjected to electrophoresis, electrical transfer to membrane, block and immunoblot, or immunoprecipitation followed by electrophoresis and immunoblot as described (26Doong H.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4385-4395Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). 10 mm iodoacetamide was added to the modified RIPA lysis buffer for studies of ubiquitination, and 4 m urea was included in the sample buffer for PARP immunoblots. The BAG domain (amino acids 445–494) was amplified, sequence-verified, and subcloned into pGEX-4T3 for expression according to manufacturer's instructions. Fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads for pull downs as described (26Doong H. Price J. Kim Y.S. Gasbarre C. Probst J. Liotta L.A. Blanchette J. Rizzo K. Kohn E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4385-4395Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) using 30 μg of lysate in 400 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% bovine serum albumin, and 5% glycerol). Complexes were rocked at 4 °C for 2 h and then washed 5 times in 1 ml of TENNS buffer (2.5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 2.5% sucrose) (26Doong H. Price J. Kim Y.S. Gasbarre C. Probst J. Liotta L.A. Blanchette J. Rizzo K. Kohn E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4385-4395Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Beads were resuspended in sample buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis and immunoblot. All data shown represent n ≥ 3 replicates. Heat Shock Injury—Cells were plated in serum-containing conditions and cultured overnight prior to heat shock. Culture dishes were placed in a 44 °C water bath for 40 min after which the cells were returned to the culture incubator. Cells were lysed at the indicated times and subjected to immunoblot analysis for cleaved caspase-3 and PARP as described above. CAIR-1 Abrogates GA-induced Loss of p-Akt and Total Akt in an Hsp70-dependent Fashion—Akt is a client protein of Hsp90 and is subject to proteasomal degradation in cells exposed to GA (22Basso A.D. Solit D.B. Munster P.N. Rosen N. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that CAIR-1 would alter the balance of the chaperone degradation system through its binding to Hsp70. Stably transfected cell lines expressing either full-length CAIR-1 (FL) or a BAG domain deletion mutant (dBAG), both with an engineered His6 tag or empty vector (neo), were generated to investigate this hypothesis (Fig. 1A). Transfection conditions did not result in changes in expression of CAIR-1, Hsp90, or Hsc70 (constitutive Hsp) protein (not shown) nor with 2 μm GA treatment of wild type cells for up to 18 h (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the previously reported GA-mediated induction of Hsp70 was confirmed. Stable transfectants were next subjected to GA treatment, resulting in loss of both p-Akt and total Akt in neo and dBAG cells (Fig. 1C). Cells overexpressing FL CAIR-1 showed a marked attenuation of GA-mediated loss. Hsp90, the specific molecular target for GA (19Grenert J.P. Sullivan W.P. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Clark J. Mimnaugh E. Krutzsch H. Ochel H.-J. Schulte T.W. Sausville E. Neckers L.M. Toft D.O. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24585-24588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), has been proposed to be the primary chaperone for Hsp-mediated protein degradation (10Neckers L. Schulte T.W. Mimnaugh E. Invest. New Drugs. 1999; 17: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). For this reason, the ability of CAIR-1 to bind to Hsp90 was assessed (Fig. 2). As no CAIR-1/Hsp90 binding was observed in immunoprecipitations of whole cell lysates (not shown), GST pull-down constructs were engineered and tested. The CAIR-1 BAG domain, when expressed as a GST fusion protein, selectively bound native (Fig. 2A, left panel) and recombinant Hsp70 (right panel) in pull-down experiments. It did not bind endogenous or purified Hsp90 (left and right panels, respectively; Fig. 2A, bottom). Furthermore, Hsp70 co-immunoprecipitated with FL but not dBAG from cell lysates, confirming the requirement for the BAG domain for association of CAIR-1 with Hsp70. Finally, commensurate with the increased quantity of Hsp70 with GA treatment (Fig. 1B), GA treatment also resulted in increased CAIR-1/Hsp70 immunocomplex formation (Fig. 2C). The dependence of the BAG domain, the site of interaction with Hsp70, and the lack of CAIR-1 binding to Hsp90 suggest a primary role for Hsp70 in the protection of Akt by CAIR-1. Akt Shifts Chaperone Binding from Hsp90 to Hsp70 during GA Exposure—Hsp90 client proteins have been shown to be subjected to proteasomal degradation (22Basso A.D. Solit D.B. Munster P.N. Rosen N. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We confirm Akt client binding to Hsp90 prior to and during early GA exposure (Fig. 3). Parallel time course experiments demonstrate that Akt shifts primary chaperone from Hsp90 to Hsp70 in the same time course where Hsp70 is induced by GA. A 20-fold increase in Akt-Hsp70 complex is seen in the face of a stable 1.5–2-fold increase in Akt/Hsp90, when corrected for the loss of Akt over time (p = 0.024, Mann-Whitney; Fig. 3C). FL cells accumulated more Akt-Hsp70 complex than neo control cells beginning 6 h into incubation with GA (12 versus >20-fold, p = <0.0001). This indicates that the chaperone shift of Akt from Hsp90 to Hsp70 proceeds also in the control setting where substantial loss of Akt is occurring. No co-precipitation of Hsp70 and Hps90 could be demonstrated, suggesting that there is a shuttling of the Akt client protein from Hsp90 to Hsp70. Furthermore, Akt does not bind to Hsc-70 in control or geldanamycin-treated cells (Fig. 3E), and geldanamycin does not induce Hsc70 production (data not shown). CAIR-1 Expression Prevents Degradation of Poly-ubiquitinated Akt—Current models for degradation of proteins chaperoned by the Hsp90 complex include poly-ubiquitination through Hsp70-associated ubiquitin ligases followed by proteasomal degradation (9Mimnaugh E. Chavany C. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22796-22801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The effect of CAIR-1 expression on Akt ubiquitination in response to GA exposure was next evaluated (Fig. 4). No notable accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated forms of Akt were observed in the absence of proteasome inhibition or CAIR-1 overexpression in neo vector control cells (Fig. 4A, upper panel). In contrast, substantial accumulation of ubiquitinated Akt was observed in GA-treated cells expressing FL (Fig. 4A, lower panel). Fig. 4B shows dBAG cells have a wild type phenotype, no accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated Akt (Fig. 4B, lanes 3–7 compared with lanes 8 and 9, neo and FL, respectively). The loss in total Akt in neo and dBAG cells compared with FL transfectants is shown in the lower panel. No difference in total protein ubiquitination was seen in the three cell lines arguing that there was no fundamental difference in the general function of the ubiquitin system (data not shown). A quantitative comparison of ubiquitinated Akt in the three cells is shown in Fig. 4C. The increase in ubiquitinated forms is dis-proportionate to the greater total Akt level in GA-treated FL cells compared with those expressing either neo or dBAG. These data suggest that GA is stimulating Akt ubiquitination and that CAIR-1 is preventing subsequent proteasomal degradation of the ubiquitinated forms. To evaluate this further, cells were treated with the irreversible proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin (27Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Cells were pretreated with lactacystin, and exposure to lactacystin continued during the GA treatment. This resulted in the accumulation of ubiquitinated forms of Akt, as might be expected for a ubiquitination substrate, in response to GA in neo and dBAG cells as well as in those expressing FL (Fig. 5, A and B). A quantitation of replicate experiments is shown in Fig. 5C, demonstrating the similar accumulation of ubiquitinated Akt in neo, dBAG, and FL cells. Lactacystin prevented the GA-induced loss of Akt in neo and dBAG cells consistent with a proteasomal route of degradation. It is possible that CAIR-1 initiates its protection of client proteins prior to interaction with the proteasome or that it occurs within that macromolecular complex. No evidence was found by co-immunoprecipitation studies that either CAIR-1 or Hsp70 interact directly with the regulatory or catalytic components of the proteasome (data not shown). Thus, CAIR-1 functions to prevent degradation of poly-ubiquitinated Akt in a BAG domain and Hsp70-dependent fashion. Akt Is a Substrate for Ubiquitination in the Absence of GA— Akt has been described to be a caspase substrate (28Widmann C. Gibson S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7141-7147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). It has not been shown previously to be ubiquitinated or degraded by the proteasome under nonpharmacologic conditions. Cells were thus exposed to lactacystin in the absence of GA and Akt protein, and ubiquitination was assessed (Fig. 6). Cells were exposed to lactacystin for a total of 22 h to mimic the duration of exposure used in the GA-driven ubiquitination experiments in Figs. 4 and 5. No difference in relative amounts of poly-ubiquitination or total Akt was detected in neo, dBAG, and FL cells. When exposed to GA, degradation of Akt is driven in the neo and dBAG cells but is attenuated markedly by CAIR-1 expression in FL cells. These studies demonstrate that Akt is a substrate for ubiquitination under physiologic culture conditions. CAIR-1 Protects Akt-mediated Phosphorylation of Akt Partner Proteins—Akt regulates the activation of multiple downstream partners (25Hemmings B.A. Science. 1997; 275: 628-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Protection of phosphorylation of the Akt downstream partners would be expected if the function of Akt was intact. Treatment with GA in neo control and dBAG cells resulted in loss of phosphorylated forms of the Akt downstream partner proteins glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), P70S6 kinase, and cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB; Fig. 7). In contrast, phosphorylated forms were observed at basal or near basal levels in FL cells. Some loss of total GSK-3β and P70S6 kinase protein was observed in GA-treated cells, suggesting that these proteins may themselves be clients for Hsp90/Hsp70 chaperoned degradation. Consistent with this possibility, ubiquitinated GSK-3β and P70S6 kinase was detected in GA-treated FL cells but not in neo control cells (Fig. 7B). These data show that Akt function is maintained by overexpression of FL CAIR-1 in the GA-treated cells. CAIR-1 Protects Other Hsp90 Client Proteins—The Hsp70-Hsp90 multimolecular chaperone complex is a general mechanism for signal pathway regulation through protein degradation. A number of Hsp90 client proteins have been identified (10Neckers L. Schulte T.W. Mimnaugh E. Invest. New Drugs. 1999; 17: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). To confirm that the effect of CAIR-1 may be a general mechanism, not limited to the Akt pathway, other well described Hsp90 client proteins were examined. Raf-1, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK-4), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been reported to be degraded upon GA treatment (20Schulte T.W. Blagosklonny M.V. Ingui C. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24585-24588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 22Basso A.D. Solit D.B. Munster P.N. Rosen N.

Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Their sensitivity to GA was confirmed in neo control cells and also observed in dBAG-expressing cells (Fig. 8). Similar to the findings shown for Akt and its downstream pathway partners, protection from GA-driven degradation of all three client proteins tested was observed in FL cells. Commensurate with this is the accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated forms of each client protein in FL cells in the absence of lactacystin (Fig. 8B). Therefore, the protective effect of CAIR-1 on poly-ubiquitinated chaperone client proteins appears to be a general means by which the chaperone degradation pathway can be regulated. Overexpression of CAIR-1 Is Not a Global Protectant for Cell Injury—We next examined the effect of CAIR-1 on heat shock and staurosporine in order to evaluate whether its protective effects are seen in other forms of injury. Heat shock was selected as it induces Hsp70 but has no effect on Hsp90 (31Bang O.-S. Ha B.-Y. Park E.K. Kang S.-S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and staurosporine because it prevents induction of Hsp70 in response to injury and does not involve Hsp90 (32Kim S.H. Kim J.H. Erdos G. Lee Y.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 759-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 33Erdos G. Lee Y.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cells were exposed at 44 °C, returned to normal culture conditions for increasing periods of time, and then assayed for activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP as molecular markers of injury (Fig. 9). Overexpression of CAIR-1 protects cells from heat shock injury. Neo control and dBAG cells had demonstrable evidence of heat shock injury as observed by a greater number of floating cells and by a lower net total cellular protein content in the cultures. This apoptotic injury was confirmed by the presence of cleaved caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP selectively in neo control and dBAG cells. All cells had induction of Hsp70 production by 6 h post-heat shock. In contrast, treatment with 4 μm staurosporine caused visible cell injury in all cells by 3 h into exposure. Expression of dBAG and FL CAIR-1 may sensitize the cell to injury, as cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 appears in those cells as early as 3 h of exposure. Akt is uniformly reduced"

Surveys along 1500 kilometers of the Pacific coast of North America documented marked variation in the frequency of predation by the snail Nucella canaliculata on the intertidal mussel Mytilus californianus . Laboratory rearing experiments suggest that regional differences in drilling behavior have a genetic basis, and mitochondrial sequence variation confirms that gene flow is low among these snail populations. Marine communities separated by hundreds of kilometers may have intrinsically different dynamics, with interactions shaped by restricted gene flow and spatially varying selection."

The cell killing activity correlates with a predominantly nuclear localization of Apoptin in tumor cells, whereas in normal cells, it is detected mainly in cytoplasmic structures.

Strikingly, further investigation showed that Apoptin contains two different domains that induce apoptosis independently, and for both domains, we found a strong correlation between localization and killing activity.

To determine whether nuclear localization is sufficient to enable Apoptin to kill normal, untransformed cells, we expressed full-length Apoptin fused to a heterologous nuclear localization signal in these cells.

Avian Pathol. 1995; 24: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), an avian pathogen that causes depletion of thymocytes and erythroblastoid cells in young chickens via the induction of apoptosis. This protein, one of three encoded by the viral genome of CAV, was shown to reproduce the cell killing activity in cultured cells (2Noteborn M.H.M. Todd D. Verschueren C.A. de Gauw H.W. Curran W.L. Veldkamp S. Douglas A.J. McNulty M.S. van der Eb A.J. Koch G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 346-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptin has been shown to induce apoptosis not only in transformed chicken cells but also in human tumor cell lines derived from a wide variety of tissue origins, including tumor cells with common lesions such as loss of p53 or overexpression of Bcl-2, with no known exceptions to date (3Zhuang S.M.

Jochemsen A.G. van der Eb A.J. Noteborn M.H.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 486-489PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, however, all normal untransformed cells tested were resistant (5Danen-van Oorschot A.A.A.M. Fischer D.F. Grimbergen J.M. Klein B. Zhuang S. Falkenburg J.H. Backendorf C.

Targets for Cancer Chemotherapy. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2002: 275-287Google Scholar). These characteristics make Apoptin a promising candidate for anti-tumor therapy, which is often thwarted by genetic lesions that render tumor cells resistant (7Lowe S.W. Bodis S. McClatchey A.

Dissecting the mechanism of Apoptin-induced apoptosis may be helpful not only for the use of Apoptin as an anti-tumor agent but may also provide information about the characteristics of the transformation-specific state of a cell.The mechanism of action for Apoptin is still unclear, but a clue may be found in its localization. In transformed and tumor cells, Apoptin is predominantly found in the nucleus, whereas in untransformed cells Apoptin is mainly localized to the cytoplasm (5Danen-van Oorschot A.A.A.M. Fischer D.F. Grimbergen J.M. Klein B. Zhuang S. Falkenburg J.H. Backendorf C. Quax P.H. van der Eb A.J. Noteborn M.H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5843-5847Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). A further indication that localization may be important was obtained from studies in which Apoptin was transiently co-expressed with the strongly transforming SV40 large T antigen in previously untransformed cells. Remarkably, this treatment redirected Apoptin to the nucleus of normal diploid cells and simultaneously sensitized these cells to Apoptin-induced apoptosis (10Noteborn M.H.M. Zhang Y.H. van der Eb A.J. Mutat Res. 1998; 400: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Apoptin was found to translocate to the nucleus and induce cell death in primary cells from certain cancer-prone individuals, but only after UV irradiation (11Zhang Y.H. Abrahams P.J. van der Eb A.J. Noteborn M.H.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3010-3015PubMed Google Scholar), further strengthening the correlation between localization and cell death.The amino acid sequence of Apoptin (see Fig. 1) contains two basic stretches constituting putative nuclear localization signals (NLS) and a stretch of alternating isoleucines and leucines that resembles a nuclear export signal (12Gerace L. Cell. 1995; 82: 341-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 13Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Deletion of the second of the two putative NLSs of Apoptin resulted in its diffuse localization all over the cytoplasm, with some protein still present in the nucleus (4Zhuang S.M. Shvarts A. van Ormondt H. Jochemsen A.G. van der Eb A.J. Noteborn M.H.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 486-489PubMed Google Scholar). This truncated form of Apoptin had a reduced cell killing activity, suggesting that nuclear localization may be required for apoptosis induction. However, such a truncation could influence other aspects of the protein, e.g. its folding, which could also alter its apoptosis activity. Therefore it was essential to test more mutants of Apoptin.In this study, we used mutagenesis to investigate further the relationship between nuclear localization of Apoptin and its cell killing activity. We determined the minimal region of Apoptin required for nuclear localization and showed that this region contains a bipartite-type NLS. Furthermore, we showed that distinct parts of Apoptin have independent, intrinsic cell killing activities and that for both domains, nuclear localization is strongly correlated with induction of cell death. However, redirecting Apoptin into the nucleus of normal, untransformed cells by fusing it to a heterologous NLS did not result in induction of apoptosis. Thus, nuclear localization appears to be important but not sufficient for the tumor-specific cell killing activity of Apoptin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—pCMV-VP3, encoding Apoptin, and pCMV-neo-Bam, the empty control plasmid, have been described before (2Noteborn M.H.M.

Noteborn, unpublished data. with NdeI/BamHI. This fragment was then digested with BsrI, resulting in fragments encoding Apoptin amino acids (aa) 1–69 and Apoptin aa 70–121. These fragments were ligated with the appropriate linkers in between the BsrGI and NotI sites C-terminal of GFP, generating phGFP-VP3, phGFP-VP3 (1–69), and phGFP-VP3 (70–121). phGFP-VP3 (111–121) was made by inserting a linker, which encodes a 4-aa spacer (Pro-Gly-Ala-Gly) and aa 111–121 of Apoptin, in between the BsrGI and NotI sites of phGFP-S65T. PCR fragments of Apoptin aa 80–121, 90–121, and 100–121 with overhanging BsrGI and NotI sites were cloned into phGFP-S65T to generate the plasmids phGFP-VP3 (80–121), phGFP-VP3 (90–121), and phGFP-VP3 (100–121). All of the plasmids were sequenced to confirm the correct reading frame of the fusion proteins.pCMV-NLS-VP3, encoding Apoptin fused to an SV40 large T-NLS (PPKKKRKV), was generated by ligating a linker, with ATG start codon and NLS, to the N terminus of an NdeI/BamHI fragment of Apoptin. The resulting fragment was cloned into the BamHI site of pCMV-neo-Bam. Similarly, the SV40 large T-NLS was fused to a NdeI/BsrI fragment of Apoptin encoding aa 1–69, generating pCMV-NLS-VP3 (1–69). phGFP-NLS was constructed by fusing the same NLS to the C terminus of GFP. All of the plasmids were confirmed by sequencing.The mutant Ala086 was constructed by replacing aa 86–90 of Apoptin with alanine residues. To this end, first, an Apoptin DNA was constructed containing additional unique restriction enzyme sites that allow for ease of cloning (sAPO). Then aa 86–90 of Apoptin were exchanged by 5 alanine residues using a linker substitution strategy. The Ala086 mutant and sAPO were sequenced and cloned in a modified expression plasmid vector pIRESneo (Clontech) under the control of the CMV promoter. pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) encodes enhanced GFP, which is optimized for human codon usage and contains chromophore mutations enhancing its fluorescence, under the control of the CMV promoter.pGal4-YY1 encoding YY1 fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (BD) was a kind gift from R. Johnstone and Y. Shi (15Shi Y. Seto E. Chang L.S. Shenk T. Cell. 1991; 67: 377-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). The reporter plasmid 5xGal4-TK-Luc was a kind gift from E. Kalkhoven and contains the luciferase gene under the regulation of the herpes simplex virus TK promoter joined to 5xGal4-binding elements (16Kalkhoven E. Teunissen H. Houweling A. Verrijzer C.P.

A DNA fragment encoding Apoptin was cloned into the multiple cloning site of pFA-CMV and confirmed by sequencing (Baseclear). The resulting plasmid pFA-VP3 encodes a Gal4 BD fusion to Apoptin.Expression and Purification of Proteins—The cloning, expression, and purification of recombinant MBP-Apoptin protein and the control protein MBP have been described (17Leliveld S.R.

In short, the construct pMalT-BVP3 encodes MBP-Apoptin, an N-terminal fusion of MBP to Apoptin, separated by a flexible linker encoding 10 asparagine residues. The construct pMalTB encodes MBP alone. Both proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by standard methods.Cell Culture, Transfection, and Microinjection Methods—The human osteosarcoma cell lines Saos-2 and U-2 OS and the human normal diploid skin fibroblast strain VH10 (up to passage 15) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin (Invitrogen).Saos-2 cells were grown on glass coverslips and transfected with 3 μg of DNA/well of a 6-well dish by the CaPO4 method as described (18Van der Eb A.J. Graham F.L. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 826-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). VH10 cells, which were grown in Permanox chamber slides (Invitrogen), were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 2 μg of DNA was transfected per chamber.For microinjections Saos-2 cells were cultured on glass-bottomed microinjection dishes (MatTek Corporation) or in 35-mm dishes containing glass Cellocate coverslips (Eppendorf). The cells were microinjected in the nucleus with DNA (50 ng/μl in phosphate-buffered saline) or in the cytoplasm with protein (3 mg/ml) using an Eppendorf microinjector with the injection pressure condition of 55 hPa. The cells were co-injected with Dextran-rhodamine (molecular mass, 70 kDa; Molecular Probes) to be able to later identify injected cells.Fluorescence Microscopy—Saos-2 cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, followed by 100% methanol for 5 min, and finally 80% acetone for 2 min. VH10 cells were fixed with 50% acetone, 50% methanol for 5 min. The slides were stored at –20 °C until further use. Immunocytochemical staining was performed as described (19Danen-van Oorschot A.A.A.M. van der Eb A.J. Noteborn M.H.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7072-7078Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). GFP and GFP fusion proteins were detected by their intrinsic fluorescent signal. Apoptin was detected either with the mouse monoclonal antibody CVI-CAV-111.3, which recognizes an epitope lying in the N terminus of Apoptin (5Danen-van Oorschot A.A.A.M. Fischer D.F. Grimbergen J.M. Klein B. Zhuang S. Falkenburg J.H. Backendorf C. Quax P.H. van der Eb A.J. Noteborn M.H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5843-5847Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), or with the rabbit polyclonal antibody Rα-VP3-C (19Danen-van Oorschot A.A.A.M. van der Eb A.J. Noteborn M.H.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7072-7078Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Desmin was detected with mouse monoclonal antibody 33 (Monosan). Secondary antibodies were either conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate or rhodamine (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The chromatin was stained with 1 μg of 2,4-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)/ml. The cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy for expression of the transfected protein. Nuclear morphology of those cells expressing the transfected protein was analyzed by examining the DAPI staining, which indicates the apoptotic state. Namely, during apoptosis, the whole cell has shrunken, the chromatin is condensed, the nucleus is often fragmented, and finally DAPI staining is lost because of fragmentation of the DNA. The statistics were performed using Student's t test. Images of representative cells were made with either a standard photocamera or a digital video camera connected to a fluorescence microscope AX70 (Olympus) and AnalySIS software.Transcription and Translation Inhibition—For the transcription/translation inhibition experiments, we used one RNA synthesis inhibitor, actinomycin D (Sigma), and two protein synthesis inhibitors, puromycin (Sigma) and emetine (Sigma). Numerous studies have shown that the inhibition of RNA and protein synthesis alone can directly trigger apoptosis in various cell types (20Waring P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14476-14480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Martin S.J. Lennon S.V. Bonham A.M. Cotter T.G. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 1859-1867PubMed Google Scholar, 22Collins R.J. Harmon B.V. Souvlis T. Pope J.H. Kerr J.F. Br. J. Cancer. 1991; 64: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore, the cytotoxicity of each inhibitor used in our study was first analyzed by 24-h incubation at a dose range of 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 μg/ml concentration. On the basis of cell killing curves following 24 h of incubation, the subtoxic dosage of each inhibitor was then determined at 10 μg/ml for all three inhibitors. To determine the effective transcription and translation inhibition by each inhibitor, Saos-2 cells were injected in the nucleus with the plasmid pEGFP-N1 (50 ng/μl) expressing enhanced GFP, which was used as an indicator. To assess the effect of the inhibitors on Apoptin, Saos-2 cells were incubated for 3 h with each inhibitor before and for a further 6 h after microinjection in the cytoplasm with the recombinant proteins MBP-Apoptin or MBP (3 mg/ml). Dextran-rhodamine (1 mg/ml) was co-injected as a marker. The cells were fixed 6 h after microinjection as described above. The expression of GFP, the presence of MBP-Apoptin or MBP, and nuclear morphology were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy.Luciferase Reporter Assay—U-2 OS cells were plated in 6-well plates and transfected with FuGENE 6 and with 1 μg/well 5xGal4-TK-Luc as the reporter plasmid, pcDNA3.1/mycHis/LacZ at 100 ng/well as an internal control, and Gal4 BD plasmids at 200 ng/well. Two days later, the cells were lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and the lysates were assayed for luciferase activity and for β-galactosidase activity according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega).RESULTSApoptin Contains a Functional, Bipartite-type NLS—Previous work has suggested that the nuclear localization of Apoptin may be correlated to its killing activity in tumor cells. In this study, we first set out to delineate the elements involved in nuclear localization of Apoptin. Apoptin contains two sequences that resemble NLSs based on the presence of positively charged aa, namely aa 82–88 (NLS1) and aa 111–121 (NLS2) (Fig. 1). Deletion of aa 111–121 has already been shown to result in decreased nuclear localization, suggesting that NLS2 is involved in nuclear targeting (4Zhuang S.M. Shvarts A. van Ormondt H. Jochemsen A.G. van der Eb A.J. Noteborn M.H.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 486-489PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether aa 111–121 of Apoptin can act independently as an NLS, this part was N-terminally fused to GFP, creating GFP-Apoptin(111–121) (Fig. 2A). An SV40 large T-derived NLS fused to the C terminus of GFP (GFP-NLS) was used as a positive control. The human osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2 was transfected with the GFP fusion constructs, and cells were fixed and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy for protein expression and localization in healthy cells. Wild type (wt) GFP was localized diffusely throughout the whole cell. In contrast, GFP-NLS was clearly located in the nucleus. However, GFP-Apoptin(111–121) was found dispersed throughout the whole cell, similar to what was seen with wt GFP, although GFP-Apoptin(111–121) did show a more punctate staining in the cytoplasm than did wt GFP (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that aa 111–121 (NLS2) of Apoptin are not sufficient to confer nuclear localization.To resolve the minimal requirements for nuclear localization of Apoptin in tumor cells, we made more N-terminal GFP fusions with fragments of Apoptin (Fig. 2A) and determined their localization. Fusion of aa 70–121 or 80–121, containing both putative NLSs, effectively redirected GFP to the nucleus, whereas fusion of aa 90–121 or 100–121, which lack NLS1, did not. These data suggest that both NLSs are needed for efficient nuclear targeting. Fusion of GFP with aa 1–69 of Apoptin, which lacks both NLSs, almost completely abrogated nuclear localization (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that the N-terminal half of Apoptin is able to change the localization of GFP from being diffused throughout the whole cell to being predominantly cytoplasmic, which suggests that this part of Apoptin possesses either nuclear export or cytoplasmic retention activity. To test further the requirement for both NLSs for nuclear localization, we mutated aa 86–90 (KKRSC) to alanines, creating the mutant Ala086. Ala086 exhibited a partial but significant impairment of nuclear localization, together with the formation of aggregates in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2D). These data indicate that the NLSs of Apoptin are indeed interdependent, consistent with them functioning as a bipartite-type NLS characterized by two basic domains separated by a spacer (23Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar).Nuclear Localization Strongly Correlates with Apoptotic Activity—We observed that early after transfection (2–3 days) Apoptin is mainly localized in the nucleus of Saos-2 cells but hardly induces apoptosis, which is consistent with previous results (4Zhuang S.M. Shvarts A. van Ormondt H. Jochemsen A.G. van der Eb A.J. Noteborn M.H.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 486-489PubMed Google Scholar, 24Danen-van Oorschot A.A.A.M. Zhang Y. Erkeland S.J. Fischer D.F. van der Eb A.J. Noteborn M.H.M. Leukemia. 1999; 13: S75-S77Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This implies that Apoptin enters the nucleus before the onset of cell death. Here, we examined further the relationship between the localization of Apoptin and its apoptotic activity. To this end, the human osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2 was transfected with the GFP fusion constructs described above, along with GFP fused to wt Apoptin as a positive control. Five days post-transfection, the cells were fixed and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy for expression of the proteins and for apoptosis induction as determined by nuclear morphology. At this time point, the majority of cells expressing Apoptin will have become apoptotic (4Zhuang S.M. Shvarts A. van Ormondt H. Jochemsen A.G. van der Eb A.J. Noteborn M.H.M.

Leukemia. 1999; 13: S75-S77Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).We first examined whether fusion to GFP had any effect on the apoptotic activity of Apoptin and found that the full-length Apoptin protein fused to GFP-induced apoptosis to the same extent as did wt Apoptin in Saos-2 cells (data not shown). GFP by itself was mainly found in a diffuse pattern throughout the cell and only resulted in a background level of apoptosis induction (Fig. 3A) similar to that caused by the negative control protein, Desmin, which does not induce apoptosis (5Danen-van Oorschot A.A.A.M.

In contrast, GFP-Apoptin(70–121) displayed a more robust cell killing activity (Fig. 3A). However, apoptosis induction was markedly reduced as compared with GFP-Apoptin. These results show that the C-terminal half of Apoptin and, to a lesser extent, the N-terminal half both have intrinsic apoptotic activity, albeit less than full-length Apoptin.Fig. 3Apoptotic activity in correlation with the localization of several Apoptin mutants. A and B, Saos-2 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated GFP fusions or GFP as a control, fixed 5 days later, and analyzed for protein expression and apoptosis induction by fluorescence microscopy.

Whereas expression of GFP-Apoptin(100–121) did not result in significant cell death, GFP-Apoptin(90–121) caused 12% of the cells to undergo apoptosis, which is moderate but significantly higher (p < 0.01) than the effect of wt GFP (Fig. 3A). In contrast, GFP-Apoptin(80–121) caused a robust level of apoptosis (30%), although less than that induced by GFP-Apoptin (Fig. 3A). Thus, aa 80–121 are sufficient to induce the cell death conferred by the C-terminal apoptosis domain"
https://openalex.org/W2020105636,"During protein synthesis, transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are translocated from the aminoacyl to peptidyl to exit sites of the ribosome, coupled to the movement of messenger RNA (mRNA), in a reaction catalyzed by elongation factor G (EF-G) and guanosine triphosphate (GTP). Here, we show that the peptidyl transferase inhibitor sparsomycin triggers accurate translocation in vitro in the absence of EF-G and GTP. Our results provide evidence that translocation is a function inherent to the ribosome and that the energy to drive this process is stored in the tRNA-mRNA-ribosome complex after peptide-bond formation. These findings directly implicate the peptidyl transferase center of the 50S subunit in the mechanism of translocation, a process involving large-scale movement of tRNA and mRNA in the 30S subunit, some 70 angstroms away."

The function of NCX1 depends on subcellular (“local”) factors, the phosphorylation state of NCX1, and the subcellular location of NCX1 within the cell. Here we investigate the molecular organization of NCX1 within the cardiac myocyte. We show that NCX1 is dynamically phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation in vitro. We also provide evidence that the regulation of this phosphorylation is attributed to the existence of an NCX1 macromolecular complex. Specifically, we show that the macromolecular complex includes both the catalytic and regulatory subunits of PKA. However, only the RI regulatory subunit is found in this macromolecular complex, not RII. Other critical regulatory enzymes are also associated with NCX1, including protein kinase C (PKC) and two serine/threonine protein phosphatases, PP1 and PP2A. Importantly, the protein kinase A-anchoring protein, mAKAP, is found and its presence in the macromolecular complex suggests that these regulatory enzymes are coordinately positioned to regulate NCX1 as has been found in diverse cells for a number of channel proteins. Dual immunocytochemical staining showed the colocalization of NCX1 protein with mAKAP and PKA-RI proteins in cardiomyocytes.

Early studies suggested that ATP-dependent regulation of NCX1 occurred in squid axons (24DiPolo R. Beauge L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1382-C1391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25DiPolo R.

Biochem. 1983; 132: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), but these studies did not distinguish between direct ATP binding and ATP-dependent phosphorylation. Several studies were designed to resolve this problem. Hilgemann and colleagues (11Hilgemann D.W. Collins A. Matsuoka S. J. Gen.

The work used two preparations, NCX1-expressing Xenopus oocytes (27Hilgemann D.W. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. Nature. 1991; 352: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) or cardiac myocytes expressing native NCX1 (11Hilgemann D.W. Collins A. Matsuoka S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 933-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 12Hilgemann D.W. Matsuoka S. Nagel G.A. Collins A. J. Gen.

These investigations found no functional change in cardiac NCX1 activity following application of PKA or protein kinase C (PKC) catalytic subunits to the intracellular side of the giant patch. Condrescu et al. (19Condrescu M. Gardner J.P. Chernaya G. Aceto J.F. Kroupis C. Reeves J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9137-9146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) came to similar conclusions by examining the phosphorylation state of NCX1 in a heterologous expression system (19Condrescu M. Gardner J.P. Chernaya G. Aceto J.F. Kroupis C. Reeves J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9137-9146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Less direct investigations, however, suggested that PKA affected NCX1 function in heart (29Han X. Ferrier G.R. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 30Perchenet L. Hinde A.K. Patel K.C. Hancox J.C. Levi A.J. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2000; 439: 822-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The indirect nature of these studies in support of phosphorylation did not exclude the possibility that the measured changes were due to PKA phosphorylation of other proteins. The first unambiguous demonstration that phosphorylation affected NCX1 was provided by Iwamoto et al. (31Iwamoto T. Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8996-9001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). They showed that NCX1 from rat aorta smooth muscle cells is phosphorylated by PKC and is activated in response to growth factors (32Shigekawa M. Iwamoto T. Wakabayashi S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 779: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Further studies demonstrated that cardiac NCX1 is regulated by PKC phosphorylation (20Iwamoto T. Pan Y. Wakabayashi S. Imagawa T. Yamanaka H.I. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13609-13615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Additionally, Iwamoto et al. (20Iwamoto T. Pan Y. Wakabayashi S. Imagawa T. Yamanaka H.I. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13609-13615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) provided evidence that the intracellular loop of NCX1 was phosphorylated by PKC and PKA. We were the first to show that PKA-dependent phosphorylation of NCX1 increased NCX1 activity both in Xenopus oocytes expressing cardiac NCX1 and in adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (33Ruknudin A. He S. Lederer W.J. Schulze D.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 599-610Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 34Ruknudin A. Schulze D.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 976: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To determine how such divergent conclusions could arise, we undertook an investigation of the molecular organization of NCX1 in heart. Regulation of NCX1 could arise through cytosolic enzymes bathing NCX1 or through local clustering of the regulatory proteins. The variable loss of cytosolic regulatory proteins during experiments on NCX1 phosphorylation could, in principle, account for the divergent findings. Alternatively, if NCX1 was part of a macromolecular complex that included other regulatory proteins, differences in experimental results may reflect the different levels of expression and activity of associated proteins under different experimental conditions. Recently, local signaling complexes have been shown to regulate ion channels similar the l-type Ca+ channel (35Davare M.A. Avdonin V. Hall D.D. Peden E.M. Burette A. Weinberg R.J. Horne M.C. Hoshi T. Hell J.W. Science. 2001; 293: 98-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) and specific K+ channels (36Marx S.O. Kurokawa J. Reiken S. Motoike H. D'Armiento J. Marks A.R. Kass R.S. Science. 2002; 295: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar) and cardiac ryanodine receptors (RyR2) (37Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Jayaraman T. Burkhoff D. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. Cell. 2000; 101: 365-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). These complexes are composed of kinases, phosphatases, and kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) and regulate activation state, substrate specificity, and subcellular localization. Recently, it was shown that the RyR2 could be more rapidly de-phosphorylated by the phosphatases of the macromolecular cluster than the kinases phosphorylated RyR2 (38Reiken S.R. Gaburjakova M. Guatimosim S. Gomez A.M. D'Armiento J. Burkhoff D. Wang J. Vassort G. Lederer W.J. Marks A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 444-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This recent observation and the large number of Ca2+-regulatory proteins associated with macromolecular complexes that regulate function suggested that this hypothesis is particularly appealing for NCX1. The experiments that we present below examine the macromolecular complex hypothesis for NCX1. Recently, we have shown that phosphorylation of NCX1 is induced by β-adrenergic stimulation in pig heart resulting increased NCX1 exchanger current (INCX). More importantly, we found that NCX1 is hyperphosphorylated in pig model of heart failure but β-adrenergic response is attenuated in heart failure (39Wei S.K. Ruknudin A. Hanlon S.U. McCurley J.M. Schulze D.H. Haigney M.C. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These findings underscore the significance of NCX1 phosphorylation in pathological heart, and we have investigated the regulation of NCX1 phosphorylation in this paper. Preliminary findings of this work were presented in abstract form previously (40Mughal M. Schulze D. Lederer J. Ruknudin A. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 151aGoogle Scholar). F344 strain rats (NIA, National Institutes of Health) were sacrificed by injecting with pentobarbital, and the hearts were removed immediately. After rinsing in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline, the ventricles were frozen in liquid nitrogen. The ventricles were pulverized in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle and then homogenized in glass homogenizer (Eberbach, Ann Arbor, MI) for 20 min over ice. During homogenization, the extraction buffer composed of 50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 25 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm ATP, 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.4), and protease inhibitors (50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm iodoacetamide, 1 μm pepstatin, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, 1000 units/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm 1,10-phenonthroline) was added gradually. Undissolved cell fragments were removed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The turbid supernatant was homogenized again over ice and centrifuged at 5000 rpm and at 4 °C (Eppendorf centrifuge 5415C). The supernatant was concentrated 3-fold using Micron-50 (Millipore) at 4 °C, and the concentrate was used either for electrophoresis as cardiac lysate or for immunoprecipitation for NCX1 macromolecular complex. The cardiac lysate was incubated with NCX polyclonal antibody π11–13 (Swant, Bellinzona, Switzerland) overnight, and the antigen-antibody complex was precipitated by mixing with protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). To identify the full-length mAKAP, immunoprecipitation was done using monoclonal NCX1 antibody (R3F1, Swant). The complex was washed in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 6 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.02% SDS. Phosphorylation was performed by incubation of the pellet with 1 μg of the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKA-CS reconstituted in 5 mm dithiothreitol) and 10 μCi of [32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) in phosphorylation buffer (25 mm Hepes, 5 mm MgCl2,5mm EGTA, and 0.2% Triton X-100 (pH 7.4)) for 10 min at 37 °C. In experiments with inhibitor, PKA inhibitor (Sigma) was included along with PKA catalytic subunit. The reaction was stopped by washing with 1 ml of RIA buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 50 mm KF, 75 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 0.01% NaN3, and 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4)) (41Ivanina T. Perets T. Thornhill W.B. Levin G. Dascal N. Lotan I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8786-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Samples were heated to 75 °C for 3 min in gel loading buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol and analyzed using 8% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins from the gel were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR at –80 °C. After the immunoprecipitation with NCX1 antibodies and protein A-Sepharose beads, the protein sample was treated as described above. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and the primary antibodies were added. The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting: rabbit polyclonal to NCX1 (π11–13, Swant); mouse monoclonals to PKA catalytic subunit (clone 5B), to PKA RI subunit (Clone 18), to PKC (Clone MC5), and to PP1 (clone 24) (BD Biosciences); rabbit polyclonal to mAKAP (Upstate Biotechnology); and mouse monoclonal to PP2A (Clone 6F9) (CRP Inc.). HRP-conjugated appropriate secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) were added, and the proteins in the nitrocellulose membranes were identified. The proteins were visualized using ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences), and the images were obtained using Kodak Biomax-MR film. Enzymatically isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes (33Ruknudin A. He S. Lederer W.J. Schulze D.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 599-610Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar) were fixed in cold ethanol, permeabilized, and incubated with primary antibodies to NCX1 (mouse, Swant) and mAKAP (rabbit, Upstate Biotechnology). Another set of cardiomyocytes was incubated with antibodies to RI (Pan-antibody mouse, Clone 18, BD Biosciences) and NCX1 (rabbit, Swant) followed by appropriate secondary antisera (Alexa488 and Alexa633, Molecular Probes, Sunnyvale, CA) and imaged by confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510). Images at each wavelength (488 and 633 nm) were collected separately to ensure that there was no fluorescent channel bleed-through. The fluorescence intensities in a chosen area of the cell were analyzed using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corporation, Downingtown, PA). Increased NCX1 activity in rat ventricular cardiomyocytes following PKA activation (30Perchenet L. Hinde A.K. Patel K.C. Hancox J.C. Levi A.J. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2000; 439: 822-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 33Ruknudin A. He S. Lederer W.J. Schulze D.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 599-610Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar) could be attributed to the direct effect on NCX1 protein or could be due to PKA activation of another target protein. To investigate these alternatives, we examined the phosphorylation state of NCX1. Total cardiac protein was prepared, and NCX1 protein was immunoprecipitated with NCX1 antibody. A Western blot permitted identification of NCX1 protein as three bands at 120, 140, and 160 kDa (Fig. 1, left panel). These bands are characteristically observed for NCX1 protein (42Santacruz-Toloza L. Ottolia M. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 182-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). When the immunoprecipitated cardiac NCX1 was phosphorylated in vitro using catalytic subunit of PKA and [32P]ATP, the bands at 120 and 160 kDa were clearly phosphorylated (Fig. 1, middle panel). Inclusion of an inhibitor of PKA (PKI, the PKA inhibitory peptide) during the phosphorylation reaction prevented the labeling of these proteins, indicating the specificity of PKA on rat cardiac NCX1 (Fig. 1, right panel). This experiment demonstrates that cardiac NCX1 is phosphorylated by PKA in support of the findings of Iwamoto et al. (20Iwamoto T. Pan Y. Wakabayashi S. Imagawa T. Yamanaka H.I. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13609-13615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To examine the possibility that NCX1 associates with relevant kinases, NCX1 was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotting was performed. The PKA holoenzyme is a kinase composed of two identical catalytic subunits and two identical regulatory subunits (43Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Madhusudan Cheng X. Ten Eyck L. Narayana N. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We show that the components of the PKA holoenzyme, both the catalytic and regulatory subunit RI, are recognized in the NCX1 immunoprecipitate by the antibodies specific for those proteins (Fig. 2AI). The other PKA regulatory subunit, RII, was not detected in the macromolecular complex. This indicates that only RI is associated with NCX1. All of the PKA components (including RII) were found in the cardiac lysate (Fig. 2, AII). The presence of both catalytic and regulatory subunits in the cardiac lysate shows that PKA components are also found in the soluble components of the cell as has been reported previously (44Corbin J.D. Sugden P.H. Lincoln T.M. Keely S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3854-3861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using the same immunoprecipitation strategy, we investigated whether or not PKC is associated with NCX1. As shown in Fig. 2B, a sharp single band is present on the immunoblot using a pan-PKC antibody. The absence of measured phosphorylation of NCX1 following PKA activation in some studies could be compatible with our results if there was a difference in the rate of dephosphorylation in the various studies. Conditions that may lead to such differences could occur if phosphatases colocalized with NCX1 as has been shown for RyR2 (38Reiken S.R. Gaburjakova M. Guatimosim S. Gomez A.M. D'Armiento J. Burkhoff D. Wang J. Vassort G. Lederer W.J. Marks A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 444-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 examines this by immunoblot analysis with antibodies to PP1 and PP2A as shown in Fig. 3, A and B, respectively. We found that the serine/threonine phosphatases PP1 and PP2A were precipitated along with the NCX1. These phosphatases were also readily detected in the cardiac lysate. Targeting of kinases and phosphatases to specific proteins has been described extensively by Scott and co-workers (45Smith F.D. Scott J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 12: R32-R40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 46Bauman A.L. Scott J.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E203-E206Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These studies have identified a family of “Akinase anchoring proteins” or AKAPs that serves as scaffolding proteins for this function. To explore the possibility that an AKAP may be associated with NCX1, we probed immunoblots with antibodies against six of the major AKAPs. Fig. 4A and B, shows that mAKAP coprecipitates with NCX1 while the other AKAPs tested (79, 95, 121, 149, and 220) did not. The size of mAKAP is 300 kDa and is identified by the specificity of the mAKAP antibody. 2J. Scott, personal communication. The cardiac lysate probed with the same antibody contained a 300-kDa band as well as the smaller bands (Fig. 4A). Others have also detected the proteolytic fragments of the 300-kDa mAKAP (47Kapiloff M.S. Schillace R.V. Westphal A.M. Scott J.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2725-2736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the NCX1 and associated proteins of the macromolecular complex in situ, we used immunocytochemical techniques to localize these proteins in rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. NCX1 was identified in the sarcolemmal membrane and in the Z-lines of cardiomyocytes (Fig. 5) as already reported (48Kieval R.S. Bloch R.J. Lindenmayer G.E. Ambesi A. Lederer W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C545-C550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Frank J.S. Mottino G. Reid D. Molday R.S. Philipson K.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mAKAP is also localized in the Z-lines and the dual staining of NCX1 and mAKAP confirmed that both of these proteins are present in the same location in rat cardiomyocytes (Fig. 5A, overlay). The regulatory subunit of PKA, RI has been identified in the Z-lines and also in other regions of the cell (Fig. 5C). The overlay of the RI and NCX1 clearly shows that both of these proteins are colocalized in cardiomyocytes (Fig. 5C). Analysis of the fluorescence intensities in selected regions of the cell indicates that there is clear correspondence between NCX1 and mAKAP (Fig. 5B) and that there is even better support for the matching of PKA-RI and NCX1 (Fig. 5D). The mAKAP and PKA-RI are also expressed in places that do not contain NCX1 and that are also shown in immunofluorescence images. We have presented data demonstrating that the NCX1 protein in cardiac cells is part of a macromolecular complex (Fig. 6). The complex consists of two types of protein kinases (PKA and PKC), two types of phosphatases (PP1 and PP2A), and an anchoring protein (mAKAP). In addition, there is strong evidence that NCX1 also binds to the widely distributed adapter protein, ankyrin (50Li Z.P. Burke E.P. Frank J.S. Bennett V. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11489-11491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Chen F. Mottino G. Shin V.Y. Frank J.S. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2621-2629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The activity of NCX1 has been shown to be regulated by its interaction with a number of ions and molecules (Table I). How this regulation may be organized and controlled by the macromolecular complex is presented below.Table IInteractions of NCX1 macromolecular complexMajor itemInteractionCommentsReferencesNCX1AnkyrinSubcellular localization50Li Z.P.

https://openalex.org/W2061204529,"Werner syndrome (WS) is a premature aging disorder that predisposes affected individuals to cancer development. The affected gene, WRN, encodes an RecQ homologue whose precise biological function remains elusive. Altered DNA recombination is a hallmark of WS cells suggesting that WRN plays an important role in these pathways. Here we report a novel physical and functional interaction between WRN and the homologous recombination mediator protein RAD52. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analyses show that WRN and RAD52 form a complex in vivo that co-localizes in foci associated with arrested replication forks. Biochemical studies demonstrate that RAD52 both inhibits and enhances WRN helicase activity in a DNA structure-dependent manner, whereas WRN increases the efficiency of RAD52-mediated strand annealing between non-duplex DNA and homologous sequences contained within a double-stranded plasmid. These results suggest that coordinated WRN and RAD52 activities are involved in replication fork rescue after DNA damage.

Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analyses show that WRN and RAD52 form a complex in vivo that co-localizes in foci associated with arrested replication forks. Biochemical studies demonstrate that RAD52 both inhibits and enhances WRN helicase activity in a DNA structure-dependent manner, whereas WRN increases the efficiency of RAD52-mediated strand annealing between non-duplex DNA and homologous sequences contained within a double-stranded plasmid. These results suggest that coordinated WRN and RAD52 activities are involved in replication fork rescue after DNA damage.

Mech. Ageing Dev. 1997; 98: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 2Martin G.M. Oshima J. Gray M.D. Poot M. J. Am. Geriatr. Soc. 1999; 47: 1136-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The affected gene, WRN, encodes a 1432-amino acid nuclear protein belonging to the ubiquitous RecQ family of DNA helicases, which includes RecQ (Escherichia coli), Sgs1p (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), Rqh1p (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), and four additional human proteins, RecQL1, RecQL3 (BLM), RecQL4, and RecQL5 (3Brosh Jr., R.M. Bohr V.A. Exp. Gerontol. 2002; 37: 491-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). WRN is distinct within this family in that it possesses both helicase and exonuclease activities (4Huang S. Li B. Gray M. Oshima J. Mian I.S. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 5Shen J.-C. Gray M. Oshima J. Loeb L.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2879-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The biological function of WRN remains unclear; however, such catalytic properties could be important for a variety of DNA metabolic pathways, including specific steps involved in repair, replication, and recombination (3Brosh Jr., R.M. Bohr V.A. Exp. Gerontol. 2002; 37: 491-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Cells from Werner syndrome (WS) patients exhibit elevated genome instability manifested as telomere defects, and chromosomal translocations and large deletions (6Salk D. Hum. Genet. 1982; 62: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 7Fukuchi K. Martin G.M. Monnat R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2002; 22: 6971-6978Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The latter rearrangements are thought to reflect aberrant DNA recombination, a process responsible for the repair of single strand gaps and double strand breaks (DSBs). Such DNA damage can arise directly from exposure to ionizing radiation or some chemicals and indirectly as a consequence of replication fork blockage (see Ref. 9Lundin C. Erixon K. Arnaudeau C. Schultz N. Jenssen D. Meuth M. Helleday T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 5869-5878Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar and references therein). Two major recombination pathways have been identified in eukaryotes that are distinct with respect to mechanism and DNA homology requirements. The non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway joins two extremities of a DSB via a process that is largely independent of terminal DNA sequence homology. Therefore, NHEJ can be error-prone, producing deletions, insertions, and translocations (10Thompson L.H. Schild D. Mutat. Res. 2002; 509: 49-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 11Van den Bosch M. Lohman P.H. Pastink A. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 873-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Homologous recombination (HR) corrects strand breaks using homologous sequences primarily from the sister chromatid and, to a lesser extent, from the chromosome homologue (12Johnson R.D. Jasin M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3398-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 13Liang F. Han M. Romanienko P.J. Jasin M. Proc. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5172-5177Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar); therefore, it is a high fidelity repair mechanism. HR is poorly defined in eukaryotes, and the biological roles of specific proteins are unclear. However, several lines of evidence indicate that the principle steps of HR are likely conserved from yeast to humans. In S. cerevisiae, HR is carried out by proteins encoded by the RAD52 epistasis group, which includes the key Rad51p recombinase and the Rad52p recombination mediator/single strand annealing protein (10Thompson L.H. Schild D. Mutat. Res. 2002; 509: 49-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 11Van den Bosch M. Lohman P.H. Pastink A. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 873-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 14Iyer L.M. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. BMC Genomics. 2002; 3: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Like the yeast protein, human RAD52 binds as heptameric rings to single strand regions and DSBs (15Shinohara A. Shinohara M. Ohta T. Matsuda S. Ogawa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 16Stasiak A.Z. Larquet E. Stasiak A. Muller S. Engel A. Van Dyck E. West S.C. Egelman E.H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 337-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), an action that may facilitate RAD51 loading at the recombination site (17Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31663-31672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Once bound to the DNA, RAD51 forms a nucleoprotein filament that catalyzes strand exchange between a 3′ terminus and a donor duplex. The exchange reaction is stimulated by RAD52 and produces a joint molecule or Holliday junction. RAD52 also promotes the homologous strand pairing and exchange reaction independently of RAD51 (14Iyer L.M. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. BMC Genomics. 2002; 3: 8Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Despite strong similarities between amino acid sequence and biochemical activities pointing to a conservation of biological function, the cellular roles of the yeast and human RAD51 and RAD52 homologous proteins are to some extent divergent. Rad52p-defective yeast cells exhibit a severe and general recombination defect, whereas the lack of vertebrate RAD52 only partially reduces the frequency of HR events (see Ref. 18Rijkers T. van den Ouweland J. Morolli B. Rolink A.G. Baarends W.M. van Sloun P.P.H. Lohman P.H.M. Pastink A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6423-6429Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar and references therein), leading to speculation about the presence of a backup or redundant activity. Although the absence of Rad51p is hardly noticeable in yeast, a RAD51 deficiency in vertebrates produces an embryonic lethal phenotype (19Lim D.S. Hasty P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7133-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar, 20Tsuzuki T. Fujii Y. Sakumi K. Tomnaga Y. Nakao K. Sekiguchi M. Matsushiro A. Yoshimura Y. Morita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Nature. 1997; 386: 804-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). The chromosomal aberrations exhibited by WS cells resemble those observed in vertebrate cells defective for HR proteins (22Prince P.R. Emond M.J. Monnat Jr., R.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 23Pierce A.J. Stark J.M. Araujo F. Moynahan M.E. Berwick M. Jasin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: S52-S59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 24Van Gent D.C. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Kanaar R. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Indeed, recent evidence has correlated WRN-deficiency with specific HR defects. WS cell lines have been shown to be proficient at initiating mitotic recombination but defective at resolving recombination intermediates (22Prince P.R. Emond M.J. Monnat Jr., R.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A potential substrate for WRN was revealed when expression of RusA, a bacterial protein cleaving almost exclusively four-way junctions in vitro, rescued cell survival and restored the ability to generate viable recombinants following exposure of WS to DNA-damaging agents (8Saintigny Y. Makienko K. Swanson C. Emond M.J. Monnat Jr., R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6971-6978Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). These results point to the direct participation of WRN in HR. The yeast RecQ homologue, Sgs1p, has also been associated with HR, pointing to an evolutionary conservation of function. Similar to WS cells, Sgs1p-deficient strains exhibit erroneous homologous recombination (25Gangloff S. Soustelle C. Fabre F. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 192-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Sgs1p demonstrates epistasis with Rad51p and Rad52p and plays an important role in modulating Rad52p-dependent spontaneous and induced recombination events (26Onoda F. Seki M. Miyajima A. Enomoto T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2001; 264: 702-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Odagiri N. Seki M. Onoda F. Yoshimura A. Wantanabe S. Enomoto T. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Sgs1p has been shown to physically associate with Rad51p (28Wu L. Davies S.L. Levitt N.C. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19375-19381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Finally, recent work has shown that Sgs1p, together with the Mus81/MMS4 endonuclease and the Srs2 helicase, function on alternate pathways, in coordination with recombination protein activities, to prevent the formation of toxic recombination intermediates at stalled replication forks (29Fabre F. Chan A. Heyer W.-D. Gangloff S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16887-16892Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In the present study, we wanted to further investigate the reported role of WRN in HR by examining the possibility of there being a direct association between WRN and the human counterparts of the key yeast HR proteins, RAD51 and RAD52. We report that WRN interacts directly with RAD52 both in vitro and in vivo. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analyses provide additional support for this interaction by showing that fluorescently tagged RAD52 and WRN proteins are in a complex resembling blocked replication forks in response to DNA damage in vivo. Biochemical analyses demonstrate that RAD52 modulates WRN helicase activity in a manner that appears to depend on the substrate configuration. WRN, in turn, stimulates RAD52-mediated homologous strand annealing between complementary sequences in a double-stranded plasmid DNA and single-stranded oligonucleotide. These results shed further light on the poorly understood processes of replication fork recovery in human cells by suggesting that WRN functions together with RAD52 in response to replication forks attenuated by DNA damage. Materials, Bacterial Strains, and Cell Lines—All PCR reactions were performed using Pfu Turbo (Stratagene) and PCR primers and oligonucleotides for DNA substrates were purchased from Invitrogen. The BL21 CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL strain (Stratagene) was used for overexpression of recombinant RAD52 from vector pFB581. Spodoptera frugiperda cells (SF9 strain) used for full-length WRN protein expression were purchased from Invitrogen and cultured according to the manufacturer's guidelines. The human cervical cancer (HeLa-S3) and liver carcinoma (SK-HEP-1) cell lines were obtained from ATCC. Mitomycin C (MMC) was purchased from Sigma. Cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method (Profection, Promega). Plasmids—The pBlueBac-WRN baculovirus used for overexpression of the full-length WRN protein in Sf9 cells has been previously described (30Orren D.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Nehlin J.O. Machwe A. Gray M.D. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3557-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). DNA fragments encoding the WRN C terminus (WRN-C; amino acids 982–1432) and exonuclease truncated peptide (WRN-EXO) were PCR-amplified from the pBlueBac-WRN template and cloned into the EcoRI-BamHI and BglII sites, respectively, using standard cloning techniques (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The RAD52 and RAD51 DNA sequences were PCR-amplified for cloning into the BamHI site of the yeast two-hybrid vectors pGAD424 and pGBT9 (MATCHMAKER two-hybrid system, Clontech Laboratories) from pFB581 and pFB530 (32Benson F.E. Baumann P. West S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 33Benson F.E. Stasiak A. West S.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5764-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) (generous gifts from F. Benson, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, South Mimms, UK). All clones were verified to be in-frame by sequencing. Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—The yeast strain used in this study, PJ69-4A, has been described previously (34James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was a kind gift from O. Gabrielsen (University of Oslo, Norway). The strain carries the HIS3 and ADE2 reporter genes, enabling growth assays on selective media with different stringencies. Transformation with the respective combinations of GAL4 activation (AD: pGAD424 and LEU2+) and DNA binding domain constructs (BD: pGBT9 and TRP+) was performed using an Sc EasyComp yeast transformation kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transformants were plated onto yeast nitrogen base ((Difco) 2% glucose, 2% gelose) medium lacking Leu/Trp (YNB-Leu/Trp, Clontech) and incubated for 2 days at 30 °C. Single transformants were re-suspended in sterile water at equal densities, spotted onto YNB-Leu/Trp (control), YNB-His/Leu/Trp/+3-amino-1,2,4,-triazole (1.5 mm) (Sigma Chemical Co.) (weaker interactions), and YNB-Ade/His/Leu/Trp (stronger interactions) and scored for differential growth after 3–5 days of incubation at 30 °C. Antibodies—Polyclonal rabbit anti-RAD52 (H-300) and goat anti-RAD52 (C-17) antibodies, rabbit IgG, and pre-immune serum were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. The anti-WRN (ab200) antibody was obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Anti-rabbit and anti-goat alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (H+L) were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Protein Expression and Purification—Purification of the full-length, hexahistidine-tagged WRN protein from Sf9 cultures has been described previously (30Orren D.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Nehlin J.O. Machwe A. Gray M.D. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3557-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL cells transformed with the hexahistidine-tagged RAD52 expression construct pFB581 were grown in LB (0.1 mg/ml ampicillin), harvested following a 2-h induction with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Fermentas Inc.) as recommended (Qiagen) and sonicated in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 m NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The resulting lysate was loaded directly onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) and RAD52 was eluted with lysis buffer containing 0.3 m imidazole. Overexpression and purification of the N-terminally truncated version ΔN1–400 of the S. cerevisiae RecQ homologue Sgs1 from vector pRB222 (a generous gift from J.C. Wang) was performed as described previously (35Bennett R.J. Sharp J.A. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9644-9650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). All protein preparations were tested for purity and activity prior to use. Far Western Analysis—Typically, 0.5–1 μg of active, recombinant protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE (8%) and transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). All steps were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. Filters were incubated overnight in a buffer comprised of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5% BSA, 0.25% gelatin, 0.2% Triton X-100, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 150 mm NaCl. Fresh buffer was added with or without 1 μg of the respective partner protein, and the membrane was incubated for a further 4–6 h, at which time it was washed briefly at room temperature with buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.05% Tween, and 150 mm NaCl. Conventional Western blot analysis was performed to detect the presence of WRN or RAD52 using WRN- and RAD52-specific antibodies. Immunoprecipitation—All steps were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. Potential interactions between recombinant, full-length WRN and RAD52 were investigated by incubating 1 μg of each protein together for 1 h in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm DTT), followed by a 1-h incubation with either anti-WRN antibody, anti-RAD52 antibody (H-300), or rabbit IgG, together with Protein G-Sepharose Fast Flow 4 beads (Amersham Biosciences). Immunocomplexes were pelleted, washed four to five times with immunoprecipitation buffer, re-suspended in protein loading buffer (2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, and 0.01% bromphenol blue), and subjected to conventional Western blotting analysis. The RAD52 blots for were probed with the C-17 antibody to minimize cross-reactivity between the rabbit IgG heavy chain and the goat IgG heavy chain, as the rabbit heavy chain runs close to the 50-kDa protein marker rendering separation from RAD52 difficult. Nuclear extracts for co-immunoprecipitation experiments of endogenous proteins were prepared in the following manner from asynchronously growing HeLaS3 cultures. All steps were performed on ice unless otherwise indicated. Approximately 80% confluent cultures (1 × 107 cells) were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were collected with a cell scraper and re-suspended in 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were pelleted, re-suspended in two volumes of lysis buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF) and incubated for 15 min on ice. Whole cell extracts were centrifuged in buffer A suspension for 15 min at 2,500 × g, 4 °C, and the resulting pellets were re-suspended in 2 volumes of buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.42 mm NaCl2, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF). A final centrifugation step for 30 min at 14,000 × g, 4 °C, yielded the nuclear extract in the supernatant. Total protein in the final nuclear extract was determined by conventional Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) and was typically 150–300 μg. Immunoprecipitation of protein complexes from HeLaS3 nuclear extracts was carried out by diluting samples to 200 μl with dilution buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF. Following preclearing with protein G-Sepharose, extracts were incubated 2 h at 4 °C with 0.5 μg each of anti-RAD52 or anti-WRN antibodies or 0.5 μg of pre-immune rabbit serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). Immunocomplexes were captured by incubating 1/10 of the total volume of protein G-Sepharose with the extracts for 2 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing of the protein G-Sepharose with dilution buffer, the pellets were re-suspended in protein loading buffer, separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, and subjected to conventional Western blotting analysis. The H-300 antibody was used to evaluate RAD52 immunoprecipitation and co-precipitation in these experiments. Cloning of Fusion Proteins—EYFP-WRN was made from EGFPC3-WRN (35Bennett R.J. Sharp J.A. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9644-9650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) by cloning the AgeI-SalI fragment from the pEYFP-C1 vector (Clontech) into the AgeI-XhoI sites of EGFPC3-WRN by standard techniques (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). RAD52 was PCR-amplified from pFB581 and ligated into the BamHI restriction site of pECFP-C1 vector (Clontech). The pGFPCNAL2 construct (37Leonhardt H. Rahn H.-P. Weinzierl P. Sporbert A. Cremer T. Zink D. Cardoso C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) (a generous gift from H. Leonhardt and C. M. Cardoso, Berlin, Germany) was used to prepare the expression constructs pECFP-PCNA (Clontech) by PCR-amplifying and cloning the SV40 nuclear localization signal into the NheI-AgeI sites, followed by ligating the PCNA-containing BsrGI-XbaI fragment from pGFPCNAL2 into the pECFP-C1 vector containing the SV40 nuclear localization signal. pUNG2-ECFP and pUNG2-EYFP constructs were prepared by cloning the AgeI-NotI fragment from pECFP-N1 and pEYFP-NI (Clontech) into the pUNG2EGFP construct (37Leonhardt H. Rahn H.-P. Weinzierl P. Sporbert A. Cremer T. Zink D. Cardoso C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified to be in-frame by sequencing. Confocal Microscopy and FRET Measurements—A Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning microscope equipped with a Plan-Apochromate 63×/1.4 oil immersion objective was used to examine images of 1-μm-thick slices of living cells. Fluorescence energy transfer (FRET) was determined by modifying the general equations given by Matyus (39Mátyus L. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1992; 12: 323-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) for use with the ECFP and EYFP fusion proteins as donor (D) and acceptor (A), respectively. FRET occurs if I 2 – I 1[I D2/I D1] – I 3[I A2/I A3] > 0, where I represents intensities in three channels given in arbitrary units (see also Ref. 40Youvan D.C. Coleman W.C. Silva C.M. Petersen J. Bylina E.J. Yang M. Biotechnol. et alia. 1997; 1: 1-16Google Scholar). Intensities were measured as follows: channel 1: I 1, A1, D1 = excitation (ex.) at (λ = 458, detection (det.) at 475 nm < (>525 nm (ECFP); channel 2: I2, D2, A2 = ex. at (λ = 458 nm, det. at (>560 nm; channel 3: I3, D3, A3 = ex. at (λ = 514 nm, det. at (>560 nm (EYFP). I D1, D2, D3 and I A1, A2, A3 are determined separately for cells transfected with only ECFP and EYFP fusion proteins, respectively, under the same settings and at the same levels of fluorescence intensities (I 1 and I 3) as cotransfected cells. FRET values were normalized to account for differences in the respective fluorochrome expression levels using the following equation: Normalized FRET (N FRET) = FRET/(I 1 × I 3)1/2 (41Xia Z. Lui Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Substrate Preparation and Biochemical Analyses—The structures of the DNA substrates used for biochemical analysis and the oligonucleotides used to prepare them are presented below in Tables II and III, respectively.

The single-stranded DNA was recovered in the eluate and precipitated with 3 V of a 100% ethanol/0.1 m sodium acetate solution. Pellets were re-suspended in sterile water and were subjected to scintillation counting for final concentration determination. All biochemical assays were performed using a minimum of two independent protein preparations at the indicated amounts and 1 nm substrate (unless otherwise indicated). The gel images show typical results evaluated using PhosphorImager/ImageQuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences). Exonuclease reactions were performed as previously described (43Machwe A. Ganunis R. Bohr V.A. Orren D.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2762-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) with the exonuclease substrate (substrate 1, Table II). One unit of E. coli DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment (New England BioLabs) was used as a control for exonuclease assays. Helicase assays were performed essentially as described in Fry et al. (44Fry M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12797-12802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) except that the reactions were performed for 30 min at 37 °C. Where indicated, ATP was excluded or substituted with 2.5 mm ATPγS (Roche Applied Science). WRN modulation of RAD52-mediated strand D-loop formation was performed essentially as described (45Kagawa W. Kurumizaka H. Ikawa S. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35201-35208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Specified amounts of RAD52 or RecA (New England BioLabs) were incubated at 37 °C with 1 nm of 5′-radioactively labeled oligonucleotide (Table II) for 10 min in the helicase reaction buffer with or without ATP as indicated. 1 nm of supercoiled pUC19 plasmid was subsequently added, and the reaction was carried out for a further 15 min. WRN at the indicated amounts was subsequently added, and the reactions were incubated for another 20 min. Reactions were terminated by adding final concentrations of SDS and proteinase K of 0.67% and 1 mg/ml, respectively, and the reaction products were analyzed on 1% agarose gels (0.5× TBE running buffer; 70 V, 50 min), which were incubated in a 0.5× TBE solution containing 50 μg/ml ethidium bromide prior to drying to visualize the input DNA as a loading control. Physical Interaction between WRN and RAD52—WRN interacts with several proteins (3Brosh Jr., R.M. Bohr V.A. Exp.

Rough cost estimates for the Elbe 2002 flood alone are ~$3 billion in the Czech Republic and >$9 billion in Germany--the worst flood ever in Europe. In this [Policy Forum][1], the Elbe 2002 flood is described in its historical context. Future flood protection and prevention planning must also consider the potential role of global warming in severe flooding of this kind.

https://openalex.org/W2031224368,"Macrophages play a central role in the development and progression of atherosclerotic lesions. It is well known that oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) promotes the recruitment of monocytes (which differentiate to macrophages) into the intima. We reported recently that ox-LDL blocks apoptosis in bone marrow-derived macrophages deprived of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) by a mechanism involving protein kinase B (PKB) (Hundal, R., Salh, B., Schrader, J., Gómez-Muñoz, A., Duronio, V., and Steinbrecher, U. (2001) J. Lipid Res. 42, 1483–1491). The aims of the present study were 1) to define the apoptotic pathway involved in the pro-survival effect of ox-LDL; 2) to determine which PKB target mediated this effect; and 3) to identify mechanisms responsible for PKB activation by ox-LDL. Apoptosis following M-CSF withdrawal was accompanied by activation of the caspase 9-caspase 3 cascade and cytochrome c release from mitochondria, but the caspase 8 pathway was unaffected. M-CSF withdrawal resulted in a marked and selective reduction in Bcl-XL protein and mRNA levels, and this decrease was prevented by ox-LDL. The ability of ox-LDL to preserve Bcl-XL levels was blocked by NFκB antagonists, thereby implicating IκB kinase as a key PKB target. M-CSF deprivation resulted in activation of acid sphingomyelinase and an increase in ceramide levels. Desipramine (a sphingomyelinase inhibitor) prevented the increase in ceramide and inhibited apoptosis after M-CSF deprivation. Ox-LDL completely blocked the increase in acid sphingomyelinase activity as well as the increase in ceramide after M-CSF deprivation. Pretreatment of macrophages with C2-ceramide reversed the effect of ox-LDL on PKB and macrophage survival. These results indicate that ox-LDL prevents apoptosis in M-CSF-deprived macrophages at least in part by inhibiting acid sphingomyelinase. This in turn prevents ceramide-induced down-regulation of PKB, the activity of which is required to maintain production of Bcl-XL.

Macrophage-derived foam cells play an important role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis (1Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Google Scholar). They are histologic hallmarks of early and intermediate atherosclerotic lesions and account for a substantial proportion of the volume of such lesions. More recently, foam cells have been shown to be key determinants of plaque instability, in that macrophage-rich lesions are prone to undergo plaque rupture and thrombosis. One obvious factor contributing to the propensity of macrophage-rich lesions to rupture is that foam cells have much less mechanical strength than the arterial connective tissue matrix. In addition, there is evidence that macrophages directly contribute to matrix degradation by secreting matrix-degrading enzymes known as matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). 1The abbreviations used are: MMPs, matrix metalloproteases; LDL, low density lipoprotein; ox-LDL, oxidized LDL; BMDM, bone marrow-derived macrophages; M-CSF, macrophage colony-stimulating factor; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PKB, protein kinase B; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MTS, [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt]; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; CAPE, caffeic acid phenylethyl ester; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; PMS, phenazine methosulfate. Macrophages isolated from atheromas constitutively secrete the metalloproteases, MMP-1 and MMP-3 (2Galis Z.S. Sukhova G.K. Kranzhofer R. Clark S. Libby P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 402-406Google Scholar, 3Galis Z.S. Sukhova G.K. Libby P. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 974-980Google Scholar). Levels of MMP-1 and MMP-3 are increased in unstable lesions (3Galis Z.S. Sukhova G.K. Libby P. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 974-980Google Scholar, 4Brown D. Hibbs M. Kearney M. Loushin C. Isner J. Circulation. 1995; 91: 2125-2131Google Scholar, 5Galis Z.S. Muszynski M. Sukhova G.K. Simon-Morrissey E. Libby P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 748: 501-507Google Scholar), and macrophages are responsible for the increased levels of matrix-degrading enzymes in lesions (6Sukhova G.K. Schonbeck U. Rabkin E. Schoen F.J. Poole A.R. Billinghurst R.C. Libby P. Circulation. 1999; 99: 2503-2509Google Scholar). In view of this critical role of macrophages as determinants of plaque disruption, a comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence macrophage numbers and/or function in atherosclerotic lesions is of obvious importance. Early and intermediate atheromas are highly cellular and are accompanied by evidence of active cell proliferation (7Kockx M.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1519-15122Google Scholar). Although macrophages are often thought to be terminally differentiated cells and incapable of replication, they are the predominant cell type-expressing proliferating cell nuclear antigen in atherosclerotic lesions, even in lesions containing mostly smooth muscle-derived cells (8Katsuda S. Coltrera M.D. Ross R. Gown A.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 1787-1793Google Scholar, 9Rekhter M.D. Gordon D. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 668-677Google Scholar). In contrast to the cellularity of early lesions, the necrotic core that characterizes advanced lesions is composed in large part of lipid debris from macrophages and smooth muscle cells that have undergone apoptotic or necrotic death (7Kockx M.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1519-15122Google Scholar). Thus, signal transduction pathways leading to growth or death are evidently activated at different stages of lesion evolution. Vascular endothelial cells express Fas as well as its ligand FasL but are normally resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis (10Sata M. Walsh K. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1682-1689Google Scholar). In contrast, most other cells, including peripheral blood monocytes, express only Fas (11Nagata S. Golstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Google Scholar). Endothelial FasL expression might be expected to attenuate mononuclear cell infiltrates in the arterial intima, as monocytes would be programmed to undergo apoptosis through the Fas/FasL signal by interacting with endothelial cells as they transmigrate into the intima. Macrophage apoptosis (terminal dUTP nick-end labeling positivity) is seen in atherosclerotic lesions, particularly after interventions that reduce cholesterol levels, and this is accompanied by a dramatic and selective loss of macrophages from lesions (12Kockx M.M. De Meyer G.R. Buyssens N. Knaapen M.W. Bult H. Herman A.G. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 378-387Google Scholar). Recent results raise the intriguing possibility that oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) might be a mechanistic link between the above relationship between cholesterol levels and macrophage populations in the arterial intima. Ox-LDL has been shown to promote macrophage recruitment and retention in lesions (13Quinn M.T. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2995-2998Google Scholar), macrophage proliferation (14Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Hakamata H. Sasaki T. Yui S. Yamazaki M. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31430-31435Google Scholar, 15Biwa T. Hakamata H. Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Suzuki H. Kodama T. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28305-28313Google Scholar, 16Martens J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10903-10910Google Scholar), and macrophage survival (18Hamilton J.A. Myers D. Jessup W. Cochrane F. Byrne R. Whitty G. Moss S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 98-105Google Scholar). We showed recently (19Hundal R. Salh B. Schrader J. Gómez-Muñoz A. Duronio V. Steinbrecher U. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1483-1491Google Scholar) that ox-LDL inhibits apoptosis in cultured bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM), whereas native LDL or acetyl LDL had no effect. Ox-LDL was shown to cause activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and its downstream target protein kinase B (PKB), leading to PKB-dependent phosphorylation of three proteins involved in apoptosis, the forkhead transcription factor, IκB kinase (IκK), and Bad (19Hundal R. Salh B. Schrader J. Gómez-Muñoz A. Duronio V. Steinbrecher U. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1483-1491Google Scholar). The first objective of the present study was to define the relative importance of the “death receptor” pathway compared with the mitochondrial pathway in the pro-survival effect of ox-LDL. PKB phosphorylates forkhead transcription factor, and this prevents them from inducing transcription of pro-apoptotic proteins such as FasL (20Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Google Scholar, 21Kops G.J. de Ruiter N.D. De Vries-Smits A.M. Powell D.R. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 1999; 398: 630-634Google Scholar, 22Tang E.D. Nunez G. Barr F.G. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16741-16746Google Scholar). The Fas/FasL death receptor pathway leads to caspase 3 activation and apoptosis via caspase 8. In contrast, PKB-dependent phosphorylation of Bad and IκK inhibits the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, which involves cytochrome c release and caspase 9 activation upstream of caspase 3. In this report, we show that caspase 9 but not caspase 8 is activated in BMDM after M-CSF withdrawal, and this activation is blocked by ox-LDL. The second objective of this study was to determine whether Bcl-2 family members were involved in the inhibition of apoptosis by ox-LDL. We reported previously that ox-LDL-induced PKB activation in BMDM was accompanied by phosphorylation of Bad (a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein that is sequestered after phosphorylation) (19Hundal R. Salh B. Schrader J. Gómez-Muñoz A. Duronio V. Steinbrecher U. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1483-1491Google Scholar). However, in more recent experiments we found that Bad phosphorylation was inconsistent and not necessary for the pro-survival effect of ox-LDL. Therefore, we looked for other Bcl-2 family members that might be regulated by PKB via IκK and NFκB. We focused on Bcl-XL because it contains NFκB-binding sites in its promoter (23Chen C. Edelstein L.C. Gelinas C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2687-2695Google Scholar) and can prevent the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c as well as the subsequent activation of the caspase 9-caspase 3 apoptotic cascade in the cytoplasm (24Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Google Scholar). In this study, we show that M-CSF withdrawal in BMDM is associated with a selective decrease in Bcl-XL levels and that this decrease is prevented by ox-LDL in parallel with its effects on PKB activity. The third objective was to determine whether the pro-survival effect of ox-LDL was mediated through an effect on ceramide levels. Apoptosis induced by a variety of agents is associated with ceramide generation, and one of the mechanisms for this is inhibition of the PKB survival pathway (25Tepper A.D. Cock J.G. de Vries E. Borst J. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24308-24312Google Scholar, 26Huang C. Ma W. Ding M. Bowden G.T. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27753-27757Google Scholar). The present study indicates that M-CSF withdrawal is accompanied by a major increase in ceramide levels. This is shown to be due to activation of acid sphingomyelinase, and this activation of sphingomyelinase was blocked by ox-LDL. That ceramide generation in this model was both necessary and sufficient for apoptosis was demonstrated by the findings that desipramine, a sphingomyelinase inhibitor, completely blocked apoptosis and that addition of ceramide abolished the anti-apoptotic effect of ox-LDL. RPMI 1640 medium, phenazine methosulfate (PMS), sphingomyelin, ceramide, and desipramine were obtained from Sigma. Defined fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from Hyclone (Logan, UT). Fisher supplied 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS). C2-ceramide, C2-dihydroceramide, dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol, and ceramide 1-phosphate were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). [3H]Palmitate and [N-methyl-14C] bovine sphingomyelin were obtained from Mandel Scientific (Guelph, Ontario, Canada). Antibodies to PKB, Bcl-2, Bax, caspase 3, caspase 8, and caspase 9 were purchased from Stressgen Biotechnologies (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). GAPDH antibody was from Advanced Immunochemical (Long Beach, CA). Antibodies to Bad, Bcl-XL, and active caspase 3 were supplied by Pharmingen. Phospho-PKB (Ser-473), phospho-PKB (Thr-308), phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204), and phospho-IκB-α (Ser-32) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Goat anti-rabbit IgG and goat anti-mouse IgG, horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies, Escherichia coli diacylglycerol kinase, β-octyl glucoside, Z-VAD-FMK, Z-DEVD-FMK, Z-IETD-FMK, Z-LEHD-FMK, NFκB inhibitory peptide (SN 50), caffeic acid phenylethyl ester (CAPE), PD 98059, U0126, LY 294002, and wortmannin were Calbiochem products supplied by VWR Canlab (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Nitrocellulose membranes, protein standards, and Bradford protein assay kits were purchased from Bio-Rad. Reagents for enhanced chemiluminescence and [32P]ATP were from Amersham Biosciences or Pierce. Lipoprotein Isolation and Oxidation—LDL (d = 1.019–1.063) was isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation of EDTA-anticoagulated fasting plasma obtained from healthy normolipidemic volunteers (27Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 43: 1345-1353Google Scholar). The concentrations of EDTA in LDL preparations were reduced prior to oxidation by dialysis against Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 10 μm EDTA. Oxidation was performed using 200 μg/ml LDL in Dulbecco's PBS containing 5 μm CuSO4 incubated at 37 °C for 24 h (28Steinbrecher U.P. Witztum J.L. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Arteriosclerosis. 1987; 7: 135-143Google Scholar). Oxidation was arrested with 40 μm butylated hydroxytoluene and 300 μm EDTA, and the modified LDL was then washed and concentrated LDL to about 2 mg/ml using Amicon Centriplus 20 ultrafilters (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Concentration of LDL protein was determined by a modification of the Lowry method with bovine albumin as the standard (28Steinbrecher U.P. Witztum J.L. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Arteriosclerosis. 1987; 7: 135-143Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Bone marrow cells were isolated from the femurs of 6–8-week-old female CD-1 mice as described (18Hamilton J.A. Myers D. Jessup W. Cochrane F. Byrne R. Whitty G. Moss S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 98-105Google Scholar). Cells were plated for 24 h in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS and 10% L-cell conditioned medium as the source of M-CSF. The non-adherent cells were removed and cultured in the above medium until 80% confluence was reached (5–7 days). Cells were then harvested using a Teflon cell lifter. To render cells quiescent prior to experiments, they were washed once with RPMI 1640 and incubated overnight (18 h) in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS but without M-CSF. Cell Viability Assay—Macrophages were seeded at 104 cells/well in 96-well plates and incubated overnight in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS but without M-CSF. Ox-LDL and/or other compounds were then added, and cell survival was estimated by measuring the rate of reduction of the tetrazolium dye MTS. 20 μl/well of MTS/PMS solution was added to microwells containing 100 μl of culture medium. The final concentration of MTS was 333 μg/ml MTS and that of PMS was 25 μm. After incubation for 4 h at 37 °C, the absorbance at 490 nm was recorded using an ELISA plate reader. For ceramide or inhibitor studies, cells were pre-incubated with inhibitors, 25 μm C2-ceramide, or C2-dihydroceramide for 1 h prior to the addition of ox-LDL. Ceramide and Sphingomyelin Determination—Radioactivity in ceramide was assayed after labeling of BMDM with 5 μCi/ml of [3H]palmitate for 24 h in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS. The cells were washed twice with PBS and were then incubated with or without 25 μg/ml ox-LDL or 10 μm desipramine. Cells were harvested by scraping into 1 ml of methanol, which was then mixed with 1 ml of chloroform and 0.9 ml of 2 m KCl, 0.2 m H3PO4. The aqueous phase was discarded, and the chloroform phase was dried under nitrogen. Ceramides were isolated by TLC by using Silica Gel 60-coated glass plates developed with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (9:1:1 by volume) for half their length and then with petroleum ether/diethyl ether/acetic acid (60:40:1 by volume). Sphingomyelin was isolated by TLC in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/formic acid/water (35:15:6:2:1 by volume). Lipids were visualized by iodine and identified by co-chromatography with authentic standards. Radioactivity was measured by scraping the corresponding bands from TLC plates and liquid scintillation counting. Diacylglycerol Kinase Assay for Ceramide Mass—Ceramide levels were measured using the diacylglycerol kinase method as described previously (29Bielawska A. Perry D.K. Hannun Y.A. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 141-150Google Scholar, 30Ogretmen B. Pettus B.J. Rossi M.J. Wood R. Usta J. Szulc Z. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12960-12969Google Scholar). In brief, total cellular lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol, resuspended in a micellar solution of 7.5% β-octyl glucoside and 25 mm dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol, and then diacylglycerol kinase and [γ-32P]ATP were added. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, 50 μg of unlabeled ceramide 1-phosphate was added as a carrier, and lipids were extracted and separated on Silica 60 TLC plates with chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (10:4:3:2:1 by volume). Ceramide 1-phosphate spots were scraped from the plates and quantitated by scintillation counting with normalization to total lipid radioactivity. The assay was calibrated with a standard curve of authentic ceramide. Sphingomyelinase Assay—The activities of neutral and acidic sphingomyelinases were determined exactly as described by Liu and Hannun (31Liu B. Hannun Y.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 164-167Google Scholar) using [N-methyl-14C] sphingomyelin as the substrate. Western Blotting—Macrophages were plated at 5 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates or 5 × 106 cells/well in 100-mm dishes. Cells were incubated overnight in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS but without M-CSF. Ox-LDL and/or other compounds were then added as described above. Cells were harvested and lysed in ice-cold homogenization buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 25 μm β-methyl aspartic acid, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, and the protein content of supernatants was quantified with the Bradford protein assay. 50 μg of protein from each sample was loaded onto a 10 or 15% SDS-PAGE separating gel. Gels were calibrated using prestained SDS-PAGE low molecular weight standards. Proteins were then transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose paper, blocked for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 4% skim milk, 0.01% NaN3, and 0.1% Tween 20, and then incubated overnight with the primary antibody in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20 at room temperature. After three washes with TBS, 0.1% Tween 20, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at 1:5000 dilution for 1 h. Bands were visualized by using enhanced chemiluminescence. Intensity of bands was quantified with NIH Image version 1.62 or with a Fluorochem 8000 imaging system (Canberra Packard Canada, Mississauga Ontario, Canada). Subcellular Fractionation and Cytochrome c Assay—For isolation of nuclei, cell pellets were lysed in 0.5% Triton buffer and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. The nuclear pellet was washed twice in PBS and resuspended in buffer containing 6 m urea. Nuclei were then sonicated to shear DNA. For subcellular fractionation cells were washed, harvested with a cell lifter, and suspended for 30 min in ice-cold buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm sucrose, 10 μm aprotinin, 10 μm pepstatin A, 10 μm leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were subjected to nitrogen cavitation at 60 pounds/square inch for 20 min and then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min to remove nuclei and intact cells. A second centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min was done to obtain cytosol. The pelleted mitochondria were lysed by sonicating for 20 s in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μm aprotinin, 10 μm pepstatin A, 10 μm leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and recentrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. Serial dilutions of cytosolic and mitochondrial samples were assayed for cytochrome c content using an ELISA kit from MBL International Corp. (Boston, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse Transcriptase PCR for Bcl-XL—Total RNA from BMDM was reverse-transcribed using Superscript II® according to the directions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). By using either cDNA or mouse genomic DNA as a positive control template, Bcl-xL and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were amplified by PCR, generating a 410-bp fragment for Bcl-XL (forward primer, 5′-CTTAATTCCGTGGTGGTCGACTTTCTCTCC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CGGAATTCCGACCCCAGTTTACTCCATCCC-3′) or an 851-bp fragment for GAPDH (forward primer, 5′-CGCGCTGAGTATGTCGTGGAGTCT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GTATTATGGGGGTCTGGGATGGAA-3′). The amplification conditions are as follows: 1 cycle at 95 °C for 2 min and then 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Final extension was performed at 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products were electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed with a Fluorochem 8000 imaging system. Flow Cytometry—Macrophages were seeded at 106 cells per well in 6-well culture plates. For assessment of DNA content, macrophages were harvested by scraping, fixed in 70% ethanol for 30 min at room temperature, and then stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide in 0.1% Triton, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05 mg/ml RNase A. For assessment of apoptosis and necrosis by vital staining, macrophages were harvested by scraping, suspended in PBS containing 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 at 37 °C for 7 min, and then 1 μg/ml propidium iodide was added for a further 5 min. To quantify phosphatidylserine externalization, macrophages were harvested and incubated with annexin V-FITC (Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA content was analyzed by flow cytometry (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL) on the FL-3 channel, and Hoechst 33342 or FITC fluorescence was measured on the FL-1 channel, with gating to exclude debris and cellular aggregates. Ten thousand events were counted for each analysis. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Macrophages were grown on sterile glass coverslips and then exposed to the indicated experimental conditions. For evaluation of phosphatidylserine externalization, the coverslips were washed twice with cold PBS and then incubated in 10 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 5 μl of annexin V-FITC (Pharmingen) for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. For localization of cytochrome c, the coverslips were washed three times with cold PBS and then fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde and 0.18% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Coverslips were then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 15 min, incubated with a monoclonal anti-cytochrome c antibody (Pharmingen) for 45 min, and then with a goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Portland, OR) for 30 min. Cells were then examined immediately on a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope equipped with a digital imaging system. Statistical Analysis—Results were expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was done using analysis of variance or Student's t test as appropriate, with level of significance set at p ≤ 0.05. Growth Factor Withdrawal Induces Apoptosis in Bone Marrow-derived Macrophages—When BMDM are cultured in the absence of growth factors, they typically undergo apoptosis after about 24 h (32Jaworowski A. Wilson N.J. Christy E. Byrne R. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15127-15133Google Scholar). Ox-LDL completely prevents the loss of macrophage viability associated with growth factor withdrawal (19Hundal R. Salh B. Schrader J. Gómez-Muñoz A. Duronio V. Steinbrecher U. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1483-1491Google Scholar). To verify that the changes in macrophage viability in the present experiments were due to apoptosis, quiescent BMDM were incubated for 0–24 h in the absence of M-CSF and doubly stained with Hoechst 33342 to identify apoptotic cells and with propidium iodide to identify necrotic cells. Flow cytometric analysis showed that by 24 h most cells stain with Hoechst 33342, and about half of these are also propidium iodide-positive (Fig. 1). This indicates the primary mode of cell death in these experiments is apoptosis but that most cells subsequently undergo secondary necrosis. Cells incubated with ox-LDL showed no increase in Hoechst 33342 staining. Annexin V immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed that M-CSF withdrawal leads to phosphatidylserine exposure (Fig. 2A) and that this is prevented by ox-LDL (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Removal of M-CSF induces phosphatidylserine externalization in BMDM. BMDM were grown on coverslips and pre-incubated overnight in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS but without M-CSF. After a 24-h further incubation without M-CSF (A) or without M-CSF but with 25 μg/ml ox-LDL (B), cells were washed and stained with annexin V-FITC. The left panel of each shows a gray scale rendering of an immunofluorescence micrograph taken with ×100 objective.

Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Google Scholar, 34Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Google Scholar). To determine whether apoptosis after M-CSF withdrawal was due to activation of one or both of these pathways, immunoblot analysis of cell lysates for these caspases was performed. As shown in Fig. 3, following M-CSF withdrawal there was a loss of pro-caspases 3 and 9, and a concomitant increase in the fragments corresponding to the respective active caspases. Ox-LDL prevented cleavage of these pro-caspases. There was no evidence of cleavage of procaspase 8 after M-CSF withdrawal. We have demonstrated previously (19Hundal R. Salh B. Schrader J. Gómez-Muñoz A. Duronio V. Steinbrecher U. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1483-1491Google Scholar) the functional activation of caspase 3 in this system as evidenced by cleavage of its substrate, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. To verify that caspase 9 activation was responsible for cell death after M-CSF withdrawal, the effects of selective caspase inhibitors on macrophage viability after growth factor withdrawal was measured.

The origin of slip partitioning is important to structural geology, tectonophysics, and earthquake mechanics. Partitioning can be explained by the upward elastoplastic propagation of oblique slip from a fault or shear zone at depth. The strain field ahead of the propagating fault separates into zones of predominantly normal, reverse, and strike-slip faulting. The model successfully predicts the distribution of fault types along parts of the San Andreas and Haiyuan faults."

We performed a structure-based mutational analysis of ERK2 to identify surface areas that are important for recognition of its interacting proteins. We show that binding and activation of MKP3 by ERK2 involve two distinct protein-protein interaction sites in ERK2. Thus, the common docking (CD) site composed of Glu-79, Tyr-126, Arg-133, Asp-160, Tyr-314, Asp-316, and Asp-319 are important for high affinity MKP3 binding but not essential for ERK2-induced MKP3 activation. MKP3 activation requires residues Tyr-111, Thr-116, Leu-119, Lys-149, Arg-189, Trp-190, Glu-218, Arg-223, Lys-229, and His-230 in the ERK2 substrate-binding region, located distal to the common docking site. Interestingly, many of the residues important for MKP3 recognition are also used for Elk1 binding and phosphorylation. In addition to the shared residues, there are also residues that are unique to each target recognition. There is evidence indicating that the CD site and the substrate-binding region defined here are also utilized for MEK1 recognition, and indeed, we demonstrate that the binding of MKP3, Elk1, and MEK1 to ERK2 is mutually exclusive. Taken together, our data suggest that the efficiency and fidelity of ERK2 signaling is achieved by a bipartite recognition process. In this model, one part of the ERK2-binding proteins (e.g. the kinase interaction motif sequence) docks to the CD site located on the back side of the ERK2 catalytic pocket for high affinity association, whereas the interaction of the substrate-binding region with another structural element (e.g. the FXFP motif in MKP3 and Elk1) may not only stabilize binding but also provide contacts crucial for modulating the activity and/or specificity of ERK2 target molecules.

Cobb M.H. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2449-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). The three best characterized MAP kinase cascades are the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathway that responds to stimuli that induce cell proliferation and differentiation, the c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) pathway, and the p38 kinase pathway, both of which are activated in response to environmental stresses. The MAP kinases are the major convergence points in these signaling pathways. Each MAP kinase phosphorylates a distinct spectrum of substrates, which include key regulatory enzymes, cytoskeletal proteins, regulators of apoptosis, nuclear receptors, and many transcription factors. Such a broad array of substrates is consistent with the observation that MAP kinases control many critical cell functions. Because of the critical importance of MAP kinase in cellular signaling, the activity of the MAP kinase is tightly regulated. The activation of the MAP kinase activity requires the phosphorylation of the Thr and Tyr residues in the activation loop by the dual specificity MAP kinase/ERK kinases (MEKs) (3Ahn N.G. Seger R.

MAP kinase deactivation occurs through the action of multiple protein phosphatases (5Zhou B. Wang Z.-X. Zhao Y. Brautigan D.L. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31818-31825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Although the importance of MAP kinases in cellular signaling is well established, there is limited understanding of the molecular basis for specific MAP kinase recognition by its activators, inactivators, and substrates. Such knowledge is essential for comprehension of the ability of MAP kinases to integrate diverse biological stimuli and to transmit signals to the nucleus, in order to generate appropriate cellular responses. Recent studies (6Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 7Tanoue T. Maeda R. Adachi M. Nishida E.

Our previous studies have focused on the interaction between ERK2, the founding member of the MAP kinase family, and MAP kinase phosphatase 3 (MKP3) (9Zhou B. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35526-35534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 10Zhao Y. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 6506-6515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The MKPs are dual specificity phosphatases capable of dephosphorylating both Tyr(P) and Thr(P) in the activation loop of MAP kinases (12Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 13Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). MKP3 is highly specific in dephosphorylating and inactivating ERK2, with a k cat/K m for the double phosphorylated ERK2 that is 106-fold higher than those for the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) or the bisphosphorylated peptide derived from the activation loop of ERK2 (10Zhao Y. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32382-32391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The superiority of the double phosphorylated ERK2 to the ERK2-derived phosphopeptide most likely results from specific protein-protein interactions between ERK2 and MKP3 that are not available between the ERK2 peptide and MKP3. Interestingly, the phosphatase activity of the MKP3-catalyzed pNPP reaction can be dramatically increased in the presence of ERK2 (14Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S. Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Mechanistic and kinetic studies suggest that ERK2 binding to MKP3 elicit activation of MKP3 activity by facilitating the repositioning of active site residues and general acid loop closure in MKP3 (9Zhou B.

To identify structural features in MKP3 that are important for ERK2 binding and ERK2-induced activation, we carried out a systematic mutational and deletion analysis of MKP3 (11Zhou B. Wu L. Shen K. Zhang J. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6506-6515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Because the activation of MKP3 by ERK2 is dose-dependent and saturable, we can determine both the dissociation constant between ERK2 and MKP3 and the extent of MKP3 activation from the concentration dependence of ERK2 on the MKP3-catalyzed pNPP reaction. Furthermore, we have developed a competitive assay to determine the binding affinity of fragments/domains of MKP3 that are important for ERK2 recognition. With these assays, we were able to quantitatively evaluate the contributions that residues/regions within MKP3 make to ERK2 binding and ERK2-induced MKP3 activation. Our results show that recognition and activation of MKP3 by ERK2 involve multiple regions of MKP3 (11Zhou B. Wu L. Shen K. Zhang J. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6506-6515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have identified structural elements in ERK2 that are important for binding and activation of MKP3 using the activation- and competition-based assays with wild-type MKP3 and an ensemble of ERK2 mutants. In addition, we have unveiled structural features in ERK2 that mediate specific Elk1 recognition. Our results show that protein-protein interactions between ERK2 and its cognate regulators and substrates proceed with a bipartite recognition mechanism. DNA Constructs and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The coding sequence of ERK2 was subcloned into pET15b to yield the N-terminal His6-tagged ERK2. MKP3 with a C-terminal His6 tag in pET21a was described previously (11Zhou B. Wu L. Shen K. Zhang J. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6506-6515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The cDNA for the constitutively active MEK1 (MEK1/G7B, i.e. MEK1/Δ44–51/S218D/M219D/N221D/S221D) in pRSETa was kindly provided by Dr. Natalie Ahn. Oligonucleotide primers CATATGACTGAGATCACCCAACC (NdeI site underlined) and GGATCCTCATGGCTTCTGGGGCCC (BamHI site underlined) were used to generate the N-terminal His6-tagged Elk1 (residues 307–428) by PCR using pGEX-2T/Elk1-(307–428) (a generous gift from Dr. Kun-Liang Guan) as a template. The PCR product was subcloned into pET14b at NdeI/BamHI. Mutant ERK2 and MKP3 were generated by PCRs according to the standard procedure of the QuickChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using either pET15b-His6-ERK2 or pET21a-MKP3-His6 as a template. All mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. Peptide Synthesis, Protein Expression, and Purification—A synthetic peptide derived from Elk1 (residues 387–399, Ac-Arg-Arg-Pro387-Arg-Ser-Pro-Ala-Lys-Leu-Ser-Phe-Gln-Phe-Pro-Ser399-NH2), which contains an ERK2 phosphorylation site Ser-389 (16Gille H. Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Cobb M.H. Shaw P.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) and an ERK2 docking site sequence FQFP (17Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), was used in the competition-based assay. The Elk1 peptide was synthesized using standard protocol, purified by high pressure liquid chromatography, and characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry by Alpha Diagnostic International. The purity of the peptide was determined to be close to 100%. Wild-type and mutant N-terminal His6-tagged ERK2s, wild-type and mutant C-terminal His6-tagged MKP3s, N-terminal His6-tagged Elk1-(307–428), and N-terminal His6-tagged MEK1/G7B were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21/DE3 and purified using standard procedures of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) affinity purification as described previously (11Zhou B.

Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford dye binding assay (Bio-Rad) diluted according to the manufacturer's recommendations with bovine serum albumin as standard. Determination of Dissociation Constants—The dissociation constants of ERK2 and its mutants for MKP3 were determined by the activation assay at 30 °C and pH 7.0, in 50 mm 3,3-dimethylglutarate buffer, containing 1 mm EDTA with an ionic strength of 0.15 m adjusted by addition of NaCl (11Zhou B. Wu L. Shen K. Zhang J. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6506-6515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, the MKP3-catalyzed hydrolysis of the p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) reaction was initiated by the addition 0.2 μm MKP3 to a reaction mixture (200 μl) containing 40 mm pNPP (saturating concentration) and various concentrations of ERK2 or its mutants. The reaction was quenched after 20–40 min by addition 50 μl of 5 n NaOH. After quenching, 200 μl of the reaction mixture was transferred to a 96-well plate, and the amount of p-nitrophenol was determined from the absorbance at 405 nm using a Spectra MAX340 microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices) with a molar extinction coefficient of 18,000 m–1 cm–1. The dissociation constant K d was calculated by fitting the absorbance at 405 nm versus ERK2 concentration data to Equation 1 using the nonlinear regression program Kaleidagraph, A=A0-(A0-A∞)(CM+CE+Kd)-(CM+CE+Kd)2-4×CM×CE2×CM(Eq. 1) where A is the absorbance at 405 nm of the sample in the presence of ERK2; A 0 is the absorbance at 405 nm in the absence of ERK2; A 0 is the absorbance at 405 nm when the concentration of ERK2 is infinite; C M is the MKP3 concentration which is fixed at 0.2 μm; C E is the ERK2 concentration during titration, and K d is the dissociation constant for ERK2 binding to MKP3. To determine the affinity of Elk1 or MEK1 for ERK2, the competitive binding assay was used (11Zhou B. Wu L. Shen K. Zhang J. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6506-6515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In this assay, the reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.1 μm MKP3 in a mixture (0.2 ml) containing 40 mm pNPP, 1.2 μm ERK2, and various concentrations of the Elk1 peptide, Elk1-(307–428), or MEK1 at 30 °C and pH 7.0, in 50 mm 3,3-dimethylglutarate buffer, containing 1 mm EDTA with an ionic strength of 0.15 m adjusted by addition of NaCl. The reaction was quenched by addition 50 μl of 5 n NaOH after 30 min. The data were fitted to Equation 2 by nonlinear regression analysis to obtain the dissociation constants of Elk1 and MEK1 for ERK2, AA0=A∞A0+1-A∞A0×1+KdMC0E1-2×KdM(KdL+C0L-C0E)-(KdL+C0L-C0E)2+4×C0E×KdL(Eq. 2) where Elk1 (or MEK1) and MKP3 are assumed to bind ERK2 competitively, and MKP3 concentration is much smaller than ERK2 concentration. A is the absorbance at 405 nm in the presence of Elk1 or MEK1. A 0 is the absorbance at 405 nm in the absence of Elk1 or MEK1. A 0 is the absorbance at 405 nm when the concentration of Elk1 or MEK1 is infinite. C0E is ERK2 concentration which is fixed at 1.2 μm. C0L is Elk1 or MEK1 concentration during titration. KdM is the dissociation constant for MKP3 binding to ERK2 with a value of 0.17 μm (11Zhou B. Wu L. Shen K. Zhang J. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6506-6515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and KdL is the dissociation constant of Elk1 (or MEK1) for ERK2. GST Pull-down and Western Blot Analysis—The binding of MEK1 and MKP3 to ERK2 was examined by GST pull-down and Western blot analyses. GST-ERK2 (10 μg) or GST-MKP3 (10 μg) in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.0 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4) was immobilized on 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences), respectively, with gentle agitation at 4 °C for 2 h. In one experiment, different amounts of MKP3 and MEK1 (0–10 μg) were mixed in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and incubated with 20 μl of GST-ERK2 bound beads. In another experiment, different amounts of ERK2 and MEK1 (0–20 μg) were mixed in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and incubated with 20 μl of GST-MKP3 bound beads. After incubation with gentle agitation at 4 °C for 2 h, the beads were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then boiled in 25 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer for 5 min to release the proteins from the beads. The sample was microcentrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 2 min, and 10 μl of the supernatant was loaded on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. When the electrophoresis was complete, the proteins on the gel were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane using a Trans-Blot SD semi-dry electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad) at 150 mA and at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was blocked in 5% milk in TBS-T (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.6) for1hat room temperature and then incubated with mouse anti-His6 monoclonal antibody (sc-8036, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. After washing with TBS-T, the membrane was incubated with goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (sc-2005, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. The immunocomplexes were detected by chemiluminescence upon incubation with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was immediately expose to film for 1–5 min to visualize the His6-tagged proteins. ERK2 Kinase Assay—The kinase activity of wild-type and mutant ERK2s was monitored by a radioisotope assay in which the rate of incorporation of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP into a substrate was directly measured. Reactions were carried out in 50 μl of the kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4), containing ERK2 at a final concentration of 0.5 μm and varied concentrations of the protein substrates, myelin basic protein (MBP, Sigma), or Elk1. Reactions were initiated by the addition 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; NEG002A) (100 cpm/pmol) and allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 40 min for MBP and 25 min for Elk1. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 9.0% (final 1.5%) phosphoric acid. The 32P-labeled product was separated from [γ-32P]ATP using P81 phosphocellulose paper (Whatman, 2.1 cm), which binds to the protein or peptide product but not ATP and its metabolites. Detailed procedures are as follows: 30 μl of the quenched reaction mixture was spotted onto the 2.1-cm sized P81 paper strips. After washing the strips with 0.5% phosphoric acid 4 times (2 min each, 10–15 ml of 0.5% phosphoric acid per paper strip) with gentle agitation followed by 1 wash with water and 1 wash with acetone, the P81 papers were dried with a hair dryer and inserted into a 5-ml scintillation tube. Four ml of scintillation liquid was added, and the incorporation of 32P into the product was counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Controls were carried out in which ERK2 and the substrate were replaced by buffer. Each sample was measured in triplicate. On the basis of ERK2 concentration dependence of MKP3 activation, we developed biochemical assays that provide quantitative assessment of the importance of structural features in MKP3 for ERK2 recognition, both in terms of ERK2 binding affinity and propensity to be activated by ERK2 (11Zhou B. Wu L. Shen K. Zhang J. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6506-6515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). By using these assays, we discovered that binding and activation of MKP3 by ERK2 involves multiple regions of MKP3. Obviously, structural elements in ERK2 that are important for MKP3 binding and activation can be identified by the same approach using wild-type MKP3 and various ERK2 mutants designed based on available structural and biochemical data. In the current study we provide evidence that MKP3 binding and ERK2-induced MKP3 activation require two distinct surface areas of ERK2. Our data further suggest that recognition of MKP3, MEK1, and Elk1 by ERK2 requires a conserved bipartite protein-protein recognition mechanism. Definition of ERK2 Common Docking Site for MKP3—Many ERK2-interacting proteins such as ERK2 activators (e.g. MEK1/2), inactivators (e.g. MKP3 and HePTP), and substrates (e.g. RSK1 and Elk1) contain a kinase interaction motif (KIM) characterized by a cluster of 2–3 positively charged Arg or Lys residues that are important for ERK2 binding (6Tanoue T.

Deletion of the KIM sequence (residues 61–75) from MKP3 resulted in a 135-fold reduction in ERK2 binding affinity but did not affect the propensity of MKP3 to be activated by ERK2 (11Zhou B. Wu L. Shen K. Zhang J. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6506-6515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that all ERK2-interacting proteins may bind ERK2 through electrostatic interactions between the positively charged KIM motif and a common docking (CD) domain in ERK2 composed of a stretch of negatively charged amino acids (e.g. Asp-316 and Asp-319) situated opposite to the kinase catalytic cleft (6Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Residue Asp-319 in the CD domain of ERK2 is conserved in all MAP kinases from yeast to man. A dominant gain-of-function mutation of the rolled MAP kinase gene in Drosophila, termed Sevenmaker (rlsevenmaker), contains a single amino acid substitution of the analogous Asp-334 by an Asn (D334N) and activates several developmental pathways (24Brunner D. Oellers N. Szabad J. Biggs III, W.H. Zipursky S.L. Hafen E. Cell. 1994; 76: 875-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The same mutation in mammalian ERK2 (ERK2/D319N) appears to be resistant to inactivation by MKPs in transfected cells (25Bott C.M. Thorneycroft S.G. Marshall C.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 26Chu Y. Solski P.A. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Kelly K. J. Biol.

Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar) indicate that ERK2/D319N displays reduced affinity for MKP3 and is unable to activate the MKP3 phosphatase activity. However, using the quantitative activation-based assay, we were able to establish the K d of ERK2/D319N for MKP3 (14.8 ± 1.2 μm), which is 87-fold larger than that of the wild-type ERK2 (11Zhou B. Wu L. Shen K. Zhang J. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6506-6515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). More importantly, we found that ERK2/D319N can activate MKP3 to the same level induced by the wild-type ERK2 when a saturating amount of ERK2/D319N is present in the reaction. Thus, like the KIM sequence in MKP3, Asp-319 in ERK2 plays a major role in ERK2 binding to MKP3, but it is not essential for ERK2 induced MKP3 activation. To further define the contribution of ERK2 CD domain to MKP3 binding and activation, we determined the effects of amino acid substitutions in the CD domain using the activation-based assay outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” We chose amino acid residues in the vicinity of Asp-319, based on both primary and tertiary structure. All experiments were performed at pH 7.0, ionic strength of 0.15 m, and 30 °C. As summarized in Table I, the dissociation constant (K d) for ERK2 and MKP3 is 0.17 ± 0.03 μm. No significant effects were observed for ERK2 mutants Q313E, S218D, E324A, and F329L. However, when Tyr-126 and Tyr-314 were replaced by an Ala, the affinity of ERK2/Y126A and ERK2/Y314A for MKP3 was reduced by 20- and 7.8-fold, respectively. When Asp-160 and Asp-316 was replaced by an Asn, the affinity of ERK2/D160N and ERK2/D316N for MKP3 decreased 18- and 9.6-fold, respectively. Substitution of Glu-79 or Arg-133 with an Ala reduced the affinity of ERK2/E79A and ERK2/R133A for MKP3 by 5.7- and 5.1-fold, respectively. Thus, Asp-319 is the most important residue in ERK2 CD domain as large decreases (60–100-fold) in binding affinity were observed when Asp-319 was changed to Ala, Asn, Glu, or Arg. Interestingly, ERK2/E324Q exhibited a 3.7-fold higher affinity for MKP3 than that of the wild-type ERK2. Taken together, our data suggest that the CD site is likely composed of residues Glu-79, Tyr-126, Arg-133, Asp-160, Tyr-314, Asp-316, and Asp-319, which form a contiguous docking surface on the back side of the ERK2 kinase active site (Fig. 1A). It is important to point out that although mutation of CD site residues decreased MKP3 binding affinity, none of them affected the ability of ERK2 to activate MKP3 (Table I).Table IContributions of residues in ERK2 CD site to MKP3 binding and activationERK2MKP3KdMKP3 activationaThis value was calculated as the ratio of maximum MKP3 activity in the presence of saturating amount of mutant versus wild-type ERK2.μ m%Wild typeWild type0.17 ± 0.04100Wild typeR64A1.24 ± 0.2594 ± 5Wild typeR64K0.18 ± 0.0591 ± 5Wild typeR65A25.8 ± 2.294 ± 5Wild typeR65K8.3 ± 1.293 ± 6Wild typeR65D7.8 ± 1.772 ± 7D319NWild type14.8 ± 1.2111 ± 8D319NR65K27.3 ± 4.6116 ± 8D319AWild type18.0 ± 3.383 ± 7D319EWild type9.5 ± 1.086 ± 5D319RWild type11.7 ± 2.772 ± 7D319RR65D15.0 ± 3.8100 ± 8Q313EWild type0.12 ± 0.0494 ± 6Y314AWild type1.33 ± 0.22111 ± 8D316NWild type1.63 ± 0.66106 ± 8S318DWild type0.26 ± 0.0383 ± 5E324AWild type0.25 ± 0.0594 ± 7E324QWild type0.046 ± 0.014104 ± 7F329LWild type0.23 ± 0.0488 ± 5E79AWild type0.97 ± 0.12116 ± 8Y126AWild type3.47 ± 0.84117 ± 8R133AWild type0.87 ± 0.1097 ± 6D160NWild type3.10 ± 0.3977 ± 5a This value was calculated as the ratio of maximum MKP3 activity in the presence of saturating amount of mutant versus wild-type ERK2.

https://openalex.org/W2081736295,"Interferon (IFN)-γ is one of the most important microglia stimulators in vivo participating in inflammation and Th1 activation/differentiation. IFN-γ-mediated signaling involves the activation of the Jak/STAT1 pathway. The neuropeptides vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and the pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) are two potent microglia-deactivating factors that inhibit the production of proinflammatory mediators in vitro and in vivo. The present study investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in the VIP/PACAP regulation of several IFN-γ-induced microglia-derived factors, including IFN-γ-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), and CD40. The results indicate that VIP/PACAP inhibit Jak1–2 and STAT1 phosphorylation, and the binding of activated STAT1 to the IFN-γ activated site motif in the IFN regulatory factor-1 and CD40 promoter and to the IFN-stimulated response element motif of the IP-10 promoter. Through its effect in the IFN-γ-induced Jak/STAT1 pathway, VIP and PACAP are able to control the gene expression of IP-10, CD40, and iNOS, three microglia-derived mediators that play an essential role in several pathologies, i.e. inflammation and autoimmune disorders. The effects of VIP/PACAP are mediated through the specific receptor VPAC1 and the cAMP/protein kinase A transduction pathway. Because IFN-γ is a major stimulator of innate and adaptive immune responses in vivo, the down-regulation of IFN-γ-induced gene expression by VIP and PACAP could represent a significant element in the regulation of the inflammatory response in the central nervous system by endogenous neuropeptides.

Under normal conditions, brain microglia are involved in immune surveillance and host defense against infectious agents (1Dixon D.W. Mattiace L.A. Kure K. Hutchins K. Lyman X. Brosnan C.F. Lab. Invest. 1991; 64: 135-156PubMed Google Scholar). However, in response to brain injury, infection, or inflammation, microglia readily become activated, in a way similar to peripheral tissue macrophages, a process that includes differentiation and probably invasion and proliferation. Activation of microglia is a histopathological hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer and Parkinson's diseases, multiple sclerosis, and the AIDS dementia complex (1Dixon D.W.

Hence, it is important to unravel mechanisms regulating microglia activation of inflamed brain parenchyma to provide insights into efficient therapeutic intervention. IFN-γ constitutes one of the most potent microglia-activating factors. Binding of IFN-γ to its receptor induces the assembly of an active receptor complex and consequent transphosphorylation of the receptor-associated Janus tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak2 (4Darnell J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar, 5Greenlund A.C. Morales M.O. Viviano B.L. Yan H. Krolewski J. Schreiber R.D. Immunity. 1995; 2: 677-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The activation of these kinases induces phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor itself, which lacks intrinsic kinase activity. The cytosolic protein signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT1) is then recruited to the activated IFN-γ-receptor complex and phosphorylated (4Darnell J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation, STAT1 forms homodimers and translocate to the nucleus, where they bind to the IFN-γ-activated site (GAS), also termed STAT binding element (SBE), found in the promoter of many IFN-γ-induced genes including the IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and ICAM-1 genes (6Sims S.H.

Although VIP and PACAP affect a variety of immune functions, their primary immunomodulatory function is anti-inflammatory in nature. VIP has been shown to inhibit cytokine production and proliferation in T cells, and several macrophage functions, including phagocytosis, respiratory burst, and chemotaxis (23Gomariz R.P. Martinez C.

Similarly, we have recently demonstrated that VIP and PACAP act as potent microglia-deactivating factors by inhibiting the production of endotoxin-induced proinflammatory mediators in vitro (26Delgado M.

The inhibition of proinflammatory mediators is responsible, at least partially, for the protective effect of VIP/PACAP in vivo in murine models for septic shock, inflammation-induced neurodegeneration, brain trauma, and Parkinson's disease (28Delgado M.

To further understand the molecular mechanisms through which VIP and PACAP attenuate the inflammatory responses in the central nervous system, we examined the effects of VIP/PACAP on IFN-γ-induced Jak-STAT1 activation and IRF-1 synthesis in murine microglial cells. Our results indicate that VIP/PACAP inhibit Jak1–2/STAT1 phosphorylation, binding of STAT1 to the GAS motif in the IRF-1 promoter, and subsequently, IRF-1 transcription and synthesis. These effects are correlated with an inhibitory effect of VIP/PACAP on IFN-γ-induced CD40, IP-10, and iNOS expression, mediated through the VIP receptor VPAC1 and the cAMP/PKA transduction pathway.

Briefly, cerebral cortical cells from 1-day-old BALB/c mice were dissociated after a 30-min trypsinization (0.25%) and were plated in 75-cm2 Falcon culture flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose formula (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), containing 10 mm HEPES buffer, 1 mm pyruvate, 0.1 m nonessential amino acids, 2 mm glutamine, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin (complete medium). The medium was replenished 1 and 4 days after plating, and on day 8 of culture, plates were shaken for 20 min at a speed of 200 rpm in an orbital shaker to remove oligodendrocytes. On day 12 of culture, plates were shaken again for 2 h at a speed of 180–200 rpm. Harvested cells were filtered through a 20-μm nylon mesh, plated in a 60-mm Petri dish, and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. After extensive washing with culture medium, adherent cells (microglia) were collected with a rubber policeman and centrifuged (1000 rpm, 10 min). Purified microglial cell cultures comprised a cell population in which >98% stained positively with MAC-1 antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and <2% stained positively with antibodies specific to the astrocyte marker glial fibrillary acid protein (Sigma). Microglia monolayers were incubated with complete medium and stimulated with 50 units/ml IFN-γ in the presence or absence of VIP or PACAP38 (from 10–12 to 10–6m) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Cell-free supernatants were harvested at the designated time points and kept frozen (–20 °C) until IP-10 determination. RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blot analysis was performed according to standard methods. Murine primary microglia cells were cultured at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml in 100-mm tissue culture dishes and stimulated with IFN-γ (50 units/ml) in the presence or absence of VIP (10–8m) or PACAP (10–8m) for different time periods at 37 °C. Cells were collected, and total RNA was extracted by the acid guanidinium-phenol-chloroform method, electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gels, transferred to Nytran membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), and cross-linked to the nylon membrane using UV light. The probes for murine IRF-1, GAPDH, and IP-10 were generated by reverse transcription-PCR as previously described (32Miyamoto M. Fujita T. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Harada H. Sudo Y. Miyata T.

The RNA-containing membranes were prehybridized for 16 h at 42 °C and hybridized at 42 °C for 16 h with the appropriate probes. The membranes were washed twice in 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature (20 min each time), once at 37 °C for 20 min, and once in 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 50 °C (20 min). The prehybridization and hybridization buffers were purchased from 5 Prime → 3 Prime Inc. (Boulder, CO). The membranes were exposed to x-ray films (Eastman Kodak Co.). CD40 mRNA expression was determined by RNase protection assay as described previously (34Nguyen V.T. Walker W.S. Benveniste E.N. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2537-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared by the mini-extraction procedure of Schreiber et al. (35Schreiber E. Metthias P. Muller M.M. Shaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, microglia cells were cultured at a density of 107 cells in 6-well plates, stimulated as described above, washed twice with ice-cold PBS plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and harvested from the dishes. Incubation times for the different factors assayed were optimized empirically. The cell pellets were homogenized with 0.4 ml of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm NaN3). After 15 min on ice, Nonidet P-40 was added to a final 0.5% concentration, the tubes were gently vortexed for 15 s, and nuclei were sedimented and separated from cytosol by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 40 s. Pelleted nuclei were washed once with 0.2 ml of ice-cold buffer A, and the soluble nuclear proteins were released by adding 0.1 ml of buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 25% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm NaN3). After incubation for 30 min on ice, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C, the supernatants containing the nuclear proteins were harvested, the protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method, and aliquots were stored at –80 °C for later use in EMSAs.

The oligonucleotides were annealed after incubation for 5 min at 85 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT. Aliquots of 50 ng of the double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by using T4 polynucleotide kinase. For EMSA we used 20,000–50,000 cpm of double-stranded oligonucleotides, corresponding to ∼0.5 ng, per reaction. The binding reaction mixtures (15 μl) were set up containing: 0.5–1 ng of DNA probe, 5 μg of nuclear extract, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), and binding buffer (50 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). The mixtures were incubated on ice for 15 min before adding the probe, followed by another 20 min at room temperature. Samples were loaded onto 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed in TGE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.38 m glycine, and 2 mm EDTA) at 100 V, followed by transfer to Whatman paper, drying under vacuum at 80 °C, and autoradiography. In competition and antibody supershift experiments, the nuclear extracts were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with the specific antibody (1 μg) or competing cold oligonucleotide (50-fold excess) before the addition of the labeled probe. Western Blot Analysis of iNOS—For detection of iNOS by Western blotting, microglia cells (107 cells) were lysed in cold 40 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and lysed by sonication. Thirty micrograms of protein extracts was separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions. After electrophoresis, the gel was electroblotted in Tris-glycine buffer (48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, pH 9.2) containing 40% methanol onto a reinforced nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was blocked with TBS-T buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% milk powder for1hat room temperature, then incubated for an additional 6 h at 4 °C with a monoclonal antibody against iNOS (1:1000) in 5% nonfat milk/TBS-T solution. After washing three times in TBS-T, membranes were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG at 1:2000 dilution. After washing three times in TBS-T for 5 min each, and once in Tris-buffered saline for 5 min, the membrane was drained briefly and subjected to the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). The x-ray films were exposed for 5–20 min. Analysis of STAT1 and Jak1/2 Phosphorylation—The phosphorylation status of Jak1/Jak2 and STAT1 was assessed by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analysis as previously described (38Lucas D.M. Lokuta M.A. McDowell M.A. Doan J.E.S. Paulnock D.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4337-4342PubMed Google Scholar). Cells (107 cells) were lysed in ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA pH 7.4, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS). STAT1 and Jak1/Jak2 molecules were immunoprecipitated by incubation of lysates with polyclonal Abs to STAT1 (10 μg/ml) or Jak1 and Jak2 (10 μg/ml), respectively. Ab-antigen complexes were captured on protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Precipitated proteins were released from the beads by washing in immunoprecipitation buffer (three times) and boiling in SDS sample buffer and then separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% acrylamide resolving gel. Immunoblot analysis using an anti-phosphorylated STAT1 Abs (0.5 μg/ml, for Tyr701 and Ser727 STAT1 analysis) or an Ab specific for phosphotyrosine residues (1 μg/ml, for Jak1 and Jak2 analysis) was done essentially as described above. Following analysis of phosphorylated STAT1, phosphorylated Jak1, and phosphorylated Jak2, the blots were stripped and reprobed with Abs directed to STAT1, Jak1, or Jak2, respectively, as described above. IP-10 ELISA—The amounts of IP-10 present in culture supernatants were determined using a specific sandwich ELISA. Briefly, a capture monoclonal anti-murine IP-10 antibody (clone A 102–6, 2.5 μg/ml) was used for coating, and a biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse IP-10 polyclonal antibody (4 μg/ml) was used for detection. The detection limit for the assay is 15 pg/ml IP-10. Determination of NO Synthase Activity—The NO synthase activity was measured as described (39Delgado M. Munoz-Elias E.J. Gomariz R.P. Ganea D. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4685-4696PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, primary microglia cells were cultured at a density of 107 cells in 6-well plates, stimulated as described above, washed twice with ice-cold PBS plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were lysed by three cycles of freeze/thaw in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 12 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors (0.1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin), and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 60 min. For the NO synthase activity assay, microglia lysates were incubated with 2 mm l-arginine, 2 mm NADPH, 4 μm flavin-adenine dinucleotide, 4 μm tetrahydrobiopterin, 2 mm DTT, and1mm EGTA for2hat37 °C.The reaction was terminated by adding 15 units/ml l-lactic dehydrogenase and 83 mm sodium pyruvate and incubating for an additional 15 min. The amount of NO formed in the reaction mixture was estimated from the accumulation of the stable NO metabolite nitrite by the Griess assay. Equal volumes of culture supernatants and Griess reagents (1% sulfanilamide, 0.1% N-[naphthyl]ethylenediamine dihydrochloride in 2.5% H3PO4) were mixed, and the absorbance was measured at 550 nm. The amount of nitrite was calculated from a NaNO2 standard curve. Determination of CD40 Protein Expression by Immunofluorescence Flow Cytometry—CD40 expression was determined by flow cytometry as previously described (20Nguyen V.T. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23674-23684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, primary microglia were plated at 2 × 105 cells/well into 12-well plates (Costar) and stimulated as described above. The cells were scraped in ice-cold RPMI complete medium and washed twice with PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide plus 2% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (wash buffer). Cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml rat IgG2a-k anti-mouse CD40 Ab (clone 3/23) at 4 °C for 45 min, then washed, and incubated with 10 μg/ml biotinylated anti-rat IgG2a, for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing, the cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin for 30 min at 4 °C. Isotype-matched Abs were used as controls, and IgG block (Sigma) was used to block the nonspecific binding to Fc receptors. After extensive washing, the cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde. Stained microglia cells, gated according to forward and side scatter characteristics, were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Samples in which isotype-matched antibody was used instead of specific antibody were used as negative controls to determine the proper region or window setting. Fluorescence data were expressed as mean fluorescence intensity and as percentage (%) of positive cells after subtraction of background isotype-matched values. VIP and the structurally related neuropeptide PACAP have been lately identified as two potent anti-inflammatory agents, which down-regulate the activation of T cells and macrophages (reviewed in Refs. 21Pozo D.

We studied whether binding of uPAR to α5β1 in cis is involved in adhesion and migration of Chinese hamster ovary cells in response to immobilized uPA. This process was temperature-sensitive and required mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Anti-uPAR antibody or depletion of uPAR blocked, whereas overexpression of uPAR enhanced, cell adhesion to uPA. Adhesion to uPA was also blocked by deletion of the growth factor domain (GFD) of uPA and by anti-GFD antibody, whereas neither the isolated uPA kringle nor serine protease domain supported adhesion directly. Interestingly, anti-α5 antibody, RGD peptide, and function-blocking mutations in α5β1 blocked adhesion to uPA. uPA-induced cell migration also required GFD, uPAR, and α5β1, but α5β1 alone did not support uPA-induced adhesion and migration. Thus, binding of uPA causes uPAR to act as a ligand for α5β1 to induce cell adhesion, intracellular signaling, and cell migration. We demonstrated that uPA induced RGD-dependent binding of uPAR to α5β1 in solution. These results suggest that uPA-induced adhesion and migration of Chinese hamster ovary cells occurs as a consequence of (a) uPA binding to uPAR through GFD, (b) the subsequent binding of a uPA·uPAR complex to α5β1 via uPAR, and (c) signal transduction through α5β1.

Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) 1The abbreviations used are: uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; uPAR, uPA receptor; scuPA, single-chain uPA; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GFD, the growth factor domain; LMW, low molecular weight; mAb, monoclonal antibody: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; scuPA; ATF, amino-terminal fragment; BSA, bovine serum albumin. is a highly restricted serine protease that converts the zymogen plasminogen to the active plasmin. Plasmin, in turn, mediates pericellular proteolysis of extracellular matrix proteins in the path of cellular invasion (1Preissner K.T. Kanse S.M. May A.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 2Ossowski L. Aguirre-Ghiso J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). uPA has also been shown to induce adhesion and chemotactic movement of myeloid cells (3Waltz D.A. Sailor L.Z. Chapman H.A. J.

Reuning U. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These signaling functions of uPA do not require its proteolytic activity. uPA is composed of three independently folded domain structures, growth factor domain (GFD) (residue 1–43), kringle domain (residue 50–131), and serine protease domain (residue 159–411). Enzymatic digestion of uPA by plasmin generates an amino-terminal fragment (ATF) that consists of the GFD and kringle domains and the low molecular weight fragment (LMW-uPA), possessing serine protease activity. uPA binds with high affinity through GFD (10Appella E. Blasi F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1987; 511: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) to a cell-surface receptor (uPAR/CD87) that has been identified in many cell types (1Preissner K.T. Kanse S.M. May A.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). uPAR is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored 35–55-kDa glycoprotein. It is generally accepted that uPA-mediated signaling requires prior binding to uPAR. However, the mechanism by which uPAR mediates signaling events is still to be fully elucidated. A major problem in understanding how uPA signals derives from the fact that uPAR has no transmembrane structure, leading to the proposal that hypothetical transmembrane adapters may be involved in this process (11Resnati M. Guttinger M. Valcamonica S. Sidenius N. Blasi F. Fazioli F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1572-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Among the candidate transmembrane adapters are the integrins, a family of cell adhesion receptor heterodimers that interact with many extracellular matrix and cell-surface ligands (12Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar). At least 18 α and 8 β subunits have been identified. Integrin-ligand interaction is involved in many biological and pathological situations, including cell anchorage and migration, cell-cell interaction during immune response, development, wound healing, vascular remodeling, and cancer metastasis and invasion (13Hynes R.O. Lander A.D. Cell. 1992; 68: 303-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). Integrins transduce signals from outside cells through their interaction with specific ligands. uPAR has been shown to associate with integrins by co-immunocoprecipitation, immunocolocalization, and resonance energy transfer approaches (14Xue W. Kindzelskii A.L. Todd III, R.F. Petty H.R. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4630-4640PubMed Google Scholar, 15Xue W. Mizukami I. Todd III, R.F. Petty H.R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1682-1689PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wei Y. Lukashev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V. Chapman H.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). However, it has not been established whether the association of uPAR with integrins is responsible for uPA-mediated signaling. We have recently reported that recombinant soluble uPAR is a ligand for several β1 and β3 integrins (17Tarui T. Mazar A.P. Cines D.B. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3983-3990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and we postulated that uPAR can transduce signals through the integrin signaling pathway upon binding to integrin in trans. However, it is still unclear whether uPAR binds to integrins as a ligand when both are present on the same membrane (in cis). It has been proposed that integrins “laterally associate” with uPAR (for review, see Ref. 2Ossowski L. Aguirre-Ghiso J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and play a role in uPA·uPAR-initiated signaling events. However, the role of the integrin itself in the uPA·uPAR signaling is unclear, since in the current models other integrin ligands (e.g. fibronectin) appear to be essential for uPA·uPAR signaling (8Aguirre Ghiso J.A. Kovalski K. Ossowski L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 89-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). In this study we designed experiments to identify the role of integrin α5β1 in uPA·uPAR signaling using recombinant uPA fragments and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells overexpressing uPAR or mutant α5β1. We found that cells adhered to immobilized uPA in a signaling-dependent manner. Anti-uPAR antibody, depletion of uPAR, and deletion of the GFD of uPA effectively blocked cell adhesion to uPA, suggesting that binding of uPA to uPAR through GFD is critical for cell adhesion to uPA. Interestingly, anti-α5 antibody, RGD peptide, and function-blocking α5β1 mutations blocked cell adhesion to uPA, suggesting that α5β1 is critical to this process as well. uPA-induced migration of CHO cells also required GFD of uPA, uPAR, and α5β1. We demonstrated that uPA induced RGD-dependent binding of uPAR to α5β1 in solution. These results suggest that uPA-induced signaling in CHO cells involves a process in which (a) uPA binds to uPAR, (b) the uPA·uPAR complex binds to α5β1 as a ligand in cis, and c) signal transduction is initiated through α5β1.

Anti-uPA kringle and anti-LMW uPA mAbs linked to Sepharose 4B were from IKTEK Ltd. (Moscow, Russia). A mAb against soluble uPAR (clone D2D3–813, IgG1κ) was raised against the soluble uPAR D2D3 fragment. Strategic Biosolutions (Newark, DE) generated the ascites and purified the antibody using a 50-ml Amersham Biosciences protein A-Sepharose fast flow column.

Generation of Wild-type uPA and uPA Fragments—cDNA encoding wild-type single-chain uPA (scuPA) was generated and subcloned into pMT/BiP/V5 (Invitrogen) as described previously (22Bdeir K. Kuo A.

The PCR products were digested with BamH1 and XhoI and subcloned into pMT/BiP/V5 at the BglII and XhoI sites. Recombinant proteins were expressed using the Drosophila expression system (Invitrogen) in Schneider S2 cells according to the manufacturer's recommendations.

ATF 1–143 and kringle were purified from S2 medium by affinity chromatography using an anti-kringle uPA mAb immobilized onto Sepharose (IKTEK Ltd.). Synthesis of soluble uPAR (D2D3 form) has been described (17Tarui T. Mazar A.P. Cines D.B. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3983-3990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Adhesion Assays—Adhesion assays were performed as previously described (24Zhang X.P. Kamata T. Yokoyama K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7345-7350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Briefly, wells in 96-well Immulon-2 microtiter plates (Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA) were coated with 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm phosphate buffer, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4) containing substrates at a concentration of 50–1000 nm and were incubated1hat37 °C. Remaining protein binding sites were blocked by incubating with 0.2% BSA (Calbiochem) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells (105 cells/well) in 100 μl of Hepes-Tyrode buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, 2.5 mm KCl, 0.1% glucose, 0.02% BSA) supplemented with 2 mm MgCl2 were added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h unless stated otherwise. After non-bound cells were removed by rinsing the wells with the same buffer, bound cells were quantified by measuring endogenous phosphatase activity (25Prater C.A. Plotkin J. Jaye D. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Antibodies were used at a 250-fold dilution for ascites (KH72 and 135-13C) and at 10 μg/ml for purified antibodies or IgG. Data are shown as means ± S.D. of three independent experiments. We confirmed that equivalent amounts of the fragments and mutants of uPA were coated on the plate by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown). Mitogen-activated Protein Kinases (MAPK) Activation Assay—uPAR-CHO cells were plated into 6-ell tissue culture plates at 2 × 106 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% fetal calf serum, 1× penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine solution and incubated for 2 days at 37 °C in a 95% air, 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. The cell culture media was removed, and the cells were washed once with prewarmed serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells were incubated for 3 h with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with or without the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (500 μm) at 37 °C in a 95% air, 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. The cells were stimulated with different concentrations of soluble scuPA for 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by removing the stimulation media and washing the cells with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm Na3PO4 followed by incubation with 100 μl of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer for 20 min on ice. The whole cell lysate was collected, and the nuclear material was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant from each treatment was retained and stored at –20 °C until required. Whole cell lysates (40 μg of protein) were fractionated using 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting. The membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with blocking buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% BLOTTO; Biorad, Hercules, CA). To determine the phosphorylation changes in MAPK the membranes were washed 3 times for 5 min with wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) in blocking buffer. The blots were washed 3 times for 5 min with wash buffer and probed with a 1:2000 dilution of anti-rabbit horseradish peroxide-conjugated secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) in blocking buffer at room temperature for 1 h. The blots were washed 3 times for 5 min and developed using the Immun-Star horseradish peroxide chemiluminescence substrate kit (Bio-Rad). The blots were stripped by incubating with stripping buffer (0.1 m glycine, pH 2.6, and 2% SDS) for 30 min at 50 °C. The blots were washed 3 times with 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, re-blocked for 1 h at room temperature with blocking buffer, washed 3 times for 5 min, incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-p44/42 MAPK (Cell Signaling Technology) overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer, and processed as above to determine the total MAPK levels of each lane. Migration Assays—Cell migration was analyzed using tissue culture-treated 24-well Transwell plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) with polycarbonate membranes of pore size 8 μm. The lower side of the filter was coated with various concentrations (20–200 nm) of substrates. Coated filters were placed into a serum-free migration buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10 mm Hepes, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 1× penicillin-streptomycin), and cells (100 μl) suspended in the same buffer (8 × 105 cells/ml) were added to the upper chamber. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 20 h. Cells in the upper chamber were removed by wiping, and those that migrated to the lower surface of the filters were fixed and stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% ethanol and counted. The result in each well is the mean cell number of 4 randomly selected high magnification microscopic fields from triplicate experiments. In some experiments, anti-integrin antibodies (10 μg/ml) were incubated with cells for 15 min before to the assay. Co-precipitation of uPAR and Integrin α5β1 1—Soluble uPAR was radioiodinated with Na-125I using Iodo beads (specific activity 14,500 cpm/ng). Purified human α5β1 integrin was obtained from Chemicon International. Purified α5β1 (6 μg/ml), mAb HA5 (9 μg/ml), 125I-labeled soluble uPAR (6 μg/ml), and uPA (12 μg/ml) were incubated with protein G-agarose beads either in the presence or absence of RGD peptide (150 μg/ml) in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.02% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C for 4 h. As a control, experiments were performed in the absence of uPA. Beads were washed 3 times in RPMI supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, 0.02% bovine serum albumin. Bound materials were extracted into reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Other Methods—Flow cytometric analysis and stress-fiber staining were performed as described before (17Tarui T. Mazar A.P. Cines D.B. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3983-3990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 26Takada Y. Puzon W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17597-17601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). uPAR-dependent Cell Adhesion to uPA—It has been reported that CHO cells express endogenous hamster uPAR (17Tarui T. Mazar A.P. Cines D.B. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3983-3990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We detected low level endogenous hamster uPAR on the mock-transfected CHO cells with polyclonal anti-human uPAR antibodies (Fig 1a). Consistent with this finding, mock-transfected CHO cells adhered to immobilized uPA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1c). We transfected CHO cells with cDNA encoding human uPAR and cloned stable cell lines expressing high levels of receptor (designated uPAR-CHO). uPAR-CHO cells express uPAR at a much higher level (Fig. 1b) and showed greater adhesion to uPA than mock-CHO cells (Fig. 1c). Anti-uPAR polyclonal rabbit IgG completely blocked adhesion of uPAR- and mock-transfected CHO cells to uPA (Fig. 1d). To further test whether uPAR is involved in this process, we treated uPAR-CHO cells with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C to remove the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored uPAR. The phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C treatment removed more than 90% of uPAR on the cell surface, as determined by flow cytometry with anti-uPAR (Fig. 1e), and markedly reduced the adhesion of uPAR-CHO cells to uPA (Fig. 1f). These results indicate that adhesion of these CHO cells to immobilized uPA is uPAR-dependent and that the level of adhesion to uPA correlates with the amount of uPAR. We also found that adhesion of uPAR-CHO cells to immobilized uPA occurred at 37 °C, but not at 4 °C, suggesting that this process is temperature-dependent and requires signal transduction (Fig. 2a). It has been reported that uPA induces activation of MAPK (27Nguyen D.H. Hussaini I.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8502-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). An inhibitor to MEK-1 (PD98059) that prevents the activation of MAPK (extracellular signal-regulated kinases1/2) (Fig. 2b) consistently blocked adhesion of uPAR-CHO cells to uPA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2c). These results suggest that this process requires extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation (most likely induced by immobilized uPA). We found that immobilized uPA did not induce spreading or stress-fiber formation in uPAR-CHO cells, in contrast to fibronectin used as a positive control (Fig. 2d). Role of Integrins in uPAR-mediated Adhesion to uPA—It has been proposed that integrins may be critically involved in the uPA·uPAR signaling (2Ossowski L. Aguirre-Ghiso J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). To examine this hypothesis we first determined whether integrins contribute to cell adhesion to uPA. To do so, we tested the effects of anti-integrin mAbs on adhesion of uPAR-CHO cells to uPA. CHO cells have endogenous hamster integrins α5β1, αvβ1, and αvβ5 (data not shown). We found that RGD peptide (100 μm) blocked adhesion of uPAR-CHO cells to uPA, but control RGE peptide did not (Fig. 3a). Consistent with the findings that RGD-dependent integrin(s) is involved in this process, anti-α5 mAb (KH72) completely blocked adhesion of uPAR-CHO to uPA, whereas anti-αvβ5 mAb (P1F6) or control ascites did not (Fig. 3a and data not shown). These results suggest that adhesion of uPAR-CHO cells to immobilized uPA is α5β1-dependent. Then we tested whether the level of α5β1 expression affects cell adhesion to uPA using the B2 variant of CHO cells, which expresses ∼2% of α5β1 compared with parental CHO cells (28Bauer J.S. Schreiner C.L. Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The B2 cells adhered to uPA at a level lower than CHO cells (Fig 3b). This adhesion was completely blocked by anti-uPAR polyclonal antibodies and anti-integrin α5 (data not shown). These results suggest that cell adhesion to uPA is dependent on the level of α5β1 but that a small amount of α5β1 on the B2 cells still supports the adhesion to uPA to some extent. Another possibility is that integrin αvβ1 may also be involved in this process, although we were not able to test this hypothesis since function-blocking anti-hamster αv mAb is not currently available. To test the specific contribution of α5β1 to uPA·uPAR-dependent cell adhesion, we used immobilized anti-uPAR mAb as a uPAR ligand. We found that uPAR-CHO cells adhered to anti-uPAR and that this adhesion was not inhibited by anti-integrin α5 mAb (Fig. 3c), suggesting that α5β1 was not required for this process. Taken together, adhesion of CHO cells to uPA requires uPAR and α5β1, and α5β1 is specifically involved in this process only when uPA is used as a ligand. The Domains of uPA Required for Cell Adhesion to uPA—To identify which uPA domains are involved in uPAR/α5β1-dependent cell adhesion to uPA, we used several uPA fragments including the ATF, the kringle domain, the LMW-uPA, ΔGFD-uPA, which lacks GFD, and ΔKringle-uPA, which lacks the kringle domain (Fig 4a). We found that ATF and ΔKringle-uPA supported cell adhesion at levels comparable with that of wild-type uPA. Kringle, LMW-uPA, or ΔGFD-uPA did not support the adhesion at all (Fig 4b). These results suggest that GFD is primarily involved in cell adhesion to uPA, but other domains are not. As a second approach, we tested whether mAbs to different domains of uPA block cell adhesion to uPA. We found that anti-GFD (AD3471) and anti-kringle mAb (Ab963) blocked adhesion of uPAR-CHO cells to uPA, whereas anti-LMW (UNG-5) did not (Fig 4c). Ab963 has been observed to inhibit the binding of uPA to whole cells despite the fact that its epitope has been mapped to the kringle domain. These results are consistent with the results with uPA fragments (Fig. 4b) with the exception of the effect of the anti-kringle antibody. GFD is required for uPA to bind to uPAR (10Appella E. Blasi F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1987; 511: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Taken together these studies suggest that uPAR/α5β1-mediated cell adhesion to uPA is also critically dependent on the interaction with GFD. Mutations in Integrin α5 Affect Cell Adhesion to uPA—We have recently reported that uPAR is a ligand for several integrins (17Tarui T. Mazar A.P. Cines D.B. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3983-3990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Specifically, soluble uPAR supports integrin-mediated cell adhesion, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked uPAR binds to integrins in apposing cells in trans and supports cell-cell interaction. We have reported that mutations in the ligand binding region of integrin α4 subunit blocked adhesion of α4β1-transfected CHO cells to immobilized soluble uPAR (17Tarui T. Mazar A.P. Cines D.B. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3983-3990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), suggesting that uPAR binds to α4β1 as a ligand. These critical residues are located within the ligand binding site in integrins based on the crystal structure of integrin αvβ3 (29Xiong J.-P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Andrzej J. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar, 30Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar). We suspected that cell adhesion to uPA in the present study involves interaction between uPAR and α5β1 on the same cell surface (in cis). We have reported that similar mutations (the Tyr-186 to Ala (Y186A), F187A, and W188A) in the ligand binding site of α5 blocked fibronectin binding to α5β1 (21Irie A. Kamata T. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5542-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We therefore studied whether uPAR binds to α5β1 as a ligand during adhesion to uPA using these α5 mutants. We first tested the effects of these function-blocking mutations of α5 (21Irie A. Kamata T. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5542-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) on adhesion to soluble uPAR. We used B2 cells expressing wild type and Y186A, F187A, and W188A mutants of integrin α5 (designated α5-B2, α5/Y186A-B2, α5/F187A-B2, and α5/W188A-B2, respectively). Expression levels of integrin α5β1 among those transfectants were comparable as measured by flow cytometry with non-function blocking anti-human α5 mAb (VC-5) (21Irie A. Kamata T. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5542-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). CHO cells, but not B2 cells, bind to coated soluble uPAR upon Mn2+ activation (17Tarui T. Mazar A.P. Cines D.B. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3983-3990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), indicating that α5β1 requires activation to bind to uPAR. We found that α5-B2 cells adhered to soluble uPAR if activated with Mn2+ (Fig 5a) and that the Y186A and W188A mutations completely, and the F187A mutation partially, blocked the adhesion to soluble uPAR. We then tested the effect of these α5 mutations on cell adhesion to uPA. In this experiment we used ATF instead of wild-type uPA to exclude the possible contribution of the serine protease domain because we found that both B2 and α5-B2 cells bind weakly to LMW-uPA when α5β1 is activ"
https://openalex.org/W2032212474,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of nigra dopaminergic neurons. Lewy bodies (LBs) are a characteristic neuronal inclusion in PD brains. In this study, we report that Dorfin, a RING finger-type ubiquityl ligase for mutant superoxide dismutase-1, was localized with ubiquitin in LBs. Recently, synphilin-1 was identified to associate with α-synuclein and to be a major component of LBs. We found that overexpression of synphilin-1 in cultured cells led to the formation of large juxtanuclear inclusions, but showed no cytotoxicity. Dorfin colocalized in these large inclusions with ubiquitin and proteasomal components. In contrast to full-length synphilin-1, overexpression of the central portion of synphilin-1, including ankyrin-like repeats, a coiled-coil domain, and an ATP/GTP-binding domain, predominantly led to the formation of small punctate aggregates scattered throughout the cytoplasm and showed cytotoxic effects. Dorfin and ubiquitin did not localize in these small aggregates. Overexpression of the N or C terminus of synphilin-1 did not lead to the formation of any aggregates. Dorfin physically bound and ubiquitylated synphilin-1 through its central portion, but did not ubiquitylate wild-type or mutant α-synuclein. These results suggest that the central domain of synphilin-1 has an important role in the formation of aggregates and cytotoxicity and that Dorfin may be involved in the pathogenic process of PD and LB formation by ubiquitylation of synphilin-1.

Synphilin-1 was identified recently by yeast two-hybrid techniques as a novel protein that interacts with α-synuclein (31Engelender S. Kaminsky Z. Guo X. Sharp A.H. Amaravi R.K. Kleiderlein J.J. Margolis R.L. Troncoso J.C. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). α-Synuclein amino acids 1–65 are is sufficient for interaction, and the central portion of synphilin-1 (amino acids 349–555) is necessary and sufficient for interaction with α-synuclein (32Neystat M. Rzhetskaya M. Kholodilov N. Burke R.E. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 325: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that the C terminus of α-synuclein is closely associated with the C terminus of synphilin-1 and that a weak interaction occurs between the N terminus of α-synuclein and synphilin-1 (33Kawamata H. McLean P.J. Sharma N. Hyman B.T. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 929-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Synphilin-1 is highly concentrated in presynaptic nerve terminals, and its association with synaptic vesicles is modulated by α-synuclein (34Ribeiro C.S. Carneiro K. Ross C.A. Menezes J.R.

Coexpression of α-synuclein and synphilin-1 in transfected cells results in the formation of eosinophil cytoplasmic inclusions that resemble LBs (31Engelender S. Kaminsky Z. Guo X. Sharp A.H.

Furthermore, synphilin-1 is ubiquitylated and degraded by proteasomes in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells (37Lee G. Junn E. Tanaka M. Kim Y.M. Mouradian M.M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and is localized as another major component of LBs in the brains of patients with PD (38Wakabayashi K. Engelender S. Tanaka Y.

Thus, the process through which aggregations are formed by synphilin-1 may be important in the pathogenesis of PD. Dorfin is a gene product (which we cloned from anterior horn tissues of human spinal cord) (40Niwa J.-i. Ishigaki S. Doyu M. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Sobue G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) that contains a RING finger/IBR (in between RING finger) motif (41Morett E. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 229-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) at its N terminus. It was reported that HHARI (human homologue of ariadne) and H7-AP1 (UbcH7-associated protein-1), both RING finger/IBR motif-containing proteins, interact with the ubiquitin carrier protein (E2) UbcH7 through the RING finger/IBR motif and that a distinct subclass of RING finger/IBR motif-containing proteins represents a new family of proteins that specifically interact with distinct E2 enzymes (42Moynihan T.P. Ardley H.C. Nuber U. Rose S.A. Jones P.F. Markham A.F. Scheffner M. Robinson P.A. J. Biol.

Dorfin is a juxtanuclearly located E3 ubiquityl ligase and may function in the microtubule-organizing centers (40Niwa J.-i. Ishigaki S. Doyu M. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Sobue G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the spinal cords of patients with sporadic and familial forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with an SOD1 mutation, Dorfin is colocalized with ubiquitin in hyaline inclusions (44Niwa J.-i. Ishigaki S. Hishikawa N. Yamamoto M. Doyu M. Murata S. Tanaka K. Taniguchi N. Sobue G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36793-36798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Dorfin physically binds and ubiquitylates various SOD1 mutants derived from familial ALS patients and enhances their degradation (44Niwa J.-i. Ishigaki S. Hishikawa N. Yamamoto M. Doyu M. Murata S. Tanaka K. Taniguchi N. Sobue G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36793-36798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Thus, an important and interesting question is whether Dorfin is colocalized with ubiquitin in LBs of PD. In this study, we show that Dorfin is colocalized with ubiquitin in LBs of PD. We found that Dorfin ubiquitylates synphilin-1 and that overexpression of synphilin-1 leads to ubiquitylated inclusions resembling LBs in cultured cells. Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemical studies were carried out on 20% buffered, Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded autopsied brains filed in the Department of Neurology of the Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine. Five PD brains (67–69 years of age, four men and one woman) and five controls without neurological disease (61–78 years of age, four men and one woman) were studied. The diagnosis of all cases was confirmed by clinical and pathological criteria. Immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (45Hishikawa N. Hashizume Y. Yoshida M. Sobue G. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 2001; 27: 362-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antiserum was raised against a C-terminal portion of Dorfin (amino acid 678–690) as described previously (40Niwa J.-i. Ishigaki S. Doyu M. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Sobue G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Dorfin anti-serum (l:200 dilution) and monoclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody (P4D1, 1:400 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. To assess the colocalization of Dorfin and ubiquitin, a double-labeling immunofluorescence study was performed on selected sections with a combination of anti-Dorfin and anti-ubiquitin antibodies. Anti-Dorfin antibody was visualized by goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled with Alexa Fluor 568 (Molecular Probes, Inc.), and anti-ubiquitin antibody was visualized with sheep anti-mouse IgG coupled with Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and observed under a Carl Zeiss LSM-510 laser scanning confocal microscope. For cultured cells, immunostaining was performed as follows. COS-7 cells transiently expressing synphilin-1-DsRed fusion protein in a 4-chamber slide (Nalge Nunc) coated with rat tail collagen (Roche Diagnostics) were fixed with methanol at –20 °C for 10 min, air-dried, and blocked with 5% goat serum for 30 min. Cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate primary antibody diluted in phosphate-buffered saline. After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution; Molecular Probes, Inc.) was added for1hat room temperature. Samples were visualized under an Olympus BX51 epif-luorescence microscope. Primary antibodies against ubiquitin (P4D1, 1:200 dilution), Hsp70 (heat shock protein of 70 kDa; 1:5000 dilution; Stressgen Biotech Corp.), the 20 S proteasome core subunit (1:5000 dilution; Affiniti), and UbcH7 (1:100 dilution; Transduction Laboratories) were used. Expression Plasmids, Cell Culture, and Transfection—Human synphilin-1 cDNA containing the entire coding region was amplified by Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) from human brain cDNAs using 5′-GTCAGGATCCACCACCATGGAAGCCCCTGAATACC-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-ATATCTCGAGTGCTGCCTTATTCTTTCCTTTG-3′ as the reverse primer and inserted in-frame into the BamHI and XhoI sites of the pcDNA3.1/V5His vector (Invitrogen). A plasmid for DsRed-tagged synphilin-1 was constructed by PCR amplification using 5′-ATATCTCGAGACCACCATGGAAGCCCCTGAATACC-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-GTCAGGATCCGCCTTTGCCTTATTCTTTCCTTTG-3′ as the reverse primer and inserted in-frame into the XhoI and BamHI sites of the pDsRed-N1 vector (Clontech). A series of deletion mutants of synphilin-1 were prepared as synphilin-1-N (amino acid 1–348), synphilin-1-M (amino acid 349–555), and synphilin-1-C (amino acid 556–919). Synphilin-1-M is the central portion of synphilin-1, containing the ankyrin-like repeat, the coiled-coil domain, and the ATP/GTP-binding domain (31Engelender S. Kaminsky Z. Guo X. Sharp A.H. Amaravi R.K. Kleiderlein J.J. Margolis R.L. Troncoso J.C. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Primers pairs for each deletion mutant were as follows: 5′-GTCAGGATCCACCACCATGGAAGCCCCTGAATACC-3′ and 5′-ATATCTCGAGTTCGTCGTGAATTTTGTCT-3′ for synphilin-1-N-V5, 5′-ATATCTCGAGACCACCATGGAAGCCCCTGAATACC-3′ and 5′-GTCAGGATCCGCTTCGTCGTGAATTTTGTCTAG-3′ for synphilin-1-N-DsRed, 5′-GTCAGGATCCACCATGAATGGAAACAATCTAT-3′ and 5′-ATATCTCGAGCTTGCCCTCTGATTTCTGG-3′ for synphilin-1-M-V5, 5′-ATATCTCGAGACCACCATGAATGGAAACAATCTAT-3′ and 5′-GTCAGGATCCGCC TTGCCCTCTGATTTCTGGGC-3 for synphilin-1-M-DsRed, 5′-GTCAGGATCCACCACCATGTCACTCCCTTCTTCAC-3′ and 5′-ATATCTCGAGTGCTGCCTTATTCTTTCCTTTG-3′ for synphilin-1-C-V5, and 5′-ATATCTCGAGACCACCATGTCACTCCCTTCTTCAC-3′ and 5′-GTCAGGATCCGCCTTTGCCTTATTCTTTCCTTTG-3′ for synphilin-1-C-DsRed. Construction of pcDNA4/His-Max-Dorfin, pcDNA3.1(+)FLAG-ubiquitin, and pcDNA3.1/MycHis(+)-SOD1 vectors was described elsewhere (40Niwa J.-i. Ishigaki S. Doyu M. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Sobue G. Biochem.

To generate the mutant α-synuclein expression vector, A30P and A53T mutations were introduced into pcDNA3.1/MycHis(+)-α-synuclein with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the method of Lee et al. (46Lee M. Hyun D. Halliwell B. Jenner P. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 998-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). COS-7, HEK293, and Neuro2a cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed using the Effectene transfection reagent (QIAGEN Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To inhibit cellular proteasome activity, cells were treated with 0.5 μm MG132 (carbobenzoxy-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinal, Sigma) for 16 h overnight after transfection. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS) with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Immunoprecipitation from transfected cell lysates was performed with 2 μg of antibody and protein A/G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the immunoprecipitate was then washed four times with lysis buffer. Anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) for synphilin-1-V5 fusion proteins and anti-Myc antibody (A-14, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for α-synuclein-Myc or SOD1-Myc fusion proteins were used. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Ubiquitylation Assay—Immunopurified (IP) Xpress-Dorfin bound to anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen) with protein A/G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was prepared from lysates of HEK293 cells transfected with pcDNA4/HisMax-Dorfin. IP-synphilin-1-V5 was prepared with anti-V5 antibody bound to protein A/G Plus-agarose from lysates of HEK293 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1/V5His-synphilin-1. IP-α-synuclein-Myc and IP-SOD1-Myc were prepared with anti-Myc antibodies from lysates of pcDNA3.1/MycHis(+)-α-synuclein- and pcDNA3.1/MycHis(+)-SOD1-transfected HEK293 cells, respectively. Slurries of IP-Xpress-Dorfin were mixed with IP-synphilin-1-V5, IP-α-synuclein-Myc, or IP-SOD1-Myc and incubated at 30 °C for 90 min in 50 μl of reaction buffer containing ATP (4 mm ATP in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol), 100 ng of rabbit E1 (Calbiochem), 2 μg of UbcH7 (Affiniti), and 2 μg of His-ubiquitin (Calbiochem). The reaction was terminated by adding 20 μl of 4× sample buffer, and 20-μl aliquots of the reaction mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with anti-His antibody (Novagen). Neurotoxicity Analysis and Quantification of Synphilin-1 Aggregates—COS-7 cells (1 × 104) were grown overnight on collagen-coated 4-chamber well slides. They were transfected with 0.2 μg of pDsRed-N1-synphilin-1 or its deletion mutants. To inhibit cellular proteasome activity, cells were treated with 0.5 μm MG132 for 16 h overnight after transfection. The number of inclusions was counted in >100 cells randomly selected, and data were averaged from three independent experiments. For cell viability assay, 5 × 103 Neuro2a cells were grown in collagen-coated 96-well plates overnight. They were then transfected with 0.1 μg of pcDNA3.1/V5His-synphilin-1 or deletion mutants of synphilin-1. pcDNA3.1/V5His-LacZ was used as a control. Next, an MTS-based cell proliferation assay was performed using CellTiter 96 (Promega) at 24 h after serum deprivation. The assay was carried out in triplicate. Absorbance at 490 nm was measured in a multiple plate reader. Dorfin Localizes to LBs of PD—We first examined whether LBs contain Dorfin. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that Dorfin was predominantly localized in LBs found in PD (Fig. 1A). The peripheral rim of a typical LB in a neuronal cell body was strongly stained, whereas the central core remained unstained (Fig. 1B). Dorfin was also localized in Lewy neurites (Fig. 1C), which are a pathological hallmark in addition to LBs of degenerating neurons in the brains of patients suffering from PD (47Braak H. Sandmann-Keil D. Gai W. Braak E. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 265: 67-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Anti-Dorfin antibody did not stain any abnormal structures in normal brains (data not shown). A double-labeling immunofluorescence study revealed that Dorfin was colocalized with ubiquitin in LBs (Fig. 1, D–F). Serial sections stained with anti-Dorfin and anti-ubiquitin antibodies showed that ∼90% of ubiquitylated LBs were positive for Dorfin immunoreactivity. The staining profile of Dorfin was very similar to that of α-synuclein (48Takahashi H. Wakabayashi K. Neuropathology. 2001; 21: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which is predominantly located in the peripheral rim of LBs, but was different from that of parkin, which localizes predominantly in the core of LBs (49Schlossmacher M.G. Frosch M.P. Gai W.P. Medina M. Sharma N. Forno L. Ochiishi T. Shimura H. Sharon R. Hattori N. Langston J.W. Mizuno Y. Hyman B.T. Selkoe D.J. Kosik K.S. Am. J.

Expression of Synphilin-1 Induces LB-like Large Juxtanuclear Inclusions, and Dorfin Localizes to These Inclusions— To investigate the relationships of Dorfin to components of LBs other than ubiquitin, we first examined the subcellular localization of α-synuclein and synphilin-1 in cultured cells. We created wild-type and mutant α-synuclein-green fluorescent protein and α-synuclein-Myc fusion constructs, but there was no evidence of α-synuclein aggregation in transfected COS-7 cells in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor (data not shown). We created a synphilin-1-DsRed fusion construct by fusing the red fluorescent protein DsRed to the C terminus of synphilin-1 and carried out transient transfection in COS-7 cells with this construct. Large juxtanuclear inclusions were spontaneously formed in the transfected COS-7 cells in the absence of the proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 2, A–O). We also constructed synphilin-1 fusion proteins with a smaller V5/His6 tag, which formed identical inclusions when overexpressed in COS-7 cells, although to a lesser extent than synphilin-1-DsRed fusion proteins (data not shown). Immunostaining with anti-ubiquitin and anti-Dorfin antibodies revealed that most of the large juxtanuclear inclusions of synphilin-1 contained ubiquitin (Fig. 2, A–C) and Dorfin (D–F). Immunohistochemical studies of human LBs have previously shown that LBs are stained with proteasome subunits (6Iwatsubo T. Yamaguchi H. Fujimuro M. Yokosawa H. Ihara Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1517-1529PubMed Google Scholar) and molecular chaperones such as Hsp40 and Hsp70 (24Auluck P.K. Chan H.Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Bonini N.M. Science. 2002; 295: 865-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Thus, we next examined whether the inclusion bodies in COS-7 cells contain the 20 S proteasome core subunit and Hsp70. We found both the 20 S proteasome subunit and Hsp70 to be colocalized with synphilin-1 inclusion bodies (Fig. 2, G–L). Dorfin binds specifically to UbcH7 as an E2 through the RING finger/IBR domain (40Niwa J.-i. Ishigaki S. Doyu M. Suzuki T. Tanaka K. Sobue G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). UbcH7 was also localized with Dorfin in these inclusions (Fig. 2, M–O). These observations suggest that large juxtanuclear inclusions formed by synphilin-1 in our cell culture system have many characteristic features of LBs, that synphilin-1 can aggregate when overexpressed, and that this process may be associated with its ubiquitylation. Expression of the Central Portion of Synphilin-1 Induces Large Juxtanuclear Inclusions as Full-length Proteins, but Small Punctate Aggregates Are Also Formed—To further analyze which part of synphilin-1 is related to aggregation formation, we prepared a series of deletion mutants of synphilin-1. We divided synphilin-1 into three parts, the N terminus of synphilin-1 (synphilin-1-N) containing amino acids 1–348, the central portion of synphilin-1 (synphilin-1-M) containing amino acids 349–555, and the C terminus of synphilin-1 (synphilin-1-C) containing amino acids 556–919, and fused them to DsRed at their C termini (Fig. 3, A and B). Inclusions were not seen with overexpression of DsRed alone, synphilin-1-N, or synphilin-1-C in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3, C–E). However, expression of synphilin-1-M resulted in the production of two types of inclusions: large juxtanuclear inclusions (Fig. 3, F–K) and small punctate aggregates scattered throughout the cytoplasm (L–Q). The large inclusions were stained with ubiquitin (Fig. 3, F–H) and Dorfin (I–K), as were inclusions induced by full-length synphilin-1. However, neither ubiquitin nor Dorfin was colocali"
https://openalex.org/W2063677938,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein (LBP) is an acute phase reactant that may play a dual role in vivo, both potentiating and decreasing cell responses to bacterial LPS. Whereas low concentrations of LBP potentiate cell stimulation by transferring LPS to CD14, high LBP concentrations inhibit cell responses to LPS. One inhibitory mechanism involves the ability of LBP to neutralize LPS by transferring it to plasma lipoproteins, whereas other inhibitory mechanisms, such as the one described here, do not require exogenous lipoproteins. Here we show that LBP can inhibit monocyte responses to LPS that has already bound to membrane-bound CD14 (mCD14) on the cell surface. LBP caused rapid dissociation of LPS from mCD14 as measured by the ability of LBP to inhibit cross-linking of a radioiodinated, photoactivatable LPS derivative to mCD14. Whereas LBP removed up to 75% of the mCD14-bound LPS in 10 min, this was not accompanied by extensive release of the LPS from the cells. The cross-linking data suggest that much of the LPS that remained bound to the cells was associated with LBP. The ability of LBP to inhibit cell responses could not be explained by its effect on LPS internalization, because LBP did not significantly increase the internalization of the cell-bound LPS. In cell-free LPS cross-linking experiments, LBP inhibited the transfer of LPS from soluble CD14 to soluble MD-2. Our data support the hypothesis that LBP can inhibit cell responses to LPS by inhibiting LPS transfer from mCD14 to the Toll-like receptor 4-MD-2 signaling receptor. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein (LBP) is an acute phase reactant that may play a dual role in vivo, both potentiating and decreasing cell responses to bacterial LPS. Whereas low concentrations of LBP potentiate cell stimulation by transferring LPS to CD14, high LBP concentrations inhibit cell responses to LPS. One inhibitory mechanism involves the ability of LBP to neutralize LPS by transferring it to plasma lipoproteins, whereas other inhibitory mechanisms, such as the one described here, do not require exogenous lipoproteins. Here we show that LBP can inhibit monocyte responses to LPS that has already bound to membrane-bound CD14 (mCD14) on the cell surface. LBP caused rapid dissociation of LPS from mCD14 as measured by the ability of LBP to inhibit cross-linking of a radioiodinated, photoactivatable LPS derivative to mCD14. Whereas LBP removed up to 75% of the mCD14-bound LPS in 10 min, this was not accompanied by extensive release of the LPS from the cells. The cross-linking data suggest that much of the LPS that remained bound to the cells was associated with LBP. The ability of LBP to inhibit cell responses could not be explained by its effect on LPS internalization, because LBP did not significantly increase the internalization of the cell-bound LPS. In cell-free LPS cross-linking experiments, LBP inhibited the transfer of LPS from soluble CD14 to soluble MD-2. Our data support the hypothesis that LBP can inhibit cell responses to LPS by inhibiting LPS transfer from mCD14 to the Toll-like receptor 4-MD-2 signaling receptor.

Whereas LPS recognition benefits the host by sensing the presence of bacteria and mobilizing defense mechanisms, an exaggerated response to LPS may contribute to the harmful sequelae of severe sepsis, which include coagulation disorders, organ failure, shock, and death. The host, therefore, has numerous mechanisms that down-regulate responses to LPS and remove it from the circulation and tissues (1Bohuslav J. Kravchenko V.V. Parry G.C. Erlich J.H. Gerondakis S.

CD14 presents LPS to Tlr4, presumably by transferring the LPS to MD-2, an accessory protein that is constitutively associated with the extracellular domain of Tlr4 (16Shimazu R. Akashi S. Ogata H.

Direct evidence of LPS binding to Tlr4/MD-2 was provided by LPS cross-linking experiments in cells that overexpressed these proteins (22Correia J.D. Soldau K. Christen U. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21129-21135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). LBP and sCD14 can both potentiate and down-regulate responses to LPS. sCD14 was originally described as an LPS inhibitor (23Schütt C. Schilling T. Kruger C. Allerg. Immunol. (Leipz.). 1991; 37: 159-164PubMed Google Scholar), and other studies have described inhibitory effects of high concentrations of sCD14 under various conditions (24Haziot A. Rong G.-W. Bazil V.

Immunol. 1996; 156: 4384-4390PubMed Google Scholar). Recent work from our laboratory has shown that in plasma, sCD14 decreases monocyte responses to LPS by transferring cell-bound LPS to plasma lipoproteins (26Kitchens R.L. Thompson P.A. Viriyakosol S. O'Keefe G.E. Munford R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). LBP can prevent lethal shock caused by LPS or Gram-negative bacteria when administered intraperitoneally in mice (27Lamping N. Dettmer R. Schröder N.W. Pfeil D. Hallatschek W. Burger R. Schumann R.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2065-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). High acute phase concentrations of LBP in the plasma of septic humans decrease monocyte responses to LPS (28Zweigner J. Gramm H.J. Singer O.C. Wegscheider K. Schumann R.R. Blood. 2001; 98: 3800-3808Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The inhibitory mechanism of LBP can be explained in part by its ability to neutralize the bioactivity of LPS by transferring it to plasma lipoproteins (6Vesy C.J. Kitchens R.L. Wolfbauer G. Albers J.J. Munford R.S. Infect. Immun. 1999; 68: 2410-2417Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 29Wurfel M.M. Kunitake S.T. Lichenstein H. Kane J.P. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Other inhibitory mechanisms are suggested by the ability of LBP to inhibit cell responses to LPS in serum-free medium (27Lamping N. Dettmer R. Schröder N.W. Pfeil D. Hallatschek W. Burger R. Schumann R.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2065-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 28Zweigner J. Gramm H.J. Singer O.C. Wegscheider K. Schumann R.R. Blood. 2001; 98: 3800-3808Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Possible mechanisms might include the formation of large LPS·LBP complexes that are internalized by mCD14 but that contribute little to LPS signaling (30Gegner J.A. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5320-5326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Here we report that LBP can inhibit LPS signaling even after LPS monomers have bound to mCD14. Reagents and Cells—Recombinant human LBP (C-terminal His tag) was expressed in a baculovirus system in SF-9 cells in SF-900 II SFM (Invitrogen). The protein was purified to homogeneity on a His-Trap™ nickel column (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinant human sCD14 and soluble MD-2 (sMD-2) were produced by baculovirus expression as previously described (17Viriyakosol S. Tobias P.S. Kitchens R.L. Kirkland T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38044-38051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kitchens R.L. Thompson P.A. Viriyakosol S. O'Keefe G.E. Munford R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins did not stimulate cells when added alone at the indicated concentrations. THP-1 cells (provided by LiWu Li, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, NC) were cultured in 0.05 μm 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3) for 3–4 days to induce mCD14 expression (THP-1 (VD3)). In experiments in which IL-1β was used as an agonist, the cells were cultured in 10–6m prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) during the last 24 h of culture in VD3 (THP-1 (VD3-PGE2)). PGE2 and VD3 induced responsiveness of the cells to IL-1β without inhibiting responsiveness to LPS. In some experiments (Figs. 3 and 4B), mCD14 expression was enhanced by stable transfection of THP-1 cells with human CD14 cDNA as previously described (31Kitchens R.L. Wang P.-Y. Munford R.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5534-5545PubMed Google Scholar), and the cells were also differentiated by culturing them in VD3 as described above. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from normal human blood as previously described (26Kitchens R.L. Thompson P.A. Viriyakosol S. O'Keefe G.E. Munford R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) with the approval of the Institutional Review Board of UT Southwestern Medical Center. HEK 293 cells (ATCC) were transiently transfected with human CD14 cDNA (pRcRSV-CD14) (31Kitchens R.L. Wang P.-Y. Munford R.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5534-5545PubMed Google Scholar) using Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science). Anti-human CD14 monoclonal antibodies, 60bca and 63D3, were purified from the culture supernatants of hybridomas obtained from the ATCC. 60bca was covalently bound to agarose beads using Carbolink™ from Pierce. Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-human LBP antibody, K1970602, was a gift of XOMA Corp. (Berkeley, CA). IgG fractions of goat polyclonal antibodies to recombinant human soluble CD14 (number 4-2051-5) and recombinant human LBP (number 4-1855-9) were produced in the Tobias laboratory. Peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG was obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA). All other reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise stated.Fig. 4LBP can remove cell-bound LPS from mCD14. 125I-ASD-LPS was bound to CD14-transfected HEK 293 cells (A) or CD14-transfected THP-1 (VD3) cells (B) by incubating the cells with preformed 125I-ASD·LPS·sCD14 complexes (120–200 ng of LPS/ml) for 3 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed and incubated for 10 min in SFM or in SFM containing 3 μg/ml rLBP (SFM + LBP) and were then exposed to UV light to induce cross-linking of the 125I-ASD·LPS to protein. The cells were then washed, lysates were prepared, and mCD14 (CD14 i.p.) and LBP (LBP i.p.) were sequentially immunoprecipitated from the lysates. The immunoprecipitated 125I-proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the radioactivity in the CD14 and LBP bands was quantitated by phosphor imaging. To measure the inhibitory effect of LBP, the average CD14 radioactivity in lanes 3 and 4 is expressed as the percentage of the average CD14 radioactivity in lanes 1 and 2. The experiments were repeated twice with similar results. Similar results were obtained when mCD14 was immunoprecipitated with an antibody (63D3) that binds to a different CD14 epitope (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) LPS—[3H]LPS was biosynthetically labeled in the fatty acyl chains in Escherichia coli LCD25 (Ra chemotype) (32Munford R.S. DeVeaux L.C. Cronan Jr., J.E. Rick P.D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 148: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). 125I-ASD-LPS was made by derivatization of RcLPS (Salmonella minnesota R5) with sulfosuccinimidyl-2-[p-azidosalicylamido]ethyl-1–3′-dithiopropionate (SASD) (Pierce), a cleavable, photoactivatable cross-linker, as previously described (33Kitchens R.L. Munford R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9904-9910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The stimulatory activity of the 125I-ASD-LPS was tested in THP-1 (VD3) cells and found to be similar to that of the underivatized RcLPS. Each LPS preparation stimulated cytokine production at threshold concentrations of 0.03–0.1 ng of LPS/ml in the presence of LBP (0.1 μg/ml) or as preformed LPS-sCD14 complexes (data not shown). Fluorescent LPS (Alexa Fluor488™-LPS derived from E. coli 055:B5 LPS) was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR) and is referred to here as Alexa-LPS. Protein contamination was not found in any of the LPS preparations on silver-stained SDS-PAGE gels. LPS-Cell Binding and Stimulation—LPS-cell binding was performed in the absence of LBP using preformed LPS·sCD14 complexes (34Kitchens R.L. Munford R.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1920-1928PubMed Google Scholar). For cell stimulation assays, the cells (7 × 105 cells/0.1 ml) were incubated with LPS-sCD14 at 1 ng of LPS/ml for 2 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed in cold RPMI 1640 medium to remove unbound LPS and were incubated in serum-free medium (SFM) (RPMI 1640, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing the indicated proteins for 2 h at 37 °C with brief mixing at 2-min intervals. Cytokines were measured in culture supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). The cell-bound LPS stimulated the production of ∼44 ng of IL-8/ml, 5.5 ng of tumor necrosis factor-α/ml, and 1.7 ng of IL-1β/ml during 2-h incubations, whereas unstimulated cells produced less than 2% of those cytokine levels. The release of cell-bound [3H]LPS was measured by incubating the cells with 100 ng/ml [3H]LPS in LPS·sCD14 complexes for 2–5 min at 37 °C, washing with cold SFM to remove unbound LPS, and incubating the cells in SFM at 37 °C for the indicated times. Released and cell-associated [3H]LPS were measured as previously described (35Kitchens R.L. Wolfbauer G. Albers J.J. Munford R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34116-34122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). LPS internalization was measured by protease protection of [3H]LPS and by surface quenching of fluorescent LPS with trypan blue as previously described (31Kitchens R.L. Wang P.-Y. Munford R.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5534-5545PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kitchens R.L. Munford R.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1920-1928PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cell surface-bound [3H]LPS was removed by incubating the cells in 0.02% proteinase K for 30 min at 4 °C, or the fluorescence of cell surface-bound Alexa-LPS was quenched by suspending the cells in trypan blue and measuring the mean fluorescence intensity by flow cytometry using a FACScan™ (BD Biosciences). In LPS cross-linking experiments, 125I-ASD-LPS was prebound to rsCD14, the mixture was then incubated in SFM with the indicated soluble proteins or with cells at 37 °C, and the mixtures were then exposed to UV light to covalently cross-link the 125I moiety to the associated proteins. After cross-linking the LPS to cellular proteins, the cells (∼4 × 106 cells/0.5 ml) were washed and lysed in 50 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm octyl glucoside, 5 mm iodoacetamide, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin A, leupeptin, and aprotinin) for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged to remove insoluble material. CD14 and LBP were immunoprecipitated sequentially by incubating the lysate supernatants with 12 μl of 60bca-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C with brief agitation (3 s) at 2-min intervals in an Eppendorf Thermomixer™ (Brinkmann Instruments). After removing the beads, LBP was immunoprecipitated from the lysates by incubating them with 2 μg of rabbit anti-human LBP for 1 h followed by 12 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h as described above. The beads were then washed and eluted in SDS sample buffer as previously described (33Kitchens R.L. Munford R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9904-9910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). After reductive cleavage of LPS from the ASD group with dithiothreitol, the 125I-proteins were separated on 11% SDS-PAGE gels. 125I radioactivity was quantitated by exposing the dried gel to a phosphor screen and measuring the radioactivity in a Cyclone PhosphorImager System (Packard Instrument Co.). Background activity, defined by equally sized control areas of the gel, was subtracted using the software provided by the manufacturer. In experiments in which LPS was cross-linked to soluble proteins, autoradiography was performed by exposing the gels to x-ray film. To test the specificity of the immunoprecipitations, CD14 and LBP were immunoprecipitated as described above using specific antibodies or control antibodies (an irrelevant isotype-matched (IgG1) mAb bound to beads or nonimmune rabbit IgG and protein A-Sepharose, respectively). After separating the proteins by SDS-PAGE, they were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were blocked with 1% fish gelatin in PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20, and the proteins were detected with goat anti-human CD14 (7 μg/ml) or goat anti-human LBP (3 μg/ml) followed by peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG. The blots were developed with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to x-ray film. The CD14 and LBP bands were found at their expected molecular sizes (∼55 and 60 kDa, respectively), whereas no bands were detected in control antibody immunoprecipitates (data not shown). To determine whether LBP can inhibit cell responses after LPS-mCD14 binding has occurred, we incubated LPS-sCD14 complexes with mCD14-expressing THP-1 cells for 2 min at 37 °C. We previously found that nearly maximal binding of LPS monomers to mCD14 occurs under these incubation conditions (34Kitchens R.L. Munford R.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1920-1928PubMed Google Scholar). After washing to remove unbound LPS, we found that incubating the cells with LBP inhibited cytokine production. As shown in Fig. 1, 50% inhibition of cytokine production occurred at LBP concentrations of 1–2 μg/ml. In experiments not shown, LBP also inhibited responses to cell-bound LPS in normal human monocytes in peripheral blood mononuclear cell mixtures with similar potency. Because the LPS receptor (Tlr4) and the IL-1 receptor use many of the same intracellular signaling proteins to induce the expression of inflammatory cytokine genes, we stimulated the cells with IL-1β to test whether the inhibitory effect of LBP is LPS-specific. As shown in Table I, the cells produced cytokines in response to both LPS and IL-1β, and LBP inhibited responses only to LPS.Table ILBP does not inhibit cell responses to IL-1βTNFαIL-8Cytokine content% of CtrlCytokine content% of Ctrlng/ml%ng/ml%Prebound LPS2.96 ± 0.0739.2 ± 1.0Prebound LPS + LBP0.74 ± 0.1825 ± 614.1 ± 1.036 ± 2IL-1β4.30 ± 0.1043.3 ± 1.6IL-1β + LBP4.00 ± 0.1293 ± 0.342.6 ± 1.599 ± 7 Open table in a new tab As shown in Fig. 2, LBP had its strongest inhibitory effect when added immediately after LPS-cell binding, and delaying the addition of LBP caused a progressive loss of its ability to inhibit the responses. Under the conditions of our 2-h incubation, LBP measurably inhibited IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-α production when its addition was delayed for up to 30 min, and it inhibited IL-1β production when added up to 1 h after LPS-cell binding had occurred. We next asked whether LBP could enhance the release or internalization of cell-bound LPS. LPS binding and internalization were measured by two independent methods (31Kitchens R.L. Wang P.-Y. Munford R.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5534-5545PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kitchens R.L. Munford R.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1920-1928PubMed Google Scholar). In the first (Fig. 3A), cell surface-bound [3H]LPS was measured by the ability of proteinase K to release the [3H]LPS from the cells. Protection of cell-associated [3H]LPS from proteolytic release may either reflect its internalization or its transfer to a protease-resistant site on the cell surface. Therefore, we use a second method in which the binding and internalization of a fluorescent derivative of LPS were measured by flow cytometry; trypan blue was used to quench the fluorescence of the surface-exposed LPS (Fig. 3B). The results showed that whereas LBP slightly increased the release of LPS from the cells, most of the LPS remained associated with the cells after they were exposed to 3 μg/ml of LBP, an LBP concentration that produced a 60–75% inhibition of the cell response (Fig. 1 and Table I). Whereas the LBP-induced reduction of cell-associated Alexa-LPS (Fig. 3B) was greater than that of [3H]LPS (Fig. 3A), it is unclear whether more Alexa-LPS was actually released from the cells or whether the binding of LBP to the cell-associated Alexa-LPS caused a slight reduction in its fluorescence intensity. In any case, LBP did not significantly increase the rate of release of cell-associated Alexa-LPS except at the earliest time point. Also shown in Fig. 3, LBP did not significantly increase the internalization of cell-bound LPS. To determine whether the cell-associated LPS remained bound to mCD14 after the cells were incubated with LBP, we derivatized LPS with a radioiodinatable, photoactivatable cross-linker (SASD) and measured the effect of LBP on the ability of cell-bound 125I-ASD-LPS to cross-link to mCD14. The results shown in Fig. 4 suggest that LBP dramatically increased the dissociation of cell-bound 125I-ASD-LPS from mCD14 in both CD14-transfected HEK 293 cells and THP-1 cells. The ability of LBP to remove LPS from mCD14 occurred rapidly; 60% inhibition of cross-linking occurred after the cells were incubated with LBP for 5 min (data not shown), and 64–75% inhibition occurred after 10 min (Fig. 4). Immunoprecipitation of LBP from lysates of the LBP-treated cells revealed that a significant amount of cell-bound LPS was associated with LBP (Fig. 4). No labeled protein band was immunoprecipitated from cells that were not incubated with LBP (data not shown). The specificities of the immunoprecipitations were demonstrated by Western blotting (see “Experimental Procedures”). In other experiments not shown, we confirmed that the 125I-labeled CD14 immunoprecipitates were not derived from sCD14 that may have bound to the cells. When we cross-linked 125I-ASD-LPS to sCD14 and ran this product on the gel beside the 125I-labeled immunoprecipitate from the cell lysate, the 125I-sCD14 was smaller (∼46 kDa) than the 125I-mCD14 band (∼55 kDa), as expected. We could not measure LPS binding to MD-2 and Tlr4, which are present in very low abundance on the cell surface. We therefore used soluble recombinant proteins in a cell-free assay to measure the impact of LBP on the transfer of 125I-ASD-LPS from CD14 to MD-2. As shown in Fig. 5, sCD14 (lane 1) transferred LPS to sMD-2 (lane 2). LBP inhibited LPS transfer from sCD14 to sMD-2 (lanes 3 and 4) in keeping with the previous finding that LBP can inhibit the binding of free LPS to sMD-2 (17Viriyakosol S. Tobias P.S. Kitchens R.L. Kirkland T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38044-38051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When LBP was added after LPS had already been transferred to sMD-2 (lanes 5 and 6), LBP removed a significant amount of the LPS from sMD-2 (lanes 7 and 8). Taken together, our data support the hypothesis that LBP may inhibit the transfer of LPS from mCD14 to the Tlr4-MD-2 signaling receptor. Our data reveal a new mechanism by which LBP can inhibit cell responses to LPS. LBP rapidly removed up to 75% of cell-bound LPS from mCD14 (Fig. 4) and a significant amount of LPS from MD-2 (Fig. 5), suggesting that LBP attenuates signal responses by interfering with LPS interactions with the extracellular domains of mCD14 and the Tlr4·MD-2 receptor complex. Whereas our data show that LBP promoted some release of the cell-associated LPS into the medium (Fig. 3), it seems unlikely that this low percentage of LPS release could account for the strong inhibitory effect. The ability of LBP to rapidly and almost completely remove cell-bound LPS from mCD14 provides a more likely explanation for the impact of LBP on cellular responses. Our data also suggest that a significant amount of the cell-bound LPS forms a complex with LBP that remains associated with the cells. It is unclear if the LPS·LBP complexes remain bound to mCD14 or if they move to another membrane location. If the complexes remain associated with mCD14, their inability to stimulate the cells is consistent with the previous finding that most ternary LPS·LBP·mCD14 complexes do not trigger signal responses and are eventually internalized (30Gegner J.A. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5320-5326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). If the LPS-LBP complexes become bound to another membrane structure, they may not be able to induce signaling, because LPS·LBP complexes can induce little or no signal response without the help of CD14 (10Haziot A. Ferrero E. Köntgen F. Hijiya N. Yamamoto S. Silver J. Stewart C.L. Goyert S.M. Immunity. 1997; 4: 407-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Seydel and co-workers (36Gutsmann T. Muller M. Carroll S.F. MacKenzie R.C. Wiese A. Seydel U. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6942-6950Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) showed that LBP may insert into monocyte membranes and enhance cell responses to LPS. In their experiments, LBP did not inhibit monocyte activation when LBP and LPS were added together, possibly because the LBP concentrations (≤0.2 μg/ml) in their experiments were below the threshold required for inhibition. Although we used sCD14 to promote the binding of LPS to our cells, our data suggest that there was no interaction between LBP and sCD14 in our experiments. After the cells were washed to remove unbound LPS·sCD14 complexes, the cell-bound LPS cross-linked to mCD14 and not to sCD14. We previously found that, under these conditions, sCD14 transferred LPS to mCD14 in an ∼1:1 molar ratio of LPS to mCD14 (34Kitchens R.L. Munford R.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1920-1928PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, all of the sCD14 is probably released from the cells, since the presence of LBP is required to promote measurable cellular retention of sCD14 (37Tapping R.I. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23157-23164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Other inhibitory mechanisms of LBP include its ability to form large extracellular LPS-LBP complexes that have a reduced ability to stimulate cells (30Gegner J.A. Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5320-5326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 36Gutsmann T. Muller M. Carroll S.F. MacKenzie R.C. Wiese A. Seydel U. Infect.

As noted above, these complexes appear to target most of the LPS for internalization. The ability of LBP to enhance internalization of LPS may be restricted to LPS·LBP complexes that are formed before LPS-cell binding occurs; we found that, once LPS monomers were bound to mCD14, LBP had little or no ability to enhance LPS internalization (Fig. 3). LBP also inhibits LPS activity by transferring it to plasma lipoproteins, which bind and neutralize LPS (6Vesy C.J. Kitchens R.L. Wolfbauer G. Albers J.J. Munford R.S. Infect. Immun. 1999; 68: 2410-2417Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 29Wurfel M.M. Kunitake S.T. Lichenstein H. Kane J.P. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In a physiological environment, such as plasma, it is likely that each of these mechanisms of inhibition contributes to the cumulative inhibitory effect of LBP, but the relative importance of each mechanism is difficult to determine. Previous studies suggest that the balance between the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of LBP depends primarily upon the LBP concentration. When LBP and LPS were coincubated with macrophages in serum-free medium, concentrations of LBP that are much lower than those found in normal plasma (0.1 μg of LBP/ml) promoted maximal cell stimulation, whereas higher concentrations (1–10 μg/ml) were less stimulatory, suggesting that LBP was exerting a significant inhibitory effect at the higher concentrations (27Lamping N. Dettmer R. Schröder N.W. Pfeil D. Hallatschek W. Burger R. Schumann R.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2065-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 39Hamann L. Stamme C. Ulmer A.J. Schumann R.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Whereas LBP can promote LPS signaling at all LBP concentrations, the inhibitory mechanisms require relatively high LBP concentrations to have a significant impact. In the same experiments, high concentrations of LBP were inhibitory only when the LPS concentration was low (≤1 ng/ml), whereas at higher LPS concentrations, much higher concentrations of LBP were required to inhibit responses to the LPS (27Lamping N. Dettmer R. Schröder N.W. Pfeil D. Hallatschek W. Burger R. Schumann R.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2065-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 28Zweigner J. Gramm H.J. Singer O.C. Wegscheider K. Schumann R.R. Blood. 2001; 98: 3800-3808Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). LBP concentrations often increase to very high levels in the blood of septic patients, and progressive immunodepletion of LBP from the serum of these patients revealed that the LBP can have a strong inhibitory effect on the activity of LPS (28Zweigner J. Gramm H.J. Singer O.C. Wegscheider K. Schumann R.R. Blood. 2001; 98: 3800-3808Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The balance between the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of sCD14 are also concentration-dependent (26Kitchens R.L. Thompson P.A. Viriyakosol S. O'Keefe G.E. Munford R.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), although the inhibitory mechanism of sCD14 differs from that of LBP. Taken together, these findings suggest mechanisms by which the moderate to high concentrations of LBP and sCD14 that are found in human blood may help to prevent LPS-induced systemic inflammation, whereas lower concentrations of these proteins, which presumably occur in extravascular fluids, may promote beneficial inflammation at local sites of infection (40Yang K.K.

https://openalex.org/W1966400674,"Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is a transcription factor that can repress or activate transcription of the genes with which it interacts. In this report we show that YY1 is a negative regulator of the α-myosin heavy chain (αMyHC) gene, which, with βMyHC are the molecular motors of the heart. αMyHC mRNA and protein levels are down-regulated in hypertrophy and heart failure, and this is thought to be detrimental for cardiac contractility. We show that YY1 specifically interacts with the αMyHC promoter and that overexpression of YY1 in cardiac cells represses the activity of the αMyHC promoter. We also show that the 170–200-amino acid region of YY1, important for its interaction with histone acetyl transferases and histone deacetylases, is important for its repressive activity and that YY1 deleted in this region is an activator of the αMyHC promoter. Moreover, we show that YY1 levels and DNA binding activity are increased in failing human left ventricles and in a mouse model of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, where αMyHC levels are decreased. These results suggest that YY1 is a negative regulator of αMyHC gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1988971473,"Maintaining synaptic transmission requires replenishment of docked synaptic vesicles within the readily releasable pool (RRP) from synaptic vesicle clusters in the synapsin-bound reserve pool. We show that synapsin forms a complex with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) in intact nerve terminals and that synapsin-associated kinase activity increases on depolarization. Disruption of either PI 3-kinase activity or its interaction with synapsin inhibited replenishment of the RRP, but did not affect exocytosis from the RRP. Thus we conclude that a synapsin-associated PI 3-kinase activity plays a role in synaptic vesicle delivery to the RRP. This also suggests that PI 3-kinase contributes to the maintenance of synaptic transmission during periods of high activity, indicating a possible role in synaptic plasticity. Maintaining synaptic transmission requires replenishment of docked synaptic vesicles within the readily releasable pool (RRP) from synaptic vesicle clusters in the synapsin-bound reserve pool.

This also suggests that PI 3-kinase contributes to the maintenance of synaptic transmission during periods of high activity, indicating a possible role in synaptic plasticity. A typical nerve terminal in the central nervous system contains about 200–250 synaptic vesicles (SVs). 1The abbreviations used are: SV, synaptic vesicle; RRP, readily releasable pool; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; SH3, src 3 homology; A1, amphiphysin I; A2, amphiphysin II; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry; AP-2, adapter protein-2; GSH, glutathione; EPSC, end plate synoptic current; PI(3,4,5)P3, phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)triphosphate; IP, immunoprecipitation.1The abbreviations used are: SV, synaptic vesicle; RRP, readily releasable pool; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; SH3, src 3 homology; A1, amphiphysin I; A2, amphiphysin II; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry; AP-2, adapter protein-2; GSH, glutathione; EPSC, end plate synoptic current; PI(3,4,5)P3, phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)triphosphate; IP, immunoprecipitation. These can be functionally divided into a small readily releasable pool (RRP) and a large reserve pool. The RRP contains less than 5% of total nerve terminal SVs and is defined morphologically as pre-docked SVs at the active zone and functionally as SVs that are primed and immediately available for the initial rapid phase of neurotransmitter release (1Schikorski T. Stevens C.F. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The remainder constitutes the reserve pool, which ensures that a continual supply of SVs is available for delivery to the RRP and is drawn upon to maintain neurotransmission during periods of intense or prolonged stimulation (2Kuromi H. Kidokoro Y. Neuron. 1998; 20: 917-925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 3Mozhayeva M.G. Sara Y. Liu X. Kavalali E.T. J.

The reserve pool SVs surround the active zone and are clustered together in an actin-based cytoskeletal matrix via an interaction with synapsins (3Mozhayeva M.G. Sara Y. Liu X. Kavalali E.T. J.

Sci. 1999; 354: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), which maintain the reserve pool SVs as a cluster and prevent their free dispersal within the terminal. Synapsins I and II control SV replenishment of the RRP, because conditions that disrupt their function result in dispersal or depletion of SV clusters near the active zone and enhance synaptic depression (3Mozhayeva M.G.

Nature. 1995; 375: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). In contrast, disruption of the much less abundant synapsin III does not affect SV clusters and reduces synaptic depression (8Feng J. Chi P. Blanpied T.A. Xu Y. Magarinos A.M. Ferreira A.

SV liberation from clusters within the actin cytomatrix is mediated by the multi-site phosphorylation of synapsin I and II, which decreases their affinity for SVs or actin (6Hilfiker S. Pieribone V.A. Czernik A.J. Kao H.T. Augustine G.J. Greengard P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Disruption of synapsin I phosphorylation sites thus reduces the number of SVs undergoing exocytosis (9Chi P. Greengard P. Ryan T.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1187-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). It is unknown how liberated SVs translocate to the RRP, and the mechanisms governing entry into the RRP (docking/priming) are incompletely understood (10Waters M.G. Hughson F.M. Traffic. 2000; 1: 588-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Synapsin I has a C-terminal proline-rich domain that interacts with src homology 3 (SH3) domains present in a large number of proteins, including the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) (6Hilfiker S.

Synapsin I also connects vesicle traffic with the actin cytoskeleton and the synapsin-p85 in vitro interaction suggests that PI 3-kinase activity might play a role in SV recycling if it occurred in nerve terminals. We examined glutamate release from isolated nerve terminals (synaptosomes) and hippocampal CA1 neurons, and our results implicate synapsin-associated PI 3-kinase activity in the delivery of SVs from the reserve pool to the RRP during periods of high activity or prolonged stimulation.

SynI585–600 showed no homology to synapsin II or III. HF-2035 was a gift from H. Hidaka (Nagoya, Japan). The SH3 domain-containing constructs were: Grb2 (pGEX-2T plasmid encoding full-length Grb2) from Roger Daly (Sydney, Australia); p85 (pGEX-2T plasmid encoding the SH3 domain amino acids 2–83 of bovine p85-PI 3-kinase) from Tony Pawson (Toronto, Ontario, Canada); or amphiphysin I (pGEX-2T-Amph 1 SH3 domain, amino acids 588–695) and amphiphysin II (pGEX-2T-Amph 2 SH3 domain, amino acids 516–612) from Pietro De Camilli (Yale, CT). Synaptosome 32P i Labeling and Pull-downs—Synaptosomes from rat brain were labeled with 32Pi (18Robinson P.J. Sontag J.-M. Liu J.P. Fykse E.M. Slaughter C. McMahon H.T. Südhof T.C.

Synaptosomes were repolarized in the presence or absence of drug for 7 min before a second KCl stimulus (S2). Synaptosomes (control, S1, repolarization, and S2) were lysed in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture and centrifuged at 20,442 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Synapsin I, dynamin I, and synaptojanin were affinity-purified from the supernatant on bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. The GST-p85-SH3 or GST-Grb-2-SH3 domains bound to glutathione-Sepharose (GSH-Sepharose) were mixed with the supernatants for 1 h at 4 °C (19Cousin M.A. Tan T.C. Robinson P.J. J.

Each recombinant GST-SH3 domain was mixed with the tissue lysate after the preceding one was removed by filtration, in the order shown in the results. MALDI-TOF MS—Proteins that bound to the GST-SH3 domains were excised from gels and submitted to in-gel tryptic digestion and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS (20Powell K.A. Valova V.A. Malladi C.S.

Proteins were identified with the search engines Protein Prospector and Mascot, and a MOWSE score above 103 was considered significant. Immunoprecipitations (IPs)—Immunoprecipitations of synapsin, p85, or p110 from lysed nerve terminals were as described previously (18Robinson P.J. Sontag J.-M. Liu J.P. Fykse E.M. Slaughter C.

PI 3-Kinase Activity—PI 3-kinase was assayed using phosphatidylinositol 4–5-bisphosphate as the substrate as previously described (21Harrison-Findik D. Misra S. Jain S.K. Keeler M. Powell K.A.

Glutamate Release Assay—Enzyme-linked fluorescent detection was used to measure released glutamate from percoll-purified synaptosomes prepared from rat cerebral cortex. Synaptosomes were resuspended in either plus (1.2 mm CaCl2) or minus (1 mm EGTA) Ca2+ Krebs-like solution (118.5 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.18 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm Na2HPO4, 20 mm Hepes, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4) at 37 °C. Synaptosomes were preincubated with 1 μm Wortmannin or 100 μm LY294002 for 15 min, with 100 nm Wortmannin for 60 min, or with penetratin52–58 attached to either SynI585–600 peptide (400 μm) or to β-adaptin AP-2 β2624–644 (500 μm) for 30 min before stimulation with 30 mm KCl. To monitor release specifically from the RRP, discontinuous enzyme-linked fluorescent detection was used. Percoll-purified synaptosomes (1 mg in 1 ml) were resuspended in Krebs solution supplemented with or without 0.5 m sucrose (hypertonic sucrose) for 30 s, centrifuged, and the supernatant (containing the released glutamate) was collected. Released glutamate was assayed spectrofluorimetrically (19Cousin M.A. Tan T.C. Robinson P.J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Whole-cell Patch-clamp Recordings—These were made from infrared differential interference contrast visualized CA1 pyramidal neurons in vitro, using standard techniques. Hippocampi from male Wistar rats (6–8 weeks) were sliced transversely (400 μm) and incubated at 35 °C for one hour in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) (containing (in mm): NaCl (124), NaHCO3 (26), KCl (3.2), NaH2PO4 (1.25), glucose (10), CaCl2 (0.5), MgCl2 (7)). The ACSF contained 25 mm glucose, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 1.3 mm MgCl2 for whole-cell recordings using glass pipettes (∼5 MΩ) filled with KMeSO4 (135), HEPES (10), NaCl (7), EGTA (0.5), Na2ATP (2), Na2GTP (0.3), MgCl2 (2), pH 7.2. Bath temperature during recording was ∼32 °C. Neurons were held at –65 mV, average input resistance was 79 MΩ, and recordings were halted if series resistance varied more that 20%. Synaptic stimulation was delivered to the Schaffer collaterals via a bipolar Teflon-insulated, tungsten electrode, and current was adjusted to obtain EPSCs ∼250 pA in amplitude. Test stimulation (0.25 Hz) was delivered for 10 min prior to ensure recordings were stable, then 10 Hz stimulation was delivered for 60 s. Test stimulations were then resumed for 15 min, during which LY249002 (50 μm) was applied for the final 10 min prior to a second bout of 10 Hz stimulation. A final period of test stimulation was then given to monitor potential long-term changes in synaptic transmission. SV Endocytosis Assay—Endocytosis was assayed using percoll-purified synaptosomes and the uptake and release of FM2–10 (19Cousin M.A. Tan T.C. Robinson P.J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry—B104 rat brain neuroblastoma cells (22El Bitar F. Dastugue B. Meiniel A. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 298: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) were grown (1,000 cells/ml) on poly-d-lysine-coated glass cover slips in a 12-well plate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were differentiated with 1% horse serum and 1 mm dibutyryl cAMP for 6 days with fresh media every 2 days. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, permeablized with 0.1% SDS with 1% bovine serum albumin for 15 min, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 45 min. Synapsin Ia goat polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and PI 3-kinase p85-α mouse monoclonal IgG1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used at 1:250 overnight at 4 °C. Wells were washed and incubated for 30 min in the dark with both fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated affinity purified donkey anti-goat IgG (Jackson Immunology Research) for synapsin and Texas Red-conjugated affinity purified goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunology Research) for p85. After placing a coverslip over the glass slide cell staining was observed using a Leica DM LB microscope at 100× magnification. Controls revealed no color bleeding between channels. Synapsin I and PI 3-Kinase Interact in Nerve Terminals— Synapsin associates with many SH3 domain-containing proteins, including Grb2, amphiphysins I and II, and p85 (11Onofri F. Giovedi S. Kao H.T. Valtorta F. Borbone L.B. De Camilli P. Greengard P. Benfenati F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29857-29867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To identify selective binding partners for PI 3-kinase in brain we performed sequential pull-down experiments using GST fusion proteins containing the SH3 domains of p85, Grb2, amphiphysin I (A1), amphiphysin II (A2) and identified interacting proteins by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. This sequential approach was aimed at pre-clearing strongly interacting partners like dynamin I, which may bind all the targets. Using GST-Grb2-SH3 first, the major protein extracted from brain homogenates was the highly abundant dynamin I (Fig. 1A). The homogenate was extracted twice more with Grb2-SH3 until no more dynamin I was recovered, then sequentially extracted with the other recombinant SH3 domains. When p85-SH3 extraction followed Grb2-SH3, synaptojanin, and synapsins Ia and Ib were present (Fig. 1A). Subsequent extraction with A1-SH3 or A2-SH3 recovered more synaptojanin and additional unique proteins (Fig. 1A). When the order of extraction was altered such that p85-SH3 was utilized last, an association with synapsins Ia and Ib was still observed, despite prior extraction with three other SH3 domains. Therefore the p85-SH3-synapsin association is highly selective when compared against other SH3 domain proteins and p85 may be a key synapsin-binding protein in nerve terminals. To identify PI 3-kinase binding partners in nerve terminals, we performed pull-down experiments in synaptosomes using recombinant p85-SH3 or Grb2-SH3 (Fig. 1B). p85-SH3 primarily extracted synaptojanin, dynamin I, and synapsin Ia/b. Grb2 also extracted synaptojanin and dynamin I, but its association with synapsin was barely detectable, highlighting the relative selectivity of the p85-SH3-synapsin interaction. Protein identification was confirmed by MALDI-MS (not shown) and by Western blotting (Fig. 1C). To determine whether the phosphorylation status of the extracted proteins regulate their binding, pull-down experiments were performed in metabolically labeled, resting (Ctrl), deploarized (S1), repolarized (Repol), or redepolarized (S2) synaptosomes. No difference in the amount of protein bound was observed (Fig. 1B and data not shown) indicating these interactions are independent of their phosphorylation status (Fig. 1D). To determine whether synapsin I and PI 3-kinase form a complex in intact nerve terminals, we performed a series of co-IPs. IP of p85 revealed synapsin I, as did IP of the catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase, p110 (Fig. 2A). Conversely, synapsin antibodies immunoprecipitated p85. Synapsin and p85 also co-localize to SV clusters in specific puncta in the neurites of B104 neuronal cells differentiated with cAMP (Fig. 2, B and C). Thus PI 3-kinase is found in the correct subcellular location for a role in SV recycling. To determine whether synapsin associates with an active PI 3-kinase complex, we measured PI 3-kinase activity in synapsin I IPs (Fig. 2D). A high level of activity immunoprecipitated with synapsin I in resting nerve terminals. This activity increased about 2-fold after S1 and was reversed when the stimulus was removed (Fig. 2D, Repol). Thus synapsin and PI 3-kinase form an active complex in nerve terminals that is regulated by stimulation. PI 3-Kinase Regulates Glutamate Release from the Reserve Pool—Next we examined the functional role of PI 3-kinase activity in neurotransmitter release from synaptosomes. Glutamate is the predominant neurotransmitter in synaptosomes, with greater than 80% of nerve terminals being glutamatergic (23Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 613-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). KCl-evoked Ca2+-dependent glutamate release was strongly inhibited when synaptosomes were preincubated with either 1 μm Wortmannin or 100 μm LY294002 (Fig. 3A). Neither inhibitor had any effect on KCl-evoked Ca2+-independent glutamate release (data not shown), ruling out effects on the plasma membrane glutamate co-transporter (23Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 613-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The same results were obtained with 100 nm Wortmannin when preincubation times were increased to 60 min (data not shown). Fast and slow phases of glutamate release have been characterized in synaptosomes and represent release from the RRP or RRP replenishment from reserve pool SVs, respectively (24McMahon H.T. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 25Herrero I. Castro E. Miras-Portugal M.T. Sanchez-Prieto J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2346-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Remarkably, Wortmannin or LY294002 exclusively inhibited the slow phase of Ca2+-dependent glutamate release (Fig. 3A). We compared a number of inhibitors with different mechanisms of action for their relative effects on the two pools. We arbitrarily defined the release originating from the reserve pool as glutamate released after 90 s of stimulation, with glutamate release prior to 10 s being from the RRP and calculated a ratio (>90 s/<10 s). A ratio of greater than one indicates preferential inhibition of the RRP, whereas a ratio less than one indicates a block of SV delivery from the reserve pool. The only antagonists that affected this ratio were Wortmannin and LY294002, which reduced the ratio value to 0.50 ± 0.02 and 0.36 ± 0.04, respectively (Fig. 3B). This indicates that PI 3-kinase activity may be required for the delivery of reserve pool SVs to the RRP during prolonged depolarization. To ensure that the requirement for PI 3-kinase activity is upstream from the RRP, SVs from the RRP were selectively released by application of hypertonic sucrose (26Rosenmund C. Stevens C.F. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1197-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). This protocol only releases docked and primed SVs and does not require Ca2+ influx. Application of hypertonic sucrose in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+ resulted in the release of 2.5 ± 0.3 or 2.4 ± 0.2 nmol/mg glutamate, respectively, an amount expected for release exclusively from the RRP. When synaptosomes were preincubated with Wortmannin or LY294002, no inhibition of sucrose-evoked glutamate release was observed either in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 3C). Therefore PI 3-kinase activity is not required for the fusion of SVs that are already present in the RRP. The inhibition of a late phase of glutamate release from synaptosomes correlates with a block of SV delivery from the reserve pool. To determine whether a similar inhibition might occur during periods of high synaptic transmission in situ, we made whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of EPSCs from hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons after a prolonged train of repetitive stimulation. When a prolonged repetitive stimulation at relatively lower frequency is applied, depletion of the RRP is usually faster than replenishment from the reserve pool, leading to a gradual decline of EPSC amplitude (4Cabin D.E. Shimazu K. Murphy D. Cole N.B. Gottschalk W. McIlwain K.L. Orrison B. Chen A. Ellis C.E. Paylor R. Lu B. Nussbaum R.L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8797-8807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synaptic stimulation of pyramidal neurons at 10 Hz for 60 s resulted in a gradual decay of EPSC amplitude to –44 ± 3% (n = 5) by the end of stimulation (Fig. 3D). In the same neurons, after a 10 min bath-application of LY294002 (50 μm), 10 Hz stimulation caused a more rapid decay of EPSCs and resulted in significantly greater depression (–60 ± 2%, n = 3, p < 0.05). In both control and LY294002-treated cells 10 Hz stimulation caused no long-term change in synaptic efficacy. Also there was no significant difference in the size of EPSCs between control (249 pA) and drug-treated (248 pA) cells at the beginning of stimulation, indicating LY294002 has no effect on basal neurotransmission (27Daw M.I. Bortolotto Z.A. Saulle E. Zaman S. Collingridge G.L. Isaac J.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 28Sanna P.P. Cammalleri M. Berton F. Simpson C. Lutjens R. Bloom F.E. Francesconi W. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3359-3365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the RRP in LY294002-treated synapses was not efficiently replenished by the delivery of reserve pool SVs, resulting in a faster depletion of SVs during a prolonged train of repetitive stimulation. Genetic disruption of synapsins results in a similar enhancement of synaptic depression due to loss of reserve pool SV clusters (3Mozhayeva M.G. Sara Y. Liu X. Kavalali E.T. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 654-665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Li L. Chin L.S. Shupliakov O. Brodin L. Sihra T.S. Hvalby O. Jensen V. Zheng D. McNamara J.O. Greengard P. Andersen P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9235-9239Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 29Rosahl T.W. Geppert M. Spillane D. Herz J. Hammer R.E. Malenka R.C. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 661-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The PI 3-Kinase-Synapsin Interaction Is Required for SV Delivery—We next addressed whether the synapsin-PI 3-kinase interaction plays a role in the late phase of glutamate release. We designed a potential inhibitory peptide (SynI585–600) similar to one previously used to block the synapsin-p85 association in vitro (11Onofri F. Giovedi S. Kao H.T. Valtorta F. Borbone L.B. De Camilli P. Greengard P. Benfenati F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29857-29867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The peptide abolished the interaction of synapsin I with p85-SH3, but not that of dynamin I or synaptojanin (Fig. 4, A and B). This is important because dynamin I is a major ligand of the p85-SH3 domain in nerve terminals (Fig. 1B). Two additional synapsin I peptides that contain potential SH3-binding motifs were without effect (Fig. 4, A and B). Peptides from the third α-helix of the homeodomain of Drosophila antennopedia (penetratin43–58) are used for translocating peptide into cells (30Lindgren I. Hallbrink I. Prochiantz I. Langel I. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 99-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). To examine the consequences of disrupting the p85-synapsin I interaction in nerve terminals, the SynI585–600 peptide was translocated into synaptosomes using this vector system. We employed the minimum sequence required for internalization, the C-terminal heptapeptide (penetratin52–58) (17Fischer P.M. Zhelev N.Z. Wang S. Melville J.E. Fahraeus R. Lane D.P. J. Pept. Res. 2000; 55: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4D). This approach complements pharmacological studies, because PI 3-kinase activity is not inhibited. The penetratin-SynI585–600 peptide abolished the p85-synapsin I interaction but importantly did not affect the dynamin I or synaptojanin interactions (Fig. 4C). The penetratin-SynI585–600 peptide inhibited only the late phase of Ca2+-dependent glutamate release (Fig. 5A). It did not affect Ca2+-independent glutamate release (data not shown), a reliable indicator that nerve terminal viability was not compromised. The selective inhibition of reserve pool glutamate release by penetratin-SynI585–600 was clearly indicated when exocytosis was separated into early (release <10 s, inhibition of 6.1 ± 12.4%, n = 4 ± S.E.) and late components (release >90 s, inhibition of 40.4 ± 3.8%, n = 4 ± S.E.). This is reflected in the reserve/RRP ratio (Fig. 5B). The peptide was without effect on RRP release evoked by hypertonic sucrose (Fig. 5C). To control for potential side-effects of the penetratin leader sequence, peptides identical to the clathrin-binding site on AP-2 (AP-2 β2624–644) (31ter Haar E. Harrison S.C. Kirchhausen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) were prepared with the same leader sequence (Fig. 5F). AP-2 β2624–644 had no effect on glutamate release (Fig. 5D) and blocked endocytosis, as expected (Fig. 5E). Thus the data suggest that the direct interaction of PI 3-kinase with synapsin I is important for the delivery of SVs to the RRP but not for the fusion of SVs present in the RRP. The first stage of SV delivery is liberation of SVs from the reserve pool (6Hilfiker S. Pieribone V.A. Czernik A.J. Kao H.T. Augustine G.J. Greengard P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Because site-specific phosphorylation of synapsin I controls this process, PI 3-kinase may mediate liberation by altering synapsin phosphorylation, either directly or via a downstream protein kinase such as Akt (6Hilfiker S. Pieribone V.A. Czernik A.J. Kao H.T. Augustine G.J. Greengard P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). However, we found that neither Wortmannin nor LY294002 had any effect on the depolarization-dependent phosphorylation of synapsin I in synaptosomes, ruling out this possibility (Fig. 6). Our data reveal a new role for PI 3-kinase in the delivery of SVs from the reserve pool to the RRP for exocytosis. This role is mediated by an association between PI 3-kinase and synapsin I, via p85. This is the first report of a specific locus of action of PI 3-kinase activity in SV exocytosis. Our conclusions are based on a selective inhibition of the late phase of glutamate release by both PI 3-kinase inhibitors and a peptide that blocks the synapsin-p85 interaction. This inhibition is not due to a block in SV recycling because none of these treatments had any effect on SV endocytosis (not shown). The early and late phases of glutamate release are well characterized in synaptosomes and almost all treatments that reduce exocytosis do so equally from both phases (24McMahon H.T. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 25Herrero I. Castro E. Miras-Portugal M.T. Sanchez-Prieto J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2346-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A similar selective inhibition of KCl-evoked glutamate release is also observed in synaptosomes derived from synapsin I knockout mice (5Li L. Chin L.S. Shupliakov O. Brodin L. Sihra T.S. Hvalby O. Jensen V. Zheng D. McNamara J.O. Greengard P. Andersen P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9235-9239Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), demonstrating the synapsin-dependent nature of this late phase. Thus the interaction of PI 3-kinase with synapsin during this phase may be important for targeting PI 3-kinase to phosphorylate inositol lipids either on the SV or on the plasma membrane. The most likely explanation for our results is that production of PI(3,4,5)P3 is necessary for the delivery of SVs to the RRP after their liberation from the reserve pool. SV delivery has two steps, translocation and entry into the RRP. Translocation from SV clusters in the reserve pool to the RRP may occur by passive diffusion, or mechanisms may exist to direct a subset of SVs to release sites. SV entry into the RRP is a two-stage process, mediated by SV docking at active zones followed by a priming event that confers fusion competence on the SV. It is unlikely that the synapsin-PI 3-kinase association plays a role in SV entry into the RRP as synapsin itself is not required for this step (6Hilfiker S. Pieribone V.A. Czernik A.J. Kao H.T. Augustine G.J. Greengard P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase mediates the specificity of vesicle delivery at various stages of vesicle recycling pathways in other cells; however, different isoforms play distinct roles. Type III PI 3-kinase mainly produces PI (3)P and confers specificity of docking of vesicles at endosomes (32Simonsen A. Lippe R. Christoforidis S. Gaullier J.M. Brech A. Callaghan J. Toh B.H. Murphy C. Zerial M. Stenmark H. Nature. 1998; 394: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 33Peterson M.R. Burd C.G. Emr S.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 159-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Type II PI 3-kinase plays a role in clathrin-coated bud formation at the plasma membrane and at the trans-Golgi surface via its association with clathrin (34Gaidarov I. Smith M.E. Domin J. Keen J.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 443-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Type I PI 3-kinases, as described in this paper, produce PI(3,4,5)P3 as their major in vivo product. PI(3,4,5)P3 binds many proteins found in nerve terminals, including phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1, protein kinase B, protein kinase C isoforms, phospholipase C-γ, dynamin I, synaptotagmin, myosin X, AP-2, and neurogranin (35Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar), none of which have been implicated in SV delivery. However, other possible PI(3,4,5)P3 effectors exist such as cytohesin/msec7–1, a guanine nucleotide-exchange factor for ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6). Activation of ARF6 by msec7–1 is PI(3,4,5)P3-dependent (36Cullen P.J. Venkateswarlu K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Overexpression of msec7–1 augments transmitter release in Xenopus neuromuscular junctions by increasing the size of the RRP (37Ashery U. Koch H. Scheuss V. Brose N. Rettig J. Venkateswarlu K. Cullen P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1094-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Msec7–1 also interacts with munc 13–1, which is targeted to active zones and implicated in priming (38Neeb A. Koch H. Schurmann A. Brose N. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus regulation of the activation/inactivation cycle of ARF6 by PI 3-kinase might control the entry of SVs into the RRP at a priming step in peripheral neurons (39Yang F. He X. Feng L. Mizuno K. Liu X.W. Russell J. Xiong W.C. Lu B. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A role for synapsin-associated PI 3-kinase activity upstream from the RRP may reveal a common cellular role for PI 3-kinase in exocytosis and vesicle delivery. In non-neuronal cells, which lack synapsin, its role in vesicle supply is managed through the actin cytoskeleton in a synapsin-independent manner (15Martin T.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 16Cremona O. De Camilli P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1041-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase plays key roles in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (40Chasserot-Golaz S. Hubert P. Thierse D. Dirrig S. Vlahos C.J. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2347-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 41Czech M.P. Cell. 2000; 100: 603-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 42Hill K.M.

For example it directly associates with and activates p21-activated kinase-1, which is downstream of the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42 (43Papakonstanti E.A. Stournaras C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2946-2962Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and directly binds active Rac or Rho (44Bokoch G.M. Vlahos C.J. Wang Y. Knaus U.G. Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Biochem.

Chem. 1995; 270: 17656-17659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase also interacts with profilin (46Singh S.S. Chauhan A. Murakami N. Chauhan V.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16544-16549Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) (which also binds PI(3,4,5)P3), increasing the interaction of this complex with actin (47Bhargavi V. Chari V.B. Singh S.S. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 46: 241-248PubMed Google Scholar). In chromaffin cells, PI 3-kinase inhibitors block exocytosis by specifically affecting actin assembly (40Chasserot-Golaz S. Hubert P. Thierse D. Dirrig S. Vlahos C.J. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2347-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our results link these effects with the role of synapsin I in the actin cytoskeleton and provide a framework for how these proteins may work together at synapses. Thus synapsin serves as an anchor regulating the localization and activation of PI 3-kinase at SV clusters to regulate SV trafficking from the actin cytoskeleton. In support, p110-α is highly enriched in the growth cones and filopodia of cultured primary hippocampal neurons where it is coincident with enriched F-actin (48Raymond C.R. Redman S.J. Crouch M.F. Neurosci. 2002; 109: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Our results indicate a new role for synapsin I-associated PI 3-kinase activity in glutamate release from central nerve terminals. PI 3-kinase inhibition also enhanced the run-down of synaptic transmission on prolonged repetitive stimulation. Such run-downs are thought to represent synaptic depression, which is one form of synaptic plasticity that is also enhanced in mice lacking synapsin I. This suggests the synapsin-p85 interaction may be involved in preventing synaptic depression and might have a presynaptic role in synaptic plasticity (13Kelly A. Lynch M.A. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 27Daw M.I. Bortolotto Z.A. Saulle E. Zaman S. Collingridge G.L. Isaac J.T. Nat.

It will be important in future studies to identify the downstream targets of PI(3,4,5)P3 to provide more information on the specific locus of action of PI 3-kinase in SV exocytosis.

Unexpectedly, we found that hepatic overexpression of SPAP in mice resulted in liver deficiency of PDZK1. The absence of PDZK1 in SPAP transgenic mice resulted in a deficiency of SR-BI in liver and markedly increased plasma HDL. Metabolic labeling experiments showed that the proteasome plays a role in the turnover of newly synthesized PDZK1, but that SPAP overexpression in liver increased PDZK1 turnover in an alternate, proteasome-independent pathway.

Thus, SPAP may be an endogenous regulator of cellular PDZK1 levels by regulating PDZK1 turnover. The liver is the principal site for plasma lipoprotein cholesterol uptake and elimination in bile (1Glass C. Pittman R.C. Weinstein D.B. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5435-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar).

Importantly, SR-BI plays a major role in regulating plasma HDL levels, and its activity is anti-atherogenic in mice (6Braun A. Trigatti B.L. Post M.J. Sato K. Simons M. Edelberg J.M. Rosenberg R.D.

The mechanism by which SR-BI mediates hepatic lipid uptake from HDL and regulation of SR-BI activity or levels in the liver is not well understood. Recently, the PDZ domain containing protein called PDZK1 (also known as Diphor-1 (11)/CAP70 (12)/NaPi-Cap1 (13)/CLAMP (14)) was purified from rat liver extracts by affinity chromatography using the carboxyl terminus of SR-BI (14Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aoki J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6538-6543Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). PDZ domains are 80–90 amino acid motifs that are often involved in scaffolding protein complexes at plasma membranes, maintaining cell polarity, and signal transduction (15Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). PDZK1 migrates as a 70-kDa protein on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels, comprises four PDZ domains without other apparent protein-protein interacting or enzymatic motifs (12Wang S. Yue H. Derin R.B. Guggino W.B. Li M. Cell. 2000; 103: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 14Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aoki J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6538-6543Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and is primarily expressed in kidney, liver, and lung (12Wang S. Yue H. Derin R.B. Guggino W.B. Li M. Cell. 2000; 103: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The closest homolog of PDZK1 is a protein called IKEPP (16Scott R.O. Thelin W.R. Milgram S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22934-22941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). IKEPP is expressed in similar tissues as PDZK1 and shares a similar structure with four PDZ domains that are 30–50% identical with the PDZ domains of PDZK1 (16Scott R.O. Thelin W.R. Milgram S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22934-22941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because of the presence of four PDZ domains, PDZK1 may act to scaffold a macromolecular complex at the plasma membrane. In recent studies, we have delimited the SR-BI PDZK1-interacting domain to the last three to four carboxyl-terminal amino acids of SR-BI (EAKL), defining a typical class II PDZ domain interaction (17Silver D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34042-34047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). SR-BI deleted in the last carboxyl-terminal leucine of the PDZK1-interacting domain (SR-BIdel509) failed to interact with PDZK1 in vitro (17Silver D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34042-34047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Examination of transgenic mice overexpressing SR-BIdel509 in the liver revealed that SR-BIdel509 protein is not at the plasma membrane, and levels were reduced in liver, suggesting that the PDZK1-interacting domain of SR-BI is essential for expression in liver (17Silver D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34042-34047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). On the basis of this work, we hypothesized that PDZK1 may be a key regulatory point to modulate SR-BI levels and thus plasma HDL levels, and that PDZK1-interacting proteins may be involved in regulating PDZK1 and SR-BI function. Here we describe the identification of a PDZK1 binding protein that when overexpressed in liver causes increased degradation of PDZK1, resulting in hepatic SR-BI deficiency and markedly increased plasma HDL cholesterol levels. Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies were produced to 14 amino acid carboxyl-terminal peptides of murine small PDZK1-associated protein (SPAP) and murine PDZK1 using the commercial service Multiple Peptide Systems. Anti-SR-BI polyclonal antibody was purchased from Novus Biologicals. Anti-PDZK1 monoclonal antibody used for immunoprecipitation was a kind gift from Dr. Hiroyoki Arai. IKEPP polyclonal antibody was a kind gift from Dr. Sharon Milgram. Antibodies to murine apolipoproteins E and A1 were purchased from Biodesign. Cell Culture—HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) plus 10% fetal bovine serum. SR-BI constructs were transfected into cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Immunoprecipitation—Liver tissue was homogenized in RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100) in a Dounce homogenizer. Samples were rotated for2hat4 °C. Samples were spun at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, then 1:100 dilutions of antibodies with protein A/G agarose beads were added to supernatants and rotated overnight at 4 °C. Samples were then washed three times with RIPA buffer, and SDS-PAGE loading buffer was added and samples were separated on SDS-PAGE for Western blot analysis. RT-PCR—A full-length mouse SPAP cDNA was amplified from mouse liver RNA using the Access RT-PCR System (Promega) with forward primer 5′-GACAAGCTTCTGCCTGCAGCCATGTTGGCC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GACTCGAGTCACATGGGTGTGCTGCGGACC-3′. The SPAP cDNA was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1hygro+ (Invitrogen). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the Access RT-PCR System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA from mouse tissues was used in RT-PCR reactions to amplify full-length SPAP cDNA using the same primers shown above. Mouse β-actin was amplified with forward primer 5′-AGAGGGAAATCGTGCGTGAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CAATAGTGATGACCTGGCCGT-3′. Generation of SPAP-expressing Adenovirus—The mouse full-length cDNA for SPAP was subcloned into the shuttle vector pCR259 (Q-Biogen), and adenovirus was then produced using the Transpose-Ad kit from Q-Biogen. Generation of SPAP Transgenic Mice—SPAP transgenic mice were produced using the same liver-specific expression cassette as described previously (18Wang N. Arai T. Ji Y. Rinninger F. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32920-32926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Briefly, a PmeI-XhoI fragment containing the murine SPAP cDNA was excised from pcDNA3.1 and subcloned into the pLIV-7 plasmid. A linearized fragment of the construct containing the promoter, first exon, first intron, and part of the second exon of the human apoE gene; the SR-BIdel509 cDNA and the polyadenylation sequence; and hepatic control region of the apoE/C-I gene locus were used to generate transgenic mice by standard procedures. Founder animals were backcrossed to C57Bl/6J mice, and two transgenic mouse lines, 261 and 263, were established. Studies in this paper were performed using mice, 8–12 weeks of age, from line 263 genotypically positive for the SPAP transgene versus control littermates negative for the SPAP transgene. All mice were fed a standard chow diet. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee at Columbia University. Metabolic Labeling—Primary hepatocytes were isolated according to Silver et al. (19Silver D.L. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and allowed to attach to plates for 1.5 h in DMEM 5% fetal bovine serum. Hepatocytes were then pre-incubated with methionine/cysteine-free DMEM for 1.5 h before pulse-labeling with 100 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine/cysteine for 30 min. Cells were subsequently washed and chased in DMEM 5% fetal bovine serum with 10× more methionine/cysteine for the indicated times. A concentration of lactacystin at 20 μm in Me2SO (Calbiochem), a concentration commonly used to specifically inhibit the proteasome, was added to cells after the initial pulse period for 60 min to allow cells to achieve steady state and for the duration of the chase period. Control cells received a similar concentration of Me2SO. To identify PDZK1-interacting partners, immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out with anti-PDZK1 antibody after overexpressing PDZK1 using adenovirus in mouse primary hepatocytes. The rationale is that overexpression of PDZK1 may lead to increased complexes between PDZK1 and PDZK1-interacting proteins that can be co-immunoprecipitated and identified on SDS-PAGE gels. Primary mouse hepatocytes that overexpressed PDZK1 from the adenovirus were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, and PDZK1 immunoprecipitated from hepatocyte lysates. These experiments resulted in the weak appearance on SDS-PAGE gels of an ∼14-kDa protein from PDZK1-overexpressing liver in addition to the 70-kDa PDZK1 band (Fig. 1), which we have designated SPAP. Further purification steps necessary to identify SPAP proved difficult. However, this protein was similar in size to the previously identified PDZK1-interacting protein DD96/MAP17 (20Kocher O. Cheresh P. Brown L.F. Lee S.W. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 1209-1215PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kocher O. Cheresh P. Lee S.W. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 493-500PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kocher O. Comella N. Tognazzi K. Brown L.F. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 117-125PubMed Google Scholar). SPAP/DD96/MAP17 is predicted to be a type I transmembrane protein having a class I PDZ-interacting domain (STMP) at the carboxyl terminus (Fig. 2A). DD96/MAP17 was shown to be expressed in epithelial cells of kidney and breast, as well as carcinomas derived from these organs, but expression in liver has not been examined previously (20Kocher O. Cheresh P. Brown L.F. Lee S.W. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 1209-1215PubMed Google Scholar). We found SPAP/DD96/MAP17 to be expressed primarily in kidney, lung, and liver of adult mouse tissues (Fig. 1B), the same tissues that express PDZK1 (12Wang S. Yue H. Derin R.B. Guggino W.B. Li M. Cell. 2000; 103: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Although experiments using mammalian two-hybrid or binding assays on nitrocellulose membranes in vitro suggested that DD96/MAP17 interacts with PDZK1 (22Kocher O. Comella N. Tognazzi K. Brown L.F. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 117-125PubMed Google Scholar), an in vivo function and physiological role for binding with PDZK1 were unknown previously.Fig. 2Mouse SPAP protein sequence and expression pattern in mouse tissues.

IP, immunoprecipitate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To provide direct evidence that endogenously expressed SPAP in mouse tissues interacts with PDZK1 in vivo, PDZK1 immunoprecipitation was performed from mouse kidney and liver. Interaction in kidney was also examined because of the high levels of expression of both PDZK1 and SPAP in this tissue. Fig. 2C shows that SPAP and PDZK1 co-immunoprecipitated from kidney and liver. More SPAP was co-immunoprecipitated from kidney, reflecting higher expression levels of PDZK1 in that tissue relative to liver (12Wang S. Yue H. Derin R.B. Guggino W.B. Li M. Cell. 2000; 103: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Taken together, the data indicate that SPAP and PDZK1 are expressed endogenously in liver and interact in vivo. To test the in vivo effect of SPAP on PDZK1 and SR-BI in liver, liver-specific overexpression of SPAP was achieved using a human apoE/liver-specific enhancer expression cassette shown to give liver-specific transgene expression (23Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Pitas R.E. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8651-8654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used this vector system previously to successfully produce liver-specific overexpression of SR-BI and SR-BIdel509 in mice (17Silver D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34042-34047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 18Wang N. Arai T. Ji Y. Rinninger F. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32920-32926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, SPAP overexpression resulted in the absence of PDZK1 in liver (Fig. 3A). Importantly, overexpression of SPAP did not result in decreased levels of the PDZK1 homolog IKEPP, indicating specificity toward PDZK1 (Fig. 3A). Thus, SPAP overexpression in liver resulted in hepatic deficiency of PDZK1. On the basis of our previous experiments indicating that PDZK1 is essential for SR-BI expression in liver, we hypothesized that livers of SPAP transgenic mice would have a deficiency in SR-BI. Indeed, SR-BI protein levels in livers of SPAP transgenic mice were markedly reduced (<10% of wild-type levels) but not in adrenal glands or in peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 3A), confirming our previous findings and providing evidence that PDZK1 is essential for SR-BI expression in liver (17Silver D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34042-34047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Both PDZK1 and SR-BI mRNA levels were unchanged in SPAP transgenic mice, indicating that SPAP regulation of PDZK1 is post-transcriptional (Fig. 3B), and that SPAP expression likely causes degradation of PDZK1. It is important to note that SR-BI gene-targeted mice have normal levels of liver PDZK1 (24Mardones P. Pilon A. Bouly M. Duran D. Nishimoto T. Arai H. Kozarsky K.F. Altayo M. Miquel J.F. Luc G. Clavey V. Staels B. Rigotti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7884-7890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), supporting our findings that PDZK1 is essential for SR-BI expression in liver, but not vice versa. To examine whether SPAP overexpression results in increased degradation of PDZK1, we performed metabolic pulse-chase assays on primary hepatocytes isolated from SPAP transgenic mice and wild-type littermates. Fig. 4A indicates that PDZK1 turnover in hepatocytes from SPAP transgenic mice is faster than that measured in hepatocytes from wild-type littermates (relative turnover of PDZK1 in SPAP transgenic mice was greater than 3-fold faster than in wild-type littermates). Steady-state levels of PDZK1 were not detected in hepatocytes from SPAP transgenic mice (Fig. 4A, lower panel), as also observed for whole liver extracts (Fig. 3A). We did not detect a change in SR-BI turnover in isolated primary hepatocytes from SPAP transgenic mice compared with wild-type littermates (data not shown). A common pathway by which cellular proteins are degraded is via the proteasome (25Baumeister W. Walz J. Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). To determine whether SPAP-mediated degradation of PDZK1 requires a functional proteasome, we performed metabolic pulse-chase assays on isolated hepatocytes in the presence or absence of the specific proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. Fig. 4B shows that lactacystin blocked the turnover of PDZK1 in hepatocytes from wild-type littermates but not from SPAP transgenic mice. Lactacystin treatment was effective in blocking the proteasome-mediated degradation of PDZK1 in hepatocytes from wild-type littermates because pulse-labeled PDZK1 was found to be increased relative to non-treated hepatocytes (64% increase in PDZK1, p < 0.025; Fig. 4B). Steady-state levels of PDZK1 (Western blot, Fig. 4B) were not significantly increased after lactacystin treatment. Again, PDZK1 at steady state could not be detected in hepatocytes from SPAP transgenic mice (Western blot, Fig. 4). Together, the data indicate that turnover of PDZK1 in wild-type hepatocytes occurs in part by a proteasome-dependent pathway, whereas SPAP overexpression in liver leads to rapid degradation of PDZK1 by a proteasome-independent pathway, which in turn results in the posttranslational down-regulation of SR-BI. SR-BI knock-out mice have a 2-fold increase in plasma HDL relative to wild-type mice (26Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Although SR-BI is expressed in multiple tissues, the liver is the major site of HDL cholesterol metabolism, and therefore, we expected that the effect of a liver-specific deficiency of SR-BI found in SPAP transgenic mice would result in increased plasma HDL. Indeed, analysis of plasma cholesterol from SPAP transgenic mice revealed a 2-fold increase in cholesterol levels compared with wild-type littermates (Fig. 5A). The marked increase in plasma cholesterol determined by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) analysis was attributable solely to an increase in HDL cholesterol in SPAP transgenic mice (Fig. 5B). The FPLC profile reveals that a portion of the HDL in SPAP transgenic mice is large “low density lipoprotein (LDL)-like” HDL enriched in apoE relative to apoAI (Fig. 5C, fractions 17–20). Thus, SPAP raises plasma HDL cholesterol by down-regulating PDZK1 levels in liver that, in turn, down-regulates SR-BI. We have identified an endogenous 14-kDa PDZK1-interacting protein by immunoprecipitation assays with PDZK1 in mouse liver. We named this protein SPAP. SPAP is of similar size to the previously identified PDZK1-interacting protein DD96/MAP17. However, DD96/MAP17 was only reported to interact with PDZK1 in mammalian two-hybrid or binding assays on nitrocellulose membranes in vitro but not shown to interact with PDZK1 in vivo (22Kocher O. Comella N. Tognazzi K. Brown L.F. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 117-125PubMed Google Scholar). DD96 was identified as an up-regulated differential display product from a human renal carcinoma compared with normal renal parenchyma (20Kocher O. Cheresh P. Brown L.F. Lee S.W. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 1209-1215PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of hydropathical analysis, DD96 was redesignated as membrane-associated protein 17 kDa (MAP17) (21Kocher O. Cheresh P. Lee S.W. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 493-500PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, an in vivo function and physiological role of DD96/MAP17 binding with PDZK1 was unknown previously. In our studies reported here, we show that DD96/MAP17 is expressed in liver and co-immunoprecipitated with PDZK1 from mouse liver, indicating an in vivo interaction. Therefore, we suggest renaming DD96/MAP17 as SPAP, which better describes its function. We examined the in vivo function of SPAP in liver by overexpressing SPAP under the control of the apoE promoter and liver-specific enhancer (23Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Pitas R.E. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M.

SPAP overexpression in mouse liver resulted in the unexpected finding that PDZK1 was undetectable in livers of SPAP transgenic mice. Importantly, SPAP overexpression did not reduce levels of the PDZK1 homolog IKEPP in liver, indicating a level of ligand specificity of SPAP for PDZK1. In metabolic pulse-chase assays to examine PDZK1 degradation, we found that PDZK1 turnover is enhanced 3-fold in hepatocytes from SPAP transgenic mice relative to non-transgenic littermates, likely explaining the PDZK1 deficiency in livers from SPAP transgenic mice. In the same pulse-chase experiments, we did not find any change in SR-BI turnover in hepatocytes from SPAP transgenic mice relative to wild-type littermates. This result was not surprising because the PDZK1-interacting domain is not essential for SR-BI expression in non-polarized cells (39Connelly M.A. de la Llera-Moya M. Monzo P. Yancey P.G. Drazul D.

Chem. 2002; 277: 34042-34047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Treatment of hepatocytes with lactacystin, a specific inhibitor of proteasomal degradation, inhibited turnover of PDZK1 in wild-type littermates but not in hepatocytes from SPAP transgenic mice, indicating a physiological role of the proteasome pathway in the regulation of turnover of PDZK1. However, PDZK1 steady-state levels in wild-type hepatocytes treated with lactacystin were not significantly increased relative to PDZK1 in untreated cells. In addition, steady-state levels of PDZK1 are undetectable in livers and isolated hepatocytes from SPAP transgenic mice. These data suggest that proteasome-mediated degradation of PDZK1 may account for only a small pool of cellular PDZK1, namely newly synthesized PDZK1, whereas other pathways, such as that mediated by SPAP, may play a major role in PDZK1 turnover. Turnover of a single protein by multiple degradation pathways has been reported. For example, newly synthesized cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, a known in vivo partner of PDZK1 in kidney (12Wang S. Yue H. Derin R.B. Guggino W.B. Li M. Cell. 2000; 103: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), is degraded by the proteasome, whereas CFTR that reaches the plasma membrane can undergo rapid endocytosis and sorting to the lysosome for degradation (41Gelman M.S. Kopito R.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1591-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The nature of the SPAP-mediated PDZK1 degradation pathway will be explored in future studies. Lastly, we showed that livers of SPAP transgenic mice are deficient in SR-BI, correlating with markedly increased plasma HDL levels in SPAP transgenic mice. Interestingly, PDZK1 has a putative PEST sequence (identified by the program PESTfind (42Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1959) Google Scholar); PEST score of +12.63; threshold of significance is +5.0) located between amino acids 350 and 374, which is between PDZ domains 3 and 4. PEST sequences are proline-, glutamate-, serine-, and threonine-rich sequences that are signals for proteasome-mediated degradation (43Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). Whether the putative PEST sequence of PDZK1 is functional and required for the proteasome-mediated or SPAP-mediated degradation will be explored in future studies. Previously, we showed that a mutant SR-BI lacking the carboxyl-terminal PDZK1-interacting domain (SR-BIdle509) is not expressed on the cell surface of hepatocytes and is down-regulated by a post-transcriptional mechanism (17Silver D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34042-34047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). On the basis of that study, it was not unexpected that livers of SPAP transgenic mice would be deficient in SR-BI, and plasma HDL cholesterol would be increased. This result is supported by recent data showing that mice with targeted disruption of the PDZK1 gene have similarly increased plasma cholesterol (44Kocher O. Pal R. Roberts M. Cirovic C. Gilchrist A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) as SPAP transgenic mice. However, Kocher et al. (44Kocher O. Pal R. Roberts M. Cirovic C. Gilchrist A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1175-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) did not report levels of HDL cholesterol nor present a mechanism for increased plasma cholesterol in PDZK1 knock-out mice. In addition, our findings reveal that SR-BI expression in liver but not in other tissues, such as adrenal gland, plays a major role in regulating plasma HDL levels. The FPLC profile of plasma cholesterol was similar to that seen for SR-BI knock-out mice (26Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), with increased HDL3 and the appearance of large LDL-like HDL. This LDL-like HDL (fractions 17–20) is enriched in apoE. This apoE-rich HDL is what Krieger and co-workers (45Miettinen H.E. Rayburn H. Krieger M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) called “toxic” lipoproteins, which is proposed to be responsible for the infertility in female SR-BI knock-out mice. The majority of HDL appears to be of normal size, but increased in quantity, as indicated by increased HDL apolipoprotein (apoAI and apoE) content proportional to increased cholesterol (fractions 21–28). PDZK1 has four PDZ domains. Each may bind a specific protein at any given time, potentially forming a large macromolecular complex such as those found for other PDZ domain proteins (15Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). The reported PDZK1 binding partners are CFTR, which was shown to interact with PDZK1 in immunoprecipitation experiments from kidney extracts (12Wang S. Yue H. Derin R.B. Guggino W.B. Li M. Cell. 2000; 103: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), type IIa Na/Pi co-transporter (13Gisler S.M. Stagljar I. Traebert M. Bacic D. Biber J. Murer H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9206-9213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and the multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2; cMOAT) (46Kocher O. Comella N. Gilchrist A. Pal R. Tognazzi K. Brown L.F. Knoll J.H. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 1161-1170PubMed Google Scholar). Thus far, only CFTR has been shown to interact in vivo with PDZK1, whereas the other aforementioned proteins have been shown to interact with PDZK1 in yeast/two-hybrid assays. MRP2 deficiency (Dubin-Johnson syndrome) is characterized primarily by hyperbilirubinemia (47Keppler D. Konig J. Semin. Liver Dis. 2000; 20: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Mice with deficiency in radixin, the most abundant ERM (erzin, radixin, moesin) protein in liver, have a deficiency of MRP2 from the canalicular membrane and exhibit hyperbilirubinemia (48Kikuchi S. Hata M. Fukumoto K. Yamane Y. Matsui T. Tamura A. Yonemura S. Yamagishi H. Keppler D. Tsukita S. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). On the basis of the findings that PDZK1 is not localized to canalicular membranes in liver (14Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aoki J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6538-6543Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and that SPAP transgenic mice do not have hyperbilirubinemia (data not shown), despite PDZK1 deficiency, indicates that PDZK1 is not essential for MRP2 function in vivo in liver. We hypothesize that other PDZK1 partners may be similarly down-regulated, similar to SR-BI, or be mislocalized in livers of SPAP transgenic mice. Therefore, to generate a more complete mechanistic picture of the function of SPAP and PDZK1 in liver, it will be necessary to identify other partners of PDZK1 in liver. It is tempting to speculate that signals or factors that may regulate SPAP may contribute to variation in plasma HDL cholesterol levels by modulating PDZK1 and SR-BI levels in liver. In conclusion, we have identified SPAP (DD96/MAP17) as an in vivo partner of PDZK1 that may act as a regulator of cellular PDZK1 levels."

We employed the Affymetrix cDNA microarray system to detect genes whose expression is regulated by TGF-β1 in a human T cell line HuT78. Tristetraprolin (TTP), a protein involved in the degradation of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) mRNA, was found to be up-regulated by TGF-β. This up-regulation was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis that revealed a rapid and transient induction of TTP mRNA by TGF-β1 in HuT78 cells, primary human T cells, and THP-1 macrophage-monocyte cells. In addition, de novo protein synthesis was not required for this induction, suggesting that TTP is regulated by TGF-β at the transcriptional level. To delineate the transcriptional regulation of the TTP gene, a 2.7-kb human TTP promoter region (–2682 to +56 bp relative to the transcription initiation site) was isolated. We found that this promoter was stimulated by TGF-β1 or a constitutively active TGF-β type I receptor via TGF-β-specific Smad proteins. Furthermore, a series of TTP promoter deletion constructs were used to localize the Smad-responsive region to the –583 to –263 bp portion of the promoter. In this region, the TTP promoter contained a stretch of putative Smad-binding elements that had a synergistic effect in mediating Smad activation of the promoter. These putative Smad-binding element-containing sequences were also able to bind Smad3 and Smad4 proteins purified in vitro. As TGF-β- and TTP-deficient mice exhibit overlapping phenotypes manifested by multifocal inflammation and autoimmunity, our findings that TTP transcription is under the control of TGF-β signaling would indicate a potential role of TTP in mediating the immune suppressive action of TGF-β in vivo.

Roberts A.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 137-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1655) Google Scholar). TGF-β coordinates events critical to the progression and resolution of autoimmune-mediated inflammatory responses. This complex coordination involves recruitment of inflammatory cells, activation of lymphocytes, modulation of macrophage function, and expression of adhesion molecules by endothelial cells, monocytes, and lymphocytes. TGF-β affects a wide array of processes involved in T cell function including proliferation, apoptosis, antigen-presenting cell function, and differentiation (2Gorelik L. Flavell R.A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The immune suppressive function of TGF-β is elegantly illustrated by the in vivo studies in which TGF-β1 or Smad3, one of the critical proteins downstream of TGF-β receptors, are genetically disrupted in mouse. Targeted disruption of TGF-β1 or Smad3 in mice results in a severe and multifocal inflammatory response in all the pups that are born alive (3Shull M.M. Ormsby I. Kier A.B. Pawlowski S. Diebold R.J.

Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar). After ligand binding, the activated type I receptor relays the signal to Smad2 and Smad3 (pathway-specific Smads), which are activated by the kinase activity of the TGF-β type I receptor through phosphorylation at the C-terminal end (7Souchelnytskyi S. Tamaki K. Engstrom U. Wernstedt C. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28107-28115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 8Abdollah S. Macias-Silva M.

Upon phosphorylation, the pathway-specific Smads form hetero-oligomeric complexes with Smad4, the common mediator Smad (9Hahn S.A. Schutte M. Hoque A.T. Moskaluk C.A. da Costa L.T. Rozenblum E.

Nature. 1996; 383: 832-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). These complexes then migrate to the nucleus and activate gene transcription through either direct DNA binding by the Smad proteins or by their association with other sequence-specific transcription factors (11Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA binding ability of Smad proteins is mainly achieved by their MH1 domains, as indicated by the crystal structure of the Smad MH1 domain (12Shi Y. Wang Y.F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). For example, Smad3 and Smad4 have been shown to associate with a consensus palindromic motif GTCTAGAC (13Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Smad proteins may also stimulate transcription by associating with other sequence-specific transcription factors. For example, Smad2 and/or Smad3, when complexed with Smad4, may associate with Xenopus FAST-1 (forkhead activin signal transducer-1) to regulate Mix.2 gene transcription or mouse FAST-2 to regulate Goosecoid promoter (14Chen X.

The transactivating activity of Smad proteins is achieved by their MH2 domains, which interact with two closely related transcriptional coactivators, CBP and p300, that link specific transcription factors with the basal transcriptional machinery (16Janknecht R.

It is widely expressed with particularly high levels in spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus (19Lai W.S. Stumpo D.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16556-16563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies for the past few years have indicated that TTP is able to promote the turnover of certain mRNAs containing AU-rich elements in their 3′-untranslated regions (23Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). The mRNA of several cytokines that are important for immune response, inflammation, and hematopoiesis, such as TNF-α, interleukin-3β, and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor contain this class of AU-rich elements (class II AU-rich elements) (23Lai W.S.

Blood. 2000; 95: 1891-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of TTP in regulating immune response is clearly illustrated by gene deletion studies. TTP-deficient mice manifested inflammatory disorders characterized by cachexia, arthritis, and autoimmunities (25Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These phenotypes could be alleviated by treatment with antibodies to TNF-α, further indicating that TTP is a physiological regulator of TNF-α at the animal level.To further delineate the molecular mechanisms by which TGF-β regulates T cell functions, we employed a DNA microarray method to detect genes whose expression is regulated by TGF-β1 in HuT78 cells. The HuT78 cell line was originally established from a patient with mycosis fungoides and has been characterized as a model cell line for studying human T cell function (26Gootenberg J.E. Ruscetti F.W. Mier J.W. Gazdar A. Gallo R.C. J. Exp. Med. 1981; 154: 1403-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). HuT78 cells produce several cytokines typical for human Th0 cells in response to anti-CD3 and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation, such as interleukin-4 and interferon-γ (27Holter W. Kalthoff F.S. Pickl W.F. Ebner C. Majdic O. Kraft D. Knapp W. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As a result of the microarray analysis, we found that TTP was up-regulated by TGF-β treatment. To understand the mechanism underlying the regulation of TTP expression by TGF-β, we characterized the promoter of TTP and identified the Smad-responsive region in the promoter. These studies have indicated that TTP is a transcriptional target regulated by TGF-β signaling in T cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—RPMI 1640 medium, fetal bovine serum, and penicillin/streptomycin were purchased from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). Recombinant human TGF-β1 was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Recombinant human activin A was provided by the National Hormone and Pituitary Program (NHPP, Rockville, MD). Cycloheximide (CHX), and actinomycin-D were purchased from Sigma.Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—HuT78 and THP-1 cells were cultured at 5 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated (56 °C, 30 min) fetal bovine serum. Cells were seeded either in 12-well plates (Greiner, Lake Mary, FL) at 2 ml/well or 100-mm diameter dish (Greiner) at 10 ml/dish. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were cultured at 1.5 × 105 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates (Greiner) at 0.5 ml/well. For the culture of the primary human T cells, adult peripheral blood were obtained from the local blood center (Central Indiana Regional Blood Center). Buffy coats collected from whole blood by centrifugation were mixed with an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline. The mixture was layered over Ficoll-Paque Plus (Amersham Biosciences), and cells at the interface were collected. T cells were purified by negative selection with the use of a combination of monoclonal antibodies and complement (Lympho-Kwik; One Lambda, Canoga Park, CA). The T cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were then activated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 for 3 days at concentrations of 1 and 0.5 μg/ml, respectively. The purity of the resulting activated T cells exceeded 90%. Transient cell transfection was performed by a SuperFect reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) for HuT78 cells and the calcium phosphate method for HEK293 cells. The TNF-α level in the THP-1 culture medium was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit following the enclosed protocol (BioSource International, Inc.).Microarray Analysis—HuT78 cells were cultured in a 100-mm diameter dish in the presence or absence of TGF-β1 (1.25 ng/ml) for 90 min. Total RNA from these cells was isolated using RNeasy (Qiagen). Preparation of cRNA, hybridization, and scanning of the human genes U95A arrays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The arrays were scanned at 3 mm with the GeneArray scanner (Affymetrix). The chips of Human Genome U95Av2 array were used and they represent about 12,000 sequences previously characterized in terms of function or disease association.RNA Isolation and cDNA Synthesis—RNA from HuT78 cells was isolated using RNeasy (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). One μg of the recovered RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD) to remove the residual DNA, and reverse transcribed in a 25-μl volume reaction with oligo(dT) primer using the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) to generate first strand cDNA. The products were diluted to a final volume of 1000 μl. Diluted cDNA was stored at –80 °C until used for PCR.PCR—The oligonucleotides used for PCR reactions to detect the expression of TTP, Smad7, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) are shown in Table I. PCR reactions were performed in a total volume of 10 μl containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 1.0–2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm each dNTP, 1 μm each primer, 1.0 unit of TaqDNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), and 2 μl of previously diluted reverse transcription reaction. The thermal cycling parameters consisted of denaturing at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 56 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 45 s for 20 to 35 cycles. The PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gels in 0.5× TAE and visualized with ethidium bromide (EtBr).Table ISequence of oligonucleotides used for PCRTranscriptPrimerLocationSequence (5′ to 3′)ProductbpGAPDH5′301-322GTCTTCACCACCATGGAGAAGG5663′854-866TCGCTGTTGAAGTCAGAGGAGASmad75′531-552GTGTTGCTGTGAATCTTACGGG6723′1181-1202TTCACAAAGCTGATCTGCACGGTTP5′491-510TCATCCACAACCCTAGCGAA4763′947-966GATGCGATTGAAGATGGGGA Open table in a new tab Competitive RT-PCR—Competitive RT-PCR was performed as described previously with minor modifications (28Ogawa K. Funaba M. Mathews L.S. Mizutani T. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2997-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Competitor template for the human GAPDH gene (284 bp) was synthesized by overlap extension PCR of native PCR product (566 bp) and cloned into the pBluescript vector. The deletion mutant was then amplified by PCR with the original primers and the resultant competitor template was purified by GenElute PCR DNA Purification Kit (Sigma) and the concentration was determined by absorbance at 260 nm. A constant amount of competitor template was co-amplified with reverse-transcribed samples or varying amounts of the target cDNA standard using the specific primers. Following amplification, the competitor and the target products were separated on a 2% agarose gel in TAE buffer and visualized with EtBr. The band intensity was quantified using densitometric analysis by the NIH Image program. The log ratios of the amplified competitor and the target were plotted against the initial target in a standard curve. The amount of the mRNA in samples was deduced from the equation of the linear regression of this plot.Plasmid and GST Fusion Proteins—Different lengths of human TTP promoter were PCR-amplified and subcloned into pGL3-basic luciferase vector (Promega). Deletion mutant constructs were generated by overlap extension PCR followed by subcloning into pGL3-basic. The Smad expression plasmids and the constitutively active TGF-β type I receptor plasmid have been described previously (29Chen Y. Lebrun J.J. Vale W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The C-terminal truncated (ΔMH2) GST fusion proteins of Smad3 and Smad4 were generated by in-frame fusion of the N-terminal region of Smad cDNA with pGEX-4T2 (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (31Li W. Chen F. Nagarajan R.P. Liu X. Chen Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1163-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 strain (Amersham Biosciences), and the GST fusion proteins were purified according to the manufacturer's protocol.Promoter Assay—HuT78 cells or HEK293 cells were transfected with different combinations of plasmid DNA. A Renilla luciferase vector, phRL-SV40, was cotransfected to serve as an internal control for transfection efficiency. The cells were harvested at 36 h after transfection by lysis with 200 μl of TNEN lysis buffer. In TGF-β-treated groups, cells were treated with TGF-β1 (1.25 ng/ml) for 6 h before harvest. Ten microliters of the lysate was used for the dual luciferase assay (Promega). The samples were counted for 10 s in a FB12 luminometer (Zylux), and the data were represented as the relative light unit/s.Gel Mobility Shift Assay—Double stranded oligonucleotides were labeled with [32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. The probes (about 5 × 104 cpm) were incubated with about 0.2 μg of GST or GST-Smad fusion proteins in a buffer containing a final concentration of 4% glycerol, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1 μg/μl poly(dI-dC). The nuclear extracts were prepared from HuT78 cells as previously described by others (32Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar). The reaction was incubated on ice for 1 h and then separated by 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE and detected by autoradiography.RESULTSTGF-β Augments TTP mRNA Level in HuT78 Cells in cDNA Microarray Assay—To explore the molecular mechanisms by which TGF-β regulates T cells, we used a cDNA microarray method to analyze genes regulated by TGF-β in HuT78 cells. To catch the “immediate” response by TGF-β treatment, these cells were treated with TGF-β1 (1.25 ng/ml) for 90 min and the isolated total RNA preparation was applied to microarray analysis. The Human Genome U95Av2 array chips from Affymetrix were used and these chips contain about 12,000 sequences previously characterized in terms of function or disease association. To assure the accuracy of the data, four individual sample preparations were used for either control or TGF-β-treated cells. The relative expression level of these ∼12,000 genes was detected and used in statistical analysis (t test) to reveal genes significantly changed by TGF-β. We found that a total of 107 genes are significantly altered by TGF-β, with 75 of them being increased and 32 of them decreased (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, about 27% genes up-regulated by TGF-β are involved in transcriptional regulation, indicating that these transcription factors may relay, propagate, and amplify the biological functions of TGF-β through subsequent transcriptional control. In addition, about 23% of the genes regulated by TGF-β are involved in signal transduction pathways that regulate a variety of biological functions in lymphocytes. The up-regulated genes include those previously identified to be transcriptional targets of TGF-β signaling, such as JunB (33Jonk L.J.C. Itoh S. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Kruijer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21145-21152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (34Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar), and Smad7 (30Nagarajan R.P. Zhang J. Li W. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33412-33418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the expression level of TTP was also significantly elevated by TGF-β treatment in these cells (Fig. 1B).Rapid and Transient Induction of TTP by TGF-β1—To further evaluate the effect of TGF-β and activin on TTP expression in HuT78 cells, we used RT-PCR to analyze the change in the TTP mRNA level. HuT78 cells were treated with TGF-β1 (1.25 ng/ml) or activin (20 ng/ml) and total RNA was isolated at different time points. The reverse-transcribed cDNA was first subjected to quantitative competitive RT-PCR analysis of the housekeeping gene GAPDH to determine the relative mRNA amount. A representative standard curve from competitive PCR for GAPDH is shown in Fig. 2A, in which a constant amount of competitor was co-amplified with varying concentrations of GAPDH cDNA and the intensity of the band corresponding to the competitor was decreased with increasing GAPDH cDNA (Fig. 2A, upper panel). The plot of competitor to target ratio against concentration of GAPDH cDNA exhibited a linear relationship (Fig. 2A, lower panel). No significant difference was found in GAPDH mRNA levels among all RT samples (Fig. 2B), indicating that the relative amounts of RNA were consistent among those samples. Next, changes in TTP mRNA levels in response to TGF-β and activin treatment were analyzed by RT-PCR using specific primers. Activin is another member of the TGF-β superfamily and plays an important role in regulating follicle stimulating hormone secretion in anterior pituitary (35Gaddy-Kurten D. Tsuchida K. Vale W. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1995; 50: 109-129PubMed Google Scholar). Activin shares several overlapping biological activities with TGF-β, partly because of the fact that both of them utilize the same Smad proteins in signaling transduction (36Moustakas A. Souchelnytskyi S. Heldin C.H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4359-4369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, GAPDH and Smad7 were also measured as an internal standard and a positive control, respectively. The intensities of the PCR products of Smad7 and TTP were normalized to GAPDH levels. The expression of TTP was increased by either TGF-β or activin and exhibited a similar time course as that of Smad7, peaking at 1 to 2 h after stimulation. Therefore, this experiment clearly indicated that TGF-β and activin were able to induce a fast and transient induction of the TTP mRNA level in HuT78 cells.Fig. 2Rapid and transient induction of TTP mRNA by TGF-β and activin in HuT78 cells. Total RNAs from HuT78 cells treated with TGF-β (1.25 ng/ml) or activin A (20 ng/ml) were isolated at different time points, and were reverse transcribed. The RT samples were first subjected to quantitative competitive RT-PCR analysis of the housekeeping gene GAPDH. The samples were then used in RT-PCR using specific primers for Smad7 and TTP. A, competitive RT-PCR of the GAPDH mRNA using competitor template. A constant amount (0.1 atto mole) of competitor was co-amplified with varying concentrations of target cDNA (upper panel). The log ratios of the amplified competitor and target cDNA were plotted against the concentration of the target used in each reaction (lower panel). B, GAPDH mRNA levels in RT samples of TGF-β- or activin-treated HuT78 cells measured by competitive-RT-PCR. C, changes of TTP and Smad7 mRNA levels in response to TGF-β and activin treatment as analyzed by RT-PCR.

As shown in Fig. 3, TGF-β1 treatment in these two types of cells was able to exert a transient and rapid induction of TTP, similar to what was found in HuT78 cells. These data suggested that TGF-β is able to induce TTP in multiple types of cell.Fig. 3Induction of TTP mRNA by TGF-β in primary human T cells and THP-1 cells. The primary human T cells and THP-1 cells were treated with TGF-β (12.5 and 1.25 ng/ml, respectively) at different time points and the total RNA was isolated for RT-PCR. The intensities of the PCR products of TTP were normalized to GAPDH (G3PDH) levels and plotted against the duration of treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)De Novo Protein Synthesis Is Not Required for TTP Induction by TGF-β—We next investigated whether or not the induction of TTP by TGF-β requires new protein synthesis by analyzing the effect of CHX, a protein synthesis inhibitor, on the TTP mRNA level. HuT78 cells were treated with TGF-β in the presence or absence of CHX (10 μg/ml, 1 h prior) or a RNA synthesis inhibitor, actinomycin-D (5 mg/ml, 15 min prior), for 2 h. Total RNA was isolated and subjected to competitive and regular RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 4A, the mRNA level of the housekeeping gene, GAPDH, was relatively constant among different data points as measured by competitive RT-PCR. The induction of TTP and Smad7 in response to TGF-β with or without CHX is shown in Fig. 4, B and C. In the presence of CHX, the mRNA levels of TTP and Smad7 were both stimulated by TGF-β treatment (at 20 cycles of PCR for TTP and 25 cycles for Smad7), indicating that new protein synthesis is not required for the induction of TTP and Smad7. In addition, the induction of TTP and Smad7 was diminished in the presence of actinomycin-D, suggesting that active transcription is necessary for TGF-β-mediated stimulation of these genes.Fig. 4New protein synthesis is not required for TTP induction with TGF-β in HuT78 cells. HuT78 cells were treated with TGF-β1 (1.25 ng/ml) for 2 h in the presence or absence of CHX (10 μg/ml, 1 h prior to TGF-β treatment) or D-actinomycin (D-act; 5 μg/ml, 15 min prior to TGF-β treatment). Total RNAs were isolated and subjected to competitive RT-PCR. A, GAPDH (G3PDH) mRNA levels measured by competitive RT-PCR. Me2SO (DMSO) was used as a mock treatment.

https://openalex.org/W2059718682,"Although the contribution of basic residues of exosite-1 to the catalytic function of thrombin has been studied extensively, their role in the specificity of prothrombin recognition by factor Xa in the prothrombinase complex (factor Xa, factor Va, phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine vesicles, and Ca2+) has not been examined. In this study, we prepared several mutants of prethrombin-1 (prothrombin lacking Gla and Kringle-1 domains) in which basic residues of this site (Arg35, Lys36, Arg67, Lys70, Arg73, Arg75, and Arg77 in chymotrypsinogen numbering) were individually substituted with a Glu. Following expression in mammalian cells and purification to homogeneity, these mutants were characterized with respect to their ability to function as zymogens for both factor Xa and the prothrombinase complex. Factor Xa by itself exhibited similar catalytic activity toward both the wild type and mutant substrates; however, its activity in the prothrombinase complex toward most of mutants was severely impaired. Further kinetic studies in the presence of Tyr63-sulfated hirudin-(54–65) peptide suggested that although the peptide inhibits the prothrombinase activation of the wild type zymogen with a K D of 0.5–0.7 μm, it is ineffective in inhibiting the activation of mutant zymogens (K D = 2–30 μm). These results suggest that basic residues of proexosite-1 on prothrombin are factor Va-dependent recognition sites for factor Xa in the prothrombinase complex. Although the contribution of basic residues of exosite-1 to the catalytic function of thrombin has been studied extensively, their role in the specificity of prothrombin recognition by factor Xa in the prothrombinase complex (factor Xa, factor Va, phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine vesicles, and Ca2+) has not been examined.

These results suggest that basic residues of proexosite-1 on prothrombin are factor Va-dependent recognition sites for factor Xa in the prothrombinase complex. Prothrombin is a vitamin K-dependent serine protease zymogen that is proteolytically converted to thrombin by the prothrombinase complex (factor Xa, cofactor Va, negatively charged phospholipid vesicles, and Ca2+) in the final step of the blood clotting cascade (1Mann K.G.

Factor Xa specifically catalyzes the cleavage of two peptide bonds after the two basic residues, Arg273 and Arg322, to convert prothrombin to thrombin (1Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Although factor Xa by itself can catalyze the cleavage of both peptide bonds on the substrate, its catalytic efficiency is improved by greater than 5 orders of magnitude when it is assembled into the prothrombinase complex (1Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 3Rosing J. Tans G. Govers-Riemslag J.W.P. Zwaal R.F.A.Z. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 274-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Results of several kinetic studies have indicated that such a dramatic improvement in the rate of prothrombin activation by the prothrombinase complex is derived from an ∼100-fold decrease in the apparent K m and a greater than 1000-fold enhancement in the k cat of the activation reaction (3Rosing J.

Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The improvement in the apparent K m of the activation reaction is mediated through the Ca2+-dependent assembly of both prothrombin and factor Xa on negatively charged membrane surfaces via their N-terminal Gla domains (3Rosing J.

Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the improvement in the k cat of the activation reaction is believed to arise from the factor Va-mediated protein-protein interaction between factor Xa and prothrombin in the prothrombinase complex (7Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Boskovic D.S. Giles A.R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10497-10505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The mechanism of the factor Va-mediated protein-protein interaction that improves the catalytic efficiency of factor Xa in the prothrombinase complex is under intensive investigation. Based on recent kinetic data, it has been hypothesized that factor Va binding to factor Xa allosterically exposes a secondary binding site”exosite“remote from the catalytic pocket on the protease that is a specific recognition site for interaction with the prothrombin lacking the Gla and both Kringle-1 and -2 domain (prethrombin-2) 1The abbreviations used are: prethrombin-2, prothrombin lacking the Gla and both Kringle-1 and -2 domains; prethrombin-1, prothrombin mutant in which the Gla and Kringle-1 domains have been deleted by recombinant DNA methods; TM, thrombomodulin; TM4–6, TM fragment containing the epidermal growth factor-like domains 4, 5, and 6; GPR-pNA, N-p-tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PS, phosphatidylserine; Hir, hirudin.1The abbreviations used are: prethrombin-2, prothrombin lacking the Gla and both Kringle-1 and -2 domains; prethrombin-1, prothrombin mutant in which the Gla and Kringle-1 domains have been deleted by recombinant DNA methods; TM, thrombomodulin; TM4–6, TM fragment containing the epidermal growth factor-like domains 4, 5, and 6; GPR-pNA, N-p-tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PS, phosphatidylserine; Hir, hirudin. portions of the substrate (9Betz A. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In support of this hypothesis, it has been demonstrated that factor Va enhances the k cat of both prothrombin and prethrombin-2 activation by factor Xa to a similar extent (9Betz A. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 10Rezaie A.R. Yang L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1528: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The putative cofactor-mediated interaction sites, on either the protease or the substrate, have not been identified. However, an active site inhibited thrombin and a C-terminal fragment derived from the cleavage of thrombin by chymotrypsin at Trp148 have been shown to inhibit competitively the activation of prethrombin-2 by factor Xa in the prothrombinase complex (9Betz A. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Based on such results, it has been hypothesized that the factor Va-mediated factor Xa interactive site on prothrombin is located on the protease domain that does not include either the fibrinogen recognition (exosite-1) or the heparin-binding site (exosite-2) (9Betz A. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).Other studies (11Dharmawardana K.R. Bock P.E.

Thus, an alternative hypothesis for the mechanism of the cofactor function of factor Va is that the cofactor in the prothrombinase complex may provide a binding site for direct interaction with the proexosite-1 of prothrombin (13Anderson P.J.

In support of this hypothesis, it has been demonstrated that the factor Va-mediated acceleration of prothrombin activation by the prothrombinase complex can be specifically inhibited by an exosite-1-specific peptide ligand derived from the C-terminal domain of the leech inhibitor, hirudin (14Anderson P.J.

This site has several basic residues that can interact with nearly all natural substrates, inhibitors, and cofactors of thrombin including fibrinogen, factors V and VIII, PAR-1, heparin cofactor II, and thrombomodulin (TM) (15Fenton II, J.W.

Despite an extensive characterization of basic residues of exosite-1 in thrombin, the contribution of these residues to the specificity of prothrombin recognition by factor Xa in the prothrombinase complex has not been studied. In this study, we substituted all basic residues of this site including Arg35, Lys36, Arg67, Lys70, Arg73, Arg75, and Arg77 (chymotrypsinogen numbering (24Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R.

Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Following purification to homogeneity, the properties of mutant proteins were analyzed with respect to their ability to function as zymogens for factor Xa in both the absence and presence of factor Va on phospholipid vesicles. It was discovered that whereas factor Xa activates the wild type and prethrombin-1 mutant zymogens with a comparable rate in the absence of factor Va, the protease exhibits a dramatic catalytic defect toward mutant substrates in the presence of the cofactor. Further kinetic studies in the presence of the proexosite-specific peptide, Tyr63-sulfated hirudin-(54–65) (Hir-(54–65)(SO3- ), suggested that the hirudin peptide inhibits the prothrombinase activation of prethrombin-1 with a K D of 0.7 μm. However, the competitive inhibitory effect of the hirudin peptide in the prothrombinase activation of mutants was impaired at varying degrees, which correlated well with the extent of impairments observed in the activation of mutant zymogens. These results suggest that basic residues of proexosite-1 are specific recognition sites for factor Xa in the prothrombinase complex. Interestingly, we also discovered that the epidermal growth factor-like domains 4–6 of TM (TM4–6) can inhibit the prothrombinase activation of prethrombin-1 with a K D of 0.5 μm. The possible physiological significance of this finding is discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction and Expression of Mutant Proteins—The expression of wild type prethrombin-1 (prothrombin lacking both Gla and Kringle-1 domains) and prethrombin-2 (prothrombin lacking Gla, Kringle-1, and Kringle-2 domains) by the pNUT-PL2 expression/purification vector system in baby hamster kidney cells has been described previously (10Rezaie A.R.

In the absence factor Va, the time course of activation of each prethrombin-1 derivative (2 μm) by factor Xa (5 nm) was measured at room temperature in 0.1 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, and 2.5 mm CaCl2 (TBS/Ca2+). At different time intervals, small aliquots of activation reactions were transferred to wells of a 96-well assay plate containing 20 mm EDTA, and the rate of thrombin generation was determined from the cleavage of S2238 (100 μm) at 405 nm by a V max Kinetic Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). The concentration of thrombin generated was determined from standard curves prepared from the cleavage rate of S2238 (100 μm) by known concentrations of wild type and mutant thrombins. In the presence of factor Va, the concentration dependence of prethrombin-1 (0.3–20 μm) activation by human factor Xa (0.05–1 nm) in complex with a saturating concentration of human factor Va (30 nm) was measured on PC/PS vesicles (35 μm) in TBS/Ca2+. After 1–30 min of incubation at room temperature, the reactions were terminated by addition of EDTA, and the initial rate of thrombin generation was measured from the cleavage rate of S2238 as described above. The apparent K m and k cat values for prethrombin-1 activation were calculated from the Michaelis-Menten equation. It was ensured that the factor Va concentration (30 nm) was in excess in all activation reactions. Thus, the factor Va (0.1–10 nm) concentration dependence of activation reactions by factor Xa (0.2 nm) were carried out on PC/PS vesicles (35 μm) in TBS/Ca2+ using 1 μm wild type or mutant prethrombin-1. The K d(app) values were calculated from hyperbolic dependence of activation rates on the concentrations of factor Va as described (29Rezaie A.R. He X. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1817-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In all reactions, it was ensured that less than 10% of prethrombin-1 was activated at all concentrations of the substrates.Prethrombin-1 Activation in the Presence of Hir-(54–65)-(SO3- )—The inhibitory effect of the hirudin peptide on the kinetics of prethrombin-1 and prethrombin-2 activation by both factor Xa and prothrombinase was studied. Thus, the rate of activation of each prethrombin-1 derivative (1 μm) by factor Xa alone (5 nm) or factor Xa (0.05–1 nm) in complex with factor Va (30 nm) on PC/PS vesicles was monitored in the presence of increasing concentrations of the hirudin peptide in the same TBS/Ca2+ buffer system. The concentration of thrombin generated in each reaction was calculated from standard curves as described above except that GPR-pNA was used as the chromogenic substrate because the cleavage rate of this substrate has been reported not to be affected by the occupancy of exosite-1 by the hirudin peptide (18Liu L. Vu T.H. Esmon C.T. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16977-16980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To simplify comparisons of the hirudin peptide dependence of the activation reactions, the data for all activation reactions were normalized to maximal thrombin generation in the absence of the peptide. The dissociation constants (K D) for the interaction of the hirudin peptide with prethrombin-1 was calculated from Equations 1 and 2 as described (14Anderson P.J. Nesset A. Dharmawardana K.R.

The quadratic binding equation assumes that the concentration of prethrombin-1 in complex with either factor Xa or factor Va is small enough to be neglected under experimental conditions where [Pre-1]o is in excess of the initial concentrations of both the enzyme and the cofactor (14Anderson P.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 16435-16442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).Cleavage of Chromogenic Substrates—Approximately 1 mg of each prethrombin-1 derivative was activated to completion, and thrombin mutants were purified by cation exchange chromatography on a Mono S column using a linear gradient of 0.1–0.6 m NaCl as described (25Rezaie A.R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The concentrations of thrombin mutants were determined by their absorbance at 280 nm, assuming a molecular mass of 36.6 kDa and an extinction coefficient (E1cm1&x0025; ) of 17.1 and by stoichiometric titrations with a known concentration of antithrombin as described (25Rezaie A.R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The steady-state kinetics of hydrolysis of S2238 (1.5–100 μm) by thrombin derivatives (0.5 nm) were studied in TBS/Ca2+ as described (25Rezaie A.R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The rate of hydrolysis was measured at 405 nm at room temperature in a V max Kinetic Microplate Reader as described above. The K m and k cat values for the chromogenic substrate hydrolysis were calculated from the Michaelis-Menten equation, and the catalytic efficiencies were expressed as the ratios of k cat/K m.RESULTSExpression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Wild type and mutant prethrombin-1 derivatives were expressed in baby hamster kidney cells using the pNUT-PL2 expression/purification vector system as described previously (26Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7437-7446Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). All recombinant proteins were purified to homogeneity by an immunoaffinity chromatography using the Ca2+-dependent monoclonal antibody HPC4 as described (26Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7437-7446Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Except for elevated K m(app) values, factor Xa in the prothrombinase complex activates both prethrombin-1 and prethrombin-2 with similar and normal V max values (10Rezaie A.R. Yang L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1528: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 30Krishnaswamy S. Walker R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, these truncated substrates are ideal reagents for probing the extent that protein-protein interactions in the prothrombinase complex contribute to the high specificity of the catalytic reaction.Amidolytic Activity—Because the zymogenic properties of prethrombin-1 mutants by the prothrombinase complex are studied from the initial rate of thrombin generation in an amidolytic activity assay, it was essential to determine the kinetic parameters for the cleavage of the chromogenic substrate S2238 by mutant thrombins. Thus, following activation and purification on a Mono S column, the concentration of the active site of mutants was determined by stoichiometric titration with antithrombin as described (25Rezaie A.R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The concentration of active enzymes correlated well with the concentration of substrates determined based on their absorbance at 280 nm (within 90–100%). Kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of S2238 are presented in Table I. With the exception of the K70E mutant, which exhibited a dramatically impaired K m value, all other mutants cleaved S2238 with kinetic constants that were similar to those observed for wild type thrombin. These results strongly suggest that with the exception of K70E, the mutations did not adversely affect the folding, charge stabilizing system, or the reactivity of the catalytic pockets of mutant enzymes. The interaction of p-aminobenzamidine with the K70E mutant was also impaired ∼3-fold (K i = 38 and 107 μm for wild type and mutant thrombin, respectively). Thus, the conformation of the P3-P1 binding pocket of the K70E mutant must have been altered.Table IKinetic constants for the cleavage of the chromogenic substrate S2238 by thrombin derivativesKmkcatk cat/KmμMs-1μM s-1WT6.4 ± 0.499.7 ± 7.916 ± 2R35E4.9 ± 0.4108.1 ± 10.222 ± 4R35A3.9 ± 0.897.7 ± 7.925 ± 7K36E4.9 ± 0.293.3 ± 4.819 ± 2R67E4.9 ± 0.4113.0 ± 10.923 ± 4K70E205 ± 1592.5 ± 2.20.45 ± 0.04R73E5.1 ± 1.196.7 ± 4.919 ± 5R75E6.3 ± 0.4123.8 ± 11.620 ± 3R77E5.8 ± 0.5116.4 ± 11.920 ± 4 Open table in a new tab Prethrombin-1 Activation by Factor Xa and the Prothrombinase Complex—The initial rate of activation of prethrombin-1 derivatives by factor Xa was studied both in the absence and presence of factor Va on PC/PS vesicles. As shown in Fig. 1A, factor Xa exhibited similar activity toward both the wild type and mutant zymogens in the absence of factor Va. However, the activation of all mutants by factor Xa in the prothrombinase complex was markedly impaired (Fig. 1B). The concentration dependence of zymogen activation indicated that the prothrombinase complex activated wild type prethrombin-1 with apparent K m and k cat values of 9.1 ± 0.7 μm and 1529 ± 56 mol/min/mol, respectively. In the case of mutants, these values could only be determined for the R75E mutant (17.1 ± 2.8 μm and 913 ± 87 mol/min/mol) because the rate of thrombin generation was dramatically impaired and remained linear for up to 20 μm substrate (the highest concentration available) for all other mutants (Fig. 1B).Because the saturation of the initial rate of activation was not feasible with mutant substrates for the kinetic analysis, the overall extent of impairment with each proexosite-1 mutant residue was estimated from the initial rate of activation of a limiting concentration of each mutant substrate (at least 10-fold below K m values) in the presence of increasing concentrations of factor Va on PC/PS vesicles. A saturable dependence of thrombin generation on factor Va concentrations was observed yielding both K d(app) values for the factor Xa-factor Va interaction and the maximum rate of thrombin generation with all derivatives. The results presented in Table II suggested that although the K d(app) for the enzyme-cofactor interaction was independent of the substrate, the second-order rate of thrombin generation was impaired at varying degrees with all mutant substrates. The most impairment (75–150-fold) was observed with R67E and K70E mutants. The activation of all other mutants was impaired 4–18-fold (Table II). These results clearly suggest that none of the mutant residues under study interact with factor Xa in the absence of factor Va; however, they are critical recognition sites for the cofactor and/or the protease in the prothrombinase complex.Table IIKinetic constants for interaction of factor Xa with factor Va (Kd(app)), maximum rate of thrombin generation (V), and dissociation constants (KD) for binding of Hir-(54–65)-(SO3-) to prethromnin-1 derivativesK d(app)VKDnMnM/min/nMμMWT1.5 ± 0.2104.2 ± 4.50.7 ± 0.1R35E1.1 ± 0.114.8 ± 0.22.3 ± 0.2K36E0.9 ± 0.17.0 ± 0.319.3 ± 8.4R67E0.7 ± 0.21.4 ± 0.1NDK70E0.8 ± 0.20.7 ± 0.1NDR73E1.5 ± 0.111.0 ± 0.433.3 ± 14.9R75E1.2 ± 0.128.8 ± 1.05.1 ± 0.8R77E0.8 ± 0.15.8 ± 0.211.6 ± 3.8 Open table in a new tab Inhibition of Activation by Hir-(54–65)-(SO3- )—The Tyr63-sulfated hirudin peptide is proven to be a useful probe to analyze the interaction of different ligands with exosite-1 of thrombin (15Fenton II, J.W.

Thus, to determine whether the loss of specific interactions of proexosite-1 residues with prothrombinase accounts for the defective catalytic reactions with different prethrombin-1 derivatives, the initial rates of activation of mutant substrates were measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of the hirudin peptide. The results presented in Fig. 2A and Table II indicated that the hirudin peptide inhibits the initial rate of wild type prethrombin-1 activation with a K D of 0.7 μm. However, the ability of the peptide to inhibit activation of prethrombin-1 mutants was impaired at varying degrees. Interestingly, the degree of impairment in K D values correlated well with the degree of impairment in the observed activation rates of mutant substrates. Thus, the hirudin peptide exhibited no inhibitory effect toward the prothrombinase activation of either R67E or K70E mutants which were also ineffect"

Previously we demonstrated that in addition to these functions, p53 expression affects cell morphology and lamellar activity of the cell edge (Alexandrova, A., Ivanov, A., Chumakov, P. M., Kopnin, P.

We found that loss of p53 function correlated with decreased cell migration that was analyzed by in vitro wound closure test and Boyden chamber assay. The decreased motility of p53-deficient cells was observed in different cell contexts: human foreskin fibroblasts (BJ), human colon and lung carcinoma cell lines (HCT116 and H1299, respectively), as well as mouse normal fibroblasts from lung and spleen, peritoneal macrophages, and keratinocytes. On the other hand, overexpression of the p53 family member p73α stimulated cell migration. Changes in cell migration correlated directly with transcription activation induced by p53 or p73α. Noteworthy, p53 modulated cell motility in the absence of stress. The effect of p53 and p73α on cell migration was mediated through the activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Rac1 pathway. This p53/p73 function was mainly associated with some modulation of intracellular signaling rather than with stimulation of production of secreted motogenic factors.

The p53 tumor suppressor is an essential component of an emergency stress-response mechanism that prevents growth and survival of damaged and abnormal cells. Various genotoxic stresses induce functional activity of p53, which consequently stimulates transcription of a set of genes involved in cell cycle checkpoints (p21waf1/cip1, gadd45, 14-3-3σ, etc.) and apoptosis (insulin growth factor-binding protein 3, bax, fas/APO1, killer/DR5, Noxa, PIG3, etc.) (reviewed in Refs. 2el-Deiry W.S.

Although the physiological significance of the p53/p73-mediated up-regulation of the above target genes remains unclear, these data suggest involvement of p53 and p73 in the control of cell migration. Cell migration is a key aspect of many normal and abnormal biological processes, including embryonic development, protection from infections, wound healing, and metastasis of tumor cells. It is generally accepted that the driving force for the cell movement is provided by the dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, directing protrusion at the front of the cell and retraction at the rear. Cooperative action of small GTPases, particularly Rho, Cdc42, and Rac, is required to promote coordinated assembly and disassembly of actin filaments. Rho maintains cell adhesion during the movement and regulates the assembly of contractile actin-myosin filaments to form stress fibers. Cdc42 is required to maintain cell polarity, which includes localization of lamellipodial activity to the leading edge and the reorientation of the Golgi apparatus in the direction of the movement. Rac is necessary for the protrusion of lamellipodia and for the forward movement (reviewed in Refs. 28Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar and 29Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2713-2722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that overexpression of exogenous p53 in mouse fibroblasts causes diminution of focal contacts and an increase in lamellar activity of the cell edge that was paradoxically accompanied by inhibition of cell migration into the wound in vitro rather than by its stimulation (1Alexandrova A. Ivanov A. Chumakov P.M. Kopnin P.B. Vasiliev J.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5826-5830Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We explained such an effect by “skidding” of fibroblasts expressing high levels of exogenous p53 due to their inability to form effective focal contacts because of p53-induced repression of fibronectin production (1Alexandrova A. Ivanov A. Chumakov P.M. Kopnin P.B. Vasiliev J.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5826-5830Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The goal of this work was to study the effect of physiological levels of p53 on the Rho GTPase activity and cell migration in various cell contexts.

The HCT116, HCT116 p53–/–, and H1299 sublines with introduced empty pBabe/puro or pPS/hygro vectors were used as a control. Normal human foreskin fibroblasts BJ (ATCC CRL-2522) with inhibited p53 expression were obtained by infection with lentivirus vector pLV-si-p53-GFP expressing hairpin transcript corresponding to 19 bp of human p53 cDNA under the control of H1 RNA promoter and GFP under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The H1299tet/wt-p53 and 10(1)tet/wt-p53 cell lines with tetracycline-repressible expression of the exogenous p53 have been described previously (32Pugacheva E.N. Ivanov A.V. Kravchenko J.E. Kopnin B.P. Levine A.J. Chumakov P.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4595-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Normal lung and spleen fibroblasts, peritoneal macrophages, and tail keratinocytes were isolated from 8-week-old wild type (p53+/+) or homozygous p53 gene knockout (p53–/–) C57BL mice obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. All the cells except keratinocytes were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Fetaclone). The keratinocytes were cultured in keratinocyte/serum-free medium (Invitrogen) containing bovine pituitary extract (30 μg/ml, Invitrogen), recombinant EGF (0.1 ng/ml, Invitrogen), and 0.02 mm CaCl2. The H1299tet/wt-p53 and 10(1)tet/wt-p53 cells were grown in the presence of tetracycline (2 μg/ml). Boyden Chamber Assay—Boyden chamber cell migration assay was performed using transwell chambers with 8-μm pore size membranes (BD Biosciences). The chambers were inserted into 24-well culture plates containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with either 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 10% FBS, 100 ng/ml EGF (Invitrogen), or conditioned media. To prepare the conditioned media, equal quantities of the cells were plated for 48 h before harvesting the culture media. After collection of the conditioned media, the cells were harvested and counted again. To equalize the conditioned media they were diluted in proportion to the cell quantities. The cells (5 × 104) were loaded into the upper volume of the Boyden chambers. Non-migrated cells were removed with a cotton swab, and the cells were fixed with methanol for 15 min and stained with crystal violet. The migration activity was quantified by blind counting of the migrated cells on the lower surface of the membrane of at least 10 fields per chamber using a ×20 objective. Western Blot Analysis of Protein Expression—Whole cell extracts were lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm pepstatin A, and 1 mm E64). Protein concentration in the extracts was determined with a protein assay system (Bio-Rad). 100 μg of protein was separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were probed with antibodies specific to p53 (monoclonal antibody 421, a gift of Dr. A. J. Levine, or DO-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p73α (Ab-1, Oncogene Research Products), PI3-kinase subunits p85α (polyclonal, Sigma) or p110 (polyclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The membranes were treated with secondary sheep anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase antibodies or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Immuno-Research). The filters were developed by ECL chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Detection of Transcriptional Activity of p53 and p73α—For luciferase assay, cells were transiently transfected using LipofectaAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) with 1 μg of the pWWp-GL2 expressing luciferase under the control of the wild type p21waf1/cip1 gene promoter (33Buckbinder L. Talbott R. Seizinger B.R. Kley N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10640-10644Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To control the efficiency of the transfection, the cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of pCH100 (Amersham Biosciences) expressing β-galactosidase. The luciferase activity was measured using Dual-Light luminescent reporter gene assay system (Tropix) 48 h after the transfection. β-Galactosidase staining of HCT116-Waf1ConA cells expressing β-galactosidase reporter gene under the p53-responsive promoter was performed as described previously (34Sablina A.A. Ilyinskaya G.V. Rubtsova S.N. Agapova L.S. Chumakov P.M. Kopnin B.P. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 977-984PubMed Google Scholar). Measuring Activity of the Rho GTPases—The cells were incubated in serum-free media for 24 h. Thirty minutes or 2 h after stimulation with 10% FBS or EGF (100 ng/ml), the cells were lysed in the MLB buffer (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). The amounts of GTP-bound Rac1 or GTP-bound Rho were determined using the Rac1 activation assay kit and the Rho activation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), respectively, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Measuring Activity of PI3-Kinase—The serum-starved cells were stimulated with 10% FBS and lysed at 4 °C in the lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 4 mm Na3VO4, 200 mm NaF, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol, pH 7.4). The lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the anti-p85α antibodies (Sigma) and protein A-agarose. The beads were pelleted at 14,000 × g, washed three times with Buffer A (Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 100 μm Na3VO4), three times with the Buffer B (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm LiCl2, and 100 μm Na3VO4), and twice with the Buffer C (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μm Na3VO4). The pellets were resuspended in the Buffer D (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μm NaH2PO3), and the activity of PI3-kinase was assessed by phosphorylation of a mixture of phosphatidylinositols in the presence of 40 μm ATP (1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). The reaction was carried out for 15 min and stopped with 150 μl of ice-cold 1 n HCl. The lipids were extracted by vortexing with 450 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1) mixture. After centrifugation the organic phase was washed twice with 200 μl of 1 n HCl, and 40-μl aliquots were separated on potassium oxalate-pretreated TLC plates (Whatman) with 35 ml of 2 n acetic acid and 65 ml of 1-propanol as a mobile phase. The TLC plates were dried and exposed to Fuji film. The Wound Healing Experiments—Eight-week-old wild type and homozygous p53 gene knockout C57BL mice were anesthetized and shaved, and full-thickness skin wounds were inflicted by excising ∼0.5 × 0.5-cm patches of the skin. The wounds were then allowed to dry and to form a scab. The wound closure was measured daily. The area of wounds was measured by covering each wound of an anesthetized animal with a transparent plastic film and recording the wound contour. The wound areas were quantified and expressed as a percentage of the initial wound size (100%). The mean values (n = 10 animals) were plotted for each time point. Expression of p53 was analyzed in 5-day skin wounds by immunohistochemistry of paraffin-embedded wounded skin sections using standard protocol. The FL-293 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for the immunostaining of p53. Loss of p53 Activity Decreases Cell Migration—To study the influence of physiological levels of p53 on cell motility, we analyzed how inhibition of endogenous p53 expression affects cell behavior in wound closure test and Boyden chamber assay. The effect of p53 elimination on the ability of cells to migrate into the wound in vitro was determined in two cell contexts: human normal foreskin fibroblasts BJ and colon carcinoma HCT116 cells. Both inhibition of p53 expression by siRNA-p53 in BJ cells and the p53 gene knockout in HCT116 cells resulted in significantly lower ability to migrate into the mechanical scratch (in vitro wound) made on the surface of growing cell culture (Fig. 1, and Supplemental Material Figs. 1 and 2). This result was in disagreement with our previous observation that mouse fibroblasts 10(1) expressing high levels of exogenous p53 showed decreased cell migration into the wound in vitro despite increased lamellar activity. This paradoxical effect was probably a result of repression of fibronectin production induced by overexpressed p53 (1Alexandrova A. Ivanov A. Chumakov P.M. Kopnin P.B. Vasiliev J.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5826-5830Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In BJ cell cultures we found no difference between p53-positive and p53-negative cells in fibronectin production (see Supplemental Material, Fig. 3). Probably the differential effects of endogenous and exogenous p53 on fibronectin production in human BJ and mouse 10(1) fibroblasts, respectively, are responsible for the difference in their behavior in wound closure assay. The decreased cell motility of various p53-deficient cells was further confirmed by Boyden chamber assay. Indeed, the HCT116 p53–/– cells showed lower ability to migrate through both uncoated and Matrigel-coated 8-μm pore-size membranes (Fig. 2). The increased number of p53-positive HCT116 cells on the lower side of the membrane as compared with their p53-negative counterparts could not be explained by differences in cell attachment or cell proliferation/survival on the upper side of the filter (see Supplemental Material, Fig. 4). The difference in migration level between HCT116 and HCT116 p53–/– cells remained unchanged at different time points of incubation (Supplemental Material, Fig. 5). So the p53 gene knockout in HCT16 cells caused an inhibition rather than a delay of cell migration. To exclude that the effect observed in HCT116 cells was due to variations between different clones (the construction of the HCT116 p53-knockout cell line involved selection of individual cell clones), we used retroviral gene transfer to produce mass cultures of HCT116 cells expressing C-terminal dominant-negative fragment of p53 (GSE22 (31Ossovskaya V.S. Mazo I.A. Chernov M.V. Chernova O.B. Strezoska Z. Kondratov R. Stark G.R. Chumakov P.M. Gudkov A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10309-10314Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar)). Introduction of GSE22 into the HCT116 cells decreased p53 transcriptional activity 5 times as measured by the luciferase reporter assay without significant changes in the levels of expressed p53 protein, whereas all HCT116 p53–/– derivatives showed background level of luciferase activity and no expression of the p53 protein (Fig. 3, A and B). Boyden chamber assay revealed that GSE22 expression dramatically decreased migration of the HCT116 cells without affecting motility of the HCT116 p53–/– cells (Fig. 3C). Hence, there is direct correlation between the level of p53 activity and the migration ability of the HCT116 cells. The influence of p53 expression on cell motility was also observed in different cell systems. Inhibition of p53 expression in human BJ fibroblasts by siRNA-p53 resulted in decreased cell motility (Fig. 4A). On the other hand the tetracycline-regulated expression of the exogenous p53 in p53-deficient human lung carcinoma H1299 cell line considerably stimulated cell migration (Fig. 4B). Similar correlation between cell migration activity and p53 state was observed in various cells types derived from wild type and homozygous p53 gene knockout mice, in particular for lung and spleen fibroblasts, peritoneal macrophages, and keratinocytes. The most pronounced difference was observed for the peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 4B). Thus, the effect of p53 on cell motility was characteristic for both tumor and normal cells, although the extent of this effect depends on particular cell context. Overexpression of the p53 Homologue p73α Stimulates Cell Migration—The p53 family member p73α displays a high degree of structural and functional similarity with p53 (10Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A.

Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) suggesting that p73α can also affect cell migration. Transcriptionally active p73α was overexpressed in the p53-positive HCT116 and in the p53-deficient H1299 cell lines (Fig. 5A). Overexpression of the p73α in the H1299 cells considerably enhanced both the p53-dependent luciferase reporter expression and the migration activity (Fig. 5, B and C). In the p53-positive HCT116 cells the effect of p73α was detectable but less significant as compared with the p53-deficient H1299 cells (Fig. 5, B and C). Hence, as with p53, the increase in p73α transcriptional activity was accompanied by stimulation of cell migration. Transcriptional Activity Is Required for the p53- or p73α-dependent Stimulation of Cell Migration—To study whether p53 or p73α affects cell motility through their ability to activate transcription of the target genes, we introduced transcriptionally inactive mutants p53His175 (35Kern S.E.

Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D. Cell. 1997; 90: 809-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar) into H1299 cells (Fig. 6A). Expression of either p53 or p73α mutant had no effect on cell motility (Fig. 6B), suggesting that transcriptional up-regulation of certain p53/p73α target genes is involved in the modulation of cell migration. Because transcriptional activity of p53 and its family members can be modulated at post-translational level by various stresses, we tested whether p53 can affect motility under unstressed conditions. We investigated the following: (i) whether conditions of Boyden chamber assay or wounding in vitro induce transcriptional activation of p53 and (ii) whether the fraction of the migrated cells is enriched by the cells with transcriptionally activated p53. We used HCT116 cells carrying β-galactosidase reporter gene under the control of the p53-responsive promoter. We found that below 2% of the cells were positively stained for β-galactosidase 12 h after plating into Boyden chambers, whereas over half the cells became β-galactosidase-positive after treatment with the DNA-damaging drug EMS (see Supplemental Material, Fig. 6). Moreover, we observed the same proportion of the β-galactosidase-positive cells on both sides of the porous membrane (data not shown). No considerable increase of activity of p53 or its homologues was observed at the wound edge 24 h after wounding (see Supplemental Material Fig. 6). This result suggests that conditions of Boyden chamber assay or wound closure in vitro do not induce stress-related activation of p53. So even the “latent” form of p53 is capable of affecting cell migration. This idea is in agreement with the data that the unstressed latent form of p53 is bound to p53-binding sites within the p53-responsive genes, including the p21waf1/cip1 gene (37Kaeser M.D. Iggo R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 99: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Moreover, p53 expression under unstressed conditions induces significant changes in the gene expression profiles revealed by cDNA microarray hybridization (9Fontemaggi G. Kela I. Amariglio N.

The genes responsible for the p53-dependent modulation of cell motility might belong to the group of genes that p53 regulates under normal physiological conditions. To test whether stress-induced activation of p53 can additionally stimulate cell motility, we analyzed migration of the cells treated with the DNA-damaging agent EMS or with the hypoxia-mimicking agent deferoxamine mesylate. Either of the treatments increased the expression level and transcriptional activity of p53 (data not shown). Boyden chamber assay carried in the presence of the drugs showed proportional increase in migration of both p53-positive and p53-negative cells (Fig. 7) suggesting significant p53-independent component in stress-induced activation of cell motility. Thus, the contribution of activated p53 into stimulation of cell migration under stress conditions c"

Freymann D.M. Stroud R.M. Walter P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 755-775Google Scholar). The interaction between SRP54 and the membrane bound SRP receptor (SR) selectively targets the RNC-SRP complex to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This is followed by the release of the signal sequence from SRP54 and its insertion into the protein-conducting channel (PCC) that is formed by the oligomeric assembly of the trimeric Sec61p complex (2Beckmann R. Spahn C.M. Eswar N. Helmers J. Penczek P.A. Sali A. Frank J. Blobel G. Cell. 2001; 107: 361-372Google Scholar). The nascent chain translocates into the ER lumen, while the ribosome remains attached to the PCC.The GTPase domains of SRP54 and SRα are very similar in their structure and function. Structural studies of their prokaryotic homologues have shown that they form their own family within the GTPase superfamily (3Montoya G. Svensson C. Luirink J. Sinning I. Proteins. 1997; 28: 285-288Google Scholar, 4Freymann D.M. Keenan R.J. Stroud R.M. Walter P. Nature. 1997; 385: 361-364Google Scholar). They have low affinity for nucleotide and are both stable in their empty states (5Miller J.D. Wilhelm H. Gierasch L. Gilmore R. Walter P. Nature. 1993; 366: 351-354Google Scholar, 6Bacher G.

Dobberstein B. Nature. 1996; 381: 248-251Google Scholar). The interaction between SRP54 and SRα leads to the formation of a GTP stabilized SRP-SRα complex (7Rapiejko P.J. Gilmore R. Cell. 1997; 89: 703-713Google Scholar). GTP hydrolysis dissociates the SRP-SRα complex (8Connolly T. Rapiejko P.J. Gilmore R. Science. 1991; 252: 1171-1173Google Scholar), whereby SRP54 and SRα serve as mutual GTPase-activating proteins (GAP). This reciprocally symmetric interaction is unique among known GTPases (9Powers T. Walter P. Science. 1995; 269: 1422-1424Google Scholar).SRβ is closely related to members of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) GTPase family (10Miller J.D. Tajima S. Lauffer L. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 273-282Google Scholar, 11Schwartz T. Blobel G. Cell. 2003; 112: 793-803Google Scholar). ARFs are conserved in all eukaryotes and are involved in the regulation of vesicle transport (12Jackson C.L. Casanova J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 60-67Google Scholar). SRβ is present only in eukaryotes and contains a transmembrane segment providing the membrane anchor for SRα (13Young J.C. Ursini J. Legate K.R. Miller J.D. Walter P. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15650-15657Google Scholar). However, a truncated protein representing the cytosolic GTPase domain without the transmembrane domain is functional in protein targeting (14Ogg S.C. Barz W.P. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 341-354Google Scholar). The function of the GTPase domain of SRβ has long been a matter of conjecture. A recent structural and biochemical study showed that SRβ effectively binds SRα only when bound to GTP and not when bound to GDP (11Schwartz T. Blobel G. Cell. 2003; 112: 793-803Google Scholar), revealing that the GTP cycle of SRβ controls the association and dissociation of the heterodimeric SR.The precise order of events that lead to the disassembly of the RNC-SRP-SR complex and the transfer of the signal sequence to the PCC are unknown. The PCC is composed of an oligomeric assembly of heterotrimeric integral membrane proteins: Sec61α, -β, and -γ. In yeast there are two homologous α-subunits (termed Sec61p and Ssh1p) and two homologous β-subunits (termed Sbh1p and Sbh2p). The two α- and β-subunits form distinct trimeric complexes (termed the Sec61p and Ssh1p complex), each with the shared γ-subunit (termed Sss1p) (15Gorlich D. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 615-630Google Scholar, 16Toikkanen J. Gatti E. Takei K. Saloheimo M. Olkkonen V.M. Soderlund H. De Camilli P. Keranen S. Yeast. 1996; 12: 425-438Google Scholar, 17Finke K. Plath K. Panzner S. Prehn S. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1482-1494Google Scholar). In comparison to the Sec61p complex, the Ssh1p complex interacts with signal sequences of stronger hydrophobicity (18Wittke S. Dunnwald M. Albertsen M. Johnsson N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2223-2232Google Scholar) and appears to be involved exclusively in cotranslational protein transport. The trimeric Sec61p complex can associate with four additional subunits Sec62p, Sec63p, Sec71p, and Sec72p to form the so called heptameric complex (19Panzner S. Dreier L. Hartmann E. Kostka S. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 561-570Google Scholar), which facilitates posttranslational protein transport in yeast.To identify a GEF for SRβ, we have searched the sequence data base for homologues of the known GEFs for ARF related GTPases in yeast. We found that the cytosolic domains of each of the β-subunits of the PCCs, Sbh1p and Sbh2p, showed homology to a motif that is common to ARF specific GEFs. We have employed a fluorescence spectroscopy technique to directly monitor the nucleotide exchange of SRβ and have shown that the cytosolic domains of recombinant Sbh1p and Sbh2p indeed function as the GEFs for SRβ. GEF activity was retained when Sbh1p was part of the trimeric Sec61p complex. In contrast, GEF activity was not expressed when Sbh1p was part of the heptameric complex that functions in posttranslational translocation. We propose a model in which Sbh1p and Sbh2p regulate the reassociation of the SR subunits, thereby coupling targeting with translocation.MATERIALS AND METHODSLoading of Purified SRβ with MantGDP—The cytosolic GTPase domain of SRβ from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (residues 31–244) (11Schwartz T.

SRβ31–244 was purified by cobalt affinity chromatography (TALON Metal Affinity Resin, Clontech) from two liters of cell culture and eluted in 15 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 150 mm imidazole. To remove endogenous nucleotide bound to SRβ31–244, EDTA (0.5 mm) was added to the eluate, followed by an incubation at 4 °C for 30 min. The eluate was then subjected to size exclusion chromatography in the presence of 0.5 mm EDTA in buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT) (Superdex-75, Amersham Biosciences). Fractions of a single A280 peak, representing SRβ31–244, were pooled and stored at –80 °C.A 10 μm solution of SRβ31–244 was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 200 μm of 3′-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-2′-deoxyguanosine-5′-diphosphate (mantGDP) in buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 350 mm KOAc, 1 mm DTT, and 5 mm Mg(OAc)2). The excess of unbound mantGDP was removed by dialysis against buffer C at 4 °C for 4 h.Purification of the Heptameric and the Sec61p Complex—The heptameric complex was immunopurified from yeast strain Sec63prA, in which the gene coding for Sec63p was tagged by in-frame integration of a DNA fragment encoding for a Factor X protease site and the immunoglobulin G (IgG)-binding domains of protein A, yielding a fusion protein of Sec63p-FactorX site-protein A (20Beckmann R. Bubeck D. Grassucci R. Penczek P. Verschoor A. Blobel G. Frank J. Science. 1997; 278: 2123-2126Google Scholar). Cells from a 36-liter culture were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 125 mm sucrose, and protease inhibitors (complete protease inhibitor mix, Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) at 13,000 p.s.i. using a French press. The cell lysate was cleared by low speed centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 38 min at 4 °C to obtain a crude membrane pellet. Aliquots of the crude membrane pellet were stored at –80 °C. A 10th part of the crude membrane pellet (5 ml) was solubilized by resuspending it in 46 ml of solubilization buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 400 mm sucrose, 750 mm KOAc, 2.5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 3% digitonin (Calbiochem), 5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm PMSF) and incubation on ice for 30 min. Insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted 1:1 with dilution buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 400 mm sucrose, 2.5 mm, Mg(OAc)2) and incubated over night at 4 °C with 1 ml IgG-Sepharose (Cappel, Durham, NC). The resin was washed using washing buffer WLX (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KOAc, 3 mm Mg(OAc)2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT) containing 0.5% digitonin and 5 mg/ml asolectin and the heptameric complex eluted by incubating with 5 μg/ml Factor X protease in 1 ml of WLX buffer for 5 h at 25 °C. To exchange detergents, pooled fractions containing the heptameric complex were incubated with Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated and eluted with buffer WLX containing 0.3% DeoxyBigCHAP (Calbiochem).The trimeric Sec61p complex was essentially purified as described previously (20Beckmann R. Bubeck D. Grassucci R. Penczek P. Verschoor A. Blobel G. Frank J. Science. 1997; 278: 2123-2126Google Scholar). Briefly, the immunomobilized heptameric complex (see above) was incubated with buffer WLX containing 1% Triton X-100, thereby dissociating the trimeric Sec61p complex from the heptameric complex. To exchange detergent, the trimeric Sec61p complex was then bound to SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated and eluted with buffer WLX containing 0.3% DeoxyBigCHAP.Purification of Sbh1p and Sbh2p—DNA coding for the NH2-terminal cytosolic domain of Sbh1p (residues 1–53) or Sbh2p (residues 1– 61) was subcloned into pGEX4-T2 (Amersham Biosciences) and pGEX6-P1 (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. Sbh1pΔC was expressed in BL21(DE3) cells (Stratagene) and Sbh2pΔC was expressed in BL21(DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene). The GST-tagged proteins were isolated from cleared Escherichia coli lysates by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences).SRβ Nucleotide Exchange Assay—Steady-state fluorescence intensity was measured using a SPEX Fluorolog FL3-11 photon-counting spectrofluorimeter with a single grating excitation monochromator and a 450-watt xenon lamp. Samples were exited at 352 nm (1 nm bandpass) and emission was detected at 440 nm (5-nm bandpass). All spectral measurements were done at 25 °C in buffer J (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 350 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 100 μm GDP, and 0.3% DeoxyBigCHAP) using a 4 × 4-mm quartz cuvette. The release of mantGDP from SRβ31–244 was measured in real time as a decrease in fluorescence.Purification of Ribosomes and Ribosome Nascent Chain Complexes— Ribosomes and ribosome nascent chain complexes were purified as described previously (2Beckmann R. Spahn C.M. Eswar N. Helmers J. Penczek P.A. Sali A. Frank J. Blobel G. Cell. 2001; 107: 361-372Google Scholar).RESULTSSbh1p and Sbh2p Share Sequence Homology with the Sec7 Domain—GEFs for several families of GTPases have been functionally and structurally characterized. Interestingly, GEFs vary dramatically in structure. However those specific for one family of GTPases usually have the same fold. Accordingly, the GEFs for the GTPases of the ARF family share a common functional region of about 200 amino acids, the Sec7 domain (12Jackson C.L. Casanova J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 60-67Google Scholar). Taking the structural similarity between SRβ and ARF into account, a similarity between the respective GEFs is also conceivable. Searching the sequence data base, we could identify significant sequence similarity between the cytosolic domains of the two β-subunits of the PCCs in yeast and the Sec7 domain (Fig. 1). The sequence similarity involves the region of Sec7 that is crucial for GEF function, namely the F-G loop and helix H (21Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 95: 237-248Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we tested whether Sbh1p and Sbh2p are able to promote the exchange of nucleotide for SRβ.Sbh1p and Sbh2p Function as the GEFs for SRβ—A fluorescence spectroscopic assay was used, which allows one to monitor the nucleotide exchange on a G-protein in real-time and at high resolution. It had been shown that the fluorescent signal of mantGDP is dependent on the environment of the probe and hence on the amount of mantGDP bound by a G-protein (22Lenzen C. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 95-109Google Scholar). Recombinant yeast SRβ31–244 was purified from E. coli and endogenously bound nucleotide removed by size exclusion chromatography in the presence of EDTA. The removal of nucleotide was confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography analysis and determined to be complete (data not shown). SRβ31–244 was reloaded by incubation with an excess of mant-GDP and unincorporated mantGDP was removed by dialysis. The reloading of SRβ31–244 with mantGDP resulted in a substantial increase of emitted fluorescence compared with mant-GDP alone. The SRβ31–244-dependent increase averaged to 20%, indicating that mantGDP was successfully bound by SRβ31–244 (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Fluorescence nucleotide exchange assay.A, fluorescence enhancement on binding mantGDP to SRβ31–244. 10 μm mantGDP (open circle) or 10 μm mantGDP-SRβ31–244 (open square) were excited at 352 nm, and emission was recorded between 410 and 480 nm at 25 °C. SRβ31–244 did not emit in the range of wavelengths recorded. B, comparison of the intrinsic (square) and Sbh1p (circle) or Sbh2p (cross) stimulated dissociation of mantGDP from SRβ31–244. 1 μm mant-SRβ31–244 was incubated with either mock buffer or 1 μm GST-Sbh1pΔC or GST-Sbh2pΔC at 25 °C in the presence of GDP (100 μm). The data were fitted as the sum of two exponentials resulting in the following rate constants: Sbh1p: k1 = 9.4 × 10–2, k2 = 2.3 × 10–3; Sbh2p: k1 = 13.9 × 10–2, k2 = 3.7 × 10–3. C, comparison of the effect of trimeric Sec61p complex (triangle) or heptameric complex (diamond)on the dissociation of mantGDP from SRβ31–244. 1 μm mantGDP-SRβ31– 244 was incubated with either 1 μm trimeric Sec61p complex or heptameric complex at 25 °C in the presence of GDP (100 μm). The data were fitted as the sum of two exponentials resulting in the following rate constants for the Sec61p complex: k1 = 8.4 × 10–2, k2 = 2.1 × 10–3. D, characterization of purified translocation components. The pattern of proteins corresponding to 1.4 μg of GST-Sbh1pΔC and GST-Sbh2pΔC, 2 μg of Sec61p complex, and 5 μg of heptameric complex were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Simply Blue Safe Stain (Invitrogen). Asterisks indicate impurities in the heptameric complex preparation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The SBH1 gene in yeast codes for an 8.7-kDa protein with a COOH-terminal transmembrane domain. Its homologue Sbh2p is slightly larger with a size of 9.6 kDa. To test whether Sbh1p or Sbh2p are directly involved in the nucleotide exchange of SRβ, we purified the recombinant NH2-terminal cytosolic domains of Sbh1p (Sbh1pΔC) and Sbh2p (Sbh2pΔC) by GST affinity chromatography (Fig. 2D, as indicated). Equimolar amounts of mantGDP-SRβ31–244, GST-Sbh1pΔC, or GST-Sbh2pΔC in the presence of an excess of GDP were incubated at 25 °C. The reactions were excited at 352 nm and the emission recorded at 441 nm. When incubating mock buffer with mantGDP-SRβ31–244, no decrease of fluorescence could be detected (Fig. 2B). This result indicates that SRβ31–244 binds nucleotide tightly and does not exchange with the solution by itself. When using GST alone in the assay, no decrease in fluorescence could be detected either (data not shown). In the presence of GST-Sbh1pΔC or GST-Sbh2pΔC, a substantial decrease of fluorescence could be measured resulting from the exchange of nucleotide. The observed decrease of fluorescence averaged 12% after 15 min (Fig. 2B) and reached a plateau after a decrease of 14% (data not shown). The obtained data were best fitted as a sum of two exponential decays. When a 10-fold excess of either GST-Sbh1pΔC or GST-Sbh2pΔC over SRβ31–244 was used in the assay, the decrease of fluorescence averaged 50%, indicating that GST-Sbh1pΔC and GST-Sbh2pΔC do exchange the nucleotide of SRβ stoichiometrically rather than catalytically (data not shown).Sbh1p Functions as the GEF for SRβ in the Trimeric Sec61p but Not in the Heptameric Complex—Sbh1p is assembled into two different PCCs in yeast. It is not only part of the trimeric Sec61p complex, involved in cotranslational protein transport, but also part of the heptameric complex that is exclusively involved in posttranslational protein transport. To test whether the GEF activity for SRβ is dependent on the assembly state of Sbh1p we purified the trimeric Sec61p and the heptameric complex from yeast (Fig. 2D, as indicated) and tested both detergent-solubilized complexes in the nucleotide exchange assay.We incubated equimolar amounts of mantGDP-SRβ31–244 with trimeric Sec61p complex or heptameric complex in the presence of an excess of GDP at 25 °C. When mantGDP-SRβ31–244 was incubated with purified trimeric Sec61p complex, mantGDP was efficiently exchanged with GDP, resulting in a decrease of fluorescence that averaged to 17% after 15 min (Fig. 2C) and reached a plateau after a decrease of 20% (data not shown). The obtained data were best fitted as a sum of two exponential decays. When using equimolar amounts of mantGDP-SRβ31–244 and purified heptameric complex, no decrease in fluorescence could be detected (Fig. 2C).The ribosome had been reported to reduce the affinity of SRβ for nucleotide (23Bacher G. Pool M. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 723-730Google Scholar) and therefore was proposed to function as the GEF for SRβ (24Fulga T.A. Sinning I. Dobberstein B. Pool M.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2338-2347Google Scholar). To test whether the ribosome is able to promote the exchange of nucleotide for SRβ, we used purified translating and non-translating ribosomes in the GTPase exchange assay. In our system, neither translating nor non-translating ribosomes were able to exchange the nucleotide of SRβ (data not shown).We conclude that Sbh1p and Sbh2p are the GEFs for SRβ and are able to promote the exchange of nucleotide without the other subunits of the trimeric Sec61p complex. Furthermore, Sbh1p is able to promote the nucleotide exchange for SRβ when assembled into the trimeric Sec61p complex but not when assembled into the heptameric complex.DISCUSSIONBased on biochemical and structural data, a recent study had suggested that SRβ requires a GAP and GEF to complete its GTP switch cycle (11Schwartz T. Blobel G. Cell. 2003; 112: 793-803Google Scholar). Without a GEF, the nucleotide exchange in most GTPases occurs very slowly under physiological conditions (12Jackson C.L. Casanova J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 60-67Google Scholar). In agreement with this, we could not detect any intrinsic nucleotide exchange activity of purified SRβ, which indicates that SRβ relies on an extrinsic GEF.Searching the sequence data base, we have identified a sequence similarity between the β-subunits of the two homologous trimeric PCCs in yeast and the conserved Sec7 domain that is present in all ARF-GEFs. The residues in contact with ARF1 in the ARF1-Sec7 complex form a binding groove made up of two regions: the α-helix H and the loop connecting the preceding helices F and G of the all-α-helical Sec7 domain (21Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 95: 237-248Google Scholar), forming a functional module. This module is not a folded domain, but is rather held in shape by the remainder of the Sec7 domain, which forms the surrounding architectural scaffold. Therefore it appears that the SRβ binding groove of Sbh1p/Sbh2p is presented in a different structural context. Sbh1p and Sbh2p are not related to the Sec7 domain except for the functional module. The cytosolic domains of Sbh1p and Sbh2p consist of only about 60 residues and thus represent the smallest functional GEFs to date. We note that not all residues that are important for Sec7 function are conserved in Sbh1p/Sbh2p. Therefore the guanine nucleotide exchange of SRβ will also differ from ARF GEFs in some detail.Using a fluorescence nucleotide exchange assay, we show that recombinant proteins comprising the cytosolic domains of Sbh1p and Sbh2p indeed function as the GEFs for SRβ. Despite the small size of their cytosolic domains, Sbh1p and Sbh2p are able to efficiently promote the exchange of nucleotide for SRβ. We find that Sbh1p is also functional as the GEF for SRβ when assembled into the detergent-solubilized trimeric Sec61p complex isolated from yeast. A direct interaction between the trimeric Sec61p complex and SRβ is supported by the fact that a protein interaction screen has found the trimeric Sec61p complex and its homologue, the Ssh1p complex to be in the proximity of SRβ (18Wittke S. Dunnwald M. Albertsen M. Johnsson N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2223-2232Google Scholar). The calculated reaction rates at which the trimeric Sec61p complex, Sbh1p, and Sbh2p promoted nucleotide exchange are very similar, which indicates that both β-subunits promote the nucleotide exchange equally well, independent of their assembly state with the other subunits of the trimeric complexes. Interestingly, however, when Sbh1p was assembled into the detergent-solubilized heptameric complex isolated from yeast, it did not express its GEF activity. This suggests, that the cytosolic domain of Sbh1p in this complex might not be accessible to SRβ.The β-subunit of the SR is an eukaryotic feature; the SRα homologue in bacteria directly associates with the membrane (1Keenan R.J. Freymann D.M. Stroud R.M. Walter P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 755-775Google Scholar). Interestingly, there is no bacterial homologue for Sbh1p. It is tempting to speculate that in higher organisms, the SRβ subunit evolved in concert with its GEF, not merely to provide a membrane anchor for SRα but also to provide an additional regulatory step to the translocation process; the interaction between these two proteins in the eukaryotic ER membrane, one a component of the targeting machinery (SR), the other a component of the trimeric PCCs, suggests that these proteins might link the two processes in a controllable fashion.The association of the SR subunits is controlled by the nucleotide bound state of SRβ (11Schwartz T. Blobel G. Cell. 2003; 112: 793-803Google Scholar). With SRβ in its GDP bound form, the SR subunits dissociate. The β-subunits of the trimeric PCCs, acting as the GEFs for SRβ, reload SRβ with GTP and therefore control the reassociation of the SR subunits. It is conceivable that the β-subunits of the occupied PCC are inaccessible to SRβ. This would prevent the nucleotide exchange and the heterodimerization with SRα. As a result the targeting machinery could not be linked to the occupied PCC. Sbh1p can be cross-linked to Spc25p, a subunit of the signal peptidase complex (25Kalies K.U. Rapoport T.A. Hartmann E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 887-894Google Scholar). Inaccessibility of the β-subunits of the PCCs may, therefore, not only be caused by the RNC complex binding to the PCCs, but also by the lateral recruitment within the plane of the ER membrane of other integral ER membrane proteins, such as the signal peptidase complex, the oligosaccharyltransferase or the additional subunits recruited to form the heptameric complex which is involved in posttranslational transport.It had been reported that the ribosome decreases the affinity of SRβ for nucleotide (23Bacher G. Pool M. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 723-730Google Scholar). From these results it had been concluded that the ribosome might stabilize an empty state of SRβ and therefore could function as its GEF. However, using either purified non-translating or translating ribosomes in our assay had no effect on the nucleotide exchange of SRβ.Our data show a specific function for the β-subunits of the two homologous PCCs and allows for a refined model of the cotranslational targeting process that had previously been suggested (11Schwartz T. Blobel G. Cell. 2003; 112: 793-803Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). In a first step, the SRP recognizes the signal sequence and binds to the RNC complex. The interaction between the ribosome and the SRP results in the binding of GTP by SRP54 (6Bacher G. Lutcke H. Jungnickel B. Rapoport T.A. Dobberstein B. Nature. 1996; 381: 248-251Google Scholar). Sbh1p assembled into the trimeric Sec61p complex functions as the GEF for SRβ, loading it with GTP. This nucleotide exchange reaction triggers the assembly of the SR subunits in the proximity of the trimeric Sec61p complex. Only with the SR in its assembled state, can the RNC-SRP complex be targeted to the ER membrane where SRP54 and SRα form a GTP stabilized complex. Next, the trimeric Sec61p complex replaces the SRP at the exit site of the ribosome, the signal sequence is transferred to the trimeric Sec61p complex and translocation starts. GTP hydrolysis of SRβ would lead to the dissociation of the SR subunits (11Schwartz T. Blobel G. Cell. 2003; 112: 793-803Google Scholar). In a last step, SRP54 and SRα act as mutual GAPs, thereby resolving the SRP-SRα interaction.Fig. 3Model for SRP-SR mediated cotranslational protein targeting to the ER membrane. SRP54 binds to the signal sequence emerging from the translating ribosome, resulting in an RNC-SRP complex and GTP-binding to SRP54. The trimeric Sec61p complex functions as the GEF for SRβ, loading it with GTP and thereby reassociating the two SR subunits. SRP54 and SRα form a GTP stabilized complex, targeting the RNC-SRP complex to the ER membrane. With all three GTPases in their GTP bound state, the signal sequence is transferred to the Sec61p complex. GTP hydrolysis of SRβ dissociates the SR subunits, and the mutual GTP hydrolysis of SRP54 and SRα resolves the SRP-SRα interaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The precise timing and coordination of the events during the signal sequence transfer still remain poorly understood. Signal sequence transfer to the trimeric Sec61p complex requires GTP binding by SRP54, SRα and SRβ but not necessarily GTP hydrolysis (26Song W. Raden D. Mandon E.C. Gilmore R. Cell. 2000; 100: 333-343Google Scholar). The events triggering the GTP hydrolysis of the three GTPases and the release of the signal sequence remain to be"

The σ54-RNA polymerase binds to promoters with conserved sequence elements at –24 and –12 and utilizes specialized enhancer-binding activators to convert, through an ATP-dependent process, closed promoter complexes to open promoter complexes.

Multisubunit RNAPs are evolutionarily and structurally conserved enzymes. In bacteria, promoter-specific transcription initiation requires the binding of a σ-subunit to the catalytically proficient core RNAP (subunit composition α2ββ′ω) to form the holoenzyme (σ-RNAP).

In contrast, σ70-type RNAPs use promoters characterized by conserved DNA sequences located at –10 and –35, where the closed to open complex transition occurs spontaneously and independently of an ATP energy source (13Murakami K.S. Darst S.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar).The –12/–24 regions of σ54-dependent promoters might be considered as functional analogues of the –10/–35 regions of σ70-dependent promoters. Genetic, biochemical, and structural data show that the –10 and –35 regions of the σ70-dependent promoters are recognized by σ70 conserved regions 2.4 and 4.2, respectively (14Murakami K.S. Masuda S. Darst S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1280-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 15Lonetto M. Gribskov M. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3483-3489Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast, the precise σ54 sequences involved in recognizing the –12 and –24 regions of σ54-dependent promoters are not well known.The functional domain organization of σ54 is complex and clearly different from that of σ70 (3Buck M.

Microbiol. 1993; 10: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Extensive deletion and mutational analyses of σ54 have allowed functions to be assigned to different regions of the protein (Fig. 1b). Recognition of the –12 GC-region, where DNA melting originates, involves σ54 Region I and Region III sequences (16Wang L. Gralla J.D. J. Biol.

Unlike σ70, σ54 can bind to promoter DNA in the absence of core RNAP (25Buck M. Cannon W. Nature. 1992; 358: 422-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, σ54-RNAP footprints the –12 GC-region differently from σ54, suggesting that core RNAP changes σ54-promoter interactions in some way (26Morris L. Cannon W.V. Claverie-Martin F. Austin S. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11563-11571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein-DNA arrangement at the –12-position, termed the regulatory center (17Wigneshweraraj S.R.

To address this issue, we converted σ54 to a proximity-based cleavage reagent through the conjugation of a reactive Fe2+ chelate using [(p-bromoacetamidobenzyl)-EDTA Fe] (FeBABE) (28Ishihama A. Chem. Commun. 2000; 13: 1091-1094Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and now provide the first physical evidence in favor of an interaction between the RpoN box and the consensus –24 promoter region and σ54 Region I and the consensus –12 promoter region (Fig. 1, a and b). Overall, the changes in the spatial relationships during transcription initiation between σ54 and promoter DNA provide insights into how conformational changes mediate the progression of transcription events at σ54-dependent promoters. The approaches described within this report can be applied to study static and dynamic nucleoprotein complexes for which little or no structural data are available.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProteins and Promoter DNA Probes—Klebsiella pneumoniae cysteine-free σ54 and single-cysteine variants (Table I) thereof were constructed and purified as amino-terminal His6-tagged fusion proteins essentially as described in Ref. 29Wigneshweraraj S.R.

Where necessary, MOPS buffer with 6 m urea was used for conjugation under denaturing conditions. Conjugation efficiencies were measured fluorometrically using N-[4-[7-(diethylamino)-4-methylcoumarin-3-yl]malemide (CPM) as previously described in Refs. 29Wigneshweraraj S.R. Fujita N. Ishihama A.

Bioconjugate Chem. 1997; 8: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar.In Vitro Transcription Assays—Reactions (10 μl final volume) were conducted using 200 nm core RNAP reconstituted with a 1:3 molar ratio of core RNAP to σ54 (FeBABE-conjugated and -unconjugated) and 10 nm pMKC28. Plasmid pMKC28 contains a T7 early transcriptional terminator sequence downstream of the multiple cloning site. The promoter fragment is inserted into the multiple cloning site in such a way to direct transcription of a discrete transcript of ∼470 nucleotides. Assays were performed in STA buffer (25 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.0), 8 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 3.5% (w/v) PEG 8000) essentially as described in Ref. 29Wigneshweraraj S.R. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Buck M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3038-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar. For open complex formation, 5 μm PspF1–275 and 4 mm ATP were used. The elongation mixture contained 100 μg/ml heparin; 0.1 mm ATP, CTP, and GTP; and 0.05 mm UTP (0.25 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol)). Reactions were conducted at 37 °C and stopped with 4 μl of formamide dye mixture. 7 μl of the samples were run on a 6% denaturing gel, and the dried gel was quantified and analyzed by PhosphorImager analysis to measure the transcriptional activities (percentage) relative to wild-type σ54. Since the conjugation yields were not 100%, the total activity a tot (in arbitrary units) of σ54 after conjugation is the weighted sum of the activities contributed by both (unconjugated and conjugated) σ54 species: a tot = (1 – f uc)a c + f uc a uc, where f uc represents the fraction unconjugated, a uc (in arbitrary units) is the activity of the unconjugated σ54, and a c is the activity of the conjugated σ54 (in arbitrary units). The above equation was used to calculate the percentage of transcription activity relative to the wild-type σ54 of the single-cysteine σ54 following FeBABE conjugation.Native Gel Mobility Shift Assays—These were conducted essentially as described in Ref. 12Wedel A. Kustu S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2042-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar in STA buffer. Binding reactions (10 μl) were conducted using 1 μm FeBABE-conjugated σ54 and 20 nm early melted probe. Free DNA was separated from σ54-bound DNA on a native 4.5% polyacrylamide gel run in 25 mm Tris, 200 mm glycine buffer at room temperature.DNA Cleavage Assays—DNA cleavage assays were conducted at 37 °C in cleavage buffer (40 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA). Where indicated, 1 μm FeBABE-conjugated σ54, 200 nm σ54-RNAP, 5 μm PspF, 4 mm NTPs (ATP or GTP), 100 μg/ml heparin, and 10 nm promoter template (homoduplex probe, early melted probe, or pMKC28) were used. In assays using the Δflap core RNAP, σ54-RNAP was reconstituted with a 1:4 molar ratio of Δflap core RNAP to σ54. Where indicated, ascorbate (pH 7.0) and hydrogen peroxide were used at final concentrations of 2 and 1 mm, respectively.Linear Template Cleavage—Binding assays were conducted using the homoduplex or early melted promoter probes reconstituted with either the nontemplate or template strand end-labeled with γ-32P. Following incubation for 5 min, cleavage was initiated by the sequential addition of ascorbate and hydrogen peroxide. The reactions were allowed to proceed for 10 min before quenching with 30 μl of stop buffer (0.1 m thiourea and 100 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA). The stopped reactions were phenol/chloroform-extracted and precipitated with ethanol. Recoveries of DNA were determined by dry Cerenkov counting, and equal numbers of counts were loaded onto 10% denaturing gels. Dried gels were visualized and analyzed using a Phosphor-Imager. The cleavage sites were determined by using γ-32P end-labeled fragments of the S. meliloti nifH promoter DNA.Supercoiled Template Cleavage—Binding and cleavage reactions were conducted as described above. For open complex formation, ATP and a truncated form of the σ54-dependent activator (PspF1–275) that lacks the DNA binding domain and activates transcription from solution (30Bordes P. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Schumacher J. Zhang X. Chaney M. Buck M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2278-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) were added for 10 min. For initiated complex formation, PspF1–275 and GTP were added for 10 min, which allows the synthesis of an RNA trimer from the S. meliloti nifH promoter (18Chaney M. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1200-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Where indicated, the heparin challenge was conducted for 2 min. Following cleavage, the reactions were stopped by purifying the cleaved DNA using QIAquick spin columns (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The eluate containing the cleaved DNA was dried using a speed-vacuum drier and resuspended in 10 μl of 1× Deep Vent (exo–) DNA polymerase buffer (New England Biolabs). The sites of FeBABE-mediated cleavage on both promoter DNA strands were identified by primer extension PCR using γ-32P-end-labeled primers pMKC-F (5′-gacactgtccgtagcccttgtcggc-3′; for the nontemplate strand) and pMKC-R2 (5′-gatggcagctctgcgtcagatcgcg-3′; for the template strand). The primer extension PCRs (final reaction volume of 6.2 μl) were conducted in Deep Vent (exo–) DNA polymerase buffer (New England Biolabs) using 1 μl of cleaved template DNA (from above), 0.2 μl of 3% Triton X-100, 0.3 μl of 2.5 mm dNTP mix, 0.5 μl of 1 μm γ-32P-endlabeled primer, and 0.3 μl of Deep Vent DNA polymerase (2000 units/μl). Following extension by PCR (30-s denaturing at 95 °C, 15-s annealing at 65 °C, and 40-s extension at 72 °C over 10 cycles), the reactions were stopped with 4 μl of formamide dye and loaded directly onto a 10% denaturing gel. The dried gel was visualized and analyzed as described above. The cleavage sites were determined by sequencing pMKC28 using the chain termination method either with γ-32P-end-labeled primer pMKC-F or pMKC-R2 using the T7 Sequenase Quick-Denature plasmid sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences).Elongation Complex Formation—Elongation complexes where more than 3 nucleotides of RNA was synthesized were formed as outlined in Fig. 7. Briefly, σ54 Cys463-RNAP was incubated in cleavage buffer for 10 min at 37 °C with pMKC28 in the presence of 4 mm GTP, ATP, and CTP and 4 μm PspF1–275 to allow synthesis of more than 3 and probably 9 nucleotides of RNA (5′-GGGCGCGCA-3′) from the S. meliloti nifH promoter. FeBABE-mediated DNA cleavage within the stalled elongation complex was conducted and analyzed as described above. For transcription from the stalled elongation complex, 0.05 mm UTP (0.25 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol) was added to the reaction and incubated for a further 10 min. The transcription reactions were stopped and analyzed as described above.Fig. 7The spatial relationship between σ54 and the –24 promoter region changes during early elongation. The experimental strategy is outlined at the top. Early elongation complexes (σ54 Cys463-RNAPEC) were formed with σ54-RNAP reconstituted with 1:1 molar ratio (400 nm) of FeBABE-conjugated σ54 Cys463 and core RNAP. Cold nucleotides were used at 4 mm final concentration, and PspF1–275 was at 4 μm. Following challenge with heparin (100 μg/ml) and the addition of ascorbate and hydrogen peroxide, the reaction was split in two. a, nontemplate strand cleavage within promoter complexes formed on pMKC28 in the presence (lanes 1 and 2) and absence (lanes 3 and 4) of core RNAP. The dotted line in lane 2 indicates the “missing cleavage sites” at the –24 position within σ54 Cys463-RNAPEC. b, transcription from the Cys463-RNAPEC promoter complex after adding [α-32P]UTP. c, transcription from heparin-resistant initiated FeBABE-conjugated Cys463-RNAP promoter complexes (as in Fig. 6a, lanes 8 and 16) after adding [α-32P]UTP. In a–c, the plus and minus signs indicate the presence and absence of ascorbate and hydrogen peroxide in the reactions, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DNase I Footprinting Assays—The binding reactions for DNase I footprinting were conducted under the cleavage conditions described above but in the absence of ascorbate and hydrogen peroxide. For DNase I footprinting of promoter complexes on pMKC28, 1.75 × 10–3 units of DNase I (Amersham Biosciences) was added for 1 min and stopped with 20 μl of DNase I stop buffer (400 mm NaCl, 30 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS), and the reactions were treated as described above for FeBABE cleavage. For DNase I footprinting of promoter complexes formed on the early melted probe, following DNase I treatment, un-bound and RNAP-bound DNA were separated by native PAGE. Un-bound and RNAP-bound DNA were then excised from the gel. Gelisolated DNA was eluted into 0.1 mm EDTA overnight at 37 °C, and recovery of the isolated DNA was determined by dry Cerenkov counting. Equal numbers of counts were loaded onto a 10% denaturing gel. The dried gel was visualized and analyzed as described above.RESULTSCreation of Functional σ54-FeBABE DerivativesFeBABE is a bifunctional chelating agent that conjugates to the sulfhydryl group of cysteine residues. It can be introduced at single positions along a polypeptide chain by designing variants of the protein containing a unique accessible cysteine. After the addition of ascorbate and hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals are generated at the iron ion attached to the BABE, which cleave DNA and polypeptide chains in its proximity (∼12 Å plus the 3 Å diffusion distance of the hydroxyl radicals) (28Ishihama A. Chem. Commun. 2000; 13: 1091-1094Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Previously, we constructed a functional K. pneumoniae rpoN (σ54) gene in which two naturally occurring cysteine codons were replaced by alanine codons (29Wigneshweraraj S.R. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Buck M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3038-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We have introduced unique cysteines into several positions of the altered K. pneumoniae rpoN. Sites were chosen based on data that indicated that these positions would result in neither complete inactivation nor deregulation of σ54 (16Wang L. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8979-8986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 20Taylor M. Butler R. Chambers S. Casimiro M. Badii F. Merrick M.J. Mol.

Biol. 1999; 292: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Unique cysteines were introduced at a single position in Region I (Leu46) and at three positions in the RpoN box (Arg455, Lys460, and Glu463) (Fig. 1b). A cysteine residue was also introduced at Lys474, the most C-terminal positively charged residue in σ54 (Fig. 1b), to orient the C terminus with respect to the RpoN box residues and the –24 promoter region. The resulting single-cysteine σ54 derivatives (Cys46, Cys455, Cys460, Cys463, and Cys474) were assayed for activator-dependent in vitro transcription from the supercoiled S. meliloti nifH promoter (pMKC28). Assays were conducted with subsaturating amounts of σ54-RNAP to allow quantitative comparisons of σ54-RNAPs reconstituted with the mutant σ54 variants. σ54-RNAPs reconstituted with each single-cysteine σ54 subunit exhibited >50% activity compared with the wild-type σ54-RNAP (Table I). Replacement of all endogenous cysteines with alanine residues and the introduction of cysteine residues at selected positions clearly had no gross negative effect on the activity of σ54.Each single-cysteine σ54 variant as well as the control cysteine-free protein Cys(–) σ54 were derivatized with the FeBABE reagent under native conditions, and the conjugation yield was determined (33Greiner D.P. Miyake R. Moran J.K. Jones A.D. Negishi T. Ishihama A. Meares C.F. Bioconjugate Chem. 1997; 8: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The conjugation yield for single-cysteine σ54 variants Cys46, Cys455, and Cys474 was estimated to be >60% (Table I). The single-cysteine σ54 variants Cys460 and Cys463 proved difficult to conjugate under native conditions (conjugation yields <20%; data not shown). Since the hydrophobic reagent CPM reacted with high yield at cysteines 460 and 463 and the hydrophilic reagent FeBABE did not (data not shown), we suggest that residues 460 and 463 are probably slightly buried or located in a hydrophobic region in the folded state of σ54. When FeBABE conjugation reaction with Cys460 and Cys463 was performed under denaturing conditions, the renatured Cys460 and Cys463 σ54 variants exhibited conjugation yields of 63 and 95%, respectively (Table I). The Cys(–) σ54 variant did not react with CPM and FeBABE, clearly implying that under the conditions used, FeBABE conjugation occurred only at the free sulfhydryl group of cysteine residues (Table I).To determine the effects of FeBABE conjugation on σ-RNAP formation and transcription, we performed in vitro activator-dependent single-round transcription assays. After correcting for the presence of unconjugated σ54, the σ54-RNAPs reconstituted with FeBABE-conjugated Cys455, Cys463, and Cys474 σ54 variants showed >55% transcription activity compared with the wild-type σ54-RNAP (Table I). In contrast, σ54-RNAPs reconstituted with FeBABE-conjugated Cys46 and Cys460 σ54 variants showed about 40% of transcription activity (Table I), suggesting that the presence of the 490-Da FeBABE molecule at positions 46 and 460 somehow modestly interferes with one or more events of the transcription reaction. Nevertheless, since all FeBABE-modified σ54-RNAPs were significantly active for promoter-complex formation and transcription initiation (data not shown; Table I), we conclude that the cleavage pattern by hydroxyl radicals should be a reasonable marker of the distance between the tethered residue and the DNA bases at which the cleavage occurs.Promoter DNA Cleavage by FeBABE-conjugated σ54 and σ54-RNAPWe used a heteroduplex variant of the S. meliloti nifH promoter to study the spatial proximity relationships. This 88-bp heteroduplex probe (early melted probe) mimics the conformation of the promoter DNA in the closed promoter complex (Fig. 1a) (12Wedel A. Kustu S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2042-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and σ54 binds to the early melted probe much better than to the homoduplex probe (12Wedel A. Kustu S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2042-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The ear"

Nitrogenase, the bacterial enzyme responsible for nitrogen fixation, catalyzes the reduction of nitrogen gas (N2) to ammonium in an ATP-dependent manner. Nitrogenase has two components: dinitrogenase (otherwise known as the MoFe protein, NifDK, or component I) and dinitrogenase reductase (also known as the Fe protein, NifH, or component II). Dinitrogenase is a 240-kDa α2β2 tetramer of the nifD and nifK gene products (1Kim J. Rees D.C. Nature. 1992; 360: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) that contains two interesting types of metal clusters: an iron-molybdenum cluster conjugated with homocitrate (FeMo-co) 1The abbreviations used are: FeMo-co, iron-molybdenum cofactor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PEG, polyethylene glycol. and an 8Fe-7S center (P-cluster). Dinitrogenase reductase is a 60-kDa α2-dimer of the nifH gene product with a single 4Fe-4S cluster coordinated between the two subunits (2Georgiadis M.M. Komiya H. Chakrabarti P. Woo D. Kornuc J.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1653-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The assembly of FeMo-co in vivo is a complex biosynthetic process that requires the products of at least six nitrogen fixation (nif) genes: nifB, nifE, nifH, nifN, nifQ, and nifV (3Shah V.K. Rangaraj P. Chatterjee R. Allen R.M. Roll J.T. Roberts G.P. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2797-2801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the nafY product is required under conditions of molybdenum starvation (4Rubio L.M. Rangaraj P. Homer M.J. Roberts G.P. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14299-14305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and nifX is required for in vitro FeMo-co synthesis (3Shah V.K. Rangaraj P. Chatterjee R. Allen R.M. Roll J.T. Roberts G.P. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2797-2801Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The component polypeptides of mature dinitrogenase (NifDK) are not required for FeMo-co synthesis. In a nifB deletion strain of Azotobacter vinelandii, the synthesis of FeMo-co is interrupted, and cells accumulate a hexameric form of dinitrogenase (α2β2γ2), known as apodinitrogenase (5Paustian T.D. Shah V.K. Roberts G.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3515-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The hexameric apodinitrogenase has a complete P-cluster assembly but lacks FeMo-co. Substrate reduction can be achieved in vitro after activation of apodinitrogenase by the addition of purified FeMo-co. Upon activation, the γ-subunits disassociate, and mature dinitrogenase (α2β2) is formed. In Klebsiella pneumoniae, the apodinitrogenase γ-subunit has been identified as the product of the nifY gene (6Homer M.J. Paustian T.D. Shah V.K. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4907-4910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, whereas A. vinelandii possesses a nifY gene of unidentified function, its apodinitrogenase γ-subunit is encoded in a non-nif gene termed nafY (4Rubio L.M. Rangaraj P. Homer M.J. Roberts G.P. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14299-14305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). An analysis of the amino acid sequence of NafY reveals that NafY is part of a family of proteins that also includes NifY, NifX, VnfX, and NifB (Fig. 1). All members of this family of proteins have been implicated in the biosyntheses of FeMo-co or FeV-co from the molybdenum- or vanadium-containing dinitrogenases, respectively (see Ref. 7Rubio L.M. Ludden P.W. Leigh G.J. Nitrogen Fixation at the Millenium. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam, The Netherlands2002: 101-136Google Scholar for a recent review). NafY can bind independently to FeMo-co and to apodinitrogenase. It has been suggested that NafY protects FeMo-co before the cofactor is inserted into apodinitrogenase (8Homer M.J. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24745-24752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, NafY may function as a molecular prop that maintains apodinitrogenase in a conformation that facilitates FeMo-co insertion. In an effort to understand the manner in which NafY interacts with apodinitrogenase and its role in FeMo-co incorporation, a structural investigation was initiated. During crystallization trials, it was discovered that the full-length NafY (26 kDa) undergoes adventitious cleavage between residues Leu98 and Glu99 and residues Ser232 and Val233 so that the crystals contained an autonomous “core domain” of 14 kDa that extends from Glu99 to Ser232. In this paper we report the purification, crystallization, and determination of the three-dimensional structure of this domain and its ability to bind FeMo-co. Expression of NafY (Full-length and Core Domain)—Full-length NafY from A. vinelandii was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. The chimera was constructed in the pGEX-4T-3 plasmid (Amersham Biosciences), which incorporates a thrombin cleavage site to remove GST from the fusion partner. nafY was PCR-amplified from plasmid pRHB25 (4Rubio L.M. Rangaraj P. Homer M.J. Roberts G.P. Ludden P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14299-14305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) using oligonucleotides 5′-TAACATATGGTAACCCCCGTGAACATGAG-3′ and 5′-TCGGGATCCTCATGCCCTGGCCGCCTCGTCC-3′ as primers. The nafY gene cartridge was then digested with NdeI and BamHI, made blunt by Klenow treatment, and ligated into the Klenow-treated BamHI site of plasmid pGEX-4T-3 to generate plasmid pRHB62. The fidelity of the construction was confirmed by sequencing. Once it was discovered that the crystals contained a proteolytic cleavage product, a second GST fusion construct was created that encoded only the residues of the core domain of NafY (residues Glu99–Ser232). Protein prepared from the truncated construct was used to grow crystals of the NafY core domain necessary for preparation of heavy atom derivatives. The overproduction of both the full-length and the truncated GST-NafY fusion proteins was carried out in Escherichia coli BL21 (pREP-4). E. coli cells were grown in 250-ml cultures in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and kanamycin (25 μg/ml) at 30 °C. Overexpression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 0.2 mm when the cells reached an optical density of 0.6 at 550 nm. E. coli cells from 2.5 liters of culture were harvested at 5 h postinduction and resuspended in 15 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.4). Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 10% (v/v), and the cells were stored at –80 °C. Purification of NafY—Prior to cell lysis, the cell suspension was supplemented with the protease inhibitors leupeptin (1 μg/ml) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.2 mm). Cells were lysed with a French press at 15,000 p.s.i., followed by centrifugation at 37,000 × g for 30 min to remove cellular debris. Purification of the GST-NafY fusion protein was accomplished within 6 h at room temperature. The clarified cell extract was passed over a 2-ml prepacked glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Both the full-length NafY and the core domain were separated from the GST moiety while bound to the column by incubation for 4 h with 100 units of thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) and then eluted in 6 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. To remove the thrombin, the sample was then loaded onto a 1-ml benzamidine-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline. NafY was retained by the benzamidine-Sepharose resin but could be eluted with 8 ml of phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with NaCl to a final concentration of 1.14 m. The absence of thrombin contamination in pure preparations of NafY was verified using the chromogenic substrate S-2238 (Chromogenic). S-2238 or H-d-phenylalanyl-l-pipecolyl-l-arginine-p-nitroaniline dihydrochloride is cleaved by thrombin between the arginine residue and p-nitroaniline, liberating p-nitroaniline, which in the free form absorbs at 405 nm. No protease was detected with this assay after passage over the benzamidine-Sepharose column. The purified protein was concentrated to 20 mg/ml with a Centricon YM-10 device (Amicon) and then dialyzed in a Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassette (Pierce) for 4 h against 25 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5 at 4 °C. A typical purification procedure yielded 15 mg of protein from 500 ml of cell culture. Initially, the protein was either stored with 10% glycerol and frozen in liquid nitrogen or drop-frozen directly into liquid nitrogen when used in crystallization trials. Anoxic Native Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblot—Anoxic native gel electrophoresis was performed as described previously (9Allen R.M. Chatterjee R. Ludden P.W. Shah V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26890-26896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were resolved on 7–16% acrylamide (37.5:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) and 0–20% sucrose gradient gels. After electrophoresis for 20 h at 100 V, gels were either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblot as described before (10Brandner J.P. McEwan A.G. Kaplan S. Donohue T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 360-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For all samples, 4 μg of NafY protein was used per lane, and when required, 1.5 nmol of FeMo-co was added. Native gels were stained for iron as previously described (11Kuo C.F. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Purification of Other Components—Apodinitrogenase was purified in its NafY-deficient α2β2 form by affinity chromatography utilizing the NafY-GST fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin. 2L. M. Rubio and P. W. Ludden, unpublished results. The resultant protein was dialyzed anaerobically against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, prior to use in the native gel experiments. Crystallization of NafY Core Domain—Crystals of NafY core domain were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at room temperature. Typically, 3 μl of NafY protein at 10 mg/ml was combined with an equal volume of 13% PEG 10,000, 2.5% glycerol, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Crystals grew to a size of 0.2 × 0.2 × 0.5 mm within 6 days if they were obtained from the full-length construct, for which adventitious proteolysis was necessary for crystal formation, whereas crystals from the core domain construct would grow to these dimensions after 2 days. The crystals belonged to space group P3221 and had cell dimensions of a = 49.7 Å, b = 49.7 Å, c = 101.3 Å, and γ = 120°. Structural Analysis of NafY—The initial structural analysis was performed with x-ray data collected to 2.6-Å resolution with CuKα radiation at 4 °C with a Bruker HISTAR area detector equipped with Supper long mirrors. The x-ray source was a Rigaku RU200B x-ray generator operated at 50 kV and 90 mA. The x-ray data were processed with XDS (12Kabsch W. J. Appl.

Open table in a new tab Crystals used for the preparation of heavy atom derivatives and the initial native data set were stabilized in synthetic mother liquor containing 20% PEG 10,000, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.5. Two isomorphous heavy atom derivatives were prepared by soaking native crystals in either 12 mm KAu(CN)2 for 3 days or 10 mm trimethyllead acetate for 7 days (14Holden H.M. Rayment I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 291: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). X-ray data for the heavy atom derivatives were collected to 2.6-Å resolution. The isomorphous R-factors between the native, gold, and lead derivative data sets were 16.5 and 9.5%, respectively. Heavy atom binding sites (two per derivative) were determined with SOLVE (15Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). The positions, occupancies, and temperature factors of these sites were refined with SOLVE, yielding an overall figure of merit of 0.32. The phases were improved by solvent flattening with RESOLVE (16Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1937-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) to give a figure of merit of 0.56 for the solvent-flattened electron density map. The polypeptide chain was built into the electron density map with the program TURBO (17Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. 1991; 86 (Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA)Google Scholar) and refined with TNT (18Tronrud D.E. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 306-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). High Resolution X-ray Data Collection and Least Squares Refinement—Prior to high resolution data acquisition, the crystals were flash-frozen. The crystals were transferred sequentially from the synthetic mother liquor to a cryoprotective solution in five equal steps starting from 20% PEG 10,000, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, to a final cryoprotectant concentration of 20% PEG 10,000, 500 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 17% ethylene glycol and flash-frozen in a nitrogen stream at –160 °C. The unit cell parameters, after freezing, for proteolyzed native NafY were as follows: a = 49.2 Å, b = 49.2 Å, c = 99.2 Å, and γ = 120°. A native x-ray data set was collected to 1.8-Å resolution at the Structural Biology Beamline 19-ID at the Advanced Photon Source and processed and scaled with HKL2000 (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38609) Google Scholar). This structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program AMORE (20Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) starting from the refined structure determined at 2.6-Å resolution. Iterative cycles of least-squares refinement and manual model building reduced the R-factor to 19.4% for all measured x-ray data from 30.0- to 1.8-Å resolution. The R-free was 26.3% for 10% of the data that were excluded from the refinement. Least-squares refinement statistics are presented in Table II. Analysis of the coordinates with the program PROCHECK (21Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) revealed that 88.6% of the residues lie in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, whereas the remaining 11.4% of the residues lie in additionally allowed areas. No residues are located in the disallowed regions.

Open table in a new tab In Situ Generation of the Naf Y Core Domain—The initial goal of this study was to determine the structure of the full-length NafY protein from A. vinelandii (243 amino acids and a molecular weight of 26,141). However, it was discovered during crystallization trials that NafY protein is highly susceptible to adventitious proteolytic cleavage, which yields a truncated protein that crystallizes readily. To date, the full-length NafY protein has not been crystallized. The presence of the full-length NafY protein in the initial material was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and by mass spectroscopy. No obvious contaminating proteins or degradation products were observed (data not shown). However, the hanging drop crystallization experiments yielded diffraction quality crystals of a truncated product of the NafY protein. NafY crystals were isolated, dissolved in Tris buffer; and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, mass spectroscopy, and N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The results of these analyses demonstrated that NafY crystals contained a stable domain composed of 134 amino acids with a molecular weight of 14,337 that extends from residue Glu99 to Ser232 in the sequence of the full-length NafY. We have termed this domain the core domain of NafY because it is found conserved in all members of the NafY/NifY/NifX/VnfX/NifB family of proteins. One explanation for the production of this truncated product of NafY would be the presence of a trace amount of an unidentified protease that would co-elute during the purification of NafY. An obvious candidate is the thrombin used to separate NafY from the GST moiety. However, this is unlikely, because the preparations of pure NafY were shown to be free of thrombin activity when assayed with the chromogenic substrate S-2238. Moreover, purified GST-NafY fusion protein, which was not thrombin-treated, was also cleaved after being 48 h at room temperature (data not shown). Attempts to prevent the adventitious cleavage of NafY with benzamidine were unsuccessful. In order to reproduce the results in a controlled way, a truncated version of nafY was constructed, starting at Glu99 and ending at Ser232 of the native sequence. This fragment was fused to the GST gene, overexpressed in E. coli, and purified in the same manner as the full-length NafY. Identical crystals were obtained from the engineered truncated version of NafY and the in situ proteolyzed NafY. This observation shows that the fragment of NafY that extends from Glu99 to Ser232 is able to fold independently and thus constitutes a true domain. Structural Description—The electron density map for the core domain of NafY is continuous and well defined for almost all of the residues from Glu99 to Val221, where the remaining 11 residues, Gly222–Ser232, are disordered but present within the crystal. The coordinate set also includes 180 water molecules and one molecule of ethylene glycol. The polypeptide consists of a single domain that is dominated by a mixed five-stranded β-sheet flanked on both sides by α-helices, three on one side and two on the other (Fig. 3). The strand order within the sheet is 3-2-1-4-5, where β-strand 2 is antiparallel to the other strands. The α-helices on one side of the β-sheet occur between β-strands 3 and 4, and between strands 4 and 5. The two α-helices on the opposite side of the β-sheet occur after β5. Thus, the order of the secondary structural elements from the N to C termini is β1-β2-β3-α1-α2-β4-α3-β5-α4-α5. The secondary structural elements are defined as follows: β-strand 1, residues Ser105–Asn113; β-strand 2, residues Leu126–Ser134; β-strand 3, residues Asp137–Ser145; α-helix 1, residues Thr146–Ala150; α-helix 2, residues Ala152–Ile163; β-strand 4, residues Gln167–Val172; α-helix 3, residues Gly176–Gly186; β-strand 5, residues Ile187–Lys192; α-helix 4, residues Ala197–Ala210; α-helix 5, residues Pro214–Val221. There are two large loops positioned at the same side of the NafY core domain, one between β1 and β2 and the other between β3 and α1. This arrangement of secondary structural elements is similar to the ribonuclease H motif as defined in SCOP (22Lo Conte L. Ailey B. Hubbard T.J. Brenner S.E. Murzin A.G. Chothia C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 257-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). A search of the protein structure data base (23Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J. Meyer Jr., E.E.

Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar, 26Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) reveals that the structure of the NafY core domain is most similar to that of the 124-amino acid protein MTH1175 from the thermophilic archeobacterium Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (27Cort J.R. Yee A. Edwards A.M. Arrowsmith C.H. Kennedy M.A. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2000; 1: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) (RCSB accession number 1EO1). The Z-score for the comparison of NafY core domain and MTH1175 is 10.0, whereas the next highest match (Z = 6.0) corresponds to the Holliday junction resolvase (RuvC), which belongs to the ribonuclease H fold superfamily (the Z-score represents the strength of the structural similarity in S.D. values above the expected value for a random match). The overall root mean square difference in the positions of the α-carbons when NafY and MTH1175 are superimposed with the program ALIGN (28Cohen G.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1160-1161Crossref Scopus (373) Google Scholar) is 1.4 Å for 92 structurally equivalent residues, which represent 75% of the total number of residues in the NafY core domain (Fig. 4). These two polypeptides have a remarkably similar structure, considering that the overall sequence identity between them is only ∼15% (Fig. 1). Although the function of MTH1175 is unknown, it also belongs to the ribonuclease H fold superfamily (22Lo Conte L. Ailey B. Hubbard T.J. Brenner S.E. Murzin A.G. Chothia C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 257-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), whose members are involved in binding to DNA or hybrid DNA-RNA complexes (27Cort J.R. Yee A. Edwards A.M. Arrowsmith C.H. Kennedy M.A. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2000; 1: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As a consequence, proteins in the ribonuclease H fold class frequently exhibit distinct patches of surface positive charges that interact with the negatively charged phosphate backbones of the nucleic acid strands. Interestingly, NafY also exhibits a very nonrandom charged surface that can be roughly described as negatively charged on one side and positively charged upon the other (Fig. 5). Although there is unequivocal evidence that NafY interacts with dinitrogenase and with FeMo-co, there is no experimental evidence to suggest that NafY interacts with DNA or RNA molecules. However, NafY belongs to a family of proteins whose members are involved at different steps in the biosynthesis of FeMo-co, including NifX and NifY proteins, and it has been reported that both NifX and NifY from K. pneumoniae can influence the stability of the nifHDK mRNA, which encodes the structural components of dinitrogenase and dinitrogenase reductase (29Simon H.M. Gosink M.M. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3751-3760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Gosink M.M. Franklin N.M. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1441-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The deletion of nifY or nifX genes in K. pneumoniae increases the stability of the nifHDK mRNA, which accumulates to higher levels than in the wild-type strain under conditions of nitrogenase expression. Conversely, when nifY or nifX are overexpressed, the stability of the nifHDK mRNA is reduced, and it accumulates at lower levels than in the wild type. Given their amino acid sequence similarity to NafY, it is likely that NifX and the C-terminal domain of NifY (Fig. 1) have similar structures to that of the NafY core domain and, in turn, to ribonuclease H. This extrapolation would give structural credence to the reports by Roberts and collaborators (29Simon H.M. Gosink M.M. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3751-3760Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Gosink M.M. Franklin N.M. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1441-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) assigning a role for NifX and NifY as negative regulators of nitrogenase expression. The Different Roles of NafY Rely on Different Domains of the Protein—The primary role of NafY appears to be that of a molecular chaperone that maintains apodinitrogenase in a conformation that facilitates receipt of FeMo-co, thereby acting as a metallo-insertase (8Homer M.J. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24745-24752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, NafY can bind in vitro to FeMo-co, suggesting that this protein has two distinct activities. The presence of multiple domains within NafY, as suggested by the facile generation and stability of the core domain and by amino acid sequence alignments with NafY homologs, raises the question of whether the molecular chaperone and FeMo-co binding functions of NafY are mediated by different modules within the polypeptide chain. To address this question, the ability of the core domain to bind FeMo-co was investigated by anoxic native gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 6, the addition of FeMo-co to the full-length NafY results in faster gel migration of the resulting species. Native gel shift mobility of NafY upon FeMo-co binding has been extensively used to assay for the presence of a NafY-FeMo-co complex. It suggests that the protein is either more compact in the presence of FeMo-co or that the net charge on the protein has changed. Similarly, the addition of FeMo-co to the core domain of NafY results in a shift of mobility in native gels. This experiment implies that FeMo-co can bind to both proteins as is confirmed by staining the gels for iron, which only binds at the gel-shifted positions corresponding to the NafY-FeMo-co complexes. These experiments establish that the FeMo-co binding capacity of NafY resides within the core domain. The identification of a specific binding site for FeMo-co on the NafY core domain is under investigation. The ability of the core domain to interact with a purified NafY-deficient α2β2 form of apodinitrogenase was also examined. This form of apodinitrogenase was purified from an A. vinelandii mutant strain with deletions in nifB and nafY genes. It has been previously shown that the full-length NafY binds to apodinitrogenase in crude extracts of A. vinelandii (8Homer M.J. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24745-24752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Anoxic native gel electrophoresis, followed by immunoblotting with antibodies to either NafY or to dinitrogenase, revealed that full-length NafY has the ability to bind and comigrate with purified apodinitrogenase (Fig. 7, lanes 2 and 7). However, the NafY core domain does not co-electrophorese with apodinitrogenase, indicating that it binds weakly or not at all under these conditions (Fig. 7, compare lanes 1 and 6). It is noteworthy that the full-length NafY has a low isoelectric point (pI = 4.6) when compared with the calculated isoelectric point for the NafY core domain (pI = 7.2), indicating that the N-terminal region of NafY (Met1–Leu98) is negatively charged. Interestingly, the structure of a NafY-deficient α2β2 apodinitrogenase reveals a solvent-exposed region rich in positive charges in the proximity of the FeMo-co binding site (31Schmid B. Ribbe M.W. Einsle O. Yoshida M. Thomas L.M. Dean D.R. Rees D.C. Burgess B.K. Science. 2002; 296: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). That region is found buried inside the protein in the three-dimensional structure of mature holodinitrogenase, once the FeMo-cofactor has been inserted (32Kim J. Rees D.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1677-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). This observation, together with the fact that the core domain of NafY is not able to bind to apodinitrogenase by itself, suggests that the role of the N-terminal region of NafY might be to recognize the apo state of dinitrogenase. Conclusions—The present study establishes the modular nature of NafY from A. vinelandii. It shows that the C-terminal region of NafY (Glu99–Ser232; referred to here as the core domain) folds autonomously and is sufficient for FeMo-co binding, whereas the N-terminal region of the protein (Met1–Leu98) is required for interaction with apodinitrogenase. The determination of the three-dimensional structure of NafY is of interest because it is the first FeMo-co-binding protein, other than dinitrogenase, that has been solved, and it represents a new fold for FeMo-co binding. The core domain of NafY has a β1-β2-β3-α1-α2-β4-α3-β5-α4-α5 fold and a polarized surface charge distribution that are surprisingly similar to those of the ribonuclease H family. NafY is part of a conserved family of proteins, whose members are involved at different steps in the biosynthesis of FeMo-co in A. vinelandii and K. pneumoniae, and we predict that the structure presented here represents a general protein fold for the carriage of FeMo-co or FeMo-co precursors.

https://openalex.org/W2096601288,"Genes expressed with day/night rhythms in the mouse liver were searched for by microarray analysis using an in-house array harboring mouse liver cDNAs. The rhythmic expression with a single peak and trough level was confirmed by RNA blot analysis for 3β-Hsd and Gabarapl1 genes exhibiting a peak in the light phase and Spot14, Hspa8, Hspa5, and Hsp84-1 genes showing a peak in the dark phase. On the other hand, mRNA levels for all of the three fibrinogen subunits, Aα, Bβ and γ, exhibited two peaks each in the light and dark phases in a synchronized manner. This two-peaked rhythmic pattern of fibrinogen genes as well as the single peaktrough pattern of other genes was diminished or almost completely lost in the liver of Clock mutant mice, suggesting that the two-peaked expression is also under the control of oscillation-generating genes. In constant darkness, the first peak of the expression rhythm of fibrinogen genes was almost intact, but the second peak disappeared. Therefore, although the first peak in the subjective day is a component of the innate circadian rhythm, the second peak seems to require light stimuli. Fasting in constant darkness caused shifts of time phases of the circadian rhythms. Protein levels of the fibrinogen subunits in whole blood also exhibited circadian rhythms. In the mouse and human loci of the fibrinogen gene cluster, a number of sequence elements resembling circadian transcription factor-binding sites were found. The fibrinogen gene locus provides a unique system for the study of two-peaked day/night rhythms of gene expression in a synchronized form."

We propose and validate a mechanism for the selectivity of SGP toward cell membranes in tumors. SGP is the prototype for a new class of artificial proteins designed for therapeutic applications."
https://openalex.org/W2048645082,"Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and other cytokines induce a state of negative energy balance leading to the breakdown of skeletal muscle. Leptin, another member of the cytokine superfamily, also induces a state of negative energy balance but does not alter lean body mass. The transcription profile of skeletal muscle was compared in animals treated with TNF-α or leptin or in animals pair-fed over a 7-day time course using 11,000-gene microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Ten clusters of skeletal muscle genes were identified, each of which showed significantly different expression between TNF-α treatment and pair feeding. Studies comparing leptin treatment and pair feeding revealed that both activate nearly identical programs of gene expression in skeletal muscle. These data indicate that the effects of leptin on skeletal muscle are markedly different from those of TNF-α and that the effects of leptin on skeletal muscle can be largely ascribed to its anorectic effects. Subtle differences between leptin and pair feeding were evident only after 7 days of treatment. In general, pair feeding altered gene expression after the 7-day treatment, whereas leptin did not. The effects of TNF-α on skeletal muscle are distinct from those of pair feeding, a result consistent with its known catabolic effects on this tissue. Analyses of the data from food-restricted animals also identified a set of transcriptional changes associated with this state. Further studies of many newly identified leptin-, TNF-α-, and starvation-regulated genes and the apparent coordinate regulation of these clusters may reveal important insights into the different effects of cytokines on skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2010995096,"A myosin II is thought to be the driving force of the fast cytoplasmic streaming in the plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum. This regulated myosin, unique among conventional myosins, is inhibited by direct Ca2+ binding. Here we report that Ca2+ binds to the first EF-hand of the essential light chain (ELC) subunit of Physarum myosin. Flow dialysis experiments of wild-type and mutant light chains and the regulatory domain revealed a single binding site that shows moderate specificity for Ca2+. The regulatory light chain, in contrast to regulatory light chains of higher eukaryotes, is unable to bind divalent cations. Although the Ca2+-binding loop of ELC has a canonical sequence, replacement of glutamic acid to alanine in the –z coordinating position only slightly decreased the Ca2+ affinity of the site, suggesting that the Ca2+ coordination is different from classical EF-hands; namely, the specific “closed-to-open” conformational transition does not occur in the ELC in response to Ca2+. Ca2+- and Mg2+-dependent conformational changes in the microenvironment of the binding site were detected by fluorescence experiments. Transient kinetic experiments showed that the displacement of Mg2+ by Ca2+ is faster than the change in direction of cytoplasmic streaming; therefore, we conclude that Ca2+ inhibition could operate in physiological conditions. By comparing the Physarum Ca2+ site with the well studied Ca2+ switch of scallop myosin, we surmise that despite the opposite effect of Ca2+ binding on the motor activity, the two conventional myosins could have a common structural basis for Ca2+ regulation.

Myosins constitute a diverse superfamily of motor proteins providing the driving force in muscle contraction and many forms of actin-based cellular motility. They are typically constructed of three functional domains, which are the motor domain, the neck or light chain binding domain, and a unique tail region that in many myosins forms a coiled-coil dimer. The heavy chain segment in the neck region consists of repeats of α-helical sequences called IQ motifs, each of which binds and is stabilized by one light chain subunit. In conventional myosins (myosin II class) the regulatory light chain (RLC) 1The abbreviations used are: RLC, regulatory light chain; ELC, essential light chain; CaM, calmodulin; RD, regulatory domain; HC, heavy chain; E26A ELC, Physarum ELC containing point mutation E26A; D15A/D17A/E26A ELC, Physarum ELC containing point mutations D15A, D17A, and E26A; E97A ELC, Physarum ELC containing point mutation E97A; S124A/D126A ELC, Physarum ELC containing point mutations S124A/D126A; 1,5-IAEDANS, 5-((((2-iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino) naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid; k off, dissociation rates constant; k on, second order rate constant for divalent cation binding; MOPS, 3-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol. and ELC bind to two tandem IQs, whereas in non-conventional myosins CaM and/or CaM-like proteins bind to one to six tandem IQ motifs (1Sellers J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 3-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Because the neck region is involved in the regulation of many myosins, it is often referred to as the regulatory domain (RD). The light chains belong to the EF-hand family of Ca2+-binding proteins, including CaM, the ubiquitous eukaryotic Ca2+ sensor. CaM has four Ca2+-binding sites, a pair of EF-hands in both the N- and C-terminal domains (lobes); however, most of the divalent cation-binding sites of ELC and RLC have been lost during evolution (2Kawasaki H. Kretsinger R.H. Protein Profile. 1. Academic Press Ltd., London1994: 343-351Google Scholar). Enzymatic and motor activity in the myosin superfamily can be controlled by a variety of mechanisms and regulatory systems associated with either the actin filament or the myosin molecule. Regulation through the RD can be achieved by reversible phosphorylation or direct Ca2+ binding. Vertebrate smooth muscle and non-muscle myosin IIs are activated by phosphorylation of the RLC by a Ca2+/CaM-dependent myosin light chain kinase (3TrybusCell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1991; 18: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the animal kingdom the Mollusca conventional myosins are unique in that they are activated by direct Ca2+ binding to the ELC (4Szent-Györgyi A.G. Kalabokis V.N. Perreault-Micale C.L. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 190: 55-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the lower eukaryote Physarum polycephalum, in contrast to any other known conventional myosins, increase in Ca2+ concentration inhibits the activity of myosin (5Kohama K. Kendrick-Jones J. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 99: 1433-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 6Kohama K. Kohno T. Okagaki T. Shimmen T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 508-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The diverse classes of unconventional myosins are also regulated in part by the interaction of Ca2+ with the CaM subunits; the consequences of the Ca2+ binding can be more complex and are not as well understood as in the myosin II class. Elevated Ca2+ concentration has, in general, an inhibitory effect on the motility of vertebrate myosin I and myosin V as well as the plant-specific myosins (7Wolenski J.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 310-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 8Zhu T. Beckingham K. Ikebe M. J. Biol.

Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Structural studies of the isolated RD (a three-chain complex of ELC, RLC, and a ∼10-kDa fragment of the heavy chain) of scallop myosin II revealed that the triggering Ca2+-binding site is localized in the first EF-hand of ELC (10Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 11Houdusse A. Cohen C. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The conformation of the N-terminal domain of ELC containing the bound Ca2+ is closed rather than open, which is found in the conventional Ca2+-saturated EF-hands. RLC of scallop and all the known higher eukaryotic myosin II contains a divalent metal-binding site in the first EF-hand that preferentially binds Mg2+ and has only a structural role (10Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 11Houdusse A. Cohen C. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic streaming in plasmodia of the myxomycete P. polycephalum is exceedingly vigorous. The cytoplasm streams at a rate about 1.3 mm/s and changes direction every 2–3 min. This oscillatory process is regulated by Ca2+ and is thought to be driven by a conventional myosin (12Kamiya N. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1981; 32: 205-236Crossref Google Scholar). Ca2+ regulates the contractile system of Physarum plasmodia by direct binding to the myosin, and inhibiting its ATPase activity and in vitro motility (5Kohama K. Kendrick-Jones J. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 99: 1433-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 6Kohama K. Kohno T. Okagaki T. Shimmen T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 508-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the ELC is the Ca2+-binding subunit of Physarum myosin (13Kessler D. Eisenlohr L.C. Lathwell M.J. Huang J. Taylor H.C. Godfrey S.D. Spady M.L. Cell Motil. 1980; 1: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 14Kohama K. Uyeda T.O.P. Takano-Ohmuro H. Tanaka T. Yamaguchi T. Maruyama K. Kohama T. Proc. Jpn.

Other mechanisms could also be involved in the regulation or modulation of the activity of the myosin. Phosphorylation of the heavy chain and RLC by heavy chain and light chain kinases, respectively, increases the affinity of myosin to actin; activity of the kinases is suppressed by Ca2+; however, at high actin concentrations existing in vivo in the plasmodium, phosphorylation has a negligible effect on regulation of myosin (6Kohama K. Kohno T. Okagaki T. Shimmen T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 508-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A caldesmon-like actin-binding protein can stimulate the ATPase activity of myosin. This effect is inhibited by Ca2+-CaM (16Ishikawa R. Okagaki T. Higashi-Fujime S. Kohama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21784-21790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ishikawa R. Okagaki T. Kohama K. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1992; 13: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To compare the structural basis of the two, oppositely regulated Ca2+-binding conventional myosins, we initiated studies to localize and characterize the regulatory calcium-binding site of Physarum myosin using recombinant LCs and RD. The results reveal that there is one Ca2+-binding site per head in the myosin. By mutating all of the EF-hands, which were predicted to be competent metal-binding sites based on sequence analysis, we demonstrate that the first EF-hand of the ELC is responsible for Ca2+ binding. Moreover, our results suggest that the N-terminal domain of ELC remains in a closed conformation even in the presence of Ca2+. Wild-type and Mutant Expression Constructs—Total RNA from P. polycephalum plasmodia (strain Ng-1) was obtained by the acidguanidium-phenol-chloroform method (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Purification of RNA and cDNA synthesis was performed as reported earlier (19Nakamura A. Okagaki T. Takagi T. Nakashima K. Yazawa M. Kohama K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3827-3834Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding the RLC and the heavy chain were cloned by PCR using degenerate oligonucleotides designed on the basis of partial peptide sequencing of the isolated myosin subunits and conserved regions within the myosin motor domain (GenBank™ accession numbers AB076705 and AF335500). Details of the cloning procedure will be published elsewhere. Dictyostelium ELC was cloned by PCR based on published sequence (GenBank™ accession number X54161) using total RNA isolated from AX2 cell line. The cDNAs of RLC, ELC, the N- and C-terminal domains of ELC (residues 1–77 and 73–147), the HC fragment of the RD (residues 771–841), and Dictyostelium ELC were subcloned into the expression vectors pET15b or pET21a (Novagen) between the NdeI and BamHI sites. Restriction sites for cloning of the cDNA fragments were introduced by PCR. The pET15b constructs contain an N-terminal fusion His6-tag sequence. To produce RD, an expression vector was constructed containing sequences of all the three chains with three separate promoters. The pET15b/HC construct was digested with restriction enzymes BglII and BamHI, and the resulting 370-bp fragment containing the sequence of the T7 promoter and the HC fragment of RD was inserted into the unique BamHI site of pET21a/ELC construct. In a similar way, a third sequence cassette containing the RLC-coding sequence together with the T7 promoter was subcloned from pET21a/RLC into the BamHI sites of pET21a/ELC vector. In the three-insert construct, only the HC fragment is fused to a His6-tag sequence. Site-directed mutagenesis of ELC was performed by PCR using the megaprimer method with the following oligonucleotides: E26A, GTCCATAGAGGCCTTGGGCAGTGCCC; D15A and D17A, TCCAGATCTTCGCCAAGGCCAATGACGGCAAG; E97A, CAAGAGCTGTCTCAACGCAGCCTCCTGGATG; S124A and D126A, GTTAATAGCTCCGGCACCAGCCACAGACACTTCC. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS as described previously (19Nakamura A. Okagaki T. Takagi T. Nakashima K. Yazawa M. Kohama K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3827-3834Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The light chains were purified under denaturating conditions. Cells were suspended in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml pepstatin A and homogenized with sonication. The homogenate was centrifuged at 50,000 × g, and the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+ chelate column (ProBond, Invitrogen); the column was washed with a buffer containing 8 m urea, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate at pH 6.0 and 5.3, and the recombinant protein was eluted at pH 4.0. The RD was purified under non-denaturing conditions; cells were suspended in 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 3 mm NaN3, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride on ice. After sonication and centrifugation of the homogenate, the supernatant was loaded on a ProBond column and washed with the same buffer at pH 6.0 containing 50 mm imidazole, and the RD was eluted by increasing the concentration of imidazole to 0.5 m. The eluted light chains and RD were dialyzed against 20 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 3 mm NaN3, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT and loaded onto a Mono Q ion exchange column equilibrated with the same buffer. The absorbed proteins were eluted by a linear gradient of NaCl to 0.5 m. Purification of Physarum Myosin—Plasmodia of Physarum were grown on Quaker oatmeal according to Camp (20Camp W.G. Bull. Torrey Bolt. Club. 1936; 63: 205-210Crossref Google Scholar) with some modifications (21Hatano S. Oosawa F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 127: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Myosin was isolated from the collected plasmodia by the high salt extraction method as described earlier (5Kohama K. Kendrick-Jones J. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 99: 1433-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Calcium Binding Experiments—The extent of Ca2+ binding was measured by the flow dialysis method according to Nakashima et al. (22Nakashima K. Maekawa H. Yazawa M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5602-5610Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Nakashima K. Ishida H. Ohki S.Y. Hikichi K. Yazawa M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with 45CaCl2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 0.1 m NaCl, 20 mm MOPS/NaOH, pH 7.0, at 25 °C in the presence or absence 2 mm MgCl2. The protein concentrations were 25–100 μm. The loss of radioactive ligand during the experiments and the nonspecific Ca2+ binding to the flow dialysis cell were corrected. In some experiments we measured Ca2+ binding by equilibrium dialysis as described previously (24Chantler P.D. Sellers J.R. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) at 22 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm MOPS/NaOH, pH 7.0, 3 mm NaN3, 0.11 mm45CaCl2, and various concentrations of EGTA to obtain the desired free Ca2+ concentration. The resulting Ca2+-binding data were analyzed by fitting to the Adair-Klotz equation (25Edsall J.T. Wyman J. Biophysical Chemistry. 1. Academic Press, Inc., New York1958: 591-662Crossref Google Scholar) for single binding site, y=[Ca2+]KCa2+1+[Ca2+]KCa2++j[Ca2+](Eq. 1) where K Ca2+ is the apparent macroscopic dissociation constant for Ca2+, y is the number of bound Ca2+ ions, and j is the correction factor for nonspecific binding. The macroscopic dissociation constant for Mg2+ was calculated from Ca2+-binding data in the presence of Mg2+ fitted to the equation describing the competition of Ca2+ and Mg2+ for single binding site, y'=[Ca2+]KMg2+KMg2+KCa2++KCa2+[Mg2+]+KMg2+[Ca2+]+j[Ca2+](Eq. 2) where K Mg2+ is the macroscopic dissociation constant for Mg2+, K Ca2+ is the macroscopic dissociation constant for Ca2+, y′ is the number of bound Ca2+ ions (mol/mol) at a given Mg2+ concentration, and j is the correction factor for nonspecific binding. ELC Labeling with 1,5-IAEDANS—Wild-type and mutant ELCs containing a single cysteine (Cys-10) were labeled with 3-fold molar excess of 1,5-IAEDANS (Sigma-Aldrich) in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, for 30 min at room temperature. Labeling was terminated with 1 mm DTT, and then the samples were dialyzed overnight against a buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm DTT. Transient Kinetic Assays—Transient kinetic assays were performed using an Applied Photophysics SX18MV stopped flow apparatus with a 150 watt Xe lamp at 22 °C. The dead time of the system was 1.5 ms, as determined earlier (26Kovacs M. Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Wooley R.J. Bagsham C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28459-28467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The assay buffer contained 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 0.1 mm DTT. The IAEDANS-labeled ELCs were excited at 336 nm, and the emission was monitored through a GG455 filter. Ca2+- and Mg2+-saturated IAEDANS-labeled ELCs were rapidly mixed with excess EDTA, respectively. Ca2+ dissociation from RD were investigated by mixing the Ca2+-saturated RD with excess of the calcium indicator Quin 2 (Sigma-Aldrich), which rapidly binds Ca2+, reducing the free calcium concentration to nanomolar range. The samples were excited at a wavelength of 366 nm, and the fluorescence was measured through the GG455 filter. During the determination of Mg2+ dissociation rate from RD by displacement of Mg2+ with Ca2+, the decrease in Ca2+ concentration was detected by using the low affinity calcium indicator Calcium Green 5N (Molecular Probes). The excitation wavelength was 506 nm, and fluorescence was detected through a 530-nm cut-off filter. All data were collected on a logarithmic time base and analyzed by fitting to exponential functions using Origin, version 5.0 (Microcal Software). Second order rate constants (k on) for Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding to ELC and RD were also calculated using the equation, kon=koff/Kd(Eq. 3) where k off is the dissociation rate constant, determined by transient kinetic measurements, and K d is the appropriate macroscopic dissociation constants determined by flow dialysis experiments. Steady-state Fluorescence Studies—Steady-state fluorescence of labeled ELCs was measured at 22 °C in an assay buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm MOPS/NaOH, pH 7.2, 0.1 mm DTT using a Spex Fluoromax spectrofluorometer. The samples were excited at 336 nm, and the fluorescence spectra were collected between 450 and 520 nm. Intrinsic Trp fluorescence of Physarum RD was measured in the same assay buffer, samples were excited at 297 nm, and fluorescence spectra were collected between 310 and 370 nm. The desired free Ca2+ (Mg2+) concentrations were adjusted by adding 0.1 mm EGTA (EDTA) and the appropriate amount of CaCl2 (MgCl2), calculated by the program ALEX (a gift of Dr. M. Vivaudou). Limited Proteolysis of RD—RD (0.5 mg/ml) was incubated at 20 °C with l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated bovine trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) at a ratio of 1:100 (w/w) in a buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl, 20 mm MOPS/NaOH, pH 7.0, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EGTA. The samples were digested in the presence and absence of 0.2 mm CaCl2 for 0–30 min. At predetermined times aliquots were removed, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added. The fractions were immediately boiled in SDS sample buffer and separated by 15% SDS-PAGE. Sequence Analysis of the Light Chains and Design of Mutant ELCs—The primary structure of Physarum ELC and RLC is more homologous with calmodulin (40% sequence identity with vertebrate CaM) than with myosin light chains of higher eukaryotes (30–32 and 27–28% identity with metazoan ELCs and RLCs, respectively). Physarum LCs has the highest homology with light chains of Dictyostelium myosin II (65 and 53% sequence identity in the case of ELC and RLC, respectively). Based on the amino acid sequence of Physarum ELC, EF-hand I, III, and IV are predicted to bind Ca2+ (Table I). EF-hand I and III have regular, CaM-like binding loops, whereas EF-hand IV, termed as “ancestral” EF-hand, was also considered as a potential Ca2+-binding site (17Ishikawa R. Okagaki T. Kohama K. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1992; 13: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The 12-residue loop of a canonical EF-hand provides seven coordination positions for Ca2+ (27Babu Y.S. Sack J.S. Greenhough T.J. Bugg C.E. Means A.R. Cook W.J. Nature. 1985; 315: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 28Babu Y.S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). The amino acid, usually glutamic acid, at the last position (–z) plays a central role in coordinating the calcium in a bidentate manner by its side chain oxygens (29Strynadka N.C. James M.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 951-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) such that its mutation abolishes the Ca2+ binding of canonical EF-hands (30Beckingham K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6027-6030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To localize and characterize the Ca2+-binding site we have constructed ELCs containing point mutations in EF-hand I, -II, and -IV. Glutamic acid in the –z position of the Ca2+-binding loop of motives I and III was changed to alanine in E26A ELC and E97A ELC, respectively. We have also designed a triple mutant D15A/D17A/E26A ELC containing two additional mutations at the x and y positions to ensure complete loss of binding capacity. For studying the metal binding loop of motif IV the double mutant S124A/D126A ELC was constructed. Sequence analysis of Physarum RLC suggested that EF-hand I of RLC cannot be a functional divalent cation-binding site since it contains a glycine in the –z position of the binding loop.Table IAmino acid sequences of the EF-hand loops of Physarum ELC, RLC, EF-hand I of Dictyostelium ELC and mammalian calmodulinPhysarum ELCEF-1 (15-26)DKDNDGKVSIEEEF-2 (41-52)AELNAKEFDLATEF-3 (86-97)DKEGNGTIQEAEEF-4 (111-122)SVSGDGAINYESDictyostelium ELCEF-1 (16-27)DKDNDGKVSVEDMammalian CaMEF-1 (19-30)DKDGDGTITTKEPhysarum RLCEF-1 (29-40)DSERTGFITKEGConsensusDXOXOGX#OXXExyz-y-x-z Open table in a new tab Expression and Purification of Recombinant Light Chains and Regulatory Domain—The wild-type and mutant ELCs, the C- and N-terminal domains of ELC, RLC, and Dictyostelium ELC, were expressed in E. coli to investigate their Ca2+-binding properties. Recombinant Physarum myosin RD was produced by co-expressing ELC, RLC, and the HC fragment (residues 771–841) in E. coli (see “Experimental Procedures”). The RLC and ELC (mutant or wild type) co-purified with the HC fragment containing a His6 affinity tag (see Fig. 6, 0 min), suggesting that the three polypeptide chains can assemble into RD in the bacterial cell and that mutations of ELC do not affect binding of the light chains to the heavy chain fragment. The average yields of RDs and LCs were 15–20 and 35–45 mg of protein/liter of culture media, respectively. Localization and Characterization of the Ca2+-binding Site by Direct Binding Assay—Ca2+ binding measurements are summarized in Figs. 1, 2, 3, and macroscopic dissociation constants, calculated by the Adair-Klotz equation (see “Experimental Procedures”), are summarized in Table II. The wild-type ELC and RD bind one Ca2+ (mol/mol). The RD showed considerably higher Ca2+ affinity than those of ELC; however, the divalent cation-binding site is not highly specific to Ca2+ in either molecule (Fig. 1). Examination of recombinant Dictyostelium ELC by flow dialysis also indicated the presence of one divalent cation-binding site, whereas Physarum RLC did not show any metal binding (Fig. 2). Binding studies of the two separate lobes of Physarum ELC revealed that the Ca2+-binding site is located in the N-terminal domain (Fig. 2). In accordance with these results, the mutants E97A ELC and S124A/D126A ELC (EF-hand III and IV mutants, respectively) show similar calcium-binding capacity to the wild type ELC. Only partial loss of Ca2+ binding was observed in the mutant E26A ELC (EF-hand I mutant), although the glutamic acid in the –z position of a canonical metal binding loop normally provides bidentate coordination for Ca2+. Introduction of two additional mutations in the first and third position of loop I (D15A/D17A/E26A ELC) completely abolished Ca2+ binding to both ELC and RD, indicating that EF-hand I of ELC is the only binding site for divalent cations in Physarum myosin (Fig. 3). Ca2+-binding studies of myosin by equilibrium dialysis showed that Physarum myosin binds 2 mol of Ca2+/mol of protein non-cooperatively with a macroscopic dissociation constant of 4.4 μm in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2 (Fig. 1, inset).Fig. 2Ca2 + binding to RLC and wild-type or mutant ELCs.

Open table in a new tab Transient Kinetics of Divalent Cation Dissociation—Because the metal-binding site in the ELC of Physarum myosin has moderate selectivity for Ca2+ (see Fig. 1 and Table II) it could be occupied by Mg2+ under physiological conditions. To assess whether bound Mg2+ could be exchanged at a physiologically relevant time scale upon increase in Ca2+ concentration, dissociation rates of the two ions from ELC and RD were measured by stopped flow fluorimetry. The results are summarized in Table III and Fig. 4. The divalent cation-sensitive fluorescence of IAEDANS-labeled ELC was used to determine the Ca2+ and Mg2+ dissociation rates of ELC. Wild-type and mutant ELCs containing a single cysteine residue (Cys-10) in the A helix of EF-hand I were stoichiometrically labeled with 1,5-IAEDANS. Ca2+- or Mg2+-saturated IAEDANS-labeled light chains were mixed with an excess of EDTA. The association of divalent cations with EDTA is fast enough (k on of EDTA ≈ 4.5 × 106m–1s–1 for Ca2+ (31Naraghi M. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar)) that the rate-limiting steps in these experiments were the dissociation of Ca2+/Mg2+ from ELC with a k off value of 671.1 s–1 for Ca2+ and with a nearly 40-fold lower value for Mg2+ (k off = 18.1 s–1).

An exceptional case of thermoirreversible opening of the T4 late promoter has been analyzed by KMnO4 footprinting and transcription. T4 late promoters, which consist of an 8-base pair (bp) TATA box “–10” element, are recognized by the small, phage-encoded, highly diverged σ-family initiation subunit gp55. The T4 late promoter only opens above 15–20 °C, but once it has been formed remains open and transcriptionally active for days at –0.5 °C.

Two “extended –10” σ70 promoters, which, like the T4 late promoter, lack “–35” sites, have been subjected to a comparative analysis: the T4 middle promoter PrIIB2 opens and closes thermoreversibly under conditions of basal and MotA- and AsiA-activated transcription. The open galP1 promoter complex, whose transcription bubble is very AT-rich, also closes reversibly upon shift to –0.5 °C, but more slowly than does the rIIB 2 promoter.

Formation of a trapped-open low temperature state of the promoter complex appears to be a singular property of gp55-RNA polymerase holoenzyme. Initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase follows a reaction sequence that generates distinguishable intermediates. 1) RNA polymerase first locates the promoter as double-stranded DNA, forming a closed (transcriptionally incompetent) complex. 2) The closed promoter complex isomerizes to a second, still closed state. 3) This second complex in turn isomerizes to open ∼15 bp of DNA extending from bp –11 beyond the transcriptional start site; the transcribed and non-transcribed DNA strands become widely separated upon promoter opening (1Gnatt A.L.

In general, promoter complexes open with increasing temperature and close when the temperature is lowered; in hyperthermophilic bacteria, for example, promoter opening requires elevated temperatures. 4) In the presence of nucleotides (nt), 1The abbreviation used is: nt, nucleotides. formation of initial transcripts comprising the first few internucleotide linkages generally follows rapidly. Initial steps of RNA synthesis are not processive; short aborted transcripts are produced at all promoters and can be overwhelmingly predominant at some. 5) RNA polymerase clears the promoter by means of processive RNA chain elongation. The production of transcripts at different promoters can be controlled at any of these steps: Activity can be limited at the first step if RNA polymerase affinity for the promoter as duplex DNA is low. The equilibrium at step 2 can be unfavorable, and this step can also be kinetically limiting. Step 3 is generally rapid, but the equilibrium can be unfavorable. The transition to the final step of processive transcript elongation and promoter clearance is limiting at certain promoters at which initial transcripts are repetitively but abortively produced. Individual equilibrium and rate constants associated with these steps are, of course, dependent on environmental variables. Depending on temperature, different steps can present the principal barrier to transcriptional activity at a single promoter (4Brodolin K. Buckle M. J. Mol.

Activators of bacterial transcription can exert their effects by intervening at any one, or at more than one, step. Some activators (such as CRP, the cAMP receptor protein) activate transcription at different promoters by affecting different steps (e.g. Refs. 10Eichenberger P. Dethiollaz S. Buc H. Geiselmann J.

The following complications are encountered in inferring structures of the C1 and C2 intermediate complexes: RNA polymerase holoenzyme may contact both the –35 and –10 promoter elements or only the –35 site in the initial closed C1 complex at different promoters. Such differences of structure must reflect differences of relative affinity for these two sites and of DNA flexibility in the intervening spacer (8Craig M.L. Tsodikov O.V. McQuade K.L.

Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2723-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Analyzing intermediate complexes by equilibrium or steady state methods requires that they adequately accumulate. They may do so fortuitously at some promoters under particular conditions (e.g. at a particular temperature; Ref. 7Cowing D.W. Mecsas J. Record Jr., M.T. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), but this is not necessarily the case. For example, Escherichia coli σ70-RNA polymerase holoenzyme complexes with the phage λPR and lacUV5 promoters do not accumulate the C2 complex as the predominant equilibrium or isothermal steady state component (5Buc H. McClure W.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2712-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 20Roe J.H. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol.

Access to analysis of intermediates is also provided by rapid-kinetic pre-steady state methods (25Buckle M. Fritsch A. Roux P. Geiselmann J. Buc H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 236-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) or by temperature downshift to transiently accumulate an intermediate component ahead of a (kinetically) slow step (4Brodolin K. Buckle M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 5Buc H. McClure W.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2712-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 6Buckle M.

Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 741-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).An analysis of the lacUV5 promoter that combines rapid kinetic and temperature shift approaches brings an interesting complication to light. Lowering the temperature of the lacUV5 open promoter complex from 37 to 14 °C closes the promoter and generates a C2 complex whose inferred structure distinguishes it from the C2 complex that forms transiently during continuous incubation at 22 °C (6Buckle M. Pemberton I.K. Jacquet M.A. Buc H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 955-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Finding that a C2 complex can be (transiently) trapped in apparently different states at temperatures that differ by only 8 °C implies that a kinetically defined C2 promoter complex does not have to be structurally homogeneous and that the multiple molecular species comprising it may be only slowly interconvertible. A distinctive example of irreversibility in promoter interactions has also been noted recently in an analysis of the mechanism of activation of the late genes of bacteriophage T4 (26Kolesky S.E. Ouhammouch M. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 767-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The promoters of these genes consist of a simple TATA box (consensus: TATAAATA) serving as an extended –10 site; there is no –35 site or required specific sequence upstream of the T4 late TATA box (27Christensen A.C. Young E.T. Nature. 1982; 299: 369-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 28Elliott T. Geiduschek E.P. Cell. 1984; 36: 211-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Recognition of T4 late promoters is conferred on the host RNA polymerase core by gp55, the initiation subunit encoded by T4 gene 55. The small (185 amino acids) gp55 has been proposed as a distantly related member of the σ70 family of transcription factors that lacks the protein domain that would interact with a –35 site (29Gribskov M. Burgess R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 6745-6763Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 30Helmann J.D. Chamberlin M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 839-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). The gp55 segment thought to be related to σ70 homology segment 2 does interact with E. coli RNA polymerase core (31Léonetti J.P. Wong K. Geiduschek E.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1467-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and mutagenesis identifies a gp55 segment related to σ70 homology segment 2.2 as an RNA polymerase core binding site (32Wong K. Kassavetis G.A. Leonetti J.P. Geiduschek E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7073-7080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Activation of T4 late transcription by the T4-encoded sliding clamp replication-processivity factor requires the co-activator gp33 and depends on direct interactions of gp33 and gp55 with the sliding clamp (Refs. 33Sanders G.M. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3124-3132Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar and 34Wong K. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol.

Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology. Vol. 11. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1997: 135-150Google Scholar). T4 late promoter opening by the gp55-RNA polymerase holoenzyme is thermoirreversible: the late promoter does not open at 0 °C, but once opened at 30 °C remains open after shift to the lower temperature (26Kolesky S.E. Ouhammouch M. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 767-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). At a hybrid promoter for gp55- and σ70 holoenzymes, only gp55 confers thermoirreversibility of promoter opening. The experiments that are described below pursue the further analysis of this apparently locked-in open promoter. The low temperature-open promoter complex is shown to be transcriptionally competent and extremely long-lived over a range of temperatures. Probing its stability with the competitively binding polyanion heparin and probing its transcription bubble with KMnO4 indicates that the trapped, low temperature-open complex and the open complex formed isothermally at 30 °C are structurally distinctive. These properties of the gp55 holoenzyme promoter complex have been placed in the context of the more studied σ70 holoenzyme by a parallel analysis of open complexes at two “extended –10” σ70 promoters. (These are promoters that also lack a significant –35 promoter element.) The properties of these two σ70 holoenzyme open promoter complexes are shown to differ from those of the open T4 late promoter complex. 1) The T4 middle promoter PrIIB2 opens and closes thermoreversibly. 2) The galP1-35 promoter (36Burns H.D. Belyaeva T.A. Busby S.J. Minchin S.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) also closes at 0 °C once it has been opened at 30 °C, but this extremely AT-rich and readily melting promoter (36Burns H.D.

The analysis suggests that the gp55-RNA polymerase holoenzyme differs from σ70-RNA polymerase holoenzyme in allowing the generation of a trapped-open state of its cognate promoters.

The 568 bp PCR fragment used for KMnO4 footprinting of bacteriophage T4 late promoter (P23) complexes was generated from placO-SK110-rrnB(T1+T2) (26Kolesky S.E. Ouhammouch M. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 767-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A 653-bp PCR fragment from pRT510-C+18 (41Tinker R.L. Williams K.P. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 225-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which contains a hybrid gp55- or σ70-dependent promoter, was used for analysis of transcription. In the presence of ATP, GTP, UTP, and UpG dinucleotide, this construct allows formation of an initial 18-nt transcript; a 427-nt transcript is made in the presence of all four NTPs. The 214-bp PCR fragment used for footprinting and transcription analysis of the bacteriophage T4 middle promoter (PrIIB2) was generated from plasmid pSTS416 (42Ouhammouch M. Adelman K. Harvey S.R. Orsini G. Brody E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This template allows formation of a 120-nt run-off transcript. The 127-bp DNA fragment used for footprinting and transcription analysis of the galP1 promoter and the 115-bp fragment from galP1-35 were generated from plasmids pAA121 and its derivative with other sequence substituted for the UP-element, respectively; these two plasmids were kindly provided by S. Minchin and S. Busby (38Burns H.D. Ishihama A. Minchin S.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2051-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 39Grimes E. Busby S. Minchin S.

Formation and Analysis of Promoter Open Complexes—Standard procedures for assembly of promoter complexes have been described (26Kolesky S.E. Ouhammouch M. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 767-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Promoter DNA (30 and 100 fmol for footprinting and transcription, respectively) and proteins (1 pmol of RNA polymerase core, 6 pmol of gp55 or σ70) were mixed in a 15-μl reaction buffer containing 200 mm potassium acetate, 33 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.8), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 150 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% (w/v) Brij58, and 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG)3300. RNA polymerase core enzyme from uninfected or T4-infected E. coli was used as specified for the individual experiments described below. Promoter complexes were formed for 60 min at 30 °C, then shifted to low temperature for 30 min or for the time noted (Fig. 2) before further analysis. Maintaining temperatures not exceeding 0 °C was assured by performing low temperature manipulations in a 3.5 °C cold room, using a constant temperature bath set to –0.5 °C. KMnO 4 Footprinting—Reaction mixtures containing promoter complexes in a 15-μl volume were mixed with 2 μl of KMnO4 (to 10 mm final concentration for analysis of T4 late promoter complexes and 6 mm for T4 middle and galP1 promoter complexes). Oxidation was stopped after 30 s by adding nine volumes of stop solution containing 200 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, DNA was precipitated with ethanol, dried, reacted with 10% (v/v) piperidine/1 mm EDTA at 90 °C, re-extracted with phenol, and re-precipitated, as described (26Kolesky S.E. Ouhammouch M. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 767-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Equal quantities of radioactivity were loaded for resolution by denaturing PAGE, visualized by phosphorimaging and quantified, as described (26Kolesky S.E. Ouhammouch M. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 767-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Transcription—All transcription experiments assayed single rounds of RNA synthesis. For formation of 19-mer transcripts initiating at the hybrid T4 late promoter (Figs. 1, 4C, and 6), open complexes in 15 μl were mixed with 5 μl of NTPs in reaction buffer, yielding final concentrations of 100 μm UpG, 5 μm each of ATP, GTP, and [α-32P]UTP, and 100 μm 3′ O-methyl CTP (250 μm for the experiment shown in Fig. 4C). Reactions carried out at 30 °C contained 100 μg/ml heparin; heparin was omitted for transcription at –0.5 °C. RNA synthesis was terminated 10 min after addition of nucleotides. For long time course experiments (Fig. 6), samples were incubated for specified times at –0.5 °C, then transferred to 30 °C for 1 min prior to addition of NTPs and heparin for 10 min. Samples were processed, resolved on 23% polyacrylamide gel (37.5:1 acrylamide/bis), analyzed, and quantified by phosphor-imaging. For RNA chain elongation (Fig. 5), the 18-mer initial transcript was formed in the presence of 100 μm UpG, 5 μm each of ATP, GTP, and [α-32P]UTP for 10 min at 30 or –0.5 °C, all four unlabeled NTPs were added to final concentrations of 800 μm, and the reaction was sampled at various times thereafter. RNA was prepared and analyzed as specified above, except that 12% polyacrylamide gel was used to resolve transcripts. For the experiment shown in Fig. 6C, the reaction buffer did not contain polyethylene glycol.Fig. 6Promoter opening and closing at longer time scale. Formation of open T4 late promoter complexes was assayed by ability to form an initial 19-mer transcript in the presence of heparin at 30 °C (see Fig. 4C). A, the late promoter does not open at 9 °C. RNA polymerase and DNA were incubated at 9 °C for the times shown on the abscissa and assayed for formation of open complexes after 1 min at 30 °C (•). Retention of polymerase activity after the indicated times of incubation at 9 °C was measured as the retained capacity of an identical aliquot to form open complexes after shift to 30 °C for 1 h (•). B and C, the open late promoter does not close at –0.5 °C. Retention of open complexes (formed during an initial 60 min at 30 °C) after shift to the low temperature was measured after shift back to 30 °C for only 1 min. Retention of capacity to form open complexes after the indicated times of incubation at –0.5 °C was measured by shifting an identical aliquot to 30 °C for 1 h. B, standard reaction medium; C, the reaction medium did not contain polyethylene glycol.

Open complexes at the T4 hybrid promoter were formed at 30 °C, as described for Fig. 4C, and split into two parts. One sample was shifted to –0.5 °C and incubated for 30 min before adding UpG, ATP, GTP, and [α-32P]UTP for 10 min to allow formation of the initial 18-mer transcript at –0.5 °C (lane 6) prior to chasing with all four unlabeled NTPs for the times indicated above lanes 7–11. The other sample, which remained at 30 °C, was allowed to form the end-labeling 18-mer initial transcript (lane 1), and elongate that transcript with unlabeled NTPs for the times noted above lanes 2–5.

Run-off transcription initiating at the galP1 promoters was carried out with 1 mm ATP, 1 mm UTP, 0.1 mm GTP, 0.1 mm [α-32P]CTP, and 100 μg/ml heparin, but heparin was omitted for transcription at –0.5 °C. Run-off transcripts were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gel.

In contrast, it was recently found that the bacteriophage T4 late promoter open complex formed by gp55-RNA polymerase holoenzyme remains open upon shift to lower temperature (26Kolesky S.E. Ouhammouch M. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 767-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Further analysis of the P23 late promoter open complex by KMnO4 footprinting reveals a stable open conformation that forms rapidly upon temperature shift from 30 to 0 °C (Fig. 2). The low temperature state of the T4 late promoter open complex is characterized by overall lower KMnO4 reactivity in the promoter bubble, together with nearly complete loss of reactivity of T–12 in the transcribed (template) strand (Fig. 2). The T4 late promoter open complex withstands challenge with heparin at 25 °C or 30 °C, but the low temperature-open complex dissipates rapidly in the presence of 100 μg/ml heparin (Fig. 2). The T4 late promoter opens slowly in the absence of its co-activator and sliding clamp activator at 30 °C, under the conditions of these experiments (26Kolesky S.E. Ouhammouch M. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 767-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This makes it possible to use a temperature downshift/upshift sequence to determine whether the quantitative changes of KMnO4 reactivity at –0.5 °C seen in Fig. 2 reflect a partial dissociation of promoter complexes, and whether these low temperature complexes are trapped in an inactive form (Fig. 3). Open promoter complexes were allowed to form at 30 °C for 60 min (lane 1), shifted to –0.5 °C for 30 min (lane 2), then shifted back to 30 °C for a time interval that is too brief to allow appreciable de novo formation of open complexes at this concentration of RNA polymerase holoenzyme (1 and 2 min, lanes 3 and 4, respectively) (26Kolesky S.E. Ouhammouch M. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 767-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and assayed at each step by treatment with KMnO4. Reactivity to permanganate was very rapidly and fully restored upon shift back from –0.5 to 30 °C, indicating that the low temperature and “conventional” (30 °C) states of the T4 late open promoter complex are in rapidly established equilibrium. In contrast, the low temperature-open complex is not formed upon continuous incubation at –0.5 °C on the time scale of the experiment (up to 1.5 h; Fig. 2A, lane 9), or even in 48 h (as we show below). The low temperature open complex is also transcriptionally competent. Promoter escape, detected by disappearance of the promoter transcription bubble, followed upon addition of NTP substrates (Fig. 4, A and B). The open complex held at –0.5 °C for 30 min also fully retained the ability to make the appropriate 19-mer transcript at the low temperature when presented with UpG, ATP, GTP, UTP, and chain-terminating 3′ O-methyl CTP (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 8, 9, and 10 with lane 1), although it lost this capacity rapidly when challenged with heparin before nucleotide addition (compare lanes 3–7 with lanes 8–10), due to disruption of this low temperature open complex (Fig. 2). Indeed, the 18-mer initial transcript elongated at –0.5 °C upon addition of CTP to the three other rNTPs, although elongation was q"
