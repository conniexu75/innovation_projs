https://openalex.org/W2048773492,"Mating behavior in sexually naive and sexually experienced male golden hamsters was totally eliminated by removing their olfactory bulbs. In contrast, the mating behavior in blinded, unilaterally bulbectomized, and sham-operated controls was essentially normal. Testosterone injections restored normal sexual behavior in castrated controls but had no effect on the bilaterally bulbectomized animals."
https://openalex.org/W1990845383,"The liquid-liquid partition chromatographic system reported here involves a long helix of narrow-bore tubing. When the coiled tube is filled with one phase of a two-phase system and fed with the other phase, phase-interchange takes place in each turn of the coil, leaving a segment of the former phase as the stationary phase. Consequently, solutes present in either phase are subjected to a multistep partition process. The column efficiency, estimated on a separation of dinitrophenyl amino acids, is comparable to that of gas chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W2052949624,"Injections of sulfate ion in rats given the carcinogen N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene increased (i) the formation of 1-and 3-(methion-S-yl)-2-acetylaminofluorene bound to protein in the liver, (ii) the formation of fluorenyl derivatives bound to total protein, ribosomal RNA, and DNA in the liver, and (iii) the toxicity of the carcinogen. These data provide evidence that the highly reactive ester 2-acetylaminofluorene-N-sulfate, previously suggested as an ultimate reactive and carcinogenic metabolite of N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene, is formed in the rat liver in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1997676827,"Widely metastasizing mammary adenocarcinomas were isolated from methylcholanthrene-fed inbred young adult female W/Fu rats that had been splenectomized or thymectomized, and from those that had been both splenectomized and thymectomized. These tumors are transplantable and maintain their metastasizing capacity. They are either nonimmunogenic or less immunogenic than the nonmetastasizing conventional methylcholathrene-induced mammary tumors, which are highly immunogenic."
https://openalex.org/W2042673394,"The alfalfa leaf-cutter bee, Megachile rotundata, stops abdominal contractions briefly during oviposition of female eggs but not during oviposition of male eggs. Sperm stored in the spermatheca probably is pumped onto the micropyle of the egg during this pause. The stimulus inducing fertilization seems to be associated with the depth of the nesting tunnel."
https://openalex.org/W2040131932,"During infection by influenza virus, viral proteins become firmly attached to (or part of) host cell plasma membrane, nuclear membranes, mitochondrial, and microsomal membranes. Purified virus particles contain less than I percent host cell protein. Virus envelope proteins completely replace host membrane proteins in those discrete spots on the plasma membrane from which progeny virions bud out."
https://openalex.org/W2092549812,"A basic thermodynamic cycle for the production of mechanical power from materials that may be made to contract forcibly and reversibly is described. The cycle differs from existing mechanical power cycles which generally employ expanding fluid as working substances. A ""contraction turbine"" operating on this cycle has been devised, which has collagen fiber as its working substance and salt solution as fuel and produces mechanical work directly from chemical free energy. Direct conversion of chemical to mechanical energy is routinely effected in muscle but not in usual man-made engines."
https://openalex.org/W1989056897,"The kinetic properties of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isozymes have been determined at high enzyme concentrations. Spectrophotofluorometric assays revealed that the extent of substrate inhibition of LDH-1 and LDH-5 depends on enzyme concentration. At high enzyme concentrations, in the range of those that exist in most mammalian cells, no inhibition by pyruvate occurred. Pyruvate concentrations up to and including 20.0 millimoles per liter were used for each isozyme at 25° and 40°C at pH 7.0 and 7.4. These results suggest that substrate inhibition of LDH may not occur in vivo but only in vitro after appreciable dilution from physiologic enzyme concentrations. These experiments provide further evidence against the theory that substrate inhibition of LDH-1 in vivo accounts for the distribution of LDH isozymes within various tissues. They raise the possibility that, for other enzymes, kinetic properties determined at highly dilute concentrations in vitro may also be quite different from kinetic properties at the much higher concentrations that exist in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2080433843,"Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid administered intraperitoneally inhibits (i) the formation of skin tumors induced by a single topical application of 9,10-dimethylbenzanthracene followed by weekly applications of croton oil and (ii) the formation of skin tumors induced by a single large application of 9,10-dimethylbenzanthracene."
https://openalex.org/W1982752062,"Nerves of intracranial arteries of the cat were restricted to adventitia, with neuromuscular contacts observed only at the border of adventitia and media. Axons of such neuromuscular contacts possessed at least two different populations of synaptic vesicles. One axonal type contained many small (500 angstroms in diameter) granular vesicles and occasional agranular vesicles. The other contained only agranular vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W2021065207,"The interval between mitosis and initiation of DNA synthesis (G(1)) varied over a fourfold range for Chinese hamster ovary cells, an established line. This was not because of size differences. Synchlronous cells of different sizes began DNA synthesis at similar times after mitosis. A novel technique of centrifugation for separating cells according to size is described."
https://openalex.org/W2024631879,"A microelectrode survey of the cat lateral geniculate has uncovered an infrequent new type of lateral geniculate cell in layer B with ""on"" center responses to short wavelengths and ""off"" center responses to long wavelengths. The short wavelength responses are mediated by cones with peak sensitivity at about 450 nanometers, and the long wavelength responses by cones with peak sensitivity at 556 nanometers. Two of double opponent color cells also had double opponent features."
https://openalex.org/W2032865721,The ratios of concentrations of diacyl glyceryl ethers to triglycerides are increased significantly in the livers of weighted dogfish (Squalus acanthias) in comparison to an unweighted control group. The hydrostatic properties of the liver may be regulated through the metabolism of these two classes of lipids which have different specific gravities.

Photolytic generation of free radicals that may abstract hydrogen from solvent, react with oxygen, or abstract hydrogen from unreacted substrate occurs. Further decomposition of short-lived intermediates yields many compounds. Oxidation products include benzoic acids, aromatic ketones, and chlorinated phenols. The DDE also undergoes photocyclization to give dichlorofluorene derivatives."

https://openalex.org/W1992297782,Regenerating epithelial tissue from the cockroach leg forms two cuticular coverings. The first of these consists of a protein-carbohydrate complex that is replaced before molting. The second covering represents the cuticle containing chitin. The deposition of the cuticle can be induced in vitro by adding ecdysterone to the culture medium.
https://openalex.org/W2077231605,An absorption peak for the peptide bond at 187 nanometers has been confirmed; a protein assay at this wavelength allows quantitation of proteins in aqueous solution at concentrations between 0.1 and 25 micrograms per milliliter. Assays are conducted at 6°C to take advantage of the reduction of end-absorption of water with temperature.
https://openalex.org/W1969797078,"The resting potential of a molluscan neuron can be separated experimentally into two components: one which depends on ionic gradients and permeabilities in accordance with the Goldman equation, and a second which depends on the electrogenicity of active sodium transport."

https://openalex.org/W2030034468,The prognosis for the development of new chemical contraceptives is discussed with emphasis on the inherent restrictions placed on scientific research by modern advanced societies. Despite the greatly increased awareness and concern about the population problem and the great number of research projects now aimed at developing new contraceptive techniques the outlook for the development of new chemical contraceptives is not bright. The scientific complexity of steroid compounds and the types of testing required to develop clinically effective preparations demand that such research be conducted in the most highly developed countries where the pressure of the population problem is the least. In the United States the Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) regulations requiring years of testing and strict guarantees of drug safety require well over a decade for a drug to progress from discovery to marketing and the standards for chemical contraceptives are much more strict than for most other drugs. The FDA though a political rather than a scientific organization has wide-ranging international influence since FDA approval is almost essential for world-wide acceptance of a contraceptive compound even though the FDAs principles for testing and approval are not necessarily the same as those of the developing countries. The result is that while the developing countries populations double every 20 years the hope for a new ideal chemical contraceptive rests with a government agency not directly threatened by the population problem or aware of its imperatives which establishes testing standards that make the development of such a drug logistically improbable. The population problem will only begin to be solved when enough people become aware of its dramatic importance and one step to aid new contraceptive development would be to put supervisory scientific control in the hands of the United Nations agencies.

Carbon monoxide and phycocyanobilin were produced in stoichiometric amounts at comparable rates. Therefore, the mechanism of bile pigment formation in this plant parallels that in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1998058404,"Albino rats increased their intake of water soon after they were given a load of 0.12 molar lithium chloride in the stomach. Alterations in blood volume and tonicity could not account for the magnitude of the thirst observed, which served to facilitate the renal excretion of the toxic lithium ions."
https://openalex.org/W2026491995,"Experimentally altered ability of transferred spleen cells to generate hemolytic plaque-forming cells provided evidence that antigens compete for a type of multipotential cell that contributes to the formation of immunologically competent units. De'ay of exposure of transferred spleen cells to antigen provided results which suggest that different types of cells interact to form competent, antigen-reactive units even in the absence of antigen."
https://openalex.org/W2087688178,"Cell suspensions obtained from hyperplastic nodules induced in rat liver by either of the two hepatic carcinogens, 2-fluorenylacetamide or aflatoxin B 1 , show growth when cultured in vitro. No growth of cells from liver adjacent to the hyperplastic nodules or from liver of control rats has been obtained so far under comparable conditions. Hepatocarcinoma cells induced by 2-fluorenylacetamide grow readily in vitro but behave differently. These findings suggest that some nonmalignant cells capable of growth in vitro arise during liver carcinogenesis prior to the appearance of unequivocal cancer. Cultures of such cells may offer new avenues for the study of liver carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2032441688,"Yeast L-asparaginase is a multimeric enzyme for which only a single structural gene has been found. Fourteen mutants deficient in L-asparaginase have been isolated, and they have been located at one site on the genetic map of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The L-asparaginase gene (aspl) is located about 18 centimorgans from a gene governing tryptophan synthesis (trp4) on fragment 2 of the map."
https://openalex.org/W2046889010,"Zymograms reveal a multiplicity of esterase isozymes in rabbit serum. Most of the staining activity is concentrated in a region of the gels just anodal to the albumins where six phenotypes (A, AF, F, M, P, and S) are distinguished. The atropinesterase activity is associated with phenotypes A and AF and appears to be restricted to a single isozyme, zone A. Cocainesterase activity is limited to isozyme S, a zone common to all phenotypes except M."
https://openalex.org/W2068268264,"Energy minimization techniques applied to an arbitrary peptide primary sequence result in a still large number of hypothetical structures of similar energy. Optical activity calculations can, in principle, be used to screen the low-energy conformations. Those conformations which yield a spectrum different from the observed spectrum by a factor greater than the current reliability of the calculation can be excluded. The method is applied to gramicidin S."
https://openalex.org/W2075759591,"We have developed a simple novel column technique for the removal of sodium-24 and potassium-42 based on a heterogeneous isotopic exchange reaction between an organic eluting solution (acetone-hydrochloric acid) and fine crystals of sodium chloride or potassium chloride or their analogs. The technique is fast, efficient, and highly selective; it has been successfully applied to irradiated human tissues prior to gamma-ray spectrometry with lithium-drifted germanium detectors."

https://openalex.org/W2050996848,"Antibodies secreted by individual immune cells were collected focally in very thin ""original"" and ""imprint"" layers of agar containing the target antigen, sheep erythrocytes. Identical treatment of both layers led to mirror image patterns of hemolytic plaques. Development of one layer for immunoglobulin M hemolysins and the other for immunoglobulin G hemolysins produced unrelated plaque patterns indicating that few, if any, cells simultaneously release substantial amounts of both gammaM and gammaG antibodies."

https://openalex.org/W1980910067,"A pair of coronary arteries supplies the interventricular septum of the heart of Mus musculus. The members of this pair tend to be of unequal size, which permits distiniction between specimens displaying left asymmetry and those showing righit asymmetry. Three inbred strains (C57BL/1O, DBA/1, and Bulb/c) differ with regard to this asymmetry. However, variation exists within strains, which suggests that nongenetic factors also influence the development of the asymmetry. Right arterial asymmetry is dominant over left asymmetry."

https://openalex.org/W2030526876,"Critical flicker-fusion thresholds were measured with both solid disks and annular stimuli. The former subtended 1, 4, and 8 degrees of visual angle, and the latter subtended 4 and 8 degrees. The illuminated region of the 4-degree annulus provided the same area of stimulation as that of the 1-degree disk. The illuminated region of the 8-degree annulus provided the same area of stimulation as the 4-degree disk. Annular stimuli significantly reduced critical flicker-fusion thresholds relative to those obtained with disk stimuli of the same area. The effects are not explicable in terms of heterogeneous retinal sensitivity. Laws relating critical flicker-fusion to area seem to be valid only under the restricted condition of homogeneous stimulation."
