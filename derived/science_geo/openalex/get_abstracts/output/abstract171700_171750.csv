Recently we reported the isolation and characterization of COMPASS, a multiprotein complex that includes the Trx-related protein Set1 of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we report that COMPASS catalyzes methylation of the fourth lysine of histone H3in vitro. Set1 and several other components of COMPASS are also required for histone H3 methylation in vivo and for transcriptional silencing of a gene located near a chromosome telomere.

Alteration of chromatin by covalent modification of histone proteins is central to the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic organisms (1.Workman J.L. Kingstone R.E. Annu. Rev.

Acetylation of histones H3 and H4 are the best characterized covalent modifications of histones and have wide ranging effects on gene expression (1.Workman J.L. Kingstone R.E. Annu. Rev.

Histone phosphorylation is important for transcriptional activation, condensation of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis, and regulation of cell division (5.de la Barre A.E. Gerson V. Gout S. Creaven M. Allis C.D. Dimitrov S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 6.Hans F. Dimitrov S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Recently, Lys4 and Lys9 of histone H3 and Arg3 of histone H4 were found to be methylated (7.Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R.

An enzyme that catalyzes the methylation of Lys9 of histone H3 was identified in mammals (human SUV39H1 and mouse Suv39 h1) and found to be the homologue of Drosophila Su(var)3–9, involved in silencing of heterochromatic gene expression, and of Schizosaccharomyces pombe clr4, which is involved in silencing of expression of the mating-type locus and genes near centromeres (9.Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z. Manfred S. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar, 10.Thon G.

The catalytic domain of Su(var)39 is thought to be its SET domain, which takes its name from the Drosophila proteinsS u(var)3–9,E nhancer of zeste (E(z)), and trithorax (trx) (13.Jones R.S. Gelbart W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6357-6366Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 14.Tschiersh B. Hofmann A. Krauss V. Dorn R. Korge G. Reuter G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3822-3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). We recently identified COMPASS, a multiprotein complex that contains the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SET domain-containing protein Set1 and another yeast protein related to the human Trx protein ASH2 (15.Miller T. Krogan N.J. Dover J. Bromage H. Tempst P. Johnston M. Greenblatt J.F. Shilatifard A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12902-12907Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Here we show that COMPASS catalyzes methylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 and is required for transcriptional silencing of genes located near chromosome telomeres. Media and reagents were purchased from Sigma. Western development reagents were purchased from ICN ImmunoBiologicals (Irvine, CA). S-Adenosylmethionine was purchased from Fisher. The role of the CPSgenes (encoding proteins that comprise COMPASS) in telomere-associated silencing of gene expression was determined by disrupting them in the strain UCC1001 (MATa ura-52 his3D200 ade2–101 lys2–801 trp1-D1 leu2-D1 TELVII adh4::URA3), which carries the URA3 gene near the left telomere of chromosome 7. Each CPS gene was replaced by the KanMX gene (16.Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2231) Google Scholar) by transforming yeast to G418 resistance with a PCR product of cps::KanMX (amplified from the S. cerevisiae yeast gene knockout collection (17.Winzeler E.A.

Giaever G. Hegemann J.H. Jones T. Laub M. Liao H. Davis R.W. et al.Science. 1999; 285: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3167) Google Scholar) that includes 45 nucleotides of DNA sequence flanking each side of the cps::KanMx gene disrupted (to provide for homologous recombination with the target CPS gene)). Each cps::KanMX mutant was confirmed by a PCR test using, as primers, one oligonucleotide within KanMX and one oligonucleotide flanking the disrupted CPS gene. Yeast cells were grown in YPD overnight to mid-log phase. Cells were washed with distilled water, pelleted, and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris at pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and fresh protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm microcystin-LR, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were then disrupted by vortexing with glass beads (0.5 mm; Biospec Products) for 15 min at 4 °C. The bottoms of the microcentrifuge tubes were punctured, and cell extracts were recovered into a larger tube by brief centrifugation in a microcentrifuge. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 30 min, subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with anti-methylhistone antisera (United States Biochemical, Inc., catalog number 07-030) at 1:1000 dilution, followed by detection of the bound antibody with horseradish peroxidase conjugated to anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (1:10,000 dilution). We tested for the presence of methylated histones H3 and H4 by employing antibodies specific for methylated Lys9 of histone H3, Lys4 of histone H3, and Arg3 of histone H4. Probing yeast extracts separated by SDS-PAGE with antiserum specific to these modifications reveals that only Lys4 of histone H3 is methylated in S. cerevisiae (Fig. 1A). The protein indicated is indeed [methyl-Lys4]H3, because histone H3 purified from cells via 6 histidine residues placed at its C terminus is recognized by this antisera and exhibits approximately the same mobility in SDS-PAGE as the protein inferred to be [methyl-Lys4]histone H3 (Fig. 1C). We observed methylation of histone H3 Lys4 and histone H4 Arg3 in extracts obtained from both mammalian and Drosophila cells (data not shown), suggesting that these modifications are specific to larger eukaryotic organisms or present in S. cerevisiae at very low abundance. Allis and co-workers also observed this recently and suggested that high levels of H3 Lys4 methylation may reflect a fundamental difference between single-celled and multicellular organisms in the “ground state” of their chromatin (18.Briggs S.D. Bryk M. Strahl B.D. Cheung W.L. Davie J.K. Dent S.Y. Winston F. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Recently the SET domains of the Su(var)3–9 family of proteins of Drosophila and mammalian G9a protein were shown to catalyze the methylation of the Lys9 of histone H3 in vitro (9.Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z. Manfred S. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar, 19.Tachibana M. Sugimoto K. Fukushima T. Shinkai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25309-25317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether the Set1 protein is required for methylation of histone H3 Lys4 in vivo. Indeed, this modification is absent in cells missing the Set1 subunit of COMPASS (Fig. 1, B and C). Removal of SET2(Fig. 1B) or the genes encoding other SET domain-containing proteins (data not shown) did eliminate histone H3 methylation. Although we did not detect in vitro histone methyltransferase activity of COMPASS purified via the TAP 1The abbreviations used are: TAPtandem affinity purificationHMThistone methyltransferase5-FOA5-fluoro-orotic acid epitope (15.Miller T. Krogan N.J. Dover J. Bromage H. Tempst P. Johnston M. Greenblatt J.F. Shilatifard A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12902-12907Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) placed on Set1, COMPASS purified using epitope-tagged Cps60 possesses H3 Lys4 HMT activity in vitro (Fig. 1D). To determine whether tagging SET1 on its C-terminal domain alters its catalytic activity, we tested yeast cell extracts from wild-type, SET1-TAP, and CPS60-TAP. Set1 tagged on its C-terminal domain is crippled and loses about 50–70% of its activity in methylating Lys4 of histone H3 in vivo (Fig. 1E). tandem affinity purification histone methyltransferase 5-fluoro-orotic acid The eight subunits of purified COMPASS analyzed by SDS-PAGE are shown in Fig. 2A. We tested six nonessential subunits of COMPASS for a role in histone H3 Lys4methylation by assaying for this modification in yeast strains missing the various CPS genes. SET1, CPS50, and CPS30 appear to be required for H3 Lys4methylation; cps60 and cps25 mutants have detectable, but apparently reduced, methylation activity (Fig. 2). Cps40 is not required for this histone modification. It has been shown that Set1 is required for full silencing of expression of a gene located near chromosome telomeres or in the rDNA repeat (18.Briggs S.D. Bryk M. Strahl B.D. Cheung W.L. Davie J.K. Dent S.Y. Winston F. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 20.Nislow C. Ray E. Pillus L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2421-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In our previous study we tested cps mutants for telomere-associated gene silencing by observing the ability of a URA3 gene located near the left telomere of chromosome 7 to confer a Ura+phenotype. However, we have come to believe that this test is not an entirely accurate assay for telomeric silencing. Therefore, we sought to confirm our previous results by testing the ability of the telomere-associated URA3 gene to confer sensitivity to 5-fluoro-orotic acid (5-FOA), as described previously (20.Nislow C. Ray E. Pillus L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2421-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In agreement with our previous results, SET1, CPS50, CPS30, and CPS25 all appear to be required for normal silencing of this gene. In contrast to our previous results, cps40 and cps60 (bre2) mutants appear to retain some ability to silence the telomere-associated URA3 gene. Telomeric gene silencing correlated with the methylation activity of COMPASS; the three cps mutants with some methylation activity (cps25, cps40, and cps60) appear to retain at least some gene silencing ability and cps mutants lacking H3 Lys4 methylation appear not to silence the expression of URA3 located near a telomere. The Set1 protein of yeast is similar to the Drosophila and human trithorax proteins (Trithorax (Trx) and MLL, respectively) (21.Mahmoudi T. Verrijzer C.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3055-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 22.Stassen M.J. Bailey D. Nelson S. Chinwalla V. Harte P.J. Mech. Dev. 1995; 52: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 23.Jenuwein T. Laible G. Dorn R. Reuter G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 80-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 24.Rowley J.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 495-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Our understanding of the role of this class of proteins in regulation of gene expression and development is rudimentary. Trx is a putative DNA-binding protein that seems to be a positive regulator of gene expression (24.Rowley J.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 495-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Mutations affecting MLL result in the development of hematological malignancies (24.Rowley J.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 495-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Our characterization of the Set1-containing protein complex we call COMPASS is a first step toward understanding the function of SET domain-containing proteins. We and others (15.Miller T. Krogan N.J. Dover J. Bromage H. Tempst P. Johnston M. Greenblatt J.F. Shilatifard A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12902-12907Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 18.Briggs S.D.

Pijnappel W.W. Aasland R. Stewart A.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7137-7148Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) have now provided evidence that COMPASS is a histone methyltransferase that catalyzes methylation of Lys4 of histone H3. Set1 is the COMPASS subunit likely responsible for its catalytic activity. It appears that tagging Set1 on its C-terminal domain cripples its methyltransferase activity both in vivo and in vitro (Fig. 1E). Although it was recently demonstrated that the Set domain of mammalian Trx (MLL) lacks histone methyltransferase activity in vitro (9.Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z. Manfred S. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar), it is possible the recombinant protein used in that study is defective due to the lack of interacting proteins. Some of the other COMPASS subunits that are required for its methyltransferase activity in vivo may play a role in either substrate recognition or proper folding of the Set domain. It has been reported that the Trx-related Ash1 protein is a methyltransferase specific for H3 lysines 9 and 27 (25). The observation that Cps60, which is similar to Ash2, is important for the methyltransferase activity of COMPASS suggests a common role for the Trx group of proteins as histone methyltransferases. Since the methylation activity of COMPASS seems to be roughly correlated with silencing of telomeric gene expression (Fig. 3), methylation of the Lys4of histone H3 is implicated in the establishment and/or maintenance of telomeric gene silencing. Recently, a few key pieces of evidence suggest that modification of histone H3 at its fourth lysine residue facilitates transcriptional activation (26.Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7572) Google Scholar). First, methylation of Lys4 of histone H3 is preferentially associated with regions of chromosomes that are transcriptionally active or seem poised for transcription (27.Litt M.D. Simpson M. Gaszner M. Allis C.D. Felsenfeld G. Science. 2001; 293: 2453-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 28.Noma K.I. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. Science. 2001; 293: 1150-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Second, Set1 protein has been linked to expression of several genes in S. cerevisiae involved in transcriptional regulation, meiosis, DNA repair, and cell cycle (15.Miller T. Krogan N.J. Dover J. Bromage H. Tempst P. Johnston M. Greenblatt J.F. Shilatifard A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12902-12907Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 20.Nislow C. Ray E. Pillus L. Mol.

Genet. 1999; 21: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In contrast, COMPASS seems required for silencing of gene expression at telomeres. In addition to our results and those of Pillus and co-workers supporting this idea (15.Miller T. Krogan N.J. Dover J. Bromage H. Tempst P. Johnston M. Greenblatt J.F. Shilatifard A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12902-12907Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 20.Nislow C. Ray E. Pillus L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2421-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), Allis and colleagues have recently demonstrated that [methyl-Lys4]histone H3 is present at the rDNA locus and that this modification is required for silencing of RNA polymerase II transcription of a gene situated within the rDNA (18.Briggs S.D. Bryk M. Strahl B.D. Cheung W.L. Davie J.K. Dent S.Y. Winston F. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The apparent dual nature of methylation of histone H3 in repression and activation may be explained, at least in part, by the different roles played by this modification in yeast and multicellular eukaryotes. The different roles of this histone modification emphasize the importance of the “histone code” (26.Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7572) Google Scholar) in chromatin structure and regulation of gene expression."

But although this mimicry is obvious to the human observer, it has never been examined with respect to different visual systems. Here we show that when female crab-spiders mimic different flower species, they are simultaneously cryptic in the colour-vision systems of both bird predators and hymenopteran prey."

We investigated the initial steps of NO-mediated apoptosis in mouse macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells. When cells were treated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus interferon-γ (IFN-γ), NO-mediated apoptosis occurred. Under these conditions, p53 accumulation was not observed, indicating that DNA damage is not the main trigger of NO-mediated apoptosis. On the other hand, mRNA and protein for CHOP, a transcription factor known to be induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, were induced. The CHOP induction by LPS/IFN-γ treatment preceded cytochrome c release from mitochondria. In addition, p90ATF6, an ER membrane-bound transcription factor involved in ER stress response, was cleaved to its active soluble form p50ATF6, which was transported to nucleus and bound to the ER stress response element of the CHOP gene. In the luciferase reporter assay, both the CHOP-binding element of the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat and ER stress response element of the CHOP gene were activated by LPS/IFN-γ treatment. When RAW 264.7 cells or COS-7 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for CHOP, p90ATF6, or p50ATF6, cell death was observed. In addition, apoptosis induced by p50ATF6 was prevented by a CHOP dominant negative form as well as by an ATF6 dominant negative form, and LPS/IFN-γ-induced apoptosis was prevented by the CHOP dominant negative form.

Nitric oxide (NO) is a multifunctional biomolecule involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes (1.Ignarro L.J. Nitric Oxide: Biology and Pathology. Academic Press, London2000Google Scholar). In pathological conditions, NO functions as a bactericidal or tumoricidal agent. However, excess NO production has been implicated in diseases such as septic shock, autoimmune disease, cerebral infarction, and diabetes mellitus, in which NO-mediated apoptosis is often observed (2.Dimmeler S. Zeiher A.M. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar,3.Kröncke K.D. Fehsel K. Kolb-Bachofen V. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 107-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). NO has several cytotoxic effects, including reactions with proteins and nucleic acids, and causes apoptosis. NO-induced apoptosis is generally considered to be mediated by DNA damage or mitochondrial damage (4.Brüne B. von Knethen A. Sandau K.B. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 351: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar); however, the cascade of the cell death has not been fully clarified.

ATF6 exists constitutively as a transmembrane protein p90ATF6 in the ER under non-stressed conditions (14.Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol.

ER stress induces proteolysis of p90ATF6 and releases a soluble transcription factor p50ATF6, which is transported into the nucleus, binds to the ER stress responsive element (ERSE) of the CHOP gene, and activates its transcription (13.Yoshida H.

Mouse macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were prepared and grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum as described (21.Salimuddin Nagasaki A. Gotoh T. Isobe H. Mori M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E110-E117PubMed Google Scholar). CHOP knockout mice were described (22.Oyadomari S. Takeda K. Takiguchi M. Gotoh T. Matsumoto M. Wada I. Akira S. Araki E. Mori M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10845-10850Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Transfection of RAW 264.7 cells and COS-7 cells with plasmids was carried out using TransIT-LT1 polyamine (PanVera Corp., Madison, WI) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. In each experiment, the same total amounts of plasmids were transfected by adding insert-less expression plasmids. Cells were treated with Escherichia coli LPS (serotype 0127:B8, Sigma) plus mouse IFN-γ, a NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine (SNAP), a sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) inhibitor thapsigargin, or a topoisomerase inhibitor camptothecin for the indicated periods. A NO scavenger carboxy-PTIO (2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4, 4, 5, 5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide) was added to the medium concomitantly with the addition of LPS/IFN-γ. RAW 264.7 cells or COS-7 cells were treated as described above. To analyze morphological changes of nuclei, the cells were fixed, stained with Hoechst dye 33258 (8 μg/ml) for 5 min, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The stained cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope. To analyze mitochondrial depolarization, peritoneal macrophages were stained with a mitochondrial membrane potential-dependent dye DePsipher (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD). RNA blot analysis was performed as reported (23.Gotoh T. Mori M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed using digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA as a probe for mouse CHOP or rat GAPDH. The antisense RNA was synthesized using as a template pT7Blue-mCHOP or pcDNAII-GAPDH digested with an appropriate restriction enzyme. Chemiluminescence signals derived from the hybridized probe were detected using a chemiluminescence image analyzer Las-1000 Plus (Fuji Photo Film Co, Tokyo, Japan). Immunoblot analysis was performed as described (23.Gotoh T. Mori M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from RAW 264.7 cells were prepared as described (24.Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Immunodetection was performed using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Filters were analyzed using Las-1000 Plus. Nuclear extracts of RAW 264.7 cells were prepared as described above. The sequence of double-stranded oligonucleotide used for the ERSE of the CHOP gene is as follows: 5′-CCTACCAATCAGAAAGTGGCACGC-3′, 3′-GGATGGTTAGTCTTTCACCGTGCG-5′. This probe was 3′ end-labeled with digoxigenin-11-ddUTP and terminal transferase using a DIG gel shift kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The binding reaction was carried out for 30 min on ice as described (25.Gotoh T. Haraguchi Y. Takiguchi M. Mori M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 778-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Non-labeled oligonucleotides (1 pmol) of the ERSE site or the p53 consensus site were used as competitors. The sequence of double-stranded oligonucleotide used for the p53 consensus site (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) is as follows: 5′-TACAGAACATGTCTAAGCATGCTGGGGACT-3′, 3′-ATGTCTTGTACAGATTCGTACGACCCCTGA-5′. Electrophoresis was done as described (25.Gotoh T. Haraguchi Y. Takiguchi M. Mori M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 778-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the oligonucleotide probe was transferred to nylon membranes. Chemiluminescent signals derived from the probe were detected using a DIG luminescence detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and Las-1000 Plus. Transfection was carried out with a total of 15 μg of DNA mixture containing 10 μg of a luciferase reporter plasmid and 5 μg of an internal standard plasmid pAc-lacZ (26.Miyazaki J. Takaki S. Araki K. Tashiro F. Tominaga A. Takatsu K. Yamamura K. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 79: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) bearing the E. coli β-galactosidase gene. Cells were cultured with or without LPS plus IFN-γ or thapsigargin for 10 h prior to harvesting. 34 h after transfection, luciferase activity of cell extracts was measured using Luciferase Assay Systems (Promega Corp.) and then normalized for β-galactosidase activity. When mouse macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells were treated with LPS/IFN-γ, a NO-donor SNAP, an ER stress-inducing reagent thapsigargin, or a DNA-damaging reagent camptothecin for 12 h, morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis were observed (Fig. 1A). Round-shaped cells and apoptotic bodies were observed in phase-contrast images, and chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation were seen in Hoechst dye 33258 staining. We showed previously that apoptosis induced by LPS/IFN-γ treatment is mediated by NO (23.Gotoh T. Mori M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, the pathway of NO-mediated apoptosis is not fully understood. We asked whether p53 is involved in NO-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 1B). In general, p53 increases in response to DNA damage. In fact, when cells were treated with camptothecin, p53 protein increased. In contrast, treatment with LPS/IFN-γ, SNAP, or thapsigargin did not increase p53. CHOP is a transcription factor that is involved in ER stress-induced apoptosis. We found that CHOP mRNA, which was undetectable in untreated RAW 264.7 cells, was induced when cells were treated with LPS/IFN-γ or SNAP (Fig. 2A). The mRNA was induced by thapsigargin but not by camptothecin. Fig. 2B shows immunoblot analysis of nuclear extracts for CHOP. CHOP, which was barely detectable before LPS/IFN-γ treatment, was induced after treatment. The level of LPS/IFN-γ-induced CHOP was close to that obtained with thapsigargin. This induction was prevented by a NO scavenger carboxy-PTIO, indicating that the induction is mediated by NO. CHOP was induced slightly 2 h after LPS/IFN-γ treatment, increased markedly at 4 h, and increased up to 10 h (Fig. 2, C and D). Bip/GRP78, an ER chaperone that is known to be induced by ER stress (7.Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar), was induced by LPS/IFN-γ as well as by thapsigargin (Fig. 2E), indicating that LPS/IFN-γ produces ER stress. Camptothecin did not induce Bip. We have shown previously that cytochrome c release from mitochondria takes place in LPS/IFN-γ-induced apoptosis of RAW 264.7 cells (27.Gotoh T. Terada K. Mori M. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fig. 2F shows the time course of cytochrome c release in RAW 264.7 cells treated with LPS/IFN-γ. Cells were fractionated with digitonin into a soluble fraction and a particulate fraction that includes mitochondria, and these fractions were subjected to immunoblot analysis for cytochrome c. Cytochrome c release was not seen up to 6 h after LPS/IFN-γ treatment but was observed at 10 h. At this time, about 70% of cytochrome c was recovered in the soluble fraction. Under these conditions, a mitochondrial matrix protein, hsp60, was recovered exclusively in the particulate fraction, whereas a cytosolic protein, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, was recovered almost exclusively in the soluble fraction. Therefore, we conclude that CHOP is induced prior to cytochrome c release in LPS/IFN-γ-induced apoptosis in RAW 264.7 cells. Yoshida et al. (13.Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar) found that p50ATF6 binds to ERSE of the CHOP gene and transactivates the gene. Therefore, we asked whether ATF6 is activated in LPS/IFN-γ-treated RAW 264.7 cells. Fig. 3A shows the time course of ATF6 activation and CHOP induction. In control cells, p90ATF6, which is the ER transmembrane form of ATF6, was detected, but p50ATF6, which is the processed and active form, was not detected. p90ATF6 was decreased with time after LPS/IFN-γ treatment, whereas p50ATF6 appeared and increased with time, indicating that p90ATF6 was processed to p50ATF6. CHOP was induced concomitantly with the processing of ATF6. Processed p50ATF6 appeared in the nuclei 2 h after LPS/IFN-γ treatment and increased with time up to 10 h (Fig. 3, B and C). The level at 10 h was about half of that produced in response to thapsigargin. Binding activity to ERSE of the CHOP gene was also monitored (Fig. 3D). When cells were treated with thapsigargin for 6 h, two binding complexes (complexes I and II) were detected. Treatment with LPS/IFN-γ also produced two complexes. An antibody specific to ATF6 diminished complex II, whereas control serum caused no change. Therefore, we conclude that p50ATF6 is involved in complex II. This agrees well with the results obtained with purified p50ATF6 and NF-Y, another transcription factor involved in the complex (13.Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). In that report, it was shown that p50ATF6 and NF-Y were involved in complex II and only NF-Y was involved in complex I. Complex II was not detected in control nuclear extract, began to increase 2 h after LPS/IFN-γ treatment, and increased up to 10 h. These results indicate that LPS/IFN-γ treatment processed to activate ATF6 and that the active form of ATF6 (p50ATF6) binds to ERSE of the CHOP gene. To confirm that LPS/IFN-γ treatment induces CHOP through stimulation of ERSE, we made reporter constructs where ERSE of the CHOP gene or the CHOP binding site of Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat was inserted just upstream of the SV40 promoter that drives the luciferase gene. RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with the reporter constructs and treated with LPS/IFN-γ or thapsigargin for 10 h, and then cell extracts were assayed for luciferase activity (Fig. 4). Luciferase activity derived from the SV40 promoter was little affected by treatment with LPS/IFN-γ or thapsigargin. When ERSE of the CHOP gene was inserted, luciferase activity was enhanced 2.2-fold by LPS/IFN-γ treatment and 3.4-fold by thapsigargin treatment. When the CHOP binding site was inserted, luciferase activity was enhanced 3.2-fold by LPS/IFN-γ treatment and 5.9-fold by thapsigargin treatment. We therefore conclude that activated ATF6 enhances transcription of the CHOP gene through ERSE in vivo in LPS/IFN-γ-treated RAW 264.7 cells. CHOP was reported to induce apoptosis in M1 myeloblastic leukemia cells (10.Matsumoto M. Minami M. Takeda K. Sakao Y. Akira S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (6.Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar). We asked whether CHOP and ATF6 can induce apoptosis in RAW 264.7 cells. Cells were cotransfected with an EGFP expression plasmid and an expression plasmid for CHOP, p50ATF6, or p90ATF6. When cells were transfected with only the EGFP plasmid, many cells became fluorescent (Fig. 5A). Cotransfection with the CHOP plasmid markedly reduced EGFP-positive cells. When the p50ATF6 plasmid was cotransfected, the number of EGFP-positive cells was even more markedly reduced. In the case of the p90ATF6 plasmid, the number of EGFP-positive cells was moderately reduced. It was shown that overexpression of p90ATF6 leads to partial processing of p90ATF6, resulting in the production of small amounts of p50ATF6 (14.Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 6E). These results indicate that ATF6 as well as CHOP induces the death of RAW 264.7 cells. Fig. 5B shows the effect of dominant negative forms of ATF6 and CHOP on ATF6- and CHOP-induced apoptosis in RAW 264.7 cells. Reduction of EGFP-positive cells by transfection with the p50ATF6 plasmid was markedly prevented by cotransfection with a plasmid for its dominant negative form, and more importantly, by cotransfection with a CHOP dominant negative plasmid. This indicates that p50ATF6-induced apoptosis in RAW 264.7 cells is mediated by CHOP. CHOP-induced apoptosis was prevented by cotransfection with the CHOP dominant negative plasmid.Figure 6Apoptosis in COS-7 cells transfected with CHOP, p50ATF6, and p90ATF6. Cells were cotransfected with an EGFP expression plasmid and an expression plasmid for CHOP, p50ATF6, or p90ATF6 (A). After 24 h, cells were observed by fluorescence microscopy. EGFP fluorescence images and phase-contrast images of the same fields are shown. Original magnifications: ×200. Bars, 50 μm. COS-7 cells were treated as in panel A, and cell extracts (20 μg of protein) were subjected to immunoblot analysis for GFP and GAPDH (B). Immunoblots from two dishes for each condition are shown. The results in panel B were quantified and are shown by means + ranges (n = 2) (C). COS-7 cells were treated as in panel A (D and E). Cell extracts (50 μg of protein) were subjected to immunoblot analysis for CHOP (D) and ATF6 (E). Cells were cotransfected with an EGFP expression plasmid and an expression plasmid for CHOP or p50ATF6 (F). After incubation for indicated times, cell extracts (20 μg of protein) were subjected to immunoblot analysis for GFP and GAPDH.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then asked whether NO-mediated apoptosis in RAW 264.7 cells can be prevented by expression of the CHOP dominant negative form (Fig. 5C). The number of EGFP-positive cells was decreased markedly by LPS/IFN-γ, and this decrease was effectively prevented by cotransfection with the CHOP dominant negative plasmid. The CHOP dominant negative plasmid alone had little effect on the number of EGFP-positive cells. These results indicate that LPS/IFN-γ-induced apoptosis in RAW 264.7 cells is mediated by CHOP. However, CHOP was barely detected in RAW 264.7 cells transfected with p50ATF6 or p90ATF6. Therefore, we used COS-7 cells in which higher levels of expression can be obtained. When COS-7 cells were cotransfected with the EGFP plasmid and the plasmid for CHOP, p50ATF6, or p90ATF6, the number of EGFP-positive cells was decreased, and the results were similar to those for RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 6A). Expression of EGFP was quantified by immunoblot analysis, and the results are shown in Fig. 6, B and C. CHOP protein, which was not detectable in nuclear extracts from control cells, was detected in nuclear extracts from cells transfected with the plasmid for p50ATF6 or p90ATF6 as well as for CHOP (Fig. 6D). In cells transfected with the p50ATF6 plasmid, p50ATF6 protein was detected in addition to endogenous p90ATF6 (Fig. 6E). When the p90ATF6 plasmid was transfected, processed p50ATF6 as well as unprocessed p90ATF6 was detected. Therefore, overexpression of p90ATF6 leads to a partial processing to active p50ATF6, which in turn induces CHOP and following apoptosis. Fig. 6F shows the time course of GFP expression cotransfected with the EGFP plasmid and the plasmid for CHOP or p50ATF6. At 12 h after transfection, GFP expression was detected in control cells, and GFP levels in CHOP- or p50ATF6-transfected cells were similar to that in control cells. In contrast, the GFP expression increased markedly in control cells at 24 h, whereas it increased much less markedly in CHOP-transfected cells and did not increase in p50ATF6-transfected cells. These results indicate that reduction of GFP-positive cells in CHOP- or ATF6-transfected cells is due to cell death. We next asked whether cell death induced by ATF6 or CHOP is prevented by their dominant negative forms in COS-7 cells (Fig. 7, A–C). The results were similar to those for RAW 264.7 cells. The decrease in EGFP-positive cells by p50ATF6 was partially reversed by the dominant negative forms of ATF6 and CHOP, and the decrease by CHOP was almost completely reversed by its dominant negative form. Expression of p50ATF6 and its dominant negative form (Fig. 7D) and that of CHOP and its dominant negative form (Fig. 7E) were confirmed by immunoblot analysis. We then asked whether expression of CHOP or ATF6 induces apoptosis in COS-7 cells (Fig. 8). When CHOP or p50ATF6 was coexpressed with EGFP, 68 or 79% of EGFP-positive cells showed apoptotic changes, respectively. When p90ATF6 was coexpressed, 48% of EGFP-positive cells were apoptotic, apparently due to partial processing to p50ATF6 (see Fig. 6E). We finally asked whether CHOP is involved in NO-mediated apoptosis in primary-cultured peritoneal macrophages by using CHOP knockout mice. When peritoneal macrophages from wild-type mice were treated with 1.5 mm SNAP, CHOP mRNA was induced with time (Fig. 9A). When wild-type macrophages were treated with 1.5 mm SNAP for 10 h, most cells (82%) lost mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 9, B and C). In contrast, more than half (55%) of peritoneal macrophages from CHOP knockout mice retained membrane potential after SNAP treatment. These results demonstrate that NO-induced apoptosis of peritoneal macrophages is mediated at least partly by CHOP. Excess NO production induces apoptosis in various cell types. It is generally believed that NO-induced apoptosis is mediated by the DNA damage pathway involving accumulation of p53 (4.Brüne B. von Knethen A. Sandau K.B. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 351: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). However, in this report we showed that p53 induction is not evident in NO-mediated apoptosis in RAW 264.7 macrophages. It was reported that there is a p53-independent pathway in addition to a p53-dependent one in NO-mediated apoptosis (28.Messmer U.K. Brüne B. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). From the results shown here, we conclude that the p53-independent pathway is the major one in NO-mediated apoptosis in RAW 264.7 cells. Recently, we showed that NO induces apoptosis in p53-deficient microglia (29.Kawahara K. Oyadomari S. Gotoh T. Kohsaka S. Nakayama H. Mori M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We found that CHOP is induced in NO-mediated apoptosis in RAW 264.7 cells and peritoneal macrophages. NO is known to inhibit many enzymes and ion channels (3.Kröncke K.D. Fehsel K. Kolb-Bachofen V. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 107-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). We found that NO depletes ER Ca2+ and causes ER stress in mouse β cell-derived MIN6 cells (22.Oyadomari S. Takeda K. Takiguchi M. Gotoh T. Matsumoto M. Wada I. Akira S. Araki E. Mori M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10845-10850Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). NO was reported to inhibit Ca2+-ATPase activity of SERCA2a by tyrosine nitration within the channel-like domain (30.Viner R.I. Williams T.D. Schoneich C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12408-12415Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We have therefore proposed that NO induces ER stress by disturbing ER Ca2+ homeostasis in cells (22.Oyadomari S. Takeda K. Takiguchi M. Gotoh T. Matsumoto M. Wada I. Akira S. Araki E. Mori M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10845-10850Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). CHOP induces apoptosis in some cell types (6.Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar). Embryonic fibroblasts derived from CHOP knockout mice exhibit significantly less apoptosis as compared with wild-type cells when challenged with ER stress-inducing reagents (6.Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar). CHOP was found to induce apoptosis in M1 myeloblastic leukemia cells in a p53-independent manner, and Bcl-2 delayed this process (10.Matsumoto M. Minami M. Takeda K. Sakao Y. Akira S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In the present work, we showed that CHOP-deficient peritoneal macrophages are more resistant to NO-induced apoptosis than wild-type cells. Because CHOP functions as a transcription factor, there must be a target gene(s) whose transcription is activated by CHOP and whose product(s) works in the apoptosis signal cascade. Wang et al. (11.Wang X.Z. Kuroda M. Sok J. Batchvarova N. Kimmel R. Chung P. Zinszner H. Ron D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3619-3630Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) found candidate target genes of the CHOP protein using representational difference analysis. However, these genes are distinct from known factors involved in the ER stress response and apoptosis. Recently, McCullough et al. (31.McCullough K.D. Martindale J.L. Klotz L.O. Aw T.Y. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar) reported that CHOP expression results in down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression, depletion of cellular glutathione, and exaggerated production of reactive oxygen species. The precise apoptosis cascade downstream of CHOP remains to be clarified. ATF6 is a type 2 ER membrane protein with its NH2 terminus in the cytosol (15.Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). When ER stress such as unfolded protein accumulation in ER occurs, ATF6 (p90ATF6) is cleaved to release its cytosolic domain (p50ATF6), which is a transcription factor of the basic leucine zipper family (14.Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). Recently, Ye et al. (16.Ye J. Rawson R.B. Komuro R. Chen X. Dave U.P. Prywes R.

However, it is still unknown how the ER stress signal triggers proteolysis of ATF6. At least four genes, GRP78, GRP94, CHOP, and calreticulin, have been shown to be activated by p50ATF6 (13.Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar, 17.Li M. Baumeister P. Roy B. Phan T. Foti D. Luo S. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell.

The cleavage of the transmembrane protein in response to cell signaling to liberate cytosolic fragments that enter the nucleus to control gene transcription is called regulated intramembrane proteolysis (Rip) (15.Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). In the present work, we found that the Rip type proteolysis of ATF6 takes place in the process of NO-mediated apoptosis in RAW 264.7 cells. An ERSE was identified in the CHOP gene. The consensus sequence of ERSE is CCAAT-N9-CCACG, and this cis-acting element is necessary and sufficient for the response to ER stress (32.Yoshida H. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33741-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 33.Roy B. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The sequence CCACG provides specificity for the response to ER stress. The general transcription factor NF-Y binds to CCAAT and p50ATF6 binds to CCACG, thereby accounting for the specificity of the ER stress response (13.Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). p50ATF6 was shown to bind directly to CCACG only when CCAAT exactly 9 bp upstream of CCACG is bound by NF-Y. We suggest that complex II in Fig. 3C consists of ATF6 and NF-Y, whereas complex I consists of NF-Y, as shown previously by Yoshida et al. (13.Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Fawcett et al. (34.Fawcett T.W. Martindale J.L. Guyton K.Z. Hai T. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) reported that the CHOP gene can be activated by ATF4, another basic leucine zipper-type transcription factor, via its binding to the C/EBP-ATF site present in the CHOP promoter region and distinct from the ERSE. Recently, Harding et al. (35.Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar) revealed that translation of ATF4 is selectively increased during ER stress and that this translational induction is mediated by PERK, a type 1 transmembrane protein kinase in the ER, which senses ER stress and transmits signals by phosphorylating the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2. Therefore, it is very likely that not only ATF6 but also ATF4 is activated in RAW 264.7 cells by LPS/IFN-γ and that both factors are involved in NO-induced apoptosis. Islet cells and macrophages are highly active in protein secretion, and it is tempting to speculate that “secretory” cells active in protein secretion are more sensitive to NO-mediated apoptosis than “non-secretory” cells, which are less active in protein secretion. This remains to be tested. We thank Shizuo Akira (Osaka University, Japan) for CHOP knockout mice and an expression plasmid for CHOP dominant negative form.

The fate of a substrate depends on the number of ubiquitin moieties conjugated, as well as the lysine linkage of Ub-Ub conjugation. The major function of Ub is to regulate the in vivo half-life of its substrates. Once a multi-Ub chain is attached to a substrate, it must be shielded from deubiquitylating enzymes for the 26 S proteasome to recognize it. Molecular mechanisms of the postubiquitylation processes are poorly understood. Here, we have characterized a family of proteins that preferentially binds ubiquitylated substrates and multi-Ub chains through a motif termed theubiquitin-associated domain (UBA). Our in vivo genetic analysis demonstrates that such interactions require specific lysine residues of Ub that are important for Ub chain formation. We show that Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells lacking two of these UBA proteins, Dsk2 and Rad23, are deficient in protein degradation mediated by the UFD pathway and that the intact UBA motif of Dsk2 is essential for its function in proteolysis. Dsk2 and Rad23 can form a complex(es), suggesting that they cooperate to recognize a subset of multi-Ub chains and deliver the Ub-tagged substrates to the proteasome. Our results suggest a molecular mechanism for differentiation of substrate fates, depending on the precise nature of the mono-Ub or multi-Ub lysine linkage, and provide a foundation to further investigate postubiquitylation events.

In addition to its classical role in protein degradation, Ub is also emerging as a signal for protein transport and processing (1.Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Cell. 2001; 106: 527-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Ubiquitylation, the covalent conjugation of Ub to other intracellular proteins, regulates a broad range of basic cellular processes, including cell growth and differentiation, signal transduction, and stress responses (1.Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar, 2.Pickart C.M. Mol.

The Ub-proteasome system consists of two major parts. In the ubiquitylation part, Ub is activated and conjugated to a substrate through several intermediate steps that involve a Ub-activating enzyme (E1), a Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a Ub protein ligase (E3). With protein substrates targeted for degradation, successive Ub moieties are conjugated onto a substrate-linked Ub, yielding a substrate-linked multi-Ub chain. The second part of the Ub system involves the delivery of a ubiquitylated substrate to the 26 S proteasome; the substrate is then unfolded and processively degraded to small peptides. The biochemical mechanisms of the postubiquitylation events are poorly understood. Multi-Ub chain-binding proteins are thought to be the key players in this process. Thus far, two distinct proteins, Rpn10 and Cdc48, are known to bind multi-Ub chains and may be involved in this process (4.Fu H.Y. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. van Nocker S. Finley D.

Rpn10 is a proteasomal subunit of the 19 S regulatory complex, but there are no proteolytic defects in cells lacking the Ub-binding domain of Rpn10.

Genetic and biochemical studies have implicated RAD23 in the functioning of the Ub-proteasome system (8.Schauber C. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Vega I. Lambertson D. Potts W. Madura K.

Genome-wide two-hybrid analysis previously identified Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad23 as a Ub-interacting protein (12.Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S. Knight J.R. Lockshon D. Narayan V. Srinivasan M. Pochart P. Qureshi-Emili A. Li Y. Godwin B. Conover D. Kalbfleisch T. Vijayadamodar G. Yang M.J. Johnston M. Fields S. Rothberg J.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3901) Google Scholar). Rad23 contains a Ub-like domain (UBL) at its N terminus responsible for its interaction with the proteasome (8.Schauber C. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Vega I. Lambertson D. Potts W. Madura K. Nature. 1998; 391: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) and two ubiquitin-associated domains (UBA) (13.Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 172-173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Similar structures were found in Dsk2 and Ddi1, although each has only one UBA domain (Fig. 1A). Two groups recently reported the binding of Rad23 in S. cerevisiae and its homologs in Schizosaccharomyces pombe to single and tetra-Ub chains, respectively, through their UBA domains with conflicting results (see below) (14.Bertolaet B.L.

Stone M. Wallace M. Semple C. Gordon C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Aside from its function in proteolysis, RAD23 also plays roles in DNA repair by using UBL and XPC domains to link the 19 S proteasome cap to the nucleotide excision repair complex (8.Schauber C. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Vega I. Lambertson D. Potts W. Madura K. Nature. 1998; 391: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 16.Russell S.J. Reed S.H. Huang W.Y. Friedberg E.C. Johnston S.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 687-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The functional significance of UBA motifs in proteolysis is not known. Dsk2 and Ddi1 have not been shown to function in proteolysis, and the functional relationships among Rad23, Dsk2, and Ddi1 in proteolysis are unclear. Here we have studied the roles of Dsk2 and Rad23 in Ub-mediated proteolysis. Using the two-hybrid and GST binding assays, we found that these UBA-containing proteins bind ubiquitylated proteins, likely through the demonstrated ability of the UBA motif to recognize the multi-Ub chains that are involved in proteolysis. The UFD proteolytic pathway is impaired in cells lacking RAD23 and DSK2. We showed that the UBA motif is required for the functioning of Dsk2 in proteolysis. Because the UBA motif specifically binds Lys-29- and Lys-48-linked Ub chains, but not Lys-63-linked Ub chains, we propose that RAD23-like proteins, which contain both UBA and UBL motifs, are adapter molecules for delivering substrates to the proteasome. Other Ub chain-specific recognition factors are likely to be important for the functions of Ub chains assembled through other lysine linkages. S. cerevisiaePJ69–4A (MATa gal4Δ gal80Δ GAL2-ADE2 LYS2::GAL1-HIS3 met::GAL7-lacZ) was used for yeast two-hybrid assays. Strains MY3589, MY3587, MY3588, and MY3592 were gifts from M. Rose (20.Biggins S. Ivanovska I. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1331-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) was used to express GST fusion proteins. Yeast cultures were grown in rich (YPD containing 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) or in synthetic media containing standard ingredients. Two-hybrid plasmids containing the full length of RAD23, UFD2, DSK2, DDI1, CDC48, VAM3, and UBP14 were gifts from E. Friedberg, S. Jentsch, K. Frohlich, and T. Ito. The PCR products of RAD23 derivatives were fused to the 3′-end of the GST coding sequence for E. coli overexpression or to the 3′-end of the GAL4 fragments in pGBD and pGAD vectors for yeast two-hybrid assays. Similarly, Ub and its derivatives were inserted to the 3′-end of the GAL4 in pGBD and pGAD vectors. Construction details are available upon request. GST fusion protein or GST alone (∼2 μg) was mixed with the indicated amount of Ub (Sigma) or tetra-ubiquitin chains (Affinity) in 200 μl of binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml ovalbumin, 50 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5) and incubated with 20 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) for 2 h. The beads were washed three times with the binding buffer, followed by SDS-PAGE of the retained proteins and immunoblotting with a monoclonal anti-Ub antibody (Chemicon International). For GST pull-down with yeast extracts, ∼20 μg of yeast proteins were used for each GST binding reaction. We first confirmed the two-hybrid interaction between RAD23 and Ub (data not shown). In order to identify other proteins containing similar sequences for Ub binding, we wanted to determine the region of RAD23 involved in Ub interaction. We constructed two-hybrid fusions containing the UBL domain (RAD23UBL, amino acids 1–77), the RAD23 fragment lacking UBL (RAD23ΔUBL, amino acids 78–398), and the two UBA elements (RAD23UBA1, amino acids 145–185; RAD23UBA2, 354–394) separately (Fig. 1). These derivatives of RAD23 were tested in two-hybrid assays for interactions with wild-type Ub. We found that UBA motifs are sufficient for interaction with Ub (Fig. 1C) and that the two UBA-containing proteins Dsk2 and Ddi1 also interact with Ub. The binding could have been specifically to mono-Ub, multi-Ub chains, or ubiquitylated substrates. To distinguish among these possibilities, we first constructed a series of mutations in the Ub coding region that would affect its ability to form various conjugates (1.Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar, 2.Pickart C.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 499-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The design of these constructs was based on the different roles of amino acid residues in Ub. Ub chain formation requires the C-terminal Gly-76 of Ub to attach to a lysine residue of another Ub molecule or a substrate. Ub contains seven lysines, all of which can be utilized for multi-Ub chain assembly (Fig. 1B). Ub chains assembled through Lys-29 and Lys-48 are involved in proteolysis, whereas Lys-63-based chains have non-proteolytic functions (1.Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar, 2.Pickart C.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 499-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 17.Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27936-27943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the ability of Rad23 to bind to several Ub variants, including Ub-V76, which contained a Gly to Val mutation that eliminated its ability to conjugate to other proteins although it could still be an acceptor of other Ub molecules. Other constructs were Ub mutants containing various single or multiple Lys to Arg mutations that block Ub conjugation to those lysine residues (Fig. 1C). As a control, we employed UFD2, which encodes a multi-Ub chain-binding protein that requires a Lys-29 linkage for its function in Ub chain assembly (18.Johnson E.S. Ma P.C.M. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17442-17456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 19.Koegl M. Hoppe T. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Mayer T.U. Jentsch S. Cell. 1999; 96: 635-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). In the two-hybrid assays, UFD2 interacted with wild-type Ub and Ub derivatives that could both form Lys-29-linked chains and also be conjugated to the substrates (Fig. 1C). No interaction was observed with the Ub-V76 mutant, which could not be conjugated to other Ubs or proteins. These results suggested that the two-hybrid assay could be used to study the regulators for multi-Ub chain formation and maintenance in vivo. We found that the Ub interaction with UBA-containing proteins specifically required Gly-76 and at least one of the four lysines Lys-29, Lys-27, Lys-33, and Lys-48 but not Lys-63 or Lys-11 (Fig. 1C). The interactions between Ub and UBA domains were weaker, and they required either Lys-29 or Lys-48, both of which are known to be involved in proteolysis. It is worth noting again that Lys-63 has non-proteolytic functions and is not required for these interactions (1.Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar, 2.Pickart C.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 499-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 17.Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27936-27943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although Dsk2 and Ddi1 have only one copy of the UBA motif, their binding specificity toward Ub is similar to Rad23 but not to the UBA motif alone (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the sequences outside of the UBA motif could contribute to the binding of Ub, possibly through dimer formations (Fig. 3A). Because these interactions with Ub required Gly-76, which is essential for substrate conjugation, and specific lysine residues that are important for Ub chain formation, our data suggest that the UBA-containing proteins likely interact with multiubiquitylated substrates containing certain Ub linkages and that the interaction between Rad23-like proteins and Ub conjugates might be important for proteolysis. The UBA motif is found in many proteins in other organisms (13.Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 172-173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Using the yeast two-hybrid assay, we found that Ub could not interact with two of these UBA-containing yeast proteins, Ubp14 and Vam3 (data not shown), suggesting that not all UBA-bearing proteins bind to Ub stably. We also failed to observe two-hybrid interactions between Ub and RPN10 or CDC48, both of which have been demonstrated to bind multi-Ub chains using other biochemical assays (5.vanNocker S. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. Fu H.Y. Coux O. Wefes I. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6020-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar,6.Dai R.M. Li C.C.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). This suggests that Rpn10 and Cdc48 may adopt altered conformations when fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain or have lower affinities for Ub chains compared with the RAD23-like proteins in our assays. Although the two-hybrid assay is powerful, this genetic approach has its limitations, and the results obtained often need to be confirmed by other biochemical means. Hence we employed the GST pull-down assay to test the binding between ubiquitylated substrates and S. cerevisiae Rad23-like proteins. RAD23ΔUBL, RAD23UBL, and RAD23UBA2 were separately fused to the C terminus of GST. These proteins were overexpressed in E. coli and subsequently purified using glutathione beads (Fig. 2A). Purified proteins were then mixed with yeast extracts overexpressing myc-tagged Ub in the presence of glutathione beads. Ub-Rad23 bindings were assayed by immunoblotting with monoclonal anti-myc antibody to determine the amount of Ub retained in the GST beads. Ubiquitylated species, but not free Ub, were precipitated along with UBA-containing proteins (Fig. 2B), supporting the conclusion that the UBA motif binds preferentially to ubiquitylated substrates. The binding affinity of the UBA domain alone (RAD23UBA2) for ubiquitylated substrate is weaker than that of RAD23ΔUBL, which contains two UBA motifs. Does the UBA domain recognize a single Ub moiety or the multi-Ub chain attached to ubiquitylated substrates? Two groups recently reported the binding of Rad23 in S. cerevisiae and its homologs in S. pombe to single and tetra-Ub chains, respectively, with some conflicting results. Bertolaet et al. (14.Bertolaet B.L. Clarke D.J. Wolff M. Watson M.H. Henze M. Divita G. Reed S.I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) focused mainly on the ability of S. cerevisiae Rad23 and Ddi1 to interact with single Ub. Wilkinson et al. (15.Wilkinson C.R.M. Seeger M. Hartmann-Petersen R. Stone M. Wallace M. Semple C. Gordon C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) found that S. pombe Rad23 homologs interact with Ub chains specifically but not with single Ub, suggesting that Rad23 homologs in S. pombe may behave differently from those in S. cerevisiae. We wanted to compare the affinities of S. cerevisiae Rad23 to single and multi-Ub chains. To accomplish this, we used purified GST fusion proteins mixed with either single Ub or Lys-48-linked tetra-Ub chains (Ub4) in the presence of glutathione beads. Whereas about 0.1% Ub was recovered when 10 μg of Ub was mixed with GST-RAD23ΔUBL, ∼50% Ub4 was recovered when 0.01 μg of Ub4 was mixed with GST–RAD23ΔUBL (Fig. 2, C and D). The results indicated that the UBA-containing proteins preferentially bind Lys-48-linked tetra-Ub chains, the shortest multi-Ub chains that are recognized by the proteasome. Consistent with in vivo two-hybrid analysis, we found that the UBA motif is sufficient for binding to the Ub molecules, albeit with weaker affinity (Fig. 2, C and D). Our results show that the S. cerevisiae Rad23 protein, like its S. pombe counterpart, binds Ub chains preferentially, further suggesting that the failure in detecting an interaction between S. pombeRad23 and single Ub could be due to the lower affinity for free Ub (Fig. 2C). Results of these GST assays further validated the two-hybrid approach as an effective means to detect Ub and Ub chain binding activities in vivo. Since these Rad23-like proteins share similar structural domains and have similar specificities toward ubiquitin (Figs. 1 and 2), do these proteins function together or separately? We used the two-hybrid assay to examine the interactions among Rad23-like proteins. Interestingly, we found that Rad23 interacts with itself, Dsk2, and Ddi1 in vivo (Fig. 3A). Although the interactions are mediated by the fragment lacking the UBL domain, the UBA motif is not sufficient for the interactions (Fig. 3A). Our results suggest that these Rad23-like proteins may form complex(es) and cooperate with each other. Conceivably, different combinations of Rad23-like proteins may bind multi-Ub chains with different lysine linkages and thus provide chain selectivity or specificity. Do these RAD23-like proteins cooperate to function in proteolysis? Proteolysis defects were previously reported for the rad23Δ mutant (9.Lambertson D. Chen L. Madura K. Genetics. 1999; 153: 69-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stronger stabilization of substrates was found in cells lacking both RAD23 and RPN10, which encodes a proteasome subunit that binds multi-Ub chains, suggesting overlapping proteolytic functions between Rad23 and Rpn10 (9.Lambertson D. Chen L. Madura K. Genetics. 1999; 153: 69-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Wilkinson C.R.M. Seeger M. Hartmann-Petersen R. Stone M. Wallace M. Semple C. Gordon C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). However, it was not known whether DSK2 and DDI1 were involved in proteolysis. DSK2 was shown to be involved in duplication of the spindle pole body, and no proteolytic defects were found in cells lacking DSK2 (20.Biggins S. Ivanovska I. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1331-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To determine the roles of Dsk2 in proteolysis and the functional relationship between Dsk2 and Rad23, we examined the degradation of substrates of the N-end rule and UFD pathways in cells lacking either or both RAD23 and DSK2. We carried out pulse-chase assays with UbV76-V-βgal, a model substrate targeted by the UFD pathway (18.Johnson E.S. Ma P.C.M. Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17442-17456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Deletion of RAD23 compromised the UFD pathway, as ∼35% of UbV76-V-βgal was degraded after a 40-min chase (Fig. 3B, and data not shown) (9.Lambertson D. Chen L. Madura K. Genetics. 1999; 153: 69-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, deletion of DSK2 caused stronger stabilization of the UFD substrate, as ∼15% of UbV76-V-βgal was degraded after a 40-min chase (Fig. 3B). The double mutant dsk2Δrad23Δ, which is temperature sensitive for growth (20.Biggins S. Ivanovska I. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1331-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), completely stabilized the substrate at permissive temperature (Fig. 3B). It was noticed previously that a 90-kDa fragment is often produced during degradation of the β-gal protein (9.Lambertson D. Chen L. Madura K. Genetics. 1999; 153: 69-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This 90-kDa β-gal fragment was present in the pulse-chase of wild-type, rad23Δ, and dsk2Δ cells but absent in rad23Δdsk2Δ cells, further supporting that β-gal degradation is totally inhibited in the double mutant (Fig. 3B). Because the substrate UbV76-V-βgal was ubiquitylated in rad23Δ and dsk2Δ single mutants, our results suggested that Rad23 and Dsk2 act primarily after ubiquitylation. Failure to form complexes may partially account for the compromised UFD pathway in cells lacking RAD23 and DSK2 (Fig. 3, A and B). Our results show that DSK2 and RAD23 function in the same proteolytic pathway and are both required for the efficient degradation of the UFD substrate and suggest that Dsk2 and Rad23 likely cooperate to mediate Ub-dependent proteolysis. The reduction of multiubiquitylated forms in the rad23Δdsk2Δ cells (Fig. 3B) may be due to the lack of protection of ubiquitylated substrates from deubiquitylating enzymes in these mutants, although more experiments are required to further explore this possibility. The N-end rule pathway was unaffected by mutations in DSK2 and RAD23 (data not shown). Note, however, that the Ub chains of N-end rule substrates utilize a Ub linkage different from those used by UFD substrates. It would be of interest to determine the half-life of N-end rule substrates in cells lacking DDI1 alone or DDI1 with the additional mutations in DSK2 and RAD23. Is the UBA domain important for proteolysis? Previous studies showed that the UBA motif is not important for the function of Rad23-like proteins in DNA repair, a role separate from proteolysis (14.Bertolaet B.L. Clarke D.J. Wolff M. Watson M.H. Henze M. Divita G. Reed S.I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 16.Russell S.J. Reed S.H. Huang W.Y. Friedberg E.C. Johnston S.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 687-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In dsk2Δ cells, the normally short lived UbV76-V-βgal was long lived (Fig. 3, B and C). Transformation of dsk2Δ cells with a low copy plasmid expressing DSK2ΔUBA from its own promoter did not rescue the degradation of UbV76-V-βgal (Fig. 3C). In contrast, expression of full-length DSK2 restored the degradation of UbV76-V-βgal (data not shown). The data suggest that the UBA domain, and likely its ability to bind multi-Ub chains, is essential for the function of UBA-bearing proteins in proteolysis. Furthermore, the expression of DSK2ΔUBA from its own promoter did not restore the viability of cells lacking RAD23 and DSK2 at 37 °C (data not shown), suggesting that its function in proteolysis may be important for cell growth. We found that S. cerevisiae Rad23-like proteins bearing the UBA motif preferentially bind a subset of ubiquitin conjugates and multi-Ub chains that perform proteolytic functions. We have demonstrated that the intact UBA motif is essential for Dsk2 functioning in proteolysis and likely is important for the proteolytic functions of Rad23 and Ddi1. We found that these proteins bearing the UBA and UBL motifs could interact with themselves and each other, which may be the basis for the cooperation between Rad23 and Dsk2 in proteolysis. Ub chains linked through Lys-63 and Lys-48 can both signal proteolysis by the proteasome in an in vitro system. Interestingly, in vivo, Lys-48-linked chains can still signal proteolysis, but Lys-63-linked chains are recognized as non-proteolytic signals (17.Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27936-27943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). This suggested that specific chain-recognition molecules may exist in vivo to determine the functions of these Ub chains. The UBA motif is the first to be shown to exhibit the specificity to Ub conjugates with Lys-29 and Lys-48 linkages. The ability of Rad23-like proteins to interact with both ubiquitylated targets and the proteasome makes them likely adapter molecules for delivering substrates to the proteasome (Fig. 4). Other adapters likely exist to mediate the transport of ubiquitylated substrates to other non-proteolytic or proteolytic destinations (Fig. 4). Because Ent1 was shown to bind clathrin and the presence of the UIM motif suggests the possibility that Ent1 may bind Ub through the UIM motif (2.Pickart C.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 499-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 3.Hicke L. Cell. 2001; 106: 527-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), it can be speculated that Ent may link monoubiquitylated substrates to the endocytic machinery (Fig. 4A). The employment of these adapters offers more selection for substrates and regulation of the Ub system. Proteasomal subunits that are capable of multiubiquitin chain binding may cooperate with RAD23-like molecules in transferring, unfolding, and degrading the substrates, a possibility consistent with the synthetic phenotype enhancement in the double mutant of rpn10Δrad23Δ in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe (9.Lambertson D. Chen L. Madura K. Genetics. 1999; 153: 69-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Wilkinson C.R.M. Seeger M. Hartmann-Petersen R. Stone M. Wallace M. Semple C. Gordon C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The UBL and UBA motifs do not always co-exist in the same protein (13.Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 172-173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In an UBA-independent role, Rad23 also has non-proteolytic functions in DNA repair (8.Schauber C. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Vega I. Lambertson D. Potts W. Madura K. Nature. 1998; 391: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 14.Bertolaet B.L. Clarke D.J. Wolff M. Watson M.H. Henze M. Divita G. Reed S.I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 16.Russell S.J. Reed S.H. Huang W.Y. Friedberg E.C. Johnston S.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 687-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The XPC domain within Rad23 (Fig. 1A) interacts with DNA repair machineries, and the UBL domain within Rad23 interacts with the 19 S proteasome cap (8.Schauber C. Chen L. Tongaonkar P. Vega I. Lambertson D. Potts W. Madura K. Nature. 1998; 391: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 16.Russell S.J. Reed S.H. Huang W.Y. Friedberg E.C. Johnston S.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 687-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In this case, Rad23 acts as an adapter linking the 19 S proteasome regulatory complex to the Nucleotide Excision Repair complex. It is possible that Dsk2 and Ddi1 may similarly link the 19 S proteasome particle to complexes involved in other cellular processes, such as cell cycle progression or transcription elongation. Therefore, understanding the functions of DSK2 and DDI1 may lend insights to the non-proteolytic functions of the 19 S proteasome cap. Finally, the UBA motif exists in many proteins that do not contain the UBL domain. The UBA motifs found in E2, E3, and UBP enzymes may facilitate their functions in the assembly and disassembly of multi-Ub chains. Interestingly, the UBA domain also occurs in proteins that seemingly play no direct role in proteolysis, such as kinases, transcription factors, and splicing factors. However, these proteins or their binding partners may be ubiquitylated, and it is possible that these proteins utilize the UBA motifs to determine the fate of ubiquitylated substrates in ways similar to those depicted in Fig. 4C.

Thus, tBID oligomerization may represent an alternative mechanism for inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. The BCL-2 family members are major regulators of the apoptotic process. The cell death regulatory activity of these molecules is unknown, although it is thought that their function depends mostly on their ability to modulate mitochondrial function (1.Adams J.M. Cory S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 61-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). This family is comprised of both pro-apoptotic (e.g. BAX and BAK), as well as anti-apoptotic (e.g. BCL-2 and BCL-XL) molecules. Most family members share homology in three domains (BH1–3; “multidomain” members) and carry a C-terminal membrane-anchoring domain. The BH3 domain functions as a death domain in the pro-apoptotics. In a subset of the pro-apoptotics are the BH3-only molecules (e.g. BID and BIM). The BCL-2 family members have a strong tendency to form homodimers as well as heterodimers with each other. Using protein cross-linkers it has been demonstrated that BAX and BAK homodimerize in the mitochondrial membrane during apoptosis (2.Gross A. Jockel J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J.

Cell. 2000; 103: 273-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Based on this structural similarity and on in vitro electrophysiological data (7.Schendel S.L. Montal M. Reed J.C. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), it is suspected that BCL-2 family members may function as pore-forming proteins. Their tendency to oligomerize and their prominent subcellular location at intracellular membranes may add further support to the “pore hypothesis.” Caspases are the major executioners of the apoptotic process (8.Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). The BH3-only molecule BID serves as one of the links between BCL-2 family members and caspases. Following TNF-R1/Fas receptor activation, cytosolic p22 full-length BID is cleaved by caspase-8 (9.Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3756) Google Scholar, 10.Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1156-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). The truncated product, p15 tBID, translocates to the mitochondria to induce the release of cytochrome c (Cyt c). Cyt c activates Apaf-1, which in turn activates caspase-9 (12.Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4405) Google Scholar). Most importantly, BID is an essential component of the TNF-R1/Fas-death receptor pathway in hepatocytes, because Bid-deficient mice are resistant to the lethal effect of anti-Fas antibody injection (13.Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Full-length BID was initially identified as the only BCL-2 family member that can bind both pro-apoptotic (e.g. BAX) as well as anti-apoptotic (e.g. BCL-2) molecules (14.Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). It was also demonstrated that full-length BID does not homodimerize. The identification of the binding partners led to the assumption that BID acts as a “death ligand”: it receives a death signal in the cytosol and translocates to the mitochondria to transfer the signal to “death receptors” (e.g. BAX or BCL-2). Recently, it was indeed demonstrated that following its cleavage and translocation to the mitochondria, tBID induces the oligomerization of BAK or BAX, which results in Cyt c release (3.Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 4.Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strikingly, murine embryonic fibroblasts lacking both BAX and BAK are resistant to tBID-induced apoptosis (15.Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3299) Google Scholar). Based on the three-dimensional structure of BID, it was proposed that cleavage by caspase-8 and removal of the N-terminal 59 amino acids would potentially expose the BH3 domain together with a large hydrophobic domain (6.Fesik S.W. Cell. 2000; 103: 273-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). This hydrophobic domain, which includes two central hydrophobic core helices, constitutes the potential to form channels in membranes (16.Schendel S.L. Azimov R. Pawlowski K. Godzik A. Kagan B.L. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21932-21936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The exposure of this hydrophobic core may also lead to association with new partners. Here we examine the binding partners of tBID in the mitochondrial membrane following its translocation. We note that following a TNFα death signal, tBID becomes part of a 45-kDa cross-linkable complex in the membrane, which most likely represents a tBID homotrimer. Using a chimeric FKBP-tBID protein, we demonstrate that enforced dimerization of tBID is sufficient to induce Cyt c release, caspase activation, and apoptosis. However, these tBID dimers did not induce the dimerization of BAX or BAK. Moreover, a tBID BH3 mutant formed trimers and induced apoptosis without inducing the dimerization of BAX or BAK. Thus, tBID oligomers may act in an alternative pathway to induce mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. FL5.12, an interleukin-3-dependent murine early hematopoietic cell line, was maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 10% WEHI-3B conditioned medium as a source of interleukin-3. FL5.12 cells were treated with recombinant mouse TNFα (40 ng/ml; Sigma) and cycloheximide (1 μg/ml; Sigma) for 6 h, suspended in isotonic HIM buffer (200 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) and homogenized either using a polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments) at setting 6.5 for 10 s or by passing the cells 20 times through a 25 G (0.5 × 16) needle. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 120 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to collect the mitochondria-enriched fraction (mitochondria) and the supernatant (cytosol). 293T, an embryonic kidney cell line, HeLa, a human cervical adenocarcinoma cell line, and Cos-7, a simian kidney cell line, were maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate method (17.Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6464) Google Scholar) or with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). For the FKBP/FK1012 experiments, the cells were treated with 0.3 μm FK1012E/Z alone (1 mm stock solution in 50% ethanol, 50% dimethyl sulfoxide) or in combination with 1 μm FK506. FK1012E/Z and FK506 were generous gifts from P. Clemons and S. L. Schreiber (Harvard University). For propidium iodide staining experiments, the cells were allowed to grow to ∼60% confluence in 10-cm plates before transfection. The cells were transfected with 15 μg of each of the indicated plasmids. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, the cells were collected, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and fixed with methanol at −20 °C. The cells were recovered by centrifugation at 1,000 ×g for 5 min, washed once in PBS, and incubated in PBS containing 25 μg/ml propidium iodide and 50 μg/ml RNase A. The percentage of cells displaying a sub-G1 DNA content was determined by FACScan (Becton Dickinson) analysis. Sulfo-BSOCOES, BS3, and BMH (in dimethyl sulfoxide; Pierce) were added from a 10-fold stock solution to a final concentration of 10 mm. The cross-linker was added to either the cytosolic/soluble fraction or to the mitochondrial-enriched fraction and suspended in isotonic HIM buffer. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the cross-linker was quenched by the addition of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 20 mm. After quenching, the samples were lysed and Western blot analyzed with the indicated antibody. Recombinant tBID was prepared as previously described (4.Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S.

The protein import reaction and caspase-3 activity were performed as described (11.Gross A. Yin X.M. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J. Milliman C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol.

Schmid, University of Minnesota). Western blots were developed by use of the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To visualize35S-labeled in vitro transcribed and translated proteins by fluorography, SDS gels were fixed, incubated in amplify (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and dried before exposure to film. Wild type p15 tBID and tBID mIII-4 were amplified by PCR from wild type p22 BID (14.Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J.

To create the tBID-CFP and tBID-YFP chimeras, the tBID PCR product was ligated in-frame to the C terminus of ECFP or EYFP in the pECFP or pEYFP plasmids, respectively (CLONTECH). To create the tBID-GST chimera, the tBID PCR product was cloned into a modified pEF-BOS vector (19.Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar) in frame with the GST peptide derived from the procaryotic pGEX vector (originally from Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). 2N. Grammatikakis, paper in preparation. To create the HA-BAX plasmid, pcDNA3 with a HA epitope tag was ligated in-frame to the BAX product under the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter. The cells were transiently transfected by the calcium-phosphate method. Twelve hours post-transfection, the cells were treated briefly with trypsin and seeded into eight-chamber glass slides (Lab-Tek). The cells were then allowed to settle on the slide for 5 h. Single cells were excited at 430 nm using Polychrome II (TILL Photonics, Martinsried, Germany) via an inverted microscope equipped with 40 × 1.3 N.A objective, long pass dichroic mirror (455DRLP) and emission filters (450EFLP) (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT). An emitted fluorescence signal was passed through a MS127i spectrograph and collected using cooled, 16-bit back-illuminated CCD (Instaspec IV, Oriel, Stratford, CT) directly attached to the microscope side port (21-ms exposure with 16-μs read-out times/pixel). For visualizing spectral information, dark noise was first subtracted from the emission signal, and then the spectral counts were normalized to the spectral intensity (under the curve of 1024 spectral points) of cells expressing tBID−CFP+tBID−YFP. The average ratios of emission were calculated by first subtracting the dark noise (average of 258 counts/collection time) from the signal and then dividing the signal at 535 nm (YFP emission) by the signal at 490 nm (CFP emission). For immunocytochemistry, the cells were grown on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips. Twelve hours post-transfection the cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 6 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. For blocking, the cells were incubated in PBS containing 0.1% Triton and 3% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. To immunostain both BID and Cyt c, the cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-BID Ab and anti-Cyt c 6H2.B4 mAb (PharMingen) diluted 1:200 in blocking solution. After three washes with PBS containing 0.1% Triton, the cells were stained for 30 min at room temperature with Cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse (dilution 1:100, Jackson ImmunoResearch) and Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit Abs (dilution 1:150, Molecular Probes), followed by 5 min of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride staining (diluted 1:500 in PBS). For staining of mitochondria, the cells were incubated with 100 nm mitotracker red (MTR; Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C prior to fixation. The coverslips were mounted with elvanol, and the cells were viewed under a Nikon fluorescence microscope at a magnification of 400×. The pictures were taken with a 1310 digital camera (DVC). Confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axiovert 100 TV microscope (Oberkochen, Germany) attached to the Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 laser scanning system and operated by LaserSharp software. To reveal the mechanism by which BID executes its function, we utilized a series of chemical cross-linkers to identify proteins that closely associate with tBID at the mitochondrial membrane following its translocation. Treatment of FL5.12 hematopoietic cells with TNFα in the presence of CHX induces the cleavage of cytosolic full-length BID to generate p15 tBID that translocates to the mitochondria (Fig. 1A and Ref. 11.Gross A. Yin X.M. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J. Milliman C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1156-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). Mitochondria-enriched fractions prepared from healthy cells or from cells pretreated with TNFα/CHX were treated with sulfo-BSOCOES, a 13-Å, primary amine reactive cross-linker. At the end of the reaction, mitochondria were lysed and analyzed by Western blot using anti-BID antibodies. Cross-linker treatment of mitochondria prepared from TNFα/CHX-pretreated cells resulted in the appearance of a new ∼45-kDa BID-immunoreactive band (Fig. 1A, lane 4). This cross-linked band did not appear in mitochondria-enriched fractions prepared from healthy cells or in the cytosolic fraction of TNFα/CHX-pretreated cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 5). It was previously demonstrated that tBID heterodimerizes with BAK or BAX to induce their oligomerization in the mitochondrial membrane (3.Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar,4.Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore we checked whether BAX or BAK were part of the 45-kDa complex. Western blot analysis with anti-BAK antibodies did not detect any new bands (Fig. 1A, lane 9), indicating that BAK is not part of the 45-kDa BID complex. On the other hand, Western blot analysis with anti-BAX antibodies detected two additional BAX-immunoreactive bands slightly below the 46-kDa marker (Fig. 1A, lane 13). To determine whether one of these bands represents a BAX-BID heterodimer, BAX was immunoprecipitated (using the 4D2 monoclonal antibody) from mitochondria following cross-linker treatment, and the immunocomplexes were subjected to Western blot analysis using either anti-BAX (651) or anti-BID polyclonal antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1B, anti-BAX antibodies recognized these two upper bands in the BAX immunoprecipitate (lane 2), but anti-BID antibodies did not (lane 4). Based on these results, it is likely that these bands represent a BAX homodimer and not a BAX-BID heterodimer. Western blot analysis with a variety of other antibodies against BCL-XL, BCL-2, porin/VDAC, adenine nucleotide translocator, and Cyt c indicated that none of these molecules were part of the 45-kDa BID complex (not shown). To confirm that tBID is part of the 45-kDa complex and to assess the time course of its formation in the mitochondrial membrane, we performed a standard protein import reaction using tBID. 35S-Labeled in vitro transcribed and translated tBID was incubated with purified intact mouse liver mitochondria, followed by centrifugation to separate the mitochondria from the soluble fraction. Both fractions were treated with the sulfo-BSOCOES cross-linker and analyzed by autoradiography. Ten minutes after adding tBID to mitochondria, a substantial amount of tBID was incorporated into the mitochondrial membrane (Fig. 2A, lane 4). As soon as tBID appeared in the mitochondria, the 45-kDa cross-linked complex also appeared. Moreover, as more tBID incorporated into the membrane, the intensity of the 45-kDa band increased (Fig. 2A, lane 6). Western blot analysis with anti-BID antibodies verified that tBID was part of this complex (Fig. 2A, lanes 8 and 9). The ∼40-kDa bands that appear in the mitochondrial and soluble fractions do not seem to include tBID because they are not detected with anti-BID antibodies (Fig. 2A, lane 9). We have also probed the blot with antibodies against BAX, BAK, BCL-XL, BCL-2, porin/VDAC, adenine nucleotide translocator, and Cyt c and found that none of these molecules were part of the mitochondrial 45-kDa complex assembled from 35S-labeled tBID. We have performed a similar protein import assay using recombinant tBID (rtBID). rtBID also became part of a 45-kDa protein complex in the mitochondrial membrane following cross-linker treatment (not shown). However, in the absence of both purified mitochondria and cross-linker, rtBID appeared as two bands in SDS gels (∼15 and ∼30 kDa) (Fig. 2B, lane 1). Moreover, in the absence of a reducing agent (dithiothreitol) or without boiling the sample prior to loading, additional ∼45- and ∼60-kDa bands appeared (Fig. 2B, lanes 2–4). Thus, rtBID forms homooligomers in solution that are sensitive to reducing agents and to high temperature but resistant to SDS. Based on these findings, we analyzed whether cytosolic tBID (from FL5.12 cells) could also oligomerize on SDS gels in the absence of a reducing agent and without prior boiling. In contrast to rtBID, cytosolic tBID did not oligomerize under these conditions (not shown). Based on our previous findings with rtBID, we suspected that the 45-kDa complex might represent a tBID homotrimer. To assess whether tBID-tBID interactions occur in the mitochondrial membrane, we have performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments in cells transiently transfected with tBID tagged with either an HA or a FLAG epitope. It was previously demonstrated that non-ionic detergents (e.g. Nonidet P-40) artificially induce the dimerization of BCL-2 family members, whereas zwitterionic detergents (e.g.CHAPS) do not (20.Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have used CHAPS in these experiments to extract tBID from the mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondria-enriched fractions purified from transfected cells were incubated in isotonic buffer containing 0.1% CHAPS for 1 h, followed by centrifugation and separation of the mitochondrial pellet from the soluble fraction. FLAG-tBID was immunoprecipitated from the soluble fraction by anti-FLAG antibodies followed by Western blot with either anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 3A, left panel) or anti-HA antibodies (right panel). The results indicate that HA-tBID interacts with FLAG-tBID in the mitochondrial membrane. Next, we addressed the question of whether tBID-tBID interactions occur only in the mitochondrial membrane or can also occur in the cytosol. Using differential centrifugation, we have purified the cytosolic and mitochondria-enriched fractions from transfected cells and immunoprecipitated FLAG-tBID from each fraction. As shown in Fig. 3B, the amount of HA-tBID that was co-immunoprecipitated from the mitochondria-enriched fraction, was ∼10-fold higher than the amount co-immunoprecipitated from the cytosolic fraction (right panel). Similar levels of FLAG-tBID were immunoprecipitated from both fractions (Fig. 3B, left panel). Thus, the major site for tBID-tBID interactions is the mitochondrial membrane. We also wanted to test whether tBID-tBID interactions occur in living cells. For this purpose we have used cyan and yellow fluorescence proteins (CFP and YFP) and performed FRET analysis (21.Heim R. Tsien R.Y. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 178-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). To perform these experiments with tBID, we constructed chimeras of tBID with either CFP (tBID-CFP) or YFP (tBID-YFP), and transfected cells with both tBID-CFP and tBID-YFP, only tBID-CFP, only tBID-YFP, or both unfused CFP and YFP as a control. Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates with anti-BID antibodies indicated that both fusion proteins were expressed at the expected sizes (not shown). To assess the cellular localization of both chimeras, transfected cells were incubated with MTR (to label mitochondria) and were analyzed by confocal microscopy. These studies demonstrated that a major part of both chimeric molecules co-localized with MTR, suggesting mitochondrial localization (Fig. 4A). To assess whether both chimeric proteins were inducing apoptosis, we measured the percentage of cells displaying a sub-G1 DNA content. Both chimeras were found to be fully functional, because transfection with either of the chimeras induced apoptosis to levels that were similar to the levels induced with wild type tBID (Fig. 4B). Next, we performed FRET analysis on cells 14 h post-transfection. Single intact cells were excited at 430 nm, and the emission spectrum between 450 and 700 nm was recorded. As expected, cells transfected with only tBID-CFP showed an emission peak at 490 nm, whereas cells transfected with only tBID-YFP showed an emission peak at 535 nm (Fig. 4C). A significant difference in the emission ratio (535/495 nm) was seen between cells co-transfected with both tBID-CFP and tBID-YFP compared with cells co-transfected with CFP and YFP, with emission ratios of 1.39 ± 0.04 (n = 20) and 0.98 ± 0.04 (n = 17) (p < 0.005), respectively (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that there is a significant FRET between the tBID-CFP and tBID-YFP in living cells, suggesting physical interaction between the tBID molecules. The results presented in Figs. 3 and 4 indicate that tBID-tBID interactions occur in mitochondria of living cells. To assess whether tBID forms homotrimers in mitochondria, we have constructed a tBID-human GST chimera and performed cross-linking experiments. We have transiently transfected tBID, tBID-GST, or unfused GST into cells. Mitochondria-enriched fractions prepared from these cells were treated with cross-linker followed by Western blot analysis with anti-BID or anti-GST antibodies.

https://openalex.org/W2061319036,"The crystal structure of the nitroreductase enzyme from Enterobacter cloacae has been determined for the oxidized form in separate complexes with benzoate and acetate inhibitors and for the two-electron reduced form. Nitroreductase is a member of a group of enzymes that reduce a broad range of nitroaromatic compounds and has potential uses in chemotherapy and bioremediation. The monomers of the nitroreductase dimer adopt an α+β fold and together bind two flavin mononucleotide prosthetic groups at the dimer interface. In the oxidized enzyme, the flavin ring system adopts a strongly bent (16°) conformation, and the bend increases (25°) in the reduced form of the enzyme, roughly the conformation predicted for reduced flavin free in solution. Because free oxidized flavin is planar, the induced bend in the oxidized enzyme may favor reduction, and it may also account for the characteristic inability of the enzyme to stabilize the one electron-reduced semiquinone flavin, which is also planar. Both inhibitors bind over the pyrimidine and central rings of the flavin in partially overlapping sites. Comparison of the two inhibitor complexes shows that a portion of helix H6 can flex to accommodate the differently sized inhibitors suggesting a mechanism for accommodating varied substrates.

This results in NR's activity being “oxygen-insensitive,” in that the enzyme does not readily transfer one electron to molecular oxygen to form the superoxide radical (13.Bryant C. DeLuca M. J. Biol.

Several other FMN-containing oxidoreductases have been identified that have similar broad substrate specificity ranges and also do not stabilize the semiquinone state of the bound flavin.

A fresh solution of sodium dithionite was added to cryoprotectant, and 25 μl of the resulting solution was gently mixed with oxidized NR crystals in 25 μl of cryoprotectant. After ∼10 min, 25 μl of cryoprotectant buffer was removed and replaced with 25 μl of cryoprotectant buffer containing dithionite. This procedure was repeated two more times. The crystals lost their deep yellow color over the course of the treatment. They were then immediately flash cooled and stored in liquid nitrogen prior to data collection. Crystals were held at 115 K for data collection on a CuKα source with an R-AXIS IV++ image plate detector. Data were reduced with the HKL (32.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38440) Google Scholar) and CCP4 packages (33.CCP4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Initial restraint files for FMN were also taken from the HIC-UP site and modified to reflect theoretical values for oxidized and reduced flavin (36.Dixon D.A. Lindner D.L. Branchaud B. Lipscomb W.N.

Individual weighting values for the FMN geometry parameters were adjusted to give stable refinement while still allowing the flavin to adopt the correct conformation (as judged by omit density and tests with low geometry weights and noncrystallographic symmetry restraints on the FMN groups to stabilize refinement). Initial manual rebuilding was followed by simulated annealing refinement in CNS and subsequent cycles of manual rebuilding (37.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

A central sheet consists of four antiparallel strands, with a fifth, parallel strand arising from the C terminus of the other dimer subunit. Surrounding the sheet are two large helices on one side, three smaller helices on the other, and two helices that pack against one end of the sheet. Several small helices or helical turns are also present. The FMN prosthetic groups bind in deep pockets at the dimer interface and interact with elements from both monomers (see Fig. 2 for FMN structure and numbering). In NR, each flavin group packs up against one end (S3) of the central sheet and is surrounded by helices H4 and H7. Helix H6 and the loop between H2 and S1 (particularly residues 36–43) from the other subunit form a cap over the cofactor binding site. H7 from that monomer also contributes to the pocket.Figure 2Chemical structure and atom numbering of the flavin mononucleotide prosthetic group of nitroreductase. a, oxidized flavin; b, fully reduced anionic form of the flavin.

The other orientation is referred to as the si face.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Affinity for the FMN cofactor is high (10 nm), and within this structural family, binding typically involves extensive interactions with the protein, some of which are conserved or similar across the group. The polar groups in the isoalloxazine ring of FMN typically participate in a number of hydrogen bond interactions with protein, and seven hydrogen bonds with the flavin are present in the NR crystal structure. One group of contacts involves the N1, O4, and N3 positions of the ring system, including donation of a hydrogen bond by the backbone amide of Glu-165 to N5, which is thought to be the site of hydride transfer (40.Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 126-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). This set of interactions is remarkably well conserved across the entire group of homologues, although the identities of some residues vary. One interacting residue, Gly-166 in NR, is absolutely conserved within the group. Main-chain torsion angles for this residue are either near the β-strand region of the Ramachandran plot (NR, NTR, FRase I, and NOX) or in the helical region (FRP and NfsA), both allowed positions for residues with side chains. Glycine is not, therefore, required at this position because of its greater backbone flexibility. Instead it may be conserved, because any side-chain atoms would intrude on space over the flavin reserved for substrate binding. The other group of contacts with the isoalloxazine ring involves the O2 and in some cases N1 atoms, which largely interact with basic residues. In NR and NTR, for example, there are two strong interactions between O2 of the pyrimidine ring and lysines 14 and 74. Unlike the first set of contacts, however, these interactions vary substantially across the group of related enzymes. This variation within the second group of interactions is particularly interesting, because the anionic forms of both the one- and two-electron reduced flavins develop resonance stabilized negative charge at the N1–C2=O2 locus. Positive electrostatic potential from the protein near this region is a common feature of flavoenzymes, and the degree of positive charge is thought to be a strong factor in determining the redox potential of the system (40.Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 126-132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 41.Ghisla S. Massey V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Variations in the exact nature of the contacts within the related group may then modulate the redox characteristics of the enzymes. In each of the NR homologues, the carbonyl oxygen from a residue located on the si side of the flavin interacts with the π system at the central ring (Fig. 3). The carbonyl oxygen is contributed by a proline residue (Pro-163) in NR. It is positioned about 2.8 Å from the plane of the central ring and almost directly below its center point, where the protein backbone runs across the short axis of the flavin. The rigid proline residue in NR is not required to place the carbonyl group in the observed orientation. Although both NTR and NOX also have prolines at this position, FRase I has a threonine (Thr-163), and NfsA and FRP both have tyrosines. As noted by others (42.Breinlinger E.C. Keenan C.J. Rotello V.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 8606-8609Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar), this interaction of an electronegative group with the central region of the isoalloxazine ring is found in a number of flavin-containing proteins. The extensive interactions with the protein have a substantial effect on the conformation of the flavin. Both structural (43.Truss B.L. Fritchie C.J.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct.

In contrast, the flavins in the oxidized NR structures are curved along their lengths (Fig. 3). This distortion of the isoalloxazine has been termed butterfly bending to indicate a rigid motion of the two end rings about the N5–N10 axis. Both oxidized structures have the same overall bend of ∼16°, with an r.m.s. difference in atomic positions of only 0.03 Å. Although there have been other flavoproteins reported with similar or even more extreme butterfly bends, they are rare, probably comprising 10% or less of the reported structures (54.Lennon B.W. Williams C.H. Ludwig M.L. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2366-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Crystallographic thermal factors indicate low mobility of the flavin, with an average on all atoms of 12.5 Å2 for the oxidized acetate complex and 11.4 Å2 for the oxidized benzoate complex. The flavin is rigidly fixed by interactions with the protein and is not disturbed by binding different ligands over the re face. It is likely that the geometry of the binding site plays a role in inducing the bent flavin conformation. The dimethylbenzene ring and a portion of the central ring are held tightly by structural elements on both faces. Hydrogen bonding groups interacting with the pyrimidine end of the isoalloxazine arise largely from the si side of the flavin, the same direction as the bend. On binding, then, the interactions with the pyrimidine ring are optimized at the cost of distorting the flavin. Bending of the flavin cofactor has also been attributed to steric aspects of the binding site in pyruvate oxidase (55.Müller Y.A. Schumacher G. Rudolph R. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), NADH oxidase (24.Hecht H.J. Erdmann H. Park H.-J. Sprinzl M. Schmid R.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1109-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and in the reduced form of thioredoxin reductase (54.Lennon B.W. Williams C.H. Ludwig M.L. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2366-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition, specific features of the protein-flavin interaction in NR may affect flavin conformation. Among the NR homologues, the interactions that stand out are: 1) the presence of an electron rich group (main-chain carbonyl oxygen in NR and its homologues) interacting with the π system of the isoalloxazine at or near the central ring, 2) a hydrogen bond donor (main-chain amide in NR and homologues) interacting with N5 of the flavin, 3) the presence of positively charged residues near the N1–C2=O2 locus, and 4) the absence of parallel π-π stacking of aromatic side chains with the flavin. To assess the significance of these interactions, we examined 54 flavoproteins in a unique data set identified by Lennon et al. (54.Lennon B.W. Williams C.H. Ludwig M.L. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2366-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) for the presence of each of the four interactions and grouped the data into three bend angle classes: 0–5°, 5–10°, and >10°. Only parallel stacking of the flavin with an aromatic group from the protein was clearly correlated with bend angle, being absent in all twelve structures in the highest bend angle group. All of the surveyed aromatic interactions involve stacking, at least in part, with the central ring of the isoalloxazine. Because this ring becomes significantly nonplanar and the π system weakens in a highly bent flav"
https://openalex.org/W2094335398,"Siderophore-binding proteins play an essential role in the uptake of iron in many Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. FhuD is an ATP-binding cassette-type (ABC-type) binding protein involved in the uptake of hydroxamate-type siderophores inEscherichia coli. Structures of FhuD complexed with the antibiotic albomycin, the fungal siderophore coprogen and the drug Desferal have been determined at high resolution by x-ray crystallography. FhuD has an unusual bilobal structure for a periplasmic ligand binding protein, with two mixed β/α domains connected by a long α-helix. The binding site for hydroxamate-type ligands is composed of a shallow pocket that lies between these two domains. Recognition of siderophores primarily occurs through interactions between the iron-hydroxamate centers of each siderophore and the side chains of several key residues in the binding pocket. Rearrangements of side chains within the binding pocket accommodate the unique structural features of each siderophore. The backbones of the siderophores are not involved in any direct interactions with the protein, demonstrating how siderophores with considerable chemical and structural diversity can be bound by FhuD. For albomycin, which consists of an antibiotic group attached to a hydroxamate siderophore, electron density for the antibiotic portion was not observed. Therefore, this study provides a basis for the rational design of novel bacteriostatic agents, in the form of siderophore-antibiotic conjugates that can act as “Trojan horses,” using the hydroxamate-type siderophore uptake system to actively deliver antibiotics directly into targeted pathogens.

Therefore, this study provides a basis for the rational design of novel bacteriostatic agents, in the form of siderophore-antibiotic conjugates that can act as “Trojan horses,” using the hydroxamate-type siderophore uptake system to actively deliver antibiotics directly into targeted pathogens. Because the bioavailability of iron is very low (10−18m), there is an intense competition between host and pathogen for soluble iron. Low molecular weight compounds called siderophores serve to scavenge iron from the environment for bacterial uptake. Two major classes of siderophores exist, hydroxamates and catecholates. Although Escherichia coli itself produces only one siderophore, enterobactin, it can utilize siderophores from a variety of sources. Several ferric siderophore uptake systems have been characterized from E. coli. Each system consists of a specific outer membrane receptor, a periplasmic protein, and several inner membrane-associated proteins. The energy for transport of the ferric siderophore across the outer membrane is provided by interaction of the receptor with the TonB complex (reviewed in Ref. 1.Braun V. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 16: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the energy for ferric siderophore transport across the inner membrane is provided by hydrolysis of ATP by the inner membrane-associated proteins. This arrangement of protein components and mechanism of transport is typical of systems for uptake of amino acids, sugars, and other nutrients in Gram-negative bacteria (2.Clarke T.E. Tari L.W. Vogel H.J. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2001; 1: 7-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 3.Braun V. Hantke K. Köster W. Met. Ions. Biol.

The uptake of hydroxamate-type siderophores in E. coli is the best characterized bacterial iron uptake system to date. E. coli has several distinct receptors for each different siderophore, including FhuA for ferrichrome, FhuE for coprogen, and FoxA for ferrioxamine B. However, a common periplasmic protein, FhuD, can bind and shuttle a variety of hydroxamate siderophores to the inner membrane-associated proteins FhuB and FhuC. Fungal hydroxamate siderophores generally consist of similar structural units (δ-N-hydroxy-ornithine, trans-anhydromevalonic acid, and acetic acid), but the number and arrangement of these units can vary. Ferrichrome, originally identified from the smut fungusUstilago maydis, is likely the most studied hydroxamate-type siderophore thus far (5.Llinas M. Klein M.P. Neilands J.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 52: 399-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 6.Llinas M. Klein M.P. Neilands J.B. Int. J. Pept.

Biopolymers. 1990; 30: 239-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The apo and holo structures of theE. coli receptor FhuA, which transports ferrichrome and the structurally related antibiotic albomycin, has recently been solved (8.Ferguson A.D. Hofmann E. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W. Science. 1998; 282: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 9.Locher K.P. Rees B. Koebnik R. Mitschler A. Moulinier L. Rosenbusch J.P. Moras D.

Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 956-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The receptor forms a 22-stranded β-barrel in the bacterial membrane, with an N-terminal domain, which fills the inside of the barrel. In addition, the periplasmic protein FhuD has also been solved as a complex with the ferrichrome analogue gallichrome, where the iron atom coordinated to ferrichrome is replaced with gallium (11.Clarke T.E. Ku S.Y. Dougan D.R. Vogel H.J. Tari L.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The structure of the periplasmic protein is unusual for its function, forming a bilobate structure connected by a long α-helix, in contrast to the typical two domain structure connected by several β-sheets found in most other periplasmic ligand binding proteins (12.Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). In FhuD, a shallow pocket is located between the two domains for ferrichrome binding. In both the FhuA receptor and FhuD periplasmic protein, ferrichrome is cradled in a pocket lined with aromatic residues, with a few specific hydrogen bonds from the hydroxamate portion of the siderophore to side chains in the binding site. In all the hydroxamate-type siderophores, six oxygen atoms of the hydroxamate portion coordinate a ferric iron, although the overall structures vary considerably. Unlike ferrichrome, coprogen is a linear chain of threeNδ-hydroxy-Nδ-acylated ornithines (13.Hossain M.B. Jalal M.A.F. Benson B.A. Barnes C.L. van der Helm D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 4948-4954Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this siderophore, two amino acids join to form a diketopiperazine ring, whereas the third is attached by an ester linkage. Two trans-anhydromevalonic acid groups are attached to either end of the molecule. Desferal, which is related to desferrioxamine siderophores, has a very high affinity for Fe3+ (KD = 10−31m) and is used to treat iron overload in thalassemia and transfusion patients (14.Hershko C. Mol. Aspects Med. 1992; 13: 113-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and has been shown to retard progressive neurological degeneration in Alzheimer's patients (15.McLachlan D.R. Kruck T.P. Lukiw W.J. Krishnan S.S. CMAJ. 1991; 145: 793-804PubMed Google Scholar). In the body, it can remove iron from the C terminus of human skeletal transferrin (16.Folajtar D.A. Chasteen N.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 5775-5780Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and E. coli can utilize iron loaded Desferal as an iron source. Presumably, the hydroxamate center of each of these iron complexes is the common structural feature that is important for recognition by the bacterial proteins involved in iron uptake. Conjugation of antibiotics to siderophores has shown promise for therapeutic control of bacterial infections (17.Roosenberg J.M. Lin Y.M. Lu Y. Miller M.J. Curr. Med. Chem. 2000; 7: 159-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The naturally occurring antibiotic albomycin has a thioribosyl pyrimidine antibiotic group attached to an iron binding moiety similar to that of ferrichrome. This antibiotic enters the cell by the ferrichrome uptake system, then the antibiotic group is released from the remainder of the molecule by peptidase N (18.Hartmann A. Fiedler H.P. Braun V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 99: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 19.Braun V. Gunthner K. Hantke K. Zimmermann L. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 308-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the intracellular target of albomycin is unknown, the minimal inhibitory concentration (0.005 μg/ml) is very low compared with other antibiotics, such as ampicillin (0.1 μg/ml) (20.Pugsley A.P. Zimmerman W. Wehrli W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 3505-3511PubMed Google Scholar). In recent years, development of synthetic conjugates of antibiotics and siderophores has been successful in limiting the growth of certain bacteria (17.Roosenberg J.M. Lin Y.M. Lu Y. Miller M.J. Curr. Med. Chem. 2000; 7: 159-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The siderophore acts as a “Trojan horse,” actively carrying the antibiotic across the cell membrane via the specific ferric siderophore uptake system into the cell. However, rational design of a novel, effective antibiotic by chemical conjugation is challenging. Many chemical and biological factors pertaining to the effect on the bacteria and impact on the host must be considered. Chemical properties important for drug design include structural similarity to siderophores, solubility, and lipophilicity. Biological considerations for development of novel bacteriostatics involve toxicity to the bacteria and host and repercussions from the metabolism of the conjugate. Criteria for broad-spectrum use of the antibiotic and for overcoming the resistance mechanisms of the bacteria must also be considered. Identification of the important structural features for siderophore recognition by bacteria constitutes a key step in the design of novel bacteriostatic agents. In this study, the structures of different FhuD siderophore complexes have been solved by x-ray crystallography. The crystal structures of FhuD complexed to the antibiotic albomycin, the siderophore coprogen, and the drug Desferal are presented here. This study reveals how FhuD is able to bind, with high affinity, a structurally diverse series of hydroxamate siderophores. The overexpression strain BL21(DE3) pLysS pMR21 was obtained from Dr. W. Köster (Swiss Federal Institute for Environmental Science and Technology, Switzerland). His-tag FhuD was purified by metal chelate chromatography (POROS 20MC) charged with nickel, similarly as previously described (21.Rohrbach M.R. Paul S. Köster W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) except that the BioCad high performance liquid chromatography system (PerSeptive Biosystems) was used. After cell lysis in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.5 m NaCl, the protein was bound to the column and washed with 10 volumes of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.5m NaCl to remove unbound proteins and eluted with a gradient of 0–0.5 m imidazole. The protein was then dialyzed extensively against 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5 at 4 °C. The His-tag of the protein was not cleaved off by enterokinase, because previous studies showed that the modified protein was functional (21.Rohrbach M.R. Paul S. Köster W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Albomycin δ2 and coprogen were purified as previously described (10.Ferguson A.D. Braun V. Fiedler H.P. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 956-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 21.Rohrbach M.R. Paul S. Köster W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Desferal (desferrioxamine mesylate) was obtained from Ciba-Geigy Canada. For each siderophore, a 1 mm stock solution of the ferric siderophore complex was made using Fe2(NO3)3 (99.9%, Aldrich Chemical Co.) at acidic pH. Albomycin, coprogen, and Desferal each bind iron in a 1:1 siderophore to iron molar ratio. The ferric siderophores were added to apo-FhuD in a 1:1 ratio in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Crystals of His-tag FhuD complexed with coprogen and Desferal were grown at room temperature by hanging-drop vapor diffusion from 5-μl drops containing 8.3 mg ml−1 of the FhuD-ferric siderophore complex, 0.8 m disodium/potassium phosphate and 0.05 m HEPES, pH 7.5. The drops were equilibrated against a 1-ml reservoir containing 1.6 m disodium/potassium phosphate and 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5. In a similar manner, crystals of His-tag FhuD complexed with albomycin were grown at room temperature in 5-μl drops containing 8.3 mg ml−1 of the FhuD-albomycin complex, 8% polyethylene glycol 4000, and 0.05m sodium acetate, pH 5.2 and equilibrated against a 1-ml reservoir containing 16% polyethylene glycol 4000 and 0.1m sodium acetate, pH 5.2. Large, diffraction quality crystals grew within 2 weeks. For cryo-crystallography experiments, crystals were soaked in a stabilizing solution identical to the reservoir solutions with a final concentration of 30% (v/v) glycerol. Data on the FhuD-albomycin complex were collected on a Rigaku RUH3RHB rotating copper anode x-ray generator equipped with Osmic confocal multilayer x-ray focusing optics and an MAR 345 image plate scanner. Data on the FhuD coprogen complex were collected at the X12-C x-ray beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven National Laboratories) using a Brandeis B4 CCD 1The abbreviations used are: CCDcharge-coupled devicePDBProtein Data Bankdetector. Data for the FhuD-Desferal complex were collected at the 7-1 x-ray beamline at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center) using a Quantum 4R CCD detector. All data were collected on crystals frozen to 100 K in a cold gas stream generated by an Oxford Cryostream crystal-cooling device. Each FhuD ferric siderophore crystal was found to belong to the space group P63, with small variations in unit cell dimensions. Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using DENZO/SCALEPACK (22.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38609) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab charge-coupled device Protein Data Bank All phasing calculations, density modification, and refinement were carried out using the CNS suite of programs (23.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The structures of the complexes determined in this study are isomorphous with the recently solved structure of the FhuD gallichrome complex (11.Clarke T.E. Ku S.Y. Dougan D.R. Vogel H.J. Tari L.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank (PDB) number 1EFD). The coordinates from this structure, minus the ligand and water molecules, were used as a starting model for refinement. Rigid body refinement was followed by refinement by maximum likelihood refinement against structure factors. The quality of the electron density maps were excellent, allowing for the unambiguous tracing of most of the polypeptide chain using TURBO-FRODO (24.Roussel A. Cambillau C. TURBO-FRODO. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partner Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989Google Scholar) for interactive model building. Five percent of the reflections were set aside for the calculation of a free R-factor, and the same set of reflections was maintained throughout refinement. Ordered water molecules and the ferric siderophore could be incorporated into the model manually, using 2Fo −Fcαc andFo −Fcαc maps. The structures of similar ferric siderophores were found in the Cambridge Structural Data base (www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/prods/csd/csd.html), and their structures were modified accordingly. For albomycin, the structure of ferrichrome from the FhuA-ferrichrome complex (PDB 1FCP (8.Ferguson A.D. Hofmann E. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W. Science. 1998; 282: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar)) was slightly modified. The model of coprogen was based on the structure of the neocoprogen I molecule (Cambridge Structural Data base number COFDIK10 (23.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar)), which was modified to include a trans-anhydromevalonic acid group attached to the ornithine backbone. Desferal, based on ferrioxamine (Cambridge Structural Data base number DUPJON (25.Hossain M.B. Jalal M.A.F. van der Helm D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. C Cryst. Struct. Commun. 1986; 42: 1305Crossref Google Scholar)), was modeled into the binding site using TURBO-FRODO (24.Roussel A. Cambillau C. TURBO-FRODO. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partner Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989Google Scholar). Topology and parameter files for the ferric siderophores were generated using the Hic-Up server (x-ray.bmc.uu.se/hicup (26.Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar)) and adjusted appropriately. The structure of each complex was refined by several rounds of molecular dynamics and annealing using standard protocols by CNS (23.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). A final inspection of 2Fo −Fcαc andFo −Fcαc maps were used to locate all remaining ordered solvent molecules. The stereochemical quality of the final structures was evaluated using PROCHECK version 3.4.4 (27.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar,28.Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 345-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar). The refined coordinates of FhuD complexed with albomycin, coprogen, and Desferal have been deposited in the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank under PDB numbers 1K7S, 1ESZ, and 1K2V, respectively. Each FhuD siderophore complex crystallized in the hexagonal space group P63 with similar cell dimensions to the FhuD-gallichrome complex (11.Clarke T.E. Ku S.Y. Dougan D.R. Vogel H.J. Tari L.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) (Table I), with one complex in each asymmetric unit. Phasing and refinement statistics are reported for each complex in Table I. In the structures for the FhuD protein in each complex, the first 26 N-terminal amino acids (containing the His-tag and the enterokinase cleavage site) and the last three C-terminal amino acids (residues 294–296) could not be modeled, whereas the electron density describing the remainder of the protein is continuous. Several side chains of surface-exposed residues were also missing and were built as alanines in the model. The electron density for the iron atom coordinated to each siderophore was well defined. However, the electron density for the siderophores in each case was partially complete, and only portions of each molecule were included in the models. The electron density for the antibiotic portion of the albomycin was missing, and the density for a methyl group of the coprogen was missing as well as the mesylate (OSO2CH3) group of the Desferal (Fig. 1). The overall structures of the FhuD proteins in all complexes are very similar to the protein found in the gallichrome complex (Fig. 2). In each complex, the overall quality of the protein structure is excellent, with over 90% of the amino acid residues occupying the most favorable region of a Ramachandran plot (data not shown). The protein is bilobate, with a kidney bean shape, with the two domains connected by a 23-residue kinked α-helix (residues 142–165) (11.Clarke T.E. Ku S.Y. Dougan D.R. Vogel H.J. Tari L.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain has a twisted five-stranded parallel β-sheet whereas the C-terminal domain has a mixed five-stranded β-sheet, with both surrounded by α-helices. The binding site for the siderophores lies in the shallow cleft between these two domains, and several side chain residues form hydrogen bonds with each siderophore (Fig. 3). An overlay of the Cα backbone of FhuD from the gallichrome complex with the proteins in the other siderophore complexes gives root mean square deviations of 0.25 Å2 with the albomycin complex, 0.27 Å2 with the coprogen complex, and 0.20 Å2 with the Desferal complex.Figure 3A close-up stereo view of the residues involved in the binding site in the (a) albomycin, (b) coprogen, and (c) Desferal complexes. The albomycin is shown in green, coprogen isorange, and Desferal is blue. Important side-chain residues involved in hydrogen binding are labeled. These figures were drawn using Setor (37.Evans S.V. J. Mol. Graph. 1993; 11: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ligand binding site of FhuD is lined with hydrophobic residues, forming a depression large enough to accommodate the hydrophobic ornithyl linkers of each of the siderophores. Hydrogen bonds between several residues in the binding site and the siderophore also play a key role in stabilizing the complex. A comparison of the binding pockets in each of the complexes reveals significant differences in the positions of key ligand binding side chains, which alters the structural landscape of the binding pocket to accommodate the different ligands. When albomycin binds (Fig. 3a), the tri-δ-N-hydroxy-δ-N-acetyl-l-ornithine peptide, which coordinates the ferric iron, is found in a similar orientation to ferrichrome. The coordination geometry around the iron atom is slightly distorted from octahedral symmetry with distances ranging from 1.9 to 2.1 Å from the oxygen atoms to the metal ion. Three hydrogen bonds form between the protein and the ligand, with two between the terminal amino groups of Arg-84 and the hydroxamate moieties of the siderophore and another between the remaining hydroxamate to the hydroxyl group of Tyr-106, similar to the interactions found between gallichrome and FhuD. However, the water-mediated hydrogen bond present in gallichrome between the peptide backbone of the siderophore and the protein is not found in the albomycin complex. Aromatic residues lining the binding pocket are placed in a similar position to those in the gallichrome complex. Interestingly, no electron density is visible for the thioribosyl pyrimidine antibiotic group, which is covalently attached to the peptide portion of the siderophore by an amino acetyl linker. This suggests that this group is unencumbered by protein or lattice contacts and is free to move in the crystal structure. The binding mode of coprogen to FhuD is significantly different from the binding modes of gallichrome and albomycin (Fig. 3b). The iron atom is in a similar position relative to the protein, but the hydroxamate moieties are rotated ∼10 degrees from those of gallichrome. The oxygen atoms coordinating the iron atom are distorted from octahedral symmetry, with distances ranging from 1.98 to 2.05 Å. Within the iron center, one hydrogen bond is formed between the hydroxamate oxygen opposite to the diketopiperazine ring and the terminal amine of Arg-84. The hydroxyl group of Tyr-106 makes a hydrogen bond to the other hydroxamate oxygens on the side of the ring system, and a water-mediated hydrogen bond to Tyr-275 is formed with the remaining hydroxamate oxygen. In addition, water-mediated hydrogen bonds form between a nitroxyl oxygen of the coordinating group of the siderophore and an oxygen of the peptide backbone of the siderophore to Ser-219, which in turn hydrogen bonds to Asn-215. The positions of most of the hydrophobic residues within the binding site shift slightly, compared with the FhuD-gallichrome complex, but the most dramatic change in position involves the reorientation of Trp-217. This movement allows the trans-anhydromevalonic acid group to insert into the protein. The oxygen atom on the end of this group forms a hydrogen bond with Ser-103, as well as a water-mediated hydrogen bond to Trp-217 and the carbonyl of the peptide backbone of Ala-104, stabilizing the complex. Another hydrogen bond forms between Ser-103 and Glu-42, which bonds to the main-chain nitrogen of Leu-44 and has water-mediated hydrogen bonds to the side chain of Trp-273 and the carbonyl of the peptide bond of Tyr-275. The other trans-anhydromevalonic acid group is hydrogen-bonded to Asn-64 through a water molecule. Desferal binds to FhuD with the ferrioxamine portion of the drug enveloped by the binding site to a greater extent than the other siderophores (Fig. 3c). This may be due to the absence of bulky functional groups on the peptide backbone, so that the smaller size can be accommodated. Coordination of the iron atom is slightly distorted, with distances to the oxygen atoms ranging from 1.95 to 2.00 Å. One hydroxamate carbonyl oxygen is hydrogen-bonded to Arg-84, with the second hydroxamate carbonyl sharing a hydrogen bond with Tyr-106. Unlike the other siderophores, the third hydroxamate carbonyl oxygen does not appear to have any hydrogen bonds to FhuD. There are two additional hydrogen bonds to the peptide backbone of the ligand, one from a nitrogen to Tyr-275 and another from an oxygen via a water molecule to Asp-61. The orientation and position of the hydrophobic residues lining the binding pocket are similar to those in the gallichrome and albomycin complexes. The electron density for the mesylate (OSO2CH3) portion of the molecule is not present in this model, and it could be disordered in the crystal. An overlay of the binding site residues in each of the FhuD complexes shows that many of the side chains are in a similar position for siderophore binding, with the exception of Trp-217. With the exception of the coprogen complex, the shapes of the binding sites in the other complexes are very similar. The hydrogen bonds formed between each siderophore and the side chain residues of FhuD vary slightly in length and number (Fig. 4). In addition, not all of the hydrogen bonds are to similar oxygens of the iron-coordinating region of the siderophore. A compari"

A recent study suggested that the hsp90 C-terminal domain also binds ATP (Marcu, M. G., Chadli, A., Bouhouche, I., Catelli, M. G., and Neckers, L. M. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 37181–37186). In this paper, the interactions of ATP with native hsp90 and its recombinant N-terminal (positions 1–221) and C-terminal (positions 446–728) domains were studied by isothermal titration calorimetry, scanning differential calorimetry, and fluorescence spectroscopy. Results clearly demonstrate that hsp90 possesses a second ATP-binding site located on the C-terminal part of the protein. The association constant between this domain of hsp90 and ATP-Mg and a comparison with the binding constant on the full-length protein are reported for the first time. Secondary structure prediction revealed motifs compatible with a Rossmann fold in the C-terminal part of hsp90. It is proposed that this potential Rossmann fold may constitute the C-terminal ATP-binding site. This work also suggests allosteric interaction between N- and C-terminal domains of hsp90.

In contrast to the N terminus, the three-dimensional structure of the C-terminal domain of hsp90 is still unknown. This domain contains a second chaperone site, which has different polypeptide specificity from the N-terminal one (10.Scheibel T. Weikl T. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The mechanism of dimer formation has been proposed to take place through the duplicate anti-parallel interaction of fragments 542–615 and 629–731 (12.Nemoto T. Ohara-Nemoto Y. Ota M. Takagi T. Yokoyama K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). ATP binding and hydrolysis produce conformational changes that involve the entire hsp90 molecule, and the C-terminal region of hsp90 seems important for trapping the nucleotide during the ATPase cycle (15.Csermely P. Kajtar J. Hollosi M. Jalsovszky G. Holly S. Kahn C.R. Gergely Jr., P. Soti C. Mihaly K. Somogyi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1901-1907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Weikl T.

Moreover, a second ATP-binding site located in hsp90 C terminus was suggested through the use of ATP-Sepharose affinity chromatography (17.Marcu M.G. Chadli A. Bouhouche I. Catelli M.G. Neckers L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37181-37186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar); however, the association constant and stoichiometry of the complex with ATP were not determined. Thus, characterization of the C-terminal domain interaction with nucleotides is crucial to understand the hsp90 function. Therefore, we expressed C- and N-terminal domains separately and applied differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and fluorescence spectroscopy to directly prove that hsp90 contains a second ATP-binding site located in the C-terminal part of the protein and to determine the association constant for C-hsp90·ATP-Mg complex. Then we compared this value with the binding constant obtained for the full-length protein and hypothesized the localization of the second ATP-binding site.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREShsp90 Purification and Expression of N- and C-terminal DomainsThe 90-kDa heat shock protein was purified from porcine brain according to the method of Ref. 18.Yonezawa N. Nishida E. Sakai H. Koyasu S. Matsuzaki F. Iida K. Yahara I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 1-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, modified by Garnier et al. (19.Garnier C. Protasevich I. Gilli R.

Briand C. Peyrot V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2402-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). N-hsp90 (positions 1–221) and C-hsp90 domains were obtained by PCR amplification using a chicken hsp90 cDNA-bearing plasmid pSKB3 90 (13.Meng X. Devin J. Sullivan W.P. Toft D. Baulieu E.E. Catelli M.G. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1677-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and inserted into pET 15b and pET 28a expression vectors (Novagen) in frame with the N-terminal His tag, respectively. The constructs were verified by automated sequencing and transformed into Epicurean Coli Bl21-Gold (DE3) pLys Competent cells (Stratagene). Bacterial cells bearing the pET 15b and pET 28a constructs were grown overnight at 37 °C. The expression of fusion proteins was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C for N-hsp90 and overnight at 20 °C for C-hsp90. Subsequently, cells were lysed by French press in extraction buffer A1 (100 mm phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4); the lysate was clarified by ultracentrifugation at 30,000 ×g for 30 min. The recombinant proteins were purified by Hi-trap affinity column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted using a 0–250 mm imidazole gradient in A1 buffer. Fractions containing recombinant protein were pooled and concentrated using Amicon cells (Millipore Corp.). Concentrated proteins were desalted on a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences).All purified proteins were stored at −80 °C in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5. Protein concentration was determined by UV absorbance with extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 124,000, 51,100, and 16,350m−1 cm−1 for hsp90, C-terminal domain, and N-terminal domain, respectively. Extinction coefficients were calculated by the procedure of Gill and Von Hippel on the basis of the amino acid composition (19.Garnier C. Protasevich I. Gilli R. Tsvetkov P. Lobachov V. Peyrot V. Briand C. Makarov A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). All experiments were carried out in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5.Circular DichroismCD spectra of 12 μm hsp90 were acquired with a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter using a 0.01-cm cell at 25 °C. The instrument was calibrated between 180 and 350 nm with ammonium camphorsulfonate-d10 (Katayama Chemical, Jasco) as a standard. The results were expressed as molar ellipticity, [θ] (degrees cm2 dmol−1), considering an average amino acid residue mass of 111 Da. CD spectra were analyzed by four different methods currently available in the Dicroprot program (version 2.4 by G. Deleage; available on the World Wide Web at www.ibcp.fr/).Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)FTIR spectra of 80 μl of hsp90 (100 μm) were obtained with a resolution of 4 cm−1 using a MB100 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a deuterated triglycine sulfate detector (21.Millot J.M. Allam N. Manfait M. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1994; 295: 233-241Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Secondary structures content was calculated from Amide I and II bands using partial least-squares analysis as described in Ref. 22.Haaland D.M. Thomas E.V. Anal. Chem. 1988; 60: 1193-1202Crossref Scopus (2359) Google Scholar. This factor analysis requires a calibration set of proteins with known x-ray structures (21.Millot J.M. Allam N. Manfait M. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1994; 295: 233-241Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The first five loading vectors were used, and three types of secondary structures were characterized: α-helix, β-sheet, and undefined structures.hsp90 Cross-linking ExperimentsChemical cross-linking of hsp90 was performed using N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) (Sigma) as cross-linking reagent. The optimal EDC concentration determined by titration was equal to 1.5 mm. hsp90 (6 μm) was incubated 10 min at room temperature in the presence or absence of various concentrations of Mg2+, and the influence of ligands (3.5 × 10−4m GA and 5 mm ATP-Mg complex) on hsp90 cross-linking was tested. For cross-linking, 32 mm EDC stock solution was added (5% of hsp90 sample volume), and samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. To stop the cross-linking process, samples were diluted 3-fold with buffer (a 20-fold excess of amine containing buffer is enough to quench the reaction). Then samples were submitted to 4–15% gradient native PAGE using the PhastSystem apparatus (Amersham Biosciences). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.Differential Scanning CalorimetryMeasurements of hsp90 and its N- and C-terminal domain heat denaturation and influence of ATP-Mg or ATP alone on this process were carried out on a MicroCal VP-DSC instrument in 0.51 ml cells at a heating rate of 1 K/min. Protein concentration varied from 2.3 to 6 μm. The heating curves were corrected for the instrumental base line obtained by heating the solvent used for protein solution. The excess molar heat capacity of the protein (Cpexc) and denaturation temperature were determined as described elsewhere (23.Privalov P.L. Potekhin S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 4-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar), using molecular masses of 169,900 (20.Garnier C. Lafitte D. Jorgensen T.J. Jensen O.N. Briand C. Peyrot V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2402-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), 27,800, and 83,000 Da for hsp90 dimer, N-hsp90 monomer, and C-hsp90 dimer, respectively. The functions of excess heat capacity were analyzed using the MicroCal Origin software. The accuracy of denaturation temperatures was within 0.2 °C.Isothermal Titration CalorimetryBinding of ATP to hsp90 and C-hsp90 was carried out at 25 °C in three different conditions: in the presence of 5 mm free Mg2+, in the absence of added magnesium, and in the absence of added magnesium but in the presence of 1 mm EDTA, using a MicroCal MCS titration calorimeter. Enthalpy of binding (ΔH), and equilibrium constant (Ka) were obtained using the following procedure. 5–10-μl aliquots of ligands (2–4 × 10−3m) were injected from a 250-μl microsyringe into the 1.34-ml calorimeter cell containing protein solution (1.0–2.5 × 10−5m) to achieve a complete binding isotherm. The heat of dilution was measured by injecting the ligand into the buffer solution or by additional injections of ligand after saturation; the value obtained was subtracted from the heat of reaction to obtain effective heat of binding. Titration curves were fitted using the MicroCal Origin software, assuming a single class of site.FluorescenceRelative fluorescence was measured on a Perkin-Elmer LS 50 with slit widths of 5 and 10 nm. Fluorescence data were obtained using 0.2 cm (excitation direction) × 1 cm (emission direction) cells at 25 ± 0.5 °C. The excitation was done at 295 nm to specifically excite the hsp90 tryptophan residues and to minimize the ATP absorption. The measurements were carried out in the presence of 2 mm magnesium. Equilibrium difference fluorescence measurements were conducted at constant hsp90 concentration and increasing ATP concentration. The difference in fluorescence (ΔF) at 340 nm between hsp90 fluorescence and hsp90-ATP complex fluorescence (ΔF =Fhsp90 − Fcomplex) was plotted versus ATP concentrations. The inner filter was corrected, and the curve was fitted to the saturation curve equation by nonlinear least-squares regression analysis (24.Barbier P. Peyrot V. Sarrazin M. Rener G.A. Briand C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16821-16829Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Sequence Analysis and Predictive MethodsThe α- and β-hsp90 sequences available in SWISS-PROT data base were used for the multiple-sequence alignments. Location of sequence variation within aligned family members was determined by the PHD program as previously described (25.Sander C. Schneider R. Proteins. 1991; 9: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar). Predictions of secondary structure and solvent accessibility for pig and human hsp90α (HS9A_PIG, HS9A_HUMAN) and hsp90β (HS9B_HUMAN) were obtained from the PHD server (26.Rost B. Sander C. Schneider R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 53-60PubMed Google Scholar). The PHDsec method (27.Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2636) Google Scholar, 28.Rost B. Sander C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7558-7562Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 29.Rost B.

It has been reported to have the best predictive accuracy when only sequence information is available (31.Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1995; 23: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Predictions of the secondary structure through the amino acid sequences of HS9A_PIG, HS9A_HUMAN, and HS9B_HUMAN were also performed with the nnpredict program (32.McClelland J.L. Rumelhart D.E. Explorations in Parallel Distributed Processing. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1988: 318-362Google Scholar, 33.Kneller D.G. Cohen F.E. Langridge R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar).Sedimentation VelocitySedimentation velocity experiments were performed at 55,000 rpm in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with an AnTi 55 rotor and 12-mm aluminum double-sector centerpieces. Data were acquired in continuous mode at 280 or 230 nm depending on protein concentrations. The data were analyzed using the SVEDBERG (34.Philo J.S. Shuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation: Acquisition and Interpretation of Data for Biological and Synthetic Polymers Systems. Boston Birkhauser, Boston1994: 156-170Crossref Google Scholar) and dcdt (35.Stafford W.F. Shuster T.M. Laue T.M.

Boston Birkhauser, Boston1994: 119-137Crossref Google Scholar) computer programs.Sedimentation EquilibriumSedimentation equilibrium runs were performed at 20 °C at three loading concentrations and at three speeds in a six-channel centerpiece of charcoal-filled Epon. The protein gradients were detected at 280 nm. High speed sedimentation was conducted afterward for base-line correction. Data analysis was performed by global analysis of several data sets obtained at different loading concentrations at one speed using the program MULTEQ3B (36.Minton A.P. Shuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation: Acquisition and Interpretation of Data for Biological and Synthetic Polymers Systems. Boston Birkhauser, Boston1994: 119-137Crossref Google Scholar).RESULTSCharacterization of hsp90 and Its Recombinant DomainsTwo HSP90 fragments were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The amino-terminal domain (N-hsp90) was designed to end at residue 221, which includes the ATP-binding site (5.Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal domain (C-hsp90) started at position 446 to the end of the sequence. It included the recently suggested second ATP-binding site (17.Marcu M.G. Chadli A. Bouhouche I. Catelli M.G. Neckers L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37181-37186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The two proteins showed electrophoretic homogeneity in SDS-PAGE, with molecular masses of about 30 and 40 kDa, respectively. N-hsp90 eluted from size exclusion chromatography-HPLC with an apparent molecular mass of 28 kDa and a Stokes radius of 19.2 Å. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments at three loading concentrations and three speeds confirmed that N-hsp90 was monomeric. Global analysis of three concentrations at one speed using a single ideal species model converged to the value of 28.1 kDa, highly compatible with the theoretical molecular mass of the monomer (27.8 kDa). Velocity sedimentation experiments allowed the determination of a sedimentation coefficient at infinite dilution at 20 °C in water, s20,w4o of 2.42 ± 0.02 S. Analysis of C-hsp90 by native PAGE and size exclusion chromatography demonstrated that the C-hsp90 sample contained 30–40% dimers with an apparent molecular mass of 100 kDa and a Stokes radius of 41.7 Å and 60–70% of oligomers with apparent molecular masses ranging from 170 to 400 kDa and Stokes radii ranging from 41.7 to 60 Å. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments confirmed heterogeneity of C-hsp90 quaternary structures and indicated a polydisperse sample.The far-UV CD spectrum of the full-length hsp90 was analyzed by four different methods (see “Experimental Procedures”), and results are shown in Table I. The average values were as follows: 38% α-helix, 15% β-sheet, and 47% other structures. The component assignment of the deconvoluted spectra of the amide I and II infrared absorption bands of hsp90 by FTIR showed that hsp90 contained 44% α-helix, 17% β-sheet and 39% undefined structure. The PHD algorithm and the nnpredict program were used to create a picture of α-human hsp90 secondary structure content (Fig. 1, line PHDsec and line nnp, respectively). Prediction methods did not show significant differences between hsp90α and hsp90β (data not shown). In addition, the secondary structures content of the N-terminal subdomain (residues 12–223) obtained by predictive methods (PHDsec and nnpredict) and the secondary structure content deduced from x-ray three-dimensional structure (6.Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2), were highly similar with the exception of the first β−strand (residues 16–21) and the sixth α-helix (residues 129–135); all remaining structural elements predicted are present in the crystallographic structure. This indicates that the PHD method gave a good estimation of secondary structure, and it may be used for the entire protein (Fig. 1).Table Ihsp90 secondary structure contents obtained by CD, FTIR, and predictive methodsMethod of analysisα-Helixβ-StrandOther structuresCDaAverage of results obtained by the four methods.0.38 ± 0.050.15 ± 0.060.47 ± 0.03FTIR0.44 ± 0.020.17 ± 0.030.39 ± 0.03PHDsecbSee Refs. 27-30.0.45 (0.38)cThe content of secondary structure expected to have an accuracy better than 81.2%.0.15 (0.10)cThe content of secondary structure expected to have an accuracy better than 81.2%.0.38 (0.24)cThe content of secondary structure expected to have an accuracy better than 81.2%.nnpredictdSee Refs. 32 and 33.0.390.090.53a Average of results obtained by the four methods.b See Refs. 27.Rost B.

Protasevich I. Gilli R. Tsvetkov P. Lobachov V. Peyrot V. Briand C. Makarov A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). GA did not influence the cross-linkage profile observed in the presence or absence of Mg2+ (Fig. 3, lines A4 and B4). Contrary to GA, ATP inhibited the Mg2+-dependent oligomerization process (Fig. 3, line C2). Considering a binding constant of 2.2 × 104m−1(37.Romani A. Scarpa A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), in our experimental conditions about 90% of Mg2+ was bound to ATP, and only 0.5 mm Mg2+ was free (Fig. 3, gel C). To further raise the free Mg2+, the total Mg2+ concentration was increased to 10 mm, maintaining the same ATP concentration (5 mm) (Fig. 3, gel D). In these conditions and despite the presence of more than 5 mm free Mg2+, no hsp90 oligomerization process was observed (Fig. 3, lane D2). Thus, ATP inhibited hsp90 oligomerization induced by Mg2+ ions. Since GA does not influence the Mg2+-dependent oligomerization and ATP is known to compete with GA for the N-terminal ATP-binding site (5.Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W.

Considering the association constants of 7.6 × 103 and 2 × 106m−1 for ATP (5.Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H.

Fig. 3(lanes C3 and D3) demonstrates that GA did not reverse the inhibitory effect of ATP. Hence, ATP inhibited hsp90 oligomerization by binding to a site different from the N-terminal one, possibly located in the C terminus of the protein.Figure 3Effect of GA and ATP on the hsp90 Mg2+-dependent oligomerization process.

Here we demonstrate that phosphorylating the carboxyl termini of the β and γ subunits facilitates their interactions with the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 and inhibits channel activity. Three protein kinases, which phosphorylate the carboxyl termini of β and γENaC, have been identified by an in vitro assay. One of these phosphorylates βThr-613 and γThr-623, well-conserved C-tail threonines in the immediate vicinity of the PY motifs. Phosphorylation of γThr-623 has also been demonstrated in vivo in channels expressed inXenopus oocytes, and mutating βThr-613 and γThr-623 into alanine increased the channel activity by 3.5-fold. Effects of the above phosphorylations on interactions between ENaC and Nedd4 have been studied using surface plasmon resonance. Peptides having phospho-threonine at positions β613 or γ623 bind the WW domains of Nedd4 two to three times better than the non-phosphorylated analogues, due to higher association rate constants. Using a number of different approaches it was demonstrated that the protein kinase acting on βThr-613 and γThr-623 is the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK). It is suggested that an ERK-mediated phosphorylation of βThr-613 and γThr-623 down-regulates the channel by facilitating its interaction with Nedd4.

We have recently demonstrated phosphorylation of the carboxyl termini of ENaC subunits, expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins by crude cytosolic fractions (14.Chigaev A. Lu G.

The current study characterizes conserved residues phosphorylated in the carboxyl termini of ENaC subunits, explores their physiological role, and identifies the kinase involved. The data indicate that an extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent phosphorylation of βThr-613 and γThr-623 may be important in controlling interactions between the channel and Nedd4. The carboxyl termini of the rat β and γENaC (β 557–638 and γ 564–650) were subcloned downstream GST in the bacterial expression vector pGEX3X as described in a previous study (14.Chigaev A. Lu G. Shi H.-K. Asher C. Xu R. Latter H. Seger R. Garty H. Reuveny E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F1030-F1036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA constructs expressing fusion proteins between GST and the three WW domains of rat Nedd4 were kindly provided by D. Rotin (Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada) and are described in a previous study (5.Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. Ishikawa T. Mcglade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were expressed in a protease-deficient Escherichia coli strain and purified on glutathione beads as detailed previously (14.Chigaev A. Lu G. Shi H.-K. Asher C. Xu R. Latter H. Seger R. Garty H. Reuveny E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F1030-F1036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Functional expression in Xenopus oocytes was done using ENaC clones in pSPORT-1, obtained from B. C. Rossier (Institute of Pharmacology, University of Lausanne). Immunoprecipitation of phosphorylated ENaC was performed using a hemagglutinin A (HA)-tagged β and γ construct kindly provided by B. Schwappach (Zentrum für Molekulare Biologie, Universität Heidelberg). The HA epitope was introduced in the ecto domains of these subunits at a position shown before not to affect channel activity (15.Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Point mutations in the various constructs were introduced using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit and verified by sequencing. Cytosol was extracted from rat distal colon and fractionated by ion exchange chromatography using the following protocol. Rats (Wistar, 9–11 weeks old) were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The distal colon was excised, cut open, and rinsed first in phosphate-buffered saline and then in buffer A composed of: 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.3, 1.5 mm EGTA, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm de-aerated sodium orthovanadate (16.Ahn N.G. Weiel J.E. Chan C.P. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11487-11494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The epithelial cells were scraped off the connective tissue using a glass slide and suspended in buffer A + a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 mmbenzamidine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2.0 μg/ml pepstatin-A). Cells were washed by centrifugation and then disrupted on ice by sonication (3 × 5 s). Cell homogenates were centrifuged for 30 min at 30,000 × g, and the supernatants were collected and further fractionated by ion exchange chromatography. 10 mg of protein in 50 ml of buffer A was loaded onto a MonoQ column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) at a rate of 1 ml/min. Bound proteins were eluted at the same rate by a linear NaCl gradient (0–30%) in buffer A. Ninety 1-ml fractions were collected, stored at 4 °C, and assayed for kinase activity within 24 h. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with the human insulin receptor were kindly provided by Dr. Yehiel Zick (Department of Molecular Cell Biology, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel). Cells were cultivated in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and F12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% glutamine. After achieving 80% confluency, the medium was replaced by serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for a period of 24–36 h. Serum-depleted cells were incubated with 100 nm insulin for 5–120 min in the presence and absence of various inhibitors. They were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and suspended in buffer A + protease inhibitors. Cells were disrupted by 7-s sonication on ice. The homogenates were centrifuged for 60 min at 15,000 × g, and the supernatants were collected. Rat colon cytosol MonoQ fractions, whole CHO cytosol, and purified activated ERK2 were used in an in vitro phosphorylation assay of GST-ENaC fusion proteins. The fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and suspended in buffer A. Aliquots of 47 μl were mixed with 50-μl volumes of cytosolic fractions, whole cytosol (∼1 mg/ml protein), or purified ERK2 (1.5 ng/ml, specific activity of 0.45 mmol/min/mg), all in buffer A. Phosphorylation was initiated by the addition of 3 μl of ATP mixture composed of: 1.8 μl of 1 m MgCl2, 0.9 μl of 0.2 mm ATP, and 0.3 μl of [32P]ATP (10 mCi/ml, 3000 Ci/mmol). Suspensions were shaken for 30 min at 30 °C, pelleted, and washed several times in HB1B buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.7, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 25 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% Triton X-100). Pellets were suspended in Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE, and exposed to a PhosphorImager plate and/or x-ray film. Specific binding of cytosolic kinases to ENaC C-tail fusion proteins was determined by co-precipitation, as described previously (17.Rubinfeld H. Seger R. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc, New York1998Google Scholar). In brief, fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione beads were incubated with either cytosolic fractions or purified kinases for 2 h. at 4 °C. Incubation was done in a binding buffer composed of 150 mm NaCl, 22 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.075% Triton X-100, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmsodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors. The beads were sedimented and washed twice in HB1B buffer, a third wash in buffer A, and a final wash in a kinase assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Beads were suspended in 30-μl volumes of the above kinase assay buffer, and phosphorylation was initiated by the addition of 2 μm ATP plus 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. 30-μl aliquots of rat colon MonoQ fractions or whole CHO-T cytosol were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and blocked with 5% low fat milk. Samples were probed with either anti-ERK (1:20,000) or anti-phospho ERK (1:5000). Both anti-ERK antibodies were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Fine Chemicals. Blots were overlaid with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad, 1:10,000), and binding was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Binding of the WW domains of Nedd4 to β and γ PY peptides was monitored by surface plasmon resonance in a BIAcore 2000 sensor, as described previously (18.Asher C. Chigaev A. Garty H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1228-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In brief, peptides serving as substrates were immobilized on the sensor chip (SA, BIAcore, Uppsala Sweden) through amino termini biotin residues. In each chip, the peptides to be compared were immobilized on two of the channels. Free biotin and γ peptide carrying the mutationY628A were immobilized on the other two channels and served as negative controls. The three WW domains of rat Nedd4 were expressed as GST fusion proteins and used as analytes. They were suspended in HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% P20) and injected at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Binding was monitored simultaneously in all four channels for at least 4 min and terminated by the application of HBS buffer without analyte (dissociation phase). The chip was regenerated by a subsequent injection of 10 μl of HBS + 0.05% SDS and extensively washed in HBS, and then the next analyte was applied. Each observation was confirmed by at least three measurements in two different chips. The ENaC-mediated Na+ current was determined in the oocyte expression system as described before (8.Shigaev A. Asher C. Latter H. Garty H. Reuveny E. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F613-F619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Chigaev A. Lu G. Shi H.-K. Asher C. Xu R. Latter H. Seger R. Garty H. Reuveny E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F1030-F1036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, stage V–VI oocytes were injected with cRNA mixtures containing 2.5 ng of each of the ENaC subunits. Oocytes were incubated at 17 °C in a medium that contained 96 mm NaCl and 10 μmamiloride. Electrophysiological measurements were performed 48–72 h later by means of a two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Channel activity was determined as the amiloride-sensitive current amplitudes monitored at −100 mV. Phosphorylation was examined in oocytes injected with cRNA mixtures in which either β or γ were HA-tagged. Groups of ∼40 ENaC-expressing oocytes were incubated for 4 h with 3.3 mCi of orthophosphate (32Pi). A mixture of orthovanadate (0.5 mm) and H2O2 (1 mm) was added in the last 60 min of the incubation to stimulate endogenous kinases. Another aliquot of ∼40 injected oocytes was metabolically labeled by a 2-day incubation with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine. Oocytes labeled with 32P or35S were washed and homogenized in buffer A + protease inhibitors, and membranes were isolated by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion. Membranes were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 in buffer A and centrifuged for 5 min at 11,000 × g to remove insoluble material. Aliquots of ∼200 μl of detergent-soluble membrane protein extracts were incubated for 12–16 h at 4 °C with 2 μg of a mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (clone 12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and then for another 2 h with protein A-Sepharose beads. The beads were sedimented, washed twice in buffer A + 0.1% Triton X-100, and a third time in buffer A + 0.5 mLiCl. Immunopellets were suspended in SDS sample buffer, resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE, and assayed for radioactivity. Cytosol extracted from rat distal colon has been used to identify protein kinases capable of phosphorylating ENaC subunits. The colonic tissue was selected, because it is relatively homogenous and has high Na+ channel abundance. Proteins were fractionated on a MonoQ column, and fractions were tested for their ability to phosphorylate fusion proteins having the carboxyl termini of γ ENaC. Fig. 1 depicts a typical assay demonstrating the existence of at least three protein kinase-enriched fractions phosphorylating GST-γ. The first peak of protein kinase activity was eluted around fractions 38–41 (∼0.07–0.09m NaCl) and is characterized in this study. A second peak, seen around fraction 59 (∼0.19 m NaCl), was found to phosphorylate residue γThr-630 (data not shown). Hence, it is likely to be the same kinase detected in a crude DE-52 fraction reported before (14.Chigaev A. Lu G. Shi H.-K. Asher C. Xu R. Latter H. Seger R. Garty H. Reuveny E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F1030-F1036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A third, major peak was seen around fractions 74–77 (∼0.25–0.27 m NaCl) and will be described elsewhere. Initial experiments have used mutagenesis to identify ENaC residues phosphorylated by the kinase eluted around fraction 40. Phosphorylation of GST-γ appeared to be on Thr-623, and mutating this site to Ala residue completely inhibited incorporation of 32P into this fusion protein (Fig. 2A). Mutating γThr-630, another residue found to be phosphorylated by crude cytosol, had no effect. Cytosolic fractions 38–41 phosphorylated GST-β as well. In this case, however, mutating the β residue analogous to γThr-623 (βThr-613) into an Ala residue had only a minor effect on the incorporation of 32P into this fusion protein (not shown). This may be due to the phosphorylation of additional residues on the carboxyl tail of β. Phosphorylation of βThr-613 could be convincingly shown in subsequent experiments using purified kinase and cytosol from CHO cells. It was further demonstrated that the protein kinase eluted in fraction 40 tightly binds to the γ C-tail and can be co-precipitated with it. In this assay, GST-γ immobilized on glutathione beads was incubated with the above cytosolic fraction in the absence of ATP. The beads were washed several times and then incubated with [γ-32P]ATP with no added protein kinases. Substantial phosphorylation of the fusion protein can take place under these conditions only if some of the kinase is precipitated with its substrate. As shown in Fig. 2B, GST-γ could be effectively phosphorylated following such co-precipitation, and the phosphorylation occurred on Thr-623. Next, it was determined that the above phosphorylation takes place also in Xenopus oocytes expressing the three ENaC subunits. Accordingly, HA-tagged wild type and mutated subunits were translated in the oocyte system and metabolically labeled with either [35S]methionine or 32Pi. Orthovanadate and H2O2 were added during the incubation with 32P to achieve activation of endogenous protein kinases. Immunoprecipitation of HA-tagged β and γ demonstrated phosphorylation of both subunits (Fig. 3A). Mutating γThr-623 into an Ala residue significantly decreased incorporation of 32P into this subunit without affecting labeling by [35S]methionine. In three different experiments using ∼40 oocytes each, the mutation of Thr-623 lowered the32P/35S ratio of the immunoprecipitated subunit by 47 ± 15%. Thus, Thr-623 is one of the γ residues phosphorylated in the oocyte system. Phosphorylation of the β subunit on the other hand, was not significantly affected by mutating Thr-613 into Ala. Thus, this residue is either not phosphorylated in oocytes or its phosphorylation is masked by 32P incorporation into other residues. This may be similar to the phenomenon described above where mutating βThr-613 into Ala had a minor effect on the overall β phosphorylation by fractionated cytosol, even though it is clearly one of the phosphorylated residues (see subsequent experiments in CHO-T cells). Expressing the double mutant βT613A/γT623A in oocytes resulted in macroscopic Na+ currents that were 3.5-fold higher than that evoked by the wild type channel (Fig. 3B). Mutating the same residues into glutamic acid had a smaller but nevertheless significant stimulatory effect. Thus, γThr-623 and/or βThr-613 have a functional role and their mutation largely activates the channel. However, because mutation to a neutral or negatively charged amino acid evoked the same response, it is not certain that this activation is due to the inability to phosphorylate threonine 613/623. γThr-623 and βThr-613 are well-conserved residues located immediately before the PY motifs (Fig. 2C). Their phosphorylation could affect the channel by altering its interaction with Nedd4. Assessment of such a mechanism has been done by determining association of the WW regions of Nedd4 with phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated PY peptides using BIAcore (18.Asher C. Chigaev A. Garty H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1228-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Accordingly, various β and γ peptides, listed in Table I, were synthesized and attached to streptavidin-coated sensor chips via an amino-terminal biotin moiety. The three WW domains of rat Nedd4, expressed as GST fusion proteins, were passed over the chip and binding was recorded as a change in refractive index. A typical sensogram-monitoring interactions of WW2 to γPY peptides is illustrated in Fig. 4A. Binding of the recombinant protein to the phosphorylated peptide (γ pThr-623) was 2- to 3-fold higher than that recorded for the non-phosphorylated analogue (γ). No significant binding was observed with a peptide carrying a point mutation that impairs Nedd4-ENaC interactions (γ Y628A), or to free biotin. The small rapid signal seen in these channels is probably due to bulk or nonspecific effects. Therefore, in all subsequent experiments the signal obtained in the biotin channel was subtracted from readings in other channels to obtain ENaC-specific signals. We have also tested a γ peptide with phospho-threonine at position 630, shown to be phosphorylated by another cytosolic fraction (14.Chigaev A. Lu G. Shi H.-K. Asher C. Xu R. Latter H. Seger R. Garty H. Reuveny E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F1030-F1036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This peptide (γ pThr-630) appeared to bind WW2 at a rate that was close to that of the wild type peptide (Fig. 4B).Table IENaC peptides used to study WW bindingPeptide sequenceSpecificationsI P G T P P P N Y D S L R L QβPY peptideI P G pT P P P N Y D S L R L QβPY peptide with pThr-613V P G T P P P R Y N T L R L DγPY peptideV P G pT P P P R Y N T L R L DγPY peptide with pThr-623V P G T P P P R Y N pT L R L DγPY peptide with pThr-630V P G T P P P R A N T L R L DγPY peptide with Y628A Open table in a new tab The above protocol was repeated for different concentrations of all three WW domains using both β and γ peptides (Fig. 5). All three WW domains were found to bind better to PY peptides that have phospho-threonine at position β613 or γ623. The experiment of Fig. 5 also confirms a previous observation that WW2 and WW3 bind PY sequences much better than WW1 (19.Farr T.J. Coddington-Lawson S.J. Snyder P.M. McDonald F.J. Biochem.

In this experiment the WW3 fusion protein was preincubated in solution with different non-biotinylated peptides, and then applied to the sensor chip. The competing soluble peptide largely inhibited association of WW3 with the immobilized peptide, and phospho-peptides were more effective competitors then the non-phosphorylated analogues. This result was observed irrespective of the immobilized substrate (β or γ) or analyte (WW2 or WW3, data not shown). It demonstrates that the phosphorylated peptides better associate with the WW fusion proteins also in solution; i.e. it rules out the possibility that their larger binding reflects differences in peptide immobilization or packing on the chip.Figure 6Competition of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptides. Aliquots of WW3 (0.6 μm) were preincubated with either diluent or different peptides (250 μg/ml). The mixtures were applied onto the sensor chip, and binding to phosphorylated β peptide was monitored.

Data are presented as fraction of WW3 binding in the absence of competing peptide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although the above data clearly show effects of phosphorylation on the interactions between WW proteins and PY peptides, kinetic analysis of these effects was not trivial. As reported previously, the association could not be well fitted to simple 1:1 Langmuir binding and a considerable fraction of the response was attributed to a very slow and non-saturable component (18.Asher C. Chigaev A. Garty H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1228-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This phase was preceded by a faster saturable component that was particularly noticeable at high concentrations of the analytes. This phenomenon was independent of the flow rate (20–75 μl/min) and hence not likely to reflect mass transfer effects. Data could in principle be fitted to a sum of two exponents, but the fit was satisfactory only for the interaction of β and β pThr-613 with WW3. In this case, the faster event had the characteristics of a simple 1:1 binding and its apparent association rate constants (ks) showed the expected linear dependence on the analyte concentration (Fig. 7). The dissociation rate constants (kd) were concentration independent. The kinetics parameters extracted from this analysis, and the equilibrium constants calculated as ratios of the association and dissociation rate constants, are summarized in Table II. The phospho-β peptide was found to have ∼4-fold higher affinity toward WW3, due to an increased association rate constant. The second, slower phase could not be analyzed kinetically, but this component too was markedly affected by phosphorylation.Table IIKinetic parameters of the interaction between WW3 and β peptidesAnalytesubstratekakdKDm−1×s−1s−1μmWW3β pT6132.3 × 1040.026 ± 0.0101.1WW3β0.5 × 1040.021 ± 0.0034.2The association rate constants (ka) were calculated from slopes of the best-fitted lines from plots of ks versus the analyte concentration (Fig. 7, r<0.99).

Next, we studied the identity of the cytosolic kinase eluted in fraction 40, which phosphorylates γThr-623. The presence of multiple proline residues near the phosphorylation site suggested involvement of a proline-directed kinase, e.g. a member of the MAPK family such as ERK, p38, or"

However, it is not known whether and how this stargazin-mediated synaptic targeting of AMPARs is regulated. Stargazin interacts with the PDZ domains of PSD-95 through the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif. The stargazin C terminus contains a consensus sequence for phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). Phosphorylation site-specific stargazin antibodies reveal that the stargazin C terminus is phosphorylated at the Thr-321 residue in heterologous cells and in vivo. Stargazin phosphorylation is enhanced by the catalytic subunit of PKA. Mutations mimicking stargazin phosphorylation (T321E and T321D) lead to elimination of yeast two-hybrid interactions, in vitro coimmunoprecipitation, and coclustering between stargazin and PSD-95. Phosphorylated stargazin shows a selective loss of coimmunoprecipitation with PSD-95 in heterologous cells and limited enrichment in postsynaptic density fractions of rat brain.

Bao S. Hefti F. Thompson R.F. Knusel B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6990-6999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), probably because of a cerebellar malfunction. Both mRNA and protein levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor are selectively reduced in cerebellar granule cells of stargazer mice (5.Qiao X. Chen L. Gao H. Bao S. Hefti F. Thompson R.F.

Stargazin, a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 36 kDa, contains four putative transmembrane domains and a cytosolic C terminus, and its primary structure is closely related to that of the γ subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels (7.Klugbauer N.

AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate) glutamate receptor amino acid(s) protein kinase A postsynaptic density enhanced green fluorescent protein The functional association between stargazin and AMPAR was initially ascertained by the observation that postsynaptic AMPAR currents are selectively impaired in cerebellar granule cells of stargazer mice (13.Hashimoto K. Fukaya M. Qiao X. Sakimura K. Watanabe M. Kano M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6027-6036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A subsequent study revealed that stargazin mediates synaptic targeting of AMPARs by two distinct mechanisms (14.Chen L. Chetkovich D.M. Petralia R.S. Sweeney N.T. Kawasaki Y. Wenthold R.J. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Nature. 2000; 408: 936-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Stargazin initially interacts with AMPARs and assists their translocation to the extrasynaptic surface membrane. Next, the AMPAR-stargazin complex is targeted to synaptic sites by binding to PSD-95 and related PDZ proteins. In support of this hypothesis, a stargazin mutant lacking the last four residues (stargazinΔC) rescues extrasynaptic but not synaptic AMPAR currents in cerebellar granule cells of stargazer mice (14.Chen L. Chetkovich D.M. Petralia R.S. Sweeney N.T. Kawasaki Y. Wenthold R.J. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Nature. 2000; 408: 936-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, little is known about whether the stargazin-mediated synaptic targeting of AMPARs is regulated and, if so, what these regulatory mechanisms involve. The C terminus of stargazin contains the end sequence RRTTPV, which belongs to the class I PDZ-binding motif, (S/T) XV (S/T, Ser or Thr; X, any aa residue; V, hydrophobic residue) (15.Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 16.Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 17.Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the RRTT sequence of the C terminus additionally corresponds to the consensus sequence for phosphorylation by PKA, (R/K)(R/X) X(S/T), suggesting that Thr at the −2 position (RRTTPV, designated T321) is phosphorylated by PKA. The crystal structure of the PDZ3 domain of PSD-95 (class I) complexed with the C terminus of CRIPT, a PSD-95-binding protein that ends with the QTSV sequence (18.Niethammer M. Valtschanoff J.G. Kapoor T.M. Allison D.W. Weinberg T.M. Craig A.M. Sheng M. Neuron. 1998; 20: 693-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), reveals that the Thr residue at the −2 position interacts with His-372 of PDZ3 (15.Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Specifically, the hydroxyl oxygen of the Thr forms a hydrogen bond with the N-3 nitrogen of His-372. Therefore, phosphorylation of T321 at the stargazin C terminus may weaken the interaction between stargazin and the PDZ domains of PSD-95. Consistently, earlier data demonstrate that phosphorylation of the Ser residue at the −2 position of Kir2.3 (an inward rectifier potassium channel) by PKA disrupts interactions with PSD-95 (19.Cohen N.A. Brenman J.E. Snyder S.H. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 759-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Here we report that PKA phosphorylates the stargazin C terminus and consequently regulates its interaction with PSD-95. In view of the hypothesis that stargazin regulates synaptic targeting of AMPARs by binding to PSD-95 and related PDZ proteins, our results suggest that phosphorylation of the C terminus of stargazin regulates AMPAR synaptic targeting. Anti-fusion protein stargazin antibody (Stg-Cyto 1222, guinea pig polyclonal) was generated using an H6 fusion protein containing two copies of the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of stargazin (aa 203–323) as immunogen. Anti-peptide stargazin antibody (Stg-C-term 1217, rabbit polyclonal) was generated using a synthetic peptide mimicking the last 10 aa residues of stargazin (CNTANRRTTPV). The underlined cysteine residue was added for coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanin or the SulfoLink column (Pierce). Affinity purification of antibodies was performed using the SulfoLink column coupled with the peptides. To generate phosphorylation site-specific stargazin antibodies (Stg-pT321 1218 rabbit and 1229 guinea pig polyclonal), the same synthetic stargazin C-terminal peptide with phosphorylated T321 was employed as immunogen. For affinity purification of the Stg-pT321 antibody, antisera were passed through the SulfoLink column coupled with the phophorylated peptide followed by a column coupled with unphosphorylated C-terminal peptide as described previously (20.Mammen A.L. Kameyama K. Roche K.W. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32528-32533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal EGFP (1167) and PSD-95 (SM55) antibodies were generated using H6-EGFP (aa 1–240) and H6-PSD-95 (aa 77–299) (21.Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar) as immunogens. The PSD-95 (HM319) antibody is described in the literature (21.Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). The yeast two-hybrid assay was performed as described earlier (21.Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). The L40 yeast strain harboring reporter genes HIS3 and LacZ, under control of the upstream LexA DNA-binding domain was used in the assay. For pBHA (a bait vector containing the LexA DNA-binding domain) constructs, the last 121 aa residues (aa 203–323) of stargazin were amplified by PCR and subcloned in-frame into pBHA. Mutant pBHA stargazin constructs (RRTDPV, RRTEPV, and RRTTPA) were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For pGAD10 constructs, the following PDZ domains were subcloned in-frame into pGAD10 (a prey vector, CLONTECH): PDZ1 (aa 224–311), PDZ2 (aa 318–404), PDZ3 (aa 465–545), and PDZ1–2 (aa 224–404) of SAP97; PDZ 4–6 (aa 463–761) of GRIP1. pGAD10 constructs containing the PDZ domains of PSD-95 are described (21.Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Stargazin-PDZ interactions were measured by semiquantitative yeast two-hybrid assays using his3 and lacZ as reporter genes. The entire open reading frame and 75 bp of the 5′ untranslated region of stargazin were amplified by RT-PCR using mouse brain total RNA, digested with HindIII and EcoRI, and subcloned into GW1 (British Biotechnology). For EGFP tagging of stargazin (EGFP-stargazin), a fragment containing EGFP (aa 1–240) was amplified by PCR and subcloned in-frame into the BglII site at the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of stargazin, thus generating a construct containing EGFP between aa 269 and 270 of the protein. Mutant stargazin expression constructs with RRTDPV, RRTEPV and RRTTPA at the C-terminal end were generated using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) with GW1 EGFP-stargazin as template. GW1 PSD-95 is described in the literature (21.Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, COS cells were transfected with combinations of PSD-95, EGFP-stargazin (wild-type and mutants) and the PKA catalytic subunit using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), extracted with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, incubated with PSD-95 (HM319) antibodies (4 μg/ml), and precipitated with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), followed by immunoblotting with EGFP (1 μg/ml), Stg-pT321 (1218, 1 μg/ml), or PSD-95 (SM55, 1 μg/ml) antibodies. The coclustering assay was performed as described earlier (22.Kim E. Naisbitt S. Hsueh Y.P. Rao A. Rothschild A. Craig A.M. Sheng M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-7 cells doubly transfected with GW1 PSD-95 and stargazin (wild-type and mutants) were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with EGFP (1167) and PSD-95 (HM319) antibodies followed by double immunofluorescence staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate- and Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Images were captured by confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM510, Zeiss). PSD fractions were purified as described (23.Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 24.Cho K.O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). To obtain PSD fractions, the synaptosomal fraction was extracted with detergents, once with Triton X-100 (PSD I), twice with Triton X-100 (PSD II), once with Triton X-100, and once with sarcosyl (PSD III). PSD fractions were immunoblotted with Stg-pT321 (1229, 1 μg/ml), Stg-Cyto (1222, 1 μg/ml), Stg-C-term (1217, 1 μg/ml), PSD-95 (SM55, 1 μg/ml), and synaptophysin (Sigma, 1:1000) antibodies. To determine whether the T321 residue of stargazin is the phosphorylation site, we generated phosphorylation site-specific (termed Stg-pT321) antibodies (1218 rabbit and 1229 guinea pig) using the last 10 residues of stargazin with phosphorylated T321 as immunogen. Stg-pT321 antibodies were tested against stargazin expressed in heterologous cells (Fig. 1). Immunoblotting of COS cell lysates transfected with EGFP-tagged stargazin (EGFP-stargazin) with Stg-pT321 antibodies revealed a single protein band of about 66 kDa (38 kDa stargazin + 28 kDa EGFP) (Fig. 1A). In contrast, mutant stargazin (T321A) lacking the hydroxyl group for phosphorylation was not detected by Stg-pT321 antibodies (Fig. 1A). Preincubation of Stg-pT321 antibodies with excess free phosphorylated (but not unphosphorylated) peptide prevented the recognition of EGFP-stargazin (wild-type) (Fig. 1B). Moreover, pretreatment of the membrane with λ-phosphatase abolished recognition of the EGFP-stargazin (wild-type) by Stg-pT321 antibodies (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that stargazin is phosphorylated at T321 in heterologous cells. To examine whether T321 of stargazin is phosphorylated in vivo, we performed immunoblotting analyses on protein samples from rat brain with various stargazin antibodies (Fig. 2). Both Stg-pT321 antibodies (1218 and 1229) recognized a major band of about 38 kDa corresponding to the size of reported stargazin (4.Letts V.A. Felix R. Biddlecome G.H. Arikkath J. Mahaffey C.L. Valenzuela A. Bartlett 2nd, F.S. Mori Y. Campbell K.P. Frankel W.N. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) in crude synaptosomal (P2) and small membrane (S2) fractions. Similarly sized stargazin bands were detected by additional stargazin antibodies raised against the C-terminal peptide (the last 10 residues with unphosphorylated T321, Stg-C-term) and the entire C-terminal cytoplasmic region (aa 203–323; Stg-Cyto). Our data indicate that stargazin is phosphorylated at the T321 residue in vivo. It is possible that Stg-pT321 and Stg-C-term antibodies may recognize closely related proteins such as the γ-3 and γ-4 subunits of voltage-dependent calcium channels (7.Klugbauer N. Dai S. Specht V. Lacinova L. Marais E. Bohn G. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 8.Burgess D.L. Davis C.F. Gefrides L.A. Noebels J.L. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 1204-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 10.Burgess D.L. Gefrides L.A. Foreman P.J. Noebels J.L. Genomics. 2001; 71: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), because they have similar C-terminal sequences (the last 7 residues are identical) and calculated molecular masses (stargazin, 35.9 kDa; γ-3, 35.6 kDa; γ-4, 36.5 kDa in mice). To determine whether the stargazin C terminus is a substrate of PKA, we examined phosphorylation levels of this region of stargazin in COS cells doubly transfected with stargazin and the PKA catalytic subunit (wild-type and an inactive mutant) (Fig. 3). When COS cells singly transfected with stargazin were immunoblotted with Stg-pT321 antibodies, a relatively small but significant amount of phosphorylated stargazin was detected, suggesting that stargazin is basally phosphorylated in COS cells (Fig. 3). Stargazin phosphorylation was markedly increased upon coexpression with the PKA catalytic subunit but not with an inactive catalytic subunit (25.Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6870-6873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). These results indicate that PKA phosphorylates the C terminus of stargazin at T321. To investigate whether phosphorylation of T321 of stargazin affects its binding to PSD-95, we generated two mutations mimicking the PKA-phosphorylated state of the protein (RRTDPV and RRTEPV; mutations are underlined). When these stargazin mutations were tested for their interactions with the PDZ domains of PSD-95 and SAP97 in the yeast two-hybrid assay, neither mutant bound PSD-95 or SAP97 (Fig. 4). In control experiments, the wild-type stargazin C terminus specifically interacted with the PDZ domains of PSD-95 and SAP97 but not with unrelated PDZ domains of GRIP1, an AMPAR-interacting multi-PDZ protein (26.Dong H. RJ O.B. Fung E.T. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1997; 386: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). Additional mutant stargazin (RRTTPA) lost the ability to bind both PSD-95 and SAP97, indicating that the C terminus of stargazin specifically interacts with the PDZ domains of the PSD-95 family members. These findings demonstrate that the stargazin mutations mimicking T321 phosphorylation disrupt interactions with members of the PSD-95 family. As an independent test of the effects of stargazin mutations on the stargazin-PSD-95 interaction, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments on COS cell lysates doubly transfected with EGFP-stargazin (wild-type and mutants) and PSD-95 (Fig. 5). PSD-95 antibodies pulled down, in addition to their cognate antigen PSD-95, wild-type stargazin (RRTTPV) but none of the mutant stargazins tested (RRTDPV, RRTEPV, and RRTTPA) (Fig. 5). In control immunoprecipitation, singly transfected stargazin (wild-type) was not brought down by PSD-95 antibodies (Fig. 5). These results indicate that stargazin mutations mimicking T321 phosphorylation disrupt the biochemical association between stargazin and PSD-95 in heterologous cells. Coexpression of stargazin and PSD-95 in heterologous cells results in the formation of clusters where the two proteins colocalize (14.Chen L. Chetkovich D.M. Petralia R.S. Sweeney N.T. Kawasaki Y. Wenthold R.J. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Nature. 2000; 408: 936-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We examined the effects of stargazin mutations on the coclustering between stargazin and PSD-95 (Fig. 6). Wild-type EGFP-stargazin when coexpressed with PSD-95 in COS cells formed clusters in which both proteins colocalized (Fig. 6A), consistent with previous results (14.Chen L. Chetkovich D.M. Petralia R.S. Sweeney N.T. Kawasaki Y. Wenthold R.J. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Nature. 2000; 408: 936-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, none of the stargazin mutants (RRTDPV, RRTEPV and RRTTPA) formed typical clusters on coexpression, and both proteins were diffusely distributed throughout the cells (Fig. 6, B–D). These data suggest that T321 phosphorylation of stargazin regulates the interaction between stargazin and PSD-95, in agreement with the yeast two-hybrid results. To investigate whether phosphorylation of stargazin reduces its interaction with PSD-95, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments with COS cells triply transfected with stargazin (wild-type), PSD-95, and the PKA catalytic subunit (Fig. 7). Immunoprecipitation of COS cell lysates with PSD-95 antibodies did not bring down any detectable amount of phosphorylated stargazin, as visualized by Stg-pT321 antibodies (Fig. 7, top panel). In contrast, PSD-95 antibodies brought down a significant amount of total stargazin, as revealed by EGFP antibodies (Fig. 7, middle panel), suggesting that unphosphorylated stargazin retains the ability to coimmunoprecipitate with the PSD-95. These findings further confirm that phosphorylation of stargazin at the C-terminal T321 residue inhibits its interaction with PSD-95. Stargazin is enriched in detergent-insoluble PSD fractions along with AMPAR subunits and PSD-95 (14.Chen L. Chetkovich D.M. Petralia R.S. Sweeney N.T. Kawasaki Y. Wenthold R.J. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Nature. 2000; 408: 936-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To test whether phosphorylated stargazin shows an altered enrichment in the PSD, we performed immunoblot analysis on PSD fractions of rat brain (Fig. 8). Stg-pT321 antibodies revealed that phosphorylated stargazin is minimally enriched in PSD fractions. In particular, phosphorylated stargazin was not detectable in the PSD III fraction, a core of the PSD extracted with Triton X-100 and sarcosyl detergents. In contrast, Stg-Cyto and Stg-C-term antibodies showed a significant enrichment of total stargazin in all PSD fractions. These results indicate that phosphorylated stargazin is less tightly associated with the PSD. Our results demonstrate that phosphorylation of stargazin at T321 by PKA inhibits its interaction with PSD-95. The C-terminal sequence of stargazin (NRRTTPV) is identical or similar to those in other closely related γ-subunits of voltage-dependent calcium channels (NRRTTPV in γ-3 and γ-4 and NRKTTPV in γ-8) that are expressed in the brain (7.Klugbauer N. Dai S. Specht V. Lacinova L. Marais E. Bohn G. Hofmann F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 8.Burgess D.L. Davis C.F. Gefrides L.A. Noebels J.L. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 1204-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 10.Burgess D.L. Gefrides L.A. Foreman P.J. Noebels J.L. Genomics. 2001; 71: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), suggesting similar interactions with PSD-95 and phosphorylation by PKA. Conversely, stargazin interacts with all known members of the PSD-95 family (Fig. 4) (14.Chen L. Chetkovich D.M. Petralia R.S. Sweeney N.T. Kawasaki Y. Wenthold R.J. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Nature. 2000; 408: 936-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), which display diverse distribution patterns in the brain (16.Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the PKA-dependent phosphorylation of stargazin at T321 regulates interactions between various members of the stargazin/γ and PSD-95 families. To our knowledge, this is the second report thus far showing that phosphorylation of the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif regulates PDZ interactions. We propose three possible roles of stargazin phosphorylation. First, stargazin phosphorylation may regulate the synaptic targeting of AMPARs by modulating interactions between the stargazin C terminus and the PDZ domains of PSD-95 and related PDZ proteins. Consistently, stargazinΔC rescues extrasynaptic but not synaptic AMPAR currents in cerebellar granule cells of stargazer mice (14.Chen L. Chetkovich D.M. Petralia R.S. Sweeney N.T. Kawasaki Y. Wenthold R.J. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Nature. 2000; 408: 936-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In cultured hippocampal neurons, stargazinΔC is diffusely distributed and down-regulates synaptic AMPAR currents (14.Chen L. Chetkovich D.M. Petralia R.S. Sweeney N.T. Kawasaki Y. Wenthold R.J. Bredt D.S. Nicoll R.A. Nature. 2000; 408: 936-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Second, phosphorylation may regulate the stability of stargazin on the synaptic surface membrane. Phosphorylated stargazin may lose its ability to interact with synaptic PDZ anchors and consequently diffuse away laterally from the synaptic surface or become internalized. Consistently, PSD-95 markedly suppresses internalization of its binding partners including Kv1.4 potassium channel (27.Jugloff D.G. Khanna R. Schlichter L.C. Jones O.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1357-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and β1-adrenergic receptor (28.Hu L.A. Tang Y. Miller W.E. Cong M. Lau A.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Hall R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38659-38666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Stargazin phosphorylation may not be the only factor that determines its synaptic stability, if stargazin delivered to synaptic sites still remains associated with AMPARs, which are known to interact with their own anchors such as GRIP/ABP (26.Dong H. RJ O.B. Fung E.T. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1997; 386: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 29.Srivastava S. Osten P. Vilim F.S. Khatri L. Inman G. States B.

However, a mutant GluR2 subunit of AMPARs lacking GRIP binding loses its stability at the synaptic surface (31.Osten P. Khatri L. Perez J.L. Kohr G. Giese G. Daly C. Schulz T.W. Wensky A. Lee L.M.

Third, stargazin phosphorylation may regulate translocation of AMPARs to the cell surface. Stargazin phosphorylation may release the stargazin-AMPAR complex from cytosolic PDZ anchors and facilitate its delivery to the surface membrane. Interestingly, phosphorylation of the Ser-845 residue of GluR1, a subunit of AMPARs that binds to stargazin (14.Chen L. Chetkovich D.M. Petralia R.S. Sweeney N.T. Kawasaki Y. Wenthold R.J. Bredt D.S.

In addition, PKA activation reduces N-methyl-d-aspartic acid-induced GluR1 endocytosis, and PKA inhibition reduces GluR1 reinsertion following NMDA treatment (32.Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2000; 28: 511-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). It is known that Ser-845 of GluR1 is phosphorylated by PKA (20.Mammen A.L. Kameyama K. Roche K.W. Huganir R.L. J. Biol.

Stargazin phosphorylation by PKA may be a molecular mechanism that explains the effects of PKA on AMPAR surface expression.

https://openalex.org/W2047661097,"Precisely how mutant p53 exerts a dominant negative effect over wild type p53 has been an enigma. To understand how wild type and mutant p53 form hetero-oligomers, we studied p53 biogenesis in vitro. We show here that p53 dimers are formed cotranslationally (on the polysome), whereas tetramers are formed posttranslationally (by the dimerization of dimers in solution). Coexpression of wild type and mutant p53 therefore results in 50% of the p53 generated being heterotetramers comprised of a single species: wild type dimer/mutant dimer. Using hot spot mutants of p53 and a variety of natural target sites, we show that all wild type/mutant heterotetramers manifest impaired DNA binding activity. This impairment is not due to the mutant dimeric subunit inhibiting association of the complex with DNA but rather due to the lack of significant contribution (positive cooperativity) from the mutant partner. For all heterotetramers, bias in binding is particularly pronounced against those sequences in genes responsible for apoptosis rather than cell growth arrest. These results explain the molecular basis of p53 dominant negative effect and suggest a functional role in the regulation of p53 tetramerization.

Over half of all human cancers are mutated in the gene encoding p53, and many viruses can induce transformation of the host cell through p53 inactivation (Ref. 1.Hollstein M. Shomer B. Greenblatt M. Soussi T. Hovig E. Montesano R. Harris C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar; reviewed in Refs. 2.Levine A.J.

Furthermore, inheriting a germline p53 mutation characteristic of Li-Fraumeni syndrome confers a strong predisposition to cancer because 50% of those afflicted acquire cancer by age 30 (4.Malkin D. Li F.P. Strong L.C. Fraumeni Jr., J.F. Nelson C.E. Kim D.H. Kassel J. Gryka M.A. Bischoff F.Z. Tainsky M.A. Friend S.H.

The role of p53 in tumorigenesis was also demonstrated in an animal tumor model, in which p53−/− mice were found to be more prone to cancer development (primarily lymphomas) compared with their wild type (p53+/+) and heterozygous (p53+/−) littermates (6.Donehower L.A.

Butel J.S. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Loss of p53 or its function is therefore clearly linked to tumor formation. As “guardian of the genome,” p53 is activated by a number of genotoxic and stress signals such as ionizing radiation, ultraviolet light, ribonucleotide depletion, hypoxia, oxidative stress, heat shock, and exposure to nitric oxide (reviewed in Ref. 8.Ljungmann M. Neoplasia. 2000; 2: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Critical to the tumor-suppressing function of activated p53 is its ability to bind sequence-specific DNA sites and induce the transcription of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. This is illustrated by the fact that most p53 mutations occur in its DNA-binding domain and affect its sequence-specific DNA binding ability (1.Hollstein M. Shomer B. Greenblatt M. Soussi T. Hovig E. Montesano R. Harris C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Such mutations (called “hot spot” mutations) can be divided into two categories; class I mutations affect residues that make direct contact with DNA, whereas class II mutations occur at residues crucial for maintaining the conformation of the DNA-binding domain (9.Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar). The consensus p53 binding site consists of two or more copies of the 10-bp half-site 5′-PuPuPuC(A/T)(A/T)GPyPyPy-3′ separated by up to 13 bp (10.el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). Minor variations to this consensus sequence are found in all p53 target genes. Each half-site consists of two inverted repeat 5-bp quarter sites. p53 binds to this consensus DNA sequence as a pair of clamps, with the two monomers within each dimer binding to two consecutive quarter sites within a half-site (11.McLure K.G. Lee P.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3342-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The two dimers within the tetramer therefore bind to the two half-sites in juxtaposition to each other, resulting in overall enhanced stability of the p53-DNA complex. The lack of such cooperative binding in a single dimer-half-site interaction accounts for the drastically reduced stability of the dimer-half-site complex relative to that of the tetramer-full site complex. This is also reflected by the observation that in contrast to full sites, half-sites do not confer transcriptional responsiveness to p53. 1K. G. McLure, D. D. Sweet, and P. W. K. Lee, unpublished data. Although there is little doubt that tumors often arise through deletion or mutation of both p53 alleles (the two-hit model) (12.Knudsen Jr., A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 820-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (5622) Google Scholar), there is increasing evidence that a point mutation or deletion in a single allele could result in increased susceptibility to cancer (13.Nigro J.M. Baker S.J. Preisinger A.C. Jessup J.M. Hostetter R. Cleary K. Bigner S.H. Davidson N. Baylin S. Devilee P. Glover T. Collins F.S. Weston A. Modali R. Harris C.C. Vogelstein B.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4657-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In cases where both mutant and wild type p53 are expressed, it has been suggested that the mutant protein exerts a dominant negative effect over the wild type protein, essentially rendering the latter inactive (reviewed in Refs. 18.Roemer K. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar and 19.Blagosklonny M.V. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1901-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The end result is a drastic decrease in the level of functional p53, which in turn promotes genomic instability and cancer development. That the mere reduction in functional p53 levels may be sufficient to promote tumorigenesis has also been recently shown in an animal tumor model in which heterozygous p53+/− mice containing a single wild type p53 allele develop tumors much earlier than those mice with two functional p53 alleles (17.Venkatachalam S. Shi Y.P. Jones S.N. Vogel H. Bradley A. Pinkel D. Donehower L.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4657-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The fact that many human tumors contain both a mutant and a wild type allele has led to speculations as to how mutant p53 can affect wild type p53 function. It has been proposed (and generally believed) that in such tumors, the mutant p53 protein complexes with the wild type counterpart and drives the latter into a mutant conformation that is nonfunctional (i.e. incapable of binding DNA). This model portrays mutant p53 as being dominant over wild type p53, leading to the so-called “dominant negative” effect. Support for this model has come largely from experiments in which mutant and wild type p53 were found to be coprecipitatable when they are coexpressed (20.Milner J. Metcalf E.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 765-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). More recent data suggest that the C-terminal oligomerization domain of p53 is absolutely required for the manifestation of this dominant negative effect, because p53 mutants without a functional tetramerization domain are not dominant negative and not oncogenic (21.Chene P. Mittl P. Grutter M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 873-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22.Chene P. Bechter E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1269-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although it now seems clear that p53 mutants need to interact with wild type p53 to impart a dominant negative effect (23.Waterman M.J. Waterman J.L. Halazonetis T.D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 158-163PubMed Google Scholar), there is no concrete evidence that this effect is the result of an induced conformational change of the wild type protein. Indeed, it has been reported that mutant p53 proteins that have a wild type conformation (class I mutants) are also able to impart a dominant negative effect (24.Chene P. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In corroboration with the above observation was the demonstration that the C-terminal oligomerization domain alone is sufficient to disrupt normal wild type p53 function (25.Shaulian E. Zauberman A. Ginsberg D. Oren M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5581-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 26.Deb D. Chakraborti A.S. Lanyi A. Troyer D.A. Deb S. Int. J. Oncol. 1999; 15: 413-422PubMed Google Scholar). In view of the somewhat fragmentary and at times apparently contradictory information obtained thus far pertaining to the mechanistic aspects of the p53 dominant negative effect (reviewed in Refs. 18.Roemer K. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar and 19.Blagosklonny M.V. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1901-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), a unifying concept that can accommodate most, if not all, of the observations made to date is badly needed. Such information would provide a better understanding of the role of p53 mutants in tumor development and would lead to the design of more precise and effective therapeutic measures in restoring wild type p53 function. We approached this problem by first studying the biogenesis of p53in vitro. We demonstrate here that dimerization of p53 occurs on the polysome (i.e. cotranslationally), whereas tetramerization (dimer-dimer interaction) occurs in solution (i.e. posttranslationally). Thus, coexpression of wild type and mutant p53 results in only a single heterotetrameric species of p53 (wild type dimer/mutant dimer), representing 50% of total p53. Through the use of hot spot mutants of p53 (none of which is capable of strong binding to DNA) and a variety of natural p53 target sites, we show that all heterotetramers bind poorly to these sites compared with the wild type p53 tetramer. Such impaired binding is not likely due to mutant-imposed conformational change of wild type p53 but rather is due to the lack of complementary binding by the mutant dimeric subunit (positive dimer-dimer cooperativity). We propose this “incompetent partner” model, which reconciles a number of puzzling observations to date, as the basis of the p53 dominant negative effect. The dominant negative effect is more pronounced with sequences linked to apoptotic response than those responsible for cell growth arrest, supporting the notion that the lack of apoptotic cell death likely plays a more important role than does loss of cell growth control in cancer development. The full-length constructs used were pGEMhp53wtB (wild type tetrameric human p53-hp53) and pGEM A344 (dimeric human p53-A344), both gifts from T. Halazonetis (27.Waterman J.L. Shenk J.L. Halazonetis T.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 512-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). hp53ΔN and A344ΔN were created by PCR with the following primers: 5′-ATATGAATTCAACCAGCAGCCTCCCGCGACCATGGTTCTGTCCCCCTTGCC-3′ and 3′-GGGATATCACTCAGCATAAT-5′. All p53 mutants used were also a kind gift from T. Halazonetis. RNA was made by linearizing purified plasmid DNA with HindIII and then transcribing with Sp6 polymerase using the Megascript kit (Ambion). For translation, small aliquots of RNA were added to rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega). A typical reaction consisted of 17.5 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate, 4.5 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O, 1 μl of amino acids minus methionine, 1 μl of [35S] methionine (0.5 MBq/μl), and 1 μl of RNA (typically 25 ng/μl). For situations when unlabeled p53 was used, a complete amino acid mixture was added to the translation reaction with no [35S] methionine. Translations were carried out at 37 °C for 12 min. Aliquots of translation mixture were diluted 1:5 in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated on ice with 1 μl of the p53 monoclonal antibody DO-1 (Santa Cruz) or an equivalent amount of normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz). 50 μl of inactivated Staphylococcus A (IgSorb; The Enzyme Center) was then added to the mixture and incubated for an additional 30 min on ice. The pellets were washed four times in wash buffer (400 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) and resuspended in protein sample buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 1% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue). The samples were then boiled for 5 min prior to their electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS. The gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid and 15% methanol, embedded with diphenyloxazole (Sigma), dried, and exposed to X-Omat AR film (Kodak) at −70 °C. Quantification was performed on unaltered images with SigmaGel software (SPSS Science) (see Fig. 4B). A typical DNA binding reaction contained 2.5 μl of translation mixture, 1.2 μl of glycerol, 1 μl of salmon testes DNA (0.1 μg/μl), 0.4 μl of bovine serum albumin (50 μg/μl; Sigma), 0.25 μl of dithiothreitol (0.1 m; Sigma), 0.25 μl of pAb421 (Oncogene Science), 2.9 μl of Tris-buffered saline, and 1 μl of 32P-labeled DNA (1 ng/μl). In situations where DO-1 was added to supershift the p53-DNA complex, an additional 0.25 μl of DO-1 (Santa Cruz) was included in the mixture. The reactions were incubated at 22 °C for 45 min, then cooled to 4 °C, and electrophoresed in a high ionic strength, nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (11.McLure K.G. Lee P.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3342-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The gels were dried and exposed to X-Omat Blue XB-1 film (Kodak) at −70 °C. Quantification was done using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and ImageQuaNT software (see Fig. 7) or with SigmaGel software (SPSS Science) on unaltered images (see Fig. 4C). The sequences of CON and H1 were reported previously (11.McLure K.G. Lee P.W.

To gain a complete understanding of how p53 monomers reach a tetrameric state, we carried out in vitro experiments to study the biogenesis pathway of p53. It was important to first determine whether p53 dimerization occurs cotranslationally or posttranslationally. To this end, we used transcripts of a dimeric mutant named A344 for in vitrotranslation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. This mutant contains a point mutation at residue 344 (from leucine to alanine) that disrupts the dimer-dimer interface and results in the formation of dimeric rather than tetrameric p53 (27.Waterman J.L. Shenk J.L. Halazonetis T.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 512-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if p53 dimerization was a posttranslational event, then the efficiency of dimer formation would be strictly dependent on the concentration of the translated A344 protein (and hence the concentration of the transcripts) in the reaction. Conversely, the efficiency of cotranslational dimer formation (i.e. on the polysome) would not be affected by transcript concentration. Accordingly, various amounts of A344 transcripts were translated in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and dimer formation in these reactions was assessed by direct half-site DNA binding analysis using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA).2 Because monomeric p53 cannot bind DNA (22.Chene P. Bechter E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1269-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the results should be relatively unambiguous. Fig. 1 shows that regardless of transcript concentration in the reactions (three serial 2-fold dilutions), the dimer/total A344 ratios remained relatively constant. These results are consistent with the notion that p53 dimerization occurs cotranslationally rather than posttranslationally. To further confirm that p53 dimerization is a cotranslational event, we made use of another dimeric construct, A344ΔN (Fig. 2A). A344ΔN is derived from A344 and has a small deletion at the N terminus (residues 2–30), making it migrate faster than A344 upon SDS-PAGE. Like A344, A344ΔN bound the consensus DNA half-site as dimeric p53 (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, because of this deletion, A344ΔN was unable to interact with the anti-p53 antibody DO-1, which readily recognized A344 (Fig. 2C, lanes 1–6). Because DO-1 is capable of recognizing a monomer within a dimer (see below), it was used in coprecipitation studies to see whether cotranslation of the two constructs could lead to the formation of A344/A344ΔN heterodimers detectable by this antibody. The results show that under translation conditions using normal concentrations of RNA, where the two constructs formed dimers readily (as assessed by EMSA), DO-1 precipitated A344 but not A344ΔN (Fig. 2C, lanes 7 and 8). These data strongly suggest that p53 dimers form cotranslationally. To rule out the possibility that A344/A344ΔN heterodimers are unstable or undetectable, we cotranslated the two transcripts at high RNA concentrations. Under these conditions, space constraint allowed some nascent polypeptide chains from neighboring transcripts to interact (28.Gilmore R. Coffey M.C. Leone G. McLure K.G. Lee P.W.K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2651-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), resulting in a small amount of A344ΔN complexing with A344 and precipitable with DO-1 (Fig. 2C, lanes 9 and 10). This shows that the lack of detection of A344/A344ΔN heterodimers under translation conditions using normal concentrations of RNA is not due to instability of the A344/A344ΔN heterodimers. It also demonstrates that the antibody DO-1 is capable of interacting with a monomer within a p53 dimer. We then proceeded to determine whether p53 tetramerization occurs cotranslationally or posttranslationally. The approach was similar to that above except tetrameric rather than dimeric p53 constructs (i.e. without the A344 mutation) were used. We first translated various amounts of wild type human p53 (hp53) in vitro and assessed the formation of dimeric and tetrameric p53 by direct half-site DNA binding using EMSA. Fig. 3 shows that at low transcript (and hence low protein) concentrations, the p53 made was mostly in the dimeric form. At higher transcript concentrations, the ratio of tetramer/dimer increased dramatically. This is consistent with the notion that whereas p53 dimers are formed cotranslationally, tetramers are formed posttranslationally. To further demonstrate this point, cotranslation experiments were carried out using the wild type hp53 construct and the truncated construct hp53ΔN (Fig. 4A). When the two constructs were translated separately, DO-1 precipitated wild type p53 (hp53) but not the truncated construct hp53ΔN (Fig. 4B, lanes 1–6). When the two transcripts were mixed at approximately equimolar ratios and then translated, heterotetramers formed readily as detectable by DO-1 (Fig. 4B, lanes 7 and 8). Furthermore, the ratio of hp53 to hp53ΔN following immunoprecipitation with DO-1 was ∼2:1 (after normalizing to expression levels), precisely what would be expected for dimers of each species randomly oligomerizing in solution to form tetramers (see below). These results therefore again suggest that tetramerization (dimerization of dimers) is a posttranslational process. If p53 assembly involves cotranslational dimerization followed by posttranslational tetramerization, then cotranslation of equal molar amounts of hp53 and hp53ΔN should only generate three tetrameric species, (hp53)4, (hp53)2/(hp53ΔN)2, and (hp53ΔN)4 (ideally in the molar ratio of 1:2:1). These species should be clearly discernible using the antibody DO-1 for supershift experiments in EMSA. The results of such an experiment are shown in Fig. 4C. When translated separately, hp53, but not hp53ΔN, was supershifted by DO-1 (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 4 and 6). Cotranslation of hp53 and hp53ΔN transcripts yielded a total of three species, two of which could be supershifted by DO-1 (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 7 and 8). These results are again consistent with the cotranslational dimerization/posttranslational tetramerization model. As mentioned above, the molar ratio of the three species should ideally be 1:2:1 (assuming proteins from the two constructs were synthesized in equimolar amounts). However, we consistently found (hp53)4to be somewhat under-represented (Fig. 4C, lane 8, top band). This was likely due to DO-1 partially blocking the binding of (hp53)4 to the consensus sequence, thereby reducing the level of (hp53)4-bound DNA (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 3 and 4). A similar observation has been previously reported for the antibody PAb246, which recognizes wild type murine p53 (11.McLure K.G. Lee P.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3342-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The binding of the (hp53)2/(hp53ΔN)2 tetramer to DNA was apparently unaffected by DO-1, possibly because only one of the two dimers interacted with the antibody. Overall, the results from the two sets of experiments involving dimeric and tetrameric constructs, respectively, are consistent with the idea that p53 biogenesis is a two-step process: cotranslational dimerization followed by posttranslational tetramerization. This is in agreement with previous results on the folding of peptides from the tetramerization domain of p53 (29.Mateu M.G. Sanchez Del Pino M.M. Fersht A.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Our demonstration that dimers are formed cotranslationally suggests that posttranslational exchange of monomeric subunits between dimers is probably not very efficient, if it occurs at all. On the other hand, because dimer-dimer interaction (tetramerization) is a posttranslational event, there is a good possibility that dimeric subunit exchange between p53 tetramers can occur with a certain degree of efficiency (30.Lee W. Harvey T.S. Yin Y. Yau P. Litchfield D. Arrowsmith C.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 877-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This is an important consideration because it would imply that an equilibrium could exist between dimers and tetramers and that external factors or parameters could influence this equilibrium and hence p53 function. To test this hypothesis, it was first necessary to confirm the relative lack of monomeric exchange between dimers. 35S-Labeled A344 and A344ΔN were translated separately, and cycloheximide was then added to halt further translation. Incubation was continued for an additional hour to allow time for each reaction to reach equilibrium. The two reactions were then mixed and incubated for 2 h, after which immunoprecipitation with DO-1 was carried out to look for heterodimer formation, which would be indicative of subunit exchange. The results showed that no A344ΔN could be coprecipitated with A344 (Fig. 5A), suggesting that exchange of monomers between dimers did not occur. Therefore, the cotranslational formation of p53 dimers appears to be a one-way process. This is also in agreement with our observation above that p53 monomers do not exist in solution. To determine whether dimer/dimer exchange can take place between tetramers, a similar experiment was performed with hp53 and hp53ΔN (Fig. 5B). After a 2-h incubation period, there was a clear increase of heterotetramer formation. This shows that dimers within a tetramer of p53 can exchange with one another and that they are in equilibrium.

Recently, we observed that a PG-M/versican mutant exerts a dominant-negative effect on cell proliferation by inhibiting secretion of endogenous PG-M/versican and can interact with intact astrocytoma cells (33.Zhang Y.

Our studies suggest that PG-M/versican functions through binding to cell-surface receptors. This study was designed to investigate whether PG-M/versican can act via an integrin-mediated pathway. We show here that PG-M/versican interacts with β1-integrin. This interaction activates focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activity, mediates cell adhesion, and protects the cells from free radical-induced cell apoptosis. Lipofectin, Geneticin (G418), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), Hanks' balanced salt solution, and trypsin/EDTA were from Invitrogen (Burlington, Ontario, Canada). The ECL Western blot detection kit was from Amersham Biosciences. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies, and all chemicals were from Sigma. Tissue culture plates were from Nunc Inc. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by BioBasic Inc. (Scarborough, Ontario). Astrocytoma U87 and COS-7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% (U87) or 5% (COS-7) FBS at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. The cell lysate was prepared from the astrocytoma cell line U87 stably transfected with the mini-versican construct or the G3ΔEGF construct (the versican G3 domain lacking two EGF-like motifs). Both constructs contain a His tag that binds to Ni2+-NTA resin. The lysis buffer contained 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 30 mm imidazole, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1.5% Triton X-100. After lysis, the cell extract was subjected to centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 30 min in a cold room. The supernatant was incubated overnight with Ni2+-NTA beads at 4 °C under native conditions (QIAGEN purification system). The beads were washed with washing buffer containing 45 mm imidazole and eluted with elution buffer. The eluate was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, boiled in 1× protein loading dye for 5 min, subjected to Western blot analysis, and probed with anti-β1-integrin antibody JB1a (Chemicon International, Inc.). The cell lysate was prepared in lysis buffer for protein interaction (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml BSA, and 1.5% Triton X-100), followed by centrifugation to recover proteins in the supernatant. The protein sample was incubated overnight at 4 °C with protein G that had been saturated with monoclonal antibody 4B6 (36.Binette F. Cravens J. Kahoussi B. Haudenschild D.R. Goetinck P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19116-19122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by blocking with 5% BSA. After washing, the beads were boiled in 1× protein loading dye for 5 min, analyzed by Western blotting, and probed with anti-β1-integrin antibody JB1a. In addition, the cell lysate was incubated with antibody JB1a-saturated protein G under the same conditions as described above to co-immunoprecipitate G3ΔEGF. Bound products were analyzed by Western blotting and probed with antibody 4B6. Cells were subjected to native gel electrophoresis, harvested, homogenized, and then centrifuged. Cell membrane fractions were resuspended in 1% Triton X-100 and subjected to electrophoresis on 3–20% gradient gels. The separated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting and probed with antibody JB1a or 4B6. Protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on separating gel containing 10–12% acrylamide. The buffer system was 1× Tris/glycine buffer (Amresco) containing 1% SDS. Separated proteins were transblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane in 1× Tris/glycine buffer containing 20% methanol at 60 V for 2 h in a cold room. The membrane was blocked in TBST (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 10% nonfat dry milk powder (TBSTM) for 30 min at room temperature to saturate nonspecific binding sites on the membrane. The membrane was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with monoclonal antibody 4B6 (which recognizes an epitope at the leading peptide of the link protein, which was engineered in all recombinant constructs) or with the anti-His tag monoclonal antibody prepared in TBSTM. The membranes were washed with TBST (3 × 30-min washes) and then incubated for 2 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (1:50,000 dilution) in TBSTM. After washing as described above, the bound antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL kit). G3 recombinant proteins containing an N-terminal His tag were purified on Ni-NTA affinity columns (catalog no. 30230, QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA) as previously described (31.Zhang Y. Cao L. Yang B.L. Yang B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21342-21352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Briefly, the G3 domain was amplified by PCR using two primers, 5′-aaaggatccggacaggatccatgcaaa and 5′-aaagcatgcgcgccttgagtcctgccacgt. The product was subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pQE30 (catalog no. 32149, QIAGEN Inc.), and the resulting construct contained an N-terminalMRGSHis tag. The G3 construct was expressed in Escherichia coli strain M15 using pQE30. Protein expressed in bacteria was prepared, and peptides were purified on an Ni2+-NTA affinity column under denaturing conditions according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein was dialyzed and renatured in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 50–150 mm NaCl (serial increase NaCl), 0.1 mm EDTA, 2–10% glycerol (serial increase), and 0.2–1 mm dithiothreitol (serial increase). G3ΔEGF- and vector-transfected cells harvested by trypsinization were washed three times with TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.4)) containing 2 mm CaCl2 and probed with antibody 4B6 for 1 h on ice in the presence of 2 mmCaCl2, followed by staining with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h on ice in the dark. Cells were washed after each treatment. Binding of G3ΔEGF to the cell surface was analyzed by flow cytometry. Vector-transfected U87 cells were also incubated with the culture medium from G3ΔEGF- or vector-transfected cells at 37 °C for 1 h or with purified His6-G3 (expressed by bacteria) at room temperature for 1 h to assess binding of G3ΔEGF or His6-G3 products to cells. CaCl2 and MnCl2 were included in the system at a concentration of 2 mm each. Bacterially expressed His6-G3 was purified on Ni-NTA affinity columns and dialyzed overnight against TBS containing CaCl2 at room temperature. Equal numbers of cells were incubated with 0.1% BSA in Hanks' balanced salt solution as a negative control. The cells were washed three times with cold TBS containing CaCl2 and MnCl2 (2 mmeach), followed by antibody 4B6 staining as described above. Tissue culture plates were precoated with the culture medium from vector- or G3ΔEGF-transfected cells or with purified His6-G3. Plates were then seeded with cells transfected with G3ΔEGF or the vector control and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The cell lysate was prepared in lysis buffer for phosphorylation assay (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.5% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 4 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mmsodium molybdate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), followed by incubation with protein G that had been presaturated overnight with anti-FAK monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories) at 4 °C. After washing, the beads were boiled in 1× protein loading dye for 5 min, followed by Western blot analysis and probing with anti-FAK or anti-phosphotyrosine (clone PY-20, Transduction Laboratories) antibody to detect FAK phosphorylation. Vector-transfected cells (2 × 105 cells) were seeded on six-well plates precoated with the culture medium from vector- or G3ΔEGF-transfected cells and incubated on the plates at 37 °C for 1–1.5 h as described in the figure legends. Unattached cells were removed by washing, and the remaining cells were photographed. Ni-NTA-purified His6-G3 was also used to coat six-well plates. The coated wells were washed with DMEM, followed by incubation with vector-transfected cells (2 × 105 cells) in DMEM at 37 °C for 7 h. The cultures were photographed, and attached cells were counted. To test whether cell adhesion is proportional to a decreasing concentration of G3ΔEGF product, the culture media collected from vector- and G3ΔEGF-transfected U87 cells were diluted with phosphate-buffered saline to 100, 50, 25, 12.5, and 6.25% and used to coat six-well tissue culture plates at 4 °C overnight. U87 cells (2 × 105 cells/well) were seeded on the wells in DMEM containing 1% FBS and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells remaining on the plate were photographed and counted. The effect of the products of mini-versican and G3ΔEGF on the adhesion of different cells was also examined. The culture media from vector-, mini-versican-, and G3ΔEGF-transfected U87 cells were used to coat six-well tissue culture dishes at 4 °C for 4 h. Different types of cells (U87 cells, NIH3T3 fibroblasts, Jurkat cells, and breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231; 2 × 105cells/well) were inoculated on the wells in DMEM containing 1% FBS and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The culture media were removed, and the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells remaining on plates were counted. Vector-transfected cells (1.5 × 104 cells) were incubated in 100 μl of DMEM in the presence or absence of antibody JB1a at a concentration of 30 μg/ml at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were then seeded on 96-well culture plates precoated with purified His6-G3 and maintained at 37 °C for 7 h. Unattached cells were removed by washing. The remaining cells were photographed, and cell attachment was determined by cell counting. Nylon membranes were incubated with the U87 cell lysate (membrane preparation) or heat-denatured bovine serum at room temperature for 1 h, followed by blocking with heat-denatured bovine serum at room temperature for 1 h. After washing, the nylon membranes were incubated at room temperature with the culture medium from G3ΔEGF-transfected U87 cells for 1 h to absorb G3ΔEGF. The treated medium, untreated G3ΔEGF-containing medium, or medium containing BSA was incubated with vector-transfected U87 cells for attachment assays as described above. U87 cells (5 × 104 cells) were also incubated with the culture medium containing purified His6-G3 or eluate from the vector control in the presence of 2 mm each CaCl2 and MnCl2 at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were then inoculated on 12-well tissue culture plates precoated with purified His6-G3 and maintained at 37 °C for 7 h. Unattached cells were removed, and attached cells were photographed and counted. U87 cells (2 × 105cells/well) in monolayer culture on six-well plates or in suspension culture were treated with H2O2 (at 1.5 mm for 6 h or at 0.1 mm for 48 h, respectively). Trypan blue staining was used to determine viability. Cells were also subjected to annexin V-FITC staining (15 min in the dark) using an annexin V apoptosis detection kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) to monitor apoptosis as described (37.Chao C. Saito S. Kang J. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Xu Y. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4967-4975Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 38.Vitale C. Romagnani C. Puccetti A. Olive D. Costello R. Chiossone L.

A mini-versican (Fig. 1A) containing an engineered His6 tag was stably expressed in human astrocytoma cell line U87. The cell lysate was prepared under native conditions and purified with Ni-NTA resin. The purified product was analyzed by Western blotting and probed with antibody JB1a. The untreated lysate was used as a positive control to detect integrin, and the cell lysate from vector-transfected cells that had been subjected to the same purification procedure was used as a negative control. The results indicated that β1-integrin was pulled down by the His-tagged mini-versican (Fig. 1B). Expression of the mini-versican was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 1C). Our previous studies suggested that U87 cells interact with a versican mutant construct containing only the CRD and CBP motifs (G3ΔEGF) expressed by COS-7 cells and with the versican G3 domain expressed by bacteria (His6-G3) (33.Zhang Y. Cao L. Yang B.L. Yang B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33054-33063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 34.Yang B.L. Zhang Y. Cao L. Yang B.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 210-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To examine the molecular sites of interaction at the subdomain level, the cell lysate prepared from G3ΔEGF-transfected cells was subjected to the pull-down assay using Ni-NTA resin as described above. Probing with antibody JB1a indicated that β1-integrin coprecipitated with G3ΔEGF (Fig. 1, B and C). His6-G3 expressed in bacteria was purified and incubated with intact U87 cells for 2 h, followed by pull-down assay. The results indicated that His6-G3 bound to β1-integrin (Fig. 1D). To confirm this binding, co-immunoprecipitation was performed on the lysate from G3ΔEGF-transfected cells using monoclonal antibodies BJ1a and 4B6 (which recognizes an epitope at the leading peptide of G3ΔEGF). Consistent with the above results, β1-integrin was co-immunoprecipitated with G3ΔEGF (Fig. 1E), and G3ΔEGF was co-immunoprecipitated with antibody BJ1a (Fig. 1F). As a final experiment, the lysate prepared from G3ΔEGF- or vector-transfected cells was subjected to native gel electrophoresis and Western blotting and then probed with antibody JB1a or 4B6. Both antibodies detected bands with similar patterns, migrating at sizes ranging from 250 to 500 kDa (Fig. 1G). This indicated that the majority of the cell-associated G3ΔEGF interacts with β1-integrin under native conditions and suggested that versican is an important partner in regulating the integrin signaling pathway, although G3ΔEGF does not contain the RGD consensus-binding sequence for integrins (14.Shinomura T. Nishida Y. Ito K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14461-14469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine binding of G3ΔEGF to the cell surface, G3ΔEGF- and vector-transfected cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Labeling with antibody 4B6 demonstrated that cells transfected with G3ΔEGF expressed and interacted with this protein strongly (77% binding) (Fig. 2A). When untransfected U87 cells were incubated with the culture medium from G3ΔEGF- or vector-transfected COS-7 cells, large amounts of bound G3ΔEGF were detected (51% binding) (Fig. 2B). Incubation with His6-G3 purified from a bacterial expression system produced similar results (Fig. 2C). In the presence of either calcium (Fig. 2D) or manganese (Fig. 2E), binding of His6-G3 to the cell surface was concentration-dependent. However, manganese had the greater effect on binding, and 5 mm manganese had the same effect on the binding activity as a combination of calcium and manganese (2 mm each) (data not shown). The binding activity disappeared when EDTA was added (Fig. 2F), confirming the requirement for calcium or manganese. Binding of G3ΔEGF to the cell surface was also confirmed by confocal microscopy. Labeling with antibody 4B6 showed that G3ΔEGF bound to the surface of G3ΔEGF-transfected U87 cells (Fig. 2G), but no staining was detected in vector-transfected cells (Fig. 2H). To investigate the biological effect of versican-β1-integrin interaction, we examined its effect on FAK activity, the immediate intracellular step in the integrin-mediated pathway (1.Hynes R.O.

The cell lysate prepared from G3ΔEGF- or vector-transfected U87 cells was immunoprecipitated with anti-FAK antibody, followed by Western blot assay and probing with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. G3ΔEGF-transfected cells had a higher level of phosphotyrosine activity compared with vector-transfected cells, although probing with anti-FAK antibody showed that the levels of FAK protein expression were similar (Fig. 3). Treatment of U87 cells with purified His6-G3 also resulted in enhanced phosphotyrosine activity of FAK compared with BSA treatment. It is known that integrin-mediated cell adhesion results in activation of FAK activity (6.Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2811) Google Scholar, 7.Zachary I. Rozengurt E. Cell. 1992; 71: 891-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the observed G3ΔEGF-induced FAK activation is accompanied by changes in cell adhesion, we inoculated G3ΔEGF- and vector-transfected cells on tissue culture plates for attachment assays. As predicted, G3ΔEGF expression induced cell attachment (Fig. 4A) compared with the vector control (Fig. 4B). On bacterial Petri dishes, G3ΔEGF-transfected cells were able to attach and grow as monolayer cultures (Fig. 4C), whereas vector-transfected cells aggregated and remained in suspension (Fig. 4D). These results suggested that G3ΔEGF expression had enhanced cell adhesion. To confirm this effect, plates were coated with the medium containing G3ΔEGF or purified His6-G3 and inoculated with U87 cells. G3ΔEGF in the culture medium (Fig. 4E) or purified His6-G3 (Fig. 4F) enhanced cell attachment compared with plates coated with the culture medium from vector-transfected cells (Fig. 4G) or BSA alone (Fig. 4H). We then performed independent assays similar to those described in the legend to Fig. 4 to quantify the cell attachment effected by G3ΔEGF. We demonstrated that G3ΔEGF-expressing cells had much greater activity to attach to tissue culture plates (Fig. 5A) and Petri dishes (Fig. 5B). U87 cells had greater activity to attach to t"

Recently, the study of transient receptor potential channels (TRPs) has suggested that these proteins have an important role to play in mediating capacitative calcium entry. In this study, we have isolated a cDNA from human brain that encodes a novel transient receptor potential channel termed human TRP7 (hTRP7). hTRP7 is a member of the short TRP channel family and is 98% homologous to mouse TRP7 (mTRP7). At the mRNA level hTRP7 was widely expressed in tissues of the central nervous system, as well as some peripheral tissues such as pituitary gland and kidney. However, in contrast to mTRP7, which is highly expressed in heart and lung, hTRP7 was undetectable in these tissues. For functional analysis, we heterologously expressed hTRP7 cDNA in an human embryonic kidney cell line. In comparison with untransfected cells depletion of intracellular calcium stores in hTRP7-expressing cells, using either carbachol or thapsigargin, produced a marked increase in the subsequent level of Ca2+ influx. This increased Ca2+ entry was blocked by inhibitors of capacitative calcium entry such as La3+ and Gd3+. Furthermore, transient transfection of an hTRP7 antisense expression construct into cells expressing hTRP7 eliminated the augmented store-operated Ca2+ entry. Our findings suggest that hTRP7 is a store-operated calcium channel, a finding in stark contrast to the mouse orthologue, mTRP7, which is reported to enhance Ca2+ influx independently of store depletion, and suggests that human and mouse TRP7 channels may fulfil different physiological roles.

Numerous G-protein-coupled receptors signal through the phospholipase C pathway to liberate intracellular Ca2+stores and elicit the activation of a variety of cellular signal transduction pathways. Intrinsic to the integrity of this system is the process of refilling of these Ca2+ stores, which requires a regulated Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. Two broad mechanisms appear to be responsible for activating this Ca2+ influx and consequent store refilling. In a number of systems, store depletion itself seems to activate refilling. This can be experimentally demonstrated by passively depleting Ca2+stores with Ca2+ ATPase inhibitors such as thapsigargin (1.Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar,2.Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar).

The second key mechanism operates independently of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, whereby downstream products of the phospholipase Cβ cascade directly activate Ca2+ influx (3.Putney Jr., J.W.

In photoreceptor cells three related genes have been isolated whose products have been reported to function as calcium permeable channels: the transient receptor potential (trp) gene (8.Montell C.

Neuron. 2000; 26: 647-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Expression of trp in a baculovirus system produced currents when intracellular Ca2+ stores were depleted with thapsigargin (12.Vaca L. Sinkins W.G. Hu Y. Kunze D.L. Schilling W.P. Am. J.

In contrast, however, heterologous expression of trpl and trpγ resulted in currents that were constitutively active irrespective of Ca2+ store status and therefore were not classified as store operated channels (10.Phillips A.M.

A common characteristic of these channels is that they are Ca2+-permeable, nonselective cation channels. Analysis of the channel activation properties of some mammalian TRP channels has lead to different results being obtained dependent on the expression system used. TRP1, however, clearly produced a current activated by Ca2+ store depletion both in recombinant (20.Zitt C. Zobel A. Obukhov A.G. Harteneck C. Kalkbrenner F. Luckhoff A. Schultz G.

Expression of hTRP7 in HEK-293 cells resulted in enhanced CCE following emptying of Ca2+ stores by carbachol or by the Ca2+ pump inhibitor thapsigargin. In addition, expression of an antisense hTRP7 cDNA provided further evidence that, in contrast to its rodent orthologue, hTRP7 functions as a store-operated calcium channel. hTRP7 therefore differs from its mouse orthologue (mTRP7) not only in its mRNA expression profile but also in its activation properties, suggesting that it should not be functionally grouped with its closest relatives, TRP3 and TRP6.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIdentification of Human TRP7 Using Homology SearchingHomology searching against the GenBankTMsequence data base using the human TRP3 protein sequence (accession number U47050) was performed using TBLASTN2 (37.Altschul S.F.

Primers used were sense (5′-CCCAAGCTTATGTTGAGGAACAGCACCTTC-3′) and antisense (5′-CCCCTCGAGCTAAATGTCTTTGCCCTTGTTCAC-3′) that contained the restrictions sites HindIII and XhoI, respectively.PCR amplification was performed from human brain, pituitary gland, and kidney cDNA libraries using Expand polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). The amplified cDNA was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA 3.1/V5-His-Topo (Invitrogen, Groeningen, The Netherlands).

The hTRP7 stable cell line was obtained by transfecting HEK-293 with the pCMV-Tag2b-hTRP7 construct using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), then selecting with 400 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). TaqMan RT-PCR was used to analyze the expression of hTRP7 mRNA in the resistant clones.HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunocytochemistry assays, cells on coverslips were fixed 48 h post-transfection with 4% paraformaldehyde and then either permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 or washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The anti-FLAG antibody (Stratagene) was used at 1:5000 in phosphate-buffered saline. The goat anti-mouse IgG-FITC secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, England) was used 1:100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Fluorescence was viewed using a Leica laser scanning confocal microscope.Measurements of Changes in [Ca2+]iHEK-293 cells attached to coverslips were loaded with Fura-2-AM (5 μm, Molecular Probes) in culture medium for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. Cells were then extensively washed with HEPES-buffered saline containing 107 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1.2 mmMgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 11.5 mmglucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. For Ca2+-free HEPES-buffered saline, CaCl2 was removed and EGTA (0.5 mm) added. For the experiments using GdCl3 or LaCl3, KH2PO4 was omitted from HEPES-buffered saline. SKF-96365 was purchased from Tocris. Images were captured using an Olympix Peltier cooled CCD camera (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Regions containing between 20 and 40 cells were selected, and intracellular free Ca2+ concentration was evaluated by measurement of Fura-2 fluorescence. Briefly, fluorescence was measured using alternating excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and monitoring fluorescence emission at 510 nm. Excitation was performed with a commercially available monochromator-based microfluorimetry system (Olympus). Cells were imaged using a Plan × 40 (1.30 NA) oil-immersion lens (Nikon) and analyzed using UltraView software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Data acquisition was typically at 3.9-s intervals. Changes in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration were expressed as the ratio of emission (510 nm) for 340 nm/380 nm excitation (F340/380). Experiments were performed at room temperature. Data were accumulated under each condition from three to five experiments.For antisense experiments, RFP positively transfected cells were identified using an excitation wavelength of 555 nm and monitoring emission at 585 nm.Mn2+ entry was measured using the same system as described for Ca2+ measurements. The decrease of Fura-2 fluorescence was monitored at its isosbestic point of excitation (358 nm). Cells were bathed in 107 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm MnCl2, 11.5 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3.RESULTSMolecular Cloning and Sequence Analysis of hTRP7As part of a genomics-based program to identify novel ion channels we identified unfinished genomic sequence (AC008661) with similarity to the human short TRP3 protein. Further homology searching indicated that this human sequence was most closely related to the recently identified mouse TRP7 gene (AF139923). The initiation codon was missing from this original gene prediction, but the subsequent appearance of a newer, genomic sequence (AC063980) allowed the identification of an additional exon at the 5′ end of the human gene. The initiation ATG codon was split between exons 1 and 2.hTRP7 contained an open reading frame of 2589 bp encoding a protein of 862 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 100 kDa and an isoelectric point of 7.86 (Fig. 1A). The predicted protein sequence of this submission is identical to a sequence subsequently deposited (AJ272034) with the exception of a single leucine to proline amino acid change at position 111. This amino acid change is caused by a T to C nucleotide change at base pair position 332 (numbering from the initiation codon). We validated this sequence change by cloning hTRP7 from two additional human libraries derived from pituitary gland and kidney. The sequence analysis performed on these two clones revealed the presence of the same base change at position 332 (T to C), demonstrating that this is not a cloning or PCR-derived artifact.Analysis of hTRP7 using the TMPRED algorithm (40.Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 331-337PubMed Google Scholar) that predicts transmembrane domains (TMs) predicted a protein having six TMs and a pore region between TM5 and TM6, similar to those predicted for other TRP subtypes (Fig. 1B). The predicted protein sequence of hTRP7, when aligned with other members of TRP families, revealed that hTRP7 shares 98% overall identity with the mouse TRP7 protein and 81 and 75% overall identity with hTRP3 and hTRP6, respectively. With regard to Drosophila, the most closely related TRP channel is TRPγ, with which hTRP7 shares 41% overall identity. The overall identity with both TRP and TRPL is about 38%. Taken together with the lack of a hydrophobic N-terminal signal sequence, this suggests that hTRP7 is a membrane protein with a core of six transmembrane segments and a pore region, with intracellular flanking N- and C-terminal domains (41.Zhu X. Chu P.B. Peyton M. Birnbaumer L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 42.Boulay G. Zhu X. Peyton M. Jiang M. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol.

Fig. 1C depicts a dendrogram of short TRP channels, constructed using the CLUSTAL W program (43.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55190) Google Scholar). It is clear that hTRP7 is a member of the short transient receptor potential channel family and falls into the TRP3/6/7 subfamily of short TRP channels.The genomic structure of the hTRP7 gene was determined by comparison of the cDNA sequence with the genomic sequences (AC008661, AC026299, and AC063980; Table I). The hTRP7 gene appears to consist of 12 exons, although exon 6 is inferred from comparison with the genomic structures of TRP3 and TRP6 (30.Hofmann T. Obukhov A.G. Schaefer M. Harteneck C. Gudermann T. Schultz G. Nature. 1999; 397: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar), and exon 1 is inferred from an alignment of the longer public mouse TRP7 sequence (AF139923) to the human genomic sequence (AC063980). The genomic sequences of human TRP7 contain a number of sequence tag sites markers, which have been mapped to the chromosomal region 5q31 (Ensembl ContigView and NCBI Map Viewer). One of these markers is the microsatellite marker locus D5S393. BLAST searching with the nucleotide sequence of D5S393 (Z16468) against the genomic sequenceAC063980 indicates that it is situated ∼300 bp upstream of the region predicted to be exon 1 of hTRP7. Thus, D5S393 provides a useful genetic marker for screening hTRP7 as a candidate gene for genetic diseases mapping to this chromosomal region.Table IPredicted exon-intron boundaries of hTRP7Exon numberExon LengthPosition of exon on cDNABoundaries5′-Intro EXON … EXON intro-3′bp1aExon 1 is implicated from mTRP7 (AF139923).>21–2CCTCAAT/gtaagca27783–780cccatag/GTTGAGG … ATTTAAG/gtaactc3183781–963ctgttag/AACGATT … CAAGAAG/gtaagct4165964–1128tttacag/TTCGTTG … CAGCAAG/gtacaga52171129–1345tttccag/CTAGGAC … GTCTTAG/gtaagca62341346–1579NAbExon 6 splice acceptor and donor sites are not yet available in genomic DNA.72651580–1844cttttag/CCAGGGA … TTACAAC/gtgagta81961845–2040tttgcag/GGTTGAA … AATTGAG/gtaaggc92222041–2262tccacag/GAGGATG … ATTCAAG/gtaggta10812263–2343tatccag/AAGACTC … ATACCAG/gtaacca11762344–2419atttcag/AAAATCA … AATGAAG/gtaaatg121702420–2589cttgcag/GCGAGCT …The genomic structure of hTRP7 gene, was determined by comparison of the cDNA sequence reported in this manuscript (AJ421783) to genomic sequences AC008661, AC026299, and AC063980.

These studies indicate that hTRP7 is widely expressed in the central nervous system with the highest levels present in the nucleus accumbens and somewhat lower expression in the putamen, striatum, hypothalamus, caudate nucleus, locus coeruleus, and medulla oblongata. Lower levels of mRNA expression were observed in all other central nervous system regions studied (Fig. 2A). In peripheral tissues a high level of hTRP7 expression was detected in pituitary gland and kidney, with lower levels found in intestine, prostate, and cartilage (Fig. 2A).Figure 2TaqMan RT-PCR analysis of hTRP7 in human tissues and cell lines.

No mRNA expression was detected in the other cell lines examined, including HEK-293 cells.Expression and Localization of hTRP7 in HEK-293 CellsTo perform a functional characterization of hTRP7, a HEK-293 cell-derived stable line was generated expressing an N terminus FLAG-tagged hTRP7 cDNA. Since HEK-293 cells lack detectable mRNA expression of endogenous hTRP7 (Fig. 2B), they are ideal for studying the functional properties of this protein (27.Okada T. Shimizu S. Wakamori M. Maeda A.

Although substrates of Fhit and GalT are known and consequences of mutations in Aprataxin, Fhit, and GalT are known, good substrates had not been reported for any member of the Hint branch, and mutational consequences were unknown for Hint orthologs, which are the most ancient and widespread proteins in the Hint branch and in the histidine triad superfamily. Here we show that rabbit and yeast Hint hydrolyze the natural product adenosine-5′-monophosphoramidate (AMPNH2) in an active-site-dependent manner at second order rates exceeding 1,000,000m−1 s−1. Yeast strains constructed with specific loss of the Hnt1 active site fail to grow on galactose at elevated temperatures. Loss of Hnt1 enzyme activity also leads to hypersensitivity to mutations in Ccl1, Tfb3, and Kin28, which constitute the TFIIK kinase subcomplex of general transcription factor TFIIH and to mutations in Cak1, which phosphorylates Kin28. The target of Hnt1 regulation in this pathway was shown to be downstream of Cak1 and not to affect stability of Kin28 monomers. Functional complementation of all Hnt1 phenotypes was provided by rabbit Hint, which is only 22% identical to yeast Hnt1 but has very similar adenosine monophosphoramidase activity.

Science. 1996; 273: 1714-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), whereas the major RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain kinase of yeast is Kin28, which is TFIIH-associated (30.Feaver W.J.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2983-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In addition to phosphorylating the activation loop of Cdc28, Cak1 phosphorylates the activation loop of Kin28 (33.Espinoza F.H. Farrell A. Nourse J.L. Chamberlin H.M. Gileadi O. Morgan D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6365-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 34.Kimmelman J. Kaldis P. Hengartner C.J. Laff G.M. Koh S.S. Young R.A. Solomon M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4774-4787Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Because the CAK, Cak1, and RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain kinase, Kin28, could both be considered orthologous to Cdk7 and because Kin28 is a substrate of Cak1, we considered the two-hybrid and yeast genetic data (20.Korsisaari N. Makela T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34837-34840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) to be equivocal in identifying the direct target of Hnt1 regulation in yeast. Furthermore, we were interested in determining whether an enzymatic or a nonenzymatic property of Hnt1 is responsible for Cak1 or Kin28 regulation. To avoid species-specific differences in terminology, we refer to the kinase subcomplex of TFIIH, i.e. the yeast Kin28·Ccl1·Tfb3 complex and the mammalian Cdk7·cyclin H·MAT1 complex, as TFIIK (30.Feaver W.J. Svejstrup J.Q. Henry N.L. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 79: 1103-1109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 31.Valay J.G. Simon M. Dubois M.F. Bensaude O. Facca C. Faye G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In this study we discover that loss of hnt1 alone produces a temperature-sensitive phenotype on galactose media and that hnt1 deficiency leads to synthetic loss of viability with hypomorphic alleles of cak1, ccl1, and tfb3. Additionally, hnt1 produces synthetic phenotypes with all temperature-sensitive alleles of Kin28 examined, with nonphosphorylatable Kin28, and with Kin28 overexpression. Despite the report of a physical interaction (20.Korsisaari N. Makela T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34837-34840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), none of the phenotypes correlate with the absence of Hnt1 protein but, rather, with loss of Hnt1 enzymatic activity. We also demonstrate that Hnt1 and mammalian Hint are enzymes that hydrolyze unusual adenosine nucleotides such as AMPNH2 to AMP plus a presumptive ammonia leaving group and that the active-site histidine we show biochemically to be required for AMPNH2 hydrolysis is required for biological function and not required for protein stability. Though rabbit Hint is only 22% identical to yeast Hnt1, the enzymatic activity of Hint is substantially the same as that of Hnt1, and expression of the rabbit enzyme fully suppressed all hnt1Δ phenotypes. These data suggested that accumulation of an Hnt1 substrate in hnt1deletion strains, likely an unusual adenosine mononucleotide and/or a nucleotidylated protein substrate, may inhibit function of Cak1 or Kin28 such that either protein kinase cannot tolerate mutational destabilization in itself or the other molecule. Though Cak1 has an unusual ATP-binding site, we show that strains without Cak1 are strongly Hnt1 and Hnt1 active-site-dependent, and thus, Cak1 is not the target of Hnt1 regulation. Thus, the findings that Hnt1 enzyme activity is limiting for growth of cells with increased Kin28 abundance, reduced Kin28 phosphorylation, and destabilization of Kin28 or the additional TFIIK components Ccl1 and Tfb3 reveal an unanticipated nucleotide-dependent form of Kin28 regulation. Standard yeast media, growth conditions, and genetic manipulations were used (35.Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1994: 133-139Google Scholar). Galactose-containing media (Gal) contained 2% galactose, whereas galactose plus raffinose-containing media (GalRaf) contained in addition 1% raffinose. To create diploid yeast strains heterozygous for hnt1 deletion, primers 4748 (primer sequences are provided in Table II, which is available as supplemental material) and 4749 were used to amplify a TRP1 fragment (plasmid pRS414 (36.Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2623) Google Scholar) as template) and a URA3 fragment (plasmid pRS416 (36.Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D.

Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4936-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on synthetic dextrose complete (SDC) −trp media and SDC −ura media and screened using diagnostic PCR primers HNT1–5 and HNT1–3. A trp+ isolate heterozygous for hnt1 disruption named BY1 and a ura+ isolate heterozygous for hnt1 disruption named BY8 were allowed to sporulate, and tetrads were dissected, generating haploid hnt1Δ progeny including BY1-2a, BY8-3b, BY8-4a, and BY8-5c. Additionally, a hnt1Δ::kanMX4PCR product generated with primers 4748 and 4749 and plasmid pRS400 as template (36.Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2623) Google Scholar) was used to transform haploid wild-type MATα wild-type strain GF312-17c (28.Thuret J.Y. Valay J.G. Faye G. Mann C. Cell. 1996; 86: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and MATa cdc28-4 strain GF2412 to geneticin resistance to produce hnt1Δ:kanMX4 strain BY158 and hnt1Δ::kanMX4 cdc28-4 strain BY169. Strain BY8-3b was crossed with kin28-ts2 strain JGV117, kin28-ts3 strain JGV105, kin28-ts7 strain JGV111, and kin28-ts8 strain JGV112 (38.Valay J.G. Simon M. Faye G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) to generate four strains heterozygous for hnt1Δ and kin28 alleles named BK2, BK3, BK7, and BK8, respectively, which were dissected to yield hnt1Δ kin28 double mutant haploid progeny including BK2-2a, BK3-8b, BK7-1c, and BK8-2a. To introduce hnt1Δ into the cak1-civ1ts4background, hnt1Δ strain BY158 was mated with cak1 strain GF2351 (28.Thuret J.Y. Valay J.G. Faye G. Mann C. Cell. 1996; 86: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and a double mutant strain BY161 was obtained by tetrad dissection. This strain was back-crossed to wild-type strain SEY6210 (37.Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4936-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar), and strain BY164 of genotype hnt1Δ cak1-civ1ts4 was obtained by tetrad dissection. To generate strain BY185 of genotype hnt1Δ::kanMX4 cdc28Δ0 cak1Δ0 kin28Δ0 carrying CDC28-4324 and alleles of KIN28 on a plasmid, wild-type diploid strain SEY6210.5 (37.Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4936-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) was disrupted with a PCR-generated cdc28Δ::loxP-kanMX-loxPdisruption cassette generated by amplification of plasmid pUG6 (39.Guldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar) with primers 5122 and 5123. The cdc28Δ::loxP-kanMX-loxP heterozygous diploid strain BY172 was confirmed by amplification with diagnostic primers 5126 and 5127 and then transformed with plasmid pSH47, which expresses cre recombinase from the GAL1 promoter (39.Guldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). A geneticin-sensitive derivative of genotype cdc28Δ0/CDC28 was cured of plasmid pSH47, named strain BY173, and subjected to transplacement of cak1Δ::loxP-kanMX-loxP using primers 5124 and 5125. Heterozygosity for the cak1 disruption in strain BY175 was confirmed with primers 5130 and 5131, and the cak1Δ0 allele was recovered in strain BY176 as above. kin28Δ::loxP-kanMX-loxP replacement of strain BY176 was accomplished with primers 5132 and 5133 and confirmed with primers 5134 and 5135 to generate strain BY177, whose geneticin-sensitive kin28Δ0 derivative was named strain BY178. This strain was transformed with a YCp TRP1 plasmid carrying CDC28-4324 (40.Cross F.R. Levine K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2923-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and pB192, which expresses URA3 and KIN28-T162A, and subjected to tetrad dissection. Segregant BY178-6a scored as trp+ and ura+ and, additionally, 5-fluoroorotic acid-sensitive and contained cdc28Δ0, cak1Δ0 and kin28Δ0 disruption alleles, as evidenced by diagnostic PCR. This strain was used to derive the hnt1Δ::kanMX4 disruptant BY185 using primers 4748 and 4749, as confirmed by diagnostic primers HNT1–5 and HNT1–3. LEU2 plasmids pB164, pB165 and pB183, which express KIN28, KIN28-T162A, and KIN28-T162E, respectively, were then transformed into strain BY185 with eviction of plasmid pB192. To generate a ccl1-ts4 hnt1Δ double mutant and a tfb3-rig2ts23 hnt1Δ double mutant, hnt1Δ strain BY8–4a was mated with ccl1-ts4 strain GF2093 (41.Valay J.G. Dubois M.F. Bensaude O. Faye G. C. R. Acad. Sci. Ser. III Life Sci. 1996; 319: 183-189PubMed Google Scholar) and tfb3-rig2ts23 strain GF2217 (42.Faye G. Simon M. Valay J.G. Fesquet D. Facca C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) to generate diheterozygous diploid strains BK10 and BK13, respectively. Diploids were allowed to sporulate, and tetrads were dissected, yielding double mutant segregants BK10-5a and BK13-1c, respectively. To generate strain BY155–8c of genotype hnt1Δkin28Δ carrying alleles of KIN28 on a plasmid, a kin28Δ::kanMX4 construct was generated with primers 5046 and 5047 and plasmid pRS400 as template (36.Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2623) Google Scholar). Diheterozygous strain BY155, whose genotype was confirmed by diagnostic PCR with primers 5048 and 5049, was then transformed with URA3 KIN28 plasmid pB192. Isolate BY155-8c was obtained by tetrad dissection and, after transformation with plasmids pB164 or pB165 containing LEU2 and KIN28 or KIN28-T162A, was cured of plasmid pB192. Haploid strain YGL26 (34.Kimmelman J. Kaldis P. Hengartner C.J. Laff G.M. Koh S.S. Young R.A. Solomon M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4774-4787Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) of genotype kin28Δ, expressing HA-tagged Kin28 from plasmid pGK13 (32.Cismowski M.J. Laff G.M. Solomon M.J. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell.

Escherichia coli strain XL-1 Blue was used for bacterial cloning and plasmid amplification. Bacterial media and standard molecular biology techniques were as described (43.Ausubel F.M. Brent R.

All plasmid constructions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. To create plasmid pB42 containing HNT1 for expression in yeast with its endogenous promoter, genomic DNA from strain SEY6210 (37.Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4936-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) was amplified using primers 4787 and 4795. The amplified product was cleaved with BamHI and KpnI, and cloned into BamHI and KpnI-digested pRS423 (44.Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene. 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar) to generate plasmid pB42. Plasmid pB150 was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (45.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) of pB4 using primer 5052 to generate the hnt1-H116A allele. To create plasmid pB159 containing rabbit HINT under the control of the GAL1 promoter, HINT cDNA was amplified from pSGA02-HINT (2.Gilmour J. Liang N. Lowenstein J.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) using primers 5085 and 5086. The product was then digested with BamHI and XhoI and cloned into BamHI and XhoI-cleaved plasmid pRS425GAL1 (46.Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). To create plasmid pB216 containing HNT1 with a C-terminal triple FLAG tag (47.Herren B. Pech M. J. Recept. Res. 1993; 13: 725-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) for expression in yeast, HNT1 was amplified with primers HNT1–5 and 5190, and the BamHI- and XhoI-cleaved product was cloned into BamHI- and XhoI-cleaved pRS413 (36.Brachmann C.B.

To create plasmid pB24 containing the HNT1 cDNA in plasmid pSGA02 (48.Ghosh S. Lowenstein J.M. Gene. 1997; 176: 249-255Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) for bacterial expression, primers 4739 and 4740 were used to amplify a product from oligo(dT)-primed yeast cDNA, which was digested with NdeI and XhoI and cloned into NdeI- and XhoI-cleaved pSGA02. To create plasmid pB195 containing HNT1-H116A for bacterial expression, plasmid pB24 was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis using primer 4766.

Mutagenesis of pB164 using primer 5116 generated pB183 containing KIN28-T162E.

Rabbit and yeast Hint proteins were expressed in E. coli from plasmids pSGA02-HINT (2.Gilmour J. Liang N. Lowenstein J.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), pB24 (HNT1), and pB194 (hnt1-H116A) according to published procedure (2.Gilmour J. Liang N. Lowenstein J.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Frozen and thawed cell pellets (250 mg wet weight) were lysed in 12.5 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) with one EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and further cleared after precipitation with 1 mg of protamine sulfate. Ammonium sulfate was added to 40% saturation, and the 40% ammonium sulfate pellet was dialyzed against buffer A and clarified by centrifugation. Rabbit Hint and yeast Hnt1-His116Ala were purified by AMP-agarose (Sigma) affinity chromatography using a 4-ml column, washing with 24 column volumes of buffer A, and eluting with 3 column volumes of buffer A with 200 μm adenosine for Hint and 10 mmadenosine for Hnt1-H116A. Yeast Hnt1 was purified on a POROS 20 HQ column (PE Biosystems) using 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2% glycerol as a loading and running buffer, and NaCl as an eluant. Homogenous enzyme preparations were dialyzed against buffer A, concentrated to 10 mg/ml, and stored at −80 °C. Compounds tested as potential substrates were from Sigma, except AMP-N-alanine methyl ester and AMP-N-ε-(N-α-acetyl lysine methyl ester), which were synthesized according to a modification of the synthesis of AMP-N-ε-lysine (49.Rossomando E.F.

These derivatives inhibit the integration reaction in vitro with a strong specificity for the 3′-end joining step. They are also antiviral and inhibit integration in vivo. The aim of the present study has been to investigate the molecular interactions between DKAs and HIV-1 integrase. We have compared 5CITEP with one of the most potent DKAs reported by the Merck group (L-708,906) and found that 5CITEP inhibits 3′-processing at concentrations where L-708,906 is only active on strand transfer. We also report a novel bifunctional DKA derivative that inhibits 3′-processing even more effectively than 5CITEP. The interactions of these inhibitors with the viral DNA donor ends have been studied by performing experiments with oligonucleotides containing defined modifications. We propose that the bifunctional DKA derivative binds to both the acceptor and donor sites of HIV-1 integrase, whereas the monofunctional L-708,906 derivative binds selectively to the acceptor site.

However, these treatments do not suppress viral replication in all patients, and the virus can remain active in some host tissues (cellular reservoirs) (1.Richman D.D. Nature. 2001; 410: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). It is therefore logical to look for agents that inhibit different viral targets, such as integrase. Following viral entry and reverse transcription, HIV-1 viral DNA copies are integrated into host cell chromosomes. Integration is required for viral replication and is catalyzed by integrase, a viral enzyme encoded by the pol gene (Fig. 1A) and generated after proteolysis of the gag-pol fusion protein precursor by the HIV-1 protease (for review, see Refs. 2.Pommier Y. Pilon A.A. Bajaj K. Mazumder A. Neamati N. Antivir. Chem. Chemother. 1997; 8: 463-483Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 3.Brown P.O. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses.

Academic Press, San Diego, CA1999: 52Google Scholar). Fig. 1 summarizes the reaction catalyzed by HIV-1 integrase in vivo (panel A) and in vitro (panel B). In the cytoplasm, integrase catalyzes the removal of a GT dinucleotide immediately 3′ from a conserved CA dinucleotide at the 3′-end of both extremities of the viral genome (U3 and U5 long terminal repeats). After this first step, called 3′-processing, integrase remains bound to the long terminal repeats, and this preintegration complex (5.Bowerman B. Brown P.O. Bishop J.M. Varmus H.E. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 6.Farnet C.M. Haseltine W.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1910-1915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Miller M.D. Farnet C.M. Bushman F.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 5382-5390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) migrates to the nucleus where the second step of the integration reaction (3′-end joining or strand transfer) occurs. The 3′-end joining reaction consists of the direct nucleophilic attack of the 3′-recessed viral ends (donor DNA) on the host chromosome (acceptor DNA). Both termini of the viral DNA, which are kept in close proximity, integrate with a 5-bp stagger toward the 5′-ends of the target chromosomal DNA. Completion of the integration process requires removal of the two unpaired nucleotides at the 5′-ends of the viral DNA and gap-filling, probably accomplished by cellular enzymes. The integration reaction can be reproduced and monitored in vitro using recombinant HIV-1 integrase and a radiolabeled DNA substrate (Fig. 1B). In this assay, a 21-mer double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide corresponding to the 21 last bases of the U5 viral long terminal repeat, is used as substrate to follow both the 3′-processing and the strand transfer reactions. The 3′-processing reaction generates a 19-mer-labeled product, which can be integrated in another 21-mer double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide substrate during the strand transfer reaction. The integration can occur at different positions on the acceptor DNA molecule and leads to several reaction products migrating slower and faster than the original 21-mer substrate. We used the higher molecular weight species (Fig. 1B, right panel) to quantify the strand transfer products (for review, see Ref. 8.Marchand C. Neamati N. Pommier Y. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 340: 624-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Many HIV-1 integrase inhibitors have been identified in the past few years using recombinant integrase (9.De Clercq E. Med. Res. Rev. 2000; 20: 323-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 10.d'Angelo J. Mouscadet J.F. Desmaele D. Zouhiri F. Leh H. Pathol. Biol.

Marchand C. Neamati N. Antiviral Res. 2000; 47: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and recently a new family of antiviral inhibitors has been reported, the β-diketo acids (DKAs)1 (13.Hazuda D.J. Felock P.

The DKAs such as L-708,906 (Fig. 2A) exhibit potent activity against HIV-1 integrase in vitro and have the remarkable property of being selective for strand transfer. These compounds also reduce viral replication in cell culture. The validation of HIV-1 integrase as the target of DKAs was demonstrated by the selection of drug-resistant viruses bearing mutations in their integrase gene (13.Hazuda D.J. Felock P. Witmer M. Wolfe A. Stillmock K. Grobler J.A. Espesath A. Gabryelski L. Schlelf W. Blau C. Miller M.D. Science. 2000; 287: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). 5CITEP is another inhibitor whose structure resembles that of DKAs (Fig. 2A and Ref. 14.Goldgur Y. Craigie R. Cohen G.H. Fujiwara T. Yoshinaga T. Fujishita T. Sugimoto H. Endo T. Murai H. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13040-13043Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The carboxylic group of DKAs corresponds to the tetrazole of 5CITEP, which can be considered as an isosteric acid replacement. Interestingly, Davies and co-workers (14.Goldgur Y. Craigie R. Cohen G.H. Fujiwara T. Yoshinaga T. Fujishita T. Sugimoto H. Endo T. Murai H. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular interactions between DKAs and HIV-1 integrase. We have compared 5CITEP with one of the most potent DKAs (L-708,906) reported by the Merck group and found that 5CITEP inhibits 3′-processing at concentrations where L-708,906 is only active on strand transfer. 2C. G. Pais, X. Zhang, C. Marchand, N. Neamati, E. S. Svarosvkaia, V. K. Pathak, Y. Pommier, and T. R. J. Burke, manuscript in preparation. We also report a novel bifunctional DKA derivative that inhibits 3′-processing even more effectively than 5CITEP. The interactions of these inhibitors with the viral DNA donor ends have been studied by performing experiments with oligonucleotides containing defined modifications. We propose that the bifunctional DKA derivative binds to both the acceptor and donor sites of HIV-1 integrase, whereas the monofunctional L-708,906 derivative binds selectively to the acceptor site. Oligonucleotides were purchased from IDT Inc. (Coralville, IA) and purified on a 20% (19:1) denaturing polyacrylamide gel using UV shadow. Purified oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled by T4-polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) as described previously (8.Marchand C. Neamati N. Pommier Y. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 340: 624-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The synthesis of DKAs and 5CITEP derivatives will be described in detail.2 Unless otherwise indicated, the integrase-DNA complexes were preformed (16.Hazuda D.J. Wolfe A.L. Hastings J.C. Robbins H.L.

Inhibitors were then added to the reactions in a final volume of 10 μl, and integration reactions were carried out for 1 h at 37 °C. Reactions were quenched by adding 10 μl of denaturing loading dye. Samples were loaded onto a 20% (19:1) denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Gels were exposed overnight and analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (Sunnyvale, CA). The densitometric analysis was performed using ImageQuant from the Molecular Dynamics software package. Each lane was quantified to determine the amount of 3′-processing and strand transfer products, which were expressed as a fraction of the total radioactivity. Percentage of inhibition was computed using the integrase control (lane O in Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5and 7) as a reference. The Schiff base assay was performed as described previously (8.Marchand C. Neamati N. Pommier Y. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 340: 624-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17.Mazumder A.

Briefly, uracil-containing oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled and annealed to their complementary strand. The resulting duplexes were then treated by 1 unit of uracil DNA glycosylase (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37 °C to generate an abasic site. Drugs were incubated in a total volume of 10 μl with 1.5 μm HIV-1 integrase and 5 nm5′-end-labeled abasic site-containing DNA template for 30 min at 37 °C in a buffer containing 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 7.5 mm MnCl2, and 14.3 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Integrase-DNA cross-links were then reduced by treatment with 1 μl of 1 m sodium borohydride. After 5 min at room temperature, samples were treated with one volume of 2× SDS-tricine loading buffer, heated 5 min at 95 °C, and loaded on 12–20% tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). We first compared the inhibition of HIV-1 integrase by one of the previously published DKAs, L-708,906 (13.Hazuda D.J. Felock P. Witmer M. Wolfe A. Stillmock K. Grobler J.A. Espesath A. Gabryelski L. Schlelf W. Blau C. Miller M.D. Science. 2000; 287: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar) and 5CITEP (Ref. 14.Goldgur Y. Craigie R. Cohen G.H. Fujiwara T. Yoshinaga T. Fujishita T. Sugimoto H. Endo T. Murai H. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13040-13043Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholarand Fig. 2A). Fig. 1B shows that both compounds inhibit the strand transfer step of the integration reaction and are markedly less effective on the 3′-processing step. Their IC50 values for strand transfer (concentrations that inhibit 50% of reaction) were comparable: 0.42 and 0.65 μm for L-708,906 and 5CITEP, respectively (Fig. 2A). However, their IC50 for 3′-processing differed significantly: >1000 and 35 μm for L-708,906 and 5CITEP, respectively. Thus, L-708,906 is more selective for strand transfer than 5CITEP by at least 40-fold (Fig. 2, panels B and C). Fig. 2D shows a schematic representation of the general structure of DKAs, in which the R1 function is an acidic group and R2 an aromatic function. The two published compounds bear different acidic extremities (carboxylate versus tetrazole for L-708,906 and 5CITEP, respectively, Fig. 2A). To investigate the influence of this acidic function on HIV-1 integrase inhibition, we tested a 5CITEP analog in which the tetrazole group was replaced with a carboxylate (Fig. 3A). This new compound (DKA1) inhibited HIV-1 integrase similarly to 5CITEP (Fig. 3, B and C), indicating that the carboxyl and tetrazole functions are equivalent. Because DKA1 and L-708,906 are only different in their aromatic moiety (Fig. 2D), the difference observed for 3′-processing inhibition and selectivity for strand transfer for both compounds must be driven by this aromatic group. To elucidate the role of the aromatic portion of DKAs for strand transfer selectivity, we have designed derivatives of L-708,906 in which the aromatic moieties have been modified.2 Among them, the derivative with the most dramatic effect, DKA2, is presented in Fig. 4. In this molecule, the aromatic portion has been modified to bear a second diketo acidic side chain. This bifunctional DKA remained very effective on strand transfer (Fig. 4A) but inhibited 3′-processing with an IC50below 10 μm, whereas L-708,906 was ineffective even at 1 mm (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, quantitation (Fig. 4C) revealed an accumulation of 3′-processing products for both compounds. The level of products decreased around 10 μm for DKA2 (IC50 for 3′-processing), whereas it reached a plateau above 1 μm for L708,906 (Fig. 4C). These data demonstrate that the aromatic portion of L-708,906 is responsible for strand transfer selectivity and that introducing a second diketo acid side chain renders the compound effective for 3′-processing. Although all the previous results had been obtained by incubating the drug with preassembled enzyme-DNA complexes (16.Hazuda D.J. Wolfe A.L. Hastings J.C. Robbins H.L. Graham P.L. LaFemina R.L. Emini E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3999-4004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see “Materials and Methods”), we next investigated the activity of the DKAs when they were incubated first with the enzyme. For this purpose, we designed two protocols (Fig. 5A). In protocol 1, integrase-DNA complexes were formed in the absence of the drug for 15 min on ice in order to prevent catalysis. The drug was then added and the integration reaction initiated by placing the samples at 37 °C for 1 h. In protocol 2, the drug was preincubated with HIV-1 integrase for 15 min at 37 °C. Then the DNA was added, and reactions were continued for an additional hour. Fig. 5 (panels B and C) shows that both L-708,906 and DKA2 inhibit strand transfer similarly in protocols 1 and 2. Preincubation with the enzyme (as in protocol 2) reduced the selectivity of L-708,906 for strand transfer by more than one order of magnitude (Fig. 5B). Under such conditions, L-708,906 inhibited 3′-processing almost totally at 1 mm (Fig. 5B, lane 15). Thus, our results demonstrate that both mono- and bifunctional diketo acids inhibit the strand transfer activity of HIV-1 integrase independently of the order of addition and that moderate 3′-processing inhibitory activity can be observed when the monofunctional DKA (L-708,906) was preincubated with integrase in the absence of DNA. To determine whether the inhibitory effect of the bifunctional compound DKA2 on 3′-processing was due to interactions with the donor DNA, we performed DNA binding experiments using the Schiff base assay (17.Mazumder A. Neamati N. Pilon A.A. Sunder S. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27330-27338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this assay (Fig. 6A), a DNA substrate containing a uracil is treated by uracil DNA glycosylase in order to generate an abasic site at a defined position on the oligonucleotide. When incubated with HIV-1 integrase, a Schiff base is generated between an appropriately positioned ε-amino group of a lysine present on the enzyme and the aldehydic abasic site. The DNA-protein complex is then covalently trapped (cross-linked) by reduction with sodium borohydride (17.Mazumder A. Neamati N. Pilon A.A. Sunder S. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27330-27338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this set of experiments the same two preincubation conditions were examined (Fig. 5, protocols 1 and 2) using two different cross-linking positions (Fig. 6B, oligo 1 and 2). Using protocol 1, neither of the two DKAs inhibited DNA cross-linking (Fig. 6C). Similarly, L-708,906 had no effect on DNA cross-linking using protocol 2 (Fig. 6C). By contrast, using protocol 2, DKA2 inhibited HIV-1 integrase cross-linking with both oligonucleotides 1 and 2 (Fig. 6C). Our interpretation of the different results observed with DKA2 in the two protocols is that the Schiff base between integrase and its substrate is probably already formed during the preincubation on ice (protocol 1), prior to the addition of the drug. If DKA2 is added before the DNA, it forms a tight complex with the enzyme, which prevents binding of the DNA substrate. Our results demonstrate that the bifunctional molecule DKA2 can prevent the binding of the donor DNA, whereas the monofunctional L-708,906 does not. We next investigated the influence of the DNA structure at the extremity of the donor DNA. For this purpose, we used a pre-cleaved substrate (Fig. 7A) that mimics the 3′-processed substrate and allows monitoring of the strand transfer reaction without any interference from 3′-processing efficiency. To estimate the influence of the two unpaired nucleotides present on the non-cleaved DNA strand after 3′-processing, we also used a precleaved substrate in which the terminal base at the 5′-end on the non-cleaved strand had been replaced by an abasic site (Fig. 7A). The efficiency of inhibition of strand transfer by the monofunctional DKA L-708,906 was decreased by ∼10-fold when using the precleaved substrate and by ∼30-fold when using the abasic site-containing precleaved substrate (Fig. 7, B and C). These results demonstrate the importance of the DNA structure near the 3′-processing cleavage site for the inhibition of strand transfer by L-708,906 and suggest an interaction between L-708,906 and the 3′-nucleophilic site of the donor DNA within the HIV-1 integrase-DNA complex. To date, DKAs represent the most promising class of HIV-1 integrase inhibitors. In this study, we have demonstrated that the two previously published compounds L-708,906 (13.Hazuda D.J. Felock P. Witmer M. Wolfe A. Stillmock K. Grobler J.A. Espesath A. Gabryelski L. Schlelf W. Blau C. Miller M.D. Science. 2000; 287: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar) and 5CITEP (14.Goldgur Y. Craigie R. Cohen G.H. Fujiwara T. Yoshinaga T. Fujishita T. Sugimoto H. Endo T. Murai H. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13040-13043Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A) belong to the same family, because the tetrazole group in the acidic extremity of 5CITEP can be replaced by a carboxylate. Additional evidence for this conclusion will be reported in a structure-activity study.2 We find that 5CITEP and L-708,906 exhibit a different selectivity for strand transfer, which may indicate a distinct mechanism of action (and enzyme binding) for both compounds. 5CITEP inhibits 3′-processing with an IC50 of 35 μm (Fig. 2A), whereas L-708,906 does not inhibit but rather enhances 3′-processing (Fig. 4C). This enhancement is probably a consequence of the selective strand transfer inhibition with accumulation of the 3′-processing product. The two compounds have the same central diketo function but have different aromatic and acidic extremities. The acidic moiety cannot be held responsible for the selectivity difference because DKA1, which bears a carboxylate, exhibited the same potency as 5CITEP for 3′-processing. Therefore, the aromatic portion of the molecule determines the selectivity for strand transfer. This conclusion is further supported by the marked enhancement of the 3′-processing inhibitory activity exhibited by the bifunctional diketo acid DKA2, an analog of L-708,906 in which the aromatic portion has been reduced to a benzene ring bearing a second diketo chain (Fig. 4). The presence of an electronegative group on the DKA aromatic portion (Fig. 2D), i.e. a halogen or a carboxylate for 5CITEP and DKA2, respectively, appears to confer 3′-processing activity without affecting strand transfer inhibition.2 We have also found that DKA2 inhibited donor substrate binding (Fig. 6), demonstrating that this compound can compete with the donor DNA, whereas L-708,906 does not. The inhibition of 3′-processing and donor DNA binding by the bifunctional DKA2 but not by the monofunctional L-708,906 suggests that the second acidic function binds to the enzyme site that catalyzes 3′-processing. We refer to this site as the donor site. We have found that the inhibitory activity of the monofunctional L-708,906 is decreased with substrates modified at their 3′-processing end. This was observed with a precleaved substrate and even further with an abasic site-containing precleaved substrate (Fig. 7,B and C). This suggests that L-708,906 binds near the nucleophilic end of the donor DNA, which would then inhibit strand transfer by interfering with and binding to an acceptor site where the enzyme catalyzes the nucleophilic attack of the 3′-OH end of the donor DNA toward the phosphodiester bond of the acceptor DNA. We have proposed a distinct mode of binding for the mono- and bifunctional diketo acid derivatives. Because viral integrases catalyze the insertion of a donor DNA substrate into an acceptor DNA template, both DNA duplexes probably bind two adjacent sites. In our model (Fig. 8), monofunctional DKAs such as L-708,906 bind only to the acceptor site. Consequently, they do not inhibit 3′-processing and cannot compete for binding with the donor DNA (15.Espeseth A.S. Felock P. Wolfe A. Witmer M. Grobler J. Anthony N. Egbertson M. Melamed J.Y.

By contrast, the bifunctional DKA2 could bind both the donor and acceptor sites. At low concentration they would preferentially bind to the acceptor site, and at higher concentration they would bind to the donor site. Because no donor DNA was present in the co-crystal structure of 5CITEP-HIV-1 integrase obtained by Goldgur et al. (14.Goldgur Y. Craigie R. Cohen G.H. Fujiwara T. Yoshinaga T. Fujishita T.

A. 1999; 96: 13040-13043Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), this structure may represent the drug bound to the donor site of the enzyme."

These include wide-spread environmental pollutants such as polycyclic and halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH, HAH) and aromatic amines. Many of these ligands are known to be potent carcinogens. The principal role AHR plays in PAH carcinogenesis is via induction of several cytochrome P450s by the ligand-bound AHR/ARNT. These cytochrome P450s can convert PAHs into genotoxic electrophilic derivatives. HAHs such as TCDD act as tumor promoters (non-genotoxic carcinogens) rather than tumor initiators. TCDD is resistant to metabolism and has a long half-life in the organism, and it is likely that most of its toxic and carcinogenic effects are attributable to prolonged activation of the AHR/ARNT leading to abnormalities in gene expression (1.Hankinson O. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 307-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). Endogenous ligands have been postulated for AHR, suggesting an important role for the receptor in physiological settings. Indeed, AHR-null mice show defects in liver development, a compromised immune system, and impairment of retinoic acid metabolism (9.Fernandez-Salguero P. Pineau T. Hilbert D.M. McPhail T. Lee S.S.

It is thus evident that AHR-regulated transcription plays a pivotal role in mediating the toxic effects of many environmental pollutants and perhaps also normal physiological functions. Most of our knowledge of AHR/ARNT-regulated transcription comes from studies of the induction of the cytochrome 4501A1 (CYP1A1) gene by TCDD (12.Whitlock J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

A cluster of XREs functioning as an enhancer is located ∼1 kb upstream of the transcription initiation start site. The promoter region of the gene, located within 300 bp of the transcription initiation site assumes a nucleosomal configuration (13.Morgan J.E. Whitlock J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11622-11626Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Following the occupation of the enhancer region by liganded AHR/ARNT, chromatin remodeling occurs over the promoter region, allowing the RNA polymerase II transcription pre-initiation complex to interact with this region and to activate transcription (14.Ko H.P. Okino S.T. Ma Q. Whitlock J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 15.Okino S.T. Whitlock J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3714-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This sequence of events, which is dependent on both AHR and ARNT, requires the transcription activation domain (TAD) of AHR (14.Ko H.P. Okino S.T. Ma Q. Whitlock J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The transcription activation domain of ARNT plays a less prominent role (14.Ko H.P. Okino S.T. Ma Q. Whitlock J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 16.Fukunaga B.N. Probst M.R. Reisz-Porszasz S. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31845-31854Google Scholar). AHR has a potent and complex transcription activation domain. The TAD of human AHR consists of three subdomains: an acidic domain, a glutamine-rich (Q-rich) domain, and a proline/serine/threonine-rich domain (17.Rowlands J.C. McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 538-548PubMed Google Scholar). The Q-rich domain has been shown to be capable of interacting with the coactivator/corepressor protein RIP140 (18.Kumar M.B. Tarpey R.W. Perdew G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22155-22164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The coactivator proteins CBP/p300 (19.Kobayashi A. Numayama-Tsuruta K. Sogawa K.

Hankinson, unpublished results. NCoA-2 and p/CIP2 have also been implicated in AHR/ARNT-mediated transcription. All these coactivators can enhance AHR/ARNT-mediated transcription in reporter gene assays. As mentioned above, transcription activation of the CYP1A1 gene involves alleviation of nucleosomal repression over the promoter region. At least two general types of chromatin remodeling factors/complexes have been shown to be recruited to promoters by transcription activators (21.Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 15: 2339-2352Crossref Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 22.Kornberg R.D. Lorch Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 285-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). One type possesses histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, and includes yeast GCN5 (23.Brownell J.E. Zhou J.X. Ranalli T. Kobayashi R. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 84: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar), and the aforementioned mammalian coactivators, SRC-1, NCoA-2, p/CIP, and CBP/p300 (24.Ogryzko V.V.

These coactivators acetylate histones on their N-terminal tails thereby reducing histone-DNA affinity and nucleosome-nucleosome interactions (27.Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6679) Google Scholar). Another type consists of multisubunit protein complexes containing an ATPase subunit and utilizes ATP to disrupt histone-DNA interactions and drive histone octamer transfer (28.Whitehouse I. Flaus A. Cairns B.R. White M.F. Workman J.L. Owen-Hughes T. Nature. 1999; 400: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 29.Lorch Y. Zhang M. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1999; 96: 389-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The ATPase complexes are further divided into three groups, based upon whether the ATPase subunit is more related to the yeast SWI2/SNF2 protein (yeast SWI/SNF, yeast RSC, human SWI/SNF, Brahma complexes), Drosophila ISWI (ISW1, ISW2, human RSF, Drosophila NURF, Drosophila ACF complexes), and human Mi-2 (human NURD and xMi-2 complexes) (30.Fry C.J. Peterson C.L. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R185-R197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The ATPase activities of the mammalian SWI/SNF multisubunit complexes are conferred either by the BRG-1 or Brm proteins, which are related to the yeast SW12/SNF2 protein. Both BRG-1 and Brm can interact with certain steroid hormone receptors, such as GR (31.Fryer C.J. Archer T.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), ER (32.DiRenzo J. Shang Y. Phelan M. Sif S. Myers M. Kingston R. Brown M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7541-7549Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and enhance their transactivational potential. Furthermore, mammalian SWI/SNF-like complexes have been shown to associate with a number of transcription factors, including c-Myc (33.Cheng S.W. Davies K.P. Yung E. Beltran R.J. Yu J. Kalpana G.V. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), EKLF (34.Kadam S. McAlpine G.S. Phelan M.L. Kingston R.E. Jones K.A. Emerson B.M.

Genome-wide studies of mutants deleted for genes encoding certain components of the SWI/SNF complex in yeast reveals that the yeast SWI/SNF complex controls only a small fraction of genes and acts at the individual gene level rather than over extended chromosomal domains.

BRG-1 and other subunits of mammalian SWI/SNF complexes are also found associated with Rb and histone deacetylases and exert transcriptional repression (39.Zhang H.S. Gavin M. Dahiya A. Postigo A.A.

Together, these observations indicate that BRG-1 or Brm containing SWI/SNF complexes actively engage in a wide range of cellular activities during development and proliferation. In this work, we examined the possible involvement of mammalian SWI/SNF complexes in AHR/ARNT-mediated CYP1A1 gene expression. This is the first reported investigation on the role of an ATPase containing chromatin-remodeling factor in transcription activation by AHR/ARNT and has important implications for chemical carcinogenesis and other cellular responses mediated by AHR/ARNT. pBJ5-BRG-1 and pBJ5-BRG-1(K785R) were kind gifts of Dr. Myles Brown. pCMX-SRC-1 and pCMX-CBP were kind gifts from Dr. Michael G. Rosenfeld. pT-hAHR was made by cloning human AHR cDNA into pTARGET vector (Promega). Reporter gene pGL-CYP1A1 contains 2.6 kb of the regulatory sequence of the rat CYP1A1 gene, including the enhancer and promoter region and the transcriptional initiation site. The minimal XRE-promoter luciferase reporter construct (pGL-XRE) was a kind gift of Dr. Dianne Duncan. To construct glutathione S-transferase (GST)-hAHR and GST-ARNT TAD deletion mutants, individual domains were amplified by PCR and inserted into the EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites of the pGEX-5X-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The SW-13 adrenal carcinoma cells and the C33A cervical carcinoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum (Omega),l-glutamine (Invitrogen), fungizone, and penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The Hepa1c1c7 strain and the c4 mutant derived from Hepa1c1c7 were grown in minimal essential media α under the same conditions as above. Transfections of expression plasmids were performed using SuperFect reagent (Qiagen). For Hepa1c1c7 cells, a dual-luciferase system (Promega) was used. DNA mixtures of the indicated amount of pBJ5-BRG1 were cotransfected with 100 ng of Renilla luciferase reporter (pRL-TK) driven by the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter and 500 ng of pGL-CYP1A1 firefly luciferase reporter plasmid into six-well plates of Hepa1c1c7 cells. The final DNA concentrations were adjusted using empty expression vector to ensure equal amounts of DNA were used in each plate. After 16 h, transfected cells were treated with either TCDD or vehicle (Me2SO) for 24 h. Cells were then harvested and lysed in Passive lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activities were measured using luciferase assay reagent (Promega). The Renilla luciferase activity was used to normalize the firefly luciferase activity of each sample. For SW13 and C33A cells, DNA mixtures of the indicated amount of pBJ5-BRG1, pBJ5-BRG1-K785R, and pCMX-SRC-1 were cotransfected with 200 ng of pT-HAHR, 500 ng of pCMV-β-gal reporter, and 500 ng of either of pGL-CYP1A1 luciferase or pGL-XRE luciferase reporter plasmids into six-well plates of SW-13 cells or C33A cells. The final DNA concentrations were adjusted using empty expression vector to ensure equal amount of DNA was used in each plate. After 16 h, transfected cells were treated with either TCDD or Me2SO for 24 h. Cells were then harvested and lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activities were measured using luciferase assay reagent (BD PharMingen). The β-galactosidase activity was used to normalize the luciferase activity of each sample. All the transfection experiments were performed in triplicate. SW-13 and C33A cells were transfected by SuperFect (Qiagen) with plasmids (2 μg each) containing pTHAHR, pBJ5-BRG-1, or pBJ5-BRG-1 (K785R). The total amounts of plasmid were adjusted to 4 μg with the empty vector. After 24 h, transfected cells were treated with either TCDD or Me2SO for 12 h. Total RNA was prepared from cells transfected with expression plasmids using TRIzol (Invitrogen). 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using a Thermoscript Reverse Transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). PCR was performed with 4% of the RT reaction using Taq polymerase (Promega). For controls, similar procedures were followed except in that no reverse transcriptase was added and the reaction mixture was digested with RNaseH before the PCR amplification. The primer sets for RT-PCR are as follows: 5′-CCTGAATGCCTTCAAGGAC-3′ and 5′-ACGAAGGAAGAGTGTCGG-3′ for the human CYP1A1 gene; 5′-GGTGTCTGCTGGATAATTCATC-3′, and 5′-ACCCAAGTCCATCGGTTG-3′ for the human AHR; 5′-TCCATGTCACTGATCTTTCTGG-3′, 5′-TCAATCCGCCGATCTTC-3′ for the ribosomal S14 gene The procedure was adopted from that described by Brown and coworkers (32.DiRenzo J. Shang Y. Phelan M. Sif S. Myers M. Kingston R. Brown M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7541-7549Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Hepa1c1c7 or c4 cells were treated with TCDD to a final concentration of 10−8m for 40 min. Cross-linking was achieved by adding formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1% at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected in 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were pelleted at 700 ×g at 4 °C and resuspended in 0.3 ml of cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, Roche Complete protease inhibitor mixture) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cell lysates were sonicated to give a DNA size range from 200 to 900 bp. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were adjusted to give a final solution of 15 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmEDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture. The solutions were pre-cleared with 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose containing 2.5 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA for 2 h at 4 °C, and then treated with antibodies against either BRG-1 (a kind gift of Dr. Weidong Wang) or AHR overnight at 4 °C. 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose containing 2.5 μg of salmon sperm DNA and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin were then added to the solution for 1 h. The beads were pelleted and washed sequentially in the following buffers: buffer A (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.1), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100); buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100), and LiCl-detergent buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA), and TE buffer (twice). Immuno-complexes were extracted from the beads with 1% SDS-0.1 mNaHCO3. Cross-linking was reversed by heating the elutes at 65 °C overnight. The elutes were then digested with proteinase K at 45 °C for 1 h. The solutions were extracted with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol. DNA was purified by ethanol precipitation, and the region over the mCYP1A1 enhancer region (−1141 to −784 from the transcription initiation start site) was amplified by PCR. The primer sequences were 5′-CTATCTCTTAAACCCCACCCCAA-3′ and 5′-CTAAGTATGGTGGAGGAAAGGGTG-3′. GST fusion proteins were expressed in the bacterial strain BL-21. Cells were lysed using B-PER lysis buffer (Pierce). Cellular debris was pelleted at 60,000 × g in a SW41Ti rotor for 1 h at 2 °C. GST fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads by incubation at 4 °C for 3 h. Beads were then washed with a buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol. A small amount of individual hAHR TAD subdomain GST fusion protein was eluted off the beads in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The protein concentrations were determined by comparing to Coomassie Blue-stained bovine serum albumin. HEK293T cells were transfected with 10 μg of pBJ5-BRG-1. After 48 h, cells were lysed in Lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min on ice. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 16,100 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and adjusted to a buffer composition of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT. The cell lysate was then incubated with equimolar amounts of GST-hAHR TAD fusion protein in 40 μl of 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads for 5 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT. Protein complexes were eluted with SDS sample buffer and subjected to 6% SDS-PAGE and Western blot using the BRG-1 antibody. Enhancer-promoter communication and chromatin remodeling is a hallmark of CYP1A1 gene transcriptional activation. To test the potential involvement of ATP-dependent mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes in this process, we focused on the ATPase subunit BRG-1. Using a reporter gene pGL-CYP1A1, in which the luciferase gene was driven by a fragment extending from the transcriptional initiation site to 2.6 kb upstream of the rat CYP1A1 gene, we found that in the Hepa1c1c7 cell line, which has endogenous BRG-1 expression, BRG-1 potentiated AHR/ARNT-mediated transcription in a TCDD-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). In two cell lines that are defective in BRG-1 and Brm expression: the SW13 human adrenal carcinoma cell line and the C33A human cervical carcinoma cell line (41.Singh P. Coe J. Hong W. Nature. 1995; 374: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), BRG-1 also enhanced the AHR/ARNT-dependent reporter gene activity in a dose-dependent fashion, with an approximate 5-fold increase when the greatest amount of DNA was used (Fig. 1, B and D). This enhancement was AHR-dependent, because it could not be observed when exogenous AHR was not provided to SW-13 cells (Fig. 1C). (SW13 and C33A cells express ARNT (data not shown) but not AHR, see Fig. 3). Furthermore, enhancement was much less with a BRG-1 mutant defective in ATPase activity (Fig. 1, B and D). We also employed a different reporter gene system (pGL-XRE) in which the luciferase gene is driven by five XREs and a minimal promoter. As shown in Fig. 1E, BRG-1 was also able to augment the AHR-mediated transcription of this reporter gene in SW13 cells. This effectively addresses the concern that the enhancement may result from an effect of BRG-1 on other constitutive transcription factors whose binding sites are present in the regulatory region of the CYP1A1 gene.Figure 3BRG-1 is required for endogenous CYP1A1 expression. A, total RNAs were extracted from SW-13 cells and analyzed by RT-PCR with primers specific for human AHR or ribosomal protein S14. B, SW-13 cells were transfected with either pT-hAHR or pT-hAHR and pBJ5-BRG-1. After 24 h, transfected cells were treated with either TCDD or Me2SO for 12 h. Total RNAs were then extracted and analyzed by RT-PCR using primers specific for human CYP1A1, human AHR, or human ribosomal protein S14. C, SW-13 cells were transfected with either pBJ5-BRG-1 alone or pT-hAHR and pBJ5-BRG-1 (K785R). 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with either TCDD or Me2SO for 12 h. Total RNAs were extracted and analyzed by RT-PCR using primers specific for human CYP1A1 or human ribosomal protein S14. PCR amplifications failed to produce any bands representative of HAHR when previous RT reactions were carried out in the absence of reverse transcriptase and digested with RNaseH, indicating bands produced by PCR amplification for HAHR were result of mRNA from the transfected plasmid, not the plasmid DNA itself.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It should be noted that luciferase activity in the absence of TCDD was nearly as great as that in the presence of TCDD in the experiments performed in SW13 and C33A cells. A similarly reduced effect of exogenous ligand has been observed by ourselves and other investigators in analogous experiments using AHR/ARNT-dependent reporter genes (42.Matsushita N. Sogawa K. Ema M. Yoshida A. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21002-21006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Mason G.G. Witte A.M. Whitelaw M.L. Antonsson C. McGuire J. Wilhelmsson A. Poellinger L. Gustafsson J.A. J. Biol.

Puga A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the partial ligand independence observed in these experiments is that it is due to an unidentified endogenous ligand that is a substrate of CYP1A1 that accumulates in CYP1A1-deficient cells (45.Hankinson O.

https://openalex.org/W2132088700,"We report here the identification of a bacterial protein capable of interacting with mammalian death receptors in vitro and in vivo. The protein is encoded in the genome of trachomatis and has homologues in other species. This protein, which we refer to as Chlamydia protein associating with death (CADD), induces apoptosis in a variety of mammalian cell lines when expressed by transient gene transfection. Apoptosis induction can be blocked by Caspase inhibitors, indicating that CADD triggers cell death by engaging the host apoptotic machinery. CADD interacts with death domains of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family receptors TNFR1, Fas, DR4, and DR5 but not with the respective downstream adaptors. In infected epithelial cells, CADD is expressed late in the infectious cycle of C. trachomatis and co-localizes with Fas in the proximity of the inclusion body. The results suggest a role for CADD modulating the apoptosis pathways of cells infected, revealing a new mechanism of host-pathogen interaction."

New molecular tools are now needed to exploit fully the potential of germline transformation forAnopheles mosquitoes, with the aim of unraveling the interactions between host molecules and Plasmodiumparasites, as well as performing functional studies such as transposon tagging and enhancer trapping. Ultimately this technology could be used to develop transgenic mosquitoes with a nonpermissive phenotype for parasite development. These mosquitoes could be used in malaria control programs with the aim to replace the permissive wild type vectors. As shown in Drosophila melanogaster, the availability of various molecular and genetic tools to achieve germline transformation has contributed tremendously to our understanding of the fruit fly biology, leading to the identification of hundreds of genes involved in development, immunity, tissue modeling, and embryogenesis. The transposable elements P, Minos,piggyBac, and hermes have, among others, all been successfully used to drive integration of exogenous DNA into the fruit fly genome (8Rubin G.M. Spradling A.C.

At the same time, the use of an array of visible selectable markers, such as white, rosy,cinnabar, and more recently EGFP (12Warren W.D. Palmer S. Howells A.J.

Commun. 1996; 227: 707-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), has greatly facilitated the screening procedure and allowed complex functional studies of genes and their promoter regions. Germline transformation ofA. stephensi mosquitoes is anticipated to open a wide range of applications to explore the genome of these important disease vectors when sustained by a parallel development of appropriate molecular tools. So far the availability of a system for germline transformation based on the combination of a single transposable element with a single selectable marker has limited the array of applications of gene transfer technology in Anopheles. In this study, we have achieved germline transformation of A. stephensi mosquitoes by using the piggyBac transposable element, initially isolated in the cabbage looper Trichoplusia ni (2Fraser M.J. Ciszczon T. Elick T. Bauser C. Insect Mol. Biol. 1996; 5: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), to drive integration of foreign genes. Moreover, we have validated the use of the red fluorescent protein dsRED (3Matz M.V. Fradkov A.F. Labas Y.A. Savitsky A.P. Zaraisky A.G. Markelov M.L. Lukyanov S.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 969-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar) as a visible selectable marker in germline transformation in the same mosquito species. The pMiRED transformation vector (Fig.1 a) was derived from plasmid pMiNot (11Loukeris T.G. Livadaras I. Arca' B. Zabalou S. Savakis C. Science. 1995; 270: 2002-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) by inserting a DNA fragment containing the dsRED gene (CLONTECH) under the control of the actin 5C promoter from D. melanogaster. The helper plasmids pHSS6hsILMi20 and phsp-pBac, respectively providing theMinos and the piggyBac transposase genes, have been described previously (10Handler A.M. Harrell II, R.A. Insect Mol. Biol. 1999; 8: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 16Klinakis A.G. Loukeris T.G. Pavlopoulos A. Savakis C. Insect Mol. Biol. 2000; 9: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The pPBRED transformation vector (Fig. 1 a) was derived from plasmid pBKOα (17Thibault S.T. Luu H.T. Vann N. Miller T.A. Insect Mol. Biol. 1999; 8: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) by cloning aBglII linker, containing an internal NotI site, into the unique BglII site within the piggyBacgene. A DNA cassette including the dsRED gene under the control of the actin 5C promoter and additional sequences (stuffer) was then cloned as a single NotI fragment into the inserted linker. Blood-fed A. stephensimosquitoes (strain sd 500) were allowed to lay eggs in a solution of 0.1 mm p-nitrophenylp′-guanidinobenzoate 48–72 h after a blood meal. Embryos were then transferred onto glass slides and microinjected in injection buffer essentially as described previously (1Catteruccia F. Nolan T. Loukeris T.G. Blass C. Savakis C. Kafatos F.C. Crisanti A. Nature. 2000; 405: 959-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Embryos were microinjected with a mixture of helper plasmid pHSS6hsILMi20 (100 μg ml−1) and pMiRED (400 μg ml−1) in the case of Minos-mediated integrations and with plasmid phsp-pBac (100 μg ml−1) and pPBRED (400 μg ml−1) in the case of piggyBac-mediated integrations. Hatched larvae were analyzed on an inverted microscope using a Texas Red filter to detect dsRED expression. Genomic DNA from transgenic A. stephensi adults (G2 generation) and from wild type mosquitoes was digested with the restriction endonuclease HincII or EcoRI and blotted as described previously (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Digested genomic DNA (∼4 μg/lane) was separated on a 0.8% agarose gel and transferred onto a nylon membrane. The membranes were hybridized overnight at 65 °C with different 32P-labeled probes. In the case of theMinos-mediated integration, genomic DNA was hybridized with the previously described probe M (1Catteruccia F. Nolan T. Loukeris T.G. Blass C. Savakis C. Kafatos F.C. Crisanti A. Nature. 2000; 405: 959-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 a), encompassing both the left and the right arms of Minos. In the case of piggyBac-mediated integrations, probe P, a PCR product encompassing sequences of the left and right arms of thepiggyBac transposon, was used. To sequence thepiggyBac integration sites, genomic Lambda ZapEcoRI libraries (Stratagene) were constructed from the DNA extracted from G2 larvae of A. stephensitransgenic lines 102 and A3 and hybridized with probe P (Fig. 1 a). The cloned insertion sites were sequenced using primers annealing internally to the piggyBac inverted repeats (pPB-R, 5′-CGTACTTACTGTACTTACTGC-3′; pPB-L, 5′-CATCGCCTTGCAGAAGAGC-3′) (TableI).Table ISequence of integration sitesFamilyFlanking sequencepiggyBac arm102CTCCTCTCTTAAACACCTTAAccctagaaagatLeft102atctttctagggTTAAAGCAGTGGAGTGGAGGRightA3CCGCGCATCGATCGCATTAAccctagaaagatLeftA3atctttctagggTTAAGGAGGGCGATCTCGTGARightPutative piggyBac insertions were isolated and sequenced after using probe P to screen Lambda Zap genomic libraries from transgenic families 102 and A3.

We tested whether the red fluorescent protein dsRED could be used as a visible selectable marker for germline transformation of A. stephensi mosquitoes. In a pilot experiment, A. stephensi embryos were microinjected with vector pMiRED, which contained the dsRED gene from Discosomasp. under the transcriptional control of the actin 5C promoter from D. melanogaster inserted between the Minosinverted repeats (Fig. 1 a). pMiRED was microinjected together with plasmid pHSS6ILMi20, which provided the enzymatic activity necessary for Minostransposition (16Klinakis A.G. Loukeris T.G. Pavlopoulos A. Savakis C. Insect Mol. Biol. 2000; 9: 269-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The 23 adults obtained from 102 injected embryos were outcrossed to wild type A. stephensi mosquitoes, and their progeny was analyzed for fluorescence using a Texas Red excitation filter (Table II). Fluorescent G1 larvae were detected in the progeny of G0female No. 7. The segregation of the red allele in following generations was in agreement with the occurrence of a single insertion (data not shown). To assess the nature of the integration event, we performed Southern blotting analysis of the transgenic population (line MinRED1) on genomic DNA extracted from G2 larvae and digested with the EcoRI or HincII restriction endonuclease. Two bands could be detected after hybridization with probe M, which encompassed both arms of Minos, demonstrating that a single insertion of the transposon had occurred (Fig.1 b) (1Catteruccia F. Nolan T. Loukeris T.G. Blass C. Savakis C. Kafatos F.C. Crisanti A. Nature. 2000; 405: 959-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Interestingly the pattern of expression of fluorescence changed throughout larval development. In newly hatched larvae, a faint fluorescence could be detected in nerve cells around the larval body (Fig. 2 a). The levels of fluorescence increased in second and third instar larvae, which displayed the gut expression pattern previously described in transgenic A. stephensi transformed with an actin 5C-EGFP transposon (Fig. 2 b) (1Catteruccia F. Nolan T. Loukeris T.G. Blass C. Savakis C. Kafatos F.C. Crisanti A. Nature. 2000; 405: 959-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Importantly fluorescence was more easily detected in the gut of adult mosquitoes than in the case of transgenic lines expressing the EGFP marker (Fig. 2 c).Table IIOutcome of injection experimentsPlasmidEmbryos injectedLarvaeAdultsWT outcrossGroup/founderFluorescent/total G1spMiRED10232 (31%)23 (22%)13 males0 /7,25210 femalesNo. 73 /1,561pPBRED303117 (39%)76 (25%)15 malesA19 /2,340***20 malesB0 /4,7937 malesC25 /21434 femalesNo. 1038 /2,797***Injection experiments were performed on A. stephensi embryos using two different transformation plasmids.

Open table in a new tab Injection experiments were performed on A. stephensi embryos using two different transformation plasmids.

Adults were outcrossed to wild type (WT) mosquitoes. Where asterisks are present, this indicates that more than one phenotype was isolated in the G1 progeny. We then tested the ability of the piggyBactransposable element to drive integration of exogenous DNA into the germline of A. stephensi mosquitoes. A total of 303 embryos was injected with a mixture of transformation vector pPBRED, containing the actin-dsRED cassette inserted within the inverted repeats ofpiggyBac, and plasmid phsp-pBac, providing thepiggyBac transposase gene (Fig. 1 a) (10Handler A.M. Harrell II, R.A. Insect Mol. Biol. 1999; 8: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The 76 adults surviving injections were divided into three groups of males and one group of females, and each group was outcrossed separately (TableII). G0 females were group-mated and allowed to lay eggs in isolation, while G0 males were tested collectively. A minimum of three G0 adults (female No. 10 and individuals from male groups A and C, see Table II) produced fluorescent progeny, with a minimum integration frequency of 4%, comparable to that obtained using Minos to transform the same mosquito species (1Catteruccia F. Nolan T. Loukeris T.G. Blass C. Savakis C. Kafatos F.C. Crisanti A. Nature. 2000; 405: 959-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Due to the testing procedure used for G0 males, it was not possible to assess whether the fluorescent G1 larvae in groups A and C were derived from one or more progenitors. Among the 34 G0 females, 12 did not lay eggs after multiple feedings, accounting for a total estimated sterility of 35%. Microscopic analysis of G1 larvae revealed the presence of as many as seven different fluorescent phenotypes: three from female No. 10 (101–3), three from male group A (A1–3), and one from male group C (C1), which were reared separately (Table II). To determine the nature of the integration events, Southern blotting analysis of the seven putative transgenic populations was performed (Fig. 1 c). Genomic DNA extracted from each population was digested with EcoRI restriction endonuclease and hybridized with probe P, spanning the two arms ofpiggyBac (Fig. 1 a). With this combination of probe and restriction endonucleases, every insertion of the transposon will be identified by the appearance of two hybridizing bands. The Southern blot results confirmed the different molecular origins of the seven phenotypes. Single insertions were detected in three of the seven lines, while the remaining four showed the occurrence of multiple integrations, a phenomenon typical of piggyBac insertions. Legitimate insertions of piggyBac elements always occur at a TTAA nucleotide sequence, causing a precise duplication of the site (2Fraser M.J. Ciszczon T. Elick T. Bauser C. Insect Mol. Biol. 1996; 5: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). To verify that integrations had occurred according to a precisepiggyBac mechanism, the sequence of the junctions between the inserted element and the A. stephensi genome was determined for two of the transgenic lines that showed a single insertion of the transposon. Genomic DNA libraries from transgenic lines 102 and A3were constructed and screened with probe P. Positive clones were sequenced using primers annealing to the piggyBac transposon and, in both cases, the insertion sites showed complete piggyBac inverted repeats, a TTAA nucleotide sequence, and additional sequences of unknown origin, presumably derived from the A. stephensi genome (Table I). To confirm these findings, primers annealing to the putative genomic sequences flanking the piggyBac inverted repeats were designed to amplify the two empty sites on genomic DNA from wild type mosquitoes, and in both cases a band of the expected size was obtained by PCRs (not shown). We have demonstrated the ability of the piggyBactransposable element to drive integration of exogenous DNA in A. stephensi mosquitoes. The availability of a second functional transposable element in A. stephensi will introduce important improvements to the transgenic system recently developed in these mosquitoes by using Minos as a delivery vector (1Catteruccia F. Nolan T. Loukeris T.G. Blass C. Savakis C. Kafatos F.C. Crisanti A. Nature. 2000; 405: 959-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar).Minos-transformed mosquito lines can now be further manipulated by introducing additional genes with the use ofpiggyBac transposons. Furthermore, remobilization studies can be performed to assess the capability of nonautonomousMinos and piggyBac transposons to be remobilized in crosses with transgenic lines producing their specific transposase genes. Since the Minos and piggyBac elements do not seem to cross-mobilize each other, they are well suited for such studies. Remobilization experiments will be fundamental in understanding the feasibility of using autonomous transposable elements to spread malaria-refractory genes throughout a wild population. Our results in A. stephensi mosquitoes, which have been confirmed by the work performed in collaborating laboratories, 2A. Crisanti and M. Jacobs-Lorena, manuscript in preparation. testify to the broad host range of piggyBac, which makes it a very attractive transposon for germline transformation experiments. An EGFP-loaded piggyBac transposon has also been recently validated as DNA delivery vector in Anopheles gambiaemosquitoes, although at frequencies much lower than those obtained in this study (6Grossman G.L. Rafferty C.S. Clayton J.R.T.K. Stevens T.K. Mukabayire O. Benedict M.Q. Insect Mol. Biol. 2001; 10: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). However, when comparing piggyBac toMinos, the fact that the latter element generally creates single integrations may represent an advantage in terms of studying the effects of introducing foreign DNA into the genome of heterologous organisms (1Catteruccia F. Nolan T. Loukeris T.G. Blass C. Savakis C. Kafatos F.C. Crisanti A. Nature. 2000; 405: 959-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The presence of piggyBac-like transposons in different species seems to indicate the occurrence of horizontal transfer of this element (19Handler A.M. McCombs S.D. Insect Mol. Biol. 2000; 9: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Horizontal transfer has also been postulated for Minos (20Arca B. Savakis C. Genetica. 2000; 108: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). More data are needed on these two transposons before population replacement schemes can be implemented. We have also validated the use of dsRED as a selectable marker in germline transformation of A. stephensi mosquitoes. dsRED, isolated from Discosoma sp. (3Matz M.V. Fradkov A.F. Labas Y.A. Savitsky A.P. Zaraisky A.G. Markelov M.L. Lukyanov S.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 969-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar), has been used as a reporter gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in zebrafish and very recently as a selectable marker in D. melanogaster (21Rodrigues F. van Hemert M. Steensma H.Y. Corte-Real M. Leao C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3791-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Finley K.R. Davidson A.E. Ekker S.C.

Previous Minos-mediated integrations in A. stephensi were achieved using the green fluorescent protein EGFP as a selectable marker (1Catteruccia F. Nolan T. Loukeris T.G. Blass C. Savakis C. Kafatos F.C. Crisanti A. Nature. 2000; 405: 959-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in A. stephensimosquitoes, dsRED showed slower kinetics of formation than EGFP as demonstrated by the weak fluorescent phenotype observed in first instar larvae of all dsRED transgenic lines. However, dsRED is visible in the gut of adult A. stephensi individuals, a feature that would allow the easy identification of transgenic insects in recapture studies after release in the wild. Importantly the emission profiles of the dsRED and EGFP markers do not overlap in the progeny of mixed transgenic populations (data not shown). The availability of an additional selectable marker will extend the range of applications of germline transformation in Anopheles mosquitoes, allowing functional studies such as transposon remobilization, enhancer trapping, and transposon tagging, which are based on crossing of lines expressing different markers. It will also have an important impact on the manipulation of other insect species for which mutation-based visible markers are not available. In conclusion, the results achieved in this study are anticipated to have an essential impact upon the development of an array of genetic tools for studying the biology ofAnopheles mosquitoes.

How these signals are integrated so that cell physiology is altered remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that migration of MCF-7 breast cancer cells and HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells on serum-coated surfaces is stimulated by agents that activate ERK, including uPA, epidermal growth factor, and constitutively active MEK1. The promigratory activity of these agents was entirely blocked not only by the MEK-specific antagonist PD098059, but also by antagonists of the Rho-Rho kinase pathway, including Y-27632 and dominant-negative RhoA (RhoA-N19). uPA did not significantly increase the level of GTP-bound RhoA, suggesting that the constitutive activity of the Rho-Rho kinase pathway may be sufficient to support ERK-stimulated cell migration. Paradoxically, Y-27632 and RhoA-N19 increased ERK phosphorylation in MCF-7 cells, providing further evidence that ERK activation alone does not promote cell migration when Rho kinase is antagonized. When MCF-7 cell migration was stimulated by ERK-independent processes such as expression of the β3 integrin subunit or changing the substratum to type I collagen, Y-27632 and RhoA-N19 failed to inhibit the response. This study supports a model in which the Ras-ERK and Rho-Rho kinase pathways cooperate to promote cell migration.

The function of uPA may be to induce uPAR conformational change so that the required interactions with other plasma membrane proteins are established and signaling is initiated (2.Blasi F. Thromb.

In support of this hypothesis, soluble uPAR mimics many of the activities of uPA, probably because soluble uPAR adopts the same conformation as plasma membrane-associated uPAR after complex formation with uPA (5.Fazioli F.

In aggressive cancer cells, endogenously produced uPA and uPAR may form a self-contained autocrine pathway, which serves as a major determinant of the basal level of ERK activation, in the absence of exogenous stimulants (15.Aguirre-Ghiso J.A.

In this pathway, ERK activates myosin light chain kinase, which induces serine phosphorylation of the myosin II regulatory light chain and thereby promotes contraction of the actomyosin cytoskeleton (9.Nguyen D.H. Catling A.D. Webb D.J. Sankovic M. Walker L.A. Somlyo A.V. Weber M.J. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 18.Klemke R.L. Cai S. Giannini A.L.

Why increased cytoskeletal contractility is important for the migrating cell remains incompletely understood; however, it is thought that this activity facilitates retraction of the cell tail. uPAR-initiated signaling is also important in the mechanism by which uPA promotes smooth muscle cell migration; however, in smooth muscle cells, the response is blocked by inhibitors of a distinct signaling pathway that includes the Janus kinase Tyk2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (19.Kusch A. Tkachuk S. Haller H. Dietz R. Gulba D.C. Lipp M. Dumler I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39466-39473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The activity of the Ras-ERK pathway in smooth muscle cell migration has not been explored. Nevertheless, the function of Tyk2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in smooth muscle cell migration (19.Kusch A. Tkachuk S. Haller H. Dietz R. Gulba D.C. Lipp M. Dumler I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39466-39473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) raises the possibility that distinct signaling pathways may be preeminent in determining physiologic responses to uPA in different cell types. The focus of this study is the function of the small GTPase Rho and the major Rho effector, Rho kinase (also known as p160ROCK), in uPA-promoted MCF-7 and HT-1080 cell migration. RhoA and homologous proteins in the Rho family function primarily in processes that require remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton (20.Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Amano M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 459-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). In stationary cells, RhoA promotes the formation of actin stress fibers and clustering of proteins in focal adhesions (20.Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Amano M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 459-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar, 21.Ridley A.J. Comoglio P.M. Hall A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1110-1122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Hall A.

However, recent studies suggest that RhoA, RhoC, and Rho kinase may also be important in cell migration and cancer invasion (24.Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kato M. Yamochi W. Kuroda S. Nakamura T.

Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). How these proteins promote cell migration is incompletely understood. By inactivating myosin light chain phosphatase, Rho kinase may complement the function of myosin light chain kinase in promoting myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation and actomyosin contractility (28.Somlyo A.V. Bradshaw D. Ramos S. Murphy C. Myers C.E. Somlyo A.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 30.Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y.

Rho kinase also activates a downstream pathway that culminates in the inactivation of cofilin, an actin-depolymerizing agent (31.Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S. Science. 1999; 285: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Rho kinase may regulate the avidity of cellular integrins for the extracellular matrix, allowing the migrating cell to retract its tail (28.Somlyo A.V. Bradshaw D. Ramos S. Murphy C. Myers C.E. Somlyo A.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 29.Worthylake R.A. Lemoine S. Watson J.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). We undertook these studies because of the apparent overlap in the downstream targets of the Rho-Rho kinase and Ras-ERK pathways and because of the accumulating evidence that antagonists of Rho kinase inhibit cancer progression. Although we began our studies by examining the activity of the Rho-Rho kinase pathway in uPA-treated cells, we also examined cells treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) or transfected to express constitutively active MEK1. Our results indicate that the Rho-Rho kinase and Ras-ERK pathways function independently but cooperatively to stimulate MCF-7 and HT-1080 cell migration on serum-coated surfaces. Antagonists of the Rho-Rho kinase pathway entirely blocked uPA-, EGF-, and MEK1-promoted cell migration even though these antagonists independently activated ERK. When MCF-7 cell migration was stimulated by mechanisms that do not require ERK, Rho kinase also was not required. These results support a model in which activation and/or the constitutive activity of multiple independent signaling pathways may be essential to stimulate cell migration in response to uPA. Antagonizing any one of the pathways may be sufficient to eliminate the response completely. Two-chain uPA was kindly provided by Drs. Jack Henkin and Andrew Mazar (Abbott). uPA was treated with diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) to generate DFP-uPA as previously described (10.Nguyen D.H. Hussaini I.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8502-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). DFP-uPA binds to uPAR with unchanged affinity, but lacks proteinase activity. Recombinant human EGF was purchased from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). The MEK inhibitor PD098059 was from Calbiochem. The Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 was from Mitsubishi Pharma Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). Expression constructs encoding constitutively active MEK1, hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ERK1, and green fluorescent protein (GFP) were previously described (9.Nguyen D.H. Catling A.D. Webb D.J. Sankovic M. Walker L.A. Somlyo A.V. Weber M.J. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). An expression construct that encodes dominant-negative RhoA (RhoA-N19) was kindly provided by Dr. Robert Nakamoto (University of Virginia). A construct that encodes the Rho-binding domain of Rhotekin as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (GST-TRBD) in pGEX was provided by Dr. Martin Schwartz (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) and expressed in BL21 cells. Purified GST-TRBD was also purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The full-length cDNA encoding the human β3 integrin subunit was kindly provided by Dr. David Cheresh (Scripps Research Institute) and subcloned into pBK-CMV. Antibody that specifically detects phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 was from Calbiochem. Polyclonal antibody that recognizes total ERK1 and ERK2 was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). RhoA-specific monoclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5 was from Babco. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against mouse IgG and rabbit IgG were from Amersham Biosciences. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), protease inhibitor mixture, sodium orthovanadate, dithiothreitol, and bovine serum albumin were from Sigma. Low-passage MCF-7 cells (passage 8) were kindly provided by Dr. Sally Parsons (University of Virginia) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HT-1080 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in minimum essential medium with 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids. Cells were passaged using enzyme-free dissociation buffer (Invitrogen) and maintained in culture for 48 h before experiments were performed. Migration of MCF-7 and HT-1080 cells was studied using 6.5-mm Transwell chambers with 8-μm pores (Costar Corp.) as previously described (10.Nguyen D.H. Hussaini I.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8502-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The Transwell membranes were coated with 20% fetal bovine serum or type I collagen (25 μg/ml) (BD PharMingen) on the underside only. Both membrane surfaces were then blocked with 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells (105 cells/100 μl) in serum-free medium were pretreated first with PD098059 (50 μm) or Y-27632 (25 μm) for 15 min in suspension and then with DFP-uPA or EGF for an additional 15 min. The cells then were added to the upper chamber of each Transwell unit in the presence of the same agents. The lower chamber was supplemented with DFP-uPA or EGF when these agents were added to the top chamber. Fetal bovine serum (10%) was also added to the lower chamber in MCF-7 cell migration experiments. Migration was allowed to occur for 6 h at 37 °C. MCF-7 cell migration to the underside of the membrane was determined by counting cells stained with Diff-Quik C (Dade Diagnostics) (10.Nguyen D.H. Hussaini I.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8502-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). HT-1080 cell migration was determined by crystal violet staining as previously described (9.Nguyen D.H. Catling A.D. Webb D.J. Sankovic M. Walker L.A. Somlyo A.V. Weber M.J. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In some experiments, MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected to express constitutively active MEK1, RhoA-N19, or the β3integrin subunit (2 μg of each construct) by incubation with Effectene (QIAGEN Inc.) for 24 h. The same cells were cotransfected to express GFP (0.5 μg). Transfection and cotransfection efficiencies were determined as previously described (9.Nguyen D.H. Catling A.D. Webb D.J. Sankovic M. Walker L.A. Somlyo A.V. Weber M.J. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Importantly, cotransfection efficiencies were always ∼100%. Migration experiments were performed as described above, except that Biocoat cell culture inserts (BD PharMingen) were used instead of Transwell chambers. Cell migration was determined by counting green fluorescing cells. MCF-7 cells were cultured on six-well plates until 80–90% confluent and then serum-starved for 24 h. Where indicated, the cells were preincubated with PD098059 (50 μm) or Y-27632 (25 μm) for 15 min. DFP-uPA (10 nm) was then added for 2 min. Cell extracts were prepared in 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 (pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitor mixture and sodium orthovanadate (1 mm). The protein concentration in each extract was determined by fluoraldehyde assay. Equal amounts of each extract were then subjected SDS-PAGE on 10% slabs, electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed for phosphorylated and total ERKs by immunoblot analysis. To study ERK phosphorylation in MCF-7 cells that were transiently transfected with constructs encoding constitutively active MEK1 (2 μg) and/or RhoA-N19 (2 μg), cells were cotransfected to express HA-tagged ERK1 (0.5 μg) using Effectene. Cells were maintained in serum-containing medium for 24 h to optimize transfection and expression and then serum-starved for 24 h. Treatments with PD098059 or Y-27632 were executed for 15 min. The cells were then extracted with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.4), 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitor mixture and sodium orthovanadate (1 mm). The extracts were precleared with protein G-Sepharose and then incubated with antibody 12CA5 for 12 h at 4 °C, followed by protein G-Sepharose for 1 h. The pellets were washed four times and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described above. Affinity precipitation of active Rho was performed using the fusion protein GST-TRBD, which specifically recognizes the active GTP-bound form of Rho (GTP-Rho), as previously described (32.Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells were cultured in 15-cm2 plates until 80–90% confluent and then serum-starved for 24 h. Some cells were pretreated with PD098059 (50 μm) for 15 min. Cultures were then exposed to DFP-uPA (10 nm) or LPA (10 μm) for the indicated times; washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline; and extracted in 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.2) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. The extracts were incubated with 30 μg of GST-TRBD coupled to glutathione-Sepharose for 45 min at 4 °C. The glutathione-Sepharose was washed four times and then treated with SDS sample buffer to dissociate GST-TRBD and GTP-Rho. Immunoblot analysis was performed to detect active RhoA. Samples of each cell extract were also subjected to immunoblot analysis prior to incubation with GST-TRBD to quantitate total RhoA. We previously demonstrated an essential role for the Ras-ERK pathway in uPA-stimulated MCF-7 breast cancer cell and HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cell migration (10.Nguyen D.H. Hussaini I.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8502-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Synthetic inhibitors and dominant-negative mutants of MEK1 and Ha-Ras, which prevent ERK activation, block cell migration in response to uPA (9.Nguyen D.H. Catling A.D. Webb D.J. Sankovic M. Walker L.A. Somlyo A.V. Weber M.J. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dominant-negative mutants of signaling proteins that frequently couple signaling receptors to Ha-Ras, including focal adhesion kinase, c-Src, and Shc, also block cell migration in response to uPA (7.Nguyen D.H. Webb D.J. Catling A.D. Song Q. Dhakephalkar A. Weber M.J. Ravichandran K.S. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19382-19388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The same agents have no effect on cell migration in the absence of uPA. Taken together, these results could be interpreted to indicate an exclusive role for the Ras-ERK pathway in uPA-stimulated cell migration. In cell migration, the Rho-Rho kinase and Ras-ERK pathways may affect similar processes such as tail retraction (18.Klemke R.L. Cai S. Giannini A.L. Gallagher P.J. de Lanerolle P. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar, 28.Somlyo A.V. Bradshaw D. Ramos S. Murphy C. Myers C.E. Somlyo A.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). To assess the function of the Rho-Rho kinase pathway in uPA-stimulated cell migration, we studied MCF-7 and HT-1080 cells in Transwell membranes that were precoated with serum for 2 h. Under these conditions, the membranes become coated primarily with vitronectin, which serves as the major cell attachment and spreading factor (33.Hayman E.G. Pierschbacher M.D. Ohgren Y. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4003-4007Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Our previous work showed that identical results are obtained when membranes are coated with serum or purified vitronectin (7.Nguyen D.H. Webb D.J. Catling A.D. Song Q. Dhakephalkar A. Weber M.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8502-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Cells were added to the upper chamber and allowed to migrate for 6 h. Fig. 1A shows that DFP-uPA promoted MCF-7 cell migration, as previously reported (10.Nguyen D.H. Hussaini I.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8502-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). When cells were pretreated with the MEK inhibitor PD098059 (50 μm), the response to uPA was entirely blocked. PD098059 had no effect on cell migration in the absence of uPA, as anticipated because, in unstimulated MCF-7 cells, the level of activated ERK is extremely low (10.Nguyen D.H. Hussaini I.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8502-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). We next examined the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632. As shown in Fig. 1A, Y-27632 (25 μm), like PD098059, completely blocked uPA-stimulated MCF-7 cell migration and had no effect on cell migration in the absence of uPA. Inhibition of uPA-stimulated MCF-7 cell migration was Y-27632 concentration-dependent when the inhibitor was added at final concentrations of 2–25 μm(data not shown). When uPA-stimulated cell migration was maximally inhibited by Y-27632, simultaneous addition of PD098059 had no further effect. In control experiments, performed as previously described (10.Nguyen D.H. Hussaini I.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8502-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), neither Y-27632 nor PD098059 inhibited MCF-7 cell adhesion to vitronectin (data not shown). Fig. 1B shows the results of cell migration experiments performed with HT-1080 cells. uPA stimulated HT-1080 cell migration, and PD098059 (50 μm) completely blocked this response, as anticipated (9.Nguyen D.H. Catling A.D. Webb D.J. Sankovic M. Walker L.A. Somlyo A.V. Weber M.J. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). PD098059 had no effect on HT-1080 cell migration in the absence of uPA. Similarly, Y-27632 (25 μm) blocked the effects of uPA on HT-1080 cell migration and had no effect on cell migration in the absence of uPA. When HT-1080 cells were treated simultaneously with PD098059 and Y-27632 at concentrations that were sufficient to independently block uPA-stimulated cell migration, the combination of drugs was no more effective than either agent added independently. We next sought to determine whether Rho kinase is important when MCF-7 cell migration is stimulated by agents other than uPA. EGF activates multiple signaling pathways, including the Ras-ERK pathway, by binding to its receptor tyrosine kinase (34.van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, EGF increased MCF-7 cell migration on serum-coated membranes by 3.1-fold. The response to EGF was completely blocked by PD098059 (50 μm), indicating an essential role for MEK and its downstream effector ERK. Y-27632 also completely blocked EGF-stimulated cell migration. The combination of PD098059 and Y-27632 was no more effective than either agent added separately. EGF promotes cell migration by activating interrelated downstream signaling pathways (34.van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 35.Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H.

To activate ERK specifically without simultaneously activating other signaling pathways, we transfected MCF-7 cells to express constitutively active MEK1. The cells were cotransfected to express GFP. Cotransfection efficiencies were essentially 100%, allowing us to identify active MEK1-expressing cells, after migration through membranes, by fluorescence microscopy (7.Nguyen D.H. Webb D.J.

Punctin lacks the pro-metalloprotease and the disintegrin-like domain typical of this family but contains other ADAMTS domains in precise order including four thrombospondin type I repeats. Punctin is the product of a distinct gene on human chromosome 9p21-22 and mouse chromosome 4 that is expressed in adult skeletal muscle. His-tagged punctin expressed in stably transfected High-FiveTM insect cells was purified to apparent homogeneity by Ni-chromatography of conditioned medium. The NH2 terminus is not blocked and has the sequence EEDRD and so forth as determined by Edman degradation, demonstrating signal peptidase processing. Recombinant epitope-tagged punctin has a calculated mass of 59,991 Da but exhibits major molecular species of 61970 ± 6 Da and 62131 ± 5 Da as measured by liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry. Punctin is a glycoprotein based on carbohydrate staining and liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry glycopeptide analysis. Glycosylation occurs at a single N-linked site as demonstrated by altered electrophoretic migration of punctin expressed in the presence of tunicamycin A. Punctin contains disulfide bonds based on antibody accessibility and electrophoretic migration under reducing versus nonreducing conditions. Rotary shadowing demonstrates that punctin is hatchet-shaped having a globular region attached to a short stem. In transfected COS-1 cells, punctin is deposited in the cell substratum in a punctate fashion and is excluded from focal contacts.

These enzymes are structurally and functionally bipartite consisting of an enzymatic domain attached to nonenzymatic or ancillary domains. The ancillary domains localize these proteases to substrates, the cell surface, or to the ECM. The ancillary domains of the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 are among the best studied of the substrate-binding domains. The fibronectin type II domains of the gelatinases are involved in binding to gelatin and some collagens as well as to fibronectin and heparin as in the case of MMP-2 (5.Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J.

The gelatin-binding domain of MMP-2 binds the matricellular proteins thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) and TSP2 (7.Bein K. Simons M. J. Biol.

Although neither is a substrate for MMP-2, the interaction may mediate the clearance of MMP-2 and affect cell-adhesive properties (8.Bornstein P. Armstrong L.C. Hankenson K.D. Kyriakides T.R. Yang Z. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The MMP-2 hemopexin domain interacts with the carboxyl terminus of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases-2, facilitating pro-MMP-2 activation by membrane-type MMPs (1.Murphy G. Knauper V.

The MMP-2 hemopexin domain also interacts with a chemokine called monocyte chemoattractant protein-3, which allows its processing by the catalytic domain (10.McQuibban G.A. Gong J.H. Tam E.M. McCulloch C.A. Clark-Lewis I. Overall C.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1202-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). The disintegrin domains of ADAMs such as ADAM-15 are implicated in cell-cell adhesion (2.Blobel C.P.

In some ADAMs, the zinc-binding active site is nonfunctional, suggesting that they do not function as proteases at all but may instead have a primary role in adhesion via their ancillary domains (2.Blobel C.P.

We have identified an ADAMTS-like (ADAMTSL) molecule named punctin, 2Approved gene symbols ADAMTSL1 and Adamtsl1 indicate human and mouse orthologs, respectively. The corresponding protein product of these genes, ADAMTSL-1, is designated by the trivial name punctin because of its punctate distribution beneath transfected cells. 2Approved gene symbols ADAMTSL1 and Adamtsl1 indicate human and mouse orthologs, respectively. The corresponding protein product of these genes, ADAMTSL-1, is designated by the trivial name punctin because of its punctate distribution beneath transfected cells. which is the product of a gene distinct from any in the ADAMTS family and is composed of ADAMTS ancillary domains alone. We have purified and characterized recombinant punctin produced in insect cells, visualized it by electron microscopy, and demonstrated that it is a glycoprotein and a component of the ECM. Using BLAST programs from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, we scanned the data base of ESTs using the protein sequences of ADAMTS proteases previously cloned by us (4.Hurskainen T.L. Hirohata S. Seldin M.F. Apte S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25555-25563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 14.Georgiadis K.E. Hirohata S. Seldin M.F. Apte S.S. Genomics. 1999; 62: 312-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and identified a human EST (GenBankTM accession number AA482392 encoded by IMAGE clone 752797). The EST predicted a polypeptide with a similarity to the carboxyl half of cognate ADAMTS members but with no identities in GenBankTM or other protein and nucleotide data bases. Using nested oligonucleotide primers based on the sequences at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the IMAGE clone insert and human skeletal muscle cDNA (Marathon cDNA, CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) as the template, we performed RACE and extended the cDNA at 5′ and 3′ ends by PCR essentially as described previously (4.Hurskainen T.L.

Genomics. 1999; 62: 312-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Multiple tissue Northern blots from adult human and mouse tissues (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) were hybridized to a [α-32P]dCTP-labeled punctin probe, a 1200-bp cDNA fragment from the 5′ end of the punctin coding sequence, followed by autoradiographic exposure for 7 days. To determine the chromosomal location of Adamtsl1, we analyzed a panel of DNA samples from an interspecific cross that has been characterized for over 1200 genetic markers throughout the mouse genome (15.Watson M.L. Seldin M.F. Methods Mol. Genet. 1994; 5: 369-387Google Scholar). Markers can be seen on the worldwide web (www.informatics.jax.org/searches/crossdata_form.shtml) by entering “DNA Mapping Panel Data Sets” from the mouse genome data base and then selecting the “Seldin cross” and “Chromosome.” Initially, DNA from the two parental mice, (C3H/HeJ-gld) and (C3H/HeJ-gld × Mus spretus) F1), were digested with various restriction endonucleases and hybridized with the Adamtsl1 cDNA probe (IMAGE clone 2076907 with GenBankTM accession numberAI787975) to determine restriction fragment length variants for haplotype analyses. Gene linkage was determined by segregation analysis. Gene order was determined by analyzing all haplotypes and minimizing crossover frequency among all genes that were determined to be within a linkage group. This method resulted in the determination of the most probable gene order. To define the locus for ADAMTSL1, the human punctin cDNA sequence was used for BLAST searches of the human genome (Celera Sciences, Rockville, MD). The peptide (NH2)-[C]YYPENIKPKPKLQE-(OH) located in the third TS domain of punctin (Fig. 1B) was synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry, purified by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, and molecular weight was confirmed by MS (Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX). A cysteine ([C]) residue was included at the NH2 terminus for coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Peptide-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate was dialyzed in PBS and used for immunization. Two New Zealand White male rabbits (7–8 pounds) were immunized with the conjugate (∼200 μg/injection/rabbit, multiple intramuscular and subcutaneous sites) at biweekly intervals for 8 weeks. After an initial injection in Freund's complete adjuvant, subsequent injections were given in incomplete adjuvant. Antibody titer was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using free peptide. Immune sera were tested by Western blot analysis of extracts from COS-1 cells transiently transfected with punctin cDNA (see below). Although antisera from both rabbits (antisera 4112 and 4113) gave qualitatively similar results, the best signal/noise ratio was obtained with antiserum 4113. Affinity-purified antibodies were prepared by column chromatography of antiserum 4113 using the immobilized peptide immunogen. High-FiveTM cells (Invitrogen) were routinely cultured on tissue culture plastic and maintained at 27 °C in UltimateTM serum-free insect cell medium (Invitrogen) as per manufacturer's directions. The full-length punctin ORF was excised from pcDNA3.1/Myc-His B-TSL1 (see below) with EcoRI and NotI and ligated into the corresponding sites in pIZT/V5-His (Invitrogen). The resulting insect cell expression plasmid pIZT/V5-His-TSL1 generated punctin with a COOH-terminal V5 epitope and 6× His tag. pIZT/V5-His-TSL1 was transfected into High-FiveTM cells using Insectin-Plus liposomes (Invitrogen) and plated onto 100-mm Petri dishes. After 48 h, antibiotic selection (500 μg/ml Zeocin, Invitrogen) was started and continued for 21 days. Colonies that survived selection were picked manually, expanded, and maintained in medium containing Zeocin (50 μg/ml). Punctin production by isolated colonies was tested by Western blot analysis of conditioned medium using anti-His monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) and antibody 4113. For protein production, cells were grown in suspension in either UltimateTM serum-free insect cell medium or Express-Five serum-free medium containing heparin (5 units/ml, Invitrogen). Production cultures were in spinner flasks, and culture medium was stored at −80 °C with 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride until use. For purification, medium was dialyzed into binding buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.8) containing 0.03% Brij-35 (Sigma). Purification was performed using 1-liter batches of dialyzed medium and a 5-ml Ni-Sepharose column (ProBondTM, Invitrogen) on an fast protein liquid chromatography instrument (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Following binding, the column was washed with three column volumes of binding buffer. A gradient of 0–42.5 mm imidazole in binding buffer was used to remove nonspecifically bound molecules from the column. Elution was with four column volumes of 250 mm imidazole in binding buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.03% Brij-35. Elution was monitored by in-line UV and conductivity measurements. 2-ml fractions of eluate were collected and tested by Western blot analysis as described above. Fractions containing punctin were pooled. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and by phenylthiocarbamyl amino acid analysis using an Applied Biosystems model 420H/130/920 automated analysis system (16.Crabb J.W. West K.A. Dodson W.S. Hulmes J.D. Coligan J.E. Ploegh H.L. Smith J.A. Speicher D.W. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 11.9.1-11.9.42Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal sequence of recombinant punctin was determined by Edman degradation. Recombinant punctin (5 μg) was electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and lightly stained with modified Coomassie Blue (Simply Blue Safe Stain, Invitrogen). Protein bands were excised and subjected to Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems Procise 492 sequencer in the Molecular Biotechnology Core Facility of the Lerner Research Institute. To probe for glycosylation, recombinant punctin (4 μg) was electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE and stained for carbohydrate using a periodic acid-Schiff reaction-based method (Pro-Q fuchsia glycoprotein staining kit, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). In this reaction, CandyCaneTM glycoprotein molecular weight standards consisting of alternate bands of glycosylated and unglycosylated proteins were used as controls. Glycoprotein staining was also performed after enzymatic deglycosylation of punctin with peptide N-glycosidase F. Deglycosylation of denatured as well as native punctin was performed with a commercially available kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine fetuin as a control. To investigate further whether N-linked carbohydrates were present in punctin, stably transfected insect cells were cultured in the presence or absence of tunicamycin A1 homolog (0.1 μg/ml culture medium, Sigma). Equal amounts of total protein from culture medium of tunicamycin-treated and untreated cells were assayed by Western blot with antibody 4113 at various time points after the addition of tunicamycin The molecular mass of punctin was measured by MALDI-TOF and by LC-ESMS. MALDI-TOF was performed with a PerkinElmer Biosystems Voyager DE Pro-mass spectrometer using sinapinic acid as the matrix and bovine serum albumin as a calibration standard protein (17.Kapron J.T. Hilliard G.M. Lakins J.N. Tenniswood M.P. West K.A. Carr S.A. Crabb J.W. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2120-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF MS measurements of intact punctin and naturally observed limited proteolysis fragments are reported ± 50% peak width (in Da) at half-maximal peak height. LC-ESMS was performed with a PerkinElmer Sciex API 3000 triple quadruple mass spectrometer (17.Kapron J.T. Hilliard G.M. Lakins J.N. Tenniswood M.P. West K.A. Carr S.A. Crabb J.W.

Nitrogen was used as the nebulization gas at 40 p.s.i., and curtain gas was supplied from a nitrogen generator (Whatman model 75-72). For LC-ESMS of intact punctin, a scan range of 700–1800m/z was used with 0.2 atomic mass unit steps, a scan time of 7.5 s, and at an orifice potential of 80 and 5000 V ion spray. Reverse phase-high-pressure liquid chromatography was done at a flow rate of 5 μl/min on a 5-μm Vydac C18 capillary column (0.3 × 150 mm, LC Packing) using an Applied Biosystems Model 140D high-pressure liquid chromatography system and aqueous acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid solvents with 100% of the eluant going to the mass spectrometer. ESMS measurements of intact punctin are reported as the mean ± S.E. (in Da). For glycopeptide characterization, punctin was excised from a SDS-polyacrylamide gel (∼1 μg/lane × 6 lanes), in-gel reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol, cysteine-alkylated with 20 mm iodoacetamide in 400 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and digested with 0.2 μg of trypsin (Promega) overnight at 37 °C in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Peptides from the in-gel tryptic digests were extracted with 60% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, dried in a Speed Vac, redissolved in 50 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and analyzed by LC-ESMS using selective ion monitoring with the PE Sciex API 3000 triple quadruple mass spectrometer system as described above for intact protein analyses. Glycopeptides were selectively detected based on diagnostic sugar oxonium ions HexNAc + Hex (m/z366) and N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc) (m/z 292) (17.Kapron J.T. Hilliard G.M. Lakins J.N. Tenniswood M.P. West K.A. Carr S.A. Crabb J.W. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2120-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Carbohydrate marker ions at m/z 366 and 292 (dwell time 200 ms each) were monitored in a positive ion mode at a high orifice potential (180 V), whereas full scans at m/z 300–2300 (0.2 atomic mass unit steps, scan time 3.5 s) were acquired at a lower orifice potential (70 V). This way both intact parent ions and abundant marker ions were observed in the same m/z scan. Rotary shadowing was done essentially as described previously (19.Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 29-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A 30-μl sample of punctin at 100 μg/ml was mixed with 70 μl of glycerol and nebulized onto freshly cleaved mica using an airbrush. The sample was dried in a vacuum, and rotary shadowed using a platinum-carbon electron beam gun angled at 6° relative to the mica surface within a Balzers BAE 250 evaporator. The replica was backed with carbon, floated onto distilled water, and picked up onto 600 mesh grids. Photomicrographs were taken using a Philips 410 electron microscope operated at 80 kV. An internal SacI site and a flanking NotI site were used to remove a 1.5-kb fragment of IMAGE clone 752797 and ligate it into corresponding sites in IMAGE clone 2150669 corresponding to the 5′ end of the punctin cDNA to generate a complete ORF. EcoRI and NotI sites flanking this ORF were used to excise and clone the full-length coding sequence into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His (+) A (Invitrogen) for the expression of untagged punctin. To make constructs in which the ADAMTSL1ORF was in-frame with a carboxyl-terminal FLAG tag or a tandem myc tag and 6× His tag, PCR was performed with Advantage 2 polymerase (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) using the full-length coding sequence as a template. The amplicons were cloned into the vectors pFLAG-CMV5c (Sigma) and pcDNA3.1/Myc-His B (Invitrogen) for expression with either a COOH-terminal FLAG tag or a COOH-terminal tandem myc tag and 6× His tag, respectively. COS-1 cells (ATCC number CRL-1650) were grown on tissue culture plastic in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F-12 (1:1) (Lerner Research Institute Media Services) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics (100 units/ml of penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin). 105 cells between passages 3 and 10 were transfected with untagged, FLAG-tagged, or myc + 6× His-tagged punctin using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as per manufacturer's recommendations, and cells were grown for an additional 24–48 h in serum-supplemented or serum-free medium. As a control, cells were transfected with the respective vector alone without insert. The medium was collected and concentrated 10-fold. Cells were harvested after detachment with 10 mm EDTA for 10–15 min at 37 °C. A complete detachment of cells was confirmed by phase-contrast microscopy. Fifty microliters of 2× Laemmli sample buffer was added to the wells, and the ECM was scraped off. Samples of cell lysate, medium, and ECM were separately electrophoresed under reducing conditions (samples were boiled following the addition of 10% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol) on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)-Hybond (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Western blotting was performed using either anti-FLAG M2 antibody (diluted 1:500, Sigma), anti-His (COOH-terminal) antibody (diluted 1:1000, Invitrogen) or antibody 4113 (diluted 1:300) depending on the construct used for transfection. Antibody binding was detected using the appropriate peroxidase-labeled second antibody followed by ECL using reagents from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. For immunocytochemistry, COS-1 cells were grown on glass coverslips in 35-mm diameter wells (in 6-well plates) and transiently transfected as described above in serum-supplemented or serum-free medium. The medium was removed 48 h after transfections. The cells were washed three times on ice with cold PBS containing 1 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 and incubated for 1 h on ice with 1 ml of culture medium containing anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (diluted 1:300, Sigma) or anti-punctin rabbit antisera (diluted 1:100) with gentle shaking. Cells were washed four times for 3 min each with cold PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (w/v in PBS) (Sigma) on ice for 30 min with gentle shaking and then washed three times with PBS at ambient temperature. To quench free aldehyde groups, cells were treated with 75 mm ammonium chloride, 20 mm glycine for 10 min at ambient temperature, washed with PBS, and then blocked with 0.05% Triton X-100, 2% normal goat serum in PBS (10 min at ambient temperature). Finally, sections were incubated with the species-appropriate Texas Red-labeled goat secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) prior to coverslip mounting in Vectashield containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). The following control-immunostaining experiments were performed. COS-1 cells transfected with the vector alone or untransfected COS-1 cells were stained with the above antibodies, or transfected cells were stained with preimmune serum from the rabbits in which the polyclonal antibodies were produced. To co-stain punctin and the actin cytoskeleton, cells were stained with anti-FLAG or anti-punctin antibodies as described above with the exception that the secondary antibodies included incubation with Alexa 488-phalloidin at recommended dilutions (Molecular Probes). In double immunostaining experiments following the immunolocalization of FLAG or punctin as described above, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min prior to staining with (a) monoclonal antibody to vinculin (1:100 dilution, Sigma) in combination with antiserum 4113 for the detection of punctin or (b) polyclonal antibody to focal adhesion kinase (1:200 dilution, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) in combination with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma) for the detection of punctin. A Texas Red-labeled antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was used for the detection of punctin, and Alexa 488-conjugated antibody (Molecular Probes) was used for the detection of vinculin or focal adhesion kinase. We identified a novel EST (GenBankTM accession number AA482392) derived from pooled human melanocyte, fetal heart, and pregnant uterus with homology to ADAMTS proteases. The 1.5-kb insert of the corresponding IMAGE clone 752797 contained a long ORF encoding an amino-terminal TS domain, a cysteine-rich domain, a cysteine-free spacer domain, and three tandem TS modules followed by a short acidic peptide and stop codon (Fig. 1a). The stop codon and 3′-untranslated sequence were independently confirmed by 3′-RACE (clone pSHTSL1s3, Fig. 1a) as well as by another EST (GenBankTM accession number W47029). The 3′-untranslated region encoded in IMAGE clone 752797 contained a consensus polyadenylation signal (AATTAAA) followed by a poly(A) tail 14 nucleotides downstream. Completion of the full-length coding sequences by 5′-RACE predicted a putative signal peptide upstream of the central TS domain. The signal peptide was preceded by a methionine codon within a satisfactory Kozak consensus sequence (A at −3, G at +4 relative to ATG) (20.Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2789) Google Scholar) although there was no upstream in-frame stop codon. The 5′ sequence obtained by RACE was subsequently validated by independently cloned human and mouse ESTs (GenbankTM accession numbers A1459225 for human EST and AK020115 for mouse EST). The continuity of the cDNA clones was confirmed by PCR amplification of the full-length punctin ORF from human skeletal muscle cDNA (see below) as well as by identif"
https://openalex.org/W2012758205,"Mammalian STE20-like kinase (MST) is a member of the yeast STE20-related kinase family and proteolytically activated by caspase during apoptosis. However, its other cellular functions are not known, including its activation mechanism, substrate(s), and subcellular localization. In this report, using anti-MST monoclonal antibodies, we clearly show that endogenous MST is localized in cytoplasm in a leptomycin B-dependent manner. Analyses with serial deletions and point mutations show that MST has two functional nuclear export signals and, unexpectedly, another localization motif for nuclear import. When cells are treated with leptomycin, monomeric MST is accumulated more rapidly in the nucleus than dimeric MST, indicating that dimerization contributes to the cytoplasmic retention of MST. Okadaic acid, an inhibitor of phosphatase 2A, induces activation of MST and translocation into the nucleus. Using phosphopeptide-specific antibody, we directly show that okadaic acid induces phosphorylation in the activation loop of MST, and, once phosphorylated, MST is rapidly translocated to the nucleus. However, kinase-deficient MST does not enter the nucleus, indicating that phosphorylation and activation is required for okadaic acid-induced nuclear translocation. In apoptotic cells, the activation of MST does not require phosphorylation in the activation loop and occurs through the release of C-terminal regulatory domain by caspase-dependent cleavage. Kinase-deficient MST functions dominant-negatively and represses okadaic acid-induced morphological change indicating that MST plays a role in okadaic acid-induced cellular shrinkage. Our identification of cytoplasmic and nuclear localization motifs and phosphorylation-dependent translocation of MST suggests that regulation of localization is important to the biological function of MST, including its effects on cellular morphology.

In apoptotic cells, the activation of MST does not require phosphorylation in the activation loop and occurs through the release of C-terminal regulatory domain by caspase-dependent cleavage. Kinase-deficient MST functions dominant-negatively and represses okadaic acid-induced morphological change indicating that MST plays a role in okadaic acid-induced cellular shrinkage. Our identification of cytoplasmic and nuclear localization motifs and phosphorylation-dependent translocation of MST suggests that regulation of localization is important to the biological function of MST, including its effects on cellular morphology.

STE20 is a yeast mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKKK) (1.Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. J. Biol.

However, the cellular function of MST as well as that of most other STE20-like kinases is largely unknown (3.Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol.

The non-catalytic C-terminal region of MST does not show any significant similarity with that of other family members and may function as a negative regulatory domain, because its removal markedly increases the kinase activity (5.Creasy C.L.

It was reported that MST1 could be activated by stresses such as high temperature heat shock and high concentrations of sodium arsenite (2.Taylor L.K. Wang H.C. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

In some mammalian cells, MST appears to function as an upstream kinase and be involved in c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 pathways (7.Graves J.D. Gotoh Y. Draves K.E. Ambrose D. Han D.K. Wright M.

In addition, bisphosphonate, a pharmacological drug for osteoporosis, and cytotrienin A, an anti-tumor drug, have been reported to induce cleavage of MST in osteoclast and leukemia cells (8.Reszka A.A.

MST1/MST2 is a direct substrate of caspase, and truncated MST is greatly activated by the removal of its regulatory region (6.Lee K.K. Murakawa M. Nishida E. Tsubuki S. Kawashima S. Sakamaki K.

Truncated MST strongly induces cell death, suggesting that some apoptotic events are mediated by cleavage-dependent activation of MST (10.Lee K.K. Ohyama T. Yajima N. Tsubuki S. Yonehara S. J. Biol.

Interestingly, other kinases of the STE20 family such as PAK2, HPK1, and SLK, have been reported as caspase substrates, further implying that some of the family play an important role in apoptosis (11.Rudel T.

It is reported that the upper size limit for macromolecules to diffuse through the nuclear pore complex is 50–60 kDa (14.Paine P.L. Moore L.C. Horowitz S.B.

One of the major mechanisms for the cytoplasmic localization of proteins is nuclear export system. Many cytoplasmic proteins involved in cellular signaling are transported actively to the cytoplasm by nuclear export signal (NES) (16.Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol.

In contrast, selective nuclear import of protein is mediated by nuclear localization signal (NLS) and cognate transport factors known as karyopherins or importins (22.Gorlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar, 23.Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 24.Pemberton L.F. Blobel G.

The classic NLS motif consists of short sequences (5–20 residues) containing several lysine and arginine residues (26.Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E.

Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the subcellular localization and analyzed the molecular mechanism that regulates the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of MST. MST is a cytoplasmic protein that has functional NES and NLS. Using a phospho-specific antibody, we directly show that MST is phosphorylated in an activation loop, and, importantly, the phosphorylated MST is rapidly translocated to the nucleus. We propose a molecular mechanism for the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic localization and suggest that MST directly transmits signals into the nucleus. Anti-MST monoclonal antibodies were prepared as described previously (10.Lee K.K. Ohyama T. Yajima N. Tsubuki S. Yonehara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19276-19285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG M2 antibody was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co., and Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG were from Molecular Probes. Rabbit phospho-PAK1 (Thr423)/PAK2 (Thr402) antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) was purified from hybridoma using a column of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Okadaic acid, staurosporine, and Hoechst 33342 were purchased from Calbiochem. Leptomycin was a generous gift from Dr. M. Yoshida (Tokyo University). Expression constructs of MST were prepared as N-terminal FLAG-tagged or GFP-fused forms. We introduced FLAG-tag after the initiation codon in pME18S vector as described previously (10.Lee K.K.

For the GFP fusion constructs, cDNA of human MST1 or human MST2 was subcloned in-frame into pCMX-SAH/Y145F (10.Lee K.K. Ohyama T. Yajima N. Tsubuki S. Yonehara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19276-19285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Substitution of amino acid residues was performed with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. pGEG plasmid, expressing two tandem GFP proteins with a central nuclear export signal (NES) sequence derived from Xenopus MAPKK (16.Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), was generated by subcloning in-frame into pCMX-SAH/Y145F. For the cloning of PAK2, total mRNA from HPB-ALL cells was prepared. Single-stranded cDNAs were synthesized by reverse transcription, using a First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen), and then used as a template in polymerase chain reactions. Two primers, 5′-ggcctcgagatgtctgataacggagaactg-3′ and 5′-ggactgcagttaacggttactcttcattgc-3′, were used to specifically amplify the entire coding region of human PAK2. The amplified products were cloned into pME18S-FLAG vector. For kinase-deficient PAK2, Lys299 was changed to Arg by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis. HeLa and NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml kanamycin. Cells were seeded on glass chamber slides (Nalge Nunc) or plates 24 h before transfection and then transfected with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendation. HeLa and NIH 3T3 cells on chamber slides were washed with PBS and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. Fixed cells were permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and blocked in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 10 min. Cells were treated with anti-MST monoclonal antibody (1 μg/ml), anti-FLAG antibody (1 μg/ml), or anti-phospho antibody for 1 h. Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG were used at a dilution of 1:500 for 45 min. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with Hoechst 33342 (0.2 μg/ml) for 5 min. Samples were observed, and images were collected using Axioplan2 microscope (Carl Zeiss) connected to charge-coupled device camera. The figures were prepared using Photoshop software (Adobe). After 16-h transfection, cells were washed once with PBS and suspended in cold lysis buffer, 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA with the protease inhibitor mixture, Complete (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min. For immunoprecipitation, the lysate was incubated with 2 μg of anti-FLAG or anti-Myc antibody for 2 h and incubated with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) for 2 h to overnight. Cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) with 5% skim milk at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was incubated with antibody for 1 h, washed in TBST, and then incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). After further washing with TBST, peroxidase activity was detected on x-ray films using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (DuPont). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min and loaded onto a column of Superdex 200 HR 10/30. Chromatography was performed with fast protein liquid chromatography protein purification (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) at 4 °C. The column was eluted with cold lysis buffer described above. The column was calibrated with protein standards (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), including blue dextran, thyroglobulin, ferritin, catalase, bovine serum albumin, and ovalbumin. The eluted fractions were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG or anti-Myc antibody. HeLa cells were transfected with vectors encoding FLAG-MST1 and FLAG-PAK2, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. Equal amounts of immunoprecipitates as analyzed by immunoblotting were used for immune-complex kinase assay. Immunoprecipitates were incubated with 2 μg of histone H2B in 20 μl of kinase reaction buffer, 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, and 0.1 mm vanadate containing 25 μm ATP and 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P] ATP. Samples were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C, and reactions were terminated by adding 7 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. A portion of the sample (15 μl) was separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed or analyzed by phosphorimaging. Our previous study revealed that overexpressed MST was localized exclusively in the cytoplasm (10.Lee K.K. Ohyama T. Yajima N. Tsubuki S. Yonehara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19276-19285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, overexpressed proteins are not always localized in the same way as the endogenous proteins. To examine the subcellular localization of endogenous MST, we immunostained NIH 3T3 cells with two antibodies that recognize different epitopes on MST. The cytoplasm was specifically stained by indirect immunostaining with either J7B, which recognized the C-terminal region of MST, or G2B, which recognized the N-terminal catalytic domain of MST (Fig. 1A, top row) (10.Lee K.K. Ohyama T. Yajima N. Tsubuki S. Yonehara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19276-19285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A similar pattern of distribution was observed with fluorescein- or Texas Red-conjugated G2B or J7B. 2K. K. Lee and S. Yonehara, unpublished data. To investigate whether the cytoplasmic localization of MST is regulated by a nuclear export pathway, we treated NIH 3T3 cells with leptomycin (LMB), a specific inhibitor of nuclear export mediated by leucine-rich NES (29.Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Schreiner E.P. Wolff B. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9112-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). MST rapidly lost its cytoplasmic localization within 20 min after LMB treatment (Fig. 1A, bottom row). Furthermore, prolonged incubation with LMB for 60 min resulted in the nuclear accumulation of MST, indicating that MST is localized to the cytoplasm in an LMB-dependent manner. Then, we examined whether MST has a polypeptide region responsible for cytoplasmic localization. Various deletion constructs of MST1 and MST2 were prepared as GFP-fused forms, and their subcellular localization was observed (Fig. 1B). The deletion of 320 N-terminal amino acid residues, including the kinase domain or 60 C-terminal residues contributing to dimer formation did not change the cytoplasmic localization, indicating that the kinase activity and dimerization of MST were not involved in its cytoplasmic localization. However, further deletion of a central region (323–381) of MST2 resulted in a diffused localization in the cytoplasm and nucleus. When this region was fused to GFP, only a cytoplasmic localization was observed, indicating that a peptide sequence within this region is capable of functioning as a signal for cytoplasmic localization. A closer look at the region corresponding to 323–381 in MST2 revealed that leucine-rich NES-like sequences were present in MST homologues in human, mouse, rat, and even Caenorhabditis elegans, suggesting evolutionary significance (10.Lee K.K. Ohyama T. Yajima N. Tsubuki S. Yonehara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19276-19285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This region contained several conserved hydrophobic residues with typical and characteristic spacing, like the well-established NES (Fig. 2, A and B). To test whether the conserved residues are able to function as an NES, we mutated the hydrophobic residues to alanine (361A/365A and 368A/370A), and investigated the subcellular localization. Unexpectedly, FLAG-MST1361A/365A and FLAG-MST1361A/365A were still localized exclusively in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic localization did not change even when four residues were replaced with alanine (361A/365A/361A/365A). These results strongly raised the possibility that some other C-terminal region of MST is involved in the localization. Actually, MST1 and MST2 have long clusters of hydrophobic residues in C-terminal proximal regions (430–460) (Fig. 2A). Therefore, we introduced mutations in these hydrophobic residues and investigated the localization. As shown in Fig. 2C, when two residues in the C-terminal proximal region were mutated to alanine (439A/441A or 441A/444A), MST1439A/441A and MST1441A/444A still showed a cytoplasmic localization. However, when hydrophobic residues in both regions were mutated (MST1368A/370A/439A/441A and MST1368A/370A/441A/444A), the localization was changed to the nucleus (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that MST has two functional NES sequences (NES1 and NES2, see Fig. 2, A and B), and either NES1 or NES2 is sufficient for the cytoplasmic localization of full-length MST. The result that MST1 with mutations in both NES sequences (368A/370A/441A/444A, designated MST1-ΔNES) localized only in the nucleus prompted us to investigate whether MST has potential nuclear-localizing activity. This possibility was further supported by the data of Fig. 1A showing that endogenous MST was rapidly accumulated in the nucleus when cells were treated with LMB. We noticed peptide sequences near the C-terminal tail of MST1 and MST2, which is conserved throughout MST homologues and similar to the bipartite NLS consensus sequence (Fig. 2, A and B). To test whether this NLS-like sequence is capable of functioning as a NLS, the C-terminal 25 residues containing this sequence were fused to GFP (GFP-C25), and its subcellular localization was observed. As shown in Fig. 2D, GFP-C25 showed an intense nuclear localization while GFP was distributed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus. MST1-ΔNES, which is exclusively nuclear (Fig. 2C, M9), was no longer accumulated in the nucleus and showed a diffused localization when lysine residues of the putative NLS were further replaced with asparagine (480N/481N), or when the C-terminal 25 residues were further removed (Fig. 2D). MST1-ΔC25, deleted of the 25 C-terminal residues, did not accumulate in the nucleus when cells were treated with LMB for over 3 h.2 Thus, the C-terminal NLS-like sequence functions as a NLS and induces the nuclear accumulation of MST. The apparent molecular mass of 60 kDa determined by SDS-PAGE and the value of 55 kDa calculated from the peptide sequence of MST are close to the limit of diffusion through the nuclear pore complex. Because MST was reported to form a dimer (5.Creasy C.L. Ambrose D.M. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21049-21053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), we examined the relationship between dimer formation and the kinetics of the nuclear translocation. HeLa cells were co-transfected with wild-type Myc-MST1 and FLAG-MST1444P, mutated at Leu444 to proline, which is not capable of forming a dimer (5.Creasy C.L. Ambrose D.M. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21049-21053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Because the cyclic structure of the proline reside could markedly influence the protein architecture, resulting in a misfolding, we co-transfected wild-type Myc-MST1 and other FLAG-MST1 mutants in which Leu444 was replaced with alanine (444A) or neighboring Leu448 with alanine (448A). The interaction of Myc-MST1 and FLAG-tagged mutant proteins was analyzed by immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 3A). Wild-type FLAG-MST1 and FLAG-MST1448A were co-immunoprecipitated, whereas FLAG-MST1444P was not detected in the immunoprecipitates. FLAG-MST1444A was co-immunoprecipitated but less efficiently than wild-type FLAG-MST1. We then compared the elution profile of wild-type MST1 and MST1444P by size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 3B). Wild-type MST1 was eluted at a peak fraction of 250 kDa as calculated from an elution profile of protein standards. However, MST1444P was eluted at the fraction around 130 kDa, being about half the molecular size of wild-type MST1. Next, we examined the LMB-induced translocation of these mutants in HeLa cells (Fig. 3C). MST1444P lost its cytoplasmic localization within 5 min, and most cells expressing MST1444P showed a nuclear accumulation of MST within 10 min of LMB treatment. In contrast, wild-type MST1 still showed a cytoplasmic localization at 30 min (Fig. 3C) and prolonged incubation induced localization change.2 The nuclear translocation of MST1444P was much faster than that of wild-type MST1 or endogenous MST1 (Figs. 1A and 3C). MST1448A, which showed strong activity to bind wild-type MST1, was translocated to the nucleus with much slower kinetics than MST1444P. MST1444A, with weak but significant binding activity for wild-type MST1, showed intermediate translocation kinetics between MST1444P and MST1448A. We conclude that monomeric MST is translocated into the nucleus more rapidly upon treatment with LMB, and dimerization facilitates the cytoplasmic retention of MST. A general method to measure the phosphorylation of protein is in vitro kinase assay, but some members of the STE20 kinase family are markedly activated by autophosphorylation in vitro (1.Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21695-21700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 30.Pombo C.M. Kehrl J.H. Sanchez I. Katz P. Avruch J. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4537-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, the results of this assay greatly depend on the incubation time, significantly masking any difference between control and stimulated samples. PAK shares a nearly identical activation loop sequence in the kinase domain with MST, and the phosphorylation of the conserved threonine (Thr423 in PAK1, Thr402 in PAK2, and Thr183 in MST1) is required for autoactivation (32.Manser E.

In addition, anti-phosphopeptide antibody against the activation loop of PAK was reported to cross-react in vitro with phosphorylated MST (34.Sells M.A. Pfaff A. Chernoff J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1449-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We tested whether a commercially available anti-phosphopeptide antibody to PAK1/PAK2 could cross-react with activated MST. We chose as an inducer for the activation of MST, okadaic acid (OA), a specific inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A, because it activates many protein kinases and because phosphatase 2A is involved in various signaling pathways (35.Millward T.A. Zolnierowicz S. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 186-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). When HeLa cells were treated with OA, the anti-phosphopeptide antibody specifically recognized a band of around 60 kDa from cell lysates expressing FLAG-MST1 but not from untreated cell lysates (Fig. 4A). Unexpectedly, this band was not detected in cell lysates expressing FLAG-PAK2, whereas both forms of the protein were equally detected with anti-FLAG antibody. When Thr183 in MST1 was mutated to Ala, no band could be detected by OA treatment,2 indicating that Th"

Inhibition of viral replication at the entry stage of the viral life cycle is an attractive strategy because it prevents de novo infection. Soluble CD4 (sCD4), the first drug in this class, failed to suppress viral replication in vivo. At least three factors contributed to this failure: sCD4 demonstrated poor neutralizing activity against most primary isolates of HIV in vitro; it demonstrated an intrinsic capacity to enhance viral replication at low concentrations; and it exhibited a relatively short half-life in vivo. Many anti-gp120 monoclonal antibodies, including neutralizing monoclonal antibodies also enhance viral replication at suboptimal concentrations. Advances in our understanding of the events leading up to viral entry suggest strategies by which this activity can be diminished. We hypothesized that by constructing a sCD4-based molecule that is large, binds multiple gp120s simultaneously, and is highly avid toward gp120, we could remove its capacity to enhance viral entry. Here we describe the construction of a polymeric CD4-IgG1 fusion protein. The hydrodynamic radius of this molecule is ∼12 nm. It can bind at least 10 gp120 subunits with binding kinetics that suggest a highly avid interaction toward virion-associated envelope. This protein does not enhance viral replication at suboptimal concentrations. These observations may aid in the design of new therapeutics and vaccines.

However, toxicities associated with long term highly active antiretroviral therapy have put a high priority on the design and development of less toxic therapies. Among the “next generation” of antiviral inhibitors is T-20 (2.Wild C. Dubay J.W. Greenwell T. Baird Jr., T. Oas T.G. McDanal C. Hunter E. Matthews T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cairns J.S. Plaeger S.F. JAMA (J. Am. Med. Assoc.). 2000; 284: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Receptor docking is a multistep process that begins with the gp120 component of a virion spike binding to the CD4 receptor on the target cell. Conformational changes in gp120 induced by gp120-CD4 interaction promote a high affinity interaction between gp120 and either CCR5 or CXCR4 cellular co-receptors. This is followed by gp41-mediated fusion of the viral and target cell membranes. Agents designed to block gp120-CD4, gp120-CCR5/CXCR4, or gp41/cell membrane interactions are in various stages of development (5.D'Souza M.P. Cairns J.S. Plaeger S.F. JAMA (J. Am. Med. Assoc.). 2000; 284: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Several laboratories have constructed recombinant proteins that fuse the gp120 binding domain of CD4 to immunoglobulin constant domains (6.Deen K.C. McDougal J.S. Inacker R. Folena-Wasserman G.

J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6609-6617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike monomeric soluble CD4 (sCD4), these Ig fusion proteins are able to efficiently neutralize primary isolates of HIV in vitro. This increased capacity to neutralize probably results from increased avidity associated with the multivalent presentation of gp120 binding epitopes. Of note, a highly potent tetravalent CD4-Ig fusion protein termed Pro-542 is currently being evaluated in clinical trials (11.Jacobson J.M. Lowy I. Fletcher C.V. O'Neill T.J. Tran D.N. Ketas T.J. Trkola A. Klotman M.E. Maddon P.J. Olson W.C. Israel R.J. J. Infect. Dis. 2000; 182: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The strategy underlying these CD4-based therapies (i.e.blocking the interaction between gp120 and the CD4 receptor) encompasses advantages distinct from current highly active antiretroviral therapy regimens. In particular, such agents, by blocking de novo infection, may prevent the expansion of viral reservoirs. Monomeric sCD4 was one of the first reagents in this group to be tested clinically (12.Schooley R.T. Merigan T.C. Gaut P. Hirsch M.S. Holodniy M. Flynn T. Liu S. Byington R.E. Henochowicz S. Gubish E. Spriggs D. Kufe D. Schindler J. Dawson A. Thomas D. Ann. Intern. Med. 1990; 112: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, sCD4 failed to demonstrate significant antiviral activity in vivo (12.Schooley R.T. Merigan T.C. Gaut P. Hirsch M.S. Holodniy M. Flynn T. Liu S. Byington R.E. Henochowicz S. Gubish E. Spriggs D. Kufe D. Schindler J. Dawson A. Thomas D. Ann. Intern. Med. 1990; 112: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Among the problems inherent to sCD4 was its inability to efficiently neutralize primary isolates of HIV. The differential capacity of sCD4 to neutralize tissue culture laboratory-adapted strains versus many primary isolates is striking. In the initial report describing this difference, Ho and colleagues (13.Ashkenazi A. Smith D.H. Marsters S.A. Riddle L. Gregory T.J. Ho D.D. Capon D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7056-7060Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) found that the concentrations of sCD4 required to neutralize primary isolates in vitro were up to 1000-fold higher than those required to neutralize tissue culture laboratory-adapted strains. Additional properties of sCD4 are likely to have contributed to its failure in the clinic. At low concentrations, sCD4 enhances the infectivity of most primary isolates (14.Allan J.S. Strauss J. Buck D.W. Science. 1990; 247: 1084-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 15.Clapham P.R. McKnight A. Weiss R.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3531-3537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Moore J.P.

This property is of particular concern, because sCD4 exhibited an extremely short serum half-life (23.Davis C.B. Boyle K.E. Urbanski J.J. Paradysz R.T. Fong K.L. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1992; 20: 695-705PubMed Google Scholar). This unfavorable pharmacokinetic property increases the likelihood that at sites of viral replication (i.e. lymphoid tissue), concentration gradients favoring enhanced replication of HIV-1 could occur. The precise molecular basis underlying sCD4-mediated enhancement of virus replication is unclear. In vitro, the relatively low concentrations of sCD4 that result in enhancement represent a large molar excess over gp120 present in the culture. If those concentrations are increased substantially, many primary isolates can be neutralized. These observations suggest that only when a sufficient number of spikes per virion are fully occupied will sCD4 effectively inhibit virus entry (24.Layne S.P. Merges M.J. Dembo M. Spouge J.L. Nara P.L. Nature. 1990; 346: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The concentration required to achieve that state is likely to be extremely high for two reasons. First, sCD4 must compete with surface-bound CD4 receptors, which are presented in bulk on the surface of a target cell. Because sCD4-gp120 ligation involves slow binding kinetics and substantial changes in entropy, gp120 avidity effects strongly favor membrane-associated receptors (25.Myszka D.G. Sweet R.W. Hensley P. Brigham-Burke M. Kwong P.D. Hendrickson W.A. Wyatt R. Sodroski J. Doyle M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9026-9031Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). 2P. Kwong, personal communcation. 2P. Kwong, personal communcation. Second, sCD4-gp120 ligation promotes a high affinity interaction between gp120 and CCR5 (26.Doranz B.J. Baik S.S. Doms R.W. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 10346-10358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Trkola A. Dragic T. Arthos J. Binley J.M. Olson W.C. Allaway G.P. Cheng-Mayer C. Robinson J. Maddon P.J. Moore J.P.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9405-9416Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), thus further increasing the apparent affinity of gp120 for the plasma membrane. Enhancement of viral entry is not solely a consequence of sCD4-gp120 ligation. It is well established that many monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), including neutralizing mAbs also enhance viral entry at suboptimal concentrations (19.Schutten M. Andeweg A.C. Bosch M.L. Osterhaus A.D. Scand. J. Immunol. 1995; 41: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 20.Sullivan N. Sun Y. Li J. Hofmann W. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4413-4422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, polyclonal antibodies derived from HIV-infected individuals can also enhance viral replication (19.Schutten M. Andeweg A.C. Bosch M.L. Osterhaus A.D. Scand. J. Immunol. 1995; 41: 18-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To develop more potent entry inhibitors and more effective vaccine immunogens it is important to better define the biochemical events surrounding this phenomenon and to develop strategies that eliminate it. We hypothesized that if sCD4 was modified such that it could more efficiently compete with membrane-associated CD4, block interactions between activated spikes and CCR5, and occupy multiple gp120s within a spike, then it would no longer enhance viral replication at suboptimal concentrations. In this regard, we adopted a strategy that utilizes the 18-amino acid secretory tailpiece (αtp) of IgA (30.Chaikin, M., Lyn, S., Reddy, M., Kariv, I., Brigham-Burke, M., Doyle, M., Culp, J., Truneh, A., and Sweet, R.

Immunol. 1997; 158: 1719-1726PubMed Google Scholar). αtp is encoded at the extreme carboxyl terminus of IgA and bears significant sequence homology to the μ tailpiece (μtp), which is encoded at the carboxyl terminus of IgM. Unlike μtp, which, in conjunction with the j chain, promotes the formation of pentamers, αtp does not promote oligomerization of IgA beyond a dimer. However, when fused to the carboxyl terminus of an IgG1 heavy chain, αtp promotes the formation of a large recombinant immunoglobulin that is predicted to consist of 12 IgG1 heavy chains (30.Chaikin, M., Lyn, S., Reddy, M., Kariv, I., Brigham-Burke, M., Doyle, M., Culp, J., Truneh, A., and Sweet, R.

The two N-terminal domains of CD4, termed D1 and D2 (33.Ryu S.E. Kwong P.D. Truneh A. Porter T.G. Arthos J. Rosenberg M. Dai X.P. Xuong N.H. Axel R. Sweet R.W. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1990; 348: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), encode the gp120 binding epitope and, when expressed in the absence of the remaining domains of CD4, retain the capacity to bind gp120 (34.Arthos J. Deen K.C. Chaikin M.A. Fornwald J.A. Sathe G. Sattentau Q.J. Clapham P.R. Weiss R.A. McDougal J.S. Pietropaolo C. Cell. 1989; 57: 469-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). We fused the coding sequences of D1 and D2 to that of Igαtp, creating a recombinant protein we term D1D2-Igαtp. Such a recombinant protein should theoretically exhibit a mass close to 800 kDa and present 12 gp120 binding sites. We predicted that the presentation of 12 closely spaced gp120 binding sites should improve the capacity of sCD4 to compete with membrane CD4 for virion-associated gp120. We further hypothesized that the extremely large size of this protein should preclude any interaction between activated virion spikes and CCR5 on the target cell membrane. In this report, we demonstrate that this protein, termed D1D2-Igαtp, in contrast to sCD4, does not enhance the entry of primary isolates into CD4+ T cells at suboptimal concentrations. Virion entry into primary lymphocytes was measured using a quantitative real time PCR assay based upon the generation of early long terminal repeat transcripts, adapted from a method previously described (35.Chun T.W. Chadwick K. Margolick J. Siliciano R.F. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4436-4444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were activated (OKT3 (1 μg/ml)/interleukin-2 (50 units/ml) for 3 days and then depleted of CD8+ T cells by magnetic bead selection (Dynal, Lake Success NY). 3 × 106 cells were incubated in a volume of 100 μl with the addition of titered viral stocks (Advanced Biotechnologies Columbia, MD) for 2 h at 37 °C. Where specified, monomeric sCD4 and D1D2-Igαtp (see below) were preincubated with virus stocks for 10 min at 37 °C prior to cell inoculation. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted through a 100% fetal bovine serum (FBS) cushion (heat-inactivated), and then resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/FBS (heat-inactivated) and incubated an additional 4 h. Cells were washed and then lysed in a buffer containing an anionic detergent (Gentra, Minneapolis, MN) and RNase A. DNA was precipitated from lysates in isopropyl alcohol and resuspended in distilled H2O. Quantitative real time PCR was carried out using the following primers and probe: RU5 forward primer, 5′-gctaactagggaacccactgctt-3′; RU5 reverse primer, 5′-acaacagacgggcacacactact-3′; RU5 probe, 5′-agcctcaataaagcttgccttgagtgcttc-3′. Copy numbers were standardized against genomic DNA obtained from an ACH-2 cell line carrying a single integrated HIV-1 genome in each diploid cell (36.Folks T. Powell D.M. Lightfoote M.M. Benn S.

The D1D2-Igαtp is predicted to be a hexamer of a dimer (12 binding sites). The D1D2-Igαtp expression vector was designed after a CD86-Igαtp constructed by Sweet and colleagues (30.Chaikin, M., Lyn, S., Reddy, M., Kariv, I., Brigham-Burke, M., Doyle, M., Culp, J., Truneh, A., and Sweet, R.

Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). This vector contains a cytomegalovirus promoter for high level expression of D1D2-Igαtp as well as a gene cassette containing dihydrofolate reductase for amplification in dihydrofolate reductase-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells (American Type Culture Collection catalogue no. CRL9096). Purified plasmids were transfected into dihydrofolate reductase-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells by a modified calcium phosphate transfection procedure (Invitrogen). Positive transfectants were initially selected by growth in α-minimal essential medium without nucleosides supplemented with dialyzed fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). To increase expression, positive transfectants were pooled and cultured in the presence of increasing concentrations of methotrexate (Sigma) as previously described (34.Arthos J. Deen K.C. Chaikin M.A. Fornwald J.A. Sathe G. Sattentau Q.J. Clapham P.R. Weiss R.A. McDougal J.S. Pietropaolo C. Cell. 1989; 57: 469-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Cell clones expressing high levels of D1D2-Igαtp were identified by Western blot with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against sCD4. Clones were subsequently cultured in hollow fiber cartridges (FiberCell Systems, Frederick, MD) using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 4% heat-inactivated FBS without methotrexate. Proteins were harvested daily from the extracapillary space, yielding greater than 5 mg/harvest. D1D2-Igαtp protein was purified in two steps. Initially, supernatants from the extracapillary space of the hollow fiber cartridge were passed over a Hi-Trap protein A column (Amersham Biosciences). Bound protein was eluted in 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 3.0, and rapidly neutralized with 2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Peak fractions were subsequently pooled, concentrated, and passed over either a Superdex Hi-load 26/60 or a Superdex 200 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) in phosphate-buffered saline, and the peak fraction was collected. With the exception of analytical ultracentrifugation and dynamic light scattering experiments, this was the fraction employed in all biological assays. Silver staining of SDS-PAGE gels indicated that the purity of protein obtained in this manner was >98%. Protein preparations were determined to be endotoxin-free using the Chromogenic Limulus Amebocyte Lysate method (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). All binding assays were performed using a BIA3000 optical biosensor (Biacore, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). Ligands were immobilized onto the surface of a CM5 sensor chip using the standard amine coupling procedure described by Biacore, Inc. Briefly, the carboxyl groups on the sensor surface were activated by injecting 35 μl of 0.2 m N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide, 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide. The ligand, suspended in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.0–5.5 (depending on the ligand used) was passed over the activated surface until the desired surface density was reached. Unreacted carboxyl groups were capped by injecting 35 μl of 1 m ethanolamine (pH 8.0). Bovine serum albumin was immobilized on the surface of one flow cell as a reference surface to control for nonspecific binding of analyte. The running buffer used was 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.01% surfactant P-20, 0.5% soluble carboxymethyl dextran (Fluka BioChemika, Inc.). All binding experiments were performed in duplicate and at 25 °C. sCD4 or HIV-1 gp120 was directly immobilized onto the surface of CM5 sensor chips as described above to surface densities of ∼250 response units (RU) for sCD4 and 500 RU for gp120. This was followed by injection of increasing concentrations of gp120 or sCD4, respectively. The surface was regenerated after each cycle by injecting 25 μl of 5 mm NaOH, 1 m NaCl, followed by a second injection of 25 μl of 4.5 m MgCl2. Association and dissociation rate constants were calculated using the BiaEvaluation 3.1 software (Biacore, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). To determine the ratio of gp120 monomers bound per D1D2-Igαtp construct, D1D2-Igαtp in running buffer was passed over a sensor surface to which protein A had been previously immobilized (surface density ∼1500 RU). The final surface density of D1D2-Igαtp was ∼250 RU, and it was reloaded to this density at the beginning of each cycle. After loading of D1D2-Igαtp, the surface was allowed to stabilize for 5 min, at which time the specified concentrations of gp120 in running buffer were passed over the surface for a total of 10 min. The surface was completely regenerated using three sequential 25-μl injections of 10 mm HCl. Stoichiometries were calculated from the experimentally derived amount of D1D2-Igαtp and gp120 bound per cycle (in RU) using the conversion factor 1 RU = 1 pg of protein bound/mm2 of flow cell surface area and the molecular masses of the proteins (D1D2-Igαtp = 800,000 Da, gp120 = 120,000 Da). Virus coculture was carried out as previously described (35.Chun T.W. Chadwick K. Margolick J. Siliciano R.F. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4436-4444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, PBMCs from HIV-1-infected donors were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque and enriched for CD4+ T lymphocytes by negative selection with a mixture of antibody-conjugated magnetic beads (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada). Cells were cultured in RPMI, 10% FBS (heat-inactivated) plus OKT3 (1 μg/ml) and interleukin-2 (50 units/ml). In addition, 3-day activated CD8+ T cell-depleted PBMCs from uninfected donors were added at a ratio of ∼2:1 as necessary. Cultures treated with monomeric sCD4 or D1D2-Igαtp were fed with media containing these proteins such that the original concentration was maintained. Virus replication was assessed by harvesting culture supernatants at regular intervals and measuring p24 antigen using an HIV-1 p24 Antigen Capture Kinetic ELISA (Coulter, Miami, FL). Freshly isolated donor PBMCs were propagated in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and stimulated with OKT3 (1 μg/ml) and interleukin-2 (50 units/ml). Prior to infection, cells were screened by PCR for CCR5 wild-type homozygosity. Three days after stimulation, CD8+ cells were depleted by magnetic bead separation (Dynal, Lake Success, NY) and inoculated with virus as indicated at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. Primary isolates were established from 6-day coculture of patient and normal donor CD8-depleted PBMCs. Cells were exposed to virus for 2 h at 37 °C and then washed extensively in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml in 24-well tissue culture plates. Immediately after plating, various inhibitors were added. Supernatants were collected every other day, and virus replication was measured by a kinetic p24 antigen capture ELISA (Coulter, Miami, FL). Inhibitor concentrations were maintained in the culture supernatants throughout the culture period. Sedimentation velocity experiments were conducted with the Beckman Optima XL-I/A analytical ultracentrifuge using interference optics, with 400 g of protein (1 μg/μl) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline at a rotor speed of 30,000 rpm and a rotor temperature of 20 °C. Data were analyzed by direct boundary modeling with a continuous distribution of Lamm equation solutions (38.Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar) and algebraic noise decomposition (39.Schuck P. Demeler B. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2288-2296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The distribution of Lamm equation solutions c(s) were calculated with maximum entropy regularization with p = 0.68. For deconvolution of the diffusion, the best fit average frictional ratio of 1.5 was used (40.Schuck P. Perugini M.A. Gonzales N.R. Howlett G.J. Schubert D. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1096-1111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), resulting in root mean square deviations of the direct boundary fit of <0.004 fringes in all cases. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed with the absorbance optics at a wavelength of 280 nm and a rotor temperature of 4 °C. Equilibrium was attained at rotor speeds of 3000, 5000, and 7500 rpm with best fit distributions with a single species model for the determination of the weight-average molar mass (41.Svedberg T. Pederson K.O. The Ultracentrifuge. Oxford University Press, London1940Google Scholar). Using tabulated values of the partial specific volume of amino acids (42.Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Libgeway T.M.

We report here that low micromolar concentrations of Zn2+ inhibited hormone- or forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in N18TG2 neuroblastoma cells. Similarly, low concentrations inhibited hormone- and forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity in membrane preparations and did so primarily by altering the Vmax of the enzyme. Zn2+ also inhibited recombinant isoforms, indicating that this reflects a direct interaction with the enzyme. The IC50 for Zn2+inhibition was ∼1–2 μm with a Hill coefficient of 1.33. The dose-response curve for Zn2+ inhibition was identical for AC1, AC5, and AC6 as well as for the C441R mutant of AC5 whose defect appears to be in one of the catalytic metal binding sites. However, AC2 displayed a distinct dose-response curve. These data in combination with the findings that Zn2+ inhibition was not competitive with Mg2+ or Mg2+/ATP suggest that the inhibitory Zn2+ binding site is distinct from the metal binding sites involved in catalysis. The prestimulated enzyme was found to be less susceptible to Zn2+ inhibition, suggesting that the ability of Zn2+ to inhibit AC could be significantly influenced by the coincidence timing of the input signals to the enzyme.

In general, Zn2+ is required as either a catalytic or structural component for a large number of enzymes and thus contributes to a wide variety of important biological processes including gene expression, replication, hormonal storage and release, neurotransmission, and memory. Zn2+ is also critical for the structural integrity of cells, influencing membrane stability and cytoskeletal organization (reviewed in Refs. 1.Cuajungco M.P. Lees G.J. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 4: 137-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 2.Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Frederickson C.J. Suh S.W. Silva D. Frederickson C.J. Thompson R.B. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: S1471-S1483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this light, it is not surprising that dietary Zn2+ deprivation is lethal in mice and in man has been associated with a variety of abnormalities related to growth, sexual maturation, and wound healing (4.Choi D.W. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1996; 61: 385-387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The complexity of Zn2+ actions is further appreciated by the fact that the consequences of excess Zn2+ are also severe being associated with a number of neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy (1.Cuajungco M.P. Lees G.J. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 4: 137-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 2.Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Frederickson C.J. Suh S.W. Silva D. Frederickson C.J. Thompson R.B. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: S1471-S1483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Toward understanding the paradoxical functions of Zn2+, attention has focused on defining the critical candidates that mediate its effects and whether they can reflect the physiological, pharmacological, or toxicological effects of the metal. In the brain, Zn2+ along with iron is the most concentrated metal (1.Cuajungco M.P. Lees G.J. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 4: 137-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 2.Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H.

Significant levels of chelatable histochemically reactive Zn2+ are present in a subset of glutamatergic neurons in which Zn2+ appears to be localized to synaptic vesicles (5.Assaf S.Y. Chung S.H. Nature. 1984; 308: 734-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 6.Frederickson C.J. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1989; 31: 145-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 7.Xie X.M. Smart T.G. Nature. 1991; 349: 521-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). These Zn2+-containing neurons are primarily located in the hippocampus (mossy fibers), striatum, and neocortex. The concentrations of Zn2+ within these vesicles have been estimated to be as high as millimolar levels (3.Frederickson C.J. Suh S.W. Silva D. Frederickson C.J. Thompson R.B. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: S1471-S1483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neuronal firing results in the release of both glutamate and Zn2+ into the synaptic cleft (4.Choi D.W. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1996; 61: 385-387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Assaf S.Y. Chung S.H. Nature. 1984; 308: 734-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar, 6.Frederickson C.J. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1989; 31: 145-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 7.Xie X.M. Smart T.G. Nature. 1991; 349: 521-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Intense firing can result in Zn2+concentrations of several hundred micromolars (4.Choi D.W. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1996; 61: 385-387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This estimate is based upon the accumulation of Zn2+ in the perfusate of hippocampal slices. Thus, the actual localized concentrations of the metal may be significantly greater. The fate of neuronally released Zn2+ is not totally clear. It is likely that some of the metal is taken back up by the presynaptic neurons and reconcentrated into vesicles (8.Wensink J. Molenaar A. Woroniecka U. Van den Hamer C. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 782-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The movement of Zn2+ from presynaptic to postsynaptic cell has been documented. In general, this translocation is associated with the neurotoxic effects of Zn2+ (4.Choi D.W. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1996; 61: 385-387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, excessive firing of mossy fibers of the hippocampus leads to selective Zn2+ uptake and the destruction of the CA1 neurons that are innervated by these bundles. However, the fact that Zn2+ translocation from presynaptic to postsynaptic cells occurs allows for the possibility that this metal is also used in the central nervous system as a transcellular messenger (1.Cuajungco M.P. Lees G.J. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 4: 137-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 2.Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Frederickson C.J. Suh S.W. Silva D. Frederickson C.J. Thompson R.B. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: S1471-S1483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The immediate targets of intracellular Zn2+ are unclear as are the physiological consequences of its actions on specific targets. In neuronal cells, targets such as glyceraldehyde 3′-phosphate dehydrogenase, NAD-catabolizing activities such as poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase, or the production of reactive oxygen species have been proposed as mediators of Zn2+ neurotoxicity (for review, see Ref. 9.Sheline C.T. Behrens M.M. Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3139-3146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). However, Zn2+deprivation is also cytotoxic, and there are numerous examples where culturing cells in Zn2+-deficient medium results in cell death, whereas higher external concentrations of Zn2+appear as antiapoptotic (for review, see Ref. 10.Troung-Tran A.Q. Ho L.H. Chai F. Zalewski P.D. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: S1459-S1466Crossref Google Scholar and references therein). In that case, Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent endonucleases, caspases, Bcl2/Bax ratios, and cytoskeletal components are some of the proposed targets that Zn2+ modulates with a protective outcome. In light of the importance of cAMP as a second messenger, we have examined whether Zn2+ could elicit its effects by altering adenylyl cyclase (AC) 1The abbreviations used are: ACadenylyl cyclasePGE1prostaglandin E1Gαsα subunit of G protein that stimulates adenylyl cyclasePDEphosphodiesterase 1The abbreviations used are: ACadenylyl cyclasePGE1prostaglandin E1Gαsα subunit of G protein that stimulates adenylyl cyclasePDEphosphodiesteraseactivity. Biochemical studies of mutant ACs and recent crystallographic studies of a truncated soluble form of AC have indicated that the enzyme possesses two catalytic metal binding sites (11.Zimmermann G. Zhou D. Taussig R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19650-19655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 12.Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Johnson R.A. Gosselin G. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography studies distinguished these two sites by their preferential occupancy by either Zn2+ or Mn2+. Although both sites are presumed to be occupied by Mg2+ in vivo (12.Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Johnson R.A. Gosselin G. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), these observations allow for the possibility that Zn2+ could influence cAMP production particularly in the brain where Zn2+ concentrations are significant. In the studies reported here, we have examined the effects of Zn2+ on cAMP signaling in N18TG2 neuroblastoma cells. We have determined that low micromolar concentrations of Zn2+inhibit hormone- and forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation directly by inhibiting AC. Furthermore, we have characterized the potent inhibitory effects of Zn2+ on AC in both isolated N18TG2 membranes and membranes isolated from Sf9 cells expressing recombinant isoforms. adenylyl cyclase prostaglandin E1 α subunit of G protein that stimulates adenylyl cyclase phosphodiesterase adenylyl cyclase prostaglandin E1 α subunit of G protein that stimulates adenylyl cyclase phosphodiesterase N18TG2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 (1:1) medium containing 10% heat-inactivated donor bovine calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. The medium was changed 16–24 h prior to experimentation, and cells were confluent at the time of experimentation. Cells were dissociated from flasks by gentle trituration with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.6 mm EDTA and resuspended to 2 × 106 cells/ml in Gey's balanced salt solution without calcium but containing 0.1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.4, and the phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor Ro20-1724 at 0.1 mm. Cells were incubated in that buffer in a shaking 37 °C water bath for increasing time periods during which different concentrations of Zn2+ were added. To determine cAMP levels in intact N18TG2 cells, we treated cells with or without stimulatory agents for a maximum of 4 min, a time within the linear range of stimulation, and then lysed them by boiling in sodium acetate, pH 4.5 (13.Tao Y.-P. Najafi L. Shipley S. Howlett A. Klein C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 298-304PubMed Google Scholar). cAMP levels in the soluble fraction were measured using a modified Gilman assay (14.Brostrom C. Kon C. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). All assay points were taken in triplicate and assayed in triplicate. Triplicates generally agreed within 5% (13.Tao Y.-P. Najafi L. Shipley S. Howlett A. Klein C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 298-304PubMed Google Scholar). Protein determinations were done according to Bradford (15.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215575) Google Scholar). Membrane-bound AC activity was assayed by incubating N18TG2 and Hi5 membranes for 20 min or Sf9 membranes for 10 min at 30 °C in a HEPES-buffered mixture containing Mg2+, ATP, an ATP-regenerating system, cAMP, and PDE inhibitors (0.1 mm Ro20-1724 or isobutylmethylxanthine, respectively) and monitoring the conversion of [α-32P]ATP to [32P]cAMP (16.Howlett A.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 21: 664-670PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Roth B.L. Beinfeld M.C. Howlett A.C. J. Neurochem. 1984; 42: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 18.McVey M. Hill J. Howlett A. Klein C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18887-18892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Unless indicated otherwise, ATP and MgCl2 were added at 0.5 and 10 mm, respectively, and EDTA was not added to the reaction mixture. When PGE1-stimulated AC activity in N18TG2 membranes was monitored, 10−4m GTP was added. All samples were assayed in triplicate in agreement generally within 5%. The data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Enzyme activity is proportional to the concentration of membranes and the time of incubation. Unless indicated otherwise, when Zn2+ was added, it was present in the reaction mixture at the start of the incubation. The concentrations of Zn2+ added do not interfere with the energy-regenerating system. Because AC activity in Sf9 membranes is not dependent upon that system, it could be eliminated without altering the dose-response curves for Zn2+ inhibition. It is also noted that the concentrations of Zn2+ were sufficiently low as not to alter the concentration of Mg-ATP available as the substrate. This finding was evaluated using the free WinmaxC software developed by C. Patton at Stanford (Palo Alto, CA). [α-32P]ATP and [3H]cAMP were purchased from ICN and PerkinElmer Life Sciences, respectively. Tissue culture medium was purchased from Biowhittaker (Walkersville, MD). Heat-inactivated donor bovine calf serum was from JHR Biosciences (Lenexa, KS). All other reagents were from Sigma. N18TG2 cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 300 μm Zn2+ for 2 h, and cAMP accumulation in response to forskolin and PGE1 stimulation was monitored. As seen in Fig. 1, the incubation of cells with Zn2+ resulted in a dramatic attenuation of cAMP accumulation in response to both stimuli. It is unlikely that the low levels of cAMP reflect a stimulation of a PDE by Zn2+, because cells were preincubated throughout the experiment with PDE inhibitors. Moreover, Zn2+ had no effect on nonstimulated (basal) cAMP levels, also arguing against a Zn2+ effect on PDE activity. Because forskolin binds to and directly activates AC, the inhibition of cAMP accumulation would not likely reflect a primary effect on hormone receptors or Gs. When cells were preincubated with the heavy metal ionophore, pyrithione, a greater inhibition by Zn2+ was observed, suggesting that internalization of Zn2+ is necessary for the inhibition of cAMP production (Fig. 1). The extracellular levels of Zn2+ necessary to observe this inhibition were examined (Fig. 2). Little effect on forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation was seen when cells were preincubated with 1 or 10 μm ZnCl2 for 2 h. Preincubation with 25 μm ZnCl2resulted in an approximate 25–30% attenuation of the forskolin response, whereas 150 μm resulted in an approximate 60–70% inhibition. When cells were incubated with Zn2+ and 5 μm pyrithione, concentrations of Zn2+as low as 10 μm could significantly inhibit cellular cAMP accumulation in response to forskolin, and complete inhibition was observed at ∼25 μm ZnCl2. Thus, the relatively high extracellular concentrations of Zn2+ appear necessary to allow for the accumulation of sufficient intracellular levels. This is not unusual. For example, high concentrations of Zn2+ will suppress apoptosis in model cell culture systems, but concentrations approaching serum levels of Zn2+ (15–25 μm) will do so if pyrithione is present to facilitate uptake (19.Zalewski P.D. Forbes I.J. Betts W.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). In the experiment shown in this figure, pyrithione alone had a slight inhibitory action on forskolin-stimulated cAMP production. This effect was inconsistent and relatively minor such as not to alter the interpretation of the data. Fig. 3 indicates that when cells were preincubated with 100 μm ZnCl2, a time period of more than 60 min was necessary to observe significant inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation. The extent of inhibition increased with time and appeared maximum after 120 min. However, when pyrithione was present, the inhibition could be observed even after 30 min of incubation. In that case, maximum inhibition seemed to require between 60 and 90 min of incubation. The time dependence of the effects of Zn2+ is consistent with an uptake process that appears to be a limiting factor in eliciting the inhibition of cAMP accumulation. It is generally accepted that the transfer of metals across the plasma membranes involves metal complexes that influence the efficiency with which the metal is delivered or transferred (8.Wensink J. Molenaar A. Woroniecka U. Van den Hamer C. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 782-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 21.Kaplan J. Jordan I. Sturrock A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2997-3004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Powell S.R. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: S1447-S1454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Trombley P.Q. Horning M.S. Blakemore L.J. Biochemistry (Moscow). 2000; 65: 807-816PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we evaluated the inhibition of cAMP accumulation by Zn2+ when the metal was presented as ZnCl2 or as a complex of zinc ascorbate. As shown in Fig. 4, Zn2+ became a more potent inhibitor of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation when ascorbate was present. In that case, significant inhibition was observed with 25 μm Zn2+ and appeared almost maximum with 75 μm. In contrast, zinc citrate and ZnSO4 behaved in a fashion similar to ZnCl2 (data not shown). Plasma membranes purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation from N18TG2 cells were assayed for hormone-stimulated AC activity in the presence of varied concentrations of ZnCl2. As shown in Fig. 5A, micromolar concentrations of Zn2+ effectively inhibited AC activity such that at 60 μm ZnCl2, little PGE1-stimulated enzyme activity could be detected. The IC50 for ZnCl2 was ∼8–9 μm. Similar results were obtained using ZnSO4. Because the assay for AC is performed in the presence of a PDE inhibitor and PDE activity is monitored by the tracer [3H]cAMP present in the assay, it is clear that the decreased levels of cAMP do not reflect the activation of PDE by Zn2+. Low micromolar concentrations of Zn2+also effectively inhibited forskolin-stimulated AC activity (Fig. 5B). However, in this case, significant forskolin-stimulated activity could still be observed when 60 μmZnCl2 was present. The data, analyzed as a simple two-site binding model, suggested that two classes of binding sites could be present, one with an apparent IC50 of ∼2–3 μm and another greater than 10-fold. We first determined the effects of Zn2+ on forskolin-stimulated AC activity measured at increasing concentrations of substrate. The results obtained when AC activity in N18TG2 membranes was assayed in the presence or absence of 10 μm Zn2+ are depicted in Fig. 6A. An analysis of the rate of substrate utilization indicated that the Km slightly increased from 0.23 ± 0.02 to 0.39 ± 0.09 mm in the presence of Zn2+. The Vmax of the activity in N18TG2 membranes showed a 2-fold decrease in the presence of Zn2+ going from 645 ± 19 pmol/min/mg to 318 ± 25 pmol/min/mg. Current data indicate that the active site of AC contains two metal ion binding sites referred to as A and B, which can be selectively occupied by Zn2+ and Mn2+, respectively (12.Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Johnson R.A. Gosselin G. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). To assess whether the inhibitory Zn2+ site is indeed the metal site A, we also assayed forskolin-stimulated activity using a constant ATP concentration and varying Mg2+ concentrations in the absence or presence of Zn2+. As depicted in Fig. 6B, the presence of 40 μm ZnCl2resulted in an approximate 4-fold decrease in Vmax. The respective Vmaxvalues were 258 ± 11 pmol/min/mg and 73 ± 10 pmol/min/mg. Km values were 0.6 ± 0.6 μm and 1.3 ± 0.12 μm when AC activity was measured in the absence and presence of 40 μm Zn2+, respectively. With 10 μm ZnCl2, we observed an approximate 2-fold decrease in both the apparent Km and Vmax for the Mg2+ dependence of AC activity (data not shown). The sum of the data suggests that the major effect of Zn2+on AC activity is to reduce the rate of enzyme conversion of substrate to product. N18TG2 cells appear to express AC6 as their predominant activity (18.McVey M. Hill J. Howlett A. Klein C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18887-18892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To determine whether AC itself is the target of Zn2+ inhibition, we examined recombinant AC6. We also examined the other member of this isoform family, AC5, which is expressed primarily in the striatum, a site of relatively high neuronal levels of Zn2+ (reviewed in Refs. 1.Cuajungco M.P. Lees G.J. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 4: 137-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 2.Vallee B.L. Falchuk K.H. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 79-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Frederickson C.J. Suh S.W. Silva D. Frederickson C.J. Thompson R.B. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: S1471-S1483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 24.Iyengar R. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 25.Mons N. Cooper D.M.F. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 536-542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 26.Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Low micromolar concentrations of Zn2+ effectively inhibited the forskolin-stimulated activity of both isoforms (Fig. 7A). The data were identical to those obtained when ZnSO4 or ZnCl2 plus ascorbate was evaluated (data not shown). The fact that Zn2+ inhibits the recombinant enzyme indicates that this reflects a direct interaction with the enzyme. The inhibition of forskolin-stimulated AC5 and AC6 activity was dramatic (100% at 10 μm) occurring over a narrow range of Zn2+concentrations. An analysis of the data by Hill plot revealed a coefficient of 1.33, indicating that the inhibition was a cooperative process. The IC50 for ZnCl2 inhibition was ∼1–2 μm, a value similar to that of the apparent higher affinity site seen when forskolin-stimulated AC activity in N18TG2 membranes was monitored. No evidence for the lower affinity site present in N18TG2 membranes was obtained in our experiments using recombinant enzyme. This would suggest that the apparent lower affinity site seen using N18TG2 membranes is not inherent to the AC enzyme but may reflect the participation of additional AC regulators present in those membranes. Because of the lower specific activity of the AC6 preparations, additional analyses were performed using AC5. The inability of Zn2+ to dramatically alter the Km for Mg2+ or Mg2+/ATP would suggest that Zn2+ is not competitively inhibiting the binding of Mg2+ and, therefore, is not binding to metal site A. To further address this issue, we assessed the dose-response curve for Zn2+inhibition of AC5 and of the activity in N18TG2 membranes using a range of Mg2+ concentrations varying from 3 to 40 mm. Concentrations of Mg2+ >50 mm were found to be partially inhibitory and were therefore not investigated. The reasons for this inhibition are currently unclear. The dose-response curve obtained when 40 mm MgCl2 was added to the assay for recombinant AC5 is representative of the results and is shown in Fig. 7B. A comparison with the data in Fig. 7A indicates that the dose-response curve was unaffected by the increased concentration of Mg2+ present. Neither the IC50nor the cooperative nature of the inhibition by Zn2+ was altered. Reducing the Mg2+ concentration to 3 mm also did not change the enzyme sensitivity to Zn2+ (data not shown). Such findings are consistent with the premise that Zn2+ does not bind to a catalytic metal binding site unless Zn2+ binds to such a site in a manner that appears kinetically irreversible. Several experiments were performed to address the reversible nature of Zn2+ inhibition. In the experiment shown in Fig. 8A, we monitored the time course of AC5 inhibition by 15 μm Zn2+. As shown, the rate of forskolin-stimulated enzyme activity in the presence of Zn2+ was reduced but linear over the time frame of the experiment, suggestive of a reversible reaction (27.Zhang R.-Q. Chen Q.-X. Xiao R. Xie L.P. Zeng X.-G. Xhou H.-M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1545: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 28.Tsou C.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 381-436PubMed Google Scholar). The reversibility of the inhibition was further evaluated by adding EDTA to the assay after the first 10 min of incubation with Zn2+. In that case, the rate of forskolin-stimulated cAMP synthesis was substantially recovered. The addition of EDTA to control samples did not alter the rate of cAMP formation. Similar observations were made when AC activity in N18TG2 membranes was monitored (data not shown). The data indicate that the inhibition of AC by Zn2+ is reversible. To address whether the site of Zn2+ inhibition is located at the other metal site, the preferential binding site of Mn2+ (site B), we assessed the effects of Mn2+on the efficacy of Zn2+ inhibition of AC5. The data depicted in Fig. 8B shows that 0.1, 1, and 10 mmMn2+ had no effect on the IC50 for Zn2+. Note that Mn2+ is a potent activator of AC activity, and thus higher maximal activities accompany increasing Mn2+ concentrations. The data support the premise that the site of Zn2+ inhibition is distinct from the catalytic metal binding sites. Additional support for this premise was obtained in our studies of the C441R mutant of AC5 (11.Zimmermann G. Zhou D. Taussig R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19650-19655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This mutant AC5 displays a dramatic decrease in catalysis with only a slight change (2-fold) in the ability to bind substrate. The mutation is located at the residue adjacent to Asp-440, one of the critical aspartates that participate in coordinating metal binding (12.Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Johnson R.A. Gosselin G. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The close proximity of Cys-441 led the authors to suggest that a mutation in this residue results in a conformational change that disrupts the orientation of Asp-440 and thus the metal binding pocket (11.Zimmermann G. Zhou D. Taussig R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19650-19655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 9A, the C441R mutant behaves in a fashion identical to wild-type AC5 in response to ZnCl2 inhibition of forskolin-stimulated activity (IC50 of 1.8 μm). Thus, this mutation did not supplant the Zn2+ inhibition of AC5. To examine the effects of Zn2+ on other AC isoforms, we focused our attention on recombinant AC1 as representative of the AC1, AC3, and AC8 isoform family, and AC2 as representative of the AC2, AC4, and AC7 family (24.Iyengar R. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 768-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 25.Mons N. Cooper D.M.F.

AC1 and AC2 are of particular interest, because like AC5 they are expressed in regions of the brain with relatively high vesicular levels of Zn2+ (1.Cuajungco M.P. Lees G.J. Neurobiol.

As illustrated in Fig. 9B, recombinant AC1 was effectively inhibited over a narrow range of Zn2+ concentrations, displaying an IC50 of 1.4 μm, similar to that of AC5. The dose-response curve of AC2, however, was distinct from the other isoforms (Fig. 9C). AC2 was not inhibited by the low micromolar concentrations of ZnCl2 that were effective against AC1 and AC5. It appeared that such concentrations were actually somewhat stimulatory to the enzyme. Only at concentrations"
https://openalex.org/W1995735174,"Hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type 1 (HAI-1) is a Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor identified as a strong inhibitor of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) activator and matriptase. HAI-1 is first produced in a membrane-integrated form with two Kunitz domains in its extracellular region, and subsequent ectodomain shedding releases two major secreted forms, one with a single Kunitz domain and one with two Kunitz domains. To determine the roles of the Kunitz domains in the inhibitory activity of HAI-1 against serine proteases, we constructed various HAI-1 mutant proteins and examined their inhibitory activity against HGF activator and trypsin. The N-terminal Kunitz domain (Kunitz I) had potent inhibitory activity against both HGF activator and trypsin, whereas the C-terminal Kunitz domain (Kunitz II) had only very weak inhibitory activity against HGF activator, although its potency against trypsin was equivalent to that of Kunitz I. These results indicate that Kunitz I is the functional domain of HAI-1 for inhibiting the HGF-converting activity of HGF activator. Furthermore, the presence of two Kunitz domains affected the inhibitory activity of HAI-1 against HGF activator, and it showed a similar, but not additive, level of inhibitory activity against trypsin when compared with that of the individual Kunitz domains. These results suggest that serine protease binding sites of Kunitz I and Kunitz II are located close to each other and that proteolytic processing to generate HAI-1 with only one Kunitz domain regulates the activity of HAI-1.

HGF activator is a blood coagulation factor XII-like serine protease that catalyzes proteolytic conversion of the inactive single-chain precursor of HGF to the active two-chain form in response to tissue injury (2.Miyazawa K.

Furthermore, HAI-1 has been shown to be up-regulated along with repair of injured tissues (8.Kataoka H. Suganuma T. Shimomura T. Itoh H. Kitamura N. Nabeshima K. Koono M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 9.Itoh H. Kataoka H. Tomita M. Hamasuna R. Nawa Y. Kitamura N. Koono M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: G635-G643Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, HAI-1 may play a crucial role in tissue repair by regulating the activity of a growth factor-activating enzyme. HAI-1 was also identified from human breast milk in a complex with another serine protease, named matriptase (10.Lin C.-Y. Anders J. Johnson M. Dickson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18237-18242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Matriptase is an epithelial cell-derived serine protease that has extracellular matrix-degrading activity and has been proposed to play a role in breast cancer invasion (11.Shi Y.E. Torri J. Yieh L. Wellstein A. Lippmam M.E. Dickson R.B. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1409-1415PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Lin C.-Y. Wang J.K. Torri J. Dou L. Sang Q.A. Dickson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9147-9152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, HAI-1 may also function as a regulator of tumor progression by controlling the activity of an extracellular matrix-degrading enzyme. hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type 1 hepatocyte growth factor low density lipoprotein receptor 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid bovine serum albumin monoclonal antibody Chinese hamster ovary The primary translation product of HAI-1, which was predicted from the cDNA sequence, consists of characteristic structural domains, including two Kunitz domains, a low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)-like domain between the Kunitz domains, and a transmembrane domain (1.Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T. Kito M. Kondo J. Kagaya S. Qin L. Takata H. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6370-6376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting analysis revealed that HAI-1 is first produced in a 66-kDa membrane-integrated form, and subsequent ectodomain shedding releases two major secreted forms from the cell surface into the extracellular space, and the sizes of the two secreted forms are 40/39 and 58 kDa (13.Shimomura T. Denda K. Kawaguchi T. Matusmoto K. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The 40/39- and 58-kDa HAI-1 have the same N-terminal sequence; thus, they are produced from the membrane-integrated form by different C-terminal processing. The 40/39-kDa HAI-1 has one Kunitz domain and shows strong inhibitory activity against the HGF-converting activity of HGF activator. The 58-kDa HAI-1 has two Kunitz domains and shows markedly weak inhibitory activity against HGF activator (13.Shimomura T. Denda K. Kawaguchi T. Matusmoto K. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of the C-terminal region including the C-terminal Kunitz domain (Kunitz II) in the 58-kDa HAI-1 may interfere with the binding of HGF activator to the reactive site of the N-terminal Kunitz domain (Kunitz I), whereas elimination of this region by proteolytic processing could lead to strong binding of HGF activator to HAI-1. The cell surface HAI-1 integrated in epithelial cell membranes has a high affinity for HGF activator and forms a complex with the serine protease. Treatment of the cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or interleukin 1β markedly enhances release of the 58-kDa secreted form of HAI-1, but not the 40/39-kDa secreted form of HAI-1, from the cell surface (14.Kataoka H. Shimomura T. Kawaguchi T. Hamasuna R. Itoh H. Kitamura N. Miyazawa K. Koono M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40453-40462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This regulated shedding appears to be mediated by a zinc-metalloprotease. Because the 58-kDa HAI-1 has a low affinity for HGF activator, this enzyme is released from the complex with HAI-1, and as a result, significant HGF activator activity is recovered in the conditioned medium (14.Kataoka H.

These observations suggest that the cell surface HAI-1 acts not only as an inhibitor but also as a specific acceptor of active HGF activator and that regulated ectodomain shedding ensures the concentrated pericellular activity of HGF activator under certain cellular conditions, such as tissue injury and inflammation. Whereas regulated proteolytic processing of HAI-1 has been well characterized (13.Shimomura T. Denda K. Kawaguchi T. Matusmoto K. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 14.Kataoka H. Shimomura T. Kawaguchi T. Hamasuna R. Itoh H. Kitamura N. Miyazawa K. Koono M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40453-40462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the roles of the characteristic structural domains in the inhibitory activity against serine proteases remain to be elucidated. Therefore, in this study, we constructed various HAI-1 mutant proteins and examined their inhibitory activity against HGF activator and trypsin. We found that Kunitz I had potent inhibitory activity against both HGF activator and trypsin, whereas Kunitz II had very weak inhibitory activity against HGF activator, although its potency against trypsin was equivalent to that of Kunitz I. These results indicate that Kunitz I is the functional domain of HAI-1 for inhibition of HGF activator. We also found that the presence of two Kunitz domains affected the inhibitory activity of HAI-1 against HGF activator and showed a similar, but not additive, level of the inhibitory activity against trypsin when compared with that of the individual Kunitz domains. These results suggest that serine protease binding sites of Kunitz I and Kunitz II are located close to each other and that proteolytic processing to generate HAI-1 with only one Kunitz domain regulates the activity of HAI-1. Reagents were obtained as follows: CHAPS and bovine serum albumin (BSA) fraction V were obtained from Sigma, bovine pancreas trypsin was obtained from Roche Diagnostics GmbH, nonspecific mouse IgG was obtained from Organo Teknika Corp., Alexa 488-conjugated sheep IgG anti-mouse IgG was obtained from Molecular Probe, and enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents were obtained from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against HAI-1, C76-18 and 1N7, and mAb against HGF activator, A23, were prepared as described previously (3.Miyazawa K. Shimomura T. Kitamura N. J. Biol.

Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to express various mutant proteins of HAI-1. The cDNA encoding full-length HAI-1 was inserted into the NotI site of the pME18S vector (pME18S-HAI-1). To prepare an expression plasmid encoding a secreted form of HAI-1 (HAI-1-NK1LK2), a cDNA fragment (0.6 kb) was amplified by PCR using full-length HAI-1 cDNA as a template and two oligonucleotide primers, 5′-GCCGCGGCCAACGTCACAG-3′ and 5′-GCGCGGCCGCGACAAGA CT-3′. The PCR product was digested with BglII and NotI, generating a 0.5-kb fragment. The 0.7-kb BglII-NotI fragment of pME18S-HAI-1 was replaced with the 0.5-kb fragment (pME18S-HAI-1-NK1LK2). To prepare expression plasmids encoding HAI-1 deletion mutants, cDNAs encoding the deletion mutants were amplified by PCR using full-length HAI-1 cDNA as a template and a set of individual oligonucleotide primers. After the PCR products were digested with EcoRI and NotI, they were inserted into the EcoRI and NotI sites of the pME18S vector. These HAI-1 mutant constructs were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells by the DEAE-dextran method (16.Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.W. Sollner-Webb B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5707-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). To prepare expression plasmids encoding HAI-1 with point mutations in the P1 positions of the Kunitz domains (R260L, K385L, and R260L/K385L), the pME18S-HAI-1-NK1LK2 plasmid was mutated using a set of individual oligonucleotide primers and the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). These mutant constructs and pSV2 neo DNA were co-transfected into CHO cells by the LipofectAMINE method (17.Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2957) Google Scholar). After transfection, the cells were cultured in medium containing 0.4 mg/ml G418 and 10% fetal bovine serum. G418-resistant colonies were selected and screened for expression of the mutant HAI-1 proteins by an enzyme immunoassay. COS-7 cells transfected with the expression plasmids encoding HAI-1 deletion mutants were cultured in a 10-cm culture dish with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and further cultured in fresh serum-free medium. After 2 days, the conditioned medium was harvested and then clarified by centrifugation before being concentrated 20-fold by ultrafiltration using a YM30 membrane (Amicon) and analyzed by immunoblotting. CHO cell clones expressing HAI-1 mutant proteins were cultured in a 10-cm culture dish with enriched RPMI1640/DMEM/F-12 (eRDF) medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. At confluence, the cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and then further cultured in fresh serum-free medium. After 2–6 days, the conditioned medium for immunoblotting analysis was prepared as described above for COS-7 cells. To prepare cell extracts, the cells were washed with cold 0.9% NaCl and treated with 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid for 15 min on ice. The trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction was pelleted by centrifugation. The pellet was then dissolved in 150 μl of 7 m urea containing 2% Triton X-100 and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. After an additional centrifugation, the supernatant was recovered and analyzed for immunoblotting. The samples for immunoblotting were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond ECL; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and incubated with the anti-HAI-1 mAb for 2 h followed by an incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system. Concentrated conditioned medium containing each HAI-1 mutant was mixed with 1.5 ng of HGF activator or 1.1 ng of trypsin in 40 μl of phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% CHAPS and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After the incubation, 5 μl of 1.5 mg/ml single-chain HGF (for HGF activator) or 6 μl of 1.0 mg/ml BSA (for trypsin) in phosphate-buffered saline containing CHAPS was added to the respective mixture, and the samples were incubated for an additional 2 h. The reaction products were then separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the bands were scanned using a Flying-Spot Scanner CS-900 (Shimadzu). The inhibitory activity against HGF activator was estimated by calculating the ratio of the remaining single-chain HGF to two-chain HGF. The inhibitory activity against trypsin was estimated by calculating the remaining BSA. CHO cell clones expressing full-length HAI-1 and HAI-1-LK2M as well as MKN45 cells were cultured in 8-well glass chamber slides with eRDF medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. At semiconfluence, the cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% gelatin and 0.1% NaN3 (washing buffer) and incubated with 200 μl of 50 μg/ml anti-HAI-1 mAb (C76-18) or 500 μg/ml control mouse IgG for 60 min on ice. After the incubation, the cells were washed with washing buffer and incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. The cells were then washed with washing buffer and visualized by a confocal immunofluorescence microscope. For detection of bound HGF activator, the cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml HGF activator for 30 min on ice. The cells were then washed with washing buffer and incubated with 200 μl of 50 μg/ml anti-HGF activator mAb (A23) before being visualized as described above. The extracellular region of HAI-1 (Fig. 1) consists of a long N-terminal region (N), Kunitz I (K1), an LDLR-like domain (L), and Kunitz II (K2). To determine the role of each domain within the extracellular region of HAI-1 in the inhibitory activity against serine proteases, we constructed five deletion mutant cDNAs (Fig. 1). To obtain sufficient amounts of secreted proteins in conditioned medium, we deleted the transmembrane region in all constructs. HAI-1-NK1LK2 contained almost the entire extracellular region including Kunitz I and Kunitz II. HAI-1-NK1 contained Kunitz I but lacked the LDLR-like domain and Kunitz II, whereas HAI-1-NK1L lacked only Kunitz II. HAI-1-LK2 contained Kunitz II but lacked the N-terminal region and Kunitz I. HAI-1-N consisted of only the N-terminal region. The constructs were inserted into expression vector pME18S and transiently transfected into COS-7 cells. Proteins secreted into the conditioned medium were analyzed by immunoblotting. Two monoclonal antibodies, C76-18 and 1N7, were used for the immunoblotting. C76-18, which was directed against an epitope located in the N-terminal region, recognized HAI-1-NK1LK2, HAI-1-NK1, HAI-1-NK1L and HAI-1-N, whereas 1N7, which was directed against an epitope located in Kunitz II, recognized HAI-1-NK1LK2 and HAI-1-LK2. The immunoblotting analysis revealed that sufficient amounts of HAI-1 mutant proteins were secreted into the conditioned medium (Fig. 2). It has been shown that MKN45 human gastric carcinoma cells produce two major secreted forms of HAI-1, 40/39- and 58-kDa HAI-1 (13.Shimomura T. Denda K. Kawaguchi T. Matusmoto K. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, the 40/39-kDa form was barely detected in the conditioned medium of COS-7 cells transfected with full-length HAI-1 or HAI-1-NK1LK2 (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and4), indicating that its contribution to the inhibitory activity was negligible. Thus, the inhibitory activity present in the conditioned medium depended mostly on HAI-1 proteins with two Kunitz domains. The mutant proteins were quantified by scanning densitometry of the immunoblots using purified HAI-1 as a standard and assayed for their inhibitory activity against serine proteases.Figure 2Immunoblotting analysis of HAI-1 deletion mutant proteins. Proteins in the conditioned medium of COS-7 cells transfected with full-length HAI-1 and mutant constructs were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with anti-HAI-1 mAb C76-18 (A) or 1N7 (B) and developed with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We examined the inhibitory activity of the HAI-1 mutant proteins against two serine proteases, HGF activator and trypsin. To assess the inhibitory activity against HGF activator, the protease was mixed with each mutant protein and incubated for 30 min to allow formation of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. Next, single-chain HGF was added as a substrate, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 2 h. The samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To assess the inhibitory activity against trypsin, the enzyme was mixed with each mutant protein and incubated for 30 min. Next, BSA was added as a substrate, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 2 h before being analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 3 shows representative patterns of the SDS-PAGE analysis. Single-chain HGF was converted to two chains (a heavy chain and a light chain) by HGF activator in the absence of HAI-1 (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 4). This conversion was inhibited in the presence of the conditioned medium of MKN45 cells (Fig. 3A, lane 3), wild-type HAI-1 (Fig. 3A, lane 5), or mutant proteins that contained Kunitz I (Fig. 3A, lanes 6–8), but not in the presence of mutant proteins that contained only the N-terminal region (Fig. 3A, lane 9) or Kunitz II (Fig. 3A, lane 10). These results suggest that Kunitz I, and not Kunitz II, is the functional domain for inhibition of the HGF-converting activity of HGF activator. BSA was degraded by trypsin in the absence of HAI-1 (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and4). This degradation was inhibited in the presence of the conditioned medium of MKN45 cells (Fig. 3A, lane 3), wild-type HAI-1 (Fig. 3B, lane 5), or mutant proteins that contained Kunitz I and/or Kunitz II (Fig. 3B, lanes 6–8 and10), but not in the presence of a mutant protein that consisted of only the N-terminal region (Fig. 3B, lane 9). These results indicate that both Kunitz I and Kunitz II have inhibitory activity against trypsin. To quantitate the inhibitory activity of the Kunitz domains in HAI-1, the dose dependence of the inhibitory activity of mutant proteins was examined. Fig. 4A shows the dose-dependence curves for the inhibitory activity of deletion mutants against HGF activator. HAI-1-NK1 showed a dose-dependence curve similar to that of HAI-1-NK1L, and the concentration for 50% inhibition was about 2 nm. HAI-1-NK1LK2 showed a curve similar to that of purified 58-kDa HAI-1, and the concentration for 50% inhibition was about 6 nm. The concentration of HAI-1-LK2 for 50% inhibition was about 19 nm. These results indicate that HAI-1 with only Kunitz I shows the most potent inhibitory activity against HGF activator and that HAI-1 with two Kunitz domains is about 3-fold less potent, whereas HAI-1 with only Kunitz II is about 10-fold less potent. Fig. 4B shows the dose-dependence curves of the inhibitory activity against trypsin. All HAI-1 mutant proteins showed similar dose-dependence curves, and the concentration for 50% inhibition was about 1–2 nm. The membrane-integrated form of full-length HAI-1 showed strong binding to HGF activator, whereas the secreted form of HAI-1 containing almost the entire extracellular region (the 58-kDa HAI-1) showed rather weak binding (14.Kataoka H. Shimomura T. Kawaguchi T. Hamasuna R. Itoh H. Kitamura N. Miyazawa K. Koono M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40453-40462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the membrane-integrated form of HAI-1-LK2 may be capable of binding to HGF activator. To examine this possibility, cDNA encoding the HAI-1-LK2M protein that contained the transmembrane region and C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of HAI-1 (Fig. 5A) was constructed and stably transfected into CHO cells. The ability of the expressed proteins to bind HGF activator was tested by immunocytostaining. For positive controls, CHO cells expressing full-length HAI-1 and MKN45 cells expressing a high level of endogenous HAI-1 were also analyzed. Immunoblotting analysis of the cell extracts suggested that the membrane-integrated form of HAI-1-LK2M was expressed in the transfected CHO cells (Fig. 5B, lane 6). Immunocytostaining with a mAb against HAI-1 confirmed the presence of HAI-1-LK2M on the cell surface (Fig. 5C, g). However, no binding of HGF activator was observed on the surface of the cells expressing HAI-1-LK2M (Fig. 5C, k). On the other hand, obvious binding of HGF activator was observed on the cell surface of the positive control cells (Fig. 5C, j and l). These results indicate that Kunitz II of HAI-1 has a low affinity for HGF activator both in the secreted form and in the membrane-integrated form. The amino acid residues in the P1 positions of the reactive sites of various Kunitz domains were assigned as essential for their inhibitory activity (18.Laskowski Jr., M. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1948) Google Scholar, 19.Girard T.J. Warren L.A. Novotny W.F. Likert K.M. Brown S.G. Miletich J.P. Broze Jr., G.J. Nature. 1989; 338: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). To further characterize the roles of the Kunitz domains in the inhibitory activity of HAI-1-NK1LK2, we constructed cDNAs encoding HAI-1-NK1LK2 mutants in which an arginine residue (Arg260) of the P1 position in Kunitz I or a lysine residue (Lys385) of the P1 position in Kunitz II was individually changed to a leucine residue (R260L and K385L, respectively). In addition, cDNA encoding a HAI-1-NK1LK2 mutant in which both Arg260 and Lys385 were changed to leucine was also constructed (R260L/K385L). These cDNAs as well as cDNA encoding HAI-1-NK1LK2 were stably transfected into CHO cells because transient transfection of these mutant cDNAs into COS-7 cells did not produce sufficient amounts of mutant proteins. Cell lines that stably produced and secreted proteins of each mutant were obtained. Immunoblotting analysis showed that sufficient mutant proteins with molecular mass of 58 kDa were obtained in the conditioned medium (Fig. 6). These proteins were assayed for their inhibitory activity against HGF activator and trypsin. Fig. 7A shows the dose-dependence curves of the inhibitory activity against HGF activator. HAI-1-NK1LK2 with a mutation in Kunitz II (K385L) showed significantly weaker inhibitory activity than intact HAI-1-NK1LK2, and the concentration for 50% inhibition was 13 nm. A mutation in Kunitz I (R260L) led to a further reduction in the inhibitory activity, and the concentration for 50% inhibition was 42 nm. Almost no activity was observed in the protein with point mutations in both Kunitz domains (R260L/K385L). Fig. 7B shows the dose-dependence curves of the inhibitory activity against trypsin. A mutation in Kunitz I (R260L) or Kunitz II (K385L) did not significantly affect the inhibitory activity. Almost no activity was observed in the protein with point mutations in both Kunitz domains (R260L/K385L). In this study, we found that the N-terminal Kunitz domain (Kunitz I) of HAI-1 had strong inhibitory activity against HGF activator, whereas in contrast, the C-terminal Kunitz domain (Kunitz II) of HAI-1 had only weak inhibitory activity. From these findings, we concluded that Kunitz I is the functional domain of HAI-1 that is responsible for inhibition of the HGF-converting activity of HGF activator. Ectodomain shedding of the membrane-integrated HAI-1 produces the 40/39- and 58-kDa secreted forms of HAI-1. The 40/39-kDa HAI-1 with only Kunitz I shows much stronger inhibitory activity against HGF activator than the 58-kDa HAI-1 with Kunitz I and Kunitz II (13.Shimomura T. Denda K. Kawaguchi T. Matusmoto K. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Moreover, activated matriptase forms a tight complex with HAI-1, and the molecular mass of HAI-1 isolated from the complex was determined to be 40 kDa (20.Benaud C. Dickson R.B. Lin C.-Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1439-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), suggesting that HAI-1 with only Kunitz I has strong inhibitory activity against matriptase, although functional analysis of Kunitz II against matripatse has not yet been performed. Thus, proteolytic processing to generate HAI-1 with only Kunitz I (the 40/39-kDa HAI-1) appears to be a crucial step to produce a form of HAI-1 that has strong affinity for both HGF activator and matriptase. Although Kunitz II showed weak activity against HGF activator, it had strong inhibitory activity against trypsin, equivalent to that of Kunitz I. Thus, Kunitz II has the potential to function as a serine protease inhibitor but has only a weak association with HGF activator. The amino acid residues in the P1 positions of the reactive sites in various Kunitz domains are essential for their inhibitory activity (18.Laskowski Jr., M. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1948) Google Scholar,19.Girard T.J. Warren L.A. Novotny W.F. Likert K.M. Brown S.G. Miletich J.P. Broze Jr., G.J. Nature. 1989; 338: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The amino acid residue of the P1 position in Kunitz I is an arginine, and that in Kunitz II is a lysine. HGF activator cleaves the single-chain HGF precursor after the arginine residue of the P1 position (2.Miyazawa K. Shimomura T. Kitamura A. Kondo J. Morimoto Y. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10024-10028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Miyazawa K. Tsubouchi H. Naka D. Takahashi K. Okigaki M. Arakaki N. Nakayama H. Hirono S. Sakiyama O. Takahashi K. Gohda E. Daikuhara Y. Kitamura N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 967-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), suggesting that HGF activator has the ability to bind an arginine residue at the P1 position, and thus it has strong affinity for Kunitz I, but only weak affinity for Kunitz II. However, some Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors with an arginine residue at the P1 position did not inhibit the HGF-converting activity of HGF activator (22.Kawaguchi T. Qin L. Shimomura T. Kondo J. Matsumoto K. Denda K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27558-27564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Several amino acid residues around the P1 positions differ between Kunitz I of HAI-1 and the Kunitz domains of these inhibitors (1.Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T. Kito M. Kondo J. Kagaya S. Qin L. Takata H. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6370-6376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to the arginine residue of the P1 position, some of the different residues in Kunitz I may also contribute to the strong affinity for HGF activator. Because trypsin cleaves substrate proteins after the arginine and lysine residues of their P1 positions (18.Laskowski Jr., M. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1948) Google Scholar), it can associate with both Kunitz I and Kunitz II. Furthermore, the difference in amino acid residues around the P1 positions may not affect the binding of trypsin to Kunitz I and Kunitz II. An LDLR-like domain was assigned between Kunitz I and Kunitz II of HAI-1 (1.Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T. Kito M. Kondo J. Kagaya S. Qin L. Takata H. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6370-6376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this domain may be involved in formation of the inhibitor-enzyme complex because it contains many negatively charged amino acid residues (1.Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T. Kito M. Kondo J. Kagaya S. Qin L. Takata H. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6370-6376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In the present study, however, we showed that the absence of this domain did not affect the inhibitory activity of Kunitz I against both HGF activator and trypsin under our assay conditions. Thus, the LDLR-like domain may not be involved in association of the inhibitor with proteases. It is possible that this domain regulates the proteolytic processing of HAI-1, as was proposed previously (13.Shimomura T. Denda K. Kawaguchi T. Matusmoto K. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although the individual Kunitz domains of HAI-1 had similar inhibitory activity against trypsin, the HAI-1 protein with two Kunitz domains also showed a similar, but not additive, level of inhibitory activity compared with that of the individual Kunitz domains. Moreover, a mutation in the P1 position of Kunitz I or Kunitz II of HAI-1-NK1LK2 did not significantly affect the inhibitory activity against trypsin. These results suggest that the serine protease binding sites of Kunitz I and Kunitz II are located close to each other, and thus only one molecule of trypsin can associate with HAI-1 even if it has two Kunitz domains. The HAI-1 protein with two Kunitz domains showed much weaker inhibitory activity against HGF activator than the HAI-1 protein with only Kunitz I. Thus, the closely located Kunitz II appears to interfere with the binding of Kunitz I to HGF activator. A substitution of the lysine residue at the P1 position of Kunitz II with a leucine residue reduced the inhibitory activity of HAI-1-NK1LK2 against HGF activator but not against trypsin, suggesting that a small structural change around the P1 position affects the association of Kunitz I with HGF activator but not with trypsin. The molecular mass of HGF activator is 34 kDa (1.Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T. Kito M. Kondo J. Kagaya S. Qin L. Takata H. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6370-6376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), whereas that of trypsin is only 23 kDa. This difference in molecular mass may explain why trypsin has easier access than HGF activator to the HAI-1 protein with two Kunitz domains. The high-resolution crystallographic studies of bikunin, a serine protease inhibitor with two Kunitz domains, revealed an interrelation of positions of the domains (23.Xu Y. Carr P.D. Guss J.M. Ollis D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The two Kunitz domains of bikunin are packed close together, but the protease binding site of the first domain is unobstructed by the second. In contrast, the protease binding site of the second domain is close to the first, and thus protease binding is affected by the presence of the first domain (23.Xu Y. Carr P.D. Guss J.M. Ollis D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 24.Morishita H. Yamakawa T. Matsusue T. Kusuyama T. Sameshima-Aruga R. Hirose J. Nii A. Miura T. Isaji M. Horisawa-Nakano R. Nagase Y. Kanamori T. Nobuhara M. Tanaka R. Koyama S. Naotsuka M. Thromb. Res. 1994; 73: 193-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the case of HAI-1, the protease binding of each Kunitz domain was affected by the presence of other domain, suggesting that the three-dimensional structure of HAI-1 with two Kunitz domains is different from that of bikunin. The presence of the LDLR-like domain between the two Kunitz domains of HAI-1 may contribute to a three-dimensional structure different from that of bikunin because no amino acid residue is present in the linking region between the two Kunitz domains of bikunin (23.Xu Y. Carr P.D. Guss J.M. Ollis D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the membrane-integrated form of full-length HAI-1 has a high affinity for HGF activator, whereas the secreted 58-kDa form of HAI-1 has a weak affinity for HGF activator (14.Kataoka H. Shimomura T. Kawaguchi T. Hamasuna R. Itoh H. Kitamura N. Miyazawa K. Koono M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40453-40462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that Kunitz II in the membrane-integrated HAI-1 does not interfere with the binding of Kunitz I to HGF activator and that proteolytic processing to generate the secreted form of HAI-1 brings Kunitz I and Kunitz II closer together and thus causes Kunitz II to interfere with the binding of Kunitz I to HGF activator. Because the proteolytic processing to generate the 40/39-kDa HAI-1 occurs between Kunitz I and Kunitz II (13.Shimomura T. Denda K. Kawaguchi T. Matusmoto K. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), there is a possibility that the processing may also generate a HAI-1 protein with only Kunitz II in a secreted and/or membrane-integrated form, although no such a molecule of HAI-1 has yet been identified. A serine protease inhibitor named trypstatin, which consists of only the second Kunitz domain of bikunin, was identified from mast cell (25.Kido H. Yokogoshi Y. Katunuma N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18104-18107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Itoh H. Ide H. Ishikawa N. Nawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3818-3822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It inhibits factor Xa, tryptase, trypsin, and chymase. Thus, the proteolytic processing of bikunin to eliminate the first Kunitz domain leads to an activation of the second Kunitz domain. Kunitz II of HAI-1 has strong inhibitory activity against trypsin, even in the presence of Kunitz I. However, similar to the second Kunitz domain of bikunin, it may also have inhibitory activity against other serine proteases when Kunitz I is eliminated by proteolytic processing. Thus, identification of a HAI-1 protein with only Kunitz II and its cognate serine proteases will reveal the novel biological functions of Kunitz II."

(1995) Biochemistry 34, 3544–3552), the zinc dithiolate active site of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) has been studied as a target for cellular oxidants. In the nitrogen monoxide (⋅NO)/superoxide (O2⨪) system, an equimolar generation of both radicals under peroxynitrite (PN) formation led to rapid inactivation of ADH activity, whereas hydrogen peroxide and ⋅NO alone reacted too slowly to be of physiological significance. 3-Morpholino sydnonimine inactivated the enzyme with an IC50 value of 250 nm; the corresponding values for PN, hydrogen peroxide, and ⋅NO were 500 nm, 50 μm, and 200 μm. When superoxide was generated at low fluxes by xanthine oxidase, it was quite effective in ADH inactivation (IC50 (XO) ≈ 1 milliunit/ml). All inactivations were accompanied by zinc release and disulfide formation, although no strict correlation was observed. From the two zinc thiolate centers, only the zinc Cys2His center released the metal by oxidants. The zinc Cys4 center was also oxidized, but no second zinc atom could be found with 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol (PAR) as a chelating agent except under denaturing conditions. Surprisingly, the oxidative actions of PN were abolished by a 2–3-fold excess of ⋅NO under generation of a nitrosating species, probably dinitrogen trioxide. We conclude that in cellular systems, low fluxes of ⋅NO and O2⨪ generate peroxynitrite at levels effective for zinc thiolate oxidations, facilitated by the nucleophilic nature of the complexed thiolate group. With an excess of ⋅NO, the PN actions are blocked, which may explain the antioxidant properties of⋅NO and the mechanism of cellular S-nitrosations.

There is increasing evidence that redox reactions at proteins can modify enzyme activities and thus represent a new pathway in the cellular signaling network (reviewed in Refs. 1.Sies H. Dafre A.L.

We have recently obtained evidence that PN can control vascular tone already at submicromolar concentrations by nitration of a tyrosine residue in prostacyclin synthase under physiological conditions (8.Zou M.H. Ullrich V. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Simultaneous low-level generation of nitrogen monoxide (⋅NO) and superoxide radicals (O2⨪) in endothelial cells proved to be sufficient for this oxidative modification (9.Zou M. Jendral M. Ullrich V. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 1283-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 10.Zou M.H. Leist M. Ullrich V. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1359-1365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), although it has been argued that physiological levels of both radicals are not sufficient for tyrosine nitration (11.Pfeiffer S.

Meanwhile, literature data show that PN generated from superoxide and nitrogen monoxide can nitrate tyrosine (13.Reiter C.D. Teng R.J. Beckman J.S. J. Biol.

Moreover, this discrepancy found an explanation in a series of studies proving that the sensitivity and selectivity of heme proteins for tyrosine nitrations reside in an autocatalytic role of the metal ion (16.Daiber A. Schoneich C. Schmidt P. Jung C. Ullrich V. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 81: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 17.Daiber A. Herold S. Schoneich C. Namgaladze D. Peterson J.A. Ullrich V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6729-6739PubMed Google Scholar). By forming transition metal intermediates from cellular levels of PN, neighboring tyrosines can be selectively attacked without affecting other tyrosines randomly.Following this concept of PN action under physiological conditions, we now extend oxidations by PN also to cysteines. Free and also protein-bound thiols are preferred targets of PN, especially when they are present in their thiolate forms (18.Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol.

This can be interpreted as a catalytic action of Zn2+ by converting thiol groups after deprotonation to the more reactive thiolate form. Such zinc thiolate centers may be the subject of a redox regulation by being reversibly oxidized and reduced as part of a signaling mechanism in oxidative stress (26.Jacob C. Maret W. Vallee B.L.

Therefore, ADH provides a model in which the oxidation of the active site Zn2+ dithiolate center can be studied in the ⋅NO/O2⨪ system by monitoring the enzyme activity. In the present work, we confirm the validity of this model and report on chemically surprising and biologically relevant changes in the oxidizing, nitrating, and nitrosating potential of the system when varying the relative flux rates of ⋅NO and O2⨪.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsPN was synthesized from ⋅NO and O2⨪ according to the method of Kissner et al. (29.Kissner R. Nauser T. Bugnon P. Lye P.G. Koppenol W.H. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1285-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). SIN-1 and spermine NONOate were purchased from Calbiochem, and diethylamine NONOate was purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). Stock solutions of PN (185 mm in 0.1 mNaOH), SIN-1 (100 mm in 0.1 m HCl), and diethylamine NONOate and spermine NONOate (100 mm in 0.1m NaOH) were kept at −70 °C for months without serious losses. XO (grade III) from buttermilk and Cu,Zn-SOD from bovine erythrocytes were from Sigma. ADH from yeast, NAD+ (grade II), and catalase from beef liver (a stabilized suspension) were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other reagents were of analytical grade.ADH Activity TestThe activity of ADH was measured on an Aminco DW-2a UV/Vis spectrophotometer in the dual wavelength mode. A solution of ADH (33 nm) in 0.1 mpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, was placed in a cuvette equipped with a magnetic stirrer, and then NAD+ (300 μm) was added, and the temperature of the solution was adjusted to 37 °C. The reduction of NAD+ to NADH was started by addition of ethanol (172 mm) from a syringe through a septum to the stirred solution. The formation of NADH was followed at 340 versus 400 nm, and the specific activity of ADH was calculated for the first 30 s of the measurements in the linear region of the curves by using an extinction coefficient for NADH of ε340 = 6220 m−1cm−1 (23.Crow J.P. Beckman J.S. McCord J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The specific activity of freshly prepared ADH was 65 ± 3 μmol min−1 mg−1(units/mg). For all experiments, the same stock solutions of ADH (3.3 μm in water) and NAD+ (3 mm in buffer) were used, aliquots of which were frozen at −70 °C.Incubation of ADH with Peroxynitrite, Hydrogen Peroxide, or Potassium SuperoxideTo test the effects of oxidants on the activity of ADH, the enzyme (33 nm) without NAD+ was preincubated with these oxidants at pH 7.4 and 37 °C. PN (0.1–10 μm) was added by a Vortex mixer to a solution of ADH and incubated for 5 min at pH 7.4 and 37 °C, and then all samples were kept on ice until they were measured. H2O2 (25–1000 μm) was incubated with ADH for 1 or 2 h at pH 7.4 and 37 °C, and aliquots were taken after defined time intervals. The effects of catalase (5–500 units/ml) and Cu,Zn-SOD (100 and 500 units/ml) on this inactivation by H2O2 (0.5 or 1 mm) were measured in the presence of these proteins during incubation. Potassium superoxide (KO2) (2.5–100 μm from a freshly prepared stock solution in Me2SO) was incubated for 1 min before the activity test. The final amount of Me2SO was kept below 2% to prevent activity loss by this compound.Incubation of ADH with SIN-1, Xanthine Oxidase, Spermine NONOate, or Diethylamine NONOateSIN-1 (0.1–5 μm), which under aerobic conditions generates PN from⋅NO and O2⨪ with a half-life of about 1 h at pH 7.4 and 37 °C (11.Pfeiffer S. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27280-27285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 30.Darley-Usmar V.M. Hogg N. O'Leary V.J. Wilson M.T. Moncada S. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1992; 17: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), was incubated for 2 h with ADH. The effects of catalase (100 and 500 units/ml), Cu,Zn-SOD (1–500 unit(s)/ml), and ⋅NO (1–25 μm) on the inactivation of ADH by SIN-1 (5 μm) were tested by addition before incubation. Spermine NONOate (5–1000 μm) and diethylamine NONOate (50–1000 μm), which both thermally decompose and yield⋅NO (with half-lives of 40 min and 2 min, respectively, at pH 7.4 and 37 °C (31.Keefer L.K. Nims R.W. Davies K.M. Wink D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 281-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), were incubated for 2.5 and 1 h, respectively, with ADH. These incubations were done in the presence and absence of oxygen. XO (0.625–20 milliunit(s)/ml) as an enzymatic source for O2⨪ (32.Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4053-4057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Radi R. Tan S. Prodanov E. Evans R.A. Parks D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1122: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) was incubated with ADH for 0.5 and 1 h at pH 7.4 and 37 °C in a buffer that contained 1 mm hypoxanthine. Because the formation of O2⨪ in this system consumes oxygen, all incubations were performed in open reaction vials. The time dependence of the XO-mediated inactivation of ADH was measured by taking aliquots after defined time periods. The effects of catalase, Cu,Zn-SOD (5–500 units/ml), and both together on the XO (20 milliunits/ml for 1 h)-mediated inactivation of ADH were measured by adding these proteins before incubation. The inactivation potential of XO (0.5 milliunit/ml for 1 h) was also tested in the presence of spermine NONOate (0.25–500 μm) in open reaction vials. Catalase (100 and 250 units/ml), Cu,Zn-SOD (1–250 units/ml), or both were added as controls with XO (0.5 milliunit/ml)/spermine NONOate (5 μm). O2⨪ and ⋅NO formation rates were determined by the cytochrome c/oxy-Hb assay as described previously (34.Kelm M. Dahmann R. Wink D. Feelisch M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9922-9932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). For any series of measurements, an internal control was carried out, and ADH was incubated under similar conditions as indicated for each experiment, but the oxidants were omitted. All values refer to this internal control as “percentage of control.” Before the activity measurement, 10% of a NAD+ (3.3 mm) solution was added to the samples containing ADH at a concentration of 33 nm, yielding final concentrations of 300 μm NAD+ and 30 nm ADH in the activity assay.Determination of Zinc ReleaseThe zinc release from ADH (10 μm) after incubation with different oxidants was measured by using the zinc chelator 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol (PAR) with an extinction coefficient of ε500 = 90,000m−1 cm−1 at pH 7.4 that was determined from a calibration curve. This value was between those determined at pH 7 (65,000 m−1cm−1) (35.Shaw C.F. Laib J.E. Savas M. Petering D.H. Inorg. Chem. 1990; 29: 403-411Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and pH 7.8 (96,000 m−1cm−1) (23.Crow J.P. Beckman J.S. McCord J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). PAR was present at a concentration of 100 μm and was added immediately before the measurement because PAR may slowly extract zinc from ADH (23.Crow J.P. Beckman J.S. McCord J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The protein was preincubated with SIN-1, H2O2, XO/hypoxanthine, and/or spermine NONOate for 60–150 min in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 and 37 °C. For the time-dependent zinc release, aliquots were taken every 10–20 min. The protective effect of catalase and Cu,Zn-SOD was also assayed in the above-described oxidant systems. A maximal release of 1.96 zinc atoms/ADH monomer was found after acidic hydrolysis (6n HCl at 100 °C for 12 h), in good agreement with the theoretical value of 2 zinc atoms/subunit. The pH was adjusted to 7.4 before measurements of zinc release by PAR. A value of 1.9 ± 0.05 mol of zinc was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (Spurenanalytisches Labor; Dr. Baumann, Maxhütte, Germany).Determination of Thiol OxidationThe thiol content of ADH (10 μm) was measured after oxidation by different oxidants by using the disulfide compound 2,2′-dithio-bipyridine (DTBP) at a concentration of 200 μm. Free SH groups were determined spectrophotometrically at 343 versus 400 nm by monitoring the release of 2-thiopyridinone (ε343 = 7600m−1 cm−1) (36.Jocelyn P.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 246-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). DTBP was used because its self-hydrolysis is slower compared with Ellman's reagent. However, because DTBP reacts only slowly with the thiol groups of ADH, the protein was denatured anaerobically for 5 min at 90 °C in the presence of 10% acetonitrile before the addition of DTBP and the spectroscopic determination. This denaturation procedure allowed a complete reaction of SH groups within 100 s. In untreated control samples, 5.7 ± 0.5 free thiol groups/ADH subunit could be found, although the theoretical value corresponds to 7 cysteines/monomer (6 are ligands for the 2 zinc atoms as published in the Swiss Protein Database, accession number P00330) (23.Crow J.P. Beckman J.S. McCord J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Aliquots were taken and measured after time intervals of 10 min or after the total incubation time in the presence of different oxidant concentrations. All values are given as a percentage of the control (5.7 thiols/subunit). In the case of high PN concentrations (up to 10 mm), the expected pH shift of 0.1–0.3 was adjusted by prior addition of 0.1m HCl to the enzyme solution, yielding a pH of 7.1–7.3 before the PN addition. The reactivity of PAR and DTNB in samples with high initial hydrogen peroxide concentrations was checked by the addition of ZnSO4 or cysteine, respectively.Detection of Disulfide Bonds in ADH by Raman SpectroscopyADH (1 mm) in 0.2 mpotassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with SIN-1 (1 mm) or H2O2(50 mm) or was quickly mixed with PN (10 mm). The solubilized protein was partially precipitated after this treatment. The samples were then buffer-exchanged into 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, on Sephadex G-25 fast desalting column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and concentrated to 50 μl in Microcon-10 centrifuge tubes (Amicon). 10-μl aliquots were spotted onto glass coverslips, dried under vacuum, and stored in argon atmosphere. Raman spectra were taken on a Jobin Yvon LabRAM spectrometer (courtesy of Jobin Yvon; GmbH, Bensheim, Germany) with 633 nm excitation from a helium-neon laser.Quantitation of 4-Nitrosophenol by UV/Vis Spectroscopy and HPLCThe formation of 4-nitrosophenolate (p K ≈ 6) in reactions of phenol (5 mm) with SIN-1 (200 μm) and/or spermine NONOate (100 μm) was monitored spectrophotometrically at 400 versus 500 nm over a time period of 2 h in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 and 37 °C (37.Pilichowski J.F. Boule P. Billard J.P. Can. J. Chem. 1995; 73: 2143-2147Crossref Google Scholar). Its yield in these samples was determined by HPLC as described previously (38.Daiber A. Mehl M. Ullrich V. Nitric Oxide. 1998; 2: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).RESULTSInhibition of ADH Activity by Nitrogen Monoxide, Bolus Additions, and in Situ Generation of PeroxynitriteIn ADH, the ZnCys2His cluster is essential for enzyme activity (39.Pietruszko R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1975; 56: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), allowing correlation of the loss of activity with the oxidation by PN (Fig. 1). By bolus additions of PN, ADH became inactivated with IC50 values of 0.5 μmPN and thus with similar sensitivity as reported previously (23.Crow J.P. Beckman J.S. McCord J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) because such values are dependent on the target concentrations. This inactivation was complete at about 4 μm within 1 min, in agreement with the short half-life of PN of about 1 s at pH 7 (40.Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Because under cellular conditions PN originates from the fast combination of ⋅NO and O2⨪ (29.Kissner R. Nauser T. Bugnon P. Lye P.G. Koppenol W.H. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1285-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 41.Squadrito G.L. Pryor W.A. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1995; 96: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), we used SIN-1 as a suitable agent for the simultaneous generation of both radicals in equimolar concentrations (11.Pfeiffer S. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27280-27285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 30.Darley-Usmar V.M. Hogg N. O'Leary V.J. Wilson M.T. Moncada S. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1992; 17: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). According to the clear-cut results in Fig. 2, the inhibition occurred with an IC50 value of about 0.25 μm and hence perfectly matched the data from bolus additions of PN. The presence of Cu,Zn-SOD abolished the inhibition (Fig. 2, inset), and ⋅NO alone generated by spermine NONOate required about 200 μm for half-inhibition (Fig. 3). This weak oxidizing power of⋅NO was not significantly influenced by the presence of dioxygen. At concentrations of 1–5 μm spermine NONOate,⋅NO even caused a slight increase in ADH activity, but only in deoxygenated solutions. From this one can conclude that ⋅NO is not an effective oxidant for the zinc dithiolate center of ADH and that the simultaneous generation of ⋅NO and O2⨪ from SIN-1 is required for an efficient inactivation of the protein.Figure 2Concentration-dependent inhibition of ADH activity by nitrogen monoxide/superoxide generated from SIN-1 : protective effects of Cu,Zn-SOD. The inactivation of ADH (33 nm) by PN generation from SIN-1 (0.1–5 μm) was investigated at pH 7.4 and 37 °C (the incubation times were 2 h).

Bolus additions of KO2 and incubation times of only 1 min (to avoid the slow inactivation by H2O2) resulted in no inhibition (data not shown). However, because the release of O2⨪ by SIN-1 occurs by a slow aerobic decay reaction over more than 1 h, the continuous generation of O2⨪ by the XO/hypoxanthine system provided a better control (Fig. 4). Such conditions caused inactivation in a time-dependent (Fig. 4, inset) and XO concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 4). The presence of Cu,Zn-SOD and catalase was used to differentiate between O2⨪- and H2O2-dependent oxidations (Fig. 5). The varying results obtained from bolus additions of KO2 and from O2⨪ generation by XO may be explained by the high velocity of disproportionation with bolus additions of O2⨪ (42.Lee J. Hunt J.A. Groves J.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6053-6061Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar).Figure 4Concentration- and time-dependent inhibition of ADH activity by superoxide generated by XO/hypoxanthine. The inactivation of ADH (33 nm) by superoxide/hydrogen peroxide generation by the XO (0.625–20 milliunit(s)/ml)/hypoxanthine (1 mm) system was measured at pH 7.4 and 37 °C.

The addition of both together resulted in almost 100% restoration of activity. This allows the conclusion that O2⨪, at least under constant generation, is an inactivating agent by itself. H2O2 as an oxidant requires quite high concentrations or long incubation times to exert its effects, and its concentration for half-maximal inhibition after 2 h was around 25–50 μm (Fig. 6). As expected, catalase already blocked the inactivation at low levels (Fig. 6, inset), whereas Cu,Zn-SOD did not (data not shown).Figure 6Concentration-dependent inhibition of ADH activity by hydrogen peroxide: protective effects of catalase. The inactivation of ADH (33 nm) by H2O2 (25–1000 μm) was measured at pH 7.4 and 37 °C. The incubation times were either 1 h (○) or 2 h (▵).

At a fixed rate of O2⨪ generation (which by itself caused 15% inactivation), upon the addition of spermine NONOate the activity of ADH first decreased steadily and reached a minimum at 4–6 μm spermine NONOate. According to calculations from our own measurements, this occurred at an about equal rate of O2⨪ and ⋅NO production. The initial formation rates in the XO system (0.5 milliunit/ml and 1 mm hypoxanthine) and from spermine NONOate (5 μm) were 3 ± 0.2 nm/s for O2⨪ and 2.4 ± 0.1 nm/s for ⋅NO at pH 7.4 and 37 °C. Cu,Zn-SOD at concentrations above 100 units/ml could block the inhibition almost completely at this minimum (Fig. 7B). At concentrations of spermine NONOate above those necessary for equalizing O2⨪ production, the inhibition of ADH was effectively released at about 15–20 μmNONOate, whereas at higher concentrations, the inhibition started again, in agreement with the low oxidative action of ⋅NO"

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E231-E236Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) serve to stabilize the focal adhesion complex, couple cell surface receptors to the actomyosin contractile apparatus (9.Critchley D.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), and act as a scaffold to which other proteins can bind. Paxillin, in particular, is a multifaceted scaffolding protein containing two main structural domains: an SH2- and SH3-containing N terminus and a C-terminal region composed of four sequential LIM (lin-11, isl-1, mec-3) domains (14.Turner C.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4139-4140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Between these two domains paxillin is capable of binding both structural (α-tubulin and actopaxin) as well as signaling (focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Csk, and c-Abl) molecules, allowing it to play an intimate role in the dynamics of the focal adhesion (12.Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1435-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 13.Turner C.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E231-E236Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 14.Turner C.E.

Signaling molecules act as conduits between the extracellular environment and the cell, influencing focal adhesion turnover, nuclear transcription, cell morphology, and cell survival (4.Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3757) Google Scholar, 8.Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar). Tyrosine kinases (FAK, Src, Csk, Fyn, c-Abl, and Pyk2) are activated upon integrin engagement and subsequently trigger such cellular events as mitosis, cytoskeletal rearrangement (4.Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3757) Google Scholar, 16.Avraham H. Park S.Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S.

Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3757) Google Scholar). In addition, enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation is associated with increased focal adhesion and stress fiber formation (10.Schoenwaelder S.M. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). The serine/threonine kinase protein kinase C (PKC) is also associated with focal adhesions. Cells adherent to the CBD of fibronectin and treated with phorbol esters to directly stimulate PKC generate focal adhesions and actin stress fibers (18.Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 277-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that this kinase is involved in the focal adhesion assembly process. PKC activation directs the localization of syndecan-4 to focal adhesion sites (2.Baciu P.C. Goetinck P.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1503-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and in turn, PKC activation is potentiated following oligomerization of syndecan-4 core proteins (19.Oh E.S. Woods A.

Murakami M. Gao Y. Simons M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15871-15877Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PKC stimulation also enhances the shedding of syndecan-4 from the plasma membrane, thereby modifying its function from a cell surface receptor to an ECM-associated molecule (3.Bernfield M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14713-14720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Syndecan-4 is a member of a family of transmembrane HSPG (syndecans 1–4) that are characterized by divergent extracellular domains and cytoplasmic domains that contain two constant regions separated by a variable region that is unique to each family member (3.Bernfield M. Gotte M. Park P.W. Reizes O. Fitzgerald M.L. Lincecum J. Zako M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 69: 729-777Crossref Scopus (2281) Google Scholar, 24.Zimmermann P. David G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: S91-S100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, several proteins have been identified that bind to the cytoplasmic domain of the syndecan family members. These proteins (syntenin, synectin, synbindin, and CASK) contain PDZ domains that ligate the invariant C-terminal 4 amino acids (EFYA) present in all 4 syndecan molecules (25.Cohen A.R. Woods D.F.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Other molecules ligate the unique variable region and, therefore, bind selectively to one family member. PIP2binds the variable region of syndecan-4 (22.Horowitz A. Murakami M. Gao Y. Simons M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15871-15877Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), as does the cytoplasmic protein syndesmos (30.Baciu P.C. Saoncella S. Lee S.H. Denhez F. Leuthardt D. Goetinck P.F. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 315-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Syndesmos was isolated from a yeast two-hybrid screen in which the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4 was used as bait and was found to co-localize with syndecan-4 in the focal contacts of ventral plasma membranes of fibronectin adherent cells. Syndesmos can be myristylated suggesting that it may interact directly with the plasma membrane in addition to its association with syndecan-4. When overexpressed in NIH3T3 cells, syndesmos accelerates cell spreading and the assembly of actin stress fibers (30.Baciu P.C. Saoncella S. Lee S.H. Denhez F. Leuthardt D. Goetinck P.F. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 315-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the impact syndesmos has on cell morphology, we deduced that it might interact with other focal adhesion-associated proteins and sought to identify other potential cytoplasmic interactors. Here we report that syndesmos binds the adaptor protein paxillin. The connection of syndecan-4 with paxillin and possible downstream signaling events through syndesmos parallels the connection between paxillin and integrins and may thus reflect the cooperativity between these two receptors in the assembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers. Primary chick embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) were obtained and cultured as previously described (2.Baciu P.C. Goetinck P.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1503-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). All experiments were done on cultures that were 85% confluent. Syndesmos was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-syndesmos polyclonal antibodies (30.Baciu P.C. Saoncella S. Lee S.H. Denhez F. Leuthardt D. Goetinck P.F. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 315-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were washed four times in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline/Triton X-100 (0.1%), protease inhibitors (Complete, protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate), solubilized in SDS-PAGE buffer, electrophoresed, transferred to an immobilon-P membrane, and probed for tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (PY 99, sc-720, Santa-Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or paxillin (P13520-Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). The membranes were then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (170-6516, Bio-Rad), and visualization of immunoreactive bands was performed with enhanced chemiluminescence following the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce, Rockford, IL). GST-paxillin, GST-Hic-5, GST-syndesmos, or GST alone were expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21) and purified on glutathione-agarose beads according to the manufacturer's directions (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The construction of GST-syndesmos has been previously described (30.Baciu P.C. Saoncella S. Lee S.H. Denhez F. Leuthardt D. Goetinck P.F. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 315-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GST-paxillin and GST-Hic-5 constructs were a gift from Dr. Sheila Thomas (Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Cell lysates from CEFs were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the glutathione-agarose bead-bound GST constructs or GST alone. The beads were then washed six times in the lysis buffer, solubilized in SDS-PAGE buffer, electrophoresed, transferred to an immobilon-P membrane, and analyzed for bound syndesmos using the anti-syndesmos polyclonal antibody (30.Baciu P.C. Saoncella S. Lee S.H. Denhez F. Leuthardt D. Goetinck P.F. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 315-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as described above for the immunoprecipitations. In vitro transcription-translation was carried out using the TNT in vitro transcription-translation kit from Promega (Madison, WI). Reactions were carried out as recommended by the manufacturer. The template used for these experiments was syndesmos cDNA that was cloned in pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In vivo cell labeling grade l-[35S]methionine (SJ 1015; >1000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. CEFs were treated for 30 min with the membrane-permeable homobifunctional cross-linking reagent DTSP (3,3′-dithiobispropionic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, C14H16O4S2, Sigma), which contains a cleavable disulfide linkage. Cells were then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and blocked with 0.2 m glycine in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. After two washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer, and the lysates were incubated with either anti-syndesmos serum or preimmune serum coupled to protein-G beads. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with radioimmune precipitation buffer, resuspended in electrophoresis buffer containing 20% β-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 min to cleave the disulfide bond, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and Western blotted using anti-paxillin antibodies. After starvation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal bovine serum, CEFs were treated for the indicated times with TPA (Sigma) at a concentration of 100 ng/ml. Cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were obtained as described above. To identify possible syndesmos interactors, CEFs were treated with orthovanadate (100 μm) for 2 h in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum and lysed. Proteins immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate with antibodies against syndesmos were electrophoresed and analyzed by Western blot using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. A major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein that migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 70 kDa was observed (Fig. 1A). Based on its molecular mass we hypothesized that this protein could be paxillin, one of the major tyrosine-phosphorylated focal adhesion-associated proteins. This hypothesis was confirmed when proteins from cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with syndemos antibodies and blotted with an antibody against paxillin. Two immunoreactive bands (70 and 42 kDa) could be detected with this antibody (Fig. 1B) as previously reported (31.Salgia R. Li J.L. Lo S.H. Brunkhorst B. Kansas G.S. Sobhany E.S. Sun Y. Pisick E. Hallek M. Ernst T. Tantrauahi R. Chen L.B. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5039-5047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Although the paxillin antibody used also recognizes the paxillin homolog Hic-5 (12.Nikolopoulos S.N. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1435-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), the lower band is likely not Hic-5, but a proteolytic fragment of paxillin, since we also observe this band in in vitro transcription-translation assays using a paxillin template (data not shown). Interactions of syndesmos with paxillin could also be demonstrated in GST pull-down experiments. GST-syndesmos, but not GST alone, is able to pull-down two paxillin immunoreactive bands from CEF lysates (Fig. 2A) and GST-paxillin, but not GST alone, could pull-down syndesmos from CEF lysates (Fig. 2B). In addition, GST-Hic-5 could also pull-down syndesmos from CEF lysates (Fig. 2B) suggesting that the syndesmos binding site is present in both paxillin and its homolog Hic-5. To test if syndesmos-paxillin complexes exist intracellularly, CEFs were treated with the membrane permeable cross-linker DTSP, and immunoprecipitates were obtained from cell lysates with either anti-syndesmos serum or preimmune serum. The analysis of these immunoprecipitates by SDS-PAGE and Western blot with antibodies against paxillin clearly indicates that paxillin was cross-linked to syndesmos (Fig. 3A). It is thus likely that a direct intracellular interaction exists between the two proteins. To further confirm that the interactions between syndesmos and paxillin or Hic-5 observed in the immunoprecipitations and GST pull-downs in the above experiments are direct, we performed GST pull-down experiments with radiolabeled in vitro synthesized syndesmos to eliminate the potential involvement of other associated proteins. GST-paxillin and GST-Hic-5, but not GST alone, bound in vitro synthesized syndesmos (Fig. 3B). Together, these data indicate a direct interaction between paxillin (or Hic-5) and syndesmos. PKC activation, like syndesmos, is associated with focal adhesion and actin stress fiber formation and also with increased tyrosine phosphorylation in cells. To determine whether PKC activation is involved in promoting the interaction of syndesmos and paxillin, serum-starved CEFs were incubated with TPA, which directly activates PKC, for various periods of time. Paxillin was co-immunoprecipitated with syndesmos upon 1 min of TPA treatment (Fig. 4). Additional treatment with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate extends the syndesmos-paxillin interaction for at least 3 min (Fig. 4) indicating that these associations are also dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation events. The cross-linking experiment done in the absence of vanadate (Fig. 3) and also the in vitro experiments (Figs. 2, 3, and 6) show that tyrosine phosphorylation is not necessary for the association between syndesmos and paxillin. However, the experiment described in Fig. 4 shows that, if not absolutely necessary for interaction, the tyrosine phosphorylation has a strong enhancing effect on the syndesmos/paxillin interaction possibly by stabilizing the complex.Figure 6Analysis of the paxillin binding region of syndesmos. The region on the full-length chicken syndesmos (GST-Sdos FL) is located in a region conserved in the mouse syndesmos sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) TPA treatment has been shown to trigger focal adhesion formation and to enhance the recruitment of syndecan-4 in these focal adhesions (18.Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 277-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,2.Baciu P.C. Goetinck P.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1503-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Now we are showing that TPA treatment also increases the association of syndesmos with paxillin. It is interesting to note that this increase is very transient and again that the presence of vanadate stabilizes the complex. Since our laboratory has shown that the recruitment of syndecan-4 in focal adhesions could be triggered by TPA treatment we speculate that the increase in syndesmos/paxillin association is involved in the focal adhesion assembly process as well. The short duration would suggest a rapid turnover of that complex. Screening of a mouse cDNA library with a full-length chicken syndesmos cDNA generated a number of clones that encode a protein of 211 amino acids. This sequence is considerably shorter that the 320 amino acids of chicken syndesmos (30.Baciu P.C. Saoncella S. Lee S.H. Denhez F. Leuthardt D. Goetinck P.F. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 315-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the mouse sequence has an extremely high homology to a central region of the chicken sequence (Fig. 5). The mouse sequence does not possess either the four potential initiation methionine residues or an 80-amino acid C-terminal portion found in chicken syndesmos. To define the binding site in chicken syndesmos that interacts with paxillin we performed GST pull-down experiments with a number of GST-syndesmos deletion constructs of chicken or mouse origin. The results of these tests indicate that syndesmos binds to paxillin through the amino acid sequence between amino acids 118 and 205 of the chicken sequence (Fig. 6). This sequence is in the region of high homology with the mouse sequence that also binds paxillin. Focal adhesions are macromolecular complexes that are formed when cells are plated on extracellular matrix components. They are made up of the transmembrane molecules, integrins and syndecan-4, and a large number of cytoplasmic signaling and adaptor proteins. Paxillin is an important cytoplasmic adaptor protein that binds several other focal adhesion-associated proteins such as vinculin, actopaxin, FAK, Src, Crk, and Csk (15.Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 31.Salgia R. Li J.L. Lo S.H. Brunkhorst B. Kansas G.S. Sobhany E.S. Sun Y. Pisick E. Hallek M. Ernst T. Tantrauahi R.

Chem. 1993; 268: 14956-14963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A molecular connection between paxillin and integrins can be established via a vinculin-talin bridge. Vinculin binds both paxillin and talin, and the latter binds the cytoplasmic domain of the β chain of integrins. In the present communication we report on a molecular connection between paxillin and syndecan-4, the second transmembrane receptor of focal adhesions. We show that paxillin binds directly to syndesmos, a cytoplasmic protein that binds specifically to the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4 (30.Baciu P.C. Saoncella S. Lee S.H. Denhez F. Leuthardt D. Goetinck P.F. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 315-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, paxillin, as an important focal adhesion complex adaptor protein, can establish molecular connections between the intracellular focal adhesion complex and integrins and syndecan-4, the two transmembrane proteins of that complex. The connection of paxillin with integrins is through a vinculin-talin bridge and that with syndecan-4 is through syndesmos. It is interesting that the interactions between paxillin and syndesmos can be triggered by the activation of PKC. The variable region of the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-4 binds PIP2 and thus recruits and potentiates PKC activation (27.Gao Y. Li M. Chen W. Simons M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). PKC activation also leads to the assembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers in cells plated on the cell binding domain of fibronectin, a condition in which syndecan-4 is not occupied (18.Woods A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 277-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, cells plated on the cell binding domain of fibronectin can assemble the focal adhesion complex when treated with antibodies directed against syndecan-4 (6.Saoncella S. Echtermeyer F. Denhez F. Nowlen J.K. Mosher D.F. Robinson S.D. Hynes R.O. Goetinck P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2805-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Thus syndecan-4 and integrins signal cooperatively in the assembly of the focal adhesion complex. We have previously shown that overexpression of syndesmos enhances cell spreading (30.Baciu P.C. Saoncella S. Lee S.H. Denhez F. Leuthardt D. Goetinck P.F. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 315-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of syndesmos with paxillin is enhanced following PKC activation. As syndesmos is primarily localized in the cytoplasm it may exist complexed with paxillin. PKC activation may then promote the localization of syndesmos to focal adhesions. The connection of paxillin with the cytoplasmic domains of both syndecan-4 and integrins could represent one aspect of the cooperativity between these receptors in which they would be linked to intracellular signaling pathways through the binding of paxillin to FAK. These signaling pathways could involve the binding of FAK to Graf, an SH3-containing GTPase-activating protein for Rho or the phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 925 on FAK, which allows an interaction with Grb2 and in turn brings SOS, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras, into the complex. Similarly, the interactions of FAK-dependent phosphorylation of paxillin generates a binding site for the adaptor protein Crk, which in turn binds the guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G providing another link to the Ras signaling pathway (8.Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar). These possible interactions for syndecan-4 are shown diagramatically in Fig. 7.

Upon ligand binding the dioxin receptor accumulates in the cell nucleus where it forms a transcriptionally active complex with the bHLH/PAS transcription factor Arnt, which, in turn, induces release of hsp90 from the receptor (4.Kazlauskas A.

In addition, XAP2 contains three tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs), a degenerated sequence motif of 34 amino acids, which play a role in mediating protein-protein interactions (18.Lamb J.R.

In the present study we have identified the structural motifs by which XAP2 regulates function of the dioxin receptor-hsp90 complex. To this end we have generated a series of XAP2 mutants and tested their ability to interact with the dioxin receptor-hsp90 complex and to modulate subcellular localization of the non-activated receptor complex. These experiments demonstrate that the N-terminal region of XAP2 confers stability on the ternary XAP2-dioxin receptor-hsp90 complex, which is a critical prerequisite for XAP2-dependent regulation of dioxin receptor signaling, whereas the C-terminal domain of XAP2 mediates direct interaction with hsp90. pGEM/XAP2 encoding full-length human XAP2 was a generous gift from Edward Seto (University of South Florida, Tampa), and pSPUTK/hFKBP52 encoding full-length human immunophilin FKBP52 was generously provided by David Smith (Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ).

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4741-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and human FKBP52 (22.Peattie D.A. Harding M.W. Fleming M.A. Decenzo M.T. Lippke J.A. Livingston D.J. Benasutti M.

Math. 1991; 12: 373-381Crossref Scopus (844) Google Scholar), version 2.0u, found at the web site www.ch.embnet.org/cgi-bin/LALIGN_form_parser. For in vivo immunoprecipitation experiments, COS7 cells were grown in 10-cm diameter dishes. Expression vectors encoding GST-tagged dioxin receptor (4 μg) and FLAG-tagged proteins (2 μg) were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. To prepare whole cell extracts, cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, and 10 mmNa2MoO4) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete-Mini, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell suspensions were sonicated by two 4-s bursts. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 30 min at 13,000 × g at 4 °C. 600–800 μg of total cellular protein were incubated with anti-FLAG (Sigma) or anti-GST (Amersham Biosciences) antibodies at 4 °C for 2–3 h. Immunocomplexes were precipitated by adding 25 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) followed by incubation at 4 °C under slow rotation for 90 min. After rapid centrifugation, the resulting pellets were washed four times with 1 ml of cold lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins and whole cell extracts were analyzed by 7.5 or 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immobilized proteins were incubated for 2 h at 25 °C with primary rabbit anti-dioxin receptor (Biomol, dilution 1:500), murine anti-FLAG (Sigma, dilution 1:2000) or rabbit polyclonal anti-hsp90 (Ref. 24.Denis M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 173: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, dilution 1:500) antibodies in blocking solution (5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (Dako) or anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences) immunoglobulins were used as secondary antibodies diluted 1:(500–1000) in blocking solution. After extensive washing in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% Tween 20, immunocomplexes were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). HeLa cells were routinely propagated in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 units/ml) at 37 °C at 5% CO2. For intracellular localization assays, cells were grown on 20 × 20-mm glass coverslips in 30-mm diameter dishes. Transient transfections were performed by introducing 0.5 μg of plasmids encoding GFP-fused dioxin receptor and various FLAG-tagged derivatives of XAP2 and FKBP52 into cells by using LipofectAMINE. The total concentrations of DNA were kept constant by compensation with empty expression vectors. After transfection, cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24–30 h. The intracellular localization of dioxin receptor-GFP fusion protein was monitored using a Nikon LABOPHOT microscope equipped with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-filter set and a camera. Quantitative evaluations of green fluorescing cells were performed as described (21.Kazlauskas A.K. Sundström S. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2594-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 25.Kallio P.J. Okamoto K. O'Brien S. Carrero P. Makino Y. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6573-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were classified into four categories according to the intracellular localization of GFP fusion proteins: C>N, for predominantly cytoplasmic fluorescence; C=N, when fluorescing proteins were equally distributed both in the cell cytoplasm and nucleus; N<C, for nuclear dominant fluorescence; and, N, for exclusive nuclear fluorescence. On average, 200 fluorescing cells were routinely evaluated on each coverslip. Recent studies have indicated that interaction between the immunophilin-like protein XAP2 and hsp90 requires the presence of TPRs, which are located in the C-terminal portion of XAP2 (26.Bell D.R. Poland A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36407-36414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 27.Meyer B.K. Petrulis J.R. Perdew G.H. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, the TPR motifs alone appear to be insufficient to mediate the interaction between the XAP2 homolog AIP and the dioxin receptor complex (26.Bell D.R. Poland A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36407-36414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In addition to the TPR motifs, this interaction has been reported to require an additional C-terminal amino acid region, which is located outside the TPR domain, including the very last five amino acids of AIP (326GIFSH330), which have been proposed to directly contact the dioxin receptor (26.Bell D.R. Poland A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36407-36414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Given this background it is important to elucidate the potential role of the distal C-terminal region (DCR) located C-terminally from the TPR motifs of XAP2 in creating a substrate-specific recognition site for the dioxin receptor. To address this question, we examined if the DCR of XAP2 will be able to act as an independent interaction interface for the dioxin receptor when fused to the immunophilin FKBP52, which specifically interacts with steroid hormone receptors (for a review, see Ref. 28.Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar), but does not form a stable interaction with the dioxin receptor (19.Carver L.A. LaPres J.J. Jain S. Dunham E.E. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33580-33587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). We generated FLAG epitope-tagged fusion constructs spanning wild-type XAP2, wild-type FKBP52, DCR deletion constructs of XAP2 and FKBP52, respectively, and chimeric XAP2-FKBP52 proteins in which the DCR motifs were reciprocally exchanged (schematically represented in Fig. 1A). These constructs were transiently expressed in COS7 cells (Fig. 1B, upper panel) together with the GST-tagged dioxin receptor or GST tag alone (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Protein complexes bound to the FLAG-tagged XAP2 and FKBP52 constructs were immunoprecipitated from whole cell extracts (WCEs) by anti-FLAG antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1C, wild-type XAP2 was specifically immunoprecipitated together with the dioxin receptor (upper panel, compare lanes 1 and 3) and hsp90 (lower panel, compare lanes 1–3). XAP2 weakly interacted with hsp90 in the absence of the dioxin receptor, while in the presence of the receptor, XAP2 association with hsp90 was markedly increased (lower panel, compare lanes 2 and 3). The DCR deletion construct of XAP2 (XAP2ΔDCR), however, failed to interact with both the dioxin receptor (lane 5 in upper panel) and hsp90 (lanes 4 and 5 in lower panel). Interestingly, fusion of the DCR domain from FKBP52 to XAP2ΔDCR fully restored the interaction of XAP2 with both the dioxin receptor (lane 7 in upper panel) and hsp90 in a receptor-dependent manner (lanes 6 and 7 in lower panel). As expected (19.Carver L.A. LaPres J.J. Jain S. Dunham E.E. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33580-33587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), wild-type FKBP52, as well as the FKBP52ΔDCR, did not interact with the dioxin receptor (upper panel, lanes 9 and 11, respectively). On the other hand, both constructs interacted with hsp90 with a similar potency. Consistent with earlier observations (19.Carver L.A. LaPres J.J. Jain S. Dunham E.E. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33580-33587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), the dioxin receptor had no stabilizing effect on association of the FKBP52 constructs with hsp90 (lower panel, lanes 8–11). The DCR domain of XAP2, which contains the putative dioxin receptor contact site,326GIFSH330 (26.Bell D.R. Poland A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36407-36414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), however, failed to mediate interaction with the dioxin receptor complex when fused to FKBP52 (lane 13 in upper panel) and did not enhance the association between FKBP52 and hsp90 (lower panel, lanes 12 and 13). These experiments suggest that the DCR domain of XAP2 is required for direct association between XAP2 and hsp90 rather than mediating specificity in XAP2-dioxin receptor interaction. Because the DCR domain of FKBP52 fully reconstituted the interaction between XAP2 and the dioxin receptor complex, it was of interest to test whether this region of FKBP52 was also able to restore the function of XAP2 in regulating intracellular localization of the dioxin receptor. We therefore co-expressed various FLAG-tagged XAP2 or FKBP52 constructs together with GFP-tagged dioxin receptor in HeLa cells and examined the intracellular localization of the dioxin receptor-GFP by fluorescent microscopy (17.Kazlauskas A. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41317-41324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 21.Kazlauskas A.K. Sundström S. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2594-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In agreement with our earlier observations (17.Kazlauskas A. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41317-41324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 21.Kazlauskas A.K. Sundström S. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2594-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), the dioxin receptor-GFP fusion protein was evenly distributed in both cell cytoplasm and nucleus when co-expressed together with the FLAG epitope alone. In contrast, upon co-expression of wild-type XAP2, we observed relocalization of dioxin receptor-GFP to the cytoplasmic compartment of the cell (Fig. 2). Importantly, accumulation of the dioxin receptor-GFP in the cell cytoplasm was also mediated by the chimeric form of XAP2 (XAP2FDCR), which harbors the DCR domain of FKBP52 (Fig. 2). The other tested XAP2 and FKBP52 constructs, including XAP2ΔDCR, wild-type FKBP52 and the FKBP52XDCR, which did not associate with the dioxin receptor complex in the co-immunoprecipitation experiment (Fig. 1), had no effect on the intracellular localization of the dioxin receptor-GFP (Fig. 2). Next we examined the role of the N-terminal part of XAP2 in formation of the ternary XAP2-dioxin receptor-hsp90 complex. We generated a series of FLAG-tagged N-terminal deletion constructs of XAP2 (schematically presented in Fig. 3A) and the FLAG-tagged N-terminal fragment of XAP2, XAP2-(1–169). These XAP2 mutants, as well as wild-type XAP2, were transiently expressed together with the GST-dioxin receptor in COS7 cells (Fig. 3B). The GST-dioxin receptor complex was immunoprecipitated by anti-GST antibodies, and FLAG-tagged XAP2 constructs were detected in immunoblot assays with anti-FLAG antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3C, deletion of the first 148 amino acids from the N terminus of XAP2 did not inhibit the binding of XAP2 to the dioxin receptor complex (lanes 4–7). Notably, the XAP2-(84–330) construct was expressed at low levels, and it was very unstable in WCE preparations unless the dioxin receptor was present (see below). However, this XAP2 mutant efficiently interacted with both the dioxin receptor complex (lane 4) and hsp90 (see below). Further amino acid deletions from the N-terminal part of XAP2, however, completely abolished association between XAP2 and the dioxin receptor complex (Fig. 3C, lanes 8 and 9). The N-terminal fragment of XAP2 alone, XAP2-(1–169), on the other hand, was unable to bind to the dioxin receptor (Fig. 3C, lane 10) because it lacks the TPR- and DCR- containing C-terminal structures critical for interaction with hsp90 (Refs. 26.Bell D.R. Poland A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36407-36414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar and 27.Meyer B.K. Petrulis J.R. Perdew G.H. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). It is noteworthy that among the tested XAP2 mutants none had a stabilizing effect on dioxin receptor protein levels. On the contrary, some of the N-terminal truncation mutants of XAP2 induced a decrease of GST-dioxin receptor expression levels (Fig. 3B, lower panel). We also tested the ability of the various XAP2 N-terminal deletion mutants to interact with the molecular chaperone hsp90. The XAP2 mutants, as well as wild-type XAP2, were expressed in COS7 cells in the presence or absence of GST-dioxin receptor (Fig. 4A). FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 4B), and immunocomplexes were visualized with anti-hsp90 antibodies in immunoblot assays. As already observed in the previous experiment (Fig. 1C), specific interaction between XAP2 and hsp90 was markedly increased in the presence of the dioxin receptor (Fig. 4B, lanes 1–3). This receptor-dependent stabilizing effect on XAP2-hsp90 association was lost upon progressive truncation of the N-terminal part of XAP2 (Fig. 4B, lanes 4–11). Notably, all tested N-terminal truncation mutants of XAP2 were able to interact with hsp90, including the XAP2-(162–330) construct, which did not form a stable complex with the dioxin receptor. As expected (Refs. 26.Bell D.R. Poland A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36407-36414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar and 27.Meyer B.K. Petrulis J.R. Perdew G.H. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar and Fig. 1), the N-terminal fragment of XAP2, XAP2-(1–169), failed to interact with hsp90 (Fig. 4B, lanes 12 and 13). The present data suggest that the N terminus of XAP2 serves as a site of interaction with the dioxin receptor complex and seems to be required for the stability of the ternary XAP2-dioxin receptor-hsp90 complex. To further test this hypothesis, we generated the two internal deletion mutants of XAP2, XAP2-Δ86–161 and XAP2-Δ113–161, by fusing the fragments from the N-terminal region of XAP2 (amino acids 1–85 and 1–112, respectively) to the C-terminal fragment of XAP2, XAP2-(162–330) (schematically depicted in Fig. 5A), which does not stably interact with the dioxin receptor by itself. FLAG-tagged XAP2-Δ86–161 and XAP2-Δ113–161, as well as wild-type XAP2 and XAP2-(162–330), were expressed in COS7 cells in the presence or absence of GST-dioxin receptor (Fig. 5B). The GST-dioxin receptor complex was immunoprecipitated by anti-GST antibodies and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 5C). As already observed above (Fig. 3C), GST-dioxin receptor specifically interacted with wild-type XAP2 (Fig. 5C, lanes 2 and 3) but no stable interaction was detected between the dioxin receptor and XAP2-(162–330) (Fig. 5C, lanes 4 and 5). Interestingly, specific interaction with the GST-dioxin receptor was mediated by XAP2-Δ86–161 (Fig. 5C, lane 7). In a similar fashion, XAP2-Δ113–161 also interacted with the dioxin receptor (Fig. 5C, lane 9). In addition, despite the lower expression levels of XAP2-Δ113–161, this construct was recovered with a greater efficiency as compared with XAP2-Δ86–161 (compare lanes 7 and 9 in Fig. 5, B and C). Notably, although the internal deletion mutants interacted with the dioxin receptor, these constructs displayed a rather destabilizing effect on protein levels of the receptor (Fig. 5B, lower panel). A similar effect was produced by N-terminal truncation mutants of XAP2. The anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation experiment (Fig. 5D), performed in parallel to the anti-GST experiment, showed that all tested XAP2 constructs specifically interacted with hsp90 (lanes 1–9). As observed above (Fig. 4), interaction between wild-type XAP2 and hsp90 was markedly increased by the presence of the dioxin receptor in the complex (compare lanes 2 and 3), whereas the receptor-dependent stabilizing effect on XAP2-hsp90 interaction was completely lost in the case of XAP2-(162–330) (lanes 4 and 5). On the other hand, the dioxin receptor had only a marginal stabilizing effect on the interaction between hsp90 and the two internal deletion mutants of XAP2, XAP2-Δ86–161 and XAP2-Δ113–161, respectively. Taken together, these data support our notion that the N-terminal part of XAP2 serves as an interaction site for the dioxin receptor complex and plays an important role in conferring stability upon the ternary XAP2-dioxin receptor-hsp90 complex. The molecular mechanisms underlying XAP2-induced relocalization of the dioxin receptor to the cytoplasmic compartment of the cell are unknown. To clarify this question it would be important to identify the structural region(s) within XAP2 that are required to regulate the intracellular localization of the dioxin receptor. We therefore examined effects of the N-terminal mutants of XAP2 on intracellular localization of the dioxin receptor by co-expressing these proteins together with the GFP-tagged dioxin receptor in Hela cells. The intracellular localization of the dioxin receptor-GFP was monitored by fluorescence microscopy, and quantitative evaluations of green fluorescent cells were performed as described earlier (21.Kazlauskas A.K. Sundström S. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2594-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 25.Kallio P.J. Okamoto K. O'Brien S. Carrero P. Makino Y. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6573-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and under “Materials and Methods.” Representative images of green fluorescent cells are presented in Fig. 6. Upon co-expression of XAP2-(84–330), dioxin receptor-GFP displayed an unusual perinuclear localization pattern very different from the pattern induced by wild-type XAP2, where the dioxin receptor-GFP is evenly distributed within the cytoplasmic compartment of the cell (Ref. 17.Kazlauskas A. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41317-41324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar and Figs. 2 and 6). Mutants XAP2-(112–330) and XAP2-(121–330) (and XAP2-(148–330); not shown), however, failed to induce cytoplasmic relocalization of dioxin receptor-GFP (Fig. 6). Moreover, according to the statistical evaluation of the data from these experiments, these constructs resulted in an increase in the number of cells displaying the predominantly nuclear localization pattern of dioxin receptor-GFP. More specifically, predominant nuclear localization (corresponding to categories C<N and N, as outlined under “Materials and Methods”) was observed in 10–15% of control cells, whereas this intracellular localization pattern was observed in 50–60% of cells expressing mutants XAP2-(112–330) and XAP2-(121–330) (data not shown). We suggest that this may be due to a depletion of the dioxin receptor from the cell cytoplasm rather than facilitation of ligand-independent nuclear import of the receptor, because we observed a decrease in protein levels of the dioxin receptor in the presence of XAP2-(112–330), XAP2-(121–330) and XAP2-(148–330) (Fig. 3). Notably, XAP2-(162–330) did not have any detectable effects on the intracellular localization pattern of dioxin receptor-GFP (Fig. 6), in agreement with the observation that this XAP2 mutant does not stably interact with the dioxin receptor complex (Fig. 3). In the presence of the internal-deletion constructs of XAP2, XAP2-Δ86–161 and XAP2-Δ113–161, we observed perinuclear accumulation of dioxin receptor-GFP. A similar intracellular distribution pattern was also observed in the presence of XAP2-(84–330) (Fig. 6). Thus, despite the ability of a number of the deletion mutants of XAP2 to interact with the dioxin receptor, i.e. XAP2-(84–330), XAP2-(112–330), XAP2-(121–330), XAP2-Δ86–161, and XAP2-Δ113–161, these constructs failed to induce the homogenous cytoplasmic localization pattern of the dioxin receptor-GFP in the cell cytoplasm. Thus, our results show that deletions of the N-terminal region of XAP2 compromised the function of this protein in regulating intracellular localization of the dioxin receptor. In conclusion, our data suggest that the N-terminal part of XAP2 is required not only to mediate the interaction with the dioxin receptor but is also of critical importance for XAP2 function. The immunophilin-like protein XAP2 is a recently identified immunophilin component of the dioxin receptor-hsp90 complex (5.Carver L.A. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11452-11456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 6.Ma Q. Whitlock J.P. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 18: 978-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), whereas the homologous immunophilin FKBP52 specifically interacts with steroid hormone receptors (see Ref. 28.Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar for a review) and does not form a stable complex with the dioxin receptor (Ref. 19.Carver L.A. LaPres J.J. Jain S. Dunham E.E. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33580-33587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar and Fig. 1 in this study). The C-terminal part of XAP2 contains three TPR motifs, which share a high degree of homology with the immunophilin FKBP52 (5.Carver L.A. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11452-11456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). In analogy to FKBP52, the TPR region of XAP2 is critical for interaction with hsp90 (26.Bell D.R. Poland A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36407-36414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 27.Meyer B.K. Petrulis J.R. Perdew G.H. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It is still unclear how immunophilin proteins such as FKBP52 and XAP2 recognize their cognate target hsp90-bound complexes. Interestingly, a comparison between the immunophilins FKBP52 and FKBP51 with regard to their ability to recognize the progesterone receptor-hsp90 complex indicated that the C-terminal region of FKBP51, located outside the TPR motifs, plays a role in conferring receptor specificity (29.Barent R.L. Nair S.C. Carr D.C. Ruan Y. Rimerman R.A. Fulton J.Y.Z. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 342-354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the XAP2 homolog AIP it has been shown that, in addition to TPR motifs, C-terminal amino acids located outside the TPR region are required for interaction with the dioxin receptor complex (26.Bell D.R. Poland A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36407-36414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the very last five amino acids of AIP (326GIFSH330) have been implicated in mediating a direct contact between the immunophilin-like protein and the dioxin receptor. On the other hand, our data indicate that the DCR region located outside the TPR motifs of XAP2 can be functionally substituted by the analogous region from FKBP52. Notably, immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that this region of XAP2 is more likely to play a role in mediating direct association with hsp90 rather than mediating preferential binding to the dioxin receptor complex. However, our results do not exclude the possibility that the DCR domain of XAP2 may contribute to direct association between XAP2 and the dioxin receptor. The alignment of primary sequences revealed a 28.9% amino acid identity between the N-terminal part of XAP2 (amino acids 9–90) and the N-terminal part of FKBP52 (amino acids 29–107) which also overlaps with its peptidyl-prolyl isomerase domain (22.Peattie D.A. Harding M.W. Fleming M.A. Decenzo M.T. Lippke J.A. Livingston D.J. Benasutti M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10974-10978Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). It is presently not clear whether the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase-like domain of XAP2 has a catalytic activity. Our experiments on deletion mutants of XAP2 suggest that the N-terminal portion of XAP2 contains an additional site of interaction with the dioxin receptor or dioxin receptor-hsp90 complex. Thus, this structure acts in concert with the C-terminally located TPR motifs and the distal C-terminal region of XAP2 in recognition of the dioxin receptor complex. In addition, the N-terminal region of XAP2 seems to confer stability to the ternary XAP2-dioxin receptor-hsp90 complex, because association between the N-terminal truncation/internal deletion mutants of XAP2 and hsp90 was poorly stabilized by the presence of the dioxin receptor. In contrast, wild-type XAP2 binds hsp90 very tightly in the presence of the receptor. Importantly, the loss of the ability of XAP2 to stabilize a ternary complex with the dioxin receptor and hsp90 correlates with the failure of XAP2 to induce a homogeneous, predominantly cytoplasmic localization of the non-activated dioxin receptor complex. Notably, none of the tested N-terminal deletion mutants of XAP2 showed any stabilizing effects on dioxin receptor protein levels. In fact, we observed a decrease in dioxin receptor protein levels upon co-expression of some of these XAP2 mutants. Two plausible scenarios are likely to explain these observations. In one scenario, XAP2 elicits its function by changing the protein conformation of either the dioxin receptor alone or the entire dioxin receptor-hsp90 complex. Therefore some of the XAP2 mutants may affect the conformation of the dioxin receptor/dioxin receptor complex in such a way that the receptor becomes no longer protected against ubiquitination (17.Kazlauskas A. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41317-41324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) or becomes even more sensitive to degradation. In the alternative scenario, the proteosome-dependent degradation machinery might recognize conformational changes within the XAP2 deletion mutants themselves, and, by virtue of XAP2-dioxin receptor interaction, target the receptor for degradation. In conclusion, we have identified two distinct functional regions within the immunophilin-like protein XAP2. (i) The TPR- and DCR-containing C-terminal region of XAP2 is required to directly contact the molecular chaperone hsp90. This represents a general function observed in other TPR-containing immunophilin proteins such as FKBP52 or Cyp40. (ii) The N-terminal portion of XAP2 has a more specific role: regulation of dioxin receptor function. Importantly, the stability of the ternary XAP2-dioxin receptor-hsp90 complex is a critical prerequisite for XAP2-dependent regulation of dioxin receptor signaling.

Traversal of E. coli across the blood-brain barrier is a crucial event in the pathogenesis of E. coli meningitis. Our previous studies have shown that outer membrane protein A (OmpA) expression is necessary in E. coli for a mechanism involving actin filaments in its passage through the endothelial cells. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) have also been activated in host cells during the process of invasion. In an attempt to elucidate the mechanisms leading to actin filament condensation, we have focused our attention on protein kinase C (PKC), an enzyme central to many signaling events, including actin rearrangement. In the current study, specific PKC inhibitors, bisindolmaleimide and a PKC-inhibitory peptide, inhibited E. coli invasion of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) by more than 75% in a dose-dependent manner, indicating a significant role played by this enzyme in the invasion process. Our results further showed that OmpA+ E. coli induces significant activation of PKC in HBMEC as measured by the PepTag nonradioactive assay. In addition, we identified that the PKC isoform activated in E. coli invasion is a member of the conventional family of PKC, PKC-α, which requires calcium for activation. Immunocytochemical studies have indicated that the activated PKC-α is associated with actin condensation beneath the bacterial entry site. Overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of PKC-α in HBMEC abolished the E. coli invasion without significant changes in FAK phosphorylation or PI3K activity patterns. In contrast, in HBMEC overexpressing the mutant forms of either FAK or PI3K, E. coli-induced PKC activation was significantly blocked. Furthermore, our studies showed that activation of PKC-α induces the translocation of myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate, an actin cross-linking protein and a substrate for PKC-α, from the membrane to cytosol. This is the first report of FAK- and PI3K-dependent PKC-α activation in bacterial invasion related to cytoskeletal reorganization.

Among the several pathogenic bacteria causing meningitis in neonates, E. coli is the most common. The mortality and morbidity associated with this infection is significantly high, with the case fatality rates ranging from 15 to 40% (1.Gladstone I.M. Ehrenkranz R.A. Edberg S.C. Baltimore R.S.

This poor outcome can be attributed to the insufficient understanding of the pathogenesis of this highly prevalent pathogen, which hinders the development of new therapeutic strategies. Traversal of E. coli across the blood-brain barrier is a crucial event in the pathogenesis; however, the mechanisms underlying this process have yet to be clearly elucidated. Cell culture models have been used to dissect the pathogenic process into discrete events involving one or more virulence associated factors and their interplay with the host cell surface structures (5.Finlay B.B.

Following the initial interaction between the host and E. coli, the bacteria is progressively drawn into the host by a “zipper mechanism,” which utilizes the bacterium-induced actin filaments for bacterial uptake (12.Prasadarao N.V. Wass C.A. Stins M.F. Shimada H. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5775-5783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous studies showed that E. coli induces actin condensation beneath the bacterial entry site, which contains highly phosphorylated proteins including focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin, a cytoskeletal protein associated with FAK (13.Reddy M.A. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. Schlaepfer D.D. Prasadarao N.V. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6423-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). FAK, a 125-kDa nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, plays a crucial role in the assembly of signaling complexes, thereby mediating F-actin rearrangements in the cell (14.Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). The activated FAK interacts with the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), p85 for further signaling events that are necessary for actin reorganization (15.Reddy M.A. Prasadarao N.V.

However, it is not known which other signaling molecules play a role in E. coli invasion of HBMEC.

Newton A.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Fields A.P. Reyland M.E. Insel P.A. Messing R.O. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L429-L438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on their structure, 12 different isoforms of PKC have been identified and are divided into three groups: (i) classical or conventional PKC (α, βI, βII, γ), which are activated by diacylglycerol (DAG) or calcium; (ii) novel PKCs (δ, η, θ, μ, ε, ξ), which can be activated by DAG but not calcium; and (iii) atypical PKCs (ζ, ν, ι), which are not responsive to either DAG or calcium. Unphosphorylated PKC is associated with the membrane, where it is phosphorylated on its activation loop by external stimuli. The immediate consequence of this event is the autophosphorylation of two positions in the carboxyl terminus (C-1 and C-2) of PKC. The phosphorylated enzyme is maintained in its inactive conformation in the cytosol by binding to an autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate. PKC attains its active conformation when DAG recruits the inactive PKC to the membrane in a calcium-dependent manner, where membrane binding provides sufficient energy to disengage the pseudosubstrate, thus exposing the substrate-binding site. Myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS) is a primary and prominent protein substrate for PKC, which binds calmodulin in a calcium-dependent manner and also binds to phospholipid membrane (17.Zhao Y.

MARCKS has been shown to bind to and cross-link filamentous actin and has been implicated in cellular processes associated with cytoskeletal restructuring, specifically by regulating actin-membrane interaction (23.Yarmola E.G. Edison A.S. Lenox R.H. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22351-22358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). MARCKS is an acidic protein of 309 amino acids with an apparent molecular mass of 65 kDa. It contains three conserved domains: (i) a basic effector, (ii) phosphorylation site domain, and (iii) a myristoylated amino-terminal domain, which, along with the phosphorylation site domain, helps anchor the protein to the inner surface of the plasma membrane. MARCKS has the capacity to cycle between the membrane and the cytosol. The nonphosphorylated protein associates tightly with the membranes by the cooperative binding energies contributed by the insertion of the myristic acid moiety into the lipid bilayer and by the electrostatic interaction of the basic effector domain with acidic phospholipids. PKC-dependent phosphorylation introduces negative charges into the positively charged effector domain, thereby neutralizing the electrostatic interaction, which results in the displacement of MARCKS from the membrane. In addition to its role in associating MARCKS with the membrane, the phosphorylation domain of the MARCKS protein serves as an important binding site for both F-actin and calmodulin (24.Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Thus, MARCKS plays a significant role in translating extracellular signals to events associated with actin plasticity and actin plasma membrane interactions like phagocytosis, membrane trafficking, membrane ruffling, and formations of lamellipodia (19.Myat M.M. Anderson S. Allen L.A. Aderem A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Allen L.H. Aderem A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 829-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that PKC-α is autophosphorylated and translocates to the membrane upon E. coli invasion of HBMEC. The activated PKC-α co-localizes with actin condensation points induced by invasive E. coli at the bacterial entry site. Overexpression of a dominant negative form of PKC-α significantly inhibits the E. coli invasion, PKC activation, and its association with actin. In addition, the data suggest that the PKC-α activation is FAK- and PI3K-dependent and probably acts downstream of PI3K. The activation of MARCKS, a substrate for PKC-α, and its translocation to the cytosol from the membrane have been highlighted. E. coli E44 is a rifampin-resistant mutant of E. coli K1 strain RS 218 (serotype O18:K1:H7), which has been isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of a neonate with meningitis and invades HBMEC in a cell culture model (8.Prasadarao N.V.

Mammalian expression vectors for PKC were described previously (26.Soh J.W. Lee E.H. Prywes R. Weistein I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Both wild type and mutant PKC proteins were cloned into pcDNA3, which provides G418 resistance to transfected cells. LipofectAMINE was obtained from Invitrogen. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. HBMEC were isolated and cultured as described earlier (7.Stins M.F. Prasadarao N.V. Ibric L. Wass C.A. Luckett P. Kim K.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 1228-1236PubMed Google Scholar). HBMEC cultures were routinely grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 10% Nu-serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), essential amino acids, and vitamins. HBMEC were transfected with mammalian expression vectors using LipofectAMINE. Briefly, DNA-LipofectAMINE in RPMI 1640 was added to 50% confluent HBMEC monolayers. After 6 h of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed with RPMI 1640, and complete medium was added. Three days following transfection, HBMEC were transferred to medium containing the antibiotic G418 (400 μg/ml) for 3 weeks, and the antibiotic-resistant colonies were either pooled or separated into individual clones for further analysis. Confluent HBMEC in 24-well plates were incubated with 1 × 107 E. coli in experimental medium (1:1 mixture of Ham's F-12 and M-199 containing 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum) for 90 min at 37 °C. Monolayers were washed three times with RPMI 1640 and incubated in experimental medium containing gentamicin (100 μg/ml) for 1 h to kill extracellular bacteria. The monolayers were washed again and lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100. The intracellular bacteria were enumerated by plating on sheep blood agar plates. In some experiments, HBMEC were pretreated with various inhibitors for 30 min prior to the addition of bacteria. Effects of these inhibitors on HBMEC were assessed by the trypan blue exclusion method, and effects on bacterial viability were tested by colony plate counting. For detection of PKC activity from the infected monolayers, confluent monolayers of HBMEC grown on collagen-coated dishes (60-mm diameter) were washed with RPMI 1640, and E. coli suspended in the experimental medium was added. Following stimulation for different time periods (0, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min) the cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and placed on ice. The cells in each 60-mm dish were harvested by scraping on ice into 2 ml of cell homogenization buffer (buffer A) consisting of 20 mmTris (pH 7.5), 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg of leupeptin per ml, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The cells were subjected to mild sonication, and the cell lysates were used for the PepTag assay. To obtain the membrane and cytosolic fractions, the cell lysates in the above buffer were initially centrifuged at 10,000 × g to remove the debris followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 45 min. The supernatant from this step was designated as the cytosolic fraction, and the pellet was designated as the membrane fraction. The PepTag assay utilizes a brightly colored, florescent peptide substrate that is highly specific to PKC (according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega)). Phosphorylation by PKC changes the net charge of the substrate from +1 to −1, thereby allowing the phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated versions of the substrate to be separated on an agarose (0.8%) gel. The phosphorylated species migrates toward the positive electrode, while the nonphosphorylated substrate migrates toward the negative electrode. The phosphorylated peptide in the band can then be visualized under UV light. HBMEC total lysates or membrane proteins (10–25 μg in 10 μl) were incubated with PKC reaction mixture (25 μl) according to the manufacturer's (Promega) protocol at 30 °C for 30 min. The reactions were stopped by placing the tubes in a boiling water bath. After adding 80% glycerol (1 μl), the samples were loaded onto an agarose gel (0.8% agarose in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The samples were separated on the agarose gel in the same buffer at 100 V for 15 min, and the bands were visualized under UV light. Immediately after photographing the gel (within 10 min), the negatively charged phosphorylated bands were excised using a razor blade, placed in a graduated microcentrifuge tube, and heated at 95 °C until the gel slice melted. The volume of the solution was adjusted to 250 μl with water. The hot agarose solution (175 μl) was added to a separate tube containing 75 μl of gel solubilization solution, 100 μl of glacial acetic acid, and 150 μl of distilled water. The mixture was vortexed and then transferred to a cuvette, and absorbency was read at 570 nm. Using the absorbance, we calculated the number of units of kinase activity in each slice of agarose as per the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Total cell lysates of HBMEC exposed to bacteria for varying time periods were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and protein content was determined. For immunoprecipitations, 300–500 μg of protein was incubated with the appropriate antibody overnight at 4 °C and then incubated for 1 h with protein A-agarose. The immune complexes were washed four times with cell lysate buffer, and the proteins bound to agarose were eluted in SDS sample buffer for further analysis by Western blotting. Portions of the cell lysates were subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) for 2 h at room temperature. The blot was then incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4 °C in 5% bovine serum albumin/TBST. The blot was washed with TBST and further incubated with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the blot was washed four times with TBST for 1 h, developed with SuperSignal chemiluminescence reagent, and exposed to x-ray film to visualize the proteins. The protein bands on the x-ray films were quantitated on a Bio-Rad densitometer using Alpha-imager software (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Francisco, CA). HBMEC were grown in eight-well chamber slides coated with collagen and infected with E. coli as described above. The monolayers were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the monolayers were incubated with 5% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 (NGS/PBST) for 30 min and further incubated with primary antibody in NGS/PBST for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to Cy2 and rhodamine phalloidin for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed again, the chambers were removed, and the slides were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) anti-fade solution containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Cells were viewed by a Leica (Wetzlar, Germany) DMRA microscope with Plan-apochromat ×40/1.25 NA and ×63/1.40 NA oil immersion objective lenses. Image acquisition was with a SkyVision-2/VDS digital CCD (12-bit, 1280 × 1024 pixel) camera in unbinned or 2 × 2-binned models into EasyFISH software, saved as 16-bit monochrome, and merged as 24-bit RGB TIFF images (Applied Spectral Imaging Inc., Carlsbad, CA) Our previous studies showed that expression of OmpA on E. coli is necessary for effective invasion of HBMEC (8.Prasadarao N.V. Wass C.A. Weiser J.N. Stins M.F. Huang S.H. Kim K.S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 146-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, FAK activation and its subsequent interaction with PI3K have been shown to associate with the actin rearrangements underneath the bacterial entry site and are required for the invasion (13.Reddy M.A. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. Schlaepfer D.D. Prasadarao N.V. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6423-6430Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15.Reddy M.A. Prasadarao N.V. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36769-36774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To further extrapolate the signaling pathways involved in the E. coli invasion, we attempted to identify the role of PKC. Initially, E. coli invasion assays were performed following treatment of the cells with various concentrations of BIM, a specific PKC inhibitor. BIM was effective in blocking the invasion of OmpA+ E. coli, E44 in a dose-dependent manner with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 10 μm and 75% inhibition with 20 μm (1.12 × 104 ± 0.03 × 104 cfu/well for untreated HBMEC versus 0.3 × 104 ± 0.05 × 104 cfu/well for 20 μm BIM, p < 0.001) (Fig. 1A). However, the total cell-associated bacteria (represented as binding) did not differ between untreated and BIM-treated cells (3.1 × 105 ± 0.7 × 105 cfu/well for untreated HBMEC versus 3.4 × 105 ± 0.5 × 105 cfu/well for BIM-treated HBMEC), indicating that the inhibition is not due to inefficient binding of E. coli to HBMEC. In contrast, the OmpA− E. coli strain, which did not show significant invasion, also showed no inhibition of either total cell-associated bacteria or background invasion (data not shown). Similarly, pretreatment of HBMEC with another PKC-specific inhibitor, a 10-amino acid peptide, which resembles the pseudosubstrate sequence of PKC-α (PKC-IP) and blocks PKC translocation of the activated PKC to the membrane, also showed significant inhibitory effect on E. coli invasion. A dose of 50 μm was able to exert an inhibition of ∼50%, while a dose of 100 μm exerted an inhibitory effect of 75% invasion of HBMEC (1.0 × 104 ± 0.3 × 104 cfu/well for untreated HBMEC versus 0.21 × 104 ± 0.10 × 104 cfu/well for PKC-IP-treated HBMEC, p < 0.001) (Fig. 1B). We also used RGD and RPDS peptides as control peptides in the invasion assays, which showed no significant effect on the invasion. None of these inhibitors showed either antibacterial effect or cytotoxicity to HBMEC under the conditions employed. These results suggest that the activation of PKC and its translocation to the membrane might be playing a role in E. coli invasion. Having demonstrated the importance of PKC activation and its translocation to the membrane in the E. coli invasion, we examined the level of PKC activation in HBMEC exposed to the OmpA+ E. coli strain E44 and to OmpA− E. coli strain E91. HBMEC were treated with the E. coli strains for different time periods, and the total cell lysates were analyzed for PKC activity, based on the ability to phosphorylate the PKC-specific substrate provided in the PepTag assay kit. HBMEC treated with HB101 were used as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 2A, HBMEC infected with E44 demonstrated significant PKC activity within 10 min, which peaked at 15 min and decreased by 30 min. The increased PKC activity was approximately 4-fold compared with PKC activity in control as estimated by the spectrophotometric method using phosphorylated substrate peptides (0.09 units/ml for untreated cells versus0.36 units/ml at 15 min for HBMEC treated with E44, p< 0.01) (Fig. 2B). However, cells treated with either E91 or HB101 did not show such an increase in the activity, indicating that the OmpA interaction with HBMEC is important for inducing the signals leading to the activation of PKC. Interestingly, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (positive control)-treated HBMEC lysates showed PKC activation even at 30 min (Fig. 2C), suggesting that E. coli induced PKC activation might be for a short period of time. These results are in agreement with our previous studies of actin rearrangement, which occurs at 15 min postinfection of HBMEC with OmpA+ E. coli. Treating HBMEC with BIM prior to the infection with OmpA+ E. coli completely abolished the PKC activation (Fig. 2C). This corroborates with the results of E. coli invasion of BIM-treated HBMEC. Since OmpA+E. coli induces significant activation of PKC, we set out to identify which PKC isoform was activated. Among the various isoforms of"

To exploit the archaeal repertoire of proteins involved in DNA replication for use in PCR, we elucidated the network of proteins implicated in this process in Archaeoglobus fulgidus. To this end, we performed extensive yeast two-hybrid screens using putative archaeal replication factors as starting points. This approach yielded a protein network involving 30 proteins potentially implicated in archaeal DNA replication including several novel factors. Based on these results, we were able to improve PCR reactions catalyzed by archaeal DNA polymerases by supplementing the reaction with predicted polymerase co-factors. In this approach we concentrated on the archaeal proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) homologue. This protein is known to encircle DNA as a ring in eukaryotes, tethering other proteins to DNA. Indeed, addition ofA. fulgidus PCNA resulted in marked stimulation of PCR product generation. The PCNA-binding domain was determined, and a hybrid DNA polymerase was constructed by grafting this domain onto the classical PCR enzyme from Thermus aquaticus, Taq DNA polymerase. Addition of PCNA to PCR reactions catalyzed by the fusion protein greatly stimulated product generation, most likely by tethering the enzyme to DNA.

Biochem. 1999; 32: 1-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has evolved to handle the tasks associated with this process. The importance of replication is demonstrated by the fact that its central features are highly conserved among all cellular organisms, while the protein sequences of some of the factors are not. This is exemplified by the processivity factors of DNA polymerases. Processivity is defined as the number of polymerization events during a single contact between polymerase and template. To prevent dissociation off the template DNA, many polymerases are bound by a protein that encircles the DNA in a ring-like structure. Together with the polymerase, the ring appears to move along the DNA as replication proceeds. Such “sliding clamps” exist both for eubacteria (the β-subunit of the polymerase) and for eukaryotes (PCNA),1 and the structures of these proteins are almost superimposable (4Tsurimoto T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1443: 23-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, the proteins are highly deviant in primary sequence. This situation of sequence divergence and functional conservation is also evident for the proteins responsible for loading the sliding clamp onto the DNA. Whereas in eukaryotes the clamp loader is a heteropentameric complex called RFC (2Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 5Mossi R.

For example a clear homologue of PCNA can be found in all published archaebacterial genomes, (9Cann I.K. Ishino S. Yuasa M. Daiyasu H. Toh H. Ishino Y. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6591-6599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but no homologues for the eubacterial β-clamp or other eubacterial replication factors have been discovered. Furthermore,bona fide homologues of the eukaryotic DNA polymerase δ can be identified in archaea (10Cann I.K. Ishino Y. Genetics. 1999; 152: 1249-1267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In other cases, the situation is not as straightforward. For the eukaryotic five-subunit clamp loader RFC, only two homologues could be identified so far in archaea (10Cann I.K. Ishino Y.

Remarkably, however, these reactions are orders of magnitude less efficient than the in vivo DNA replication process with respect to fidelity, speed, and product size.

In the androgenetic fetuses, the <i>H19</i> and <i>Igf2r</i> genes were respectively expressed at 12 and 40% of the levels in biparental fetuses. In addition, the expression of both genes was excessive (1259 and 482%, respectively) in the parthenotes. These expressions of the imprinted genes were not regulated by methylation in the regulatory regions. Moreover, the expression of the antisense <i>Igf2r</i> RNA (<i>Air</i>) was also excessive and was not correlated with <i>Igf2r</i> gene expression in the uniparental fetuses. Taken together, these results indicate that the parental specific expression of imprinted genes is not maintained in particular genes in uniparental embryos, which in turn suggests that both parental genomes are required to establish maternal specific expression of the <i>H19</i> and <i>Igf2r</i> genes by trans-acting mechanisms."

In order to provide insights into the catalytic mechanism of Cdc25, we have performed a detailed mechanistic analysis of the catalytic domain of human Cdc25A. Our kinetic isotope effect results, Bronsted analysis, and pH dependence studies employing a range of aryl phosphates clearly indicate a dissociative transition state for the Cdc25A reaction that does not involve a general acid for the hydrolysis of substrates with low leaving group p Ka values (5.45–8.05). Interestingly, our Bronsted analysis and pH dependence studies reveal that Cdc25A employs a different mechanism for the hydrolysis of substrates with high leaving group p Ka values (8.68–9.99) that appears to require the protonation of glutamic acid 431. Mutation of glutamic acid 431 into glutamine leads to a dramatic drop in the hydrolysis rate for the high leaving group p Ka substrates and the disappearance of the basic limb of the pH rate profile for the substrate with a leaving group p Ka of 8.05, indicating that glutamic acid 431 is essential for the efficient hydrolysis of substrates with high leaving group p Ka. We suggest that hydrolysis of the high leaving group p Ka substrates proceeds through an unfavored but more catalytically active form of Cdc25A, and we propose several models illustrating this. Since the activity of Cdc25A toward small molecule substrates is several orders of magnitude lower than toward the physiological substrate, cyclin-CDK, we suggest that the cyclin-CDK is able to preferentially induce this more catalytically active form of Cdc25A for efficient phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine dephosphorylation. Cdc25 phosphatases are dual specificity phosphatases that dephosphorylate and activate cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), thereby effecting the progression from one phase of the cell cycle to the next. Despite its central role in the cell cycle, relatively little is known about the catalytic mechanism of Cdc25.

Cdc25 phosphatases play a critical role in cell cycle progression (1.Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 877-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 2.Hoffmann I.

Progression from one phase of the cell cycle to the next is largely mediated by the rapid phosphorylation of various cellular targets by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 1The abbreviations used are: CDKcyclin-dependent kinasePTPaseprotein-tyrosine phosphatasepNPP4-nitrophenyl phosphateOMFP3-O-methylfluorescein phosphateDIFMUP6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphateMUP4-methylumbelliferyl phosphateDTTdithiothreitolBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine at the phase transitions (12.Morgan D.O.

This, in turn, is triggered by the rapid dephosphorylation of cyclin-CDK complexes on Thr14 and Tyr15 by Cdc25 proteins, which are dual specificity phosphatases (13.Dunphy W.G. Kumagai A.

Humans have three isoforms of Cdc25 termed Cdc25A, Cdc25B, and Cdc25C, and each plays a distinct role in the cell cycle (3.Nilsson I. Hoffmann I. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 2000; 4: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). cyclin-dependent kinase protein-tyrosine phosphatase 4-nitrophenyl phosphate 3-O-methylfluorescein phosphate 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate dithiothreitol 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine Despite what is known about Cdc25's role in the cell cycle, relatively little is known about its catalytic mechanism. Cdc25 is classified as a protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) because it contains the C X5R PTPase signature motif, which characterizes the PTPase superfamily. Enzymes of the PTPase superfamily can be divided into three classes: tyrosine-specific, low molecular weight, and dual specific phosphatases. The dual specific phosphatases can be further split into the VH1-like phosphatases, mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases, kinase-associated phosphatase, and Cdc25 phosphatases based upon sequence comparisons. In previous years, much progress has been made in understanding the mechanism of PTPases. The C X5R motif plays a vital catalytic role in all PTPases. It has been shown that the cysteine residue in this motif functions as a nucleophile, attacking the substrate phosphate atom directly and displacing the leaving group to form a phosphocysteine intermediate (17.Guan K.L.

The arginine in this motif has been shown to be particularly important for transition state stabilization (23.Zhang Z.-Y. Wang Y. Wu L. Fauman E. Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E.

Biochem. 1993; 214: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For Cdc25B, the cysteine and arginine in the PTPase signature motif have been shown by site-directed mutagenesis to be required for catalysis (29.Xu X. Burke S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5118-5124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This suggests that the cysteine and arginine residues in the C X5R motif play the same role in Cdc25 as they do for other PTPases. Apart from the cysteine and arginine residues in the C X5R motif, it is not known whether other residues participate in catalysis for Cdc25. This is in contrast to other PTPases for which a set of conserved, catalytically important residues has been defined, and functions have been determined for each of these residues (21.Zhang Z.-Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 1-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). For example, a conserved acidic residue, the general acid, has been shown to play an important role in catalysis in all PTPases examined to date, including the Yersinia PTPase (30.Zhang Z.-Y. Wang Y. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1624-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), PTP1B (31.Hengge A.C. Sowa G.A. Wu L. Zhang Z.-Y.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4398-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The general acid facilitates catalysis by protonating the leaving group oxygen, thereby neutralizing the negative charge that develops as the phosphate ester bond is broken. This stabilizes the transition state and enhances the rate of catalysis by >1000-fold in the case of the Yersinia PTPase (30.Zhang Z.-Y. Wang Y. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1624-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). This information regarding the identities and functions of catalytically important residues in PTPases is very valuable. One group has used this information to guide structure-based inhibitor design for PTPases in which they were able to design selective PTPase inhibitors by targeting both conserved residues important for catalysis and nonconserved residues important for substrate specificity (39.Iversen L.F. Andersen H.S. Branner S. Mortensen S.B. Peters G.H. Norris K. Olsen O.H. Jeppesen C.B. Lundt B.F. Ripka W. Moller K.B. Moller N.P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10300-10307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In addition, knowing the identity of the general acid has been used to design more highly potent substrate-trapping mutants of PTPases (40.Flint A.J.T. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar,41.Zhang Y.L. Yao Z.J. Sarmiento M. Wu L. Burke Jr., T.R. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34205-34212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and may aid in the identification of physiological substrates of PTPases. Although it is potentially valuable information, the identity of the general acid in Cdc25 is still unknown. As it turns out, performing a sequence alignment of Cdc25 with a template based upon the prototypical PTPases described above does not reveal the catalytically important residues of Cdc25 (42.Eckstein J.W. Beer-Romero P. Berdo I. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cdc25 is somewhat of an outlier among the PTPases. This was revealed by homology modeling (43.Hofmann K. Bucher P. Kajava A.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and x-ray crystallographic studies (44.Fauman E.B. Cogswell J.P. Lovejoy B. Roque W.J. Holmes W. Montana V.G. Piwnica-Worms H. Rink M.J. Saper M.A. Cell. 1998; 93: 617-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 45.Reynolds R.A. Yem A.W. Wolfe C.L. Deibel Jr., M.R. Chidester C.G. Watenpaugh K.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These studies revealed that Cdc25 is structurally much more similar to the sulfur transfer enzyme rhodanese than it is to any other PTPases. Because it is so dissimilar to other PTPases, aside from the role of the cysteine and arginine in the C X5R motif, no obvious conclusions can be drawn about the mechanism of Cdc25 or the identity of Cdc25's catalytically important residues simply based upon previous studies of PTPases. For this reason, we chose to perform a detailed mechanistic analysis of Cdc25A. The main goals of this work are to provide a description of the transition state of the Cdc25A-catalyzed reaction and to determine the role of general acid catalysis and the identity of the general acid in Cdc25A. In the process, we have revealed some unique features of the Cdc25A-catalyzed reaction. The catalytic domain of Cdc25A was expressed and purified based upon the procedure described by Fauman et al. (44.Fauman E.B. Cogswell J.P. Lovejoy B. Roque W.J. Holmes W. Montana V.G. Piwnica-Worms H. Rink M.J. Saper M.A. Cell. 1998; 93: 617-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). A mammalian expression vector containing the full-length human Cdc25A was obtained from Dr. Katsumi Yamashita (Kanazawa University, Japan). The region encoding the catalytic domain of Cdc25A (residues 336–523) was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the vector pCR2.1 using the TA cloning kit from Invitrogen, with a 5′ primer that contained an NheI site followed by an initiating methionine codon and a 3′ primer that contained an EcoRI site followed by a stop codon. The region encoding the catalytic domain was then subcloned into the vector pUC118. The Cdc25A catalytic domain mutants, E431Q, E435Q, F432A, and G437S, were obtained using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene and the appropriate mutagenic primers obtained from the Oligonucleotide Synthesis Facility of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. The sequences of the wild type and mutant Cdc25As were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Using the NheI and EcoRI sites, the catalytic domain was subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pET21a from Novagen. Escherichia coli BL21DE3 cells were transformed with this vector, grown at 37 °C in 1-liter cultures to an OD at 600 nm of 0.6–0.8, and induced to express the catalytic domain of Cdc25A by the addition of 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After induction, the cultures were grown at room temperature for 16 h and then pelleted by centrifugation. Pellets from 1 liter of culture were resuspended in 30 ml of ice-cold 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA (buffer A). The cells were lysed in a French press at 12,000 p.s.i. The lysate was then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 40 min, and supernatant was filtered using a 0.45-μm membrane syringe filter from Pall Gellman Laboratories. The supernatant was then bound at 4 °C to 50 ml of Poros HS-50 resin (PerSeptive Biosystems) that was equilibrated at 4 °C in buffer A. After 20 min, the resin was added to a column and washed with 250 ml of buffer A. The protein was eluted using a 500-ml, 0–0.5 m linear, sodium chloride in buffer A gradient at 4 °C. The fractions containing Cdc25A were concentrated in a Centriprep YM-10 (10,000 molecular weight cut-off) concentrator from Amicon. Gel filtration chromatography (G-50) was then performed in buffer A containing 200 mm sodium chloride, and the protein was concentrated as before. Proteins were judged to be at least 95% pure by SDS-PAGE, and the identity of the Cdc25A wild type catalytic domain was confirmed by N-terminal protein sequencing performed by the Laboratory for Macromolecular Analysis and Proteomics of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. We routinely obtained 30–50 mg of protein/liter of culture. The Cdc25A mutants were purified identically except that E431Q and E435Q required a 0–0.75 m linear sodium chloride gradient for elution during the ion exchange chromatography step. Also, the yields of the E431Q mutant were significantly lower, since much of it seemed to reside in the pellet fraction. The substrates 4-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP), 3-O-methylfluorescein phosphate, 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate, β-naphthyl acid phosphate, and phenyl phosphate were obtained from Sigma. 6,8-Difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Other aryl phosphates, 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl phosphate, 4-acetylphenyl phosphate, 4-trifluoromethylphenyl phosphate, 4-chlorophenyl phosphate, and 4-fluorophenyl phosphate were synthesized according to Hall and Williams (46.Hall A.D. Williams A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4784-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl phosphate was obtained at 37% purity, with inorganic phosphate as the major impurity judging by the full hydrolysis of the substrate using Yersinia PTPase or Cdc25A catalytic domain and the inorganic phosphate assay described below. Appropriate corrections were made when preparing solutions of this substrate, and the impurities did not interfere with the phosphatase assays. All other substrates were at least 95% pure. All assays were performed at 30 °C. The following buffers were used: 100 mm succinate (pH 5.4–5.8), 50 mm 3,3-dimethylglutarate (pH 5.8–7.2), and Tricine (pH 7.2–8.8). In addition, each buffer also contained 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT and was adjusted to an ionic strength of 150 mm with sodium chloride. Assay mixtures of 100-μl total volume were set up in 1.1-ml polypropylene tubes from Marsh Biomedical. Reactions were started by the addition of an appropriate amount of enzyme (2–10 μm). For the substrates 4-acetylphenyl phosphate, 4-trifluoromethyl phenyl phosphate, 4-chlorophenyl phosphate, 4-fluorophenyl phosphate, 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate, β-naphthyl phosphate, and phenyl phosphate, the reaction mixture was quenched with 50 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the amount of inorganic phosphate released was quantitated based on the method of Black and Jones (47.Black M.J. Jones M.E. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 135: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The only differences were that 100 μl of the ammonium molybdate/ascorbic acid solution was added to each quenched reaction mixture followed 2–5 min later by 200 μl of the citrate/arsenite solution. 200 μl of each reaction mixture was then transferred to a 96-well plate, where the absorbance at 700 nm was read using a Spectra Max 340 plate reader from Molecular Devices. Since some of these substrates are only soluble to 5–10 mm, sufficient substrate could not be added to saturate Cdc25A. Therefore, kcat/Km values were determined by employing a series of assay solutions containing a range of substrate concentrations (0.3–1.7 mm) well below the Km. The kcat/Km values were obtained from a linear least square fit of the plot of absorbance versus substrate concentration and using the appropriate form of the Michaelis-Menten equation, v=kcat[E][S]/KmEquation 1 where v represents the initial rate and [E] is the total enzyme concentration. The substrates 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl phosphate and pNPP were assayed similarly except that the reaction mixtures were quenched with 100 μl of 2 m sodium hydroxide. 150 μl of each mixture was then transferred to a 96-well plate, where the absorbance at 405 nm was read in a plate reader. In addition, both of these compounds were sufficiently soluble such that concentrations encompassing the Km value of Cdc25A could be prepared, and the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 2) was used to determine both kcat and Km. The initial rate versus substrate concentration could be fit directly to the equation, v=kcat[E][S]/(Km+[S])Equation 2 where v represents the initial rate, [E] is the total enzyme concentration, and [S] is the initial substrate concentration using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software). For the substrates 3-O-methylfluorescein phosphate (OMFP) and 6,8-difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DIFMUP), continuous assays were performed. In both cases, 1-ml reaction volumes were set up in 1-ml quartz cuvettes. The cuvettes were placed in the temperature-controlled holder of the spectrophotometer or fluorimeter and allowed to equilibrate to 30 °C before an appropriate amount of enzyme was added to initiate the reaction. For OMFP, 100 μm OMFP was used, and the absorbance was monitored at 400 nm over the entire reaction time course in a PerkinElmer Lambda 14 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Both the kcat and Km values were obtained by a nonlinear least squares fit to Equation 3 as described previously (48.Zhang Z.-Y. Maclean D. Thieme-Sefler A.M. Roeske R.M. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), t=[P]/kcat[E]+(Km/kcat[E])ln([S]0/([S]0−[P]))Equation 3 where [S]0 represents the initial substrate concentration, while [P] is the product concentration at time t. For DIFMUP, 0.5 μm substrate was used, and the fluorescence of the product was monitored at 450 nm using an excitation of 380 nm in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 50 B Luminescence spectrometer. The kcat/Kmvalue was obtained by nonlinear least square fit to Equation 4, [P]=[S]0(1−exp(−kcat[E]t/Km))Equation 4 where [S]0 represents the initial substrate concentration, while [P] is the product concentration at time t. The leaving group dependence studies were performed at pH 7.0. The log(kcat/Km) value was plotted against leaving group p Ka value for the one-ringed aryl phosphate substrates. The βlg value was obtained as the slope of the linear least squares fit to the data. For the wild type Cdc25A in which there was a distinct kink in the leaving group dependence, the data from p Ka 5.45 to 8.05 was fit separately from the data from p Ka 8.68 to 9.99. The kcat/Km values were plotted as a function of pH for several substrates. The second ionization constants (p KS2) of 5.00 ± 0.01, 5.24 ± 0.01, 5.52 ± 0.01, and 5.72 ± 0.02 were obtained, by titration, for the substrates pNPP, 4-acetylphenyl phosphate, 4-chlorophenyl phosphate, and phenyl phosphate, respectively. To fit the kcat/Km versus pH data, one of two equations was used, kcat/Km=(kcat/Km)max/(1+H/KS2+H/KE1)Equation 5 kcat/Km=(kcat/Km)max/((1+H/KS2)(1+H/KE1+KE2/H))Equation 6 where (kcat/Km)max is the highest theoretical value of kcat/Km, H is the proton concentration, KS2 is the second ionization constant of the substrate, and KE1 and KE2 are the ionization constants of the enzyme. For the wild-type Cdc25A using the substrates 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl phosphate and pNPP and for the E431Q mutant in all cases, Equation 5 was used. For the wild-type enzyme using the substrates 4-chlorophenyl phosphate and phenyl phosphate, Equation 6 was used, where pKE1 was fixed at 5.5 based on the average of the values obtained for p KE1 for wild-type Cdc25A with 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl phosphate and pNPP. In all cases, the second ionization constant of the substrate was fixed using the p Ka values determined from the titration experiments. Bovine alkaline phosphatase, type 1-S from Sigma, was used as received. Ethyl ether was distilled from alumina. Natural abundance p-nitrophenyl phosphate, [14N]p-nitrophenyl phosphate, [15N,nonbridge-18O3]p-nitrophenyl phosphate, [14N]p-nitrophenol, and [15N,18O]p-nitrophenol were synthesized as described previously (49.Hengge A.C. Edens W.A. Elsing H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 5045-5049Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). [14N]p-Nitrophenol and [15N,18O]p-nitrophenol were then mixed to reconstitute the natural abundance of 15N, and then the mixture was phosphorylated to produce p-nitrophenyl phosphate using the same method as referred to above. This mixture was used for determination of 18(V/K)bridge. The [14N]p-nitrophenyl phosphate and [15N,nonbridge-18O3]p-nitrophenyl phosphate were also mixed to reconstitute the natural abundance of15N. This mixture was used for determination of18(V/K)nonbridge. The isotopic abundance of the mixtures was determined by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Isotope effect determinations were made at 30 °C, in either 500 mm Tricine buffer (pH 7.2) or 250 mm BisTris buffer (pH 6.1), containing 1 mm DTT. The buffer was degassed by bubbling nitrogen through it for 30 min before initiating experiments. The protocols for carrying out these experiments were the same as those previously described (25.Hoff R.H. Wu L. Zhou B. Zhang Z.-Y. Hengge A.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9514-9521Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The enzymatic reactions were performed in triplicate and allowed to proceed to fractions of reaction ranging from 33 to 65% and stopped by titration to pH 4. The reaction solutions were then extracted three times with an equivalent volume of ethyl ether to quantitatively remove the p-nitrophenol product. The aqueous fractions containing unreacted pNPP were titrated to pH 9.0 and treated with excess alkaline phosphatase overnight to hydrolyze the remaining pNPP. The nitrophenol thus released was isolated as described above. The nitrophenol samples were purified by sublimation and analyzed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Isotopic analyses were performed using an ANCA-NT combustion system in tandem with a Europa 20–20 isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Reactions were begun with 100 μmol or more of the substrate and sufficient enzyme so that the background hydrolysis rate was negligible compared with the enzymatic reaction. Parallel experiments without enzyme were used to establish background hydrolysis rates under the experimental conditions. Isotope effects were calculated from the isotopic ratio in the p-nitrophenol product at partial reaction (Rp), in the residual substrate (Rs), and in the starting material (Ro). Equations 1 and 2 were used to calculate the observed isotope effect either from Rp and Ro or from Rs and Ro, respectively at fraction of reaction f (50.Bigeleisen J. Wolfsberg M. Adv. Chem. Phys. 1958; 1: 15-76Google Scholar). Thus, each experiment yields two independent determinations of the isotope effect. Isotope effect=log(1−f)/log(1−f(Rp/Ro))Equation 7 Isotope effect=log(1−f)/log((1−f)(Rs/Ro))Equation 8 RO was determined separately from unreacted substrate by isotope ratio mass spectroscopic analysis and, as a control, from p-nitrophenol isolated after complete hydrolysis of substrate using the isolation and purification procedures used in the isotope effect experiments. The agreement of these two numbers demonstrated that, within experimental error, no isotopic fractionation occurs as a result of the procedures used to isolate and purify the p-nitrophenol.

https://openalex.org/W1998785989,"DNA repair by photolyase (photoreactivation) and nucleotide excision repair (NER) are the major pathways to remove UV-induced cyclobutane-pyrimidine dimers (CPDs). The nucleolus is a nuclear subcompartment containing the ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) of which a fraction is transcribed by RNA polymerase I (RNAP-I), and the rest is silenced. Here yeast was used to investigate how photoreactivation and NER contribute to repair of active and inactive rDNA. Cells were irradiated with UV light and exposed to different repair conditions. Nuclei were isolated, and the active genes were separated from the inactive genes by restriction endonuclease digestion. CPDs were measured in total rDNA, in both fractions, and in the GAL10 gene. Repair in rDNA was as efficient as in GAL10 indicating that both pathways have unrestricted access to the nucleolus. Photoreactivation was much faster than NER and therefore was the predominant repair pathway. Active genes were faster repaired by photolyase than were silenced genes providing evidence for an open chromatin structure during repair. The transcribed strands of active genes, but not of inactive genes, were slightly faster repaired by NER providing evidence for transcription-coupled repair by RNAP-I. There was no pronounced inhibition of photoreactivation by RNAP-I in the transcribed strand, which is in contrast to genes transcribed by RNAP-II and suggests different stabilities of RNAP-I and RNAP-II stalled at CPDs.

Repair of DNA lesions is essential to prevent mutations, cell death, or cancer (1.Hoeijmakers J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (3114) Google Scholar). Since packaging of eukaryotic DNA in nucleosomes and higher order chromatin structures restricts DNA accessibility, all DNA-dependent processes including repair and transcription are mutually affected by structural and dynamic properties of chromatin (2.Thoma F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6585-6598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Smerdon M.J. Conconi A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 227-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 4.Moggs J.G.

Here we investigated how two different repair mechanisms, photoreactivation and nucleotide excision repair (NER), 1The abbreviations used are: NERnucleotide excision repairCPDcyclobutane-pyrimidine dimerrDNAribosomal DNARNAPRNA polymerase6-4PPpyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproductMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidIRFintact restriction fragmentsslow (active)ffast (inactive) 1The abbreviations used are: NERnucleotide excision repairCPDcyclobutane-pyrimidine dimerrDNAribosomal DNARNAPRNA polymerase6-4PPpyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproductMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidIRFintact restriction fragmentsslow (active)ffast (inactive) find access to ribosomal DNA and repair UV lesions in the nucleolus of yeast cells.NER and photoreactivation are the major pathways to remove UV-induced DNA lesions, cis-syn cyclobutane-pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), and pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts (6-4PPs) (5.Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Photoreactivation is a direct repair mechanism where a damage-specific enzyme (photolyase) reverts CPDs in a light-dependent reaction. Photolyases are found in many prokaryotes and eukaryotes, including yeast (5.Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 6.Sancar A. Science. 1996; 272: 48-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 7.Yasui A. Eker A.P. Yasuhira S. Yajima H. Kobayashi T. Takao M. Oikawa A.

Photoreactivation in yeast cells is modulated by chromatin structure and transcription (2.Thoma F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6585-6598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Photolyase is fast in nucleosome-free regions and slow in nucleosomes and therefore is an ideal molecular tool to investigate DNA accessibility in chromatin of living cells (9.Suter B. Livingstone Z.M. Thoma F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2150-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 10.Suter B. Schnappauf G. Thoma F.

There is preferential repair of the nontranscribed strands in genes transcribed by RNAP-II and RNAP-III, whereas photoreactivation of the transcribed strands is partially inhibited by RNAP-II and RNAP-III blocked at CPDs (9.Suter B. Livingstone Z.M. Thoma F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2150-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 12.Aboussekhra A. Thoma F.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3795-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).In contrast to photolyase, NER is a multistep mechanism that removes a large range of DNA lesions including CPDs and 6-4PPs (5.Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). NER is divided in two subpathways, global genome repair and transcription-coupled repair (1.Hoeijmakers J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (3114) Google Scholar, 14.Petit C.

Global genome repair refers to repair in nontranscribed parts of the genome and is modulated by nucleosomes (17.Wellinger R.E. Thoma F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5046-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 18.Tijsterman M. de Pril R. Tasseron-de Jong J.G. Brouwer J. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2060-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 12.Aboussekhra A. Thoma F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 19.Tu Y.

Transcription-coupled repair refers to preferential repair of the transcribed strand, an observation that was originally made in mammalian and hamster cells (21.Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar) and later in many more organisms including yeast (22.Smerdon M.J. Thoma F. Cell. 1990; 61: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 23.Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10696-10700Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). RNAP-II stalled at a DNA lesion may serve as a damage recognition enzyme and promote NER (1.Hoeijmakers J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (3114) Google Scholar, 16.Tornaletti S. Hanawalt P.C. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Transcription-coupled repair was found in genes transcribed by RNAP-II, while genes transcribed by RNAP-III lack transcription-coupled repair in mammalian cells (24.Dammann R. Pfeifer G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and show a slight inhibition of NER on the transcribed strand in yeast (12.Aboussekhra A. Thoma F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).The nucleolus is a subcompartment of the nucleus specialized in biosynthesis of ribosomes, a dense, protein crowded factory of transcription, RNA-processing and ribosome assembly (25.Carmo-Fonseca M. Mendes-Soares L. Campos I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E107-E112Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). It harbors the clusters of rRNA genes (rDNA) coding for the large ribosomal RNA transcripts. rDNA is transcribed by RNAP-I, but only a fraction of the genes is active. Active genes are free of nucleosomes, while silenced genes maintain nucleosomes (26.Conconi A. Widmer R.M. Koller T. Sogo J.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 753-761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 27.Dammann R. Lucchini R. Koller T. Sogo J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2331-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 28.Lucchini R. Sogo J.M. Paule M.R. Transcription of Ribosomal RNA Genes by Eukaryotic RNA Polymerase I. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1998: 255-276Google Scholar). Repair of UV lesions in ribosomal genes is still not clear. Removal of CPDs by NER was absent in rodent cells and inefficient in human cells (29.Christians F.C. Hanawalt P.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10512-10518Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 30.Fritz L.K. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13117-13124Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 31.Christians F.C. Hanawalt P.C. Mutat. Res. 1994; 323: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). 6-4PPs, however, were efficiently repaired (32.Balajee A.S. May A. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2511-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). NER of mammalian rDNA showed no strand bias and appears therefore not to be coupled to RNAP-I transcription (29.Christians F.C. Hanawalt P.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10512-10518Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,30.Fritz L.K. Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13117-13124Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Repair of rDNA in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is different. First, CPDs are efficiently removed by NER. Second, experiments with mutants that compromise global genome repair revealed preferential repair of the transcribed strand and suggested that TC NER may exist in rDNA transcribed by RNAP-I (33.Verhage R.A. Van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1020-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Since that study analyzed the total rDNA population and did not discriminate between actively transcribed and silenced genes, it remains open whether the strand bias is related to transcription. In contrast to NER, photoreactivation or the combination of photoreactivation and NER were never investigated in the nucleolus.Here we have investigated repair of UV lesions by both pathways in total rDNA as well as in the separated active and inactive rRNA genes. We found that photoreactivation is the predominant pathway for CPD repair in all situations. Moreover, we noticed that preferential repair of the transcribed strand by NER is restricted to the active rRNA genes thus supporting transcription-coupled repair. In addition, we observed structural changes in chromatin following damage induction and repair, but the active genes remained in a relatively open conformation.MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast StrainsS. cerevisiae W303.1a (Mata, ade2-1, ura3-1, his3-11, 15, trp1-1, leu2-3, 112, can1-100) was kindly provided by Dr. R. Sternglanz. AMY3 (Mata, ade2-1, ura3-1, his3-11, 15, trp1-1, leu2-3, 112, can1-100 rad1::URA3) was generated by deletion of part of the RAD1 gene in W303.1a using construct pR1.6 (kindly provided by Dr. L. Prakash). AMY3 exhibits a strong UV sensitivity typical for rad1 strains.UV Irradiation and RepairUV irradiation and repair of DNA was done as described previously (34.Suter B. Livingstone-Zatchej M. Thoma F. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 447-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Yeast cultures were grown at 30 °C in YPD (1% Bacto yeast extract, 1% Bacto peptone, 2% dextrose) (35.Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Laboratory Course Manual for Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar) to a density of about 0.5 × 107cells/ml. Cells were harvested and resuspended in SD minimal medium (2% dextrose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids) to about 3 × 107 cells/ml. 4-mm-deep suspensions were irradiated with UV light using Sylvania G15T8 germicidal lamps (predominantly at 254 nm) at a dose of 150 J/m2 (measured by a UVX radiometer, UVP Inc., San Gabriel, CA). After irradiation, the medium was supplemented with appropriate amino acids and uracil. For photoreactivation, the cell suspension was exposed to photoreactivating light (Sylvania type F15 T8/BLB bulbs, peak emission at 375 nm) at ∼1.3 milliwatts/cm2 (measured by a UVX radiometer (UVP Inc.) with a 365 nm photocell) for 7–120 min at 24–26 °C. During incubation, the cells were repeatedly resuspended. NER samples were incubated at 24–26 °C in the dark. 100-ml samples were collected at different repair times and chilled on ice. All further steps until lysis of cells were performed in yellow safety light.Fractionation of Active and Inactive rDNAYeast nuclei were liberated by glass bead isolation according to Muller et al.(36.Muller M. Lucchini R. Sogo J.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 767-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 ml of cells (3 × 107 cells/ml) were harvested, resuspended in cold water, and resuspended in 2 ml of cold NIB (nuclear isolation buffer: 17% glycerol, 50 mmMOPS, 150 mm potassium acetate, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.15 mmspermine, all adjusted to pH 7.2). The suspension was vortexed with 2 ml of glass beads (diameter, 0.5 mm; acid washed and equilibrated in NIB) until about 90% of the cells were broken (checked under light microscope for loss of contrast of broken cells). The nuclear extract was pelleted (10 min, 4 °C, 4500 ×g) and resuspended in 2 ml of restriction buffer (33 mm Tris acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 66 mm potassium acetate, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.9). Aliquots of 1.5 × 109 cells were digested with 160 units of NheI (AGS, Heidelberg, Germany) at 37 °C for 1 h to release the active ribosomal genes. No NER activity was observed during incubation of the extract at 37 °C (data not shown). Genomic DNA was extracted following the Yeast DNA Isolation Protocol (Qiagen Genomic DNA Handbook, 1999) and electrophoresed at 4 °C on 0.8% low melting agarose gels (SeaPlaque agarose, FMC BioProducts), and the fragments corresponding to active (4.4 kb) and inactive rDNA (>9.1kb) were purified according to the AgarACE protocol (Promega). The fractions were redigested with NheI (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and purified by phenol extraction, and CPDs were analyzed.Psoralen Cross-linking and Gel Retardation AssaysThese assays were adopted from Muller et al. (36.Muller M. Lucchini R. Sogo J.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 767-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). NheI-digested yeast nuclei of 2–4 × 108cells were centrifuged (8 min at 3400 × g, 4 °C) and resuspended in 300 μl of NIB. The suspension was transferred to wells of a multiwell dish (diameter, 1.6 cm) and placed on ice. 15 μl of 4,5′,8-trimethylpsoralen (Sigma, 200 μg/ml in ethanol) were added. After 5 min of incubation in the dark, the cells were irradiated on ice for 15 min (Sylvania, Type F15 T8/BLB bulbs, peak emission at 375 nm) at an average flux of about 24 J/m2 s. This procedure was repeated four times. The cross-linked nuclear extract was pelleted and resuspended in 400 μl of TNE (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl). 40 μl of 16.5% sarcosyl (Sigma) and 30 μl of Proteinase K (10 mg/ml) were added and incubated for 2.5 h at 50 °C. After centrifugation for 5 min at 5000 rpm, the DNA was purified by phenol extraction and resuspended in 300 μl of TNE. After digestion with 10 μl of RNase A (10 mg/ml) for 20 min at 37 °C, the DNA was phenol-extracted and resuspended in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. The DNA was digested with BamHI or NheI and separated on 1% agarose gels in 40 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.114% acetic acid, 1 mm EDTA for 20 h at 64 V. The psoralen cross-links were reversed by irradiation with 254 nm light (about 30 J/m2 s) for 12 min, and the DNA was depurinated in 0.25n HCl for 12 min, blotted to Zeta GT nylon membranes, and hybridized with radioactive probes according a protocol from Bio-Rad.CPD AnalysisCPDs were analyzed by indirect end labeling (22.Smerdon M.J. Thoma F. Cell. 1990; 61: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) in the 4.4-kb rDNA fragment (DNA cut with NheI) and in the 1.6-kb GAL10 fragment (DNA cut with EcoRI/SalI). Aliquots of DNA were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with T4 endonuclease V (Epicentre) in 50 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, or mock-treated with the same buffer. The DNA was electrophoresed on 1.5% alkaline agarose gels, blotted to Zeta GT nylon membranes, and hybridized with radioactively labeled strand-specific DNA probes that abut the restriction site (34.Suter B. Livingstone-Zatchej M. Thoma F. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 447-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).Radioactive ProbesDNA fragments for generation of radioactive probes were generated by whole cell PCR. The oligonucleotides used for the 387-bp rDNA probe contained 5′-AGTTCCTCTAAATGACCAAGT-3′ (top strand) and 5′-AGTTCCTCTAAATGACCAAGT-3′ (bottom strand). The oligonucleotides used for the 225-bp GAL10 probe contained 5′-CGCACCATAATCTCCGTACCCTCAATAG-3′ (top strand) and 5′-CCGCCGAGTACATGCTGATAGATAATGA-3′ (bottom strand). Strand-specific probes were generated by primer extension with one oligonucleotide for each strand using Qiagen Taq polymerase. Probes for both strands were generated by random priming using the oligolabeling kit (Amersham Biosciences).QuantificationsThe signal on the membranes was quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). In each lane, the signal in the intact restriction fragment (IRF) was measured and divided by the signal of the whole lane to give a signal normalized with respect to the overall DNA content in that lane. CPD content was calculated using the Poisson expression (21.Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar): −ln(IRF (+T4)/IRF (−T4)). Initial damage (0 min repair) was set to 0% repair.RESULTSWe used the yeast strains AMY3 (rad1Δ) with an inactivated NER to analyze photoreactivation and W303.1a for analysis of NER and NER with photoreactivation. Cells were grown in YPD, irradiated with 150 J/m2 in minimal medium containing glucose, and exposed to photoreactivating light for up to 2 h in minimal medium supplemented with the appropriate amino acids. For NER, the cultures were incubated in the dark. Since photoreactivation is a very fast process, photoreactivation and NER were done at 24–26 °C and not at 30 °C. To investigate repair of the total rDNA cluster, DNA was isolated and cut with NheI, which generates a 4.4-kb fragment of the transcribed region and a 4.7-kb fragment containing the 5′-end of the rRNA gene and the spacer (Fig. 1A). To detect the CPDs, the DNA was cut with T4 endonuclease V at CPDs, fractionated by alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis, blotted to a nylon membrane, and hybridized to strand-specific probes abutting from the NheI site (black bar, Fig. 1A). This indirect end-labeling technique allows the mapping of CPDs along the DNA sequence and the measurement of the fraction of undamaged restriction fragments (9.Suter B. Livingstone Z.M. Thoma F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2150-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17.Wellinger R.E. Thoma F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5046-5056Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 22.Smerdon M.J. Thoma F.

Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 447-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar).A set of data is shown for AMY3 (rad1Δ) and W303.1a (RAD1) (Fig. 1, B and C). Nonirradiated DNA (−UV) and DNA not treated with T4 endonuclease V (−T4) show the intact restriction fragment (4.4 kb, top band). Treatment of damaged DNA with T4 endonuclease V generated a smear with some bands, which represent the distribution of pyrimidine clusters (+UV, +T4). The CPD patterns are different in the nontranscribed strand and the transcribed strand demonstrating strand specificity of the assay. The top band (4.4 kb) represents the fraction of undamaged DNA. The initial damage was on average 0.17 ± 0.03 CPDs/kb in the nontranscribed strand and 0.2 ± 0.04 CPDs/kb in the transcribed strand probably reflecting a difference in the pyrimidine distribution. The relative low levels of CPDs/kb generated by 150 J/m2 was due to the irradiation of cells in SD medium. According to the Poisson distribution, ∼75% of the genes contained one or more transcription-blocking CPDs in the transcribed strand (6.6 kb).Photoreactivation Is the Predominant Pathway to Remove CPDs from the NucleolusRepair of CPDs is visualized by a time-dependent decrease of the CPD bands and an increase of the intact 4.4-kb restriction fragment (Fig. 1, B and C). The removal of CPDs was homogenous. There are no sites that were resistant to repair. DNA repair of the whole 4.4-kb fragment was quantified, and the average of three independent experiments is displayed in Fig. 1D. AMY3 (rad1Δ) revealed very efficient repair by photolyase on both strands. About 50% of the lesions were removed by exposing cells to photoreactivating light for 15 min, and more than 80% of the lesions were removed in 2 h. No repair was observed when cells were kept in the dark demonstrating that the NER pathway was inactivated. Repair in the NER-proficient strain W303.1a showed slow removal of CPDs by NER when cells were incubated in the dark. A substantial fraction of lesions (about 60%) remained unrepaired after 2 h. Please note that NER was slow since the experiments were done at low temperature (24–26 °C). In contrast, exposure of those cells to photoreactivating light showed that the combination of NER and photoreactivation very rapidly removed CPDs. 50% of the lesions were repaired in less than 15 min. This experiment demonstrates that both pathways repair CPDs in the nucleolus, but photoreactivation is the predominant pathway under the light conditions applied in those experiments.A Strand Bias of NER Indicates Transcription-coupled Repair in rDNAIt was previously reported that the transcribed strand of total rDNA was slightly faster repaired than the nontranscribed strand suggesting transcription-coupled NER (33.Verhage R.A. Van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1020-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Consistent with that report, we observed preferential repair of the transcribed strand by NER as well (Fig. 1D). The difference between the two strands is small compared with the strand bias observed in genes transcribed by RNAP-II (13.Livingstone-Zatchej M. Meier A. Suter B. Thoma F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3795-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This might reflect either a small number of active genes in the rDNA population, or transcription-coupled repair might be less pronounced compared with RNAP-II-transcribed genes. To address this topic, we investigated repair in active and inactive fractions separately.Isolation of DNA from Active and Inactive rDNAPsoralen cross-linking and nuclease digestion studies have established that actively transcribed rDNA is devoid of nucleosomes, while inactive genes are packaged in nucleosomes (27.Dammann R. Lucchini R. Koller T. Sogo J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2331-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 28.Lucchini R. Sogo J.M. Paule M.R.

Biol. 1995; 15: 5294-5303Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It was further shown that restriction enzymes such as NheI efficiently cut in active rRNA genes of yeast but not in the inactive nucleosomal genes (36.Muller M. Lucchini R. Sogo J.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 767-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We used this approach to purify DNA fragments of active genes for repair analysis. Yeast cells were UV-irradiated and incubated for repair as described above. Nuclei were isolated and digested with NheI, which liberates a 4.4-kb fragment of active rDNA (Fig. 2A). The DNA of NheI-digested nuclei was purified and fractionated in neutral agarose gels, and the rDNA fragments were identified after blotting using an rDNA probe, which hybridized to the 4.4-kb NheI fragment (Fig. 2B). The DNA originating from inactive genes, which were resistant to NheI digestion, showed up as long DNA fragments (>9.1 kb, inactive fraction of rDNA). The 9.1-kb fragment was a partial digest of two adjacent active genes and was not further used for repair analysis. The fraction of active genes that was released by NheI is represented by the 4.4-kb band.Figure 2Separation of active and inactive rRNA genes after damage induction and repair. A, three units of rDNA are shown schematically. Active genes are transcribed by RNAP-I and free of nucleosomes; inactive genes and the spacer are packaged in nucleosomes (circles). Active genes are efficiently cut by NheI in nuclei to release a 4.4-kb chromatin fragment. Inactive genes are resistant to NheI digestion (36.Muller M. Lucchini R. Sogo J.M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 767-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). B, nuclei were digested with NheI, the DNA was purified, and the fragments were identified by Southern blotting using the rDNA probe (black bar in A). 4.4-kb band represents the released rDNA of active genes, the 9.1-kb band originates from a partial digest of two active genes, and fragments longer than 9.1 kb contain the inactive genes. Lane 1, genomic DNA cut with NheI; lane 2, DNA of NheI-digested nuclei of AMY3.

PR, photoreactivation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Altered Chromatin Accessibility Induced by UV Irradiation and RepairIf UV lesions block transcription elongation of RNAP-I, one might expect that inactivation could lead to a reformation of nucleosomes in rDNA and make it less accessible to restriction enzymes. We therefore measured the fraction of 4.4-kb fragments released by NheI during the repair experiments. In unirradiated cells, this fraction was about 20% of total rDNA (Fig. 2C, −UV). After UV irradiation, the fraction decreased indicating that UV-irradiated chromatin became less accessible to the restriction endonuclease (0 min repair). The decrease was only about 25%, although ∼75% of the genes received at least one transcription-blocking CPD in the transcribed strand. Thus, damage induction in transcribed genes altered the structure of some genes but was not sufficient to generate a chromatin structure that was as resistant to nuclease digestion as inactive nucleosomal rDNA. Hence, a large fraction of the active genes remained in a partially open chromatin conformation.In W303.1a, which is proficient in NER and photoreactivation, the fraction of released genes increased with increasing repair times in the presence and absence of photoreactivating light (Fig. 2C). However, in the NER-deficient AMY3 cells no increase of the released fraction was observed during exposure to photoreactivating light. The effects were small, but they were observed in all three independent experiments. Thus, the increased release in W303.1a cells suggests that some rRNA genes may open chromatin either as a consequence of repair within the gene or as a consequence of repair in other genes (see “Discussion”). Since yeast photolyase in contrast to NER does not repair 6-4PPs, the increased accessibility to NheI might depend on removal of that photoproduct.NheI Digestion of Nuclei Releases Only Open and Active rDNAActive genes with an open chromatin structure bind more psoralen than nucleosomal ina"

Doubling the unesterified cholesterol content of the plasma membrane by incubation for 24 h with low density lipoprotein and lipid/cholesterol dispersions increases the pools of PL and cholesterol available for removal by apoA-I from about 0.8–5%; the initial rates of mass release of cholesterol and PL are both increased about 6-fold. Expression of the ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) is critical for this increased efflux of lipids, and cholesterol loading of the fibroblasts over 24 h increases ABCA1 mRNA about 12-fold. The presence of more ABCA1 and cholesterol in the plasma membrane results in a 2-fold increase in the level of specific binding of apoA-I to the cells with no change in binding affinity. Characterization of the species released from either control or cholesterol-enriched cells indicates that the plasma membrane domains from which lipids are removed are cholesterol-enriched with respect to the average plasma membrane composition. Cholesterol enrichment of fibroblasts also affects PL synthesis, and this leads to enhanced release of phosphatidylcholine (PC) relative to sphingomyelin (SM); the ratios of PC to SM solubilized from control and cholesterol-enriched fibroblasts are ∼2/1 and 5/1, respectively. Biosynthesis of PC is critical for this preferential release of PC and the enhanced cholesterol efflux because inhibition of PC synthesis by choline depletion reduces cholesterol efflux from cholesterol-enriched cells. Overall, it is clear that enrichment of fibroblasts with unesterified cholesterol enhances efflux of cholesterol and PL to apoA-I because of three effects, 1) increased PC biosynthesis, 2) increased PC transport via ABCA1, and 3) increased cholesterol in the plasma membrane.

HDL and its main protein moiety, apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, drive the initial unesterified (free) cholesterol (FC) efflux from the periphery as well as the subsequent esterification of the cholesterol by lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (2.Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Oram J.F. Yokoyama S. J.

HDL comprises a very heterogeneous class of particles, particularly with respect to the particle size, density, protein content, and surface charge; the structure of the particles affects their efficiency in participating in the various steps of the reverse cholesterol transport pathway (1.Barter P.J.

Fully lipidated apoA-I or mature HDL species have been established to mediate this process through passive diffusion. In this aspect of FC efflux, FC molecules spontaneously desorb from the plasma membrane, diffuse through the aqueous phase surrounding the cell, and incorporate into an HDL particle upon collision. This so-called aqueous diffusion mechanism has been extensively described in the literature (for a review, see Ref. 7.Phillips M.C. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 906: 223-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). This simple diffusion process can be facilitated by the presence of scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-B1) in the plasma membrane of the cell (8.Rothblat G.H. de la Llera-Moya M. Atger V. Kellner-Weibel G. Williams D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 781-796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoA-I molecules that have dissociated from HDL particles and exist in a lipid-free (poor) state (9.Barter P.J. Rye K. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1996; 7: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) mediate cellular phospholipid (PL) and FC efflux by an active mechanism involving interaction of apoA-I with the cell surface (3.Oram J.F. Yokoyama S. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2473-2491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Yokoyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1392: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The resulting protein-lipid complexes enlarge in size through the further incorporation of lipids and interaction with lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase as they progress through the reverse cholesterol transport pathway (2.Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The efflux of cellular lipids to incompletely lipidated apoA-I molecules is a critical pathway for supply of PL to the HDL pool. Recent studies of Tangier disease have shown that mutations that inactivate the ATP binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1) are the cause of the low HDL levels in this disease (for a review, see Ref. 11.Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1173-1179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ABCA1 is critical for efflux of cellular PL and FC to apoA-I because FC-loaded Tangier disease fibroblasts are defective in this regard (12.Oram J.F. Vaughan A.M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). This behavior is in striking contrast to that of normal human fibroblasts, which exhibit significant stimulation of FC and PL efflux when FC-loaded (13.Bielicki J.K. Johnson W.J. Weinberg R.B.

Invest. 1999; 104: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The above observations are consistent with a key role for ABCA1 in PL and FC efflux because expression of ABCA1 in fibroblasts is up-regulated by cholesterol loading (15.Lawn R.M. Wade D.P.

Expression of ABCA1 can be regulated by ligands for the nuclear receptor LXR (17.Venkateswaran A. Laffitte B.A. Joseph S.B. Mak P.A. Wilpitz D.C. Edwards P.A. Tontonoz P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The appearance of the transporter at the cell surface enhances apoA-I binding and efflux of cellular PL and FC (18.Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11092-11099Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Comparison of different cell types indicates that there is a general correlation between expression of ABCA1 and lipid efflux to apoA-I (21.Bortnick A.E. Rothblat G.H. Stoudt G. Hoppe K.L. Royer L.J. McNeish J. Francone O.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28634-28640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). ABCA1 is likely to be involved in PL and FC transport to the cell surface because related transporters translocate PL molecules across membranes (22.Smit J.J. Schinkel A.H. Oude E. Groen A.K. Wagenaar E. van Deemter L. Mol C.A. Ottenhoff R. van der Lugt N.M. van Roon M.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 451-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). However, FC loading of cells up-regulates expression of other proteins likely to modulate lipid flux within cells. Thus, caveolin mRNA levels are up-regulated by FC loading of fibroblasts, and the rate of FC efflux is proportional to the caveolin mRNA levels (23.Fielding C.J. Bist A. Fielding P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3753-3758Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Likewise, FC loading of macrophages and fibroblasts stimulates phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthesis and up-regulation of CTP:phosphocholine cytidyltransferase (24.Tabas I. Marathe S. Keesler G.A. Beatini N. Shiratori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22773-22781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 25.Leppimaki P. Mattinen J. Slotte J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6385-6394Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Active trafficking of lipid vesicles between the plasma membrane and the cell interior is critical because disruption of Golgi membranes by agents such as brefeldin (26.Mendez A.J. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1807-1821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Remaley A.T. Schumacher U.K. Stonik J.A. Farsi B.D. Nazih H. Brewer H.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

A. 1999; 96: 11358-11363Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) inhibits apoA-I-mediated FC and PL efflux. In sum, it seems clear that a continuing supply of PL and FC to the exofacial leaflet of the plasma membrane is required for efficient efflux to apoA-I. In prior studies (6.Gillotte K.L. Davidson W.S. Lund-Katz S. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1918-1928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using human skin fibroblasts containing normal levels of FC, we examined the kinetics of efflux of cellular FC and PL to lipid-free apoA-I (pre-β-HDL). It was shown that in a 10-min incubation FC and PL are released together and that a finite pool of about 1% of plasma membrane cholesterol is available. This process was termed membrane microsolubilization and defined as follows. “This process involves apolipoprotein-mediated solubilization into the extracellular medium of a small amount of plasma membrane PL and FC; the mechanism is facilitated by interaction of apolipoprotein with the plasma membrane and occurs without obvious cellular damage” (6.Gillotte K.L. Davidson W.S. Lund-Katz S. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1918-1928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, the features of the apolipoprotein required for membrane microsolubilization were investigated (29.Gillotte K.L. Zaiou M. Lund-Katz S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Holvoet P. Dhoest A. Palgunachari M.N. Segrest J.P. Weisgraber K.H. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2021-2028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). It was concluded that the mechanism of apoA-I-mediated FC efflux involves two essential features, 1) the membrane lipids must be organized in a manner that allows insertion of α-helices among the lipids, and 2) the α-helices must exhibit sufficient binding affinity to induce the apolipoprotein-lipid association. It now seems apparent that ABCA1 activity is critical for the first feature, but the sizes and composition of the particles released by apoA-I remain to be established. FC loading of fibroblasts can have direct effects on plasma membrane composition and structure by altering the FC/PL ratio and indirect effects via up-regulation of ABCA1 (15.Lawn R.M. Wade D.P. Garvin M.R. Wang X. Schwartz K. Porter J.G. Seilhamer J.J. Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 16.Fielding P.E. Nagao K. Hakamata H. Chimini G. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14113-14120Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To better define these contributions, we have examined how FC enrichment of fibroblasts affects FC and PL efflux to apoA-I. Since FC loading of fibroblasts has opposite effects on PC and sphingomyelin (SM) biosynthesis (25.Leppimaki P. Mattinen J. Slotte J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6385-6394Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 30.Leppimaki P. Kronqvist R. Slotte J.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the contribution of PL synthesis to ABCA1-mediated release of lipids to apoA-I was investigated. Enrichment of the cells with FC enhances efflux of FC because of increases in both the amount of FC in the plasma membrane and the expression of ABCA1; the latter effect combined with increased PC biosynthesis stimulates release of PC. 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine and bovine brain sphingomyelin were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL) (+99% grade).

MEM devoid of choline was prepared for experiments designed to understand the importance of PL synthesis in apoA-I-mediated FC efflux. In these studies all manipulations were carried out in parallel plates with media either containing or lacking choline. Control and FC-enriched fibroblasts were grown in the choline-deficient media for 3–6 days; this treatment resulted in decreases of cellular PL phosphorus relative to protein of about one-third. This result indicated that incubation of the fibroblasts in choline-free medium inhibited PC synthesis as expected (24.Tabas I. Marathe S. Keesler G.A. Beatini N. Shiratori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22773-22781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In some experiments, methyl-β-cyclodextrin (CD)·FC complexes at a final CD concentration of 5 mm (CD:cholesterol (mol:mol) = 12:1) were utilized to rapidly enrich the monolayers 2–3-fold with FC (32.Christian A.E. Haynes M.P. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2264-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In one experiment 2-hydroxy-propyl-β-CD was utilized to ensure that effects were not specific for methyl-β-cyclodextrin; in this case the CD solution was prepared at 25 mm with a CD:cholesterol molar ratio of 40:1. The results with 2-hydroxypropyl-β-CD were identical to those obtained with methyl-β-cyclodextrin treatments. FC and PL efflux measurements were conducted as described before (6.Gillotte K.L.

The kinetic models used to analyze the measured time courses of FC and PL efflux from fibroblasts are presented under “.” As described before for this system (33.Davidson W.S. Lund-Katz S.

The efflux time courses were fitted to Equation 1 by nonlinear regression, and the rate constants for FC flux were derived from the fitting variables using Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5, Equation 6. The apparent rate constant for efflux (ke) was used to calculate the halftime (t½) of efflux from the relationship t½ = ln 2/ke. Model 3, in which there are accessible and inaccessible pools of cellular FC and PL, was applied to the efflux induced by the presence of lipid-free apoA-I in the extracellular medium. Equation 16 was used to estimate the initial distribution of cellular FC between accessible and isolated pools. Fibroblasts grown to confluence and labeled with [3H]cholesterol as described above were incubated with 0.2% w/v trypsin at 0 °C for 10 min. The trypsin was removed, and the monolayers were washed 2× with MEM-HEPES containing 0.1% (w/v) soybean trypsin inhibitor and 2× with MEM-HEPES, warming the cells to 37 °C. Cholesterol efflux to apoA-I was performed as described above. The effectiveness of the trypsin treatment in removing cell surface proteins was assessed by using cells in which the surface proteins were radioiodinated (35.Shyng S.L. Huber M.T. Harris D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15922-15928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent cells in 35-mm dishes were washed on ice with PBS then incubated for 20 min with 1 ml of PBS containing 400 μg of glucose, 40 μg of lactoperoxidase, 20 μg of glucose oxidase, and 100 μCi of Na[125I]. The reaction was quenched by rinsing cells 2× with PBS containing 1 mm tyrosine and 10 mm sodium metabisulfite followed by 2 additional washes with PBS. The labeled cell monolayers were then treated with trypsin as described above, and the radioactivity released into the media was compared with the total125I incorporated into the monolayers. Approximately 50% of the total 125I was released upon trypsin treatment; this value was corrected for the release of counts measured in the absence of trypsin. The effects of cAMP on cellular cholesterol efflux were examined because this treatment has been shown in macrophages and fibroblasts to promote expression of ABCA1 (15.Lawn R.M. Wade D.P.

Chlorophenylthio-cAMP was incubated with radiolabeled control or FC-enriched fibroblasts at 0.3 mm in MEM-HEPES at 37 °C for 18 h before the initiation of cholesterol efflux measurements. For comparison, MEM-HEPES alone was incubated for 18 h before the efflux experiment. As described previously (36.Sakr S.W. Williams D.L. Stoudt G.W. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), radioiodinated apoA-I was incubated with the fibroblast monolayers at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 μg/ml for 1 h at 4 °C to measure the total binding of apoA-I to the cell surface. The nonspecific binding was determined by measuring the same concentration dependence of binding with a 40-fold excess of unlabeled apoA-I present at each concentration. From the difference between total and nonspecific binding, the specific binding of apoA-I was calculated and fitted by nonlinear regression to the one-site binding equation, Y = Bmax ×X/(Kd + X). From this equation, the maximal binding (Bmax) and concentration of apoA-I required to reach half-maximal binding (Kd), were determined for both the control and FC-enriched fibroblasts. Cells labeled with [14C]cholesterol and [3H]choline chloride were washed 4× with PBS, and the monolayers were exposed to 50 mm formaldehyde and 2 mm dithiothreitol in PBS for 90 min at 37 °C (37.Scott R.E.

Cell Sci. 1979; 35: 245-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The incubation buffer was removed and discarded, and the monolayers were washed with hypertonic PBS (0.44m NaCl, pH 7.6). This treatment resulted in the release of a large number of plasma membrane vesicles (0.5–5.0-μm diameter (39.Bellini F. Phillips M.C. Pickell C. Rothblat G.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 777: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)); the buffer was removed and collected for analysis. Aliquots were extensively extracted as described above to remove any free [3H]choline present, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The composition of the plasma membrane vesicles, which is assumed to be approximately representative of the plasma membrane as a whole, was computed from the specific activities of the FC and PL in the cell at t = 0. Protein concentration was determined by a modification of the Lowry assay (40.Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5347) Google Scholar). Total and FC contents of the cellular lipid extracts were quantified by gas-liquid chromatography using cholesteryl methyl ether as an internal standard. PL mass was determined as inorganic phosphorus (41.Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the mass of choline-containing PL was determined by an enzymatic assay (Wako). The composition of the choline-containing PL appearing in the medium upon stimulation of PL efflux from the cell monolayers was determined by a one-dimensional TLC separation procedure. Samples were collected and extracted from free [3H]choline as described above. Further isolation of PL and separation into the various PL subclasses was achieved through two sequential developments in chloroform:methanol:ammonium hydroxide (75:25:4 (v:v:v)) (Silica Gel G). Migration distances of lysophosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, and phosphatidylcholine were determined by iodine staining of lanes containing purified standards of these specie"
https://openalex.org/W2068931893,"Abstract Matrix vesicles are extracellular organelles involved in mineral formation that are regulated by 1α,25(OH)2D3. Prior studies have shown that protein kinase C (PKC) activity is involved in mediating the effects of 1α,25(OH)2D3 in both matrix vesicles and plasma membranes. Here, we examined the regulation of matrix vesicle PKC by 1α,25(OH)2D3 during biogenesis and after deposition in the matrix. When growth zone costochondral chondrocytes were treated for 9 min with 1α,25(OH)2D3, PKCζ in matrix vesicles was inhibited, while PKCα in plasma membranes was increased. In contrast, after treatment for 12 or 24 h, PKCζ in matrix vesicles was increased, while PKCα in plasma membranes was unchanged. The effect of 1α,25(OH)2D3 was stereospecific and metabolite-specific. Monensin blocked the increase in matrix vesicle PKC after 24 h, suggesting the secosteroid-regulated packaging of PKC. In addition, the 1α,25(OH)2D3 membrane vitamin D receptor (1,25-mVDR) was involved, since a specific antibody blocked the 1α,25(OH)2D3-dependent changes in PKC after both long and short treatment times. In contrast, antibodies to annexin II had no effect, and there was no evidence for the presence of the nuclear VDR on Western blots. To investigate the signaling pathways involved in regulating matrix vesicle PKC activity after biosynthesis, matrix vesicles were isolated and then treated for 9 min with 1α,25(OH)2D3 in the presence and absence of specific inhibitors. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C, phospholipase D, or Gi/Gs had no effect. However, inhibition of Gq blocked the effect of 1α,25(OH)2D3. The rapid effect of 1α,25(OH)2D3 also involved the 1,25-mVDR. Moreover, arachidonic acid was found to stimulate PKC when added directly to isolated matrix vesicles. These results indicate that matrix vesicle PKC is regulated by 1α,25(OH)2D3 at three levels: 1) during matrix vesicle biogenesis; 2) through direct action on the membrane; and 3) through production of other factors such as arachidonic acid."

Human MYH has been shown to interact physically with human proliferating cell nuclear antigen (hPCNA). Here, we report that a similar interaction between SpMYH and SpPCNA occurs in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Binding of SpMYH to SpPCNA was not observed when phenylalanine 444 in the PCNA binding motif of SpMYH was replaced with alanine. The F444A mutant of SpMYH expressed in yeast cells had normal adenine glycosylase and DNA binding activities. However, expression of this mutant form of SpMYH in a SpMYHΔ cell could not reduce the mutation frequency of the cell to the normal level. Moreover, SpMYH interacted with hPCNA, and SpPCNA interacted with hMYH but not with F518A/F519A mutant hMYH containing mutations in its PCNA binding motif. Although the SpMYHΔ cells expressing hMYH had partially reduced mutation frequency, the F518A/F519A mutant hMYH could not reduce the mutation frequency of SpMYHΔ cells.

These three enzymes (hMTH1, hOGG1, and hMYH), like their E. coli homologs, are proposed to function in the reduction of 8-oxoG in the human genome (22.Boiteux S. Radicella J.P. Biochimie (Paris). 1999; 81: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Although no mutY homolog has been found in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a mutY homologous (SpMYH) gene of fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe was identified and cloned (23.Lu A-L. Fawcett W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25098-25105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The SpMYH gene encodes a 461-amino acid protein, which displays 28 and 31% identity to E. coli MutY and hMYH, respectively. Expression of SpMYH cDNA in an E. coli mutY mutant cell is able to reduce the mutation frequency. As with the E. coliMutY, the SpMYH protein has both adenine glycosylase and weak AP lyase activities on A/G and A/GO mismatches (23.Lu A-L. Fawcett W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25098-25105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). An SpMYH knockout strain (SpMYHΔ) of S. pombe has been shown to be a mutator (24.Chang D.-Y. Gu Y. Lu A-L. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 266: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Disruption of SpMYH also causes increased sensitivity to H2O2 but not to UV irradiation. Thus, MutY homolog plays an important role in defense against oxidative stress in eukaryotes. We have shown that hMYH is directly associated with human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (hAPE1), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (hPCNA), and replication protein A (hRPA), suggesting that hMYH plays a role in the long patch base excision repair pathway (25.Parker A. Gu Y. Mahoney W. Lee S.-H. Singh K.K. Lu A-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5547-5555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that hMYH repair is coupled to DNA replication through docking with hPCNA and hRPA (25.Parker A. Gu Y. Mahoney W. Lee S.-H. Singh K.K. Lu A-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5547-5555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 26.Boldogh I. Milligan D. Lee M.S. Bassett H. Lloyd R.S. McCullough A.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2802-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The coupling to DNA replication may provide a signal to target the MYH repair to the daughter DNA strands. In such a model, MYH can remove adenines on the daughter strands mismatched with guanines or 8-oxoG as a result of DNA replication errors but cannot excise the adenines on the template strands. Here, we provide direct evidence that the interaction between SpMYH and SpPCNA of S. pombe is important for SpMYH biological function in mutation avoidance. A mutant form of SpMYH, which has normal glycosylase activity but cannot interact with SpPCNA, is partially defective in vivo. In addition, interactions between MYH and PCNA proteins from both S. pombe and humans are interchangeable. S. pombe will be an excellent model system to study mammalian MYH repair. The cDNA of hMYH was cloned into the S. pombe expression vector pREP41X (American Type Culture Collection) by the PCR method. XHO-5-MYH and XMA-3-MYH were used as primers, and pET11-hMYH7 (27.Gu Y. Lu A-L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2666-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was used as the template to amplify the cDNA by Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) of hMYH gene. The cDNA of SpMYH containing the F444A mutation and cDNA of hMYH containing the double mutation F518A/F519A were constructed by the PCR method. 5′ Primer (XHO-5-SP) and mutation primer (F444A) were used as primers, and pSPMYH19 (23.Lu A-L. Fawcett W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25098-25105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was used as the template to amplify the cDNA of SpMYH gene containing a F444A mutation. Similarly, XHO-5-MYH and XMA-3-AA were used as primers, and pET11-hMYH7 (27.Gu Y. Lu A-L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2666-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was used as the template to amplify the cDNA of hMYH gene containing a double mutation of F518A/F519A. All the oligonucleotides used are listed in Table I. The three resulting PCR products were digested with XhoI and XbaI, cloned into pREP41X, and transformed into SpMYH knockout cells, JSP303-Y4 (SpMYHΔ) (24.Chang D.-Y. Gu Y. Lu A-L. Mol. Genet.

Open table in a new tab The cDNA fragment containing residues 232–535 of hMYH (Δ231hMYH) fused to the glutathione S-transferase gene was made by the PCR method using the primers CHANG143 and GU2 and the template pET11-hMYH7 (27.Gu Y. Lu A-L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2666-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Table I). Construct Δ231hMYH-GST containing the F518A/F519A mutation was obtained by PCR with primers CHANG143 and XMA-3-AA and template pET11-hMYH7 (27.Gu Y. Lu A-L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2666-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). SpMYH-GST was obtained by PCR with primers BAM-5-SP and CHANG220 and template pSPMYH19 (23.Lu A-L. Fawcett W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25098-25105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The PCR products were digested with BamHI and XhoI and ligated into the BamHI-XhoI-digested pGEX-4T-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The sequences of the cloned genes (pGEXΔ231hMYH, pGEXΔ231hMYH-AA, and pGEXSPMYH) were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The His-tagged SpPCNA protein was obtained by cloning the SpPCNA gene into vectors pET21a and pET28b (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI). The SpPCNA gene was amplified from a S. pombe cDNA library in pGADGH (kindly provided by D. Beach, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). To clone into pET21a, PCR products were produced by primers PCNA-5-NDE and PCNA-3-ECO, digested with NdeI and EcoRI, and ligated into the NdeI-EcoRI-digested vector. To clone into pET28b, PCR products were produced by primers PCNA-5-NDE and PCNA-3-BAM, digested with NdeI and BamHI, and ligated into the NdeI-BamHI-digested vector. Two clones containing the SpPCNA gene (pET21-SPCNA and pET28-SPCNA) were confirmed by DNA sequencing. CHANG219 and CHANG220 were used as primers, and pREPSPY-A was used as a template to amplify SpMYH cDNA containing the F444A mutation. The PCR product was cleaved by NdeI and BamHI and ligated into pET28b to obtain the clone pET28SPY-A. E. coli BL21-star cells (Stratagene) harboring the expression plasmid, pET28SPY-A, were grown in LB broth containing 100 mg/ml kanamycin at 25 °C. Protein expression was induced at an A590 of 0.6 by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm, and the cells were harvested 16 h later. The cell paste, from a 500-ml culture, was resuspended in 8 ml of buffer A (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The His-tagged SpMYH(F444A) mutant protein was purified by a nickel-agarose column (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the His-tag was removed by thrombin (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) cleavage. SpPCNA protein was purified as a His-tagged protein from the BL21-star cell harboring plasmid pET28-SPCNA, and then the tag was removed similar to the procedures described above for SpMYH(F444A) mutant protein. Recombinant SpMYH expressed in E. coli was purified according to the procedures described by Lu and Fawcett (23.Lu A-L. Fawcett W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25098-25105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Human PCNA expressed in E. coli was from Dr. Mike O'Donell (Rockfeller University and Howard Hughes Medical Institute). The His-tagged SpPCNA from the BL21-star cell harboring plasmid pET21-SPCNA was bound to nickel-agarose (Qiagen Inc.) according to the manufacturer's procedures. Purified SpMYH and SpMYH(F444A) (200 ng) expressed in E. coli were added to beads and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After washing with buffer N (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl) containing 50 mm imidazole, the bound proteins were eluted by buffer N containing 250 mm imidazole. The unbound and eluting fractions were fractionated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The affinity-purified SpMYH polyclonal antibodies (28.McGoldrick J.P. Yeh Y.-C. Solomon M. Essigmann J.M. Lu A-L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 989-996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used for Western blotting analysis. Expression, immobilization of GST-hMYH constructs, and GST-pull-down assay were similar to the procedures described previously (25.Parker A. Gu Y. Mahoney W. Lee S.-H. Singh K.K. Lu A-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5547-5555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Purified hPCNA and SpPCNA (200 ng) expressed in E. coli were added to the GST-hMYH or GST-SpMYH constructs (300 ng) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The pellets (P) and supernatants (S, 30 μl) were fractionated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and Western blot analyses for hPCNA and SpPCNA were performed with antibody against hPCNA (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp.) (29.Towbin H.T. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44938) Google Scholar). A control was run concurrently with immobilized GST alone. The binding and glycosylase assays for SpMYH in yeast cell extracts with an A/GO-containing DNA were described previously (23.Lu A-L. Fawcett W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25098-25105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 24.Chang D.-Y. Gu Y. Lu A-L. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 266: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) except using 9 mm EDTA. The DNA substrate was a 20-mer duplex DNA containing an A/8-oxoG mismatch (see Table I) that was labeled at the 3′-end of the mismatched A-containing strand. Five independent yeast colonies were grown to late log phase in EMM containing 0.1 mg/ml uracil. Additional amino acids were supplemented for the wild-type strain (0.1 mg/ml Leu and His) and the SpMYHΔ strain (0.1 mg/ml Leu). Each culture (0.2 ml) was plated onto EMM agar plates containing 1 mg/ml 5-fluoro-orotic acid (FOA) and 0.1 mg/ml uracil. FOA-resistant colonies were counted after 5 days of growth. The cell titer was determined by plating 0.1 ml of a 10−4 dilution onto plates without FOA. The mutation frequency was calculated as the ratio of FOA-resistant cells to the total cells. The measurement was repeated more than three times. It has been shown that PCNA can interact with many proteins involved in DNA replication and repair and that these PCNA-binding proteins share a common motif (30.Zhang P. Mo J.Y. Perez A. Leon A.

BioEssays. 1998; 20: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Generally, this motif contains a glutamine (Gln) at position 1, an aliphatic residue such as leucine (Leu), isoleucine (Ile), or methionine (Met) at position 4, and a pair of aromatic residues (Phe or Tyr) at positions 7 and 8. The residues flanking the conserved motif also show a preponderance of proline and basic residues. The conserved PCNA binding motifQ XX L XX FFis found in human and mouse MutY homologs (20.Slupska M.M. Baikalov C. Luther W.M. Chiang J.-H. Wei Y.-F. Miller J.H. J.

Lee M.S. Bassett H. Lloyd R.S. McCullough A.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2802-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) have shown that hMYH colocalizes with hPCNA to replication foci. The hPCNA binding activity is located at the C terminus of hMYH containing residues 505–527 (25.Parker A. Gu Y. Mahoney W. Lee S.-H. Singh K.K. Lu A-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5547-5555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Although S. pombe MYH (23.Lu A-L. Fawcett W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25098-25105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) contains the conserved leucine (Leu-441) at position 4 as well as a phenylalanine (Phe-444) at position 7 within the PCNA binding motif, it does not contain either a glutamine at position 1 or a phenylalanine at position 8 (31.Warbrick E. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). To demonstrate that the same MYH-PCNA interaction occurs in the yeast system, we performed affinity binding experiments with full-length His-tagged SpPCNA and purified SpMYH. As shown in Fig. 1B, SpMYH was detected in the bound fraction of nickel-agarose containing bound SpPCNA (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2) but not in the nickel-agarose containing bovine serum albumin (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4). When Phe-444 in the conserved SpPCNA binding motif was mutated to Ala, SpMYH could not bind SpPCNA (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6). Thus, there is a direct association between SpMYH and SpPCNA. The results indicate that glutamine at position 1 and phenylalanine at position 8 are dispensable for SpMYH and SpPCNA interaction. Several PCNA-binding proteins also lack this conserved glutamine (30.Zhang P. Mo J.Y. Perez A. Leon A. Liu L. Mazloum N. Xu H. Lee M.Y.W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26647-26653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) although this residue has been reported as being essential for the interaction between 5′-methylcytosine DNA methyltransferase and PCNA (33.Chuang L.S. Ian H.I. Koh T.W. Ng H.H. Xu G. Li B.F. Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). One factor to enhance the SpMYH-SpPCNA interaction may be the presence of clusters of basic residues flanking the conserved motif of SpMYH (Fig. 1A). Because SpMYH and hMYH have different PCNA binding motifs (Fig. 1A), we speculate whether SpMYH can bind to hPCNA or SpPCNA can bind to hMYH. The affinity binding experiments with GST fusion proteins of SpMYH and hMYH were performed with purified hPCNA and SpPCNA, respectively. Human PCNA was detected in the GST-SpMYH pellets (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2) but not in the GST beads (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4). Conversely, SpPCNA was detected in the pellets of Δ231-hMYH fused to GST (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2) but not in the GST beads (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6). Residues Phe-518 and Phe-519 of hMYH have been identified as being essential for hPCNA binding (25.Parker A. Gu Y. Mahoney W. Lee S.-H. Singh K.K. Lu A-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5547-5555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). When both Phe-518 and Phe-519 of hMYH were mutated to Ala residues, GST-hMYH could not bind SpPCNA (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4). Thus, the interactions between MYH and PCNA proteins from both S. pombe and humans are interchangeable. The physical interactions between MYH and PCNA proteins from both S. pombe and humans are consistent with the high homologies of these proteins. The PCNA proteins from both organisms have 51% identity whereas SpMYH displays 31% identity to hMYH. The anti-hPCNA antibody directed toward residues 112–121 can also cross-react with SpPCNA (Fig. 2B). Several proteins have been shown to bind to a hydrophobic pocket consisting of the interdomain connector loop (residues 118–135) and loops on the C termini of the PCNA trimer (34.Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar,35.Jonsson Z.O. Hindges R. Hubscher U. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2412-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). A ClustalW alignment indicates that amino acid sequences in this pocket are very conserved between SpPCNA and hPCNA. The SpMYH protein is highly homologous to E. coli MutY and hMYH. The N-terminal domain of E. coli MutY has the catalytic activity (36.Gogos A. Cillo J. Clarke N.D. Lu A-L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16665-16671Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 37.Li X. Wright P.M. Lu A-L. J. Biol.

The PCNA binding motifs located at the C-terminal ends of eukaryotic MYH are not conserved in bacterial MutY proteins. To test that Phe-444 is not at the active site of SpMYH, mutant SpMYH (F444A) was generated and expressed in the SpMYHΔ yeast cell. Because wild-type and F444A mutant SpMYH from plasmids were expressed about 30–60-fold higher than that from chromosomal gene (Fig. 3, lanes 1, 3, and 5), different amounts of cell extracts were used in the SpMYH assays. When the extract from the SpMYH (F444A) mutant was assayed for SpMYH activities, the glycosylase (Fig. 4A, lane 4) and DNA binding (Fig. 4B, lane 4) activities of SpMYH with an A/GO-containing DNA substrate could be detected. The glycosylase activity of F444A mutant protein was similar to that of the expressed wild-type SpMYH (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 3 and 4) because the F444A mutant was slightly higher expressed in yeast cells than that of wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3, compare lanes 3 and 5). The substrate binding activity of expressed F444A mutant was slightly weaker than that of the expressed wild-type enzyme (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 3 and 4) but was higher than that of the SpMYH from the chromosomal gene (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 1 and 4). Thus, Phe-444 of SpMYH is not involved in the catalytic activity but is essential for binding to SpPCNA.Figure 4Mutant SpMYH(F444A) has normal glycosylase and DNA binding activities.

Gu Y. Lu A-L. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 266: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Expression of wild type SpMYH in the SpMYHΔ can reduce the mutation frequency to the same level as wild-type cells. Because the nmt1 promoter controls the expression of SpMYHcDNA in pREP41X, SpMYH protein expression can be regulated by varying concentrations of thiamine in the minimal medium. At 5 μg/ml thiamine, the expression of SpMYH is almost completely suppressed (24.Chang D.-Y. Gu Y. Lu A-L. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 266: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, lane 4). Therefore, cells growing in minimal media containing 5 μg/ml thiamine provide good controls for mutation frequency measurement. As shown in Table II, the SpMYHΔ cell expressing wild-type SpMYH protein in media without thiamine had a mutation frequency similar to that of the wild type (compare lines 1 and 3) although the expression level of SpMYH from plasmid is about 30-fold higher than that of the SpMYH from chromosomal gene (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 3). It appears that the SpMYH protein amount from the chromosomal gene is sufficient to maintain the genome stability. When the expression of SpMYH was inhibited by 5 μg/ml thiamine, the cell's mutation frequency was much higher than that of the wild type (Table II, compare lines 1 and 4).Table IIMutation frequencies of S. pombe strainsStrainMutation frequency (FOAR/108 cells)-Fold 1.

Open table in a new tab To test whether interaction with SpPCNA is important for the SpMYH function in vivo, SpMYHΔ yeast cell expressing mutant SpMYH (F444A) was tested for mutation frequency. The expression level of F444A mutant protein in yeast cells was slightly higher than that of wild-type enzyme in the absence of thiamine (Fig. 3, compare lanes 3 and 5). The mutation frequencies of SpMYHΔ yeast cells expressing mutant SpMYH were about 25-fold higher than that of the wild type and was slightly lower than that of the parental SpMYHΔ strain (Table II, compare lines 5 and 6 with lines 1 and 2). Thus, the F444A mutant SpMYH could not complement the chromosomal SpMYH mutation. Therefore, a mutant SpMYH that retains substrate binding and glycosylase activities but cannot interact with SpPCNA is nearly defective on oxidative DNA repair. These results provide direct evidence that the interaction between SpMYH and SpPCNA is important for SpMYH biological function in mutation avoidance. As shown above, the physical interactions between both MYH and PCNA proteins from S. pombe and humans are interchangeable. We then expressed hMYH and mutant hMYH (F518A and F519A) in the SpMYHΔ yeast cell and tested their in vivo complementation activities. When wild-type hMYH was expressed in the SpMYHΔ cells, the mutation frequency was 8-fold higher than that of the wild type but was 5-fold lower than that of the parental SpMYHΔ strain (Table II, compare lines 7 and 8 with lines 1 and 2). Therefore, hMYH is partially functional in S. pombe cells. However, when the F518A/F519A mutant hMYH was expressed in the SpMYHΔ cells, the mutation frequency was the same as that of the parental SpMYHΔ strain (Table II, compare last two lines with line 2). As shown in the Western blot in Fig. 3, the expression levels of both wild-type and mutant hMYH (lanes 9 and 10) from the plasmids were similar. Additionally, the expression levels of hMYH and SpMYH in yeast cells were comparable when they were compared to known amounts of recombinant hMYH (Fig. 3, compare lanes 9 and 10 with lane 11) and SpMYH (Fig. 3, compare lanes 3 and 5 with lanes 6–8) expressed in E. coli, respectively. Therefore, partial rescue of the mutator phenotype of SpMYHΔ cells by wild-type hMYH is not due to the low expression levels of hMYH. It is possible that hMYH may not act as SpMYH in the yeast cells because hMYH does not interact well with other enzymes involved in the SpMYH repair pathway such as AP endonuclease or single-stranded DNA-binding protein. It has been shown that mouse MYH activity can be stimulated by human AP endonuclease (32.Yang H. Clendenin W.M. Wong D. Demple B. Slupska M.M. Chiang J.H. Miller J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and that hMYH physically interacts with hRPA (25.Parker A. Gu Y. Mahoney W. Lee S.-H. Singh K.K. Lu A-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5547-5555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that hMYH base excision repair is coupled to DNA replication through docking with hPCNA and hRPA (25.Parker A. Gu Y. Mahoney W. Lee S.-H. Singh K.K. Lu A-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5547-5555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 26.Boldogh I. Milligan D. Lee M.S. Bassett H. Lloyd R.S. McCullough A.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2802-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). PCNA may be important to position MYH protein on the replication fork and may allow MYH to discriminate between the parental and daughter strands. In such mechanism, MYH excises misinserted A from template GO but does not act on template A when the DNA polymerase misinserts GO. However, some in vivo MYH function is retained in the F444A mutant SpMYH. Thus, the role of PCNA is not absolutely essential. This partial retention of the function of mutant SpMYH(F444A) may reflect that the mutant protein can still act on A/GO mismatches on daughter DNA strands through interaction with other replication proteins such as RPA. It is also possible that DNA polymerase has a higher frequency of inserting A on the GO template than inserting GO on the A template. The PCNA sliding clamp also interacts with several DNA repair proteins. When Phe residues at the PCNA binding motifs of Fen1 and DNA ligase I are substituted by Ala, their functions in long patch base excision repair are reduced (42.Gary R. Kim K. Cornelius H.L.

https://openalex.org/W2150932281,"This work identifies novel structure-function relationships between Tn5 transposase (Tnp) and its DNA recognition sequence. The Tn5 Tnp-DNA co-crystal structure revealed the protein-DNA contacts of the post-cleavage complex (Davies, D. R., Goryshin, I. Y., Reznikoff, W. S., and Rayment, I. (2000) Science 289, 77–85). One of the most striking features of this complex is the rotation of thymine 2 (T2) away from the DNA helix and into a pocket within the Tnp. This interaction appears similar to the “base flipping” phenomenon found in many DNA repair enzymes such as T4 endonuclease V and uracil DNA glycosylase (Roberts, R. J., and Cheng, X. (1998) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 67, 181–198). To study the biochemical significance of this phenomenon, we mutated the Tnp residues proposed to be involved in stabilizing this interaction and removed the T2 nucleotide to examine which steps in the transposition reaction require T2-Tnp interactions. From this work, we have determined that stacking interactions between T2 and Tnp are critical for efficient transposition in vitro. In addition, our results suggested that T2-Tnp interactions facilitate hairpin formation and hairpin resolution primarily through base stacking and that T2 plays a role in the alignment of the transposon DNA for strand transfer."
https://openalex.org/W2084305978,"A bacterial strain (TA13) capable of utilizing t-anethole as the sole carbon source was isolated from soil. The strain was identified as Arthrobacter aurescens based on its 16 S rRNA gene sequence. Key steps of the degradation pathway of t-anethole were identified by the use of t-anethole-blocked mutants and specific inducible enzymatic activities. In addition to t-anethole, strain TA13 is capable of utilizing anisic acid, anisaldehyde, and anisic alcohol as the sole carbon source. t-Anethole-blocked mutants were obtained following mutagenesis and penicillin enrichment. Some of these blocked mutants, accumulated in the presence of t-anethole quantitative amounts of t-anethole-diol, anisic acid, and 4,6-dicarboxy-2-pyrone and traces of anisic alcohol and anisaldehyde. Enzymatic activities induced by t-anethole included: 4-methoxybenzoate O-demethylase, p-hydroxybenzoate 3-hydroxylase, and protocatechuate-4,5-dioxygenase. These findings indicate that t-anethole is metabolized to protocatechuic acid through t-anethole-diol, anisaldehyde, anisic acid, and p-hydroxybenzoic acid. The protocatechuic acid is then cleaved by protocatechuate-4,5-dioxygenase to yield 2-hydroxy-4-carboxy muconate-semialdehyde. Results from inducible uptake ability and enzymatic assays indicate that at least three regulatory units are involved in the t-anethole degradation pathway.

Plant essential oils consist of volatile, lipophilic substances that are mainly hydrocarbons or compounds derived from the metabolism of mono- and sesquiterpenes and phenylpropenoides (1.Belitz H.D. Grosch W. Food Chemistry. 2nd Ed. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany1999Crossref Google Scholar). Many of these essential oil components play a role in the plant defense system and, despite their poor solubility, are extremely toxic for microorganisms (2.Karapinar M. Int. J.

Phenylpropenoides can potentially serve as a good source of starting material for the production of aromatic aldehydes for flavorings and aromas. Several studies have demonstrated that valuable aroma compounds are produced as intermediates in the degradation pathways of such phenylpropenoides (6.Andreoni V. Bernasconi S. Bestetti G. Appl.

As a result there is a growing interest in the enzymatic systems leading to their degradation (12.Steinbuchel, A., Priefert, H., Rabenhorst, J.

Microbial metabolism of phenylpropenoides and cinnamates involves oxidation of the side chain to carboxylic acid prior to hydroxylation and cleavage of the benzene ring. For example, eugenol and ferulic acid are oxidized to vanillic acid (6.Andreoni V. Bernasconi S. Bestetti G. Appl. Microbiol.

Some of the enzymes involved at the early stages of eugenol side chain oxidation were recently characterized (15.Priefert H. Overhage J. Steinbuchel A. Arch. Microbiol. 1999; 172: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). t-Anethole is the major component of several essential oils, including star anise (Illicium verum), anise seed oil (Pimpinella anisum), and sweet fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill. var. dulce) (18.Ravid U. Putievsky E. Snir N. J. Nat. Prod. (Lloydia). 1983; 46: 848-851Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The degradation of t-anethole may resemble that of isoeugenol due to the similarity in their 1-propenyl side chain (17.Delnery D. Degrassi G. Rizzo R. Bruschi C.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1244: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18.Ravid U. Putievsky E. Snir N. J. Nat. Prod. (Lloydia). 1983; 46: 848-851Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that microorganisms capable of utilizing t-anethole will produce valuable intermediates as 4-methoxylated aromatic flavor and fragrance compounds, such as anisic alcohol, anisaldehyde, or anisic acid. To date, very little is known about the metabolism of t-anethole by microorganisms. This study reports the isolation of a bacterial strain capable of degrading t-anethole and the characterization of key degradation steps of this compound. Bacterial strains were isolated from soil samples taken from a greenhouse of spices and herbs at Agricultural Research Organization Newe Ya'ar, and the Technion's ecological garden. Soil samples (10 g) were suspended in 100 ml of saline, and 2 ml of the dispersion were used as an inoculum. Enrichment medium was composed of inorganic basal salts medium supplemented with 0.1%t-anethole adsorbed on amberlite XAD-2 (Acros Organics, Janssen Pharmaceuticalaan 3a, Geel, Belgium). The basal salts medium contained: 1.2 g of (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 g of CaCl 2H2O, 0.1 g of MgSO4 7H2O, 0.01 g of FeSO4 7H2O, 0.2 g of K2HPO4, 0.1 g of KH2PO4, and 1200 ml of distilled water. Growth was carried out in shake flasks containing 20% (v/v) medium, at 30 °C (200 rpm). Pure bacterial strains were selected based on their morphological appearance on agar plates. All other growth experiments were carried out using a modified M9 media, containing: Na2HPO4 (6.8 g/liter), KH2PO4 (3.0 g/liter), NaCl (0.5 g/liter), NH4Cl (1.0 g/liter), MgSO4 7H2O (1 g/liter), FeSO4 (0.01 g/liter), and CaCl2 (0.02 g/liter). Bacterial isolates were identified by their fatty acids profile, using the Microbial Identification System (19.MIDI Inc.Microbial Identification System Operating Manual. MIDI Inc., Newark, DE1992Google Scholar), at the Plant Diagnostic Laboratory (Plant Protection & Inspection Services, Ministry of Agriculture, Beit Dagan, Israel). Strain TA13 was also identified based on its 16 S rRNA gene sequence (GenBankTM accession number AF467106), which was obtained via PCR using universal primers for eubacterial 16 S rRNA. Primers were 27F (5′-GAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′) and 765R (5′-CTGTTTGCTCCCCACGCTTC-3′). DNA sequencing was performed at the Biological Services Unit of the Weizmann Institute, Rehovot, Israel. Strain TA13 was grown on LB medium for 24 h (30 °C, 200 rpm) and following appropriate dilutions; samples were plated on a LB agar plate, to form a uniform lawn. Crystals of MNNG 1The abbreviations used are: MNNGN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidineGCgas chromatographyMSmass spectrometryCIchemical ionizationHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography were placed on agar plates, and the plates were incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. Clear zones were formed around the MNNG crystals, and cells from the boundaries of these zones were collected with a sterile bacterial loop, suspended in M9 medium, and washed twice by the same medium (4 °C, 10,000 rpm, 10 min). The washed mutagenized cells were used as an inoculum for a 25-ml M9 medium + 0.2% glucose (30 °C, 24 h, 200 rpm). This overnight culture was diluted to 0.1A600 nm in 10 ml of M6 medium + 0.1%t-anethole, incubated at 30 °C and 200 rpm up to turbidity of 0.15 A600 nm, and then penicillin G was added to a concentration of 10,000 units/ml. When a significant decrease in turbidity was observed (after about 2 h), the culture was diluted and plated on LB agar plates (30 °C). Single colonies originated from the mutagenized cultures were transferred from the LB plates to triplicate agar plates, containing either t-anethole, glucose, or no carbon source. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 96 h, and colonies that appeared on the glucose plate but did not grow on the t-anethole plate were picked from the glucose plate for further examination of their transformation capabilities.

Following the fermentation, the cell-free culture broth was acidified with H2SO4 to pH ∼2.0 and the potential products extracted with equal volumes of chloroform or ethyl acetate. Following evaporation by rotary evaporator, the extract was dissolved in methanol, and the transformation products were analyzed by TLC and GC. TA13 cells were grown for 24 h on modified M9 medium containing 0.1% glucose and 0.1% t- anethole adsorbed on XAD-2. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C), washed twice, and resuspended in phosphate buffer (pH = 7.0, 0.1 m). The metabolite (∼30 mm) was added to the cell suspension, and the bioconversion was monitored by scanning the UV absorption spectra (200–320 nm) of the cell-free supernatant. Cultures were grown overnight in 400 ml of modified M9 medium containing 0.1%t-anethole adsorbed on XAD-2. Growth of blocked mutant cultures was supported by 0.1% glucose. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C) and washed twice with the appropriate buffer (50 ml). The cells were then broken by a French press, centrifuged (20,000 × g, 25 min, 4 °C), and the soluble fraction was used as cell-free extract for the enzymatic assays. Protein content was determined by the Bradford method (20.Bradford W.W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar) with the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine albumin fraction V (Sigma) as a standard. For determination of protein content of intact cells, the cell suspension was treated with 1 n NaOH for 10 min at 100 °C before the assay. The activity of 4-methoxybenzoate O-demethylase (EC 1.14.99.15) was determined on intact cells. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C), washed twice with phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 8.0), and suspended in phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 8.0). 3-Nitro-4-methoxybenzoate was added to a final concentration of 0.25 mm, and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C (21.Bernhardt F.H. Nastainczyk W. Seidewitz V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 72: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Samples were removed with time, centrifuged (12,000 rpm, 2 min), and the formation of 3-nitro-4-hydroxybenzoate was monitored at 405 nm (ε = 4,040 m−1 cm−1, unit = μmol of 3-nitro-4-hydroxybenzoate/min). The activity of 4-hydroxybenzoate 3-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.2) was determined by monitoring NADH consumption following the addition of p-hydroxybenzoic acid to cell free extracts (22.Sutherland J.B. Crawford D.L. Pometto III, A.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1981; 41: 442-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Appropriate dilutions of cell-free extract were added to 1 ml of phosphate buffer, pH = 7.5 (100 mm) at 30 °C, containing p-hedroxybenzoic acid at a concentration of 20 mm. The reaction was initiated by the addition of NADH to a final concentration of 2 mm. NADH consumption was detected spectrophotometrically at 340 nm (unit = μmol of NADH/min). Dioxygenases that cleave the aromatic ring were assayed spectrophotometrically by detecting the formation of the ring cleavage products in cell free extracts. The activity of protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.3) was demonstrated by the formation of 2-hydroxy-4-carboxy muconate semialdehyde at 410 nm (23.Kojima Y. Itada N. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2223-2228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (unit = 0.001 (A410 nm)/min). Protocatechuate-3,4-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.3) activity was measured by monitoring the increase in absorption at 260 nm (24.MacDonald D.L. Stanier R.Y. Ingraham J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 210: 809-820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activities of catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.1), catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (EC1.13.11.2) and gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (EC 1.13.11.4) were assayed at 260, 375, and 334 nm, respectively (25.Hayaishi O.

TLC was performed using silica gel 60 F254, 0.25-mm plates (Merck), and chloroform/ethyl acetate/formic acid (85:15:1) for development. Products were detected by either UV 254 nm or developing with sulfuric acid (50% in methanol). Aromatic aldehydes were specifically stained by 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (0.4% in 2 n HCl), and phenolic compounds were stained with a solution of 0.5% K3Fe(CN)6 + 0.5% FeCl2·6H2O (28.Krebs K.G. Heusser D. Wimmer H. Stahl E. Thin-layer Chromatography, A Laboratory Handbook. Springer- Verlag, Berlin1969: 854-909Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the typical Rf values were: t-anethole 0.74; anisaldehyde, 0.63; estragole, 0.73; anisic alcohol, 0.33; anisic acid, 0.40; p-hydroxybenzoic acid, 0.11; and protocatechuic acid, 0.05. GC analysis was performed on a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph, using SPB1 capillary column (30 m, 0.25 mm inner diameter, 0.25 μm (Supelco Inc., Bellefonte, PA)), carrier N2 (1.7 ml/min), split flow 60 ml/min, injection temperature 250 °C, detection temperature 300 °C, linked to a computerized integrator (PC Integration pack, Kontron Instruments, Milano, Italy). Typical retention times were (min): 1) t-anethole, 7.20; anisaldehyde, 6.55; anisic alcohol, 7.00; anisic acid, 9.10; p-hydroxybenzoic acid, 10.20; and protocatechuic acid, 12.90 (100 °C (2 min), 10 °C/min, 230 °C); 2) t-anethole. 8.68; anisaldehyde, 7.68; anisic alcohol, 8.34; anisic acid, 11.96 (100 °C (2 min), 5 °C/min, 160 °C (1 min)). High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses were performed on a M6000A HPLC system equipped with a Differential Refractometer R401 (Waters Associates Inc., Milford, MA). Acetonitryl/water 80:20 solvent system at 1.5 ml/min was used for analyses of glycerol and glucose by a LiChrospher 100 NH2column (5 mm, 20 cm) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was performed at the Technion Center for Mass Spectrometry (Technion City, Haifa, Israel) using a Finnigan 4000 and Supelco SPB-5 capillary column (25 m). The mass/charge ratios (m/e) are reported for the molecular ion (M+) and for the major fragment ions with m/e ≤ 70 units smaller than that of M+. Values of m/e with intensities equal or greater than ∼5% of the highest were recorded. Mass spectra (chemical ionization (CI)-MS) were obtained by the use of TSQ-70B mass spectrophotometer (Finnigan Mat) by CI in isobutyl alcohol or ammonia.1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AM-400 spectrometer and chemical shifts reported (in parts/million) with CDCl3, CD3OD, or D2O as the solvents. NMR data are reported as follows: chemical shift as parts/million downfield from tetramethyl silane, number of protons, multiplicity, and assignment. Abbreviations for multiplicity are: s = singlet; d = doublet; t = triplet; m = multiplet. 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AM-400 spectrometer at 100.61 MHz and the chemical shifts reported (in parts/million) relative to the residual solvent signal for CDCl3 (δ = 77.00) or to external sodium 2,2-dimethyl 1–2-silapentene sulfonate (δ = 0.0) for D2O as the solvent. t-Anethole, p-anisaldehyde, m-anisic acid, p-anisic acid, gentisic acid, homogentisic acid, m-hydroxybenzoic acid, protocatechuic acid, NADH, NADP, and NADPH were obtained from Sigma. Catechol, p-hydroxybenzoic acid (99%), and methyl cinnamate (>99%) were obtained from Fluka Chemika-BioChemika (Fluka Chemie AG, Buchs, Switzerland). Anisyl alcohol (98%), estragole (98%), 4-hydroxy-3-nitrobenzoic acid (98%), and 4-methoxy-3-nitrobenzoic acid (98%) were from Aldrich. 3-Methoxy-4-nitrobenzoic acid (98%) was obtained from Acros Organics (Janssen Pharmaceuticalaan 3a, Geel, Belgium). Silica gel for column separations was ICN-Silica 62-200, 60A (ICN Biomedicals GmbH, Eschwege, Germany). Amberlite XAD-2 was obtained either from Sigma or Acros Organics. All other reagents were of analytical grade. In an attempt to isolate bacterial strains capable of utilizing t-anethole, an enrichment procedure using minimal media and t-anethole as the sole carbon source was developed. Initially, t-anethole was added directly to the media. In this procedure we failed to obtain microbial growth presumably due to the toxicity of the carbon source. To overcome this limitation t-anethole was first adsorbed on a hydrophobic carrier (XAD-2), which produced a controlled release system, reducing its toxic effect on the culture. In this system t-anethole-dependent growth was achieved readily. Following several transfers, two independent strains that grow on t-anethole were isolated. Both strains showed similar morphology on agar plates and appeared as yellow and smooth colonies. One of the strains was designated as TA13 and was chosen for further studies. Strain TA13 is aerobic, Gram-positive, with a variable rod shape, which produces yellow pigmentation on agar plate. Isolate TA13 was capable of growing on minimal media in the presence of t-anethole or glucose, resulting in final turbidity of 1.25 OD and 1.95 OD and a doubling time of 4.3 h and 2.1 h, respectively (Fig. 1). Analyses of its fatty acids profile (Table I) suggest that it is an Arthrobacter sp. (similarity index = 0.745). To further identify the strain we utilized universal rRNA primers to amplify the 16 S rRNA gene. The amplification product was sequenced and showed very high homology (identities 1361/1366, 99%) to Arthrobacter aurescens 16 S rRNA gene.Table IFatty acids profile of strain TA13Fatty acid (carbon number)%Fatty acid (carbon number)%13:0 anteiso0.1716:0 iso8.2414:0 iso2.9216:1 w7c/15 iso 2OH0.3714:00.7916:01.0715:0 iso7.89Anteiso 17:1 w9c0.2315:0 anteiso71.4117:0 iso0.4615:00.1817:0 anteiso6.0216:1 iso H0.24Fatty acids profile was determined by the Microbial Identification System (19.MIDI Inc.Microbial Identification System Operating Manual.

To test whether a specific metabolic system is responsible for the utilization of t-anethole, the uptake of t-anethole was measured in TA13 cultures that were grown previously on either t-anethole or glucose as the sole carbon source. The t-anethole uptake was followed by monitoring with time the UV absorption at 260 nm of the cell-free supernatant in a resting cells system. As shown in Fig. 2, only cultures grown previously in the presence of t-anethole exhibit uptake capacity, suggesting that t-anethole uptake is inducible. The observations that (a) strain TA13 has an inducible t-anethole degradation system and (b) it is capable of growing on t-anethole as the sole carbon source makes this strain an excellent candidate for characterization of the t-anethole degradation pathway. The degradation pathway of t-anethole leading to the cleavage of the aromatic ring is likely to include the following steps: oxidation of the propenyl side chain to anisic acid via anisic alcohol and anisaldehyde, followed by demethylation to p-hydroxybenzoic acid and its hydroxylation to protocatechuic acid (Fig. 3). In an attempt to test this pathway, we first tested the ability of TA13 to utilize potential t-anethole degradation products as the sole carbon source. For this purpose, strain TA13 was grown on M9 medium containing the suggested intermediates as the sole carbon source. In addition to t- anethole (I), strain TA13 was capable of growing on anisic alcohol (IV), p-anisaldehyde (V), p-anisic acid (VI), p-hydroxybenzoic acid (VII), and protocatechuic acid (VIII) as the sole carbon source. Interestingly, it failed to utilize catechol or the meta-substituted analogues such as m-anisic acid and m-hydroxybenzoic acid. These results suggest that IV, V, VI, VII, and VIII are possible intermediates in the t-anethole biodegradation pathway. In addition, only t-anethole-induced cells exhibited uptake of the above intermediates in a resting cells system. The observed changes in the UV spectra during the uptake of t-anethole, IV, V, and VI by TA13 cells (previously grown on t-anethole), is shown in Fig. 4.Figure 4Time course for the uptake of t-anethole (A), anisyl alcohol (B), anisaldehyde (C), and anisic acid (D) by Arthrobacter strain TA13 in a resting cells system, previously grown on t-anethole as the sole carbon source. The spectra were recorded in the range of 200–340 nm at the indicated times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mutants blocked in the degradation pathway are in many cases a valuable tool for identifying intermediates. These mutants can accumulate intermediates obtained before the missing enzymatic step. It should be noted that, since strain TA13 is capable of growing on t-anethole as the sole carbon source on minimal media, it is possible to isolate the required blocked mutants by applying penicillin enrichment. To obtain t-anethole-blocked mutants, mutagenesis was performed by MNNG, followed by penicillin enrichment. After screening over 15,000 colonies, 40 t-anethole-blocked mutants were isolated. The ability of these mutants to accumulate intermediates was tested both in cultures grown on glucose (as the carbon source) in the presence of t-anethole (the inducer), and in a resting cells system, in which t-anethole was added to TA13 mutant cells (grown previously on glucose in the presence of t-anethole) suspended in a buffer. At the end of the incubation period, the cells were extracted with organic solvents, the products were separated on silica gel columns, and their identity and yield were determined. Preliminary TLC analysis of the transformation products showed that out of the 40 blocked mutants, 3 mutants accumulated anisic acid, 4 mutants accumulated traces of anisic alcohol (IV) and anisaldehyde (V), and one mutant accumulated minute amounts of a compound with Rf of 0.08 along with quantitative amounts of a compound that did not migrate on the TLC plate (Rf = 0). The rest of the blocked mutants did not accumulate detectable products, and are presumably blocked after the aromatic ring cleavage, accumulating nonaromatic compounds. No intermediates were detected in control cultures containing only glucose. In the presence of t-anethole, three metabolic intermediates accumulated by the blocked mutants in high amounts, reaching almost a quantitative conversion. These intermediates were identified by a combination of TLC, GC, MS, and NMR (Table II). Identified compounds were t-anethole-diol (III) anisic acid (VI), and 4,6-dicarboxylate-2-pyrone (XIII). The1H NMR spectrum of III, presented in Fig. 5, exhibited small peaks that may belong to its stereoisomer. t-Anethole-diol may be formed by the epoxidation of the propene side chain of t-anethole (Fig. 3), followed by the opening of the epoxide by an enzyme or during the acidic extraction (29.Mohan R.S. Gavardinas K. Kyere S. Whalen D.L. J. Org. Chem. 2000; 65: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Anisic acid is the oxidized product of the propenyl side chain cleavage and is very likely to be further metabolized to protocatechuic acid (VIII). 4,6-Dicarboxylate-2-pyrone is most probably derived by spontaneous acidic lactonization of 2-hydroxy-4-carboxy muconic acid (X), a metabolite in the meta-cleavage pathway of VIII (30.Dagley S. Gunsalus I.C. The Bacteria. Academic Press, New York1986Google Scholar). One possible route for the formation of XIII in strain TA13 is given in Fig. 3. It is likely that mutant 57 lacks the activity of 2-oxopent-4-enoate hydratase (EC4.2.1.80), which converts 2-carboxy-4-oxo-3-hexenedioate (XI) to 2-carboxy-2-hydroxy-4-oxo-3-hexanedioate (XII) (Fig. 3).Table IIMetabolic intermediates accumulated from blocked mutants of t-anethole degradation pathwayMutantIntermediatesIdentificationaTLC analyses were performed on silica gel plates with a solvent system: chloroform/ethyl acetate/formic acid 85:15:1.

Although the exact role of collagen X remains unresolved, mutations in the COL10A1 gene disrupt growth plate function and result in Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (SMCD). With the exception of two mutations that impair signal peptide cleavage during α1(X) chain biosynthesis, SMCD mutations are clustered within the carboxyl-terminal NC1 domain. The formation of stable NC1 domain trimers is a critical stage in collagen X assembly, suggesting that mutations within this domain may result in subunit mis-folding or reduce trimer stability. When expressed in transiently transfected cells, α1(X) chains containing SMCD mutations were unstable and presumed to be degraded intracellularly. More recently, in vitrostudies have shown that certain missense mutations may exert a dominant negative effect on α1(X) chain assembly by formation of mutant homotrimers and normal-mutant heterotrimers. In contrast, analysis of cartilage tissue from two SMCD patients revealed that the truncated mutant message was fully degraded, resulting in 50% reduction of functional collagen X within the growth plate. Therefore, in the absence of data that conclusively demonstrates the full cellular response to mutant collagen X chains, the molecular mechanisms underlying SMCD remain controversial. To address this, we closely examined the effect of two NC1 domain mutations, one frameshift mutation (1963del10) and one missense mutation (Y598D), using both semi-permeabilized cell and stable cell transfection expression systems. Although able to assemble to a limited extent in both systems, we show that, in intact cells, collagen X chains harboring both SMCD mutations did not evade quality control mechanisms within the secretory pathway and were degraded intracellularly. Furthermore, co-expression of wild-type and mutant chains in stable transfected cells demonstrated that, although wild-type chains were secreted, mutant chains were largely excluded from hetero-trimer formation. Our data indicate, therefore, that the predominant effect of the NC1 mutations Y598D and 1963del10 is a reduction in the amount of functional collagen X within the growth cartilage extracellular matrix.

Although the precise role of collagen X remains ill-defined, it is proposed to provide structural support within the extracellular matrix of the epiphyseal growth plate during the transition from cartilage to bone (4.Kwan K.M. Pang M.K. Zhou S. Cowan S.K. Kong R.Y. Pfordte T. Olsen B.R. Sillence D.O. Tam P.P. Cheah K.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Collagen X is a homotrimer of three α1(X) chains (Mr 59,000), each composed of a collagenous domain (COL1)1 flanked at the carboxyl and amino termini by non-collagenous extensions, the NC1 and NC2 domains. Unlike the fibrillar collagens, the NC1 and NC2 domains of collagen X are not removed by proteolytic processing and are thought to direct supramolecular assembly of collagen X molecules into an hexagonal lattice that forms mat-like structures within the matrix (5.Kwan A.P. Cummings C.E. Chapman J.A. Grant M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Collagen X has also been observed as fine pericellular filaments associated with collagen II fibrils within the hypertrophic cartilage matrix (6.Poole A.R. Pidoux I. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2547-2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) leading to the hypothesis that functional roles for collagen X may differ according to the type of aggregate formed (7.Schmid T.M. Linsenmayer T.F. Connect. Tissue Res. 1989; 20: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Given the restricted localization of collagen X to growth plate cartilage, it is not surprising that COL10A1 mutations result in the cartilage defect, Schmid metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (SMCD). However, the precise consequences of mutations on collagen X biosynthesis, secretion, and supramolecular assembly and their impact on SMCD molecular pathology have not been fully elucidated and remain controversial. SMCD is an autosomal dominant disorder of the osseous skeleton resulting in a relatively mild phenotype associated with growth plate abnormalities (8.Warman M.L. Abbott M. Apte S.S. Hefferon T.

Boot-Handford R.P. J. Med. Genet. 1996; 33: 450-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SMCD mutations characterized to date include single base substitutions, nonsense mutations, and deletions resulting in premature termination (for review, see Ref. 10.Wallis G.A. Rash B. Sykes B. Bonaventure J. Maroteaux P. Zabel B. Wynne-Davies R. Grant M.E. Boot-Handford R.P. J. Med. Genet. 1996; 33: 450-457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from two missense mutations, which affect the putative signal peptide cleavage site (11.Ikegawa S. Nakamura K. Nagano A. Haga N. Nakamura Y. Hum. Mutat. 1997; 9: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the remaining SMCD mutations identified are localized within the NC1 domain. The association of carboxyl-terminal domains is an important step in assembly of fibrillar procollagens and a potential site for NC1·NC1 interaction was identified based upon alignment of collagen X and fibrillar procollagen carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequences (12.Brass A. Kadler K.E. Thomas J.T. Grant M.E. Boot-Handford R.P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 303: 126-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This conserved aromatic motif (amino acids 589–601 2Amino acids are numbered from the translation start site of pre α1(X) (34.Thomas J.T. Cresswell C.J. Rash B. Nicolai H. Jones T. Solomon E. Grant M.E. Boot-Handford R.P. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).) is indeed critical for the interaction of NC1 domains in vitro (13.Chan D. Freddi S. Weng Y.M. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13091-13097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Based on the observation that SMCD mutations prevented the formation of SDS-stable trimers, it was initially proposed that SMCD is caused by exclusion of mutant chains from α1(X) assembly, resulting in a 50% reduction in functional collagen X within the growth plate (14.Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In two cases, analysis of SMCD patient cartilage has shown that the presence of a premature termination codon results in nonsense-mediated decay of the mRNA derived from the mutant allele, supporting the haploinsufficiency model (15.Chan D. Weng Y.M. Graham H.K. Sillence D.O. Bateman J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1490-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 3J. F. Bateman, S. Freddi, R. Savarirayan, and G. Nattrass, unpublished data. Missense mutations, however, are unlikely to reduce mRNA stability, and studies have shown that α1(X) chains harboring certain point mutations can form stable homotrimers and co-assemble with the normal chain when expressed in semi-permeabilized cells (16.McLaughlin S.H. Conn S.N. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7570-7575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). An in vitrocompetition-based assay that is not dependent on the detection of SDS-stable trimers also showed that SMCD mutant chains could reduce the efficiency of normal α1(X) chain assembly (13.Chan D. Freddi S. Weng Y.M. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13091-13097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus the model emerging from these studies is that SMCD missense mutations exert a dominant negative effect on collagen X assembly. However, in vitro expression systems may not accurately reproduce the full cellular response to mutant collagen X mRNA or mutant α1(X) chains. Indeed, expression of collagen X in transiently transfected mammalian cells demonstrated that wild-type α1(X) chains were secreted efficiently whereas SMCD mutant α1(X) chains were present in only trace amounts within the media (17.Chan D.

It is not clear whether lack of mutant chain secretion was due to poor expression levels of the mutant α1(X) constructs or rapid intracellular degradation of α1(X) chains. In this study we have used two expression systems to evaluate the effect of the SMCD NC1 point mutation, Y598D (9.Wallis G.A. Rash B. Sweetman W.A. Thomas J.T. Super M. Evans G. Grant M.E. Boot-Handford R.P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 54: 169-178PubMed Google Scholar), and a frameshift mutation (18.Dharmavaram R.M. Elberson M.A. Peng M. Kirson L.A. Kelley T.E. Jimenez S.A. Hum. Mol.

Firstly, we carried out in vitro analysis of α1(X) chain assembly using a semi-permeabilized cell translation system (19.Wilson R.R. Bulleid N.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 139: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). Previous results have shown that bovine Y598D α1(X) chains, expressed in semi-permeabilized HT 1080 cells, assemble with similar efficiency to the normal chain when analyzed under low SDS concentrations (16.McLaughlin S.H. Conn S.N. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7570-7575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, in vitro translated human Y598D trimers have markedly reduced stability in comparison to the wild-type NC1 trimers, when analyzed under similar conditions (20.Marks D.S. Gregory C.A. Wallis G.A. Brass A. Kadler K.E. Boot-Handford R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3632-3641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Here we find that human α1(X) chains carrying the Y598D and NC1Δ10 mutations assemble less efficiently than the wild-type chain when expressed in semi-permeabilized cells. A similar pattern emerged when Y598D and NC1Δ10 α1(X) constructs were stably transfected into human bone (SaOS-2) cells. Although expressed at the mRNA level, mutant chains were retained within the cell and degraded whereas normal chains were secreted. To assess whether mutant chains could be incorporated into stable heterotrimers, we generated co-transfected cell lines expressing wild-type α1(X) chains together with either Y598D or NC1Δ10 α1(X) chains. Our results show that only trace amounts of mutant collagen X chains could be detected in the media, indicating that the predominant effect of these mutations is a 50% reduction in functional collagen X secretion. The production of full-length human α1(X) cDNA (pTM1-h10wt) and engineering of the SMCD mutants used in this study have been described previously. The wild-type α1(X) sequence was cloned into the T7-driven expression vector, pTM1, to enable transcription of mRNA in vitro(14.Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol.

The 10-bp deletion at position 1963 (NC1Δ10) introduces nonsense sequence from amino acid residue 623 resulting in premature termination at residue 671. The missense mutation Y598D generates a single amino acid (tyrosine to aspartate) substitution at residue 598 in the NC1 domain. Generation of full-length mRNA transcripts encoding wild-type and SMCD mutant α1(X) chains was carried out as previously described (21.Gurevich V.V. Pokrovskaya I.D. Obukhova T.A. Zozulya S.A. Anal.

Transcription reactions were performed for 4 h at 30 °C using 60 units of T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). RNA was purified using an RNA extraction kit (Qiagen) and stored at −70 °C in 10-μl aliquots containing 1 unit/μl RNasin (Promega) and 1 mm dithiothreitol. HT 1080 fibroblasts (ATCC-CCL121, American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. HT 1080 cells were treated with digitonin (Calbiochem) at a final concentration of 40 μg/ml to generate semi-permeabilized cells, which were used to supplement rabbit reticulocyte lysate-based in vitro translation as previously described (22.Wilson R. Allen A.J. Oliver J. Brookman J.L. High S. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Each translation contained 17.5 μl of Flexi-lysate (Promega), 1 μl of transcribed mRNA, 0.5 μl of 1 mm amino acids (minus methionine), 0.5 μl of 2.5m KCl, 1 μl ofl-[35S]methionine (1.5 mCi/ml, ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc.), 0.25 μl of 25 mm sodium ascorbate (Sigma), and 4 μl of semi-permeabilized cells. After translation for 1 h at 30 °C, semi-permeabilized cells were isolated by centrifugation and prepared for electrophoresis or treatment with chymotrypsin and trypsin. For the stable expression of His6-tagged collagen X in SaOS-2 cells we generated three expression constructs (pCEP4-wt-his, pCEP4-Y598D-his, and pCEP4-NC1Δ10-his) encoding α1(X) sequences flanked at the amino termini by the BM-40 signal peptide, a 6-histidine tag, and enterokinase cleavage site. Wild-type, Y598D, and NC1Δ10 collagen X sequences in the plasmid pGEM11 were amplified using primers HX-SP (5′-GCGGCCGCGTGTTTTACGCTGAACGATA-3′) and HX6 (5′-CGCCGGCGCTTTTCAGCCTACCTCCATA-3′) corresponding to nucleotides 56–75 and 2235–2216. PCR amplification was performed at 60 °C for 30 cycles, using 0.5 unit of Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), to generate a 2-kb fragment corresponding to the entire collagen X coding sequence lacking only the signal peptide. Additional sequences encoding NotI restriction enzyme sites were added to primers (sequence underlined) to enable subsequent cloning into the plasmid pCEP4-BM40-hisEK (23.Bengtsson E. Aspberg A.

This plasmid is derived from pCEP4 (Invitrogen), which encodes EBNA1, a gene that allows the plasmid to be maintained episomally, and the hygromycin resistance gene, which allows selection of positive transfectants. For the stable expression of c-Myc-tagged collagen X in SaOS-2 cells we used an expression construct (pRc/CMV-wt-myc) encoding wild-type collagen X sequence flanked at the amino terminus by the BM-40 signal sequence and the c-Myc epitope. To introduce the c-Myc tag (amino acid sequence EQKLISEEDL), we performed strand overlap extension PCR using the plasmid pGEM11 containing the wild-type collagen X coding sequence lacking signal peptide as template and specific primer sets incorporating the c-myc coding sequence (underlined). The primary rounds of PCR were carried out using primer sets MYC-F1 (5′-AAGCTTCTGCCTGCCGCCTG-3′) and MYC-R1 (5′-CAGATCCTCTTCAGAGATGAGTTTCTGCTCGCGGCCGCTAGCTAGCGGGG-3′) or MYC-F2 (5′-GAGCAGAAACTCATCTCTGAAGAGGATCTGGTGTTTTACGCTGAAGGATA-3′) and MYC-R2 (5′-CACCCAGGTCCTTCTGG-3′) to generate independent fragments with overlapping sequences. Second round PCR reactions were carried out with primers MYC-F1 and MYC-R2 using 5 ng of the primary PCR products as template. All PCR amplifications were performed at 62 °C for 35 cycles, using 0.5 unit of DeepVent polymerase (New England BioLabs). The recombinant PCR product was digested with NheI and XhoI. The resulting 220-bp fragment was purified using a Geneclean kit (Qiagen) and used to replace the corresponding sequence in a pGEM7 construct encoding the full-length wild-type collagen X sequence. Finally, this plasmid was digested with NheI and XbaI to release the entire 2.2-kb collagen X sequence, which was introduced into pRc/CMV (Invitrogen), an expression vector that encodes the neomycin phosphotransferase gene conferring resistance to the antibiotic G418. Constructs were sequenced (AmpliCycle, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to verify insertion of the c-mycsequence and to ensure insertion of the recombinant fragment in the correct reading frame. The human osteosarcoma cell line, SaOS-2 (ATCC HTB-85, American Type Culture Collection), was maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. SaOS-2 cells were grown to ∼70% confluence and transfected with the α1(X) expression constructs using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells transfected with pCEP4-wt-his, pCEP4-Y598D-his, and pCEP4-NC1Δ10-his were selected and maintained in growth medium containing 250 μg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells transfected with pRc/CMV-wt-myc were selected in growth medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) and individual G418-resistant colonies were isolated and expanded into cell lines. One cell line expressing wt-myc collagen X mRNA, as shown by Northern analysis, was used for protein expression analysis and subsequent co-expression studies. Co-transfection of wt-myc cells with pCEP4-wt-his, pCEP4-Y598D-his, and pCEP4-NC1Δ10-his was performed using the transfection protocol described above. Co-transfected cells were maintained in growth medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 and 250 μg/ml hygromycin B. RNA was prepared from transfected and untransfected cells cultured in individual 35-mm diameter dishes at ∼80% confluence, using the RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen). Heat-denatured RNA (3 μg/sample) was electrophoresed on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel containing 7% (v/v) formaldehyde, followed by capillary blotting onto a nitrocellulose filter for 16 h. The filter was air-dried, baked under vacuum at 80 °C for 1 h, and pre-hybridized for 2 h in 25% (v/v) deionized formamide, sheared herring sperm DNA (100 μg/ml final concentration), Denhardt's solution, 4 mm EDTA, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS. A32P-labeled probe was prepared using a 2-kb NotI-digest product of pTM1-h10wt (14.Chan D. Cole W.G. Rogers J.G. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4558-4562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), purified using the Geneclean kit (Qiagen). Hybridization of the probe was carried out at 42 °C overnight, and the washed filter was exposed to autoradiography film at −70 °C for 2 weeks. Biosynthetic labeling was performed by incubation of transfected cells grown to confluence in 6-well plates with 1 ml of methionine-free, serum-free DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 0.25 mm sodium ascorbate and 100 μCi of l-[35S]methionine (Tran35S-label, 1032 Ci/mmol, ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc.). When appropriate, sodium ascorbate was replaced with 0.3 mmαα′ dipyridyl (Calbiochem). In pulse-labeling experiments, cells were pre-treated for 1 h with 1 ml of methionine-free, serum-free DMEM, prior to addition of 100 μCi ofl-[35S]methionine. After 1 h in labeling media, cells were chased for a further hour in serum-free DMEM containing excess unlabeled methionine. Where indicated, media was supplemented with 5 μmclasto-lactacystin β-lactone (Calbiochem) or 1 μg/ml brefeldin A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After removal of the media, cells were lysed on ice using 1 ml of ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100) containing 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 2 mmN-ethylmaleimide (Sigma Chemical Co.). Cell lysates and medium samples were clarified by centrifugation (13,000 ×g for 20 min) at 4 °C, incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose (20% (w/v) in PBS) and centrifuged (13,000 × g for 2 min) to remove protein A-Sepharose-binding components. Immunoprecipitation of α1(X) chains was performed overnight at 4 °C in the presence of 10 μl of the appropriate antiserum and 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose (20% (w/v) in PBS). The rabbit polyclonal serum, raised to the NC1 domain of human collagen X, was a gift from Dr. Olena Jacenko (15.Chan D. Weng Y.M. Graham H.K. Sillence D.O. Bateman J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1490-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against the c-Myc epitope (clone 9E10), and His6epitope tags were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and used at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer and either prepared for SDS-PAGE analysis or treatment with chymotrypsin and trypsin. Cell lysates and media fractions were prepared for immunoprecipitation as described above. Primary immunoprecipitations were carried out at 4 °C for 5 h using anti-c-Myc or anti-His6 antibodies to isolate epitope-tagged α1(X) chains. Where indicated, samples were analyzed directly without performing a secondary immunoprecipitation. Otherwise, samples were resuspended in 50 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer containing 2% (w/v) SDS and heated to 65 °C for 10 min to elute α1(X) chains. Samples were centrifuged briefly (13,000 ×g for 30 s), and the supernatants were carefully removed into fresh tubes and diluted to 1 ml in immunoprecipitation buffer. Secondary immunoprecipitation was performed overnight at 4 °C using 100 μl of 20% (w/v) protein A-Sepharose in the presence or absence of anti-Myc or anti-His6 secondary antibodies, used at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. Protease treatment of semi-permeabilized cell translation products was carried out in 50 μl of CT/T digestion buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl and 10 mm EDTA) supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 to solubilize cells. Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 50 μl of digestion buffer without Triton X-100. Samples were incubated with a combination of trypsin (100 μg/ml) and chymotrypsin (250 μg/ml) for 2 min at 25 °C. Digests were stopped by addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml and two volumes of boiling SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were prepared for electrophoresis by boiling for 5 min in an equal volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 20% glycerol, and 0.025% (w/v) bromphenol blue) unless otherwise stated. All samples were resolved through 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels, and labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography, fluorography, or phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics, Storm) where indicated (see “Results”). Samples for immunoblotting were transferred to nitrocellulose and incubated for 1 h in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 in the presence of 5% (w/v) milk protein. The filter was probed with anti-KDEL mouse monoclonal antibodies (Stressgen Biotechnologies Corp.) at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml, and primary antibodies were detected using rabbit anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. Blots were developed by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In this study we used an in vitro translation system supplemented with semi-permeabilized human fibroblasts (HT 1080 cells) as a starting point to analyze the effect of SMCD mutations on assembly of the full-length human α1(X) chain. The α1(X) cDNAs encoding one SMCD point mutation, Y598D, and one frameshift mutation, NC1Δ10, were transcribed in vitro and translated in the presence of rabbit reticulocyte lysate supplemented with semi-permeabilized HT 1080 cells. Translation products were prepared for electrophoresis without heating and using 0.5% (w/v) SDS to detect trimers, which may dissociate under more harsh conditions (Fig. 1). A high proportion of wild-type α1(X) chains formed SDS-stable trimers, whereas both NC1 Y598D and NC1Δ10 mutant chains migrated essentially as monomers (lanes 1–3). This result indicates that the ability of the NC1 domains to form SDS-stable trimers is severely compromised by both SMCD mutations. Despite this apparent lack of electrophoretic stability, weak or transient association of mutant α1(X) chains within the endoplasmic reticulum may result in triple-helix nucleation and subsequent propagation. Therefore, normal and mutant α1(X) chains were synthesized in semi-permeabilized cells in the presence of ascorbate, and translation products were treated with chymotrypsin and trypsin to probe formation of correctly folded triple helices. As expected, a high proportion of wild-type α1(X) chains assembled into correctly aligned triple helices as evidenced by a protease-resistant band corresponding to the collagenous domain (lane 4). In contrast, a much smaller fraction of the Y598D and NC1Δ10 chains synthesized was protease resistant (lanes 5 and 6). Together, these results demonstrate, using established assays, that the SMCD-causing mutations Y598D and NC1Δ10 significantly reduce the efficiency of human collagen X assembly in semi-permeabilized cells. The chaperones and enzymes required for correct post-translational processing of collagens are present within the endoplasmic reticulum of semi-permeabilized HT1080 cells, allowing the initial stages of collagen folding and assembly to be reconstituted in vitro (16.McLaughlin S.H.

https://openalex.org/W2044121592,"We previously identified and purified from human (HeLa) cells a 66-kDa cruciform-binding protein, CBP, with binding specificity for cruciform DNA regardless of its sequence. DNA cruciforms have been implicated in the regulation of initiation of DNA replication. CBP is a member of the 14-3-3 family of proteins, which are conserved regulatory molecules expressed in all eukaryotes. Here, the in vivo association of CBP/14-3-3 with mammalian origins of DNA replication was analyzed by studying its association with the monkey replication origins ors8 and ors12, as assayed by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and quantitative PCR analysis. The association of the 14-3-3β, -ε, -γ, and -ζ isoforms with these origins was found to be ∼9-fold higher, compared with other portions of the genome, in logarithmically growing cells. In addition, the association of these isoforms with ors8 and ors12 was also analyzed as a function of the cell cycle. Higher binding of 14-3-3β, -ε, -γ, and -ζ isoforms with ors8 and ors12 was found at the G1/S border, by comparison with other stages of the cell cycle. The CBP/14-3-3 cruciform binding activity was also found to be maximal at the G1/S boundary. The involvement of 14-3-3 in mammalian DNA replication was analyzed by studying the effect of anti-14-3-3β, -ε, -γ, and -ζ antibodies in the in vitro replication of p186, a plasmid containing the minimal replication origin of ors8. Anti-14-3-3ε, -γ, and -ζ antibodies alone or in combination inhibited p186 replication by ∼50–80%, while anti-14-3-3β antibodies had a lesser effect (∼25–50%). All of the antibodies tested were also able to interfere with CBP binding to cruciform DNA. The results indicate that CBP/14-3-3 is an origin-binding protein, acting at the initiation step of DNA replication by binding to cruciform-containing molecules, and dissociates after origin firing.

Immunofluorescence studies using anti-cruciform DNA monoclonal antibodies showed that cruciforms are at a maximum number at the G1/S boundary (24.Ward G.K. McKenzie R. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M.

Acta. 1991; 1090: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In vivo mapping of ors12 by competitive PCR demonstrated that it acts as a chromosomal replication origin (42.Pelletier R. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 74: 562-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Among the ors, ors8 and ors12 have been characterized in detail. They both contain inverted repeats that give rise to a cruciform structure (43.Rao B.S. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Price G.B. Reitman M. Martin R.G. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 87: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Ref. 39.Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Price G.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 32/33: 1-14Crossref Google Scholar). Deletion analysis of ors8 and ors12 revealed that the minimal sequences required for origin function (186 bp for ors 8 (44.Todd A. Landry S. Pearson C.E. Khoury V. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and 215 bp for ors12 (45.Pelletier R. Mah D.C.W. Landry S. Matheos D. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 66: 87-97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) retain an intact IR. The IR present in ors8 is capable of extruding into a cruciform both in vivo (23.Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Frappier L. Khoury M. Price G.B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1837-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and in vitro (16.Pearson C.E. Zorbas H. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 46.Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Bell J. Mah D. McAlear M. Price G.B. DNA Replication: The Regulatory Mechanism. Springer- Verlag, Berlin1992: 107-116Google Scholar). In the present study, we analyzed the cruciform binding activity of CBP/14-3-3 as a function of the cell cycle, its association in vivo with replication origin-containing sequences (exemplified by ors8 and ors12), and its involvement in mammalian DNA replication. The in vivo binding of CBP/14-3-3 to ors8 and ors12 was analyzed using the formaldehyde cross-linking technique (47.Strahl-Bolsinger S. Hecht A. Luo K. Grunstein M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), followed by immunoprecipitation of protein-DNA cross-links with antibodies against the 14-3-3β, -ε, -γ, and -ζ isoforms. PCRs were then performed using the immunoprecipitated material as template. CBP/14-3-3 was found to associate specifically with ors8 and ors12, since DNA fragments containing these ors were enriched in the immunoprecipitate compared with other portions of the genome. Furthermore, higher binding of 14-3-3β, -ε, -ζ, and -γ isoforms to ors8 and ors12 was found at the G1/S border by comparison with other stages of the cell cycle. The cruciform binding activity of CBP was also found to be maximal at the G1/S interphase. In addition, the anti-14-3-3β, -ε, -γ, and -ζ antibodies were able to interfere with CBP-cruciform complex formation and inhibit the in vitro DNA replication of p186. The anti-14-3-3ε, -γ, and -ζ antibodies had a greater inhibitory effect on the in vitroDNA replication of p186 DNA than did the anti-14-3-3β antibody. The data suggest an involvement of CBP in mammalian DNA replication as an origin-binding protein. HeLa (S3) cells growing in suspension were synchronized by serum starvation and treatment with aphidicolin 2 μg/ml (23.Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Frappier L. Khoury M. Price G.B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1837-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and mimosine 400 μm (48.Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3715-3722Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). CV-1 cells growing in monolayers were cultured in minimal essential medium α (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) (termed “regular medium”) at 37 °C, as previously described (49.Mah D.C. Dijkwel P.A. Todd A. Klein V. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 807-818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For synchronization to the G0/G1 phase, 80% confluent CV-1 cells were placed in serum-free medium for 48 h. For synchronization to G1/S, S (50.Stephens R.E. Pan C.J. Ajiro K. Dolby T.W. Borun T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 166-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and M (51.Paulson J.R. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6064-6072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) phases, the procedure was modified as follows: 40% confluent CV-1 cells were treated with 2 mm thymidine (Sigma) for 12 h and then released for 9 h in regular medium without thymidine and subsequently incubated for 12 h with 2 mm thymidine and 400 μmmimosine (Sigma). For S phase synchronization, the cells were released from the thymidine/mimosine block for 4 h in regular medium. For synchronization to M phase, the cells were released from the thymidine/mimosine block in regular medium supplemented with 1 μg/ml of nocodazole (Sigma), for 14 h. Cell synchronization was monitored by flow cytometry. In vivo cross-linking was performed as described by Ritzi et al. (52.Ritzi M. Baack M. Musahl C. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24543-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) with some modifications. In brief, CV-1 cells, grown as previously described, were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline to remove all traces of serum, and then formaldehyde (1%) in warm minimal essential medium α without serum was added for 10 min. Cells were subsequently lysed (at 4 °C) in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 capsule of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by being drawn into and out of a 21-gauge hypodermic needle three times to effect lysis and dispersion of nuclei. Cell lysates were then layered over 4 ml of 12.5% glycerol in lysis buffer, and nuclei were pelleted by spinning at 750 × g for 5 min in a benchtop centrifuge. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer. Cross-linked or non-cross-linked cell nuclei were sonicated 10 times for 30 s each time, and the chromatin size was monitored by electrophoresis (53.Hecht A. Grunstein M. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 399-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This treatment generated fragments of ∼20 kb. To further reduce the chromatin size into smaller fragments of 1.5–3.5 kb, DNA was digested with SphI, HindIII, PstI, and EcoRI restriction endonucleases in NEB2 buffer (100 units of each; New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 6 h. These enzymes were chosen because they did not cut in either the origin or non-origin-containing sequences chosen. Sheared chromatin lysed extracts were incubated with 50 μl of protein A-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to reduce background caused by nonspecific adsorption of irrelevant cellular proteins/DNA to protein A-agarose beads (as described below). These cleared chromatin lysates were incubated, at 4 °C for 6 h on a rocker platform, with 50 μl of preimmune rabbit serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and 20 μg of anti-14-3-3ε (sc-1020), anti-14-3-3β (sc-628), anti-14-3-3ζ (sc-1019), anti-14-3-3γ (sc-731) rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-NF-κB p65 (C-20) goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-SC-35 (Sigma) rabbit monoclonal antibody. 50 μl of protein A-agarose, or protein G-agarose for anti-NF-κB p65 antibody, was added, and the incubation was continued for 12 h. The precipitates were successively washed two times for 5 min with 1 ml of each buffer: lysis buffer, WB1 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate), WB2 (as WB1 with no NaCl), and 1 ml of TE (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). The precipitates were finally resuspended in 200 μl of extraction buffer (1% SDS/TE). The samples were then incubated at 65 °C overnight to reverse the protein/DNA cross-links, followed by 2 h of incubation at 37 °C with 100 μg of proteinase K (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Finally, the samples were processed for DNA purification by passing them through QIAquick PCR purification columns (Qiagen). Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in electrophoresis sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol) and resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.), and probed with rabbit polyclonal anti-14-3-3ε (sc-1020), anti-14-3-3β (sc-628), anti-14-3-3ζ (sc-1019), and anti-14-3-3γ (sc-731) antibodies. Protein-antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using the Amersham Biosciences ECL system, with the anti-rabbit or anti-goat, respectively, secondary horseradish peroxidase-labeled conjugated antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). PCRs were carried out in 20 μl with one-two hundredth of the immunoprecipitated material using LightCycler capillaries (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the LightCycler-FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The PCR contained 3 mm Mg2+ and a 1 μm concentration of each primer of the appropriate primer set used: ors8 150, ors12 D2, EE′, or CD4 intron. Primer set ors8 150 and ors12 D2 were used to amplify a 150- or 251-bp corresponding genomic fragment of ors8 or ors12(see Fig. 2A). Primer set EE′ was used to amplify a 250-bp genomic fragment that was mapped ∼5 kb downstream of the origin of replication ors12 (see Fig. 2A). A control set of primers from the CV-1 CD4 gene (accession number AB052204 (54.Matsunaga S. Mukai R. Inoue-Murayama M. Yoshikawa Y. Murayama Y. Immunol. Lett. 2000; 75: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar)) was also used. The primer set CD4 intron amplifies a fragment of 258 bp from genomic CV-1 DNA. Primers were designed as 20–22-mers with ∼50% GC content. The sequences for the primers used are shown in Table I.Table ISequences of primersPrimerSequenceTANNEALING°Cors8150F5′-GACCCATAAAGGCAAAAGTACC-3′45ors8 150R5′-GGAAGATATTAAGATAGATGG-3′ors12 D25′-CCTGAGAGCAAAACTCTGGC-3′55ors12 D2′5′-CTTAAATCCTTGGCACCATC-3′E5′-GGAATTCTGTCTTAGGCAAT3′50E′5′-TGATATTGCCAATCAGGATC3′CD4 intronF5′-AGCTCTGTTCTGTATCTTTG-3′50CD4 intron R5′-CCACAGGCACTTTTATCTTC-3′ Open table in a new tab Genomic CV-1 DNA (9.3, 18.6, 27.9, 37.2, and 55.8 ng), used for the standard curve reactions (necessary for quantification of the PCR products) (see Fig. 2B), were obtained from total cell lysates of noncross-linked logarithmic 80% confluent cells. The quantification of the PCR products was assessed by the LightCycler (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) instrument, using SYBR Green I dye as the detection format (55.Pfitzner T. Engert A. Wittor H. Schinkothe T. Oberhauser F. Schulz H. Diehl V. Barth S. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 754-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The quantification program used a single fluorescence reading at the end of each elongation step. Arithmetic background subtraction was used, and the fluorescence channel was set to F1. No primer-dimers were detected that interfered with the quantification of the PCR products. Typically, an initial denaturation for 10 min at 95 °C was followed by 35 cycles with denaturation for 15 s at 95 °C; annealing for 10 s at 45 °C (primer set ors8 150), 50 °C for 15 s (primer sets EE′ and CD4 intron), or 55 °C (primer set ors12 D2); and polymerization for 15 s at 72 °C. The specificity of the amplified PCR products was assessed by performing a melting curve analysis after the PCR amplification. The fluorescence of the SYBR Green I dye bound to double-stranded amplified product declines sharply as the fragment is denatured. The melting temperature of this fragment was visualized by plotting the first negative derivative (−d F/d T) of the melting curve on the y axis and temperature (°C) on the x axis (see Fig. 2C). The melting curve analysis cycle has a first segment set at 95 °C for 0 s and a temperature transition of 20 °C/s; a second segment set at 45 °C, 50 °C, or 55 °C (depending on the annealing temperature of the primer set used) with a temperature transition rate of 20 °C/s; and, finally, a third segment set at 95 °C with a temperature transition rate set at 0.2 °C/s. PCR products were also separated on 2% agarose gels, visualized with ethidium bromide, and photographed with an Eagle Eye apparatus (Speed Light/BT Sciencetech-LT1000) (see Fig. 3B). HeLa cells growing in suspension were synchronized by serum starvation and treatment with aphidicolin or mimosine (as described above). Extracts were prepared as before (41.Pearson C. Frappier L. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) from arrested and released cells as well as cells in G0 and log phases (see FACS analysis, Fig. 5B). Bandshift reactions were performed with 32P-labeled isolated cruciform (pRGM21 × pRGM29; Ref. 25.Ward G.K. Shihab-El-Deen A. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Price G.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 195: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), on ice for 15 min, with an equal number of cells' worth of nuclear extract from the indicated treatment. In vitro DNA replication assays were performed as previously described (41.Pearson C. Frappier L. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Approximately 100 μg of total HeLa cell extracts were preincubated with either 20 μg of anti-14-3-3β, anti-14-3-3ε, anti-14-3-3γ, anti-14-3-3ζ antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), normal rabbit serum (NRS) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or hypotonic solution (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 5 mm KAc, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) or with a combination of three (7 μg each of anti-14-3-3ε, anti-14-3-3γ, and anti-14-3-3ζ) or four (5 μg each of anti-14-3-3β, anti-14-3-3ε, anti-14-3-3γ, and anti-14-3-3ζ) anti-14-3-3 antibodies for 20 min on ice. This mixture was used to replicate in vitro (41.Pearson C. Frappier L. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) 150 ng of p186 plasmid DNA (44.Todd A. Landry S. Pearson C.E. Khoury V. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Unmethylated pBluescript KS+ was included in each of the reactions as an internal control for differences in DNA recovery and completeness of the DpnI digestion. One-third of the replication products were digested with 1.5 units of DpnI for 60 min. Both undigested and digested products were resolved by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel in 1× TAE buffer at 50 V for 15 h; then the dried gel was exposed to an imaging plate for 6 h, and the DpnI-resistant bands (forms II and III) were quantified by densitometric measurements using Image Gauche (Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.). The results were normalized for the amount of DNA recovered from the in vitro replication assay and for the amount loaded on the agarose gel by quantitative analysis of the amount of radionucleotide incorporated in the unmethylated pBluescript KS+ propagated in dam(−) bacteria cells. This incorporation was due to DNA repair, since this plasmid did not contain a mammalian origin of DNA replication. Also, the unmethylated plasmid cannot be digested by DpnI, since DpnI cleaves only fully methylated DNA. In addition, a reaction with methylated pBR322, a plasmid that does not contain a mammalian origin of DNA replication, was also performed to show that the observed DpnI-resistant bands (forms II and III) wer"
https://openalex.org/W2058700638,"TRAP (t rp RNA-binding attenuation protein) is an RNA-binding protein that regulates expression of the tryptophan biosynthetic genes in Bacillus subtilis by binding to RNA targets that contain multiple GAG and UAG repeats. TRAP is composed of 11 identical subunits arranged symmetrically in a ring. The secondary structure of the protein consists entirely of antiparallel β-sheets, β-turns, and loops. We show here that the TRAP 11-mer can be reversibly denatured into unfolded monomers by guanidine hydrochloride. Removing the denaturant allows the protein to spontaneously renature into fully functional 11-mers. Based on this finding, we developed a subunit mixing method to hybridize wild-type and mutant subunits into heteromeric 11-mers by denaturation followed by subunit mixing renaturation. This method allows the study of subunit cooperativity in protein-ligand interaction such as RNA binding. Our data further support and extend the previously proposed two-step model for RNA binding to TRAP by showing that the initiation of binding requires at least one fully active subunit in the protein combined with one fully functional repeat in the RNA. The initiation complex tethers the RNA on the protein, thus allowing cooperative interaction with the remainder of the repeats.

In Bacillus subtilis, expression of the tryptophan biosynthetic (trp) genes is negatively regulated by the trp RNA-binding attenuation protein TRAP. In the presence of excess tryptophan, TRAP binds to several RNA targets that each contain between 9 and 11 (G/U)AG repeats usually separated by 2 or 3 nonconserved nucleotides (1.Antson A.A.

TRAP binding to the leader region of trp operon read-through transcripts alters the RNA structure so as to sequester the trpE Shine-Dalgarno sequence (9.Du H. Babitzke P. J. Biol.

TRAP consists of 11 identical subunits (75 amino acids each) arranged in a symmetric ring termed the β-wheel (Fig. 1) (1.Antson A.A. Otridge J. Brzozowski A.M. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Wilson K.S. Smith T.M. Yang M. Kurecki T. Gollnick P. Nature. 1995; 374: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The β-wheel consists of 11 seven-stranded antiparallel β-sheets, each made of four strands from one subunit and three strands from an adjacent subunit. The oligomeric structure is maintained by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds between β-strands. There are 11 tryptophan-binding sites on TRAP, each formed at the interface of adjacent subunits. Single-stranded RNA containing GAG or UAG repeats binds to TRAP by wrapping around the outer perimeter of the β-wheel forming specific hydrogen bonds between the bases of the RNA and amino acids of the protein (15.Antson A.A.

An 8.0 m stock solution was made and filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane filter (Nalgene). l-Tryptophan was obtained from Fisher. (GAGUU)11, an RNA containing 11 tandem repeats of the sequence GAGUU, was transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]UTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described by Baumann et al. (17.Baumann C. Otridge J. Gollnick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12269-12274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant TRAP proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography as described previously (18.Otridge J. Gollnick P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). All mutant proteins used in this paper have been described previously (19.Yang M. Chen X. Militello K. Hoffman R. Fernandez B. Baumann C. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 696-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1280 m−1cm−1 and confirmed by the BCA protein assay (Pierce) and SDS gel electrophoresis with comparisons to TRAP standards of known concentration. Tryptophan binding to TRAP was analyzed by equilibrium dialysis using [14C]l-tryptophan (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (1.Antson A.A. Otridge J. Brzozowski A.M. Dodson E.J.

RNA binding affinity in the presence of excess l-tryptophan (1 mm) was measured using a modification of the filter binding assay described by Baumann et al. (17.Baumann C. Otridge J. Gollnick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12269-12274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). TRAP was denatured in ≥4.0m GdnHCl for at least 30 min at room temperature. Denatured TRAP was renatured by dialysis against 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) overnight. When comparing the denaturation and renaturation pathways, we started with the same concentration of TRAP in either 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) or in 6.0m GdnHCl. The samples were diluted with either 8.0m GdnHCl or phosphate buffer, respectively, to the desired final concentration of GdnHCl and incubated at least 2 h. Various ratios of mutant and wild-type TRAP proteins were mixed together in GdnHCl for at least 2 h. The mixtures were then dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) overnight. The recovered samples were electrophoresed on 9% native polyacrylamide gels using a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean II system at 30 mA for 4.5 h. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and photographed with a Kodak DC290 digital camera. The gel images were analyzed by GeneImager software (Scanalytics Inc). CD spectra were obtained on a JASCO model J-700 spectropolarimeter. Samples containing 12 μm TRAP 11-mer were scanned in 1-mm quartz cuvettes at room temperature. Spectra of GdnHCl at the appropriate concentrations were subtracted as background. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were carried out using a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge using an AnTi-60 rotor. The samples were loaded at set GdnHCl concentrations into cells with six channel centerpieces. Equilibrium was attained at 10,000, 15,000, and 20,000 rpm at 20 °C. Buffer density was calculated using the method of Laue et al. (20.Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, United Kingdom1991: 90-125Google Scholar); contribution to the partial specific volume caused by the presence of high concentrations of GdnHCl was accounted for using the method of Arakawa and Timasheff (21.Arakawa T. Timasheff S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5924-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The whole cell molecular mass Mw,app0 was determined using the program MSTAR (22.Cölfen H. Harding S. Eur. Biophys. J. 1997; 25: 333-346Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The M* function is an operational point average molecular mass given by the following equation. C(r)−CaM*(r)=kCa(r2−a2)+2kr∫ar[C(r)−Ca]drEquation 1 where C(r) is the concentration at radius r, Ca is the concentration at the radial position of the meniscus, a, M* is the operational point average molecular mass, k = (1 − - vρ)ω2/2RT, where- v is the partial specific volume, ρ is the density, ω is the angular velocity, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the thermodynamic temperature. Size exclusion chromatography was performed using a Biosep SEC-S2000 size exclusion column (7.8 × 300 mm; Phenomenex) and a PerkinElmer Life Sciences series 8800 HPLC system. Samples containing 10–20 μg of TRAP in 50 mmsodium phosphate (pH 8.0) with various concentrations of GdnHCl were eluted by the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min−1. The detection wavelength was 215 nm. Previous studies have shown that the TRAP 11-mer is very stable and is resistant to denaturation by heat (23.Baumann C. Xirasagar S. Gollnick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19863-19869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or by urea or SDS. 3P. Gollnick, unpublished observations. Here, we show that TRAP can be reversibly denatured into unfolded monomers by guanidine hydrochloride. In native conditions, the CD spectrum of TRAP is typical of a β-sheet dominant protein (23.Baumann C. Xirasagar S. Gollnick P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19863-19869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 24.Tilstra L. Mattice W.L. Fasman G.D. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1996: 261-283Crossref Google Scholar), showing a positive peak at 205 nm and two negative peaks at 190 and 217 nm, respectively (Fig. 2A). This spectrum is consistent with the crystal structure of TRAP, which shows that the secondary structure is composed of β-strands connected by β-turns and loops (1.Antson A.A. Otridge J. Brzozowski A.M. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Wilson K.S. Smith T.M. Yang M. Kurecki T. Gollnick P. Nature. 1995; 374: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In contrast, the CD spectrum of TRAP in 6.0m GdnHCl (Fig. 2A) is indicative of a random coil, because it is nearly identical to that of poly-l-glutamine in random coil conformation (25.Adler A.J. Greenfield N. Fasman G.D. Methods Enzymol. 1973; 27: 675-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). We were unable to obtain a reproducible CD signal for TRAP below 210 nm in the presence of 6.0 m GdnHCl because of high background from the denaturant. The molar ellipticities at 217 nm for TRAP, 16.8 deg cm2 dmol−1 (native) and 5.8 deg cm2 dmol−1 (6.0 m GdnHCl) are consistent with reported values for β-sheet and for random coil proteins, respectively (24.Tilstra L. Mattice W.L. Fasman G.D. Circular Dichroism and the Conformational Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1996: 261-283Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, these results indicate that TRAP is unfolded into random coils in 6.0 m GdnHCl. When the GdnHCl is removed by dialyzing the samples in sodium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 8.0), the CD spectrum of the protein is, within experimental error, identical to that of native TRAP (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the secondary structure of the protein has been renatured. To follow unfolding/refolding of the secondary structure of TRAP by GdnHCl, we collected CD spectra at various concentrations of denaturant. The samples were prepared either by adding various amounts of 8.0 m GdnHCl to TRAP in phosphate buffer (denaturation) or by adding buffer to TRAP samples after incubation in 6.0 m GdnHCl (renaturation). The spectra obtained by both approaches were nearly identical at the same final concentration of GdnHCl, indicating that the unfolding of TRAP by GdnHCl is reversible. Fig. 2B shows the data for both renaturation and denaturation followed at 215 nm, which is the wavelength where the largest difference between the spectra in Fig. 2A was observed. The largest changes in ellipticity occur between 0 and 2.5 m GdnHCl, indicating significant loss of the secondary structure of TRAP over this range of denaturant. The spectra indicate that at ≥2.5 m GdnHCl the protein exists mainly as a random coil. To examine the oligomeric state of the protein during denaturation, we performed analytical ultracentrifugation of TRAP in various concentrations of GdnHCl. The predicted molecular mass of a TRAP subunit is 8,325 Da, which has been confirmed by mass spectroscopy (R. Philips, University of Georgia); thus the molecular mass of the TRAP 11-mer is 91.6 kDa. For each sedimentation equilibrium profile at a given concentration of GdnHCl, we obtained the whole cell molecular mass average, M0, app, which is plotted versus [GdnHCl] in Fig. 3A. M0, app falls from a value (93 kDa) closely corresponding to the 11-mer in 0.0 m GdnHCl to that corresponding to the monomer (8–9 kDa) in ≥3.0 m GdnHCl. These experiments further show that TRAP is an 11-mer in less than ≤0.5 m GdnHCl and monomers at ≥ 3.0 mGdnHCl. Similarly, the fluorescence anisotropy of TRAP, which measures the rotational diffusion of the molecule in solution, drops from 0.12 in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) to 0.02 in ≥2.5m GdnHCl (data not shown). The former value is close to that of bovine serum albumin (molecular mass, 66 kDa) or aldolase (molecular mass, 158 kDa) in phosphate buffer, and the latter value is similar to that of free tyrosine or tryptophan in either phosphate buffer or 6.0 m GdnHCl. Together, these experiments show that TRAP exists as an 11-mer in less than 0.5 m GdnHCl and monomers at ≥3.0 m GdnHCl. We also obtained similar results by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 3B). In the absence of GdnHCl (50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0), TRAP eluted as a single peak at 8.5 min, which based on molecular mass standards (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) corresponds to a molecular mass of 60–70 kDa. This result is consistent with previously published observations (18.Otridge J. Gollnick P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 26.Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) showing that size exclusion chromatography underestimates the molecular mass of native TRAP (91.6 kDa), which is probably due to the circular shape of this protein. At ≥3.0 m GdnHCl, the protein elutes as a single peak at 9.7 min correlating to monomers. At intermediate concentrations of GdnHCl between 0.5 and 3.0 m, we observe only the two peaks corresponding to the 11-mer and the unfolded protein (Fig. 3B). These findings support a two-state oligomerization model in which TRAP exists only as monomers or as 11-mer under the experimental conditions (27.Creighton T.E. Pain R.H. Mechanisms of Protein Folding. Oxford University Press, Inc., New York1994: 1-25Google Scholar). We next examined the effects of GdnHCl on TRAP function. Under native conditions, TRAP binds 11 l-tryptophan molecules cooperatively with an affinity (S0.5) of 5–10 μm and a Hill coefficient (n) of 1.5–2.0 (1.Antson A.A. Otridge J. Brzozowski A.M. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Wilson K.S. Smith T.M. Yang M. Kurecki T. Gollnick P. Nature. 1995; 374: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar,19.Yang M. Chen X. Militello K. Hoffman R. Fernandez B. Baumann C. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 696-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 28.Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12452-12456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). In the presence of >2.0 m GdnHCl, we were unable to measure any tryptophan binding to TRAP. However, after dialyzing samples treated with 2.0–6.0 m GdnHCl, the proteins showed similar tryptophan binding properties as the native protein. Similar results were also obtained when we examined the RNA binding properties of TRAP. TRAP binds to (GAGUU)11, an RNA containing 11 tandem repeats of the sequence GAGUU, with a Kd of 1 nm (4.Xirasagar S. Elliott M. Bartolini W. Gollnick P. Gottlieb P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27146-27153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). Again in the presence of >2.0m GdnHCl TRAP shows almost no detectable RNA binding activity, whereas after renaturation by dialysis, the GdnHCl-treated proteins bind RNA with similar properties as native TRAP. Together the studies described above demonstrate that we can use GdnHCl to denature TRAP into unfolded monomers and then reform fully functional 11-mers by simply removing the denaturant. These observations suggested that it could be possible to mix denatured subunits from two different types of TRAP proteins (i.e. mutant and wild type) and then reassemble heteromeric 11-mers composed of both types of subunits. If the two types of subunits (A and B) assemble randomly, then mixing subunits into 11-mers would result in 12 possible combinatory species: A11, A10B, A9B2 … AB10, and B11, and the relative abundance of each type of oligomer in the mixture would follow the binomial distribution. It is also possible that the subunits could assemble nonrandomly, with the most extreme case being total exclusion of hetero-interactions, in which case only the two original homo-11-mers (A11 and B11) would form upon renaturation. To follow subunit mixing, we took advantage of TRAP mutants in which the charge of the substituted residue is changed. Such mutants have altered mobility on native polyacrylamide gels as compared with wild-type TRAP. Examples of such mutant proteins that we have studied include K37A, K56A, R58A, and K71A in which either lysine or arginine residues on the surface of the protein are replaced by alanine at the position indicated. Previous studies showed that these mutant proteins exist as 11-mers (19.Yang M. Chen X. Militello K. Hoffman R. Fernandez B. Baumann C. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 696-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These substitutions result in negligible changes (<1%) in molecular mass but are predicted to change the isoelectric point of the mutant TRAP 11-mers by about 0.5 pH units, which we confirmed by isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Hence, the mobility differences of these proteins on native gels are most likely due to the difference in net charge of the proteins at pH 8.3. Fig. 5A shows an example of subunit mixing displayed on a native polyacrylamide gel, where wild-type and K71A mutant TRAP proteins were denatured in 5.0m GdnHCl, mixed in different ratios, and then dialyzed against 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) overnight. The recovered TRAP proteins have CD spectra very similar to those of wild-type TRAP and were shown to be 11-mers by size exclusion chromatography (data not shown). The K71A 11-mer has much higher mobility on the gel than wild-type TRAP (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 1 and 2). This result is consistent with the larger net negative charge of the K71A protein under these conditions (pH 8.0) because of 11 basic lysines having been replaced with neutral alanines. Comparable results were also observed for other TRAP mutants with similar substitutions (K37A, K56A, and R58A; data not shown). Renatured wild-type (lane 3) and K71A TRAP (lane 8) have mobilities similar to those of their respective native proteins (lanes 1 and 2). When the proteins created by mixing various ratios of wild-type and K71A subunits prior to renaturation are run on the gel, multiple bands are seen, with mobilities intermediate between the wild-type and K71A homo-11-mers (lanes 4–7). Examination of these lanes reveals a total of 12 different bands; two correspond to the wild-type and K71A homo-11-mers, and the 10 other bands are evenly spaced between the two homo-11-mers. Hence we propose that the 12 bands correspond to 11-mers containing different numbers of wild-type and K71A subunits and that the even spacing arises from the difference in mobility caused by a change of one lysine to alanine between adjacent species. When different ratios of wild-type and K71A subunits were mixed, different distributions of band intensities are seen (compare lanes 4–7). These observations suggest that when denatured wild-type and K71A subunits are mixed and renatured, pools containing various ratios of the 2 homo-11-mers and the 10 possible hetero-11-mers of different composition are created. To quantify the relative abundance of each type of 11-mer in the pools, we determined the intensity of each band in this gel by densitometry. If the assembly of each type of subunit into the 11-mers is random, then the composition of each pool of hetero-11-mers should reflect the starting ratio of both subunits. We found a strong correlation between the experimental data and the predicted distribution for random assortment of subunits based on a polynomial distribution (Fig. 5B; p < 0.001), indicating that wild-type and K71A TRAP subunits assemble randomly into hetero-11-mers. The presence or absence of tryptophan had no apparent effect on subunit mixing (data not shown). We also observed similar distribution patterns for mixing K37A, K56A, or R58A with wild-type TRAP (data not shown). We then tested the concentration of GdnHCl required for subunit mixing by comparing the ratio of homo-11-mers to hetero-11-mers after incubating for 2 h in the denaturant, followed by dialysis and native gel electrophoresis (data not shown). We were unable to see mixing below 0.5 m GdnHCl. There was partial mixing in 0.5–3.0 m GdnHCl, and with ≥3.0 m GdnHCl complete random mixing occurred (data not shown). These observations correlate well with our results from size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation (Fig. 3). Hence we conclude that subunit mixing into heteromeric 11-mers occurs only after the TRAP 11-mers are denatured into unfolded monomers and that refolding and random assembly then occur de novo. In the three-dimensional structure of TRAP, Lys71 is located distant from the tryptophan binding and RNA binding sites (15.Antson A.A. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Greaves R.B. Chen X. Gollnick P. Nature. 1999; 401: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and previous studies have shown that the K71A mutant protein is fully functional in vivo (19.Yang M. Chen X. Militello K. Hoffman R. Fernandez B. Baumann C. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 696-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We confirmed that the K71A homo-11-mer has biochemical properties nearly identical to those of wild-type TRAP in vitro (data not shown). Moreover, we found that all heteromeric mixtures of wild-type and K71A TRAP had affinities and specificities for binding RNA (Table I) and tryptophan (data not shown) similar to those of wild-type TRAP. These studies further confirm that our denaturation/renaturation method yields fully functional 11-mers when subunits from active proteins are used.Table IRNA binding affinity of wild type and mutant TRAP hetero-11-mer mixturesWTMutantKd to (GAGUU)11 RNAWT-K71AWT-K56A%nm10002.01.0 90101.1 80201.53.0 70303.1 60401.54.3 40601.48.0 20803.515.3 109025.55953301002.6NBaNB indicates no detectable binding activity up to 5 μm mutant TRAP.a NB indicates no detectable binding activity up to 5 μm mutant TRAP. Open table in a new tab We then examined the activities of heteromeric 11-mers composed of wild-type and mutant subunits defective in RNA binding. Our previous studies identified several mutant TRAP proteins that are severely defective in RNA binding but fully functional for tryptophan binding, including K37A, K56A, and R58A (19.Yang M. Chen X. Militello K. Hoffman R. Fernandez B. Baumann C. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 696-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Substituting Lys56with alanine (K56A) is predicted to disrupt 11 hydrogen bonds between (GAGUU)11 and the protein because the Lys56side chain from each subunit forms a hydrogen bond with O6of the third G in each GAG repeat in the crystal structure (15.Antson A.A. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Greaves R.B. Chen X. Gollnick P. Nature. 1999; 401: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Binding of K56A TRAP to (GAGUU)11 is undetectable using up to 5 μm protein, whereas wild-type TRAP binds this RNA with a Kd of 1 nm (Table I). By mixing different ratios of wild-type and K56A TRAP subunits, we generated eight pools of TRAP heteromers (Table I). Each pool contains a different mixture of hetero-11-mers containing between 0 and 11 lysines at position 56, and the abundance of each hetero-11-mer species varies with the input ratio of the two types of monomers based on random assortment. Rather than attempt to separate the different hetero-11-mers, we examined the RNA and tryptophan binding properties of each pool (Table I). All eight pools of hetero-11-mers exhibited similar tryptophan binding properties to wild-type TRAP (S0.5 = 5–10 μm and n = 1.4 to 1.6; data not shown). In contrast, as the percentage of wild-type subunits in the mixtures decreased from 100 to 5%, the affinity of each pool for (GAGUU)11 RNA decreased from 1 to 33 nm (Table I). Surprisingly, heteromeric mixtures containing only 5 or 10% wild-type TRAP displayed apparent Kdvalues of 25.5 and 33 nm, respectively (Table I), whereas we observed no detectable binding with up to 5 μm K56A homo-11-mer. The hetero-11-mers in these pools are predicted to have an average of ∼1 wild-type subunit. Hence these results suggest that the presence of very few wild-type subunits in an 11-mer dramatically stabilizes the interaction with RNA as compared with having none. Our studies show that GdnHCl reversibly denatures the folded TRAP 11-mer into unfolded monomers. Because the molecular structure of TRAP in the absence of bound tryptophan has not yet been determined, the oligomeric state of the apo-protein has not been conclusively demonstrated. However, the analytical ultracentrifugation studies presented here show that apo-TRAP remains an 11-mer (apparent molecular mass, 93 kDa). This conclusion is further supported by nanospray mass spectrometry studies, which show that in the absence or presence of tryptophan TRAP exists solely as an 11-mer. 4D. Scott, unpublished results. At ≥ 3.0m GdnHCl, CD studies show that the secondary structure of TRAP is unfolded into random coils. In addition, data from analytical ultracentrifugation, fluorescence anisotropy, and size exclusion chromatography demonstrate that the TRAP 11-mer is dissociated into monomers at ≥3.0 m GdnHCl. Removing GdnHCl not only refolds the overall secondary structure and oligomerization of TRAP, it also restores the biochemical activities of tryptophan and RNA binding of the protein. Mixing denatured subunits from two different types of TRAP proteins (mutant and wild type) and then removing the denaturant result in random assembly of the subunits into hetero-11-mers (Fig. 5A). The observation that assembly of the subunits into 11-mers is random indicates that assembly only occurs with individual subunits. We limited our studies to mutant proteins in which the altered residues are on the surface of the protein and do not interact with neighboring subunits (1.Antson A.A. Otridge J. Brzozowski A.M. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Wilson K.S. Smith T.M. Yang M. Kurecki T. Gollnick P. Nature. 1995; 374: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), including Lys37, Lys56, Arg58, and Lys71. The observation that subunits from all four of these mutant proteins can randomly assemble with wild-type monomers indicates that none of these residues are critical for the processes of folding and oligomerization. In B. subtilis, wild-type TRAP down-regulates expression of trp genes in the presence of excess tryptophan, whereas mutations that alter residues involved in RNA binding, such as K56A, eliminate regulation (1.Antson A.A. Otridge J. Brzozowski A.M. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Wilson K.S. Smith T.M. Yang M. Kurecki T. Gollnick P. Nature. 1995; 374: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Coexpressing increasing levels of K56A and a fixed level of WT TRAP in B. subtilis reduced but did not completely eliminate regulation of the trp genes in response to tryptophan. 5Y. Chen and P. Gollnick, unpublished observations. These observations suggest that hetero-11-mers consisting of WT and K56A subunits can also be formed in vivo. We obtained insights into the mechanism by which TRAP binds RNA from our experiments with mixed hetero-11-mers of wild-type and K56A TRAP. The most surprising finding was that very low percentages of wild-type subunits (5–10%) in the mixture dramatically enhanced the observed affinity of the mixed hetero-11-mers for RNA as compared with the K56A mutant protein (Table I). One explanation for these findings could be that the observed RNA binding affinity is due to the presence of a small fraction of wild-type homo-11-mers or hetero-11-mers with large numbers of wild-type subunits within these pools. The measured affinity for any pool is the weighted average of the dissociation constants for each of the TRAP hetero-11-mer species comprising the pool. Moreover, our results show that subunit mixing into these heteromers is based on random assortment, and the composition of each pool is predicted by a binomial distribution (Fig. 5B). Hence, for example, wild-type homo-11-mers (WT11) with a Kdof 1 nm are predicted to be less than 1:1011 or 1:1014 of the populations in the pools made from 90 or 95% K56A (WT11 = 0.111 or = 0.0511). Native gel analysis of these pools is consistent with this prediction, because all the visible bands are positioned just above the band for the K56A homo-11-mer (data not shown). If wild-type homo-11-mers were the sole contributor to the observed Kd of the pool with 10% wild-type subunits, then the predicted value would be 100 m (1/1011 of the pool with a Kd of 1 nm). Moreover, we observed an apparent Kd of 33 nm for the 5% WT, 95% K56A mixture (Table I) in which only about 1.5% of the 11-mers have more than two wild-type subunits. Together these findings suggest that TRAP 11-mers with as few as one or two wild-type subunits have relatively high affinity for (GAGUU)11 RNA as compared with the K56A homo-11-mer. The observed affinity is unlikely to be the result of interactions solely between wild-type subunits in the hetero-11-mers and the RNA because the binding of one or two GAG repeats to wild-type TRAP 11-mer is undetectable (29.Elliott M.B. Gottlieb P.A. Gollnick P. RNA. 1999; 5: 1277-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Moreover, this conclusion is not limited to Lys56 because we obtained very similar results with mixing subunits from other similar RNA binding mutants of TRAP, including K37A and R58A (data not shown). In a recent study, a similar phenomenon was observed when using nucleoside analogs to probe the TRAP-RNA interaction (16.Elliott M. Gottlieb P. Gollnick P. RNA. 2001; 7: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The 2′-OH of the ribose on the third G of each (G/U)AG repeat hydrogen bonds to the peptide NH of Phe32 in each TRAP subunit (15.Antson A.A. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Greaves R.B. Chen X. Gollnick P. Nature. 1999; 401: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Substituting all 11 of these riboguanosines with deoxyriboguanosine eliminated measurable binding of the resulting chimeric D/RNA to TRAP (16.Elliott M. Gottlieb P. Gollnick P. RNA. 2001; 7: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, the presence of just such a single riboguanosine in one repeat (with deoxyriboguanosine in the other 10 repeats) dramatically stabilized the complex yielding a Kd of 90 nm. This observation is similar to our findings with hetero-11-mers, in which we noted a dramatic increase in the stability of a complex with pools containing on average 1 wild-type subunit/11-mer (Kd = 20–30 nm) as compared with the mutant homo-11-mer (Kd≫5 μm). These observed differences in affinity cannot be attributed solely to the presence of one hydrogen bond in the complex or even to the participation of only one subunit or RNA repeat. We therefore propose that the presence of one fully functional subunit or RNA triplet repeat serves to facilitate the interactions of the remaining mutant subunits or repeats in the complex. This conclusion is supported by RNase protection studies demonstrating that all 11 triplet repeats were protected in D/RNA chimeras that contain only one or two fully functional repeats. 6P. Li and P. Gollnick, unpublished observations. the position of the deoxyriboguanosine substitutions in the RNA had little effect on the binding affinity to TRAP, suggesting that different arrangements of one or two active subunits in the circular 11-mer is unlikely to significantly affect the affinity for RNA. Elliott et al. (16.Elliott M. Gottlieb P. Gollnick P. RNA. 2001; 7: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) proposed a two-step model for RNA binding to TRAP in which binding initiates with a single triplet repeat forming an initiation complex with the protein, followed by cooperative binding of the remaining repeats. Our studies of hetero-11-mers of TRAP further support and extend this model by showing that the initiation complex requires at least one fully active subunit in the protein combined with a fully functional repeat in the RNA. The initiation complex tethers the RNA on the protein, thus restricting its degree of freedom as well as placing the remaining repeats in the proper register to interact with their binding sites on the protein. Hence once the initiation complex has formed, imperfect binding units in either the protein or RNA are tolerated in forming the remainder of the complex. This two-step binding model has implications in the mechanism of TRAP-mediated transcriptional attenuation. During attenuation, TRAP binds the nascent trp leader RNA and affects formation of the transcription terminator, which in turn halts RNA polymerase. This binding must occur within a very short period of time before RNA polymerase passes the terminator. Hence the kinetics of both initiation and propagation of TRAP-RNA interaction relative to the process of transcription elongation are critical for the efficiency of attenuation regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2079191599,"Integrase (IN) catalyzes the insertion of retroviral DNA into chromosomal DNA of a host cell and is one of three virus-encoded enzymes that are required for replication. A library of monoclonal antibodies against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) IN was raised and characterized in our laboratory. Among them, monoclonal antibody (mAb) 33 and mAb32 compete for binding to the C-terminal domain of the HIV-1 IN protein. Here, we show that mAb33 is a strong inhibitor of IN catalytic activity, whereas mAb32 is only weakly inhibitory. Furthermore, as the Fab fragment of mAb32 had no effect on IN activity, inhibition by this mAb may result solely from its bivalency. In contrast, Fab33 did inhibit IN catalytic activity, although bivalent binding by mAb33 may enhance the inhibition. Interaction with Fab33 also prevented DNA binding to the isolated C-terminal domain of IN. Results from size-exclusion chromatography, gel electrophoresis, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometric analyses revealed that multiple Fab33·IN C-terminal domain complexes exist in solution. Studies using heteronuclear NMR showed a steep decrease in1H-15N cross-peak intensity for 8 residues in the isolated C-terminal domain upon binding of Fab33, indicating that these residues become immobilized in the complex. Among them, Ala239 and Ile251 are buried in the interior of the domain, whereas the remaining residues (Phe223, Arg224, Tyr226, Lys244, Ile267, and Ile268) form a contiguous, solvent-accessible patch on the surface of the protein likely including the epitope of Fab33. Molecular modeling of Fab33 followed by computer-assisted docking with the IN C-terminal domain suggested a structure for the antibody-antigen complex that is consistent with our experimental data and suggested a potential target for anti-AIDS drug design. Integrase (IN) catalyzes the insertion of retroviral DNA into chromosomal DNA of a host cell and is one of three virus-encoded enzymes that are required for replication. A library of monoclonal antibodies against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) IN was raised and characterized in our laboratory. Among them, monoclonal antibody (mAb) 33 and mAb32 compete for binding to the C-terminal domain of the HIV-1 IN protein.

The IN protein comprises three distinct regions known as the N-terminal, catalytic core, and C-terminal domains (see Fig. 1A) (2.Andrake M.D. Skalka A.M. J. Biol.

The isolated N-terminal domain (residues 1 to ∼50) assumes a three-helix bundle structure with a helix-turn-helix motif stabilized by Zn2+ coordination that stimulates enzymatic activity in vitro (4.Cai M.

Its NMR structure resembles that of the SH3 domain, a motif known to promote protein-protein interactions (16.Lodi P.J. Ernst J.A. Kuszewski J. Hickman A.B. Engelman A. Craigie R. Clore G.M.

Although the isolated C-terminal domain forms a homodimer in solution, only the catalytic core domain forms a dimer in the crystal structure of a two-domain derivative of HIV-1 IN that includes the core and C-terminal domains (19.Chen J.C.-H. Krucinski J. Miercke L.J. Finer-Moore J.S. Tang A.H. Leavitt A.D. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8233-8238Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). In such crystals, the C-terminal domain moieties are separated from each other by 55 Å, but are involved in a variety of contacts with C-terminal domains in adjacent unit cells. integrase human immunodeficiency virus type 1 monoclonal antibody surface plasmon resonance enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay heteronuclear single-quantum correlation matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight IN proteins must recognize and bind to both viral and host cell target DNAs. In the processing reaction, two nucleotides are removed from the 3′-ends of the viral DNA. These new 3′-ends are then joined to phosphorus atoms in the backbone of both strands of the target DNA in a concerted cleavage and ligation reaction. The strongest DNA-binding determinants of HIV-1 IN have been localized to the C-terminal domain, but such binding is sequence-independent. Despite intense efforts in many laboratories, the detailed mechanism by which IN interacts with host and viral DNAs remains unknown. To address this and other questions of structure and function, a library of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was raised against HIV-1 IN and characterized in our laboratory (20.Bizub-Bender D. Kulkosky J. Skalka A.M. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1994; 10: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Several of these mAbs inhibit the enzymatic activities of IN in vitro. Among these, mAb17 binds to the N-terminal domain, mAb4 binds to the catalytic core, and mAb32 and mAb33 bind to the C-terminal domain of IN (see Fig. 1A). Details of the binding of the N-terminal domain to the inhibitory mAb17 have been reported (21.Yi J. Arthur J.W. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38739-38748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); its epitope was mapped to a relatively neutral surface of the dimeric N-terminal domain, likely to be involved in protein-protein interaction. Here, we describe detailed binding studies and structural analyses of the interaction of the C-terminal domain-specific mAb33. We show that binding of Fab33 prevented the interactions of the C-terminal domain with DNA substrates and also inhibited the enzymatic activity of full-length IN, whereas binding of Fab32 produced neither effect. The epitope recognized by Fab33 was mapped to the three-dimensional structure of IN-(220–270) using heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy and computer-assisted molecular modeling. Construction of plasmid pET29b, encoding wild-type HIV-1 IN, IN-F185K/C280S, and IN-3CS (with three Cys → Ser substitutions at positions 56, 65, and 280), was reported previously (13.Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16196-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 14.Asante-Appiah E. Seeholzer S.H. Skalka A.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8458-8468Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For NMR experiments, the protein expression vectors pET28b/IN-(220–270) and pET28b/IN-(220–288) were prepared by inserting sequences encoding amino acids 220–270 and 220–288 of HIV-1 IN, respectively, into plasmid pET28b (Novagen, Madison, WI) as described (21.Yi J. Arthur J.W. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38739-38748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The products include four expression plasmid-encoded amino acids (GSHM) at their N termini, which remain after thrombin cleavage to remove the His6 tag. 15N-Labeled IN-(220–270) and 2H,15N-labeled IN-(220–288) were purified from Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) grown in M9 minimal medium with [15N]ammonium chloride as the sole nitrogen source and in H2O or 99% D2O. As higher yield and better purification were obtained with IN-(220–288), this protein was used for NMR analysis of the mAb33 epitope. Procedures for protein expression and purification, monoclonal antibody preparation, and isolation of Fab fragments were reported previously (21.Yi J. Arthur J.W. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38739-38748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22.Yi J. Skalka A.M. Biopolymers. 2000; 55: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The effect of mAb32 and mAb33 on the enzymatic activity of full-length HIV-1 IN was determined by measuring both the processing and joining reactions using a 21-base pair oligonucleotide duplex that represents the viral U5 DNA end as substrate (13.Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16196-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Assay conditions are described in the relevant figure legends. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR; BIACORE) was employed to analyze the interactions between the isolated C-terminal domain of IN and DNA substrates. Double-stranded oligonucleotides representing either the viral U5 DNA end (20-mer) or a target DNA substrate (24-mer) with no sequence match with viral DNA ends were immobilized on the surface of a chip as described (15.Yi J. Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8458-8468Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To allow association, solutions of the IN protein were applied to a chip containing immobilized DNA. Dissociation of IN from the nucleoprotein complex was monitored in real-time after application of buffer to wash the chip. The kinetic rate constants for dissociation (koff or kd) and for apparent association (kon or ka) were obtained by fitting the real-time data, and the apparent dissociation constant was calculated as Kd =koff/kon (15.Yi J. Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8458-8468Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The HIV-1 IN-3CS protein was immobilized on 96-well high binding microtiter plates by applying a solution containing 1 μg IN/well in a total volume of 50 μl of Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl). After overnight incubation, 50 μl of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in the above buffer was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 2 h to block the remaining binding sites. The plates were subsequently washed with 200 μl of Tris-buffered saline four times, followed by addition of primary antibodies and secondary antibodies labeled with horseradish peroxidase. The standard protocol was then followed, and the relative binding efficiency of monoclonal antibody to the immobilized IN protein was determined by measurement of absorbance at 405 nm (13.Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16196-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 20.Bizub-Bender D. Kulkosky J. Skalka A.M. AIDS Res. Hum.

NMR spectra were recorded at 37 °C on a Bruker DMX 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm x, y, z-shielded pulsed-field gradient triple-resonance probe. Typically, each sample contained ∼0.5 mm IN-(220–288) dissolved in 95% H2O and 5% D2O at a final buffer concentration of 50 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 6.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA, which was the same as that used by Lodi et al. (16.Lodi P.J. Ernst J.A. Kuszewski J. Hickman A.B. Engelman A. Craigie R. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9826-9833Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Protein-mAb interaction was studied by recording 1H,15N HSQC NMR spectra (23.Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarine T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2439) Google Scholar) for each sample of IN-(220–288) mixed with Fab33 at Fab/IN ratios of 0.16:1.0, 0.35:1.0, 0.55:1.0, 0.75:1.0, and 0.98:1.0. To minimize line broadening due to dipole-dipole coupling, the IN protein was uniformly labeled with 2H in addition to 15N (24.Huang X. Yang X. Luft B.J. Koide S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Each1H,15N HSQC spectrum was recorded as a 2048 (1H) × 128 (15N) data matrix with acquisition times of 285 ms in t2 and 78 ms in t1. The data were acquired with 32 scans for each hypercomplex t1/t2increment with an interscan delay of 1 s. The total acquisition time was 3.5 h for each spectrum. The NMR data were processed using XWINNMR2 (Bruker) and analyzed using Felix2000 NMR processing software (MSI). The 1H,15N HSQC spectrum of IN-(220–270) was assigned on the basis of the work of Lodi et al. (16.Lodi P.J. Ernst J.A. Kuszewski J. Hickman A.B. Engelman A. Craigie R. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9826-9833Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and Clore. 2G. M. Clore, personal communication. Thirty-nine well resolved peaks in the HSQC spectrum of IN-(220–288) were assigned by comparison. (The remaining resonances were obscured by the signals from the C-terminal tail (residues 271–288).) As a qualitative measure of the line broadening due to addition of Fab33, we determined peak heights for resolved cross-peaks in the base line-corrected HSQC spectra. Peak heights show a more linear dependence on the concentration ratio of Fab33 to IN-(220–288) than peak volumes. Solvent-accessible surface areas were calculated using GETAREA Version 1.1 (Sealy Center for Structural Biology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX) (25.Fraczkiewicz R. Braun W. J. Comp. Chem. 1998; 19: 319-333Crossref Scopus (883) Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis was carried out as described previously (21.Yi J. Arthur J.W. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38739-38748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22.Yi J. Skalka A.M. Biopolymers. 2000; 55: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Slight modifications in experimental conditions are described in the relevant figure legends. The assay was performed on a Superdex 200/PC3.2 column (3.2 mm × 30 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) containing 300 mm NaCl. The column was calibrated with standard proteins of known molecular masses (Bio-Rad), thyroglobulin (670 kDa), γ-globulin (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (68 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), and myoglobin (17 kDa), using linear regression on a plot of log molecular mass versus elution time. Samples to be analyzed (each protein at 120 μm) were incubated for 30 min on ice prior to injection and eluted at 0.2 ml/min. The eluted proteins were monitored by measuring the absorbance at 280 or 220 nm for IN-(220–288). IN-(220–288) was mixed with Fab33 and incubated in the presence of 2.5 mm glutaraldehyde cross-linker in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5) and 500 mmNaCl for 30 min at 25 °C. Each protein was present at a final concentration of 28 μm in the 1:1 ratio reaction. Reactions were terminated by quenching with 40 mm glycine for 10 min prior to addition of loading buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE. Equal samples of each reaction were loaded on a 16% Tris/glycine gel prior to visualization by silver staining. Modeling of the Fv fragment of mAb33 was performed as described previously (21.Yi J. Arthur J.W. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38739-38748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) using PSI-BLAST to compare the sequences of the heavy and light chain variable domains with sequences of known structures in the Protein Data Bank (codes 1IBG and 1A7O, respectively). Sequence identity was 49% for the heavy chain and 62% for the light chain. Side chain coordinates were predicted with the SCWRL program (26.Bower M.J. Cohen F.E. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 1268-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). As described previously (21.Yi J. Arthur J.W. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38739-38748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) the program HEX Version 2.3 (27.Ritchie D.W. Kemp G.J.L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 39: 178-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) 3Available at www.biochem.abdn.ac.uk. was used to identify a reasonable structure for the complex. The calculations were started in a conformation with the antibody combining site and residues of IN-(220–270) (Protein Data Bank code 1QMC, Ref. 18.Eijkelenboom A.P. Sprangers R. Hard K. Puras-Lutzke R.A. Plasterk R.H. Boelens R. Kaptein R. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1999; 36: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) identified as potential points of contact, pointed toward one another. The proteins were then allowed to move in a 60° arc (±30°) in each direction and ±8 Å along the intermolecular axis to produce the best fit. The solvent-accessible surface area buried upon Fab·IN complex formation is calculated as the difference between the accessible surface area of complexed IN-(220–270) and free IN-(220–270). Our previous studies showed that the activity of HIV-1 IN is stimulated by preincubation with the divalent metal ion (Mg2+ or Mn2+) required for catalysis (13.Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16196-16205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Such stimulation is correlated with a conformational change that is blocked by the binding of mAb33 to the apoenzyme. mAb33 also inhibits the processing, joining, and disintegration activities of HIV-1 IN (14.Asante-Appiah E. Seeholzer S.H. Skalka A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35078-35087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our previous analyses also showed that mAb33 and mAb32 compete for binding to the C-terminal region of the HIV-1 IN protein (20.Bizub-Bender D. Kulkosky J. Skalka A.M. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1994; 10: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the binding of Fab32 has been mapped to specific residues in the C-terminal domain based on MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis combined with time-limited proteolysis (22.Yi J. Skalka A.M. Biopolymers. 2000; 55: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To further investigate the binding of mAb33, we first performed immunoblot analyses with full-length HIV-1 IN (residues 1–288) and four different truncated proteins: IN-(50–212) (the isolated catalytic core domain), IN-(50–288) (the catalytic core and C-terminal domains), IN-(220–270) (the C-terminal domain only), and IN-(220–288) (the C-terminal domain and the “tail”) (Fig. 1B). The results show that mAb33 bound only to fragments containing the C-terminal domain (amino acids 220–270) and that neither the C-terminal region of the core domain (IN-(50–212)) nor the tail of the C-terminal domain (IN-(271–288)) contributed significantly to recognition of mAb33, confirming and extending our previous observations (20.Bizub-Bender D. Kulkosky J. Skalka A.M. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1994; 10: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, for further analysis of the mAb33-binding site, we used IN-(220–270) and the more soluble IN-(220–288) interchangeably. To determine whether the effects on IN enzymatic activity are related to the ability of the bivalent antibodies to cross-link the protein, we compared the binding affinities and inhibitory activities of the intact antibodies (mAb32 and mAb33) with the corresponding Fab fragments (Fab32 and Fab33). ELISA studies revealed that mAb33 and Fab33 formed stable complexes with full-length HIV-1 IN-3CS, with half-saturation concentrations of 3.0 × 10−9 and 3.0 × 10−8m, respectively (Fig. 1C). In contrast, there was no significant difference in the binding of mAb32 and Fab32 to HIV-1 IN-3CS; half-saturation concentrations were 5.0 × 10−7 and 4.0 × 10−7m, respectively (Fig. 1D). However, these values are ∼10-fold higher than the dissociation constant determined for Fab33 and ∼100-fold higher than that of mAb33. Kinetic analysis using SPR showed that Fab33 formed a stable complex with IN-(220–270). The off-rate constant was 4.0 × 10−3 s−1; the on-rate constant was 5.0 × 105 s−1m−1; and the dissociation constant (Kd) was ∼8 nm. These data are consistent with results from ELISAs shown in Fig. 1C. The effects of the mAbs and Fab fragments on HIV-1 IN processing activity were tested by quantitation of the −2 cleavage (processing) product from a 21-base pair oligodeoxynucleotide duplex that represents the viral U5 DNA end. The results show that both mAb33 and Fab33 inhibited HIV-1 IN processing (Fig. 2A) and joining (data not shown) activities. The half-inhibition concentrations (IC50) of mAb33 and Fab33 were 0.18 and 1.8 μm, respectively. The observation that mAb33 exhibited ∼10-fold higher inhibitory activity than its Fab fragment is consistent with the difference observed in the binding affinities of mAb33 and Fab33 (Fig. 1C). We conclude that bivalent binding is not required for inhibition by mAb33, but may enhance the inhibitory effect. These results are consistent with our previous observations that intracellular expression of the single-chain variable region of this antibody (single-chain Fv33) in a target cell prevents HIV-1 infection (28.Levy-Mintz P. Duan L. Zhang H. Hu B. Dornadula G. Zhu M. Kulkosky J. Bizub-Bender D. Skalka A.M. Pomerantz R.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8821-8832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the in vivo activity of single-chain Fv33 is correlated with the ability of Fab33 to inhibit IN enzymatic activity in vitro. On the other hand, mAb32 had a weak inhibitory effect (IC50 ∼ 2.0 μm), and Fab32 had no detectable effect on the processing activity of IN (Fig. 2A), although the binding affinities of these two reagents for IN were approximately equal (Fig. 1C). Thus, the inhibitory activity probably reflects the ability of the bivalent mAb32 to hold two IN molecules together in a nonproductive complex. Binding of the isolated catalytic core domain of HIV-1 IN to duplex oligodeoxynucleotide DNA substrates was not detectable in our previous studies using SPR (15.Yi J. Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8458-8468Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In contrast, the quantitative analysis shown in Fig. 2B indicated a dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.5 μm for a duplex oligodeoxynucleotide representing the viral U5 DNA end in complex with the isolated C-terminal fragment IN-(220–288). The same Kd value was observed with IN-(220–270) (data not shown). These results indicated that as with mAb33 binding (Fig. 1B), the C-terminal 18-amino acid tail (amino acids 271–288) made no significant contribution to the stability of the DNA·IN-(220–288) complex. Furthermore, when a nonviral DNA substrate was immobilized, the Kd value measured was 1.7 μm, confirming that DNA sequence does not affect the affinity of the C-terminal domain interactions with DNA (29.Woerner A.M. Klutch M. Levin J.G. Marcus-Sekura C.J. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1992; 8: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 30.Vink C. Oude Groeneger A.M. Plasterk R.H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4125-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). As both mAb33 and mAb32 bind to the C-terminal domain of HIV-1 IN, we investigated whether these mAbs could affect the ability of IN to bind to DNA substrates. Results of SPR measurements indicated that binding of the C-terminal domain to an immobilized DNA substrate was inhibited by preincubation of the protein with Fab33 (Fig. 2C); the binding profile for Fab33 + IN-(220–288) was indistinguishable from that of Fab33 alone. Detailed studies at various Fab33 concentrations indicated that this inhibition increased with increasing Fab33/IN ratio (data not shown). Complete inhibition was achieved at a Fab/IN-(220–288) ratio of 1:1 (as illustrated in Fig. 2C) or higher (data not shown). However, if IN-(220–288) was preincubated with equimolar amounts of Fab32, we observed an increase in the signal (Table I). No such increase was observed upon preincubation of IN-(220–288) with a nonspecific mAb (mouse anti-MOPC21). The relative response/resonance unit increase observed in the presence of Fab32 can be explained by the higher molecular mass of the Fab32·IN-(220–288) complex compared with IN-(220–288) alone. These results suggest that the Fab32·IN-(220–288) complex can bind to the immobilized DNA substrate, whereas binding of Fab33 to the C-terminal domain of IN inhibits the protein-DNA interaction.Table IEffects of mAb33 and mAb32 on binding of IN-(220–288) to DNA substratesAntibodyRelative RUDNA binding%Model viral DNA None100+ Anti-MOPC2198 ± 3+ Fab330.2 ± 1.0− Fab32194 ± 10+Model target DNA None100+ Anti-MOPC21101 ± 5.0+ Fab330.0 ± 1.0− Fab32121 ± 8+Data were obtained from experiments similar to those described for Fig. 2C.

https://openalex.org/W2060346278,"2-Phenoxyethanol is converted into phenol and acetate by a strictly anaerobic Gram-positive bacterium, Acetobacterium strain LuPhet1. Acetate results from oxidation of acetaldehyde that is the early product of the biodegradation process (Frings, J., and Schink, B. (1994) Arch. Microbiol. 162, 199–204). Feeding experiments with resting cell suspensions and 2-phenoxyethanol bearing two deuterium atoms at either carbon of the glycolic moiety as substrate demonstrated that the carbonyl group of the acetate derives from the alcoholic function and the methyl group derives from the adjacent carbon. A concomitant migration of a deuterium atom from C-1 to C-2 was observed. These findings were confirmed by NMR analysis of the acetate obtained by fermentation of 2-phenoxy-[2-13C,1-2H2]ethanol, 2-phenoxy-[1-13C,1-2H2]ethanol, and 2-phenoxy-[1,2-13C2,1-2H2]ethanol. During the course of the biotransformation process, the molecular integrity of the glycolic unit was completely retained, no loss of the migrating deuterium occurred by exchange with the medium, and the 1,2-deuterium shift was intramolecular. A diol dehydratase-like mechanism could explain the enzymatic cleavage of the ether bond of 2-phenoxyethanol, provided that an intramolecular H/OC6H5 exchange is assumed, giving rise to the hemiacetal precursor of acetaldehyde. However, an alternative mechanism is proposed that is supported by the well recognized propensity of α-hydroxyradical and of its conjugate base (ketyl anion) to eliminate a β-positioned leaving group."
https://openalex.org/W2078157523,"Endo-β-xylosidase from the mid-gut gland of the molluscus Patinopecten is an endo-type glycosidase that hydrolyzes the xylosyl serine linkage between a core protein and a glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain, releasing the intact GAG chain from proteoglycan. In this study, we investigated GAG chain transfer activity of this enzyme, in order to develop a method for attaching GAG chains to peptide. Peptidochondroitin sulfate (molecular mass of sugar chain, 30 kDa) from bovine tracheal cartilage as a donor and butyloxycarbonyl-leucyl-seryl-threonyl-arginine-(4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide) as an acceptor were incubated with endo-β-xylosidase. As a result, a reaction product with the same fluorescence as the acceptor peptide was observed. High pressure liquid chromatography analysis, cellulose acetate membrane electrophoresis, and enzymatic digestion showed that this reaction product had the chondroitin sulfate (ChS) from the donor. Furthermore, the acceptor peptide was released from this reaction product after hydrolysis by endo-β-xylosidase. Therefore, it was confirmed that the ChS chain released from the donor was transferred to the acceptor peptide by the GAG chain transfer reaction of endo-β-xylosidase. The optimal pH for hydrolysis by this enzyme was found to be about 4.0, whereas that for this reaction was about 3.0. Not only the ChS but also the dermatan sulfate and the heparan sulfate were transferred to the acceptor peptide by this reaction. By using this reaction, the GAG chain could be attached to the peptide in one step. The GAG chain transfer reaction of endo-β-xylosidase should be a significant glycotechnological tool for the artificial synthesis of proteoglycan.

The GAG chain transfer reaction of endo-β-xylosidase should be a significant glycotechnological tool for the artificial synthesis of proteoglycan. At present, it is possible to mass produce extremely useful proteins due to remarkable developments in gene engineering. However, many reports have described that those proteins synthesized by gene recombination have few biophysical activities because of the incompletion or the lack of carbohydrate chains (1.Simonsen C.C. Shepard H.M. Gray P.W. Leung D.W. Pennica D. Yerverton E. Derynck R. Sherwood P.J. Levinson A.D. Goeddel V. Merigan T.C. Friedman R.M. Interferons. 25.

This is because DNA incorporated by gene recombination has no direct information about biosynthesis of the carbohydrate chains. Furthermore, because the elongation mechanisms of carbohydrate chains were complicated and not clear, it was very difficult to regulate them by gene technology. As a result, the method of attaching the carbohydrate chains to those proteins by glycotechnology plays an important role. Recently, the transglycosylation reaction of glycosidase has received much attention as a method for attaching the carbohydrate chains to protein (3.Takegawa K. Tabuchi M. Yamaguchi S. Kondo A.

Glycotechnol. 1997; 9: 339-354Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This reaction was regarded as a specific reaction using a reverse reaction of hydrolysis in which the carbohydrate moiety of the substrate was transferred to the hydroxyl groups of acceptor compounds (5.Trimble R.B.

Chem. 1989; 264: 19893-19897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the carbohydrate moiety could be transferred to the acceptor compound by block unit using this reaction, the transglycosylation reaction of glycosidase played important roles in glycotechnology. Yamamoto et al. (7.Yamamoto K. Fujimori K. Haneda K. Mizuno M. Inazu T. Kumagai H. Carbohydr. Res. 1997; 305: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) described that the complex type of oligosaccharide from human transferrin glycoprotein was transferred to peptidyl-N-acetylglucosamine using the transglycosylation of endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase from Mucor hiemalis. Ashida et al. (8.Ashida H. Yamamoto K. Murata T. Usui T. Kumagai H. Arch. Biochem.

All sugars mentioned in this paper are of D configuration chains by recombining different disaccharide units from various GAGs by using the transglycosylation reaction of bovine testicular hyaluronidase. However, there have been no reports of any enzymes capable of transferring the intact GAG chain. Therefore, we focused our attention on the endo-type glycosidase that released the intact GAG chains from proteoglycan, and we investigated a method for attaching the GAG chain directly to peptide using the transglycosylation reaction of the enzyme. glycosaminoglycan chondroitin sulfate chondroitin 6-sulfate dermatan sulfate heparan sulfate hyaluronic acid d-gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid t-butyloxycarbon 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide 7-amide-4-methylcoumarin 2-aminopyridine high pressure liquid chromatography proteochondroitin peptidochondroitin. All sugars mentioned in this paper are of D configuration Previously, we have purified and characterized three kinds of glycosidases that act on the linkage region of proteoglycan as follows: 1) endo-β-glucuronidase (12.Takagaki K. Nakamura T. Majima M. Endo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7000-7006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from rabbit liver, which liberates the glucuronyl galactose (GlcAβ1–4Gal) linkage; 2) endo-β-galactosidase (13.Takagaki K. Nakamura T. Takeda Y. Daidouji K. Endo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18558-18563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from the mid-gut gland of the molluscus Patinopecten, which liberates the galactosyl galactose (Galβ1–3Gal) linkage; and 3) endo-β-xylosidase (14.Takagaki K. Kon A. Kawasaki H. Nakamura T. Tamura S. Endo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 854-860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from the mid-gut gland of the molluscus Patinopecten, which liberates the xylosyl serine (Xyl-β1-O-Ser) linkage. All of these enzymes were endo-type glycosidases releasing the intact GAG chains from proteoglycan. Because endo-β-xylosidase cleaved the direct linkage, Xyl-β1-O-Ser linkage, between a core protein and a GAG chain, it was highly likely that the transglycosylation reaction of this enzyme would be an important tool for attaching the GAG chain to protein. In this report, we describe the transglycosylation (GAG chain transfer) activity of endo-β-xylosidase and our success in transferring the intact GAG chain to peptide using this activity. This is the first report on attaching the GAG chain to peptide enzymatically.

Activated protein C was purchased from Sigma. Hyaluronic acid (HA, average molecular mass, 41 kDa) was obtained from Research Center, Denki Kagaku Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Dermatan sulfate (DS, from pig skin, average molecular mass, 32 kDa) and chondroitin 6-sulfate (Ch6S, from shark cartilage, average molecular mass, 64 kDa) were purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Chondroitin (Ch, average molecular mass, 10 kDa) was prepared from chondroitin 6-sulfate by modification (15.Nakamura T. Takagaki K. Majima M. Kimura S. Kubo K. Endo M. J. Biol.

Sephadex G-50, Sephacryl S-200, and Sepharose CL-4B were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. DEAE-cellulose (DE32) was purchased from Whatman Chemical Separation (Maidstone, UK). Hyaluronidase (from Streptomyces hyalurolyticus), chondroitinase ABC (from Proteus vulgaris), chondroitinase AC-II (from Arthrobacter aurescens), and heparitinase II (from Flavobacterium heparinum) were purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo Co. Actinase E was purchased from Kaken Kagaku Co. (Tokyo, Japan). β-Galactosidase (from bovine testis) was purchased from Sigma. Endo-β-galactosidase and endo-β-xylosidase were purified from the molluscus Patinopecten as described previously (13.Takagaki K. Nakamura T. Takeda Y. Daidouji K. Endo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18558-18563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Takagaki K. Kon A. Kawasaki H. Nakamura T. Tamura S. Endo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 854-860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All other chemicals were obtained from commercial sources. Fluorescence (PA) labeling of the reducing terminals of GAGs (HA, Ch6S, DS, and Ch) was carried out as described previously (17.Kon A. Takagaki K. Kawasaki H. Nakamura T. Kojima K. Kato I. Majima M. Endo M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 132-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), based on the method of Hase et al. (18.Hase S. Ibuki T. Ikenaka T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). PA-GAGs were used as the standard marker of molecular weight for gel filtration HPLC. For detection of PA-GAGs, an excitation wave length of 320 nm and an emission wave length of 400 nm were used. The donor substrates for the GAG chain transfer reactions, proteochondroitin sulfate (Proteo-ChS), proteodermatan sulfate (Proteo-DS), and proteoheparan sulfate (Proteo-HS), were purified from bovine tracheal cartilage, pig skin, and bovine lung and purified using standard procedures described by Heinegard and Hascall (19.Heinegard D. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4250-4256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These procedures relied on extraction of proteoglycan with 4 m guanidine HCl in 0.05 mTris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing the following protease inhibitors: 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 mεamino-n-capronic acid, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 5 mm benzamidine HCl, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.36 mpepstatin subsequent purification by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose eluted in 7 m urea with salt gradients, and gel chromatography on Sepharose CL-4B. Proteo-ChS, Proteo-DS, and Proteo-HS prepared as above were dialyzed against distilled water and lyophilized. To obtain peptidochondroitin sulfate (peptido-ChS), peptidodermatan sulfate (peptido-DS), and peptidoheparan sulfate (peptido-HS), their proteoglycans were digested with actinase E in 0.1 mTris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 10 mmCaCl2, at 50 °C for 24 h. After digestion, the peptidoglycans were purified by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography and by Sephacryl S-200 chromatography. The molecular masses of the glycosaminoglycan chains of the peptido-ChS, peptido-DS, and peptido-HS were about 30, 32, and 19 kDa, respectively, which were estimated from gel filtration chromatography. After each peptidoglycan was digested by endo-β-xylosidase, the reducing terminals of the liberated GAG chains were labeled by PA. Then each PA-GAG chain was hydrolyzed in 2 n HCl at 100 °C for 2 h. PA-xylose was detected by HPLC as described previously (20.Takagaki K. Nakamura T. Kawasaki H. Kon A. Ohishi S. Endo M. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1990; 21: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The molar amount of the peptidoglycan was determined by the molar amount of the PA-xylose. To obtain two peptido-oligosaccharides (ΔGlcA-GalNAc(S)-GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-peptide and ΔGlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-peptide), peptido-ChS was digested with chondroitinase ABC and chondroitinase AC-II as described by Yamagata et al. (21.Yamagata T. Saito H. Habuchi O. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1523-1535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and purified by Sephadex G-50 column chromatography. To obtain peptido-xyloside (Xyl-peptide), peptido-ChS was digested with endo-β-galactosidase (13.Takagaki K. Nakamura T. Takeda Y. Daidouji K. Endo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18558-18563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by digestion by β-galactosidase (22.Distler J.J. Jourdian G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6772-6780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as described previously, and purified by HPLC. The typical GAG chain transfer reaction of endo-β-xylosidase was carried out as follows. The peptidoglycan (250 nmol) as a donor and the Boc-Leu-Ser-Thr-Arg-MCA (1 μmol) as an acceptor were incubated with 10 milliunits of endo-β-xylosidase in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 3.0, at 37 °C for 12 h. The reaction was terminated by immersion in a boiling water bath for 3 min. Hydrolysis reaction by endo-β-xylosidase was carried out as described previously (100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0 at 37 °C for 24 h) (14.Takagaki K. Kon A. Kawasaki H. Nakamura T. Tamura S. Endo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 854-860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC, Hitachi L-6200, Hitachi Co., Tokyo, Japan) connected to a fluorescence detector (model F-1150, Hitachi Co.) was used. HPLC analysis for the GAG chain transfer reaction was carried out with a TSK gel DEAE-5PW column (7.5 × 75 mm, Tosoh Co., Tokyo, Japan) under the following conditions. For solution A 0.2 m NaCl and for solution B 1 m NaCl were prepared; the column was equilibrated with solution A, and the ration of solution B to solution A was increased linearly to 100% over 60 min after sample injection; the flow rate was fixed at 1 ml/min; and column temperature was 30 °C. HPLC analysis for the enzymatic digestion products was carried out with Shodex OHpak SB-803HQ and SB-804HQ columns (both 8.0 × 300 mm, Seikagaku Kogyo Co.) in series, which was eluted with 0.2 m NaCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. HPLC analysis for the reaction product after endo-β-xylosidase treatment was carried out with TSK gel ODS 120 T (4.6 × 250 mm, Tosoh Co.) under the following conditions. Solution C was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and solution D was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 80% acetonitrile. The column was equilibrated with solution C, and the ratio of solution D to solution C was increased linearly from 0 to 60% over 60 min after sample injection; the flow rate was fixed at 1.0 ml/min, and the column temperature was 35 °C. The eluate was monitored on the basis of the fluorescence of Boc-Leu-Ser-Thr-Arg-MCA at excitation and emission wavelengths of 330 and 400 nm, respectively. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was done in 7.5% polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C. Protein was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Cellulose acetate membrane electrophoresis was carried out using Separax (6 × 22 cm, Jookoo Co., Tokyo, Japan) in 0.47 m formic acid, 0.1 mpyridine buffer, pH 3.0, at 1 mA/cm for 60 min (23.Mathews M.B. Decker L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 156: 419-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). For determination of fluorescence, membrane strips were cut into pieces 3-mm wide and then extracted with 1 ml of water. Staining of GAG on the cellulose acetate membrane was done with 0.05% Alcian blue in 70% ethanol. Samples were digested with the following enzymes: chondroitinase ABC (100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0) (21.Yamagata T. Saito H. Habuchi O. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1523-1535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), chondroitinase AC-II (100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0) (21.Yamagata T. Saito H. Habuchi O. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1523-1535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Streptomyces hyaluronidase (20 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0) (24.Ohya T. Kaneko Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 198: 607-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), and heparitinase II (100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 7.0) (25.Hovingh P. Linker A. Carbohydr. Res. 1974; 37: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Mass spectrum was obtained on a Sciex API-III triple-quadruple mass spectrometer (Thornhill, Ontario, Canada) equipped with an atmospheric pressure ionization source, as described previously (26.Takagaki K. Kojima K. Majima M. Nakamura T. Kato I. Endo M. Glycoconj. J. 1992; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The samples were dissolved in 50% methanol and injected at 2 μl/min with a micro-HPLC syringe pump. In positive ion mode, scanning was done from m/z 400–1000 during the 1-min scan (10 cycles). The reaction product was blotted onto a poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane (Millipore, Co.). N-terminal amino acid sequence of the reaction product was determined with a protein sequencer (490 Procise, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The activity of activated protein C was measured according to the method of Ohno et al. (27.Ohno Y. Kato H. Morita T. Iwanaga S. Takada K. Sakakibara S. Stenflo J. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 90: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Two nmol of the reaction product were incubated in 0.05 m of Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, containing 0.15m NaCl and 1 mm CaCl2 with 1.0 μg of activated protein C. The fluorescence of liberated 7-amide-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) was measured on a spectrofluorimeter (Hitachi F-4500, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. To investigate the GAG chain transfer activity of endo-β-xylosidase, Boc-Leu-Ser-Thr-Arg-MCA was used as an acceptor for the carbohydrate chain. This peptide contained two amino acids (serine and threonine) that had hydroxyl groups required for the transfer region of the GAG chain and also contained a fluorescence substrate. For those reasons, this peptide was useful for the analysis of reaction products on HPLC. As a donor of the carbohydrate chain, peptido-ChS from bovine tracheal cartilage was used. Endo-β-xylosidase was purified as described previously (14.Takagaki K. Kon A. Kawasaki H. Nakamura T. Tamura S. Endo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 854-860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Fig. 1, native PAGE of this purified enzyme in 7.5% polyacrylamide gel shows a single band. The acceptor peptide and peptido-ChS were incubated at 37 °C with endo-β-xylosidase in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 3.0 (total volume, 100 μl). After incubation, the reaction was terminated by immersion in a boiling water bath for 3 min. The aliquot of reaction mixture was subjected to anion-exchange HPLC (TSKgel DEAE-5PW). As a result, only one acceptor peak (Fig. 2, peak 1) was obtained before the incubation (Fig. 2a). However, as the reaction proceeded, another fluorescent peak (Fig. 2, peak 2) was generated at the retention time of 41 min. This elution position corresponded to the elution position of PA-Ch6S. Peak 2 was collected and subjected to cellulose acetate membrane electrophoresis. As a result, the reaction product band corresponded to the standard Ch6S, and at this part of membrane, the same fluorescence as the acceptor peptide was detected (Fig. 3). From these results, it was shown that the reaction product had the same negative charge and the same fluorescence as the acceptor peptide.Figure 3Electrophoresis on a cellulose acetate membrane of the reaction product. Electrophoresis was carried out as described using 0.47 m formic acid, 0.1 mpyridine buffer, pH 3.0, at 1 mA/cm for 60 min. Staining was done with 0.05% Alcian blue in 70% ethanol. For determination of fluorescence, the membrane was cut into 3-mm pieces, and each piece was extracted with 1 ml of water.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the structure of the reaction product (Fig. 2, peak 2), the reaction product was digested with various GAG-degrading enzymes. After digestion, reaction mixture was subjected to gel filtration HPLC (Shodex OH-pak SB-803HQ and SB-804 HQ in series). As a result, the reaction product appeared at the retention time of 27 min (Fig. 4A). Judging from the elution position, the molecular mass of the reaction product was estimated to about 30 kDa, corresponding to the molecular mass of the chondroitin sulfate chain of the donor. The reaction product was sensitive to chondroitinase ABC and chondroitinase AC-II digestions (Fig. 4, B and C), although it was not sensitive to Streptomyces hyaluronidase and heparitinase II digestions (Fig. 4, D and E). For these results, it was confirmed that the reaction product had the chondroitin sulfate. To clarify that the chondroitin sulfate of the reaction product was attached to the acceptor peptide, the reaction product was incubated under the optimal condition for hydrolysis reaction of endo-β-xylosidase. After hydrolysis, the reaction mixture was subjected to a reversed phase HPLC (TSKgel ODS 120T). As a result, the reaction product peak was shifted to the position corresponding to the authentic acceptor peptide (Fig. 5). The fluorogenic component was collected, and ion-spray mass spectrometry analysis was performed. The spectra of the new fluorogenic component showed a peak at m/z [M + H]+ ion that was detected at m/z 733.4 [M + H]+ (Fig. 6). The combined results of HPLC analysis and ion-spray mass spectrometry indicated that this fluorogenic component was Boc-Leu-Ser-Thr-Arg-MCA. From these results, it was clarified that the acceptor peptide was liberated from the reaction product after hydrolysis by endo-β-xylosidase. Thus, it was confirmed that the chondroitin sulfate chain from the donor was attached to the acceptor peptide through the xyloside linkage.Figure 6Ion spray mass spectrum of products obtained from the reaction product after hydrolysis by endo-β-xylosidase. The fluorogenic peak (bar in Fig. 5B) obtained from the reaction product after hydrolysis by endo-β-xylosidase was recovered and analyzed by ion-spray mass spectrometry. The conditions for mass spectrometry were described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ChS attachment site of the acceptor peptide was investigated. First, the acceptor peptide without the Boc residue was prepared by trifluoroacetic acid treatment. Next, the chondroitin sulfate chain was attached to this peptide by the GAG chain transfer reaction of endo-β-xylosidase. After that, the reaction product was subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. As a result, N-terminal amino acid sequence of the reaction product was determined as Leu-X-Thr-Arg. The second amino acid, the serine residue, was not identified. This result indicated that the hydroxyl group of the serine residue was substituted, that is the ChS chain was attached to the serine residue. From these results, it was confirmed that the ChS chain from the donor was transferred selectively to the serine residue of the acceptor peptide. Thus, it was shown that novel peptidoglycan, Boc-Leu-Ser(ChS)-Thr-Arg-MCA, was synthesized using the GAG chain transfer reaction of endo-β-xylosidase. Time course change of the GAG chain transfer reaction was investigated (Fig. 7A). It was shown that the reaction products were increased as the incubation time increased. However, after 12 h of incubation, they were hydrolyzed, and then decreased gradually. To investigate the effect of pH on the GAG chain transfer reaction, the reaction was performed at various pH values, and the amounts of the reaction product were measured after 12 h at 37 °C (Fig. 7B). It was shown that the optimal pH of the GAG chain transfer reaction was 3.0, differing from the optimal pH 4.0 of hydrolysis of this enzyme (14.Takagaki K. Kon A. Kawasaki H. Nakamura T. Tamura S. Endo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 854-860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of the acceptor peptide concentration on the GAG chain transfer reaction was investigated by performing the reaction with various concentrations of the acceptor peptide for 12 h at pH 3.0 (Fig. 7, C). The reaction product was increased depending on the concentration of the acceptor peptide. The effect of the donor concentration on the GAG chain transfer reaction was investigated in the presence of various concentrations of peptido-ChS at pH 3.0 (Fig. 7D). The reaction product was increased with increasing amounts of peptido-ChS up to 250 nmol (final, 2.5 mm). Because of the solubility, however, we could not add or test higher concentrations (above 2.5 mm) of peptido-ChS. The effect of several metal ions on the GAG chain transfer reaction was investigated (Table I). It was found that the GAG chain transfer activity was strongly inhibited by Cu2+ and Ag+.Table IEffects of various metal ions on the GAG chain transfer reactionCompounds (10 mm)Relative activity%H2O100CuSO417MgSO465AgNO326CaCl242CoCl286ZnCl2108MnCl255CdCl2108BaCl251KCl74NaCl91EDTA103The GAG chain transfer reaction of endo-β-xylosidase was done under the normal conditions except for the presence of various metal ions.

The intact peptido-ChS was digested exhaustively with chondroitinase ABC and chondroitinase AC-II, and ΔGlcA-GalNAc(S)-GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-peptide and ΔGlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-peptide were prepared. These two peptido-oligosaccharides were used as donors of the GAG chain transfer reaction of endo-β-xylosidase. It was shown that the linkage hexasaccharide and the linkage tetrasaccharide of the donor could be transferred to the acceptor peptide; however, the reaction product was limited to 25 and 15%, respectively. When Xyl-peptide and chondroitin sulfate without peptide (after hydrolysis by endo-β-xylosidase) were used as donors, the GAG chain transfer reactions were not observed at all.Table IIEffects of the length of the GAG cahin on the GAG chain transfer reactionDonorsRelative activityaThe activity shows the relative rate of the reaction product when the products of the GAG chain transfer reaction using intact peptido-ChS as a donor is 100%.

By using peptido-DS, peptido-HS, and HA as donors, the GAG chain transfer reaction was done as described above.

The activity of activated protein C, which was a kind of protease, toward the Boc-Leu-Ser(ChS)-Thr-Arg-MCA was investigated. It was shown that the activity of the activated protein C toward Boc-Leu-Ser(ChS)-Thr-Arg-MCA was decreased to 30% compared with the activity toward Boc-Leu-Ser-Thr-Arg-MCA (Fig. 8). This result showed that the Boc-Leu-Ser(ChS)-Thr-Arg-MCA was resistant against activated protein C compared with Boc-Leu-Ser-Thr-Arg-MCA. Previously, we have isolated and characterized endo-β-xylosidase from the mid-gut gland of the molluscus Patinopecten (14.Takagaki K. Kon A. Kawasaki H. Nakamura T. Tamura S. Endo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 854-860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme was an endo-type glycosidase that hydrolyzed the xylosyl serine linkage between a core protein and a GAG chain and, as a result, released the intact GAG chain from proteoglycan. In this study, we clarified that endo-β-xylosidase had the transglycosylation activity and succeeded in attaching the intact GAG chain to the peptide by using this activity. The reaction scheme is depicted in Fig. 9. The transglycosylation activity of this enzyme had the following significant characteristics. 1) It could transfer the intact GAG chain of relatively high molecular weight (20–30 kDa) to peptide. 2) It could transfer the different type of GAG chains (ChS, DS, and HS) similarly to peptide. For these reasons, we named this reaction “GAG chain transfer reaction.” In recent years, some reports (28.Haneda K. Inazu T. Mizuno M. Iguchi R. Yamamoto K. Kumagai H. Aimoto S. Suzuki H. Noda T.

Chem. 1991; 266: 10723-10726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have described the transglycosylation reactions using endo-type glycosidases. As well as these reactions, the GAG chain transfer reaction of endo-β-xylosidase was regarded as a specific reaction using a reverse reaction of hydrolysis. Therefore, it was very important for the GAG chain transfer reaction to accelerate a reverse reaction by changing the optimal conditions of hydrolysis of this enzyme. For instance, although the optimal pH of hydrolysis of endo-β-xylosidase was 4.0, the yields of the GAG chain transfer reaction were increased by shifting the pH of the reaction mixture from 4.0 to 3.0. Takagaki et al. (8.Ashida H. Yamamoto K. Murata T. Usui T. Kumagai H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) has reported that the optimal pH of the transglycosylation reaction of bovine testicular hyaluronidase was 7.0, differing from the optimal pH 5.0 of hydrolysis for this enzyme. It was suggested that changing pH was strongly connected with accelerating a reverse reaction. Furthermore, increasing the concentrations of the donor and the acceptor was necessary for accelerating the reverse reaction, namely the GAG chain transfer reaction. Although the low molecular weight GAG chain (linkage tetrasaccharide and linkage hexasaccharide) could be transferred to the peptide by the GAG chain transfer reaction of endo-β-xylosidase, the high molecular weight GAG chain could be transferred more effectively. Previously, we have investigated the substrate specificity of hydrolysis of endo-β-xylosidase, and we clarified that this enzyme released the high molecular weight GAG chain more effectively (14.Takagaki K. Kon A. Kawasaki H. Nakamura T. Tamura S. Endo M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 854-860Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it was suggested that the higher molecular weight GAG chain could be transferred because of this substrate specificity of this enzyme. Moreover, it was shown that three kinds of GAG chains (ChS, DS, and HS) could be transferred to the peptide by using the GAG chain transfer reaction. However, HA was not transferred by this reaction at all. GAG chains of proteoglycan were attached to the serine residue of the core protein through the linkage region (GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl) (31.Lindahl U. Roden L. Gottschalk A. Glycoprotein. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1972: 491-517Google Scholar). However, it was known that HA was a GAG without a linkage region and did not bind to the core protein (32.Weissman B. Meyer K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1954; 76: 1753-1757Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar). HA could not be the substrate of endo-β-xylosidase because it did not have the xylosyl serine linkage. Therefore, HA was not transferred to peptide by the GAG chain transfer reaction of endo-β-xylosidase. Yamamoto et al. (7.Yamamoto K. Fujimori K. Haneda K. Mizuno M. Inazu T. Kumagai H. Carbohydr. Res. 1997; 305: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) succeeded in attaching the N-linked oligosaccharide from human transferrin to peptide T by using the transglycosylation reaction of endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase from M. hiemalis and described that this glycosylated peptide T was highly stable against proteolysis in comparison to native peptide T. The acceptor peptide used in the current study was the substrate for activated protein C, a kind of protease. It was observed that the ChS-attached acceptor peptide was resistant against the activated protein C. It was suggested that the attached ChS chain inhibited the attack of the enzyme on the substrate as well as the N-linked oligosaccharide of the glycosylated peptide T. This result indicates that the ChS chain of proteoglycan inhibits the proteolysis of core protein. The GAG chain transfer reaction of endo-β-xylosidase released the GAG chain from the donor and transferred it selectively to the serine residue of the acceptor peptide, although the threonine residue also had the hydroxyl group required as the transfer region of the GAG chain. The mechanism of the selective transfer to the serine residue was not clarified in this study. Furthermore, the acceptor specificity, the transfer ability to the high molecular weight protein, and the regioselective transfer of the GAG chain remain problems to be solved in the future. GAG chains of proteoglycan have important roles in the expression and the regulation of its biological function (33.Silbert J.E. Sugumaran G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 371-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 34.Kanayama N. Maehara K. Suzuki M. Fujise Y. Terao T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3296-3307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). GAG has a basic structure made of repeating disaccharides (typically a repeat of 40–100 times), which consist of uronic acid and hexosamine (36.Hascall V.C. Hascall G.T. Hay E.D. Cell Biology of Extracellular Matrix. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1981: 39-63Crossref Google Scholar). However, it is known that the bioactive domain consists of particular sugar chain sequences, such as pentasaccharides with activity of anticoagulation of heparin (antithrombin III binding activity) (37.Casu B. Oreste P. Torri G. Zoppetti G. Choay J. Lormeau J.-C. Petitou M. Sinay P. Biochem. J. 1981; 197: 559-609Crossref Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and hexasaccharides with the heparin cofactor II binding domain in sugar chain of dermatan sulfate (38.Maimone M.M. Tollefsen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18263-18271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Takagaki et al. (39.Takagaki K. Munakata H. Majima M. Kakizaki I. Endo M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 40.Takagaki K. Ishido K. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 2000; 12: 295-306Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) succeeded in synthesizing custom-made GAGs consisting of different combinations of disaccharide units by using the transglycosylation reaction of bovine testicular hyaluronidase. Therefore, it is possible to recombine disaccharide units of the GAG chain of the donor peptidoglycan in order to make it bioactive. Furthermore, by using the GAG chain transfer reaction, the reconstructed bioactive GAG chain could be attached to the peptide. As a result, because the peptide would have unprecedented biological function, it would be possible to synthesize a novel bioactive proteoglycan. In this report, we described the attachment of the GAG chain to peptide by using the GAG chain transfer reaction of endo-β-xylosidase as a glycotechnological tool for artificial synthesis of proteoglycan. The GAG chain transfer reaction of endo-β-xylosidase is expected to open a new avenue in proteoglycan glycotechnology."
