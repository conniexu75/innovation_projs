https://openalex.org/W2051747007,"When albino rats are reared in cyclic light, a burst of rod outer segment disk shedding occurs in the retina soon after the onset of light. The number of large packets of outer segment disks (phagosomes) in the pigment epithelium at this time is 2.5 to 5 times greater than at any other time of day or night. The subsequent degradation of large phagosomes to smaller structures within pigment epithelial cells proceeds rapidly. The burst of disk shedding follows a circadian rhythm for at least 3 days, since it occurs in continuous darkness at the same time without the onset of light."
https://openalex.org/W1969128567,"Two simple chromenes with anti-JH activity have been isolated and identified from the bedding plant Ageratum houstonianum. By contact and fumigation these compounds induce precocious metamorphosis and sterilization in several hemipteran species of insects. Certain holometabolous species are sterilized, forced into diapause, or both. Each of these biological actions is equivalent to removal of the corpora allata, which produce the JH's, and is reversible by treatment with exogenous JH. Thus, the action of these compounds is to stop the production or depress the titer of the JH's. To our knowledge, this is the first discovery of anti-JH, and we hope it will guide the way to the emergence of a fourth generation of safe and insect-specific pesticides."
https://openalex.org/W2158932024,"We have examined the role played by various histones in the organization of the DNA of the nucleosome, using staphylococcal nuclease as a probe of DNA conformation. When this enzyme attacks chromatin, a series of fragments evenly spaced at 10 base pair intervals is generated, reflecting the histone-DNA interactions within the nucleosome structure. To determine what contribution the various histones make to DNA organization, we have studied the staphylococcal nuclease digestion patterns of complexes of DNA with purified histones. Virtually all possible combinations of homogeneous histones were reconstituted onto DNA. Exhaustive digestion of a complex containing the four histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 yields a DNA fragment pattern very similar to that of whole chromatin. The only other combinations of histones capable of inducing chromatin-like DNA organization are H2A/H2B/H4 and those mixtures containing both H3 and H4. From an examination of the kinetics of digestion of H3/H4 reconstitutes, we conclude that although the other histones have a role in DNA organization within the nucleosome, the arginine-rich histone pair, H3/H4, can organize DNA segments the length of the nucleosome core in the absence of all other histones."
https://openalex.org/W2079506290,"The complexity of nuclear RNA, poly(A)hnRNA, poly(A)mRNA, and total poly(A)RNA from mouse brain has been measured by saturation hybridization with nonrepeated DNA. These DNA populations were complementary, respectively, to 21, 13.5, 3.8, and 13.3% of the DNA. From the RNA Cot required to achieve half-sturation, it was estimated that about 2.5–3% of the mass of total nuclear RNA constituted most of the complexity. Similarly, complexity driver molecules constituted 6–7% of the mass of the poly(A)hnRNA. 75–80% of the poly(A)mRNA diversity is contained in an estimated 4–5% of the mass of this mRNA. Poly(A)hnRNA constituted about 20% of the mass of nuclear RNA and was comprised of molecules which sedimented in DMSO-sucrose gradients largely between 16S and 60S. The number average size of poly(A)hnRNA determined by sedimentation, electron microscopy, or poly(A) content was 4200–4800 nucleotides. Poly(A)mRNA constituted about 2% of the total polysomal RNA, and the number average size was 1100–1400 nucleotides. The complexity of whole cell poly(A)RNA, which contains both poly(A)hnRNA and poly(A)mRNA populations, was the same as poly(A)hnRNA. This implies that cytoplasmic polyadenylation does not occur to any apparent qualitative extent and that poly(A)mRNA is a subset of the poly(A)hnRNA population. The complexity of poly(A)hnRNA and poly(A)mRNA in kilobases was 5 × 105 and 1.4 × 105, respectively. DNA which hybridized with poly(A)mRNA renatures in the presence of excess total DNA at the same rate as nonrepetitive tracer DNA. Hence saturation values are due to hybridization with nonrepeated DNA and are therefore a direct measure of the sequence complexity of poly(A)mRNA. These results indicate that the nonrepeated sequence complexity of the poly(A)mRNA population is equal to about one fourth that observed for poly(A)hnRNA."

https://openalex.org/W2038016340,"We have examined the role played by each histone in forming the structure of the ν-body. When DNAase I, DNAase II, trypsin, and chymotrypsin attack chromatin, characteristic discrete DNA and protein digest fragments are produced. Using this restriction of accessibility as diagnostic for chromatin structure, we have examined complexes of DNA with virtually all possible combinations of histones. The results strongly support our previous conclusion ( Camerini-Otero et al., 1976 Camerini-Otero R.D. Sollner-Webb B. Felsenfeld G. The organization of histones and DNA in chromatin: evidence for an arginine-rich histone kernel. Cell. 1976; 8: 333-347 Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar ) that the arginine-rich histones are unique in their ability to create, with DNA, a structure with many features of native chromatin. Acting together, slightly lysine-rich histones then modify this complex into one very similar to native chromatin. An analysis of the rate constants of staphylococcal nuclease digestion also confirms that the complex of H3, H4, and DNA is crucial to the structure of the ν-body."

https://openalex.org/W1489235874,"Glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis was studied in developing chick corneas, with particular attention paid to keratan sulfate I, the major glycosaminoglycan of this tissue. This polysaccharide is unique to the cornea and may be required for the development and maintenance of corneal transparency. Corneas from 5-to 20-day chick embryos were labeled in vitro with D-[6- 3H] glyhucosamine and H(2)35SO(4)35SO(4) and the amount of label in each glycosaminoglycan was determined. The data indicate that, contrary to previous suggestions, keratan sulfate biosynthesis in the cornea begins at the time of fibroblast invasion of the primary stroma, at least 8 days prior to the onset of corneal transparency, which occurs on Day 14 of the development in the chick. The rate of incorporation of radioactivity into keratan sulfates, on a dry weight basis, increases rapidly after Day 6 and levels off on Day l4. The proportion of 3H and 35S in keratan sulfate reaches nearly maximal levels as early as Day 9. In contrast, the proportion of radioactivity in corneal heparan sulfates declines rapidly after Day 5. However, the rate of incorporation of radioactivity into heparan sulfates, on a dry weight basis, increases or remains the same during early development. On and after Day 14, keratan sulfates appear to become more highly sulfated. Moreover, the ratios of 4-sulfated to 6-sulfated chondroitin sulfates increase during development, reaching a maximum on Day 14. These changing patterns of glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis during corneal development may play an important role in corneal morphogenesis and the achievement of corneal transparency"
https://openalex.org/W1975397269,"The restriction enzymes Hind III and Hae III cleave Xenopus laevis 5S DNA at one and three sites, respectively, in each repeating unit of approximately 700 base pairs. The cleavage sites for both enzymes have been located within the repeating unit by denaturation mapping of the restriction fragments. The Hind III products and one of the Hae III fragments are variable in length, indicating heterogeneity in the length of the repeating unit in 5S DNA. This length heterogeneity is confined to the major A + T-rich spacer region. Repeating units differ from each other by discrete quanta of approximately 15 base pairs. The A + T-rich spacer has been shown to consist largely of tandem subrepeats of just this size ( Brownlee et al., 1974 Brownlee G.G. Cartwright E.M. Brown D.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 89: 703-718 Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar ). We suggest that the repeat-length heterogeneity is due to variable numbers of these subrepeats in the spacer regions of the major repeating units."

Maximal enzyme activity in Rhodotorula glutinis (2 units/g, wet weight, of yeast) was induced in late-log phase (12 to 14 hours) of growth in a culture medium containing 1.0% malt extract, 0.1% yeast extract, and 0.1% L-phenylalanine. A highly purified enzyme was obtained by fractionation with ammonium sulfate and sodium citrate followed by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-200. The active preparation yielded a major component on three different polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic systems. Antisera to phenylalanine ammonia-lyase was raised in rabbits and detected by double immunodiffusion. The antigen-antibody complex was enzymatically active in vitro. The biological half-life of the enzyme was approximately 21 hours in several mammalian species (mice without and with BW10232 adenocarcinoma and B16 melanoma, rats, and monkeys) after a single injection; however, upon repeated administration, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase had a much shorter biological half-life. The onset of rapid clearance occurred earlier in tumor-bearing than in nontumor-bearing mice indicating a direct or indirect influence by the tumor on the biological half-life of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase."
https://openalex.org/W2057475351,"In a variety of systems, histone mRNA has been shown to lack poly(A) ( Gross et al., 1973 Gross K.W. Jacobs-Lorena M. Baglioni C. Gross P.R. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci.

We have found, however, that in Xenopus laevis oocytes, poly(A)-containing mRNA codes for histones, in a wheat germ cell-free system, based on the following criteria: first, co-migration with authentic X. laevis oocyte histones on polyacrylamide gels; second, no detectable incorporation of tryptophan; third, differential incorporation of lysine and methionine into histone fraction H2A; fourth, resistance of histone fraction H2A to cleavage with cyanogen bromide; and fifth, correspondence of tryptic peptide maps of partially purified cell-free products with authentic X. laevis oocyte histone. RNA which directs the synthesis of histones in the cell-free system is retained on oligo(dT)-cellulose, even after denaturation in 80% DMSO at 70°C, thereby demonstrating the covalent attachment of polyadenylic acid sequences to the mRNA. Poly(A)− RNA (7S–14S fraction) was also found to code for histones using the same criteria. We discuss the significance of the finding that X. laevis oocytes contain two classes of histone mRNA as well as the potential developmental implications of this observation."

https://openalex.org/W2147491737,"Xenopus liver vitellogenin and albumin mRNAs injected into Xenopus oocytes are correctly translated, as shown by specific immunoprecipitation and co-electrophoresis with purified Xenopus vitellogenin (molecular weight 210,000 daltons) and albumin (molecular weight 72,000 daltons). Vitellogenin made in oocytes under the direction of injected liver mRNA is unstable compared to other proteins made on injected messengers (such as albumin and globin) and endogenous oocyte proteins (including actin), the half-life of newly made vitellogenin being about 8 hr. Pulse-chase experiments with 35S-methionine show vitellogenin to be a precursor to yolk platelet lipovitellin (molecular weight 120,000 daltons), while 3H-serine labeling demonstrates conversion to phosvitin (molecular weight 34,000 daltons). In contrast, injected 3H-serine 35S-methionine-labeled Xenopus vitellogenin protein is not converted to yolk platelet proteins and is degraded rather slowly (half-life, 23–29 hr). Phosphorylation of serine residues in phosvitin can be detected in oocytes injected with 32PO4 or γ-32P-ATP; thus exogenously derived yolk platelet protein is further modified, or turned over, once it is within the oocyte. Moreover, vitellogenin made in oocytes programmed with liver mRNA is phosphorylated. Thus phosphorylation, assembly into yolk platelets, and cleavage are events that do not require vitellogenin supplied by the normal pathways involved in yolk formation (synthesis and post-translational modification in the liver, transport in the serum, and follicle cell-dependent pinocytosis). Vitellogenin mRNA sediments at about 29S in a sucrose-SDS gradient, while albumin messenger peaks at 16S; both species contain poly(A). These liver mRNAs are functionally stable in oocytes for at least 5 days. Vitellogenin-forming activity, relative to albumin, actin, or total endogenous activity, increases with time, and the final rate of 2–2.5 times the initial rate is only reached 3 days after injection. The potentiation effect probably stems from an increase in the efficiency of translation of vitellogenin mRNA. The availability of homologous mRNAs now permits injected messenger to be used as a valid probe of oocyte function: the biological activity of mRNA from a non-ovarian Xenopus tissue proves that some at least of the translational systems within the Xenopus oocyte are not cell type-specific. Moreover, the whole cell system is eminently suitable for assaying putative translational (and possibly transcriptional) control elements from frog liver."

Synchronized emergences, like those observed in 13- and 17-year cicades, are predicted for insects with sufficiently long life-spans. Balanced solutions, in which comparable emergences occur each year, are found for insects having sufficiently short life-spans, such as 3-, 4-, and 7-year cicadas.

https://openalex.org/W1545833105,"As determined by EPR, malic enzyme from pigeon liver binds Mn2+ with a half-site stoichiometry of two tight binding sites (KD=6 to 10 mum) per enzyme tetramer and at two to four weak binding sites (KD=0.43 to 1.34 mM). The activation of malic enzyme by Mn2+ at high levels of L-malate shows biphasic kinetics yielding two activator constants for Mn2+. The dissociation constants of Mn2+ for both classes of sites are of the same order as the kinetically determined activator constants of Mn2+, indicating active site binding at both classes of binding sites. The binding of Mn2+ to the tight sites enhances the paramagnetic effect of Mn2+ on 1/T1 of water protons by a factor (epsilon) of 17, while binding at the weak sites yields a smaller epsilon of 11. The coenzymes TPN and TPNH have no effects on epsilon, while the carboxylic acid substrates L-malate and pyruvate and the inhibitors D-malate and oxalate significantly decrease epsilon. TPNH causes a 38-fold tightening of binding of the substrate L-malate to the enzyme-Mn2+ complex, consistent with the previously described highly ordered kinetic scheme, but only a 2-fold tightening of binding of the competitive inhibitor D-malate. The dissociation constant of L-malate from the quaternary E-Mn2+-TPNH-L-malate complex (32 muM) agrees with the Km of L-malate (25 muM), indicating active site binding. The dissociation constants of pyruvate from the ternary E-Mn2+-pyruvate complex (12 mM) and from the quaternary E-Mn2+-TPN-pyruvate complex (20 mM) are similar to the Km of pyruvate (5 mM), also indicating active site binding and a less highly ordered kinetic scheme for the reactions of pyruvate than for those of L-malate. Analysis of the frequency dependence of 1/T1 of water protons indicates that two fast exchanging water ligands remain coordinated to Mn2+ in the binary E-Mn2+ complex. The binding of the substrates L-malate and pyruvate and of the transition state analog oxalate to the E-Mn2+ complex decrease the number of fast exchanging water ligands on Mn2+ by approximately 1, but the binding of D-malate has no significant effect on this parameter, indicating the occlusion or replacement of a water ligand of the enzyme-bound Mn2+ by a properly oriented substituent on C-2 of the substrate. Occlusion rather than replacement of a water ligand by pyruvate is established by studies of 1/T1 of 13COO- and 13CO-enriched pyruvate which indicate second sphere Mn2+ to pyruvate distances of 4.6 A (COO-) and 4.8 A (CO) in the ternary enzyme-Mn2+-pyruvate complex. Formation of the quaternary complex with TPN increases these distances by 0.8 A, indicating the participation of a second sphere enzyme-Mn2+-(H2O)-pyruvate complex in catalysis. Thus, malic enzyme, like five other enzymes which utilize metals to polarize carbonyl groups, forms a second sphere complex with its substrate."

This assignment was made by digesting amplified ribosomal gene transcription complexes with EcoRI restriction endonuclease and spreading the cleaved transcription complexes for electron microscopy.

https://openalex.org/W2080510480,"The pattern of histone synthesis changes during development in sea urchins. One change involves two different lysine-rich histones. In Lytechinus, the late appearing histone, H1g, begins to be synthesized at gastrulation. Preformed (“maternal”) mRNA of unfertilized eggs contains sequences that direct the synthesis of a part of the histone made during the period of cleavage. During that interval, a different lysine-rich histone, H1m, is produced. Maternal mRNA is not, however, the sole source of templates for histone synthesis. Transcription of embryonic genomes provides the major share, and cleavage stage polyribosomes translate both maternal and embryonic messages. A cell-free system derived from wheat germ was used to test RNAs from unfertilized eggs and from post-gastrula embryos for their capacity to direct the synthesis of histones, including the H1 types, in vitro. Maternal mRNA includes templates for the synthesis of H1m, but it appears to lack those for H1g, since the cell-free system yields only H1m when challenged with egg RNA. Since the cell-free system is capable of translating H1g mRNA when presented with it, the synthesis of H1g is probably a very early developmental event controlled at the level of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2120165187,"Nuclear DNA from eucaryotes contains a significant fraction which forms duplexes very rapidly and also independently of the DNA concentration. This fraction can be isolated by adsorption to hydroxylapatite and has been called foldback DNA ( Britten and Smith, 1970 Britten R. Smith J. A bovine genome. Carnegie Inst. Wash. Yearbook. 1970; 68: 378-386 Google Scholar ). Here we extend previous studies to show that the foldback fraction is due to the existence of a finite number of foldback foci in each genome equivalent of DNA, approximately 105 in the case of Xenopus laevis. More significantly, we have isolated the foldback fraction in quantity from DNA of such a size (in one case broken randomly and in another digested with a restriction endonuclease) that only about 10% of the total DNA has foldback properties. If the foldback foci were located in precisely the same positions in all sets of the Xenopus laevis genome, the prediction would be that these foldback fractions would contain sequences representing 20% (random shear) and 10% (restriction endonuclease) of the total genome. In contrast, our results show that in both cases the foldback fraction contains the entire Xenopus laevis DNA sequence. One possible explanation of these observations is that as in procaryotes, eucaryotic DNA is randomly cross-linked. We show that cross-linkage of Xenopus laevis DNA is not sufficient to explain our observations. In consequence, we have adopted the hypothesis that the formation of foldback DNA is mainly an intrastrand phenomenon, but nevertheless occurs at different sites in different sets of the Xenopus laevis genome."

https://openalex.org/W2091270822,"We have analyzed the efficiency with which specific nucleotide sequences within nucleosomes are recognized and cleaved by DNA restriction endonucleases. A system amenable to this sort of analysis is the cleavage of the bovine genome with the restriction endonuclease EcoRI. Bovine satellite I comprises 7% of the genome and is tandemly repetitious with an EcoRI site at 1400 base pair (bp) intervals within this sequence. The ease with which this restriction fragment can be measured permits an analysis of the accessibility of this sequence when organized in a nucleosomal array. Initial studies indicated that satellite I sequences are organized in a nucleosomal structure in a manner analogous to that observed for total genomic DNA. We then examined the accessibility of the EcoRI cleavage sites in satellite to endonucleolytic cleavage in intact nuclei. We find that whereas virtually all the satellite I sequences from naked DNA are cleaved into discrete 1400 bp fragments, only 33% of the satellite I DNA is liberated as this fragment from intact nuclei. These data indicate that 57% of the EcoRI sites in nuclei are accessible to cleavage and that cleavage can occur within the core of at least half the nucleosomal subunits. Analysis of the products of digestion suggests a random distribution of nucleosomes about the EcoRI sites of satellite I DNA. Finally, the observation that satellite sequences can be cleaved from nuclei to 1400 bp length fragments with their associated proteins provides a method for the isolation of specific sequences as chromatin. Using sucrose gradient velocity centrifugation, we have isolated a 70% pure fraction of satellite I chromatin. Nuclease digestion of this chromatin fraction reveals the presence of nucleosomal subunits and indicates that specific sequences can be isolated in this manner without gross disorganization of their subunit structure."
https://openalex.org/W1603526502,"Insulin, a mitogen for cultured chick embryo fibroblasts (Temin, H.M. (1968) Cancer 3, 771-787), has been employed to characterize the effects of mitogen/cell membrane interactions as it relates to growth. The specific binding of 125I-insulin to substratum-attached cells is time- and temperature dependent and is optimum at a pH of 7.0. Fetal calf and chicken sera, somatomedin A/C mixed, and desalanine or native porcine insulin compete with 125I-insulin for membrane-binding sites. Proinsulin, although competing less effectively than native insulin for binding, is more effective than desoctapeptide insulin. Unrelated polypeptide hormones do not compete for 125I-insulin binding. The lowest concentration of insulin at which specific binding is detected is 0.1 nM. Scatchard plot analysis of the binding data indicates that there are two types of binding sites in confluent cultures of fibroblasts: one of high affinity (K1 = 2 to 6 X 10(8) M-1) and low capacity, the other of low affinity (K2 = 0.8 to 3.0 X 10(7) M-1) and high capacity. Approximately 1.9 and 7.1 X 10(3) molecules of insulin are bound at each site, respectively. A 10-min incubation at 24 degrees of the fibroblasts with 10 mug/ml of trypsin causes a 2-fold stimulation of specific 125I-insulin binding and a similar 2-fold increase in insulin-stimulated 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake and thymidine incorporation. Neuraminidase treatment also produces a 37% increase in specific 125I-insulin binding but treatment with alpha-chymotrypsin or phospholipase C are without significant effect. The results of this and additional experiments support the hypothesis that trypsin treatment of chick embryo fibroblasts leads to an unmasking of 125I-insulin binding sites. Serum starvation of fibroblasts for 12 or 24 h produces a 2.5- to 5-fold increase in specific 125I-insulin binding. This increase is the result of an increase in the number of hormone-binding sites from 9 X 10(3) to 6 X 10(4) per cell which are predominantly of the low affinity type. There is no change in the affinity constants. The presence of camptothecin, or cordycepin, or cycloheximide in the incubation medium completely blocks the increase in number of 125I-insulin-binding sites resulting from serum starvation. The addition of native insulin to the medium of serum-starved cultures also blocks this increase. The magnitude of insulin-stimulated 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake and thymidine incorporation correlates with the levels of occupancy of the low affinity 125I-insulin-binding sites in untreated fibroblasts. In fibroblasts cultured in the absence of serum, the marked increase in insulin-stimulated 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake and thymidine incorporation parallels the increase in number of mitogen receptors. The concentration of insulin that produces a half-maximum stimulation of thymidine incorporation is calculated to be 5 X 10(-8) M. At this concentration of insulin, 42% of the receptor sites are occupied."
https://openalex.org/W1963530339,"DNA containing the reiterated genes for tRNA1met has been partially purified from Xenopus laevis by centrifugation in actinomycin C1-CsCl and Ag+-Cs2SO4 gradients. These gradients separate the tRNA1met genes from those coding for tRNA2met and tRNAval, thus confirming our earlier suggestion that these genes are not intermingled with each other (Clarkson, Birnstiel, and Purdom, 1973a). The gradients also demonstrate the existence of a minor 5S DNA fraction which appears to differ from that previously isolated by Brown, Wensink, and Jordon (1971). When the enriched tDNA1met is digested to completion with either of the restriction endoncucleases EcoRl or Hpa l, the tRNA1met genes are predominantly found within DNA fragments that are about 3100 base pairs long. A partial digestion with EcoRl shows that these fragments arise from the regular spacing of the enzyme restriction sites. The 3100 base pair EcoRl fragments are cleaved by Hpa l into fragments to two size classes, one of which is about 2200 base pairs long and contains the tRNA1met genes. The shorter fragments are about 700 base pairs long, and they appear to contain genes coding for at least one other kind of tRNA species. X. laevis tDNA1met thus comprises tandemly repeated DNA whose component parts show little if any length heterogeneity."

The circular dichroism spectrum of the reoxidized alpha subunit is essentially identical to that of native alpha subunit except that its maximum at 233 nm is smaller than observed with native LHalpha. The intact hormone preparations obtained by recombination of reoxidized alpha subunit with native LH-beta exhibit electrophoretic patterns in polyacrylamide gels, elution profiles on gel filtration, binding activities to a membrane fraction from rat testes, and circular dichroism spectra identical to those of native LH and recombinants of native LH-alpha with the beta subunit. Recombinants of native or reoxidized LH-alpha with the beta subunit of thyrotropin are also indistinguishable in their electrophoretic patterns on polyacrylamide gels and in their in vivo activities of stimulating 32P uptake in thyroids of day-old chicks. While this study does not preclude that the alpha subunit may be biosynthesized as part of a larger precursor protein, the data demonstrate that sufficient information is present in the linear sequence of the alpha subunit to allow folding and formation of disulfide bonds to yield a functional alpha subunit."

https://openalex.org/W1570329711,"The five disulfide bonds of isolated alpha subunits of luteinizing hormone (LH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) are completely reduced at pH 8.5 in 15 min with no denaturant required and with only a slight excess of reducing agent. At pH 7.0, reduction is complete after 6 to 10 h. These results together with an earlier study concerning the positions of the two most readily reduced bonds (Cornell J.S., and Pierce, J.G. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 4166-4174) show that, in the isolated alpha subunit, all disulfides are readily accessible, although it is possible that a change in conformation, after rapid initial reduction of two disulfides, makes the remaining three more susceptible to reduction. No partially reduced and S-carboxymethylated intermediates were found at pH 7.0 other than those seen at pH 8.5, nor were additional intermediates found at pH 8.5 when reduction was initiated in the presence of alkylating agent. In contrast, reduction of the beta, hormone-specific, subunits of LH and TSH, while complete at pH 8.5 after 2 to 6 h, does not proceed to completion at pH 7.0 even after 24 h or upon addition of 6 M urea or large concentrations of reducing agent, and partially reduced intermediates useful in location of disulfide bridges can be trapped (e.g. Reeve, J.R., Cheng, K.-W., and Pierce, J.G. (1975) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 67, 149-155). Little or no reduction of the intact hormones is found at pH 7.0 in the absence of denaturing agents. This protection by the intact structure shows that the two most readily reduced disulfides of the alpha subunit and the single most readily reduced sidulfide of the beta subunits are either in regions of subunit-subunit contact or that these bonds become more reactive in the isolated subunits because of different influences by neighboring groups. At pH 8.5, intact LH is completely reduced after 6 h, but intact TSH is more resistant to reduction, which may reflect a higher affinity between subunits than exists in LH."

https://openalex.org/W2040882760,"Cellulose-bound DNA complementary to ovalbumin mRNA was used in a continous hybridization system to isolate single-stranded DNA molecules containing the ovalbumin gene. Fragmented DNA segments containing the ovalbumin gene were enriched 300-350 fold in one cycle of purification. Two cycles of purification resulted in a DNA fraction which was enriched 2300 fold in the ovalbumin sequence. The method is suitable for purification of the ovalbumin sequence from both sheared DNA fragments, as well as larger molecular weight DNA containing more than twice the number of nucleotides necessary to code for ovalbumin mRNA. The chromatographic procedures were specific and reproducible. In addition, the recovery of ovalbumin DNA was essentially quantitative (80-100%), even when large amounts of starting DNA (70-75 mg) were used. This purification scheme should also be useful for the enrichment of other unique sequence gened form eucaryotic DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1513093027,"Glucose-1,6-P2 synthase of beef brain which catalyzes the formation of glucose-1,6-P2 and glycerate-3-P from glycerate-1,3-P2 and glucose-1-P has been purified 700-fold with an overall recovery of 19%. The purification procedure involves an ammonium sulfate fractionation of the crude extract, DE52 and hydroxylapatite column chromatography and isoelectric focusing. The isolated enzyme appears to be homogeneous by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. Its molecular weight is estimated to be about 70,000 by gel filtration on Sephadex G-200 which agrees with the value obtained by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. A phosphoryl enzyme intermediate in the catalytic reaction is indicated by the following evidence: glycerate-1,3-P2[1-32P] labels the enzyme. The label is removed by acceptor substrates such as glucose-1-P. Using a rapid quenching device at 23 degrees and pH 8.0, the first order rate constant for phosphorylation of the enzyme is 20 s-1, compared with an overall rate with the best acceptor, glucose-1-P, of 19 s-1. Dephosphorylation by glucose-1-P is at 37 s-1. Mg2+ is required for both phosphoryl transfers and the overall reaction. In the complete reaction the fraction of enzyme that is phosphorylated depends on the concentrations of glycerate-1,3-P2 and the concentration and nature of the acceptor in a way that could be predicted from the steady state parameters, the Km values, and the kinetic constants observed for the single turnover. Reciprocal plots of initial rates as a function of both substrate concentrations are families of parallel lines. The 32P-labeled phosphoryl enzyme intermediate was found to be acid-stable and somewhat alkaline-labile. Phosphoserine was identified from the partial acid hydrolysate of a protease digest of [32P] phosphoryl enzyme by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1994371688,Electroconvulsive shock or frontal cortex stimulation administered to rats at 5 but not at 180 minutes after an initial administration of morphine sulfate disrupted the development of one-trial tolerance to the analgesic effects of morphine sulfate. It is suggested that development of tolerance may be mediated by cellular mechanisms and memory processes similar to those thought to underlie conventional learning.
https://openalex.org/W1976921640,"A temperature-sensitive mammalian cell line has been isolated which grows and divides normally at the permissive temperature of 33 degrees C. When incubated at 39 degrees C, the nonpermissive temperature, interphase cells continue to enter a prophase-like state. Chromatin-like material condenses and coalesces into dark-staining clumps rather than into discernible chromosomes. Disappearance of the nuclear boundary is observed, but re-formation of the boundary around the clumps fails to occur. In corporation of labeled precursors reveals a decrease in protein synthesis which is accompanied by a slower decrease in DNA synthesis. Approximately 0.2% of the mutant cells revert in their capability of growth and cell division at 39 degrees C. These ""revertants"" are found to contain a higher number of chromosomes. The isolation of this mutant is based on the initial observation that the cells become rounded at the nonpermissive temperature. The cell-rounding process characteristic of mitotic cells should serve as a useful marker in the isolation of mitotic mutants."
https://openalex.org/W2070137599,"Configurations of moving points are often perceptually analyzed into relative and common vectors that are different from the actual motions. If a movement configuration is abruptly replaced by a test point whose objective velocity continues the apparent (but illusory) course of one of the original points, observers perceive that course as uninterrupted and colinear. This finding provides a quantitative measure of the vector extraction phenomenon and was used to show that neither of the two current models adequately fits that phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2165118740,"In this study we report that preincubation of Dictyostelium discoideum membrane-bound adenylate cyclase with ATP over the concentration range 0.5 to 100 mM results in a loss of catalytic activity and that this effect persists even after removal of ATP. An analysis of the time course of this effect shows that, at 25 mM ATP, a 5- to 10-min preincubation results in 50% loss of activity. Additional studies on this effect showed that anhydride bond cleavage of ATP occurs during the preincubation. However, loss of catalytic activity is not porduced by ADP, AMP, cAMP, adenosine, pyrophosphate, or phosphate either separately or in pairs. Further, using the structural analogs adenosine 5'-(alpha, beta-methylene)triphosphate and adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphonate, we show that there is a direct correlation between alpha-beta-phosphoanhydride bond cleavage and the loss of catalytic activity. These results can be interpreted in terms of two classes of reaction mechanisms: either those involving covalent modifications or those involving a ligand-induced slow conversion of the adenylate cyclase from an active to an inactive form. Additional studies show that the addition of AMP to the reaction mixture, as well as removal of the membrane-bound 5'-nucleotidase activity, can prevent the loss of cyclase activity. These results suggest not only that adenylate cyclase activity is related to the AMP:ATP ratio but that the cyclase activity can be modified by the level of 5'-nucleotidase activity. Studies on the duration of the loss of activity produced by ATP show that following removal of ATP and additional incubation, a gradual recovery of cyclase activity is observed. This result suggests that under appropriate conditions the cyclase inactivation by ATP is reversible."
https://openalex.org/W1535565197,"The reaction of iodine with aromatic residues of hen egg white lysozyme is examined by means of natural abundance 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In the unfractionated product of the reaction at PH 5.5 (with I2/lysozyme molar ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.5), the only detectably modified aromatic residues are Trp-108 and either Tyr-20 or Tyr-23 (probably the latter). The rates of reaction at the two sites are similar. The extents of modification (at each site) are approximately 25%, 50%, and approximately greater than 80% for I2/lysozyme molar ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.5, respectively. At pH 4.5, the rates of reaction of both residues are about one-third or less of the rates at pH 5.5. When the reaction is carried out at pH 8.5 (with an I2/lysozyme molar ratio of 1.0), only the tyrosine residue is modified. Resonances observed in the spectra of the modified protein mixtures (but not in the spectrum of intact lysozyme) indicate that the modified Trp-108 residue is not oxindolealanine, but either delta1-hydroxytryptophan or an ester thereof. This result is consistent with previous evidence which indicates that the modified tryptophan is the Glu-35 ester of delta1-hydroxytryptophan-108 (Imoto, T., and Rupley, J.A. (1973) J. Mol. Biol. 80, 657-667; Beddell, C. R., Blake, C. C. F., and Oatley, S. J. (1975) J. Mol. Biol. 97, 643-654). The spectra also indicate that the modified tyrosine residue is predominantly monoiodinated. The spectra of modified protein samples subjected to denaturation with 6M guanidinium chloride for 24 h at 37 degrees (and the renatured) indicate that residue 108 is converted to about equal amounts of the two diastereoisomers of oxindolealanine. However, incubation in 6M guanidinium chloride for 2 h at 25 degrees does not cause measurable hydrolysis of the Glu-35 ester of delta1-hydroxytryptophan-108."
https://openalex.org/W2017252069,"Rabbit antisera have been produced against each of three purified human enzymes: a cytoplasmic form of NADP-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH, EC 1.1.1.42), phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI, EC 5.3.1.9), and hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT, EC 2.4.2.8), and they have been used for immunoprecipitation reactions to detect human-specific enzymes in various human-mouse somatic cell hybrids. Under optimal conditions, enzyme activity was eliminated from human cell lysate, but no reduction of enzyme activity was found in the mouse cell lysate. Differential enzyme precipitation by these human-specific antisera was observed in human-mouse hybrid cells. Analysis on starch gel electrophoresis revealed that not only the human homodimer, but also human-mouse heterodimer molecules, in cases of PGI and IDH, were precipitated. Thus this method is sensitive and allows quantitative determination of human-specific enzymes. The presence of a human-specific enzyme identified by this method correlated with the presence of a particular human chromosome permitting assignments of the human cytoplasmic forms of NADP-linked IDH, human PGI, and human HGPRT genes to chromosomes 2, 19, and X, respectively. These assignments are consistent with published data (Ruddle, 1973)."
https://openalex.org/W2056883651,Cesium chloride equilibrium density centrifugation shows that treatment of rat liver nuclei with low concentrations of micrococcal nuclease for extremely short periods of time results in the appearance of chromatin fractions of low protein/DNA ratio and even free DNA. The DNA of these chromatin fractions is shorter than the DNA moiety of one chromatin subunit. The amount of high buoyant density material is decreased with increasing digestion time. We conclude that this material belongs to the minor chromatin fraction which is not organized according to the subunit model.

https://openalex.org/W1573133529,"The metabolic network leading to accumulation of cellulose, trehalose, and mucopolysaccharide during development of Dictyostelium discoideum was simulated on a computer. The program consists of a metabolic map, the measured specific activity of the enzymes involved at each stage in development, and the substrate and inhibitor affinities. The Km values of four enzymes, amylase, UDP-galactose polysaccharide transferase, UDP-galactose epimerase, and cellulose synthetase, were determined for this study. At each iteration (1 min) during the period simulated (1500 min), the in vivo activity was calculated for each enzyme using Michaelis-Menten equations and new values for metabolites and end products were generated. The computed values for the concentration of both metabolites and polysaccharides were in close agreement with the measured values at all stages of development. We conclude that the in vitro measured values correlate well with the measured in vivo rates when treated in this manner. The program was modified to simulate the alterations in carbohydrate metabolism which might be expected in mutant strains with reduced activity of various enzymes. Trehalose was found to overaccumulate when either the peak value of the developmentally controlled increase in the specific activity of UDPGlc pyrophosphorylase was reduced. Trehalose accumulation was decreased in simulations of mutants lacking glycogen phosphorylase or glycogen synthetase. The interaction of these metabolic pathways is discussed."
