https://openalex.org/W2137840425,"Recently, more than 1000 large intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) have been reported. These RNAs are evolutionarily conserved in mammalian genomes and thus presumably function in diverse biological processes. Here, we report the identification of lincRNAs that are regulated by p53. One of these lincRNAs (lincRNA-p21) serves as a repressor in p53-dependent transcriptional responses. Inhibition of lincRNA-p21 affects the expression of hundreds of gene targets enriched for genes normally repressed by p53. The observed transcriptional repression by lincRNA-p21 is mediated through the physical association with hnRNP-K. This interaction is required for proper genomic localization of hnRNP-K at repressed genes and regulation of p53 mediates apoptosis. We propose a model whereby transcription factors activate lincRNAs that serve as key repressors by physically associating with repressive complexes and modulate their localization to sets of previously active genes."

https://openalex.org/W2068707753,"Although it is well established that tumors initiate an angiogenic switch, the molecular basis of this process remains incompletely understood. Here we show that the miRNA miR-132 acts as an angiogenic switch by targeting p120RasGAP in the endothelium and thereby inducing neovascularization. We identified miR-132 as a highly upregulated miRNA in a human embryonic stem cell model of vasculogenesis and found that miR-132 was highly expressed in the endothelium of human tumors and hemangiomas but was undetectable in normal endothelium. Ectopic expression of miR-132 in endothelial cells in vitro increased their proliferation and tube-forming capacity, whereas intraocular injection of an antagomir targeting miR-132, anti-miR-132, reduced postnatal retinal vascular development in mice. Among the top-ranking predicted targets of miR-132 was p120RasGAP, which we found to be expressed in normal but not tumor endothelium. Endothelial expression of miR-132 suppressed p120RasGAP expression and increased Ras activity, whereas a miRNA-resistant version of p120RasGAP reversed the vascular response induced by miR-132. Notably, administration of anti-miR-132 inhibited angiogenesis in wild-type mice but not in mice with an inducible deletion of Rasa1 (encoding p120RasGAP). Finally, vessel-targeted nanoparticle delivery of anti-miR-132 restored p120RasGAP expression in the tumor endothelium, suppressed angiogenesis and decreased tumor burden in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model of human breast carcinoma. We conclude that miR-132 acts as an angiogenic switch by suppressing endothelial p120RasGAP expression, leading to Ras activation and the induction of neovascularization, whereas the application of anti-miR-132 inhibits neovascularization by maintaining vessels in the resting state."
https://openalex.org/W1986558472,"New methods are emerging that aim to image chemical reactions as they occur, using X-ray diffraction, electron diffraction or laser-induced recollision. But none of these methods offer spectral selection, which allows a laser pulse with light of one wavelength to initiate a reaction, and a second pulse with another, appropriately selected wavelength to monitor the reacting molecules. Wörner et al. now show that this apparent limitation offers exciting opportunities for recollision-based high-harmonic spectroscopy: due to the coherent nature of the attosecond high-harmonic pulse generation, unexcited molecules can act as local oscillators against which structural and electronic dynamics is observed on an attosecond timescale. High-harmonic spectroscopy thus seems ideally suited to measure coupled electronic and nuclear dynamics in fast photochemical reactions, or to characterize short-lived transition states. New methods are emerging that aim to image chemical reactions as they occur using X-ray diffraction, electron diffraction or laser-induced recollision, but spectral selection cannot be used to monitor the reacting molecules for these methods. These authors show that this apparent limitation offers opportunities for recollision-based high-harmonic spectroscopy, in which unexcited molecules can act as local oscillators against which structural and electronic dynamics is observed on an attosecond timescale. The study of chemical reactions on the molecular (femtosecond) timescale typically uses pump laser pulses to excite molecules and subsequent probe pulses to interrogate them. The ultrashort pump pulse can excite only a small fraction of molecules, and the probe wavelength must be carefully chosen to discriminate between excited and unexcited molecules. The past decade has seen the emergence of new methods that are also aimed at imaging chemical reactions as they occur, based on X-ray diffraction1, electron diffraction2 or laser-induced recollision3,4—with spectral selection not available for any of these new methods. Here we show that in the case of high-harmonic spectroscopy based on recollision, this apparent limitation becomes a major advantage owing to the coherent nature of the attosecond high-harmonic pulse generation. The coherence allows the unexcited molecules to act as local oscillators against which the dynamics are observed, so a transient grating technique5,6 can be used to reconstruct the amplitude and phase of emission from the excited molecules. We then extract structural information from the amplitude, which encodes the internuclear separation, by quantum interference at short times and by scattering of the recollision electron at longer times. The phase records the attosecond dynamics of the electrons, giving access to the evolving ionization potentials and the electronic structure of the transient molecule. In our experiment, we are able to document a temporal shift of the high-harmonic field of less than an attosecond (1 as = 10−18 s) between the stretched and compressed geometry of weakly vibrationally excited Br2 in the electronic ground state. The ability to probe structural and electronic features, combined with high time resolution, make high-harmonic spectroscopy ideally suited to measuring coupled electronic and nuclear dynamics occurring in photochemical reactions and to characterizing the electronic structure of transition states."
https://openalex.org/W1981111142,"Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) have been linked to both familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease, but the biochemical function of LRRK2 has remained elusive. Now that function has been discovered. Both Drosophila and human LRRK2 are shown to antagonize microRNA-mediated translational inhibition of E2F1 and DP transcription factors. LRRK2 interacts with the RNA-induced silencing complex component Argonaute to antagonize its suppressive effect on protein translation. In vivo genetic studies demonstrate a key role for E2F1/DP upregulation in mediating mutant LRRK2 pathogenesis. These findings point to a link between impaired microRNA-mediated silencing and deregulated expression of specific microRNA targets to Parkinson's disease pathogenesis, and suggest possible microRNA-based therapeutic approaches. LRRK2 activity is dysregulated in Parkinson's disease, but how it contributes to the pathogenesis is unknown. These authors show that Drosophila LRRK2 interacts with the Argonaute component (dAgo1) of the RNA-induced silencing complex. This is associated with reduced levels of dAgo1, interaction between phospho-4E-BP1 and hAgo2, and impairment of microRNA-mediated repression. This leads to overexpression of the cell cycle genes e2f1 and dp, and consequent degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Gain-of-function mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) cause familial as well as sporadic Parkinson’s disease characterized by age-dependent degeneration of dopaminergic neurons1,2. The molecular mechanism of LRRK2 action is not known. Here we show that LRRK2 interacts with the microRNA (miRNA) pathway to regulate protein synthesis. Drosophila e2f1 and dp messenger RNAs are translationally repressed by let-7 and miR-184*, respectively. Pathogenic LRRK2 antagonizes these miRNAs, leading to the overproduction of E2F1/DP, previously implicated in cell cycle and survival control3 and shown here to be critical for LRRK2 pathogenesis. Genetic deletion of let-7, antagomir-mediated blockage of let-7 and miR-184* action, transgenic expression of dp target protector, or replacement of endogenous dp with a dp transgene non-responsive to let-7 each had toxic effects similar to those of pathogenic LRRK2. Conversely, increasing the level of let-7 or miR-184* attenuated pathogenic LRRK2 effects. LRRK2 associated with Drosophila Argonaute-1 (dAgo1) or human Argonaute-2 (hAgo2) of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). In aged fly brain, dAgo1 protein level was negatively regulated by LRRK2. Further, pathogenic LRRK2 promoted the association of phospho-4E-BP1 with hAgo2. Our results implicate deregulated synthesis of E2F1/DP caused by the miRNA pathway impairment as a key event in LRRK2 pathogenesis and suggest novel miRNA-based therapeutic strategies."

https://openalex.org/W2053943338,"In mammals, oocyte fertilization by sperm initiates development. This is followed by epigenetic reprogramming of both parental genomes, which involves the de novo establishment of chromatin domains. In the mouse embryo, methylation of histone H3 establishes an epigenetic asymmetry and is predominant in the maternal pronucleus. However, the roles of differential incorporation of histone H3 variants in the parental chromatin, and of modified residues within specific histone variants, have not been addressed. Here we show that the histone variant H3.3, and in particular lysine 27, is required for the establishment of heterochromatin in the mouse embryo. H3.3 localizes to paternal pericentromeric chromatin during S phase at the time of transcription of pericentromeric repeats. Mutation of H3.3 K27, but not of H3.1 K27, results in aberrant accumulation of pericentromeric transcripts, HP1 mislocalization, dysfunctional chromosome segregation and developmental arrest. This phenotype is rescued by injection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) derived from pericentromeric transcripts, indicating a functional link between H3.3K27 and the silencing of such regions by means of an RNA-interference (RNAi) pathway. Our work demonstrates a role for a modifiable residue within a histone-variant-specific context during reprogramming and identifies a novel function for mammalian H3.3 in the initial formation of dsRNA-dependent heterochromatin."

https://openalex.org/W2077243151,"Hundreds of proteins are inserted post-translationally into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane by a single carboxy-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD). During targeting through the cytosol, the hydrophobic TMD of these tail-anchored (TA) proteins requires constant chaperoning to prevent aggregation or inappropriate interactions. A central component of this targeting system is TRC40, a conserved cytosolic factor that recognizes the TMD of TA proteins and delivers them to the ER for insertion. The mechanism that permits TRC40 to find and capture its TA protein cargos effectively in a highly crowded cytosol is unknown. Here we identify a conserved three-protein complex composed of Bat3, TRC35 and Ubl4A that facilitates TA protein capture by TRC40. This Bat3 complex is recruited to ribosomes synthesizing membrane proteins, interacts with the TMDs of newly released TA proteins, and transfers them to TRC40 for targeting. Depletion of the Bat3 complex allows non-TRC40 factors to compete for TA proteins, explaining their mislocalization in the analogous yeast deletion strains. Thus, the Bat3 complex acts as a TMD-selective chaperone that effectively channels TA proteins to the TRC40 insertion pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2023201054,"The quantum Hall effect takes place in a two-dimensional electron gas under a strong magnetic field and involves current flow along the edges of the sample. For some particle–hole conjugate states of the fractional regime (for example, with fillings between 1/2 and 1 of the lowest Landau level), early predictions suggested the presence of counter-propagating edge currents in addition to the expected ones. When this did not agree with the measured conductance, it was suggested that disorder and interactions will lead to counter-propagating modes that carry only energy—the so called neutral modes. In addition, a neutral upstream mode (the Majorana mode) was expected for selected wavefunctions proposed for the even-denominator filling 5/2. Here we report the direct observation of counter-propagating neutral modes for fillings of 2/3, 3/5 and 5/2. The basis of our approach is that, if such modes impinge on a narrow constriction, the neutral quasiparticles will be partly reflected and fragmented into charge carriers, which can be detected through shot noise measurements. We find that the resultant shot noise is proportional to the injected current. Moreover, when we simultaneously inject a charge mode, the presence of the neutral mode was found to significantly affect the Fano factor and the temperature of the backscattered charge mode. In particular, such observations for filling 5/2 may single out the non-Abelian wavefunctions for the state. The quantum Hall effect involves current propagation along the edges of a two-dimensional electron gas in a strong magnetic field. It was predicted more than a decade ago that in the fractional regime (characterized by quasiparticles carrying fractional charges), counter-propagating modes would develop, carrying energy but not charge. These 'neutral modes' have proved elusive in experimental situations, but they have now been observed through measurements of electrical noise. This discovery opens up a new area of study, adding previously unknown energy modes to the well-studied charge modes in this field. The quantum Hall effect takes place in a two-dimensional electron gas under a strong magnetic field and involves current flow along the edges of the sample. In the fractional regime, counter-propagating modes that carry energy but not charge — the so-called neutral modes — have been predicted but never observed. These authors report the first direct observation of these elusive modes."
https://openalex.org/W2020658664,"One of the most remarkable results of quantum mechanics is the fact that many-body quantum systems may exhibit phase transitions even at zero temperature. Quantum fluctuations, deeply rooted in Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, and not thermal fluctuations, drive the system from one phase to another. Typically, the relative strength of two competing terms in the system's Hamiltonian is changed across a finite critical value. A well-known example is the Mott-Hubbard quantum phase transition from a superfluid to an insulating phase, which has been observed for weakly interacting bosonic atomic gases. However, for strongly interacting quantum systems confined to lower-dimensional geometry a novel type of quantum phase transition may be induced for which an arbitrarily weak perturbation to the Hamiltonian is sufficient to drive the transition. Here, for a one-dimensional (1D) quantum gas of bosonic caesium atoms with tunable interactions, we observe the commensurate-incommensurate quantum phase transition from a superfluid Luttinger liquid to a Mott-insulator. For sufficiently strong interactions, the transition is induced by adding an arbitrarily weak optical lattice commensurate with the atomic granularity, which leads to immediate pinning of the atoms. We map out the phase diagram and find that our measurements in the strongly interacting regime agree well with a quantum field description based on the exactly solvable sine-Gordon model. We trace the phase boundary all the way to the weakly interacting regime where we find good agreement with the predictions of the 1D Bose-Hubbard model. Our results open up the experimental study of quantum phase transitions, criticality, and transport phenomena beyond Hubbard-type models in the context of ultracold gases."
https://openalex.org/W2036732690,"We found rat central auditory neurons to fire action potentials in a precise sequence of mini-bursts before the age of hearing onset. This stereotyped pattern was initiated by hair cells in the cochlea, which trigger brief bursts of action potentials in auditory neurons each time they fire a Ca2+ spike. By generating theta-like activity, hair cells may limit the influence of synaptic depression in developing auditory circuits and promote consolidation of synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2022167676,"The flagellar motor drives the rotation of flagellar filaments at hundreds of revolutions per second, efficiently propelling bacteria through viscous media. The motor uses the potential energy from an electrochemical gradient of cations across the cytoplasmic membrane to generate torque. A rapid switch from anticlockwise to clockwise rotation determines whether a bacterium runs smoothly forward or tumbles to change its trajectory. A protein called FliG forms a ring in the rotor of the flagellar motor that is involved in the generation of torque through an interaction with the cation-channel-forming stator subunit MotA. FliG has been suggested to adopt distinct conformations that induce switching but these structural changes and the molecular mechanism of switching are unknown. Here we report the molecular structure of the full-length FliG protein, identify conformational changes that are involved in rotational switching and uncover the structural basis for the formation of the FliG torque ring. This allows us to propose a model of the complete ring and switching mechanism in which conformational changes in FliG reverse the electrostatic charges involved in torque generation."
https://openalex.org/W1999828349,"The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a master regulator of the cellular response to low oxygen. HIF-1α protein accumulates in hypoxia due to inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase enzymes, which under normoxic conditions use molecular oxygen to hydroxylate HIF-1α on two conserved proline residues (Pro402 and Pro564), thus targeting the protein for 26 S proteasome-dependent degradation. A functional mitochondrial electron transport chain is known to be necessary for HIF-1α stabilization in hypoxia. It has been reported that reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced under hypoxia by complex III of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, play a critical role in the stabilization of the HIF-1α protein, possibly by directly inhibiting prolyl hydroxylase enzymes. In contrast, we found that ROS production by complex III is not required for hypoxia-induced HIF-1α stabilization. Thus, reestablishing mitochondrial oxygen consumption in the presence of a complex III inhibitor by using an artificial electron donor to complex IV or by overexpressing Ciona intestinalis alternative oxidase results in HIF-1α protein stabilization in hypoxia. Furthermore, five inhibitors that target different sites of the mitochondrial electron transport chain have similar effects on the HIF-1α protein half-life in hypoxia but vary in their effects on mitochondrial ROS production. Finally, ROS do not regulate prolyl hydroxylase activity directly. We conclude that HIF-1α protein stabilization in hypoxia occurs independently of mitochondrial ROS production.

The oxygen-dependent regulation of the α subunit occurs at the level of its protein stability. At normal oxygen concentration, a family of prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) enzymes catalyzes the hydroxylation of two conserved proline residues in HIF-1α and HIF-2α (1Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M.

This reaction is dependent on both oxygen, which is a cosubstrate, and non-heme-reduced Fe2+, bound to the catalytic center of PHD enzymes. Hydroxylation of HIF-1α and HIF-2α at either of the two proline residues creates a recognition site for binding to the Von Hippel-Lindau (pVHL) protein. Binding of HIF-1α and HIF-2α to pVHL results in polyubiquitination by the pVHL-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase and degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Under hypoxic conditions, lack of oxygen inhibits PHD activity, thus leading to HIF-1α and HIF-2α protein stabilization and accumulation in the nucleus. hypoxia-inducible factor alternative oxidase diethyldithiocarbamate 2′-7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate electron transport chain prolyl hydroxylase Von Hippel-Lindau protein reactive oxygen species superoxide dismutase 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol. The mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), which consumes the vast majority of cellular oxygen and therefore directly controls intracellular oxygen tension, is known to play an important role in cellular oxygen sensing (3Tormos K.V.

Indeed, inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by pharmacological or genetic means prevents the accumulation of both HIF-1α and HIF-2α upon exposure of cells to hypoxia (5Chandel N.S.

Science. 2003; 302: 1975-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been suggested that mitochondrial activity regulates the HIF-1α protein by determining the amount of oxygen available for PHD enzymes (7Hagen T. Taylor C.T. Lam F. Moncada S.

However, given that the mitochondrial ETC is also the major source of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in most cell types, an alternative mechanism has been proposed (9Brunelle J.K. Bell E.L.

According to this model, increased amounts of ROS produced under hypoxia by complex III of the mitochondrial ETC are required for hypoxia-dependent HIF-1α stabilization. The absence of a functional, ROS-producing ETC therefore prevents hypoxia-dependent HIF-1α stabilization. Given the universal importance of the cellular hypoxic response for normal cell physiology and the critical involvement of HIF in ischemic diseases and in cancer, we studied in detail the mechanism through which mitochondria regulate the HIF-1α protein. To this end, we used a number of approaches, including manipulations that specifically alter mitochondrial oxygen consumption without affecting ROS production, to show that the primary mechanism through which the mitochondrial ETC controls HIF-1α stability is by regulating the cellular oxygen availability. Human osteosarcoma 143B cells were cultured in RPMI (Roswell Park Memorial Institute) 1640 medium, whereas human kidney epithelial HEK293 cells and HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). Both media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). Hypoxic condition (1% O2, 94% N2, and 5% CO2) was achieved in a humidified variable aerobic work station (Coy Laboratories Products, Grass Lake, MI) or a Pro-ox 110 oxygen controller and Pro-ox in vitro chamber (BioSpherix, Redfield, NY). Cell lysis and Western blotting were carried out as previously described (39Chew E.H. Matthews C.S. Zhang J. McCarroll A.J. Hagen T. Stevens M.F. Westwell A.D. Bradshaw T.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Western blots shown are representative of at least two independent experiments. Superoxide production was estimated using dihydroethidium. Cells were plated in 12-well plates and grown to 70% confluence and cotreated with 20 μm dihydroethidium and mitochondrial inhibitors for 30 min. Subsequently, the cells were rinsed with PBS and kept in PBS for analysis of fluorescence using a multiwell plate reader (Molecular Devices, excitation and emission wavelengths were 520 nm and 610 nm, respectively). The validity of this assay has previously been verified by using menadione and 2-methoxyestradiol as positive controls (40Chua Y.S. Chua Y.L. Hagen T. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2010; 9: 224-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Oxygen consumption was measured with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Oxygraph; Hansatech) in Krebs buffer using cells at a density of 1.6 × 108/ml. HEK293T cells were infected with 4 μl of concentrated pWPI-AOX-IRES-GFP lentiviral preparation (18Dassa E.P. Dufour E. Gonçalves S. Paupe V. Hakkaart G.A. Jacobs H.T. Rustin P. EMBO Mol.

HEK293T-infected cells were subjected to two successive rounds of purification, first plating the infected population in 96-well plates at a density of one cell/well and then subjecting each of the single clones obtained from this seeding to limited dilution using 1/3 serial dilutions. AOX expression in subclones was verified by polarography using a Clark-type oxygen electrode. Mitochondria were isolated from mouse liver by differential centrifugation in mitochondria isolation buffer containing 280 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and 1 mm EDTA. Measurement of complex I activity was carried out as previously described (42Birch-Machin M.A. Briggs H.L. Saborido A.A. Bindoff L.A. Turnbull D.M. Biochem. Med. Metab. Biol. 1994; 51: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) using 0.1 mg of mouse liver mitochondria. Mitochondria were subjected to freeze-thawing prior to the assay. Murine catalase was PCR-amplified from I.M.A.G.E. clone (ID 4241333) and inserted in the retroviral expression vector Puro-MaRX (a gift from Dr. David Beach). It has been previously shown that a robust overexpression of catalase results in accumulation of the protein in the cytoplasm. The N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence of SOD2 (comprising the sequence corresponding to residues 1–28) was used to target catalase to mitochondria. This construct also included a C-terminal V5 epitope tag. Retroviral particles were generated using catalase, mitochondrial catalase-V5, or enhanced GFP (control) containing Puro-MaRX retroviral expression vector in 293-gag-pol cells and pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus-G. Protein expression was assessed by immunofluorescence (enhanced GFP) or immunoblotting with catalase antibody. H2O2 scavenging capacity was estimated using DCFDA. 143B cells resuspended in Krebs buffer containing 10 mm glucose were loaded with 20 μm DCFDA for 15 min at 37 °C and analyzed by flow cytometry using the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) channel (log mode) both before and after treating with 200 μm H2O2 for 5 min. In each analysis, 10,000 events were recorded. GST-HIF-1α fusion protein plasmid was generated by inserting the HIF-1α coding sequence corresponding to 521–652 amino acids into the pGEX-KG vector. The GST fusion protein was expressed in BL21 cells and purified using GSH-agarose beads. The immobilized GST-HIF was subjected to prolyl hydroxylation assays in the presence of cell lysate from HEK293 cells transfected with PHD2 and VHL and 2 mm 2-oxoglutarate and 2 mm ascorbate for 1 h at room temperature. After the assay, the cell lysate was removed, and the beads were washed 3 times using Nonidet P-40 wash buffer (containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm NaCl) and washed once using PBS. pVHL bound to GST-HIF fusion protein was analyzed by Western blotting. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Differences in measured variables were assessed with Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. ROS are produced to different degrees at the various complexes of the mitochondrial ETC. We initially determined whether any specific site within the mitochondrial ETC is required for hypoxia-dependent HIF-1α stabilization. To this end, we tested the effects of various inhibitors of the ETC on 143B human osteosarcoma cells grown under hypoxic conditions (1% oxygen) for 4 h. HIF-1α protein accumulation was prevented upon treatment with the different inhibitors (rotenone, myxothiazol, antimycin A, stigmatellin, sodium azide) at concentrations that completely inhibit ETC activity (Fig. 1A). Thus, the requirement of a functional ETC is not restricted to complex III. To examine this further, we obtained a more quantitative measurement of the effect of the mitochondrial inhibitors by measuring the rate at which the HIF-1α protein is degraded. HEK293 cells were subjected to hypoxic conditions for 3 h followed by incubation with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide in the presence or the absence of inhibitors for different durations. In the presence of cycloheximide, there was a slow gradual decrease in the HIF-1α protein concentration. However, in the presence of both cycloheximide and the complex III inhibitor myxothiazol, HIF-1α protein was degraded at a much faster rate (Fig. 1B). We repeated the same experiment using different mitochondrial inhibitors (rotenone, antimycin A, sodium azide, DETA-NONOate), as summarized in Fig. 1C. The HIF-1α half-life in hypoxia in control cells was 32.99 min. All inhibitors of the mitochondrial ETC decreased the HIF-1α half-life to similar degrees (rotenone t½ = 8.94 min; myxothiazol t½ = 9.95 min; antimycin A t½ = 5.74 min; sodium azide t½ = 8.59 min; DETA-NONOate t½ = 10.72 min). These results therefore indicate that inhibition of any site in the mitochondrial ETC inhibits hypoxia-dependent HIF-1α protein induction by decreasing its half-life. Next, we also tested the effects of the inhibitors on ROS production in both normoxia and hypoxia by measuring the superoxide-dependent oxidation of the fluorescent dye dihydroethidium. In the untreated cells, there was no significant increase in the superoxide concentration in hypoxia compared with normoxia. Of the mitochondrial ETC inhibitors, only sodium azide reduced superoxide production in both hypoxia and normoxia significantly. There was no significant change with nitric oxide donor and a slight increase was observed with the other inhibitors (Fig. 1D). Thus, there is no correlation between the effects of the various inhibitors on superoxide production and hypoxia-dependent HIF-1α protein stabilization, suggesting that superoxide may not play an important role in HIF-1α protein stabilization. To establish further whether the effects of mitochondrial inhibitors on HIF-1α are due to inhibition of mitochondrial oxygen consumption or inhibition of ROS production from complex III, we investigated the effect of myxothiazol on HIF-1α protein accumulation in the presence of 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,3-pentanediol (TMPD). The complex III inhibitor myxothiazol has been reported to inhibit complex III-dependent superoxide production, whereas TMPD is an artificial electron donor that donates electrons to cytochrome c and complex IV downstream of complex III. As a result, oxygen consumption is reactivated even in the presence of myxothiazol as illustrated in Fig. 2A. We then determined the effect of TMPD on hypoxia-dependent HIF-1α stabilization. TMPD by itself had no effect on the HIF-1α protein concentration in hypoxia (Fig. 2B). However, TMPD completely rescued myxothiazol-induced inhibition of HIF-1α stabilization. This indicates that in the presence of an inhibitor of complex III, reestablishing oxygen consumption via complex IV is sufficient for HIF-1α stabilization. The result suggests that electron transport via complex III and superoxide derived from complex III are not required for HIF-1α induction. Therefore, the effect of myxothiazol is likely due to inhibition of mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Next, we repeated the HIF-1α half-life measurements in the presence of TMPD. As shown in Fig. 2C, addition of TMPD increased the HIF-1α half-life in the presence myxothiazol from 9.95 min to 28.91 min, which is similar to the untreated control (t½ = 32.99 min). A very similar trend was observed with a different complex III inhibitor, antimycin A (increase in the HIF-1α half-life from 5.74 min to 23.70 min in the absence versus presence of TMPD). These results further suggested that HIF-1α protein stabilization is independent of ROS produced by complex III. AOX is a mitochondrial enzyme that is expressed in plants, some fungi, protists, and lower metazoa (12McDonald A.E. Funct. Plant Biol. 2008; 35: 535-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It has two reported physiological functions: to carry out thermogenesis and to lower the ROS production during mitochondrial electron transport (13Van Aken O. Giraud E. Clifton R. Whelan J. Physiol. Plant. 2009; 137: 354-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 14Maxwell D.P. Wang Y. McIntosh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The AOX protein is localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane. It accepts electrons from coenzyme Q and uses the electrons to reduce oxygen to water directly, therefore bypassing complex III and IV. As a consequence, electron transport via complex III is decreased, resulting in lower superoxide production from complex III via the Q cycle while maintaining mitochondrial oxygen consumption. We have previously shown that AOX derived from Ciona intestinalis is well tolerated in mammalian cells, functional, and can confer complex III and complex IV inhibitor-resistant respiration (17Fernandez-Ayala D.J. Sanz A. Vartiainen S. Kemppainen K.K. Babusiak M. Mustalahti E. Costa R. Tuomela T. Zeviani M. Chung J. O'Dell K.M. Rustin P. Jacobs H.T.

To genetically determine whether HIF-1α stabilization is dependent on mitochondrial ROS from complex III, we utilized HEK293T cells with stable AOX expression. We first compared the respiratory properties of both wild type and AOX-expressing HEK293T cells by measuring their oxygen consumption polarographically using a Clark-type oxygen electrode. When subjected to myxothiazol and rotenone, respiration of the wild type cells was inhibited by 75.7% and 84.8%, respectively (Fig. 3A). However, in the AOX-expressing cells, respiration was inhibited by only 42.8% when myxothiazol was present (Fig. 3A). Subsequent addition of rotenone resulted in similar inhibition (78.5%) as observed in control cells. Thus, the AOX-expressing cells still consume oxygen even in the presence of myxothiazol, due to their ability to bypass both complex III and IV and utilize AOX to consume oxygen. Next, we determined the effect of AOX protein expression on the cellular superoxide concentration in the presence of different mitochondrial ETC inhibitors. AOX reduced superoxide production in the presence of the complex III inhibitors myxothiazol and antimycin A but had no effect on superoxide when the complex I inhibitor rotenone was present (Fig. 3B). Thus, as expected, AOX only inhibits complex III-dependent superoxide production. To investigate whether reestablishing oxygen consumption under conditions where complex III is inactive is sufficient for hypoxia-dependent HIF-1α stabilization, we treated wild type and AOX-expressing HEK293T cells with mitochondrial inhibitors under hypoxic conditions. In wild type cells, HIF-1α protein accumulation was prevented in the presence of inhibitors of complex I, III, and IV (Fig. 3C). In AOX-expressing cells, HIF-1α induction was also inhibited with complex I inhibitor, rotenone. This result is expected because rotenone inhibits electron transport upstream of AOX. In contrast, antimycin A and sodium azide had no inhibitory effect on HIF-1α expression in AOX-expressing cells. These cells still consume oxygen via the AOX protein, but do not produce increased superoxide because electron transport via complex III is prevented. These results suggest that mitochondrial ETC regulates HIF-1α stability by controlling intracellular oxygen but not ROS concentration. Unexpectedly, HIF-1α expression was still significantly inhibited when AOX-expressing cells were treated with myxothiazol. Myxothiazol is also a complex III inhibitor. Therefore, its inhibitory effect on hypoxia-dependent HIF-1α accumulation would be expected to be reversed when AOX is expressed and oxygen can be consumed independently from complex III. A possible explanation for this finding is that the concentration of 1 μm myxothiazol that was used is high enough to inhibit complex I also. Indeed, it has been previously reported that at higher concentrations myxothiazol also functions as complex I inhibitor (see Ref. 20Degli Esposti M. Ghelli A. Crimi M. Estornell E. Fato R. Lenaz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 1090-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To confirm this hypothesis, both wild type and AOX-expressing cells were treated with different concentrations of myxothiazol under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 3D). In the wild type cells, hypoxia-dependent HIF-1α stabilization was prevented at any concentration of myxothiazol. In contrast, in AOX-expressing cells, HIF-1α could be detected at the lower myxothiazol concentrations (100 nm and 250 nm) but not at the higher concentration of 1 μm. When measuring the effects of the different myxothiazol concentrations on mitochondrial complex I activity in mouse liver mitochondria, significant inhibition was observed with 500 nm and 1 μm, but not with lower concentrations of myxothiazol (Fig. 3E). The results indicate that the inhibition of HIF-1α accumulation in AOX-expressing cells by 1 μm myxothiazol (as observed in Fig. 3C) is due to an inhibitory effect on complex I. In contrast, AOX expression prevents the inhibition of hypoxia-dependent HIF-1α stabilization by concentrations of myxothiazol which specifically inhibit complex III. Our results indicate that increasing mitochondrial oxygen consumption in the absence of electron transport via complex III is sufficient for hypoxia-dependent HIF-1α accumulation. To assess the role of ROS in mediating HIF-1α stabilization directly, we used glucose oxidase/glucose to produce constant amounts of H2O2. At glucose oxidase concentrations of 250 milliunits/ml and higher, toxic effects on 143B cells were observed. We therefore used a range of lower glucose oxidase concentration of 25, 100, and 200 milliunits/ml. Based on dichlorofluorescein fluorescence calibration with known amounts of H2O2, addition of 100 milliunits/ml glucose oxidase to 143B cells over a 15-min period resulted in DCF fluorescence that was similar to exposure of cells to 200 μm H2O2. We found that glucose oxidase/glucose-derived H2O2 at any concentration was without effect on HIF-1α protein accumulation during hypoxia (supplemental Fig. S1A). To test further whether H2O2 is involved in HIF-1α stabilization, we retrovirally overexpressed both mitochondria-targeted and cytosolic catalase in 143B cells. The catalase-transduced cells had markedly increased catalase protein expression and H2O2 scavenging capacity (supplemental Fig. S1B). However, HIF-1α protein in cells that overexpressed either form of catalase was still induced in hypoxia to the same degree despite lower amounts of mitochondrial ROS release (supplemental Fig. S1B). These results suggest that mitochondrial or exogenous ROS are not involved in the stabilization of the HIF-1α protein. According to the ROS hypothesis, increased mitochondrial superoxide released from complex III will be converted to H2O2 which inhibits the PHD enzyme in the cytoplasm, possibly by oxidizing the non-heme-bound Fe2+ in the PHD active site (3Tormos K.V. Chandel N.S. J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2010; 14: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). PHD enzymes in the presence of oxygen hydroxylate Pro402 and Pro564 residues in HIF-1α, leading to binding of the pVHL/Cul2 E3 ligase and consequently ubiquitination and degradation of HIF-1α. To determine directly the effect of H2O2 on the enzymatic activity of PHD, an in vitro PHD assay was carried out using cell lysate to mimic physiological conditions. In this assay, the C-terminal oxygen-dependent degradation domain of HIF-1α containing proline 564 was fused to GST [GST-HIF-1α(521–652)-V5] and immobilized on GSH agarose beads. Cell lysate containing PHD2 and pVHL was used to hydroxylate the recombinant GST-HIF-1α protein. Binding of pVHL to hydroxylated HIF-1α was used as an indicator of Pro564 hydroxylation. pVHL bound to HIF-1α in the presence of the PHD cosubstrate 2-oxoglutarate and the cofactor ascorbate but showed reduced binding in the presence of the PHD inhibitor dimethyloxaloylglycine. As expected, there was no binding of pVHL to HIF-1α upon treatment with the Fe2+ chelator deferoxamine mesylate in the absence of 2-oxoglutarate and ascorbate. There was also no significant pVHL binding to GST-HIF-1α(521–652)-V5 after mutation of Pro564 to Ala in the recombinant HIF-1α fusion protein (Fig. 4A, right panel). In the presence of 50 μm and 200 μm H2O2, pVHL binding was not affected, suggesting that H2O2 does not directly inhibit PHD (Fig. 4A). We also tested whether superoxide affects PHD activity by using xanthine/xanthine oxidase as a superoxide-generating system. In contrast to H2O2, superoxide caused an ∼50% reduction in binding of pVHL to HIF-1α (Fig. 4B), suggesting that superoxide inhibits PHD activity partially. Although H2O2, after conversion from complex III-derived superoxide, has been proposed as the mediator that causes PHD inhibition under hypoxia (10Guzy R.D. Hoyos B. Robin E. Chen H. Liu L.

To this end, cells were treated with SOD1 inhibitor diethyldithiocarbamate (DCC), the SOD mimetic MnTBAP and the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine and ascorbate which are known to scavenge superoxide (21Yang S.

Entangled photon pairs can be created by spontaneous parametric down-conversion of laser light, but until now it has not been possible to produce photon triplets in this way. Hübel et al. now report the direct generation of photon triplets using a cascade of photon-pair sources, in which each triplet originates from just a single pump photon, leading to quantum correlations between all three photons. Non-classical states of light, such as entangled photon states, form an essential quantum resource. Entangled photon pairs can be created by spontaneous parametric down-conversion of laser light, but so far it has not been possible to produce photon triplets in this way. These authors report the generation of quantum-correlated photon triplets by cascaded down-conversion of a single pump photon. This should find widespread use in optical quantum technologies. Non-classical states of light, such as entangled photon pairs and number states, are essential for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics and optical quantum technologies. The most widespread technique for creating these quantum resources is spontaneous parametric down-conversion of laser light into photon pairs1. Conservation of energy and momentum in this process, known as phase-matching, gives rise to strong correlations that are used to produce two-photon entanglement in various degrees of freedom2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. It has been a longstanding goal in quantum optics to realize a source that can produce analogous correlations in photon triplets, but of the many approaches considered, none has been technically feasible10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. Here we report the observation of photon triplets generated by cascaded down-conversion. Each triplet originates from a single pump photon, and therefore quantum correlations will extend over all three photons18 in a way not achievable with independently created photon pairs19. Our photon-triplet source will allow experimental interrogation of novel quantum correlations20, the generation of tripartite entanglement12,21 without post-selection and the generation of heralded entangled photon pairs suitable for linear optical quantum computing22. Two of the triplet photons have a wavelength matched for optimal transmission in optical fibres, suitable for three-party quantum communication23. Furthermore, our results open interesting regimes of non-linear optics, as we observe spontaneous down-conversion pumped by single photons, an interaction also highly relevant to optical quantum computing."

Probing trinucleotide repeat structures using engineered zinc-finger nucleases provides evidence that DNA hairpins form in vivo and are linked to replication-dependent genomic instability. Instability of (CTG)•(CAG) microsatellite trinucleotide repeat (TNR) sequences is responsible for more than a dozen neurological or neuromuscular diseases. TNR instability during DNA synthesis is thought to involve slipped-strand or hairpin structures in template or nascent DNA strands, although direct evidence for hairpin formation in human cells is lacking. We have used targeted recombination to create a series of isogenic HeLa cell lines in which (CTG)•(CAG) repeats are replicated from an ectopic copy of the Myc (also known as c-myc) replication origin. In this system, the tendency of chromosomal (CTG)•(CAG) tracts to expand or contract was affected by origin location and the leading or lagging strand replication orientation of the repeats, and instability was enhanced by prolonged cell culture, increased TNR length and replication inhibition. Hairpin cleavage by synthetic zinc finger nucleases in these cells has provided the first direct evidence for the formation of hairpin structures during replication in vivo."

A number of novel molecules have been reported to increase bone formation including cysteine-rich protein 61 (CYR61), a ligand of integrin receptor, but mechanisms remain unclear. It is known that bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), especially BMP-2, are crucial regulators of osteogenesis. However, the interaction between CYR61 and BMP-2 is unclear. We found that CYR61 significantly increases proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts and primary cultured osteoblasts. CYR61 enhances mRNA and protein expression of BMP-2 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Moreover, CYR61-mediated proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation are significantly decreased by knockdown of BMP-2 expression or inhibition of BMP-2 activity. In this study we found integrin αvβ3 is critical for CYR61-mediated BMP-2 expression and osteoblastic differentiation. We also found that integrin-linked kinase, which is downstream of the αvβ3 receptor, is involved in CYR61-induced BMP-2 expression and subsequent osteoblastic differentiation through an ERK-dependent pathway.

Bone is a mineralized tissue that underlies multiple mechanical and metabolic functions of the skeleton (1Ducy P. Schinke T. Karsenty G. Science. 2000; 289: 1501-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Bone functions include maintaining blood calcium levels, providing mechanical support to soft tissues and serving as levers for muscle action, supporting hematopoiesis, and housing the brain and spinal cord (2Harada S. Rodan G.A. Nature. 2003; 423: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Formation and maintenance of bone tissue are regulated in a sophisticated fashion by bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts (3Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2003; 4: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). Development and differentiation of these two cell types are under tight regulation by a number of endogenous substances such as hormones, growth factors, and cytokines (4Manolagas S.C. Jilka R.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). These factors are individually secreted through endocrine, paracrine/autocrine, and neurocrine systems, with subsequent interaction essential to the delicate balance between bone-forming and -resorbing cells in the marrow microenvironment. An imbalance between the two cell types leads to pathogenesis of certain bone diseases including osteopetrosis and osteoporosis (5Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L.

Osteoporosis is the most common human metabolic bone disorder characterized by progressive and age-dependent bone loss and increasing bone fracture risk. It is an important public health issue in postmenopausal women; if untreated, more than half of white women will experience fractures during their lifetime. Between 30 and 50% of women and 15–30% of men will suffer a fracture related to osteoporosis in their lifetime (7Randell A. Sambrook P.N. Nguyen T.V. Lapsley H. Jones G. Kelly P.J. Eisman J.A. Osteoporos. Int. 1995; 5: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Fractures increase morbidity and mortality and impose a financial burden on the community (8Center J.R. Nguyen T.V.

A most compelling therapeutic need for osteoporosis at the present time is a drug that will substantially increase bone formation. The use of an anabolic agent that stimulates bone formation, restores trabecular bone microarchitecture, and rebuilds bone that has been lost, possibly in conjunction with an inhibitor of bone resorption, would be an ideal therapeutic approach for patients. Therefore, it is clearly necessary to identify novel molecular targets to develop bone-forming drugs aimed to combat osteoporosis by rebuilding the lost bone. Multiple anabolic signaling pathways are positively involved in controlling bone formation, such as bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), 3The abbreviations used are: BMPbone morphogenetic proteinCCN familyconnective tissue growth factor/cysteine-rich 61/nephroblastoma-overexpressed familyCYR61cysteine-rich protein 61rCYR61recombinant CYR61ILKintegrin-linked kinaseGSK3βglycogen synthase kinase 3βqPCRquantitative real-time PCRαMEMα-minimal essential mediumMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromideALPalkaline phosphatase.

Schütze N. Siggelkow H. Seufert J. Jakob F.

Because these two mechanisms were found to induce BMP2 gene expression in osteoblasts (19Virdi A.S. Cook L.J. Oreffo R.O. Triffitt J.T. Cell Mol.

This study was designed to test this hypothesis and also determine the precise signaling mechanisms involved in CYR61 regulation of BMP2 transcription in osteoblasts. In the current work we found that CYR61 increases cell proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation; these results fit in with previous studies (36Schütze N. Lechner A. Groll C. Siggelkow H. Hüfner M. Köhrle J. Jakob F. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1761-1770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Si W. Kang Q. Luu H.H. Park J.K. Luo Q. Song W.X. Jiang W. Luo X. Li X. Yin H. Montag A.G.

BMP-2-dependent phenomenon is critical for CYR61-induced osteogenic effects in fetal mouse pre-osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells and primary cultured osteoblast cells. In addition, αvβ3 integrin/integrin-linked kinase (ILK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways are involved in CYR61-mediated induction of BMP-2 expression and subsequent cell proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation. Anti-mouse BMP-2 antibody, BMP-2 ELISA kit, and noggin were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Anti-α-tubulin antibody, anti-pERK1/2 or ERK1 antibodies, anti-pAKT1/2/3 (ser-473) or total AKT-1 antibodies, anti-pJNK or JNK antibodies, anti-p-p38 or total p38 antibodies, and protein A/G beads were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Recombinant CYR61 protein was purchased from Abnova (Taipei, Taiwan). Chemicals, anti-β-actin antibody, and an Alkaline Phosphatase activity kit were purchased from Sigma. An in vitro osteogenesis kit and αvβ3 neutralizing antibody were purchased from Chemicom (Temecula, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibody for ILK was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Rabbit polyclonal antibody for glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and phosphor-GSK3β were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). MC3T3-E1 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and grown in αMEM (Invitrogen, catalog no. 001008-3DJ, Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Medium was changed every 48 h. Murine primary osteoblastic cells (pOB cells) were prepared as described previously (40Tang C.H. Hsu T.L. Lin W.W. Lai M.Z. Yang R.S. Hsieh S.L. Fu W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2346-2354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Calvaria were dissected from murine fetuses, divided into small pieces, and treated with 0.1% type I collagenase solution for 10 min at 37 °C. The next two 20-min sequential collagenase digestions were pooled and filtered through 70-μm nylon filters (Falcon, NJ). Cells were grown on plastic cell culture dishes in 95% air, 5% CO2 with αMEM that was supplemented with 20 mm HEPES and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mm glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). The characteristics of osteoblasts were confirmed by morphology and expression of AP enzymatic activity. Growth rates of recombinant CYR61 (rCYR61)-treated MC3T3-E1 cells were determined using MTT as a substrate. The MTT assay is based on the activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenases, which reduce the water-soluble tetrazolium salt to a purple insoluble formazan product. The amount of MTT formazan product was analyzed spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 570 nm. Each individual experiment was repeated at least three times. Aliquots of 1000 cells were seeded into six-well culture dishes. The next day cells were exposed to recombinant CYR61 protein in serum-free medium at the appropriate times. Cells were washed and further incubated with 2% FCS medium until further analysis. After incubation for 7 days, cells were washed with 1× PBS and fixed with methanol at room temperature for 10–20 min. After washing with 1x PBS again, cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet, PBS, and colonies were counted. All experiments were carried out in triplicate. Migration assays were performed using modified Boyden chambers with filter inserts for 24-well dishes containing 8-μm pores (Nucleopore Corp, Pleasanton, CA). Cells (2 × 104) were plated into 100 μl of complete αMEM in the upper chamber, and the lower chamber was filled with 1 ml of αMEM with various doses of rCYR61 or PBS. After 12 h in culture, cells were fixed in methanol for 15 min and stained with 0.05% crystal violet in PBS for 15 min. Cells on the upper side of filters were removed with cotton-tipped swabs, and filters were washed in PBS. Cells on the underside of filters were viewed and counted under a microscope (type 090-135.001, Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Each clone was plated in triplicate in each experiment, and each experiment was repeated at least three times. For the wound-healing migration assay, cells were seeded on 12-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in culture medium. At 24 h after seeding, the confluent monolayer of culture was scratched with a fine pipette tip, and migration was visualized by microscope and magnification. The rate of wound closure was observed at the indicated time. To induce differentiation, confluent MC3T3-E1 cells were transferred to differentiation medium (αMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.2 mm ascorbic acid (Sigma), and 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate (Sigma) Osteogenesis was determined by staining with Alizarin red solution. Cells were washed with PBS or Hanks' balanced salt solution and then fixed with 70% ethanol for 15 min. After fixation, cells were rinsed three times with distilled water for 10∼15 min each time. One ml of Alizarin red solution was added into the well followed by incubation at room temperature for at least 20 min. Excess dye was removed, and then cells were washed four times with deionized water. Differentiated cells containing mineral deposits stained bright red with Alizarin red solution. After photography, bound staining was eluted with 10% (w/v) cetylpyridinium chloride, and Alizarin red solution in samples was quantified by measuring absorbance at 550 nm and calculated according to a standard curve. One molar Alizarin solution selectively binds about 2 mol of calcium. MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured in αMEM containing 50 μg/ml vitamin C and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate for 2 weeks, with medium changed every 3 days. After 14 days, cells were harvested in 1 ml of 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and the cell suspension was disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min, ALP activity in the supernatant was measured using the method of Lowry et al. (41Lowry O.H. Roberts N.R. Wu M.L. Hixon W.S. Crawford E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1954; 207: 19-37Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (5 μg) was reverse-transcribed into single-stranded cDNA using a Moloney murine leukemia-virus reverse transcriptase and random hexamers (Promega, Madison, WI). Primers were used at a final concentration of 0.5 μm. The reaction mixture was first denatured at 95 °C for 5 min. The cDNAs were amplified with the forward (F) and reverse (R) primers by PCR as described. The primer sequences for BMP-2 were 5′-CCAAGAGACATGTGAGGATT-3′ (F) and 5′-TTAGTGGAGTTCAGGTGGTC-3′ (R). The primer sequences for BMP-4 were 5′-ACGACTACTGGACACCAGAC-3′ (F) and 5′-GTTGGTTGAGTTGAGGTGAT-3′ (R). The primer sequences for BMP-6 were 5′-GACATCACAGCAACTAGCAA-3′ (F) and 5′-AGGAACACTCTCCATCACAG-3′ (R). The primer sequences for BMP-7 were 5′-GCTTACAGCTCTCTGTGGAG-3′ (F) and 5′-GGTTGATGAAGTGAACAAGT-3′ (R). The primer sequences for BMP-9 were 5′-TACCACTATGAGGGGATGAG-3′ (F) and 5′-CTATGAGCCACAGGAGAGTC-3′ (R). The primer sequences for GAPDH were 5′-CTCACTCAAGATTGTCAGCA-3′ (F) and 5′-GTCATCATACTTGGCAGGTT-3′ (R). PCR conditions were 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min followed by 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were visualized by ethidium bromide staining after agarose gel electrophoresis. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis was carried out using Taqman one-step PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). One hundred nanograms of total cDNA were added per 25 μl reaction with sequence-specific primers and Taqman probes. Sequences for all target gene primers and probes were purchased commercially (GAPDH was used as internal control) (Applied Biosystems). The qPCR assays were carried out in triplicate on an ABI Prism 7900 sequence detection system. Cycling conditions were 10 min of polymerase activation at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s. The threshold was set above the non-template control background and within the linear phase of target gene amplification to calculate the cycle number at which transcript was detected (denoted CT). MC3T3-E1 cells were incubated in serum-free αMEM during treatment with rCYR61 (100 ng/ml), and cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaF, 200 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin) for 15 min on ice. Cellular lysates were prepared as described previously (48Tang C.H. Yang R.S. Chien M.Y. Chen C.C. Fu W.M. Eur. J Pharmacol. 2008; 579: 40-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). An equal quantity of protein from cell lysates was resuspended in gel sample buffer, resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore). After blocking, blots were incubated with specific primary antibodies, and after washing and incubating with secondary antibodies, immunoreactive proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (GE Healthcare). Where indicated, membranes were stripped and reprobed with another antibody. BMP-2 ELISA kits were used to detect BMP-2 levels. Briefly, cells were treated with various concentrations of rCYR61 for the indicated time. Culture medium was collected for measurement of BMP-2. Samples were placed in 96-well microtiter plates coated with monoclonal detective antibodies and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After removing unbound material by washing with washing buffer (50 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin was added to bind to the antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase catalyzed conversion of the chromogenic substrate (tetramethylbenzidine) to a colored solution, with color intensity proportional to the amount of protein present in the sample. The absorbance of each well was measured at 450 nm. Results are presented as the percentage of change in activity compared with activity in untreated controls. ILK enzymatic activity was assayed in MC3T3-E1 cells lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) as previous reported (42Tan C. Cruet-Hennequart S. Troussard A. Fazli L. Costello P. Sutton K. Wheeler J. Gleave M. Sanghera J. Dedhar S. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 79-90Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Briefly, ILK was immunoprecipitated with ILK antibody overnight at 4 °C from 250 μg of lysate. After immunoprecipitation, beads were resuspended in 30 liters of kinase buffer containing 1 mg of recombinant substrate (GSK3 fusion protein) and 200 m cold ATP, and the reaction was carried out for 30 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylated substrate was visualized by Western blot with phosphor-GSK3β antibody. Total GSK3β was detected with the appropriate antibody. Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. Student's t test was used to compare data between groups. All statistical tests included two-way analysis of variance. p values of less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. In this study we investigated the role of CYR61 in osteoblast proliferation and differentiation. We found that treatment with rCYR61 protein significantly increased proliferation of mouse osteoblast MC3T3-E1 cells in a dose-dependent manner to ∼200 ng/ml (Fig. 1A), after which we found that higher concentrations of rCYR61 decrease the proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells (supplemental Fig. 1A). The above data imply that CYR61 may has a biphasic effect on MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation. The different results of CYR61 on MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation reported by our study and that Craig et al. (61Craig T.A. Bhattacharya R. Mukhopadhyay D. Kumar R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 392: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) may be caused by the different experimental conditions and the biphasic effect of CYR61. Colony formation assay produced similar results (Fig. 1B). We also treated MC3T3-E1 cells with rCYR61 in a time-dependent manner (0, 24, 48, 72 h) and found that CYR61-induced MC3T3-E1 cells proliferation was detectable at 48 h as well as 72 h (supplemental Fig. 1B). Because osteoblastic differentiation is a complicated process that includes proliferation and migration of osteoblasts, we also tested the migrative ability of MC3T3-E1 cells after treatment with rCYR61. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, rCYR61 significantly induced migration of MC3T3-E1 cells in both a Boyden chamber assay and in wound healing analyses in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In the in vitro differentiation assay, mineralization of MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts and primary cultured osteoblasts was demonstrated by Alizarin red staining assay and ALP activity assay after rCYR61 treatment (Fig. 1, E and F). These results indicate that CYR61 induces osteogenic differentiation in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts and primary osteoblasts. Given the crucial role of BMPs in osteoblastic differentiation, we tested whether CYR61 mediated alteration of osteoblast proliferation and differentiation through regulation of BMP expression. According to Cheng et al. (43Cheng H. Jiang W. Phillips F.M. Haydon R.C. Peng Y. Zhou L. Luu H.H. An N. Breyer B. Vanichakarn P. Szatkowski J.P. Park J.Y. He T.C. J. Bone Joint Surg. Am. 2003; 85: 1544-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar), BMP-2, -6, and -9 may be the most potent molecules that induce osteoblast lineage-specific differentiation. Therefore, we explored possible target gene expression during rCYR61-induced osteoblastic differentiation. We examined expression levels"
https://openalex.org/W2001817590,"An analysis of short RNAs (with fewer than 200 nucleotides) from human cells using single molecule high-throughput sequencing has uncovered a previously unknown short RNA species with a difference. They all have the same 'tail' at their 5' ends, consisting of a sequence of non-genomically encoded polyU residues. This, together with the finding that these RNAs are closely associated with the 3' ends of known RNAs, points to the existence of a novel RNA-copying mechanism in human cells. In the course of characterizing short RNAs from human cells using single-molecule high-throughput sequencing, these authors identify a new short RNA species. The presence of non-genomically encoded poly(U) residues at their 5' ends implies the existence of an unknown RNA copying mechanism in human cells. Small (<200 nucleotide) RNA (sRNA) profiling of human cells using various technologies demonstrates unexpected complexity of sRNAs with hundreds of thousands of sRNA species present1,2,3,4. Genetic and in vitro studies show that these RNAs are not merely degradation products of longer transcripts but could indeed have a function1,2,5. Furthermore, profiling of RNAs, including the sRNAs, can reveal not only novel transcripts, but also make clear predictions about the existence and properties of novel biochemical pathways operating in a cell. For example, sRNA profiling in human cells indicated the existence of an unknown capping mechanism operating on cleaved RNA2, a biochemical component of which was later identified6. Here we show that human cells contain a novel type of sRNA that has non-genomically encoded 5′ poly(U) tails. The presence of these RNAs at the termini of genes, specifically at the very 3′ ends of known mRNAs, strongly argues for the presence of a yet uncharacterized endogenous biochemical pathway in cells that can copy RNA. We show that this pathway can operate on multiple genes, with specific enrichment towards transcript-encoding components of the translational machinery. Finally, we show that genes are also flanked by sense, 3′ polyadenylated sRNAs that are likely to be capped."

GTP hydrolysis following microtubule assembly induces protofilament curvature and disassembly. The conformation of the labile tubulin heterodimers is unknown. One important question is whether free GDP-tubulin dimers are straightened by GTP binding or if GTP-tubulin is also curved and switches into a straight conformation upon assembly. We have obtained insight into the bending flexibility of tubulin by analyzing the interplay of tubulin-stathmin association with the binding of several small molecule inhibitors to the colchicine domain at the tubulin intradimer interface, combining structural and biochemical approaches. The crystal structures of T2RB3 complexes with the chiral R and S isomers of ethyl-5-amino-2-methyl-1,2-dihydro-3-phenylpyrido[3,4-b]pyrazin-7-yl-carbamate, show that their binding site overlaps with colchicine ring A and that both complexes have the same curvature as unliganded T2RB3. The binding of these ligands is incompatible with a straight tubulin structure in microtubules. Analytical ultracentrifugation and binding measurements show that tubulin-stathmin associations (T2RB3, T2Stath) and binding of ligands (R, S, TN-16, or the colchicine analogue MTC) are thermodynamically independent from one another, irrespective of tubulin being bound to GTP or GDP. The fact that the interfacial ligands bind equally well to tubulin dimers or stathmin complexes supports a bent conformation of the free tubulin dimers. It is tempting to speculate that stathmin evolved to recognize curved structures in unassembled and disassembling tubulin, thus regulating microtubule assembly.

https://openalex.org/W2012260101,"The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily is one of the most diversified cell signaling pathways and regulates many physiological and pathological processes. Recently, neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) was reported to bind and activate the latent form of TGF-β1 (LAP-TGF-β1). We investigated the role of NRP-1 on Smad signaling in stromal fibroblasts upon TGF-β stimulation. Elimination of NRP-1 in stromal fibroblast cell lines increases Smad1/5 phosphorylation and downstream responses as evidenced by up-regulation of inhibitor of differentiation (Id-1). Conversely, NRP-1 loss decreases Smad2/3 phosphorylation and its responses as shown by down-regulation of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and also cells exhibit more quiescent phenotypes and growth arrest. Moreover, we also observed that NRP-1 expression is increased during the culture activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), a liver resident fibroblast. Taken together, our data suggest that NRP-1 functions as a key determinant of the diverse responses downstream of TGF-β1 that are mediated by distinct Smad proteins and promotes myofibroblast phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2067551740,"Apelin is the endogenous ligand of the orphan seven-transmembrane domain (TM) G protein-coupled receptor APJ. Apelin is involved in the regulation of body fluid homeostasis and cardiovascular functions. We previously showed the importance of the C-terminal Phe of apelin 17 (K17F) in the hypotensive activity of this peptide. Here, we show either by deleting the Phe residue (K16P) or by substituting it by an Ala (K17A), that it plays a crucial role in apelin receptor internalization but not in apelin binding or in Gα(i)-protein coupling. Then we built a homology three-dimensional model of the human apelin receptor using the cholecystokinin receptor-1 model as a template, and we subsequently docked K17F into the binding site. We visualized a hydrophobic cavity at the bottom of the binding pocket in which the C-terminal Phe of K17F was embedded by Trp(152) in TMIV and Trp(259) and Phe(255) in TMVI. Using molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis studies, we further showed that Phe(255) and Trp(259) are key residues in triggering receptor internalization without playing a role in apelin binding or in Gα(i)-protein coupling. These findings bring new insights into apelin receptor activation and show that Phe(255) and Trp(259), by interacting with the C-terminal Phe of the pyroglutamyl form of apelin 13 (pE13F) or K17F, are crucial for apelin receptor internalization."

https://openalex.org/W2093327413,"Opening of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator Cl(-) channel is dependent both on phosphorylation and on ATP binding and hydrolysis. However, the mechanisms by which these cytoplasmic regulatory factors open the Cl(-) channel pore are not known. We have used patch clamp recording to investigate the accessibility of cytoplasmically applied cysteine-reactive reagents to cysteines introduced along the length of the pore-lining sixth transmembrane region (TM6) of a cysteine-less variant of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. We find that methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents modify irreversibly cysteines substituted for TM6 residues Phe-337, Thr-338, Ser-341, Ile-344, Val-345, Met-348, Ala-349, Arg-352, and Gln-353 when applied to the cytoplasmic side of open channels. However, the apparent rate of modification by internal [2-sulfonatoethyl] methanethiosulfonate (MTSES), a negatively charged MTS reagent, is dependent on the activation state of the channels. In particular, cysteines introduced far along the axis of TM6 from the inside (T338C, S341C, I344C) showed no evidence of significant modification even after prolonged pretreatment of non-activated channels with internal MTSES. In contrast, cysteines introduced closer to the inside of TM6 (V345C, M348C) were readily modified in both activated and non-activated channels. Access of a permeant anion, Au(CN)(2)(-), to T338C was similarly dependent upon channel activation state. The pattern of MTS modification we observe allows us to designate different pore-lining amino acid side chains to distinct functional regions of the channel pore. One logical interpretation of these findings is that cytoplasmic access to residues at the narrowest region of the pore changes concomitant with activation."
https://openalex.org/W2059483202,"SET domain lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) methylate specific lysine residues in histone and non-histone substrates. These enzymes also display product specificity by catalyzing distinct degrees of methylation of the lysine ε-amino group. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying this specificity, we have characterized the Y245A and Y305F mutants of the human KMT SET7/9 (also known as KMT7) that alter its product specificity from a monomethyltransferase to a di- and a trimethyltransferase, respectively. Crystal structures of these mutants in complex with peptides bearing unmodified, mono-, di-, and trimethylated lysines illustrate the roles of active site water molecules in aligning the lysine ε-amino group for methyl transfer with S-adenosylmethionine. Displacement or dissociation of these solvent molecules enlarges the diameter of the active site, accommodating the increasing size of the methylated ε-amino group during successive methyl transfer reactions. Together, these results furnish new insights into the roles of active site water molecules in modulating lysine multiple methylation by SET domain KMTs and provide the first molecular snapshots of the mono-, di-, and trimethyl transfer reactions catalyzed by these enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2094849013,"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a cancer susceptibility syndrome characterized by sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. The FA proteins (FANCs) are implicated in DNA repair, although the precise mechanisms by which FANCs process DNA lesions are not fully understood. An epistatic relationship between the FA pathway and translesion synthesis (TLS, a post-replication DNA repair mechanism) has been suggested, but the basis for cross-talk between the FA and TLS pathways is poorly understood. We show here that ectopic overexpression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Rad18 (a central regulator of TLS) induces DNA damage-independent mono-ubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (a known Rad18 substrate) and FANCD2. Conversely, DNA damage-induced mono-ubiquitination of both PCNA and FANCD2 is attenuated in Rad18-deficient cells, demonstrating that Rad18 contributes to activation of the FA pathway. WT Rad18 but not an E3 ubiquitin ligase-deficient Rad18 C28F mutant fully complements both PCNA ubiquitination and FANCD2 activation in Rad18-depleted cells. Rad18-induced mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2 is not observed in FA core complex-deficient cells, demonstrating that Rad18 E3 ligase activity alone is insufficient for FANCD2 ubiquitylation. Instead, Rad18 promotes FA core complex-dependent FANCD2 ubiquitination in a manner that is secondary to PCNA mono-ubiquitination.

Taken together, these results demonstrate a novel Rad18-dependent mechanism that couples activation of the FA pathway with TLS. Genomes are continuously exposed to endogenous and exogenous DNA-damaging agents, and appropriate coordination of DNA replication and repair mechanisms is necessary to prevent genetic instability and cancer (1Kastan M.B. Bartek J. Nature. 2004; 432: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2208) Google Scholar, 2Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar). Cells have evolved various systems to sense and repair different types of damaged DNA throughout the cell cycle. During S-phase, DNA lesions that escape repair may persist and cause stalling and collapse of DNA replication forks, a potential cause of DNA double strand breaks. Translesion synthesis (TLS) 3The abbreviations used are: TLStranslesion synthesisFAFanconi anemiaPCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenpolpolymeraseMMCmitomycin CTEVtobacco etch virusssDNAsingle strand DNAICLinterstrand cross-linkBPDEbenzo[a]pyrene dihydrodiol epoxide. is a DNA damage tolerance mechanism that allows cells to avoid detrimental consequences of persistent replication stalling (3Prakash S. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 317-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). TLS involves a “polymerase switch” that replaces replicative DNA polymerases with specialized TLS DNA polymerases at stalled replication forks (3Prakash S. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 317-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 4Kannouche P.L. Lehmann A.R. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 1011-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 5Kannouche P.L. Wing J. Lehmann A.R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the four main Y-family TLS polymerases are DNA pol η, pol κ, pol ι, and REV1 (6Ohmori H. Friedberg E.C. Fuchs R.P. Goodman M.F. Hanaoka F. Hinkle D. Kunkel T.A. Lawrence C.W.

Collectively, the Y-family TLS polymerases facilitate replicative bypass of various helix-distorting lesions such as bulky adducts, allowing continued fork progression in cells with DNA damage. However, because of the relatively low fidelity and processivity of TLS DNA polymerases, the ensuing lesion bypass is often error-prone and preserves replication forks at the cost of mutagenesis (3Prakash S.

The polymerase switching process is dependent on an E3 ubiquitin ligase termed “Rad18.” In response to replication fork stalling, Rad18 mono-ubiquitinates PCNA at Lys-164 (4Kannouche P.L.

Cell. 2004; 14: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). All Y-family TLS polymerases have specialized ubiquitin-binding motifs (designated “UBM” and “UBZ” domains) that mediate their associations with mono-ubiquitinated PCNA (7Bienko M. Green C.M. Crosetto N. Rudolf F. Zapart G. Coull B. Kannouche P. Wider G. Peter M. Lehmann A.R. Hofmann K. Dikic I. Science. 2005; 310: 1821-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Rad18 also contributes to TLS via its direct associations with pol η which help guide the TLS polymerase to stalled replication forks (8Watanabe K. Tateishi S. Kawasuji M. Tsurimoto T. Inoue H. Yamaizumi M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3886-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Of the four Y-family TLS polymerases, pol η is the first to be recruited to most DNA lesions, in part because of Rad18-mediated chaperone activity. We and others have previously shown that Rad18 and TLS polymerases are important for recovery from replication arrest and timely attenuation of S-phase checkpoint signaling in genotoxin-treated cells (9Bi X. Slater D.M. Ohmori H. Vaziri C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22343-22355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 10Bi X. Barkley L.R. Slater D.M. Tateishi S. Yamaizumi M.

Cell. 2008; 32: 757-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Similar to TLS, the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway is implicated in processing and repairing DNA damage acquired during S-phase (12Huang T.T. D'Andrea A.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 13Moldovan G.L. D'Andrea A.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009; 43: 223-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). FA is a rare chromosome instability syndrome associated with increased cancer susceptibility. Gross chromosomal rearrangements following exposure to DNA cross-linking agents, such as mitomycin C (MMC), diepoxybutane, and cisplatin, is a well known characteristic of cells derived from FA patients. At least 13 FA complementation groups (A–C, D1, D2, E–G, I, J, and L–N) have been identified. The FA proteins (FANCs) encoded by the various complementation groups are thought to function in a common biochemical pathway of DNA repair. The FA core complex includes protein products of genes belonging to at least eight FA complementation groups (A–C, E–G, L, and M) and acts as an E3 ligase to mono-ubiquitinate FANCD2 and FANCI in response to DNA damage and replication stress during S-phase. The mono-ubiquitinated FANCD2-I complex, the putative effector of the FA pathway, is then recruited to chromatin, and it is thought to direct DNA repair (13Moldovan G.L. D'Andrea A.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009; 43: 223-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The FA pathway has been implicated in nuclear excision repair, homologous recombination, non-homologous end joining, and TLS. A potential link between the FA and TLS pathways was suggested based on the hypomutability of FA patient cell lines after acquisition of psoralen photo-induced lesions (14Papadopoulo D. Guillouf C. Mohrenweiser H. Moustacchi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 8383-8387Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 15Papadopoulo D. Guillouf C. Porfirio B. Moustacchi E. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1990; 340A: 241-248PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the FA pathway facilitates an error-prone repair process. Moreover, Niedzwiedz et al. (16Niedzwiedz W. Mosedale G. Johnson M. Ong C.Y. Pace P. Patel K.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 607-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) demonstrated that DT40 cells deficient in REV1 and REV3 display cross-linker sensitivity phenotypes that are epistatic to FANCC. Also, pol ζ is necessary for FANCD2-FANCI-mediated ICL repair in cell-free Xenopus extracts (17Räschle M. Knipscheer P. Knipsheer P. Enoiu M. Angelov T. Sun J. Griffith J.D. Ellenberger T.E.

The finding that a common de-ubiquitinating enzyme (USP1) regulates the mono-ubiquitination of both PCNA and FANCD2 (18Nijman S.M. Huang T.T. Dirac A.M. Brummelkamp T.R. Kerkhoven R.M. D'Andrea A.D.

Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) and that Rad6 (an E2 ligase for Rad18 in TLS) status affects FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination (20Zhang J. Zhao D. Wang H. Lin C.J. Fei P. Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) also suggest that the coordination of the FA pathway and TLS might be important for the DNA damage response. REV1 focus formation is partially dependent on the FA core complex in human cells, and FA patient-derived core complex mutants show reduced mutagenesis (14Papadopoulo D. Guillouf C. Mohrenweiser H. Moustacchi E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 8383-8387Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 15Papadopoulo D. Guillouf C. Porfirio B. Moustacchi E. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1990; 340A: 241-248PubMed Google Scholar, 21Mirchandani K.D. McCaffrey R.M. D'Andrea A.D. DNA Repair. 2008; 7: 902-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, FANCD2-deficient cells are hypermutable compared with wild type cells (in the absence or presence of UVC damage) (21Mirchandani K.D. McCaffrey R.M. D'Andrea A.D. DNA Repair. 2008; 7: 902-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), suggesting that the FA pathway might be forked, with the FANCD2-I ubiquitination branch responsible for homologous recombination control and the core complex-dependent branch controlling TLS via REV1 (22Moldovan G.L. D'Andrea A.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009; 43: 223-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Thus, although there is considerable evidence that the FA and TLS pathways are linked, the molecular mechanisms that coordinate the FA and TLS pathways are incompletely understood. Furthermore, it is not known whether the FANCs are necessarily regulated distally or proximally to the TLS pathway or whether bidirectional communication takes place between FANCs and TLS proteins. Because a common de-ubiquitinating enzyme (USP1) negatively regulates both the TLS and FA pathways (via de-ubiquitination of PCNA and FANCD2, respectively), we considered the possibility that Rad18 might be responsible for coordinate activation of the two repair pathways. Our results described here indicate that FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination is Rad18-dependent. However, we do not find evidence that FANCD2 is a direct substrate of Rad18. Instead, our results indicate that the FA pathway is activated in a manner that is coupled to PCNA ubiquitination and TLS polymerase recruitment. H1299 cells, HCT116 WT RAD18+/+, and RAD18−/− cells were obtained from Dr. Tadahiro Shiomi, Kumamoto University, Japan (23Shiomi N. Mori M. Tsuji H. Imai T. Inoue H. Tateishi S. Yamaizumi M. Shiomi T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: e9Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). CRL1162 cells derived from pol η-deficient XPV patients and CRL1162 + XPV cells stably expressing reconstituted WT POLH cDNA were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml). FANCD2-deficient PD20 cells, FANCA-deficient GM6914, and isogenic cell lines stably expressing reconstituted wild type FANCs (obtained from Dr. Alan D'Andrea, Dana Farber Cancer Institute) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml). Sf9 insect cells (derived from Spodoptera frugiperda ovarian cells) were cultured in Sf-900TM III SFM (Invitrogen). The following siRNA oligonucleotides (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) were used for the experiments in this study: pol η, 5′-GCA GAA AGG CAG AAA GUU A-3′; Rad18, On-Target plus SMART POOL (L-004591, Dharmacon); UBE2T, 5′-GAA GAG AGA GCT GCA CAT GTT-3′; and nontargeting control siRNA oligonucleotides (D-001210-01, Dharmacon). Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used for transfection of all the siRNA oligonucleotides, following the manufacturer's protocol. All tubes, tips, and solutions used for RNA interference experiments were certified RNase-free. Total cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, supplemented with protease inhibitor and phos-stop (Roche Applied Science). In some experiments, cells were fractionated to generate soluble fractions and whole nuclei, exactly as described by Izumi et al. (24Izumi M. Yanagi K. Mizuno T. Yokoi M. Kawasaki Y. Moon K.Y. Hurwitz J. Yatagai F. Hanaoka F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4769-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In brief, monolayers of cells were washed two times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and scraped into 500 μl of ice-cold cytoskeleton buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8), 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm ATP, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, and 0.1% Triton X-100) freshly supplemented with protease inhibitor and phos-stop (Roche Applied Science). Cytoskeleton lysates were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and incubated on ice for 5 min. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 2 min. The supernatants were removed and further clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min to obtain Triton X-100-soluble fractions. The Triton X-100-extracted insoluble nuclear fractions were washed once with 1 ml of cytoskeleton buffer and then resuspended in a minimal volume of cytoskeleton buffer. Soluble or nuclear protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies. Bound antibodies were visualized using ECL. Films were scanned and analyzed by densitometry using ImageJ software to compare relative expression levels of various proteins. H1299 or HCT116 cells exponentially growing in two-well chamber slides were infected with Ad-Rad18 for 48 h. The resulting slides were further treated with BPDE or UV genotoxins or left untreated. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with cold CSK buffer on ice for 10 min. Cell nuclei were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in CSK for 15 min at room temperature and washed with PBS. After washing with PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Slides were washed again with PBS, and cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-FANCD2 antibodies (sc-20022, mouse) in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBST). The slides were washed three times with 1% BSA/PBST and incubated with anti-mouse IgG-FITC antibodies or anti-mouse IgG-Cy3 antibodies (C2181, Sigma) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with PBST, the slides were DAPI-stained, mounted with VECTASHIELD® Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories), imaged, and analyzed with a DeltaVision image restoration microscopy system (dv1301421; Applied Precision). BPDE (NCI Carcinogen Repository, National Institutes of Health) was dissolved in anhydrous Me2SO and added directly to the growth medium as a 1000× stock to give final concentrations of 100, 200, 300, or 500 nm. MMC was dissolved in 50% ethanol added directly to the growth medium as a 1000× stock to give a final concentration of 300 nm. For UVC treatment, the growth medium was removed from the cells and replaced with PBS. The plates were transferred to a UV cross-linker (Stratagene) and then irradiated. The UVC dose delivered to the cells was confirmed with a UV radiometer (UVP, Inc.). The cells were then re-fed with complete growth medium and returned to the incubator. All adenovirus vectors were constructed and purified as described previously (9Bi X. Slater D.M. Ohmori H. Vaziri C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22343-22355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 10Bi X. Barkley L.R. Slater D.M. Tateishi S. Yamaizumi M. Ohmori H. Vaziri C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3527-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Briefly, various cDNAs were subcloned into pAC-CMV. The resulting shuttle vectors were co-transfected into 293T cells with the pJM17 plasmid to generate recombinant adenovirus, and adenovirus particles were purified from 293T cell lysates by polyethylene glycol precipitation, CsCl gradient centrifugation, and gel filtration column chromatography. Adenovirus infections were performed by direct addition of purified virus to the tissue culture medium. Expression of adenovirus-encoded proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting. Cells were routinely infected with 5 × 109 plaque-forming units/ml of adenovirus. Recombinant full-length wild type FANCD2 was purified using recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells as described by Park et al. (25Park W.H. Margossian S. Horwitz A.A. Simons A.M. D'Andrea A.D. Parvin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23593-23598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, Sf9 cells were infected with baculovirus encoding zz-tagged FANCD2 (obtained from Dr. Jeffery Parvin, Ohio State University) for 4 days. The infected cells were harvested and washed in chilled phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed in 15 ml of buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 200 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, supplemented with Complete-mini (Roche Applied Science)). The pre-equilibrated 250 μl of IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added into the protein lysate and incubated with mixing at 4 °C for 16 h. The resulting protein-IgG-Sepharose complexes were washed twice with buffer B and twice with buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 200 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), four times with TEV cleavage buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), and then resuspended in 300 μl of TEV cleavage buffer plus 18 μg of TEV enzyme (Invitrogen). Beads containing the bound fusion protein were incubated with the TEV protease at 4 °C for 16 h. The supernatant containing FANCD2 protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue to estimate protein concentration, and used for in vitro ubiquitination assay. As an alternative source of FANCD2 protein for in vitro ubiquitination assay, FANCD2 was immunoprecipitated from PD20 + FLAG-FANCD2 reconstituted cells. Cells were lysed and fractionated using CSK buffer as described above, and the soluble fraction of the cell lysates was used for immunoprecipitation to enrich nonubiquitinated FANCD2 protein. Anti-FLAG M2 Affinity gel (Sigma) was incubated with the soluble cell lysate at 4 °C for 16 h, washed five times with wash buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20), and eluted with 5 volumes of 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). In vitro ubiquitination assays were performed as described by Tateishi and co-workers (8Watanabe K. Tateishi S. Kawasuji M. Tsurimoto T. Inoue H. Yamaizumi M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3886-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) using recombinant PCNA recombinant protein as a positive control for the Rad6-Rad18-mediated ubiquitination. Briefly, purified recombinant FANCD2 or PCNA proteins were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C with RAD6B-RAD18 complexes (26Tsuji Y. Watanabe K. Araki K. Shinohara M. Yamagata Y. Tsurimoto T. Hanaoka F. Yamamura K. Yamaizumi M. Tateishi S.

The reaction mixtures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-FANCD2 or anti-PCNA antibodies. All data shown are representative of experiments that were performed at least three times on separate occasions with similar results. We have previously shown a key role for Rad18 and TLS polymerases in mediating attenuation of S-phase checkpoint signaling elicited by BPDE lesions (9Bi X. Slater D.M. Ohmori H. Vaziri C. J. Biol.

H1299 cells were treated with 100 nm BPDE for 2 h to induce DNA damage, and the cell lysates were analyzed for FANCD2 and other DNA replication and S-phase checkpoint proteins. As expected, BPDE induced Chk1 phosphorylation at Ser-317 and decreased chromatin loading of Cdc45 (Fig. 1A), demonstrating activation of S-phase checkpoint signaling. BPDE also induced mono-ubiquitination of PCNA and FANCD2 under these experimental conditions (Fig. 1A, left panels). In response to genotoxins or during S-phase, FANCD2 redistributes to distinct nuclear foci likely corresponding to DNA replication and repair factories (28Taniguchi T. Garcia-Higuera I.

We tested the effect of BPDE on FANCD2 subcellular distribution by immunofluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 1B, BPDE treatment increased the number of FANCD2 nuclear foci by 5.5-fold (p = 0.00015). FANCD2 foci were partially co-localized with pol κ (Fig. 1C), the TLS polymerase involved in bypass of BPDE-induced DNA lesions (9Bi X. Slater D.M. Ohmori H. Vaziri C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22343-22355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 10Bi X. Barkley L.R. Slater D.M. Tateishi S. Yamaizumi M. Ohmori H. Vaziri C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3527-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Therefore, BPDE induces concomitant activation of checkpoint signaling, Rad18-dependent TLS, and FANCD2 ubiquitination. TLS deficiency delays the recovery from S-phase checkpoints, most likely due to impaired processing and resolution of stalled fork structures when post-replication repair is compromised (9Bi X. Slater D.M. Ohmori H. Vaziri C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22343-22355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 10Bi X. Barkley L.R. Slater D.M. Tateishi S. Yamaizumi M. Ohmori H. Vaziri C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3527-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Given the suspected relationship between the FA pathway and TLS, it was of interest to determine the potential requirement for FANCD2 in mediating recovery from BPDE-induced S-phase arrest. Therefore, we measured rates of DNA synthesis at different times after BPDE treatment in control and FANCD2-depleted H1299 cells. As shown in Fig. 1D, resumption of DNA synthesis following BPDE treatment was delayed in FANCD2-depleted H1299 cells relative to controls. We also compared rates of DNA synthesis after BPDE treatment in FANCD2(−) PD20 FA patient cells and an isogenic FLAG-FANCD2-complemented cell line (designated FANCD2(+)). Qualitatively similar to the results of experiments with FANCD2-depleted H1299 cells, resumption of DNA synthesis following BPDE-induced S-phase arrest was delayed in the FANCD2(−) cell line relative to FANCD2(+) cells (Fig. 1E). As expected, recovery from S-phase arrest following treatment with the intra-strand cross-linking agent (cis-platinum, cisplatin) was also compromised in FANCD2(−) cells relative to FANCD2(+) controls (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, consistent with a role for FANCD2 in tolerance of BPDE-induced DNA damage, FANCD2(−) cells showed modest sensitivity to BPDE in cell survival assays (Fig. 1F). Other workers have also reported mild UV sensitivity of FA cell lines (30Tebbs R.S. Hinz J.M. Yamada N.A. Wilson J.B. Salazar E.P. Thomas C.B. Jones I.M. Jones N.J. Thompson L.H. DNA Repair. 2005; 4: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), further indicating a role for FANCs in tolerance of bulky DNA lesions. Taken together, our results show that the FA pathway participates in cellular responses to bulky DNA adducts such as BPDE-induced lesions. Because FANCD2 associated with chromatin in response to BPDE (Fig. 1), and because FANCD2 deficiency recapitulated the S-phase recovery and survival defects of TLS-deficient cells (9Bi X. Slater D.M. Ohmori H. Vaziri C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22343-22355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 10Bi X. Barkley L.R. Slater D.M. Tateishi S. Yamaizumi M. Ohmori H. Vaziri C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3527-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that TLS and FANC proteins function in a common pathway that confers tolerance of bulky adducts. Therefore, we first tested the possibility that FANCD2 ubiquitination is downstream of Rad18. We have previously shown that BPDE-induced PCNA mono-ubiquitination is Rad18-dependent and that overexpressed Rad18 induces DNA damage-independent PCNA ubiquitination (10Bi X. Barkley L.R. Slater D.M. Tateishi S. Yamaizumi M. Ohmori H. Vaziri C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3527-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, Rad18 overexpression in H1299 cells also induced a distinct FANCD2 electrophoretic mobility shift (the hallmark of FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination), even in the absence of DNA damage. Therefore, Rad18 is a potential upstream regulator of the FA pathway. To test whether endogenous Rad18 contributes to FA pathway activation, we determined the effect of depleting endogenous Rad18 on genotoxin-inducible association of mono-ubiquitinated FANCD2 with chromatin. As expected, genotoxin treatments (BPDE or MMC) induced robust mono-ubiquitination of chromatin-associated PCNA and increased the chromatin association of FANCD2 in control (siCon) transfected cells (Fig. 2B, 2nd and 3rd lanes). Interestingly, both PCNA mono-ubiquitination and FANCD2 chromatin binding were reduced in Rad18-depleted H1299 cells (Fig. 2B, 6th and 7th lanes). The protein levels of soluble (nonubiquitinated) FANCD2 were unaffected by Rad18 status. To complement our"

Collagen-like proteins have been identified in a number of bacterial species. Here, we used Scl2 from Streptococcus pyogenes serotype M28 strain MGAS6274 as a backbone for the introduction of discrete integrin-binding sequences. The introduced sequences GLPGER, GFPGER, or GFPGEN did not affect triple helix stability of the Scl (Streptococcal collagen-like) protein. Using ELISA and surface plasmon resonance, we determined that Scl2(GLPGER) and Scl2(GFPGER) bound to recombinant human α1 and α2 I-domains in a metal ion-dependent manner and without a requirement for hydroxyproline. We predicted a novel and selective integrin-binding sequence, GFPGEN, through the use of computer modeling and demonstrated that Scl2(GFPGEN) shows specificity toward the α1 I-domain and does not bind the α2 I-domain. Using C2C12 cells, we determined that intact integrins interact with the modified Scl2 proteins with the same selectivity as recombinant I-domains. These modified Scl2 proteins also acted as cell attachment substrates for fibroblast, endothelial, and smooth muscle cells. However, the modified Scl2 proteins were unable to aggregate platelets. These results indicate that Scl2 is a suitable backbone for the introduction of mammalian integrin-binding sequences, and these sequences may be manipulated to individually target α1β1 and α2β1."

ZMYND15 represents the first transcriptional repressor identified to be essential for sperm production and male fertility. Spermatogenesis is a process of cellular multiplication and differentiation through which male germ cells develop from spermatogonial stem cells to spermatozoa with highly specified functions (1Fawcett D.W. Dev. Biol. 1975; 44: 394-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 2Oakberg E.F. Am. J. Anat. 1956; 99: 391-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Spermatogenesis can be divided into three phases: the mitotic phase (proliferation and differentiation of spermatogonia), the meiotic phase (differentiation of spermatocytes), and spermiogenesis (differentiation of haploid germ cells from round spermatids to elongated spermatids and spermatozoa) (1Fawcett D.W. Dev. Biol. 1975; 44: 394-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 2Oakberg E.F. Am. J. Anat. 1956; 99: 391-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Within the seminiferous tubules, the developing male germ cells including spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and spermatids are all in close contact with the cytoplasm of supporting Sertoli cells, and these spermatogenic cells form specific cellular associations, which have been termed stages (3Ahmed E.A. de Rooij D.G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 558: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). For example, at stage VII, type A1 spermatogonia, preleptotene spermatocytes, step 7 round spermatids, and step 16 elongated spermatids are associated with each other, whereas type A3 spermatogonia, zygotene spermatocytes, meiotically dividing spermatocytes, and elongating step 12 spermatids are grouped together. Twelve stages (stages I–XII) can be identified in the mouse seminiferous tubules (3Ahmed E.A. de Rooij D.G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 558: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Meiosis is unique to germ cells, and spermiogenesis is unique to male germ cell development. Unique processes often require unique genes and gene products to execute the functions. This may explain why ∼10% of the entire protein-encoding genes are dedicated to the regulation of spermatogenesis, and spermiogenesis alone involves at least 500 testis-specific genes (4Lin Y.N. Matzuk M.M. Semin. Reprod. Med. 2005; 23: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 5Schultz N. Hamra F.K. Garbers D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Reprod. 2004; 71: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Another unique feature in the control of gene expression during spermiogenesis is the uncoupling of transcription and translation (7Eddy E.M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 8Eddy E.M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2002; 57: 103-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 9Hecht N.B. Prog. Clin. Biol.

Science. 2002; 296: 2176-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), which results from the fact that genes required for late spermiogenesis (step 9–16 spermatids in mice) have to be transcribed in round spermatids (steps 1–8) because transcription ceases when nuclear elongation and condensation start at step 9 of spermatid development in mice. Therefore, the most active transcription occurs at a time window between the late pachytene spermatocyte and round spermatid stages during spermatogenesis. The transcripts are then stabilized and stored until they are translated in later steps where their encoded proteins are needed (8Eddy E.M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2002; 57: 103-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 9Hecht N.B. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1988; 267: 291-313PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sassone-Corsi P.

Transcription factors are critical regulators of gene expression and serve as switches that control the normal spatiotemporal expression of gene sets during specific cellular processes (12Sassone-Corsi P. Science. 2002; 296: 2176-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Given that so many testis-specific genes are involved in sperm production, the regulation of gene expression in spermatogenesis by testis-specific transcription factors is a foreseeable mechanism. Efforts in gene discovery in conjunction with gene knock-out technology over the past 15 years have identified a number of transcription factors that are preferentially or exclusively expressed in the testis and are required for different phases of male germ cell development (13Maclean 2nd, J.A.

CREM-tau is essential for post-meiotic germ cell development, and a lack of this transcription factor leads to the arrest in the first step of spermiogenesis (21Blendy J.A. Kaestner K.H. Weinbauer G.F. Nieschlag E. Schütz G. Nature. 1996; 380: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). CREM-tau acts as a main switch for genes required for haploid germ cell development, including Prm1, Prm2, Tnp1, and Tnp2 (21Blendy J.A. Kaestner K.H. Weinbauer G.F. Nieschlag E. Schütz G.

Nature. 1996; 380: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). TBPL1 (TATA box-binding protein-like 1) is also required for spermiogenesis, and inactivation of Tbpl1 results in a complete arrest of spermiogenesis at step 7 (23Martianov I. Fimia G.M. Dierich A. Parvinen M. Sassone-Corsi P. Davidson I. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 509-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Many genes that are under the control of TBPl1 fail to be expressed in the Tbpl1-null mice. In the present study, we report that Zmynd15 encodes a MYND-containing zinc-binding protein that is exclusively expressed in haploid germ cells during spermatogenesis. ZMYND15 acts as a transcription repressor through the recruitment of histone deacetylase enzymes (HDACs). 3The abbreviations used are: HDAChistone deacetylase enzymeUTRuntranslated regionqPCRquantitative PCRMes4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidPnpostnatal day n. Inactivation of Zmynd15 in mice results in late spermiogenic disruption, causing azoospermia and complete male infertility. histone deacetylase enzyme untranslated region quantitative PCR 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid postnatal day n. We previously generated Cxcl16−/− mice in which the entire coding region and part of the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of Cxcl16 were deleted (24Aslanian A.M. Charo I.F. Circulation. 2006; 114: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We later discovered that Zmynd15 and Cxcl16 genes overlap in their 5′-UTRs (see Fig. 1A), and the deletion of the Cxcl16 5′-UTR in fact also inactivated Zmynd15 (see Fig. 1B). The Cxcl16-null mice are actually Cxcl16-Zmynd15 double knock-out mice (see “Results”). Because the testicular phenotype is caused by Zmynd15 deficiency (see “Results” and “Discussion”), we henceforth call these mice Zmynd15−/− mice. Whole testes were dissected and weighed. Spermatozoa were collected from caudal epididymides and incubated in 2 ml of PBS prewarmed to 37 °C. Sperm counts were performed using a hemocytometer (Hausser Scientific, Horsham, PA). Keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide corresponding to amino acids 176–190 of murine ZMYND15 (PREDERAPEKRKGQKN) was synthesized and used for immunization of rabbits (Invitrogen). ELISA was used to quantify anti-ZMYND15 titers in serum, and the IgG fraction was then purified by chromatography on protein A columns (Pierce), following the manufacturer's protocol. Wild-type and Zmynd15−/− testis were collected, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and processed for sectioning. For histology the sections were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated by standard procedures, and stained with the Periodic acid-Schiff solution followed by hematoxylin counterstaining (25Lähdetie J. Mutat. Res. 1986; 172: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry was performed as described (26Zheng H. Stratton C.J. Morozumi K. Jin J. Yanagimachi R. Yan W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 6852-6857Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and anti-ZMYND15 antibodies were diluted at 1:600. Whole testes were homogenized in TRIzol (Invitrogen), and total RNA was isolated following manufacturer's instructions. RNA samples were further purified using RNeasy mini columns (Qiagen) and then incubated with DNase (DNAfree, Ambion, Houston, TX) to eliminate potential genomic DNA contamination. For qPCR analyses, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed in a 20-μl reaction with SuperScript III Platinum Two-Step qRT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). The cDNA samples were diluted 10-fold, and 5 μl was added to a 50-μl PCR. To quantify Zmynd15 expression, 2.5 μl of 20× predetermined TaqMan primer/probe sets from Applied Biosytems were used. The samples underwent the following protocol: stage 1, 50 °C for 2 min; stage 2, 95 °C for 10 min; and stage 3, 95 °C for 15 s, and followed by 60 °C for 1 min. Stage 3 was repeated 40 times. The relative expression levels were calculated by the comparative Ct method as outlined in the manufacturer's technical bulletin. Measured RNA levels were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Semi-qPCR analyses were performed as described (27Jin J.L. O'Doherty A.M. Wang S. Zheng H. Sanders K.M. Yan W. Biol. Reprod. 2005; Google Scholar). The cycle numbers were tested empirically to assure that the PCRs were within the exponential range. The primers and PCR conditions used in this study are listed in the supplemental Table S1. In situ hybridization was performed as described (28Wu M.H. Rajkovic A. Burns K.H. Yan W. Lin Y.N.

A PCR-generated cDNA fragment (505 bp) corresponding to nucleotides 1–505 of the full-length Zmynd15 cDNA was subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Sense and antisense riboprobes were generated and labeled with [α-35S]UTP with a riboprobe labeling system (Promega, Madison, WI). Hybridization signals were detected by autoradiography with an NTB-2 emulsion (Eastman Kodak Co.). After development and fixation, the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted for photography. We performed TUNEL assays on paraformaldehyde-fixed paraffin sections using an ApoTag Plus peroxidase kit (Intergen, Purchase, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10t1/2 cells were grown to 75–80% confluency in three six-well plates. All of the cells were transfected with 1 mg of total DNA and FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and with 200 ng of SV40-luc and 200 ng of CMV-lacZ. One six-well plate was transfected with 600 ng of Gal4-DBD, another plate with 300 ng of Gal4-DBD and 300 ng of Gal4-Zmynd15, and a final plate with 600 ng of Gal4-Zmynd15. After 24 h, half of each plate was treated with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (Calbiochem, Gibbstown, NJ), and the other half of each plate was treated with dimethyl sulfoxide. After another 24 h, the cells were washed with 1× PBS, and the cell lysates were harvested with 250 ml of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured in 50 ml of sample lysates with a luciferase assay system (Promega). Transfection efficiency was normalized to β-galactosidase, which was measured in 50 ml of sample lysate by a β-galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega). The experiments were performed in three replicates, and statistic significance was evaluated using the Student's t test (Sigma Stat). Constructs for expressing FLAG-tagged histone deacetylases 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7 and SIRT1 were prepared as described previously (30Emiliani S. Fischle W. Van Lint C. Al-Abed Y. Verdin E. Proc. Natl.

A total of 20 μg of DNA (10 μg of pCDNA HDAC C-terminal FLAG tag + 10 μg of ZMYND15 HA tag) was brought up to 876 μl in H2O. 124 μl of 2 m CaCl2 was added to the DNA, 1 ml of 2× HEPES-buffered saline (0.01 m HEPES, 0.14 m NaCl, 0.01% NaN3), pH 7.05, was bubbled in for 10 s, and then the mixture was applied to the cells. 48 h after transfection the cells were washed with 1× PBS and lysed directly in the 100 mm plate in 333 μl of cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1× complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h and then diluted with 666 μl of lysis buffer with no NaCl to get a final concentration of 150 mm NaCl. The cell lysates were cleared by centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g, and 0.01% of the lysate was analyzed to check for expression of transfected proteins. 40 μl of prewashed M2 agarose beads (catalog number A2220; Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the lysates to immunoprecipitate the FLAG-tagged HDACs, and the lysates were rotated at 4 °C for 2–16 h. The beads were collected by centrifugation for 30 s at 5,000 × g, and the supernatants were removed by aspiration. The pellets were washed five times with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer. 75 μl of 2× sample buffer was added to the M2 agarose beads, the samples were boiled for 3 min, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using anti-ZYMND15 antibody and a rabbit anti-FLAG antibody (catalog number F7425; Sigma). Total RNAs were isolated from Zmynd15−/− and wild-type testes at P20. Duplicates for each genotype were subjected to microarray analyses. Affymetrix mouse genome 430A 2.0 microarrays (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA) were hybridized at the Nevada Genomic Center. In brief, 5 μg of total RNA was converted to first strand cDNA by using Superscript II reverse transcriptase primed by a poly(T) oligomer that incorporated the T7 promoter. Second strand cDNA synthesis was followed by in vitro transcription for linear amplification of each transcript and incorporation of biotinylated CTP and UTP. The cRNA products were fragmented to 200 nucleotides or less, heated at 99 °C for 5 min, and hybridized for 16 h at 45 °C to MOE430A microarrays. The microarrays were then washed at low (6× 0.18 m NaCl, 10 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) and high (100 mm Mes, 0.1 m NaCl) stringency and stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin. Fluorescence was amplified by adding biotinylated anti-streptavidin and an additional aliquot of streptavidin-phycoerythrin stain. A confocal scanner was used to collect fluorescence signal at 3-μm resolution after excitation at 570 nm. Affymetrix gcos 1.2 software was used to analyze and quantify the hybridized arrays. The Affymetrix mas5 algorithm (with default settings, as encoded in gcos 1.2) was used to generate signal values and to determine present/absent/marginal flags for each probe set on each array. Probe sets flagged by mas5 as present are described as detected. Analysis was performed using Bioconductor, a publicly available group of software packages as described (34Chen H. Ordög T. Chen J. Young D.L. Bardsley M.R. Redelman D. Ward S.M. Sanders K.M. Physiol. Genomics. 2007; 31: 492-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, the packages used included Simpleaffy, Limma, Annaffy, and GOstats. Simpleaffy was used to preprocess individual probe intensities from CEL files into expression values from which fold changes were derived using Limma. Robust multiple-array analysis, which uses quantile normalization for cross-chip normalization, was used to preprocess the data. The main advantage of quantile normalization is that it controls outliers while not significantly reducing sensitivity. The significance of differential expression was determined using an empirical Bayes approach (Limma) for controlling the standard error of intensity of each probe set based on the standard errors of the intensities of all other probe sets in the comparison. After p values were obtained for each gene, they were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg method (34Chen H. Ordög T. Chen J. Young D.L. Bardsley M.R. Redelman D. Ward S.M. Sanders K.M. Physiol. Genomics. 2007; 31: 492-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This method converts p values, which are measures of the false positive rate, into Q values, which are measures of false discovery rate. The Benjamini-Hochberg method allows a more direct control of false results while not reducing sensitivity as much as other methods for p value adjustment. Annaffy was used to annotate each gene probe set and to tabulate information such as GenBankTM accession numbers, chromosome locations, and gene ontology terms. In our earlier studies designed to investigate the role of scavenger receptors in cardiovascular diseases, we generated Cxcl16 knock-out mice by deleting the 5′-UTR and the entire coding region of Cxcl16 using homologous recombination in murine embryonic stem cells (24Aslanian A.M. Charo I.F. Circulation. 2006; 114: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that all Cxcl16−/− males were infertile. We expected no fertility problems in Cxcl16-null male mice because levels of Cxcl16 mRNA in the testis were very low compared with other organs (e.g. heart and kidney), and mRNA for CXCR6, the only known receptor for CXCL16, was not detected in the testis. Furthermore, male and female Cxcr6−/− mice are completely fertile (35Unutmaz D. Xiang W. Sunshine M.J. Campbell J. Butcher E. Littman D.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3284-3292Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). By re-examining the targeting site flanking Cxcl16, we found that in fact Cxcl16 and Zmynd15 are adjacent to each other on chromosome 11 and possess overlapping 5′-UTRs (Fig. 1A). Our targeting vector deleted all of the Cxcl16 coding exons and most of the 5′-UTR, which is shared by Zmynd15. It was thus highly likely that the Cxcl16 targeting vector also inadvertently disrupted the Zmynd15 promoter. Our qPCR analyses on levels of Cxcl16 and Zmynd15 mRNAs in wild-type and Cxcl16−/− testes confirmed that in our previously thought Cxcl16-null testes, both Cxcl16 and Zmynd15 were totally inactivated (Fig. 1B). In addition, in WT testes levels of Zmynd15, mRNAs were ∼10 times greater than those of Cxcl16. We examined the expression of Zmynd15 in 12 adult mouse organs and also in developing testes using RT-PCR (Fig. 2). Unlike Cxcl16, which was expressed in a ubiquitous manner, Zmynd15 was exclusively detected in the testis (Fig. 2A). We also searched the Genehub-GEPIS database (36Zhang Y. Eberhard D.A. Frantz G.D. Dowd P. Wu T.D. Zhou Y. Watanabe C. Luoh S.M. Polakis P. Hillan K.J. Wood W.I. Zhang Z. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 2390-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 37Zhang Y. Luoh S.M. Hon L.S. Baertsch R. Wood W.I. Zhang Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: W152-W158Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) for Zmynd15 and found that expressed sequence tags for human ZMYND15 were exclusively derived from the testis. In developing testes, Cxcl16 was detected in all ages with comparable levels (Fig. 2B). In contrast, Zmynd15 was first detected on postnatal day 17 (P17), and its levels increase at P21 and thereafter (Fig. 2B), suggesting that Zmynd15 mRNA started to be expressed in late pachytene spermatocytes and later in spermatids. Moreover, our data are consistent with previous microarray data on Zmynd15 expression in purified spermatogenic cells and developing testes in the Gene Expression Omnibus database, showing that Zmynd15 is expressed in pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids (Gene Expression Omnibus profile GDS2390), the onset of Zmynd15 expression is at P18, and its levels increase thereafter and peak in adult testes (Gene Expression Omnibus profile GDS606). Zmynd15 encodes a protein of 703 amino acids in mice that contains a zinc finger MYND motif and a nuclear localization sequence (supplemental Fig. S1). Alignment analyses revealed that ZMYND15 is highly conserved among mice, rats, and humans (supplemental Fig. S1), as evidenced by >85% homology in their amino acid sequences. To further determine the cellular origin of Zmynd15 expression, we performed in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to localize Zymnd15 mRNA and protein in the testis (Fig. 3). Hybridization signals (represented by silver grains in dark field images) were detected in pachytene spermatocytes and all developing spermatids (steps 1–16) (Fig. 3, A–D). No signals were observed in either Sertoli cells or Leydig cells. The hybridization signals were first detected in early pachytene spermatocytes, and the intensity of the hybridization signals were higher in step 1–13 spermatids than in pachytene spermatocytes and late spermatids at steps 14–16. Zmynd15-null testis sections were used as a negative control, and no hybridization signals were detected (data not shown). Our in situ hybridization data are consistent with the RT-PCR data on developing testes (Fig. 2B), demonstrating that Zmynd15 mRNA is expressed predominantly in pachytene spermatocytes and spermatids. To determine Zmynd15 protein localization, we next performed immunohistochemistry on wild-type adult mouse testis sections using a polyclonal anti-ZMYND15 antibody. Immunoreactivity was first detected in step 2 round spermatids (Fig. 3, E and F). The intensity of the staining continuously increased thereafter and peaked in spermatids at steps 7–9. ZMYND15 levels started to decrease after step 9, and interestingly, in step 9–11 elongating spermatids, ZMYND15 immunoreactivity appeared to shift from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. No specific staining was detected when Zmynd15−/− testis sections were used (data not shown). Semi-quantitative PCR analyses using cDNAs prepared from purified testicular cell populations further confirmed that unlike Cxcl16, which was ubiquitously expressed in virtually all cell types within the testis, Zmynd15 mRNA was mainly expressed in pachytene spermatocytes and spermatids (Fig. 3G). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Zmynd15 is exclusively expressed in the testis and is localized to the developing haploid germ cells in the testis. A schematic summary of the localization patterns of Zmynd15 mRNA and protein during spermatogenesis is presented in supplemental Fig. S2. Despite the fact that the Cxcl16 knock-out mice are in fact Cxcl16-Zmynd15 double knock-outs, their spermatogenic defects are likely caused by the inactivation of Zmynd15 based upon the abundant testis-specific expression and consistency between the late spermiogenic defects and the expression sites and function of ZMYND15 (see below). We initially observed that when male Zmynd15−/− male mice were mated with wild-type female mice for >6 months, no litters were born. Further timed mating experiments revealed that 10 of 10 wild-type female mice that were mated with Zmynd15+/− male mice (as judged by the presence of vaginal plugs next morning after adding the females to the male cages) became pregnant and later produced 10 litters with normal litter size (∼6–8 pups in the C57Bl/6:129Sv/Ev hybrid background), whereas none of the 10 wild-type females that were mated with Zmynd15−/− males were pregnant and produced any litters. Zmynd15−/− females, on the other hand, displayed normal fertility. Zmynd15-null testes showed ∼25% reduction in weight (Fig. 4A). No spermatozoa were found in the caudal epididymis (Fig. 4B) of Zmynd15-null mice. Reduced testicular weight and the lack of spermatozoa in the epididymis suggest a spermatogenic disruption in the Zmynd15-null testes. Histological examination of the Zmynd15-null testes revealed a severe depletion of haploid spermatids characterized by spermatids detaching from the seminiferous epithelium and sloughing into the lumen of the seminiferous tubules (Fig. 5, A–D). Most of the seminiferous tubules in the Zmynd15-null testes lacked or a showed reduced number of late haploid cells (elongating and elongated spermatids). It was difficult to stage each cross-section of the Zmynd15-null seminiferous tubules because of the severe spermatid depletion, but the tubules displayed less severely disrupted histology and were mainly at stages IX–XII. We thus estimated that those tubules with severe spermatid depletion were mainly stage I–VIII tubules (for criteria of the mouse seminiferous epithelium staging see Ref. 3Ahmed E.A. de Rooij D.G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 558: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar and supplemental Fig. S2). Round spermatids were still present in the majority of the stage I–VIII tubules, and thus it appeared that the depleted haploid cells were mainly step 13–16 elongated spermatids. Closer examination of the seminiferous tubules indicated that few, if any, step 13–16 spermatids were present, and in stage I–VIII tubules where elongated spermatids were actively depleted, round spermatids appeared to be being depleted as well, although they were still present (supplemental Fig. S3). Consistent with the depletion of both elongated and round spermatids in the Zmynd15-null testes, numerous pycnotic-looking cells resembling round spermatids were observed in the epididymis (supplemental Fig. S4). The depletion of spermatids appeared to be achieved via detaching from the epithelium followed by sloughing into the"
https://openalex.org/W2015987270,"Chromatin undergoes a variety of changes in response to UV-induced DNA damage, including histone acetylation. In human and Drosophila cells, this response is affected by mutations in the tumor suppressor p53. In this work, we report that there is a global decrease in trimethylated Lys-9 in histone H3 (H3K9me3) in salivary gland cells in wild type flies in response to UV irradiation. In contrast, flies with mutations in the Dmp53 gene have reduced basal levels of H3K9me3, which are then increased after UV irradiation. The reduction of H3K9me3 in response to DNA damage occurs preferentially in heterochromatin. Our experiments demonstrate that UV irradiation enhances the levels of Lys-9 demethylase (dKDM4B) transcript and protein in wild type flies, but not in Dmp53 mutant flies. Dmp53 binds to a DNA element in the dKdm4B gene as a response to UV irradiation. Furthermore, heterozygous mutants for the dKdm4B gene are more sensitive to UV irradiation; they are deficient in the removal of cyclobutane-pyrimidine dimers, and the decrease of H3K9me3 levels following DNA damage is not observed in dKdm4B mutant flies. We propose that in response to UV irradiation, Dmp53 enhances the expression of the dKDM4B histone demethylase, which demethylates H3K9me3 preferentially in heterochromatin regions. This mechanism appears to be essential for the proper function of the nucleotide excision repair system."

Here, we examined the TH2-3-mediated regulation of proinflammatory cytokines in bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated mouse macrophages. The presence of TH2-3 in LPS-stimulated cells reduced the amount of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α secretion. From a microarray, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and cytokine array studies, we showed down-regulation of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, and the prostaglandin synthesis gene, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, by TH2-3. Studies with the COX-2-specific inhibitor, melaxicam, and with COX-2-overexpressing cells demonstrated the positive regulation of TNF-α and negative regulation of cAMP degradation-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4D by COX-2. In LPS-stimulated cells, TH2-3 acts like melaxicam and down-regulates COX-2 and up-regulates PDE4D. The reduction in intracellular cAMP by TH2-3 or melaxicam in LPS-stimulated cells supports the negative regulation of PDE4D by COX-2 and TH2-3. This demonstrates that the inhibition of COX-2 is among the mechanisms through which TH2-3 controls TNF-α release. At 1 h after treatment, the presence of TH2-3 in LPS-stimulated cells had suppressed the induction of pERK1/2 and prevented the LPS-stimulated nuclear accumulation of NF-κB family proteins of p65, NF-κB2, and c-Rel. In conclusion, TH2-3 inhibits TNF-α and other proinflammatory cytokines through COX-2-, PDE4D-, and pERK1/2-dependent mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2095829772,"The T-cell oncogene Lim-only 2 (LMO2) critically influences both normal and malignant haematopoiesis. LMO2 is not normally expressed in T cells, yet ectopic expression is seen in the majority of T-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) patients with specific translocations involving LMO2 in only a subset of these patients. Ectopic lmo2 expression in thymocytes of transgenic mice causes T-ALL, and retroviral vector integration into the LMO2 locus was implicated in the development of clonal T-cell disease in patients undergoing gene therapy. Using array-based chromatin immunoprecipitation, we now demonstrate that in contrast to B-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, human T-ALL samples largely use promoter elements with little influence from distal enhancers. Active LMO2 promoter elements in T-ALL included a previously unrecognized third promoter, which we demonstrate to be active in cell lines, primary T-ALL patients and transgenic mice. The ETS factors ERG and FLI1 previously implicated in lmo2-dependent mouse models of T-ALL bind to the novel LMO2 promoter in human T-ALL samples, while in return LMO2 binds to blood stem/progenitor enhancers in the FLI1 and ERG gene loci. Moreover, LMO2, ERG and FLI1 all regulate the +1 enhancer of HHEX/PRH, which was recently implicated as a key mediator of early progenitor expansion in LMO2-driven T-ALL. Our data therefore suggest that a self-sustaining triad of LMO2/ERG/FLI1 stabilizes the expression of important mediators of the leukaemic phenotype such as HHEX/PRH."

We adopted multiple experimental approaches to demonstrate that in p53-impaired cancer cells, DNA damage caused accumulation of p53 paralogue p73 via Chk-1 that strongly impacted Bax expression and p53-independent apoptosis. On the contrary, when p53 function was restored by ectopic expression, Chk-2 induced p53 accumulation that in turn overshadowed p73 activity, suggesting an antagonistic interaction between p53 family members.

IntroductionVoltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels are responsible for the rising component of the action potential. The Nav channel is composed of a 260-kDa α-subunit containing the ion-selective pore together with 25–40-kDa regulatory β-subunits. There are 10 mammalian α-subunit genes (Nav 1.1–1.9 and an atypical channel) and 4 β-subunit genes (β 1–4) (1Cusdin F.S. Clare J.J. Jackson A.P.

The β-subunits influence the kinetics and voltage dependence of the α-subunit gating (3Isom L.L. Neuroscientist. 2001; 7: 42-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Individual α and β-subunit genes are expressed in complex tissue-specific and developmentally regulated patterns to generate a wide combinatorial variety of channels with distinct properties, which presumably reflects the differing physiological demands of individual cells, tissues, and organs (4Yu F.H. Catterall W.A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 207Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). A noticeable example is shown by the neuronal channel α-subunit Nav1.3 (5Chen Y.H. Dale T.J. Romanos M.A. Whitaker W.R. Xie X.M. Clare J.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 4281-4289PubMed Google Scholar) and the β3-subunit (6Morgan K. Stevens E.B. Shah B. Cox P.J. Dixon A.K. Lee K. Pinnock R.D.

This suggests that the β3-subunit may play an important role in the selective regulation of Nav1.3 in both physiological and pathological situations.As with all β-subunits, β3 is composed of an extracellular V-type immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, a single α-helical transmembrane domain, and a short intracellular domain (6Morgan K. Stevens E.B. Shah B. Cox P.J. Dixon A.K. Lee K. Pinnock R.D. Hughes J. Richardson P.J. Mizuguchi K. Jackson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In both β3 and its close homolog β1, mutations that affect the structure of the Ig domain modify gating behavior (15McCormick K.A. Isom L.L. Ragsdale D. Smith D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol.

Patel M.K. Jackson A.P. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This ambiguity is compounded by the current lack of structural information on any β-subunit intracellular domain.Here we use whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology to examine the effect of β3 on Nav1.3 gating. We show that β3 generates multiphasic inactivation curves and reduces the proportion of channels that inactivate via a fast current decay in favor of a novel, relatively slow current decay. Using CD and NMR spectroscopy, we identify a short amphipathic α-helix and a C-terminal disordered region within the β3-subunit intracellular domain. We show that both of these features selectively help to stabilize fast inactivation of Nav1.3. Our work reveals new insights into the effects of the β3-subunit on Nav gating and provides a striking example of Nav regulation driven by localized conformationally dynamic motifs.DISCUSSIONHere we show that in HEK293 cells, β3 depolarizes the voltage sensitivity of Nav1.3 activation and inactivation and induces biphasic components of inactivation. The β3-WT subunit slowed the time to peak current and the rate of inactivation of Nav1.3. The slower time to peak could indicate an increased dwell time in the closed states before opening, a decreased rate of inactivation onset from the open state, or an increase in the return rate to the open state from the inactivated state. The β3-subunit increased the proportion of channels that inactivated with slower kinetics and increased the time constant for the slower component of inactivation. This generated the biphasic channel availability curves. To analyze these curves in more detail, we determined the percentage of inactivation at each conditioning potential. Separation of the fast and slower components of the test pulse currents clarified the nature of the different phases, enabled each phase to be studied individually without one contaminating the other, and provided detailed information on the voltage dependence of each component. We suggest that this approach could allow further mutational dissection of β3 domains even where the underlying gating behavior is not straightforward and the effects are subtle. Previous work in Xenopus oocytes has revealed similar inactivation effects (31Cummins T.R. Aglieco F. Renganathan M. Herzog R.I. Dib-Hajj S.D. Waxman S.G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5952-5961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, as far as we are aware, the ability of β3 reciprocally to modulate the proportion of channels operating with fast and slower inactivation kinetics has not been reported in mammalian cells. Our data are consistent with two possibilities. Either β3 substantially increases the time constant for fast inactivation in a proportion of channels or it reduces the probability that channels will follow this fast pathway.The β3-induced slower current is probably distinct from the previously described inherent Nav1.3 persistent current with its greater time constant of >150 ms (5Chen Y.H. Dale T.J. Romanos M.A. Whitaker W.R. Xie X.M. Clare J.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 4281-4289PubMed Google Scholar). Although we present a small (5–10%) theoretical persistent component by describing current decay with a double exponential function, current decay traces only spanned a 20-ms duration, which limits the accuracy of identifying a true late current. In common with most Nav channel studies in HEK293 cells (31Cummins T.R. Aglieco F. Renganathan M. Herzog R.I. Dib-Hajj S.D. Waxman S.G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5952-5961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we used a CsF-based internal solution. It has been shown previously that the use of CsF can destabilize the persistent current over time (5Chen Y.H. Dale T.J. Romanos M.A. Whitaker W.R. Xie X.M. Clare J.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 4281-4289PubMed Google Scholar). We were unable to detect a substantial persistent current using a 1-s conditioning pulse of the inactivation protocol. However, this was applied after the activation protocol, and it is possible that any persistent component had mostly disappeared by this time. Cummins et al. (31Cummins T.R. Aglieco F. Renganathan M. Herzog R.I. Dib-Hajj S.D. Waxman S.G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5952-5961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) previously reported that β3 slowed macroscopic current decay of Nav1.3 in HEK293 cells over potentials ranging from −40 to −10 mV. However, the current decay was described by a single exponential function, and channel availability curves were monophasic. This suggests that the biphasic components of the inactivation curves described here represent a previously unrecognized feature of Nav1.3 gating behavior. Cummins et al. (31Cummins T.R. Aglieco F. Renganathan M. Herzog R.I. Dib-Hajj S.D. Waxman S.G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5952-5961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) used a more negative holding potential and a different external buffer than we used here. Furthermore, unlike Cummins et al. (31Cummins T.R. Aglieco F. Renganathan M. Herzog R.I. Dib-Hajj S.D. Waxman S.G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5952-5961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we included ATP and GTP in the internal buffer (experimental procedure). It is possible that this difference could influence the phosphorylation status of Nav1.3 in our experiments.The depolarizing shifts observed with β3 in HEK293 cells are in the opposite direction to those shown by β3 and Nav1.3 when co-expressed in CHO cells (32Meadows L.S. Chen Y.H. Powell A.J. Clare J.J. Ragsdale D.S. Neuroscience. 2002; 114: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Such cell-dependent differences have been reported for several sodium channel α- and β-subunit pairs (33McEwen D.P. Meadows L.S. Chen C. Thyagarajan V. Isom L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16044-16049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 34Qu Y. Curtis R. Lawson D. Gilbride K. Ge P. DiStefano P.S. Silos-Santiago I. Catterall W.A. Scheuer T. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 18: 570-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), but the explanation is unclear. The HEK293 cell line is a widely used and convenient expression system to study the electrophysiolgical properties of Nav and other ion channels (35Thomas P. Smart T.G. J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods. 2005; 51: 187-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Immunological and microarray analysis suggest that the HEK293 cell-line is neuronally derived (36Shaw G. Morse S. Ararat M. Graham F.L. Faseb. J. 2002; 16: 869-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) and may, therefore, be the more physiologically relevant model. If the influence of β3 on Nav1.3 in HEK293 cells is also apparent in a primary neuronal cell, it would delay repolarization, amplify the response to presynaptic signals, and increase the excitability of neurons in vivo. Hence the parallel up-regulation of Nav1.3 and β3 in rat dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons after peripheral nerve injury (10Shah B.S. Stevens E.B. Gonzalez M.I. Bramwell S. Pinnock R.D. Lee K. Dixon A.K. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 3985-3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) could contribute to pain sensation. The recently described β3 knock-out mouse (37Hakim P. Brice N. Thresher R. Lawrence J. Zhang Y. Jackson A.P. Grace A.A. Huang C.L. Acta Physiol. (Oxf). 2010; 198: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) will be an excellent model organism with which to address these questions in further detail.Because β3-WT and both mutants similarly increased the fraction of slowly inactivating current, the region on β3 that is responsible for these effects probably lies outside the intracellular domain elements investigated here. In contrast, our data indicate that fast inactivation is selectively sensitive to mutations within the β3 intracellular domain. Surprisingly, β3-WT did not significantly affect the voltage dependence of fast inactivation relative to Nav1.3 alone, yet both mutants clearly destabilized this specific parameter. It seems unlikely that both mutants have independently created a new binding site on the α-subunit capable of destabilizing fast inactivation. Rather we suggest that the intracellular domain normally stabilizes fast inactivation, whereas the extracellular and/or transmembrane domains destabilize, resulting in no net detectable effect on fast inactivation for β3-WT. If the stabilizing effect of the intracellular domain is compromised by mutation, the destabilizing effects of the other regions will then predominate.How might the β3 intracellular domain normally stabilize fast inactivation? During fast inactivation a short cytoplasmic loop between domain DIII and IV of the α-subunit acts as a hinged lid to block the inner mouth of the ion-conducting pore (38West J.W. Patton D.E. Scheuer T. Wang Y. Goldin A.L. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 10910-10914Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Recent work indicates that an α-helix at the α-subunit C terminus interacts with the DIII-IV linker and helps to stabilize fast inactivation (39Motoike H.K. Liu H. Glaaser I.W. Yang A.S. Tateyama M. Kass R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Interestingly, an adjacent region of the α-subunit C terminus (the EF hand) binds the intracellular domain of β1 and β3 (40Spampanato J. Kearney J.A. de Haan G. McEwen D.P. Escayg A. Aradi I. MacDonald B.T. Levin S.I. Soltesz I. Benna P. Montalenti E. Isom L.L. Goldin A.L. Meisler M.H. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10022-10034Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We suggest that this interaction may promote the association of the α-subunit C terminus with the DIII-IV linker, perhaps by holding the C terminus in the optimal alignment for linker binding. It will be important now to test this hypothesis by a combination of structural and biochemical methods.Our work provides the first structural analysis of any Nav β-subunit intracellular domain. Both the CD and NMR data indicate the β3 intracellular domain adopts a disordered conformation for the case of the free unassembled β3-subunit. However, the increase in α-helical content shown by intracellular domain peptides in the presence of 30% TFE suggests that the β3-intracellular domain also contains a motif that can undergo a selective disorder to order transition depending on the local microenvironment and in so doing generates a potential binding site. Such regions have been called molecular recognition features (MoRFs) and can play important roles in initiating protein-protein interactions (41Mohan A. Oldfield C.J. Radivojac P. Vacic V. Cortese M.S. Dunker A.K. Uversky V.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 1043-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The short amphipathic α-helix within the β3 intracellular domain may represent another example of this behavior. Because β3-AP and β3-ΔSE mutants both destabilized fast inactivation, our data suggest that the interaction site encompasses both structural regions and is, therefore, likely to extend along most of the β3 intracellular domain.In summary, we show that the β3-subunit can induce complex gating behavior in Nav1.3 by modulating the proportion of fast and slower inactivating channels. We further show that the β3 intracellular domain specifically influences fast inactivation with an unexpected subtlety that raises new questions concerning the regulation of sodium channel gating and its pathophysiological implications. IntroductionVoltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels are responsible for the rising component of the action potential. The Nav channel is composed of a 260-kDa α-subunit containing the ion-selective pore together with 25–40-kDa regulatory β-subunits. There are 10 mammalian α-subunit genes (Nav 1.1–1.9 and an atypical channel) and 4 β-subunit genes (β 1–4) (1Cusdin F.S. Clare J.J. Jackson A.P. Traffic. 2008; 9: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 2Goldin A.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 871-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The β-subunits influence the kinetics and voltage dependence of the α-subunit gating (3Isom L.L. Neuroscientist. 2001; 7: 42-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Individual α and β-subunit genes are expressed in complex tissue-specific and developmentally regulated patterns to generate a wide combinatorial variety of channels with distinct properties, which presumably reflects the differing physiological demands of individual cells, tissues, and organs (4Yu F.H. Catterall W.A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 207Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). A noticeable example is shown by the neuronal channel α-subunit Nav1.3 (5Chen Y.H. Dale T.J. Romanos M.A. Whitaker W.R. Xie X.M. Clare J.J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 4281-4289PubMed Google Scholar) and the β3-subunit (6Morgan K. Stevens E.B. Shah B. Cox P.J. Dixon A.K. Lee K. Pinnock R.D. Hughes J. Richardson P.J. Mizuguchi K. Jackson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 2308-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The tissue-specific expression patterns of Nav1.3 correlate closely with β3 (6Morgan K. Stevens E.B. Shah B. Cox P.J. Dixon A.K. Lee K. Pinnock R.D. Hughes J. Richardson P.J. Mizuguchi K.

Furthermore, the expression of these two proteins is co-coordinately up-regulated in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons in a nerve-injury model of neuropathic pain (10Shah B.S. Stevens E.B.

Neurol. 2002; 52: 786-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This suggests that the β3-subunit may play an important role in the selective regulation of Nav1.3 in both physiological and pathological situations.As with all β-subunits, β3 is composed of an extracellular V-type immunoglobulin (Ig) domain, a single α-helical transmembrane domain, and a short intracellular domain (6Morgan K. Stevens E.B. Shah B. Cox P.J. Dixon A.K. Lee K. Pinnock R.D. Hughes J. Richardson P.J. Mizuguchi K. Jackson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 2308-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In both β3 and its close homolog β1, mutations that affect the structure of the Ig domain modify gating behavior (15McCormick K.A. Isom L.L. Ragsdale D. Smith D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3954-3962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 16Yu E.J. Ko S.H. Lenkowski P.W. Pance A. Patel M.K. Jackson A.P. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). By contrast, the effects of the intracellular domains are less clearly established. In β1, there are conflicting reports concerning the effects of the intracellular domain on α-subunit gating (17Meadows L. Malhotra J.D. Stetzer A. Isom L.L. Ragsdale D.S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1871-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 18McCormick K.A. Srinivasan J. White K. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32638-32646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the case of β3, the role of the intracellular domain has been difficult to assess as its deletion led to a β3-subunit that failed to bind the α-subunit (16Yu E.J. Ko S.H. Lenkowski P.W. Pance A. Patel M.K. Jackson A.P. Biochem. J. 2005; 392: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This ambiguity is compounded by the current lack of structural information on any β-subunit intracellular domain.Here we use whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology to examine the effect of β3 on Nav1.3 gating. We show that β3 generates multiphasic inactivation curves and reduces the proportion of channels that inactivate via a fast current decay in favor of a novel, relatively slow current decay. Using CD and NMR spectroscopy, we identify a short amphipathic α-helix and a C-terminal disordered region within the β3-subunit intracellular domain. We show that both of these features selectively help to stabilize fast inactivation of Nav1.3. Our work reveals new insights into the effects of the β3-subunit on Nav gating and provides a striking example of Nav regulation driven by localized conformationally dynamic motifs."

Furthermore, proteases are druggable targets for the development of new anti-parasitic therapy. The subtilisin protease (SUB; Clan SB, family S8) of Leishmania donovani was cloned and found to possess a unique catalytic triad. This gene was then deleted by gene knock-out, which resulted in reduced ability by the parasite to undergo promastigote to amastigote differentiation in vitro. Electron microscopy of SUB knock-out amastigotes revealed abnormal membrane structures, retained flagella, and increased binucleation. SUB-deficient Leishmania displayed reduced virulence in both hamster and murine infection models. Histology of spleens from SUB knock-out-infected hamsters revealed the absence of psammoma body calcifications indicative of the granulomatous lesions that occur during Leishmania infection. To delineate the specific role of SUB in parasite physiology, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was carried out on SUB−/− versus wild-type parasites. SUB knock-out parasites showed altered regulation of the terminal peroxidases of the trypanothione reductase system. Leishmania and other trypanosomatids lack glutathione reductase, and therefore rely on the novel trypanothione reductase system to detoxify reactive oxygen intermediates and to maintain redox homeostasis. The predominant tryparedoxin peroxidases were decreased in SUB−/− parasites, and higher molecular weight isoforms were present, indicating altered processing. In addition, knock-out parasites showed increased sensitivity to hydroperoxide. These data suggest that subtilisin is the maturase for tryparedoxin peroxidases and is necessary for full virulence.

Protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania cause a variety of vector-borne diseases in vertebrates, including cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral leishmaniases in humans. Due to the lack of safe and effective treatments for this disease, leishmaniasis is classified by the World Health Organization as a Tropical Disease Research Category I disease, an emerging or uncontrolled disease (1Scientific Working Group on Leishmaniasis and UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases Report of the Scientific Working Group Meeting on Leishmaniasis, Geneva, 2–4 February, 2004. World Health Organization, Geneva2004Google Scholar). This kinetoplastid parasite has a relatively simple dimorphic life cycle consisting of promastigote and amastigote stages. Leishmania promastigotes multiply extracellularly as spindle-shaped flagellates in the midgut of the phlebotomine sandfly vector. The parasites are then transmitted to a mammalian host when an infected sandfly bites to take in a blood meal. In the naïve host the parasites infect macrophages and differentiate into amastigotes. This form of the parasite is an ovoid intracellular aflagellate. Throughout its life cycle, Leishmania is exposed to a variety of reactive oxygen species that it must detoxify to survive. Antioxidant defense is particularly important for amastigotes, because they must also survive the oxidative burst generated by the host macrophages (2Levick M.P. Tetaud E. Fairlamb A.H. Blackwell J.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 96: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Recent advances in parasite molecular biology and bioinformatics have enabled us to strategically identify and study Leishmania proteins as therapeutic targets. Parasite proteases are viable drug targets, because many of them are required for the pathogenic life cycle of the parasite (3Sajid M. McKerrow J.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 120: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 4McKerrow J.H. Caffrey C. Kelly B. Loke P. Sajid M. Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2006; 1: 497-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). We have identified an unusual Clan SB, family S8 subtilisin-like serine protease in Leishmania as one of these therapeutic targets. This family of endopeptidases is conserved across all biological kingdoms (5Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. Leunissen J.A. Dijkstra B.W. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 719-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Subtilisins are protein-processing enzymes and known virulence factors for both Plasmodium and Toxoplasma parasites (6Miller S.A. Binder E.M. Blackman M.J. Carruthers V.B. Kim K. J. Biol.

In this study we describe the identification and phenotypic characterization of Leishmania subtilisin. This protease was found to process the terminal peroxidases of the trypanothione reductase system. This system plays an important role in Leishmania survival within host macrophages and is being intensely studied as a target for antiparasitic drug development (13Krauth-Siegel R.L. Comini M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1780: 1236-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). This study has found that subtilisin is an important regulator of this system and is key for parasite infectivity and virulence. Commercially bred, 6- to 8-week-old, female BALB/c mice (Mus musculus) were used for the murine footpad infection model (Charles River Laboratories International, Inc., Davis, CA). Commercially bred, 4- to 5-week-old, male Golden Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) were used for the visceral infection model (Simonsen Laboratories, Inc., Gilroy, CA). Leishmania donovani donovani MHOM/ET/67/HU3 cloned stock and Leishmania major LV39 MRHO/SU/59/P were used for knock-out studies and for animal infections. Leishmania promastigotes were cultured at 27 °C in M199 (Sigma) liquid medium as previously described (14Wallis A.E. McMaster W.R. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 1814-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Axenic amastigotes of L. donovani were cultured at 37 °C in 100% fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific Inc., Tarzana, CA) as previously described (15Doyle P.S. Engel J.C. Pimenta P.F. da Silva P.P. Dwyer D.M. Exp. Parasitol. 1991; 73: 326-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA from L. donovani was isolated as previously described (16Medina-Acosta E. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The subtilisin gene was then amplified from this genomic DNA by PCR using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) in two overlapping pieces, termed the 5′ and 3′ halves. For each half, an external primer from the non-coding flanks of the gene and an internal primer were designed based on regions of identity between the known L. infantum and L. major sequences (Sanger Institute GeneDB: LinJ13_V3.0940 and LmjF13.1040). Both halves were cloned into the pGEM-7Zf(−) vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and then spliced together using an internal HindIII site. The open reading frame was sequenced using the following primers: 5′-CAT GCA TCA GCC GGT AC-3′, 5′-GCG GCA TGG TCA TCT AC-3′, 5′-TAC TCA CAA TCT CTA CG-3′, 5′-CAC CAG TAA GAG TGC GG-3′, 5′-GAA GAG CCG CCA CCG TG-3′, 5′-CGT GCT GGC AGG ACA GC-3′, 5′-TCC TCT TTG AGG GTG CG-3′, 5′-TAG CCA TAG CCC ACC GC-3′, 5′-CTC CTC TTT GAG GGT GC-3′, 5′-CGC TCT GTC TCG AGG CG-3′, 5′-GTG TGG GGC AGC GGC AG-3′, 5′-ACC GTT GGC TGT CAG AG-3′, 5′-CGT TAG GAG ACG CCG CA-3′, 5′-CGT CGT CAG CAC AAG AG-3′, 5′-ACC CAC CTT CCG CTT CG-3′, 5′-GTG CCA GCA GAC CAC GG-3′, 5′-TAG GCA GCG GTG CCG AC-3′, 5′-AAC GGC AGC AGG CTC TC-3′, 5′-GTC GGC ACC GCT GCC TA-3′, 5′-ATC GGC TAT AGG ATT CC-3′, 5′-CAG TAG CCC GCA GGT GC-3′, 5′-CGT TGT CTG TGC CGA CC-3′, and 5′-ACT GAT CAG CCA AGG CG-3′. The amino acid sequence of L. donovani subtilisin catalytic core was identified using Pfam (accession number PF00082, Subtilase family) and was aligned with homologous sequences from L. infantum, L. major, L. braziliensis, T. cruzi (1 and 2), T. brucei (1 and 2), P. falciparum (1, 2, and 3), T. gondii (1a, 1b, and 2), B. licheniformis, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. subtilis, H. sapiens (furin and Site-1), M. musculus, S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, C. intestinalis, A. mellifera, X. laevis, and D. rerio (respectively: LinJ13_V3.0940, LmjF13.1040, LbrM13_V2.0860, Tc00.1047053511045.40, Tc00.1047053511859.60, Tb11.02.1280, Tb927.3.4230, CAD51440, XP_001348051, CAD51437, XP_002370002, XP_002368971, XP_002364650, P00780, P00782, P04189, P09958, EAW95506, P23188, P13134, Q09175, XP_002122807, XP_395754, NP_001087381, and CAK04389) using the ClustalW algorithm from MegAlign (DNASTAR, Madison, WI). Transformation constructs were generated by PCR amplification of L. donovani and L. major SUB 2The abbreviations used are: SUBsubtilisinAMC7-amino-4-methylcoumarinSite-1membrane-bound transcription factor peptidaseTRtrypanothione reductaseTS2 and T(SH)2oxidized and reduced trypanothioneTXNtryparedoxinTXNPxtryparedoxin peroxidasePrxperoxidoxinZbenzyloxycarbonyl. cores, adding a 5′ SalI site (bold) followed by a Kex2 cleavage site (underlined) and a 3′ SpeI site (underlined bold) using forward (L.d.: 5′-CTC GTC GAC AAA AGA GCA CAC CGT TCC ACA GAT GCG-3′; L.m.: CTC GTC GAC AAA AGA GCA CGC CGT TCC ACC GAT GCG) and reverse (L.d.: 5′-CTC ACT AGT TCA ACA CGG GCA AGT CGA TTC TGA C-3′; L.m.: 5′-CTC ACT AGT TCA ACA CGA GAG AGT CGA TTC TGA CG-3′) primers, and then cloned into pPICZa A (Invitrogen). The pPICZα-SUB constructs were electroporated into X-33 P. pastoris, and expression clones were isolated and induced for 96 h as per the manufacturer's protocol. For each L. donovani and L. major SUB, three clones were independently evaluated for protease activity. Supernatant from induced cultures was harvested by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min, followed by 0.2-μm filtration (Nalge Nunc). Expressed SUB protein was then buffer-exchanged with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and concentrated on an Amicon Ultra-4 10,000 NMWL filter device (Millipore, Billerica, MA). This concentrate was then fractionated by hydrophobic interaction. The sample was diluted 1:1 to a final buffer concentration 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with 1 m ammonium sulfate and loaded onto a HiTrap Octyl-Sepharose 4FF hydrophobic interaction column (Amersham Biosciences). A 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer with 1 m ammonium sulfate was used for column equilibration, sample loading, and washing at a 1 ml/min flow rate. The ammonium sulfate concentration was decreased from 1–0 m over 40 column volumes to elute the SUB protein. The eluate was desalted by buffer exchanging with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and concentrated by Amicon. SUB protein concentration was measured by inhibitor titration with PPACK (H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-CMK) and NanoDrop 1000. subtilisin 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin membrane-bound transcription factor peptidase trypanothione reductase oxidized and reduced trypanothione tryparedoxin tryparedoxin peroxidase peroxidoxin benzyloxycarbonyl. Protease activity was measured using peptide substrates containing C-terminal 7-amino-4-carbamoylmethylcoumarin (AMC) as the fluorogenic leaving group. The synthetic substrates Z-VFRSLK-AMC, Z-RVRR-AMC, and Z-RR-AMC were used. Initial test reactions contained 20 μm substrate. For Km determination VFRSLK was serially diluted from 100–0.05 μm, and RVRR was serially diluted from 20 to 0.025 μm. Enzyme samples were mixed with substrate in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 0.2% DMSO in 150 μl of total volume. Hydrolysis of the substrates was measured at 25 °C using a FlexStation microplate spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Excitation/emission for AMC and 7-amino-4-carbamoyl-methylcoumarin were 355/460 nm and 380/460 nm, respectively. Vmax values were calculated using the accompanying SoftMax Pro v4.8 software. For Southern blot analysis, genomic DNA was digested with indicated restriction endonucleases (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA and Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), and fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 0.6% agarose gel (17Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). These were then transferred to Hybond-N+ (Amersham Biosciences) nylon filters by the manufacturer's instructions for alkali transfer. Southern blot probes were 32P-labeled using a Rediprime II Random Prime Labeling System (Amersham Biosciences) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Hybridization and washing conditions were performed as previously described (18Button L.L. Russell D.G. Klein H.L. Medina-Acosta E. Karess R.E. McMaster W.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 32: 271-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from L. donovani promastigotes and axenic amastigotes (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). RNA (5 μg/lane) was size-fractionated, and Northern blot hybridization was performed as previously described. Two knock-out cassettes (one for each allele) were created to delete the L. donovani and L. major SUB genes. These cassettes each contained an antibiotic resistance gene, hygr (conferring hygromycin B resistance) (20Gritz L. Davies J. Gene. 1983; 25: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), pacr (conferring puromycin resistance, used for L. donovani only) (21Lacalle R.A. Pulido D. Vara J. Zalacaín M. Jiménez A. Gene. 1989; 79: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), or satr (conferring nourseothricin resistance, L. major only) (22Joshi P.B. Webb J.R. Davies J.E. McMaster W.R. Gene. 1995; 156: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), followed by 1.5 kb of the 3′-untranslated region of the L. major dhfr-ts gene (23Joshi P.B. Sacks D.L. Modi G. McMaster W.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This untranslated region ensures high level expression during the life cycle of Leishmania. To target these knock-out cassettes to the SUB locus, 5′ and 3′ targeting flanks were created and ligated into their respective sides of the cassettes. These targeting flanks were generated by PCR amplification of the untranslated regions directly 5′ of the SUB ORF and 3′ of the SUB catalytic core (L. donovani) or 3′ of the ORF (L. major). PCR primers were designed based on the published L. infantum and L. major sequences (GeneDB): L. donovani 5′ flank forward (5′-CTC ACT AGT CGC CTC CTC GTC GTC GCA CTC-3′) and reverse (5′-CTC TCT AGA CAC CAC TAC CTC AAT CGG AGC G-3′) (1.3-kb fragment), 3′ flank forward (5′-CTC ACT AGT TGG TCA TCT ACG TCC GCT GTA GC-3′) and reverse (5′-CTC TCT AGA CGT GCC CTG ATC TGC GGC AGC-3′) (0.7-kb fragment); L. major 5′ flank forward (5′-CTC ACT AGT TGC GCA ACC ACA GCG GTC ATC-3′) and reverse (5′-CTC TCT AGA TAC CTC AAT GGG AGC GTG CTT G-3′) (1.5-kb fragment), 3′ flank forward (5′-CTC ACT AGT TCG TTG GAG AGG CCA ACG CGC-3′) and reverse (5′-CTC TCT AGA CGA GTA GGA AGA GGT GAC CGT C-3′) (0.8-kb fragment) primers (SpeI sites, in bold, and XbaI sites, underlined, were included for cloning). These constructs were maintained and amplified in the pGEM-9Zf(−) vector (Promega). For targeted gene deletion, 50 μg of the targeting constructs was excised from their vectors using the flanking restriction endonucleases SpeI and XbaI (New England Biolabs) and purified by electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gels then purified using the QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Purified transfection constructs described above were used to transfect log phase Leishmania promastigotes by electroporation (2.25 kV/cm, 500 microfarads) as previously described (23Joshi P.B. Sacks D.L. Modi G. McMaster W.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 519-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). After electroporation, the cells were grown and selected using hygromycin B, puromycin, or nourseothricin on both plates and in liquid media and clones were isolated as previously described (24Joshi P.B. Kelly B.L. Kamhawi S. Sacks D.L. McMaster W.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 120: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Day 4 SUB knock-out and wild-type parasites were split in triplicate into new M199 (for promastigote replication rates) and into 37 °C fetal bovine serum (for axenic amastigote replication). Parasite culture densities were determined on days 1–4 post-split by cell counting on a Multisizer 3 Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA). Axenic amastigote differentiation was observed by microscopy. Approximately 108 day 4 L. donovani axenic amastigotes from wild-type or SUB−/− cultures were pelleted and washed 3× in PBS. The parasites were processed for conventional EM by freeze-substitution in 1% OsO4/0.1% uranyl acetate in acetone and embedded in Epon resin. Sections were cut with a Leica Ultracut UCT Ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL) and viewed on a Tecnai T20 electron microscope (FEI Co., Hillsboro, OR) with a 4000 × 4000 UltraScan charge-coupled device camera (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA). Hamsters were infected intraperitoneally with 109 day 4 SUB knock-out or wild-type L. donovani promastigotes (groups of three) (25Wyllie S. Fairlamb A.H. Acta Trop. 2006; 97: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Animals were weighed weekly over the length of the experiment. Hamsters were culled 200 days post-infection by CO2 inhalation followed by thoracotomy. Pieces of each spleen and liver were fixed in 10% formalin in PBS and then embedded in paraffin for histology. Sections were cut at 5 μm and stained with either Wright-Giemsa or hematoxylin and eosin by the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) Morphology Core using standard protocols. Psamomma bodies were identified by microscopy and counted. Mice were infected with metacyclic L. major promastigotes purified from day 4 SUB+/− and wild-type cultures using negative selection by binding to peanut agglutinin as has been previously described (26Sacks D.L. Hieny S. Sher A. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 564-569PubMed Google Scholar). BALB/c mice (groups of 5) were anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation and infected subcutaneously in the left hind footpad with 5 × 106 metacyclic promastigotes in 50 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution. Footpad swelling was measured weekly after inoculation using a Mitutoyo caliper. Parasites were recovered from infected mice by resection of the left popliteal lymph node. Three experimental replicates were prepared from separately cultured samples of both wild-type and SUB knock-out L. donovani. Approximately 109 cells were pelleted, washed 3× with PBS, and stored at −80 °C. Lysates were prepared by resuspending the cell pellets in 2 ml of native lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, and 1× Halt EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Pierce). Cells were then broken by mechanical lysis using 70 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the clarified supernatants were dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl using 8-kDa molecular weight cut-off dialysis membranes. The following day the protein samples were concentrated and washed by precipitation using the ReadyPrep 2-D Cleanup Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA). Approximately 300 μg of protein per gel was brought up to 300 μl in Bio-Rad Rehydration/Sample buffer and was passively loaded onto 17-cm, 3–10 pH immobilized pH gradient isoelectric focusing strips. Isoelectric focusing was performed using slow increases in voltage over multiple steps up to 10 kV for a total of 60–65 kVh focusing time. Next, the strips were reduced and alkylated using sequential 10-min incubations in 2% DTT then 2.5% iodoacetamide and dissolved in sample equilibration buffer. The isoelectric focusing strips were run in the second dimension on 17 × 17 cm, 12.5% acrylamide Tris-glycine, SDS-PAGE gels. Gels were stained with SYPRO Ruby and imaged using a Typhoon Trio Variable Mode Imager (Amersham Biosciences). These images were utilized for spot intensity analysis using Bio-Rad PDQuest software (v. 7.4). For proteomic analysis, gels were silver-stained (27Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7832) Google Scholar), and selected protein spots were excised and in-gel-digested with trypsin (28Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Góñez J. Heldin C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 29Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). The resulting peptides were extracted and analyzed by on-line liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry using an Eksigent nanoflow pump (Dublin, CA) coupled to a QStar Pulsar quadrupole orthogonal acceleration, time-of-flight hybrid instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The reversed-phase chromatographic column was controlled with a Famos autoinjector (Sunnyvale, CA) and Eksigent software to run at a 5–50% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% formic acid with a 350 nl/min flow rate. Data were analyzed in Analyst 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems) with the Mascot script 1.6b20 (Matrix Science, London, UK). Analyst-processing options for peak finding in spectrum were 0.5% default threshold, 400 Gaussian filter, and a Gaussian filter limit of 10; for TOF auto-centroiding: 20 ppm merge distance, 10 ppm minimum width, 50% percentage height, and 100 ppm maximum width. Default parameters were used except that “no de-isotoping” was selected and precursor mass tolerance for grouping was set to 0.2. Database searches were performed using ProteinProspector v. 5.3.0 (available on-line) using the Batch-Tag and Search Compare modules (30Chalkley R.J. Baker P.R. Medzihradszky K.F. Lynn A.J. Burlingame A.L. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2008; 7: 2386-2398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Searches were performed on the SwissProt databank (December 16, 2008) to evaluate sample purity followed by searching TriTrypDB v. 1.0 beta (available on-line, January, 2009). These assays were performed as was previously described (31Castro H. Sousa C. Santos M. Cordeiro-da-Silva A. Flohé L. Tomas A.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1552-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Stationary phase Leishmania promastigotes were split into 2-ml M199 at 2 × 106 per ml in the presence of different concentrations tert-butylhydroperoxide (Sigma). Culture densities were determined after 5–6 days by using the Coulter Counter. Relative density was calculated by normalizing to untreated controls. The gene encoding L. donovani SUB was cloned as described above. Sequencing yielded a 5,235-bp gene. This sequence was submitted to GenBankTM with accession number ADA81891. The resultant 1,744-amino acid protein has an estimated molecular mass of 184.7 kDa. This protein has a predicted signal peptide (SignalP V2.0 HMM probability of 0.995) with a cleavage site between amino acids 38–39 (0.421 probability), and a probable C-terminal transmembrane helix between amino acids 1709–1731 (TMHMM v. 2.0). The published L. major SUB (GeneDB: LmjF13.1040) shares this general layout; however, SUB from the more closely related L. infantum (a subspecies from within the L. donovani complex) has a C-terminal truncation after amino acid 1192 (LinJ13_V3.0940). The Pfam predicted Subtilase family core for L. donovani SUB is between amino acids 86–414. Comparisons of L. donovani SUB to other trypanosomatid SUBs are summarized in Table 1. Interestingly, L. donovani SUB has a non-canonical catalytic triad with the catalytic Glu in place of the standard Asp due to a single C to G base pare change. L. infantum SUB also has Glu in place of the Asp, indicating that this adaptation may be specific to parasites in the L. donovani complex. The SUB catalytic core amino acid sequences are relatively conserved within the Leishmania species; however, these sequences have diverged considerably from those of the trypanosomes, with only a 40% identity between the genera.TABLE 1Comparison of predicted SUB proteins from trypanosomatidsSpeciesGeneaa identityCore identityLengthMolecular massCatalytic triad%%aakDaL. donovaniSUB100.0100.01744184.7Glu-97, His-130, Ser-395L. infantumSUB99.699.71192126.2Glu-97, His-130, Ser-395L. majorSUB89.094.51722182.7D99, His-132, Ser-397L. braziliensisSUB70.083.01785190.7D97, His-130, Ser-405T. cruziSUB123.140.31430160.5D219, His-269, Ser-502T. cruziSUB223.440.11408158.0D196, His-246, Ser-480T. bruceiSUB124.439.51487161.5D191, His-238, Ser-476 Open table in a new tab To determine the subfamily of Leishmania subtilisin, the catalytic core sequence was compared with the cores of other Clan SB, family S8 family members. Core sequences were aligned using ClustalW2 (EMBL-EBI), and a phylogenetic tree was generated (Fig. 1). The Leishmania SUBs group with the subfamily S8A proteases, which include the eukaryotic Site-1 peptidases and the bacterial subtilisins. This distinguishes Leishmania SUB from the Toxoplasma and Plasmodium SUBs and from the subfamily S8B kexins and furins. Site-1 peptidases are restricted to metazoan organisms and are known to process sterol regulatory element binding proteins, which are not found in trypanosomatids (32Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Elsevier Academic Press, Amsterdam2004Google Scholar). The catalytic cores of the subtilisin proteins from L. donovani and L. major were successfully recombinantly expressed. Site-1 proteases, to which Leishmania SUB is most similar, have a requirement for a lysine or arginine in the P4 position. For this reason SUB activity was evaluated using synthetic substrates with and without P4 Arg. Cleavage of the synthetic substrates RVRR and VFRSLK was detected in all of the SUB-expressing Pichia supernatants compared with the X-33 background strain. Slight activity against the RR substrate was only detected in one L. major clone. In this clone the RVRR Vmax was over six times that of RR. Poor cleavage of RR and the lack of detected protease activity in the X-33 control strain indicate that the cleavage is not due to endogenous KEX2. These results show that, like the Site-1 proteases, Leishmania SUB prefers a basic P4 residue. L. donovani and L. major SUB was isolated from the Pichia supernatants, and kcat and Km values were determined for both RVRR and VFRSLK substrates (Table 2). Both enzymes catalyzed the RVRR substrate at about a 10-fold faster rate than VFRSLK. The L. donovani SUB had a similar affinity for both substrates, whereas L. major SUB had a 10-fold higher affinity for RVRR. Interestingly, L. donovani SUB had a much lowe"
https://openalex.org/W1997669162,"Epithelial Na(+) absorption is regulated by Nedd4-2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that reduces expression of the epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) at the cell surface. Defects in this regulation cause Liddle syndrome, an inherited form of hypertension. Previous work found that Nedd4-2 functions through two distinct effects on trafficking, enhancing both ENaC endocytosis and ENaC degradation in lysosomes. To investigate the mechanism by which Nedd4-2 targets ENaC to lysosomes, we tested the role of hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs), a component of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-0 complex. We found that α-, β-, and γENaC each interact with Hrs. These interactions were enhanced by Nedd4-2 and were dependent on the catalytic function of Nedd4-2 as well as its WW domains. Mutation of ENaC PY motifs, responsible for inherited hypertension (Liddle syndrome), decreased Hrs binding to ENaC. Moreover, binding of ENaC to Hrs was reduced by dexamethasone/serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase and cAMP, which are signaling pathways that inhibit Nedd4-2. Nedd4-2 bound to Hrs and catalyzed Hrs ubiquitination but did not alter Hrs protein levels. Expression of a dominant negative Hrs lacking its ubiquitin-interacting motif (Hrs-ΔUIM) increased ENaC surface expression and current. This occurred through reduced degradation of the cell surface pool of proteolytically activated ENaC, which enhanced its recycling to the cell surface. In contrast, Hrs-ΔUIM had no effect on degradation of uncleaved inactive channels. The data support a model in which Nedd4-2 induces binding of ENaC to Hrs, which mediates the sorting decision between ENaC degradation and recycling."
https://openalex.org/W2082478189,"LIS1, a gene mutated in classical lissencephaly, plays essential roles in cytoplasmic dynein regulation, mitosis and cell migration. However, the regulation of LIS1 (lissencephaly protein 1) protein remains largely unknown. Genetic studies in Aspergillus nidulans have uncovered that the Nud (nuclear distribution) pathway is involved in the regulation of cytoplasmic dynein complex and a temperature-sensitive mutation in the nudC gene (L146P) greatly reduces the protein levels of NudF, an Aspergillus ortholog of LIS1. Here, we showed that L146 in Aspergillus NudC and its flanking region were highly conservative during evolution. The similar mutation in human NudC (L279P) obviously led to reduced LIS1 and cellular phenotypes similar to those of LIS1 down-regulation. To explore the underlying mechanism, we found that the p23 domain-containing protein NudC bound to the molecular chaperone Hsp90, which is also associated with LIS1. Inhibition of Hsp90 chaperone function by either geldanamycin or radicicol resulted in a decrease in LIS1 levels. Ectopic expression of Hsp90 partially reversed the degradation of LIS1 caused by overexpression of NudC-L279P. Furthermore, NudC was found to regulate the ATPase activity of Hsp90, which was repressed by the mutation of L279P. Interestingly, NudC itself was shown to possess a chaperone function, which also was suppressed by the L279P mutation. Together, these data suggest that NudC may be involved in the regulation of LIS1 stability by its chaperone function.

Martinez S. Reiner O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 6429-6434Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, the regulation of LIS1 protein is still largely unclear. Genetic studies in the filamentous fungus A. nidulans have uncovered an evolutionarily conserved pathway, Nud (nuclear distribution) pathway, which is involved in the regulation of the cytoplasmic dynein complex (23Morris N.R. J. Cell. Biol. 2000; 148: 1097-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Observation on this fungi shows that the nuclei move apart after mitosis, and then migrate toward the hyphal tip, resulting in a relatively even distribution along the mycelium (23Morris N.R. J. Cell. Biol. 2000; 148: 1097-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). A temperature-sensitive mutation in the nudC gene (nudC3) of A. nidulans specifically causes a strikingly uneven distribution of nuclei along the mycelium at the restrictive temperature (24Osmani A.H. Osmani S.A. Morris N.R. J. Cell. Biol. 1990; 111: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, this mutation substantially reduces the protein level of NudF, an Aspergillus ortholog of LIS1, and ectopic expression of the nudF gene is able to suppress the phenotypes of nudC3 mutation (13Xiang X. Osmani A.H. Osmani S.A. Xin M. Morris N.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 297-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). All of the suppressors of the nudC3 mutation reverse its temperature-sensitive phenotype by restoring the intracellular concentration of the NudF protein (25Chiu Y.H. Morris N.R. Genetics. 1995; 141: 453-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that NudC (nuclear distribution gene C) may be an upstream regulator of NudF in A. nidulans. In 1997, Chiu and Morris (26Chiu Y.H. Morris N.R. Genetics. 1997; 145: 707-714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the nudC3 has a missense mutation at amino acid 146 that causes leucine to be replaced by proline, which can be corrected by sncB69 (suppressor of nudC B69), a mutant tRNA(Leu). The sncB69 mutation loses a single nucleotide in the anticodon of a tRNA(Leu) that changes its normal leucine anticodon to the proline anticodon. This mutation may permit incorporation of leucine at the mutant nudC3 proline codon 146 and thereby suppress the nudC3 mutant phenotype. These data indicate that the L146P mutation of NudC leads to reduced LIS1 and consequently results in nuclear migration defects in Aspergillus. Here, we determine whether a similar event occurs in mammals. Our data showed that Leu146 in Aspergillus NudC is conserved to Leu279 in human NudC. Overexpression of NudC-L279P in mammalian cells led to a decrease of LIS1 level. The p23 domain-containing protein NudC not only forms a biochemical complex with LIS1 and the molecular chaperone Hsp90 (heat shock protein 90) but also influences the ATPase activity of Hsp90, suggesting that NudC may be a potential Hsp90 co-chaperone. Furthermore, inhibition of Hsp90 chaperone function results in a decrease in LIS1 levels, and ectopic expression of Hsp90 reverses the degradation of LIS1 caused by the L279P mutation of NudC, implying LIS1 as a possible client protein for Hsp90. These data, for the first time, indicate that NudC may be a potential Hsp90 co-chaperone to stabilize LIS1. Human NudC cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR and subcloned into pGEX5X-1 (GST fusion vector, Amersham Biosciences Pharmacia), pET-28a (His-tag vector, Novagen, Madison, WI), pCMV-Tag2C (FLAG epitope vector, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and pGFP-C1 (GFP fusion vector, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), respectively. GST-NudC-C (C terminus of NudC), FLAG-NudC-C, GST-NudC-N (N terminus of NudC) and FLAG-NudC-N also were separately constructed. GFP-LIS1 was kindly provided by Dr. X. L. Zhu (Shanghai Institutes of Biological Sciences, Shanghai, China). Both FLAG-LIS1 and GST-LIS1 were constructed by PCR using GFP-LIS1 as template. Human HSP90α cloned by RT-PCR were subcloned into pET-28a and pCMV-Tag2C vectors. FLAG-NudC-L279P, FLAG-NudC-Δp23, GFP-NudC-L279P, and His-NudC-L279P were constructed by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. Human p23 cDNA also was cloned into pET-28a vector. The sequences of all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected with the indicated constructs by GenePORTER transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA). Recombinant GST-fused proteins generated in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) were purified by incubation with glutathione-agarose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) followed by elution with glutathione elution buffer (10 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Recombinant His-tagged proteins produced in E. coli BL21 were purified by incubation with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen) as described previously (27Catlett M.G. Kaplan K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33739-33748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The concentrations of proteins were determined by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). GST pulldown and immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described previously (28Zhou T. Aumais J.P. Liu X. Yu-Lee L.Y. Erikson R.L. Dev.

The immunoprecipitates or total proteins isolated from mammalian cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting analyses with anti-NudC (28Zhou T. Aumais J.P. Liu X. Yu-Lee L.Y.

Cell. 2003; 5: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), Hsp90α, ERK2 (extracelluar signal-regulated kinase 2), GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), β-actin (Sigma), FLAG (M2), LIS1 (Sigma), and GFP (Zymed Laboratories, Inc., San Francisco, CA) antibodies, and the according horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences Pharmacia). HeLa cells grown on coverslips were fixed with cold methanol (−20 °C) and then stained with either anti-γ-tubulin or α-tubulin antibodies (Sigma), followed by incubation with Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse Ig secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). DNA was stained with DAPI (Sigma). The mounted coverslips were analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy (LSM510, Carl Zeiss, Germany). HeLa cells transfected with either FLAG-NudC or pCMV-Tag 2C vector were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation purification with anti-FLAG antibody-coupled beads (Sigma). The identification of NudC immunoprecipitation mixture was carried out by Reach Center for Proteome Analysis, Shanghai Institutes of Biological Sciences (Shanghai, China). Briefly, the proteins were subjected to trypsin digestion, and the recovered peptide mixtures were separated by reversed-phase HPLC followed by tandem mass analysis as described (30Tu C.J. Dai J. Li S.J. Sheng Q.H. Deng W.J. Xia Q.C. Zeng R. J. Proteome Res. 2005; 4: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The peak lists of all acquired MS/MS spectra were generated by the BioWorksTM software, and then they were automatically searched against the human International Protein Index protein sequence database (version 3.36) with the SEQUEST algorithm (31Deng W.J. Nie S. Dai J. Wu J.R. Zeng R. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2009; 9: 100-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Proteins identified in both the pCMV-Tag 2C and FLAG-NudC groups were excluded from the results. The obtained NudC-interacting proteins were classified according to Gene Ontology categories (UniProtKB). Geldanamycin (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) and radicicol (Sigma) were stored in the dark at −20 °C as a stock solution of 1.78 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide and 2.74 mm in ethanol, respectively. Immediately prior to use, either geldanamycin or radicicol was prepared in culture medium. Cells were incubated with either Hsp90 inhibitors or the corresponding control reagents in different concentrations for various periods as described in the text. To completely remove the inorganic phosphate, all of the proteins for Hsp90 ATPase were fully dialyzed into the buffer (50 mm Tris, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4). ATPase assays were performed in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 20 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm ATP) and 1 μm Hsp90 at 37 °C with 2 μm NudC, NudC-L279P, or p23 for 20 min. The released inorganic phosphate was determined by measuring the absorbance at 650 nm using Cyto Phosphate Assay BIOCHEM kit (Cytoskeleton, Inc., Denver, CO). The remaining ATPase activity in the presence of 60 μm geldanamycin was interpreted as background and thus was subtracted from all of the total activities (27Catlett M.G. Kaplan K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33739-33748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 32McLaughlin S.H. Smith H.W. Jackson S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 787-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The aggregation reaction of citrate synthase (Sigma) was performed as described previously (33Faircloth L.M. Churchill P.F. Caldwell G.A. Caldwell K.A. Cell. Stress Chaperones. 2009; 14: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, citrate synthase (0.15 μm) was incubated at 43 °C for 30 min either alone or in the presence of BSA (0.75 μm), NudC, NudC-L279P, or Hsp90 (0.15 μm each). To monitor kinetics of thermal aggregation, light scattering was measured in a DU 800 spectrophotometer (Beckman, Fullerton, CA) at 370 nm. In A. nidulans, the mutation of L146P in NudC (nudC3) greatly decreases the concentration of NudF protein at non-permissive temperature (26Chiu Y.H. Morris N.R. Genetics. 1997; 145: 707-714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we investigated whether a similar event happened in mammals. Sequence analysis showed that both Leu146 and its flanking amino acid residues in Aspergillus NudC were conserved to Leu279 and its neighboring residues in human NudC (Fig. 1A). Western blotting revealed that overexpression of human NudC-L279P in HeLa cells caused a significant decrease in LIS1 protein levels, whereas the level of ERK2 remained unchanged (Fig. 1B), suggesting a conservative function of NudC during evolution. Furthermore, overexpression of NudC-L279P also led to cellular phenotypes similar to LIS1 deficiency, such as perinuclear accumulation of microtubules and enlarged distance between the centrosome and nucleus (Fig. 1, C–F) (9Smith D.S. Niethammer M. Ayala R. Zhou Y. Gambello M.J. Wynshaw-Boris A. Tsai L.H. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 767-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 15Shu T. Ayala R. Nguyen M.D. Xie Z. Gleeson J.G. Tsai L.H. Neuron. 2004; 44: 263-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that mammalian NudC forms a biochemical complex with LIS1 in extracts from both mouse brain and HeLa cells (34Morris S.M. Albrecht U. Reiner O. Eichele G. Yu-Lee L.Y. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 603-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Here, our data confirmed the association of NudC with LIS1 in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 2, A and B). Both of N and C termini of NudC contributed to the interaction between NudC and LIS1 (Fig. 2, A and B). Overexpression of NudC-L279P effectively inhibited the association of NudC with LIS1 in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 2, C and D), suggesting that Leu279 of human NudC is important for its interaction with LIS1, which may contribute to the instability of LIS1. To elucidate the underlying mechanism for the regulation of LIS1 by NudC, we investigated the NudC-interacting proteins in HeLa cells. We performed mass spectrometry analysis of proteins co-purified with NudC immunoprecipitation. The data indicated that NudC appeared to be associated with ∼130 different proteins involved in various cellular processes, such as signal transduction, trafficking, chaperones, cytoskeleton, protein biosynthesis, nucleic acid binding, metabolic enzymes, and proteolysis (supplemental Table S1 and Fig. S1), implying NudC may have diverse functions in mammals. Because NudC contains a conserved p23 domain, the key domain for Hsp90 co-chaperone p23 to regulate its chaperone function (27Catlett M.G. Kaplan K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33739-33748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 35McLaughlin S.H. Sobott F. Yao Z.P. Zhang W. Nielsen P.R. Grossmann J.G. Laue E.D. Robinson C.V.

Proteome Res. 2007; 6: 1963-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and our data indicated that Hsp90 might be a NudC-interacting protein (supplemental Table S1); therefore, we determined to examine whether NudC was associated with Hsp90. GST pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that NudC indeed bound to Hsp90 (Fig. 3, A and B). Both of N and C termini of NudC appeared to involve in its interaction with Hsp90 and deletion of the C terminus-containing p23 domain led to total dissociation of Hsp90 from NudC. To determine whether the p23 domain is required for the association of NudC and Hsp90, we constructed the vector of FLAG-NudC-Δp23 that lacks the p23 domain and transfected it into HeLa cells. Immunoprecipitaion data showed that NudC-Δp23 failed to bind to Hsp90 (supplemental Fig. S2), suggesting that the p23 domain may be required for the interaction between NudC and Hsp90. Nonetheless, the L279P mutation of NudC failed to affect its association with Hsp90 (Fig. 3, A and B). As NudC interacts with both Hsp90 and LIS1, we investigated the direct association of Hsp90 with LIS1. GST pulldown assay and co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that LIS1 bound to Hsp90 (Fig. 3, C and D). Further data revealed that endogenous LIS1 was able to bind to endogenous NudC and Hsp90 in vivo (Fig. 3E), suggesting that LIS1 forms a biochemical complex with Hsp90 and NudC. However, The L279P mutation of NudC appeared to have no significant effect on the interaction between Hsp90 and LIS1 (Fig. 3F). Because LIS1 interacts with both Hsp90 and NudC, we determined whether Hsp90 function influences the regulation of LIS1. We employed two Hsp90 inhibitors, geldanamycin and radicicol, which block the Hsp90 ATP-driven chaperone cycle and leads to proteasomal degradation of Hsp90 client proteins (37Kamal A. Boehm M.F. Burrows F.J. Trends Mol. Med. 2004; 10: 283-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 38Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 271-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). The results showed that inhibition of Hsp90 chaperone function by either geldanamycin or radicicol induced LIS1 instability in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 4, A–D), suggesting that Hsp90 may be involved in LIS1 stability. Because both Hsp90 inhibition and the L279P mutation of NudC led to LIS1 instability, we attempted to discover whether Hsp90 influences LIS1 reduction induced by the NudC L279P mutation. The data showed that ectopic expression of Hsp90 partially reversed the protein levels of LIS1 in cells overexpressing NudC-L279P (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5), indicating that Hsp90 may play a role in the regulation of LIS1 by NudC. The chaperone activity of Hsp90 has been reported to be usually regulated by its co-chaperones (27Catlett M.G. Kaplan K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33739-33748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 38Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 2008; 283: 18473-18477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The co-chaperone p23 plays a critical role in the Hsp90 chaperone cycle to stabilize the client protein-Hsp90 complex (40Morishima Y. Kanelakis K.C. Murphy P.J. Lowe E.R. Jenkins G.J. Osawa Y. Sunahara R.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48754-48763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that p23 is capable of inhibiting the ATPase activity of Hsp90 in vitro (35McLaughlin S.H. Sobott F. Yao Z.P. Zhang W. Nielsen P.R. Grossmann J.G. Laue E.D. Robinson C.V. Jackson S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 746-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Because NudC not only interacts with Hsp90 but also contains a p23 domain, we sought to examine whether NudC influences Hsp90 ATPase activity. Recombinant His-tagged NudC, NudC-L279P, p23, and Hsp90 proteins generated from bacteria were affinity-purified, respectively (Fig. 6A). The in vitro Hsp90 ATPase assays demonstrated that NudC effectively inhibited the ATPase activity of Hsp90 (p < 0.01, Fig. 6B). Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of NudC-L279P on Hsp90 ATPase activity is significantly weaker than that of wild-type NudC (p < 0.05, Fig. 6B). Furthermore, NudC and NudC-L279P exhibited the similar effects on the in vitro ATPase activities of eukaryotic Hsp90 purified from insect cells (supplemental Fig. S3). Many of the Hsp90 co-chaperones have been found to have their own in vitro ATP-independent chaperone activity (41Weikl T. Abelmann K. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 42Okada M. Hatakeyama T. Itoh H. Tokuta N. Tokumitsu H. Kobayashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4221-4233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recently, NUD-1, the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of NudC, has been reported to posses in vitro chaperone activity (33Faircloth L.M. Churchill P.F. Caldwell G.A. Caldwell K.A. Cell. Stress Chaperones. 2009; 14: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether NudC itself also has an ATP-independent chaperone activity. The data revealed that NudC inhibits the heat-induced aggregation of citrate synthase nearly as efficiently as the Hsp90 chaperone, which was significantly inhibited by the mutation of L279P in NudC (Fig. 7), suggesting that Leu279 is indispensable for the chaperone activity of NudC. In the present study, we provide evidence that mutation of L279P in mammalian NudC leads to instability of LIS1 that forms a complex with NudC and Hsp90. Inhibition of Hsp90 chaperone function reduces LIS1 level. Ectopic expression of Hsp90 partially counteracts LIS1 reduction caused by NudC-L279P mutation. Furthermore, NudC effectively inhibits Hsp90 ATPase activity in vitro, which is suppressed by the mutation of L279P. NudC itself has an ATP-independent chaperone function, which was also repressed by the L279P mutation. Thus, these results indicate that NudC may be involved in the regulation of LIS1 by Hsp90. The molecular chaperone Hsp90 is required for conformational regulation of a variety of client proteins, many of which are involved in cell signaling, such as protein kinases and transcription factors, including steroid hormone receptors (40Morishima Y.

Hsp90-dependent folding and activation of client proteins needs a range of accessory factors, or co-chaperones that assist Hsp90 either in client recognition or in the transition of client to its final active state (32McLaughlin S.H.

Nature. 2006; 440: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). In general, Hsp90 co-chaperones are found frequently to modulate Hsp90 ATPase activity (44Picard D. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 2002; 59: 1640-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 48Caplan A.J. Cell. Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Here, our data clearly showed that NudC not only interacted with Hsp90 but also influenced the in vitro ATPase activity of Hsp90, which is consistent with the role of the co-chaperone p23 in the regulation of Hsp90 (35McLaughlin S.H. Sobott F. Yao Z.P. Zhang W. Nielsen P.R. Grossmann J.G. Laue E.D. Robinson C.V. Jackson S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 746-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Thus, these results suggest that NudC may function as a potential Hsp90 co-chaperone. In A. nidulans, the nudC3 mutation greatly decreases the concentration of NudF protein at nonpermissive temperature, which can be rescued by extra copies of nudF gene, suggesting that NudC may be involved in the regulation of NudF (25Chiu Y.H. Morris N.R. Genetics. 1995; 141: 453-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, overexpression of the NudC-L279P mutant that mimics nudC3 mutation led to significant degradation of LIS1, which was reversed by ectopic expression of Hsp90. Inhibition of Hsp90 function by either geldanamycin or radicicol also induced the instability of LIS1, an Hsp90-interacting protein, implying LIS1 may be an Hsp90 client protein. Moreover, the L279P mutation of NudC impaired its binding to LIS1 and its inhibition of Hsp90 ATPase activity. Taken together with the fact that LIS1, Hsp90, and NudC were able to form a biochemical complex, these data indicate that LIS1 may be regulated by NudC via Hsp90 chaperone. Further studies clearly will be needed to explore the underlying molecular details in this complex. Some proteins containing p23 domains have been shown to exhibit ATP-independent in vitro chaperone activity (49Freeman B.C. Toft D.O. Morimoto R.I. Science. 1996; 274: 1718-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). For example, p23 can bind to partially folded proteins, prevent their aggregation, and assist their folding (49Freeman B.C. Toft D.O. Morimoto R.I. Science. 1996; 274: 1718-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 50Bose S. Weikl T. Bügl H. Buchner J.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The p23 domain-containing protein Sgt1 suppresses the thermal aggregation process of citrate synthase as efficiently as p23 protein (52Zabka M. Leśniak W. Prus W. Kuźnicki J. Filipek A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 370: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). NUD-1, a C. elegans ortholog of mammalian NudC, also possesses such chaperone activity (33Faircloth L.M. Churchill P.F. Caldwell G.A. Caldwell K.A. Cell. Stress Chaperones. 2009; 14: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a plant NudC homolog Bobber1 that regulates Arabidopsis development and thermotolerance as a potential small heat shock protein appears to prevent thermal aggregation of malate dehydrogenase in vitro (53Jurkuta R.J. Kaplinsky N.J. Spindel J.E. Barton M.K. Plant Cell. 2009; 21: 1957-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 54Perez D.E. Hoyer J.S. Johnson A.I. Moody Z.R. Lopez J. Kaplinsky N.J. Plant Physiol. 2009; 151: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Here, our results revealed that NudC significantly inhibited the heat-induced aggregation of citrate synthase, indicating that NudC may have an ATP-independent protein chaperone activity, similar to p23 and other p23 domain-containing proteins (54Perez D.E. Hoyer J.S. Johnson A.I. Moody Z.R. Lopez J. Kaplinsky N.J. Plant Physiol. 2009; 151: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 55Felts S.J. Toft D.O. Cell. Stress Chaperones. 2003; 8: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). NudC has been reported to play a role in mitosis and cytokinesis in various organisms from fungus to human (56Riera J. Lazo P.S. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 2009; 66: 2383-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Deletion of Aspergillus NudC affects the composition and morphology of the cell wall and is lethal (57Chiu Y.H. Xiang X. Dawe A.L. Morris N.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1735-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In C. elegans, silencing of nud-1 leads to a loss of midzone microtubules and the rapid regression of the cleavage furrow (58Aumais J.P. Williams S.N. Luo W. Nishino M. Caldwell K.A. Caldwell G.A. Lin S.H. Yu-Lee L.Y. J. Cell. Sci. 2003; 116: 1991-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We and others (28Zhou T. Aumais J.P. Liu X. Yu-Lee L.Y. Erikson R.L. Dev.

Recently, mammalian NudC has been found to play an essential role in the anterograde transport of cytoplasmic dynein and dynactin by kinesin-1 (59Yamada M. Toba S. Takitoh T. Yoshida Y. Mori D. Nakamura T. Iwane A.H. Yanagida T. Imai H. Yu-Lee L.Y. Schroer T. Wynshaw-Boris A. Hirotsune S. EMBO J. 2009; 29: 517-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These data suggest that NudC may have multiple functions. Our mass spectrometry-based analysis of NudC-interacting proteins indicates that NudC associates with a number of proteins that participate in various biological processes, such as signal transduction, protein folding, nucleic acid binding, protein biosynthesis, metabolism, and other cellular processes. Some of them, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3 and protein arginine methyltransferase 5, have been found to be Hsp90-interacting proteins (60Fang S. Fu J. Yuan X. Han C. Shi L. Xin Y. Luo L. Yin Z. Cell. Immunol. 2009; 259: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 61Maloney A. Clarke P.A. Naaby-Hansen S. Stein R. Koopman J.O. Akpan A. Yang A. Zvelebil M.

https://openalex.org/W2002976705,"Neurons of the mammalian nervous system express the proton-sensing ion channel ASIC1. Low concentrations of protons in the normal range of extracellular pH, pH 7.4–7.3, shut the pore by a conformational transition referred as steady-state desensitization. Therefore, the potential of local acidification to open ASIC1 relies on proton affinity for desensitization. This property is important physiologically and also can be exploited to develop strategies to increase or decrease the channel response to protons. In a previous study (Li, T., Yang, Y., and Canessa, C. M. (2010) J. Biol. Chem. 285, 22706–22712), we found that Leu-85 in the β1-β2 linker of the extracellular domain decreases the apparent proton affinity for steady-state desensitization and retards openings, slowing down the time course of the macroscopic currents. Here, we show that Asn-415 in the β11-β12 linker works together with the β1-β2 linker to stabilize a closed conformation that delays transition from the closed to the desensitized state. Substitutions of Asn-415 for Cys, Ser, or Gly render ASIC1 responsive to small increases in proton concentrations near the baseline physiological pH.

Substitutions of Asn-415 for Cys, Ser, or Gly render ASIC1 responsive to small increases in proton concentrations near the baseline physiological pH. ASIC1 is a cation channel activated by external protons (1Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar) expressed in neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems of all vertebrates (2Krishtal O.A. Pidoplichko V.I. Neuroscience. 1980; 5: 2325-2327Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). ASIC1 has been implicated in modulation of synaptic activity (3Wemmie J.A. Chen J. Askwith C.C. Hruska-Hageman A.M. Price M.P. Nolan B.C. Yoder P.G. Lamani E. Hoshi T. Freeman Jr., J.H. Welsh M.J. Neuron. 2002; 34: 463-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) and in worsening neuronal damage induced by brain ischemia (4Xiong Z.G. Zhu X.M. Chu X.P. Minami M.

The response of ASIC1 to protons is complex. Fast and large increases of proton concentrations induce currents that decay in the continuous presence of protons, a process referred to as desensitization. In addition, low concentrations of protons, below the levels required for activation, inhibit ASIC1 by steady-state desensitization. In a recent study, we showed that the substitution M85L in the β1-β2 linker of the extracellular domain slows the time course of the macroscopic currents and decreases the apparent proton affinity for steady-state desensitization (5Li T. Yang Y. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 22706-22712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These effects result from stabilization of a closed conformation by Leu-85 that retards transition from the closed to desensitized state and also delays openings. As a consequence, ASIC1 with Leu-85, such as mammalian and avian channels, exhibits less sensitivity to steady-state desensitization and has currents with a slower time course than channels with Met-85, such as ASIC1 from sharks, fish, and frogs. A question not addressed in the previous work (5Li T. Yang Y. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 22706-22712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was whether the functional effects arising from the substitution M85L were due to changes in the conformation of the β1-β2 backbone or to interaction of the side chain with a neighboring residue. The crystal structure of chicken ASIC1 (6Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 7Gonzales E.B. Kawate T. Gouaux E. Nature. 2009; 460: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) shows Asn-415, the last residue in the β11-β12 linker, as the closest residue with the nitrogen from the amide group of Asn-415 ∼3 Å away from Leu-85. Of note, the two linkers are part of similar structures that connect the transmembrane segments to the extracellular domain in a linear arrangement of the TM1, 3The abbreviations used are: TMtransmembrane domainMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidMTSEAaminoethyl-methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide. β1-strand, and β1-β2 linker and the TM2, β12-strand, and β11-β12 linker (see Fig. 1). transmembrane domain 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid aminoethyl-methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide. Here, we examined whether Asn-415 plays a role in defining the properties of rat and frog ASIC1 channels. The findings indicate that changing residue Asn-415 decreases proton affinity of steady-state desensitization and slows the decay of the currents. These effects, however, are additive to those produced by Leu-85 consistent with the β1-β2 and β11-β12 linkers contributing independently in the stabilization of a closed conformation of ASIC1. Point mutations were introduced into cDNAs of Xenopus ASIC1.1-V5 in pcDNA3.1 and rat ASIC1a in pCR2.1 using QuikChange (Agilent). All products were sequenced to confirm the presence of the mutations. cDNAs were transcribed in vitro using the T7 mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion). Each Xenopus laevis oocyte was injected with 5 ng of cRNA in a volume of 50 nl. Electrophysiological studies were made 2–3 days after injection. Xenopus oocytes were prepared by standard procedures (8Fyfe G.K. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) from frog ovaries purchased from Nasco. Fifteen oocytes per condition were biotinylated with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) on ice. After lysis of cells with 1% Triton X-100 and centrifugation at 8,000 × g for removal of the yolk, biotinylated proteins were recovered with streptavidin beads (Pierce). The beads were washed with 1% Triton X-100 and 300 mm NaCl. Biotinylated proteins were eluted from beads, resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membranes (Immobilon). xASIC1.1 was detected with anti-V5 monoclonal (Invitrogen) and rASIC1a with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the carboxyl terminus raised previously by our group (9Alvarez de la Rosa D. Zhang P. Shao D. White F. Canessa C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 2326-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Signals were developed with ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to BioMax MR film (Eastman Kodak). Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings of oocytes were done using the Clamp OC-725B amplifier (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT). Data were digitized at a sampling rate of 2 kHz (PowerLab 4/30, ADInstruments). Oocytes were placed in a recording chamber (400 μl) perfused by gravity at a rate of 4 ml/min and impaled with two glass microelectrodes filled with 3 m KCl with a resistance <1 megohm. Composition of the standard bath solution was as follows: 120 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 15 mm HEPES-MES. The pH was adjusted to obtain a series of solutions differing by 0.1 pH units from pH 7.8 to 6.5. The same set of solutions was used in all experiments to minimize variations owing to the calibration of pH. All experiments were conducted at room temperature. Apparent proton affinities were calculated with Equation 1.I=1/(1+(EC50/[H+])n)(Eq. 1) Time constants for the rise and decay phases were obtained by fitting the time course of currents to the Equation 2,I(t)=1o[exp(t/τd)−exp(t/τa)(Eq. 2) where Io is a scaling factor. Aminoethyl-methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide (MTSEA) (Anatrace) was diluted to 2.5 mm in bath solution, and the pH was adjusted to the desired value. MTSEA was replaced with a freshly prepared solution every 10 min. Time constants for modification (τ) were obtained by fitting the data points with a single exponential function, and apparent modification rates (R) were calculated according to Equation 3,R=1/τ(M)(Eq. 3) where [M] is the concentration of MTSEA. Patch clamp recordings were conducted in the outside-out configuration. Patch pipettes were pulled from PG150T glass (Warner Instruments) to a tip diameter of 2–4 μm after heat polishing. The pipette solution consisted of the following: 120 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES titrated with KOH to pH 7.4. Bath and activating solutions were the same as in two-electrode voltage clamp experiments. Activating solutions were applied using a modified Perfusion Fast Step device SF-77B (Warner Instruments) onto which eight perfusion pipettes were mounted. The data acquisition program Pulse, in turn, controlled the SF-77B. Time resolution of the solution exchange device is 0.5 ms as described previously (10Yang Y. Yan Y. Sigworth F.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 124: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Recordings were made using an EPC-9 amplifier and the Pulse acquisition program (HEKA Electronic). Membrane potential was held at −60 mV. Experiments were conducted at room temperature. We followed the approach as described previously (11Zhang P. Sigworth F.J. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, an idealization was first made from patches containing fewer than three channels opening simultaneously to obtain the number n(t) of channels open as a function of time. The number nc of closing steps in the sweep was also counted. An estimate of the mean open time was obtained as in Equation 4,t0=1nc∫0Tn(t)dt(Eq. 4) where no channels are open at time 0, and the limit T of integration is a time near the end of a sweep where no channels are open. Asn-415 is a highly conserved residue among the ASICs, only the non-proton-activated mammalian ASIC4 has Thr in this position. The amide group of Asn-415 is in close proximity to Leu-85 in rASIC1a or to Met-85 in xASIC1.1 (Fig. 1). To explore whether channel stabilization mediated by Leu-85 depends on interaction with Asn-415, the latter residue was substituted by Cys, Ser, Gln, Val, or Gly. The selection criteria for the substitutions were as follows. Cys was chosen to test accessibility to thiosulfonate reagents. Ser has a side chain with similar size and polarity to the one of Cys but does not react with sulfhydryl reagent. Gln is larger than Asn, but it has also an amide group. Val is hydrophobic but has a side chain of size equivalent to that of Asn. Finally, Gly only has a hydrogen atom as a side chain, reducing the possibility of interaction with residue in position 85. Fig. 2, A and B, show the average peak currents evoked by pH 6.5 in rat ASIC1a and Xenopus ASIC1.1. Bars represent the mean ± S.D. of individual oocytes from three independent experiments. Cys, Ser, and Gly induced large currents, whereas Gln and Val were no functional or produced currents of <50 nA/oocyte. Changing the intensity of the stimulus to pH 5.0 produced only a small increase of the response in the latter mutants, suggesting that a acid shift of the proton affinity may not be the underlying explanation for the small currents. Oocytes used in electrophysiological experiments were examined subsequently for membrane expression of ASIC1 proteins by Western blot analysis. No significant differences were observed in the intensity of the signals. Even if we take into account a small contamination from the intracellular pool of channels, 5–10% of the signal, this cannot explain the ∼400-fold difference in currents between functional and nearly nonfunctional constructs (Fig. 2, C and D). Rat ASIC1a and xASIC1.1 bearing the single substitution N415C exhibit currents with slower kinetics than the corresponding wild type channels. Fig. 3A compares representative examples of whole-cell currents from rASIC1a wild type (black trace) and N415C mutant (gray trace) evoked by pH 6.5, which corresponds to the pH50A of rASIC1a. Traces show a slight delay of the rising face but a 4-fold decrease in the decay rate. The same mutation introduced in xASIC1.1 also slowed the kinetics of the macroscopic currents. Fig. 3B shows channels activated by pH 6.9, which is the pH50A of the frog channel. When the mutation N415C was expressed in the background of xASIC1.1-M85L, the effect was additive to that of M85L as illustrated in Fig. 3C. To calculate the values of the rise and decay faces of the currents, we examined outside-out patches perfused with a rapid exchange solution system. As the time constants are pH dependent, we examined all mutants at pH 7.0 (Fig. 3D). Upon activation, currents from xASIC1.1 exhibited a fast rise (τa, 25 ms) and decay (τd, 80 ms) as reported previously (5Li T. Yang Y. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 22706-22712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The substitution N415C slowed the rise time constant (τa, 45 ms) but had a much larger effect on the decay (τd, 900 ms). For comparison, we also showed the effect of the substitution M85L (τa, 75 ms; τd, 500 ms). Currents of the double mutant xASIC1.1-M85L/N415C were slower (τa, 150 ms; τd, 1650 ms) than the single mutants by an additive factor. Similar results although of less magnitude were observed with the mutations N415S and N415G. The substitution N415C also shifts the apparent proton affinity of steady-state desensitization from pH50D 7.27 to 7.1 in rASIC1a and from 7.4 to 7.12 in xASIC1.1 (Fig. 4, A and C). When Cys-415 was introduced in the background of Leu-85 of xASIC1.1, the pH50D changed from 7.27 to 6.92. Because the apparent affinity for activation was changed slightly (Fig. 4, B and D), the steady-state desensitization and activation curves overlapped (Fig. 4E), generating a range of pH wherein currents from the double mutant xASIC1.1 increased stepwise upon consecutive increments in the external proton concentration (pH range 7.0 to 6.8) (Fig. 4F). Substitutions of Asn-415 by other amino acids in xASIC1.1 such as Gly also displaced the pH50D toward a more acidic range. As illustrated by double mutant cycles (12Carter P.J. Winter G. Wilkinson A.J. Fersht A.R. Cell. 1984; 38: 835-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) shown in Fig. 4G, changes in pH50D were additive when introduced in the Met-85 (wild type) or Leu-85 background. Values corresponding to pH50D are in parentheses below each single and double mutant. The coupling coefficient, Ω, defined as EC50(WT:WT) × EC50(mut:mut)/EC50(WT:mut) × EC50(mut:WT) (13Hidalgo P. MacKinnon R. Science. 1995; 268: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), gave values close to unity, indicating that the mutated residues are independent of one another. To gain insight on the underlying mechanism of the substitution N415C, we examined patches activated by low concentrations of protons, pH 7.2 to 7.0, to have fewer than three open channels in the patch. The protocol consisted first in estimating the number of total channels in the patch by activation with pH 6.8. Most patches responded by generating ∼2-nA peak currents, which correspond approximately to 1000 channels (amplitude of unitary currents is 2.2 pA at −60 mV membrane potential and 120 mm outside Na+). Patches were returned to pH 7.8 for 4 s and reactivated by pH 7.0, 7.1, and 7.2. The pH that opened fewer than three channels was then used in up to 20 sweeps of a 20-s duration. A representative example is shown in Fig. 5. Channel activity was observed for many tens of seconds at pH 7.2. These records were used for analysis of the mean open time (τo) applying Equation 4. The estimated τo according to this method was 6.4 ± 0.5 ms, which is not significantly different from that of wild type xASIC1.1 (6.8 ± 0.3 ms) (5Li T. Yang Y. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 22706-22712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), indicating that the slow decay of the currents cannot be attributed to lengthening of the mean open time. At low proton concentrations such as pH 7.2, the probability of a channel opening is low; thus, only one to three channels of ∼1000 present in the patch are open at any time during the long stimulus >20 s. Eventually, activity ceases after all channels in the patch have opened and have entered the desensitized state. (The mutation N415C does not prevent desensitization from the open state.) By contrast, the activity of wild type xASIC1.1 is short and of small magnitude, because at pH 7.2, most of the channels in the patch are desensitized, and the ones that are not also have low probability of opening. For comparison, the bottom trace activated by pH 7.2 in Fig. 5 is from xASIC1.1 wild type. It shows a low level of channel activity and declines rapidly over time. To examine exposure to solvent of Cys-85 and Cys-415 and whether it changes in the closed and desensitized conformations, we treated xASIC1.1 bearing single Cys substitutions with MTSEA added to the bath. Because the proton affinity for steady-state desensitization differs in the two Cys mutants, MTSEA was applied to xASIC1.1-C85 (pH50D, 7.4) at pH 7.6 (closed channels) or 7.3 (desensitized channels) whereas xASIC1.1-C415 (pH50D, 7.1) received MTSEA at pH 7.4 and 7.0. The protocol consisted of a 5-s perfusion with MTSEA at the desired pH, a 10-s wash with solution of pH 7.6, followed by channel activation. Recovery from desensitization was complete with a 10-s application of pH 7.6 (see supplemental figure). Fig. 6, A and B, illustrate almost complete inhibition of xASIC1.1-C85 currents by MTSEA applied to closed and desensitized channels (modification rate, 100 m−1 s−1). Of notice, xASIC1.1-C85 currents exhibit faster kinetics than those of wild type channels (5Li T. Yang Y. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 22706-22712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Time course of the cumulative effect is shown in Fig. 6C. Currents from xASIC1.1-C415 were not inhibited by MTSEA but instead the reagent augmented the effects of the substitution N415C. Fig. 7 shows the effect of MTSEA in a cell before and after application of MTSEA at pH 7.4 for 30 s. Affinities of protons for activation (Fig. 7A) and desensitization (Fig. 7B) decreased shifting the pH50A and pH50D to a more acidic range; the new values were 6.8 and 7.0, respectively (Fig. 7C). The reaction with MTSEA also significantly slowed down the time course of the currents as illustrated by the traces in Fig. 6A before and after MTSEA. Effects of the reagent were comparable when applied at pH 7.4 or 7.0, and the time course of the reactions was also similar for the two conditions: modification rates 63 and 46 m−1 s−1 (Fig. 7D). In these experiments, the parameter for estimating modification rates was the change in peak current evoked by pH 7.0. Thus, properties of the residue in position 415 translate into a broad range of stabilization of the closed conformation from very little stabilization leading to ready desensitization and no currents as shown in Fig. 2, to significant stabilization and resistance proton-induced desensitization. Currents from wild type xASIC1.1 treated under identical conditions did not change as expected from the absence of endogenous free Cys. All 14 Cys in the extracellular domain are engaged in the formation of disulfide bridges and are very resistant to treatment with extracellular reducing agents. The findings of this work indicate that the residue in position 415 in the β11-β12 linker changes the apparent proton affinity and the time course of ASIC1 currents. These effects are akin to those produced by Leu-85 in the β1-β2 linker implying a common underlying mechanism, i.e. stabilization of a closed conformation (5Li T. Yang Y. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 22706-22712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). But as the effects of amino acid 415 were found to be additive to those of amino acid 85, the interpretation of interaction owing to proximity is not favored. Rather, each linker independently contributes to stabilization of a closed conformation. Independent contribution of the linkers conforms with the notion that structural changes initiated in the extracellular domain by proton binding are transmitted by the β1- and β12-strands to TM1 and TM2. Indeed, recent evidence supports participation of both transmembrane segments in opening and closing the pore (14Salinas M. Lazdunski M. Lingueglia E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 31851-33189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15Passero C.J. Okumura S. Carattino M.D. J. Biol.

Cell Physiol. 2010; 299: C66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The possibility of conformational changes of the linkers was explored by MTSEA modification of Cys introduced in positions 85 and 415. The two residues are exposed to solvent, but the rates of modification are much slower (apparent R, 100 m−1 s−1 and ∼50 m−1 s−1) than the rate predicted from free Cys in solution (R, ∼25,000 m−1 s−1) as calculated for MTSEA reacting with free mercaptoethanol (17Stauffer D.A. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6840-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). It indicates that the residues are partially buried in the protein; indeed, the side chain of residue 85 points to the interior of the protein, and the one of 415 is even more distant from the surface of the protein than residue 85 (Fig. 1). However, similar values of the apparent modification rate constants in the close and desensitized states do not prove rearrangements of the linkers but also do not rule it out because the closed and desensitized conformations may both be exposed to solvent. Such a result only indicates that state-specific conformations of the linkers cannot be detected by this approach. On a more practical note, understanding the molecular bases of steady-state desensitization is important because it provides the means to develop drugs that promote or prevent channel opening. Example of the former type have not been yet developed, but, as our findings indicate, it will be possible to open ASIC1 with very low concentrations of protons (Fig. 4F). Example of the latter type is the tarantula toxin Psalmotoxin 1 (PcTx1) that is the only high affinity (EC50 ∼ 1 nm) and ASIC1-specific inhibitor (18Escoubas P. De Weille J.R. Lecoq A. Diochot S.

PcTx1 increases the apparent proton affinity leading to desensitization and therefore inhibition of channels at pH ≥ 7.4 (19Chen X. Kalbacher H. Gründer S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Mapping of ASIC1-toxin interactions (20Salinas M. Rash L.D. Baron A. Lambeau G. Escoubas P. Lazdunski M. J. Physiol. 2006; 570: 339-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and molecular dynamics simulations (21Pietra F. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2009; 49: 972-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) have identified α1 and α5 in the thumb domain of one subunit, and β3 from the adjacent subunit as potential contact sites. Taken together, results from this work and a recently published paper (5Li T. Yang Y. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 22706-22712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) indicate that the amino acid composition of the linkers, specifically positions 85 and 415, markedly influence the stability of the closed conformation. Certain residues stabilize the close conformation (i.e. Leu-85 and Cys-415), whereas others favor the transition to the desensitized state. “Stiff' linkers prevent or slow transitions, whereas “floppy” linkers lead to rapid desensitization. From a mechanistic point of view, we speculate that the linkers work like joints that twist or move up and down the β1- and β12-strands, whereby they convey conformational changes started by the binding of protons in the extracellular domain to the pore in the transmembrane segments. When thinking of conformational changes, one usually seeks to associate movement to that part of the molecule. In this instance, the methods of cysteine accessibility and modification by MTSEA did not provide conclusive evidence but also did not rule out the possibility of a conformational change. The results also suggest that the small and accessible site defined by the β1-β2 and β11-β12 linkers is a potential target for modulation of channel activity by new drugs or small molecules.

Herein, we identified CRTC2 as a Pin1-binding protein by overexpressing Pin1 with Myc and FLAG tags in mouse livers and subsequent purification of the complex containing Pin1. The association between Pin1 and CRTC2 was observed not only in overexpression experiments but also endogenously in the mouse liver. Interestingly, Ser136 in the nuclear localization signal of CRTC2 was shown to be involved in the association with Pin1. Pin1 overexpression in HepG2 cells attenuated forskolin-induced nuclear localization of CRTC2 and cAMP-responsive element (CRE) transcriptional activity, whereas gene knockdown of Pin1 by siRNA enhanced both. Pin1 also associated with CRTC1, leading to their cytosol localization, essentially similar to the action of CRTC2. Furthermore, it was shown that CRTC2 associated with Pin1 did not bind to CREB. Taken together, these observations indicate the association of Pin1 with CRTC2 to decrease the nuclear CBP·CRTC·CREB complex.

To date, many reports have supported an important role for Pin1 in diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer disease (4Takahashi K. Uchida C. Shin R.W. Shimazaki K. Uchida T. Cell Mol.

In this study, we demonstrated that Pin1 is also involved in metabolic disease via regulation of CRTC2 (CREB-regulated transcriptional co-activator 2; also known as TORC).The cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB) stimulates transcriptional activity through recruitment of the histone acetylase CBP and through an association with CRTC, leading to formation of the CREB·CBP·CTRC complex on a CRE site (8Bittinger M.A. McWhinnie E.

Thus, multiple molecular mechanisms affect the CREB·CBP·CTRC complex, resulting in the regulation of CRE transcriptional activity. They include the phosphorylations of CREB at Ser133, CBP at Ser436, and CRTC2 at Ser171 (16Screaton R.A. Conkright M.D. Katoh Y. Best J.L. Canettieri G. Jeffries S. Guzman E. Niessen S.

The phosphorylation of CRTC2 at Ser171 reportedly leads to an association with 14-3-3 protein and thereby to its nuclear exclusion and degradation (16Screaton R.A. Conkright M.D. Katoh Y. Best J.L.

Handschin C. Feng Y. Gullicksen P.S. Bare O. Labow M. Spiegelman B. Stevenson S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 14379-14384Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In the liver, insulin induces the phosphorylation of CRTC2 at Ser171, and this phosphorylation leads to the aforementioned association with 14-3-3 protein and the nuclear exclusion and degradation of CRTC2 (16Screaton R.A. Conkright M.D. Katoh Y. Best J.L. Canettieri G. Jeffries S. Guzman E. Niessen S. Yates 3rd, J.R. Takemori H. Okamoto M. Montminy M.

Nature. 2007; 449: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In contrast, glucagon induces dephosphorylation of CRTC2 and translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus, thereby forming the CREB·CBP·CRTC2 complex and inducing gluconeogenesis (21Koo S.H. Flechner L. Qi L. Zhang X. Screaton R.A. Jeffries S. Hedrick S. Xu W. Boussouar F. Brindle P. Takemori H. Montminy M. Nature. 2005; 437: 1109-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Thus, CRTC2 plays important roles in hepatic glucose metabolism.In this study, we identified CRTC2 as a Pin1-binding protein. Interestingly, the portion of CRTC2 responsible for the association with Pin1 was revealed to be in the nuclear localization signal (NLS) domain. Herein, we demonstrate that Pin1 regulates the functions and subcellular localizations of CRTC family proteins, thereby altering CRE transcriptional activity.DISCUSSIONCRE transcriptional activity is enhanced through association of the CREB·CBP·CRTC complex on a CRE site. The co-activator of CREB termed the CRTC family consists of three isoforms, CRTC1, CRTC2, and CRTC3 (18Iourgenko V. Zhang W. Mickanin C. Daly I. Jiang C. Hexham J.M. Orth A.P. Miraglia L. Meltzer J. Garza D. Chirn G.W. McWhinnie E. Cohen D. Skelton J. Terry R. Yu Y. Bodian D. Buxton F.P. Zhu J. Song C. Labow M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 12147-12152Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). CRTC2 was reported to be important for the regulation of CRE transcriptional activity and its downstream PEPCK gene expression (20Dentin R. Liu Y. Koo S.H. Hedrick S. Vargas T. Heredia J. Yates 3rd, J. Montminy M. Nature. 2007; 449: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Depletion of nuclear CRTC2 leads to the suppression of CRE transcriptional activity (20Dentin R. Liu Y. Koo S.H. Hedrick S. Vargas T. Heredia J. Yates 3rd, J. Montminy M. Nature. 2007; 449: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Thus, both the subcellular localization of CRTC2 and CREB·CBP·CRTC complex formation are critical for CRE transcriptional activity. CRTC2 is reportedly phosphorylated by AMPK and SIK, and phosphorylated CRTC2 binds to 14-3-3 protein and is thereby shifted from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (21Koo S.H. Flechner L. Qi L. Zhang X. Screaton R.A. Jeffries S. Hedrick S. Xu W. Boussouar F. Brindle P. Takemori H. Montminy M. Nature. 2005; 437: 1109-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). The Montiminy group (16Screaton R.A. Conkright M.D. Katoh Y. Best J.L. Canettieri G. Jeffries S. Guzman E. Niessen S. Yates 3rd, J.R. Takemori H. Okamoto M. Montminy M. Cell. 2004; 119: 61-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) has identified 12 independent phosphorylated serine residues on CRTC2 using tandem MS analysis. They demonstrated that PKA inhibits the activity of SIK and reduces Ser171 phosphorylation leading to binding with 14-3-3 protein and translocation to the cytosol (16Screaton R.A. Conkright M.D. Katoh Y. Best J.L. Canettieri G. Jeffries S. Guzman E. Niessen S. Yates 3rd, J.R. Takemori H. Okamoto M. Montminy M. Cell. 2004; 119: 61-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). However, the importance of other phosphorylation sites identified in their study, such as Ser136 remains unknown.In this study, it was demonstrated that Pin1 associates with the CRTC family of proteins consisting of CRTC1 and CRTC2. Because the portion of CRTC1 and CRTC2 responsible for the association with Pin1 is in the NLS domain, we considered the possibility that the binding of Pin1 to this portion would interrupt NLS function, resulting in their export from the nucleus. In fact, our observations using GFP-tagged CRTC1 and CRTC2 as well as staining of endogenous CRTC2 supported our hypothesis. On the other hand, gene silencing of Pin1 using siRNA markedly induced nuclear localization of CRTC2 when stimulated with forskolin. It is likely that altered localization of CTRC2 due to Pin1 takes place independently of the binding of 14-3-3 protein to CRTC2 because Pin1 overexpression affected neither the Ser171 phosphorylation level of CRTC2 nor the association with 14-3-3.A further interesting issue is that CRTC2 associated with Pin1 did not bind to CREB. This phenomenon cannot be attributable to the different subcellular distributions of CREB, CBP, and CRTC because highly overexpressed CREB, CBP, and CRTC2 are present in the cytosol of Sf9 cells. Taken together, these observations indicate the association of Pin1 with CRTC2 to decrease the nuclear CBP·CRTC2·CREB complex via two mechanisms (i.e. the export of CRTC2 and interruption of the association between CRTC2 and CREB). Thus, the Pin1 expression level is a key factor regulating CRE transcriptional activity.We investigated the effects of various kinase inhibitors on the association between CRTC2 and Pin1, using HepG2 cells, in an effort to identify the kinase that is involved in the phosphorylation of S136A on CRTC2. However, we were unable to obtain clear results. Although we did not discover which kinase(s) phosphorylates the Ser136 of CRTC2 responsible for the association with Pin1 in this study, high basal phosphorylation of Ser136 was already demonstrated in a previous report (16Screaton R.A. Conkright M.D. Katoh Y. Best J.L. Canettieri G. Jeffries S. Guzman E. Niessen S. Yates 3rd, J.R. Takemori H. Okamoto M. Montminy M. Cell. 2004; 119: 61-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar).Prior studies have also shown that Pin1 expression generally correlates with cell proliferative potential in normal tissues (1Lu K.P.

In addition, interestingly, we noticed that the amount of Pin1 was higher in the fed than in the fasting state, in both liver and muscle. However, neither insulin nor forskolin has any effect on the expression of Pin1 in HepG2. Thus, the mechanism(s) involved in the altered expression of Pin1 remains unclear, although this is an important issue that merits further investigation.In the liver, CRE transcriptional activity plays a critical role in gluconeogenesis (32Erion D.M.

In addition, in the diabetic state, insufficient suppression of CRE transcriptional activity is regarded as a mechanism underlying hyperglycemia under fasted conditions (35Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G. Donovan J. Wu Z. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). In the present study, our final experiment examined whether Pin1 overexpression might improve the hyperglycemia in insulin-deficient STZ-treated mice. In these mice, gluconeogenic enzymes, such as PEPCK, under the control of CRE transcriptional activity are reportedly up-regulated (20Dentin R. Liu Y. Koo S.H. Hedrick S. Vargas T. Heredia J.

The fact that Pin1 overexpression reduced the high PEPCK expression and its resultant fasting serum glucose elevation in STZ-treated mice suggests that the Pin1 expression level is involved in regulating glucose metabolism. Thus, an agent affecting Pin1 expression or activity may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for diabetes.To date, numerous proteins have been identified as substrates of Pin1 (4Takahashi K.

With the proline conformational change induced by Pin1, the structure and function of the target protein are modified, which affects protein stabilization, subcellular localization, phosphorylation, transcriptional activity, etc. In the case of CTRC2, both subcellular localization and the complex-forming function with CREB are affected.Although we did not investigate the physiological effects occurring via CRTC1 induced by the association with Pin1, we did observe that Pin1 is highly expressed in the brain, whereas its enzymatic activity is blunted by oxidative stress modification that occurs in the early stages of Alzheimer disease (39Sultana R. Boyd-Kimball D. Poon H.F. Cai J. Pierce W.M. Klein J.B. Markesbery W.R. Zhou X.Z. Lu K.P. Butterfield D.A. Neurobiol. Aging. 2006; 27: 918-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Although the physiological function of Pin1 in neurons remains largely unknown, numerous reports have implicated CRE transcriptional activity in brain function (40Bito H. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W.

Thus, further important evidence may be obtained from studies of Pin1 and CRTC1 in the brain or other tissues.In summary, CRTC2 was identified as a new Pin1-binding protein. The CBP·CRTC2·CREB complex promotes gluconeogenesis. Pin1 binding to CRTC2 prevents this complex formation, thereby suppressing CRE transcriptional activity (supplemental Fig. 8). These findings indicate that Pin1 is a regulator of gluconeogenesis and may be a new target for diabetic therapy. IntroductionPin1 was initially cloned as a NIMA kinase-interacting protein (1Lu K.P.

Pin1 interacts with a number of target proteins through recognition of phospho-Ser/Pro motifs, and the proline conformational change induced by Pin1 modifies the structures and functions, such as stabilization, phosphorylation, and translocation, of target proteins (4Takahashi K.

To date, many reports have supported an important role for Pin1 in diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer disease (4Takahashi K. Uchida C. Shin R.W. Shimazaki K. Uchida T. Cell Mol.

In this study, we demonstrated that Pin1 is also involved in metabolic disease via regulation of CRTC2 (CREB-regulated transcriptional co-activator 2; also known as TORC).The cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB) stimulates transcriptional activity through recruitment of the histone acetylase CBP and through an association with CRTC, leading to formation of the CREB·CBP·CTRC complex on a CRE site (8Bittinger M.A. McWhinnie E.

Thus, multiple molecular mechanisms affect the CREB·CBP·CTRC complex, resulting in the regulation of CRE transcriptional activity. They include the phosphorylations of CREB at Ser133, CBP at Ser436, and CRTC2 at Ser171 (16Screaton R.A. Conkright M.D. Katoh Y. Best J.L. Canettieri G. Jeffries S. Guzman E. Niessen S.

The phosphorylation of CRTC2 at Ser171 reportedly leads to an association with 14-3-3 protein and thereby to its nuclear exclusion and degradation (16Screaton R.A. Conkright M.D. Katoh Y. Best J.L.

In the liver, insulin induces the phosphorylation of CRTC2 at Ser171, and this phosphorylation leads to the aforementioned association with 14-3-3 protein and the nuclear exclusion and degradation of CRTC2 (16Screaton R.A.

In contrast, glucagon induces dephosphorylation of CRTC2 and translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus, thereby forming the CREB·CBP·CRTC2 complex and inducing gluconeogenesis (21Koo S.H. Flechner L. Qi L. Zhang X. Screaton R.A. Jeffries S. Hedrick S. Xu W. Boussouar F. Brindle P. Takemori H. Montminy M. Nature. 2005; 437: 1109-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Thus, CRTC2 plays important roles in hepatic glucose metabolism.In this study, we identified CRTC2 as a Pin1-binding protein. Interestingly, the portion of CRTC2 responsible for the association with Pin1 was revealed to be in the nuclear localization signal (NLS) domain. Herein, we demonstrate that Pin1 regulates the functions and subcellular localizations of CRTC family proteins, thereby altering CRE transcriptional activity.

We investigated the role of calcium in this response. Stretch-stimulated expression of contractile and cytoskeletal proteins in mouse portal vein was inhibited at mRNA and protein levels by blockade of voltage-dependent Ca2+ entry (VDCE). In contrast, blockade of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) did not affect smooth muscle marker expression but decreased global protein synthesis. Activation of VDCE caused membrane translocation of RhoA followed by phosphorylation of its downstream effectors LIMK-2 and cofilin-2. Stretch-activated cofilin-2 phosphorylation depended on VDCE but not on SOCE. VDCE was associated with increased mRNA expression of myocardin, myocyte enhancer factor (MEF) -2A and -2D, and smooth muscle marker genes, all of which depended on ROK activity. SOCE increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and c-Fos expression but had no effect on phosphorylation of LIMK-2 and cofilin-2 or on myocardin and MEF2 expression. Knockdown of MEF2A or -2D eliminated the VDCE-induced activation of myocardin expression and increased basal c-Jun and c-Fos mRNA levels. These results indicate that MEF2 mediates VDCE-dependent stimulation of myocardin expression via the Rho/ROK pathway. In addition, SOCE activates the expression of immediate-early genes, known to be regulated by MEF2 via Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of histone deacetylases, but this mode of Ca2+ entry does not affect the Rho/ROK pathway. Compartmentation of Ca2+ entry pathways appears as one mechanism whereby extracellular and membrane signals influence smooth muscle phenotype regulation, with MEF2 as a focal point.

https://openalex.org/W2024139218,"A prolonged activation of the immune system is one of the main causes of hyperproliferation of lymphocytes leading to defects in immune tolerance and autoimmune diseases. Fas ligand (FasL), a member of the TNF superfamily, plays a crucial role in controlling this excessive lymphoproliferation by inducing apoptosis in T cells leading to their rapid elimination. Here, we establish that posttranscriptional regulation is part of the molecular mechanisms that modulate FasL expression, and we show that in activated T cells FasL mRNA is stable. Our sequence analysis indicates that the FasL 3′-untranslated region (UTR) contains two AU-rich elements (AREs) that are similar in sequence and structure to those present in the 3′-UTR of TNFα mRNA. Through these AREs, the FasL mRNA forms a complex with the RNA-binding protein HuR both in vitro and ex vivo. Knocking down HuR in HEK 293 cells prevented the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced expression of a GFP reporter construct fused to the FasL 3′-UTR. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the posttranscriptional regulation of FasL mRNA by HuR represents a novel mechanism that could play a key role in the maintenance and proper functioning of the immune system.

Fas and Fas ligand (FasL) 3The abbreviations used are: FasLFas ligandAREAU-rich elementFADDFas-associated protein with death domainHuRhuman antigen RIPimmunoprecipitationPHAphytohemagglutinin-MPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. are a transmembrane receptor ligand pair of the TNF receptor and TNF family, primarily involved in maintaining the homeostasis of the immune system by eliminating antigen-activated lymphocytes which consequently limits the magnitude and duration of the immune response (1Strasser A. Jost P.J. Nagata S. Immunity. 2009; 30: 180-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Fas/FasL mediates this effect by triggering an apoptotic response in these cells. This response involves recruiting the adaptor protein FADD to the intracellular tail of Fas via an interaction with a death domain. In turn, the FasL·Fas·FADD complex recruits procaspases 8 and 10 via homotypic death effector domain interactions leading to caspase cleavage and apoptosis (1Strasser A. Jost P.J. Nagata S. Immunity. 2009; 30: 180-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). The importance of Fas and FasL is evidenced by the fact that defects in their expression trigger excessive lymphoproliferation resulting in loss of immune tolerance and autoimmune diseases (1Strasser A.

Fas ligand AU-rich element Fas-associated protein with death domain human antigen R immunoprecipitation phytohemagglutinin-M phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The disruption of Fas/FasL signaling pathways by spontaneous mutations in mice or in human patients has been associated with diseases such as systematic lupus erythematosus or autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (1Strasser A.

Nature. 1992; 356: 314-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2696) Google Scholar). Likewise, an increase in FasL-mediated apoptosis of normal, Fas-bearing, bystander cells causes certain immunopathologies such as hepatitis, which is linked to excessive T cell activation (1Strasser A. Jost P.J. Nagata S. Immunity. 2009; 30: 180-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Hence, a tight regulation of FasL expression during T cell activation is critical to maintain the homeostasis and the proper functioning of the immune system. During the past decade, the majority of studies have focused on delineating the molecular mechanisms that modulate FasL expression at the transcriptional level. Several factors, such as NF-AT, NF-κB, and IRF-1, have been shown to activate the transcription of the fasl gene directly (5Chow W.A. Fang J.J. Yee J.K. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3512-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 6Hsu S.C. Gavrilin M.A. Lee H.H. Wu C.C. Han S.H. Lai M.Z. Eur. J.

It is well established for other TNF family members such as TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and several interleukins, that although transcription is tightly regulated, the amount of mRNA produced does not correlate with the protein expression levels (8Beutler B. Krochin N. Milsark I.W. Luedke C. Cerami A. Science. 1986; 232: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). In many cases, although the steady-state levels of these messages remain unchanged, the protein levels increase significantly in response to extracellular stimuli (9Jacob C.O. Lee S.K. Strassmann G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3043-3050PubMed Google Scholar, 10Jacobs D.B. Mandelin 2nd, A.M. Giordano T. Xue I. Malter J.S. Singh L.D. Snyder A.K. Singh S.P. Life Sci. 1996; 58: 2083-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This increase is because the expression of these mRNAs is also regulated posttranscriptionally at the level of subcellular localization, mRNA turnover, and translational efficiency. These posttranscriptional effects are mediated mainly by AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs) of these and other messages (11Antic D. Keene J.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 183-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Barreau C. Paillard L. Osborne H.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 7138-7150Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 13Asirvatham A.J. Magner W.J. Tomasi T.B. Cytokine. 2009; 45: 58-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). AREs are known to regulate a variety of transiently expressed cytokines during T cell activation. These include IFNγ, GM-CSF, CD83, TNFα, and CD40L (14Tobler A. Miller C.W. Norman A.W. Koeffler H.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 1819-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 15Chemnitz J.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 4037-4044PubMed Google Scholar). This regulation is due to the stabilization of these messages by a mechanism that involves their association with ARE-binding proteins such as HuR (12Barreau C. Paillard L. Osborne H.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 7138-7150Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 17Sakai K. Kitagawa Y. Saiki M. Saiki S. Hirose G. Mol.

HuR belongs to the ELAV (embryonic lethal abnormal vision) family of RNA-binding proteins that contains three other members, HuB, HuC, and HuD (19Keene J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 5-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Of the four ELAV family members, only HuR is ubiquitously expressed, and it is particularly well expressed in primary and secondary lymphoid tissues such as the thymus, spleen, and the gut (20Atasoy U. Watson J. Patel D. Keene J.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3145-3156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Mukherjee N. Lager P.J. Friedersdorf M.B. Thompson M.A. Keene J.D. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2009; 5: 288Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that in a tissue-specific knock-out mice, disrupting the hur gene in T lymphocytes causes a severe defect in their maturation (22Papadaki O. Milatos S. Grammenoudi S. Mukherjee N. Keene J.D. Kontoyiannis D.L. J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 6779-6788Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Indeed, although these mice have a wild type thymic microenvironment, the HuR−/− thymocytes of these mice are unable to undergo positive selection, negative selection, and thymic egress (22Papadaki O. Milatos S. Grammenoudi S. Mukherjee N. Keene J.D. Kontoyiannis D.L. J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 6779-6788Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The defect in positive selection is attributed to an alteration in the T cell receptor signaling pathway. Likewise, the defect in thymic egress can be explained by defects in chemokine signaling required in this process such as the TNF receptor family members including Fas (22Papadaki O. Milatos S. Grammenoudi S. Mukherjee N. Keene J.D. Kontoyiannis D.L. J. Immunol. 2009; 182: 6779-6788Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The observations described above and the fact that FasL belongs to the TNFα family of cytokines raised the possibility that the expression of FasL could depend on posttranscriptional events involving ARE-binding proteins such as HuR. In this study we addressed this question and showed that the 3′-UTR of FasL mRNA contains AREs strikingly similar in structure to those of TNFα. Our data demonstrate that via these AREs, FasL mRNA associates with HuR and that this association is absolutely required for its expression. We also discuss the functional relevance of posttranscriptional regulation of FasL and its impact on T lymphocyte maturation. The human FasL 3′-UTR was PCR-amplified, and a 5′-BamHI site followed by stop codon and a 3′-HindIII site were introduced (for primer sequences see supplemental Materials and Methods). This PCR fragment was inserted into a pEGFP-C2 vector (Clontech) between the BglII and HindIII sites downstream of GFP. The GST and GST-HuR constructs were previously described (23Brennan C.M. Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). All plasmids were prepared using the plasmid maxiprep kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The fusion proteins were purified as described in (23Brennan C.M. Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 24Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The proteins were eluted from the glutathione-agarose beads with three applications of 500 μl of glutathione elution buffer (10 mm for the first elution, and 20 mm for the second and third elutions). Proteins were then dialyzed overnight against phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. The 20 mm glutathione eluates were the most pure (as determined by SDS-PAGE) and were used in all experiments. Jurkat cells (E6 clone) (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)) were maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium (Invitrogen) augmented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen). Jurkat cells were stimulated with PHA (Sigma) at 1 μg/ml or at 50 ng/ml for the times indicated. RNA stability curves were generated by treatment of cells with actinomycin D (Sigma) at 5 μg/ml. Transfections were performed in 12-well plates using 1 μg of plasmid DNA and TransPass RV (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HEK 293 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Multicell) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma). HEK 293 cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml PMA for the times indicated. Transfections were performed in 10-cm2 dishes with 8–16 μg of plasmid DNA and Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfections of siRNA were performed with 60 nm duplexes (siHuR or siCtrl)/10-cm2 cell culture dish, using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions (25van der Giessen K. Di Marco S. Clair E. Gallouzi I.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47119-47128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were transfected at 20% confluence then retransfected with siRNA 24 h later. Knockdown was assessed 52 h after the first transfection. Immunoprecipitation and RNA preparation were performed as previously described (26Tenenbaum S.A. Lager P.J. Carson C.C. Keene J.D. Methods. 2002; 26: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) with several modifications. Briefly, cell extracts were prepared from PHA-stimulated Jurkat cells or PMA-stimulated HEK 293 cells. mRNP lysate (400 μl) was precleared with 8 μl of protein G-Sepharose, and the precleared lysate was subsequently divided for each immunoprecipitation (IP). IPs were performed using antibodies to HuR (3A2) and IgG1 isotype control antibody (Sigma). Specific messages associated with HuR were defined using RT-PCR. RNA was isolated from the immunoprecipitated mRNP complexes using the ChargeSwitch RNA isolation kit (Invitrogen) scaled to 20% of the manufacturer's instructions. Purified RNA was eluted in 30 μl of water, and 4 μl was reverse-transcribed using the Sensiscript reverse transcription kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol in 20 μl of final volume. Subsequently, 2 μl of cDNA was PCR-amplified with HotStarTaq (Qiagen) using actin, FasL, or GFP cDNA-specific primers (see supplemental Materials and Methods). The sequences of the primers, as well as the PCR conditions, are described in the supplemental Materials and Methods. The FasL RNA probes were produced by in vitro transcription as described previously (27Gallouzi I.E. Parker F. Chebli K. Maurier F. Labourier E. Barlat I. Capony J.P. Tocque B. Tazi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3956-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Regions of FasL 3′-UTR were PCR-amplified with sense primers containing the T7 promoter in 5′ (see supplemental Materials and Methods for primer sequences). The purified PCR fragment was used as a template for transcription using [32P]UTP with T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA binding assay was performed with purified 300 ng of GST and GST-HuR as described previously (18Di Marco S. Hel Z. Lachance C. Furneaux H. Radzioch D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 863-871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that upon incubation the RNA-protein complex was not treated with RNase T1. Northern blot analysis was performed as described (28Wojciechowski W. DeSanctis J. Skamene E. Radzioch D. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2688-2696PubMed Google Scholar). 15 μg of RNA was used and was isolated with the RNeasy Plus extraction kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transferring to a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and UV cross-linking, the blot was hybridized with GFP or 18 S rRNA probes prepared with [32P]dCTP by random priming with Ready-to-go DNA labeling beads (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR-amplified fragments of GFP and 18 S rRNA were used to generate labeled probes. After hybridization, the membranes were washed and subsequently exposed on BioMax films (Kodak). Cells were counted by using a hemocytometer and adjusted to a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. 0.5 ml of cells was washed three times in 1.5 ml of PBS and then resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS with 2% FBS. Acquisition of data was done on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson), and the analysis of these data was performed with FlowJo software. Total cell extracts were prepared as described (27Gallouzi I.E. Parker F. Chebli K. Maurier F. Labourier E. Barlat I. Capony J.P. Tocque B. Tazi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3956-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed as described previously (23Brennan C.M. Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The blots were probed with antibodies to HuR (3A2), tubulin (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), and GFP (JL8; Clontech). Immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (29Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 15293-15298Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Anti-HuR (3A2) was used at a 1:1500 dilution in 1% goat serum/PBS. HuR was detected using a 1:500 diluted Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody. DAPI staining 1:20,000 was performed after secondary antibody. A Zeiss Axiovision 3.1 microscope was used to observe the cells with a 63 × oil objective, and an Axiocam HR (Zeiss) digital camera was used for immunofluorescence photography. RNA was isolated for quantitative RT-PCR by using the ChargeSwitch RNA isolation kit (Invitrogen) scaled to 20% of the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was quantitated using the Ribogreen kit (Molecular Probes), and 150 ng was reverse transcribed using the Sensiscript reverse transcription kit (Qiagen). Subsequently, the cDNA was PCR-amplified with primers described in supplemental Materials and Methods, using the Quantitect SYBR Green kit (Qiagen) in a Corbett Rotor Gene real time thermocycler. The Ct value was used to calculate the amount of the cDNA of interest by extrapolation from a standard curve. Previous reports have shown that FasL mRNA is rapidly induced in T lymphocytes upon T cell receptor engagement and mitogen stimulation (1Strasser A. Jost P.J. Nagata S. Immunity. 2009; 30: 180-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). To define whether this up-regulation was associated with a stabilization of the FasL mRNA, we first assessed its steady-state levels in T cells exposed to various activators. Jurkat T cells were treated with either PHA, a lectin that nonspecifically aggregates cell surface receptors or PMA, a PKC agonist (1Strasser A. Jost P.J. Nagata S. Immunity. 2009; 30: 180-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 30Chien E.J. Hsieh D.J. Wang J.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We observed a rapid increase in the level of FasL mRNA at 3 h of PHA treatment. In contrast, PMA treatment had a smaller effect on the steady-state levels of FasL mRNA (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, levels of FasL mRNA return to baseline within 6–12 h of PHA stimulus, indicating that FasL is transiently expressed in response to lectins similarly to other cytokines. In the absence of PHA or PMA, however, the FasL mRNA was hard to detect (Fig. 1A). Next, we determined the half-life of FasL mRNA under these conditions. We performed actinomycin D pulse-chase experiments (31Dormoy-Raclet V. Ménard I. Clair E. Kurban G. Mazroui R. Di Marco S. von Roretz C. Pause A. Gallouzi I.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5365-5380Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and determined the half-life of the FasL mRNA using quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Jurkat cells were treated with PHA or PMA for 3 h to induce maximal FasL mRNA expression and then treated with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D for different periods of time. We observed that whereas upon PHA treatment the half-life of FasL mRNA in Jurkat cells was slightly over 60 min, upon PMA treatment, the FasL mRNA half-life was >4 h (Fig. 1B). Of note, because in untreated Jurkat cells the FasL mRNA is difficult to detect, it was not possible to assess its half-life under these conditions. Therefore, the rapid increase in FasL mRNA expression and the difference in its half-life between the two treatments (PHA and PMA) indicate that for this message to be properly expressed, stabilization mechanisms, similar to those reported for other TNF family members, are activated at least for a short period of time. The stabilization of cytokine mRNAs is usually mediated by U-rich elements such as AREs located in their 3′-UTR (12Barreau C. Paillard L. Osborne H.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 7138-7150Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 32Jacobson A. Peltz S.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 693-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Our initial analysis of the primary sequence of FasL 3′-UTR indicated that it contains the typical AUUUA consensus sequence as well as a 300nt U-rich region (supplemental Fig. 1). The mFold prediction software for mRNA folding showed that both TNFα and FasL mRNAs could fold and form a highly similar secondary structure (Fig. 2A). This prediction method has highlighted the existence in the extreme 3′-end of the FasL 3′-UTR of two conserved U-rich sequences that are similar in structure and localization to the TNFα ARE-1 and ARE-2 (Fig. 2B) (33Fialcowitz E.J. Brewer B.Y. Keenan B.P. Wilson G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22406-22417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that similarly to TNFα (18Di Marco S. Hel Z. Lachance C. Furneaux H. Radzioch D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 863-871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the expression of FasL mRNA could involve the association of these U-rich sequences (AREs 1 or 2) with the HuR protein. To test this possibility, we first assessed whether HuR can interact with the FasL mRNA in Jurkat T cells. To ensure the expression of FasL mRNA and reduce FasL-induced apoptosis, Jurkat cells were treated for only 2 h with PHA. These cells were then used to perform IP experiments with the anti-HuR antibody (34Gallouzi I.E. Brennan C.M. Stenberg M.G. Swanson M.S. Eversole A. Maizels N. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 3073-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) followed by RT-PCR analysis. Prior to the IP experiments, the cells were either exposed or not to UV irradiation for 4 min as described (34Gallouzi I.E. Brennan C.M. Stenberg M.G. Swanson M.S. Eversole A. Maizels N. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 3073-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). We observed that in PHA-treated Jurkat cells, with or without UV treatment, the FasL mRNA specifically associated with HuR compared with an isotype-matched control antibody (Fig. 3A). To map the HuR binding sites in the FasL 3′-UTR and to prove that the interaction between HuR and FasL mRNA is direct, the FasL 3′-UTR was divided into six 150-nucleotide regions that were used as probes for RNA electromobility shift assay (Fig. 3B). We observed that all regions other than region 2 (R2) bind purified GST-HuR (Fig. 3C). However, regions 5 and 6, which are particularly U-rich (supplemental Fig. 2A), show a better binding to HuR (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 15 and 18 with lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12). We also showed that this interaction is competed away by an excess of the same unlabeled probes (Fig. 3D) but not with an excess of unlabeled R2 probe (supplemental Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Fas ligand mRNA associates with HuR via U-rich sequences in the 3′-UTR. A, Jurkat cells stimulated with 1 μg/ml PHA for 2 h were either exposed to UV for 4 min (34Gallouzi I.E. Brennan C.M. Stenberg M.G. Swanson M.S. Eversole A. Maizels N. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 3073-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) or not. These cells were then used to prepare total cell extracts. HuR was immunoprecipitated from Jurkats with the anti-HuR (3A2) antibody (lanes 2 and 4). A mouse IgG1 antibody was used as an isotype-matched specificity control (lanes 1 and 3). IP was followed by RT-PCR for FasL (upper) and the β-actin mRNA (lower) that was used as a positive control. Representative blots of two independent experiments are shown. B, diagram indicates the location and length of probes for the gel shift assay. C, HuR associates with regions R1 (lane 3), R3 (lane 9), R4 (lane 12), R5 (lane 15), and R6 (lane 18) of the FasL 3′-UTR. Gel shift binding assays were performed by incubating 300 ng of purified GST or GST-HuR protein with radiolabeled probes (see B). Radiolabeled probe·GST·HuR complexes (HuR-C) are indicated with an asterisk. D, increasing concentrations of unlabeled probes for the regions R5 and R6 were incubated with GST-HuR in the presence of radiolabeled probes from the same regions. HuR-Cs are indicated by asterisks. GST was incubated with radiolabeled R2 (lane 1), R5 (lane 4), and R6 (lane 12) probes as negative controls. These gel shifts were performed with 300 ng of purified GST or GST-HuR and with 0.01 × (lanes 6 and 14), 0.1× (lanes 7 and 15), 1 × (lanes 8 and 16), 10× (lanes 9 and 17), and 100× (lanes 10 and 18) amounts of unlabeled probe. C and D, representative gel shift blots of two independent experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we mapped regions 5 and 6 more precisely, to determine the number of HuR binding sites in these regions. Regions 5 and 6 of the FasL 3′-UTR were further subdivided into six 50-nucleotide subregions (Fig. 4A). RNA electromobility shift assay experiments as described above showed strong interactions between HuR and some of the subregions, notably subregions 5.2, 5.3, 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 (Fig. 4B). Therefore, our results indicate that there are at least four distinct U-rich HuR binding sites in regions 5 and 6 in addition to the weaker binding sites in regions 1, 3, and 4 (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, because the binding of HuR to these fragments can be competed by the same unlabeled probes (Fig. 4C), these interactions seem to be specific. Together, these observations argue that HuR binds directly to the 3′-UTR of FasL in an ARE-dependent manner. The data described above suggest that ARE sequences could collaborate with HuR to ensure the rapid expression of FasL mRNA during T cell activation. Hence, we assessed whether the expression of FasL mRNA depends on HuR in cells treated with activators such as PMA or PHA. Ideally, we would have liked to test this possibility in the context of the full-length FasL message by following its expression in the presence or absence of HuR. However, expressing the full-length FasL mRNA caused massive cell death in different cell lines, including Jurkat cells regardless of stimulus (data not shown). Therefore, we used GFP reporter constructs in which we fused the FasL 3′-UTR to the GFP coding sequence. The entire FasL 3′-UTR was included in the reporter construct because any or all of the HuR binding sites described in FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4 could mediate regulatory effects. Surprisingly, flow cytometry experiments showed that the level of expressed GFP was reduced by >55% in untreated Jurkat cells transfected with GFP-FasL 3′-UTR compared with GFP alone (Fig. 5A). This is probably due to other RNA-binding proteins which, in the absence of any stimulus, bind the FasL 3′-UTR in trans and promote its rapid decay. To eliminate the possibility that poor transfection efficiency in Jurkat cells led to the evaluation of a selected population, we transfected HEK 293 cells with the same constructs and obtained similar results by flow cytometry (Fig. 5B). In agreement with GFP protein levels, Northern blot analysis showed that in the absence of any treatment, the amount of GFP-FasL 3′-UTR mRNA in HEK 293 cells was significantly decreased compared with the GFP control (Fig. 5, C and D). These experiments suggest that in the absence of extracellular stimulus, the FasL 3′-UTR mediates the rapid decay of the GFP reporter mRNA. Due to the effects of PMA or PHA treatment on FasL expression, we investigated whether these actions were recapitulated on the expression of the GFP-conjugated FasL 3′-UTR. The GFP-FasL 3′-UTR or GFP plasmids were transfected into HEK 293 cells which were then treated or not with PMA. It is well established that HEK 293 cells activate the PKC pathway in response to PMA but not to PHA (35Böl G.F. Hülster A. Pfeuffer T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1358: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Additionally, our stability experiments presented in Fig. 1B clearly showed that PMA has a much stro"

The complex contains three DnaX subunits, which occur in two forms: τ and the shorter γ, produced by translational frameshifting. Ten forms of E. coli DnaX complex containing all possible combinations of wild-type or a Walker A motif K51E variant τ or γ have been reconstituted and rigorously purified. DnaX complexes containing three DnaX K51E subunits do not bind ATP. Comparison of their ability to support formation of initiation complexes, as measured by processive replication by the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, indicates a minimal requirement for one ATP-binding DnaX subunit. DnaX complexes containing two mutant DnaX subunits support DNA synthesis at about two-thirds the level of their wild-type counterparts. β(2) binding (determined functionally) is diminished 12-30-fold for DnaX complexes containing two K51E subunits, suggesting that multiple ATPs must be bound to place the DnaX complex into a conformation with maximal affinity for β(2). DNA synthesis activity can be restored by increased concentrations of β(2). In contrast, severe defects in ATP hydrolysis are observed upon introduction of a single K51E DnaX subunit. Thus, ATP binding, hydrolysis, and the ability to form initiation complexes are not tightly coupled. These results suggest that although ATP hydrolysis likely enhances β(2) loading, it is not absolutely required in a mechanistic sense for formation of functional initiation complexes."

We expressed recombinant isoforms in Escherichia coli and tested their binding toward TM5, G-actin, and F-actin. Solid-phase binding assays show that, without the N-terminal 102 residues, E-Tmod29 binds to TM5 or G-actin more strongly than E-Tmod41 does, but barely binds to F-actin after TM5 binding. Differential bindings explain the distinct localizations of E-Tmod29 in the cytosol and E-Tmod41 on the membrane. Sequential bindings and immunofluorescent staining further suggest that 1) TM5 binding to E-Tmod41 may open up the flexible N-terminal half, exposing N-ABD and unblocking C-ABD; 2) N-ABD binds to F-actin and C-ABD binds to G-actin; and 3) F-actin binding to N-ABD may prevent G-actin from binding to C-ABD.

Erythrocytes are responsible for the transport of O2 and CO2 in tissues throughout the body. Their cell membranes have a thin layer of protein skeleton under the lipid bilayer. The viscoelasticity and durability of this protein skeleton allows erythrocytes to circulate for 120 days in humans and 60 days in mice. These membrane skeletal proteins are differentially expressed during erythroid differentiation, and the complex transcellular cytoskeleton is remodeled into a membrane skeleton during reticulocyte maturation (1Chasis J.A.

Blood. 1992; 79: 2763-2770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, some in JC are cell type-specific isoforms generated by one or more of the above mechanisms. For example, exon 16 of protein 4.1R, which encodes the 8-kDa spectrin/actin-binding domain (ABD), is alternatively spliced (15Yang G. Huang S.C. Wu J.Y. Benz Jr., E.J. Blood. 2008; 111: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 16Conboy J.G. Chan J. Mohandas N. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 9062-9065Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). β spectrin, which has an ABD, is generated by the differential splicing of its exon 32 (9Chu Z.L. Wickrema A. Krantz S.B. Winkelmann J.C. Blood. 1994; 84: 1992-1999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, α spectrin, which has no ABD, is synthesized three times more than β spectrin, but is quickly degraded in reticulocytes if not incorporated into the membrane skeleton (17Corsi D. Galluzzi L. Crinelli R. Magnani M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8928-8935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, coordinated expression between ABD-containing and ABD-lacking proteins and isoforms is crucial to the construction of the network. Additionally, 41-kDa E-Tmod (18Sung L.A. Fowler V.M. Lambert K. Sussman M.A. Karr D. Chien S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2616-2621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is also an ABD-containing protein (19Ursitti J.A. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1633-1639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It caps the slow-growing end (pointed or minus end) (20Fowler V.M. Sussmann M.A. Miller P.G. Flucher B.E. Daniels M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 21Weber A. Pennise C.R. Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J.

Chem. 1987; 262: 12792-12800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it binds to the N terminus of TM (23Sung L.A. Lin J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 24Vera C. Sood A. Gao K.M. Yee L.J. Lin J.J. Sung L.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 378: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), forming a complex with two shorter TM isoforms 5 or 5b (∼35 nm) (25Sung L.A. Gao K.M. Yee L.J. Temm-Grove C.J. Helfman D.M. Lin J.J. Mehrpouryan M. Blood. 2000; 95: 1473-1480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), encoded by the γ and α genes, respectively. Such complexes may function as a “molecular ruler” (a T ruler with a cap), metering off long actin filaments to short protofilaments of ∼37 nm (25Sung L.A. Gao K.M. Yee L.J. Temm-Grove C.J. Helfman D.M. Lin J.J. Mehrpouryan M. Blood. 2000; 95: 1473-1480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sung L.A. Vera C. Ann. Biomed. Eng. 2003; 31: 1314-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In our previous study on “protofilament and hexagon” (26Sung L.A. Vera C. Ann. Biomed. Eng. 2003; 31: 1314-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we illustrated that the length of the protofilament dictates the hexagonal topology of the skeletal network. We showed that a protofilament reinforced by TM (one in each groove) and capped by E-Tmod may function as a mechanical axis to anchor 3 (top, middle, and bottom) pairs of Sp, forming a 6-armed structure. There, we reported the first three-dimensional model for a JC and how each pair of G-actin may be wrapped around by a split α and β spectrin (Sp) and stabilized by 4.1R, forming a basic repeating unit (26Sung L.A. Vera C. Ann. Biomed. Eng. 2003; 31: 1314-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This model allows the three-dimensional nano-mechanics of a JC or a basic unit to be simulated in terms of the attitude (pitch, yaw, and roll angles) of the protofilament and the tension of each radiating Sp (in pN) during equibiaxial and anisotropic deformations (27Vera C. Skelton R. Bossens F. Sung L.A. Ann. Biomed. Eng. 2005; 33: 1387-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Zhu Q. Vera C. Asaro R.J. Sche P. Sung L.A. Biophys. J. 2007; 93: 386-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). E-Tmod is also present in non-erythroid cells and tissues. In muscular cells, it is located at the free end of thin filaments in myofibrils (20Fowler V.M. Sussmann M.A. Miller P.G. Flucher B.E. Daniels M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and costameres in the skeletal muscle (29Almenar-Queralt A. Lee A. Conley C.A. Ribas de Pouplana L. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28466-28475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It is also expressed in lens fiber cells in the eye (30Woo M.K. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and neurons (31Yao W. Nathanson J. Lian I. Gage F.H. Sung L.A. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2007; 8: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) in the CNS (32Ito M. Swanson B. Sussman M.A. Kedes L. Lyons G. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The Tmod family contains several homologous genes across several species, including vertebrates and non-vertebrates (for summary, see Table 1 in Ref. 33Chu X. Thompson D. Yee L.J. Sung L.A. Gene. 2000; 256: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Using antibodies, several immunoreactive peptides of various sizes have been detected in a number of cell types of different species (34Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). But no isoforms derived from the E-Tmod gene have been identified. E-Tmod is highly conserved among species (including human, mouse, rat, and chicken). The percentage of identity between mouse and several other species in each exon has been tabulated (33Chu X. Thompson D. Yee L.J. Sung L.A. Gene. 2000; 256: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In particular, no insertion or deletion was found in exon 6 (E6) and exon 7 (E7) within the entire family of more than 15 members, including those more remote, different-sized homologs. CD and differential scanning calorimetry have been used to study chicken E-Tmod. The N-terminal half lacks a definite tertiary structure in solution, whereas the C-terminal half (residues 160–344) represents a single, cooperatively melting domain. Furthermore, the N-terminal half of E-Tmod and the N-terminal end of TM exhibit drastic structural changes upon binding to each other (35Kostyukova A.S. Tiktopulo E.I. Maéda Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 345-351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The regions of E-Tmod involved in actin and TM bindings have been investigated in different species. In chickens the actin-binding activity was found in two distinct regions (36Fowler V.M. Greenfield N.J. Moyer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40000-40009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). An N-terminal actin-binding domain (N-ABD) contains an actin binding site involving residues 1–92 in chickens (37Greenfield N.J. Kostyukova A.S. Hitchcock-Degregori S.E. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 372-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) or residues 71–104 in humans (38Vera C. Lao J. Hamelberg D. Sung L.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 444: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 39Kostyukova A.S. Rapp B.A. Choy A. Greenfield N.J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4905-4910Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Specifically, a L71D mutation destroyed the capping function in chickens (39Kostyukova A.S. Rapp B.A. Choy A. Greenfield N.J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4905-4910Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). There is another ABD located in the C-terminal half (36Fowler V.M. Greenfield N.J. Moyer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40000-40009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) (chicken). Interestingly, a TM5 binding site (TBS) is positioned immediately downstream from the N-terminal actin binding site. In humans, TBS was mapped to residues 105–127 with LE/E (116–117/118) being the critical residues (38Vera C. Lao J. Hamelberg D. Sung L.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 444: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that E-Tmod does not bind to G-actin when F-actin is present in the solution (21Weber A. Pennise C.R. Babcock G.G. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, whether the N- or C-terminal actin binding site is for G-actin or F-actin. Both human and mouse E-Tmod (Tmod1) genes have been characterized (33Chu X. Thompson D. Yee L.J. Sung L.A. Gene. 2000; 256: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Each has nine coding exons (E1–9) and further upstream, one 5′ non-coding exon (E0). Both species have an upstream promoter 5′ to E0 and a downstream promoter 5′ to E1. The capping of actin filaments at the slow growing end by E-Tmod is essential: an embryonic lethality was revealed when the E-Tmod gene is disrupted at either E1 (40Chu X. Chen J. Reedy M.C. Vera C. Sung K.L. Sung L.A. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2003; 284: H1827-H1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) or E2 (41Fritz-Six K.L. Cox P.R. Fischer R.S. Xu B. Gregorio C.C. Zoghbi H.Y. Fowler V.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1033-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The homozygous E1 KO embryos die approximately at embryonic day 10, exhibiting a non-contractile heart tube, accumulation of mechanically weakened primitive erythroid cells, and failure of primary capillary plexuses to remodel into vitelline vessels (40Chu X. Chen J. Reedy M.C. Vera C. Sung K.L. Sung L.A. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2003; 284: H1827-H1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the discovery of a new E-Tmod isoform of 29 kDa in mice that has a truncated N terminus. We illustrated how isoforms with and without N-ABD are generated. In addition, we identified their distinct cellular distributions, verified the functionality of both promoters, expressed recombinant isoforms, and tested their binding activities toward TM5, G-actin, and F-actin. Based on these results, we formulated a model to show how N- and C-terminal ABDs may function and participate in the formation of E-Tmod/TM/actin complex as well as how these two isoforms may coordinate during the construction of the membrane skeletal network for erythrocytes. Adult mice of C57BL wild type were used to collect erythrocytes, aortae, uteri, and hearts. Erythrocytes were lysed in lysis buffer (6 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mg/liter PMSF, 2 mg/liter pepstatin) to obtain whole cell lysate. Ghost membranes were isolated following an established protocol (42Dodge J.T. Mitchell C. Hanahan D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1963; 100: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3612) Google Scholar), and the cytosolic fraction was also collected. Other tissues were homogenized in column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 6 mm PMSF) and centrifuged at 4000 × g for 5 min to remove undissolved tissues. Embryos were obtained by timed mating and collected at embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5). Yolk sacs were isolated and homogenized in column buffer. Yolk sacs were also gently broken to release erythroblasts into a mouse RBC solution (10 mm KCl, 143 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm glucose, 2 mm inosine, 0.25% BSA, 4.5 mm EDTA). For reticulocyte-enriched blood, the established protocol (43Gutierrez E. Sung L.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2007; 219: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) using phenylhydrazine was followed. Reticulocytes were isolated for Western blot analysis by density gradient centrifugation using Histopaque 1071 (Sigma). Cytosolic and membrane fractions were separated by the same procedure for mature erythrocytes. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). All animal handling procedures are approved by the Animal Care Program at the University of California, San Diego. Ten micrograms of ghost membrane or 100 μg of total proteins from other tissues were mixed with 2× SDS loading buffer (containing 200 mm DTT) and separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel (pH 8.8). Protein profiles were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with mAb 204 (1:150) or pAb 2644 (1:100) (23Sung L.A. Lin J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The former was followed by an HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG incubation (1:3000) and chemiluminescent detection; the latter by HRP-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:1500) and colorimetric development. Total RNA was isolated from the aorta, heart, uterus, and yolk sac using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Reticulocyte RNA was extracted from reticulocyte-enriched blood using partial lysis combined with TRIzol (43Gutierrez E. Sung L.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2007; 219: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase and Oligo(dT) 12–18 primers (Invitrogen). 2 μl of cDNA was then amplified using a forward primer, 5′-CGCCAGGGAACTCGCCAAG-3′, and a reverse primer, 5′-GCACACGCATCATCGGTAGAACAC-3′, located in E0 and E9, respectively. Amplification (35 cycles) was performed under the following conditions: denaturation for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing for 30 s at 55 °C, and extension for 2 min at 68 °C. DNA fragments were analyzed by 0.9% agarose gel electrophoresis. The PCR products were cloned to TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The instruction for rapid amplification of cDNA end, version 2.0, from Invitrogen was followed. Primer 630R (5′-CATTGTTCTTTATTCGCTCCAGCGTT-3′) was used for the first strand cDNA synthesis. Two nested primers, 520R (5′-CTTGTTCACGATGGAGCTG-3′) and 440R (5′-CAGTTCTGCATCCGAGGCATTTGC-3′), were used as gene-specific primers for subsequent PCR amplification. The 5′ adapter primers were abridged anchor primer and abridged universal amplification primer. E0 (89 bp) sequence plus 776 bp upstream was PCR-amplified from the genomic DNA using a forward primer with an EcoRI site: 5′-GGAATTCTGGGAATAGTAAGTCCCTGC-3′ and a reverse primer with a BamHI site: 5′-CGGGATCCGATGCGGGGTGGCGCGAG-3′. The 679-bp upstream sequence plus the 49 bp of the untranslated region of E1 were also PCR-amplified using a forward primer with a BglII site: 5′-GAAGATCTCTATCAACGTCACTGTAGGG-3′ and a reverse primer with a BamHI site: 5′-CGGGATCCTGTGTGAGGCTGTGTCTTTGC-3′. The PCR products were then inserted into pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) at its EcoRI/BamHI and BglII/BamHI sites, respectively. The pCMV promoter region in the vector was cut out by the AseI/BglII digestion to avoid its interference to the inserted promoters. The constructs were designated as PE0-EGFP and PE1-EGFP, respectively. Murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cell line was used for transfection by Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Stable transfectants were selected by G418 (400 μg/ml), and the EGFP signals were quantified on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). cDNA sequences covering exons 1–9 and exons 0/3–9 were amplified from cDNA prepared from reticulocytes by PCR. The PCR products were inserted separately in-frame into the 5′-end of the EGFP-encoding sequence of pEGFP-N1 with a CMV promoter. The constructs E1–9/EGFP and E0/3–9/EGFP were then transiently transfected into C2C12 myoblasts using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). The cells were lysed using RIPA buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS, 1 mm PMSF) at 72 h after transfection. Western blot analysis was performed using anti-E-Tmod mAb 204 (1:150) to detect the EGFP fusion proteins. E0–9 and E0/3–9 cDNA were prepared by RT-PCR from mouse reticulocytes and cloned into pET100 vector (Invitrogen) with an N-terminal 6× His tag. The plasmids (pET-E1–9 and pET-E0/3–9) were transformed into BL21 StarTM (DE3)-competent cells. The recombinant proteins were induced to express by isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm). The bacterial cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100) followed by sonication. The supernatant was collected by centrifuging at 4,000 × g for 30 min. The recombinant proteins in the supernatant were purified at 4 °C with nickel column (Sigma). The procedure was based on Sung and Lin (23Sung L.A. Lin J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, E-Tmod isoforms (1 μg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and overlaid with recombinant human (h) TM5, G-actin (extracted from rabbit skeletal muscle, Cytoskeleton Inc., Denver, CO), or F-actin. The transblot was incubated with either a mouse anti-TM5 mAb CG3 (IgM, 1:1000, epitope mapped to residues 29–44 and kindly provided by Jim Lin) or mouse anti-human actin mAb AC-40 (1:500) (Sigma). It was then followed by an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody against mouse IgM or IgG, respectively, and chemiluminescent detection. F-actin was prepared from G-actin by adding 1/10 volume of actin polymerization buffer (500 mm KCl, 20 mm, MgCl2, 10 mm ATP) based on an established procedure (44Allingham J.S. Zampella A. D'Auria M.V. Rayment I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 14527-14532Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We measured the densities of the bands with ImagePro software and divided the values by the amount of isoform protein used to obtain the pixels/microgram of protein values. The ratio of binding signals between the two isoforms was then calculated. To avoid the variations caused by the molecular weights, we further calculated their pixel/mole of protein values based on their molecular weights, and the final signal ratio was again obtained. Erythroblasts from yolk sacs, reticulocyte-enriched blood, and erythrocytes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and washed three times in the mouse RBC solution. The cells were incubated in the blocking solution (2% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 in the mouse RBC solution) for 30 min and then incubated with mAb 204 (1:100) at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing, the cells were incubated with goat-anti-mouse IgG-FITC (1:250) at 4 °C for 45 min. F-actin was then stained by incubating the cells with rhodamine-phalloidin (5 units, Invitrogen). After washing, cells were re-suspended in 2% gelatin and mounted on coverslips. The fluorescent images were taken with a confocal microscope (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, UltraView Confocal Head, Hamamatsu OrcaER 1394 Camera, and Olympus IX70 Microscope). E-Tmod of 41 kDa (E-Tmod41) was first cloned and sequenced in humans (18Sung L.A. Fowler V.M. Lambert K. Sussman M.A. Karr D. Chien S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2616-2621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) followed by other species (32Ito M. Swanson B. Sussman M.A. Kedes L. Lyons G. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To reveal potential isoforms several cells or tissues of mice known to express E-Tmod were investigated by Western blot analyses (Fig. 2). Two specific antibodies were used: a polyclonal antibody (pAb) 2644 (Fig. 2A) and a monoclonal antibody (mAb) 204 (Fig. 2B). pAb 2644 was made in a rabbit against a human synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 70–84. Because this peptide is located within the N-terminal ABD and encoded by exon 2 (E2), it is also called anti-E2 pAb (23Sung L.A. Lin J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 38Vera C. Lao J. Hamelberg D. Sung L.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 444: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Mouse mAb 204 was made against recombinant human E-Tmod, and its epitope was mapped to include residues 212–249. Because these residues are within the C-terminal domain and encoded by exons 6 and/or 7 (33Chu X. Thompson D. Yee L.J. Sung L.A. Gene. 2000; 256: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), mAb 204 can also be called anti-E6/7 mAb. Anti-E2 pAb revealed one single band of Mr 41,000 in erythrocyte ghost membranes, erythrocytes, aorta, uterus, and heart. This is not surprising, because this pAb has been used to identify E-Tmod of 41 kDa in humans and mice (23Sung L.A. Lin J.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 31Yao W. Nathanson J. Lian I. Gage F.H. Sung L.A. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2007; 8: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The new finding is that in addition to a single Mr 41,000 species found in the erythrocyte ghost membrane (g), anti-E6/7 mAb detected two additional bands of Mr 29,000 and Mr 58,000 in erythrocytes (e). Because sample (e) included not only the cell membrane but also the cytosol, the two new species were present in the cytosol. In fact, these three bands also co-exist in non-erythroid tissues, i.e. aorta (a), uterus (u), and heart (h). To test if Mr 58,000 is a dimer of Mr 29,000 (which may be a short isoform of E-Tmod) we omitted DTT in one uterus sample (u−), whereas all other samples, including u, were treated with 100 mm DTT. Without DTT to break disulfide bonds, Mr 58,000 was found to increase, whereas Mr 29,000 decreased in u−. Further, by increasing DTT to 200 mm we converted all Mr 58,000 to Mr 29,000 in uterus samples (data not shown). Thus, Mr 29,000 and Mr 58,000 are indeed mono- and dimeric forms of the same molecule. The relative abundance of Mr 41,000 and Mr 29,000 is different among tissues. In the heart, Mr 41,000 is the predominant species while Mr 29,000 is the principal in the aorta and the uterus (smooth muscles). The ratios between the two species (Mr 29,000/Mr 41,000) in aorta, uterus, and heart are ∼8, 35, and 0.6, respectively (Fig. 2B). In erythrocytes Mr 41,000 is confirmed to be the sole species in the ghost membrane (g). As to the newly discovered Mr 29,000 and its dimer, it is the main (or only) species in the cytosol (see e). Mr 29,000 (in the cytosol) may outnumber Mr 41,000 (in the membrane) on the per cell basis, because the latter was not detectable in the whole cell sample (see e). We tested for the possibility that Mr 29,000 is a shorter E-Tmod isoform. Because anti-E2 pAb only detects the larger Mr 41,000 species and anti-E6/7 mAb detects both (Fig. 2, A and B), Mr 29,000 may be a splice variant in which E2 is spliced out. Therefore, RT-PCR with gene-specific primers derived from E0 and E9 was performed to reveal the inclusion or exclusion of E2 (Fig. 2C). The c"

Despite their structural similarity, the diverse functions of these isoforms imply that they are additionally regulated by post-translational modifications. Here, we have identified intermolecular disulfide bond formation of HP1 cysteines in an isoform-specific manner. Cysteine 133 in HP1α and cysteine 177 in HP1γ were involved in intermolecular homodimerization. Although both HP1α and HP1γ contain reactive cysteine residues, only HP1γ readily and reversibly formed disulfide homodimers under oxidative conditions. Oxidatively dimerized HP1γ strongly and transiently interacted with TIF1β, a universal transcriptional co-repressor. Under oxidative conditions, HP1γ dimerized and held TIF1β in a chromatin component and inhibited its repression ability. Our results highlight a novel, isoform-specific role for HP1 as a sensor of the cellular redox state.

Oxidatively dimerized HP1γ strongly and transiently interacted with TIF1β, a universal transcriptional co-repressor. Under oxidative conditions, HP1γ dimerized and held TIF1β in a chromatin component and inhibited its repression ability. Our results highlight a novel, isoform-specific role for HP1 as a sensor of the cellular redox state. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) was originally characterized as an abundant protein that binds pericentric heterochromatin (1James T.C. Elgin S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3862-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). HP1 acts as a scaffold-like molecule, which is composed of two conserved domains as follows: the chromodomain (CD) 2The abbreviations used are: CDchromodomainCSDchromoshadow domainHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cell4-OHThydroxytamoxifen. and the chromoshadow domain (CSD). The variable hinge region separates these two domains (2Wallrath L.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The CD recognizes methylated lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9), which recruits HP1 to specific sites within the genome (3Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Partridge J.F. Miska E.A. Thomas J.O. Allshire R.C.

The CSD promotes HP1 homodimer formation and provides a surface for interaction with a variety of other chromatin proteins (6Brasher S.V. Smith B.O. Fogh R.H. Nietlispach D. Thiru A. Nielsen P.R.

Although genetic experiments previously revealed that HP1 works as a repressor of gene activation by propagation of a heterochromatin structure, emerging evidence has elucidated its diverse functions other than gene silencing (8Grewal S.I. Jia S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Some of these functions are regulated in an isoform-specific manner (9Lomberk G. Wallrath L. Urrutia R.

In vertebrates, three isoforms of HP1 exist as follows: α, β, and γ, all of which share highly conserved domains. Tethering any HP1 isoform upstream of a promoter equally triggers gene silencing concomitant with local chromatin condensation and an increase in H3K9 methylation (10Schultz D.C. Ayyanathan K.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5540-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 19Ritou E. Bai M. Georgatos S.D. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3425-3435Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), of these three HP1 isoforms imply that α, β, and γ are functionally diverse. Furthermore, recent evidence clarified apparently opposite functions of HP1 isoforms, e.g. a role in transcriptional activation or in transcriptional elongation (20Mateescu B. Bourachot B. Rachez C. Ogryzko V. Muchardt C. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Vakoc C.R. Mandat S.A. Olenchock B.A. Blobel G.A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 381-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). One mechanism that could account for such functional diversity of HP1 isoforms is post-translational modification, which could cause conformational changes in the molecule. In fact, reversible modifications of HP1 (e.g. phosphorylation) can modulate its function in response to various stimuli or cellular environments, suggesting an active role for HP1 beyond its known function as a marker of heterochromatin (17Lomberk G. Bensi D. Fernandez-Zapico M.E. Urrutia R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 22Ayoub N. Jeyasekharan A.D. Bernal J.A. Venkitaraman A.R. Nature. 2008; 453: 682-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). However, the precise modulatory mechanism across three HP1 isoforms that leads to functional differences remains to be elucidated. Here, we identified isoform-specific disulfide bond formation as a novel post-translational modification of HP1. We analyzed the biochemical and functional characteristics of this oxidative modification. These data may offer a new insight into a novel role for HP1 during the cellular response to oxidative stress. We used the following commercially available materials for Western blotting: anti-HP1α (H2164, Sigma; 19s2, Millipore); anti-HP1β (MAB3448, Chemicon); anti-HP1γ (42s2, Millipore); anti-FLAG M2-peroxidase antibody (Sigma); anti-histone H3 (ab1791, Abcam); anti-GAPDH (MAB374, Chemicon); and anti-TIF1β (4123, Cell Signaling). We also used anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel for immunoprecipitation. We used menadione (Sigma), H2O2 (Wako), and hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) (Sigma) for cell treatment. Cells were lysed with hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm KCl) with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was collected as the cytosolic fraction. Extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.42 m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol) was added to the pellet, and ultrasonic agitation was performed (30-s sonication with 30-s interval, 4–6 times at 0 °C; Bioruptor, CosmoBio). The suspension was incubated for 15 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected as the nuclear extract. For anion exchange, whole cells were lysed with buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5% acetonitrile) containing 5 mm EDTA and 1% Nonidet P-40 and incubated at 4 °C for 15 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was filtered and loaded onto an anion-exchange column (Q-Sepharose High Performance, GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. After unbound samples were washed, protein was eluted with a linear gradient (0–100%) of buffer B (buffer A with 1.0 m NaCl). For reverse-phase HPLC, purified protein samples and nuclear extracts were prepared with 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and 20% acetonitrile and applied to a phenyl reverse-phase column (4.6 × 250 mm; Nakalai Tesque). Bound proteins were eluted by a segmented linear gradient of increasing concentrations of buffer B (acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA) in buffer A (0.1% TFA) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Buffer B was increased at a rate of 1.0%/fraction (fast gradient) or 0.2%/fraction (slow gradient). Collected fractions were dried by a centrifugal evaporator and reconstituted with SDS sample buffer with or without 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol (reducing or nonreducing conditions, respectively). Triton extraction was carried out as described previously with modification (23Petta T.B. Nakajima S. Zlatanou A. Despras E. Couve-Privat S. Ishchenko A. Sarasin A. Yasui A. Kannouche P. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2883-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed with a hypotonic lysis buffer with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min (as described above). The pellet was lysed in extraction buffer with 0.2% Triton X-100, incubated on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was kept as a Triton-soluble fraction. The remaining pellet was lysed in SDS sample buffer (250 mm Tris, 5% SDS, and 5% glycerol) with or without 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol (reducing or nonreducing conditions, respectively), and ultrasonic agitation was performed as described above. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was kept as a Triton-insoluble fraction. Lentiviral particles derived from the pLKO.1-puro-containing shRNA sequence were purchased from the Mission shRNA library (Sigma). The oligonucleotide sequences of the shRNA were as follows: shRNA-6, CGACGTGTAGTGAATGGGAAA; and shRNA-7, GCGTTTCTTAACTCTCAGAAA. Lentiviral particles were used to transduce human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) or HEK293T cells in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene. To generate a HEK293T stable cell line, the infected cells were selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin. The stable cells in which HP1γ was almost completely depleted were next transfected with pEF-DEST51 HP1γ-FLAG WT or a C177S mutant (cloned from murine cDNA and resistant to shRNA), and the stable cells were selected with 5 μg/ml blasticidin. pC3-ERHBD-GAL4 or pC3-ERHBD-GAL4-KAP1 (TIF1β) with pGL4.31-PSV40-GAL4UAS were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 into subconfluent HEK293T stable cells that were passaged 1 day before transfection. After 24 h, 0.04% ethanol or 4-OHT (500 nm) was added to the culture medium. Forty eight h after transfection, luciferase activity was measured by a luminometer (Lumat LB9507). Intranuclear mRNA levels of luciferase were measured as follows. Twenty four h after transfection, 4-OHT (500 nm) was added to the culture medium. Forty eight h after transfection, cells were lysed with a hypotonic lysis buffer with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min (as described above). From the nuclear pellet, total RNA was isolated using RNA-Bee (Cosmo Bio). Total RNA was treated with DNase (Turbo DNA-free, Applied Biosystems) and was reverse-transcribed using a high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Luciferase mRNA levels were measured by real time quantitative PCR (SYBR Green ER, Invitrogen). Firefly luciferase cDNA was amplified using the following primers: 5′-TACCCACTCGAAGACGGGAC-3′ and 5′-ACTCGGCGTAGGTAATGTCCACCTC-3′. Human 18 S ribosomal RNA was measured using the following primers: 5′-GTAACCCGTTGAACCCCATT-3′ and 5′-CCATCCAATCGGTAGTAGCG-3′. The relative levels of luciferase mRNA were normalized to the mRNA levels of 18 S ribosomal RNA. During purification of HP1α in our previous work (24Asano Y. Takashima S. Asakura M. Shintani Y. Liao Y. Minamino T. Asanuma H. Sanada S. Kim J. Ogai A. Fukushima T. Oikawa Y. Okazaki Y. Kaneda Y. Sato M. Miyazaki J. Kitamura S. Tomoike H. Kitakaze M. Hori M. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we found that endogenous HP1α separates into two peaks by fractionation using reverse-phase HPLC. To confirm this finding, we fractionated whole cell lysates from HEK293T cells using two-step column chromatography (Fig. 1A). Endogenous HP1α was eluted at a salt concentration ranging from 0.3 to 0.35 m on a Q-Sepharose anion-exchange column (Fig. 1D, top panel). We applied this single peak to a reverse-phase column. After elution with a fast gradient, HP1α was still detected as a single peak (Fig. 1D, 2nd panel). However, when eluted with a slow gradient, HP1α separated into two peaks representing a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic form (Fig. 1D, 3rd panel). Two other HP1α antibodies against different epitopes also detected both bands (data not shown), suggesting that these were biochemically different forms of HP1α. Even after direct fractionation of the nuclear extract, which includes the bulk of HP1α protein (Fig. 1B), endogenous HP1α showed a similar bimodal distribution (Fig. 1D, 4th panel). In other primary cells (HUVECs, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, and rat cardiac fibroblasts), similar bimodal peaks were observed (supplemental Fig. S1). In contrast, recombinant HP1α expressed in Escherichia coli (Fig. 1C) exhibited only one peak with elution characteristics similar to those of the hydrophilic peak under the same separating condition used for the endogenous protein (Fig. 1D, bottom panel). These data suggest that two different forms of HP1α endogenously exist in multiple cell types and that the late-eluted hydrophobic species may be a post-translationally modified form. To further elucidate the molecular characteristics of these two forms of HP1α, we used recombinant FLAG-tagged HP1α (HP1α-FLAG). As with endogenous HP1α, HP1α-FLAG existed mainly as a nuclear protein (Fig. 1E) and exhibited the same bimodal distribution after reverse-phase HPLC (Fig. 1F). Thus, we concluded that HP1α-FLAG undergoes the same modification as endogenous HP1α, validating the use of the tagged protein for further analysis. Initially, we attempted to detect the specific modification directly by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) (supplemental Fig. S2, A–C). Although we detected peptide masses from both fractions corresponding to ∼75% of the entire HP1α sequence (supplemental Fig. S2B), we did not detect any distinct features in the mass spectra under two different digestion conditions (trypsin or Asp-N) (supplemental Fig. S2C). We next tried to detect a modified residue by making multiple, stepwise mutations throughout the entire HP1α molecule. We hypothesized that HP1α-FLAG lacking the modified residue would fractionate into a single peak by reverse-phase HPLC. First, we thoroughly screened the CD and hinge region, both of which are reported to be post-translationally modified (17Lomberk G. Bensi D. Fernandez-Zapico M.E. Urrutia R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 22Ayoub N. Jeyasekharan A.D. Bernal J.A. Venkitaraman A.R. Nature. 2008; 453: 682-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). However, we could not determine any specific amino acid residue from the mutational analysis (supplemental Fig. S2D). Second, we screened the CSD (supplemental Fig. S2E) and found that a deletion mutant lacking residues 119–150 (Δ119–150) was eluted as a single peak. We further narrowed down the deleted sequence 119–150 and finally found that a mutant in which cysteine 133 (Cys-133) was replaced by alanine (C133A) was eluted as a single peak (Fig. 1G). These data suggest that the single cysteine 133 residue is responsible for the separation of the hydrophobic fraction of HP1α. Among post-translational modifications of cysteine, oxidation is a common feature. The thiol side chain can be oxidized to sulfenic acid (-SOH), sulfenyl amide (–SN), a disulfide bond (–SS–) or an irreversibly oxidized form (25D'Autréaux B. Toledano M.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). We examined the electrophoresis pattern of the two separated fractions of HP1α under nonreducing conditions and found that the hydrophobic form of HP1α shifted to a molecular weight twice its size, indicating that this HP1α formed a homodimer (Fig. 1H). In contrast, the mobility of the hydrophilic HP1α was unchanged. Because this dimer was nondissociable both under the strong acidic conditions of the reverse-phase HPLC and under the denaturing conditions during SDS-PAGE, it seemed to be linked by a covalent bond. Pretreatment with reducing agents, such as 2 mm DTT or 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol, completely abolished the hydrophobic fraction (Fig. 1I). Taken together, these data suggest that endogenous HP1α dimerizes by intermolecular disulfide bond formation via Cys-133. The sequence identity among the three HP1 isoforms is remarkably high (Fig. 2A), with up to 80% homology in the CSD. However, Cys-133 is specific to HP1α and is replaced by a serine in HP1β and HP1γ (highlighted in red in Fig. 2A). Therefore, we evaluated whether this oxidative modification was specific for HP1α. Endogenous HP1β was fractionated as a single peak by reverse-phase HPLC. However, endogenous HP1γ was isolated as two separate peaks (Fig. 2B). Both the hydrophilic and the hydrophobic fractions of HP1γ were eluted independently of those of HP1α suggesting that these two isoforms did not interact with each other during reverse-phase HPLC fractionation. Similar to HP1α, the hydrophobic form of HP1γ also dimerized (Fig. 2C). HP1β contains only two cysteines, both of which are conserved among the isoforms (Cys-59 and Cys-160 of HP1α; highlighted in blue in Fig. 2A). HP1γ has three cysteines, and one of the cysteines, Cys-177, is an isoform-specific residue located in the C terminus of the CSD. This residue is replaced by tyrosine in HP1α and HP1β (highlighted in red in Fig. 2A). Mutational analysis of these cysteine residues revealed that only isoform-specific Cys-133 of HP1α and Cys-177 of HP1γ were involved in dimerization (Fig. 2D). Mutating the corresponding residues of HP1β, Ser-129 (matched to Cys-133 of HP1α) or Tyr-173 (matched to Cys-177 of HP1γ), to cysteines created the late-eluted hydrophobic form (Fig. 2E). These hydrophobic forms of HP1β dimerized similarly with HP1α and HP1γ (Fig. 2F). The other two HP1β mutants, S141C and S162C, did not form disulfide bonds. Together, these data suggest that even though their overall structures are highly conserved, endogenous HP1α and HP1γ possess isoform-specific cysteine residues involved in the intermolecular disulfide bond formation. These two positions of the disulfide-linked cysteines are structurally sensitive to oxidation within the CSD. We tested whether the differences in the positions of the modified cysteine residues between HP1α and HP1γ influenced their sensitivity to oxidation in vitro. Under mild oxidative conditions, only a low level of dimerized HP1α was detected even after a long exposure to air oxidation (Fig. 3A, left panels). In contrast, under the same conditions, HP1γ was easily oxidized to form disulfide bonds (Fig. 3A, right panels). Treatment with DTT reversed the disulfide formation of HP1γ. These data indicate that HP1γ is more sensitive to oxidation and more readily forms a disulfide dimer in vitro. Using purified and oxidized HP1γ-FLAG, the intermolecular disulfide bond was confirmed by MALDI-TOF/MS analysis. The late-eluted dimerized fraction of HP1γ-FLAG was resolved by nonreducing SDS-PAGE, and the excised band was divided into two samples. One sample was reduced, carbamidomethylated with iodoacetamide, and digested by trypsin. The other sample was directly digested without pretreatment. The expected digested peptide, including Cys-177, consisted of the C terminus of HP1γ and lysine residue within the linker peptide (Fig. 3B). The mass spectrum peak of 3084.32, which was detected only in the nonreduced sample, corresponded to the estimated mass of the dimeric peptide connected by a disulfide bond via Cys-177 (3084.35) (Fig. 3C, upper panel). In contrast, the peak at 1600.68, which was detected only in the reduced sample, corresponded to the estimated mass of the monomeric peptide, including carbamidomethylated Cys-177 (1600.71) (Fig. 3C, lower panel). No other significant mass spectral peaks from the intermolecular disulfide bond were detected. We assessed whether this oxidative modification was promoted under in vivo oxidative conditions using a pro-oxidant agent, 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (menadione), which caused oxidative stress in cells (Fig. 4A) (26Oka S. Ohno M. Tsuchimoto D. Sakumi K. Furuichi M. Nakabeppu Y. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Menadione treatment caused a dose- and time-dependent increase in the disulfide bond formation of HP1γ in COS7 cells (Fig. 4B, left two panels). The disulfide dimerization of HP1γ was rapidly formed within minutes and was only formed via Cys-177 (Fig. 4C). The I165E mutation, which inhibits both noncovalent α-helix dimer formation and proper nuclear localization (6Brasher S.V. Smith B.O. Fogh R.H. Nietlispach D. Thiru A. Nielsen P.R. Broadhurst R.W. Ball L.J. Murzina N.V. Laue E.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1587-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 7Thiru A. Nietlispach D. Mott H.R. Okuwaki M. Lyon D. Nielsen P.R. Hirshberg M. Verreault A. Murzina N.V. Laue E.D. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), decreased, but not completely, the amount of disulfide dimers of HP1γ (supplemental Fig. S3A). These data suggest that the oxidative dimerization of HP1γ requires the proper localization and formation of constitutive, noncovalent dimers. In contrast to HP1γ, an increase in dimerized HP1α was not observed under the same in vivo oxidative conditions (Fig. 4B, right panel). The dimerized forms of HP1α and HP1γ under basal conditions were almost undetectable without using the large scale purification shown in Fig. 1 because of their relatively low abundance before oxidant treatment. Menadione treatment promoted HP1γ dimerization in various cells, but the extent of dimerization varied among cell types (supplemental Fig. S3B), suggesting that the reactivity of HP1γ to reactive oxygen species stimulation varied according to cell type. In each cell, an increase in dimerized HP1α was not observed (data not shown). These results demonstrate that there is a clear difference in oxidation sensitivity among HP1 family members. Although both HP1α and HP1γ have oxidation-sensitive cysteines in their sequences, HP1γ perceives oxidative conditions and is able to more readily form a disulfide dimer than HP1α. In HEK293T cells, the dimerized HP1γ was subsequently reduced to the monomer form after removal of the oxidant (Fig. 4D, upper panel), but HP1γ remained dimerized when continuously exposed to the oxidants (Fig. 4D, lower panel), suggesting that this oxidative modification was reversible. H2O2, known as an endogenous source of reactive oxygen species, also promoted dimerization of HP1γ (Fig. 4E). This effect of H2O2 was relatively weak in HEK293T cells when compared with the treatment of menadione. However, the same concentration of H2O2 substantially increased the amount of dimerized HP1γ in HUVECs (Fig. 4E, lower panel). Therefore, we further examined the molecular characteristics of the disulfide dimerization of HP1γ using HUVECs. The CSD of HP1, which includes Cys-177 at its C terminus, creates a binding surface for other proteins (27Cowieson N.P. Partridge J.F. Allshire R.C. McLaughlin P.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 517-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Therefore, disulfide modification of HP1γ may affect the interactions between HP1 and HP1-binding proteins. Because many candidate effectors that bind to HP1 exist (8Grewal S.I. Jia S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2007; 8: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar), we screened the interacting proteins of HP1γ under oxidative conditions using metabolically radiolabeled HUVECs expressing recombinant HP1γ-FLAG transduced with adenovirus. Among the co-immunoprecipitated proteins, one protein band was detected after treatment with H2O2 (Fig. 5A, arrowhead). The bound protein was purified and analyzed by MALDI-TOF/MS. The amino acid sequence of the digested peptides corresponded to TIF1β (also known as TRIM28 or KAP1), which is a universal co-repressor of gene transcription and is a well known interacting partner of HP1 (28Friedman J.R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4859-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that endogenous HP1γ strongly interacted with TIF1β in a dose-dependent manner after H2O2 treatment (Fig. 5B). TIF1β did not interact with HP1γ with a C177S mutation under oxidative conditions, suggesting that the disulfide bond formation of HP1γ enhanced the interaction of these proteins (Fig. 5C). When the oxidant was removed, TIF1β dissociated again from HP1γ, suggesting that this enhanced endogenous interaction was transient (Fig. 5D). Structurally, disulfide dimerization via Cys-177 is formed at the C terminus of the CSD, just adjacent to the binding interface for the PXVXL motif, which is a well characterized binding sequence in HP1-interacting proteins, including TIF1β (Fig. 5E) (7Thiru A. Nietlispach D. Mott H.R. Okuwaki M. Lyon D. Nielsen P.R. Hirshberg M. Verreault A. Murzina N.V. Laue E.D. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We next examined the localization changes of these proteins before and after oxidant treatment. No remarkable change in localization was detected by immunostaining (data not shown). However, biochemical analysis using Triton extraction verified the TIF1β translocation. HP1γ existed mainly in the Triton-insoluble chromatin component, whereas TIF1β was distributed both in the soluble and the insoluble components (Fig. 5F). Under oxidative conditions, HP1γ dimerized and was maintained in the insoluble components. Concomitant with HP1γ dimerization, the insoluble component of TIF1β transiently increased. The knockdown of endogenous HP1γ combined with the replacement by a C177S mutant of HP1γ inhibited the translocation of TIF1β, suggesting that HP1γ held TIF1β on chromatin only when oxidized via Cys-177 (Fig. 5G). These data suggest that the intracellular redox state is transduced to the conformational and localization change of the repressor complex via oxidative modification of HP1γ. To clarify whether the repression ability of TIF1β was promoted or inhibited when trapped by HP1γ under oxidative conditions, we used a GAL4-based transcriptional reporter assay. In HEK293T cells, menadione treatment promoted the disulfide dimerization of HP1γ and the interaction between HP1γ and TIF1β more prominently than H2O2 treatment (supplemental Fig. S3B and Figs. 4E and 6A). Therefore, we used menadione treatment for further analysis in HEK293T cells. We generated HEK293T cells stably expressing shRNA for HP1γ and shRNA-resistant recombinant FLAG-tagged HP1γ WT or C177S mutant. In these cells, endogenous HP1γ was almost completely depleted and was replaced by the dimerizable or undimerizable recombinant proteins (Fig. 6B). To evaluate the transcriptional repression ability of TIF1β, we transfected the plasmids encoding ERHBD-GAL4 as a control or ERHBD-GAL4-TIF1β fusion protein with the reporter plasmids in these cells (12Sripathy S.P.

The transcriptional regulatory activity of the ERHBD fusion protein is post-translationally controlled by the addition of 4-OHT to the culture medium (12Sripathy S.P. Stevens J. Schultz D.C. Mol.
