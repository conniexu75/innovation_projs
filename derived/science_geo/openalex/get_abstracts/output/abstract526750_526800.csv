https://openalex.org/W2044686824,"The ability to differentiate stimuli predicting positive or negative outcomes is critical for survival, and perturbations of emotional processing underlie many psychiatric disease states. Synaptic plasticity in the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA) mediates the acquisition of associative memories, both positive and negative. Different populations of BLA neurons may encode fearful or rewarding associations, but the identifying features of these populations and the synaptic mechanisms of differentiating positive and negative emotional valence have remained unknown. Here we show that BLA neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc projectors) or the centromedial amygdala (CeM projectors) undergo opposing synaptic changes following fear or reward conditioning. We find that photostimulation of NAc projectors supports positive reinforcement while photostimulation of CeM projectors mediates negative reinforcement. Photoinhibition of CeM projectors impairs fear conditioning and enhances reward conditioning. We characterize these functionally distinct neuronal populations by comparing their electrophysiological, morphological and genetic features. Overall, we provide a mechanistic explanation for the representation of positive and negative associations within the amygdala."
https://openalex.org/W2159172047,"The last glacial period exhibited abrupt Dansgaard-Oeschger climatic oscillations, evidence of which is preserved in a variety of Northern Hemisphere palaeoclimate archives. Ice cores show that Antarctica cooled during the warm phases of the Greenland Dansgaard-Oeschger cycle and vice versa, suggesting an interhemispheric redistribution of heat through a mechanism called the bipolar seesaw. Variations in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) strength are thought to have been important, but much uncertainty remains regarding the dynamics and trigger of these abrupt events. Key information is contained in the relative phasing of hemispheric climate variations, yet the large, poorly constrained difference between gas age and ice age and the relatively low resolution of methane records from Antarctic ice cores have so far precluded methane-based synchronization at the required sub-centennial precision. Here we use a recently drilled high-accumulation Antarctic ice core to show that, on average, abrupt Greenland warming leads the corresponding Antarctic cooling onset by 218 ± 92 years (2σ) for Dansgaard-Oeschger events, including the Bølling event; Greenland cooling leads the corresponding onset of Antarctic warming by 208 ± 96 years. Our results demonstrate a north-to-south directionality of the abrupt climatic signal, which is propagated to the Southern Hemisphere high latitudes by oceanic rather than atmospheric processes. The similar interpolar phasing of warming and cooling transitions suggests that the transfer time of the climatic signal is independent of the AMOC background state. Our findings confirm a central role for ocean circulation in the bipolar seesaw and provide clear criteria for assessing hypotheses and model simulations of Dansgaard-Oeschger dynamics."

https://openalex.org/W2001110762,"The lipophilic positively charged moiety of triphenylphosphonium (TPP+) has been used to target a range of biologically active compounds including antioxidants, spin-traps and other probes into mitochondria. The moiety itself, while often considered biologically inert, appears to influence mitochondrial metabolism.We used the Seahorse XF flux analyzer to measure the effect of a range of alkylTPP+ on cellular respiration and further analyzed their effect on mitochondrial membrane potential and the activity of respiratory complexes. We found that the ability of alkylTPP+ to inhibit the respiratory chain and decrease the mitochondrial membrane potential increases with the length of the alkyl chain suggesting that hydrophobicity is an important determinant of toxicity.More hydrophobic TPP+ derivatives can be expected to have a negative impact on mitochondrial membrane potential and respiratory chain activity in addition to the effect of the biologically active moiety attached to them. Using shorter linker chains or adding hydrophilic functional groups may provide a means to decrease this negative effect."
https://openalex.org/W2093547160,"Pannexin-1 (Panx1) is a large-pore membrane channel involved in the release of ATP and other signaling mediators. Little is known about the expression and functional role of Panx1 in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) in the development of chronic neuropathic pain. In this study, we determined the epigenetic mechanism involved in increased Panx1 expression in the DRG after nerve injury. Spinal nerve ligation in rats significantly increased the mRNA and protein levels of Panx1 in the DRG but not in the spinal cord. Immunocytochemical labeling showed that Panx1 was primarily expressed in a subset of medium and large DRG neurons in control rats and that nerve injury markedly increased the number of Panx1-immunoreactive DRG neurons. Nerve injury significantly increased the enrichment of two activating histone marks (H3K4me2 and H3K9ac) and decreased the occupancy of two repressive histone marks (H3K9me2 and H3K27me3) around the promoter region of Panx1 in the DRG. However, nerve injury had no effect on the DNA methylation level around the Panx1 promoter in the DRG. Furthermore, intrathecal injection of the Panx1 blockers or Panx1-specific siRNA significantly reduced pain hypersensitivity induced by nerve injury. In addition, siRNA knockdown of Panx1 expression in a DRG cell line significantly reduced caspase-1 release induced by neuronal depolarization. Our findings suggest that nerve injury increases Panx1 expression levels in the DRG through altered histone modifications. Panx1 up-regulation contributes to the development of neuropathic pain and stimulation of inflammasome signaling.Background: Pannexin-1 can release many signaling molecules, and blocking pannexin-1 at the spinal cord level reduces chronic pain.Results: Nerve injury increases pannexin-1 expression in primary sensory neurons via histone modifications.

https://openalex.org/W1986641223,"Migration and invasion are two crucial steps of tumor metastasis. Blockage of these steps may be an effective strategy to reduce the risk. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of diallyl trisulfide (DATS), a natural organosulfuric compound with most sulfur atoms found in garlic, on migration and invasion in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Molecular mechanisms underlying the anticancer effects of DATS were further investigated.MDA-MB-231 cells and HS 578t breast cancer cells were treated with different concentrations of DATS. DATS obviously suppressed the migration and invasion of two cell lines and changed the morphological. Moreover, DATS inhibited the mRNA/protein/ enzymes activities of MMP2/9 via attenuating the NF-κB pathway. DATS also inhibited ERK/MAPK rather than p38 and JNK.DATS inhibits MMP2/9 activity and the metastasis of TNBC cells, and emerges as a potential anti-cancer agent. The inhibitory effects are associated with down-regulation of the transcriptional activities of NF-κB and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2012135418,"The Galactic Centre hosts a puzzling stellar population in its inner few parsecs, with a high abundance of surprisingly young, relatively massive stars bound within the deep potential well of the central supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A* (ref. 1). Previous studies suggest that the population of objects emitting soft X-rays (less than 10 kiloelectronvolts) within the surrounding hundreds of parsecs, as well as the population responsible for unresolved X-ray emission extending along the Galactic plane, is dominated by accreting white dwarf systems. Observations of diffuse hard-X-ray (more than 10 kiloelectronvolts) emission in the inner 10 parsecs, however, have been hampered by the limited spatial resolution of previous instruments. Here we report the presence of a distinct hard-X-ray component within the central 4 × 8 parsecs, as revealed by subarcminute-resolution images in the 20-40 kiloelectronvolt range. This emission is more sharply peaked towards the Galactic Centre than is the surface brightness of the soft-X-ray population. This could indicate a significantly more massive population of accreting white dwarfs, large populations of low-mass X-ray binaries or millisecond pulsars, or particle outflows interacting with the surrounding radiation field, dense molecular material or magnetic fields. However, all these interpretations pose significant challenges to our understanding of stellar evolution, binary formation, and cosmic-ray production in the Galactic Centre."
https://openalex.org/W1997134216,"Recently the sonic hedgehog (shh) signaling pathway has been shown to play an important role in regulating repair and regenerative responses after brain injury, including ischemia. However, the precise cellular components that express and upregulate the shh gene and the cellular components that respond to shh signaling remain to be identified. In this study, using a distal MCA occlusion model, our data show that the shh signal is upregulated both at the cortical area near the injury site and in the adjacent striatum. Multiple cell types upregulate shh signaling in ischemic brain, including neurons, reactive astrocytes and nestin-expressing cells. The shh signaling pathway genes are also expressed in the neural stem cells (NSCs) niche in the subventricular zone (SVZ). Conditional deletion of the shh gene in nestin-expressing cells both at the SVZ niche and at the ischemic site lead to significantly more severe behavioral deficits in these shh iKO mice after cortical stroke, measured using an automated open field locomotion apparatus (Student's t-test, p<0.05). In contrast, animals given post-stroke treatment with the shh signaling agonist (SAG) demonstrated less deficits in behavioral function, compared to vehicle-treated mice. At 7 days after stroke, SAG-treated mice showed higher values in multiple horizontal movement parameters compared to vehicle treated mice (Student's t-test, p<0.05) whereas there were no differences in pre-stroke measurements, (Student's t-test, p>0.05). In summary, our data demonstrate that shh signaling plays critical and ongoing roles in response to ischemic injury and modulation of shh signaling in vivo alters the functional outcome after cortical ischemic injury."
https://openalex.org/W2008572855,"Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) have critical roles in maintaining homeostasis of intestinal epithelium. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is implicated in intestinal epithelium homeostasis and inflammatory bowel disease; however, it remains elusive whether IRE1α, a major sensor of ER stress, is directly involved in these processes. We demonstrate here that genetic ablation of Ire1α in IECs leads to spontaneous colitis in mice. Deletion of IRE1α in IECs results in loss of goblet cells and failure of intestinal epithelial barrier function. IRE1α deficiency induces cell apoptosis through induction of CHOP, the pro-apoptotic protein, and sensitizes cells to lipopolysaccharide, an endotoxin from bacteria. IRE1α deficiency confers upon mice higher susceptibility to chemical-induced colitis.

https://openalex.org/W2070344895,"The common cutworm, Spodoptera litura, has become a major pest of soybean (Glycine max) throughout its Indian range. With a changing climate, there is the potential for this insect to become an increasingly severe pest in certain regions due to increased habitat suitability. To examine this possibility, we developed temperature-based phenology model for S. litura, by constructing thermal reaction norms for cohorts of single life stages, at both constant and fluctuating temperatures within the ecologically relevant range (15-38°C) for its development. Life table parameters were estimated stochastically using cohort updating and rate summation approach. The model was implemented in the geographic information system to examine the potential future pest status of S. litura using temperature change projections from SRES A1B climate change scenario for the year 2050. The changes were visualized by means of three spatial indices demonstrating the risks for establishment, number of generations per year and pest abundance according to the temperature conditions. The results revealed that the development rate as a function of temperature increased linearly for all the immature stages of S. litura until approximately 34-36°C, after which it became non-linear. The extreme temperature of 38°C was found lethal to larval and pupal stages of S. litura wherein no development to the next stage occurred. Females could lay no eggs at the extreme low (15°C) and high (> 35°C) test temperatures, demonstrating the importance of optimum temperature in determining the suitability of climate for the mating and reproduction in S. litura. The risk mapping predicts that due to temperature increase under future climate change, much of the soybean areas in Indian states like Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan, will become suitable for S. litura establishment and increased pest activity, indicating the expansion of the suitable and favourable areas over time. This has serious implication in terms of soybean production since these areas produce approximately 95% of the total soybeans in India. As the present model results are based on temperature only, and the effects of other abiotic and biotic factors determining the pest population dynamics were excluded, it presents only the potential population growth parameters for S. litura. However, if combined with the field observations, the model results could certainly contribute to gaining insight into the field dynamics of S. litura."
https://openalex.org/W1964798322,"Dysregulated dopamine transmission in striatal circuitry is associated with impulsivity. The current study evaluated the influence of dopaminergic inputs to the dorsolateral striatum on impulsive choice, one aspect of impulsive behavior. We implemented an operant task that measures impulsive choice in rats via delay discounting wherein intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) was used as the positive reinforcer. To do so, rats were anesthetized to allow implanting of a stimulating electrode within the lateral hypothalamus of one hemisphere and bilateral dorsal striatal injections of the dopaminergic toxin, 6-OHDA (lesioned) or its vehicle (sham). Following recovery, rats were trained in a delay discounting task wherein they selected between a small ICSS current presented immediately after lever pressing, and a large ICSS current presented following a 0 to 15s delay upon pressing the alternate lever. Task acquisition and reinforcer discrimination were similar for lesioned and sham rats. All rats exhibited an initial preference for the large reinforcer, and as the delay was increased, preference for the large reinforcer was decreased indicating that the subjective value of the large reinforcer was discounted as a function of delay time. However, this discounting effect was significantly enhanced in lesioned rats for the longer delays. These data reveal a contribution of dopaminergic inputs to the dorsolateral striatum on impulsive choice behavior, and provide new insights into neural substrates underlying discounting behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2070919580,"The genetic etiology of hereditary breast cancer has not been fully elucidated. Although germline mutations of high-penetrance genes such as BRCA1/2 are implicated in development of hereditary breast cancers, at least half of all breast cancer families are not linked to these genes. To identify a comprehensive spectrum of genetic factors for hereditary breast cancer in a Chinese population, we performed an analysis of germline mutations in 2,165 coding exons of 152 genes associated with hereditary cancer using next-generation sequencing (NGS) in 99 breast cancer patients from families of cancer patients regardless of cancer types. Forty-two deleterious germline mutations were identified in 21 genes of 34 patients, including 18 (18.2%) BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, 3 (3%) TP53 mutations, 5 (5.1%) DNA mismatch repair gene mutations, 1 (1%) CDH1 mutation, 6 (6.1%) Fanconi anemia pathway gene mutations, and 9 (9.1%) mutations in other genes. Of seven patients who carried mutations in more than one gene, 4 were BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, and their average onset age was much younger than patients with only BRCA1/2 mutations. Almost all identified high-penetrance gene mutations in those families fulfill the typical phenotypes of hereditary cancer syndromes listed in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, except two TP53 and three mismatch repair gene mutations. Furthermore, functional studies of MSH3 germline mutations confirmed the association between MSH3 mutation and tumorigenesis, and segregation analysis suggested antagonism between BRCA1 and MSH3. We also identified a lot of low-penetrance gene mutations. Although the clinical significance of those newly identified low-penetrance gene mutations has not been fully appreciated yet, these new findings do provide valuable epidemiological information for the future studies. Together, these findings highlight the importance of genetic testing based on NCCN guidelines and a multi-gene analysis using NGS may be a supplement to traditional genetic counseling."
https://openalex.org/W1982523069,"Laurel wilt is a lethal disease of plants in the Lauraceae plant family, including avocado (Persea americana). This devastating disease has spread rapidly along the southeastern seaboard of the United States and has begun to affect commercial avocado production in Florida. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the potential to discriminate laurel wilt-affected avocado trees using aerial images taken with a modified camera during helicopter surveys at low-altitude in the commercial avocado production area. The ability to distinguish laurel wilt-affected trees from other factors that produce similar external symptoms was also studied. RmodGB digital values of healthy trees and laurel wilt-affected trees, as well as fruit stress and vines covering trees were used to calculate several vegetation indices (VIs), band ratios, and VI combinations. These indices were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) and an M-statistic was performed in order to quantify the separability of those classes. Significant differences in spectral values among laurel wilt affected and healthy trees were observed in all vegetation indices calculated, although the best results were achieved with Excess Red (ExR), (Red-Green) and Combination 1 (COMB1) in all locations. B/G showed a very good potential for separate the other factors with symptoms similar to laurel wilt-affected trees, such as fruit stress and vines covering trees, from laurel wilt-affected trees. These consistent results prove the usefulness of using a modified camera (RmodGB) to discriminate laurel wilt-affected avocado trees from healthy trees, as well as from other factors that cause the same symptoms and suggest performing the classification in further research. According to our results, ExR and B/G should be utilized to develop an algorithm or decision rules to classify aerial images, since they showed the highest capacity to discriminate laurel wilt-affected trees. This methodology may allow the rapid detection of laurel wilt-affected trees using low altitude aerial images and be a valuable tool in mitigating this important threat to Florida avocado production."

This cleavage not only releases the regulatory growth factor, but it is also the required first step for the subsequent processing by γ-secretase and the release of gene regulatory intracellular fragments.

Ectodomain cleavage occurs, however, on the outside of the plasma membrane and is carried out by membrane-bound metalloproteases.

Proteolytic processing of transmembrane proteins yields a number of regulatory molecules with significance for the organism (e.g. growth factors, cytokines, decoy receptors, or nuclear transcription factors). Ectodomain cleavage by membrane-bound metalloproteases represents the initiating step required for the subsequent processing by γ-secretase and the release of the intracellular fragment.

But how is this ligand-induced signal transfer through the membrane accomplished? An interesting early proposal assumed that the ligand triggers rotation of one receptor monomer relative to the other (16Gadella Jr., T.W. Jovin T.M.

Very recent NMR and molecular simulation data of the EGF receptor propose a ligand-induced change in the orientation of the transmembrane helices relative to each other, a process that affects the positioning of juxtamembrane sections of the dimer at the inner side of the plasma membrane, allowing phosphorylation and activation of the receptor (23Endres N.F.

Could such outside-in signaling be a model for signaling in the opposite direction, as needed here for the inside-out signal transfer along ADAM substrates, and similar to that previously described for integrin heterodimers (25Hynes R.O. Integrins: bidirectional, allosteric signaling machines.Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6870) Google Scholar)? One prediction of this model would be that two single-pass transmembrane molecules (including the substrate) needed to change their position relative to each other, allowing cleavage. We have tested this prediction by exploring ectodomain cleavage of the ADAM10 substrate CD44 (an adhesion molecule and stem cell marker) and the ADAM17 substrate NRG1 (proform of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor ligand neuregulin). When bound to hyaluronan, CD44 triggers a proliferation-inhibitory pathway (26Jin H. Sperka T. Herrlich P. Morrison H.

https://openalex.org/W1972691589,"The topological organization underlying brain networks has been extensively investigated using resting-state fMRI, focusing on the low frequency band from 0.01 to 0.1 Hz. However, the frequency specificities regarding the corresponding brain networks remain largely unclear. In the current study, a data-driven method named complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) was introduced to separate the time series of each voxel into several intrinsic oscillation rhythms with distinct frequency bands. Our data indicated that the whole brain BOLD signals could be automatically divided into five specific frequency bands. After applying the CEEMD method, the topological patterns of these five temporally correlated networks were analyzed. The results showed that global topological properties, including the network weighted degree, network efficiency, mean characteristic path length and clustering coefficient, were observed to be most prominent in the ultra-low frequency bands from 0 to 0.015 Hz. Moreover, the saliency of small-world architecture demonstrated frequency-density dependency. Compared to the empirical mode decomposition method (EMD), CEEMD could effectively eliminate the mode-mixing effects. Additionally, the robustness of CEEMD was validated by the similar results derived from a split-half analysis and a conventional frequency division method using the rectangular window band-pass filter. Our findings suggest that CEEMD is a more effective method for extracting the intrinsic oscillation rhythms embedded in the BOLD signals than EMD. The application of CEEMD in fMRI data analysis will provide in-depth insight in investigations of frequency specific topological patterns of the dynamic brain networks."
https://openalex.org/W2121340693,"The value of no-take marine reserves as fisheries-management tools is controversial, particularly in high-poverty areas where human populations depend heavily on fish as a source of protein. Spillover, the net export of adult fish, is one mechanism by which no-take marine reserves may have a positive influence on adjacent fisheries. Spillover can contribute to poverty alleviation, although its effect is modulated by the number of fishermen and fishing intensity. In this study, we quantify the effects of a community-managed marine reserve in a high poverty area of Northern Mozambique. For this purpose, underwater visual censuses of reef fish were undertaken at three different times: 3 years before (2003), at the time of establishment (2006) and 6 years after the marine reserve establishment (2012). The survey locations were chosen inside, outside and on the border of the marine reserve. Benthic cover composition was quantified at the same sites in 2006 and 2012. After the reserve establishment, fish sizes were also estimated. Regression tree models show that the distance from the border and the time after reserve establishment were the variables with the strongest effect on fish abundance. The extent and direction of the spillover depends on trophic group and fish size. Poisson Generalized Linear Models show that, prior to the reserve establishment, the survey sites did not differ but, after 6 years, the abundance of all fish inside the reserve has increased and caused spillover of herbivorous fish. Spillover was detected 1 km beyond the limit of the reserve for small herbivorous fishes. Six years after the establishment of a community-managed reserve, the fish assemblages have changed dramatically inside the reserve, and spillover is benefitting fish assemblages outside the reserve."
https://openalex.org/W1994997758,"The order Mysida (2 families, 178 genera, 1132 species) contains species across a broad range of habitats, such as subterranean, fresh, brackish, coastal, and surface to deep-sea habitats. The Stygiomysida (2 families, 2 genera, 16 species), however, are found primarily in subterranean waters, but always in waters with a marine influence. The Mysida and Stygiomysida body is divided into three main regions: cephalon, thorax, and abdomen. They are shrimp-like in appearance, containing morphological features earlier referred to as defining a ""caridoid facies"". The shrimp-like morphology was to some extent diagnostic for the historic Decapod taxon Schizopoda, containing the Nebalia, Mysida, Lophogastrida, and Euphausiacea. In 1904 the concept of Schizopoda was abandoned, and the Mysidacea (Mysida and Lophogastrida) along with Cumacea, Amphipoda, Isopoda, and Tanaidacea were placed in a new taxon, the Peracarida. Later discoveries of groundwater mysids led to the establishment of Stygiomysida, but placement to either Lophogastrida or Mysida remained unclear. The presence of oostegites and absence of podobranchiae, coupled with non-statocyst bearing uropods have been used to classify the Stygiomysida as a primitive Mysida family, comparable to Petalophthalmidae. On the other hand, equally suggestive characters, but for a Lophogastrida affiliation, was suggested for the archaic foregut characters and again, non-statocyst bearing uropods. With the inclusion of DNA sequence data of ribosomal genes, sister group relationships between Stygiomysida, Lophogastrida, and Mictacea within the Peracarida are observed, which supports a classification of the Stygiomysida as a separate order removed from the Mysida."
https://openalex.org/W2081094339,"The sodium-glucose-cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor dapagliflozin (DAPA) induces glucosuria and osmotic diuresis via inhibition of renal glucose reabsorption. Since increased diuresis retards the progression of polycystic kidney disease (PKD), we investigated the effect of DAPA in the PCK rat model of PKD. DAPA (10 mg/kg/d) or vehicle was administered by gavage to 6 week old male PCK rats (n=9 per group). Renal function, albuminuria, kidney weight and cyst volume were assessed after 6 weeks of treatment. Treatment with DAPA markedly increased glucose excretion (23.6 ± 4.3 vs 0.3 ± 0.1 mmol/d) and urine output (57.3 ± 6.8 vs 19.3 ± 0.8 ml/d). DAPA-treated PCK rats had higher clearances for creatinine (3.1 ± 0.1 vs 2.6 ± 0.2 ml/min) and BUN (1.7 ± 0.1 vs 1.2 ± 0.1 ml/min) after 3 weeks, and developed a 4-fold increase in albuminuria. Ultrasound imaging and histological analysis revealed a higher cyst volume and a 23% higher total kidney weight after 6 weeks of DAPA treatment. At week 6 the renal cAMP content was similar between DAPA and vehicle, and staining for Ki67 did not reveal an increase in cell proliferation. In conclusion, the inhibition of glucose reabsorption with the SGLT2-specific inhibitor DAPA caused osmotic diuresis, hyperfiltration, albuminuria and an increase in cyst volume in PCK rats. The mechanisms which link glucosuria to hyperfiltration, albuminuria and enhanced cyst volume in PCK rats remain to be elucidated."
https://openalex.org/W1979041511,"Introduction Burst-suppression (BS) is an electroencephalography (EEG) pattern consisting of alternant periods of slow waves of high amplitude (burst) and periods of so called flat EEG (suppression). It is generally associated with coma of various etiologies (hypoxia, drug-related intoxication, hypothermia, and childhood encephalopathies, but also anesthesia). Animal studies suggest that both the cortex and the thalamus are involved in the generation of BS. However, very little is known about mechanisms of BS in humans. The aim of this study was to identify the neuronal network underlying both burst and suppression phases using source reconstruction and analysis of functional and effective connectivity in EEG. Material/Methods Dynamic imaging of coherent sources (DICS) was applied to EEG segments of 13 neonates and infants with burst and suppression EEG pattern. The brain area with the strongest power in the analyzed frequency (1–4 Hz) range was defined as the reference region. DICS was used to compute the coherence between this reference region and the entire brain. The renormalized partial directed coherence (RPDC) was used to describe the informational flow between the identified sources. Results/Conclusion Delta activity during the burst phases was associated with coherent sources in the thalamus and brainstem as well as bilateral sources in cortical regions mainly frontal and parietal, whereas suppression phases were associated with coherent sources only in cortical regions. Results of the RPDC analyses showed an upwards informational flow from the brainstem towards the thalamus and from the thalamus to cortical regions, which was absent during the suppression phases. These findings may support the theory that a “cortical deafferentiation” between the cortex and sub-cortical structures exists especially in suppression phases compared to burst phases in burst suppression EEGs. Such a deafferentiation may play a role in the poor neurological outcome of children with these encephalopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2070357222,"To evaluate the prognostic value of gross tumor volume (TV) in patients with locally recurrent, nonmetastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma.Between 2001 and 2012, 291 consecutive patients with locally recurrent, nonmetastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma underwent salvage IMRT were retrospectively reviewed. The correlations between TV and recurrent T classification were analyzed. Survival analyses were performed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated to identify cut-off point of TV. The Akaike information criterion and Harrell's concordance index (c-index) were utilized to test the prognostic value.The median TV significantly increased with advancing recurrent T classification (P<0.001). The 5-year overall survival rate was 33.2% for the entire cohort. On multivariate analysis, TV was an independent negative prognostic factor for distant metastasis-free survival (hazard ratio =1.013, P =0.003), overall survival (hazard ratio = 1.015, P<0.001) and toxicity-related death (hazard ratio = 1.014, P<0.001). The 5-year overall survival rates were 63.1% and 20.8% for patients with a TV < 22 cm3 and TV ≥22 cm3, respectively (P < 0.001). In patient with TV <22 cm3, locoregional failure is the leading cause of death. In patients with TV≥22 cm3, distant metastasis rate is higher and occurred within short term after local recurrence; meanwhile, radiation-induced injuries became more common and led to half of deaths in this group. The Akaike information criterion and c-index analyses indicated that the predictive ability of recurrent T classification improved when combined with TV.Our data suggests TV is a significant prognostic factor for predicting the distant metastasis, overall survival and toxicity-related death of patients with locally recurrent, nonmetastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma after salvage IMRT. TV should be considered when designing personalized salvage treatments for these patients. For patients with bulky local recurrent tumor, radiation may need to be de-emphasized in favor of systemic treatment or best supportive care."
https://openalex.org/W2020874911,"The number of cotton (Gossypium sp.) ovule epidermal cells differentiating into fiber initials is an important factor affecting cotton yield and fiber quality. Despite extensive efforts in determining the molecular mechanisms regulating fiber initial differentiation, only a few genes responsible for fiber initial differentiation have been discovered. To identify putative genes directly involved in the fiber initiation process, we used a cotton ovule culture technique that controls the timing of fiber initial differentiation by exogenous phytohormone application in combination with comparative expression analyses between wild type and three fiberless mutants. The addition of exogenous auxin and gibberellins to pre-anthesis wild type ovules that did not have visible fiber initials increased the expression of genes affecting auxin, ethylene, ABA and jasmonic acid signaling pathways within 1 h after treatment. Most transcripts expressed differentially by the phytohormone treatment in vitro were also differentially expressed in the ovules of wild type and fiberless mutants that were grown in planta. In addition to MYB25-like, a gene that was previously shown to be associated with the differentiation of fiber initials, several other differentially expressed genes, including auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (AUX/IAA) involved in auxin signaling, ACC oxidase involved in ethylene biosynthesis, and abscisic acid (ABA) 8'-hydroxylase an enzyme that controls the rate of ABA catabolism, were co-regulated in the pre-anthesis ovules of both wild type and fiberless mutants. These results support the hypothesis that phytohormonal signaling networks regulate the temporal expression of genes responsible for differentiation of cotton fiber initials in vitro and in planta."
https://openalex.org/W2034202001,"Mathematical descriptions of classical particle size distribution (PSD) data are often used to estimate soil hydraulic properties. Laser diffraction methods (LDM) now provide more detailed PSD measurements, but deriving a function to characterize the entire range of particle sizes is a major challenge. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of eighteen PSD functions for fitting LDM data sets from a wide range of soil textures. These models include five lognormal models, five logistic models, four van Genuchten models, two Fredlund models, a logarithmic model, and an Andersson model. The fits were evaluated using Akaike's information criterion (AIC), adjusted R2, and root-mean-square error (RMSE). The results indicated that the Fredlund models (FRED3 and FRED4) had the best performance for most of the soils studied, followed by one logistic growth function extension model (MLOG3) and three lognormal models (ONLG3, ORLG3, and SHCA3). The performance of most PSD models was better for soils with higher silt content and poorer for soils with higher clay and sand content. The FRED4 model best described the PSD of clay, silty clay, clay loam, silty clay loam, silty loam, loam, and sandy loam, whereas FRED3, MLOG3, ONLG3, ORLG3, and SHCA3 showed better performance for most soils studied."
https://openalex.org/W2021637688,"Release of conserved cytoplasmic proteins is widely spread among Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Because these proteins display additional functions when located at the bacterial surface, they have been qualified as moonlighting proteins. The GAPDH is a glycolytic enzyme which plays an important role in the virulence processes of pathogenic microorganisms like bacterial invasion and host immune system modulation. However, GAPDH, like other moonlighting proteins, cannot be secreted through active secretion systems since they do not contain an N-terminal predicted signal peptide. In this work, we investigated the mechanism of GAPDH export and surface retention in Streptococcus pneumoniae, a major human pathogen. We addressed the role of the major autolysin LytA in the delivery process of GAPDH to the cell surface. Pneumococcal lysis is abolished in the ΔlytA mutant strain or when 1% choline chloride is added in the culture media. We showed that these conditions induce a marked reduction in the amount of surface-associated GAPDH. These data suggest that the presence of GAPDH at the surface of pneumococcal cells depends on the LytA-mediated lysis of a fraction of the cell population. Moreover, we demonstrated that pneumococcal GAPDH binds to the bacterial cell wall independently of the presence of the teichoic acids component, supporting peptidoglycan as a ligand to surface GAPDH. Finally, we showed that peptidoglycan-associated GAPDH recruits C1q from human serum but does not activate the complement pathway."

However, the tumor suppressive affects of γ-catenin were not fully understood. In this study, we have identified a novel role for the affects of γ-catenin on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell migration. Expression of γ-catenin in NSCLC cells resulted in reduced cell migration as determined by both scratch assays and trans-well cell migration assays. Moreover, the affects of γ-catenin on cell migration were observed to be p53-dependent. Mechanistically, the anti-migratory effects seen via γ-catenin were driven by the expression of hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor Type I (HAI-1 or SPINT-1), an upstream inhibitor of the c-MET signaling pathway. Furthermore, the re-expression of γ-catenin sensitized NSCLC cells to c-MET inhibitor-mediated growth inhibition. Taken together, we identify γ-catenin as a novel regulator of HAI-1, which is a critical regulator of HGF/c-MET signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2140124626,"Innate attraction and aversion to odorants are observed throughout the animal kingdom, but how olfactory circuits encode such valences is not well understood, despite extensive anatomical and functional knowledge. In Drosophila melanogaster, ~50 types of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) each express a unique receptor gene, and relay information to a cognate type of projection neurons (PNs). To examine the extent to which the population activity of ORNs is required for olfactory behavior, we developed a genetic strategy to block all ORN outputs, and then to restore output in specific types. Unlike attraction, aversion was unaffected by simultaneous silencing of many ORNs, and even single ORN types previously shown to convey neutral valence sufficed to mediate aversion. Thus, aversion may rely on specific activity patterns in individual ORNs rather than the number or identity of activated ORNs. ORN activity is relayed into the brain by downstream circuits, with excitatory PNs (ePN) representing a major output. We found that silencing the majority of ePNs did not affect aversion, even when ePNs directly downstream of single restored ORN types were silenced. Our data demonstrate the robustness of olfactory aversion, and suggest that its circuit mechanism is qualitatively different from attraction."

https://openalex.org/W2047478124,"Contaminations of cell cultures with microbiological organisms are well documented and can be managed in cell culture laboratories applying reliable detection, elimination and prevention strategies. However, the presence of viral contaminations in cell cultures is still a matter of debate and cannot be determined with general detection methods. In the present study we screened 577 human cell lines for the presence of murine leukemia viruses (MLV). Nineteen cell lines were found to be contaminated with MLV, including 22RV1 which is contaminated with the xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus variant of MLV. Of these, 17 cell lines were shown to produce active retroviruses determined by product enhanced reverse transcriptase PCR assay for reverse transcriptase activity. The contaminated cell lines derive from various solid tumor types as well as from leukemia and lymphoma types. A contamination of primary human cells from healthy volunteers could not be substantiated. Sequence analyses of 17 MLV PCR products and five complete MLV genomes of different infected cell lines revealed at least three groups of related MLV genotypes. The viruses harvested from the supernatants of infected cell cultures were infectious to uninfected cell cultures. In the course of the study we found that contamination of human genomic DNA preparations with murine DNA can lead to false-positive results. Presumably, xenotransplantations of the human tumor cells into immune-deficient mice to determine the tumorigenicity of the cells are mainly responsible for the MLV contaminations. Furthermore, the use of murine feeder layer cells during the establishment of human cell lines and a cross-contamination with MLV from infected cultures might be sources of infection. A screening of cell cultures for MLV contamination is recommended given a contamination rate of 3.3%."
https://openalex.org/W2088850629,"Rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) latex, the source of natural rubber, is synthesised in the cytoplasm of laticifers. Efficient water inflow into laticifers is crucial for latex flow and production since it is the determinant of the total solid content of latex and its fluidity after tapping. As the mature laticifer vessel rings are devoid of plasmodesmata, water exchange between laticifers and surrounding cells is believed to be governed by plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIPs). To identify the most important PIP aquaporin in the water balance of laticifers, the transcriptional profiles of ten-latex-expressed PIPs were analysed. One of the most abundant transcripts, designated HbPIP2;3, was characterised in this study. When tested in Xenopus laevis oocytes HbPIP2;3 showed a high efficiency in increasing plasmalemma water conductance. Expression analysis indicated that the HbPIP2;3 gene was preferentially expressed in latex, and the transcripts were up-regulated by both wounding and exogenously applied Ethrel (a commonly-used ethylene releaser). Although regular tapping up-regulated the expression of HbPIP2;3 during the first few tappings of the virginal rubber trees, the transcriptional kinetics of HbPIP2;3 to Ethrel stimulation in the regularly tapped tree exhibited a similar pattern to that of the previously reported HbPIP2;1 in the virginal rubber trees. Furthermore, the mRNA level of HbPIP2;3 was associated with clonal yield potential and the Ethrel stimulation response. Together, these results have revealed the central regulatory role of HbPIP2;3 in laticifer water balance and ethylene stimulation of latex production in Hevea."

Genomic DNA from S. acidiphila was isolated from bacterial 1.5-ml cultures using a DNA isolation kit for cells and tissues (Roche). ORFs of 12 candidate genes (Table 1) were amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using XL polymerase (Applied Biosystems) and the oligonucleotide primers listed in Table 1.

Nucleotide sequences of the constructs were confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Eurofins Medigenomix, Ebersberg, Germany). The resulting plasmids (Table 1) were transformed into an OL-forming E. coli BL21(DE3) derivative. To construct this E. coli host, the olsF gene from S. proteamaculans was subcloned as an NdeI/BamHI fragment from pET9a-OlsF into pCDF-Duet1 (Novagen) (1.Vences-Guzmán M.A. Guan Z.

In the early exponential growth phase (A620 of 0.3), 1-ml aliquots of S. acidiphila cultures were labeled with 1 μCi of [14C]acetate for 48 h or 1 μCi of [14C]ornithine for 24 h. Cells were harvested, and lipids were extracted (15.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. A rapid method of total lipid extraction and purification.Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42689) Google Scholar). Radioactive lipids were analyzed as described earlier. A S. acidiphila culture (1 liter) was grown for 1 week in liquid M31 medium (final A620 of 1.2). Cells were harvested, and lipids were extracted (15.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. A rapid method of total lipid extraction and purification.Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42689) Google Scholar). E. coli strains BL21(DE3)·pLysS·pCDF-OlsF·pET17b and BL21(DE3)·pLysS·pCDF-OlsF·pET17b-OlsG were grown in 500-ml cultures. IPTG inductions and lipid extractions were performed as described earlier. Aliquots of lipid extracts were analyzed on an Agilent 1200 series HPLC system coupled to an Agilent 6520 Accurate-mass quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization interface. The system was operated in positive ion mode with a scan range of 500–2000 m/z in full scan MS and 100–2000 m/z during MS/MS experiments. Chromatographic separation was performed on a Waters Acquity UPLC BEH Amide column (3.5 μm, 2.1 × 150 mm) with a guard column of the same packing material. The solvent system at the start of the run was composed of 99% eluent A (acetonitrile:dichloromethane:NH3(aq):HCOOH, 75:25:0.01:0.01, v/v/v/v) and 1% eluent B (methanol:water:NH3(aq):HCOOH, 50:50:0.4:0.4, v/v/v/v). At 4 min eluent B was increased to 5%, at 22.5 min eluent B was increased to 25%, and at 26.5 min eluent B was increased to 50%. These conditions were held for 1 min before returning to the initial conditions for 8 min. Column temperature was held constant at 40 °C (17.Wörmer L. Lipp J.S. Schröder J.M. Hinrichs K.U.

A series of 12 cultures of 1 ml were induced with 0.2 mm IPTG at an A620 of 0.3 and labeled with 1 μCi of [14C]ornithine, respectively. Cultures were incubated for further 4 h, cells were harvested, and lipids were extracted (15.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. A rapid method of total lipid extraction and purification.Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42689) Google Scholar). Concentrated lipid preparations were separated by one-dimensional TLC using chloroform-methanol-water (14:6:1, v/v/v) as a mobile phase. [14C]OLs were detected by exposition of the TLC plate to a PhosphorImager screen, and silica containing radiolabeled OL was scraped off the TLC plates. OL was extracted from the silica (15.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. A rapid method of total lipid extraction and purification.Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42689) Google Scholar). Radioactivity present in the recovered OL was determined by liquid scintillation. Aliquots of [14C]ornithine-OL and dilutions derived thereof were run on TLC. The amount of OL present in the lipid solution was determined by comparing the ninhydrin staining of OL to the ninhydrin staining of a known l-alanine standard. BL21(DE3)·pLysS cells harboring pET17b-OlsG or pET17b were inoculated into 1 liter of LB medium from a fresh overnight culture. At an A620 of 0.3, IPTG (0.2 mm) was added to induce gene expression. After 4 h of induction cells were harvested by centrifugation, and cell-free extracts were prepared as described previously (16.de Rudder K.E. Thomas-Oates J.E. Geiger O. Rhizobium meliloti mutants deficient in phospholipid N-methyltransferase still contain phosphatidylcholine.J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6921-6928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8. The protein concentration in the cell-free protein extracts was determined (19.Dulley J.R. Grieve P.A. A simple technique for eliminating interference by detergents in the Lowry method of protein determination.Anal. Biochem. 1975; 64: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained, in a volume of 50 μl in Eppendorf tubes, 50 μg of protein; 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 1000 cpm of radiolabeled OL equivalent to 80 μm of OL, 5 mm S-adenosylmethionine (SAM; Sigma), and 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100. Reaction mixtures were incubated in a water bath at 28 °C for 60 min. Reactions were stopped by adding 188 μl of methanol:chloroform (2:1, v/v). Addition of 63 μl of chloroform and 63 μl of water led to phase separation. Lipids in the chloroform phase were separated by one-dimensional TLC using n-propanol-propionic acid-chloroform-water (3:2:2:1, v/v/v/v). Variations to the standard assay were time (0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 180, or 1200 min); final SAM concentration (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1, 2.5, 5, or 10 mm); final Triton X-100 concentration (0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.1 0.2, or 0.4%, w/v); and pH and buffer (50 mm BisTris/HCl, pH 6, 6.5, 7.0 or 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, or 9). Radiolabeled phosphatidylethanolamine was used as potential substrate in the standard assay replacing [14C]OL in some cases. Radiolabeled lipids were quantified using a PhosphorImager. The maximum reaction velocity (Vmax) and the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) for SAM were calculated using a nonlinear regression curve fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation (20.Ritchie R.J. Prvan T. Current statistical methods for estimating the K-m and V-max of Michaelis-Menten kinetics.Biochem. Educ. 1996; 24: 196-206Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar), using the GraphPad Prism® software program version 5.0. Averages and standard deviations were calculated from three independent measurements. The statistical certainty of the Km and Vmax values was determined. Amino acid sequences of putative bacterial SAM-dependent N-methyltransferases were retrieved with BLAST using the amino acid sequences of OlsG from S. acidiphila and PmtA from S. meliloti (21.de Rudder K.E.

A multiple sequence alignment was constructed with MAFFT (25.Katoh K. Toh H. Recent developments in the MAFFT multiple sequence alignment program.Brief Bioinform. 2008; 9: 286-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2866) Google Scholar), using the BLOSUM62 substitution matrix, a gap open penalty of 2.2, and a gap extension penalty of 0.05. The poorly conserved edges of the alignment were trimmed with Jalview (26.Waterhouse A.M. Procter J.B. Martin D.M. Clamp M. Barton G.J.

The phylogenetic tree was constructed with PhyML 3.0 (27.Guindon S. Dufayard J.F. Lefort V. Anisimova M. Hordijk W. Gascuel O.

To evaluate branch support, the approximate likelihood-ratio test statistic with the SH-like interpretation was calculated. Recently, the presence of N-methylated OL derivatives has been described in a few planctomycetes (11.Moore E.K. Hopmans E.C. Rijpstra W.I. Villanueva L. Dedysh S.N. Kulichevskaya I.S. Wienk H.

Microbiol. 2013; 79: 6874-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). First, we wanted to confirm the presence of methylated OLs in S. acidiphila. S. acidiphila was grown in M31 liquid medium, and lipids were labeled with [14C]acetate or [14C]ornithine. A TLC analysis of S. acidiphila lipid extracts revealed a complex membrane lipid composition (Fig. 1). Based on the relative mobility of the lipids and the previously published S. acidiphila lipid composition (11.Moore E.K. Hopmans E.C. Rijpstra W.I. Villanueva L. Dedysh S.N. Kulichevskaya I.S.

Microbiol. 2013; 79: 6874-6884Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we tentatively assigned the lipid spots (Fig. 1). [14C]Ornithine was specifically incorporated into three lipids, which based on their mobility were assigned as OL, dimethyl-OL (DMOL), and trimethyl-OL (TMOL) (data not shown). Confirmation of the different methylated OL structures was later also obtained by LC-MS (see Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Confirmation of TM-OL structures by HPLC-MS.

https://openalex.org/W2059373565,"In the past decade the number of studies investigating temperament in farm animals has increased greatly because temperament has been shown not only to affect handling but also reproduction, health and economically important production traits. However, molecular pathways underlying temperament and molecular pathways linking temperament to production traits, health and reproduction have yet to be studied in full detail. Here we report the results of metabolite profiling of the prefrontal cortex and serum of cattle with distinct temperament types that were performed to further explore their molecular divergence in the response to the slaughter procedure and to identify new targets for further research of cattle temperament. By performing an untargeted comprehensive metabolite profiling, 627 and 1097 metabolite features comprising 235 and 328 metabolites could be detected in the prefrontal cortex and serum, respectively. In total, 54 prefrontal cortex and 51 serum metabolite features were indicated to have a high relevance in the classification of temperament types by a sparse partial least square discriminant analysis. A clear discrimination between fearful/neophobic-alert, interested-stressed, subdued/uninterested-calm and outgoing/neophilic-alert temperament types could be observed based on the abundance of the identified relevant prefrontal cortex and serum metabolites. Metabolites with high relevance in the classification of temperament types revealed that the main differences between temperament types in the response to the slaughter procedure were related to the abundance of glycerophospholipids, fatty acyls and sterol lipids. Differences in the abundance of metabolites related to C21 steroid metabolism and oxidative stress indicated that the differences in the metabolite profiles of the four extreme temperament types could be the result of a temperament type specific regulation of molecular pathways that are known to be involved in the stress and fear response."
https://openalex.org/W2052432097,"Despite their potential vulnerability to contaminants from exposure at multiple life stages, amphibians are one of the least studied groups of vertebrates in ecotoxicology, and research on radiation effects in amphibians is scarce. We used multiple endpoints to assess the radiosensitivity of the southern toad (Anaxyrus [Bufo] terrestris) during its pre-terrestrial stages of development -embryonic, larval, and metamorphic. Toads were exposed, from several hours after oviposition through metamorphosis (up to 77 days later), to four low dose rates of 137Cs at 0.13, 2.4, 21, and 222 mGy d-1, resulting in total doses up to 15.8 Gy. Radiation treatments did not affect hatching success of embryos, larval survival, or the length of the larval period. The individual family variation in hatching success of embryos was larger than the radiation response. In contrast, newly metamorphosed individuals from the higher dose-rate treatments had higher mass and mass/length body indices, a measure which may relate to higher post-metamorphic survival. The increased mass and index at higher dose rates may indicate that the chronic, low dose rate radiation exposures triggered secondary responses. Additionally, the increases in growth were linked to a decrease in DNA damage (as measured by the Comet Assay) in red blood cells at a dose rate of 21 mGy d-1 and a total dose of 1.1 Gy. In conclusion, the complex effects of low dose rates of ionizing radiation may trigger growth and cellular repair mechanisms in amphibian larvae."
https://openalex.org/W2076919119,"Hyaluronidases are groups of enzymes that degrade hyaluronic acid (HA). To stop enzymatic hydrolysis we modified testicular hyaluronidase (HYAL) by activated polyethylene oxide with the help of electron-beam synthesis. As a result we received pegylated hyaluronidase (pegHYAL). Spiperone is a selective D2 dopamine receptor antagonist. It was demonstrated on the model of a single bleomycin damage of alveolar epithelium that during the inflammatory phase monotherapy by pegHYAL or spiperone reduced the populations of hematopoietic stem /progenitor cells in the lung parenchyma. PegHYAL also reduced the levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in the serum and lungs, while spiperone reduced the level of the serum IL-1β. Polytherapy by spiperone and pegHYAL caused the increase of the quantity of hematopoietic stem/ progenitor cells in the lungs. Such an influx of blood cell precursors was observed on the background of considerable fall level of TGF-β and the increase level of TNF-α in the serum and lungs. These results show pegHYAL reduced the bleomycin-induced fibrosis reaction (production and accumulation of collagen) in the lung parenchyma. This effect was observed at a single and repetitive bleomycin damage of alveolar epithelium, the antifibrotic activity of pegHYAL surpassing the activity of testicular HYAL. The antifibrotic effect of pegHYAL is enhanced by an additional instillation of spiperone. Therapy by pegHYAL causes the flow of CD31‒ CD34‒ CD45‒ CD44+ CD73+ CD90+ CD106+-cells into the fibrous lungs. These cells are incapable of differentiating into fibroblast cells. Spiperone instillation separately or together with pegHYAL reduced the MSC-like cells considerably. These data enable us to assume, that pegHYAL is a new and promising instrument both for preventive and therapy of toxic pneumofibrosis. The blockage of D2 dopamine receptors with the following change of hyaluronan matrix can be considered as a new strategy in treatment of pneumofibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2087028591,"Motivated by the recent implication of cysteine protease cathepsin L as a potential target for anti-cancer drug development, we used a conditional MycERTAM;Bcl-xL model of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumorigenesis (PNET) to assess the role of cathepsin L in Myc-induced tumor progression. By employing a cysteine cathepsin activity probe in vivo and in vitro, we first established that cathepsin activity increases during the initial stages of MycERTAM;Bcl-xL tumor development. Among the cathepsin family members investigated, only cathepsin L was predominately produced by beta-tumor cells in neoplastic pancreata and, consistent with this, cathepsin L mRNA expression was rapidly upregulated following Myc activation in the beta cell compartment. By contrast, cathepsins B, S and C were highly enriched in tumor-infiltrating leukocytes. Genetic deletion of cathepsin L had no discernible effect on the initiation of neoplastic growth or concordant angiogenesis. However, the tumors that developed in the cathepsin L-deficient background were markedly reduced in size relative to their typical wild-type counterparts, indicative of a role for cathepsin L in enabling expansive tumor growth. Thus, genetic blockade of cathepsin L activity is inferred to retard Myc-driven tumor growth, encouraging the potential utility of pharmacological inhibitors of cysteine cathepsins in treating late stage tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2018935814,"Ethanol abuse during adolescence may significantly alter development of the prefrontal cortex which continues to undergo structural remodeling into adulthood. Glutamatergic neurotransmission plays an important role during these brain maturation processes and is modulated by ethanol. In this study, we investigated glutamate dynamics in the medial prefrontal cortex of freely moving rats, using enzyme-based microelectrode amperometry. We analyzed the effects of an intraperitoneal ethanol injection (1 g/kg) on cortical glutamate levels in adolescent and adult rats. Notably, basal glutamate levels decreased with age and these levels were found to be significantly different between postnatal day (PND) 28-38 vs PND 44-55 (p<0.05) and PND 28-38 vs adult animals (p<0.001). We also observed spontaneous glutamate release (transients) throughout the recordings. The frequency of transients (per hour) was significantly higher in adolescent rats (PND 28-38 and PND 44-55) compared to those of adults. In adolescent rats, post-ethanol injection, the frequency of glutamate transients decreased within the first hour (p<0.05), it recovered slowly and in the third hour there was a significant rebound increase of the frequency (p<0.05). Our data demonstrate age-dependent differences in extracellular glutamate levels in the medial prefrontal cortex and suggest that acute ethanol injections have both inhibitory and excitatory effects in adolescent rats. These effects of ethanol on the prefrontal cortex may disturb its maturation and possibly limiting individuals´ control over addictive behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W1921992122,"Sustained directional fibroblast migration requires both polarized activation of the protrusive signal, Rac1, and redistribution of inactive Rac1 from the rear of the cell so that it can be redistributed or degraded. In this work, we determine how alternative endocytic mechanisms dictate the fate of Rac1 in response to the extracellular matrix environment. We discover that both coronin-1C and caveolin retrieve Rac1 from similar locations at the rear and sides of the cell. We find that coronin-1C-mediated extraction, which is responsible for Rac1 recycling, is a constitutive process that maintains Rac1 protein levels within the cell. In the absence of coronin-1C, the effect of caveolin-mediated endocytosis, which targets Rac1 for proteasomal degradation, becomes apparent. Unlike constitutive coronin-1C-mediated trafficking, caveolin-mediated Rac1 endocytosis is induced by engagement of the fibronectin receptor syndecan-4. Such an inducible endocytic/degradation mechanism would predict that, in the presence of fibronectin, caveolin defines regions of the cell that are resistant to Rac1 activation but, in the absence of fibronectin leaves more of the membrane susceptible to Rac1 activation and protrusion. Indeed, we demonstrate that fibronectin-stimulated activation of Rac1 is accelerated in the absence of caveolin and that, when caveolin is knocked down, polarization of active Rac1 is lost in FRET experiments and culminates in shunting migration in a fibrous fibronectin matrix. Although the concept of polarized Rac1 activity in response to chemoattractants has always been apparent, our understanding of the balance between recycling and degradation explains how polarity can be maintained when the chemotactic gradient has faded.Background:Directional migration requires removal of Rac1 from the back of the cell.Results:Coronin-1C and caveolin provide parallel pathways for constitutive recycling or fibronectin-inducible degradation of Rac1.Discussion:Redundant trafficking pathways facilitate polarity while migrating, and responsiveness to chemotactic gradients while stationary.Significance:Maintenance of polarized migration, when the chemotactic gradient has dissipated, is essential for wound healing over a period of days. Sustained directional fibroblast migration requires both polarized activation of the protrusive signal, Rac1, and redistribution of inactive Rac1 from the rear of the cell so that it can be redistributed or degraded. In this work, we determine how alternative endocytic mechanisms dictate the fate of Rac1 in response to the extracellular matrix environment. We discover that both coronin-1C and caveolin retrieve Rac1 from similar locations at the rear and sides of the cell. We find that coronin-1C-mediated extraction, which is responsible for Rac1 recycling, is a constitutive process that maintains Rac1 protein levels within the cell. In the absence of coronin-1C, the effect of caveolin-mediated endocytosis, which targets Rac1 for proteasomal degradation, becomes apparent. Unlike constitutive coronin-1C-mediated trafficking, caveolin-mediated Rac1 endocytosis is induced by engagement of the fibronectin receptor syndecan-4. Such an inducible endocytic/degradation mechanism would predict that, in the presence of fibronectin, caveolin defines regions of the cell that are resistant to Rac1 activation but, in the absence of fibronectin leaves more of the membrane susceptible to Rac1 activation and protrusion.

Directional migration requires removal of Rac1 from the back of the cell. Coronin-1C and caveolin provide parallel pathways for constitutive recycling or fibronectin-inducible degradation of Rac1. Redundant trafficking pathways facilitate polarity while migrating, and responsiveness to chemotactic gradients while stationary. Maintenance of polarized migration, when the chemotactic gradient has dissipated, is essential for wound healing over a period of days. In adult animals, the migration of dermal fibroblasts is a tightly regulated process that is responsible for the organization of extracellular matrix and the contraction of wounds upon skin damage. Key regulation events include the initiation of migration but also the polarization of signals that cause fibroblasts to translocate over many cell lengths and cluster at the wound bed. As the regulator of membrane protrusion, Rac1 is a nexus in migration regulation, and inhibition or activation of Rac1 retards or accelerates skin healing, respectively (1Hassanain H.H. Irshaid F. Wisel S. Sheridan J. Michler R.E. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J.

Historically, mechanisms of Rac1 regulation have focused on activation by guanine-nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins (4Raftopoulou M. Hall A. Cell migration: Rho GTPases lead the way.Dev. Biol. 2004; 265: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). More recently, the focus has shifted toward mechanisms for sequestration either in the cytoplasm by guanine-nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) 2The abbreviations used are: GDIguanine-nucleotide dissociation inhibitorCDMcell-derived matrixMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastDMEDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumCFPcyan fluorescent proteinYFPyellow fluorescent protein.

Localization of Rac1 plays an important role in the regulation of signaling. In the skin, engagement of the fibronectin receptors syndecan-4 and α5β1-integrin trigger the activation of Rac1 and are necessary for efficient wound healing (8Echtermeyer F. Streit M. Wilcox-Adelman S. Saoncella S. Denhez F. Detmar M. Goetinck P. Delayed wound repair and impaired angiogenesis in mice lacking syndecan-4.J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: R9-R14Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Syndecan-4, in particular, is very good at detecting dilute extracellular agonists but very poor at localizing the resultant Rac1 signal because it is a diffusely distributed transmembrane proteoglycan. Coupled with the facts that active Rac1 turns over rapidly and that fibronectin gradients are both shallow and transient, additional factors, such as protein localization, are necessary to sustain polarized signaling after the initial stimulation event. There are three major mechanisms for Rac1 redistribution. The original mechanism involves extraction of GTPases from the plasma membrane by RhoGDI for sequestration in the cytosol (9Nomanbhoy T.K. Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Kinetics of Cdc42 membrane extraction by Rho-GDI monitored by real-time fluorescence resonance energy transfer.Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1744-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The second mechanism involves caveolin-dependent endocytosis of Rac1 and is particularly interesting because caveolin distribution is polarized in fibroblasts and regulated by both integrins and syndecan-4 (10Bass M.D. Williamson R.C.

Focal-adhesion targeting links caveolin-1 to a Rac1-degradation pathway.J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123: 1948-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported a third mechanism involving the coronin-1C (Coro1C)-dependent redistribution of Rac1 through the vesicular system (6Williamson R.C. Cowell C.A. Hammond C.L. Bergen D.J. Roper J.A. Feng Y. Rendall T.C. Race P.R. Bass M.D. Coronin-1C and RCC2 guide mesenchymal migration by trafficking Rac1 and controlling GEF exposure.J. Cell Sci. 2014; 127: 4292-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Like caveolin, Coro1C associated with particular membrane compartments, including the non-protrusive rear and sides of a migrating fibroblast, which were collectively termed the lateral membrane. The existence of such apparently similar mechanisms for the removal of Rac1 from the plasma membrane raises questions about how Coro1C and caveolin mechanisms are coordinated and whether they fulfill specific or redundant functions. In this work, we discover that Coro1C and caveolin play distinct and complimentary roles in Rac1 trafficking. We discover that, although Coro1C redistributes Rac1 from the lateral membrane for reactivation regardless of syndecan-4-engagement, caveolin removes Rac1 from similar locations for proteasomal degradation. The degradative events are triggered by engagement of syndecan-4 by fibronectin, meaning that the fate of Rac1 depends on the matrix environment. We find that, between them, Coro1C and caveolin define regions of the membrane that are resistant to Rac1 signaling and, thereby, sustain processive, linear migration. Mouse monoclonal antibodies raised against Rac1; β1-integrin, EEA1, Rab4 (BD Transduction Laboratories), tubulin (catalog no.

Cells were treated with 25 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) for 2 h to prevent de novo synthesis of extracellular matrix and other syndecan-4 ligands and then spread on the 50K-coated plates for 2 h in DME, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 25 mm HEPES, and 25 μg/ml cycloheximide. Spread cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml H/0 for 0–60 min before preparing lysates. Cells were lysed in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 140 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 4 mm EGTA, 4 mm EDTA, and complete protease inhibitor, and the detergent-insoluble pellet was separated from the soluble/vesicle fraction by centrifugation at 22000 × g for 5 min. Cells were harvested at 4 °C by scraping in Dulbecco's PBS containing calcium and magnesium, complete protease inhibitor (Roche), 5 mm Na2VO4, and 10 mm NaF. Membranes were fragmented by three 12-J pulses using a Vibra-Cell sonicator (Sonics) before removing nuclear debris with a 10-min, 1000 × g centrifugation step. Membranes were separated into a plasma membrane pellet and vesicle/soluble supernatant by 10-min centrifugation at 10,000 × g. For immunoprecipitation, ProteinG dynabeads (Invitrogen) and the appropriate antibody were incubated with unclarified lysate for 2 h before separation from unbound material by magnetic sorting. For degradation inhibition experiments, lysosomal degradation was blocked by overnight treatment with 100 nm bafilomycin A1 (R&D Systems), proteasomal degradation was blocked by 3-h treatment with 40 μm MG132 (Sigma), and protein synthesis was blocked by treatment with 25 μg/ml cycloheximide for 0, 2, or 20 h.

GST-PAK-CRIB (p21-activated kinase Cdc42 and Rac interacting binding domain)-loaded agarose beads were incubated with the lysates for 1 h and then washed three times with lysis buffer. For experiments on two-dimensional fibronectin, 13-mm-diameter glass coverslips were coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin (Sigma) in Dulbecco's PBS containing calcium and magnesium (Sigma). For experiments on three-dimensional CDM, coverslips were prepared as described previously (17Bass M.D. Roach K.A. Morgan M.R. Mostafavi-Pour Z. Schoen T. Muramatsu T. Mayer U. Ballestrem C.

Cells were spread for 4 h in DME, 10% FBS, 4.5 g/liter glucose, and 25 mm HEPES; fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde; permeabilized with 0.5% (w/v) TrX diluted in PBS; and blocked with 3% (w/v) BSA in PBS. Fixed cells were stained for caveolin, coronin-1C, or cortactin; mounted in Prolong®Antifade (Invitrogen); and photographed on a Leica SP5-II confocal laser-scanning microscope using a ×100, numerical aperture 1.4 PlanApo objective. Maximum projection images were compiled, bandpass-filtered, and analyzed using ImageJ software. Colocalization was quantified by measuring intensity profiles of caveolin and Coro1C across the lateral membrane or leading edge and calculated by Pearson correlation. Fibroblasts transfected with the Raichu Rac probe (18Itoh R.E. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Yoshizaki H. Mochizuki N. Matsuda M.

Images were acquired on a Leica DM IRBE inverted microscope using a ×63, numerical aperture 1.32 objective, Sutter DG5 light source, and Photometrics Coolsnap HQ2 camera, capturing images through CFP and YFP filters upon excitation through the CFP channel every 2 min. FRET ratios were calculated as described previously (19Machacek M. Hodgson L. Welch C. Elliott H. Pertz O. Nalbant P. Abell A. Johnson G.L. Hahn K.M. Danuser G.

Briefly, aligned CFP and YFP images were corrected for uneven illumination and photobleaching and background-subtracted. A binary mask was used to define the borders of the cell, and the YFP image was divided by the CFP image to yield a ratio image reflecting the distribution of Rac1 activity across the cell. The same result was obtained when the order of acquisition of CFP and YFP images was reversed or when fixed cells were analyzed, eliminating motion artifacts. PAGFP-Rac1 and pmCherry were cotransfected into MEFs already transfected with control, Coro1C, or caveolin antisense oligos. Transfected cells were spread on fibronectin and identified by mCherry expression. A 2.3-μm2 spot at the non-protrusive membrane was photoactivated at 405 nm, and then GFP fluorescence at 488 nm was recorded at 2 images/s on an Ultraview spinning disk confocal microscope (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a ×63, numerical aperture 1.3 PlanApo objective. Images were analyzed using ImageJ and GraphPad Prism. Cells were spread on CDM in medium with 10% serum for 4 h before capturing time-lapse images at 10-min intervals for 10 h on a Leica AS MDW microscope using a ×5, numerical aperture 0.15 Fluotar or ×40, numerical aperture 0.55 N PLAN objective and Roper charge-coupled device camera. The migration paths of all non-dividing, non-clustered cells were tracked using ImageJ software. The total absolute curvature of each track was calculated as described previously (6Williamson R.C.

Cell Sci. 2014; 127: 4292-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It has been established that fibronectin triggers activation of Rac1 (20del Pozo M.A. Price L.S. Alderson N.B. Ren X.D.

Cell. 1998; 9: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) and that this involves cooperative engagement of two separate fibronectin receptors, α5β1-integrin and syndecan-4 (17Bass M.D. Roach K.A. Morgan M.R. Mostafavi-Pour Z. Schoen T. Muramatsu T. Mayer U. Ballestrem C. Spatz J.P. Humphries M.J. Syndecan-4-dependent Rac1 regulation determines directional migration in response to the extracellular matrix.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, the effect of fibronectin on Rac1 trafficking is less well studied. We reported recently that the actin-binding protein Coro1C redistributes GDP-Rac1 from the non-protrusive sides and rear of the cell (lateral membrane) to the leading edge for reactivation (6Williamson R.C. Cowell C.A. Hammond C.L. Bergen D.J. Roper J.A. Feng Y. Rendall T.C. Race P.R. Bass M.D. Coronin-1C and RCC2 guide mesenchymal migration by trafficking Rac1 and controlling GEF exposure.J. Cell Sci. 2014; 127: 4292-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), but it is still unclear whether this is a constitutive pathway and whether additional trafficking mechanisms operate in response to fibronectin fragments. To investigate basal and fibronectin-stimulated trafficking, cells were treated with cycloheximide to prevent matrix synthesis and spread in serum-free medium on a 50-kDa fragment of fibronectin (50K) that encompasses the binding site for α5β1-integrin but not syndecan-4 (14Danen E.H. Aota S. van Kraats A.A. Yamada K.M. Ruiter D.J. van Muijen G.N. Requirement for the synergy site for cell adhesion to fibronectin depends on the activation state of integrin α 5 β 1.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21612-21618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In control MEFs, Rac1 was detected in detergent-soluble (1% Nonidet P-40) lysate that comprised cytosol and soluble membrane, including β1-integrin and vesicle markers (Fig. 1, A and B). Coro1C was found predominantly in the detergent-resistant fraction that included flotillin microdomains. Knockdown of Coro1C shifted Rac1 from a detergent-soluble to a detergent-resistant membrane and could be rescued by re-expression of Coro1C but not Coro1A (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that expression of Coro1C is necessary for the maintenance of detergent-soluble Rac1 in cells spread on a minimal integrin-binding ligand. To test the effect of engaging both fibronectin receptors, cells prespread on the integrin ligand (50K) were stimulated with a soluble syndecan-4-binding fragment of fibronectin comprising type III repeats 12–15 (H/0) (15Sharma A. Askari J.A. Humphries M.J. Jones E.Y. Stuart D.I. Crystal structure of a heparin- and integrin-binding segment of human fibronectin.EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1468-1479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In control cells, where Rac1 resides in the detergent-soluble fraction, the distribution of Rac1 did not change (Fig. 1C). However, in Coro1C knockdown cells, the Rac1 trapped in the detergent-resistant pellet redistributed to the soluble fraction upon H/0 stimulation. Wild-type behavior could be restored by re-expression of Coro1C but not Coro1A (Fig. 1D). To pinpoint the receptor responsible for H/0-stimulated redistribution, Coro1C was knocked down in syndecan-4-null and syndecan-4-rescued MEFs. Coro1C knockdown in either syndecan-4-null or rescue cells resulted in similar levels of detergent-soluble Rac1 in unstimulated cells (Fig. 1E). However, unlike the rescue cells, syndecan-4-null cells failed to respond to H/0, demonstrating that the inducible redistribution is syndecan-4-dependent. To test whether partitioning of Rac1 between the soluble and insoluble fractions was due to membrane association, GFP-Rac1 with a cysteine-to-serine substitution in the CAAX box was transfected into Coro1C-knockdown cells. Rac1-CAAX remained in the soluble fraction and did not redistribute upon syndecan-4-engagement, although the distribution of endogenous Rac1 in the same cells was still affected by Coro1C knockdown (Fig. 1F). Together, these experiments demonstrate that Coro1C regulates the constitutive release of Rac1 from the detergent-insoluble membrane but that a second, inducible mechanism can release Rac1 upon engagement of syndecan-4 by fibronectin. Redistribution of membrane-associated proteins is frequently achieved through dynamin-dependent endocytosis. To test whether entrapment of Rac1 in the detergent-resistant membrane of Coro1C-depleted cells was a consequence of defective dynamin-dependent endocytosis, we tested whether dynamin-2 knockdown affected the segregation of Rac1. As in control cells, Rac1 remained in the soluble fraction in dynamin-2 knockdown cells and was unaffected by engagement of syndecan-4 (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, knockdown of Coro1C still shifted Rac1 from the soluble fraction to the detergent-resistant pellet in dynamin-2-depleted cells (Fig. 2, B and C), demonstrating that the effect of Coro1C is dynamin-independent. However, Coro1C/dynamin-2 double knockdown did prevent the redistribution of Rac1 to the soluble fraction upon syndecan-4 engagement (Fig. 2, C and D), demonstrating that the alternative pathway involves dynamin-dependent endocytosis. It has been reported that Rac1 is subject to caveolin-dependent endocytosis (12Grande-García A. Echarri A. de Rooij J. Alderson N.B. Waterman-Storer C.M.

To test the dynamics of α5β1-integrin redistribution in response to syndecan-4-engagement, the total plasma membrane (including Na+ K+ ATPase) was separated from the soluble/small vesicle components of the cell (including Rab4 and tubulin) by rupturing the cell by sonication and harvesting large membranes by centrifugation (Fig. 3A). The minima in plasma membrane-associated α5β1-integrin at 30 min (Fig. 3B) correlated with the peak in cytosolic Rac1 in Coro1C knockdown cells (Fig. 1C). Integrin redistribution could be blocked by knockout of caveolin-1 (Fig. 3C), causing us to examine the role of caveolin in the movement of Rac1. Coro1C localizes to both protruding membrane tips and the non-protruding membrane at the back and sides of the cell in proximity to actin stress fibers (from here on termed the lateral membrane) (6Williamson R.C.

Few studies included well-controls so test specificities are poorly defined. We studied tuberculosis diagnosis in 525 children with and without HIV-infection. Methods and Findings ‘Cases’ were children with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis (n = 209 HIV-negative; n = 81 HIV-positive) and asymptomatic ‘well-control’ children (n = 200 HIV-negative; n = 35 HIV-positive). Specimens (n = 2422) were gastric aspirates, nasopharyngeal aspirates and stools analyzed by a total of 9688 tests. All specimens were tested with an in-house hemi-nested IS6110 PCR that took <24 hours. False-positive PCR in well-controls were more frequent in HIV-infection (P≤0.01): 17% (6/35) HIV-positive well-controls versus 5.5% (11/200) HIV-negative well-controls; caused by 6.7% (7/104) versus 1.8% (11/599) of their specimens, respectively. 6.7% (116/1719) specimens from 25% (72/290) cases were PCR-positive, similar (P>0.2) for HIV-positive versus HIV-negative cases. All specimens were also tested with auramine acid-fast microscopy, microscopic-observation drug-susceptibility (MODS) liquid culture, and Lowenstein-Jensen solid culture that took ≤6 weeks and had 100% specificity (all 2112 tests on 704 specimens from 235 well-controls were negative). Microscopy-positivity was rare (0.21%, 5/2422 specimens) and all microscopy-positive specimens were culture-positive. Culture-positivity was less frequent (P≤0.01) in HIV-infection: 1.2% (1/81) HIV-positive cases versus 11% (22/209) HIV-negative cases; caused by 0.42% (2/481) versus 4.7% (58/1235) of their specimens, respectively. Conclusions In HIV-positive children with suspected tuberculosis, diagnostic yield was so low that 1458 microscopy and culture tests were done per case confirmed and even in children with culture-proven tuberculosis most tests and specimens were false-negative; whereas PCR was so prone to false-positives that PCR-positivity was as likely in specimens from well-controls as suspected-tuberculosis cases. This demonstrates the importance of control participants in diagnostic test evaluation and that even extensive laboratory testing only rarely contributed to the care of children with suspected TB. Trial Registration This study did not meet Peruvian and some other international criteria for a clinical trial but was registered with the ClinicalTrials.gov registry: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00054769"
https://openalex.org/W2317940640,"Transforming growth factor (TGF)β acts on fibroblasts to promote the production and remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM). In adult humans, excessive action of TGFβ is associated with fibrotic disease and fibroproliferative conditions, including gingival hyperplasia. Understanding how the TGFβ1 signals in fibroblasts is therefore likely to result in valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying fibroproliferative disorders. Previously, we used the TAK1 inhibitor (5Z)-7-Oxozeaenol to show that, in dermal fibroblasts, the non-canonical TAK1 pathway mediates the ability of TGFβ1 to induce genes promoting tissue remodeling and repair. However, the extent to which TAK1 mediates fibroproliferative responses in fibroblasts in response to TGFβ1 remains unclear. Herein, we show that, in gingival fibroblasts, (5Z)-7-Oxozeaenol blocks the ability of TGFβ1 to induce expression of the pro-fibrotic mediator CCN2 (connective tissue growth factor, CTGF) and type I collagen protein. Moreover, genome-wide expression profiling revealed that, in gingival fibroblasts, (5Z)-7-Oxozeaenol reduces the ability of TGFβ1 to induce mRNA expression of essentially all TGFβ1-responsive genes (139/147), including those involved with a hyperproliferative response. Results from microarray analysis were confirmed using real time polymerase chain reaction analysis and a functional cell proliferation assay. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that TAK1 inhibitors might be useful in treating fibroproliferative disorders, including that in the oral cavity."
https://openalex.org/W1980038067,"Most experimental paradigms to study visual cognition in humans and non-human species are based on discrimination tasks involving the choice between two or more visual stimuli. To this end, different types of stimuli and procedures for stimuli presentation are used, which highlights the necessity to compare data obtained with different methods. The present study assessed whether, and to what extent, capuchin monkeys' ability to solve a size discrimination problem is influenced by the type of procedure used to present the problem. Capuchins' ability to generalise knowledge across different tasks was also evaluated. We trained eight adult tufted capuchin monkeys to select the larger of two stimuli of the same shape and different sizes by using pairs of food items (Experiment 1), computer images (Experiment 1) and objects (Experiment 2). Our results indicated that monkeys achieved the learning criterion faster with food stimuli compared to both images and objects. They also required consistently fewer trials with objects than with images. Moreover, female capuchins had higher levels of acquisition accuracy with food stimuli than with images. Finally, capuchins did not immediately transfer the solution of the problem acquired in one task condition to the other conditions. Overall, these findings suggest that--even in relatively simple visual discrimination problems where a single perceptual dimension (i.e., size) has to be judged--learning speed strongly depends on the mode of presentation."
https://openalex.org/W2060530138,"CMRF35-like molecule-1 (CLM-1) belongs to a receptor family mainly expressed in myeloid cells that include activating and inhibitory receptors. CLM-1 contains two ITIMs and a single immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM), although also displays a binding site for p85α regulatory subunit of PI3K. By using murine primary microglial cultures, we show the presence of all CLM members in microglial cells and characterize the expression of CLM-1 both in basal conditions and during microglial activation. The TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the TLR3 agonist polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) induce an increase in microglial CLM-1 mRNA levels in vitro, whereas the TLR2/6 heterodimer agonist peptidoglycan (PGN) produces a marked decrease. In this study we also describe a new soluble isoform of CLM-1 that is detected at mRNA and protein levels in basal conditions in primary microglial cultures. Interestingly, CLM-1 engagement enhances the transcription of the pro-inflammatory mediators TNFα, COX-2 and NOS-2 in microglial cells challenged with LPS. These results reveal that CLM-1 can acts as a co-activating receptor and suggest that this receptor could play a key role in the regulation of microglial activation."
https://openalex.org/W2331784709,"Bladder cancer has a high incidence with significant morbidity and mortality. Attenuated expression of the DNA damage response protein Xeroderma Pigmentosum complementation group C (XPC) has been described in bladder cancer. XPC plays an essential role as the main initiator and damage-detector in global genome nucleotide excision repair (NER) of UV-induced lesions, bulky DNA adducts and intrastrand crosslinks, such as those made by the chemotherapeutic agent Cisplatin. Hence, XPC protein might be an informative biomarker to guide personalized therapy strategies in a subset of bladder cancer cases. Therefore, we measured the XPC protein expression level and functional NER activity of 36 bladder tumors in a standardized manner. We optimized conditions for dissociation and in vitro culture of primary bladder cancer cells and confirmed attenuated XPC expression in approximately 40% of the tumors. However, NER activity was similar to co-cultured wild type cells in all but one of 36 bladder tumors. We conclude, that (i) functional NER deficiency is a relatively rare phenomenon in bladder cancer and (ii) XPC protein levels are not useful as biomarker for NER activity in these tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2030801299,"Short Sequence Repeat (SSR) typing of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (Map) isolates is one of the most commonly used method for genotyping this pathogen. Currently used techniques have challenges in analyzing mononucleotide repeats >15 bp, which include some of the Map SSRs. Fragment analysis is a relatively simple technique, which can accurately measure the size of DNA fragments and can be used to calculate the repeat length of the target SSR loci. In the present study, fragment analysis was used to analyze 4 Map SSR loci known to provide sufficient discriminatory power to determine the relationship between Map isolates. Eighty-five Map isolates from 18 animals from the island of Newfoundland were successfully genotyped using fragment analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on Map SSR diversity from Newfoundland dairy farms. Previously unreported Map SSR-types or combinations were also identified during the course of the described work. In addition, multiple Map SSR-types were isolated from a single animal in many cases, which is not a common finding."
https://openalex.org/W2088659355,"Although infant speech perception in often studied in isolated modalities, infants' experience with speech is largely multimodal (i.e., speech sounds they hear are accompanied by articulating faces). Across two experiments, we tested infants’ sensitivity to the relationship between the auditory and visual components of audiovisual speech in their native (English) and non-native (Spanish) language. In Experiment 1, infants’ looking times were measured during a preferential looking task in which they saw two simultaneous visual speech streams articulating a story, one in English and the other in Spanish, while they heard either the English or the Spanish version of the story. In Experiment 2, looking times from another group of infants were measured as they watched single displays of congruent and incongruent combinations of English and Spanish audio and visual speech streams. Findings demonstrated an age-related increase in looking towards the native relative to non-native visual speech stream when accompanied by the corresponding (native) auditory speech. This increase in native language preference did not appear to be driven by a difference in preference for native vs. non-native audiovisual congruence as we observed no difference in looking times at the audiovisual streams in Experiment 2."
https://openalex.org/W2035169142,"Hydrogen gas functions as a key component in the metabolism of a wide variety of microorganisms, often acting as either a fermentative end-product or an energy source. The number of organisms reported to utilize hydrogen continues to grow, contributing to and expanding our knowledge of biological hydrogen processes. Here we demonstrate that Volvox carteri f. nagariensis, a multicellular green alga with differentiated cells, evolves H2 both when supplied with an abiotic electron donor and under physiological conditions. The genome of Volvox carteri contains two genes encoding putative [FeFe]-hydrogenases (HYDA1 and HYDA2), and the transcripts for these genes accumulate under anaerobic conditions. The HYDA1 and HYDA2 gene products were cloned, expressed, and purified, and both are functional [FeFe]-hydrogenases. Additionally, within the genome the HYDA1 and HYDA2 genes cluster with two putative genes which encode hydrogenase maturation proteins. This gene cluster resembles operon-like structures found within bacterial genomes and may provide further insight into evolutionary relationships between bacterial and algal [FeFe]-hydrogenase genes."

The structure of the corresponding complex was solved at a resolution of 3.0 Å using molecular replacement and constitutes the first reported structure of a human type I IFN bound to a therapeutic antibody. This study revealed the major contribution made by the first complementarity-determining region in each of sifalimumab light and heavy chains. These data also provided the molecular basis for sifalimumab mechanism of action.

Interferons (IFNs) belong to the “4-helical cytokines” superfamily (1.Hill E.E. Morea V. Chothia C. Sequence conservation in families whose members have little or no sequence similarity: the four-helical cytokines and cytochromes.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 205-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and can be grouped into types I, II, and III. IFN-γ and IFN-λ are the only known members of the type II and III IFNs, respectively (2.Pestka S. Krause C.D. Walter M.R. Interferons, interferon-like cytokines, and their receptors.Immunol.

Most notably, these include IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-τ, IFN-κ, IFN-ϵ, IFN-δ and IFN-ω. The critical role of IFNs in modulating the host mammalian responses to infections has been well documented (4.Isaacs A. Lindenmann J. Virus interference.J.

Cell Biol. 2008; 86: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). More recently, IFNs have also been shown to be key immunoregulatory cytokines. As such, they play a central role in the onset of various autoimmune diseases (7.Baccala R. Kono D.H. Theofilopoulos A.N. Interferons as pathogenic effectors in autoimmunity.Immunol. Rev. 2005; 204: 9-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 8.Theofilopoulos A.N. Baccala R. Beutler B. Kono D.H. Type I interferons (α/β) in immunity and autoimmunity.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 307-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Direct evidence includes the observation that autoimmune-predisposed mice deficient in the IFN-α/-β receptor exhibit significantly reduced disease manifestations such as the presence of anti-erythrocyte autoantibodies, hemolytic anemia, anti-DNA autoantibodies, and kidney disease (9.Santiago-Raber M.L. Baccala R. Haraldsson K.M. Choubey D. Stewart T.A. Kono D.H. Theofilopoulos A.N. Type-I interferon receptor deficiency reduces lupus-like disease in NZB mice.J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). In particular, systemic lupus erythematosus, type I diabetes, and Sjögren syndrome, as well as thyroid diseases, have now been linked to the action of IFN-α (10.Selmi C. Lleo A. Zuin M. Podda M. Rossaro L. Gershwin M.E. Interferon α and its contribution to autoimmunity.Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2006; 7: 451-456PubMed Google Scholar). The existence of at least 13 subtypes within the IFN-α family (11.Foster G.R. Finter N.B. Are all type I human interferons equivalent?.J. Viral Hepat. 1998; 5: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) further complicates a thorough understanding of these pathways. To contribute to the treatment of autoimmune diseases, AstraZeneca/MedImmune has developed sifalimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to, and inhibits the actions of multiple IFN-α subtypes. We sought to understand the molecular basis of human IFN-α2A recognition by sifalimumab. For this purpose, we solved the x-ray crystal structure of the complex between the Fab fragment of this antibody and IFN-α2A. The structures of several type I human IFNs (e.g. IFN-α2A, IFN-α2B, and IFN-β), unbound or bound to a single chain Fv (scFv), have already been determined using either x-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (12.Radhakrishnan R.

However, this study describes the first three-dimensional structure of a human type I IFN bound to a therapeutic antibody currently in human. Our data permitted us to describe in detail the corresponding interface and provide a molecular understanding the interferon-neutralizing properties of sifalimumab. All chemicals employed were of analytical grade. The histidine-tagged recombinant extracellular domain of the IFN-α receptor 1 (IFNAR1-His6) was a generous gift from Sandrina Phipps (MedImmune). All antibody and antigen amino acid positions mentioned in the text were identified according to a consecutive numbering scheme.

All illustrations were prepared using PyMOL (DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA). complementarity-determining regions Protein Data Bank root mean square light chain heavy chain. Detailed purification, crystallization, and data collection procedures have been previously described (18.Oganesyan V. Damschroder M.M. Cook K.E. Wu H. Dall'Acqua W.F. Crystallization and preliminary x-ray diffraction analysis of the complex between a human anti-interferon antibody fragment and human interferon α-2A.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2009; 65: 14-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In short, crystals of the sifalimumab Fab·IFN-α2A complex diffracting to 3.0 Å were obtained using vapor diffusion. The orthorhombic crystals belonged to the I222 space group with unit cell parameters a = 134.82, b = 153.26, c = 163.49 Å. The crystals exhibited a relatively loose packing with a solvent content and Matthew's coefficient of 59.3% and 3.02 Å3 Da−1, respectively. Two sifalimumab Fab·IFN-α2A complexes were in the asymmetric part of the unit cell. Diffraction images were integrated and scaled using HKL 2000 (19.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38518) Google Scholar). Molecular replacement, refinement, and electron density calculation were completed via the CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project Number 4) program suite (20.Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 The CCP4 suite: programs for protein crystallography.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19747) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the sifalimumab Fab·IFN-α2A complex was solved using molecular replacement and refined at 3.0-Å resolution. The search model for sifalimumab Fab consisted of the Fab portion of another antibody from AstraZeneca/MedImmune whose structure was determined at 2.17-Å resolution (21.Peng L. Oganesyan V. Wu H. Dall'Acqua W.F. Damschroder M.M. Molecular basis for the antagonistic activity of an anti-interferon α receptor 1 antibody.MAbs. 2015; 7: 428-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The sequence identities between the Fab portions of sifalimumab and the search model were 95.3 and 78.6% for the light and heavy chains, respectively. The non-identical amino acids were first modeled as alanine during the molecular replacement procedure and initial refinement/model building rounds. A very clear solution was obtained for the 2 sifalimumab Fab molecules in the asymmetric unit using both PHASER (22.McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Likelihood-enhanced fast translation functions.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar) and MolRep (23.Vagin A. Teplyakov A.J. MOLREP: an automated program for molecular replacement.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4145) Google Scholar). For the IFN-α2A portion, 3 human type I IFN structures were available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (24.Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. The Protein Data Bank.Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27300) Google Scholar) at the time of the study (2008). These corresponded to PDB codes 1ITF (human IFN-α2A exhibiting 100% sequence identity with IFN-α2A of this study; NMR-solved), 1RH2 (human IFN-α2B exhibiting 99% sequence identity with IFN-α2A of this study, x-ray-solved at 2.9 Å resolution), and 1AU1 (human IFN-β exhibiting 39% sequence identity with IFN-α2A of this study, x-ray solved at 2.2-Å resolution). None of these 3 potential models yielded a clear molecular replacement solution with PHASER or MolRep. However, the phases obtained through the solution of both sifalimumab Fab molecules yielded very clear electron density for the proximal region of IFN-α2A. Two rounds of Fab-only refinement and model adjustment using the “O” software (25.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Improved methods for building protein models in electron density maps and the location of errors in these models.Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar) further improved the electron density quality of the antigen and made it possible to build 3 of 5 helices manually. The resulting partial model was then superimposed on the structure of human IFN-α2B (PDB ID 1RH2), which differed from IFN-α2A by only one amino acid (R23K). The tight non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were used throughout the refinement of the model with Refmac5 (26.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Refinement of macromolecular structures by the maximum-likelihood method.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13850) Google Scholar). The substituted alanine residues were changed to their respective bona fide counterparts when permitted by the corresponding electron densities. The first 14 amino acids of both IFN-α2A molecules in the asymmetric unit were built last, because of the larger conformational differences. The latter may provide a reasonable explanation for not obtaining a clear solution during the molecular replacement procedure. Upon completion, the model was analyzed using the TLS Motion Determination (TLSMD) program running on its Web server (27.Painter J. Merritt E.A. Optimal description of a protein structure in terms of multiple groups undergoing TLS motion.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 28.Painter J. Merritt E.A. TLSMD web server for the generation of multi-group TLS models.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2006; 39: 109-111Crossref Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Further refinement was carried out in TLS and restrained refinement mode using Refmac5. For this purpose, each of 3 different polypeptides were divided into 4 parts in accordance with results from the TLSMD server. More precisely, sifalimumab light chain was divided into sections corresponding to residues 1–40, 41–106, 107–177, and 178–215. Likewise, the sifalimumab heavy chain was divided into sections corresponding to residues 1–62, 63–129, 130–185, and 186–219. Finally, IFN-α2A was divided into sections corresponding to residues 1–20, 21–51, 52–113, and 114–157. The same portions were used for NCS restraints application. As we previously described (18.Oganesyan V. Damschroder M.M. Cook K.E. Wu H. Dall'Acqua W.F. Crystallization and preliminary x-ray diffraction analysis of the complex between a human anti-interferon antibody fragment and human interferon α-2A.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2009; 65: 14-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), the IFN-α2A antigen used in this study included one extra threonine and one extra serine residue on its N-terminal end (numbered −1 and 0, respectively). Amino acids −1, 0, and 1, along with Nϵ2 of His-7, were found to coordinate a total of 2 Ni2+ ions (first and third). Another two Ni2+ ions (second and fourth) were coordinated by His-190 in the sifalimumab light chain. The fifth and sixth Ni2+ ions did not have histidine residues in the coordination sphere. Ni2+ ions were the only divalent metal ions present in the crystallization mixture, and could be identified by their fit to the corresponding electron density. The interaction of immobilized IFN-α2A with sifalimumab was monitored using a KinExA 3000 instrument (Sapidyne Instruments, Boise, ID). IFN-α2A was first coated onto UltraLink Biosupport beads (Pierce, Rockford, IL) at concentrations of 5 and 10 μg/ml in 0.05 m NaHCO3, pH 9.0, overnight at 4 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions. Coated beads were then separated from unreacted IFN-α2A using a gentle pulse spin and blocked for ∼15 min at 22 °C with 1 m Tris, pH 8.0, bovine serum albumin, 10 mg/ml. The slurry was then spun and the blocking solution removed. The blocking step was repeated for 2 h at 22 °C. Beads were then resuspended in 27 ml of run buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, 0.02% NaN3) and packed into a column. Typically, sifalimumab was prepared at concentrations of 40 and 200 pm. IFN-α2A was then titrated across these IgG solutions at concentrations of 313 fm to 16 nm and 980 fm to 50 nm, respectively, and incubated for 1–4 days at room temperature. The amount of free IgG in the samples was derived from the fluorescence signal obtained after the passing of Cy5-labeled goat anti-human IgG F(ab′)2 (typically 1 μg/ml; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) through the column. The dissociation constant (KD) was determined by fitting the individual equilibrium titration data to a 1:1 binding model using the KinExA Pro 1.0.3. software. The ability of sifalimumab to inhibit the human IFNAR1/IFN-α2A and IFNAR2/IFN-α2A interactions was monitored using a ProteOn XPR36 instrument (Bio-Rad). The extracellular domain of IFNAR1 (MedImmune) was immobilized to the EDAC/Sulfo-NHS-activated surface of on a GLC biosensor chip (Bio-Rad) using standard amine coupling (200 nm in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0) at a density of ∼4,800 resonance units according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extracellular domain of IFNAR2 (MedImmune) was also immobilized using standard amine coupling (50 nm in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0) at a density of ∼2,000 resonance units. IFN-α2A and sifalimumab were prepared in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.005% Tween 20. Sifalimumab competition was assessed by 2 consecutive injections of IFN-α2A and a mixture of IFN-α2A and sifalimumab over the IFNAR1 or IFNAR2 surfaces. For IFNAR1, IFN-α2A was first injected at 200 μg/ml (30 μl/min for 120 s), which was followed by a second injection (30 μl/min for 120 s) of the IFN-α2A (200 μg/ml)/sifalimumab (100 μg/ml) mixture. For IFNAR2, IFN-α2A was first injected at 10 μg/ml (30 μl/min for 120 s), which was followed by a second injection (30 μl/min for 120 s) of the IFN-α2A (10 μg/ml)/sifalimumab (100 μg/ml) mixture. The extent of competition was derived from the additional binding detected from the second injection. All sensorgram data were processed by ProteOn Manager 3.1 software (Bio-Rad), and the binding graphs were prepared with Prism (GraphPad). We successfully determined the x-ray crystal structure of the complex between the Fab of an anti-human IFN-α therapeutic antibody (sifalimumab) and IFN-α2A. The corresponding refinement statistics are given in Table 1. Two sifalimumab Fab fragments in the asymmetric unit superimposed with an r.m.s. deviation of 0.31 Å (maximum displacement of 1.3 Å was for Cα/136 in the heavy chain and 1.2 Å for Cα/204 in the light chain). This value is well within the estimated overall coordinate error value of 0.34 Å. In addition, the elbow angles were calculated for both molecules as described (29.Stanfield R.L. Zemla A. Wilson I.A. Rupp B. Antibody elbow angles are influenced by their light chain class.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 1566-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and separately estimated at 170.9° and 172.5°. These values are again well within the significance limit of 2–3° (29.Stanfield R.L. Zemla A. Wilson I.A. Rupp B. Antibody elbow angles are influenced by their light chain class.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 1566-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Thus, we concluded that the 2 sifalimumab Fab molecules in the asymmetric unit were essentially identical. Both antigen molecules (IFN-α2A) exhibited a r.m.s. deviation of 0.6 Å when superimposed. However, the greatest differences occurred away from the Fab/IFN-α2A interface, and close to the IFN-α2A C-terminal region (maximum displacement of 3 Å was for Cα/156). As with sifalimumab Fab, both antigen molecules in the asymmetric unit could be considered essentially identical. Therefore, all subsequent descriptions of the antibody/antigen interface were made using 1 of the 2 complexes (namely chains A, B, and C in our PDB ID 4YPG).TABLE 1Sifalimumab Fab/IFN-α2A model refinement statisticsStatisticsResolution limits (Å)20.0-3.0R factor (free r factor)0.206 (0.272)R.m.s. deviation bonds (Å)0.011R.m.s. deviation angles (Å)1.38Residues in most favored region of {ϕ,ψ} spaceaThe Ramachandran plot was produced using PROCHECK (45).

Open table in a new tab The interface contributed by the sifalimumab Fab portion could best be described as a canyon, whereas IFN-α2A exhibited a remarkable shape complementarity to this groove as indicated in Fig. 1A. A shape complementarity of ∼0.674 between sifalimumab Fab and IFN-α2A was calculated using the “sc” program from the CCP4 suite (Collaborative Computational Project Number 4) (20.Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 The CCP4 suite: programs for protein crystallography.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19747) Google Scholar). This represents a very high degree of complementarity between both partners. For comparison purposes, the shape complementarity between sifalimumab Fab heavy and light chains was estimated at 0.669. The charge complementarity between sifalimumab Fab and IFN-α2A is provided in Fig. 1, B and C. The basic surfaces of both variable regions of the antibody exhibited very good complementarity to the acidic surface of the antigen. Finally, we also noted that the side of the antigen of the sifalimumab Fab/IFN-α2A contact interface was formed mainly by parts of B (residues 49–69), C (residues 78–101), and D (residues 112–133) helices as illustrated in Fig. 1D. The buried surface area upon formation of the complex between sifalimumab Fab and IFN-α2A was estimated at more than 1,300 Å2 (as calculated from the PISA server). The contact interface included ∼20 amino acids from each of the antibody polypeptides and ∼40 amino acids from the antigen. In particular, the heavy and light chains of sifalimumab Fab covered ∼600 and 700 Å2 of solvent-accessible area upon complex formation, respectively. The list of all hydrogen bonds between both chains of sifalimumab Fab and IFN-α2A can be found in Table 2. It is worth noting that the heavy and light chain CDRs of sifalimumab Fab contributed unequally to the interaction with IFN-α2A. Indeed, 4 intermolecular hydrogen bonds involved the heavy chain first CDR (CDRH1, Fig. 2A and Table 2), whereas 9 intermolecular hydrogen bonds involved the light chain first CDR (CDRL1; Fig. 2B and Table 2). Asn-55/Nδ2 in the second CDR of the sifalimumab Fab heavy chain (CDRH2) made a lone hydrogen bond with IFN-α2A Asp-2/Oδ2 (Fig. 2C and Table 2). The contribution of the second CDR of the sifalimumab Fab light chain (CDRL2) for binding to IFN-α2A appeared somewhat less specific, in that all corresponding intermolecular hydrogen bonds only involved the main chain CDRL2 atoms of Gly-51 and Arg-55 (Fig. 2D and Table 2). Finally, the spatially close CDRH3 and CDRL3 of the sifalimumab Fab created 2 intermolecular hydrogen bonds each with the antigen (Fig. 2E and Table 2). In CDRL3, Tyr-92/Oη and Arg-97/Nη2 created one hydrogen bond each with IFN-α2A Gln-61/Nϵ2 and Glu-96/Oϵ1, respectively. CDRH3 was only involved in contacts with IFN-α2A Glu-96/Oϵ1,2 through its main chain Ile-101/N atom. Interestingly, 2 intermolecular hydrogen bonds were mediated by one residue in the second framework of the sifalimumab light chain (Tyr-50). In summary, sifalimumab CDRL1 and CDRH1 made the largest contribution to formation of the high affinity complex between IFN-α2A and sifalimumab (KD shown in Table 3). Importantly, none of the side chains in sifalimumab CDRL2 and CDRH3 were involved in hydrogen bonds with IFN-α2A.TABLE 2Summary of hydrogen bonds formed between sifalimumab Fab and IFN-α2ASifalimumabDistance (Å)IFN-α2ACDRH1Ser-31 (O)aLetters in parentheses refer to the corresponding interacting atoms.,bMain chain atoms.3.0Gln-90 (Oϵ1)Tyr-32 (Oη)3.0Thr-86 (O)bMain chain atoms.Ser-33 (Oγ)2.9Asn-93 (Nδ2)Ser-33 (N)bMain chain atoms.3.1Asn-93 (Nδ2)CDRL1Ser-30 (Oγ)3.2Thr-106 (Oγ)Ser-30 (Oγ)2.8Met-111 (O)bMain chain atoms.Ser-31 (N)bMain chain atoms.2.9Glu-113 (Oϵ1)Ser-31 (Oγ)2.4Glu-113 (Oϵ2)Ser-31 (Oγ)3.1Arg-120 (Nη2)Thr-32 (Oγ1)3.0Gln-61 (Nϵ2)Thr-32 (O)bMain chain atoms.2.6His-57 (Nδ1)Thr-32 (O)bMain chain atoms.2.9Glu-58 (Oϵ1)Thr-32 (O)bMain chain atoms.2.9Gln-61 (Νϵ2)CDRH2Asn-55 (Nδ2)3.6Asp-2 (Oδ2)FRL2cFR, framework.Tyr-50 (Oη)3.3Gln-61 (O)bMain chain atoms.Tyr-50 (Oη)3.4Asn-65 (Nδ2)CDRL2Gly-51 (O)bMain chain atoms.3.0Arg-120 (Nη2)Arg-55 (O)bMain chain atoms.3.7Asn-65 (δ2)CDRH3Ile-101 (N)bMain chain atoms.3.4Glu-96 (ϵ1)Ile-101 (N)bMain chain atoms.3.6Glu-96 (Oϵ2)CDRL3Tyr-92 (Oη)2.8Gln-61 (Nϵ2)Arg-97 (Nη2)3.7Glu-96 (Oϵ1)a Letters in parentheses refer to the corresponding interacting atoms.b Main chain atoms.c FR, framework.

Our model did not indicate such a dimerization mechanism because no ions were found to be shared between 2 contacting IFN-α2A molecules (despite the presence of Ni2+ in the crystallization mixture). This comforts the notion that the active form of IFN-α molecules is monomeric, as determined by Klaus et al. (13.Klaus W. Gsell B. Labhardt A.M. Wipf B. Senn H.

The type I IFN receptor (shared by all human type I IFNs) comprises 2 major transmembrane subunits, namely IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 (30.Uzé G. Lutfalla G. Gresser I.

IFN-α binds to IFNAR2 with a much faster kon and slower koff than those measured for IFNAR1 (32.Gavutis M. Lata S. Lamken P. Müller P. Piehler J.

Therefore, a two-step assembling mechanism was proposed for formation of the tertiary IFN signal complex, in which IFN-α first binds IFNAR2 and then recruits IFNAR1 (32.Gavutis M. Lata S. Lamken P.

In addition, various human IFN-α2 residues identified by Piehler et al. (37.Piehler J. Roisman L.C. Schreiber G.

These data agree with the observation that sifalimumab can bind to IFN-α2A·IFNAR2 complexes (Fig. 4A), and, thus, rule out a mechanism of action in which the antibody interferes with the corresponding receptor/ligand interaction.FIGURE 4Sifalimumab binding to human IFNAR2·IFN-α2A (A) and human IFNAR1·IFN-α2A (B) complexes. Sifalimumab could bind to IFNAR2·IFN-α2A, but not IFNAR1·IFN-α2A complexes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Interestingly, binding of sifalimumab to IFN-α2A·IFNAR1 complexes could not be detected (Fig. 4B). In fact, sifalimumab actually inhibited the binding of IFN-α2A to immobilized IFNAR1, as observed from the drop in signal upon injection of the IFN-α2A/sifalimumab mixture. Indeed, the interaction of sifalimumab/IFN-α2A (KD of 44 pm) is much stronger than that of IFNARI/IFN-α2A (KD of 1.5 μm (33.Roisman L.C. Jaitin D.A. Baker D.P. Schreiber G.

Therefore, sifalimumab interferon blocking activity appears to be caused by inhibition of IFN-α2 binding to IFNAR1. Our structure of the sifalimumab Fab·IFN-α2A complex provided a better understanding of this phenomenon. In particular, crucial amino acids for the IFN-α2/IFNAR1 interaction have been identified (33.Roisman L.C. Jaitin D.A. Baker D.P. Schreiber G.

When mapped onto the structure of the sifalimumab·IFN-α2A complex, the region defined by these amino acids showed a significant overlap with the sifalimumab binding site (Fig. 5). Moreover, when the x-ray structure of the human IFN-α2·IFNARI·IFNAR2 ternary complex (PDB ID number 3SE3) (40.Thomas C. Moraga I. Levin D. Krutzik P.O. Podoplelova Y. Trejo A. Lee C. Yarden G.

Collectively, these data suggest that sifalimumab precludes the IFN-α2/IFNAR1 interaction through direct steric hindrance. In summary, we conclude that sifalimumab acts as a direct competitive inhibitor of the IFN-α2/IFNAR1 interaction. A coherent model of the mechanism of action for sifalimumab thus emerges, and indicates the antibody does not interfere with the first step in the response to IFN-α2, namely the ligand·IFNAR2 complex formation. Rather, we suggest that sifalimumab sterically interferes with the recruitment of IFNAR1 and prevents formation of the IFN-α2·IFNAR1·IFNAR2 ternary complex. We thank Michael A.

Very few studies of these associations have been conducted among black women, therefore we used the Nashville Breast Health Study (NBHS) to determine whether similar effects were seen in black and white women. The NBHS is a population-based case-control study of breast cancer among women age 25 to 75 years conducted between 2001 and 2010 in and around the Nashville Metropolitan area. Telephone interviews and self-administered food frequency questionnaires were completed with 2,614 incident breast cancer cases ascertained through hospitals and the statewide cancer registry, and 2,306 controls selected using random digit dialing. Among premenopausal white and black women, there was little effect of adult exercise or other energy-related indicators on breast cancer risk, regardless of tumor estrogen receptor (ER) status. The beneficial effect of adult exercise on postmenopausal breast cancer appeared to be comparable between white and black women (highest tertile relative to none - white odds ratio [OR] 0.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6-1.0, p for trend=0.05; black OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.4-1.1, p for trend=0.07); however, among black women the reduction was limited to those with ER-positive disease. White and black women should be encouraged to engage in more physical activity to reduce their risk of postmenopausal breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2041559463,"For a multicomponent therapy, molecular network is essential to uncover its specific mode of action from a holistic perspective. The molecular system of a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formula can be represented by a 2-class heterogeneous network (2-HN), which typically includes chemical similarities, chemical-target interactions and gene interactions. An important premise of uncovering the molecular mechanism is to identify mixed modules from complex chemical-gene heterogeneous network of a TCM formula. We thus proposed a novel method (MixMod) based on mixed modularity to detect accurate mixed modules from 2-HNs. At first, we compared MixMod with Clauset-Newman-Moore algorithm (CNM), Markov Cluster algorithm (MCL), Infomap and Louvain on benchmark 2-HNs with known module structure. Results showed that MixMod was superior to other methods when 2-HNs had promiscuous module structure. Then these methods were tested on a real drug-target network, in which 88 disease clusters were regarded as real modules. MixMod could identify the most accurate mixed modules from the drug-target 2-HN (normalized mutual information 0.62 and classification accuracy 0.4524). In the end, MixMod was applied to the 2-HN of Buchang naoxintong capsule (BNC) and detected 49 mixed modules. By using enrichment analysis, we investigated five mixed modules that contained primary constituents of BNC intestinal absorption liquid. As a matter of fact, the findings of in vitro experiments using BNC intestinal absorption liquid were found to highly accord with previous analysis. Therefore, MixMod is an effective method to detect accurate mixed modules from chemical-gene heterogeneous networks and further uncover the molecular mechanism of multicomponent therapies, especially TCM formulae."
https://openalex.org/W2031063384,"Industrial pollution has remained as one of the most daunting challenges for many regions around the world. Characterizing the determinants of industrial pollution should provide important management implications. Unfortunately, due to the absence of high-quality data, rather few studies have systematically examined the locational determinants using a geographical approach. This paper aimed to fill the gap by accessing the pollution source census dataset, which recorded the quantity of discharged wastes (waste water and solid waste) from 717 pollution-intensive firms within Huzhou City, China. Spatial exploratory analysis was applied to analyze the spatial dependency and local clusters of waste emissions. Results demonstrated that waste emissions presented significantly positive autocorrelation in space. The high-high hotspots generally concentrated towards the city boundary, while the low-low clusters approached the Taihu Lake. Their locational determinants were identified by spatial regression. In particular, firms near the city boundary and county road were prone to discharge more wastes. Lower waste emissions were more likely to be observed from firms with high proximity to freight transfer stations or the Taihu Lake. Dense populous districts saw more likelihood of solid waste emissions. Firms in the neighborhood of rivers exhibited higher waste water emissions. Besides, the control variables (firm size, ownership, operation time and industrial type) also exerted significant influence. The present methodology can be applicable to other areas, and further inform the industrial pollution control practices. Our study advanced the knowledge of determinants of emissions from pollution-intensive firms in urban areas."
