This study aimed to compare the mental health status during the pandemic in the general population of seven middle income countries (MICs) in Asia (China, Iran, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam). All the countries used the Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R) and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) to measure mental health. There were 4479 Asians completed the questionnaire with demographic characteristics, physical symptoms and health service utilization, contact history, knowledge and concern, precautionary measure, and rated their mental health with the IES-R and DASS-21. Descriptive statistics, One-Way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and linear regression were used to identify protective and risk factors associated with mental health parameters. There were significant differences in IES-R and DASS-21 scores between 7 MICs (p&lt;0.05). Thailand had all the highest scores of IES-R, DASS-21 stress, anxiety, and depression scores whereas Vietnam had all the lowest scores. The risk factors for adverse mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic include age &lt;30 years, high education background, single and separated status, discrimination by other countries and contact with people with COVID-19 (p&lt;0.05). The protective factors for mental health include male gender, staying with children or more than 6 people in the same household, employment, confidence in doctors, high perceived likelihood of survival, and spending less time on health information (p&lt;0.05). This comparative study among 7 MICs enhanced the understanding of metal health in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3128934913,"Memory B cells play a fundamental role in host defenses against viruses, but to date, their role has been relatively unsettled in the context of SARS-CoV-2. We report here a longitudinal single-cell and repertoire profiling of the B cell response up to 6 months in mild and severe COVID-19 patients. Distinct SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific activated B cell clones fueled an early antibody-secreting cell burst as well as a durable synchronous germinal center response. While highly mutated memory B cells, including pre-existing cross-reactive seasonal Betacoronavirus-specific clones, were recruited early in the response, neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific clones accumulated with time and largely contributed to the late, remarkably stable, memory B cell pool. Highlighting germinal center maturation, these cells displayed clear accumulation of somatic mutations in their variable region genes over time. Overall, these findings demonstrate that an antigen-driven activation persisted and matured up to 6 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection and may provide long-term protection."

Viral capsid uncoating and nuclear import of the viral genome are critical for productive infection. The size of the HIV-1 capsid is generally believed to exceed the diameter of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), indicating that capsid uncoating has to occur prior to nuclear import. Here, we combined correlative light and electron microscopy with subtomogram averaging to capture the structural status of reverse transcription-competent HIV-1 complexes in infected T cells. We demonstrated that the diameter of the NPC in cellulo is sufficient for the import of apparently intact, cone-shaped capsids. Subsequent to nuclear import, we detected disrupted and empty capsid fragments, indicating that uncoating of the replication complex occurs by breaking the capsid open, and not by disassembly into individual subunits. Our data directly visualize a key step in HIV-1 replication and enhance our mechanistic understanding of the viral life cycle. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) remains a major health threat.

Our data directly visualize a key step in HIV-1 replication and enhance our mechanistic understanding of the viral life cycle. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a lentivirus that infects non-dividing cells (Yamashita and Emerman, 2006Yamashita M. Emerman M. Retroviral infection of non-dividing cells: old and new perspectives.Virology. 2006; 344: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The primary targets of HIV-1 in vivo are immune cells, including CD4+ T lymphocytes and macrophages (Stevenson, 2003Stevenson M. HIV-1 pathogenesis.Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 853-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). HIV-1 enters the cells by fusion of the virion envelope with the cell membrane (Chen, 2019Chen B. Molecular Mechanism of HIV-1 Entry.Trends Microbiol. 2019; 27: 878-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which leads to release of the viral capsid into the cytosol. The mature HIV-1 capsid is a cone-shaped structure of ∼120 by 60 nm with fullerene geometry. It is composed of 1,200–1,500 copies of the viral capsid (CA) protein that assemble into a lattice of ∼250 CA hexamers (Briggs et al., 2003Briggs J.A.G. Wilk T. Welker R. Kräusslich H.-G. Fuller S.D.

Kräusslich H.-G. HIV-1 assembly, budding, and maturation.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2012; 2: a006924Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Five and seven CA pentamers incorporated at the narrow and broad end of the cone, respectively, close the capsid and induce the characteristic curvature (Ganser et al., 1999Ganser B.K. Li S. Klishko V.Y. Finch J.T. Sundquist W.I. Assembly and analysis of conical models for the HIV-1 core.Science. 1999; 283: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar; Mattei et al., 2016Mattei S.

The structure and flexibility of conical HIV-1 capsids determined within intact virions.Science. 2016; 354: 1434-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The capsid shell encases two copies of genomic single stranded RNA associated in a condensed ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex with the nucleocapsid (NC) protein, the replication enzymes reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN) as well as other components (Welker et al., 2000Welker R. Hohenberg H. Tessmer U. Huckhagel C. Kräusslich H.G. Biochemical and structural analysis of isolated mature cores of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1168-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Following cytosolic entry, the viral replication complex undergoes reverse transcription of the RNA genome into double-stranded DNA and transport into the nucleus, where the viral genome integrates into that of the host cell (Engelman and Singh, 2018Engelman A.N. Singh P.K. Cellular and molecular mechanisms of HIV-1 integration targeting.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2018; 75: 2491-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar; Hu and Hughes, 2012Hu W.-S. Hughes S.H. HIV-1 reverse transcription.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2012; 2: a006882Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription and integration are mediated by poorly characterized subviral complexes with unknown morphology termed reverse transcription complexes (RTC) and preintegration complexes (PIC), respectively (Engelman and Singh, 2018Engelman A.N. Singh P.K. Cellular and molecular mechanisms of HIV-1 integration targeting.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2018; 75: 2491-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar; Hu and Hughes, 2012Hu W.-S. Hughes S.H. HIV-1 reverse transcription.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2012; 2: a006882Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The fact that reverse transcription and integration are rare events in an infected cell, and the transient nature of these processes, precluded a detailed biochemical and structural characterization of RTC and PIC so far. Initially, the viral capsid was assumed to rapidly disassemble upon entry into the cytosol, but more recent evidence indicated that incoming capsids remain intact at least through the initial stages of reverse transcription (Arhel et al., 2007Arhel N.J.

Zhang Y. Freed E.O. Peng K. Multiple Roles of HIV-1 Capsid during the Virus Replication Cycle.Virol. Sin. 2019; 34: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The capsid structure has been suggested to play a crucial role during early replication, including intracellular trafficking, protection of RTC/PIC against innate immune sensing and import of the genome into the nucleus (Ambrose and Aiken, 2014Ambrose Z.

The transport of the HIV-1 RTC/PIC toward the nucleus relies on microtubules (MTs) (Arhel et al., 2006Arhel N. Genovesio A. Kim K.-A. Miko S. Perret E. Olivo-Marin J.-C. Shorte S. Charneau P.

Commun. 2015; 6: 6660Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Perinuclear movements and docking of subviral complexes to the nuclear envelope might be mediated by the actin cytoskeleton (Arhel et al., 2006Arhel N. Genovesio A. Kim K.-A. Miko S. Perret E. Olivo-Marin J.-C. Shorte S. Charneau P. Quantitative four-dimensional tracking of cytoplasmic and nuclear HIV-1 complexes.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), but also the relocation of NUP358/RanBP2 from the nuclear pore complex (NPC) to cytosolic CA mediated by kinesin-1 was observed to precede nuclear import of HIV-1 PIC (Dharan et al., 2016Dharan A. Talley S. Tripathi A. Mamede J.I. Majetschak M. Hope T.J. Campbell E.M. KIF5B and Nup358 Cooperatively Mediate the Nuclear Import of HIV-1 during Infection.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12: e1005700Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Nuclear import of the PIC and integration of HIV-1 genomic DNA into the host genome are interconnected processes. They are essential for productive HIV-1 infection, but also for the establishment of the HIV-1 latent reservoir, a silenced pool of replication-competent proviruses persisting in resting CD4+ T cells and resistant to antiretroviral therapy (ART) (Lusic and Siliciano, 2017Lusic M. Siliciano R.F. Nuclear landscape of HIV-1 infection and integration.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2017; 15: 69-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Active nuclear import of the PIC is facilitated by a nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the cyclophilin A (CypA)-binding loop of CA that is recognized by the nuclear transport receptor transportin (Fernandez et al., 2019Fernandez J. Machado A.K. Lyonnais S. Chamontin C. Gärtner K. Léger T. Henriquet C. Garcia C. Portilho D.M. Pugnière M. et al.Transportin-1 binds to the HIV-1 capsid via a nuclear localization signal and triggers uncoating.Nat. Microbiol. 2019; 4: 1840-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Several nucleoporins (NUPs), most notably the FG-repeat containing NUP358 and NUP153 were also reported to facilitate nuclear entry of HIV-1 (Brass et al., 2008Brass A.L. Dykxhoorn D.M. Benita Y.

Although NUP358 may mediate docking of the complex to the cytoplasmic face of the NPC (Dharan et al., 2016Dharan A. Talley S. Tripathi A. Mamede J.I. Majetschak M. Hope T.J. Campbell E.M. KIF5B and Nup358 Cooperatively Mediate the Nuclear Import of HIV-1 during Infection.PLoS Pathog. 2016; 12: e1005700Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), it remains unclear how HIV-1 complexes cross the central channel. Once viral complexes have reached the nuclear basket, they can interact with NUP153 via a hydrophobic pocket on CA hexamers to promote the final steps of PIC translocation (Campbell and Hope, 2015Campbell E.M. Hope T.J. HIV-1 capsid: the multifaceted key player in HIV-1 infection.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2015; 13: 471-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar; Matreyek et al., 2013Matreyek K.A. Yücel S.S.

Host cofactors and pharmacologic ligands share an essential interface in HIV-1 capsid that is lost upon disassembly.PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10: e1004459Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The nuclear protein cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 6 (CPSF6) was suggested to compete with NUP153 for the common binding site on CA (Matreyek et al., 2013Matreyek K.A. Yücel S.S. Li X. Engelman A. Nucleoporin NUP153 phenylalanine-glycine motifs engage a common binding pocket within the HIV-1 capsid protein to mediate lentiviral infectivity.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9: e1003693Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), resulting in the release of the PIC into the nucleus (Bejarano et al., 2019Bejarano D.A. Peng K. Laketa V. Börner K. Jost K.L. Lucic B. Glass B. Lusic M. Müller B. Kräusslich H.-G. HIV-1 nuclear import in macrophages is regulated by CPSF6-capsid interactions at the nuclear pore complex.eLife. 2019; 8: e41800Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Importantly however, the HIV-1 capsid is ∼60 nm wide at the broad end of the cone (Briggs et al., 2003Briggs J.A.G. Wilk T. Welker R. Kräusslich H.-G. Fuller S.D. Structural organization of authentic, mature HIV-1 virions and cores.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1707-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar; Mattei et al., 2016Mattei S. Glass B. Hagen W.J.H.

The structure and flexibility of conical HIV-1 capsids determined within intact virions.Science. 2016; 354: 1434-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), which considerably exceeds the inner diameter of NPCs as seen in cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures obtained from isolated nuclear envelopes, which is only ∼40 nm (von Appen et al., 2015von Appen A. Kosinski J. Sparks L. Ori A. DiGuilio A.L. Vollmer B. Mackmull M.-T. Banterle N. Parca L. Kastritis P. et al.In situ structural analysis of the human nuclear pore complex.Nature. 2015; 526: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Although this discrepancy in size suggests that the PIC cannot pass the central channel without breaking the CA lattice, recent structural analyses in intact cells indicated that NPCs may occur in a dilated conformation under certain circumstances (Beck and Baumeister, 2016Beck M. Baumeister W. Cryo-Electron Tomography: Can it Reveal the Molecular Sociology of Cells in Atomic Detail?.Trends Cell Biol. 2016; 26: 825-837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, the NPC structure has never been studied in the relevant cell types under conditions of HIV-1 infection; thus, the physiological relevance of the latter observation for HIV-1 nuclear import remains unknown. At least a partial dissociation of the HIV-1 capsid lattice (uncoating) is a prerequisite for the release of the PIC prior to genome integration, but the timing, cellular location, and extent of capsid uncoating are still not clear and might be cell-type-specific. Several models have been put forward, including gradual uncoating with concomitant reverse transcription during cytosolic trafficking, reverse transcription within largely intact capsids followed by their uncoating at the NPC, or several spatially separated uncoating steps that are finalized only in the nucleus (Campbell and Hope, 2015Campbell E.M.

Transportin 3 promotes a nuclear maturation step required for efficient HIV-1 integration.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7: e1002194Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recent data indicate that HIV-1 nuclear import precedes the completion of reverse transcription (Dharan et al., 2020Dharan A. Bachmann N. Talley S. Zwikelmaier V. Campbell E.M.

Tracking experiments of individual HIV-1 complexes by fluorescent microscopy in living cells supported capsid uncoating within the cytosol (Mamede et al., 2017Mamede J.I. Cianci G.C. Anderson M.R.

However, whether the lattice structure remains intact in these complexes or alternatively, CA remains associated with the RTC/PIC despite lattice disassembly, remains unknown. To address these questions, we employed 3D correlative fluorescence light and electron microscopy (CLEM), cryoelectron tomography (cryo-ET) and subtomogram averaging to examine the ultrastructure of early HIV-1 replication complexes during cytosolic transport and nuclear import in an infected human CD4+ T cell line. Chemical fixation is commonly used to inactivate infectious particles. However, it negatively affects the structural preservation of the sample. In order to study the ultrastructure of early HIV-1 replication complexes in cryo-immobilized infected cells at biosafety level 1, we constructed an HIV-1 expression plasmid (pNNHIV) for production of the non-infectious RT-competent HIV-1 derivative NNHIV (Figures 1A, S1A, and S1B). Two point mutations were introduced into the IN active site to prevent integration of the proviral genome. Furthermore, the viral accessory protein Tat was truncated in order to block transactivation of HIV-1 transcription. Digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) confirmed that NNHIV reverse transcription kinetics in infected SupT1-R5 cells (Figure 1B and 1C) was similar to that previously reported for wild-type HIV-1 (Zila et al., 2019Zila V. Müller T.G. Laketa V. Müller B. Kräusslich H.-G. Analysis of CA Content and CPSF6 Dependence of Early HIV-1 Replication Complexes in SupT1-R5 Cells.mBio. 2019; 10: e02501-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Late RT products (gag) of NNHIV were detected from 3 h post-infection (p.i.) onward and peaked at 12 h p.i. with the majority of late RT products synthesized between 3 and 6 h p.i., while parental virus showed a minor increase up to 48 h p.i. (Figure 1B). This is consistent with our previous findings (Zila et al., 2019Zila V. Müller T.G. Laketa V. Müller B. Kräusslich H.-G. Analysis of CA Content and CPSF6 Dependence of Early HIV-1 Replication Complexes in SupT1-R5 Cells.mBio. 2019; 10: e02501-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). NNHIV 2-LTR (long terminal repeat) circles, a surrogate for replication complexes transported into the nucleus, were detected from 6 h p.i. onward; the strong accumulation of 2-LTR circles in NNHIV infected cells compared to those infected with the wild-type virus (Figure 1C) was indicative of the block in NNHIV genome integration. No specific ddPCR products were detected upon NNHIV infection in the presence of the nucleoside RT inhibitor efavirenz (EFV) (Figures 1B and 1C).

https://openalex.org/W3127467109,"The D1- and D2-dopamine receptors (D1R and D2R), which signal through Gs and Gi, respectively, represent the principal stimulatory and inhibitory dopamine receptors in the central nervous system. D1R and D2R also represent the main therapeutic targets for Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, and many other neuropsychiatric disorders, and insight into their signaling is essential for understanding both therapeutic and side effects of dopaminergic drugs. Here, we report four cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of D1R-Gs and D2R-Gi signaling complexes with selective and non-selective dopamine agonists, including two currently used anti-Parkinson’s disease drugs, apomorphine and bromocriptine. These structures, together with mutagenesis studies, reveal the conserved binding mode of dopamine agonists, the unique pocket topology underlying ligand selectivity, the conformational changes in receptor activation, and potential structural determinants for G protein-coupling selectivity. These results provide both a molecular understanding of dopamine signaling and multiple structural templates for drug design targeting the dopaminergic system."

Elevated iron levels are present in 1%-5% of individuals; however, iron overload is undermonitored and underdiagnosed. Genetic factors affecting iron homeostasis are emerging. Individuals with hereditary xerocytosis, a rare disorder with gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in mechanosensitive PIEZO1 ion channel, develop age-onset iron overload. We show that constitutive or macrophage expression of a GOF Piezo1 allele in mice disrupts levels of the iron regulator hepcidin and causes iron overload. We further show that PIEZO1 is a key regulator of macrophage phagocytic activity and subsequent erythrocyte turnover. Strikingly, we find that E756del, a mild GOF PIEZO1 allele present in one-third of individuals of African descent, is strongly associated with increased plasma iron. Our study links macrophage mechanotransduction to iron metabolism and identifies a genetic risk factor for increased iron levels in African Americans."
https://openalex.org/W3126888268,"There is growing evidence that thrombotic and inflammatory pathways contribute to the severity of COVID-19. Common medications such as aspirin, that mitigate these pathways, may decrease COVID-19 mortality. This retrospective assessment was designed to quantify the correlation between pre-diagnosis aspirin and mortality for COVID-19 positive patients in our care. Data from the Veterans Health Administration national electronic health record database was utilized for the evaluation. Veterans from across the country with a first positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction lab result were included in the evaluation which comprised 35,370 patients from March 2, 2020 to September 13, 2020 for the 14-day mortality cohort and 32,836 patients from March 2, 2020 to August 28, 2020 for the 30-day mortality cohort. Patients were matched via propensity scores and the odds of mortality were then compared. Among COVID-19 positive Veterans, preexisting aspirin prescription was associated with a statistically and clinically significant decrease in overall mortality at 14-days (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.32–0.46) and at 30-days (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.33–0.45), cutting the odds of mortality by more than half. Findings demonstrated that pre-diagnosis aspirin prescription was strongly associated with decreased mortality rates for Veterans diagnosed with COVID-19. Prospective evaluation is required to more completely assess this correlation and its implications for patient care."
https://openalex.org/W3126978830,"The current study involves the biogenesis of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO 2 NPs) by using Moringa oleifera Lam. aqueous leaf extract for the reduction of titanium dioxide salt into TiO 2 nanoparticles. The biosynthesized TiO 2 nanoparticles were observed by using the UV-visible spectrophotometry, SEM, EDX and XRD analytical methods. It was confirmed that the nanoparticles are crystalline and exist in the size range of 10–100 nm. The FTIR analysis confirmed the presence of O-H (hydrogen bonding), N-H (amide), C-C (alkanes) and C-I (Iodo-stretch) functional groups responsible for the stabilization of nanoparticles. Various concentrations (20, 40, 60 and 80 mg/L) of TiO 2 NPs were applied exogenously on wheat plants infected with a fungus Bipolaris sorokiniana responsible to cause spot blotch disease at different time intervals. The measurement of disease incidence and percent disease index showed the time-dependent response and 40 mg/L was reported a stable concentration of TiO 2 NPs to reduce the disease severity. The effects of biosynthesized TiO 2 NPs were also evaluated for agro-morphological (leaf and root surface area, plant fresh and dry weight and yield parameters), physiological (relative water content, membrane stability index and chlorophyll content) and non-enzymatic metabolites (soluble sugar, protein, soluble phenol and flavonoid content) in wheat plants under biotic stress and 40 mg/L concentration of TiO 2 NPs was found to be effective to elicit modifications to reduce biotic stress. The current study highlights the significant role of biosynthesized TiO 2 NPs in controlling fungal diseases of wheat plants and thus ultimately improving the quality and yield of wheat plants."
https://openalex.org/W3127000991,"Background A high proportion of COVID-19 patients were reported to have cardiac involvements. Data pertaining to cardiac sequalae is of urgent importance to define subsequent cardiac surveillance. Methods We performed a systematic cardiac screening for 97 consecutive COVID-19 survivors including electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography, serum troponin and NT-proBNP assay 1–4 weeks after hospital discharge. Treadmill exercise test and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) were performed according to initial screening results. Results The mean age was 46.5 ± 18.6 years; 53.6% were men. All were classified with non-severe disease without overt cardiac manifestations and did not require intensive care. Median hospitalization stay was 17 days and median duration from discharge to screening was 11 days. Cardiac abnormalities were detected in 42.3% including sinus bradycardia (29.9%), newly detected T-wave abnormality (8.2%), elevated troponin level (6.2%), newly detected atrial fibrillation (1.0%), and newly detected left ventricular systolic dysfunction with elevated NT-proBNP level (1.0%). Significant sinus bradycardia with heart rate below 50 bpm was detected in 7.2% COVID-19 survivors, which appeared to be self-limiting and recovered over time. For COVID-19 survivors with persistent elevation of troponin level after discharge or newly detected T wave abnormality, echocardiography and CMR did not reveal any evidence of infarct, myocarditis, or left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Conclusion Cardiac abnormality is common amongst COVID-survivors with mild disease, which is mostly self-limiting. Nonetheless, cardiac surveillance in form of ECG and/or serum biomarkers may be advisable to detect more severe cardiac involvement including atrial fibrillation and left ventricular dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W3128572634,"Niclosamide (NIC) has demonstrated promising in vitro antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Though NIC is already FDA-approved, administration of the currently available oral formulation results in systemic drug levels that are too low for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesized that the co-formulation of NIC with an endogenous protein, human lysozyme (hLYS), could enable the direct aerosol delivery of the drug to the respiratory tract as an alternative to oral delivery, thereby effectively treating COVID-19 by targeting the primary site of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition and spread. To test this hypothesis, we engineered and optimized composite particles containing NIC and hLYS suitable for delivery to the upper and lower airways via dry powder inhaler, nebulizer, and nasal spray. The novel formulation demonstrates potent in vitro and in vivo activity against two coronavirus strains, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and may offer protection against methicillin-resistance staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and inflammatory lung damage occurring secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infections. The suitability of the formulation for all stages of the disease and low-cost development approach will ensure rapid clinical development and wide-spread utilization."
https://openalex.org/W3126530094,"Background Previous studies have highlighted the increased risk of contracting the COVID-19 for health-care workers and suggest that oral health-care workers may carry the greatest risk. Considering the transmission route of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, a similar increased risk can be hypothesized for other respiratory infections. However, no study has specifically assessed the risk of contracting COVID-19 within the dental profession. Methods An online survey was conducted within a population of French dental professionals between April 1 and April 29, 2020. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to explore risk indicators associated with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and COVID-19-related clinical phenotypes (i.e. phenotypes present in 15% or more of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases). Results 4172 dentists and 1868 dental assistants responded to the survey, representing approximately 10% of French oral health-care workers. The prevalence of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 was 1.9% for dentists and 0.8% for dental assistants. Higher prevalence was found for COVID-19-related clinical phenotypes both in dentists (15.0%) and dental assistants (11.8%). Chronic kidney disease and obesity were associated with increased odds of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, whereas working in a practice limited to endodontics was associated with decreased odds. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, use of public transportation and having a practice limited to periodontology were associated with increased odds of presenting a COVID-19-related clinical phenotype. Moreover, changes in work rhythm or clinical practice were associated with decreased odds of both outcomes. Conclusions Although oral health-care professionals were surprisingly not at higher risk of COVID-19 than the general population, specific risk indicators could exist, notably among high aerosol-generating dental subspecialties such as periodontology. Considering the similarities between COVID-19-related clinical phenotypes other viral respiratory infections, lessons can be learned from the COVID-19 pandemic regarding the usefulness of equipping and protecting oral health-care workers, notably during seasonal viral outbreaks, to limit infection spread. Impact Results from this study may provide important insights for relevant health authorities regarding the overall infection status of oral health-care workers in the current pandemic and draw attention to particular at-risk groups, as illustrated in the present study. Protecting oral health-care workers could be an interesting public health strategy to prevent the resurgence of COVID-19 and/or the emergence of new pandemics."
https://openalex.org/W3126281967,"Background There is limited evidence on the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Latin America. We present findings from a nationwide study in Argentina. Research question What is disease severity measures and risk factors are associated with admission to an intensive care unit and mortality? Study design and methods Data were extracted from the COVID-19 database of the Integrated Argentina Health Information System, encompassing the period of March 3rd to October 2nd, 2020, using a standardized case report form that included information on contact history, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical diagnosis. Information was collected at the initial site of care and follow-up conducted through calls by the regional healthcare authorities. A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined as having a positive result through sequencing or real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. Results RT-PCR testing was positive in 738,776 cases. Complete datasets were available for analysis in 207,079 cases. Mean age was 42.9±18.8 years, 50.0% were males. Frequent co-existing conditions included hypertension (19.2%), diabetes (9.7%), asthma (6.1%) and obesity (5.2%). Most common symptoms included fever (58.5%), cough (58.0%), headache (45.4%), and sore throat (42.1%). Death or ICU admission were independently associated with older age, male, coma, dyspnea or tachypnea, and seizures, with underlying co-morbidities such as immunodeficiency, chronic renal failure, and liver disease showing the strongest effects. Interpretation Most cases of COVID-19 diagnosed in Argentina were mild and had a favorable outcome, but fatality rates were relatively elevated. Risk factors for adverse outcome included older age, male sex, coma and seizures, and the concurrent presence of several morbidities. These data may be useful for healthcare providers and healthcare policy makers of low-middle income and Latin American countries to guide decisions toward optimized care during the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3127644946,"Electrical stimulation is a promising tool for modulating brain networks. However, it is unclear how stimulation interacts with neural patterns underlying behavior. Specifically, how might external stimulation that is not sensitive to the state of ongoing neural dynamics reliably augment neural processing and improve function? Here, we tested how low-frequency epidural alternating current stimulation (ACS) in non-human primates recovering from stroke interacted with task-related activity in perilesional cortex and affected grasping. We found that ACS increased co-firing within task-related ensembles and improved dexterity. Using a neural network model, we found that simulated ACS drove ensemble co-firing and enhanced propagation of neural activity through parts of the network with impaired connectivity, suggesting a mechanism to link increased co-firing to enhanced dexterity. Together, our results demonstrate that ACS restores neural processing in impaired networks and improves dexterity following stroke. More broadly, these results demonstrate approaches to optimize stimulation to target neural dynamics."

This study investigated C . coli and C . jejuni from live food animals, poultry carcasses at production, and retail meat in North Carolina between January 2018-December 2019. Whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics were used for phenotypic and genotypic characterization to compare AMR profiles, virulence factors associated with Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) ( neuABC and cst-II or cst-III ), and phylogenic linkage between 541 Campylobacter isolates ( C . coli n = 343, C . jejuni n = 198). Overall, 90.4% (489/541) Campylobacter isolates tested positive for AMR genes, while 43% (233/541) carried resistance genes for three or more antibiotic classes and were classified molecularly multidrug resistant. AMR gene frequencies were highest against tetracyclines (64.3%), beta-lactams (63.6%), aminoglycosides (38.6%), macrolides (34.8%), quinolones (24.4%), lincosamides (13.5%), and streptothricins (5%). A total of 57.6% (114/198) C . jejuni carried GBS virulence factors, while three C . coli carried the C . jejuni -like lipooligosaccharide locus, neu ABC and cst-II . Further evidence of C . coli and C . jejuni interspecies genomic exchange was observed in identical multilocus sequence typing, shared sequence type (ST) 7818 clonal complex 828, and identical species-indicator genes mapA , ceuE , and hipO . There was a significant increase in novel STs from 2018 to 2019 (2 in 2018 and 21 in 2019, p&lt;0.002), illustrating variable Campylobacter genomes within food animal production. Introgression between C . coli and C . jejuni may aid pathogen adaption, lead to higher AMR and increase Campylobacter persistence in food processing. Future studies should further characterize interspecies gene transfer and evolutionary trends in food animal production to track evolving risks to public health."
https://openalex.org/W3128035221,"As of mid-August 2020, Brazil was the country with the second-highest number of cases and deaths by the COVID-19 pandemic, but with large regional and social differences. In this study, using data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health, we analyze the spatial patterns of infection and mortality from Covid-19 across small areas of Brazil. We apply spatial autoregressive Bayesian models and estimate the risks of infection and mortality, taking into account age, sex composition of the population and other variables that describe the health situation of the spatial units. We also perform a decomposition analysis to study how age composition impacts the differences in mortality and infection rates across regions. Our results indicate that death and infections are spatially distributed, forming clusters and hotspots, especially in the Northern Amazon, Northeast coast and Southeast of the country. The high mortality risk in the Southeast part of the country, where the major cities are located, can be explained by the high proportion of the elderly in the population. In the less developed areas of the North and Northeast, there are high rates of infection among young adults, people of lower socioeconomic status, and people without access to health care, resulting in more deaths."
https://openalex.org/W3128307242,"Measurement of neural tracking of natural running speech from the electroencephalogram (EEG) is an increasingly popular method in auditory neuroscience and has applications in audiology. The method involves decoding the envelope of the speech signal from the EEG signal, and calculating the correlation with the envelope of the audio stream that was presented to the subject. Typically EEG systems with 64 or more electrodes are used. However, in practical applications, set-ups with fewer electrodes are required. Here, we determine the optimal number of electrodes, and the best position to place a limited number of electrodes on the scalp. We propose a channel selection strategy based on an utility metric, which allows a quick quantitative assessment of the influence of a channel (or a group of channels) on the reconstruction error. We consider two use cases: a subject-specific case, where the optimal number and position of the electrodes is determined for each subject individually, and a subject-independent case, where the electrodes are placed at the same positions (in the 10-20 system) for all the subjects. We evaluated our approach using 64-channel EEG data from 90 subjects. In the subject-specific case we found that the correlation between actual and reconstructed envelope first increased with decreasing number of electrodes, with an optimum at around 20 electrodes, yielding 29% higher correlations using the optimal number of electrodes compared to all electrodes. This means that our strategy of removing electrodes can be used to improve the correlation metric in high-density EEG recordings. In the subject-independent case, we obtained a stable decoding performance when decreasing from 64 to 22 channels. When the number of channels was further decreased, the correlation decreased. For a maximal decrease in correlation of 10%, 32 well-placed electrodes were sufficient in 91% of the subjects."

This study aimed to investigate the influence of occupational balance on health, quality of life, and other health-related variables using structural equation modeling. We analyzed data from 208 adults over 55 years old. Mean age of the participants was 70.21 years (SD 7.22). The research model for analysis was based on the results of previous studies addressing occupational balance and related variables such as stress, leisure satisfaction, life satisfaction, subjective health, quality of life, and participation. General fit indices of the final model were acceptable (x 2 /df = 1.708, p &lt; .001, RMSEA = .058, TLI = .923, CFI = .929, and SRMR = .067). Although the size of effect was small to medium (.157–.249), occupational balance was identified as an independent variable directly or indirectly affecting subjective health, quality of life, and health-related variables in the final model. Our results showed that it is possible to improve subjective health and quality of life by promoting better occupational balance. Further studies developing an intervention program based on occupational balance are required to confirm the feasibility of the intervention and its effect on older adults’ health and quality of life in real-life circumstances."

We aimed to assess the effect of cannabis in improving clinical and inflammatory outcomes in ulcerative colitis patients. Methods In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, patients received either cigarettes containing 0.5 g of dried cannabis flowers with80mgTetrahydrocannabinol (THC)or placebo cigarettes for 8 weeks. Parameters of disease including Lichtiger disease activity index, C reactive protein (CRP), calprotectin, Mayo endoscopic score and quality of life (QOL) were assessed before, during and after treatment. Results The study included 32 patients. Mean age was 30 years, 14 (43%) females. Lichtiger index improved in the cannabis group from 10.9 (IQR 9–14) to5 (IQR 1–7), (p&lt;0.000), and in the placebo group from 11 (IQR 9–13) to 8 (IQR 7–10)(p = 0.15, p between groups 0.001). QOL improved in the cannabis group from 77±4 to 98±20 (p = 0.000) but not in the placebo group (78±3 at week 0 and 78±17 at week 8;p = 0.459; p between groups 0.007). Mayo endoscopic score changed in the cannabis group from 2.13±1 to 1.25±2 (p = 0.015) and in the placebo group from 2.15±1to 1.69±1 (p = 0.367, p between groups 0.17). Conclusion Short term treatment with THC rich cannabis induced clinical remission and improved quality of life in patients with mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis. However, these beneficial clinical effects were not associated with significant anti-inflammatory improvement in the Mayo endoscopic score or laboratory markers for inflammation.(clinicaltrials.gov NCT01040910)."
https://openalex.org/W3127858332,"Background In June 2013, the city of Calgary, Alberta and surrounding areas sustained significant flooding which resulted in large scale evacuations and closure of businesses and schools. Floods can increase stress which may negatively impact perinatal outcomes and mental health, but previous research is inconsistent. The objectives of this study are to examine the impact of the flood on pregnancy health, birth outcomes and postpartum mental health. Methods Linked administrative data from the province of Alberta were used. Outcomes included preterm birth, small for gestational age, a new diagnoses of preeclampsia or gestational hypertension, and a diagnosis of, or drug prescription for, depression or anxiety. Data were analyzed using a quasi-experimental difference in difference design, comparing flooded and non-flooded areas and in affected and unaffected time periods. Multivariable log binomial regression models were used to estimate risk ratios, adjusted for maternal age. Marginal probabilities for the difference in difference term were used to show the potential effect of the flood. Results Participants included 18,266 nulliparous women for the pregnancy outcomes, and 26,956 women with infants for the mental health analysis. There were no effects for preterm birth (DID 0.00, CI: -0.02, 0.02), small for gestational age (DID 0.00, CI: -0.02, 0.02), or new cases of preeclampsia (DID 0.00, CI: -0.01, 0.01). There was a small increase in new cases of gestational hypertension (DID 0.02, CI: 0.01, 0.03) in flood affected areas. There were no differences in postpartum anxiety or depression prescriptions or diagnoses. Conclusion The Calgary 2013 flood was associated with a minor increase in gestational hypertension and not other health outcomes. Universal prenatal care and magnitude of the disaster may have minimized impacts of the flood on pregnant women."

In this study, the chemical composition of different moss extracts of Hedwigia ciliata P. Beauv. have been examined, as well as their antioxidant, antineurodegenerative/anti-neuroinflammatory, antidiabetic, and antiproliferative potential. The extracts were prepared by Soxhlet extractor using solvents of different polarity. Chemical characterization of the extracts revealed the presence of phenolics and flavonoid compounds, together with triterpenoids as secondary metabolites of high biological activity. Significant antioxidant properties of all the extracts were exhibited using the β-carotene assay. The highest activities were found for water:ethanol extract (with the highest inhibition rate of 96%), but also significant inhibition was measured for ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts (80% and 70%, respectively). Confirmation of biocompatibility of investigated moss extracts has been performed using normal human fibroblast cell line, MRC-5. The H . ciliata extracts exhibited significant antiproliferative activity (~ 50%) against the MDA-MB-231 (human breast adenocarcinoma cell line), which has not previously been reported elsewhere. The Griess assay confirmed the potential anti-neuroinflammatory activity of the extracts, as significant effects in reducing NO production by LPS-stimulated BV2 (normal murine microglia cell line) was observed. This data is in line with noted antineurodegenerative potential measured by the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (with the highest inhibition rate of 60% for ethyl acetate extract) and tyrosinase (with the highest inhibition rate of 70% for ethanol extract). Additionally, the H . ciliata extracts exhibited significant antidiabetic effect mediated by α-glucosidase inhibition (with the highest inhibition rate of 80% for ethyl acetate extract). The obtained data suggest the presence of immunomodulatory effects of the moss extracts in vitro , which allows the design of new experiments aimed at detecting and characterizing bioactive compounds of the extracts and additionally elucidate detailed mechanisms of their effects."

Methods Purposive sampling was used to select twenty-seven (27) participants; sixteen contact tracers, six supervisors, and five contacts of COVID-19 cases for an in-depth interview using a topic guide. These interviews were conducted on a phone or face-to-face basis whilst maintaining physical distancing protocol. All these were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Then, QSR NVivo 12 was used to analyse the data thematically. Results Contact tracers were selected based on their professional background and surveillance experience with other infectious diseases. They were trained before the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the country and before deployment. Deployment of contact tracers was in pairs to monitor contacts daily through physical visits or over the phone. Their activities included educating contacts about the condition, filling the symptoms diary, and providing psychological support. Contacts for COVID-19 were identified through case investigation, and their monitoring is done once a day despite the twice-daily requirement. Wherever a case was confirmed, enhanced contact tracing within a 2km radius was done. Furthermore, it was reported that some contacts were not adhering to the self-quarantine. In addition to this, other challenges included; unstable provision of PPEs and remuneration, refusal of some contact to test, delays in receiving test results, and poor coordination of the whole process. Conclusions The study concludes that contact tracing was generally perceived to be helpful in COVID-19 containment in Ghana. However, adhering to self-quarantine protocol had many challenges for both contact tracers and the contacts. Improving coordination and quick release of test results to contacts is necessary for COVID-19 containment. Lastly, the supply of Personal Protection Equipment and motivation needs to be addressed to help position the country well for effective contact tracing."

Fieldwork and participatory meetings were carried out between September 2017 and January 2018. A total of 419 emic use reports including 150 from Kaski and 269 from Baitadi were reported from 58 ethnomedicinal plant species. Each species was reported for 2–43 use reports and each participant recorded 1–12 use reports. About 25% (n = 104) use reports were associated with the treatment of digestive system disorders followed by 83 for general complaints. Of the species assessed, 53 species had IASc value &lt; 0.25 and only five species had &gt; 0.25. Species Swertia chirayita , Paris polyphylla , Bergenia ciliata , Valeriana jatamansi and Centella asiatica with &gt; 0.25 IASc were found to be highly consented; however they were incongruent between the sample groups and sites. Divergent plant use knowledge specific to each sample district and group was corresponding to the heterogeneity of socio-economy and culture of the sites. Gender, ethnicity, household economy and food availability of the respondents were leading factors affecting the plant use knowledge. Despite the sites were relatively homogenous in eco-physiography, they possessed the distinct plant use knowledge, hinted that the socio-economic factors are more explanatory in plant use knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W3128042491,"Background Antibiotic resistance is a leading global public health concern and antibiotic use is a key driver. Effective interventions are needed to target key stakeholders, including general practitioners (GPs). In Malta, little is known about factors that influence GPs’ antibiotic prescribing, making it challenging to implement targeted interventions. We therefore aimed to explore GPs’ understanding of antibiotic use and resistance, and describe their perceived barriers and facilitators to prudent antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory tract infections in Malta. Methods Face-to-face individual semi-structured interviews were held with a quota sample of 20 GPs in 2014. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and later analysed iteratively using manifest and latent content analysis. Findings were collated in a socioecological model to depict how GPs as individuals are embedded within larger social systems and contexts, and how each component within this system impacts their prescribing behaviour. Findings We found that GPs’ antibiotic prescribing decisions are complex and impacted by numerous barriers and facilitators at the individual, interpersonal, organisational, community, and public policy level. Predominant factors found to impact GPs’ antibiotic prescribing included not only intrinsic GP factors such as knowledge, awareness, experience, and misconceptions, but also several external factors. At the interpersonal level, GPs’ perceived patient demand and behaviour to be a persistent issue that impacts their prescribing decisions. Similarly, some GPs found pressure from drug reps to be concerning despite being considered an important source of information. Organisational and public policy-level issues such as lack of access to relevant antibiotic prescribing guidelines and current antibiotic resistance data from the community, were also considered major barriers to appropriate antibiotic prescribing. Utilisation of diagnostic testing was found to be low and GPs’ perceptions on the introduction of rapid point-of-care tests to support antibiotic prescription decisions, were mixed. Conclusion This study revealed the complexity of the antibiotic prescribing decision and the numerous barriers and facilitators that impact it, visualised through a socioecological model. Addressing GPs’ antibiotic prescribing practices will require targeted and coordinated implementation activities at all levels to change behaviour and address misconceptions, whilst also improving the physical and social environment.

https://openalex.org/W3129044554,"Introduction Danish women exit cervical cancer screening at age 65 years, but 23% of cervical cancer cases occur beyond this age. In addition, due to gradual implementation of cervical cancer screening, older women are underscreened by today´s standards. A one-time screening with HPV test was therefore offered to Danish women born before 1948. Methods Register based study reporting histology diagnoses and conizations in women found HPV positive in the one-time screening. Number and proportion of women with severe or non-severe histology results were calculated for screened and HPV-positive women by age group or region of residence. Number of women with biopsy and/or conization per case of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) or CIN3+ were also calculated by age groups and region. Results 4,479 (4.1% of screened women) had positive HPV test. 94% of these had one or more additional tests. 2,785 (62%) of HPV-positive women had histology results, and conization was performed in 1,076 (24% of HPV-positive and 1% of all screened women). HPV positivity and CIN3+ detection varied little between regions, but the proportions of HPV positive women undergoing histology varied between regions from 40% to 86% and the proportion with conization from 13% to 36%. Correspondingly, the number of histologies and conizations per CIN3+ detected varied from 5.9 to 11.2 and 1.8 to 4.7, respectively. In total, 514 CIN2+ (0.47% of screened women, 11% of HPV-positive) and 337 CIN3+ (0.31% of screened women, 7.5% of HPV-positive) were diagnosed, including 37 cervical cancer cases. Discussion HPV screening of insufficiently screened birth cohorts can potentially prevent morbidity and mortality from cervical cancer but longer follow-up is needed to see if cancer incidence declines in the screened women in the coming years. Management strategies differed among regions which influenced the proportions undergoing biopsy/conization."

https://openalex.org/W3127987013,"Amoeboid cells constantly change shape and extend protrusions. The direction of movement is not random, but is correlated with the direction of movement in the preceding minutes. The basis of this correlation is an underlying memory of direction. The presence of memory in movement is known for many decades, but its molecular mechanism is still largely unknown. This study reports in detail on the information content of directional memory, the kinetics of learning and forgetting this information, and the molecular basis for memory using Dictyostelium mutants. Two types of memory were characterized. A short-term memory stores for ~20 seconds the position of the last pseudopod using a local modification of the branched F-actin inducer SCAR/WAVE, which enhances one new pseudopod to be formed at the position of the previous pseudopod. A long term memory stores for ~2 minutes the activity of the last ~10 pseudopods using a cGMP-binding protein that induces myosin filaments in the rear of the cell; this inhibits pseudopods in the rear and thereby enhances pseudopods in the global front. Similar types of memory were identified in human neutrophils and mesenchymal stem cells, the protist Dictyostelium and the fungus B . d . chytrid . The synergy of short- and long-term memory explains their role in persistent movement for enhanced cell dispersal, food seeking and chemotaxis."
https://openalex.org/W3128181869,"Background Thalassemia is a severe disease that occurs due to abnormalities in hemoglobin genes. Various genetic factors in different populations lead to different clinical manifestations of thalassemia disease, particularly among people who have a long history of migration and who have married among tribes, such as the hill tribe people in Thailand. This genetic epidemiological study aimed to estimate the prevalence of various forms of thalassemia among the six main hill tribe populations in Thailand. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted to obtain information and blood specimens from school children belonging to one of the six main hill tribes in Thailand: Akha, Lau, Hmong, Yao, Karen, and Lisu. Hill tribe children who were attending grades 4–6 in 13 selected schools in Chiang Rai Province, Thailand, were invited to participate in the study. A validated questionnaire and 3 mL blood specimens were collected after obtaining information consent forms from both the children and their parents on a voluntary basis. A complete blood count (CBC) was performed, followed by osmotic fragility (OF) and dichlorophenol indophenol precipitation (DCIP) tests to screen for thalassemia. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were used to identify hemoglobin type and α-thalassemia, respectively. A t-test, chi-square and logistic regression were used to detect the associations between variables at the significance level of α = 0.05. Results A total of 1,200 participants from 6 different tribes were recruited for the study; 50.0% were males, and 67.3% were aged 11–12 years. The overall prevalence of thalassemia carriers according to the screening tests was 9.8% (117 of 1,200). Among the cases, 83 were A2A (59 cases were α-thalassemia 1 carrier or α-thalassemia 2 carrier or homozygous α-thalassemia 2, and 24 cases were β-thalassemia trait with or without α-thalassemia); 1 case was EE (homozygous Hb E with or without α-thalassemia); 31 cases were EA (30 cases were the Hb E trait, and 1 case was Hb E trait with or without α-thalassemia); 1 case was A2A Bart’s H (Hb H disease α-thalassemia 1/α-thalassemia 2); and 1 case was A2A with abnormal Hb. The prevalence of the α-thalassemia 1 trait among the hill tribe population was 2.5%. The greatest prevalence of the α-thalassemia 1 trait was found in the Karen (3.0%) and Hmong (3.0%) tribes. Conclusions The prevalence of some forms of thalassemia in the hill tribe population is higher than that in the Thai and other populations. Effective and available thalassemia screening tests, including essential information to protect the next generation through the specific counseling clinic, are crucial, particularly due to increasing marriages within these populations."
https://openalex.org/W3128383908,"Ultrasound is considered a safe and non-invasive tool in regenerative medicine and has been used in the clinic for more than twenty years for applications in bone healing after the approval of the Exogen device, also known as low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS). Beyond its effects on bone health, LIPUS has also been investigated for wound healing of soft tissues, with positive results for various cell processes including cell proliferation, migration and angiogenesis. As LIPUS has the potential to treat chronic skin wounds, we sought to evaluate the effects produced by a conventional therapeutic ultrasound device at low intensities (also considered LIPUS) on the migration capacity of mouse and human skin mesenchymal precursors (s-MPs). Cells were stimulated for 3 days (20 minutes per day) using a traditional ultrasound device with the following parameters: 100 mW/cm 2 with 20% duty cycle and frequency of 3 MHz. At the parameters used, ultrasound failed to affect s-MP proliferation, with no evident changes in morphology or cell groupings, and no changes at the cytoskeletal level. Further, the migration and invasion ability of s-MPs were unaffected by the ultrasound protocol, and no major changes were detected in the gene/protein expression of ROCK1, integrin β1, laminin β1, type I collagen and transforming growth factor β1. Finally, RNA-seq analysis revealed that only 10 genes were differentially expressed after ultrasound stimulation. Among them, 5 encode for small nuclear RNAs and 2 encode for proteins belonging to the nuclear pore complex. Considering the results overall, while the viability of s-MPs was not affected by ultrasound stimulation and no changes were detected in proliferation/migration, RNA-seq analysis would suggest that s-MPs do respond to ultrasound. The use of 100 mW/cm 2 intensity or conventional therapeutic ultrasound devices might not be optimal for the stimulation the properties of cell populations. Future studies should investigate the potential application of ultrasound using variations of the tested parameters."
https://openalex.org/W3129038266,"Background Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation [rTMS] is increasingly being used to treat Major Depressive Disorder [MDD]. Given that not all patients respond to rTMS, it would be clinically useful to have reliable biomarkers that predict treatment response. Oxidized phosphatidylcholine [OxPC] and some oxylipins are important plasma biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation. Not only is depression associated with oxidative stress, but rTMS has been shown to have anti-oxidative effects. Objectives To investigate whether plasma oxolipidomics profiles could predict treatment response in patients with treatment resistant MDD. Methods Fourty-eight patients undergoing rTMS treatment for MDD were recruited along with nine healthy control subjects. Plasma OxPCs and oxylipins were extracted and analyzed through high performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Patients with a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score [Ham-D] ≤7 post-treatment were defined as having entered remission. Results Fifty-seven OxPC and 32 oxylipin species were identified in our subjects. MDD patients who entered remission following rTMS had significantly higher pre-rTMS levels of total and fragmented OxPCs compared to non-remitters and controls [one-way ANOVA, p&lt;0.05]. However, no significant changes in OxPC levels were found as a result of rTMS, regardless of treatment response [p&gt;0.05]. No differences in plasma oxylipins were found between remitters and non-remitters at baseline. Conclusion Certain categories of OxPCs may be useful predictive biomarkers for response to rTMS treatment in MDD. Given that elevated oxidized lipids may indicate higher levels of oxidative stress and inflammation in the brain, patients with this phenotype of depression may be more receptive to rTMS treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3128697691,"Background Conflicting evidence still prevails concerning the effect of preovulatory elevated progesterone (EP 4 ) on reproductive outcomes in fresh embryo transfer (ET). However, few studies have analyzed the effect of EP 4 on the likelihood of pregnancy using multivariate regression approach. The potential confounding factors tested in these studies were limited to either patient’s characteristics or to stimulation related parameters. Yet, several studies have shown that postovulatory parameters such as midluteal progesterone (P 4 ) level may be considered as a proxy variable of endometrial receptivity as well. Objective The aim of the present study was to estimate the independent effect of preovulatory P 4 effect, if any, on the probability of live birth (LB) by considering the midluteal endocrine profile when controlling for the potential confounding factors. Methods This is a secondary data analysis of a cohort of fresh IVF/ICSI cycles triggered with GnRH agonist (n = 328) performed in a single IVF center during the period 2014–2016. Patients contributed only one cycle and were stratified into four groups according to preovulatory P 4 quartiles. We assessed the association between preovulatory P 4 and the odds of LB calculated by logistic regression analysis after controlling for the most clinically relevant confounders. The primary outcome measure: Live birth rates (LBR). Results Both preovulatory and midluteal P 4 were significantly correlated with the ovarian response. Logistic regression analysis showed that preovulatory serum P 4 did not have a significant impact on LBR. In contrast, midluteal serum P 4 level was an important independent factor associated with LBR. The optimal chance of LBR was achieved with midluteal serum P 4 levels of 41–60 ng/ml, [OR: 2.73 (1.29–5.78); p&lt; 0.008]. Conclusion The multivariate analysis suggests that the midluteal P 4 level seems to impact LBR more than the preovulatory P 4 level in women undergoing IVF treatment followed by fresh ET."
https://openalex.org/W3129079762,"Background Lung cancer is the highest incident cancer globally and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality particularly if identified at a late stage. Poor patient outcomes in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC’s) might reflect contextual patient and health system constraints at multiple levels, that act as barriers to prevention, disease recognition, diagnosis, and treatment. Lung cancer screening, even for high-risk patients, is not available in the public health sector in South Africa (SA), where the current HIV and tuberculosis (TB) epidemics often take precedence. Yet, there has been no formal assessment of the individual and health-system related barriers that may delay patients with lung cancer from seeking and accessing help within the public health care system and receiving the appropriate and effective diagnosis and treatment. This study aimed to derive consensus from health-system stakeholders in the urban Gauteng Province of SA on the most important challenges faced by the health services and patients in achieving optimum lung cancer management and to identify potential solutions. Methods The study was undertaken among 27 participant stakeholders representing clinical managers, clinicians, opinion leaders from the public health sector and non-governmental organisation (NGO) representatives. The study compromised two components: consensus and engagement. For the consensus component, the Delphi Technique was employed with open-ended questions and item ranking from five rounds of consensus-seeking, to achieve collective agreement on the most important challenges faced by patients and the health services in achieving optimal lung cancer management. For the engagement component, the Nominal Group Technique was used to articulate ideas and reach an agreement on the group’s recommendations for solution strategies and approaches. Results Public health sector stakeholders suggested that a lack of knowledge and awareness of lung cancer, and the apparent stigma associated with the disease and its risk factors, as well as symptoms and signs, are critical to treatment delay. Furthermore, delays in up-referral of patients with suspected lung cancer from district health care level were attributed to inadequate knowledge arising from a lack of in-service training of nurses and doctors regarding oncologic symptoms, risk factors, need for further investigation, interpretation of x-rays and available treatments. At a tertiary level, participants suggested that insufficient availability of specialised diagnostic resources (imaging, cytological and pathological services including biomolecular assessment of lung cancer), theatres, cardiothoracic surgeons, and appropriate therapeutic modalities (chemotherapeutic agents and radiation oncology) are the main barriers to the provision of optimal care. It was suggested that a primary prevention programme initiated by the government that involves private-public partnerships may improve lung cancer management nationally. Conclusions Considerable barriers to the early identification and treatment of lung cancer exist. Finding solutions to overcome both individual and health-system level obstacles to lung cancer screening and management are vital to facilitate early identification and treatment, and to improve survival. Furthermore, research on inexpensive biomarkers for asymptomatic disease detection, the introduction of diagnostic imaging tools that utilise artificial intelligence to compensate for inadequate human resources and improving clinical integration across all levels of the healthcare system are essential."

The data come from settlement-era Public Land Survey (PLS) data (ca. 0.8-km resolution) of trees recorded by land surveyors. The surveyor notes have been transcribed, cleaned, and processed to estimate stem density, basal area, and biomass at individual points. The point-level data are aggregated within 8 km grid cells and smoothed using a generalized additive statistical model that accounts for zero-inflated continuous data and provides approximate Bayesian uncertainty estimates. The statistical modeling smooths out sharp spatial features (likely arising from statistical noise) within areas smaller than about 200 km 2 . Based on this modeling, presettlement Midwestern landscapes supported multiple dominant species, vegetation types, forest types, and ecological formations. The prairies, oak savannas, and forests each had distinctive structures and spatial distributions across the domain. Forest structure varied from savanna (averaging 27 Mg/ha biomass) to northern hardwood (104 Mg/ha) and mesic southern forests (211 Mg/ha). The presettlement forests were neither unbroken and massively-statured nor dominated by young forests constantly structured by broad-scale disturbances such as fire, drought, insect outbreaks, or hurricanes. Most forests were structurally between modern second growth and old growth. We expect the data product to be useful as a baseline for investigating how forest ecosystems have changed in response to the last several centuries of climate change and intensive Euro-American land use and as a calibration dataset for paleoecological proxy-based reconstructions of forest composition and structure for earlier time periods. The data products (including raw and smoothed estimates at the 8-km scale) are available at the LTER Network Data Portal as version 1.0."
https://openalex.org/W3126944959,"Background Primary care retention, defined as ongoing periodic contact with a consistent primary care provider, is beneficial for people with serious chronic illnesses. This study examined the effect of a Housing First intervention on primary care retention among homeless individuals with mental illness. Methods Two hundred individuals enrolled in the Toronto site of the At Home Project and randomized to Housing First or Treatment As Usual were studied. Medical records were reviewed to determine if participants were retained in primary care, defined as having at least one visit with the same primary care provider in each of two consecutive six-month periods during the 12 month period preceding and following randomization. Results Medical records were obtained for 47 individuals randomized to Housing First and 40 individuals randomized to Treatment As Usual. During the one year period following randomization, the proportion of Housing First and Treatment As Usual participants retained in primary care was not significantly different (38.3% vs. 47.5%, p = 0.39). The change in primary care retention rates from the year preceding randomization to the year following randomization was +10.6% in the Housing First group and -5.0% in the Treatment As Usual group. Conclusion Among homeless individuals with mental illness, Housing First did not significantly affect primary care retention over the follow-up period. These findings suggest Housing First interventions may need to place greater emphasis on connecting clients with primary care providers."
https://openalex.org/W3127008539,"The future physiology of marine phytoplankton will be impacted by a range of changes in global ocean conditions, including salinity regimes that vary spatially and on a range of short- to geological timescales. Coccolithophores have global ecological and biogeochemical significance as the most important calcifying marine phytoplankton group. Previous research has shown that the morphology of their exoskeletal calcified plates (coccoliths) responds to changing salinity in the most abundant coccolithophore species, Emiliania huxleyi . However, the extent to which these responses may be strain-specific is not well established. Here we investigated the growth response of six strains of E . huxleyi under low (ca. 25) and high (ca. 45) salinity batch culture conditions and found substantial variability in the magnitude and direction of response to salinity change across strains. Growth rates declined under low and high salinity conditions in four of the six strains but increased under both low and high salinity in strain RCC1232 and were higher under low salinity and lower under high salinity in strain PLYB11. When detailed changes in coccolith and coccosphere size were quantified in two of these strains that were isolated from contrasting salinity regimes (coastal Norwegian low salinity of ca. 30 and Mediterranean high salinity of ca. 37), the Norwegian strain showed an average 26% larger mean coccolith size at high salinities compared to low salinities. In contrast, coccolith size in the Mediterranean strain showed a smaller size trend (11% increase) but severely impeded coccolith formation in the low salinity treatment. Coccosphere size similarly increased with salinity in the Norwegian strain but this trend was not observed in the Mediterranean strain. Coccolith size changes with salinity compiled for other strains also show variability, strongly suggesting that the effect of salinity change on coccolithophore morphology is likely to be strain specific. We propose that physiological adaptation to local conditions, in particular strategies for plasticity under stress, has an important role in determining ecotype responses to salinity."
https://openalex.org/W3128200823,"The introduction of alien species represents one of the greatest threats to biodiversity worldwide. Highway construction increases the dispersal and invasion of exotic plant species. This study examined the assembly process of the plant communities to determine whether the roadsides of the Patagonian steppe represent a reservoir and dispersal source of invasive exotic species. We analyzed the composition of exotic and native species and functional groups present in the established vegetation and seed banks of roadsides and reference areas nearby. The type of dispersal of exotic and native species at the roadsides was also evaluated. Total cover and that of exotic and native species was lower at the roadsides than in the reference areas; however, at the roadsides the cover and seed abundance of exotic species was higher than that of native species. In the roadsides vegetation, native shrubs such as Acaena splendens predominated, along with exotic perennial herbs and grasses which were mainly represented by Rumex acetosella . In the seed bank the predominant species were exotic perennial herbs, also represented by R . acetosella , annual exotic species such as Epilobium brachycarpum and Verbascum thapsus , and annual native species such as Heliotropium paronychioides . No exotic shrubs were found either at the roadsides or in the reference areas. The species at the roadsides did not present a dominant type of dispersal. The abundance of exotic species at the roadsides, both in the aboveground vegetation and the seed bank, may be due to the stressful environment and the characteristics of the species themselves, such as the ability to form seed banks. This work revealed that the roadsides of the Patagonian steppe constitute reservoirs of invasive exotic species, highlighting the importance of identifying them and controlling their spread, with a view to generating ecosystem management programs."

Primary analysis of a double-blind, cluster randomized trial of iron containing micronutrient powder supplementation in Ghanaian children aged 6 to 35 months found no difference in malaria risk between intervention and placebo groups. Here, we performed a secondary analysis of the trial data to assess the impact of long-term prophylactic iron fortificant on the risk of iron deficiency and anaemia in trial subjects. This population-based randomized-cluster trial involved 1958 children aged between 6 to 35 months, identified at home and able to eat semi-solid foods. The intervention group (n = 967) received a daily dose containing 12.5 mg elemental iron (as ferrous fumarate), vitamin A (400 μg), ascorbic acid (30 mg) and zinc (5 mg). The placebo group (n = 991) received a similar micronutrient powder but without iron. Micronutrient powder was provided daily to both groups for 5 months. At baseline and endline, health assessment questionnaires were administered and blood samples collected for analysis. The two groups had similar baseline anthropometry, anaemia, iron status, demographic characteristics, and dietary intakes (p &gt; 0.05). Of the 1904 (97.2%) children who remained at the end of the intervention, the intervention group had significantly higher haemoglobin (p = 0.0001) and serum ferritin (p = 0.0002) levels than the placebo group. Soluble transferrin receptor levels were more saturated among children from the iron group compared to non-iron group (p = 0.012). Anaemia status in the iron group improved compared to the placebo group (p = 0.03). Continued long-term routine use of micronutrient powder containing prophylactic iron reduced anaemia, iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia among pre-school children living in rural Ghana’s malaria endemic area."
https://openalex.org/W3126779088,"Bycatch of harbour porpoises ( Phocoena phocoena ) by gillnets is a recognised threat to populations. To develop effective mitigation measures, understanding the mechanics of bycatch is essential. Previous studies in experimental conditions suggested foraging activity is an important factor influencing porpoises’ reaction to gillnets. We acoustically observed the behaviour of wild harbour porpoises around a bottom-gillnet set-up in a commercial fishing ground, especially foraging activity. Passive acoustic event recorders (A-tags) were fixed to the ends of the gillnet, and recorded for 1 392 hours. Although harbour porpoises frequently and repeatedly appeared around the net each day, incidental bycatch occurred only three times during the observations. The stomach contents of two individuals contained mainly Ammodytes sp., which were observable around the bottom-gillnet but not targeted by the fishery. A total of 276 foraging incidents were acoustically detected, and 78.2% of the foraging activity was in the bottom layer (deeper than 25 m). Porpoises appeared around the net with more frequency on the day of a bycatch incident than on the days without bycatch. These results suggest that the harbour porpoises appeared around the bottom-gillnet to forage on fish distributed in the fishing ground, but not captured by this bottom-gillnet. Thus, porpoises face the risk of becoming entangled when foraging near a gillnet, with the probability of bycatch simply increasing with the length of time spent near the net. Bycatch mitigation measures are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3127440592,"To evaluate movement quality of upper limb (UL) prosthesis users, performance-based outcome measures have been developed that examine the normalcy of movement as compared to a person with a sound, intact hand. However, the broad definition of “normal movement” and the subjective nature of scoring can make it difficult to know which areas of the body to evaluate, and the expected magnitude of deviation from normative movement. To provide a more robust approach to characterizing movement differences, the goals of this work are to identify degrees of freedom (DOFs) that will inform abnormal movement for several tasks using unsupervised machine learning (clustering methods) and elucidate the variations in movement approach across two upper-limb prosthesis devices with varying DOFs as compared to healthy controls. 24 participants with no UL disability or impairment were recruited for this study and trained on the use of a body-powered bypass (n = 6) or the DEKA limb bypass (n = 6) prosthetic devices or included as normative controls. 3D motion capture data were collected from all participants as they performed the Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test (JHFT) and targeted Box and Blocks Test (tBBT). Range of Motion, peak angle, angular path length, mean angle, peak angular velocity, and number of zero crossings were calculated from joint angle data for the right/left elbows, right/left shoulders, torso, and neck and fed into a K-means clustering algorithm. Results show right shoulder and torso DOFs to be most informative in distinguishing between bypass user and norm group movement. The JHFT page turning task and the seated tBBT elicit movements from bypass users that are most distinctive from the norm group. Results can be used to inform the development of movement quality scoring methodology for UL performance-based outcome measures. Identifying tasks across two different devices with known variations in movement can inform the best tasks to perform in a rehabilitation setting that challenge the prosthesis user’s ability to achieve normative movement."
https://openalex.org/W3128374585,"Identifying biomarkers that are associated with different types of cancer is an important goal in the field of bioinformatics. Different researcher groups have analyzed the expression profiles of many genes and found some certain genetic patterns that can promote the improvement of targeted therapies, but the significance of some genes is still ambiguous. More reliable and effective biomarkers identification methods are then needed to detect candidate cancer-related genes. In this paper, we proposed a novel method that combines the infinite latent feature selection (ILFS) method with the functional interaction (FIs) network to rank the biomarkers. We applied the proposed method to the expression data of five cancer types. The experiments indicated that our network-constrained ILFS (NCILFS) provides an improved prediction of the diagnosis of the samples and locates many more known oncogenes than the original ILFS and some other existing methods. We also performed functional enrichment analysis by inspecting the over-represented gene ontology (GO) biological process (BP) terms and applying the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) method on selected biomarkers for each feature selection method. The enrichments analysis reports show that our network-constraint ILFS can produce more biologically significant gene sets than other methods. The results suggest that network-constrained ILFS can identify cancer-related genes with a higher discriminative power and biological significance."

Methods Participants were patients who survived after 30 days from succumbing a first ever stroke admitted at the Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences Academic Medical Center. Stroke survivors or their next of kin were contacted at one year after succumbing a first stroke to determine the outcomes. We assessed participants’ vital status and level of disability using the modified Rankin scale. Assessment on utilization of stroke secondary preventive measures among survivors was done by an interviewer-based questionnaire that assessed the number of times participants attended follow up clinics, medication refill and adherence. Participants were examined for waist-hip ratio, body mass index and blood pressure. Cholesterol levels were assessed at one year post first stroke for survivors. Outcomes were summarized as proportions, survival at one year was estimated by using the Kaplan Meier analysis and Cox regression analysis was performed to determine for predictors of mortality. Results We recruited 130 first stroke survivors. Mortality within one year was 53/130 (40.8%) and disability rate measured by Modified Rankin Scale with scores of 3–5 was 29/77 (37.7%) among survivors. Factors associated with mortality were residual disability HR = 8.60, {95% CI (1.16–63.96)}, severe stroke, HR = 2.67 {95% CI (1.44–4.95)} and residing in Dar-es-Salaam HR = 2.15 {95% (CI 1.06–4.36)}. Non-adherence rates to antihypertensives, antiplatelets and statins was 11/73 (15.1%), 9/23 (39.1%) and 18/22 (81.8%) respectively. Attendance rates of follow-up clinics among all survivors and physiotherapy among survivors with disability are 45/77 (58.4%) and 16/29 (55.2%) respectively. Conclusions The mortality and disability rates within a year following a first ever stroke among 30 days stroke survivors is high. Secondary stroke preventive measures should be enhanced to mitigate stroke adverse outcomes. Community outreach programs could be useful interventions in preventing the adverse outcomes of stroke."

Cellular viability was evaluated (using the MTT test and fluorescence microscopy) after 1 h and 24 h exposure of HaCaT cells to ATC, ATC nano , ATC with epinephrine (ATC epi ), and ATC in nanocapsules with epinephrine (ATC nanoepi ). The profiles of permeation of 2% ATC and 2% ATC nano across swine esophageal epithelium were determined using Franz-type vertical diffusion cells. Analgesic efficacy was evaluated with a von Frey anesthesiometer in a postoperative pain model in rats, comparing the 2% ATC, 2% ATC nano , 2% ATC epi , and 2% ATC nanoepi formulations to 4% ATC epi (a commercially available formulation). We show that use of the nanocapsules decreased the toxicity of articaine ( P &lt;0.0001) and increased its flux ( P = 0.0007). The 2% ATC epi and 4% ATC epi formulations provided higher analgesia success and duration ( P &lt;0.05), compared to 2% ATC, 2% ATC nano , and 2% ATC nanoepi . Articaine-loaded poly(ɛ-caprolactone) nanocapsules constitute a promising formulation for intraoral topical anesthesia (prior to local anesthetic injection), although it is not effective when injected in inflamed tissues for pain control, such as irreversible pulpitis."
https://openalex.org/W3127531367,"Undernutrition is a major contributor to the global-burden of disease, and global-level health impact models suggest that climate change-mediated reductions in food quantity and quality will negatively affect it. These models, however, capture just some of the processes that will shape future nutrition. We adopt an alternative standpoint, developing an agent-based model in which producer-consumer smallholders practice different ‘styles of farming’ in the global food system. The model represents a hypothetical rural community in which ‘orphan’ (subsistence) farmers may develop by adopting an ‘entrepreneurial’ style (highly market-dependent) or by maintaining a ‘peasant’ style (agroecology). We take a first look at the question: how might patterns of farming styles—under various style preference, climate, policy, and price transmission scenarios—impact on hunger and health-supporting conditions (incomes, work, inequality, ‘real land productivity’) in rural areas? imulations without climate change or agricultural policy found that style preference patterns influence production, food price, and incomes, and there were trade-offs between them. For instance, entrepreneurial-oriented futures had the highest production and lowest prices but were simultaneously those in which farms tended towards crisis. Simulations with climate change and agricultural policy found that peasant-orientated agroecology futures had the highest production, prices equal to or lower than those under entrepreneurial-oriented futures, and better supported rural health. There were, however, contradictory effects on nutrition, with benefits and harms for different groups. Collectively the findings suggest that when attempting to understand how climate change may impact on future nutrition and health, patterns of farming styles—along with the fates of the households that practice them—matter. These issues, including the potential role of peasant farming, have been neglected in previous global-level climate-nutrition modelling but go to the heart of current debates on the future of farming: thus, they should be given more prominence in future work."
https://openalex.org/W3128010030,"Influenza A virus (IAV) is one of the most important respiratory viruses affecting pig health and vaccination is the most common strategy to control influenza infections. In this field study we assessed the onset and duration of shedding of a live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) vaccine, its ability to transmit to non-vaccinated pigs and whether the LAIV could be aerosolized and detected in the environment. Thirty-three litters (n = 33) of a farm using the LAIV vaccine were selected for the study, a subset of them (n = 12) were left unvaccinated and a subset of piglets (n = 3) in vaccinated litters were also left unvaccinated to serve as sentinels. Selected piglets from the litters were sampled multiple days post vaccination (DPV) by collecting nasal swabs and blood, and were tested using a LAIV vaccine specific RT-PCR assay and hemagglutination inhibition assay against the LAIV strains respectively. Environmental specimens consisting of air and surface wipes were also collected. One hundred percent (21/21) of the vaccinated litters tested LAIV positive 1 DPV and until 6 DPV. In contrast, only five (5/33) of the thirty-three non-vaccinated pigs tested positive during the course of the study. Viable LAIV was confirmed in vaccinated pigs by cell culture and whole genome sequencing. In addition, low levels of LAIV RNA (RT-PCR Ct values ranging between 33 and 38) were detected in all air specimens collected on the day of vaccination and until 6 DPV (3/10). Pigs had maternally derived antibodies reactive against the LAIV strains which may have influenced the degree of shedding observed. Under the conditions of this study, shedding of the LAIV from vaccinated pigs was limited in time, resulted in minimal transmission to non-vaccinated pigs and was detected in low levels in aerosols collected in the vaccinated rooms likely influenced by the presence of maternally derived antibodies against the LAIV strains."
https://openalex.org/W3128121522,"Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) (gene symbol ABCC1 ) is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter which effluxes xeno- and endobiotic organic anions including estradiol glucuronide and the pro-inflammatory leukotriene C 4 . MRP1 also confers multidrug resistance by reducing intracellular drug accumulation through active efflux. MRP1 has three membrane spanning domains (MSD), and two nucleotide binding domains (NBD). MSD1 and MSD2 are linked to NBD1 and NBD2 by connecting regions (CR) 1 and CR2, respectively. Here we targeted four residues in CR1 (Ser 612 , Arg 615 , His 622 , Glu 624 ) for alanine substitution and unexpectedly, found that cellular levels of three mutants (S612A, R615A, E624A) in transfected HEK cells were substantially lower than wild-type MRP1. Whereas CR1-H622A properly trafficked to the plasma membrane and exhibited organic anion transport activity comparable to wild-type MRP1, the poorly expressing R615A and E624A (and to a lesser extent S612A) mutant proteins were retained intracellularly. Analyses of cryogenic electron microscopic and atomic homology models of MRP1 indicated that Arg 615 and Glu 624 might participate in bonding interactions with nearby residues to stabilize expression of the transporter. However, this was not supported by double exchange mutations E624K/K406E, R615D/D430R and R615F/F619R which failed to improve MRP1 levels. Nevertheless, these experiments revealed that the highly conserved CR1-Phe 619 and distal Lys 406 in the first cytoplasmic loop of MSD1 are also essential for expression of MRP1 protein. This study is the first to demonstrate that CR1 contains several highly conserved residues critical for plasma membrane expression of MRP1 but thus far, currently available structures and models do not provide any insights into the underlying mechanism(s). Additional structures with rigorous biochemical validation data are needed to fully understand the bonding interactions critical to stable expression of this clinically important ABC transporter."
https://openalex.org/W3126854098,"Background Neuromuscular blocking agents induce muscle paralysis via the prevention of synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction and may have additional effects at other sites of action. With regard to potential effects of neuromuscular blocking agents on the central nervous system, a definitive view has not been established. We investigated whether intravenous infusion of rocuronium bromide affects the emergence from propofol anesthesia. Methods Using an in vivo rat model, we performed propofol infusion for 60 minutes, along with rocuronium bromide at various infusion rates or normal saline. Sugammadex or normal saline was injected at the end of the infusion period, and we evaluated the time to emergence from propofol anesthesia. We also examined the neuromuscular blocking, circulatory, and respiratory properties of propofol infusion along with rocuronium bromide infusion to ascertain possible factors affecting emergence. Results Intravenous infusion of rocuronium bromide dose-dependently increased the time to emergence from propofol anesthesia. Sugammadex administered after propofol infusion not containing rocuronium bromide did not affect the time to emergence. Mean arterial pressure, heart rate, partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide, and pH were not affected by rocuronium bromide infusion. Neuromuscular blockade induced by rocuronium bromide, even at the greatest infusion rate in the emergence experiment, was rapidly antagonized by sugammadex. Conclusions These results suggest that intravenous infusion of rocuronium bromide dose-dependently delays the emergence from propofol anesthesia in rats. Future studies, such as detection of rocuronium in the cerebrospinal fluid or central nervous system, electrophysiologic studies, microinjection of sugammadex into the brain, etc., are necessary to determine the mechanism of this effect."
https://openalex.org/W3127118243,"Background Data is lacking on outcomes among COPD patients in sub-Saharan Africa. The objective of the study was to assess the incidence and predictors of mortality among COPD patients enrolled in the Uganda Registry for Asthma and COPD. Research question What is the Incidence and predictors of mortality among COPD patients in Uganda? Study design and methods Individuals with a diagnosis of COPD at six hospitals in Uganda were enrolled into the registry, and followed every six months. Mortality was ascertained through post-mortem reports and verbal autopsies. Mortality rates (MR), mortality rate ratios (MRR), and hazard ratios (HR) were computed to assess associations between socio-demographic, behavioural, and clinical characteristics at enrolment into the registry and mortality up to two years after. Results We enrolled 296 COPD patients. Median age was 60 years, and 51·3% were male. The overall mortality rate was 95·90 deaths/1000 person-years. COPD severity by post-bronchodilator FEV 1 was the strongest risk factor for mortality. Compared to stage 1, adjusted hazard ratios were as follows for stage 4: 9·86 (95%CI: 1·70–57·14, p = 0·011), stage 3: 6·16 (95%CI: 1·25–30·32, p = 0·025), and stage 2: 1·76 (95%CI: 0·33–9·48, p = 0·51). Underweight patients had a higher incidence of mortality compared to normal weight patients (MRR: 3 · 47 (95%CI: 1·45–8·31, p = 0·0026). Conclusion Among COPD patients in Uganda, two-year mortality is high, and disease severity at baseline was the strongest risk factor for mortality. Our findings suggest the need for early, accurate, diagnosis and management of COPD, to potentially improve survival."
https://openalex.org/W3128203909,"Background Patients’ life contexts are increasingly recognized as important, as evidenced by growing attention to the Social Determinants of Health (SDoH). This attention may be particularly valuable for patients with complex needs, like those with HIV, who are more likely to experience age-related comorbidities, mental health or substance use issues. Understanding patient perceptions of their life context can advance SDoH approaches. Objectives We sought to understand how aging patients with HIV think about their life context and explored if and how their reported context was documented in their electronic medical records (EMRs). Design We combined life story interviews and EMR data to understand the health-related daily life experiences of patients with HIV. Patients over 50 were recruited from two US Department of Veterans Affairs HIV clinics. Narrative analysis was used to organize data by life events and health-related metrics. Key results EMRs of 15 participants documented an average of 19 diagnoses and 10 medications but generally failed to include social contexts salient to patients. In interviews, HIV was discussed primarily in response to direct interviewer questions. Instead, participants raised past trauma, current social engagement, and concern about future health with varying salience. This led us to organize the narratives temporally according to past-, present-, or future-orientation. “Past-focused” narratives dwelled on unresolved experiences with social institutions like the school system, military or marriage. “Present-focused” narratives emphasized daily life challenges, like social isolation. “Future-focused” narratives were dominated by concerns that aging would limit activities. Conclusions A temporally informed understanding of patients’ life circumstances that are the foundation of their individualized SDoH could better focus care plans by addressing contextual concerns salient to patients. Trust-building may be a critical first step in caring for past-focused patients. Present-focused patients may benefit from support groups. Future-focused patients may desire discussing long term care options."
https://openalex.org/W3128997221,"With data collected from a directed social trading network, this paper investigates how social interaction affects the disposition effect. We constantly observe a negative association between them: After being exposed to social interaction, a trader’s odds ratio to sell a paper gain stock decreases by 9% to 10%, depending on different model settings. We then test the mechanisms of social interaction by decomposing it into three channels: learning intensity (willingness to learn), learning quality (information advantage through learning), and public scrutinization (exposure of trading outcome to others). We find that all three channels contribute to a smaller disposition effect. Specifically, our findings support the claim that public scrutinization promotes self-consciousness and reduces disposition effect. Also, our results extend previous studies on investors’ information advantage by suggesting that it could also help to mitigate the disposition effect through the reduction of uncertainty. Overall, this paper suggests a positive role of social trading platforms in helping investors make better decisions."
https://openalex.org/W3127107187,"The paper deals with the analysis of spatial distribution of Swiss population using fractal concepts and unsupervised learning algorithms. The research methodology is based on the development of a high dimensional feature space by calculating local growth curves, widely used in fractal dimension estimation and on the application of clustering algorithms in order to reveal the patterns of spatial population distribution. The notion “unsupervised” also means, that only some general criteria—density, dimensionality, homogeneity, are used to construct an input feature space, without adding any supervised/expert knowledge. The approach is very powerful and provides a comprehensive local information about density and homogeneity/fractality of spatially distributed point patterns."
https://openalex.org/W3127968928,"Background and study aims Hip arthroscopy using an orthopaedic traction table has been associated with traction-related neurovascular complications. Since the use of a hip-specific distractor for performing hip arthroscopy hasn’t been associated with those specific complications we hypothesized that a hip-specific distractor might facilitate the learning curve of hip arthroscopy for beginner surgeons. Material and methods We reviewed retrospectively the first 56 hip arthroscopies performed to treat femoro-acetabular impingement using a hip-specific distractor. We tried to analyse the learning curve of this procedure using operative time, peri- and postoperative complications, hospital stay and patient satisfaction. We also evaluated pre- and postoperative sports activities and tried to identify some factors as poor postoperative prognostic factors. Results Only 1 major complication occurred. No traction-related complications have been encountered. The curves analysing intervention time and postoperative satisfaction rate showed improvement after 30 cases performed. In all cases, we were able to perform the whole planned gesture without difficulties accessing the hip joint. Conclusion The hip-specific distractor is a safe and reproducible method in performing hip arthroscopy without any traction-related complications or time limits."
https://openalex.org/W3128866936,"Arrhythmia mechanisms in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy remain uncertain. Preclinical models suggest hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-linked mutations perturb sarcomere length-dependent activation, alter cardiac repolarization in rate-dependent fashion and potentiate triggered electrical activity. This study was designed to assess rate-dependence of clinical surrogates of contractility and repolarization in humans with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.All participants had a cardiac implantable device capable of atrial pacing. Cases had clinical diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, controls were age-matched. Continuous electrocardiogram and blood pressure were recorded during and immediately after 30 second pacing trains delivered at increasing rates.Nine hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients and 10 controls were enrolled (47% female, median 55 years), with similar baseline QRS duration, QT interval and blood pressure. Median septal thickness in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients was 18mm; 33% of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients had peak sub-aortic velocity >50mmHg. Ventricular ectopy occurred during or immediately after pacing trains in 4/9 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients and 0/10 controls (P = 0.03). During delivery of steady rate pacing across a range of cycle lengths, the QT-RR relationship was not statistically different between HCM and control groups; no differences were seen in subgroup analysis of patients with or without intact AV node conduction. Similarly, there was no difference between groups in the QT interval of the first post-pause recovery beat after pacing trains. No statistically significant differences were seen in surrogate measures for cardiac contractility.Rapid pacing trains triggered ventricular ectopy in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients, but not controls. This finding aligns with pre-clinical descriptions of excessive cardiomyocyte calcium loading during rapid pacing, increased post-pause sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release, and subsequent calcium-triggered activity. Normal contractility at all diastolic intervals argues against clinical significance of altered length-dependent myofilament activation."
