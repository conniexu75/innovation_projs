https://openalex.org/W1966099909,"An accelerated rate of glucose transport is among the most characteristic biochemical markers of cellular transformation. To study the molecular mechanism by which transporter activity is altered, cultured rodent fibroblasts transfected with activated myc, ras, or src oncogenes were used. In myc-transfected cells, the rate of 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake was unchanged. However, in cells transfected with activated ras and src oncogenes, the rate of glucose uptake was markedly increased. The increased transport rate in ras- and src-transfected cells was paralleled by a marked increase in the amount of glucose transporter protein, as assessed by immunoblots, as well as by a markedly increased abundance of glucose transporter messenger RNA. Exposure of control cells to the tumor-promoting phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) for 18 hours had a similar effect of increasing the rate of glucose transport and the abundance of transporter messenger RNA. For ras, src, and TPA, the predominant mechanism responsible for activation of the transport system is increased expression of the structural gene encoding the glucose transport protein."
https://openalex.org/W2020537787,"pp60c-src is phosphorylated in vivo at tyrosine 527, a residue not present in pp60v-src (its transforming homolog), and not at tyrosine 416, its site of in vitro autophosphorylation. To test the hypothesis that tyrosine phosphorylation regulates pp60c-src biological activity, we constructed and studied pp60c-src mutants in which Tyr 527 and Tyr 416 were separately or coordinately altered to phenylalanine. Tyr----Phe 527 mutation strongly activated pp60c-src transforming and kinase activities, whereas the additional introduction of a Tyr----Phe 416 mutation suppressed these activities. Tyr----Phe 416 mutation of normal pp60c-src eliminated its partial transforming activity, which suggests that transient or otherwise restricted phosphorylation of Tyr 416 is important for pp60c-src function even though stable phosphorylation is not observed in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1534702626,"Modification of low density lipoproteins (LDL) by oxidation has been shown to permit recognition by the acetyl-LDL receptor of macrophages. The extensive oxidation of LDL that is required before interaction occurs with this receptor produces major alterations in both the lipid and protein components of LDL. Several chemical modifications of LDL also lead to recognition by this receptor; all of these involve derivatization of lysine residues of apolipoprotein B by adducts that neutralize the positively charged epsilon-amino group. The present studies show that oxidation also results in derivatization of LDL lysine residues. Analysis of amino acid composition indicated that 32% of lysine residues were modified after oxidation of LDL by exposure to 5 microM CuSO4 for 20 h. About one-half of the derivatized lysines were labile under the conditions of acid hydrolysis. Fluorescence of LDL protein was greatly increased by oxidation, with excitation maximum at 350 nm and emission maximum at 433 nm. When LDL containing phosphatidylcholine with isotopically labeled arachidonic acid in the sn-2 position was oxidized, there was a 5-fold increase in radioactivity bound to protein compared to nonoxidized LDL or oxidized LDL labeled with 2-[1-14C]palmitoyl phosphatidylcholine. Prior methylation of LDL prevented the rapid uptake and degradation by macrophages that normally accompanies oxidation. These findings suggest that oxidation of LDL is accompanied by derivatization of lysine epsilon-amino groups by lipid products and that these adducts may be important in the interaction of oxidized LDL with the acetyl-LDL receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1974517994,"To investigate the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation in the regulation of pp60c-src, we have substituted phenylalanine for tyrosine at positions 416, 519, and 527. Cells expressing the 527 or the 519/527 mutant but not the 416 or the 519 mutant were morphologically transformed, grew in soft agar, and formed foci. In addition, the 527 and 519/527 mutants had elevated kinase activities in vitro. Modifying Tyr 416 to phenylalanine in the 527 or the 519/527 mutants only partially inhibited their kinase activities yet abolished their ability to induce focus formation and promote growth in soft agar. These results suggest that two events must occur to activate the full transforming potential of pp60c-src: hypophosphorylation at Tyr 527 and hyperphosphorylation at Tyr 416."

https://openalex.org/W1972116779,"A DNA cross-link adduct of the antitumor agent mitomycin C (MC) to DNA has been isolated and characterized; the results provide direct proof for bifunctional alkylation of DNA by MC. Exposure of MC to Micrococcus luteus DNA under reductive conditions and subsequent nuclease digestion yielded adducts formed between MC and deoxyguanosine residues. In addition to the two known monoadducts, a bisadduct was obtained. Reductive MC activation with Na2S2O4 (sodium dithionite) leads to exclusive bifunctional alkylation. The structure of the bisadduct was determined by spectroscopic methods that included proton magnetic resonance, differential Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and circular dichroism. Formation of the same bisadduct in vivo was demonstrated upon injection of rats with MC. Computer-generated models of the bisadduct that was incorporated into the center of the duplex B-DNA decamer d(CGTACGTACG)2 indicated that the bisadduct fit snugly into the minor groove with minimal distortion of DNA structure. A mechanistic analysis of the factors that govern monofunctional and bifunctional adduct formation is presented."
https://openalex.org/W2157342751,"We introduced two mutations into the carboxy-terminal regulatory region of chicken pp60c-src. One, F527, replaces tyrosine 527 with phenylalanine. The other, Am517, produces a truncated pp60c-src protein lacking the 17 carboxy-terminal amino acids. Both mutant proteins were phosphorylated at tyrosine 416 in vivo. The specific activity of the Am517 mutant protein kinase was similar to that of wild-type pp60c-src whereas that of the F527 mutant was 5- to 10-fold higher. Both mutant c-src genes induced focus formation on NIH 3T3 cells, but the foci appeared at lower frequency, and were smaller than foci induced by polyoma middle tumor antigen (mT). The wild-type or F527 pp60c-src formed a complex with mT, whereas the Am517 pp60c-src did not. The results suggest that one, inability to phosphorylate tyrosine 527 increases pp60c-src protein kinase activity and transforming ability; two, transformation by mT involves other events besides lack of phosphorylation at tyrosine 527 of pp60c-src; three, activation of the pp60c-src protein kinase may not be required for transformation by the Am517 mutant; and four, the carboxyl terminus of pp60c-src appears to be required for association with mT."

https://openalex.org/W1583703772,"The 50-residue cytoplasmic domain of the low density lipoprotein receptor (amino acids 790-839) directs the receptor to coated pits, thereby facilitating rapid endocytosis of bound low density lipoprotein. To determine the structural features required for this targeting, we produced 24 mutations in the cytoplasmic domain through use of oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The first 22 amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain (residues 790-811) are sufficient for rapid internalization. The amino acid at position 807 is especially critical. Aromatic residues (tyrosine, phenylalanine, or tryptophan) at this position allow rapid internalization. Charged or uncharged aliphatic residues do not substitute. Although the requirements at the neighboring positions (806 and 808) are less stringent, the insertion of proline at position 806 is detrimental. These specificities suggest that the juxtamembranous region of the cytoplasmic domain participates in protein:protein interactions that allow the low density lipoprotein receptor to cluster in coated pits."
https://openalex.org/W1537291268,"Aromatase cytochrome P-450, which catalyzes the conversion of androgens to estrogens, was purified from human placental microsomes. The enzyme was extracted with sodium cholate, fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation, and subjected to column chromatography in the presence of its substrate, androstenedione, and the nonionic detergent, Nonidet P-40. The preparation exhibits a single major band when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and has a specific content of 11.5 nmol of P-450/mg of protein. The purified enzyme displays spectroscopic properties typical of the ferric and ferrous forms of cytochrome P-450. Full enzymatic activity can be reconstituted with rabbit liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 reductase and Nonidet P-40. Purified aromatase cytochrome P-450 displays catalytic characteristics similar to the enzyme in intact microsomes in the aromatization of androstenedione, 19-hydroxyandrostenedione and 19-oxoandrostenedione. Testosterone and 16 alpha-hydroxytestosterone are aromatized at maximal rates similar to androstenedione, and all substrates exhibit relative affinities corresponding to those observed in microsomes. We have raised rabbit antibodies to the purified enzyme which show considerable specificity and sensitivity on immunoblots."

https://openalex.org/W1586296071,"Many stimulators of prostaglandin production are thought to activate the Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase first described by Nishizuka and his colleagues (Takai, Y., Kishimoto, A., Iwasa, Y., Kawahara, Y., Mori, T., and Nishizuka, Y. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 3692-3695. In this paper we report evidence that the activation of protein kinase C caused by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) is involved in the increased prostaglandin production induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. We have shown that TPA activates protein kinase C in MDCK cells with similar dose response curve as observed for TPA induction of arachidonic acid release in MDCK cells. Activation of protein kinase C was associated with increased phosphorylation of proteins of 40,000 and 48,000 daltons. We used two compounds (1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine (ET-18-OMe) and 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)piperazine) known to inhibit protein kinase C by different mechanisms to further examine if activation of protein kinase C was involved in the increased synthesis of prostaglandins in TPA-treated MDCK cells. We found that both compounds inhibited protein kinase C partially purified from MDCK cells and that ET-18-OMe inhibited the phosphorylation of proteins by protein kinase C in the intact cells. Addition of either compound during or after TPA treatment decreased both release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids and prostaglandin synthesis. Release of [3H]arachidonic acid from phosphatidylethanolamine in TPA-treated cells was blocked by ET-18-OMe or 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)piperazine addition. However, arachidonic acid release stimulated by A23187 is not blocked by Et-18-OMe. When assayed in vitro, treatment of cells with Et-18-OMe did not prevent the enhanced conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins induced by pretreatment of cells with TPA. Our results suggest that the stimulation of phospholipase A2 activity by TPA occurs via activation of protein kinase C by TPA."

https://openalex.org/W2032225047,"The role of calcium in regulating the contractile state of smooth muscle has been investigated by measuring calcium and contraction in single smooth muscle cells with the calcium-sensitive dye fura-2 and the digital imaging microscope. The concentration of free calcium in the cytoplasm increased after stimulation of the cells by depolarization with high potassium or by application of carbachol. Changes in calcium always preceded contraction. The increase in calcium induced by these stimuli was limited to less than 1 microM. Calcium within the nucleus was also subject to a limitation of its rise during contraction. Intranuclear calcium rose from 200 nM at rest to no more than 300 nM while cytoplasmic calcium rose to over 700 nM. These apparent ceilings for both cytoplasmic and intranuclear calcium may result either from negative feedback of calcium on cytoplasmic and nuclear calcium channel gating mechanisms, respectively, or from the presence of calcium pumps that are strongly activated at the calcium ceilings."

https://openalex.org/W1496585919,"Rat spleen prostaglandin D synthetase (Christ-Hazelhof, E., and Nugteren, D. H. (1979) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 572, 43-51) is very similar to rat brain prostaglandin D synthetase (Urade, Y., Fujimoto, N., and Hayaishi O. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 12410-12415) as judged by their pI (4.7-5.2), Mr (26,000-27,000), and self-inactivation during the isomerase reaction from prostaglandin H2 to prostaglandin D2. However, the amino acid compositions of these two enzymes were quite different. Furthermore, the spleen enzyme was associated with the glutathione S-transferase activity, differing from the brain enzyme. The synthetase and transferase activities of the spleen enzyme showed almost identical pH and glutathione dependencies, the optimum pH = 8.0 and Km for glutathione = 300 microM. The Km values for prostaglandin H2 and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (a substrate for the transferase) were about 200 microM and 5 mM, respectively. The synthetase activity was dose-dependently inhibited by 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (IC50: approximately 5 mM) and more strongly by nonsubstrate ligands, such as bilirubin and indocyanine green (IC50: 150 and 2 microM, respectively). Both the synthetase and transferase activities of the purified enzyme dose-dependently decreased and showed identical immunotitration curves by incubation with antibody against this enzyme, but remained unchanged when treated with antibody against the brain enzyme. The antibody specific for the spleen enzyme absorbed almost all of the synthetase activity and about 10% of the transferase activity in the spleen, but not the transferase activity in the liver, heart, and testis. These results show that the two types of prostaglandin D synthetase are similar but different enzymes and that the spleen enzyme is a unique glutathione S-transferase differing from other isozymes and their subunits reported previously."
https://openalex.org/W1603388985,"Abstract Dopaminergic inhibition of prolactin release from the anterior pituitary may be mediated through both the adenylate cyclase and Ca2+ mobilization/phosphoinositide pathways. The D2-dopamine receptor of the bovine anterior pituitary has been partially purified by affinity chromatography on CMOS-Sepharose (immobilized carboxymethyleneoximinospiperone). Reinsertion of these partially purified receptor preparations into phospholipid vesicles reconstituted guanine nucleotide-sensitive high affinity agonist binding, agonist-promoted GTPase and 35S-labeled guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) [( 35S]GTP gamma S) binding activity in these preparations. Pertussis toxin treatment of the purified receptor preparation abolished agonist-stimulated GTPase and guanine nucleotide-sensitive high affinity agonist binding. These observations suggest that the receptor copurifies with an endogenous, pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide binding protein (N). [32P]ADP-ribosylation of affinity-purified D2 receptor preparations by pertussis toxin revealed the presence of a substrate of Mr 39,000-40,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Peptide maps generated using elastase of the [32P]ADP-ribosylated endogenous N protein, transducin, and Ni and No from brain revealed similarities but not identity between the endogenous pituitary N protein and brain Ni and No. Immunoblotting of the partially purified D2 receptor preparations showed an Mr 39,000-40,000 band with an Ni-specific antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide, and with RV3, an No-specific anti-serum, but not with CW6, an antiserum strongly reactive with brain Ni. Several lines of evidence indicate that endogenous pituitary N protein is functionally coupled to the D2 receptor. As measured by [35S]GTP gamma S binding, ratios of 0.2-0.6 mol N protein/mol receptor were observed. Association of N protein with the D2 receptor was increased by agonist pretreatment and decreased by guanine nucleotides. These results suggest that No and/or a form of Ni distinct from the Mr 41,000 pertussis toxin substrate (Ni) is the predominant N protein functionally coupled with the D2-dopamine receptor of anterior pituitary."

https://openalex.org/W1587695030,"The demonstration that activators of the Ca2+-activated, phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C), such as phorbol esters and diacylglycerols, can provoke luteinizing hormone (LH) release from pituitary gonadotropes, suggests a possible role for protein kinase C in stimulus-release coupling. We now report that administration of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) to pituitary cell cultures causes a sustained reduction in Triton X-100-extracted protein kinase C activity. Further, phorbol ester- and diacylglycerol-stimulated LH release, as well as inhibition by PMA of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-stimulated inositol phosphate production, were reduced by pretreatment with PMA. The effects of phorbol ester pretreatment on PMA-stimulated LH release and protein kinase C activity were dose-dependent, sustained (greater than or equal to 24 h) and specific (no measurable effect with 4 alpha-phorbol didecanoate). The effect on PMA-stimulated LH release was apparently Ca2+-independent. In pituitary cell cultures with reduced protein kinase C activity, the gonadotropes have reduced responsiveness to PMA but release a similar proportion of cellular LH in response to Ca2+-mobilizing secretagogues (GnRH and A23187) as do control cells. The normal responsiveness to GnRH of cells with reduced responsiveness to protein kinase C activators calls into question the requirement for this enzyme for GnRH-stimulated LH release."
https://openalex.org/W1573805663,"Photolyzed rhodopsin acts in a catalytic manner to mediate the exchange of GTP for GDP bound to transducin. We have analyzed the steady-state kinetics of this activation process in order to determine the molecular mechanism of interactions between rhodopsin, transducin, and guanine nucleotides. Initial velocities (Vo) of the exchange reaction catalyzed by rhodopsin were measured for various transducin concentrations at several fixed levels of the GTP analog, [35S]guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S). The initial rate data analysis rigorously demonstrates that rhodopsin mediates the activation of transducin by a double-displacement catalytic mechanism. The Michaelis-Menten curves determined as a function of [transducin] reveal remarkable allosteric behavior; analysis of this data yields a Hill coefficient of 2. Lineweaver-Burk plots of Vo-1 versus [transducin]-1 display curvilinearity indicative of positive cooperativity and a series of parallel lines are generated by plotting Vo-1 as a function of [transducin]-2. The plots of Vo-1 versus [GTP gamma S]-1 show no evidence of allosterism and are a parallel series. Furthermore, the allosteric behavior observed in the activation of transducin is also witnessed in the rhodopsin-catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange of the G protein's purified alpha subunit in the absence of the beta X gamma subunit complex. The latter observation implies that the molecular basis for allosterism in the activation process resides in the interactions between the photoreceptor and transducin's alpha subunit."

https://openalex.org/W1968655990,"Mouse nuclear factors that bind to an upstream metal regulatory element of the mouse metallothionein-I gene have been identified by DNA footprinting and oligonucleotide band shift assays. The formation of complexes at this site can be activated 20- to 40-fold by the vitro addition of ionic cadmium. The activation reaction is rapid, reversible by a metal chelator, and may involve multiple proteins. These results suggest that the initial step in cadmium detoxification is an interaction between the metal and nuclear DNA-binding factors leading to an increase in metallothionein gene transcription. The ability to observe metal activation in vitro makes this a powerful system to study the biochemistry of eukaryotic gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1586780384,"Abstract The guanine nucleotide-binding proteins which mediate hormonal inhibition of adenylate cyclase as well as hormonal regulation of other membrane functions are alpha, beta, and gamma heterotrimers which are structurally homologous to each other. In brain, the predominant guanine nucleotide-binding component is a 39-kDa protein whose physiological role is as yet unknown. We have used N-ethylmaleimide to define functionally important sulfhydryl groups on alpha 39. Three cysteine residues in the molecule are reactive in unliganded alpha 39. Alkylation of two of these is reduced when guanosine 5'-(3'-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) is bound. We have isolated and sequenced tryptic peptides containing the three reactive cysteines. The octapeptide containing the GTP gamma S-insensitive cysteine is at a position equivalent to amino acids 106-113 of the transducin alpha subunit (Lochrie, M. A., Hurley, J. B., and Simon, M. I. (1985) Science 228, 96-99). However, the equivalent peptide in transducin does not contain a cysteine residue. Alkylation of this cysteine blocks ADP-ribosylation of cysteine 351 by pertussis toxin. However, alkylation does not prevent association of alpha with the beta X gamma subunits nor does it inhibit GTPase activity. The two GTP gamma S-sensitive cysteines are at positions equivalent to cysteines 139 and 286 of the transducin alpha subunit. Alkylation of these residues inhibits GTPase activity. Neither of these GTP gamma S-sensitive cysteines are in those regions of alpha 39 which are highly homologous to the GTP-binding site of elongation factor Tu (Jurnak, F. (1985) Science 230, 32-36). However, both are present in the brain 41-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding protein and in the two transducins. The conservation of these cysteine residues suggests that they are important for the function of the subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1482750006,"Placental extracts contain inhibitors of human urinary urokinase. These extracts form a heterogeneous population of complexes with 125I-urokinase that are recognizable by changes in gel filtration profile and mobility during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Treatment with reducing agents eliminated the size heterogeneity without loss of activity, thereby allowing the placental inhibitor to be purified. Active inhibitor has been isolated in apparently homogeneous form after an eight-step procedure that included salt extraction, ammonium sulfate fractionation, column chromatography on CM-cellulose, DEAE-Sepharose, and hydroxylapatite, chromatofocusing, preparative gel electrophoresis, and hydrophobic chromatography. The purified inhibitor has Mr = 47,000. The inhibitor is relatively specific for plasminogen activators since it does not inhibit the action of plasmin, factor XIIa, plasma kallikrein, or thrombin. The inhibitor forms complexes with 1:1 stoichiometry that block the active sites of urokinase (but not prourokinase) and both one- and two-chain forms of tissue plasminogen activator. The stability of these complexes in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis suggest that they are based on covalently bonded structures. Although both types of plasminogen activator are inhibited, the rate of interaction is significantly faster with urokinase, tissue plasminogen activator being inhibited less efficiently. The complexes formed can be dissociated by mild alkali or hydroxylamine, thereby regenerating both enzymes and inhibitor at their original molecular weights. The results suggest that the complexes are stabilized by ester-like bonds; these might involve the hydroxyl of serine at the active site of the proteases and a carboxyl group in the inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1563205636,"The link between the biochemical and morphological differentiation of granulosa cells was studied by investigating the organization and the expression of cytoskeletal proteins which determine cell shape and contacts. In cells treated with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), in a serum- and growth factor-free medium, or with other compounds which elevate cellular cAMP levels, the synthesis of the adherens junction proteins, vinculin, alpha-actinin, and actin was reduced significantly when compared to unstimulated cells (7-fold for vinculin, 5-fold for alpha-actinin, and 3-fold for actin). The in vitro translatability of the mRNAs coding for these proteins and the level of actin mRNA determined by RNA blot hybridization were generally reduced in differentiating cells. The synthesis and the organization of vimentin and tubulin was unaffected during this process, whereas the organization of actin and vinculin was dramatically affected, with FSH-treated cells displaying a diffuse pattern of actin and vinculin, with very little vinculin in adhesion plaques. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist and the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate which are known to antagonize the cAMP-mediated biochemical differentiation of granulosa cells by reducing cAMP levels or by activating protein kinase C and phospholipid turnover, blocked to a large extent the FSH-induced effect on the adherens junction proteins. Epidermal growth factor, which blocked the FSH-induced cAMP increase, but not the FSH-induced progesterone production, failed to block the synthesis of vinculin, alpha-actinin, and actin. Cytochalasin B could induce steroidogenesis and similar changes in the synthesis of these cytoskeletal proteins, whereas fibronectin, which causes cell spreading, blocked in part the FSH-induced effect on the expression of cytoskeletal proteins. The modulation of cytoskeletal proteins may therefore be an essential feature of programmed differentiation events leading to the final phenotype of granulosa cells."
https://openalex.org/W1572826595,"The PC-1 protein is a membrane glycoprotein that is selectively expressed on the surface of antibody-secreting cells. Previous work has shown that it consists of two apparently identical disulfide-bonded polypeptides, each of molecular weight approximately 120,000. We now describe the sequence of PC-1 mRNA and protein. The PC-1 protein is shown to consist of 905 amino acids and to have an uncommon transmembrane orientation. The NH2-terminal 58 residues are intracellular and the COOH-terminal 826 residues are extracellular. A cysteine-rich region of 85 amino acids lies adjacent to the extracellular surface of the membrane and appears to have arisen by exon duplication. In common with other membrane glycoproteins with this orientation, there is no obvious signal sequence other than the transmembrane segment. The PC-1 protein therefore has an overall structure and membrane orientation that resembles those of the transferrin receptor, the asialoglycoprotein receptor, and the Ia invariant chain."

Evidence for the glycosylation of the first heavy chain hypervariable region of this protein was found. The inability of the deglycosylated Fab fragment of Ger to inhibit cryoprecipitation provides direct evidence that the presence of an additional sialic acid residue in a heavy chain's first hypervariable region can account for the cryo properties of this protein. This is the first convincing description of a molecular defect that explains the atypical low temperature solubility of a monoclonal cryoimmunoglobulin.

The enzymatic reaction rates for both series of complexes were determined as a function of temperature, particle concentration, neutral salt concentration, and the type of anion present in solution. The kinetic results support the hypothesis that phospholipids, in discoidal complexes, modulate the reaction rates by molecular effects at the active site, but also by interfacial effects on the interaction of the enzyme with the particles. The relevant interfacial parameters are the lipid packing at the interface and the structure of apolipoprotein A-I."

To better understand the regulation of hepatic lipase, we investigated the synthesis, post-translational processing, and secretion of the enzyme by isolated rat hepatocytes. Metabolically labeled [35S]methionine hepatic lipase protein, produced by the collagenase-dispersed hepatocytes, was immunoisolated from detergent-solubilized cells and incubation medium at designated times, using a polyclonal rabbit anti-rat hepatic lipase antibody raised against hepatic lipase purified to homogeneity from rat liver post-heparin perfusates. Following polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography, radiolabeled hepatic lipase was quantitated by densitometry. Newly synthesized hepatic lipase was rapidly secreted and accumulated in the medium as a 59,000-dalton protein in a manner consistent with a constitutive process. An intracellular 53,000-dalton precursor of the mature 59,000-dalton hepatic lipase was identified by immunoprecipitation. The 53,000-dalton form could also be generated by endoglycosidase digestion of the secreted 59,000-dalton protein. In pulse-chase experiments, the 53,000-dalton protein was converted into the 59,000-dalton form. A 47,000-dalton form of hepatic lipase was immunoisolated from cell lysates only after tunicamycin treatment and could be generated from the secreted 59,000-dalton enzyme by prolonged endoglycosidase digestion. These data show that hepatic lipase is synthesized and rapidly secreted by isolated rat hepatocytes. Further, an intracellular 47,000-dalton precursor peptide can be identified after tunicamycin treatment, which may represent the hepatic lipase polypeptide, presumably after removal of its signal sequence; a 53,000-dalton partially glycosylated peptide exists as a major precursor form in the cell; and the mature 59,000-dalton hepatic lipase is present in the hepatocyte, but it is rapidly secreted."
https://openalex.org/W1591293132,"The hypoglycemic sulfonylureas glyburide and tolbutamide were found to be excellent inhibitors of the rat liver, heart, and skeletal muscle carnitine palmitoyltransferases, but glyburide was by far the most potent inhibitor. Carboxytolbutamide, a sulfonylurea that has no hypoglycemic effect, produced little or no inhibition of the enzyme from the three tissues examined. Fasting decreased the degree of inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase by the sulfonylureas, and in genetically diabetic BB Wistar rats, a decrease in sensitivity was also clearly demonstrated. Initial rate kinetics of the inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase indicated that glyburide inhibits noncompetitively with respect to palmitoyl-CoA while inhibition by malonyl-CoA was cooperatively competitive. Inhibition by malonyl-CoA was noncompetitive with respect to carnitine, but inhibition by glyburide was uncompetitive. These studies indicate that the hypoglycemic sulfonylureas inhibit carnitine palmitoyltransferase by a mechanism that is much different from inhibition by malonyl-CoA, but are, nevertheless, potent inhibitors of the enzyme. These results have important implications for energy metabolism in the liver and heart in relation to the use of sulfonylureas and for understanding the mechanism by which the sulfonylureas act to lower blood glucose, but there are also important implications of these results on the study of the metabolic regulation of fatty acid oxidation."

Hypothyroid mouse hemipituitaries were incubated in medium containing [3H] mannose, [3H]glucosamine, or [3H]fucose either with or without 10(-7) M TRH. TSH was immunoprecipitated, proteolytically digested into glycopeptides, and chromatographed on serial lectin-Sepharose columns. Under basal conditions, 37% of secreted [3H]mannose-labeled TSH glycopeptides failed to bind to concanavalin A (ConA)-Sepharose, 55% bound and eluted with 10 mM alpha-methylglucoside, and 8% bound and eluted with 500 mM alpha-methylmannoside. Approximately 35% of glycopeptides not binding to ConA-Sepharose were bound by pea lectin-Sepharose, suggesting the presence of certain core fucosylated triantennary complex oligosaccharides. TRH caused a 2-fold increase in secretion of [3H]mannose-labeled TSH glycopeptides due almost exclusively to a specific increase in structures that bound to ConA-Sepharose and eluted with 10mM alpha-methylglucoside, corresponding to biantennary complex or unusual hybrid species. There was no change in the distribution of intrapituitary TSH glycopeptides with TRH. Acid hydrolysis of secreted proteins showed little metabolism of the tritiated sugar precursors, except for a 20% conversion of [3H]mannose to [3H]fucose. Moreover, ConA-Sepharose chromatography of secreted [3H]glucosamine- and [3H]fucose-labeled TSH glycopeptides showed similar increases in ConA-Sepharose binding with TRH as noted with [3H]mannose labeling. Subsequent lectin analysis of secreted [3H] mannose-labeled TSH glycopeptides on erythroagglutinating phytohemagglutinin-Sepharose and leukoagglutinating phytohemagglutinin-Sepharose disclosed no significant differences in TRH-treated versus control samples. These data suggest that secreted mouse TSH has greater carbohydrate heterogeneity than has been recognized previously. In addition, TRH in vitro promotes the secretion of specific TSH molecules apparently enriched in biantennary complex or unusual hybrid oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W1602260890,"We produced human apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The CHO cells were transfected with an expression plasmid which placed the human apoA-I gene under the direction of the human metallothionein II gene promoter. Isolation of a clonal cell line resulted in high level expression of apoA-I. Greater than 30% of total protein secreted by these CHO cells was apoA-I, which enabled us to purify apoA-I with a single step purification scheme. As a result, large quantities of apoA-I can be produced and isolated without having to rely on plasma sources. Structural characterization of the recombinant apoA-I showed it to be identical to authentic apoA-I from human serum high density lipoprotein. Furthermore, we demonstrated approximately equal to 90% of the apoA-I secreted by CHO cells is processed, mature protein. A portion of the secreted recombinant apoA-I was associated with lipid and floated at a density approximately equal to 1.10 g/ml. Additional analysis identified the presence of five isoforms of apoA-I in the CHO cell conditioned medium. Processing and post-translational modification of the recombinant apoA-I occurred in the CHO cell cultures in the absence of serum components. We conclude that the human apoA-I produced by CHO cells is identical to circulating, mature apoA-I in humans and that recombinant mammalian expression offers an opportunity to investigate apoA-I processing."
https://openalex.org/W1558504618,"In adrenal glomerulosa cells, angiotensin II causes an immediate release of calcium from an intracellular trigger pool (Kojima, I., Kojima, K., and Rasmussen, H. (1985) Am. J. Physiol. 247, E36-E43). The present study was conducted to determine how the trigger pool of calcium is restored after cessation of the agonist action. Upon termination of angiotensin II action, calcium influx rate decreased immediately while total cell calcium increased rapidly. The increase in total cell calcium is not affected by 1 microM nitrendipine, which blocks angiotensin II-stimulated calcium influx without inhibiting basal influx of calcium. In contrast, total cell calcium did not increase in medium containing 1 microM calcium, in which basal calcium influx is negligible. A rapid increase in total cell calcium after an addition of the antagonist was not accompanied by changes in cytoplasmic free calcium concentration. A second stimulation of cells with either angiotensin II or carbachol did not cause calcium release when the interval of two stimulations was shorter than 20 min. The longer the interval, the greater the magnitude of calcium release in response to the second stimulator. The maximum response was obtained when the interval was 40 min or more. When exogenous arachidonic acid, which mobilized calcium by acting directly on the inositol trisphosphate-sensitive pool, was employed as a second stimulator, the magnitude of the decrease in total cell calcium was also dependent on the interval. These results suggest that, upon termination of angiotensin II action, calcium is rapidly accumulated first in an intracellular pool which is insensitive to either inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate or arachidonic acid and that the trigger pool is restored gradually thereafter."

https://openalex.org/W1583109953,"Proteoglycan synthesis in nonmineralizing osteoblast cultures was investigated. Cultures were labeled with [35S]sulfate or [3H]serine, and proteoglycans were extracted from medium and cell layer with 4 M guanidine HCl. Labeled material was subjected to Sepharose CL-4B and DEAE-Sephacel chromatography and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The size and composition of the glycosaminoglycan chains and the protein core size were determined. Two proteoglycan populations were isolated by Sepharose CL-4B chromatography: a minor excluded species with chondroitin sulfate chains of apparent Mr 25,000 and a smaller population (Kav = 0.43) accounting for 80% of the total labeled material. This small population resolved into two species by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Both species contain dermatan sulfate chains of apparent Mr 40,000 and a core protein with Mr 45,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels. With the exception of their glycosaminoglycan composition these species appear similar to those extracted from bone. In addition, high molecular weight hyaluronic acid and glycosaminoglycan peptides were found in cell extracts."
https://openalex.org/W1507088915,"Abstract Alanine dehydrogenase from Bacillus cereus, a non-allosteric enzyme composed of six identical subunits, was purified to homogeneity by chromatography on blue-Sepharose and Sepharose 6B-CL. Like other pyridine-linked dehydrogenases, alanine dehydrogenase is inhibited by Cibacron blue, competitively with respect to NADH and noncompetitively with respect to pyruvate. The enzyme was inactivated by 0.1 M glycine/HCl (pH 2) and reactivated by 0.1 M phosphate (pH 8) supplemented with NAD+ or NADH. The reactivation was characterized by sigmoidal kinetics indicating a complex mechanism involving rate-limiting folding and association steps. Cibacron blue interfered with renaturation, presumably by competition with NADH. Chromatography on Sepharose 6B-CL of the partially renatured alanine dehydrogenase led to the separation of several intermediates, but only the hexamer was characterized by enzymatic activity. By immobilization on Sepharose 4B, alanine dehydrogenase from B. cereus retained 66% of the specific activity of the soluble enzyme. After denaturation of immobilized alanine dehydrogenase with 7 M urea, 37% of the initial protein was still bound to Sepharose, indicating that on the average the hexamer was attached to the matrix via, at most, two subunits. The ability of the denatured, immobilized subunits to pick up subunits from solution shows their capacity to fold back to the native conformation after urea treatment. The formation of hybrids between subunits of enzyme from B. cereus and Bacillus subtilis demonstrates the close resemblance of the tertiary and quaternary structures of alanine dehydrogenases from these species."
https://openalex.org/W1563145061,"The effects of human recombinant tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in damage of liposome membranes were examined to elucidate the molecular mechanism of their antiproliferative actions on tumor cells. The extent of membrane damage was assayed by measuring the rate of release of the fluorescent dye calcein encapsulated in the liposomes at different pH values in the presence of TNF and/or IFN-gamma. At pH values below about 5, TNF bound to phospholipid liposomes composed of mixtures of phosphatidyl-serine and phosphatidylcholine in molar ratios of 2:1 and 1:2 and caused rapid release of calcein. In contrast, IFN-gamma induced very slow leakage of dye although it bound almost completely to the membranes, suggesting that it causes much less membrane damage than TNF. Small amounts of these two antitumor factors bound to phosphatidylcholine liposomes in the pH range of 4-7, inducing relatively slow leakage of calcein. In the presence of both TNF and IFN-gamma at pH 5, the maximal leakage rate was twice the sum of the rates with the two proteins individually, and the rate depended on the TNF/IFN-gamma ratio, indicating synergistic effects of TNF and IFN-gamma in induction of membrane damage. These different and synergistic actions on liposome membranes may account for the different antitumor properties of the two antitumor cytokines and their synergism."
https://openalex.org/W1519762405,"Biochemical signals required for the growth of T cell clones were studied. Antigen-specific helper T cell clones, 6-1 and KO.6, could enter the state similar to the resting state where the cells expressed only small numbers of interleukin 2 (IL2) receptors and could not respond to IL2 without antigenic stimulation. A combination of a phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), and a calcium ionophore, A23187, induced the expression of IL2 receptors on resting 6-1 cells and induced DNA synthesis in the presence of IL2. TPA alone did not induce IL2 receptors. A23187 induced the expression of the receptors to some extent but did not induce DNA synthesis even in the presence of IL2. IL2 receptors induced by A23187 alone were mostly low affinity receptors, whereas the combination of TPA and A23187 induced high affinity receptors in addition to low affinity receptors. Resting KO.6 cells produced IL2 in response to a combination of TPA and A23187, whereas either one of the agents did not induce the production of IL2. Dicaprylin, a permeable diacylglycerol and a potent activator of protein kinase C (the Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) could replace TPA in both cases when dicaprylin was repeatedly added to the culture. These results suggest that strong and continuous activation of protein kinase C together with calcium mobilization is required for IL2 production and IL2 receptor expression. On the contrary, signals for DNA synthesis generated by binding of IL2 to IL2 receptors are different from those for IL2 production and IL2 receptor expression, as the combination of TPA and A23187 could not induce DNA synthesis without IL2."
https://openalex.org/W1498085124,"It has been reported recently (Begin-Heick, N. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 6187-6193) that adipocytes from the obese mouse strain (ob/ob), unlike normal mice (+/+), lack functional Gi, a GTP-regulated protein complex that mediates inhibition of adenylate cyclase. In contrast, we have found functional Gi linked to inhibition of adenylate cyclase in adipocyte membranes from both ob/ob and +/+ mice. This conclusion is based on observation of: 1) GTP-dependent inhibition of adenylate cyclase by antilipolytic agents, such as prostaglandin E2, nicotinic acid, and the adenosine receptor agonist, phenylisopropyladenosine (PIA); 2) classical biphasic GTP kinetics, with stimulation by low and inhibition by high concentrations of GTP; and 3) elimination of cyclase inhibition by antilipolytic agents upon treatment of ob/ob adipocytes with pertussis toxin. Upon treatment with pertussis toxin and [32P] NAD, purified adipocyte membranes from ob/ob mice incorporated twice as much radioactivity per unit membrane protein than those from +/+ mice in the 40,000-42,000 region. The inhibitory actions of PIA on adenylate cyclase were blocked by the adenosine receptor antagonists, theophylline and isobutylmethylxanthine. However, in contrast to other known inhibitory adenosine receptors, relatively high (100 nM) PIA concentrations were required for half-maximal inhibition of adenylate cyclases from both +/+ and ob/ob adipocytes. The adipocyte adenylate cyclase from both mouse strains were approximately equally susceptible to inhibition by nicotinic acid and prostaglandin E2. However, the ob/ob cyclase was inhibited by 47% with PIA, whereas the enzyme from the +/+ mouse was inhibited by only 27% (p less than 0.01). This greater inhibition by adenosine may contribute to abnormal fat metabolism in adipocytes from ob/ob mice."

https://openalex.org/W1516705288,"Defective acute regulation of hepatic glycogen synthase by glucose and insulin, caused by severe insulin deficiency, can be corrected in adult rat hepatocytes in primary culture by inclusion of insulin, triiodothyronine, and cortisol in a chemically defined serum-free culture medium over a 3-day period (Miller, T. B., Jr., Garnache, A. K., Cruz, J., McPherson, R. K., and Wolleben, C. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 785-790). Using primary cultures of hepatocytes isolated from normal and diabetic rats in the same serum-free chemically defined medium, the present study addresses the effects of cycloheximide and actinomycin D on the chronic actions of insulin, triiodothyronine, and cortisol to facilitate the direct effects of glucose on the short-term activation of glycogen synthase. The short-term presence (1 h) of the protein synthesis blockers had no effect on acute activation of glycogen synthase by glucose in primary hepatocyte cultures from normal rats. Normal cells maintained in the presence of cycloheximide or actinomycin D for 2 and 3 days exhibited unimpaired responsiveness to glucose activation of synthase. The protein synthesis inhibitors were effective at blocking the restoration of glucose activation of synthase in diabetic cells in media which restored the activation in their absence. Restoration of glycogen synthase phosphatase activity by insulin, triiodothyronine, and cortisol in primary cultures of diabetic hepatocytes was also blocked by cycloheximide or actinomycin D. These data clearly demonstrate that restoration of acute glycogen synthase activation by glucose and restoration of glycogen synthase phosphatase activity in primary cultures of hepatocytes from adult diabetic rats are dependent upon the synthesis of new protein."
