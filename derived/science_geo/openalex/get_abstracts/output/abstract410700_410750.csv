Here, we define a novel interaction between P-TEFb and BRD4 involving tri-acetylated cyclin T1 (acK380, acK386, and acK309) and the second bromodomain in BRD4. This interaction is observed with the short splice variant of BRD4 (amino acids 1–722) lacking a previously defined C-terminal P-TEFb-interacting domain (PID). Notably, P-TEFb complexes associated with short BRD4 contain HEXIM1 and 7SK snRNA, implicating the PID in the liberation of P-TEFb from the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complex (7SK snPNP). Overexpression of the PID alone in cells dissociates HEXIM1 and 7SK snRNA from P-TEFb, but it is not sufficient to activate P-TEFb-dependent transcription of the HIV LTR. Our data support a model where two BRD4 domains, the second bromodomain and the PID, bind P-TEFb and are required for full transcriptional activation of P-TEFb response genes.

W., Krawczyk, S. A., Kitidis-Mitrokostas, C., Revett, T., Gimeno, R., and Lodish, H. F. (2008) Biochem. J. 416, 161–177). Although recombinant CTRP1 lowers blood glucose in mice, its physiological function, mechanisms of action, and roles in metabolic stress remain unknown. Here, we show that circulating levels of CTRP1 are strikingly reduced in diet-induced obese mice. Overexpressing CTRP1 in transgenic mice improved insulin sensitivity and decreased high-fat diet-induced weight gain. Reduced adiposity resulted from enhanced fatty acid oxidation and energy expenditure, effects mediated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In skeletal muscle of transgenic mice, AMPKα and its downstream target, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), were hyperphosphorylated, indicative of AMPK activation and ACC inhibition. Inactivation of ACC promotes mitochondrial fat oxidation. Consistent with the direct effect of CTRP1 on AMPK signaling, recombinant CTRP1 administration acutely stimulated muscle AMPKα and ACC phosphorylation in vivo. In isolated soleus muscle, recombinant CTRP1 activated AMPK signaling to increase fatty acid oxidation ex vivo, an effect abrogated by an AMPK inhibitor. These results provide the first in vivo evidence that CTRP1 is a novel regulator of fatty acid metabolism.

In our study, high resolution two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was employed to probe structural changes in the IgG1 Fc. A series of (1)H-(15)N heteronuclear single-quantum correlation NMR spectra were collected between pH 2.5 and 4.7 to assess whether unfolding of C(H)2 domains precedes that of C(H)3 domains. The same pH range was subsequently screened in Fc aggregation experiments that utilized molecules of IgG1 and IgG2 subclasses with varying levels of C(H)2 glycosylation. In addition, differential scanning calorimetry data were collected over a pH range of 3-7 to assess changes in C(H)2 and C(H)3 thermostability. As a result, compelling evidence was gathered that emphasizes the importance of C(H)2 stability in determining the rate and extent of Fc aggregation. In particular, we found that Fc domains of the IgG1 subclass have a lower propensity to aggregate compared with those of the IgG2 subclass. Our data for glycosylated, partially deglycosylated, and fully deglycosylated molecules further revealed the criticality of C(H)2 glycans in modulating Fc aggregation. These findings provide important insights into the stability of Fc-based therapeutics and promote better understanding of their acid-induced aggregation process."

Whereas regulation of ENaC by aldosterone is generally accepted, little is known about whether other components of RAAS, such as angiotensin II (Ang II), have nonredundant to aldosterone-stimulatory actions on ENaC. We combined patch clamp electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry in freshly isolated split-opened distal nephrons of mice to determine the mechanism and molecular signaling pathway of Ang II regulation of ENaC. We found that Ang II acutely increases ENaC Po, whereas prolonged exposure to Ang II also induces translocation of α-ENaC toward the apical membrane in situ. Ang II actions on ENaC Po persist in the presence of saturated mineralocorticoid status. Moreover, aldosterone fails to stimulate ENaC acutely, suggesting that Ang II and aldosterone have different time frames of ENaC activation. AT1 but not AT2 receptors mediate Ang II actions on ENaC. Unlike its effect in vasculature, Ang II did not increase [Ca2+]i in split-opened distal nephrons as demonstrated using ratiometric Fura-2-based microscopy. However, application of Ang II to mpkCCDc14 cells resulted in generation of reactive oxygen species, as probed with fluorescent methods. Consistently, inhibiting NADPH oxidase with apocynin abolished Ang II-mediated increases in ENaC Po in murine distal nephron. Therefore, we concluded that Ang II directly regulates ENaC activity in the distal nephron, and this effect complements regulation of ENaC by aldosterone. We propose that stimulation of AT1 receptors with subsequent activation of NADPH oxidase signaling pathway mediates Ang II actions on ENaC.

Yet despite GPCRs representing the largest family of receptors and drug targets, no study has systematically evaluated the MWC mechanism as it applies to GPCR allosteric ligands. We reveal how the recently described allosteric modulator, benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid (BQCA), behaves according to a strict, two-state MWC mechanism at the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR). Despite having a low affinity for the M1 mAChR, BQCA demonstrated state dependence, exhibiting high positive cooperativity with orthosteric agonists in a manner that correlated with efficacy but negative cooperativity with inverse agonists. The activity of BQCA was significantly increased at a constitutively active M1 mAChR but abolished at an inactive mutant. Interestingly, BQCA possessed intrinsic signaling efficacy, ranging from near-quiescence to full agonism depending on the coupling efficiency of the chosen intracellular pathway. This latter cellular property also determined the difference in magnitude of positive cooperativity between BQCA and the orthosteric agonist, carbachol, across pathways. The lack of additional, pathway-biased, allosteric modulation by BQCA was confirmed in genetically engineered yeast strains expressing different chimeras between the endogenous yeast Gpa1 protein and human Gα subunits. These findings define a chemical biological framework that can be applied to the study and classification of allosteric modulators across different GPCR families.

https://openalex.org/W2024120580,"Background The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in 80% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is associated with poor survival. In recent years, EGFR-targeted inhibitors have been tested in the clinic for NSCLC. Despite the emergence of novel therapeutics and their application in cancer therapy, the overall survival rate of lung cancer patients remains 15%. To develop more effective therapies for lung cancer we have combined the anti-EGFR antibody (Clone 225) as a molecular therapeutic with hybrid plasmonic magnetic nanoparticles (NP) and tested on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Methodology/Principal Findings Cell viability was determined by trypan-blue assay. Cellular protein expression was determined by Western blotting. C225-NPs were detected by electron microscopy and confocal microscopy, and EGFR expression using immunocytochemistry. C225-NP exhibited a strong and selective antitumor effect on EGFR-expressing NSCLC cells by inhibiting EGFR-mediated signal transduction and induced autophagy and apoptosis in tumor cells. Optical images showed specificity of interactions between C225-NP and EGFR-expressing NSCLC cells. No binding of C225-NP was observed for EGFR-null NSCLC cells. C225-NP exhibited higher efficiency in induction of cell killing in comparison with the same amount of free C225 antibody in tumor cells with different levels of EGFR expression. Furthermore, in contrast to C225-NP, free C225 antibody did not induce autophagy in cells. However, the therapeutic efficacy of C225-NP gradually approached the level of free antibodies as the amount of C225 antibody conjugated per nanoparticle was decreased. Finally, attaching C225 to NP was important for producing the enhanced tumor cell killing as addition of mixture of free C225 and NP did not demonstrate the same degree of cell killing activity. Conclusions/Significance We demonstrated for the first time the molecular mechanism of C225-NP induced cytotoxic effects in lung cancer cells that are not characteristic for free molecular therapeutics thus increasing efficacy of therapy against NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2055042191,"P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter family, functions as an ATP hydrolysis-driven efflux pump to rid the cell of toxic organic compounds, including a variety of drugs used in anticancer chemotherapy. Here, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) spectroscopy to delineate the structural rearrangements the two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) are undergoing during the catalytic cycle. Pairs of cysteines were introduced into equivalent regions in the N- and C-terminal NBDs for labeling with fluorescent dyes for ensemble and single-molecule FRET spectroscopy. In the ensemble FRET, a decrease of the donor to acceptor (D/A) ratio was observed upon addition of drug and ATP. Vanadate trapping further decreased the D/A ratio, indicating close association of the two NBDs. One of the cysteine mutants was further analyzed using confocal single-molecule FRET spectroscopy. Single Pgp molecules showed fast fluctuations of the FRET efficiencies, indicating movements of the NBDs on a time scale of 10-100 ms. Populations of low, medium, and high FRET efficiencies were observed during drug-stimulated MgATP hydrolysis, suggesting the presence of at least three major conformations of the NBDs during catalysis. Under conditions of vanadate trapping, most molecules displayed high FRET efficiency states, whereas with cyclosporin, more molecules showed low FRET efficiency. Different dwell times of the FRET states were found for the distinct biochemical conditions, with the fastest movements during active turnover. The FRET spectroscopy observations are discussed in context of a model of the catalytic mechanism of Pgp."

A key step in Akt activation is phosphorylation at Ser-473 by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 2 (mTORC2). Although Rictor is required for the stability and activity of mTORC2, little is known about functional regions or post-translational modifications within Rictor that are responsible for regulating mTORC2. Here, we demonstrate that Rictor contains two distinct central regions critical for mTORC2 function. One we refer to as the stability region because it is critical for interaction with Sin1.1 and LST8, and a second adjacent region is required for multisite acetylation. p300-mediated acetylation of Rictor increases mTORC2 activity toward Akt, whereas site-directed mutants within the acetylation region of Rictor exhibit reduced insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)-stimulated mTORC2 kinase activity. Inhibition of deacetylases, including the NAD+-dependent sirtuins, promotes Rictor acetylation and IGF-1-mediated Akt phosphorylation. These results suggest that multiple-site acetylation of Rictor signals for increased activation of mTORC2, providing a critical link between nutrient-sensitive deacetylases and mTORC2 signaling to Akt.

https://openalex.org/W2116252316,"Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a promising anticancer agent that kills various tumor cells without damaging normal tissues. However, many cancers remain resistant to TRAIL. To overcome TRAIL resistance, combination therapies using sensitizers of the TRAIL pathway would be an efficacious approach. To investigate potential sensitizers of TRAIL-induced apoptosis, we used TRAIL-resistant human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-associated adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) cells as a model system. So far, HTLV-1-associated ATL is incurable by presently known therapies. Here, we show that wogonin and the structurally related natural flavones apigenin and chrysin break TRAIL resistance in HTLV-1-associated ATL by transcriptional down-regulation of c-FLIP, a key inhibitor of death receptor signaling, and by up-regulation of TRAIL receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2). This effect is mediated through transcriptional inhibition of the p53 antagonist murine double minute 2 (Mdm2), leading to an increase in p53 levels and, consequently, to up-regulation of the p53 target gene TRAIL-R2. We also show that these flavones can sensitize to TNFα- and CD95-mediated cell death. Furthermore, we show that wogonin, apigenin, and chrysin also enhance TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in other human cancer cell lines including breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, colon cancer cell line HT-29, hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2, melanoma cell line SK-MEL-37, and pancreatic carcinoma cell line Capan-1 by the same mechanism. Thus, our study suggests the potential use of these flavones as an adjuvant for TRAIL-mediated anticancer therapy."

For several of these, the capture of environmental heme is a means of activating aerobic respiration metabolism. Our previous studies in the Gram-positive bacterium Lactococcus lactis showed that heme exposure strongly induced expression of a single operon, called here hrtRBA, encoding an ortholog of the conserved membrane hrt (heme-regulated transporter) and a unique transcriptional regulator that we named HrtR. We show that HrtR expressed as a fusion protein is a heme-binding protein. Heme iron interaction with HrtR is non-covalent, hexacoordinated, and involves two histidines, His-72 and His-149. HrtR specifically binds a 15-nt palindromic sequence in the hrtRBA promoter region, which is needed for hrtRBA repression.

A well studied example is Lactococcus lactis, a lactic acid bacterium used widely for industrial fermentation.

Analogs of the entire system are also present in several other Gram-positive pathogens such as Bacillus anthracis and Corynebacterium diphteriae (21Friedman D.B. Stauff D.L. Pishchany G.

Permease-defective mutants were heme hypersensitive, but a direct role of HrtB-HrtA (HrtBA) in heme efflux was not demonstrated (24Stauff D.L. Bagaley D. Torres V.J. Joyce R. Anderson K.L.

In L. lactis, previous proteomic and transcriptome studies revealed that components of the ygfCBA operon, encoding a putative transcriptional regulator (YgfC), a predicted permease (YgfB), and an ATPase (YgfA) were induced ∼40-fold by hemin (Fe3+PPIX) (27Vido K. Le Bars D. Mistou M.Y. Anglade P. Gruss A. Gaudu P. Proteome analyses of heme-dependent respiration in Lactococcus lactis: involvement of the proteolytic system.J.

However, no genes encoding a two component HssRS system were found adjacent to the ygfCBA operon and the predicted transcriptional regulator, YgfC, was unique to L. lactis, leading us to hypothesize that YgfC is implicated in the regulation of ygfBA genes. Accordingly, ygfC was renamed hrtR (heme-regulated transporter regulator); ygfB and ygfA were renamed hrtB and hrtA, respectively (see Fig. 1A). Here, we report the identification of HrtR as a high affinity heme-binding protein and transcriptional regulator that senses intracellular heme to regulate its intracellular homeostasis by efflux in L. lactis. The strains and plasmids used in this work are listed in supplemental Table 1. Growth of the bacterial strains and plasmid constructions are outlined in the supplemental data. Experiments in L. lactis were all performed in strain MG1363 and derivatives. Oligonucleotides used for plasmid constructions are listed in supplemental Table 2. Hemin (FePPIX) (Fluka) stock solution (10 mm) was prepared in 50 mm NaOH. Stocks of 10 mm protoporphyrin (PPIX), gallium-protoporphyrin (GaPPIX), cobalt-protoporphyrin (CoPPIX), manganese-protoporphyrin (MnPPIX), magnesium-protoporphyrin (MgPPIX), and zinc-protoporphyrin (ZnPPIX) (Frontier Scientific) were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide. Escherichia coli Top10 transformed with pMBP-HrtR was used for the recombinant production of MBP-HrtR. The protein was prepared by affinity chromatography on amylose resin (see supplemental Fig. 1A). The MBP-HrtR-hemin complex was prepared by incubating 50 μg of purified MBP-HrtR with a 2-fold excess of hemin in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Free hemin was removed by chromatography on a Sephadex G-15 gel filtration column (Sigma). Liquid cultures were generally grown to A600 = 0.5 and then incubated for 1 h with the test porphyrin at the indicated concentration. β-Galactosidase (β-gal) activity was assayed on bacteria permeabilized as described (28Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). β-Gal activity was quantified by luminescence in an Infinite M200 spectroluminometer (Tecan) using the β-Glo assay system as recommended by manufacturer (Promega). β-Gal activity was revealed on solid medium by streaking bacteria on LB agar containing 80 μg/ml X-Gal. A 352-bp DNA fragment containing the hrt promoter region was PCR-amplified from MG1363 genomic DNA with primers (O17-O18) (supplemental Table 2). A 352-bp DNA fragment located in the hrtR-coding region was generated similarly with primers (O19-O20) (supplemental Table 2) and used as a negative control. The palindrome was mutated by using overlapping PCR using primers (O17-O22) and (O21-O18) as described (29Lechardeur D. Fernandez A. Robert B. Gaudu P. Trieu-Cuot P. Lamberet G. Gruss A. The 2-Cys peroxiredoxin alkyl hydroperoxide reductase c binds heme and participates in its intracellular availability in Streptococcus agalactiae.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 16032-16041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). O22 and its reverse counterpart O21 were designed to encompass the 15-nt palindromic sequence and in which the 15 nucleotides were randomly altered to produce the sequence: 5′-ATTATATAGAGAGAA-3′ (instead of 5′-ATGACACAGTGTCAT-3′) (supplemental Table 2). The two fragments were annealed and PCR-amplified with primers (O17-O18). Fragments were gel-purified (Invitrogen gel extraction and purification kit) and quantified. MBP-HrtR-DNA binding studies were performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm DTT, and 5% glycerol. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. Binding was analyzed by gel electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide gel in TBE buffer stained with ethidium bromide following electrophoresis. Strains ΔhrtRBA(pCtrl) and ΔhrtRBA(phrtBA) were grown in the absence and presence of 57Fe-hemin. Both strains were grown to A600 = 0.5 prior to addition or not of 3 μm 57FePPIX (Frontier Scientific) for an additional hour. Cells were washed three times in H2O supplemented with 0.5 mm EDTA. Cell pellets were dessicated and mineralized by successive incubations in 65% nitric acid solution. 57Fe was quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) (Agilent 7700X). HrtR was purified as a fusion to the maltose-binding-protein (MBP-HrtR) in E. coli (supplemental Fig. 1A). Cells carrying the MBP-HrtR expression plasmid were pink when isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside inducer was added, suggesting that HrtR could scavenge and bind to endogenous heme (which is red) (Fig. 1B). Purified MBP-HrtR was also colored pink. The protein was saturated with excess hemin and then purified from free hemin by gel filtration chromatography. The purified complex was red, and its UV-visible spectrum at pH 7.4 revealed a Soret band at A414 and β/α bands at 530 and 558 nm, respectively, consistent with ferric hexacoordinate low spin binding through the iron center (Fig. 1C and see below). Reduction of the complex with dithionite resulted in a shift in the Soret band from 414 nm to 426 nm, whereas oxidation with ammonium persulfate did not change the profile, suggesting that HrtR binds ferric hemin in our experimental conditions (supplemental Fig. 1B). The saturation point, as determined by titration, was ∼10 μm hemin, indicating that HrtR binds one molecule of hemin per monomer (supplemental Fig. 1C and inset). This conclusion was substantiated further using the pyridine hemochrome assay to assess heme content: 8 μm MBP-HrtR bound 6.8 ± 0.3 μm hemin (mean ± S.E.; n = 3) (supplemental Fig. 1D). Titration curves were fitted to a one binding site model (see supplemental Materials and Methods). The dissociation constant Kd value of the MBP-HrtR-hemin complex was 0.4 ± 0.2 μm (mean ± S.E.; n = 4). Taken together, these results demonstrate that HrtR is a hemin-binding protein. Members of the TetR family generally repress their own transcription together with the transporters they regulate (30Ramos J.L. Martínez-Bueno M. Molina-Henares A.J. Terán W. Watanabe K. Zhang X. Gallegos M.T. Brennan R. Tobes R. The TetR family of transcriptional repressors.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 326-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). We first verified that HrtR was a repressor of the hrtRBA operon in vivo, using fusions between the hrtRBA promoter region (Phrt), or the promoter and hrtR coding region (PhrthrtR), and the lacZ gene reporter. These constructs were established in a ΔhrtRBA strain. In this context, the Phrt-lac construct was constitutively expressed (Fig. 2A). In contrast, β-gal activity expressed from pPhrthrtR-lac was greatly diminished (Fig. 2A), illustrating that HrtR is a transcriptional repressor of the hrtRBA operon. EMSA confirmed that HrtR specifically binds the hrtRBA promoter region: MBP-HrtR incubated with a 352-bp DNA comprising the hrtRBA promoter region resulted in a DNA shift (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2). A similarly sized DNA fragment corresponding to an internal hrtR region did not shift under the same conditions (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4), indicating specificity of the interaction. TetR family operators usually comprise a 15-nucleotide palindromic sequence with internal palindromic symmetry around a central base pair (30Ramos J.L. Martínez-Bueno M. Molina-Henares A.J. Terán W. Watanabe K. Zhang X. Gallegos M.T. Brennan R. Tobes R. The TetR family of transcriptional repressors.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 326-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). One such palindrome, 5′-ATGACACAGTGTCAT-3′, was identified upstream of the hrtR start codon (Fig. 2C). Its replacement by a 15-nt non-palindromic sequence (5′-ATTATATAGAGAGAA-3′) significantly diminished HrtR binding (Fig. 2D), suggesting that the initial sequence is targeted by HrtR. This conclusion was further substantiated by the deletion of the central adenine of the 15-nt palindrome, which alleviated HrtR binding to the hrt promoter region deleted for the central adenine (supplemental Fig. 2A) and in vivo HrtR-mediated inhibition of PhrtΔAhrtR-lac (supplemental Fig. 2B). We conclude that the 15-nt palindrome is the HrtR DNA binding site. Members of the TetR-like family of transcriptional regulators act as chemical sensors (30Ramos J.L. Martínez-Bueno M. Molina-Henares A.J. Terán W. Watanabe K. Zhang X. Gallegos M.T. Brennan R. Tobes R. The TetR family of transcriptional repressors.Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Binding to their ligands alleviates their interaction with their respective operators, leading to promoter induction (30Ramos J.L. Martínez-Bueno M. Molina-Henares A.J. Terán W. Watanabe K. Zhang X.

These characteristics, together with our findings that HrtR 1) controls hrtRBA operon expression and 2) binds hemin, strongly suggested that hemin is the signal that relieves hrtRBA transcriptional repression. We investigated the in vivo effects of hemin on hrtRBA expression using PhrthrtR-lac as reporter and following β-gal activity (Fig. 3A). PhrthrtR-lac was virtually off in the absence of hemin, establishing the hemin requirement for hrtRBA operon induction. Expression of β-gal was induced at 1 μm and saturated at ∼5 μm hemin. We next studied the role of hemin in HrtR DNA binding activity in vitro with EMSA (Fig. 3B). Addition of hemin to MBP-HrtR abolished formation of the DNA-HrtR complex in a concentration-dependent manner, as seen by the disappearance of the band shift. Complete inhibition was obtained when the MBP-HrtR to hemin ratio was 1:1, consistent with the finding that one HrtR protein binds one molecule of hemin. Several TetR family regulators including E. coli AcrR, the closest HrtR homolog recognize a variety of structurally unrelated compounds (30Ramos J.L. Martínez-Bueno M. Molina-Henares A.J. Terán W. Watanabe K. Zhang X. Gallegos M.T. Brennan R. Tobes R. The TetR family of transcriptional repressors.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 326-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 31Routh M.D. Su C.C. Zhang Q. Yu E.W.

Acta. 2009; 1794: 844-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We investigated the possibility that HrtR might interact with other porphyrins. The capacity of HrtR to bind PPIX and other metal-substituted porphyrins was tested. PPIX, GaPPIX, CoPPIX, MnPPIX, MgPPIX, and ZnPPIX, containing metals that have all coordination chemistry similar to iron (32Stojiljkovic I. Kumar V. Srinivasan N. Non-iron metalloporphyrins: potent antibacterial compounds that exploit haem/Hb uptake systems of pathogenic bacteria.Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 429-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These porphyrins were assayed in vivo for induction of hrtRBA in bacteria harboring pPhrthrtR-lac (Fig. 3C). Surprisingly, in these conditions, hrt induction was strongly dependent on the metal replacing the iron ion of the porphyrin. Only GaPPIX and to a slight extent MnPPIX induced hrtRBA. To validate that these porphyrins were internalized, a plasmid expressing the heme catalase KatA from E. faecalis was established in L. lactis and used as an in vivo indicator; KatA protein was stabilized in the presence of all the PPIX molecules (supplemental Fig. 3) (29Lechardeur D.

Gruss A. Two coregulated efflux transporters modulate intracellular heme and protoporphyrin IX availability in Streptococcus agalactiae.Plos Pathog. 2010; 6: e1000860Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). ZnPPIX and GaPPIX, non-inducing and inducing pPhrthrtR-lac in vivo (Fig. 3C), respectively, were assayed by EMSA (Fig. 3D). Interestingly ZnPPIX had virtually no effect on the DNA shift (Fig. 3D, lane 4), whereas GaPPIX, similar to hemin, abolished the shift (Fig. 3D, lanes 3 and 5). These results confirm that HrtR does not bind all metal porphyrins reinforce our conclusion that FePPIX and GaPPIX specifically bind HrtR and deregulate the hrt promoter . The spectroscopic profile of the MBP-HrtR-heme complex (Figs. 1C and 4A) was characteristic of a low spin hexacoordination of the heme iron as seen by the position of the β and α bands (530 and 558 nm, respectively; Fig. 1C). Low spin coordination implies that two strong amino acids are involved in binding. Likely candidates for axial ligands are histidine, methionine, and cysteine residues. Based on the general structure of TetR transcriptional regulators (30Ramos J.L. Martínez-Bueno M. Molina-Henares A.J. Terán W. Watanabe K. Zhang X. Gallegos M.T. Brennan R. Tobes R. The TetR family of transcriptional repressors.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 326-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), only a single histidine (His-149) was present in the predicted substrate binding C-terminal region of HrtR (supplemental Fig. 4A). Another potential candidate His residue was identified at position 72 of the amino acid chain (His-72), near the border of the predicted DNA-binding region (supplemental Fig. 4A). To test the role of these two histidines in heme binding, we substituted both with aliphatic residues, thus generating the mutant proteins H149L and H72A, and a double mutant H149L/H72A. In both single mutant proteins, the ferric form bound considerably less heme than did the wild type, and the double mutant showed virtually no heme binding (Fig. 4A). For both single mutants, the ferric spectra exhibit reduced and shifted Soret peaks (413, 408, and 410 nm for WT, H72A, and H149L, respectively) and show a reduced α band ∼558 nm, indicating that oxidized heme lost its strong ligand hexacoordinate binding and is most likely pentacoordinate (Fig. 4A, inset). The high spin state of the complex is also highlighted by a characteristic small shoulder above 630 nm (Fig. 4A, inset) (36Ran Y. Liu M. Zhu H. Nygaard T.K. Brown D.E. Fabian M. Dooley D.M. Lei B. Spectroscopic identification of heme axial ligands in HtsA that are involved in heme acquisition by Streptococcus pyogenes.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 2834-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The HrtR H72A/H149L mutant was virtually incapable of binding hemin (Fig. 4A). In the ferrous state, spectral profiles of the WT and mutant HrtR proteins were also typical of pentacoordinate heme coordination (data not shown). Consistently, addition of imidazole to the mutant proteins restored hemin binding, suggesting that imidazole could replace the His ligand substitution (supplemental Fig. 4B) (37Barrick D. Replacement of the proximal ligand of sperm whale myoglobin with free imidazole in the mutant His-93→Gly.Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6546-6554Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 38Marletta M.A. Raising enzymes from the dead and the secrets they can tell.ACS Chem. Biol. 2006; 1: 73-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism spectra of the native and mutant proteins were indistinguishable, indicating that the double histidine mutation did not modify HrtR folding; both WT and mutant proteins contained negative bands at 209 and 220 nm (supplemental Fig. 4C), indicative of α helix-rich proteins, as reported for TetR-like family regulators. Altogether, these data identify His-72 and His-149 as the axial heme ligands. EMSA was performed with HrtR histidine variants (Fig. 4B). Strikingly, both HrtR His variants, and the double-mutated HrtR lost their ability to bind DNA, indicating the importance of the two His residues for binding to both the hrt promoter and hemin. Orthologs of the heme-regulated HrtBA transporter were shown to protect numerous Gram-positive bacteria against heme toxicity (22Torres V.J. Stauff D.L. Pishchany G. Bezbradica J.S. Gordy L.E. Iturregui J. Anderson K.L. Dunman P.M. Joyce S. Skaar E.P. A Staphylococcus aureus regulatory system that responds to host heme and modulates virulence.Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 1: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). An obvious role for HrtBA is to export intracellular heme; however, demonstration has proven difficult, and the substrate for the putative HrtBA transporter remains unidentified (26Stauff D.L. Skaar E.P. Bacillus anthracis HssRS signalling to HrtAB regulates haem resistance during infection.Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 72: 763-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To address this question, we separated HrtBA expression from its regulator, and examined its role when constitutively expressed from the p23 promoter (on plasmid phrtBA; (39van der Vossen J.M. van der Lelie D. Venema G. Isolation and characterization of Streptococcus cremoris Wg2-specific promoters.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1987; 53: 2452-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) in an L. lactis ΔhrtRBA strain. The latter strain exhibited hemin hypersensitivity on solid medium (Fig. 5A). In comparison, the ΔhrtRBA strain carrying phrtBA was insensitive to the same hemin concentration (Fig. 5A) (22Torres V.J. Stauff D.L. Pishchany G. Bezbradica J.S. Gordy L.E. Iturregui J. Anderson K.L. Dunman P.M. Joyce S. Skaar E.P. A Staphylococcus aureus regulatory system that responds to host heme and modulates virulence.Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 1: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). TetR regulators characteristically bind the substrates of the transporter they regulate (30Ramos J.L. Martínez-Bueno M. Molina-Henares A.J. Terán W. Watanabe K. Zhang X. Gallegos M.T. Brennan R. Tobes R. The TetR family of transcriptional repressors.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 326-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Our findings that HrtR binds hemin to regulate hrtRBA operon transcription gave a first indication that HrtBA indeed transports heme. To substantiate this role, we first used HrtR as a cytoplasmic heme sensor in ΔhrtRBA cells that constitutively expressed hrtBA genes on plasmid phrtBA. In this system, hrtR expression was a valid heme sensor, as it was dissociated from hrtBA expression. HrtR activation was followed using the PhrthrtR-lac fusion in cells grown with hemin (Fig. 5B). Addition of 5 μm hemin to the ΔhrtRBA strain resulted in a slight increase in β-gal expression levels compared with the WT strain. Remarkably, constitutive HrtBA expression in the complemented strain resulted in nearly complete extinction of reporter protein expression, indicating that cytoplasmic heme availability was too low to allow HrtR binding. In keeping with these results, More direct evidence for the role of HrtBA as a heme transporter was provided by the cell pellets of the ΔhrtRBA strain grown in hemin showing a red color, whereas pellets of the HrtBA overexpression strain were white (Fig. 5C). The presence of hemin in the two strains was confirmed and quantified by ICP-MS. We used 57FePPIX, which represents only 2.12% of the four stable isotopes of natural terrestrial isotopes. Thus, the 57Fe cellular content is representative of the hemin added to cells independently of environmental iron. Results (Fig. 5D) show ∼2.5-fold lower intracellular 57Fe accumulation in the ΔhrtRBA mutant expressing the HrtBA overproducer plasmid compared with ΔhrtRBA carrying a control plasmid. Taken together, these results indicate that the HrtB permease acts as a heme-specific efflux pump. In this work, we elucidated how intracellular heme homeostasis is managed in the heme auxotroph L. lactis. Our main findings are that HrtR is an intracellular heme sensor that regulates transcription of hrtBA and that HrtBA constitutes a heme efflux pump. Interestingly, as first characterized in S. aureus and in all bacteria studied except for L. lactis, HrtBA is regulated by adjacent genes encoding the two-component heme sensor histidine kinase (HssS) and the response regulator HssR (21Friedman D.B.

Bacillus anthracis HssRS signalling to HrtAB regulates haem resistance during infection.Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 72: 763-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). HssS sensing of extracellular hemin leads to induction of HrtBA, now elucidated to be the heme efflux pump (schematically depicted in Fig. 6, see left panel) (21Friedman D.B. Stauff D.L. Pishchany G. Whitwell C.W. Torres V.J. Skaar E.P. Staphylococcus aureus redirects central metabolism to increase iron availability.PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e87Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 26Stauff D.L. Skaar E.P. Bacillus anthracis HssRS signalling to HrtAB regulates haem resistance during infection.Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 72: 763-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In contrast, in light of our results, lactococci have evolved a specific induction system that relies on intracellular hemin (Fig. 6, right panel). A notable difference between these bacteria is that lactococci are non-pathogenic, whereas the bacteria using the extracellular HssS sensor are Gram-positive pathogens that may be in contact with heme-rich blood. Interestingly, other food and commensal bacteria carry HrtR, HrtB, and HrtA homologs, including the 15-nt inverted repeat 5′-ATGACACAGTGTCAT-3′, supporting the notion that a preference for external versus internal heme sensing might be related to the bacterial biotope (supplemental Table 3). Deciphering the role of HrtR in L. lactis as a heme-modulated transcriptional repressor of hrtBA helped elucidate HrtBA function as a heme efflux transporter. Indeed, TetR family regulators of efflux permeases generally bind the substrate that is transported (30Ramos J.L. Martínez-Bueno M. Molina-Henares A.J. Terán W. Watanabe K. Zhang X. Gallegos M.T. Brennan R. Tobes R. The TetR family of transcriptional repressors.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 326-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar); in the case of HrtR and the adjacent HrtBA permease, that substrate would be heme. Several strong lines of experimental evidence then led us to conclude that heme is the specific substrate for HrtBA-mediated export. This conclusion may be generalized to other Gram-positive bacteria. Interestingly, in contrast to other heme-binding proteins (14Létoffé S. Heuck G. Delepelaire P. Lange N. Wandersman C. Bacteria capture iron from heme by keeping tetrapyrrol skeleton intact.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 11719-11724Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), HrtR shows high binding specificity for heme. Among other metal porphyrins tested, only GaPPIX and to a lesser extent MnPPIX could substitute for hemin. In a recent in vitro study, only porphyrin metals with oxidation state III bound IsdH-NEAT3 with high affinity, suggesting that electrostatic forces play a role in the interaction (40Moriwaki Y. Caaveiro J.M. Tanaka Y. Tsutsumi H. Hamachi I. Tsumoto K. Molecular basis of recognition of antibacterial porphyrins by heme-transporter IsdH-NEAT3 of Staphylococcus aureus.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 7311-7320Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This is not the case for HrtR, as reduced hemin (Fe(II)PPIX) bound the protein. Other parameters such as the ionic radius of iron and gallium, which are very similar (0.62 versus 0.64A), might participate in the strict ligand recognition between HrtR and porphyrin metals (40Moriwaki Y. Caaveiro J.M. Tanaka Y. Tsutsumi H. Hamachi I. Tsumoto K. Molecular basis of recognition of antibacterial porphyrins by heme-transporter IsdH-NEAT3 of Staphylococcus aureus.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 7311-7320Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our findings that HrtBA is functional in L. lactis expands the suggested role and evolution of the hrt system beyond bacterial pathogens where it would protect cells from heme toxicity in conditions of high heme availability (as might be encountered in bacteremia) (22Torres V.J. Stauff D.L. Pishchany G. Bezbradica J.S. Gordy L.E. Iturregui J. Anderson K.L. Dunman P.M. Joyce S. Skaar E.P.

The existence of heme-responsive genes raises questions concerning the natural environments that are home to lactococci. The much improved growth and survival of lactococci in the presence of heme (6Lechardeur D. Cesselin B. Fernandez A. Lamberet G. Garrigues C. Pedersen M. Gaudu P. Gruss A. Using heme as an energy boost for lactic acid bacteria.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2011; 22: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and the expression of several heme-binding proteins may indicate that these bacteria are in contact with heme sources in their ecosystems. We suggest that heme homeostasis may be an important consideration for non-pathogens present, for example, in the gut, where heme stores vary according to contributions from flora, foods, and the host. In this setting, the hrtRBA operon would respond to keep intracellular heme at non-toxic level.

https://openalex.org/W1964001552,"The Ctc1-Stn1-Ten1 (CST) complex is an RPA (replication protein A)-like protein complex that binds to single-stranded (ss) DNA. It localizes at telomeres and is involved in telomere end protection in mammals and plants. It is also known to stimulate DNA polymerase α-primase in vitro. However, it is not known how CST accomplishes these functions in vivo. Here, we report the identification and characterization of Xenopus laevis CST complex (xCST). xCST showed ssDNA binding activity with moderate preference for G (guanine)-rich sequences. xStn1-immunodepleted Xenopus egg extracts supported chromosomal DNA replication in in vitro reconstituted sperm nuclei, suggesting that xCST is not a general replication factor. However, the immunodepletion or neutralization of xStn1 compromised DNA synthesis on ssDNA template. Because primed ssDNA template was replicated in xStn1-immunodepleted extracts as efficiently as in control ones, we conclude that xCST is involved in the priming step on ssDNA template. These results are consistent with the current model that CST is involved in telomeric C-strand synthesis through the regulation of DNA polymerase α-primase."
https://openalex.org/W2064061237,"Large carnivores living in tropical rainforests are under immense pressure from the rapid conversion of their habitat. In response, millions of dollars are spent on conserving these species. However, the cost-effectiveness of such investments is poorly understood and this is largely because the requisite population estimates are difficult to achieve at appropriate spatial scales for these secretive species. Here, we apply a robust detection/non-detection sampling technique to produce the first reliable population metric (occupancy) for a critically endangered large carnivore; the Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae). From 2007–2009, seven landscapes were surveyed through 13,511 km of transects in 394 grid cells (17×17 km). Tiger sign was detected in 206 cells, producing a naive estimate of 0.52. However, after controlling for an unequal detection probability (where p = 0.13±0.017; ±S.E.), the estimated tiger occupancy was 0.72±0.048. Whilst the Sumatra-wide survey results gives cause for optimism, a significant negative correlation between occupancy and recent deforestation was found. For example, the Northern Riau landscape had an average deforestation rate of 9.8%/yr and by far the lowest occupancy (0.33±0.055). Our results highlight the key tiger areas in need of protection and have led to one area (Leuser-Ulu Masen) being upgraded as a ‘global priority’ for wild tiger conservation. However, Sumatra has one of the highest global deforestation rates and the two largest tiger landscapes identified in this study will become highly fragmented if their respective proposed roads networks are approved. Thus, it is vital that the Indonesian government tackles these threats, e.g. through improved land-use planning, if it is to succeed in meeting its ambitious National Tiger Recovery Plan targets of doubling the number of Sumatran tigers by 2022."
https://openalex.org/W1978562641,"The root nodule nitrogen fixing symbiosis between legume plants and soil bacteria called rhizobia is of great agronomical and ecological interest since it provides the plant with fixed atmospheric nitrogen. The establishment of this symbiosis is mediated by the recognition by the host plant of lipo-chitooligosaccharides called Nod Factors (NFs), produced by the rhizobia. This recognition is highly specific, as precise NF structures are required depending on the host plant. Here, we study the importance of different LysM domains of a LysM-Receptor Like Kinase (LysM-RLK) from Medicago truncatula called Nod factor perception (NFP) in the recognition of different substitutions of NFs produced by its symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti. These substitutions are a sulphate group at the reducing end, which is essential for host specificity, and a specific acyl chain at the non-reducing end, that is critical for the infection process. The NFP extracellular domain (ECD) contains 3 LysM domains that are predicted to bind NFs. By swapping the whole ECD or individual LysM domains of NFP for those of its orthologous gene from pea, SYM10 (a legume plant that interacts with another strain of rhizobium producing NFs with different substitutions), we showed that NFP is not directly responsible for specific recognition of the sulphate substitution of S. meliloti NFs, but probably interacts with the acyl substitution. Moreover, we have demonstrated the importance of the NFP LysM2 domain for rhizobial infection and we have pinpointed the importance of a single leucine residue of LysM2 in that step of the symbiosis. Together, our data put into new perspective the recognition of NFs in the different steps of symbiosis in M. truncatula, emphasising the probable existence of a missing component for early NF recognition and reinforcing the important role of NFP for NF recognition during rhizobial infection."

Collectively, these studies indicate that GRTH, a multifunctional RNA helicase, acts as a negative regulator of miRNA-469 biogenesis and consequently their function during spermatogenesis. IntroductionMammalian spermatogenesis is a complex process in which primary germ cells undergo mitotic and meiotic divisions to generate haploid round spermatids, and proceed to the differentiation process of spermiogenesis that produces elongating spermatids and mature sperm. This process is regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels by the integrated expression of an array of testicular genes in a precise temporal sequence (1Steger K. Anat. Embryol. 2001; 203: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 2Eddy E.M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2002; 57: 103-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Chromatin compactation that occurs in elongated spermatids during spermiogenesis is essential for nuclear condensation to generate mature spermatozoa. This repackaging event is achieved by replacing histones with transition proteins (TP1 and TP2), which in turn are replaced by protamines (Prm1 and Prm2). The initial active transcription phase with translational repression is followed by cessation of transcription associated with chromatin modifications. mRNA of genes that are essential for later stages of spermiogenesis are generated well prior their translation. Several mRNAs that associate with messenger ribonuclear proteins are repressed translationally at cytoplasmic sites, presumably in the chromatoid body of round spermatids.Gonadotropin-regulated testicular RNA helicase (GRTH 2The abbreviations used are: GRTHgonadotropin-regulated testicular RNA helicasentnucleotideqRTquantitative RTmiRNAmicroRNACBchromatoid bodyMREmiR-469 response elementCDcoding regionpri-miRNAprimary miRNA. /DDX25), a testis-specific member of the DEAD (Asp-Glu-Gly-Asp)-box family present in Leydig and germ cells (meiotic spermatocytes and round spermatids) is regulated developmentally by androgen at the transcriptional level (3Tang P.Z.

Androl. 2010; 31: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). GRTH is a multifunctional protein, and as component of messenger ribonuclear protein, it transports target mRNAs from the nucleus to cytoplasmic sites (chromatoid bodies, a perinuclear organelle of nuage structure in spermatids for storage/processing) and to polyribosomes for translation (7Sheng Y.

GRTH is essential to govern the structure of the chromatoid body (CB) and to maintain systems that may participate in mRNA storage and their processing during spermatogenesis (8Sato H. Tsai-Morris C.H. Dufau M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1803: 534-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). GRTH knock-out male mice are sterile, with azoospermia caused by a complete arrest of spermiogenesis at step 8/9 of round spermatids and failure to elongate. The CB was condensed and greatly reduced in size in the round spermatids of GRTH-null mice (9Tsai-Morris C.H. Sheng Y. Lee E. Lei K.J. Dufau M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 6373-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Accumulated evidence indicates that members of the small interfering RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) pathway, which include Dicer to process si/miRNA precursors to mature small RNAs, the effector complex RNA-induced silencing complex, and mouse vasa homolog, another germ cell helicase, are present in the CB (10Kotaja N.

Preservation of the expression of relevant mRNAs with failure of protein expression such as angiotensin-converting enzyme, transition protein 1 (TP1), and transition protein 2 (TP2) in the GRTH-null mice indicate that GRTH is also involved in post-transcriptional events.microRNAs, a class of ∼22-nt noncoding RNAs, participate in diverse biological functions by promoting degradation and inhibition of translation of target mRNAs. With the exception of miRNAs generated within introns of protein-coding genes, most miRNAs are derived from primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) transcribed by RNA polymerase II, which are 5′-capped and polyadenylated (12Han J. Lee Y. Yeom K.H. Kim Y.K. Jin H. Kim V.N. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3016-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar, 13Han J. Lee Y. Yeom K.H. Nam J.W. Heo I. Rhee J.K. Sohn S.Y. Cho Y. Zhang B.T. Kim V.N. Cell. 2006; 125: 887-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). pri-miRNAs are subsequently processed by the Drosha-DGCR8 complex in the nucleus to generate precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs), which are exported by Exportin-5 to the cytoplasm where mature miRNAs are generated via a Dicer-dependent or -independent route (14Krol J. Loedige I. Filipowicz W. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar, 15Miyoshi K. Miyoshi T. Siomi H. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2010; 284: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Recent findings of individual miRNAs expressed during spermatogenesis in a developmental stage-specific manner suggest the participation of miRNAs in male germ cell development through their contribution to cell type-specific profiles of protein expression during spermatogenesis (16Yu Z. Raabe T. Hecht N.B. Biol. Reprod. 2005; 73: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 17Ro S. Park C. Sanders K.M. McCarrey J.R. Yan W. Dev. Biol. 2007; 311: 592-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar).To elucidate regulatory actions of GRTH in miRNA processing during germ cell development, we first compared the differential expression profiles of miRNA in purified round spermatids from wild type and GRTH null mice. A panel of miRNAs and some of their corresponding pri-miRNAs was significantly increased in the GRTH-null mice. Among the various up-regulated miRNAs, the testis-specific miR-469 with cell expression similar to GRTH was selected to pursue further studies (16Yu Z. Raabe T. Hecht N.B. Biol. Reprod. 2005; 73: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). miR-469 repressed the translation of TP2 and Prm2 through binding to the coding region of TP2 and Prm2 mRNAs. This is consistent with the preservation of TP2 and Prm2 mRNA with the failure of their protein expression found in the GRTH null mice (7Sheng Y. Tsai-Morris C.H. Gutti R. Maeda Y. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35048-35056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Also, GRTH appears to negatively regulate Drosha/DGCR8 gene expression to control microRNA maturation. This study has provided insights into a novel molecular control mechanism of GRTH through the microRNA pathway in the regulation of spermatogenesis.DISCUSSIONThis study has demonstrated a subset of microRNAs that were differentially up-regulated in round spermatids of GRTH KO mice, including testis-specific miR-469, testis-preferred (miR-34c and miR-470), ubiquitous let-7 family members, and others that might participate in germ cell development (Fig. 1). The primary miRNAs of interest were also increased along with the enzyme complex (Drosha-DGCR8) that promotes the processing of primary miRNA transcripts. Our studies provide evidence that miR-469 specifically targets chromatin remodeling gene products TP2 and Prm2, which are essential for germ cell development, and further understanding of the GRTH regulatory function during spermatogenesis.It is interesting to note in the present microarray analysis the presence of solely differentially up-regulated microRNAs (Fig. 1, I and II) covering a wide range cellular actions that could participate in germ cell development. This type of up-regulation was similarly observed in the absence of Tdrd6 gene expression where the majority of differentially expressed miRNAs (91%) were up-regulated. Tdrd6 is a Tudor domain containing protein that exhibits the same pattern of expression as GRTH and is also required for the architecture of the chromatoid and the progress of spermiogenesis (9Tsai-Morris C.H. Sheng Y. Lee E. Lei K.J. Dufau M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 6373-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 22Vasileva A. Tiedau D. Firooznia A. Müller-Reichert T. Jessberger R. Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 630-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Only the miRNAs miR-29c, miR-34a, miR-34c, and miR-470 were commonly up-regulated in both null mice models. Target scan predicted DNA-modifying enzymes (DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase), RNA-processing enzyme (Dicer), and eukaryotic translational initiation factors as the miRNA target genes. This suggests a common control mechanism that might be shared by both GRTH and Tdrd6. Some aspects of the specificity of GRTH action differing from Tdrd6 rely on the unique regulation of miRNAs like miR-469 through its association with the coding region of chromatin remodeling genes TP2 and Prm2 (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6). Other not yet identified miRNAs differentially regulated by GRTH could also target TP2 and Prm2 in this mouse model. Neither target scan nor RNA22 program revealed any other miRNA candidates in the panel of differentially expressed species (WT versus KO) targeting TP2 and Prm2 in this study. The interaction between miRNAs and target genes seems to play an important factor in the regulation of stage-specific expression of germ cell genes.In addition to the fact that both GRTH and miR-469 are expressed specifically in the testis, the striking similarity of their increased expression from puberty to adulthood (3Tang P.Z. Tsai-Morris C.H. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37932-37940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Yu Z. Raabe T. Hecht N.B. Biol. Reprod. 2005; 73: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and the cell-specific expression in the late stage of meiosis and round spermatids (4Sheng Y. Tsai-Morris C.H. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27796-27803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16Yu Z. Raabe T. Hecht N.B. Biol. Reprod. 2005; 73: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 17Ro S. Park C. Sanders K.M. McCarrey J.R. Yan W. Dev. Biol. 2007; 311: 592-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) indicate their functional importance during testicular spermatogenesis. Evidence for the presence of mature miR-469 in round spermatids and its functional role in the regulation of genes (TP2/Prm2) required for chromatin remodeling during spermatogenesis have been shown in this study. The finding of an increased miR-469 level in the absence of GRTH (Fig. 1) led us to propose that GRTH might have an intrinsic regulatory role to prevent overexpression of miR-469 and possible others shown to be up-regulated in this study.miR-34c, is also known to be highly expressed in the spermatocytes and round spermatids (23Bouhallier F. Allioli N. Lavial F. Chalmel F. Perrard M.H. Durand P. Samarut J. Pain B. Rouault J.P. RNA. 2010; 16: 720-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Although the RNA22 program predicted few potential low energy binding sites in the target genes of interest (Fig. 3) governed by GRTH (7Sheng Y. Tsai-Morris C.H. Gutti R. Maeda Y. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35048-35056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), none of these genes were proven as miR-34c targets by the dual-luciferase analysis (data not shown). However, it is conceivable that the miR-34c target Transforming growth factor inhibitor 2 (TGIF2), a known inhibitor of the TGFβ receptor/signaling pathway for its regulation during spermatogenesis (24Damestoy A. Perrard M.H. Vigier M. Sabido O. Durand P. Reprod. Biol. Endocrinol. 2005; 3: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 25Itman C. Loveland K.L. Dev. Dyn. 2008; 237: 97-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), might be linked to GRTH regulation. Other evolutionarily conserved members of miR-34 family, miR-34a and -34b, known to have a role in determining cell fate, provide a new avenue for the GRTH action in the germ cells.From the 13 let-7 miRNAs family members evolutionarily conserved from Drosophila to human, let-7a/d, -b, and -e–g were up-regulated in GRTH KO mice. let-7 members have either activator or repressor function depending on specific cellular stages. let-7 is known to target endonuclease Dicer within its coding region as a mechanism for a miRNA/Dicer autoregulatory negative feedback loop (26Forman J.J. Legesse-Miller A. Coller H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 14879-14884Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). This appears not to be the case in the GRTH KO mice model where no change in Dicer protein expression was observed (8Sato H. Tsai-Morris C.H. Dufau M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1803: 534-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) despite the marked increases noted in several members of the let-7 family (Fig. 1I, panel B). High level of let-7 expression has been proposed as a unique property of testis-derived male stem cell germ line for primordial germ cells' proliferation and development (27Jung Y.H. Gupta M.K. Shin J.Y. Uhm S.J. Lee H.T. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2010; 16: 804-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 28Hayashi K. Chuva de Sousa Lopes S.M. Kaneda M. Tang F. Hajkova P. Lao K. O'Carroll D.

Zhu H. Perez-Atayde A. Frazier A.L. Surani M.A. Daley G.Q. Nature. 2009; 460: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In contrast, in many human cancers, let-7 expression is deregulated, and let-7 is widely viewed as a tumor suppressor (30Boyerinas B. Park S.M. Hau A. Murmann A.E. Peter M.E. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2010; 17: F19-F36Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). In pituitary adenomas, the negative regulation of high mobility group protein A2 (HMGA2) by let-7 is believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease (31Qian Z.R. Asa S.L. Siomi H. Siomi M.C. Yoshimoto K. Yamada S. Wang E.L. Rahman M.M. Inoue H. Itakura M. Kudo E. Sano T. Mod. Pathol. 2009; 22: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The HMGA2 is a non-histone chromatin protein that binds DNA in AT regions and can regulate transcription by altering chromatin structure and consequently promoting the assembly of transcription factor complexes (32Sgarra R. Rustighi A. Tessari M.A. Di Bernardo J. Altamura S. Fusco A. Manfioletti G. Giancotti V. FEBS Lett. 2004; 574: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Its expression is highest in pachytene spermatocytes and early spermatids, and disruption of the HMGA2 gene results in a block of spermatogenesis with testis showing degenerating spermatocytes and few spermatids (33Chieffi P. Battista S. Barchi M. Di Agostino S. Pierantoni G.M. Fedele M. Chiariotti L. Tramontano D. Fusco A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3644-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the GRTH KO mice, the HMGA2 protein is completely absent, but its mRNA level was unchanged compared with the WT (7Sheng Y. Tsai-Morris C.H. Gutti R. Maeda Y. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35048-35056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). let-7 increases in the GRTH KO could effectively silence the HMGA2 mRNA and prevent its expression, and its deficiency could contribute to the phenotype observed in the GRTH KO mice. Thus, let-7 regulation of germ cell target induced by GRTH regulation during spermatogenesis could be envisioned.Identification of putative functional response element (MRE) sites localized only within the coding region of TP2 and Prm2 provides evidence for a nonclassical regulation of these target genes by miR-469 (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6). It was further demonstrated that the regulation occurred through the repression of protein translation with no effect on mRNA degradation (Fig. 7). Most of the reported functional mammalian microRNAs were found to target 3′-UTR sequences, and few studies have revealed 5′-UTR participation. More recently, evidence of elements within the coding region of mRNA have been found to be targeted by miRNAs (34Lee E.K. Gorospe M. RNA Biol. 2011; 8: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Our studies have clearly shown exclusive participation of functional binding sites in the coding region and excluded cooperating 3′-UTR sequences for miR-469. The presence of functional binding sites for both genes was demonstrated in their mRNA coding region (two for Prm2 and one for TP2) through assessment by deletions and mutagenesis. The RNA folding program further confirmed those functional motifs by their complete complementarity with miR-469 5′ seed sequence (at bp 2–8 of the microRNA) to form stable RNA-miRNA duplex with low energy (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6) (35Brennecke J.

The functional importance of miRNA targeting coding regions and mechanism of miRNA-mediated translational repression are not well understood compared with the 3′-UTR (14Krol J. Loedige I. Filipowicz W. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar). We speculate that the presence of two functional miR-469 MREs in Prm2 versus one in TP2 might contribute to the higher degree of down-regulation in the protein level of Prm2 compared with TP2 observed in the dual-luciferase assay (Fig. 3) and in vitro expression studies (Fig. 7).Progress has been gradually unveiled in understanding the function of miRNAs during male germ cell development. The base pairing complementarity of the microRNA with imperfect duplexes guides the endoribonuclease Argonaute (Ago) to repress the translational level or alternatively to degrade the target mRNA directly (36Shyu A.B. Wilkinson M.F. van Hoof A. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Previous evidence relates to the degradation of target gene mRNA message through mRNA deadenylation, such as down-regulation of TP2 by miR-122a (16Yu Z. Raabe T. Hecht N.B. Biol. Reprod. 2005; 73: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), TGIF2, and NOTCH2 by miR-34c (23Bouhallier F. Allioli N. Lavial F. Chalmel F. Perrard M.H. Durand P. Samarut J. Pain B. Rouault J.P. RNA. 2010; 16: 720-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and heat shock factor 2 (HSF2) by miR-18 (37Björk J.K. Sandqvist A. Elsing A.N. Kotaja N. Sistonen L. Development. 2010; 137: 3177-3184Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). miR-122a reported to specifically associate with the 3′-UTR of TP2 (16Yu Z. Raabe T. Hecht N.B. Biol. Reprod. 2005; 73: 427-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) was not identified in the present differential microarray panel (GRTH WT versus KO). In the case of miR-469-mediated down-regulation of Prm2 and TP2, our studies point to the repression of both Prm2 and TP2 at the translational level with minor effect on mRNA degradation. This is in contrast to a recent study indicating the predominant destabilization of targets with at least one 3′-UTR site by microRNAs (38Guo H. Ingolia N.T. Weissman J.S. Bartel D.P. Nature. 2010; 466: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (3060) Google Scholar). In our case, two target sites for miR-469 in each Prm2 and TP2 mRNA were located within their coding region (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6).Gene expression such as Prm2 and TP2 in haploid spermatids requires temporal uncoupling of transcription and translation. These mRNAs destined for translation during the late spermiogenesis phase (elongating and elongated spermatids, steps 9–16) are actively transcribed prior to the step 9 of round spermatids. It has been long postulated that those messages are temporarily stored in the chromatoid body to await the specific time to be translated (10Kotaja N. Bhattacharyya S.N. Jaskiewicz L. Kimmins S. Parvinen M. Filipowicz W. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 2647-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 11Kotaja N. Sassone-Corsi P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Translation followed by chromatin condensation and nuclear elongation ultimately progresses to the generation of mature germ cells. Expression profiling array in the mouse testis (17Ro S. Park C. Sanders K.M. McCarrey J.R. Yan W. Dev. Biol. 2007; 311: 592-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) showed a high level of miR-469 expression coincident with the phase of classic active transcription and suppressed TP2/Prm2 translation in the meiotic and early haploid germ cells. This is followed by its decreased expression in elongating spermatids with active TP2/Prm2 protein production. The direct evidence on miR-469 targeting these messages to repress the translation observed in this study (Fig. 7) support the physiological relevance of miR-469 in germ cell development under GRTH regulation.The chromatoid body of haploid round spermatids has been viewed as the center of miRNA-mediated mRNA control to coordinate post-transcriptional gene expression during spermiogenesis (10Kotaja N. Bhattacharyya S.N. Jaskiewicz L. Kimmins S. Parvinen M. Filipowicz W. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 2647-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 11Kotaja N. Sassone-Corsi P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). GRTH does not associate with any of the components of the RNA-induced silencing complex or other RNA helicase like Mvh involved in this regulation, but it is required for the preservation of the structural integrity of the CB and as transport protein to deliver mRNAs for silencing or processing (8Sato H. Tsai-Morris C.H. Dufau M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1803: 534-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The up-regulated miRNAs found in the GRTH−/− mice most likely function at cytoplasmic sites other than the CB because this organelle was strikingly condensed and highly decreased in size in GRTH-null mice (9Tsai-Morris C.H. Sheng Y. Lee E. Lei K.J. Dufau M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 6373-6378Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Moreover, the relevant proteins of the RNA-induced silencing complex that normally reside in the CB of the WT mice are excluded from this organelle in the GRTH KO (8Sato H. Tsai-Morris C.H. Dufau M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1803: 534-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Dual actions of GRTH in controlling at the nuclear level both primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) of interest and enzymes (Drosha and DGCR8) point to its importance in germ cell miRNA biogenesis (Fig. 2). A connection between testis-specific GRTH, Drosha/DGCR8, mature miR-469, and Prm2/TP2 has been implied indirectly from our comparative studies in GRTH wild type versus GRTH KO mice. However, direct demonstration of this microRNA biogenesis and its impact in Prm2/TP2 protein expression must await the development of suitable germ cell cultures of spermatocytes and round spermatids that would permit optimal silencing of multiple messages (i.e. Drosha/DGCR8/Dicer) and quantitative evaluation of protein expression.Because both pri-mRNA and enzyme complexes are localized in the nucleus, the 56-kDa nuclear form of GRTH protein is likely to regulate their expression at the level of transcription and/or message stability through a not yet identified mechanism. Our recent studies (not shown) have demonstrated comparable half-lives of Drosha and DGCR8 messages in GRTH wild type and GRTH KO mice. This indicates that GRTH could directly or indirectly regulate members of the microprocessor complex at the transcriptional level. Unlike members of DEAD-box protein family, p68 and p72, which associate Drosha-DGCR8 microprocessor complex (39Fukuda T. Yamagata K. Fujiyama S. Matsumoto T. Koshida I. Yoshimura K. Mihara M. Naitou M. Endoh H. Nakamura T. Akimoto C. Yamamoto Y. Katagiri T. Foulds C. Takezawa S. Kitagawa H. Takeyama K. O'Malley B.W. Kato S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), GRTH does not associate with this complex as was determined by immunoprecipitation. Also, it was not associated with mRNAs of Drosha and DGCR8 in combined immunoprecipitation/RT-PCR studies (data not shown).It is conceivable that during early stages of the haploid phase (round spermatids) miR-469 represses TP2 and Prm2 protein expression by silencing message translation in these germ cells. In elongated spermatids, decreased miR-469 expression (17Ro S. Park C. Sanders K.M. McCarrey J.R. Yan W. Dev. Biol. 2007; 311: 592-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) could release the translational repression of TP2 and Prm2 to proceed with the mRNA processing in a sequential manner. In the case of GRTH-null mice, TP2 and Prm2 mRNA translations were repressed due to the aberrant miR-469 expression level. Moreover, transport of relevant messages to polysomal sites by GRTH and its proposed function in translation is curtailed in GRTH KO mice (5Dufau M.L. Tsai-Morris C.H. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 18: 314-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 6Tsai-Morris C.H. Sheng Y. Gutti R.K. Tang P.Z. Dufau M.L. J.

Increased miRNAs in the GRTH-null mice could silence the protein expression of a number of genes post-transcriptionally and thus cause spermatogenesis arrest at the round spermatid stage 7–8 and failure to elongate (Fig. 8).In summary, we conclude that a negative regulation of GRTH via the route of miRNA biogenesis/action may play an important role during spermatogenesis (Fig. 8). These regulatory aspects provide insights into a novel molecular mechanism of GRTH function during male germ cell development. IntroductionMammalian spermatogenesis is a complex process in which primary germ cells undergo mitotic and meiotic divisions to generate haploid round spermatids, and proceed to the differentiation process of spermiogenesis that produces elongating spermatids and mature sperm. This process is regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels by the"
https://openalex.org/W2107073759,"Sulfiredoxin (Srx) is an enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of cysteine sulfinic acid of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxins (Prxs). Having high affinity toward H2O2, 2-Cys Prxs can efficiently reduce H2O2 at low concentration. We previously showed that Prx I is hyperoxidized at a rate of 0.072% per turnover even in the presence of low steady-state levels of H2O2. Here we examine the novel role of Srx in cells exposed to low steady-state levels of H2O2, which can be achieved by using glucose oxidase. Exposure of low steady-state levels of H2O2 (10-20 μm) to A549 or wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells does not lead to any significant change in oxidative injury because of the maintenance of balance between H2O2 production and elimination. In contrast, loss-of-function studies using Srx-depleted A549 and Srx-/- MEF cells demonstrate a dramatic increase in extra- and intracellular H2O2, sulfinic 2-Cys Prxs, and apoptosis. Concomitant with hyperoxidation of mitochondrial Prx III, Srx-depleted cells show an activation of mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathways including mitochondria membrane potential collapse, cytochrome c release, and caspase activation. Furthermore, adenoviral re-expression of Srx in Srx-depleted A549 or Srx-/- MEF cells promotes the reactivation of sulfinic 2-Cys Prxs and results in cellular resistance to apoptosis, with enhanced removal of H2O2. These results indicate that Srx functions as a novel component to maintain the balance between H2O2 production and elimination and then protects cells from apoptosis even in the presence of low steady-state levels of H2O2."

Recent studies reveal that ER Ca2+ depletion is not the only stress condition that modulates STIM activation. STIM1 is activated in response to oxidant stress, reactive oxygen species inducing STIM1 translocation, and coupling to open Orai channels independent of ER Ca2+ store depletion (11Hawkins B.J. Irrinki K.M. Mallilankaraman K. Lien Y.C. Wang Y. Bhanumathy C.D. Subbiah R. Ritchie M.F. Soboloff J. Baba Y. Kurosaki T. Joseph S.K. Gill D.L. Madesh M. J.

Biochem. 2011; 112: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Acute responses to hypoxic stress in vascular, airway, cardiac, and neural tissues are crucial to effect rapid adaptive functions in response to oxygen deprivation (16Cassavaugh J. Lounsbury K.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2011; 112: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 17Shimoda L.A. Polak J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2011; 300: C951-C967Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Longer term responses to hypoxic stress involve changes in gene expression through transcriptional regulators such as the hypoxia-inducible factors that control key compensatory responses to protect tissues from sustained oxygen depletion (15Majmundar A.J. Wong W.J. Simon M.C. Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 294-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). Whereas the short and long term responses to hypoxic stress are well known, the initial mechanisms for sensing hypoxia have remained poorly defined. Ion channels, in particular both K+ and Ca2+ channels, are considered key early mediators of hypoxic stress sensing (17Shimoda L.A. Polak J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2011; 300: C951-C967Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); however, whether they are direct sensors of decreased oxygen or are functionally indirectly modified remains unclear (17Shimoda L.A. Polak J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2011; 300: C951-C967Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We reveal here that hypoxic stress rapidly and reversibly inactivates STIM/Orai-mediated Ca2+ entry and the associated highly selective Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current (ICRAC). The effect is observed on opening of endogenous Orai channels functioning in primary smooth muscle cells and also on functional coupling between STIM1 and Orai1 proteins overexpressed in HEK293 cells. We reveal that the action of hypoxic stress on STIM-Orai coupling is mediated by a rapid hypoxia-induced decline in cytosolic pH. This hypoxia-induced acidification blocks the functional coupling between the STIM-Orai activating regions (SOAR) of STIM1 required for Orai1 channel gating. The results suggest that the electrostatic interaction known to mediate coupling between STIM1 and Orai1 may operate as a pH-sensing mechanism to control Ca2+ entry signals in response to hypoxia. Primary cultures of hASMC were obtained from lung transplant donors in accordance with procedures approved by the University of Pennsylvania Committee on Studies Involving Humans as described previously (18Panettieri R.A.

For ASMC, verapamil (10 μm) was added to the extracellular buffer to block the L-type channel. Measurements shown are representative of a minimum of three independent experiments. Electrophysiological recordings were generated using conventional whole-cell patch clamp, as described previously (24Zhou Y. Mancarella S. Wang Y. Yue C. Ritchie M. Gill D.L. Soboloff J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 19164-19168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), using cells grown on glass coverslips within the recording chamber. Immediately after establishing the whole-cell configuration, linear voltage ramps of 50-ms duration spanning the voltage range of −100 to +100 mV were delivered from a holding potential of 0 mV at a rate of 0.5 Hz. We used automatic capacitive and series resistance compensation of the EPC-10 amplifier (HEKA Electronics). PatchMaster and Origin software were used for acquisition and analysis. The temporal development of inward current (at −100 mV) was measured from the individual ramps. The pipette solution contained the following (in mm): 145 CsGlu, 10 HEPES, 10 BAPTA, 8 NaCl, 10 Mg2+, 2 Mg2+-ATP, pH 7.2. The excess Mg2+ and ATP were used to ensure inhibition of endogenous TRPM7 channels. At the time of break-in, the extracellular solution contained 145 NaCl, 10 CsCl, 2.8 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, pH 7.4. For smooth muscle patch clamp studies, verapamil (10 μm) and niflumic acid (30 μm) were included in the external solution to inhibit any residual L-type voltage Ca2+ channel activity and Cl− currents, respectively. Osmolarity of all solutions was adjusted to 300 mosm/liter. 10 mm CaCl2 was added to the external solution after break-in. The maximal Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (ICRAC) currents at −100 mV after leak subtraction were used for statistical analysis. Experiments were performed in HEK293 cells stably expressing Orai1-CFP and transiently transfected with STIM1-YFP, STIM2-YFP, YFP-SOAR, or STIM1ct-YFP. Fluorescence was examined with a Leica DMI 6000B fluorescence microscope equipped with CFP (438Ex/483Em), YFP (500Ex/542Em), and FRETraw (438Ex/542Em) filters controlled by Slidebook 4.2 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations). Images (FCFP, FYFP, and Fraw) were obtained every 10–20 s at room temperature with a ×40 oil objective (N.A.1.35; Leica). Three-channel corrected FRET was calculated based on the following formula: FRETc = Fraw − Fd/Dd·FCFP − Fa/Da·FYFP, where FRETc represents the corrected total amount of energy transfer; Fd/Dd represents measured bleed through of CFP through the YFP filter (0.473); Fa/Da represents measured bleed through of YFP through the CFP filter (0.049). To reduce variations caused by differences in expression levels of CFP, the above FRETc values were normalized against donor fluorescence (FCFP). To minimize the effect of variations of YFP expression levels on FCFP-normalized FRET signals (FRETN) and to show the relative changes as compared with resting levels, figures are shown as ΔFRETN/FRETNrest. Fluorescence images and FRET analyses shown are typical of at least three separate experiments. In control experiments, we used N-terminally (as opposed to C-terminally) labeled STIM1 coexpressed with Orai1-CFP and detected no measurable FRET signal upon store depletion or with dithionite or NH4+ addition, indicating that the FRET signals represent authentic STIM-Orai interactions. 1 mm dithionite caused only marginal changes in YFP and CFP fluorescence; hence, observed changes in FRET are not due to direct effects of pH, in agreement with studies showing minor changes in CFP-YFP FRET due to pH changes from 7.0 to 6.5 (25Felber L.M. Cloutier S.M. Kündig C. Kishi T. Brossard V. Jichlinski P. Leisinger H.J. Deperthes D. BioTechniques. 2004; 36: 878-885Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as induced by 1 mm dithionite. Image analysis of puncta was undertaken using ImageJ and Slidebook 4.2.0.13 (Olympus). Background was subtracted from the raw image, and noise (less than five consecutive pixels) was filtered out. Images were imported into Slidebook, and the size and number of puncta were measured using the mask function. The density of puncta was obtained by dividing the number of puncta by the size of the cell. Relative cell size was measured from the cell profile using ImageJ. To reconstruct three-dimensional images of cells, CFP or YFP image stacks were collected at 1-μm intervals. The constrained iterative deconvolution function of the Slidebook software was used to minimize fluorescence contamination from out-of-focus planes. Cell images at the ER-PM junction were used for display. For intracellular pHi measurement, confluent HEK293 or smooth muscle cells were detached with 0.04% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA. Cells were washed and incubated with the fluorescent pH indicator 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) at 4 μm for 20 min at 37 °C in HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, supplemented with 1% BSA. Prior to measurements, cells were rinsed and resuspended in BSA-free HEPES buffer and transferred into a glass cuvette. Fluorescence measurements were detected with the RatioMaster cuvette fluorescence system (Photon Technology International Inc.) with the following wavelengths: dual excitation fixed at 492 and 438 nm; emission wavelength at 525 nm. Calibration of BCECF fluorescence was performed in HEPES buffer using carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) and titrated with solutions of NaOH and HCl as described (26James-Kracke M.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Sodium propionate and ammonium chloride were added in the same buffers used for cell perfusion and were made the same day of the experiments. 3-Month-old male C57BL/62 mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and thoracic aortas were removed and placed in ice-cold PBS with calcium and magnesium. The aorta was then cut into four 2.5-mm rings using a sharp surgical blade. 40-μm diameter stainless steel wires were threaded through the rings and then mounted on the support brackets within the tissue organ bath of a Radnoti Wire Myograph System (Radnoti LLC) containing 5 ml of Krebs-Henseleit (KH) buffer in (mm): 118 NaCl, 4.75 KCl, 1.19 KH2PO4, 1.19 Mg2SO4, 2.54 CaCl2, 12.5 NaHCO3, 10.0 glucose, at 37 °C and oxygenated with 95%O2 and 5%CO2. The rings were stretched to a tension of 0.5 g to simulate normal transmural pressure. Rings were maintained at this tension as they equilibrated for 90 min. To test ring viability, 100 mm KCl was added to the baths. After contractions reached a plateau, rings were washed with KH until reaching a 0.5-g base-line tension. To empty stores, rings were challenged with phenylephrine (1 μm). At the contraction plateau, KH in baths was replaced with 5 ml of a modified Ca2+-free Krebs buffer and containing thapsigargin (TG) (2 μm) and verapamil (10 μm) to inhibit store refilling and L-type channels. respectively. Upon achieving base-line tension, the Ca2+-free buffer was replaced with 5 ml of KH containing Ca2+. At the peak of contraction, KH in baths was replaced with 5 ml of KH containing verapamil, sodium dithionite (1 mm) gassed with 95% N2, 5% CO2. The same solution was gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 to reverse hypoxia. A7r5 cells were grown in 12-well plates and treated with dithionite for 5min (n = 4). Samples were prepared using the CellTiter-Glo® luminescent cell viability assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. ATP levels (luminescence) were measured in a 96-farad nontreated white microwell plate (Nunc) using VICTOR X5 2030 Multilabel reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Acute responses to hypoxia are observed in airway and systemic vascular smooth muscle cells, with hypoxia rapidly inducing relaxation of both cell types, which is physiologically important in promoting oxygen movement into tissues (27Thorne G.D. Ishida Y. Paul R.J. Cell Calcium. 2004; 36: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Evidence indicates that hypoxia-induced relaxation is mediated by decreased Ca2+ entry, and in some vascular smooth muscle cells diminished O2 inhibits the function of L-type Ca2+ channels (17Shimoda L.A. Polak J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2011; 300: C951-C967Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 28Smani T. Hernández A. Ureña J. Castellano A.G. Franco-Obregón A. Ordoñez A. López-Barneo J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 53: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which hypoxia modifies Ca2+ entry is unknown (17Shimoda L.A. Polak J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2011; 300: C951-C967Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Considering the powerful role of STIM proteins in controlling multiple Ca2+ entry channels (9Wang Y. Deng X. Mancarella S. Hendron E. Eguchi S. Soboloff J. Tang X.D. Gill D.L. Science. 2010; 330: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), we examined the actions of hypoxia on STIM-mediated Ca2+ signaling. Cultured hASMC perfused in Ca2+-free medium were treated with the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) pump blocker TG to deplete ER Ca2+ stores and activate STIM proteins (20Hewavitharana T. Deng X. Wang Y. Ritchie M.F. Girish G.V. Soboloff J. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26252-26262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Re-addition of extracellular Ca2+ revealed substantial store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), which was remarkably sensitive to acute hypoxic stress (Fig. 1A). Hypoxia was induced either by perfusion of low O2-containing media or using the O2 scavenger sodium dithionite (29Yuan X.J. Goldman W.F. Tod M.L. Rubin L.J. Blaustein M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: L116-L123PubMed Google Scholar). In cells perfused with hypoxic medium (30 min, 3% O2) for 2 min prior to Ca2+ addition, peak SOCE was reduced by ∼50% (49.6 ± 5.27%, n = 32, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1, A and B). With cells in which hypoxia was induced with 1 mm dithionite added 2 min before Ca2+ re-addition, the SOCE peak amplitude was reduced by almost 90% (87.2 ± 4.15%, n = 43, p < 0.05) compared with normoxic conditions (Fig. 1, A and B). Although Orai channels are known to be opened by activated STIM proteins, other channels are also modified by store-dependent STIM activation (1Deng X. Wang Y. Zhou Y. Soboloff J. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 22501-22505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 30Wang Y. Deng X. Hewavitharana T. Soboloff J. Gill D.L. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 2008; 35: 1127-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The presence of verapamil (10 μm) on the superfusate during these experiments ensured that the L-type channels did not contribute to the Ca2+ entry. To assess the specific function of Orai channels, hASMC were transfected with the powerful dominant negative Orai1 E106A-CFP mutant in which a crucial Ca2+ pore-forming acidic residue is replaced (31Gwack Y. Srikanth S. Feske S. Cruz-Guilloty F. Oh-hora M. Neems D.S. Hogan P.G. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16232-16243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 32Soboloff J.

This mutant almost completely inhibited SOCE (93.06 ± 3.15%, n = 6) (Fig. 1C). hASMC express all three Orai channel subtypes (33Peel S.E. Liu B. Hall I.P. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2008; 38: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and Orai1-E106A-CFP blocks each Orai subtype (34Lis A. Peinelt C. Beck A. Parvez S. Monteilh-Zoller M. Fleig A. Penner R. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 794-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) but has no effect on L-type or TRPC channels (9Wang Y. Deng X. Mancarella S. Hendron E. Eguchi S. Soboloff J. Tang X.D. Gill D.L. Science. 2010; 330: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The action of Orai1-E106A-CFP indicates that in hASMC virtually all Ca2+ entries induced by store emptying are mediated by Orai channels. Although the results suggested hypoxia altered Orai-mediated Ca2+ entry, the fura-2 measurements could not exclude effects on other Ca2+ handling processes. We therefore assessed whether hypoxia altered the inwardly rectifying Ca2+ entry current, ICRAC, specifically mediated by Orai channels (35Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). We measured ICRAC in voltage-clamped single hASMC during passive depletion of Ca2+ stores induced by intracellular BAPTA (9Wang Y. Deng X. Mancarella S. Hendron E. Eguchi S. Soboloff J. Tang X.D. Gill D.L. Science. 2010; 330: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). ICRAC developed and became maximal (peak of 1.66 ± 0.29 pA/picofarads, n = 5) within 3 min of break-in. The current was dependent on extracellular Ca2+, and the I/V relationship revealed the typical inwardly rectifying nature of the highly Ca2+-selective CRAC channel (Fig. 1D) with reversal potential of approximately +40 mV (35Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). Although small, the current was similar in magnitude to that observed in vascular smooth muscle cells (9Wang Y. Deng X. Mancarella S. Hendron E. Eguchi S. Soboloff J. Tang X.D. Gill D.L. Science. 2010; 330: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Addition of 1 mm sodium dithionite reduced the current by 58.8 ± 9.1% (n = 5, p < 0.05) without altering channel selectivity (Fig. 1, D and E). Dithionite is a powerful O2 scavenger substantially reducing molecular O2 (29Yuan X.J. Goldman W.F. Tod M.L. Rubin L.J. Blaustein M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: L116-L123PubMed Google Scholar); as a reducing agent, it can also release active oxygen species (29Yuan X.J. Goldman W.F. Tod M.L. R"

Because the quaternary structure of transmembrane proteins plays an essential role for their cellular trafficking and function, we investigated whether hOCT2 forms oligomeric complexes, and if so, which part of the transporter is involved in the oligomerization. A yeast 2-hybrid mating-based split-ubiquitin system (mbSUS), fluorescence resonance energy transfer, Western blot analysis, cross-linking experiments, immunofluorescence, and uptake measurements of the fluorescent organic cation 4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium were applied to human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells transfected with hOCT2 and partly also to freshly isolated human proximal tubules. The role of cysteines for oligomerization and trafficking of the transporter to the plasma membranes was investigated in cysteine mutants of hOCT2. hOCT2 formed oligomers both in the HEK293 expression system and in native human kidneys. The cysteines of the large extracellular loop are important to enable correct folding, oligomeric assembly, and plasma membrane insertion of hOCT2. Mutation of the first and the last cysteines of the loop at positions 51 and 143 abolished oligomer formation. Thus, the cysteines of the extracellular loop are important for correct trafficking of the transporter to the plasma membrane and for its oligomerization."
https://openalex.org/W2002296514,"In this study, we investigated for the first time the transcriptional response of the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae to fluctuating concentrations of arginine, an essential amino acid for this bacterium. By means of DNA microarray analyses, several operons and genes were found, the expression of which was affected by the concentration of arginine in the medium. Five of the identified operons were demonstrated to be directly repressed in the presence of high arginine concentrations via the concerted action of the ArgR-type regulators ArgR1 and AhrC. These ArgR1/AhrC targets encompass the putative amino acid transport genes artPQ, abpA, abpB, and aapA; the arginine biosynthetic genes argGH; and the virulence genes aliB and lmB/adcAII-phtD encoding an oligopeptide-binding lipoprotein and cell surface Zn(2+)-scavenging units, respectively. In addition, the data indicate that three of the amino acid transport genes encode an arginine ATP-binding cassette transporter unit required for efficient growth during arginine limitation. Instead of regulating arginine biosynthetic and catabolic genes as has been reported for other Gram-positive bacteria, our findings suggest that the physiological function of ArgR1/AhrC in S. pneumoniae is to ensure optimal uptake of arginine from the surrounding milieu."
https://openalex.org/W2077147310,"Nitrogen monoxide (NO) plays a role in the cytotoxic mechanisms of activated macrophages against tumor cells by inducing iron release. We showed that NO-mediated iron efflux from cells required glutathione (GSH) (Watts, R. N., and Richardson, D. R. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 4724-4732) and that the GSH-conjugate transporter, multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1), mediates this release potentially as a dinitrosyl-dithiol iron complex (DNIC; Watts, R. N., Hawkins, C., Ponka, P., and Richardson, D. R. (2006) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 103, 7670-7675). Recently, glutathione S-transferase P1-1 (GST P1-1) was shown to bind DNICs as dinitrosyl-diglutathionyl iron complexes. Considering this and that GSTs and MRP1 form an integrated detoxification unit with chemotherapeutics, we assessed whether these proteins coordinately regulate storage and transport of DNICs as long lived NO intermediates. Cells transfected with GSTP1 (but not GSTA1 or GSTM1) significantly decreased NO-mediated 59Fe release from cells. This NO-mediated 59Fe efflux and the effect of GST P1-1 on preventing this were observed with NO-generating agents and also in cells transfected with inducible nitric oxide synthase. Notably, 59Fe accumulated in cells within GST P1-1-containing fractions, indicating an alteration in intracellular 59Fe distribution. Furthermore, electron paramagnetic resonance studies showed that MCF7-VP cells transfected with GSTP1 contain significantly greater levels of a unique DNIC signal. These investigations indicate that GST P1-1 acts to sequester NO as DNICs, reducing their transport out of the cell by MRP1. Cell proliferation studies demonstrated the importance of the combined effect of GST P1-1 and MRP1 in protecting cells from the cytotoxic effects of NO. Thus, the DNIC storage function of GST P1-1 and ability of MRP1 to efflux DNICs are vital in protection against NO cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2092908769,"Schizosaccharomyces pombe Sre1 is a membrane-bound transcription factor that controls adaptation to hypoxia. Like its mammalian homolog, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP), Sre1 activation requires release from the membrane. However, in fission yeast, this release occurs through a strikingly different mechanism that requires the Golgi Dsc E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and the proteasome. The mechanistic details of Sre1 cleavage, including the link between the Dsc E3 ligase complex and proteasome, are not well understood. Here, we present results of a genetic selection designed to identify additional components required for Sre1 cleavage. From the selection, we identified two new components of the fission yeast SREBP pathway: Dsc5 and Cdc48. The AAA (ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities) ATPase Cdc48 and Dsc5, a ubiquitin regulatory X domain-containing protein, interact with known Dsc complex components and are required for SREBP cleavage. These findings provide a mechanistic link between the Dsc E3 ligase complex and the proteasome in SREBP cleavage and add to a growing list of similarities between the Dsc E3 ligase and membrane E3 ligases involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2166647983,"Here we demonstrate a new paradigm in redox signaling, whereby oxidants resulting from metabolic stress directly alter protein palmitoylation by oxidizing reactive cysteine thiolates. In mice fed a high-fat, high-sucrose diet and in cultured endothelial cells (ECs) treated with high palmitate and high glucose (HPHG), there was decreased HRas palmitoylation on Cys181/184 (61±24% decrease for cardiac tissue and 38±7.0% in ECs). This was due to oxidation of Cys181/184, detected using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI TOF)-TOF. Decrease in HRas palmitoylation affected its compartmentalization and Ras binding domain binding activity, with a shift from plasma membrane tethering to Golgi localization. Loss of plasma membrane-bound HRas decreased growth factor-stimulated ERK phosphorylation (84±8.6% decrease) and increased apoptotic signaling (24±6.5-fold increase) after HPHG treatment that was prevented by overexpressing wild-type but not C181/184S HRas. The essential role of HRas in metabolic stress was made evident by the similar effects of expressing an inactive dominant negative N17-HRas or a MEK inhibitor. Furthermore, the relevance of thiol oxidation was demonstrated by overexpressing manganese superoxide dismutase, which improved HRas palmitoylation and ERK phosphorylation, while lessening apoptosis in HPHG treated ECs.—Burgoyne, J.

HIV does not infect neurons, and the molecular mechanisms behind HIV-associated neurocognitive decline are not understood. There are several hypotheses to explain the development of dementia in HIV+ individuals, including neuroinflammation mediated by infected microglia and neuronal toxicity by HIV proteins. A key protein associated with the neurological complications of HIV, gp120, forms part of the viral envelope and can be found in the CSF of infected individuals. HIV-1-gp120 interacts with several receptors including CD4, CCR5, CXCR4, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). However, the role of nAChRs in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder has not been investigated. We studied the effects of gp120IIIB on the expression and function of the nicotinic receptor α7 (α7-nAChR). Our results show that gp120, through activation of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor, induces a functional up-regulation of α7-nAChRs. Because α7-nAChRs have a high permeability to Ca2+, we performed TUNEL staining to investigate the effects of receptor up-regulation on cell viability. Our data revealed an increase in cell death, which was blocked by the selective antagonist α-bungarotoxin. The in vitro data are supported by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, confirming a remarkable up-regulation of the α7-nAChR in gp120-transgenic mice brains. Specifically, α7-nAChR up-regulation is observed in mouse striatum, a region severely affected in HIV+ patients.

Nevertheless, in association with the existence of HAART treatment, which prolongs the life of HIV-infected individuals, there has been an increase to ∼30% in the number of individuals who develop a milder form of neurocognitive dysfunction known as minor cognitive-motor disorder, which is characterized by neurological deficits that do not interfere with everyday functioning (6Wong M.H.

Therefore, despite the reduction in HAND incidence, its prevalence is expected to increase due the improved care of HIV-infected patients. When evaluating the alterations in the incidence of HAND as a result of HAART, it is important to consider that of the ∼30 million HIV-infected individuals worldwide, only 2 million have access to HAART (1UNAIDS/WHO (2008) Report on Global AIDS EpidemicGoogle Scholar). In addition, HIV infection continues to be the most common cause of dementia in young adults in the United States (7Kaul M. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2009; 22: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 8Ghafouri M. Amini S. Khalili K. Sawaya B.E. Retrovirology. 2006; 3: 28Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This suggests that HAND will continue to be an important health care problem in the United States and worldwide.

The presence of neurological symptoms in HIV-infected patients is an interesting finding, considering that HIV does not infect neurons directly. The molecular mechanisms by which HIV infection leads to neurocognitive decline are not fully understood, but several hypotheses have emerged to explain the development of neurocognitive impairment in HIV+ individuals. Two potential mechanisms by which HIV infection could interfere with normal brain functioning are (i) chemokine-induced neuroinflammation mediated by infected macrophages/microglia and (ii) direct neuronal toxicity induced by soluble HIV proteins (9Mattson M.P. Haughey N.J. Nath A. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). HIV-1-gp120, a glycoprotein that forms part of the envelope of HIV-1 particles, can be found in the cerebrospinal fluid of HIV+ individuals, and it has been shown to have neurotoxic effects in cell cultures (9Mattson M.P.

HIV-1-gp120 interacts with several receptors found in the central nervous system (CNS), including CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4, as well as nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) (14Bracci L. Lozzi L. Rustici M. Neri P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev.

Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 74: 676-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest the potential involvement of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α7-nAChR in HIV neuropathology (17Conejero-Goldberg C. Davies P. Ulloa L. Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2008; 32: 693-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 18Giunta B. Ehrhart J. Townsend K. Sun N. Vendrame M. Shytle D. Tan J. Fernandez F. Brain Res.

Neuroimmune Pharmacol. 2008; 3: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar); however, the role that nAChRs may play in the development of HAND has not been investigated. For HIV-1 to infect cells, it must bind the CD4 receptor and either the CCR5 or CXCR4 co-receptor. Interestingly, during the course of infection, HIV-1 evolves from an M-tropic (CCR5-dependent) variant that primarily infects macrophages to a T-tropic (CXCR4-dependent) variant that primarily infects T cells (15Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar, 20Stalmeijer E.H. Van Rij R.P. Boeser-Nunninck B. Visser J.A. Naarding M.A. Schols D. Schuitemaker H. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2722-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The increase in HIV particles with tropism for CXCR4 receptor correlates with the development of HAND (20Stalmeijer E.H. Van Rij R.P. Boeser-Nunninck B. Visser J.A. Naarding M.A. Schols D. Schuitemaker H. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2722-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Nieves D.M. Plaud M. Wojna V. Skolasky R. Meléndez L.M. J. Neurovirol. 2007; 13: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that gp120 not only binds to CXCR4, but also activates its signaling pathway (22Missé D. Cerutti M. Noraz N. Jourdan P. Favero J. Devauchelle G. Yssel H. Taylor N. Veas F. Blood. 1999; 93: 2454-2462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CXCR4 activation by stromal cell-derived growth factor (SDF-1α), the endogenous agonist of CXCR4, has been shown to rapidly up-regulate the early growth response gene 1 (Egr-1), a transcription factor known to drive the expression of the α7-nAChR (23Luo Y. Lathia J. Mughal M. Mattson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24789-24800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 24Criado M. Domínguez del Toro E. Carrasco-Serrano C. Smillie F.I. Juíz J.M. Viniegra S. Ballesta J.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6554-6564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that SDF-1α is secreted by astrocytes during inflammation and is increased in response to macrophage activation by HIV infection (25Peng H. Erdmann N. Whitney N. Dou H. Gorantla S. Gendelman H.E. Ghorpade A. Zheng J. Glia. 2006; 54: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Consequently, we designed experiments to study the effects of gp120 on the expression and function of α7-nAChRs in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, which endogenously express α7-nAChRs and CXCR4 receptors (26Geminder H. Sagi-Assif O. Goldberg L. Meshel T. Rechavi G. Witz I.P. Ben-Baruch A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4747-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Our results show that CXCR4 activation, by gp120 or SDF-1α, leads to an increase in α7-nAChR activity that can culminate in cell death. In addition, Western blotting and quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirm up-regulation of α7-nAChR in transgenic mice expressing the HIV-gp120 gene. SH-SY5Y cells were grown in 4-well tissue culture slides (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY). Cell culture medium was removed, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed by incubation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min followed by incubation with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 10 min. The cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated α-bgtx (Invitrogen) 1:50 for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times with PBS, and coverslips were mounted with 90% glycerol and analyzed with an Axiovert 200M confocal microscope. Whole cell currents were measured in the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The bath solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4, ∼280 mosmol/kg. The pipette solution contained 145 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 7.2 mm K2HPO4, 2.8 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, ∼270 mosmol/kg. Pipettes were pulled from thick wall borosilicate glass (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) with a multistage P-87 Flaming-Brown micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, San Rafael, CA) and fire-polished. Pipette resistance was 2–4 megohms, and a 1–2% agar bridge with composition similar to the bath solution was utilized as the reference electrode. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Whole cell current traces were filtered at 2 kHz and acquired at 10 kHz. Currents were measured in response to a 1-s pulse of 500 μm acetylcholine (ACh) at a holding potential of −100 mV. Pulse generation, data collection, and analyses were carried out with Clampex 10.1 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). SH-SY5Y cells were grown on coverslips and treated with 0.15 nm gp120 overnight followed by incubation on nonsupplement medium with 10 μm Fluo4-AM for 30 min in the dark. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with acini buffer (120 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm MgSO4, 15 mm HEPES, 0.1% BSA, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4) for 3 min at 37 °C in the dark for de-esterification. Cells were then stimulated with 1 mm ACh for 1.5 min while exciting at a wavelength of 488 nm using an Argon/2 laser. Emission was acquired at 520 nm using a BP 500-550 filter on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Images were acquired in a time series of 180 frames at 0.5-s intervals for 90 s at 40× magnification. To calculate the maximal intensity (Fmax), incubation with 10 μm ionomicin in presence of 10 mm CaCl2 was performed. Ca2+ concentration was determined as described (27Navedo M.F. Amberg G.C. Nieves M. Molkentin J.D. Santana L.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 127: 611-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y cells were treated with gp120 (0.15 nm) overnight. Cell death was measured using the APO-BrdU TUNEL Assay kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions with slight modifications. All centrifugations steps were done at 6,000 rpm. In brief, all cells were detached, centrifuged for 6 min, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, and centrifuged for 6 min. Cells were then permeabilized with 70% ethanol for 24 h at −20 °C, centrifuged for 6 min, resuspended in wash buffer, and centrifuged again. Then, cells were incubated with labeling solution for 24 h at room temperature, washed with 1 ml of rinse buffer, and centrifuged. This step was followed by incubation with antibody staining solution for 1 h at room temperature. After this, cells were washed with PBS, mounted in glass slides, and visualized with an Axiovert 200M confocal microscope. Total RNA was isolated from SH-SY5Y cells or mouse brains using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The cDNA synthesis was carried out using 1 μg of total RNA with the iScriptTM cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCR experiments were done using the iQTM SYBR® Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) in a Mastercycler® ep realplex Thermal Cycler (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY). The following primer pairs were used: forward, 5′-GCTCCGGGACTCAACATG-3′ and reverse, 5-GGGATTGTAGTTCTTGACCAGC-3′ for CHRNA7; forward, 5′-AGCACCTTCAACCCTCA-3′ and reverse, 5′-AGTCGAGTGGTTTGGCT-3′ for EGR1; and forward, 5′-GCTCTCTGCTCCTCCTGTTC-3′ and reverse, 5′-GACTCCGACCTTCACCTTCC-3′ for GAPDH. Transgenic mice expressing the HIV-1 coat protein gp120 under the regulatory control of a modified murine glial fibrillary acidic protein gene were obtained from a previously established line (Toggas et al., Ref. 49Toggas S.M. Masliah E. Rockenstein E.M. Rall G.F. Abraham C.R. Mucke L. Nature. 1994; 367: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) and housed in clear plastic cages, maintained in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room on a 12-h light/dark cycle with food and water provided ad libitum. Animals from the background strain B6SJLF were used as control. Transgenic and wild-type (WT) mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and brains were placed on ice and dissected to separate the striatum and hippocampus. Pulverized tissue was transferred to 15-ml tubes containing cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 ml/g) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture. The sample was agitated for 30 s and incubated for 1 h at 4°C, shaking. Then, the sample was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and protein in the lysates was quantified with a BCA kit (Pierce). Samples containing 50 μg of total protein were loaded on a 4–20% linear gradient polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad), and electrophoresis was done at 100 mV for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Amersham Biosciences) at 100 mV for 1 h. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T (1×) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated with a polyclonal rabbit anti-α7-nAChR (1:1,000; Millipore), diluted in 5% skim milk, overnight at 4 °C, shaking. Three consecutive washes with TBS-T (5 min each) were done to eliminate excess antibody, and the membrane was incubated with an anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to HRP (1:5,000; Abcam) for 1 h at room temperature. Antibody binding was detected with the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences) and developed using BioMax MS film (Kodak). SH-SY5Y cells were grown in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic/antimicotic solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and treated for 24 h. Several compounds were used at various concentrations: gp120IIIB (Fitzgerald Industries International, Concord, MA), SDF-1α (EMD Chemicals, Inc., Gibbstown, NJ) at 0.3 μg/ml; AMD3100 (EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ) at 1 μm, where pretreatment was carried out 10 min before the addition of gp120 or SDF-1α; and α-bgtx (Invitrogen) at 1 μm, where pretreatment was carried out 10 min before the addition of gp120 or SDF-1α. To study the effects of gp120 on α7-nAChR expression, SH-SY5Y cells were treated with different concentrations of gp120. Alexa Fluor 488-α-bgtx was used to detect α7-nAChRs. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, cells treated with various concentrations of gp120 showed an increase in α-bgtx binding, consistent with higher levels of α7-nAChRs. To determine whether the increase in α-bgtx binding correlates with an increase in functional nAChRs, we measured currents in response to stimulation with 1 mm ACh using the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, cells treated with different concentrations of gp120 presented an increase in whole cell current density in response to ACh. These results show that gp120 treatment leads to an increase in functional α7-nAChRs. It has been shown that gp120 activates the chemokine receptor CXCR4, which is expressed in SH-SY5Y cells (10Bardi G. Sengupta R. Kahn M.Z. Patel J.P. Meucci O. J. Neurovirol. 2006; 12: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this receptor was involved in the gp120-induced up-regulation of α7-nAChRs on the basis of findings by Luo et al. (23Luo Y. Lathia J. Mughal M. Mattson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24789-24800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and Criado and del Toro (24Criado M. Domínguez del Toro E. Carrasco-Serrano C. Smillie F.I. Juíz J.M. Viniegra S. Ballesta J.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6554-6564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which showed that SDF-1α, the endogenous CXCR4 agonist, up-regulates Egr-1, a known transcription factor for the α7-nAChR. As shown in Fig. 2A, the CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100, prevented the increase in α-bgtx binding observed after treatment with gp120. Pretreatment with AMD3100 also prevented the gp120-induced increase in ACh-stimulated currents (Fig. 2B). These results reveal that CXCR4 activation by gp120 is necessary for the up-regulation of the α7-nAChR. On the basis of these findings, we proceeded to test whether activation of the CXCR4 receptor by its endogenous ligand, SDF-1, would have similar effects on α-bgtx binding and ACh-stimulated currents. Fig. 2B shows that SDF-1α treatment resulted in increased α-bgtx binding and ACh-stimulated currents, similar to what was observed after gp120 treatment. The α7-nAChR up-regulation can be prevented by the MEK inhibitor PD98059, suggesting that the effect of SDF1 requires activation of the MAP kinase pathway (supplemental Fig. S2). Of all the nicotinic receptors, the α7-nAChR has the highest permeability to Ca2+ ions (28McGehee D.S. Role L.W. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 521-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar, 29Séguéla P. Wadiche J. Dineley-Miller K. Dani J.A. Patrick J.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 596-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taking this fact into consideration, we decided to measure the intracellular Ca2+ concentration after stimulating SH-SY5Y cells with ACh. As shown in Fig. 3, control cells stimulated with ACh had an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ( [Ca2+]i) that peaked around 100 nm (supplemental Video S1). This increase in [Ca2+]i can be blocked by the addition of methyllycaconitine (supplemental Video S3), a selective antagonist for the α7-nAChR, suggesting its role in mediating this effect. In contrast, cells treated with gp120 (0.15 nm) had an increase in [Ca2+]i that peaked at around 1,100 nm (supplemental Video S2), 11 times more than the [Ca2+]i observed in control cells. Once more, this effect can be inhibited by addition of MLA (supplemental Video S4), confirming the involvement of the α7-nAChR in mediating the increase in [Ca2+]i.FIGURE 3Increased Ca2+ mobilization after gp120 treatment. Gp120 exposure that induced up-regulation of the α7-nAChR led to a remarkable Ca2+ mobilization in SH-SY5Y cells. Our data using confocal microscopy suggest that neuroblastoma cells exposed to gp120 (0.15 nm) reach a higher [Ca2+]i (1,179 ± 222.0 nm) (B) in response to ACh than do control cells (108.6 ± 9.2 nm) (A). The Ca2+ mobilization can be blocked by preincubation with methyllycaconitine, an antagonist of the α7-nAChR in gp120-treated (167.0 ± 48.0 nm) and control (51.7 ± 3.3 nm) cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When considering the effects of the increase in α7-nAChRs for cellular function, it is important to keep in mind that large increases in intracellular Ca2+ have been shown to induce cell death (30Mattson M.P. Chan S.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1041-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Moreover, treatment with gp120 has been shown to induce cell death in neuroblastoma cells (10Bardi G. Sengupta R. Kahn M.Z. Patel J.P. Meucci O. J. Neurovirol. 2006; 12: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To test the hypothesis that α7-nAChR up-regulation plays a role in the gp120-induced cell death observed in SH-SY5Y cells, we performed TUNEL staining after treatment with gp120 with and without the addition of α-bgtx, an α7-nAChR antagonist. Fig. 4 shows that antagonizing α7-nAChRs with α-bgtx reduced the percentage of cells undergoing cell death after treatment with gp120. These data suggest that increased activity of α7-nAChRs contributes to gp120-induced cell death. The experiments performed in SH-SY5Y cells suggest that CXCR4 activation by either gp120 or SDF-1 results in increased levels of functional α7-nAChRs. The CXCR4 receptor has been shown to activate the early growth response protein, Egr-1 (23Luo Y. Lathia J. Mughal M. Mattson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24789-24800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Egr-1, binds to the promoter region of the α7 gene and increases transcription (24Criado M. Domínguez del Toro E. Carrasco-Serrano C. Smillie F.I. Juíz J.M. Viniegra S. Ballesta J.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6554-6564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Nagavarapu U. Danthi S. Boyd R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16749-16757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Real-time PCR on SH-SY5Y cells treated with gp120 for different periods of time showed a fast and transient up-regulation of Egr-1 with a peak of 8.4-fold increase after 30 min. To test whether α7-nAChRs mRNA levels are increased after treatment with gp120, real-time PCR was performed using CHRNA7-specific primers. Fig. 5 shows that the transient up-regulation of Egr-1 was accompanied by an ∼4-fold increase in α7 mRNA levels that peaked 60 min after gp120 treatment. Consistently, increased α7-nAChR currents were observed as early as 1 h after gp120 treatment and persisted for at least 48 h (supplemental Fig. S1). Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting experiments showed that mRNA and protein levels of α7-nAChRs are increased in the CNS of gp120-transgenic mice (Fig. 5). However, the up-regulation of α7-nAChRs was observed in the striatum, a region affected in HAND patients, but not in the hippocampus (supplemental Fig. S3). Interestingly, the striatum expresses high levels of the CXCR4 receptor and, furthermore, the expression of this receptor is increased in HIV+ patients (32van der Meer P. Ulrich A.M. González-Scarano F. Lavi E. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 2000; 69: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These findings are in agreement with our data from SH-SY5Y cells, and previous studies that implicate the CXCR4 in gp120-induced neurotoxicity (33Zheng J. Thylin M.R. Ghorpade A. Xiong H. Persidsky Y. Cotter R. Niemann D. Che M. Zeng Y.C. Gelbard H.A. Shepard R.B. Swartz J.M. Gendelman H.E. J.

Biol. 1998; 8: 595-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have developed a model for gp120 neurotoxicity, in which activation of the CXCR4 receptor by gp120 or SDF1 leads to activation of the MAPK pathway, increased EGR1 levels, and up-regulation of α7-nAChRs that triggers cell death (Fig. 6). This model is supported by data showing that treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with gp120 results in higher expression of α7-nAChRs, which are highly permeable to Ca2+. Increased intracellular Ca2+ can lead to cell death and has been associated with neuronal death in neurodegenerative diseases (35Marambaud P. Dreses-Werringloer U. Vingtdeux V. Mol. Neurodegener. 2009; 4: 20Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Along these lines, overexpression of α7-nAChRs has been shown to play a role in neurological disorders (36Counts S.E. He B. Che S. Ikonomovic M.D. DeKosky S.T. Ginsberg S.D. Mufson E.J. Arch. Neurol. 2007; 64: 1771-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that in neuronal cultures, gp120 can induce an increase in Ca2+ levels, leading to neuronal injury, an effect that can be blocked with memantine (37Lipton S.A. Neurology. 1992; 42: 1403-1405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, besides being an antagonist for the NMDA receptor, memantine has been shown to also act as an antagonist of α7-nAChRs (38Aracava Y. Pereira E.F. Maelicke A. Albuquerque E.X. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 312: 1195-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Moreover, subsequent studies have shown involvement of CXCR4 in the neurotoxic effects of gp120 (38Aracava Y. Pereira E.F. Maelicke A. Albuquerque E.X. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 312: 1195-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These results suggest that other proteins, besides the NMDA receptor, contribute to gp120 neurotoxicity. TUNEL staining showed that exposure to gp120 increases cell death in SH-SY5Y cells, consistent with previous studies (37Lipton S.A. Neurology. 1992; 42: 1403-1405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Catani M.V. Corasaniti M.T. Navarra M. Nisticò G. Finazzi-Agrò A. Melino G. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2373-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Our experiments show that pretreatment with α-bgtx reduced the percentage of cells undergoing cell death after gp120 treatment. These data suggest that the gp120-induced up-regulation of functional α7-nAChRs may be detrimental to neurons and implicates the α7-nAChR as a potential key player in HIV pathogenesis. It is important to mention that desensitization of α7-nAChRs by chronic exposure to different agonists, such as nicotine, has been associated to receptor up-regulation and neuroprotection (40Jonnala R.R. Buccafusco J.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 66: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 41De Rosa M.J. Esandi Mdel C. Garelli A. Rayes D. Bouzat C. J. Neuroimmunol. 2005; 160: 154-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This scenario differs from the gp120-induced α7-nAChR up-regulation and toxicity in that the observed gp120 effects involve activation of the CXCR4 receptor. It is conceivable that chronic nicotine exposure leads to an increase in α7-nAChRs to compensate for the reduced receptor activity due to desensitization. In contrast, our data suggest that gp120 activates CXCR4 receptors, leading to an increase in functional α7-nAChRs without involving desensitization. Whereas small influxes in Ca2+ associated with tonic small levels of activation of α7-nAChRs might be neuroprotective, large influxes of Ca2+ as consequence of receptor up-regulation appear to be cytotoxic (42Johnson Jr., E.M. Koike T. Franklin J. Exp. Neurol. 1992; 115: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 43Uteshev V.V. Meyer E.M. Papke R.L. Brain Res. 2002; 948: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Many studies have shown that gp120 binding to the CXCR4 or CCR5 receptors elicits intracellular responses that include the activation of the MAPK pathway, transcription factors, and ion channels (32van der Meer P. Ulrich A.M. González-Scarano F. Lavi E. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 2000; 69: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 44Liu Q.H. Williams D.A. McManus C. Baribaud F. Doms R.W. Schols D.

Blood. 2001; 98: 2909-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In the course of HIV infection, the virus exhibits changes in its tropism: from an R5 variant to an X4 variant (15Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). By the time HIV-1 becomes capable of infecting cells through the use of the CXCR4, there is an associated CD4 cell decline and disease progression (20Stalmeijer E.H. Van Rij R.P. Boeser-Nunninck B. Visser J.A. Naarding M.A. Schols D. Schuitemaker H. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2722-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This rapid decrease in CD4 cell count associated with CXCR4 tropism couples with an increased risk of developing HAND (18Giunta B. Ehrhart J. Townsend K. Sun N. Vendrame M. Shytle D. Tan J. Fernandez F. Brain Res. Bull. 2004; 64: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This correlates with the fact that hippocampal and basal ganglia neurons express CXCR4 but not CCR5, which is present in glial cells (32van der Meer P. Ulrich A.M. González-Scarano F. Lavi E. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 2000; 69: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that activation of CCR5 can lead to cell death in the presence of gp120 (51Kaul M. Ma Q. Medders K.E. Desai M.K. Lipton S.A. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 296-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar); however, our experiments show that gp120IIIB as well as SDF-1α, both specific to CXCR4, induce an up-regulation of the α7-nAChR. Moreover, this effect is abolished by pretreatment with the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100, ruling out the contribution of CCR5 in our experimental setting. These results show that CXCR4 activation is necessary for the up-regulation of α7-nAChRs, and CXCR4-expressing neurons would be more susceptible to the effects of HIV infection. CXCR4 activates the MAPK pathway, and its activation by SDF-1α induces the up-regulation of Egr-1, a transcription factor capable of stimulating the expression of the α7 gene (CHRNA7) (23Luo Y. Lathia J. Mughal M. Mattson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24789-24800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 24Criado M. Domínguez del Toro E. Carrasco-Serrano C. Smillie F.I. Juíz J.M. Viniegra S. Ballesta J.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6554-6564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our experiments show that treating SH-SY5Y cells with SDF-1α induced a functional up-regulation of α7-nAChRs, as seen by increased α-bgtx binding and larger ACh-stimulated whole cell currents. Furthermore, quantitative RT-PCR experiments showed that gp120 and SDF-1α treatment of SH-SY5Y cells induced a rapid and transient increase in Egr-1 mRNA expression levels concomitant with an increase in α7-nAChRs mRNA expression levels. Together, these results provide a molecular mechanism as to how the α7-nAChR could be up-regulated in neurons in the context of an HIV-infected CNS. In HAND, the sustained immune response can produce neuronal injury despite viral control (47Woods S.P. Moore D.J. Weber E. Grant I. Neuropsychol. Rev. 2009; 19: 152-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). In the brain, viral particles such as gp120 can cause macrophages and/or astrocytes to release various cytokines and chemokines (nitric oxide, TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1), resulting in further neuronal stress and cell death. Production of IL-1 by astrocytes leads to an increase in SDF-1 (25Peng H. Erdmann N. Whitney N. Dou H. Gorantla S. Gendelman H.E. Ghorpade A. Zheng J. Glia. 2006; 54: 619-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The α7-nAChR has been shown to contribute to the regulation of inflammation in macrophages (the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway); however, the sustained immune response and increased production of SDF-1 could cause alterations in α7-nAChR function. Immune responses depend on the equilibrium between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and alterations of this equilibrium could convert a beneficial inflammatory response into a pathologic process (48Tyagi E. Agrawal R. Nath C. Shukla R. Innate Immun. 2010; 16: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this context, gp120 and SDF-1 could have synergistic effects, leading to up-regulation of the α7-nAChR and subsequent neuronal death. Interestingly, a similar up-regulation of α7-nAChR has been observed in macrophages derived from HIV+ donors, 5L. Y. Ballester, C. M. Capó-Vélez, W. F. García-Beltrán, F. M. Ramos, E. Vázquez-Rosa, R. Ríos, J. R. Mercado, R. I. Meléndez, and J. A. Lasalde-Dominicci, unpublished data. but the implications of these findings for macrophage function and inflammation remain to be explored. To validate our results in an in vivo model, we used transgenic mice that express HIV-gp120 under the glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter. HIV-gp120 has been shown to induce neuropathological changes in mice similar to those seen in HAND patients (49Toggas S.M. Masliah E. Rockenstein E.M. Rall G.F. Abraham C.R. Mucke L. Nature. 1994; 367: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 50D'Hooge R. Franck F. Mucke L. De Deyn P.P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 4398-4402Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), making it a suitable model to study gp120-mediated neurotoxicity. Consistent with the results from in vitro experiments, we observed that α7-nAChR mRNA and protein levels are increased in the CNS of gp120-transgenic mice. However, the α7-nAChR up-regulation appears to be restricted to the striatum, a component of the basal ganglia and a region greatly affected in HAND patients (47Woods S.P. Moore D.J. Weber E. Grant I. Neuropsychol. Rev. 2009; 19: 152-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Our results are in agreement with experiments performed by Kaul et al. (51Kaul M. Ma Q. Medders K.E. Desai M.K. Lipton S.A. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 296-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) showing that gp120IIIB and SDF-1 are neurotoxic only in the presence of the CXCR4 receptor. In these experiments it was shown that inhibiting p38 prevented the gp120 and SDF-1 neurotoxicity. Interestingly, it has been shown that induction of Egr-1 requires p38 activity (52Kenzel S. Santos-Sierra S. Deshmukh S.D. Moller I. Ergin B. Fitzgerald K.A. Lien E. Akira S. Golenbock D.T. Henneke P. Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 2474-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These data, in conjunction with our results, suggest the existence of a neurotoxic pathway in which CXCR4 activation leads to a p38-dependent Egr-1 induction that increases α7-nAChR expression levels and causes cell death. In conclusion, our experiments suggest that the α7-nAChR is a previously unrecognized contributor to HIV neurotoxicity. Drugs that antagonize the CXCR4 or α7-nACh receptors might be of therapeutic benefit in the treatment of HAND. Download .zip (4.76 MB) Help with zip files"
https://openalex.org/W2047219711,"The two major isoforms of human APP, APP695 and APP751, differ by the presence of a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (KPI) domain in the extracellular region. APP processing and function is thought to be regulated by homodimerization. We used bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) to study dimerization of different APP isoforms and mutants. APP751 was found to form significantly more homodimers than APP695. Mutation of dimerization motifs in the TM domain did not affect fluorescence complementation, but native folding of KPI is critical for APP751 homodimerization. APP751 and APP695 dimers were mostly localized at steady state in the Golgi region, suggesting that most of the APP751 and 695 dimers are in the secretory pathway. Mutation of the KPI led to the retention of the APP homodimers in the endoplasmic reticulum. We finally showed that APP751 is more efficiently processed through the nonamyloidogenic pathway than APP695. These findings provide new insight on the particular role of KPI domain in APP dimerization. The correlation observed between dimerization, subcellular localization, and processing suggests that dimerization acts as an efficient regulator of APP trafficking in the secretory compartments that has major consequences on its processing.—Ben Khalifa, N., Tyteca, D., Marinangeli, C., Depuydt, M., Collet, J.-F., Courtoy, P.

Some of these proteins make up the thin filament, a multimeric structure that performs both calcium-dependent and -independent roles in muscle contractility (6Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar, 7Tardiff J.C. Circ. Res. 2011; 108: 765-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Within the thin filament, troponin I (TnI), troponin C (TnC), and troponin T (TnT) form the troponin (Tn) complex, which is responsible for switching on contraction and propagating the calcium-induced signal to the rest of the thin filament (6Gordon A.M.

On calcium binding to Tn, a series of allosteric conformational changes occur, including the release of TnI inhibition, which promotes the interaction between actin and myosin required to generate force (9Perry S.V. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 190: 9-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Through the in vitro investigation of over 100 thick and thin filament mutations, it has become evident that the manifestation of pathological cardiomyopathies involves many complex processes such that these mutations intricately alter the calcium regulation of actomyosin-ATPase activity (7Tardiff J.C.

Notably, cardiac TnI (cTnI) is different from the fast and slow skeletal TnI isoforms because it has an additional ∼30 amino acids in its N terminus (9Perry S.V. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 190: 9-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Day S.M. Westfall M.V. Metzger J.M. J. Mol. Med. 2007; 85: 911-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 12Layland J. Solaro R.J. Shah A.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 66: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The recent emergence of >60% of the crystal structure of cardiac Tn (cTn) has revealed and confirmed how the many subunit interactions join together to make up the cTn core domain (13Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maéda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Despite these advances, there is a lack of information in the literature pertaining to the structure of the cTnI N-terminal extension. Specifically, this portion of cTnI has not been resolved in structural studies due to its predicted flexibility (13Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maéda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Within this N-terminal extension, two serines are present at positions 23 and 24 (including the initial methionine) that upon β-adrenergic stimulation of the heart, protein kinase A (PKA) becomes activated and phosphorylates them (14Kranias E.G. Solaro R.J. Nature. 1982; 298: 182-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The N-terminal extension of cTnI has several biological functions that serve to maintain cardiac physiology under low and high demands of adrenergic stimulation. Deletion of cTnI residues 2–26 in a transgenic mouse model facilitated the diastolic and systolic functions of both young and aged hearts (15Barbato J.C. Huang Q.Q. Hossain M.M. Bond M. Jin J.P. J.

Furthermore, it has been shown that phosphorylation within the cTnI N-terminal extension: 1) increases the rate of relaxation and cross-bridge cycling kinetics (17Kentish J.C. McCloskey D.T.

Res. 1995; 76: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Altogether, these reports indicate that a major role for the cTnI N-terminal extension is to assist in the lusitropic effects of cardiac muscle relaxation (14Kranias E.G. Solaro R.J. Nature. 1982; 298: 182-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Approximately 35 mutations in cTnI have been associated with hypertrophic, dilated, and restrictive cardiomyopathies (21Chang A.N. Parvatiyar M.S. Potter J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 369: 74-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Among these, the R21C mutation is the only identified HCM-associated mutation located within the N-terminal extension of cTnI (22Arad M. Penas-Lado M. Monserrat L. Maron B.J. Sherrid M. Ho C.Y. Barr S. Karim A. Olson T.M. Kamisago M. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. Circulation. 2005; 112: 2805-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). A significant aspect of this mutation is that it is located within a PKA substrate consensus sequence (RRRSS) (23Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous in vitro studies showed that the R21C cTnI mutation reduced the level of PKA-mediated cTnI phosphorylation in reconstituted skinned fibers and curtails the well characterized decrease in the Ca2+ sensitivity of contraction associated with cTnI phosphorylation (24Gomes A.V. Harada K. Potter J.D. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2005; 39: 754-765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, our focus shifted on generating and characterizing heterozygous and homozygous R21C cTnI knock-in (KI) mouse models in which one could investigate how the availability of phosphorylated cTnI contributes to the HCM phenotype. In a series of biochemical and proteomic assays, we investigated the ratio of mutant to wild-type cTnI protein incorporated into the mouse myofilament and their corresponding basal levels of phosphorylated cTnI. Irrespective of the mutant gene dosage, both the heterozygous (R21C+/−) and homozygous (R21C+/+) KI mice developed the HCM phenotype as evidenced by the presence of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Our results suggest that under circumstances where β-adrenergic stimulation occurs, limiting the lusitropic effects via the incomplete phosphorylation of cTnI may play a role in the development of the cardiac hypertrophic response. A genomic clone including the entire murine TNNI3 was isolated from the mouse 129/sv genomic library (Stratagene). To construct the targeting vector (Fig. 1), two separate gene fragments were subcloned into two pBluescript II KS(+) vectors (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA): 1) the ClaI/XhoI 2.1-kb fragment containing exons 1–3 was used to generate the R/C mutation at codon 21. The mutation was introduced into a HindII/XhoI subclone containing exons 1–3 using the four-pair oligonucleotide PCR mutagenesis method. The sense oligonucleotide (5′-TGTCCGATGCCGCTCCTCTGCCAACTAC-3′) and antisense oligonucleotide (5′-AGTTGGCAGAGGAGCAGCGTCGGACAGGA-3′) contained the mutation (underlined) and the T7 and T3 primers were from the vector flanks. The PCR product was digested with HindII/XhoI to replace the same fragment in subclone 1. 2) The 4.8-kb XhoI/HindIII fragment encompasses exons 4–8. The targeting construct was generated in the vector Osdupdel, which contains MCI neo flanked by loxP and thymidine kinase (tk) under control of 3′-phosphoglycerate kinase (a gift from O. Smithies, University of North Carolina) by ligating the ClaI/XhoI fragment from plasmid 1 into the targeting vector downstream from the neo gene to form a 5′ homology region. The XhoI/HindIII fragment from plasmid 2 was ligated to the targeting vector between the neo and tk genes to form the 3′ homology region. The transcriptional orientation of TNNI3 and neo are opposite in this targeting vector. Thirty micrograms of the NotI linearized construct was electroporated into Tc1 embryonic stem (ES) cells (25Deng C. Wynshaw-Boris A. Zhou F. Kuo A. Leder P. Cell. 1996; 84: 911-921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 26Wang Y. Szczesna-Cordary D. Craig R. Diaz-Perez Z. Guzman G. Miller T. Potter J.D. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 2205-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Culture and selection of recombinant ES clones were performed as described previously (27Wang Y. Spatz M.K. Kannan K. Hayk H. Avivi A. Gorivodsky M. Pines M. Yayon A. Lonai P. Givol D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 4455-4460Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Recombinant ES clones were screened by PCR with a 5′ primer located upstream of the ClaI site, which is located externally of the construct; and a 3′ primer from the neo gene, which amplifies a 2.5-kb fragment. Clones deemed positive by PCR were confirmed by Southern blot by digesting the DNA with SacI and probing it with 5′ and neo probes (see Fig. 1). This analysis was also verified with HindIII-digested DNA using a 3′ probe (Fig. 1). The same analyses were also used for the screening of heterozygous and homozygous mice. Three independent ES cell clones that carried the homologous recombinant construct were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts. Male progeny with a high percentage of coat color chimerism were bred to C57BL/6 females to establish germ line transmission. Heterozygous mice were mated with CMV-Cre transgenic mice to delete the neo marker. The mouse genotypes were identified by PCR utilizing a pair of primers (P1 and P2) flanking the neo cassette (Fig. 1). Hearts were removed from the progeny and total RNA was extracted by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 15 μg of RNA were loaded onto a 1.0% agarose gel. After transfer, the blot was serially hybridized to probes, which were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by using the Rediprimer labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). After each hybridization, the bound probe was removed by washing the blot with a boiling solution of 0.15 m NaCl, 0.15 m sodium citrate, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.0 (1× SSC, 0.1% SDS). Removal of the probes was confirmed before performing the next hybridization. To confirm the removal of the neo cassette in the neo recombinant allele, a fragment was amplified from the DNA of mouse tails by PCR using a pair of primers (5′-CTGAGCGTAGTGGTTAGCAGTGA and 5′-ACTGCGACCTCATCTACACCTTCAACTG) flanking the cTnI region in which the neo cassette was inserted. The PCR program was as follows: 1 cycle of 94 °C for 3 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 90 s followed by one cycle of 72 °C for 5 min. Total RNA was extracted from heart tissue using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA from mouse ventricular tissue utilizing the OmniScript® RT Kit (Qiagen). Primers sets were designed from mouse cDNA sequences as follows: 5′-ATGGGCTCCTTCTCCATCA-3′ and 5′-AATGTGACCAAGCTGGTGAC-3 for atrial natriuretic peptide; 5′-ATGGATCTCCTGAAGGTGCT-3′ and 5′-AAGAGGGCAGATCTATCGGA-3′ for brain natriuretic peptide; 5′-CTGCTGCAGAGGTTATTCCTCG-3′ and 5′-GGAAGAGTGAGCGGCGCATCAAGG-3′ for α-myosin heavy chain (α-MHC); 5′-TGCAAAGGCTCCAGGTCTGAGGGC-3′ and 5′-GCCAACACCAACCTGTCCAAGTTC-3′ for β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC); 5′-GCTTCACCACCTTCTTG-3′ and 5′-TCACCATCTTCCAGGAG-3′ for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Enriched myofibrillar proteins were isolated using F60 buffer (60 mm KCl, 30 mm imidazole, 7.2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures (Roche Diagnostics, catalog numbers 11836153001 and 05892791001) as previously described (28Fewell J.G. Hewett T.E. Sanbe A. Klevitsky R. Hayes E. Warshaw D. Maughan D. Robbins J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2630-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). 20 μg of myofibrils were loaded onto a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and phosphorylated proteins were detected with the Molecular Probes Pro-Q Diamond phosphoprotein gel stain reagent (Invitrogen, catalog number P-33301) as described in the manufacturer's manual. The total protein was further detected in the same gel using SYPRO Ruby staining. A transilluminator was then used to view and photograph the gel. After running on a 15% SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF) and then incubated with antibodies: 22B11 (Research Diagnostics Inc., anti-cTnI specific for cTnI that is dephosphorylated at both Ser23 and Ser24), mAb14 (MMS-4182, from Covance, CA, anti-cTnI, which detects cTnI that is phosphorylated at Ser24 independent of Ser23 phosphorylation status), and 6F9 (Research Diagnostics Inc., anti-cTnI raised against residues 189–195, which detects the total cTnI irrespective of Ser23/Ser24 phosphorylation status). Immunoreactivity was detected using goat anti-mouse IgG labeled with Alexa 680 fluorophore (Rockland) at 1:2000 dilution. The reaction signal was developed and detected with an Odyssey Infrared imager (LI-COR). Freshly isolated myofibrils were incubated for 30 or 60 min at 30 °C in 100 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ATP, and 0.5 units/μl of the PKA catalytic subunit (Sigma, catalog number P2645). The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli loading buffer (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206977) Google Scholar) and boiled for 5 min. PKA inhibitor PKI 6–22 (Amide; Calbiochem) was used for control studies. The reaction contained 2 μg of myofibrils, which were used for Western blot analysis. The troponin complex was purified from Triton X-100-skinned myofibrils by using affinity chromatography as described previously (30Sancho Solis R. Ge Y. Walker J.W. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2008; 29: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, frozen mouse ventricular tissue (propranolol treated as below) was partially thawed, minced with a razor blade, and homogenized at maximum speed in a Polytron for 4–6 s in ice-cold relaxing solution (100 mm KCl, 10 mm imidazole (pH 7.0), 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm ATP, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm benzamidine, and 0.75 mg/ml of protease inhibitor mixture). The homogenized tissue was centrifuged at 500 × g (2 min) and the pellet was resuspended in 5 volumes of 0.33% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml of BSA for 4 min at room temperature. This was followed by rinsing the pellet twice in relaxing solution to remove Triton X-100 and then incubating it for 1 h at 4 °C in extraction solution (0.7 m LiCl, 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and 0.75 mg/ml of protease inhibitor mixture). Troponin was affinity purified from the supernatant using Sepharose CL-4B-conjugated MF4 anti-cTnI monoclonal antibody (Hytest, Finland) after centrifugation of the extract at 10,000 × g for 45 min to remove cell debris. Bound troponin was eluted from the affinity resin with 50 mm glycine (pH 2) (adjusted with HCl), neutralized with MOPS (pH 9.0) buffer, and desalted on a C18 protein microtrap (Michrom Bioresources, Inc.). Top-down mass spectrometry (TDMS) was performed on a 7-tesla LTQ-FT-ICR Ultra (Thermo Scientific Inc., Bremen, Germany). Samples were introduced with a Triversa NanoMate (Advion BioSciences, Ithaca, NY) into the ESI source with a spray voltage of 1.4–1.6 kV and flow rate of 50–100 nl/min. Resolving power on the mass analyzer was set to 200,000 and acquisition scan rate of 1 scan/s. Data were analyzed with Manual Xtract and Xcalibur software (Thermo Scientific) based on the mouse cTnI protein sequence obtained from the Swiss-Prot database (accession number P48787). Reported Mr values are the most abundant masses. Further details on mass spectrometry analysis can be found in Refs. 30Sancho Solis R. Ge Y. Walker J.W. J. Muscle Res.

Heart/body weight was first measured to determine whether hypertrophy had occurred. The hearts were fixed in 10% formalin overnight or longer at 4 °C, then embedded and stained with hematoxylin-eosin or Masson trichrome. Light microscopic images were recorded digitally with an Axiovert 200 microscope (10 × 40). Wild-type, heterozygous mutant (R21C+/−), and homozygous mutant (R21C+/+) animals were age matched for all studies. The mice were sacrificed using two different protocols approved by the animal care and use committee (IACUC) at the University of Miami. The mice were exposed to CO2 followed by cervical dislocation; or they were first anesthetized with isoflurane, then injected intravenously with propranolol (1 mg/kg body weight, Calbiochem, catalog number 537075), and 30 min later were given another exposure to isoflurane before cervical dislocation. The hearts were excised, and the left ventricles were dissected. Cardiac muscle fibers were prepared and mounted following a standard laboratory procedure (32Baudenbacher F. Schober T. Pinto J.R. Sidorov V.Y. Hilliard F. Solaro R.J. Potter J.D. Knollmann B.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 3893-3903PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca2+ dependence of force development and maximal force were determined before and after a 30-min PKA incubation according to Baudenbacher et al. (32Baudenbacher F. Schober T. Pinto J.R.

One-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett or Student-Newman-Keuls tests was used to determine the significance between groups. The R21C cTnI mutant mice were generated using a knock-out/knock-in strategy (26Wang Y. Szczesna-Cordary D. Craig R. Diaz-Perez Z. Guzman G. Miller T. Potter J.D. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 2205-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 27Wang Y. Spatz M.K. Kannan K. Hayk H. Avivi A. Gorivodsky M. Pines M. Yayon A. Lonai P. Givol D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Fig. 1A illustrates the gene targeting strategy used to generate a C to T point mutation in the TNNI3 gene, which corresponds to changing Arg (CGC) in codon 21 of exon 3 to Cys (TGC). The point mutation was introduced into a targeting construct containing a floxed neo cassette within intron 3. Other than this mutation, the coding sequence in the construct including the entire 8 exons of the TNNI3 gene was unchanged. The targeting construct was linearized with NotI and electroporated into 129/SV-derived Tc1 embryonic stem cells. The recombinant ES cell clone cultivation and selection were performed as described in the literature (26Wang Y. Szczesna-Cordary D. Craig R. Diaz-Perez Z. Guzman G. Miller T. Potter J.D. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 2205-2214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 27Wang Y. Spatz M.K. Kannan K. Hayk H. Avivi A. Gorivodsky M. Pines M. Yayon A. Lonai P. Givol D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 4455-4460Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The positive ES clones containing the R21C+/− mutation in the TNNI3 gene were first characterized by digesting ES cell-derived DNA with SacI and probing it with 5′ TNNI3 and neo probes; and then confirmed using a 3′ probe against HindIII-digested DNA (Fig. 1B). Because a 1.2-kb neo cassette was inserted into intron 3 of the TNNI3 gene, the mutant allele generated a band that is 1.2 kb larger than the wild-type allele when digested by either SacI or HindIII. Two independent R21C+/− positive ES clones were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts to produce male chimeras. These males were mated with C57BL/6 females to obtain heterozygotes (i.e. one allele carrying the R21C mutation and the neo cassette, referred here as neo+/−), and cross-mating inter-heterozygous neo+/− mice resulted in the generation of homozygotes (i.e. both alleles carrying the R21C mutation and neo cassette, referred to here as neo+/+). The neo+/− and neo+/+ mice were identified by Southern blots of tail DNA using the same panel of digestion enzymes and probes as described for screening the recombinant ES cells (Fig. 1C). The phenotypes of TNNI3-targeted mice from the two independently derived ES clones were identical. Deletion of the neo cassette was performed by mating neo+/− mice to CMV-Cre “deleter” transgenic mice, which resulted in the R21C cTnI heterozygous mutant (i.e. one allele carrying the R21C mutation without the neo cassette, referred here as R21C+/−), and cross-mating inter-heterozygous R21C+/− mice resulted in the generation of R21C homozygous mice (i.e. both alleles carrying the R21C mutation without the neo cassette, referred to as R21C+/+). Upon activation of the Cre recombinase, the neo cassette was expected to be removed and leave a single loxP site (33 bp in length) within the targeted allele. Fig. 1D shows the amplification products from tail DNA by PCR using the P1 and P2 primer pair (see Fig. 1A) that flank the neo cassette within intron 3 of the TNNI3 gene. Analysis of the amplification products yields a 1683-nucleotide band for the neo containing allele, a 250-nucleotide band for the wild-type allele, and a 283-nucleotide band for the neo-deleted allele. As anticipated, sequencing the DNA of R21C+/+ cTnI mice in the region adjoining the 5′ and 3′ homology region of the construct revealed that a single loxP sequence (33 bp) remained after Cre/loxP recombination (Fig. 1D, lanes 3 and 5). Sequencing the cTnI mRNA extracted from R21C+/+ mouse hearts confirmed that it was identical to the wild-type mRNA with the exception of the C-T mutation at codon 21. The phenotype of the neo+/− mice was indistinguishable from the wild-type mice; whereas, the neo+/+ mice exhibited a lethal phenotype that is very similar to the previously reported targeted loss-of-function mutation in cTnI (33Huang X. Pi Y. Lee K.J. Henkel A.S. Gregg R.G. Powers P.A. Walker J.W. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The neo+/+ mice were born healthy with morphologically normal hearts; however, they all died of acute heart failure 18–20 days after birth. Northern and Western blot analysis revealed that these mice lacked the expression of cTnI mRNA and protein in the heart (data not shown). The deletion of the neo cassette by mating the neo+/− mice with CMV-Cre transgenic mice generated the R21C+/− and R21C+/+ mice. The R21C+/+ mice displayed a new distinctive phenotype compared with the neo+/+ mice because they were viable, fertile, and lived at least 18 months. These results suggest that the neo cassette interfered with proper splicing of the cTnI transcript from the recombined gene. However, subsequent removal of the neo cassette from the recombined gene resulted in the lethal phenotype to be rescued and the distinctive HCM phenotype to predominate in the R21C+/+ mutant mice when aged greater than 12 months. One of the limitations of this work was the use of an animal with a mixed background. The R21C mutant and WT mice were generated from crossing 129/sv mice with C57BL/6 mice. Recently it was reported that the C57BL/6J strain can maintain cardiac function better than most of the inbred strains after ex vivo ischemia, including 129/sv. However, during in vivo acute hypoxia, the 129/sv mice maintained close to normal cardiac function, whereas the C57BL/6J animals showed dramatic cardiac decompensation (34Barnabei M.S. Palpant N.J."
https://openalex.org/W1981670120,"Clinical, pharmacological, biochemical, and genetic evidence support the notion that alteration of cholesterol homeostasis strongly predisposes to Alzheimer disease (AD). The ATP-binding cassette transporter-2 (Abca2), which plays a role in intracellular sterol trafficking, has been genetically linked to AD. It is unclear how these two processes are related. Here we demonstrate that down-regulation of Abca2 in mammalian cells leads to decreased amyloid-β (Aβ) generation. In vitro studies revealed altered γ-secretase complex formation in Abca2 knock-out cells due to the altered levels, post-translational modification, and subcellular localization of Nicastrin. Reduced Abca2 levels in mammalian cells in vitro, in Drosophila melanogaster and in mice resulted in altered γ-secretase processing of APP, and thus Aβ generation, without affecting Notch cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W2022051492,"Background Although it has been widely accepted that global changes will pose the most important constrains to plant survival and distribution, our knowledge of the adaptive mechanism for plant with large-scale environmental changes (e.g. drought and high temperature) remains limited. Methodology/Principal findings An experiment was conducted to examine anatomical and physiological plasticity in Leymus chinensis along a large-scale geographical gradient from 115° to 124°E in northeast China. Ten sites selected for plant sampling at the gradient have approximately theoretical radiation, but differ in precipitation and elevation. The significantly increasing in leaf thickness, leaf mass per area, vessel and vascular diameters, and decreasing in stoma density and stoma index exhibited more obvious xerophil-liked traits for the species from the moist meadow grassland sites in contrast to that from the dry steppe and desert sites. Significant increase in proline and soluble sugar accumulation, K+/Na+ for the species with the increasing of stresses along the gradient showed that osmotic adjustment was enhanced. Conclusion/Significance Obvious xerophytic anatomical traits and stronger osmotic adjustment in stress conditions suggested that the plants have much more anatomical and physiological flexibilities than those in non-stress habitats along the large-scale gradient."

Aberrant PTK6 expression and intracellular localization have been detected in human prostate tumors. In the PC3 prostate cancer cell line, the pool of endogenous activated PTK6, which is phosphorylated on tyrosine residue 342, is localized at the membrane. Expression of ectopic membrane-targeted PTK6 led to dramatic morphology changes and formation of peripheral adhesion complexes in PC3 cells. Peripheral adhesion complex formation was dependent upon PTK6 kinase activity. We demonstrated that p130 CRK-associated substrate (p130CAS) is a novel direct substrate of PTK6, and it works as a crucial adapter protein in inducing peripheral adhesion complexes. Activation of ERK5 downstream of p130CAS was indispensable for this process. Knockdown of endogenous PTK6 led to reduced cell migration and p130CAS phosphorylation, whereas knockdown of p130CAS attenuated oncogenic signaling induced by membrane-targeted PTK6, including ERK5 and AKT activation. Expression of membrane-targeted PTK6 promoted cell migration, which could be impaired by knockdown of p130CAS or ERK5.

Kok E.M. Dorssers L.C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). p130CAS is concentrated at focal adhesions (29Petch L.A. Bockholt S.M. Bouton A. Parsons J.T. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following activation of integrin signaling, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src phosphorylate p130CAS at several tyrosine residues, which provide binding sites for the adaptor protein CRK. This leads to activation of the small GTPase RAC, inducing membrane ruffling and cytoskeleton remodeling and promoting cell migration (30Tachibana K. Urano T. Fujita H. Ohashi Y. Kamiguchi K.

Overexpression of p130CAS in murine mammary tumor virus-HER2/Neu mice results in multifocal mammary tumors with significantly reduced latency (34Cabodi S. Tinnirello A. Di Stefano P. Bisarò B.

Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 4672-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A human breast cancer study showed that tumor levels of p130CAS were inversely correlated with relapse-free survival and overall survival time (35Dorssers L.C. Grebenchtchikov N. Brinkman A.

Higher p130CAS expression was also detected in metastatic prostate cancer compared with localized prostate lesions that correlated with EGF receptor expression (36Fromont G. Vallancien G. Validire P. Levillain P. Cussenot O. Prostate. 2007; 67: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of active Src in KM12C cells induces the formation of peripheral adhesion complexes, which are focal adhesion-like structures. Vinculin, paxillin, FAK, and integrins were enriched in these discrete structures at the tips of membrane protrusions. Src-induced formation of peripheral adhesions relies on integrin αv and β1, FAK, and ERK1/2 signaling cascades (37Avizienyte E. Wyke A.W. Jones R.J. McLean G.W. Westhoff M.A. Brunton V.G. Frame M.C.

Cell. 2004; 15: 2794-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Src is also a central mediator in forming podosome/invadopodium structures in a wide range of cells; these structures play critical roles in cell migration and invasion (39Ayala I. Baldassarre M. Giacchetti G. Caldieri G. Tetè S. Luini A. Buccione R. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Podosomes/invadopodia are dynamic, actin-rich adhesion structures that also share common molecular components with focal adhesions, including FAK, vinculin, and integrins (40Weaver A.M. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2006; 23: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). We show here that p130CAS is a novel substrate of PTK6 that serves as an important adapter protein in the formation of peripheral adhesion complexes induced by membrane-targeted PTK6. Unlike Src, PTK6-induced peripheral adhesion complexes appeared to be FAK- and ERK1/2-independent. Instead, activation of the ERK5 signaling pathway downstream of p130CAS was crucial for the formation of peripheral adhesion complexes. Membrane-targeted PTK6 promoted cell migration through p130CAS and ERK5, whereas knockdown of endogenous PTK6 in PC3 cells impaired cell migration. Anti-human PTK6 (C-18 and G-6), anti-mouse PTK6 (C-17), anti-FAK (C-20), anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20), anti-SP1 (PEP2), and anti-HER2/Neu (C-18) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

Donkey anti-rabbit or sheep anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were used as secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and detected by chemiluminescence with SuperSignal West Dura extended duration substrate from Pierce. Myc-tagged full-length human wild type (WT), active (YF), and kinase-defective (kinase-dead mutant (KM)) PTK6 in the pcDNA3 vector as well as Myc-tagged NLS-PTK6 and Palm-PTK6 constructs in the pcDNA4-TO vector have been described previously (9Zheng Y.

The human embryonic kidney cell line 293 (HEK-293) (ATCC CRL-1573), the mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line SYF (ATCC CRL-2459), the human prostate cancer cell lines PC3 (ATCC CRL-1435) and LNCaP (ATCC CRL-1740), and the human breast cancer cell lines T47D (ATCC HTB-133) and MDA-MB-231 (ATCC HTB-26) were cultured according to ATCC guidelines in the recommended medium. The benign prostatic hyperplasia epithelial cell line BPH1 (kindly provided by Dr. Simon Hayward, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN) was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (43Hayward S.W. Dahiya R. Cunha G.R. Bartek J. Deshpande N. Narayan P. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1995; 31: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Transfections were performed using the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were rinsed twice with cold PBS and lysed in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 5 mm iodoacetic acid, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) 18–24 h after transfection. Cell fractionation of prostate and breast cancer cell lines was performed using the ProteoExtract subcellular proteome extraction kit from Calbiochem according to the manufacturer's instructions. One-tenth volume of each fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) for immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitations were performed with 500 μg of total cell lysates and 0.5 μg of specific antibodies under overnight incubation at 4 °C. 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (GE Healthcare) was added and incubated for 1 h after which the beads were washed four times in wash buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate). After removing the supernatant in the final wash, samples were resuspended in 30 μl of 2× reducing Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The proteins retained on the protein A beads were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 8% gels and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes for immunoblotting. For the GST pulldown assay, GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). GST protein purification and the subsequent processes were performed as described previously (9Zheng Y. Peng M. Wang Z. Asara J.M. Tyner A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 4280-4292Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). PC3 cells were seeded in 4- or 8-well chamber slides that were uncoated or coated with collagen I (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were washed with PBS, fixed in Carnoy's solution (6:3:1 ethanol:chloroform:acetic acid), then blocked with 3% BSA for 1 h, and incubated with primary antibodies overnight. After washing, samples were incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated avidin (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). For double staining, FITC-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich) were used to detect primary antibodies made in mouse (green), and biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories) were used and then incubated with rhodamine-conjugated avidin to detect primary antibodies made in rabbit (red). Slides were mounted in Vectashield fluorescent mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector Laboratories). Cells were then observed using standard UV, rhodamine, or FITC filters under 40× and 63× differential interference contrast oil immersion objectives using a Zeiss LSM 5 PASCAL confocal microscope. Images were obtained with an Axiocam HRc color digital camera and LSM 5 PASCAL software (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Kinase assays were performed with 50 ng of recombinant human PTK6 (Invitrogen) and 1 μg of recombinant human p130CAS (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) in 30 μl of kinase buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.01% Triton X-100, 10 mm MnCl2) with or without 200 μm ATP for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 30 μl of 2× reducing Laemmli sample buffer and boiling. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes for immunoblotting. For all mass spectrometry (MS) experiments, p130CAS immunoprecipitates were separated using SDS-PAGE, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad) and destained, and the protein band was excised. Samples were subjected to reduction with 10 mm DTT for 30 min, alkylation with 55 mm iodoacetamide for 45 min, and in-gel digestion with modified trypsin or chymotrypsin overnight at pH 8.3 followed by LC/MS/MS. LC/MS/MS was performed using an EASY-nLC splitless nanoflow HPLC system (Proxeon Biosciences, Denmark) with a self-packed 75-μm-inner diameter × 15-cm C18 Picofrit column (New Objective, Woburn, MA) coupled to an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) in the data-dependent acquisition and positive ion mode at 300 nl/min with one full MS Fourier transform scan followed by six MS/MS spectra. MS/MS spectra collected via collision-induced dissociation in the ion trap were searched against the concatenated target and decoy (reversed) single entry Na+K+-ATPase and full Swiss-Prot protein databases using Sequest (Proteomics Browser Software, Thermo Scientific) with differential modifications for Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylation (+79.97) and the sample processing artifacts Met oxidation (+15.99), deamidation of Asn and Gln (+0.984), and Cys alkylation (+57.02). Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptide sequences were identified if they initially passed the following Sequest scoring thresholds against the target database: 1+ ions, Xcorr ≥ 2.0, Sf ≥ 0.4, p ≥ 5; 2+ ions, Xcorr ≥ 2.0, Sf ≥ 0.4, p ≥ 5; and 3+ ions, Xcorr ≥ 2.60, Sf ≥ 0.4, p ≥ 5 against the target protein database. Passing MS/MS spectra were manually inspected to be sure that all b- and y-fragment ions aligned with the assigned sequence and modification sites. Determination of the exact sites of phosphorylation was aided using FuzzyIons and GraphMod, and phosphorylation site maps were created using ProteinReport software (Proteomics Browser Software suite, Thermo Scientific). False discovery rates of peptide hits (phosphorylated and unphosphorylated) were estimated below 1.50% based on reversed database hits. Half of the digested peptide pool was reserved for enrichment with the Phos-trap phosphopeptide enrichment kit containing titanium dioxide (TiO2)-coated magnetic beads (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, peptide mixtures containing phosphopeptides were acidified with binding buffer and incubated with 20 μl of 20× TiO2 magnetic beads diluted in 180 μl of HPLC grade water with continuous shaking for 1 h at room temperature followed by washing three times with binding buffer and one time with washing buffer. Phosphopeptides were then incubated with 35 μl of basic elution buffer with continuous shaking. Elution buffer was then transferred to a 12 × 32-mm autosampler vial with 50 μl of HPLC A buffer, and the final solution was concentrated to 5 μl using a SpeedVac prior to injection via LC/MS/MS. pBABE-puro plasmids were transfected into Phoenix Ampho cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Retrovirus was collected 48 and 72 h later. PC3 cells were infected with retrovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 500 for 24 h. Stable cell pools were selected in F-12K medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 μg/ml puromycin for a week. PC3 cells were transfected with PTK6 siRNA or scrambled control siRNA for 24 h and then serum-starved for another 24 h. 5 × 104 cells were plated in the top chamber of a Transwell (24-well insert; pore size, 8 μm; Corning) and incubated with 1% FBS-containing F-12K medium. 20% FBS-containing F-12K medium was added to the lower chamber as a chemoattractant. After 18 h, cells that did not migrate through the pores were removed by a cotton swab, and the cells on the lower surface of the membrane were stained by crystal violet. For the wound healing assay, cells expressing vector or Palm-PTK6-YF were grown to confluence in 6-well plates and serum-starved for 24 h. Wounds were carefully made across the cell monolayer, and the medium was replaced by fresh complete F-12K medium. Cell migration was monitored for 48 h. Images were taken under the phase-contrast microscope using 10× magnification. For the analysis of the NCBI human genome microarray data set GDS2545, which contains 171 human prostate samples, results are shown as the mean ± S.E. For all the other cell studies, data represent the mean of at least three independent experiments ±S.D. p values were determined using the one-tailed Student's t test (Microsoft Excel 2010). A difference was considered statistically significant if the p value was equal to or less than 0.05. Quantitative analyses of immunoblots were performed using the NIH ImageJ program (44Rasband W.S. ImageJ. United States National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1997–2011Google Scholar). To investigate the role of PTK6 in prostate cancer, we compared PTK6 expression in normal human prostate tissue, normal tissue adjacent to the tumor, primary and metastatic prostate tumors using the NCBI human genome microarray data set GDS2545 (45Yu Y.P. Landsittel D. Jing L. Nelson J. Ren B. Liu L. McDonald C. Thomas R. Dhir R. Finkelstein S. Michalopoulos G. Becich M. Luo J.H. J. Clin. Oncol. 2004; 22: 2790-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). PTK6 mRNA levels were increased in metastatic prostate tumor samples (Fig. 1A), suggesting an oncogenic role for PTK6 in prostate cancer metastasis. Next, we examined the localization of PTK6 in two prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 (androgen receptor-negative) and LNCaP (androgen receptor-positive), and a benign prostatic hyperplasia cell line, BPH1 (43Hayward S.W. Dahiya R. Cunha G.R. Bartek J. Deshpande N. Narayan P. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1995; 31: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Cells were fractionated into cytoplasmic, membrane/organelle, and nuclear compartments. In all three prostate cell lines, PTK6 was primarily localized in the cytoplasm and membrane compartments (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained in the MDA-MB-231 and T47D breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 1B). A variety of data indicate that PTK6 may activate oncogenic signaling when localized at the membrane or within the cytoplasm, whereas it has a growth inhibitory effect when targeted to the nucleus (12Palka-Hamblin H.L.

Evans M.D. Dominguez-Brauer C. Peehl D.M. Tyner A.L. PLoS One. 2011; 6: e14789Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This is probably due to its access to specific substrates in different intracellular compartments, but the detailed mechanisms are still unclear. Interestingly, although the majority of detectable PTK6 was cytoplasmic in PC3 cells, the activated pool of the endogenous kinase that is phosphorylated on tyrosine residue 342 was associated with the membrane (Fig. 1C, Vec). Phosphorylation of PTK6 at tyrosine 342 (Tyr(P)-342) is associated with its activation (48Qiu H. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34634-34641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and is detected with a PTK6 phosphospecific Tyr(P)-342 antibody. To address the significance of PTK6 activation at the membrane, we targeted expression of different PTK6 isoforms to different cellular compartments in PC3 cells. A myristoylation/palmitoylation sequence (Palm) from the Src family kinase Lyn was added to the N terminus of PTK6 for membrane targeting. Mutation of the inhibitory tyrosine residue 447 to phenylalanine (YF) results in a constitutively active form of PTK6 (48Qiu H. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34634-34641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As determined by fractionation assays, exogenous Palm-PTK6-YF protein was at the membrane, but significant levels could also be detected in the cytoplasm perhaps due to its retention there by an as of yet unidentified factor in PC3 cells (23Brauer P.M. Zheng Y. Wang L. Tyner A.L. Cell Cycle. 2010; 9: 4190-4199Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Only the membrane pool of exogenous Palm-PTK6-YF was highly phosphorylated on tyrosine residue 342 (Fig. 1C). This is similar to the endogenous PTK6 expressed in the vector control cells (Fig. 1C). These data suggest that membrane localization of PTK6 is critical for its activation. In addition, an SV40 nuclear localization signal (NLS) was added to the N terminus of PTK6 for nuclear targeting. Equivalent levels of ectopic Myc-tagged PTK6 were expressed in PC3 stable cell lines (Fig. 1D). Immunofluore"

We hypothesize that intraoperative echocardiography can be utilized to diagnose iatrogenic MS immediately after MV repair. Methods The medical records of 552 consecutive patients undergoing MV repair at a single institution were reviewed. Post-cardiopulmonary bypass peak and mean transmitral pressure gradients (TMPG), and pressure half time (PHT) were obtained from intraoperative transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) examinations in each patient. Results Nine patients (9/552 = 1.6%) received a reoperation for primary MS, prior to hospital discharge. Interestingly, all of these patients already showed intraoperative post-CPB mean and peak TMPGs that were significantly higher compared to values for those who did not: 10.7±4.8 mmHg vs 2.9±1.6 mmHg; p<0.0001 and 22.9±7.9 mmHg vs 7.6±3.7 mmHg; p<0.0001, respectively. However, PHT varied considerably (87±37 ms; range: 20–439 ms) within the entire population, and only weakly predicted the requirement for reoperation (113±56 vs. 87±37 ms, p = 0.034). Receiver operating characteristic curves showed strong discriminating ability for mean gradients (AUC = 0.993) and peak gradients (area under the curve, AUC = 0.996), but poor performance for PHT (AUC = 0.640). A value of ≥7 mmHg for mean, and ≥17 mmHg for peak TMPG, best separated patients who required reoperation for MS from those who did not. Conclusions Intraoperative TEE diagnosis of a peak TMPG ≥17 mmHg or mean TMPG ≥7 mmHg immediately following CPB are suggestive of clinically relevant MS after MV repair."

Among these are the staphylococcal complement inhibitors (SCIN), which are composed of three active proteins (SCIN-A, -B, and -C) and one purportedly inactive member (SCIN-D or ORF-D). Because previous work has focused almost exclusively on SCIN-A, we sought to provide initial structure/function information on additional SCIN proteins. To this end we determined crystal structures of an active, N-terminal truncation mutant of SCIN-B (denoted SCIN-B18–85) both free and bound to the C3c fragment of complement component C3 at 1.5 and 3.4 Å resolution, respectively. Comparison of the C3c/SCIN-B18–85 structure with that of C3c/SCIN-A revealed that both proteins target the same functional hotspot on the C3b/C3c surface yet harbor diversity in both the type of residues and interactions formed at their C3b/C3c interfaces. Most importantly, these structures allowed identification of Arg44 and Tyr51 as residues key for SCIN-B binding to C3b and subsequent inhibition of the AP C3 convertase. In addition, we also solved several crystal structures of SCIN-D to 1.3 Å limiting resolution. This revealed an unexpected structural deviation in the N-terminal α helix relative to SCIN-A and SCIN-B. Comparative analysis of both electrostatic potentials and surface complementarity suggest a physical explanation for the inability of SCIN-D to bind C3b/C3c. Together, these studies provide a more thorough understanding of immune evasion by S. aureus and enhance potential use of SCIN proteins as templates for design of complement targeted therapeutics.

Hajishengallis G. Yang K. Lambris J.D. Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). Activation of complement may be achieved spontaneously and continuously (tick-over) or via binding of pattern recognition proteins to pathogen-specific surface structures to trigger either the classical, lectin, or alternative pathways (AP). 2The abbreviations used are: APalternative pathwayfBfactor BfHfactor HfDfactor DCVFcobra venom factorMGmacroglobulinbis-tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolSPRsurface plasmon resonance. Despite the mode of initiation, all three pathways of complement converge at the level of C3 convertases, which lie at the heart of the complement cascade by converting the native complement component C3 into its bioactive proteolytic fragments C3a and C3b. Whereas C3a is an anaphylatoxin that promotes several effector functions of complement, C3b covalently opsonizes nearby surfaces via its reactive thioester moiety that becomes exposed upon activation of native C3. A powerful self-amplification loop is established by surface-bound C3b and the proteolytic Bb fragment of factor B (fB), which together form the AP C3 convertase (C3bBb) that enzymatically converts native C3 into C3b. It is this self-amplification of C3b that drives the downstream formation of C5 convertases, triggers inflammation and chemotaxis of phagocytes via C5a generation, and initiates C5b-dependent assembly of the terminal complement complex. After complement activation, targeted cells may be destroyed either through opsonin-mediated phagocytic uptake or by terminal complement complex-mediated membrane disruption (1Ricklin D. Hajishengallis G. Yang K. Lambris J.D. Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). alternative pathway factor B factor H factor D cobra venom factor macroglobulin 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol surface plasmon resonance. Because the AP exhibits a low but continuous state of activation even in the absence of infection and because the majority of complement activity is in many cases attributed to the AP C3 convertase self-amplification loop (2Harboe M. Ulvund G. Vien L. Fung M. Mollnes T.E. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2004; 138: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), it is paramount that this positive feedback system be exquisitely regulated to prevent indiscriminate complement attack and damage to healthy host cells and tissues. Whereas a number of so-called regulators of complement activation (for review, see Ref. 3Zipfel P.F. Skerka C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar) have been described, factor H (fH) is of particular importance as a negative regulator of C3 convertase activity. fH is present as a freely circulating protein within plasma; however, it is also effectively adsorbed to host cells through association with negatively charged carbohydrate markers exposed on their surfaces (4Meri S. Pangburn M.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1994; 198: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 5Pangburn M.K. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 49: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Although the inherently labile nature of AP C3 convertases clearly contributes to their regulation (6Pangburn M.K. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 7Wu J. Wu Y.Q. Ricklin D. Janssen B.J. Lambris J.D. Gros P. Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 728-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), fH greatly enhances the irreversible dissociation of their Bb fragment in a process known as decay acceleration. In addition to this, fH also functions as a cofactor for the factor I-mediated degradation of C3b into iC3b. Although iC3b serves as a ligand for complement receptors exposed on the surface of lymphoid and phagocytic cells, it is no longer a substrate for further convertase assembly. In this manner fH inhibits downstream complement amplification by disrupting the multiprotein convertase enzyme and by promoting degradation of the C3b scaffold required for convertase formation (1Ricklin D. Hajishengallis G. Yang K. Lambris J.D. Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 785-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar, 3Zipfel P.F. Skerka C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the opportunistic bacterial pathogen Staphylococcus aureus has also evolved a potent group of small secreted proteins that effectively target and disrupt the human complement response (8Lambris J.D. Ricklin D. Geisbrecht B.V. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 9Geisbrecht B.V. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2008; 632: 221-236PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins are both structurally divergent and mechanistically distinct from fH, and their expression and secretion (along with other immune modulators) is thought to contribute to S. aureus survival in the presence of the robust inflammatory and phagocytic response mounted by an immunocompetent host (10Foster T.J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 948-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 11Chavakis T. Preissner K.T. Herrmann M. Trends Immunol. 2007; 28: 408-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although their potential antigenicity and existing antibody titers against these proteins has been suggested to prevent their direct use in treating complement-related diseases in human populations (12Jongerius I. Köhl J. Pandey M.K. Ruyken M. van Kessel K.P. van Strijp J.A. Rooijakkers S.H. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 2461-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 13Rooijakkers S.H. Ruyken M. Roos A.

Ruyken M. van Strijp J.A. Gros P. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 2989-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), they nevertheless present an evolutionarily optimized template for the design of therapeutic complement inhibitors (9Geisbrecht B.V. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2008; 632: 221-236PubMed Google Scholar, 15Laarman A. Milder F. van Strijp J. Rooijakkers S. J. Mol. Med. 2010; 88: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For such long term applications to be effectively approached, however, a detailed molecular understanding of the interactions between human complement components and these bacterial inhibitors is required. One sophisticated inhibitory mode has been recently reported for the so-called staphylococcal complement inhibitor protein (herein denoted SCIN-A) (16Rooijakkers S.H. van Kessel K.P. van Strijp J.A. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 596-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 17Ricklin D. Tzekou A. Garcia B.L. Hammel M. McWhorter W.J. Sfyroera G. Wu Y.Q. Holers V.M. Herbert A.P. Barlow P.N. Geisbrecht B.V. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 2565-2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). SCIN-A acts at the level of AP C3 convertases and blocks amplification of C3b deposition on the microbial surface. Structure/function studies revealed that SCIN-A binds a functional hotspot on C3b and that SCIN-A bound convertases (C3bBb/SCIN-A) become trapped in a catalytically inactive state (17Ricklin D. Tzekou A. Garcia B.L. Hammel M. McWhorter W.J. Sfyroera G. Wu Y.Q. Holers V.M. Herbert A.P. Barlow P.N. Geisbrecht B.V. Lambris J.D. J.

Gros P. Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 721-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In addition to this, SCIN-A also blocks host fH binding to C3b and, in doing so, stabilizes this inactive form of the convertase against decay acceleration (17Ricklin D. Tzekou A. Garcia B.L. Hammel M. McWhorter W.J. Sfyroera G. Wu Y.Q. Holers V.M. Herbert A.P. Barlow P.N. Geisbrecht B.V. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 2565-2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). More recent work has also shown that a second C3b binding site on SCIN-A (17Ricklin D. Tzekou A. Garcia B.L. Hammel M. McWhorter W.J. Sfyroera G. Wu Y.Q. Holers V.M. Herbert A.P. Barlow P.N.

Gros P. Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 721-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) promotes formation of (C3bBb/SCIN-A)2 pseudo-dimers that mask the C3b recognition site of complement receptors CR1 and CRIg, thereby blocking phagocytic uptake of C3b-opsonized bacterial cells (20Jongerius I. Puister M. Wu J. Ruyken M. van Strijp J.A. Rooijakkers S.H. J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this manner, SCIN-A not only interferes with complement amplification and convertase dynamics; it also disrupts downstream immune processes initiated via complement activation. Aside from SCIN-A, there exist two additional related proteins denoted SCIN-B and SCIN-C, with demonstrated complement inhibitor activity (12Jongerius I. Köhl J. Pandey M.K. Ruyken M. van Kessel K.P. van Strijp J.A. Rooijakkers S.H. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 2461-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 14Rooijakkers S.H. Milder F.J. Bardoel B.W. Ruyken M. van Strijp J.A. Gros P. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 2989-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A fourth protein known as SCIN-D (also referred to as ORF-D (14Rooijakkers S.H. Milder F.J. Bardoel B.W. Ruyken M. van Strijp J.A. Gros P. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 2989-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)) has also been grouped with the SCIN family on the basis of sequence homology; however, it displays none of the complement inhibition or anti-phagocytic properties exhibited by the active members (12Jongerius I. Köhl J. Pandey M.K. Ruyken M. van Kessel K.P. van Strijp J.A. Rooijakkers S.H. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 2461-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 14Rooijakkers S.H. Milder F.J. Bardoel B.W. Ruyken M. van Strijp J.A. Gros P. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 2989-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Overall, these additional proteins share 43, 47, and 32% sequence identity to SCIN-A, respectively (supplemental Fig. S1A). Still, there is little known about the structures of these remaining SCIN family proteins, and there is almost no detailed information on the molecular nature of their interactions with complement proteins. To begin addressing such questions, we report here the crystal structures of an N-terminal truncation mutant of SCIN-B, both free and in complex with the C3 fragment, C3c. Analysis of these structures has identified specific determinants in SCIN-B that are important for C3b binding and required for complement inhibition by this protein. In addition, we have also determined the crystal structure of the purportedly inactive SCIN-D protein. Interestingly, SCIN-D differs in secondary and tertiary structure in a region centered on its N-terminal α helix. Although SCIN-D maintains many of the key residues that contribute to C3b binding by its counterparts, both its electrostatic potential and surface complementarity values for C3c differ from those of SCIN-A and SCIN-B. Together, these studies expand upon our understanding of the structure and molecular basis for complement recognition and inhibition by SCIN proteins. Purified human C3c, C3b, fB, factor D (fD), fH, and cobra venom factor (CVF) were obtained from Complement Technology (Tyler, TX). A mouse monoclonal antibody (clone 030-08; catalogue number sc-58929) that recognizes the TED domain of human C3/C3b/iC3b/C3d was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. DNA fragments encoding SCIN-A, SCIN-B, SCIN-D, and directed fragments thereof were amplified from S. aureus (strain Mu50) genomic DNA and subcloned into the prokaryotic overexpression vector pT7HMT as previously described (21Garcia B.L. Tzekou A. Ramyar K.X. McWhorter W.J. Ricklin D. Lambris J.D. Geisbrecht B.V. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2009; 65: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 22Geisbrecht B.V. Bouyain S. Pop M. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 46: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of SCIN-B and SCIN-D was carried out by a two-step megaprimer PCR method using their corresponding pT7HMT-based overexpression plasmids as a template (23Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. Biotechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). Individual clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. After expression and purification, mutant proteins were analyzed for structural integrity by comparative circular dichroism spectropolarimetry with respective wild-type samples. Recombinant proteins harboring the c-myc epitope tag at their N terminus were prepared similarly to their untagged counterparts, with the exception that the tobacco etch virus protease digestion step was omitted (21Garcia B.L. Tzekou A. Ramyar K.X. McWhorter W.J. Ricklin D. Lambris J.D. Geisbrecht B.V. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2009; 65: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 22Geisbrecht B.V. Bouyain S. Pop M. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 46: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Seleno-l-methionine-labeled samples were obtained using a method previously described (24Beneken J. Tu J.C. Xiao B. Nuriya M. Yuan J.P. Worley P.F. Leahy D.J. Neuron. 2000; 26: 143-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). SCIN-B was also overexpressed from a modified version of the pT7HMT vector that encodes a cysteine residue as the first amino acid of the polypeptide of interest. Site-specifically biotinylated cys-SCIN-B was produced using the EZ-Link Maleimide-PEG2-Biotin reagent (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the excess biotinylation reagent was removed by ultrafiltration into PBS (pH 7.4). Successful biotinylation was confirmed by Western blotting using a streptavidin-conjugated anti-HRP antibody and SuperSignal Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific). C3b site-specifically biotinylated at Cys1010 was prepared by activating native C3 via a stable CVF-based C3 convertase at pH 7.0 (PBS with 5 mm nickel sulfate) in the presence of the biotinylation reagent described above. Briefly, 60 μl of a solution containing CVF and fB (1 μm each) were activated to CVFBb by adding factor D (0.1 μm final concentration) and incubating for 5 min at room temperature. At this time the CVFBb was added to 330 μl of a solution containing native C3 (4 μm) and EZ-Link Maleimide-PEG2-Biotin (190 μm) and incubated for 2 h further at room temperature. The reaction was then incubated overnight at 4 °C to allow free-thiol derivatization to approach completion. The next day the sample was buffer-exchanged into 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and applied to a 1-ml Resource Q anion-exchange column (GE Healthcare) to isolate the C3b-biotin from contaminating reactants/proteins. Successful biotinylation was confirmed by Western blotting as described above. For preparation of samples used in crystallization trials, C3c was first treated with a 1:200 (w/w) ratio of a recombinant Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein peptide N-glycosidase F fusion protein for 2 h at 37 °C to remove N-glycans. After this, the deglycosylated C3c protein was further isolated by anion exchange chromatography on a Resource Q column (GE Healthcare). For complex formation, a solution of purified SCIN-B18–85 was mixed with deglycosylated C3c to yield an equimolar complex of C3c/SCIN18–85. The complex sample was exchanged by ultrafiltration into buffer of 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, and concentrated to 5 mg/ml total protein. All crystallization experiments were carried out by vapor diffusion of hanging drops. Before diffraction analysis, crystal samples were preserved by flash-cooling in a Dewar of liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected using either beamline 22-ID or 22-BM of the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory), and the individual reflections were indexed, integrated, and scaled using either HKL2000 or XDS/XSCALE (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). All aspects of structure solution and refinement were carried out using individual programs as implemented within the PHENIX suite (26Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.W. Kapral G.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Oeffner R. Read R.J. Richardson D.C. Richardson J.S. Terwilliger T.C. Zwart P.H. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (16817) Google Scholar). In particular, all molecular replacement solutions were obtained using the program PHASER, whereas de novo phase calculation by single wavelength anomalous dispersion was performed using PHENIX.AUTOSOL. For all structures except that of C3c/SCIN-B18–85, an initial model was built using PHENIX.AUTOBUILD. Final models were obtained after manual building in COOT (27Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) and subsequent rounds of refinement using PHENIX.REFINE. Models were analyzed and validated using MOLPROBITY (28Chen V.B. Arendall 3rd, W.B. Headd J.J. Keedy D.A. Immormino R.M. Kapral G.J. Murray L.W. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (10078) Google Scholar) before PDB deposition. All structural representations were prepared using PyMOL, whereas comparisons of superimpositions were determined using STAMP (29Russell R.B. Barton G.J. Proteins. 1992; 14: 309-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The following sections describe specific information pertaining to individual crystals and their structures. SCIN-B18–85 crystals grew in 1 day at 4 °C using a solution of 0.1 m sodium citrate (pH 3.5), 1 m ammonium sulfate as a precipitant. Drops consisted of 1 μl of protein sample (12 mg/ml) and 1 μl of precipitant solution that had been previously diluted with three volumes of double-distilled H2O. Crystals were cryoprotected using precipitant solution containing 20% (v/v) glycerol. A polyalanine model of the previously published SCIN-A structure (PDB code 2QFF (14Rooijakkers S.H. Milder F.J. Bardoel B.W. Ruyken M. van Strijp J.A. Gros P. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 2989-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)) was created and used to solve this structure by molecular replacement. C3c/SCIN-B18–85 co-crystals appeared in 2–5 days at 20 °C using 0.1 m bis-tris (pH 6.5) and 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350 as a precipitant. Drops consisted of 1 μl of complex sample (5 mg/ml) and 1 μl of precipitant solution that had been previously diluted with 1 volume of double-distilled H2O. Crystals were cryoprotected by a brief incubation in precipitant containing 20% (v/v) glycerol. The refined coordinates of SCIN-B18–85 and C3c (PDB code 2A74 (30Janssen B.J. Huizinga E.G. Raaijmakers H.C. Roos A. Daha M.R. Nilsson-Ekdahl K. Nilsson B. Gros P. Nature. 2005; 437: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar)) were used to solve this structure by molecular replacement. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were employed where applicable during all steps of solution and refinement of this structure. Both native and selenium-labeled SCIN-D8–83 crystals were obtained after 2–3 days at 20 °C using a precipitant solution of 0.1 m bis-tris (pH 5.0), 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, and 20 mm sodium thiocyanate. Individual drops consisted of 1 μl of protein sample (10 mg/ml) and 1 μl of precipitant solution that had been previously diluted with an equal volume of double-distilled H2O. Cryoprotection was achieved by adding 10% (v/v) glycerol to the precipitant solution. The initial structure was solved by single wavelength anomalous dispersion, and this refined model was used to solve the native crystal. Full-length SCIN-D crystals appeared after 1 month at 20 °C using 0.1 m bis-tris (pH 4.8) and 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350 as a precipitant. Drops consisted of 1 μl of protein (10 mg/ml) and 1 μl of precipitant solution that had been previously diluted with an equal volume of double-distilled H2O. Crystals were cryoprotected using precipitant solution containing 20% (v/v) glycerol. The refined coordinates of native SCIN-D8–83 were used to solve this structure by molecular replacement. Assays for binding between SCIN-A/SCIN-B and various proteins were conducted by employing a luminescent microbead AlphaScreen technology (Ref. 31Bielefeld-Sevigny M. Assay Drug Dev. Technol. 2009; 7: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The principle of this assay relies upon a streptavidin donor bead, which recognizes a biotinylated ligand that binds a second target protein, which itself can be adsorbed to acceptor bead via a c-Myc epitope or a protein-specific mouse monoclonal IgG. Using this approach, an equilibrium competition binding assay was established in 96-well format ½ area opaque plates using the AlphaScreen c-Myc detection kit or anti-mouse IgG kit purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and carried out according to either of the following general procedures. SCIN-A/C3b competition assays were carried out in a final reaction volume of 25 μl by adding each assay component to the following final concentrations: 50 nm myc-SCIN-A, 5 nm C3b-biotin, 20 μg/ml c-Myc AlphaScreen acceptor beads, and 20 μg/ml AlphaScreen Streptavidin Donor beads. A dilution series for each unlabeled competitor protein was prepared. The reaction was performed over the course of 2.5 h and began by mixing myc-SCIN-A, C3b-biotin, and varying concentrations of unlabeled competitor. After 1 h of incubation time at room temperature, this solution was mixed with the acceptor beads and allowed to incubate for an additional 1 h. Finally, donor beads were added and after a 30-min incubation time the evolving AlphaScreen signal (photon counts at 630 nm/s) was read on an EnSpire multimode plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). SCIN-B/C3b competition assays were carried out using the same general protocol as described above, with the following changes in final concentrations of each component: 25 nm biotinylated-SCIN-B, 2 nm C3b, and 1 nm anti-C3d IgG. The reaction was begun by mixing, C3b, and varying concentrations of unlabeled competitor while separately mixing acceptor beads with anti-C3d IgG. After a 1-h incubation time at room temperature, these two solutions were mixed and allowed to incubate for an additional 1 h. Finally, donor beads were added, and after 30 min of incubation time the AlphaScreen signal was measured. The AlphaScreen signal was normalized to wells containing no inhibitor, and a dose-response curve was generated by plotting normalized signal versus log[competitor (m)]. Where applicable, apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) were calculated by nonlinear curve-fitting to a one-site fit Ki model using GraphPad Prism5 software (GraphPad; La Jolla, CA). IC50 values were defined by, log⁡IC50=log⁡10log⁡[Ki]×1+[L]/KD,LT(Eq. 1) where [L] = [myc-SCIN-A] = 50 nm, and KD,LT = KD,SCIN-A/C3b =177 nm (as judged independently by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (17Ricklin D.

Immunol. 2009; 183: 2565-2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The interaction between C3b and various SCIN proteins and their mutants was measured by SPR using a Biacore 3000 instrument (GE Healthcare) at 25 °C. HBS-ET (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20) was used as the mobile phase throughout the experiment. Site-specifically biotinylated C3b was captured on a streptavidin sensor chip (GE Healthcare) at a density of 4400 resonance units (17Ricklin D. Tzekou A. Garcia B.L. Hammel M. McWhorter W.J. Sfyroera G. Wu Y.Q. Holers V.M. Herbert A.P. Barlow P.N. Geisbrecht B.V. Lambris J.D. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 2565-2574Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). SCIN proteins were diluted to a concentration of 10 μm in HBS-ET and injected for 1 min at a 20 μl/min flow rate with a dissociation phase of 2 min. Signals from an empty streptavidin flow cell and from an ensemble of buffer blank injections were used to perform double referencing of sample responses. Data processing and evaluation was performed using Scrubber (v2.0c; BioLogic Software Pty Ltd, Campbell, Australia). Because SPR signal generation is directly dependent on the molecular weight of injected analytes, each response signal was divided by the molecular weight of the corresponding protein to allow for a ranking of SCIN mutants (the y axis was adjusted to 100% for the signal of wild-type SCIN-B). Activation of C3 by the alternative pathway convertase was measured by monitoring proteolysis of the C3 α chain by SDS-PAGE. This reflects physiological cleavage of C3 into C3b (composed of α′ and β chains) and C3a. To begin, the initial, fluid-phase AP convertase was formed in vitro by incubating 1 volume of an equimolar mixtur"
https://openalex.org/W1978929345,"Toads (Rhinella arenarum) received training with a novel incentive procedure involving access to solutions of different NaCl concentrations. In Experiment 1, instrumental behavior and weight variation data confirmed that such solutions yield incentive values ranging from appetitive (deionized water, DW, leading to weight gain), to neutral (300 mM slightly hypertonic solution, leading to no net weight gain or loss), and aversive (800 mM highly hypertonic solution leading to weight loss). In Experiment 2, a downshift from DW to a 300 mM solution or an upshift from a 300 mM solution to DW led to a gradual adjustment in instrumental behavior. In Experiment 3, extinction was similar after acquisition with access to only DW or with a random mixture of DW and 300 mM. In Experiment 4, a downshift from DW to 225, 212, or 200 mM solutions led again to gradual adjustments. These findings add to a growing body of comparative evidence suggesting that amphibians adjust to incentive shifts on the basis of habit formation and reorganization."
https://openalex.org/W1980669919,"PDZ (Post-synaptic density, 95 kDa, Discs large, Zona Occludens-1) domains are protein interaction domains that bind to the carboxy-terminal amino acids of binding partners, heterodimerize with other PDZ domains, and also bind phosphoinositides. PDZ domain containing proteins are frequently involved in the assembly of multi-protein complexes and clustering of transmembrane proteins. LNX1 (Ligand of Numb, protein X 1) is a RING (Really Interesting New Gene) domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase that also includes four PDZ domains suggesting it functions as a scaffold for a multi-protein complex. Here we use a human protein array to identify direct LNX1 PDZ domain binding partners. Screening of 8,000 human proteins with isolated PDZ domains identified 53 potential LNX1 binding partners. We combined this set with LNX1 interacting proteins identified by other methods to assemble a list of 220 LNX1 interacting proteins. Bioinformatic analysis of this protein list was used to select interactions of interest for future studies. Using this approach we identify and confirm six novel LNX1 binding partners: KCNA4, PAK6, PLEKHG5, PKC-alpha1, TYK2 and PBK, and suggest that LNX1 functions as a signalling scaffold."

Despite rapid progress in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of activation of JAK/STAT pathway, the processes that regulate JAK/STAT deactivation need to be further clarified. Here we demonstrate that CUE domain-containing 2 (CUEDC2) inhibits cytokine-induced phosphorylation of JAK1 and STAT3 and the subsequent STAT3 transcriptional activity. Further analysis by a yeast two-hybrid assay showed that CUEDC2 could engage in a specific interaction with a key JAK/STAT inhibitor, SOCS3 (suppressors of cytokine signaling 3). The interaction between CUEDC2 and SOCS3 is required for the inhibitory effect of CUEDC2 on JAK1 and STAT3 activity. Additionally, we found CUEDC2 functions collaboratively with SOCS3 to inhibit JAK1/STAT3 signaling by increasing SOCS3 stability via enhancing its association with Elongin C. Therefore, our findings revealed a new biological activity for CUEDC2 as the regulator of JAK1/STAT3 signaling and paved the way to a better understanding of the mechanisms by which SOCS3 has been linked to suppression of the JAK/STAT pathway.

The Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway was originally described as a signal-transducing pathway induced by interferons (1Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S. Cell. 1994; 76: 253-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). However, it has now been demonstrated that the JAK/STAT pathway mediates a multitude of distinct biological signals. JAK kinases are associated with cell surface receptors, such as cytokine and tyrosine kinase receptors. Binding of ligand triggers JAK-mediated phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic portion of the receptor. Cytoplasmic STAT proteins are recruited to the membrane by phosphorylated receptor and then phosphorylated by JAKs. Phosphorylated STATs then dimerize via their Src homology 2 (SH2) 4The abbreviations used are: SH2Src homology 2SOCSsuppressor of cytokine signalingPIASprotein inhibitor of activated statsCUEcoupling of ubiquitin conjugation to endoplasmic reticulum degradationCUEDC2CUE domain-containing 2EpoRerythropoietin receptorMEMminimum essential mediumaaamino acidsIRF-1interferon regulatory factor-1. domains, translocate to the nucleus, and transactivate target genes (2Levy D.E.

JAK/STAT pathway regulates many cellular processes critical for hematopoiesis, immune response, and allelotaxy, including innate and adaptive immune function, development, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and inflammation. Duration and degree of JAK/STAT activation are tightly controlled, and any deregulation will lead to disease, including tumor development (4Igaz P. Tóth S. Falus A.

The STAT protein family is composed of multiple members, termed STAT1–6. STAT3 was first described as a DNA-binding protein activated by epidermal growth factor and interleukin-6 (IL-6) capable of interacting with an enhancer element in the promoters of acute phase genes (5Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar, 6Bowman T. Garcia R. Turkson J. Jove R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2474-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar). Later studies demonstrated that STAT3 is activated in response to several cytokines and growth factors, such as interferon (IFN) and leptin. In normal cells, STAT3 activation is transient like other STAT family members; however, in a large number of primary tumors and cancer-derived cell lines, it remains persistently activated, which may be caused by impairment of negative regulation or mutation of STAT3 itself (7Bromberg J. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1139-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 8Lesina M. Kurkowski M.U. Ludes K. Rose-John S. Treiber M. Klöppel G. Yoshimura A. Reindl W. Sipos B. Akira S.

Evidence indicates that constitutive activation of STAT3 may contribute to cellular transformation, induce tumor angiogenesis, and suppress anti-tumor immune responses, further enhancing tumor progression (9Yu H.

Nat. Med. 2010; 16: 1421-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Therefore, STAT3 proteins are emerging as ideal targets for cancer therapy (9Yu H. Jove R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar, 11Sinibaldi D. Wharton W. Turkson J. Bowman T. Pledger W.J. Jove R.

Cell. 2002; 109: S121-S131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). A large body of literature has been generated on the regulation of the JAK/STAT pathway. After well defining of the positive regulators of this signaling pathway, three main classes of proteins that negatively control the JAK/STAT pathway were concluded, including SOCS (suppressors of cytokine signaling) proteins, PIAS (protein inhibitors of activated stats) family proteins, and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (13Greenhalgh C.J. Hilton D.J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2001; 70: 348-356PubMed Google Scholar). The SOCS family consists of eight members, including cytokine-inducible SH2 protein and SOCS-1–7. The SOCS proteins contain a central SH2 domain and a conserved carboxyl-terminal region called the SOCS box. Expression of SOCS proteins is rapidly induced by cytokine-mediated STAT activation (14Krebs D.L. Hilton D.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2813-2819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequently leads to down-regulation of cytokine-induced signal transduction. Therefore, SOCS proteins act in a classic negative feedback loop to regulate JAK/STAT signal transduction. Despite the structural similarity of SOCS family members, they inhibit JAK/STAT signaling through different mechanisms. For example, cytokine-inducible SH2 protein, which was the first family member identified, was shown to compete with STAT5 for binding sites within the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR), thereby attenuating the JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathway (15Matsumoto A. Masuhara M. Mitsui K. Yokouchi M. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyajima A. Yoshimura A. Blood. 1997; 89: 3148-3154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SOCS1 binds to the activation loop of JAKs via its SH2 domain and inhibits JAK kinase activity (16Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A. Wakioka T. Ohtsuka S. Imaizumi T. Matsuda T. Ihle J.N. Yoshimura A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). The detailed mechanism by which SOCS3 functions to inhibit JAK/STAT signaling has not been well characterized. Some studies have reported that SOCS3 could also bind to and directly inhibit JAKs (17Sasaki A. Yasukawa H. Suzuki A. Kamizono S. Syoda T. Kinjyo I. Sasaki M. Johnston J.A. Yoshimura A. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), whereas other reports suggest that it is necessary for SOCS3 to associate with the activated cytokine receptors to attenuate JAK/STAT signaling (18Nicholson S.E.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 2516-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). CUEDC2 is a CUE domain-containing protein. Previous work from our laboratory showed that CUEDC2 interacts with the progesterone receptor and promotes progesterone-induced proteasomal degradation of the progesterone receptor (23Zhang P.J. Zhao J. Li H.Y. Man J.H. He K. Zhou T. Pan X. Li A.L. Gong W.L. Jin B.F. Xia Q. Yu M. Shen B.F. Zhang X.M. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1831-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). More importantly, we found CUEDC2 is a crucial determinant of resistance to endocrine therapies in breast cancer through affecting estrogen receptor α protein stability (24Pan X. Zhou T. Tai Y.H. Wang C. Zhao J. Cao Y. Chen Y. Zhang P.J. Yu M. Zhen C. Mu R. Bai Z.F. Li H.Y. Li A.L. Liang B. Jian Z. Zhang W.N. Man J.H. Gao Y.F. Gong W.L. Wei L.X. Zhang X.M. Nat. Med. 2011; 17: 708-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These functions provide insight into the mechanism by which CUEDC2 regulates breast cancer cells. In this study, we demonstrate that CUEDC2 inhibits JAK1/STAT3 activation by attenuating their phosphorylation. In addition, we identify CUEDC2 as a novel SOCS3 binding partner that stabilizes SOCS3 protein, resulting in suppression of JAK1/STAT3 signaling. Therefore, our novel findings suggest that CUEDC2 cooperates with SOCS3 to suppress the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. HA-CUEDC2 full-length and truncated mutants were described as before (25Li H.Y. Liu H. Wang C.H. Zhang J.Y. Man J.H. Gao Y.F. Zhang P.J. Li W.H. Zhao J. Pan X. Zhou T. Gong W.L. Li A.L. Zhang X.M. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To generate bacterial expression vector for GST-CUEDC2 and the mutants, the corresponding CUEDC2 cDNAs (1–287, 1–133, 1–180,133–287, and 180–287 aa) were cloned in-frame into pGEX-KG vector (Amersham Biosciences). FLAG-SOCS3 and FLAG-SOCS3 (ΔSH2) were amplified by PCR from mammary library and cloned into pCDNA3.0 vector; other FLAG-SOCS3 deletion mutants were kindly provided by Dr. Fred Schaper (26Schmitz J.

FLAG-STAT3 constructs were obtained from Dr. Darnell Jr., and GST-STAT3 was from Dr. XinMin Cao. IFN-γ activating sequence reporter was gift from Dr. Geoffrey L. Greene. JAK1 expression plasmid was kindly provided from Dr. Claude Haan. To generate Gp130 expression construct, a DNA fragment containing the intracytoplasmic domain of gp130 was amplified by PCR and inserted into PXJ40-HA vector. HEK293T cells and HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% newborn calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. HepG2 cells were maintained in MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instruction. Luciferase assays were carried out using the luciferase kit (Promega, Madison, WI) as described by the manufacturer's instructions, and luciferase activities were determined using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). All experiments were repeated at least three times. For immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were lysed in E1A buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors. Immunoprecipitations were performed by incubating whole cell extracts with the indicated antibody and rocking at 4 °C for 6 h after the preincubating with protein A/G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),. Immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times and resuspended in 40 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer, then resolved by SDS-PAGE. All the samples for phosphorylation assays were prepared in M2 buffer. Mouse anti-HA antibody, rabbit anti-SOCS3 (sc-9023), and anti-STAT3 (sc-7179) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-FLAG (M2) (F3165) monoclonal antibody was from Sigma. Rabbit anti-pSTAT3 (Tyr-705) (#9131), anti-JAK1 (#3332), and anti-pJAK1 (#1022/1023) (#3331) were purchased from cell signaling technology. CUEDC2 monoclonal antibody and GAPDH and GFP polyclonal antibodies were prepared in our laboratory. GST and GST fusion proteins were expressed in DH5α and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare). FLAG-SOCS3 protein, obtained from the whole cell lysates of HEK293T cells, which were transfected with FLAG-SOCS3 and/or its mutants plasmids, were incubated with GST and GST-CUEDC2 or its truncate fusion protein bound to agarose beads in 1 ml of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing a protease inhibitor mixture at 4 °C for 6 h. Beads were then washed 3 times and resuspended in 30 μl of 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and detected by immunoblotting. The two small interfering RNAs (siRNA) that target CUEDC2 were purchased, respectively, from Invitrogen (#1, HSS149051) and Dharmacon (#2, J-014272-20); target sequences were, respectively, 5′-CCAAGAUGAGGCAACUGGCGCUGAG-3′ (#1) and 5′-CAUCAGAGGAGAACUUCGA-3′ (#2). For control siRNA against Photinus pyralis luciferase gene (Invitrogen), the target sequence was 5′-GGAUUUCGAGUCGUCUUAAUGUAUA-3′. Relative expression of endogenous CUEDC2 was detected by anti-CUEDC2 (from our laboratory). SOCS3 was selectively suppressed by using the RNA interference method, and the siRNA used for targeting human SOCS3 were: 5′-CCAAGAACCUGCGCATCCA-3′ and 5′-TGGATGCGCAGGTTCTTGG-3′ (29Komyod W. Böhm M. Metze D. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Mol. Cancer Res. 2007; 5: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The pSUPER retro shRNA retrovirus vector expressing CUEDC2 siRNA (target sequence 5′-GAAGCTGATCCGATACATC-3′; 5′- GTACATGATGGTGGATAGC-3′) were constructed by recombinant DNA technology. The packaging cells Phoenix (from ATCC) were transfected with these combinant plasmids using a liposome-based transfection method, and virus supernatant was collected and then infected into HeLa cells. The stable integrant was selected using G418 for 2 weeks. For HepG2 cell lines stably expressing CUEDC2, CUEDC2 cDNA was inserted into pBabe-retro-puro retrovirus vector. HepG2 cells were infected with virus supernatant from Phoenix cells transfected with pBabe-GFP or pBabe-CUEDC2, and stable integrant was selected with puromycin for 2 weeks. HeLa cells stably expressing CUEDC2 were described as before (25Li H.Y. Liu H. Wang C.H. Zhang J.Y. Man J.H. Gao Y.F. Zhang P.J. Li W.H. Zhao J. Pan X. Zhou T. Gong W.L. Li A.L. Zhang X.M. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). CUEDC2 interacts with progesterone receptor and estrogen receptor, leading to the ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of these two proteins (23Zhang P.J. Zhao J. Li H.Y. Man J.H. He K. Zhou T. Pan X. Li A.L. Gong W.L. Jin B.F. Xia Q. Yu M. Shen B.F. Zhang X.M. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 1831-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 24Pan X. Zhou T. Tai Y.H. Wang C. Zhao J.

Med. 2011; 17: 708-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the function of CUEDC2 and elucidate other potential roles of CUEDC2 in cytokine-mediated signal transduction, we investigated whether CUEDC2 regulates other transcription factors that are also ubiquitinated. To investigate this possibility, reporter gene assays were used to determine the effect of CUEDC2 on the transcriptional activity of various transcription factors. STAT3 activity was shown to be affected by CUEDC2 in a screening assay. 5W.-N. Zhang, L. Wang, Q. Wang, X. Luo, D.-F. Fang, Y. Chen., X. Pan, J.-H. Man, Q. Xia, B.-F. Jin, W.-H. Li, T. Li, B. Liang, L. Chen, W.-L. Gong, M. Yu, A.-L. Li, T. Zhou, and H.-Y Li, unpublished data. As shown in Fig. 1A, HEK293T cells were transfected with pACT-Luc (a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the promoter of α1-antichymotrypsin that is has two STAT3 binding sites) (27Rödel B. Tavassoli K. Karsunky H. Schmidt T. Bachmann M. Schaper F. Heinrich P. Shuai K. Elsässer H.P. Möröy T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5845-5855Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and an increasing dose of HA-CUEDC2 constructs. Results show that CUEDC2 clearly inhibits IFN-α-induced STAT3 transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner. Similar results were also obtained in HeLa cells (supplemental Fig. 1A). To further confirm the role of endogenous CUEDC2 in STAT3 transcriptional activation, CUEDC2 expression was knocked down using two different siRNA in HEK293T cells. As anticipated, IFN-α-induced STAT3 activation was higher in CUEDC2 knockdown cells compared with control cells. Western blot analysis demonstrates that both of the two CUEDC2 siRNA, but not control siRNA, specifically reduced the expression of endogenous CUEDC2 (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. 1B). To exclude the nonspecific effect that may be caused by the α1-antichymotrypsin reporter gene, the same experiments were performed by using other STAT3-responsive luciferase reporter constructs of GAS (IFN-γ-activating sequence) reporter and m67 reporter (a synthetic STAT3-responsive promoter) (31Leong H. Mathur P.S. Greene G.L. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2009; 117: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 32Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar), and the results showed that CUEDC2 also inhibits the expression of these two reporters in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. 1C). To test the specificity of CUEDC2 on STAT3 activation, a luciferase reporter construct (4× interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1)) containing four copies of the STAT binding sequence from the IRF-1 gene were used (33Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Cells cotransfected with STAT3 and (4× IRF-1) reporter showed a 200-fold increase of luciferase expression upon IFN-α treatment. In keeping with the above data, expression of CUEDC2 strongly inhibited IFN-α-induced STAT3-dependent gene expression. However, CUEDC2 had no such inhibitory effect on STAT1-mediated transcriptional activation in response to IFN-α (Fig. 1, D and E), indicating that CUEDC2 specifically inhibits STAT3 transcriptional activity. Because STAT3 is also the major mediator of IL-6 signaling, it was next investigated whether CUEDC2 plays a role in IL-6-mediated STAT3 activation. As shown in Fig. 1F, CUEDC2 expression decreases IL-6-induced STAT3 activation in HepG2 cells. Notably, our results also demonstrate that CUEDC2 can inhibit STAT3 activation triggered by forced expression of JAK1 or the intracytoplasmic domain of cell surface receptor glycoprotein 130 (gp130) (Fig. 1G). These data suggest that CUEDC2-mediated suppression of STAT3 activation is not restricted to a particular stimulation but may be a general mechanism of STAT3 regulation. Phosphorylation of STAT3 at specific residues, particularly Tyr-705, is necessary for its activation. Therefore, it was next determined whether CUEDC2 inhibits STAT3 activity through affecting its phosphorylation. To this end, either HA-CUEDC2 or control vectors were co-transfected with FLAG-STAT3 into HEK293T cells. Time course analysis of STAT3 phosphorylation demonstrates that, in response to IFN-α treatment, the amount of phosphorylated STAT3 increased substantially in the cells transfected with a control vector (HA vector); in contrast, this phosphorylation of STAT3 was markedly decreased in cells transfected with the CUEDC2 vector (HA-CUEDC2) (Fig. 2A). To analyze the phosphorylation status of endogenous STAT3, HeLa cells stably expressing FLAG-CUEDC2 (HeLa/CUEDC2) or the control vector (HeLa/Vector) were treated with or without IFN-α for the indicated times, and cell lysate was resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis. The results show that IFN-α-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 was much less in cells expressing CUEDC2 compared with control cells. Levels of total STAT3 protein were similar in both samples (Fig. 2B). Next we examined the influence of CUEDC2 on IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation. In keeping with the luciferase reporter assay results, IL-6-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr-705 was also reduced in HepG2 cells stably expressing CUEDC2 (HepG2/CUEDC2) compared with control cells expressing GFP (HepG2/GFP) (Fig. 2C). However, inhibition of CUEDC2 by siRNA in HepG2 cells led to an elevated level of phosphorylated STAT3 (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, the impact of CUEDC2 on JAK1 phosphorylation was also investigated in HeLa cells because of its major role in STAT3 activation. The results showed that, just as STAT3, IFN-α-induced JAK1 phosphorylation was lower in cells stably expressing CUEDC2 compared with the control cells (Fig. 2E). Consistent with these results, phosphorylation levels of JAK1 and STAT3 were elevated when CUEDC2 was knocked down by shRNA(#1) in HeLa cells (Fig. 2F). To rule out the off-target effect, we tested the kinetics of JAK1 and STAT3 phosphorylation with a different CUEDC2 shRNA(#2), and the same results were also obtained (Fig. 2G). Thus, these data indicate that CUEDC2 inhibits the phosphorylation of JAK1 and STAT3 and thus attenuates STAT3 transcriptional activation.FIGURE 1CUEDC2 inhibits STAT3 transcriptional activity. A, HEK293T cells were transiently transfected in a 12-well plate with pACT luciferase reporter (200 ng), FLAG-STAT3 (200 ng), and increasing amounts of HA-CUEDC2 vectors (0, 200, and 500 ng) as indicated. 24 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with IFN-α (50 ng/ml) for an additional 6 h, and luciferase activity was measured. Renilla reporter pRL-TK (20 ng/well) vectors were used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. B, HEK 293T cells were transfected with control siRNA or the two different CUEDC2 siRNAs (20 nm) (#1 and #2). 24 h later pACT-Luc and FLAG-STAT3 plasmids were cotransfected as in A. After another 24 h, cells were treated with IFN-α for 6 h, and luciferase reporter assays were performed. C, HEK293T cells were transfected the same as in A, except the luciferase reporter gene was replaced by STAT3 responsive IFN-γ activating sequence reporter (500 ng/well). D and E, HEK293T cells were transfected with 4× IRF-1 luciferase reporter (500 ng/well) construct and STAT3 or STAT1(200 ng/well) together with or without CUEDC2 as indicated. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were left untreated (open columns) or treated with IFN-α (50 ng/ml) for 6 h, and luciferase activity was determined. F, HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with pACT-Luc (200 ng/well) together with increasing amounts of CUEDC2 vectors; 24 h after transfection cells were starved for 16–18 h in MEM with 0.5% serum then treated with IL-6 (100 ng/ml) for another 6 h, and luciferase activity was measured.G, JAK1 or glycoprotein 130 (gp130) expression vectors (200 ng/well) were co-transfected with pACT-Luc, FLAG-STAT3, and HA-CUEDC2 (or HA-vector) into HEK293T cells; 24 h later cells were harvested and detected for luciferase activity. All the results are the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because CUEDC2 inhibits JAK1 and STAT3 phosphorylation and the subsequent STAT3 transcriptional activity, was next determined whether CUEDC2 directly interacts with JAK1 and/or STAT3. However, we found that no association was observed between CUEDC2 and either JAK1 or STAT3, although the positive controls (JAK1 interacts with SOCS1 and STAT3 interacts with PIAS3) in the same assay worked well (supplemental Fig. 2) (33Chung C.D.

This indicates that CUEDC2 inhibits JAK1/STAT3 signaling by recruiting some other essential molecules. To further explore how CUEDC2 mediates JAK1 and STAT3 inhibition, it was determined whether SOCS or SHP (the SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase) family members, which are key negative regulators of JAK/STAT signaling, interact with CUEDC2 in a yeast strain, AH109, by performing β-galactosidase assays. Interestingly, out of all the proteins tested, CUEDC2 only interacts with SOCS3 (Fig. 3A). The specificity of the interaction between CUEDC2 and SOCS3 was further confirmed by GST pulldown assays. Results show that substantial amounts of SOCS3 were pulled down by GST-CUEDC2 but not by GST alone (Fig. 3B, upper panel). Additionally, SOCS1, another member of the SOCS family proteins, could bind neither GST nor GST-CUEDC2 (Fig. 3B, lower panel). These results suggest that CUEDC2 specifically associates with SOCS3 in vitro. To further verify this interaction in eukaryotic cells, HA-CUEDC2 and FLAG-SOCS3 were co-expressed into HEK293T cells, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with anti-FLAG antibody and followed by Western blot analysis. Again, data show that CUEDC2 associates with SOCS3 specifically (Fig. 3C). As data from Fig. 3, A–C, demonstrate that these two proteins interact was performed with exogenous protein expression, we next examined whether CUEDC2 and SOCS3 interact under physiological conditions, To do so, cell extracts from HeLa cells were prepared, and immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-CUEDC2 antibody or mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) control. Precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using SOCS3 antibody. As shown in Fig. 3D, SOCS3 was detected in the immunoprecipitates obtained from cell extracts with antibody to CUEDC2 (anti-CUEDC2) but not with control IgG. Collectively, these data indicate that CUEDC2 interacts with SOCS3 in vitro and in vivo. To delineate which region of CUEDC2 was responsible for association with SOCS3, a series of GST-CUEDC2 deletion mutants was constructed (Fig. 4A), and GST pulldown assays were performed in HEK293T cells. As indicated in Fig. 4B, only wild type CUEDC2 and the carboxyl-terminal region of CUEDC2 (133–287 aa) interacted with SOCS3; none of the other CUEDC2 mutants (1–133, 1–180, and 180–287aa) was enough to bind SOCS3. Therefore, these results revealed that association of CUEDC2 and SOCS3 requires the carboxyl-terminal region including the CUE domain. To analyze the binding domains of SOCS3 in better detail, SOCS3 deletion mutants, respectively, lacking the 23 amino-terminal amino acids (SOCS3 ΔN), the amino-terminal region identified as an extension of the SH2 domain (SOCS3 ΔESS), the SH2 domain (SOCS3 ΔSH2) and the carboxyl-terminal SOCS-box (SOCS3 ΔBox) were generated (Fig. 4C).

In this study, evidence is provided that the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) is a key downstream effector of G12 on this pathway. Expression of constitutively-active Gα12 or activation of G12 signaling by thrombin leads to increased JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation. Pharmacologic inhibition of JNK or knockdown of JNK expression by siRNA significantly decreases G12-induced JNK activation as well as the ability of breast cancer cells to invade a reconstituted basement membrane. Furthermore, expression of dominant-negative Rho or treatment of cells with an inhibitor of the Rho kinase, ROCK, reduces G12-induced JNK and c-Jun activation, and ROCK inhibitor treatment also inhibits G12-induced cellular invasion. JNK knockdown or ROCK inhibitor treatment has no effect on activation of Rho by G12. Taken together, our data indicate that JNK activation is required for G12-induced invasion of breast cancer cells and that JNK is downstream of Rho and ROCK on this pathway. This study implicates a G12-stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade in cancer cell invasion, and supports a role for JNK in cancer progression."

We hypothesized that sequestrant-induced changes in hepatic glucose metabolism would underlie reduced plasma glucose levels. Therefore, in vivo glucose metabolism was assessed in db/db mice on and off BAS using tracer methodology.Lean and diabetic db/db mice were treated with 2% (wt/wt in diet) Colesevelam HCl (BAS) for 2 weeks. Parameters of in vivo glucose metabolism were assessed by infusing [U-(13)C]-glucose, [2-(13)C]-glycerol, [1-(2)H]-galactose and paracetamol for 6 hours, followed by mass isotopologue distribution analysis, and related to metabolic parameters as well as gene expression patterns.Compared to lean mice, db/db mice displayed an almost 3-fold lower metabolic clearance rate of glucose (p = 0.0001), a ∼300% increased glucokinase flux (p = 0.001) and a ∼200% increased total hepatic glucose production rate (p = 0.0002). BAS treatment increased glucose metabolic clearance rate by ∼37% but had no effects on glucokinase flux nor total hepatic or endogenous glucose production. Strikingly, BAS-treated db/db mice displayed reduced long-chain acylcarnitine content in skeletal muscle (p = 0.0317) but not in liver (p = 0.189). Unexpectedly, BAS treatment increased hepatic FGF21 mRNA expression 2-fold in lean mice (p = 0.030) and 3-fold in db/db mice (p = 0.002).BAS induced plasma glucose lowering in db/db mice by increasing metabolic clearance rate of glucose in peripheral tissues, which coincided with decreased skeletal muscle long-chain acylcarnitine content."
https://openalex.org/W2096213488,"Protein palmitoylation is a major dynamic posttranslational regulator of protein function. However, mechanisms that control palmitoylation are poorly understood. In many proteins, palmitoylation occurs at cysteine residues juxtaposed to membrane-anchoring domains such as transmembrane helices, sites of irreversible lipid modification, or hydrophobic and/or polybasic domains. In particular, polybasic domains represent an attractive mechanism to dynamically control protein palmitoylation, as the function of these domains can be dramatically influenced by protein phosphorylation. Here we demonstrate that a polybasic domain immediately upstream of palmitoylated cysteine residues within an alternatively spliced insert in the C terminus of the large conductance calcium- and voltage-activated potassium channel is an important determinant of channel palmitoylation and function. Mutation of basic amino acids to acidic residues within the polybasic domain results in inhibition of channel palmitoylation and a significant right-shift in channel half maximal voltage for activation. Importantly, protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of a single serine residue within the core of the polybasic domain, which results in channel inhibition, also reduces channel palmitoylation. These data demonstrate the key role of the polybasic domain in controlling stress-regulated exon palmitoylation and suggests that phosphorylation controls the domain by acting as an electrostatic switch.

These data demonstrate the key role of the polybasic domain in controlling stress-regulated exon palmitoylation and suggests that phosphorylation controls the domain by acting as an electrostatic switch. Protein S-palmitoylation is emerging as a major posttranslational modification to control a wide diversity of proteins, including ion channels (1Fukata Y. Fukata M. Nat. Rev.

Protein S-palmitoylation results in the covalent linkage of the Cys-16 fatty acid palmitate to a cysteine residue via a thioester bond in a target protein. The reversible addition of palmitate may increase protein hydrophobicity and, therefore, can facilitate association of protein domains with the plasma membrane, regulation of signaling, and control of protein trafficking (1Fukata Y.

Sites of palmitoylation appear to have no canonical consensus sequence that can readily identify target cysteine residues within a protein. However, it is thought that additional membrane-targeting domains are required to be closely associated with sites of palmitoylation to allow efficient palmitoylation by the membrane-associated acyl palmitoyltransferases (zDHHCs) 3The abbreviations used are: zDHHCacyl protein palmitoyl transferase gene familyBKlarge conductance calcium- and voltage- activated potassium channelSTREXstress-regulated exonBHbasic hydrophobicCSSclustering and scoring strategyPKAcAMP-dependent protein kinaseRCKregulator of potassium conductanceV0.5MAXvoltage for half maximal conductance.

The role of polybasic domains adjacent to sites of palmitoylation is particularly intriguing as a potential mechanism to dynamically control palmitoylation of a target protein. For example, clusters of basic residues in proteins can function independently as membrane-targeting signals (10Heo W.D. Inoue T. Park W.S. Kim M.L. Park B.O. Wandless T.J. Meyer T. Science. 2006; 314: 1458-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), and in several proteins, basic residues adjacent to palmitoylated cysteine residues have been shown to be important for efficient palmitoylation, most likely by controlling cysteine reactivity (11Bélanger C.

Importantly, the electrostatic interactions of polybasic domains (either with phospholipids in the intracellular leaflet of the plasma membrane or acidic domains of proteins) may provide a dynamic mechanism for control of palmitoylation through reversible modification of local charge by other posttranslational modifications, such as protein phosphorylation. Thus, polybasic domains of proteins may represent an important, reversible role in the regulation of protein palmitoylation. We recently identified that the intracellular C terminus of the large conductance voltage- and calcium-activated (BK) channel is palmitoylated within the alternatively spliced stress-regulated exon (STREX) (14Tian L.

This C-terminal site of palmitoylation (cysteine residues C645:C646, Fig. 1) is not located close to a transmembrane domain, unlike the constitutively expressed palmitoylation site located in the S0-S1 linker (15Jeffries O.

However, immediately upstream of the palmitoylated cysteines, a series of basic residues form a putative polybasic domain (Fig. 1) that may act as a potential additional membrane-targeting signal. Moreover, a serine residue (Ser-636) located at the midpoint of the polybasic domain has been shown previously to be a target for protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Ser-636 results in channel inhibition (16Tian L. Coghill L.S. McClafferty H. MacDonald S.H. Antoni F.A. Ruth P. Knaus H.G. Shipston M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In this work, we demonstrate that the polybasic region immediately upstream of the palmitoylated cysteine residues in the BK channel C terminus is an important determinant of BK channel palmitoylation. Mutation of basic residues to acidic residues results in a significant reduction in STREX palmitoylation, a significant right-shift in channel voltage for half-maximal activation, as well as reducing cell surface expression.

Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed, and 1 ml of fresh DMEM containing 10 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA was added for 30 min at 37 °C. DMEM/BSA-containing 0.5 mCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid was added for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed, lysed, and channel fusion proteins were captured by using magnetic microbeads coupled to the HA antibody (μMACS epitope tag isolation kits, Miltenyi Biotec). Proteins were then eluted in SDS/PAGE sample buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 5 mm DTT, 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 0.005% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol) prewarmed to 95 °C. The recovered samples were separated by SDS/PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with a polyclonal HA antibody (1:1000; Zymed Laboratories, Inc.). A duplicate membrane was exposed to light-sensitive film at −80 °C by using a Kodak Biomax transcreen LE (Amersham Biosciences). Single channel recordings and macropatch recordings were performed in the excised inside-out configuration of the patch-clamp technique at room temperature. The pipette solution (extracellular) contained 140 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 0.1 μm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm glucose, and 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.3). The bath solution (intracellular) contained 140 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes, (pH 7.3) with intracellular free calcium buffered using 1 mm BAPTA (1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid) or dibromo-BAPTA over a range of < 10 nm to 10 μm [Ca2+]. Channel activity was determined during 100-ms step depolarizations over a voltage range from −120 mV to +120 mV in 20-mV increments from a holding potential of −80 mV. Tail currents were then examined and normalized to the peak current (100%) in 1 or 10 μm Ca2+ and plotted as G/GMAX corresponding to channel activity. Voltage sensitivity was determined by a logarithmic transformation linearizing the activating component of the normalized (G/GMAX) curves in 0.33 μm Ca2+. Data acquisition and voltage protocols were controlled by an Axopatch 200B amplifier and pCLAMP9 software (Axon Instruments). All recordings were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz. Channel activity was allowed to stabilize for at least 10 min after patch excision before recording. A basic hydrophobicity (BH) scale algorithm (20Brzeska H. Guag J. Remmert K. Chacko S. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 5738-5747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was used to identify potential membrane binding sites in the C terminus of the BK channel by entering the entire C-terminal sequence with respective mutant channels and selecting a window size of 19. A threshold value of 0.6 was identified as the optimal parameter for identifying lipid-binding sites in proteins. We used the published CSS-palm palmitoylation algorithm (21Ren J. Wen L. Gao X. Jin C. Xue Y. Yao X. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2008; 21: 639-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 22Zhou F. Xue Y. Yao X. Xu Y. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 894-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), to predict cysteine residues within the C-terminal coding sequence of the murine BK channel. Sequences were analyzed with CSS-palm v2.0.4. The palmitoylation prediction threshold was set to the highest cutoff. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism or Igor Pro using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey and/or Newman-Keuls post hoc tests for significance between groups. Incorporation of the STREX splice insert at the C2 site of alternative splicing (Fig. 1A) generates a cluster of 11 basic amino acid residues of 21 (Lys-623 to Arg-R643) that may form a polybasic domain. Sequence alignment of these positively charged amino acids just upstream of the previously identified C-terminal STREX palmitoylation site (C645:C646) (14Tian L. Jeffries O. McClafferty H. Molyvdas A. Rowe I.C. Saleem F. Chen L. Greaves J. Chamberlain L.H. Knaus H.G. Ruth P. Shipston M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Using a BH algorithm that can identify potential membrane binding sites in less structured regions of proteins (20Brzeska H. Guag J. Remmert K. Chacko S. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 5738-5747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the potential of the polybasic domain to function as a membrane-targeting domain was determined. Examination of the intracellular STREX C terminus (S6:STREX) sequence identified the polybasic domain as a potential membrane interaction site, with maximum values recorded between residues 633–635 of 1.05 (Fig. 2A). To define basic residues that would disrupt the membrane-targeting function of the polybasic domain identified by the BH algorithm, point mutations of basic residues in two distinct regions of the polybasic domain were identified. Mutation of two basic residues to negatively charged acidic residues either in the distal basic region immediately upstream of the STREX insert, Lys-627 and Arg-631, or in the proximal basic region within the STREX insert, Arg-640 and Arg-642, decreased the BH probability score for the peak plasma membrane interaction site to 0.63 (K627E:R631E) and 0.84 (R640E:R642E) (Fig. 2, B and C). Mutation with neutral (alanine) residues reduced but did not abolish the membrane interaction prediction. BH scores were 0.82 (K627A:R631A) and 0.91 (R640A:R642A). Furthermore, deletion of the downstream basic residues in the STREX insert (by using the insertless ZERO channel C terminus sequence (S6:ZERO) in which the STREX insert is excluded) also abolished the predicted membrane interaction score, suggesting that the upstream region (six basic residues) alone does not function as a polybasic domain (Fig. 2D). Thus, basic residues immediately upstream (distal) and within STREX (proximal) are required to generate a putative polybasic domain. Mutation of the previously identified palmitoylated cysteines within STREX, which are essential for plasma membrane association of the STREX C-terminal domain (14Tian L. Jeffries O. McClafferty H.

Expression of the STREX C terminus (S6:STREX) in HEK293 cells resulted in robust localization of the GFP fusion construct at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3, A and B). Site-directed mutagenesis was undertaken to disrupt the basic charge within the polybasic domain by substituting basic residues with negatively charged (glutamic acid) amino acids and to neutralize the basic charge by substituting with neutrally charged (alanine) amino acids. In the distal region of the polybasic domain, just upstream of the STREX insert, substitution with negative (glutamic acid) residues (K627E:R631E) or neutral (alanine) residues (K627A:R631A) decreased membrane targeting to 6.3% and 26.5% of the wild-type S6:STREX membrane expression, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B), with the fluorescent fusion proteins now located predominantly within the nucleus. Mutation of the basic region proximal to the previously identified palmitoylation site in STREX with negative (glutamic acid) residues (R640E:R642E) also abolished membrane targeting to 0.8%, with targeting again redirected to the nucleus. However, mutation of these proximal basic residues to neutral (alanine) residues (R640A:R642A) demonstrated that fluorescence at the plasma membrane actually increased to 160% of the control S6:STREX value (Fig. 3, A and B). Nuclear localization was also substantially decreased in the (R640A:R642A) mutant, with only 11.5% of cells also showing fluorescence in the nucleus. Therefore, distinct regions of the polybasic domain appear to play an important role in controlling localization of the STREX C terminus at the plasma membrane. Mutation of the two palmitoylated cysteine residues to alanine (C645A:C646A) essentially abolishes plasma membrane association of the S6:STREX construct (14Tian L. Jeffries O. McClafferty H. Molyvdas A. Rowe I.C. Saleem F. Chen L. Greaves J. Chamberlain L.H. Knaus H.G. Ruth P. Shipston M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 21006-21011Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) suggesting that the polybasic domain per se is not sufficient for stable plasma membrane association. Thus, to address whether inhibition of membrane association of the STREX C terminus upon disruption of the polybasic domain results from a change in palmitoylation status of the STREX domain, we examined radiolabeled [3H]palmitate incorporation in the polybasic mutant constructs expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 4A). STREX C terminus (S6:STREX) was robustly palmitoylated by endogenous acyl palmitoyltransferases. Disruption of the polybasic domain by substituting negatively charged (glutamic acid) residues in both identified regions of the polybasic domain (K627E:R631E and R640E:R642E) effectively abolished [3H]palmitate incorporation. Neutral (alanine) substitution of the region distal to STREX (K627A:R631A) also substantially reduced [3H]palmitate incorporation to ∼30% of S6:STREX. These data suggest that the polybasic domain must play an important role in regulating the palmitoylation status of the C645A:C646A palmitoylation motif. Interestingly, the R640A:R642A STREX C-terminal mutant demonstrated an increased level of palmitoylation to ∼390% of S6:STREX. Therefore, neutral substitution of basic residues in the region closest to the identified palmitoylation motif within STREX can increase palmitoylation of the C-terminal constructs in agreement with the imaging experiments (Fig. 3, A and B). This suggests that these different polybasic mutations may be reporting differences in local structure/folding required for efficient palmitoylation and membrane trafficking of the S6:STREX C-terminal construct. Robust expression in Western blot analysis demonstrated that the change in palmitoylation status of the channel constructs was not the result of altered synthesis or degradation of the C terminus channel fusion proteins (Fig. 4A). We showed previously that phosphorylation of a conserved serine residue (Ser-636, Figs. 1B and 3A) results in dissociation of the STREX domain from the plasma membrane, leading to channel inhibition (14Tian L. Jeffries O. McClafferty H. Molyvdas A. Rowe I.C. Saleem F. Chen L. Greaves J. Chamberlain L.H. Knaus H.G. Ruth P. Shipston M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 21006-21011Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The Ser-636 residue is a PKA consensus site located close to the midpoint of the polybasic domain and immediately upstream of the cysteine palmitoylation motif (C645:C646). As phosphorylation of Ser-636 would introduce a negative charge into the otherwise polybasic region, we hypothesized that phosphorylation of Ser-636 may act as an electrostatic switch to control palmitoylation of the STREX domain and its association with the plasma membrane. To test this, we generated a phosphomimetic mutation with a negatively charged glutamic acid residue at the Ser-636 site. This phosphomimetic mutation, S636E, slightly reduced the BH probability score for the domain to 0.95, suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser-636 may disrupt the functional polybasic domain. Phosphomimetic substitution essentially abolished C-terminal localization of the STREX C terminus at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3, A and C), with membrane expression of S636E at 0.8 ± 0.3% of the wild-type STREX C terminus (C). A negatively charged aspartic acid residue had the same effect, abolishing STREX C-terminal localization at the plasma membrane (1.3 ± 0.4% of the wild-type STREX C terminus). To establish whether this is a charge-specific effect, as would be predicted if phosphorylation of Ser-636 was acting as an electrostatic switch upon introducing a negative charge, we also mutated Ser-636 to a neutral alanine or positively charged lysine residue. Although both the alanine and lysine mutations reduced membrane expression of the STREX C terminus, this was only by 52 ± 2.9% and 49.5 ± 3.6%, respectively, compared with the abolition of membrane expression with the phosphomimetic glutamic acid and aspartic acid mutants. This supports a model in which phosphorylation of Ser-636 acts as an electrostatic switch. However, we cannot exclude that mutation of Ser-636 per se does not also result in changes in local structure/folding. In support of this, conservative mutation of Ser-636 to threonine had no effect on STREX C terminus membrane expression. However, as both serine and threonine could be phosphorylated by PKA in vivo, an alternative explanation could be that cycles of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation are also important for trafficking of the isolated STREX C terminus to the plasma membrane. To determine whether phosphorylation of Ser-636 could control palmitoylation of the C645:C646 site, we examined palmitoylation in both the STREX C terminus and full-length channel constructs. The S636E phosphomimetic mutation significantly reduced [3H]palmitate incorporation into STREX C-terminal constructs (Fig. 4B) without affecting protein expression, suggesting that Ser-636 phosphorylation is important for controlling palmitoylation of STREX. We also examined the effect of the S636E phosphomimetic mutation in full-length STREX channels in which the constitutively expressed palmitoylated cysteine residues located in the S0-S1 linker (15Jeffries O. Geiger N. Rowe I.C. Tian L. McClafferty H. Chen L. Bi D. Knaus H.G. Ruth P. Shipston M.J. J. Biol.

This allowed the effect of the S636E mutation on palmitoylation of the STREX domain alone to be analyzed in the intact channel. In the full-length STREX channel with the S0-S1 palmitoylation sites mutated to alanine (STREX*), palmitoylation was robust, demonstrating efficient palmitoylation of the STREX insert. However, channels with the S636E phosphomimetic mutation (S636E*) displ"

Furthermore, interactions among delay-induced oscillations can generate complex collective rhythms, which play important functional roles. However, due to their intrinsic infinite dimensionality, theoretical analysis of interacting delay-induced oscillations has been limited. Here, we show that the two primary methods for finite-dimensional limit cycles, namely, the center manifold reduction in the vicinity of the Hopf bifurcation and the phase reduction for weak interactions, can successfully be applied to interacting infinite-dimensional delay-induced oscillations. We systematically derive the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation and the phase equation without delay for general interaction networks. Based on the reduced low-dimensional equations, we demonstrate that diffusive (linearly attractive) coupling between a pair of delay-induced oscillations can exhibit nontrivial amplitude death and multimodal phase locking. Our analysis provides unique insights into experimentally observed EEG activities such as sudden transitions among different phase-locked states and occurrence of epileptic seizures."
https://openalex.org/W2024026320,"Muscle cells, including human airway smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) express ankyrin repeat protein 1 (Ankrd1), a member of ankyrin repeat protein family. Ankrd1 efficiently interacts with the type III intermediate filament desmin. Our earlier study showed that desmin is an intracellular load-bearing protein that influences airway compliance, lung recoil, and airway contractile responsiveness. These results suggest that Ankrd1 and desmin may play important roles on ASMC homeostasis. Here we show that small interfering (si)RNA-mediated knockdown of the desmin gene in HASMCs, recombinant HASMCs (reHASMCs), up-regulates Ankrd1 expression. Moreover, loss of desmin in HASMCs increases the phosphorylation of Akt, inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK)-α, and inhibitor of κB (IκB)-α proteins, leading to NF-κB activation. Treatment of reHASMCs with Akt, IKKα, IκBα, or NF-κB inhibitor inhibits the loss of desmin-induced Ankrd1 up-regulation, suggesting Akt/NF-κB-mediated Ankrd1 regulation. Transfection of reHASMCs with siRNA specific for p50 or p65 corroborates the NF-κB-mediated Ankrd1 regulation. Luciferase reporter assays show that NF-κB directly binds on Ankrd1 promoter and up-regulates Ankrd1 levels. Overall, our data provide a new link between desmin and Ankrd1 regulation, which may be important for ASMC homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2088909757,"Background The recent outbreak of severe infections with Shiga toxin (Stx) producing Escherichia coli (STEC) serotype O104:H4 highlights the need to understand horizontal gene transfer among E. coli strains, identify novel virulence factors and elucidate their pathogenesis. Quantitative shotgun proteomics can contribute to such objectives, allowing insights into the part of the genome translated into proteins and the connectivity of biochemical pathways and higher order assemblies of proteins at the subcellular level. Methodology/Principal Findings We examined protein profiles in cell lysate fractions of STEC strain 86-24 (serotype O157:H7), following growth in cell culture or bacterial isolation from intestines of infected piglets, in the context of functionally and structurally characterized biochemical pathways of E. coli. Protein solubilization in the presence of Triton X-100, EDTA and high salt was followed by size exclusion chromatography into the approximate Mr ranges greater than 280 kDa, 280-80 kDa and 80-10 kDa. Peptide mixtures resulting from these and the insoluble fraction were analyzed by quantitative 2D-LC-nESI-MS/MS. Of the 2521 proteins identified at a 1% false discovery rate, representing 47% of all predicted E. coli O157:H7 gene products, the majority of integral membrane proteins were enriched in the high Mr fraction. Hundreds of proteins were enriched in a Mr range higher than that predicted for a monomer supporting their participation in protein complexes. The insoluble STEC fraction revealed enrichment of aggregation-prone proteins, including many that are part of large structure/function entities such as the ribosome, cytoskeleton and O-antigen biosynthesis cluster. Significance Nearly all E. coli O157:H7 proteins encoded by prophage regions were expressed at low abundance levels or not detected. Comparative quantitative analyses of proteins from distinct cell lysate fractions allowed us to associate uncharacterized proteins with membrane attachment, potential participation in stable protein complexes, and susceptibility to aggregation as part of larger structural assemblies."
https://openalex.org/W1993072398,"GpW is a 68-residue protein from bacteriophage λ that participates in virus head morphogenesis. Previous NMR studies revealed a novel α+β fold for this protein. Recent experiments have shown that gpW folds in microseconds by crossing a marginal free energy barrier (i.e., downhill folding). These features make gpW a highly desirable target for further experimental and computational folding studies. As a step in that direction, we have re-determined the high-resolution structure of gpW by multidimensional NMR on a construct that eliminates the purification tags and unstructured C-terminal tail present in the prior study. In contrast to the previous work, we have obtained a full manual assignment and calculated the structure using only unambiguous distance restraints. This new structure confirms the α+β topology, but reveals important differences in tertiary packing. Namely, the two α-helices are rotated along their main axis to form a leucine zipper. The β-hairpin is orthogonal to the helical interface rather than parallel, displaying most tertiary contacts through strand 1. There also are differences in secondary structure: longer and less curved helices and a hairpin that now shows the typical right-hand twist. Molecular dynamics simulations starting from both gpW structures, and calculations with CS-Rosetta, all converge to our gpW structure. This confirms that the original structure has strange tertiary packing and strained secondary structure. A comparison of NMR datasets suggests that the problems were mainly caused by incomplete chemical shift assignments, mistakes in NOE assignment and the inclusion of ambiguous distance restraints during the automated procedure used in the original study. The new gpW corrects these problems, providing the appropriate structural reference for future work. Furthermore, our results are a cautionary tale against the inclusion of ambiguous experimental information in the determination of protein structures."
https://openalex.org/W1998723112,"We previously reported that the combinatorial use of T20 and T1144, the first and next generations of HIV fusion inhibitors, containing different functional domains resulted in synergistic anti-HIV-1 effect, but this effect diminished when T20 and T1144 were covalently linked together. To elucidate the mechanism underlying this synergistic anti-HIV-1 effect, we studied the interactions between T20 and T1144 either in a mixture state or in a covalently linked state. T20 alone in solution was largely featureless, while T1144 alone was in α-helical trimeric conformation. When mixed in solution, T20 and T1144 showed a loose and transient interaction, with a moderate 10% α-helical content increase, but this interaction was greatly enhanced in the linked state, and T20 and T1144 showed ∼100% α-helical content. These results suggested that the loose and transient interaction between T20 and T1144 may destabilize the T1144 trimer, which makes its otherwise shielded binding sites more accessible to N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) and increases its associating rate, thus increasing its anti-HIV-1 potency against the temporarily exposed target in NHR and causing the synergistic anti-HIV-1 effect. However, the strong interaction between T20 and T1144 in the covalently linked state may shield their NHR-binding sites, resulting in reduction of the synergistic effect."

Inflammation is a host response to infection important for pathogen elimination but that also leads to tissue injury that must be repaired. Accordingly, this response must be tightly regulated as aberrant, or excessive inflammation can also result in tissue injury caused by responding leukocytes (1Laskin D.L. Sunil V.R. Gardner C.R. Laskin J.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2011; 51: 267-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Moreover, prolonged pro-inflammatory stimulation or an inability to resolve acute inflammation can contribute to the pathogenesis of a number of diseases that include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, cancer, atherosclerosis, and autoimmunity (2Nathan C. Ding A. Cell. 2010; 140: 871-882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). With regards to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, continual stimulation through repeated cigarette smoke exposure leads to chronic inflammation that is perpetuated even years after cigarette smoke exposure has terminated (3Retamales I. Elliott W.M. Meshi B. Coxson H.O. Pare P.D. Sciurba F.C. Rogers R.M. Hayashi S. Hogg J.C. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 164: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Thus, defining the molecular pathways that lead to inflammation, and the identification of possible points of intervention in these pathways is warranted. The acute inflammatory response to pathogens initiates with tissue injury and/or exposure of pathogen-derived ligands that engage toll-like receptors expressed on resident tissue macrophages. Macrophages are innate immune cells that reside in diverse tissues and provide sentinel responses against pathogens or noxious substances by the production of pro-inflammatory vasoactive lipids, cytokines, and chemokines (4Medzhitov R.

An immediate consequence of this tissue macrophage response is the recruitment of neutrophils that within hours release their granule contents at the site of infection in attempt to eradicate or neutralize pathogens. However, this response can also lead to local tissue injury.

In tissues, macrophages use integrins to adhere to integrin ligands found in extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (e.g. collagen and fibronectin) or expressed on the cell surface of other cells (e.g. intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1). The adhesion of myeloid cells to ECM integrin ligands has repeatedly been shown to promote production of many pro-inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and multiple MMPs (6de Fougerolles A.R.

Although the production of prostaglandins is known to be dependent on cyclooxygenase activity, the integrin signaling pathways macrophages use to produce other pro-inflammatory mediators are not well understood, although mitogen-activated protein kinases, Src family, and Pyk2 nonreceptor tyrosine kinases are implicated in integrin signaling (6de Fougerolles A.R.

Arhgef1 (Lsc/p115RhoGEF) is an intracellular signaling molecule with expression predominantly restricted to hematopoietic cells. Arhgef1 has been biochemically and functionally characterized as both a regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) and Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor. RGS proteins act as GTPase-activating proteins for GTP-bound Gα subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins (10Kehrl J.H. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 24: 409-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Arhgef1 specifically accelerates the inherent GTPase activity of Gα12/13 subunits (11Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C.

Arhgef1 also contains a tandem Dbl and pleckstrin homology domain that functions as Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor specific for RhoA (12Hart M.J. Jiang X. Kozasa T. Roscoe W. Singer W.D.

Previously, we have shown that Arhgef1-deficient mice spontaneously develop pulmonary pathology, including a loss of alveolar structure that is accompanied by an increased presence of pulmonary macrophages and exaggerated production of MMP2, MMP9, and MMP12 by Arhgef1−/− alveolar macrophages (9Hartney J.M.

Exaggerated MMP9 production by Arhgef1−/− macrophages was further found to be recapitulated in vitro when cells are cultured on fibronectin and largely dependent on the α5β1 integrin. In this study, we have investigated the macrophage signaling pathway regulated by Arhgef1 that leads to MMP9 production upon integrin-fibronectin interaction. We find that fibronectin induction of MMP9 by murine macrophages, as well as human alveolar macrophages and peripheral blood monocytes, is dependent on autocrine thromboxane receptor signaling, and this Gα12/13-associated GPCR signaling is normally inhibited by Arhgef1. We further show that the expression of ARHGEF1 by human monocytes varies among individuals and is inversely correlated to in vitro fibronectin-mediated MMP9 production by these cells.

We have previously reported that the intracellular signaling molecule Arhgef1 functions in macrophages to suppress this protease production in vivo and in vitro and that α5 and β1 integrin signaling is largely required for this in vitro MMP9 production (9Hartney J.M. Brown J. Chu H.W. Chang L.Y. Pelanda R. Torres R.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2010; 176: 1157-1168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the course of that study, we noted a macrophage cell concentration-dependent effect on MMP9 induction. To investigate this in more detail, we cultured thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages, isolated from wild type or Arhgef1−/− mice, over a range of cell concentrations. The cells were cultured for 48 h on either plastic or fibronectin, and Mmp9 expression was measured. Fig. 1A shows that fibronectin promotes Mmp9 expression by wild type and mutant macrophages over a range of cell concentrations (0.03–0.5 × 106 cells/ml) that is maximal at 0.13 × 106 cells/ml for both genotypes. As previously reported (9Hartney J.M. Brown J. Chu H.W. Chang L.Y. Pelanda R. Torres R.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2010; 176: 1157-1168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), in the absence of Arhgef1, fibronectin induction of Mmp9 by macrophages is significantly elevated (Fig. 1A; note the y axis is log scale). At the highest cell concentration of 2.0 × 106 cells/ml, fibronectin did not appear to induce Mmp9 expression. To determine whether these changes in Mmp9 mRNA were similarly reflected by changes in MMP9 protein, we also measured protease activity in conditioned media. These results show that MMP9 activity is significantly elevated in conditioned media from cells cultured on fibronectin compared with cells cultured on plastic and at all cell concentrations evaluated (Fig. 1, B and C). Furthermore, Arhgef1-deficient macrophages exhibited significantly higher levels of MMP9 activity compared with wild type cells at 0.25 × 106 cells/ml. However, this difference in MMP9 activity between Arhgef1−/− and wild type samples diminishes as cell concentration increases, possibly reflecting a limited linear range when quantitating gelatin zymography. These results indicate that Mmp9 mRNA expression reflects the status of the macrophages at the time of harvest, whereas MMP9 activity reflects the cumulative production of MMP9 over the culture period. The differences between wild type and Arhgef1-deficient samples are most pronounced at the lower cellular concentrations as analyzed by both qPCR and enzyme activity. Therefore, we used these cell concentrations to investigate how the absence of Arhgef1 alters the expression and production of MMP9 by macrophages cultured on fibronectin. We initially explored whether the cell concentration dependence could be attributed to cell-to-cell contact. To accomplish this, the cells were fixed after culture on either plastic or fibronectin and stained with crystal violet to determine the extent of cell-to-cell contact. We found minimal cell-to-cell contact between macrophages at cell concentrations that induce MMP9 expression and production (data not shown). At the highest cell concentration (2.0 × 106 cells/ml), essentially all macrophages are in contact with adjacent cells, yet MMP9 production remains elevated in the samples cultured on fibronectin (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that cell-to-cell contact does not inhibit MMP9 production at the higher cell concentrations and, conversely, is not required for Mmp9 induction at the lower concentrations. We next considered whether an autocrine/paracrine factor(s) might contribute to macrophage Mmp9 expression. In addition to MMP9 production, ECM proteins have also been shown to promote prostanoid production by myeloid cells (24Gudewicz P.W. Frewin M.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 25Shapiro S.D. Kobayashi D.K. Pentland A.P. Welgus H.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 10365-10368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, we questioned whether fibronectin was similarly stimulating production of PGE2 and thromboxane A2 by macrophages in our in vitro cultures. In particular, PGE2 has been reported to function as an autocrine factor for MMP9 production by murine macrophages stimulated with ECM components (28Pavlovic S. Du B. Sakamoto K. Khan K.M. Natarajan C. Breyer R.M. Dannenberg A.J. Falcone D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3321-3328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We measured PGE2 in our culture supernatant from macrophages incubated on plastic or fibronectin at the cell concentration (0.13 × 106 cells/ml) that maximally induced Mmp9 expression. These findings reveal that although conditioned media from macrophages cultured on plastic failed to contain measureable levels of PGE2, conditioned media from macrophages cultured on fibronectin harbor readily detectable levels of this prostaglandin (Fig. 1D). Thromboxane is another prostanoid produced by peritoneal macrophages when cultured on ECM proteins (24Gudewicz P.W. Frewin M.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 26Gudewicz P.W. Frewin M.B. Heinel L.A. Minnear F.L. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and was also measured in the supernatant from our macrophage cultures. Similar to PGE2, the thromboxane metabolite TXB2 was also modestly but reproducibly induced by fibronectin in both wild type and mutant macrophages (Fig. 1E). Thus, fibronectin not only induces increased macrophage MMP9 production but also leads to synthesis of the inflammatory prostanoids PGE2 and TXB2. Furthermore, although both prostanoids were elevated in Arhgef1-deficient samples, these increases were not statistically significant, and we conclude that production of these prostanoids does not depend on Arhgef1 expression. Prostaglandins and thromboxane are generated from arachidonic acid metabolism by cyclooxygenases; thus we asked whether cyclooxygenase activity was similarly required for fibronectin-mediated induction of MMP9. To address this, we treated macrophages cultured on fibronectin with a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, aspirin, followed by measurement of MMP9 production and activity by gelatin zymography. These data revealed that aspirin inhibited MMP9 activity in a dose-dependent manner in both wild type and Arhgef1-deficient macrophages maximally inhibiting MMP9 activity by 70–75% (Fig. 2, A and B). We note that the 20 mm maximal concentration of aspirin used is >4-fold above the IC50 for COX1 and COX2 (29Johnson J.L. Wimsatt J. Buckel S.D. Dyer R.D. Maddipati K.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 324: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, cyclooxygenase activity is required for optimal fibronectin-induced macrophage MMP9 production, although our results also indicate a minor contribution to MMP9 production via a cyclooxygenase-independent pathway. We find that fibronectin induces PGE2 production by primary murine macrophages (Fig. 1D), and it has previously been reported that PGE2 signaling via the EP4 receptor is required for production of MMP9 by a murine macrophage cell line after stimulation with a mixture of ECM components (28Pavlovic S. Du B. Sakamoto K. Khan K.M. Natarajan C. Breyer R.M. Dannenberg A.J. Falcone D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3321-3328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To assess whether a similar dependence on EP4 signaling was also required for fibronectin-induced MMP9 production by primary mouse macrophages, we inhibited EP4 receptor signaling with the EP4 antagonist L-161,982 (30Takayama K. García-Cardena G. Sukhova G.K. Comander J. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Libby P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44147-44154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Treatment of macrophages cultured on fibronectin with 0.4–10 μm of the L-161,982 EP4 receptor antagonist maximally suppressed fibronectin-induced MMP9 production by mouse macrophages by only ∼40% (Fig. 2C and data not shown) despite completely inhibiting EP4 signaling at these same concentrations (31Kuroda E. Yamashita U. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, although EP4 signaling may be necessary for maximal fibronectin-mediated MMP9 production by murine macrophages, there is not an absolute requirement for signaling by this receptor to produce MMP9. Our data thus far show that fibronectin-induced macrophage MMP9 production is largely dependent on cyclooxygenase activity (Fig. 2, A and B) but less so on EP4 signaling (Fig. 2C). Macrophages also express thromboxane receptors (32Allan C.J. Halushka P.V. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 270: 446-452PubMed Google Scholar), and because thromboxane is also produced when macrophages are cultured on fibronectin (Fig. 1E), we next assessed whether autocrine thromboxane receptor signaling contributed to MMP9 production and might partially account for the cyclooxygenase dependence. To test this, we inhibited macrophage thromboxane receptor signaling with two different receptor"

Although proteolytic processing goes to completion, the rate of cleavage differs between different boundaries, primarily due to the sequence at these positions. However, it is not known whether slow cleavage is important for viral replication or a consequence of restrictions on sequences that can be tolerated at the cleaved ends of non-structural proteins. To address this question, mutations were introduced into the NS4B side of the NS4B5A boundary, and their effect on replication and polyprotein processing was examined in the context of a subgenomic replicon. Single mutations that modestly increased the rate of boundary processing were phenotypically silent, but a double mutation, which further increased the rate of boundary cleavage, was lethal. Rescue experiments relying on viral RNA polymerase-induced error failed to identify second site compensatory mutations. Use of a replicon library with codon degeneracy did allow identification of second site compensatory mutations, some of which fell exclusively within the NS5A side of the boundary. These mutations slowed boundary cleavage and only enhanced replication in the context of the original lethal NS4B double mutation. Overall, the data indicate that slow cleavage of the NS4B5A boundary is important and identify a previously unrecognized role for NS4B5A-containing precursors requiring them to exist for a minimum finite period of time.

This latter set of cleavage events is responsible for release of the NS protein components that go on to form replication complexes. hepatitis C virus non-structural. Although NS3/4A-mediated cleavage of the HCV polyprotein goes to completion and does not result in the formation of stable precursor intermediates, boundaries are cleaved at different rates. Processing at the NS34A junction is extremely rapid, occurs in cis, precedes all other NS3/4A-dependent cleavage events, and is required for correct association of the NS3 protease with its co-factor sequence in NS4A (12Kolykhalov A.A. Agapov E.V. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7525-7533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Tomei L. Failla C. Santolini E. De Francesco R. La Monica N. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4017-4026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage at the NS5A5B boundary is also very rapid. However, the remaining two boundaries flanking NS4B are cleaved less rapidly, leading to formation of detectable transient precursors NS4A4B, NS4A4B5A, and NS4B5A (9Bartenschlager R. Ahlborn-Laake L.

The rate of cleavage at each boundary is thought to be dictated by the primary amino acid sequence at these same locations (12Kolykhalov A.A. Agapov E.V. Rice C.M. J.

Virol. 1996; 70: 6694-6700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but whether there is a need for slowly processed boundaries flanking NS4B is unclear. One possibility is that slow cleavage reflects the functional importance of the N- and C-terminal sequences at these boundaries to the mature proteins generated from the longer precursor proteins. Alternatively, NS4B-containing precursors may possess an activity or activities necessary for replication that are not supplied by their mature, cleaved products, and the delay in boundary cleavage provides sufficient time for these functions to operate. Evidence to support such a hypothesis is currently limited. Certainly, an inability to trans-complement most but not all genetic defects in HCV NS proteins indicates the importance of expressing NS proteins from a functional precursor and a replication-competent RNA transcript (20Appel N. Herian U. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 896-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 21Evans M.J. Rice C.M. Goff S.P. J.

Because some functions of NS5A can only be complemented in trans by expression of an NS3–5A precursor (20Appel N. Herian U. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 896-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that NS4B5A-containing precursors might have a functional role. Alternatively, HCV NS proteins may need to be expressed as a polyprotein precursor to ensure a high localized concentration of viral protein, akin to models proposed for enterovirus replication (24Towner J.S. Mazanet M.M. Semler B.L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7191-7200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is at least a precedent for a role for transient polyprotein precursors in the replication of other positive strand RNA viruses, given that the substrate for poliovirus 3B (VpG) uridylation is a transient 3BC-containing precursor (25Pathak H.B.

Here, we wished to test whether delayed cleavage between NS4B and NS5A contributes to replication. To achieve this, specific mutations on the NS4B side of the NS4B5A boundary were introduced to examine the relationship between the rate of boundary cleavage and replication. Should changes be identified that were detrimental to replication but enhanced boundary cleavage, it was anticipated that the location of compensatory mutations might provide insight into the nature of the selective pressures imposed by the original lethal mutations. Results suggest that transient NS4B5A precursors do have a distinct role in replication, which extends beyond the minimum requirements that can be provided to the virus by expression of NS proteins in cis.

Details relating to the generation of constructs and the sequence of primers are provided as supplemental material. This was carried out as described previously (27McCormick C.J. Brown D. Griffin S. Challinor L. Rowlands D.J. Harris M. J. Gen. Virol. 2006; 87: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 28McCormick C.J. Maucourant S. Griffin S. Rowlands D.J. Harris M. J. Gen. Virol. 2006; 87: 635-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used were sheep anti-NS3, sheep anti-NS5A, sheep anti-NS5B (all gifts from Mark Harris, University of Leeds), and rabbit anti-NS4B (22Jones D.M. Patel A.H. Targett-Adams P. McLauchlan J. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 2163-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Donkey anti-sheep and goat anti-rabbit HRP conjugates (Sigma) were employed as secondary reagents. HepG2 cells were seeded in 6-well dishes precoated with rat tail collagen at a density of 4 × 104 cells/cm2 and allowed to recover for 24 h. Transduction was performed at a concentration of 1.25 × 107 pfu/ml of both BACtTA (26McCormick C.J. Rowlands D.J. Harris M. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and the relevant replicon-containing baculovirus for 4 h. Cells were left a further 15 h before incubating at 37 °C in Met−/Cys− serum-free DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 25 mm HEPES. After 1 h, the medium was replaced with Met−/Cys− serum-free DMEM supplemented with 25 mm HEPES and 200 μCi/ml Trans-label (MP Biomedical), and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. They were then left in complete growth medium at 37 °C for defined periods of between 0 to 60 min before lysis in RIPA buffer (0.5 ml/well) supplemented with 2× complete protease inhibitor, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm NaF. Radiolabeled supernatants were recovered after centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and stored at −80 °C. To immunoprecipitate FLAG-tagged NS5A, 0.4 ml of lysate was precleared for 1 h using 10 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Thermo Scientific). 4 μl of M2 anti-FLAG mAb (Sigma) was added the precleared supernatant, which was left for 30 min on ice before the addition of a further 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, the beads were pelleted, washed four times using RIPA buffer, and boiled in 20 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer to release bound proteins. The protocol used is comparable with that described in other reports (29Beyer B.M. Zhang R. Hong Z. Madison V. Malcolm B.A. Proteins. 2001; 43: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 30Butkiewicz N.J. Wendel M. Zhang R. Jubin R. Pichardo J. Smith E.B. Hart A.M. Ingram R. Durkin J. Mui P.W. Murray M.G. Ramanathan L. Dasmahapatra B. Virology. 1996; 225: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA encoding for a truncated NS4B5A substrate, 291 amino acids in length and representing HCV Con1 residues 1758–2048, was generated from the relevant replicon-containing vector by PCR using primers 4B/5A(prec_fwd) and 4B/5A(prec_rev). This served as a template for production of a 5′ capped RNA transcript using the Maxiscript kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. To generate radiolabeled NS4B5A substrate, 1 μg of RNA was introduced into a 20-μl reaction containing 12.5 μl of rabbit reticulolysate (Promega), 0.5 μl of 1 mm amino acids (Met−), 0.5 μl of [35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol at 10 mCi/ml), and 0.5 μl RiboLock RNase inhibitor (Fermentas). The reaction was left for 2 h at 30 °C before being terminated by the addition of 0.5 μl of 20 mg/ml RNase and 0.5 μl of 0.5 mg/ml cycloheximide. Cleavage of the NS4B5A substrate was then performed over 2 h at 30 °C using 1 μl of the translation reaction in a 10-μl reaction supplemented with 1× cleavage buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.05% (w/v) dodecyl maltoside, 0.05 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 10% (v/v) glycerol) and 10 μg/ml single chain genotype 1b NS3/4A (AnaSpec). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 2× Laemmli loading buffer. Replicon transcripts were prepared as described previously, as was their introduction into cells via electroporation (27McCormick C.J. Brown D. Griffin S. Challinor L. Rowlands D.J. Harris M. J. Gen. Virol. 2006; 87: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For colony formation assays, viable electroporated cells were seeded at a range of concentrations between 103 and 105 cells/well of a 6-well dish and supplemented with non-electroporated cells, so the total cell density was 2 × 104 cells/cm2. After a 48-h recovery, G418 was added to a final concentration of 750 μg/ml G418, and selection continued for a further 2–3 weeks with twice weekly changes of medium. For luciferase assays, ∼1.5 × 105 viable cells were seeded per well of a 6-well plate, and enzyme activity was measured using a luciferase assay system (Promega) with the Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (Berthold). Total RNA was extracted from replicon cell lines using TRIzol (Invitrogen). cDNA was generated from 1 μg of this RNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. For all clonal cell lines, a DNA fragment representing nucleotides 6029–6688 of the HCV Con1 genome was amplified by PCR using primers 4B5Ajct(fwd) + 4B5Ajct(rvs) and sequenced across the NS4B5A boundary using primer NS5A(Mlu)rep. For amplification of NS3/4A, primers FwdseqNS3rep + Revseq4Arep were used, and the resultant product was sequenced using primers Int_4A_seq, Int_prot_seq, Con1(5082–5063), and 5.1(3940–3959). PCR amplification of a product encompassing the NS4B5A boundary (nucleotides 6096–6582) from the polyclonal cell line was performed using Phusion polymerase (New England Biolabs) and primers NS4B(Bst)fwd and NS5A(Mlu)rev. The DNA was ligated into pCR-Blunt (Invitrogen), and individual clones were sequenced using the primer M13(Rev). Huh7.5 cells seeded onto glass coverslips were transduced with baculovirus constructs encoding NS4B-green fluorescent protein (GFP), NS4B5A-GFP, or NS5A-GFP at 2 × 107 pfu/ml for 4 h. Cells were left a further 16 h and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and counterstained with 0.5 nm TO-PRO-3 (Invitrogen). Coverslips were mounted onto slides with ProLongGold (Invitrogen). Images were captured using a Leica TCP SP5 confocal microscope. Previous studies using peptides derived from the HCV NS boundaries of genotype 1 isolates have demonstrated that the NS4B5A boundary is less efficiently cleaved by NS3/4A compared with other boundaries (12Kolykhalov A.A.

Virol. 1996; 70: 6694-6700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Changes to specific amino acid residues within the boundary sequence that may lead to more efficient proteolysis include those at the P3 and P4 positions because conversion to hydrophobic residues, such as Val, at these positions enhances cleavage of NS4B5A-based peptides (16Kim S.Y. Park K.W. Lee Y.J. Back S.H. Goo J.H. Park O.K. Jang S.K. Park W.J. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 284: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis both between and within genotypes suggests that HCV can tolerate considerable amino acid variation at the P3 and P4 positions within the NS4B5A boundary, yet a double Val motif has never been observed, although Ile and Val do sometimes occur in one or the other of these two positions (see table in Fig. 1). Assuming that in vitro data with peptides accurately reflects NS3/4A cleavage efficiency at polyprotein boundary sequences, one possible reason for these observations is that there is selective pressure on the virus to avoid rapid cleavage of the NS4B5A boundary. Alternatively, certain combinations of amino acids at the P3 and P4 positions may result in loss of NS4B function.FIGURE 4Replication of constructs with potential P43VV second site compensatory mutations. Huh7.5 cells were electroporated with replicons [FA]luc and [P43VV]luc as well as luciferase-expressing replicons containing the P43VV mutation in addition to further alterations at the NS4B5A boundary. Both a polymerase-defective construct (Δpol) and a construct containing a P4V→A alteration ([P43AV]luc) that had been identified in initial P43VV rescue experiments (see Table 1) were included. Cell extracts were harvested at 4, 24, 48, and 72 h postelectroporation, and luciferase activity was determined. Data shown represent mean luciferase activity (n = 2; error bars, S.D.) at 24, 48, and 72 h, normalized to luciferase activity at the 4 h time point.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine these two possibilities, it was first necessary to establish the consequences of introducing Val residues at the P3 and/or P4 positions of the NS4B5A boundary to polyprotein processing. Hence, we modified a culture-adapted bicistronic genotype 1b replicon (FK5.1neo), which expressed neomycin phosphotransferase, by introducing a FLAG tag sequence into a region of NS5A known to tolerate insertions; this strategy generated a construct from which NS5A could be readily immunoprecipitated. In addition, a unique AseI site that did not alter the encoded amino acid sequence was introduced to facilitate site-directed mutagenesis of the NS4B5A boundary (Fig. 1). The resultant replicon construct [FA]neo was further altered by introduction of Val codons at the P3 position [P3V]neo, the P4 position [P4V]neo or both the P3 and P4 positions [P43VV]neo at the NS4B5A boundary. To express detectable levels of NS protein in the absence of replication, all four replicons were introduced into HepG2 cells using baculovirus transduction. After transduction for 16 h to allow expression of the NS proteins, Western blot analysis revealed that cell lysates contained comparable levels of NS3, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B for all constructs (Fig. 2A). Levels of NS5A hyperphosphorylation were also similar between different experimental groups. From these data, we concluded that polyprotein processing reached completion, irrespective of modifications to the NS4B5A boundary. Moreover, the modifications did not appear to reduce stability of either NS4B or the other NS proteins or lead to any noticeable change in NS5A hyperphosphorylation. Using the baculovirus delivery system, pulse-chase analysis was utilized to investigate the effect of mutations on the rate of NS4B5A boundary processing. In these experiments, HepG2 cells were metabolically labeled for 15 min and then incubated for a further 60 min following removal of radioactivity. NS5A and NS5A-containing precursors were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with an anti-FLAG mAb, separated by SDS-PAGE, and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (Fig. 2, B and C). In [FA]neo-transduced cells, there were considerable amounts of polyprotein products with an uncleaved NS4B5A boundary at the start of the chase period (28% of total NS5A-containing proteins), which declined to a base-line level of 3% over the course of the following 60 min. By comparison, the proportion of NS4B5A-containing products in cells transduced with the [P3V]neo and [P4V]neo baculovirus constructs was lower compared with [FA]neo at all time points except for the final time point at the end of the chase period, demonstrating that the single Val substitutions resulted in similar and detectable increases in processing rates at the NS4B5A boundary. In [P43VV]neo-transduced cells, the abundance of NS4B5A-containing products was even lower than that seen in [P3V]neo or [P4V]neo-transduced cells and was effectively at base-line levels for the entire chase period. Interestingly, there appeared to be a slight transient increase in the amount of NS5A5B precursor present during the earlier time points in [P43VV]neo-transduced cells. However, the key finding was that single valine substitutions at the P3 and P4 positions enhanced the rate of cleavage at the NS4B5A boundary, but the presence of Val residues at both positions further increased the rapidity of cleavage. Having confirmed that Val residues at the P3 and P4 positions increased the rate of NS4B5A cleavage, we examined the effect of the mutations on HCV RNA replication. All four neomycin phosphotransferase-expressing replicon constructs were electroporated into Huh7 cells, and the cells were maintained under G418 selection for a period of 3 weeks to allow formation of replicon-containing colonies. Additional experimental groups included Huh7 cells transfected with FK5.1neo, the original construct from which [FA] had been derived, and a polymerase-defective replicon construct as a negative control (Fig. 3A). The efficiency of colony formation was similar for both FK5.1neo and [FA]neo, each resulting in ∼100 G418-resistant colonies in dishes seeded with 103 transfected cells. Therefore, the modifications that had been introduced into [FA]neo, including the introduction of a FLAG tag sequence in NS5A, did not appear to affect replication. There was also no difference in colony formation between [P3V]neo and [P4V]neo compared with [FA]neo-transfected cells, suggesting that both the P3→V and P4→V mutations had no impact on replication, despite both mutations enhancing the rate of cleavage at the NS4B5A boundary. In contrast, transfection of [P43VV]neo, which had the most rapidly cleaved NS4B5A boundary, yielded ∼1000-fold fewer colonies compared with [FA]neo, indicating that the presence of Val at both the P3 and P4 positions severely impaired replication. However, there were more colonies with the [P43VV]neo construct than observed for cells transfected with the polymerase-defective replicon, suggesting that limited replication did occur. To confirm these observations in transient replication assays, the neomycin phosphotransferase gene in the replicon constructs was exchanged for firefly luciferase, and the resultant constructs were transfected into Huh7 cells (Fig. 3B). For all constructs, levels of luciferase activity were comparable at 4 h post-transfection, a time point that represents translation resulting from input RNA (data not shown). Luciferase activity produced by the polymerase-defective construct rapidly dropped after this point, becoming undetectable by 48 h. By contrast, luciferase activity declined less rapidly and reached a plateau between 24 and 72 h in FK5.1luc-, [FA]luc-, [P3V]luc-, and [P4V]luc-transfected cells, indicating that all of these constructs replicated to a similar extent. For [P43VV]luc, the pattern of luciferase activity closely matched that for the polymerase-defective control, thereby confirming that the double Val substitution blocked replication. Replication competence was also assessed in Huh7.5 cells, derivatives of Huh7 cells that support greater levels of HCV RNA synthesis. All of the constructs gave a similar pattern in these cells compared with Huh7 cells, although some residual replication was detected for [P43VV]luc (Fig. 3C). That the P43VV mutation was detrimental for replication was also established using the JFH-1 genotype 2a replicon (see supplemental Fig. 1). Furthermore, an in cellulo NS4B5A cleavage assay indicated that the JFH-1 protease exhibited a preference for hydrophobic residues (e.g. Val and Iso) at the P3 and P4 positions (supplemental Fig. 2), consistent with what has also been observed at the NS5A5B boundary (31Kaul A. Stauffer S. Berger C. Pertel T. Schmitt J. Kallis S. Zayas M. Lopez M.Z. Lohmann V. Luban J. Bartenschlager R. PLoS. Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000546Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). From both the luciferase and colony-forming assays, we concluded that the P43→VV mutation, which gives rapid cleavage of the NS4B5A boundary, severely impairs replication. By contrast, individual Val mutations at P3 and P4 result in a modest increase in boundary cleavage and have negligible impact on replication. Although [P43VV]neo gave barely detected replication, it was possible to isolate neomycin-resistant colonies, which could be expanded as stable replicon cell lines. Expansion of these colonies enabled analysis of [P43VV]neo replicons for additional mutations that might overcome their defect in replication. Ten G418-resistant colonies were recovered from [P43VV]neo-transfected cells, and for each clone, the segment encompassing the NS4B5A boundary coding region was amplified by RT-PCR. The sequences of these PCR products were determined across a region that represents nucleotides 6111–6492 of the HCV Con1 genome, which includes the NS4B5A boundary region. All of the clones contained a single nucleotide substitution, which resulted in loss of the Val residue at either the P3 or P4 position, but no other mutations were found within the sequenced region (Table 1). Interestingly, we found considerable flexibility in the amin"
https://openalex.org/W2096547401,"Abnormalities in T-lymphocyte populations and function are observed in autism. Soluble amyloid precursor protein α (sAPP-α) is elevated in some patients with autism and is known to be produced by immune cells. In light of the well-established role of sAPP-α in proliferation, growth, and survival of neurons, we hypothesized an analogous role in the immune system. Thus, we explored whether sAPP-α could modulate immune development and function, especially aspects of the pinnacle cell of the adaptive arm of the immune system: the T cell. To do this, we generated mice overexpressing human sAPP-α and characterized elements of T-cell development, signal transduction, cytokine production, and innate/adaptive immune functions. Here, we report that transgenic sAPP-α-overexpressing (TgsAPP-α) mice displayed increased proportions of CD8(+) T cells, while effector memory T cells were decreased in the thymus. Overall apoptotic signal transduction was decreased in the thymus, an effect that correlated with dramatic elevations in Notch1 activation; while active-caspase-3/total-caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl-2 ratios were decreased. Greater levels of IFN-γ, IL-2, and IL-4 were observed after ex vivo challenge of TgsAPP-α mouse splenocytes with T-cell mitogen. Finally, after immunization, splenocytes from TgsAPP-α mice displayed decreased levels IFN-γ, IL-2, and IL-4, as well as suppressed ZAP70 activation, after recall antigen stimulation. Given elevated levels of circulating sAPP-α in some patients with autism, sAPP-α could potentially drive aspects of immune dysfunction observed in these patients, including dysregulated T-cell apoptosis, aberrant PI3K/AKT signaling, cytokine alterations, and impaired T-cell recall stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2089294194,"DNA fragmentation is a well-recognized hallmark of apoptosis. However, the precise DNA sequences cleaved during apoptosis triggered by distinct mechanisms remain unclear. We used next-generation sequencing of DNA fragments generated in Actinomycin D-treated human HL-60 leukemic cells to generate a high-throughput, global map of apoptotic DNA breakpoints. These data highlighted that DNA breaks are non-random and show a significant association with active genes and open chromatin regions. We noted that transcription factor binding sites were also enriched within a fraction of the apoptotic breakpoints. Interestingly, extensive apoptotic cleavage was noted within genes that are frequently translocated in human cancers. We speculate that the non-random fragmentation of DNA during apoptosis may contribute to gene translocations and the development of human cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2118198519,"Colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) and its receptor (CSF-1R) are key regulators of macrophage biology, and their elevated expression in cancer cells has been linked to poor prognosis. CSF-1Rs are thought to function at the plasma membrane. We show here that functional CSF-1Rs are present at the nuclear envelope of various cell types, including primary macrophages, human cancer cell lines, and primary human carcinomas. In response to CSF-1, added to intact cells or isolated nuclei, nucleus-associated CSF-1R became phosphorylated and triggered the phosphorylation of Akt and p27 inside the nucleus. Extracellularly added CSF-1 was also found to colocalize with nucleus-associated CSF-1Rs. All these activities were found to depend selectively on the activity of the p110δ isoform of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). This finding was related to the p110δ-dependent translocation of exogenous CSF-1 to the nucleus-associated CSF-1Rs, correlating with a prominent role of p110δ in activation of the Rab5 GTPase, a key regulator of the endocytic trafficking. siRNA-silencing of Rab5a phenocopied p110δ inactivation and nuclear CSF-1 signaling. Our work demonstrates for the first time the presence of functional nucleus-associated CSF-1Rs, which are activated by extracellular CSF-1 by a mechanism that involves p110δ and Rab5 activity. These findings may have important implications in cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W2031086813,"This study explores the hypothesis that combining the minimally invasive surgical techniques of cryosurgery and pulsed electric fields will eliminate some of the major disadvantages of these techniques while retaining their advantages. Cryosurgery, tissue ablation by freezing, is a well-established minimally invasive surgical technique. One disadvantage of cryosurgery concerns the mechanism of cell death; cells at high subzero temperature on the outer rim of the frozen lesion can survive. Pulsed electric fields (PEF) are another minimally invasive surgical technique in which high strength and very rapid electric pulses are delivered across cells to permeabilize the cell membrane for applications such as gene delivery, electrochemotherapy and irreversible electroporation. The very short time scale of the electric pulses is disadvantageous because it does not facilitate real time control over the procedure. We hypothesize that applying the electric pulses during the cryosurgical procedure in such a way that the electric field vector is parallel to the heat flux vector will have the effect of confining the electric fields to the frozen/cold region of tissue, thereby ablating the cells that survive freezing while facilitating controlled use of the PEF in the cold confined region. A finite element analysis of the electric field and heat conduction equations during simultaneous tissue treatment with cryosurgery and PEF (cryosurgery/PEF) was used to study the effect of tissue freezing on electric fields. The study yielded motivating results. Because of decreased electrical conductivity in the frozen/cooled tissue, it experienced temperature induced magnified electric fields in comparison to PEF delivered to the unfrozen tissue control. This suggests that freezing/cooling confines and magnifies the electric fields to those regions; a targeting capability unattainable in traditional PEF. This analysis shows how temperature induced magnified and focused PEFs could be used to ablate cells in the high subzero freezing region of a cryosurgical lesion."
https://openalex.org/W2011533623,"Fructose-induced hepatic ATP depletion prevents TNF-induced apoptosis, whereas it contrarily enhances CD95-induced hepatocyte apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. By contrast, transformed liver cells are not protected against TNF due to metabolic alterations, allowing selective tumor targeting. We analyzed the molecular mechanisms by which fructose modulates cytokine-induced apoptosis. A release of adenosine after fructose-induced ATP depletion, followed by a cAMP response, was demonstrated. Likewise, cAMP and adenosine mimicked per se the modulation by fructose of CD95- and TNF-induced apoptosis. The effects of fructose on cytokine-induced apoptosis were sensitive to inhibition of protein kinase A. Fructose prevented the pro-apoptotic, sustained phase of TNF-induced JNK signaling and thereby blocked bid-mediated activation of the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in a PKA-dependent manner. We explain the dichotomal effects of fructose on CD95- and TNF-induced cell death by the selective requirement of JNK signaling for the latter. These findings provide a mechanistic rationale for the protection of hepatocytes from TNF-induced cell death by pharmacological doses of fructose."
