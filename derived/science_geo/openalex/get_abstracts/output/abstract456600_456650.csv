https://openalex.org/W2129917557,"Oncogenic Ras has previously been shown to promote macropinocytosis; here it is demonstrated that this process allows tumour cells to use extracellular proteins to generate amino acids necessary to support tumour growth. This paper describes a previously unrecognized pathway of nutrient supply to cancer cells. Oncogenic Ras proteins are known to promote macropinocytosis, an endocytic process by which extracellular fluid and its contents are internalized into cells through vesicles known as macropinosomes. Dafna Bar-Sagi and colleagues now demonstrate that Ras-transformed cells can use this process to 'feed' on extracellular protein. The macropinocytosed protein undergoes degradation, giving rise to free amino acids necessary to support tumour growth. This finding suggests that inhibition of macropinocytosis may be effective against a subset of cancers. Macropinocytosis is a highly conserved endocytic process by which extracellular fluid and its contents are internalized into cells through large, heterogeneous vesicles known as macropinosomes. Oncogenic Ras proteins have been shown to stimulate macropinocytosis but the functional contribution of this uptake mechanism to the transformed phenotype remains unknown1,2,3. Here we show that Ras-transformed cells use macropinocytosis to transport extracellular protein into the cell. The internalized protein undergoes proteolytic degradation, yielding amino acids including glutamine that can enter central carbon metabolism. Accordingly, the dependence of Ras-transformed cells on free extracellular glutamine for growth can be suppressed by the macropinocytic uptake of protein. Consistent with macropinocytosis representing an important route of nutrient uptake in tumours, its pharmacological inhibition compromises the growth of Ras-transformed pancreatic tumour xenografts. These results identify macropinocytosis as a mechanism by which cancer cells support their unique metabolic needs and point to the possible exploitation of this process in the design of anticancer therapies."

To clarify the biological mechanisms that drive cardiac hypertrophy in aging, we tested the influence of circulating factors using heterochronic parabiosis, a surgical technique in which joining of animals of different ages leads to a shared circulation. After 4 weeks of exposure to the circulation of young mice, cardiac hypertrophy in old mice dramatically regressed, accompanied by reduced cardiomyocyte size and molecular remodeling. Reversal of age-related hypertrophy was not attributable to hemodynamic or behavioral effects of parabiosis, implicating a blood-borne factor. Using modified aptamer-based proteomics, we identified the TGF-β superfamily member GDF11 as a circulating factor in young mice that declines with age. Treatment of old mice to restore GDF11 to youthful levels recapitulated the effects of parabiosis and reversed age-related hypertrophy, revealing a therapeutic opportunity for cardiac aging."
https://openalex.org/W2104276565,"Exome sequencing of patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) and their unaffected parents reveals an excess of strong-effect, protein-altering de novo mutations in genes expressed in the developing heart, many of which regulate chromatin modification in key developmental genes; collectively, these mutations are predicted to account for approximately 10% of severe CHD cases. This paper demonstrates that de novo mutations with large effect have a role in the pathogenesis of at least 10% of cases of congenital heart disease (CHD). Using exome sequence analysis in parent–offspring trios Richard Lifton and colleagues compared the frequency of de novo mutations, identified by exome sequencing, in 362 CHD parent–offspring trios and 264 control trios. Gene ontology analysis demonstrated significant enrichment of de novo protein-altering mutation of genes involved in chromatin modification, notably a marked enrichment of genes involved in the production, removal and reading of methylation of histone H3K4 and H3K27. Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most frequent birth defect, affecting 0.8% of live births1. Many cases occur sporadically and impair reproductive fitness, suggesting a role for de novo mutations. Here we compare the incidence of de novo mutations in 362 severe CHD cases and 264 controls by analysing exome sequencing of parent–offspring trios. CHD cases show a significant excess of protein-altering de novo mutations in genes expressed in the developing heart, with an odds ratio of 7.5 for damaging (premature termination, frameshift, splice site) mutations. Similar odds ratios are seen across the main classes of severe CHD. We find a marked excess of de novo mutations in genes involved in the production, removal or reading of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation, or ubiquitination of H2BK120, which is required for H3K4 methylation2,3,4. There are also two de novo mutations in SMAD2, which regulates H3K27 methylation in the embryonic left–right organizer5. The combination of both activating (H3K4 methylation) and inactivating (H3K27 methylation) chromatin marks characterizes ‘poised’ promoters and enhancers, which regulate expression of key developmental genes6. These findings implicate de novo point mutations in several hundreds of genes that collectively contribute to approximately 10% of severe CHD."

https://openalex.org/W2157232603,"Epigenetic mechanisms have been proposed to play crucial roles in mammalian development, but their precise functions are only partially understood. To investigate epigenetic regulation of embryonic development, we differentiated human embryonic stem cells into mesendoderm, neural progenitor cells, trophoblast-like cells, and mesenchymal stem cells and systematically characterized DNA methylation, chromatin modifications, and the transcriptome in each lineage. We found that promoters that are active in early developmental stages tend to be CG rich and mainly engage H3K27me3 upon silencing in nonexpressing lineages. By contrast, promoters for genes expressed preferentially at later stages are often CG poor and primarily employ DNA methylation upon repression. Interestingly, the early developmental regulatory genes are often located in large genomic domains that are generally devoid of DNA methylation in most lineages, which we termed DNA methylation valleys (DMVs). Our results suggest that distinct epigenetic mechanisms regulate early and late stages of ES cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2167495346,"Sexual dimorphisms in the brain underlie behavioral sex differences, but the function of individual sexually dimorphic neuronal populations is poorly understood. Neuronal sexual dimorphisms typically represent quantitative differences in cell number, gene expression, or other features, and it is unknown whether these dimorphisms control sex-typical behavior exclusively in one sex or in both sexes. The progesterone receptor (PR) controls female sexual behavior, and we find many sex differences in number, distribution, or projections of PR-expressing neurons in the adult mouse brain. Using a genetic strategy we developed, we have ablated one such dimorphic PR-expressing neuronal population located in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). Ablation of these neurons in females greatly diminishes sexual receptivity. Strikingly, the corresponding ablation in males reduces mating and aggression. Our findings reveal the functions of a molecularly defined, sexually dimorphic neuronal population in the brain. Moreover, we show that sexually dimorphic neurons can control distinct sex-typical behaviors in both sexes."

Interactions between bacterial products (MAMPs) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are known to be mandatory for IEC homeostasis, but how TLRs may time homeostatic functions with circadian changes is unknown. Our functional and molecular dissections of the IEC circadian clock demonstrate that its integrity is required for microbiota-IEC dialog. In IEC, the antiphasic expression of the RORα activator and RevErbα repressor clock output regulators generates a circadian rhythmic TLR expression that converts the temporally arrhythmic microbiota signaling into circadian rhythmic JNK and IKKβ activities, which prevents RevErbα activation by PPARα that would disrupt the circadian clock. Moreover, through activation of AP1 and NF-κB, these activities, together with RORα and RevErbα, enable timing homeostatic functions of numerous genes with IEC circadian events.

A single layer of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) provides the physical barrier that separates, from the underlying lamina propria and the rest of the body, ∼1014 microorganisms (mostly commensal bacteria) living in the intestinal lumen and termed gut microbiota. Studies on germ-free (GF) and antibiotic-induced microbiota-depleted (AIMD) mice have revealed that gut colonization by the microbiota is beneficial in many respects for mammalian host homeostasis (Hooper et al., 2001Hooper L.V.

Several intestinal functions (e.g., nutrient absorption, cell proliferation, motility, metabolic activities) are known to be rhythmically regulated in a circadian manner (Hussain and Pan, 2009Hussain M.M. Pan X. Clock genes, intestinal transport and plasma lipid homeostasis.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2009; 20: 177-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and it has been shown that core components of the circadian clock could be functional in mouse small intestine in which the expression of some TLR genes may also vary around the circadian day (Froy and Chapnik, 2007Froy O.

To explore the possibility that such a clock (reviewed in Dibner et al., 2010Dibner C. Schibler U. Albrecht U.

Interestingly, our study not only revealed the functional organization of this clock, but also demonstrated that it is critically involved in the molecular mechanism underlying the control of IEC homeostasis through TLR-mediated microbiota signaling. Because many nuclear receptors (NRs) exhibit a circadian oscillatory expression in various tissues (Yang et al., 2006Yang X. Downes M. Yu R.T. Bookout A.L. He W. Straume M. Mangelsdorf D.J.

Upon antibiotic treatment, transcripts of RevErbα, PPARα, and CAR increased, and those of RORα, ERβ, and PPARβ decreased, whereas only CAR varied in liver (data not shown).

The classical clock core was disrupted: Bmal1 and Cry1 transcripts decreased, whereas Per1 and Per2 transcripts increased, and those of Clock were unaffected (Figures 1C and 1D). Because germ-free (GF) mice exhibit increased triglycerides (TG) and hypoinsulinemia (Bäckhed et al., 2007Bäckhed F. Manchester J.K. Semenkovich C.F. Gordon J.I. Mechanisms underlying the resistance to diet-induced obesity in germ-free mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 979-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar; Figure S3M), we analyzed blood metabolic parameters in AIMDM at circadian cycle times ZT0 (6 a.m.) and ZT12 (6 p.m.). Significant increases in glucose, TG, free fatty acids (FFA), and corticosterone, and a decrease in insulin were found (Figure 1E). Reduction in insulin transcripts in AIMDM correlated with decreased insulin secretion in the glucose tolerance test (GTT) (Figures S1A–S1E). The AIMD increase in blood glucose was in keeping with those of liver PEPCK and G6Pase transcripts (Figure S1F). Moreover, expression of Hes1, a negative regulator of hepatic TG production (Lemke et al., 2008Lemke U. Krones-Herzig A. Berriel Diaz M. Narvekar P. Ziegler A. Vegiopoulos A. Cato A.C.B. Bohl S.

Expression of Angptl4 (FIAF), necessary for conversion of TG to FFA, was also increased in AIMD ileum (Figure S1G), thus contributing to elevated blood FFA levels (Mandard et al., 2006Mandard S.

Collectively, these results indicated an involvement of gut microbiota in controlling IEC expression of NRs and clock components, as well as systemic metabolism homeostasis. Importantly, all above AIMD variations were also found in GF mice (compare Figure 1 with Figures S1 and S3). The ZT0 and ZT12 corticosterone increases in AIMDM led us to analyze blood adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels. Undetectable at ZT0, ACTH was lower at ZT12 in AIMD and GF mice than in controls (Figures 3A and S4A). Remarkably, adrenalectomy (Adx) of AIMDM had no effect on blood corticosterone at ZT0, whereas it was identical at ZT12 in Adx AIMD and control mice, indicating that there was no adrenal corticosterone synthesis at ZT0, whereas at ZT12 its extra-adrenal production was similar to that normally produced in control mice (Figure 3B). It has been reported that corticosterone synthesis may occur in ileal, but not in colonic IEC (Cima et al., 2004Cima I. Corazza N. Dick B. Fuhrer A. Herren S. Jakob S. Ayuni E. Mueller C. Brunner T.

Accordingly, Cyp11a1 transcripts and protein (the rate limiting enzyme in corticosterone synthesis) were present in control ileal IEC, and increased in ileal IEC of AIMD (Figures 3E and 3F) and GF mice (Figure S4D), whereas there was no increase in adrenals of AIMD and GF mice (Figures S4B, S4C, and S4E).Figure S4Intestinal Epithelium Is the Source of Increased Corticosterone Synthesis in AIMD Mice, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Blood ACTH levels in control and Germ-Free (GF) mice at ZT0 and ZT12 (see also Figure 3A).(B) RNA transcript level of Cyp11a involved in corticosteroid synthesis in adrenal glands of control and AIMD mice.(C) Immunoblot analysis of Cyp11a in adrenals of control and AIMD mice.(D) Relative Cyp11a RNA transcript level in ileal epithelial cells of control and GF mice at ZT0 and ZT12.(E) RNA transcript level of Cyp11a in adrenal glands of control and GF mice at ZT12.(F and G) RNA transcript levels of circadian clock components at ZT0 and ZT12 in colonic epithelium of sham-operated control, AIMD, adrenalectomized (Adx) and adrenalectomized-microbiota-depleted (Adx AIMD) mice.(H) Blood Corticosterone level in control and AIMD mice with or without Metyrapone treatment at ZT0 and ZT12.(I and J) RNA transcript levels of circadian clock genes in colonic epithelium of control and AIMD mice with or without Metyrapone treatment.(K) RNA transcript levels for genes (as indicated) in liver of mice treated as in (H).(L–O) Blood levels of indicated parameters in control and AIMD mice at ZT0 and ZT12 with or without Metyrapone treatment.All values represent mean ± SEM n = 8–10 mice per time point per group (A, H, L–O). n = 4 mice per time point per group (B, D–G, I–K).

Interestingly, on its own, Adx did not generate the AIMD defects found in IEC clock components and in blood metabolic parameters (Figures 3C, 3D, S4F, and S4G), indicating that ileal corticosterone overproduction could be involved in the AIMD syndrome. That AIMD hypercorticosterolism was instrumental in generating the systemic metabolic and clock defects, was shown by treating AIMD mice with metyrapone (a Cyp11a1 competitive inhibitor) (Mueller et al., 2006Mueller M. Cima I. Noti M. Fuhrer A. Jakob S. Dubuquoy L. Schoonjans K. Brunner T. The nuclear receptor LRH-1 critically regulates extra-adrenal glucocorticoid synthesis in the intestine.J. Exp.

Metyrapone reversed the AIMD systemic alterations in blood (TG, FFA, insulin, and glucose), and in liver (Figures 3J, 3K, and S4K–S4O), as well as AIMD IEC clock defects (Figures 3G, 3H, S4I, and S4J). A treatment with the glucocorticoid (GC) antagonist RU486 similarly reversed systemic alterations (Figures S5B and S5C) and IEC clock defects in AIMD mice (Figure S5A). In this respect, note that there is an IR nGRE element in the RORα gene (see Figure S5D) and (+)GRE elements in Per1 and Per2 genes (So et al., 2009So A.Y. Bernal T.U. Pillsbury M.L. Yamamoto K.R.

As expected, AIMDM GRiec−/− mutants did not exhibit alterations in RORα, Per1, and Per2 (Figures 3L, 3M, and S5E–S5H), nor the AIMD systemic increases in TG and FFA (Figures 3N, 3O, and S5I), whereas AIMDM GRhep−/− mutants lacked the systemic AIMD increase in glucose and TG (Figures 3P–3R). Ileal and colonic IEC RORα reached zenith expression and was maximally bound to Bmal1 RORE at ZT0 (Figures 1A, 1B, 3T, and S7A), whereas Bmal1 expression drastically decreased at ZT0 in RORαiec−/− mutant mice (Figure 3U, and data not shown for colon). In contrast, a similar Bmal1 mutation (Bmal1iec−/−) had no effect on expression of RORα and Cry1 (even though the latter contains an E box) (Feng and Lazar, 2012Feng D. Lazar M.A. Clocks, metabolism, and the epigenome.Mol.

Due to competition with the RevErbα repressor (see below), RORα binding to Bmal1 RORE decreased (Figures 1A and 3T) from ZT0 to ZT12. At this time (ZT12) corticosterone, which was the lowest at ZT0 was high both in blood (Figure 3B) and in ileal IEC (see below), and RORα expression was directly repressed through GR binding to its IR nGRE (Figures 3S and S5D, control panel), whereas Bmal1 expression was the lowest (compare RORα and Bmal1 in Figures"

Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone modifications play critical roles during embryogenesis (Li et al., 1992Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R.

However, knowledge of how much epigenetic information in gametes can be transferred to the offspring is limited. Recent studies show that epigenetic modifications from gametes in general are cleared and reestablished after fertilization (Blewitt et al., 2006Blewitt M.E. Vickaryous N.K. Paldi A. Koseki H.

However, this theory lacks evidence in the form of high-resolution epigenetic maps in oocytes, sperm, and early embryos. DNA methylation is one major epigenetic modification that is crucial for the development and differentiation of various cell types in an organism (Li et al., 1992Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R.

In mammals, DNA demethylation occurs in the whole-genome level after fertilization, but not in some loci, such as intracisternal A particle (IAP) (Daxinger and Whitelaw, 2010Daxinger L. Whitelaw E.

To further understand how offspring obtain DNA methylation information from parents, reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) was used to achieve the most comprehensive genome-scale methylomes in mouse gametes and prespecified embryos (Smallwood and Kelsey, 2012Smallwood S.A.

Unfortunately, the RRBS method covers only 5% of the genome for the comparative analysis (Ball et al., 2009Ball M.P. Li J.B. Gao Y. Lee J.H. LeProust E.M. Park I.H. Xie B. Daley G.Q. Church G.M.

The limited genome coverage in oocyte and early embryos prevents a full understanding of how much DNA methylation information is inherited and how it is transferred from sperm and oocyte to progenies, respectively. Moreover, the limited understanding extends to the biological purposes and outcomes of DNA methylation inheritance from gametes. Although the genome-wide DNA demethylation is a hallmark of mammalian embryogenesis, a controversy surrounds the question of whether such a phenomenon is general for all vertebrates. Some studies report the absence of genome-wide demethylation in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and Xenopus (Macleod et al., 1999Macleod D. Clark V.H. Bird A. Absence of genome-wide changes in DNA methylation during development of the zebrafish.Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 139-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar; Veenstra and Wolffe, 2001Veenstra G.J. Wolffe A.P. Constitutive genomic methylation during embryonic development of Xenopus.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1521: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), but others argue for the existence of genome-wide demethylation in zebrafish embryos (MacKay et al., 2007MacKay A.B. Mhanni A.A. McGowan R.A. Krone P.H. Immunological detection of changes in genomic DNA methylation during early zebrafish development.Genome. 2007; 50: 778-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar; Mhanni and McGowan, 2004Mhanni A.A. McGowan R.A. Global changes in genomic methylation levels during early development of the zebrafish embryo.Dev. Genes Evol. 2004; 214: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Here, we chose zebrafish as the model to measure DNA methylomes at single-base resolution in gametes and early embryos. We reveal that zebrafish inherit the DNA methylome from sperm. The zebrafish is a common model organism for vertebrate developmental studies. The annotated zebrafish genome is about 1.4 giga (G) bases, including 24.2 million CpG sites. Genetic polymorphisms (SNPs) would potentially interrupt the calling of methylation status of cytosines. Therefore, we performed whole-genome resequencing of the Tübingen (TU) strain (depth 22-fold) used in this study and identified about 11 million SNPs between our TU strain and the reference genome (Zv9, UCSC). Indeed, 1.2 million CpG sites are disrupted by SNPs in the TU genome. These sites were therefore excluded from further analyses. To explore how progenies inherit the DNA methylation information from parents, we collected both sperm and oocytes, as well as cleavage-stage embryos at the 16-cell, 32-cell, and 64-cell stages, the early-blastula stage at 128 cell, the midblastula stage (MBT) at 1,000 cell (or 1k cell), the gastrula stage at the germ ring, and testis from inbred TU strain. We generated single-base resolution methylomes in these samples with MethylC-seq (Lister et al., 2009Lister R. Pelizzola M. Dowen R.H. Hawkins R.D. Hon G. Tonti-Filippini J. Nery J.R. Lee L. Ye Z. Ngo Q.M. et al.Human DNA methylomes at base resolution show widespread epigenomic differences.Nature. 2009; 462: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar). The average genomic depth among these nine samples was 13-fold per strand (Table 1). We did not observe significant methylation at non-CpG sites in any stage of embryos (data not shown). Therefore, all subsequent analyses were focused on the CpG sites.Table 1Summary of Shotgun Bisulfite SequencingSampleStageGenome DepthsBS Conversion RateNumber of CG (1×)CG (1×) CoveredNumber of CG (5×)CG (5×) CoveredSpermgamete3199.53%22.0 M95.18%20.6 M89.25%Egg3599.73%22.1 M95.93%21.0 M90.89%16 cellcleavage1999.44%21.6 M93.76%18.9 M82.07%32 cell3299.89%22.1 M95.69%20.8 M90.19%64 cell1999.34%20.8 M90.19%17.8 M77.25%128 cellblastula2299.51%21.9 M95.00%19.9 M86.14%1,000 cell3899.53%22.0 M95.45%20.8 M90.15%Germ ringgastrula2099.57%21.7 M94.09%19.3 M83.41%Testisorgan2199.44%22.0 M95.27%20.1 M87.03%Paired reads were mapped uniquely to the reference genome (Zv9, UCSC) by Bismark.

First, we analyzed the genomic features of the zebrafish methylome and calculated the methylation level of each CpG site across the genome. In this study, we considered only CpG sites that were covered at least ten times. In all samples, the majority of CpG sites are either highly methylated (methylation level between 75% and 100%) or unmethylated (less than 25%) (Figure S1A available online) (Lister et al., 2009Lister R.

Sperm methylation profiles reveal features of epigenetic inheritance and evolution in primates.Cell. 2011; 146: 1029-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Then, we checked the methylation features in various functional elements such as promoters, exons, and CpG islands (CGI). The results show that the unmethylated CpG sites are highly enriched in promoters and CGIs (Figure S1B). In general, the pattern of DNA methylation in functional regulatory elements in zebrafish is similar to that observed in mammals (Lister et al., 2009Lister R. Pelizzola M. Dowen R.H. Hawkins R.D. Hon G. Tonti-Filippini J. Nery J.R. Lee L. Ye Z.

Next, we were interested in the dynamic change in the DNA methylome in zebrafish gametes and early embryos. We plotted the average DNA methylation level across the whole genome in gametes and early embryos. Surprisingly, the methylation level of oocytes is lowest among all examined samples, whereas sperm shows the highest methylation level (Figure 1A). Oocytes (average methylation level, 80%) are globally hypomethylated compared to sperm (91%). Interestingly, after fertilization, the methylation level appears to be stable in early cleavage stages of embryos compared to the predicted level in zygote, the mean level of sperm and oocyte. From 32 cell onward, the methylation level increases gradually to achieve a comparable level to sperm upon MBT (Figure 1A). For each pair of consecutive stages, we compared the methylation level of each CpG site and called it as differentially methylated CpG if the difference in methylation level exceeded 0.2 with p value < 0.05 according to Fisher’s exact test. About 14% of CpG sites are differentially methylated CpGs between sperm and oocyte genome wide (Figure 1B). The methylation levels of most CpG sites are stable during the transitions of consecutive stages (Figure 1B), but we identified significant changes between oocyte and 1,000-cell embryos (Figure 1C). The methylomes of oocyte and sperm are significantly different (Figure 1A). But there is no significant difference between sperm and 1,000-cell embryo (Figure 1B). To investigate the potential similarities of the methylation landscape of sperm and 1,000-cell embryo, we began our analysis from oocyte-specific methylated sites (mCpG percentage ≥ 75% in oocyte and ≤ 25% in sperm) and oocyte-specific unmethylated sites (mCpG percentage ≥ 75% in sperm and ≤ 25% in oocyte). We plotted their dynamic changes across all examined stages of embryos. The methylation levels of both oocyte-specific unmethylated sites and oocyte-specific methylated sites become intermediately methylated in 16-cell embryos, which is consistent with the knowledge that the average methylation level in early embryos (16-cell embryos) is close to the mean value of oocyte and sperm (Figure 1A). Interestingly, those sites exhibit a gradual change to the similar levels seen in sperm upon MBT stage (Figures 2A and 2B ). Similar results were also observed in the other differentially methylated sites between sperm and oocyte (Figures S2A and S2B). Sites with similar methylation levels between gametes do not exhibit significant changes during embryogenesis (Figures 2C, 2D, and S2C).Figure S2Zebrafish Progenies Reset to Sperm Methylome Pattern upon Specification to MBT Stage, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A and B) Dynamic pattern of DNA methylation level for differentially methylated sites between gametes across early embryogenesis.

(D) Graphical representation of methylation level of one CGI in gametes, 32-cell and 1,000-cell embryos. Green bar highlights the position of CGI. Line vertical height indicates the methylation level. Analyses of the dynamics of CGIs further support this finding. CGIs are known as important functional genomic regions in the regulation of gene expression. The DNA methylation state of CGIs is also reprogrammed to the sperm methylation state upon MBT specification (Figures 2E, 2F, and S2D). Further analysis shows that genome-wide correlation of methylomes between sperm and early embryos becomes increasingly higher upon specification to the MBT stage (Figure 2G). In contrast, the change of correlation between methylomes of oocytes and early embryos presents an entirely reversed trend (Figure 2G). Additionally, six oocyte-specific methylated regions and ten oocyte-specific unmethylated regions were independently validated by bisulfite-sequencing PCR, which provided further proof that all the examined loci reset to sperm methylation state upon specification to MBT stage (Table S1). In summary, evidence of CpG sites, CGIs, and whole-genome correlation all support the idea that sperm defines the DNA methylome of early embryos upon specification to MBT. Upon specification to MBT, differentially methylated sites between sperm and oocyte are reset gradually to sperm methylation pattern, whereas from MBT onward, the methylome is further programmed (Figures 2A, 2B, 2E, and 2G) and becomes more and more different from sperm. But all the reprogramming to the somatic cell is based on the sperm methylation pattern, which is limited to specific regions. As a result, the methylome of somatic cells is still close to the sperm pattern. These data suggest that MBT is a transitional stage during DNA methylation reprogramming in zebrafish early embryogenesis. Next, we were interested in how the early embryo methylome becomes similar to sperm methylome upon the MBT stage. Our previous results show that there is no genome-wide DNA demethylation between gametes and early cleavage stages of embryos but that a significant number of sites are demethylated during early embryogenesis (Figure 1C). Previous reports show that the AID/Gadd45 enzyme mediates DNA demethylation in zebrafish (Rai et al., 2008Rai K. Huggins I.J. James S.R. Karpf A.R. Jones D.A. Cairns B.R. DNA demethylation in zebrafish involves the coupling of a deaminase, a glycosylase, and gadd45.Cell. 2008; 135: 1201-1212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). But, AID/Gadd45 has no activity before 4 hr postfertilization (Rai et al., 2008Rai K. Huggins I.J. James S.R. Karpf A.R. Jones D.A. Cairns B.R. DNA demethylation in zebrafish involves the coupling of a deaminase, a glycosylase, and gadd45.Cell. 2008; 135: 1201-1212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Given that oocyte-specific methylated regions become totally unmethylated by the MBT stage (around 3 hr postfertilization), we chose not to pursue the potential role of AID/Gadd45 further in this work. Several recent studies have suggested that 5hmC may be involved in paternal DNA demethylation after fertilization (Inoue and Zhang, 2011Inoue A. Zhang Y. Replication-dependent loss of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in mouse preimplantation embryos.Science. 2011; 334: 194Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar; Iqbal et al., 2011Iqbal K. Jin S.G. Pfeifer G.P. Szabó P.E. Reprogramming of the paternal genome upon fertilization involves genome-wide oxidation of 5-methylcytosine.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 3642-3647Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). To explore whether 5hmC mediates DNA demethylation in zebrafish early embryos, we used a glycosylation-mediated enrichment method (Robertson et al., 2012Robertson A.B. Dahl J.A. Ougland R. Klungland A. Pull-down of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine DNA using JBP1-coated magnetic beads.Nat. Protoc. 2012; 7: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) to detect the genomic distribution of 5hmC in sperm, 2-cell, and 16-cell embryos. Our data show a very limited number of 5hmC-enriched regions (Table S2), none of which are associated with DNA demethylation regions, thereby suggesting that 5hmC does not mediate DNA demethylation in early embryos. To further confirm this result, we measured 5hmC in 32-cell embryos with single-nucleotide resolution using Tet-assisted bisulfite sequencing (TAB-seq) (Yu et al., 2012Yu M. Hon G.C. Szulwach K.E. Song C.X. Zhang L. Kim A. Li X. Dai Q. Shen Y. Park B. et al.Base-resolution analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in the mammalian genome.Cell. 2012; 149: 1368-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). The data demonstrate a small number of 5hmC sites and no 5hmC enriched regions in 32-cell embryos (Table S3). Additionally, 5hmC is not detectable by immunofluorescence staining in zebrafish early embryos (Figure S3). Taken together, 5hmC does not mediate the DNA demethylation in zebrafish early embryos. Sperm and oocyte methylome are significantly different, but embryos reset to a methylome very similar to sperm upon MBT. To understand how differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between oocyte and sperm reprogram to the same state, we tracked the dynamic changes of oocyte-specific unmethylated loci. In this analysis, we picked up the paired reads covering at least four consecutive oocyte-specific unmethylated sites (mCpG percentage ≥ 75% in sperm and ≤ 25% in oocyte) from each stage and then calculated the methylation level of these reads. As expected, almost all paired reads in oocyte-specific unmethylated regions are highly methylated in sperm (Figure 3A, first panel) and are unmethylated in oocytes (Figure 3A, second panel). While in the cleavage 16-cell embryos, about half of the paired reads are unmethylated, and the other half are highly methylated (Figure 3A, third panel). This result is consistent with the previous finding that the average methylation level in early embryos (16-cell embryos) is close to the mean value of oocyte and sperm (Figure 1A). Similar findings were also revealed for paired reads, which covered at least four oocyte-specific methylated sites (mCpG percentage ≤ 25% in sperm and ≥ 75% in oocyte) in the 16-cell stage (Figure 3B first, second, and third panels). Two representative loci are shown in Figures 3C and S4A. Additionally, results of bisulfite-sequencing PCR show that the DNA methylation levels of both oocyte-specific methylated loci and unmethylated loci in 8-cell embryos are around 50% (Table S1). These results indicate that the DNA methylomes of 8-cell and 16-cell embryos result from the addition of sperm and oocyte methylome, thus suggesting that paternal DNA may maintain sperm methylome and maternal DNA may maintain oocyte methylome.Figure S4Oocyte Methylation Landscape Is Gradually Discarded during Early Embryogenesis, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Dynamic changes of DNA methylation for a representative locus inchr19:12,944,645-12,944,716.

Open circles represent unmethylated CpGs, and filled circles represent methylated CpGs. (B–G) All of 6 HOX genes clusters regions progressively reset to sperm methylation state. Line vertical height indicates the methylation level. To validate this, we tracked DNA methylation states of paternal and maternal DNA copies according to SNPs from crossed zebrafish, TU strain female with Tupfel long fin (TL) strain male. About two million homogenous SNPs were identified between TL and TU strains. The bisulfite-sequencing PCR method was used to examine the methylation states of 22 DMRs (Table S4). All of these loci contain SNPs, which can distinguish maternal DNA from paternal DNA. As expected, paternal DNA copies maintain the sperm methylation state, and maternal DNA copies maintain the oocyte methylation state in the 16-cell embryos. A representative locus is presented in Figure 3D. Collectively, our data demonstrate that paternal DNA copies maintain the sperm methylome and maternal DNA copies maintain the oocyte methylome, indicating that both paternal and maternal DNA use a DNA maintenance system to maintain the methylome until the 16-cell stage. Our mRNA expression data also demonstrate that maintenance methyltransferase DNMT1 is highly expressed across all of these early cleavage stages (Table S5), which is consistent with a previous report (Rai et al., 2006Rai K. Nadauld L.D. Chidester S. Manos E.J. James S.R. Karpf A.R. Cairns B.R. Jones D.A. Zebra fish Dnmt1 and Suv39h1 regulate organ-specific terminal differentiation during development.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7077-7085Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Our data show that no whole-genome DNA demethylation occurs after zebrafish fertilization, a finding that goes against previous reports that have demonstrated whole-genome DNA demethylation (MacKay et al., 2007MacKay A.B. Mhanni A.A. McGowan R.A. Krone P.H.

McGowan R.A. Global changes in genomic methylation levels during early development of the zebrafish embryo.Dev. Genes Evol. 2004; 214: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Next, we were interested in how the DNA methylome is established after the 16-cell stage. Similar to the 16-cell stage, the majority of paired-reads are still either highly methylated or unmethylated in later stages (Figures 3A and 3B). Notably, both oocyte-specific unmethylated reads (Figure 3A) and oocyte-specific methylated reads (Figure 3B) genome wide gradually decrease after the 16-cell stage, and the majority of them are changed to the sperm methylation state upon MBT. For an oocyte-specific methylated locus, the proportion of the methylated reads also gradually decreases, and the locus becomes the sperm unmethylated state in 1,000-cell stage (Figure 3C). This result indicates that demethylation of this oocyte-specific highly methylated locus occurs through passive demethylation. For an oocyte-specific unmethylated locus, the proportion of the unmethylated reads also gradually decreases, and the locus is methylated in the 1,000-cell stage (Figure S4A), indicating that de novo methylation occurs in this locus. Our messenger RNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) results show that de novo methyltransferases DNMT3, 4, 5, and 7 (ma"

To that end, we performed comprehensive transcriptional and epigenetic profiling of populations derived through directed differentiation of hESCs representing each of the three embryonic germ layers. Integration of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, and RNA sequencing reveals unique events associated with specification toward each lineage. Lineage-specific dynamic alterations in DNA methylation and H3K4me1 are evident at putative distal regulatory elements that are frequently bound by pluripotency factors in the undifferentiated hESCs. In addition, we identified germ-layer-specific H3K27me3 enrichment at sites exhibiting high DNA methylation in the undifferentiated state. A better understanding of these initial specification events will facilitate identification of deficiencies in current approaches, leading to more faithful differentiation strategies as well as providing insights into the rewiring of human regulatory programs during cellular transitions."

Following infection, this population produces a consistent ratio of effector cells that activate microbicidal functions of macrophages or help B cells make antibodies. We studied the mechanism that underlies this division of labor by tracking the progeny of single naive T cells. Different naive cells produced distinct ratios of macrophage and B cell helpers but yielded the characteristic ratio when averaged together. The effector cell pattern produced by a given naive cell correlated with the TCR-p:MHCII dwell time or the amount of p:MHCII. Thus, the consistent production of effector cell subsets by a polyclonal population of naive cells results from averaging the diverse behaviors of individual clones, which are instructed in part by the strength of TCR signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2151837778,"Compounds that restore function to the cystic fibrosis–linked ΔF508 allele of CFTR can be classified on the basis of three corrector functions, representing different targets within the five domains of the channel protein. Combinations of individual compounds in the three classes can restore considerable function to the mutant channel. The most common cystic fibrosis mutation, ΔF508 in nucleotide binding domain 1 (NBD1), impairs cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-coupled domain folding, plasma membrane expression, function and stability. VX-809, a promising investigational corrector of ΔF508-CFTR misprocessing, has limited clinical benefit and an incompletely understood mechanism, hampering drug development. Given the effect of second-site suppressor mutations, robust ΔF508-CFTR correction most likely requires stabilization of NBD1 energetics and the interface between membrane-spanning domains (MSDs) and NBD1, which are both established primary conformational defects. Here we elucidate the molecular targets of available correctors: class I stabilizes the NBD1-MSD1 and NBD1-MSD2 interfaces, and class II targets NBD2. Only chemical chaperones, surrogates of class III correctors, stabilize human ΔF508-NBD1. Although VX-809 can correct missense mutations primarily destabilizing the NBD1-MSD1/2 interface, functional plasma membrane expression of ΔF508-CFTR also requires compounds that counteract the NBD1 and NBD2 stability defects in cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cells and intestinal organoids. Thus, the combination of structure-guided correctors represents an effective approach for cystic fibrosis therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2077429965,"Early vertebrate embryos must achieve totipotency and prepare for zygotic genome activation (ZGA). To understand this process, we determined the DNA methylation (DNAme) profiles of zebrafish gametes, embryos at different stages, and somatic muscle and compared them to gene activity and histone modifications. Sperm chromatin patterns are virtually identical to those at ZGA. Unexpectedly, the DNA of many oocyte genes important for germline functions (i.e., piwil1) or early development (i.e., hox genes) is methylated, but the loci are demethylated during zygotic cleavage stages to precisely the state observed in sperm, even in parthenogenetic embryos lacking a replicating paternal genome. Furthermore, this cohort constitutes the genes and loci that acquire DNAme during development (i.e., ZGA to muscle). Finally, DNA methyltransferase inhibition experiments suggest that DNAme silences particular gene and chromatin cohorts at ZGA, preventing their precocious expression. Thus, zebrafish achieve a totipotent chromatin state at ZGA through paternal genome competency and maternal genome DNAme reprogramming."

Loss of APC leads to constitutively active WNT signaling, hyperproliferation, and tumorigenesis. Identification of pathways that facilitate tumorigenesis after APC loss is important for therapeutic development. Here, we show that RAC1 is a critical mediator of tumorigenesis after APC loss. We find that RAC1 is required for expansion of the LGR5 intestinal stem cell (ISC) signature, progenitor hyperproliferation, and transformation. Mechanistically, RAC1-driven ROS and NF-κB signaling mediate these processes. Together, these data highlight that ROS production and NF-κB activation triggered by RAC1 are critical events in CRC initiation."

Cancer is a disease driven by genetic alterations, which include single nucleotide variations (SNVs), structural variations (SVs), and aneuploidy. The spectrum of somatic SNVs studied suggests that mismatch repair deficiency and specific mutagenic exposure such as smoking, UV light, and chemotherapy can be inferred from the mutational signatures for specific tumor types (Greenman et al., 2007Greenman C.

Larger scale SVs including deletions, insertions, inversions, tandem duplications, translocations, and more complex rearrangements constitute another frequent type of alterations that could alter normal gene function in tumors.

Three main types of mechanisms known to cause SVs are homologous recombination, nonreplicative nonhomologous repair, and replication-based mechanisms (Gu et al., 2008Gu W. Zhang F. Lupski J.R. Mechanisms for human genomic rearrangements.Pathogenetics. 2008; 1: 4Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Hastings et al., 2009bHastings P.J. Lupski J.R. Rosenberg S.M. Ira G. Mechanisms of change in gene copy number.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 551-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Homologous recombination is the most common DNA repair mechanism and is generally accurate, except when the pairing is between incorrect homologous regions, as in nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR). Deficiency in homologous recombination is believed to be a major source of cancer genome instability (Hoeijmakers, 2001Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Genome maintenance mechanisms for preventing cancer.Nature. 2001; 411: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (3146) Google Scholar). For example, BRCA1 and BRCA2 are required for the homology-directed repair of chromosomal breaks, and loss of these two genes often results in genome instability and cancer (Venkitaraman, 2002Venkitaraman A.R. Cancer susceptibility and the functions of BRCA1 and BRCA2.Cell. 2002; 108: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) is a nonreplicative nonhomologous repair mechanism that requires no homology and sometimes can generate very short microhomology or small insertions at the breakpoint (Mahaney et al., 2009Mahaney B.L. Meek K. Lees-Miller S.P. Repair of ionizing radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks by non-homologous end-joining.Biochem. J. 2009; 417: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). In addition, alternative end joining (alt-EJ) mechanism, also called microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), can generate blunt ends, small insertions, and, more frequently, microhomology at the deletion breakpoints (Bennardo et al., 2008Bennardo N. Cheng A. Huang N. Stark J.M. Alternative-NHEJ is a mechanistically distinct pathway of mammalian chromosome break repair.PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e1000110Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar; McVey and Lee, 2008McVey M.

MMEJ repair of double-strand breaks (director’s cut): deleted sequences and alternative endings.Trends Genet. 2008; 24: 529-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Which factors are involved in alt-EJ is much less clear than it is for NHEJ, and alt-EJ appears to be independent of the canonical NHEJ factors such as Ku70 and XRCC4 (Arlt et al., 2012Arlt M.F. Rajendran S. Birkeland S.R. Wilson T.E. Glover T.W. De novo CNV formation in mouse embryonic stem cells occurs in the absence of Xrcc4-dependent nonhomologous end joining.PLoS Genet. 2012; 8: e1002981Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar; Bennardo et al., 2008Bennardo N. Cheng A. Huang N. Stark J.M. Alternative-NHEJ is a mechanistically distinct pathway of mammalian chromosome break repair.PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e1000110Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). NHEJ has often been implicated in tumor genomes, based on the very few overlapping sequences at breakpoints (Stephens et al., 2009Stephens P.J. McBride D.J. Lin M.-L. Varela I. Pleasance E.D. Simpson J.T. Stebbings L.A. Leroy C. Edkins S.

Stebbings L.A. et al.Massive genomic rearrangement acquired in a single catastrophic event during cancer development.Cell. 2011; 144: 27-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). For complex rearrangements, a replicative mechanism called fork stalling and template switching (FoSTeS) has been described (Lee et al., 2007Lee J.A. Carvalho C.M. Lupski J.R. A DNA replication mechanism for generating nonrecurrent rearrangements associated with genomic disorders.Cell. 2007; 131: 1235-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar), which later was generalized to microhomology-mediated break-induced repair (MMBIR). It has been proposed that the replication at the fork can stall and the polymerase can shift template via microhomology to any nearby single-stranded DNA, resulting in inversion, tandem duplication, translocation, or more complex rearrangements (Hastings et al., 2009aHastings P.J. Ira G. Lupski J.R. A microhomology-mediated break-induced replication model for the origin of human copy number variation.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000327Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar; Zhang et al., 2009Zhang F.

Genet. 2009; 41: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). A recent assessment of SV formation (mostly focusing on deletions) in a normal human population by the 1000 Genomes Project (Mills et al., 2011Mills R.E. Walter K. Stewart C. Handsaker R.E. Chen K. Alkan C. Abyzov A. Yoon S.C. Ye K. Cheetham R.K. et al.1000 Genomes ProjectMapping copy number variation by population-scale genome sequencing.Nature. 2011; 470: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar) did not address the role of replication-based mechanisms. In cancer, a recent study hypothesized that complex genomic rearrangements can arise from a single catastrophic event (Stephens et al., 2011Stephens P.J. Greenman C.D. Fu B. Yang F. Bignell G.R. Mudie L.J. Pleasance E.D. Lau K.W. Beare D. Stebbings L.A. et al.Massive genomic rearrangement acquired in a single catastrophic event during cancer development.Cell. 2011; 144: 27-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar) driven by NHEJ; similar complex rearrangements have also been observed in pathogenic germline alterations (Chiang et al., 2012Chiang C. Jacobsen J.C. Ernst C. Hanscom C. Heilbut A. Blumenthal I. Mills R.E. Kirby A. Lindgren A.M. Rudiger S.R. et al.Complex reorganization and predominant non-homologous repair following chromosomal breakage in karyotypically balanced germline rearrangements and transgenic integration.Nat. Genet. 2012; 44 (S1): 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Another study suggested that multiple amplifications in developmental delay and cognitive anomalous patients are generated by a replication-based mechanism (Liu et al., 2011Liu P. Erez A. Nagamani S.C. Dhar S.U. Kołodziejska K.E. Dharmadhikari A.V. Cooper M.L. Wiszniewska J. Zhang F. Withers M.A. et al.Chromosome catastrophes involve replication mechanisms generating complex genomic rearrangements.Cell. 2011; 146: 889-903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) because microhomology is frequently observed at the breakpoints. However, there is no comprehensive study of the mechanisms that underlie somatic SVs in cancer genomes, and many aspects are still poorly characterized, including the forces that drive SV formation, relative contribution of different mechanisms across tumor types, and whether additional mechanisms play a role. In our analysis of somatic SVs across ten tumor types, non-homology-based and microhomology-based mechanisms are consistently the dominant mutational mechanisms responsible for genomic rearrangements, driven by DNA double-strand breaks and replication errors. Importantly, multiple mechanisms sometimes act on a single gene in a genome, and two driving forces can act together on a different part of a genome to create mutations and promote tumorigenesis. To characterize the mutational spectrum of somatic SVs in cancer, it is important to identify both simple (e.g., deletion, insertion, and inversion) and complex SVs at base-pair resolution. The most common type of complex SV is a deletion with an insertion or inversion at the breakpoint (Conrad et al., 2010Conrad D.F. Bird C. Blackburne B. Lindsay S. Mamanova L. Lee C. Turner D.J. Hurles M.E. Mutation spectrum revealed by breakpoint sequencing of human germline CNVs.Nat. Genet. 2010; 42: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar; Kidd et al., 2010Kidd J.M. Graves T.

Previously, the identification of such events involved capturing and sequencing of the segments adjacent to the deletion breakpoints (Conrad et al., 2010Conrad D.F. Bird C. Blackburne B. Lindsay S.

Here, we predict both germline and somatic SVs directly from short read data, focusing on complex events such as those generated by FoSTeS/MMBIR (an example shown in Figures 1A–1D). This is made possible by a new algorithm called Meerkat (see Experimental Procedures; see also the Extended Experimental Procedures available online). With the base-pair resolution of the breakpoints identified by our method, the mechanisms forming SVs are inferred based on sequence homology at the breakpoints (Kidd et al., 2010Kidd J.M. Graves T.

Identification of somatic SVs from short read data is challenging due to several factors, including sequencing errors, GC content, and other biases in sequencing, ambiguous alignments due to repetitive sequences, a large number of germline SVs, chimeric molecules generated during library construction, normal cell contamination in tumor samples, and heterogeneity within tumor cell populations. The distinguishing feature of our method is that it considers the configuration of multiple clusters of discordant read pairs (read pairs in which the mapped reads are at unexpected distance or orientation) to recognize complex events with high accuracy, in addition to efficiently utilizing split, clipped, and multiple-aligned reads (Extended Experimental Procedures). To verify the accuracy of our method, we applied Meerkat to two HapMap genomes (NA18507 and NA12878) that have been sequenced at high coverage on the Illumina platform and for which complex deletions have been previously reported (Kidd et al., 2010Kidd J.M.

We identified a total of 3,508 and 2,327 SVs, respectively (Table S1). Of our simple deletion predictions from NA18507 and NA12878, 91.4% (2,102/2,301) and 93.7% (1,304/1,391) were reported in the Database of Genomic Variants (DGV10) (Iafrate et al., 2004Iafrate A.J. Feuk L. Rivera M.N. Listewnik M.L. Donahoe P.K. Qi Y. Scherer S.W. Lee C. Detection of large-scale variation in the human genome.Nat.

To further validate the events we detected, we randomly selected 49 events across different types in NA18507 including 24 complex deletion events. We were able to validate 48 events by PCR, including all complex deletions (Table S1). We identified a total of 379 and 253 complex deletions in NA18507 and NA12878, demonstrating that our method is far more sensitive than the previous effort, which reported 2 and 17 complex deletions, respectively (Kidd et al., 2010Kidd J.M.

Therefore, with the Meerkat algorithm, we can provide a more comprehensive spectrum of mechanisms of SVs in a genome. An example for a complex deletion in NA18507 identified by Meerkat is shown in Figures 1A–1D (the same event was reported by Kidd et al., 2010Kidd J.M. Graves T. Newman T.L. Fulton R. Hayden H.S.

With data from both tumor and germline samples for each patient to distinguish germline and somatic variants, a total of 140 pairs of genomes consisting of about half trillion (458 billion, ∼35× coverage per genome on average) paired-end reads (75–101 bp) were analyzed. A total of 25,874 high-confidence somatic SVs (Table S3) were identified from the 140 cancer genomes (Table S4), ranging from 0 to 3,160 per genome with an average of 185 (Figure 2A). To assess the accuracy of somatic SV predictions, we randomly selected 78 out of 138 SVs in an ovarian tumor (OV0725), including two complex events with two breakpoints each, and examined them in both tumor and normal tissues. By PCR, we were able to validate 73 out of 80 (91%) breakpoints (Table S3) as somatic events. The frequency of different types of somatic SVs in each sample is shown in Figure 2A. We first note the remarkable variation in the number of SVs among individuals within and across tumor types (the x axis for each tumor type is scaled differently in Figure 2A). Some genomes contain no SV (e.g., LUSC1078 and KIRC4856), whereas others show thousands of SVs (e.g., BRCAA0J6); in a single tumor type, the number of SVs can vary by an order of magnitude between individuals. Among the tumor types, breast tumors and lung squamous cell tumors have significantly more SVs than any other tumors (p = 4.70e-23 and 6.68e-5, respectively, ANOVA tests using a negative binomial model). The number of SVs identified in breast cancer patients here (16,125 in 35 patients, ∼461 per patient on average) is much larger than those in previous studies (2,166 in 24 patients, ∼90 per patient on average (Stephens et al., 2009Stephens P.J. McBride D.J. Lin M.-L. Varela I. Pleasance E.D. Simpson J.T. Stebbings L.A. Leroy C. Edkins S. Mudie L.J. et al.Complex landscapes of somatic rearrangement in human breast cancer genomes.Nature. 2009; 462: 1005-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar) and 2,476 in 22 patients, ∼113 per patient on average (Banerji et al., 2012Banerji S. Cibulskis K. Rangel-Escareno C. Brown K.K. Carter S.L. Frederick A.M. Lawrence M.S. Sivachenko A.Y. Sougnez C. Zou L. et al.Sequence analysis of mutations and translocations across breast cancer subtypes.Nature. 2012; 486: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar), due to increased sequencing coverage, sensitivity in the detection method, and sample variation. Kidney cancer patients have significantly less SVs than other tumor types (p = 1.74e-5, ANOVA test using a negative binomial model). In terms of event types, translocations (57%) are the most abundant SV type, whereas deletions and tandem duplications make up 25% and 17%, respectively. The proportions of different types of SVs across different tumor types are highly variable (Figure 2A). For instance, the breast tumors have significantly more intrachromosomal translocations than other tumors types do (p = 1.22e-53, ANOVA test using a negative binomial model). There are also considerable differences between individual genomes. For example, all rearrangements in a kidney sample (KIRC5010) are deletions, whereas there are no deletions in a liver cancer (HCC13). In nontumor samples, each individual has about 3,000 germline SVs with deletions always being the most abundant (∼60%) (Figure S2A), similar to what we find in the HapMap individual NA18507 (Figure 2A). By pairing multiple clusters of discordant reads to predict complex events, we achieved a better description of the nature of SVs than previously obtained. For example, in the PR0581 genome, a “close chain” pattern had been described to form the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene, involving C21orf45 (Berger et al., 2011Berger M.F. Lawrence M.S. Demichelis F. Drier Y. Cibulskis K. Sivachenko A.Y. Sboner A. Esgueva R. Pflueger D. Sougnez C. et al.The genomic complexity of primary human prostate cancer.Nature. 2011; 470: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). We identified two related events in this genome. The first event is a 3 Mb deletion that causes the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion. The second event is a 74 bp deletion in the first intron of C21orf45 at which the 3 Mb deletion from the first event was inserted. The copy numbers of the aforementioned regions were unchanged, supporting the two events we predicted. Detailed descriptions of the events involving CDKN2A/B, EGFR, and CDK4 are provided later. Certain pathways, such as DNA replication, DNA repair, and cell-cycle pathways, are likely to malfunction in order for the cell to generate and maintain the genomic rearrangements. To investigate this, we identified mutations in genes that in above pathways caused by SVs as well as single nucleotide variants (Bass et al., 2011Bass A.J. Lawrence M.S. Brace L.E. Ramos A.H.

However, extreme genome size reductions have been reported in the angiosperm family tree. Here we report the sequence of the 82-megabase genome of the carnivorous bladderwort plant Utricularia gibba. Despite its tiny size, the U. gibba genome accommodates a typical number of genes for a plant, with the main difference from other plant genomes arising from a drastic reduction in non-genic DNA. Unexpectedly, we identified at least three rounds of WGD in U. gibba since common ancestry with tomato (Solanum) and grape (Vitis). The compressed architecture of the U. gibba genome indicates that a small fraction of intergenic DNA, with few or no active retrotransposons, is sufficient to regulate and integrate all the processes required for the development and reproduction of a complex organism."
https://openalex.org/W2030925163,"All metazoan guts are subjected to immunologically unique conditions in which an efficient antimicrobial system operates to eliminate pathogens while tolerating symbiotic commensal microbiota. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling this process are only partially understood. Here, we show that bacterial-derived uracil acts as a ligand for dual oxidase (DUOX)-dependent reactive oxygen species generation in Drosophila gut and that the uracil production in bacteria causes inflammation in the gut. The acute and controlled uracil-induced immune response is required for efficient elimination of bacteria, intestinal cell repair, and host survival during infection of nonresident species. Among resident gut microbiota, uracil production is absent in symbionts, allowing harmonious colonization without DUOX activation, whereas uracil release from opportunistic pathobionts provokes chronic inflammation. These results reveal that bacteria with distinct abilities to activate uracil-induced gut inflammation, in terms of intensity and duration, act as critical factors that determine homeostasis or pathogenesis in gut-microbe interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2109962448,"RNAP II is frequently paused near gene promoters in mammals, and its transition to productive elongation requires active recruitment of P-TEFb, a cyclin-dependent kinase for RNAP II and other key transcription elongation factors. A fraction of P-TEFb is sequestered in an inhibitory complex containing the 7SK noncoding RNA, but it has been unclear how P-TEFb is switched from the 7SK complex to RNAP II during transcription activation. We report that SRSF2 (also known as SC35, an SR-splicing factor) is part of the 7SK complex assembled at gene promoters and plays a direct role in transcription pause release. We demonstrate RNA-dependent, coordinated release of SRSF2 and P-TEFb from the 7SK complex and transcription activation via SRSF2 binding to promoter-associated nascent RNA. These findings reveal an unanticipated SR protein function, a role for promoter-proximal nascent RNA in gene activation, and an analogous mechanism to HIV Tat/TAR for activating cellular genes."
https://openalex.org/W2086236510,"Neural circuits are regulated by activity-dependent feedback systems that tightly control network excitability and which are thought to be crucial for proper brain development. Defects in the ability to establish and maintain network homeostasis may be central to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we examine the function of the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-mTOR signaling pathway, a common target of mutations associated with epilepsy and autism spectrum disorder, in regulating activity-dependent processes in the mouse hippocampus. We find that the TSC-mTOR pathway is a central component of a positive feedback loop that promotes network activity by repressing inhibitory synapses onto excitatory neurons. In Tsc1 KO neurons, weakened inhibition caused by deregulated mTOR alters the balance of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, leading to hippocampal hyperexcitability. These findings identify the TSC-mTOR pathway as a regulator of neural network activity and have implications for the neurological dysfunction in disorders exhibiting deregulated mTOR signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2148987800,"Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is the most potent proinflammatory cytokine in mammals. The degradation of TNF-α mRNA is critical for restricting TNF-α synthesis and involves a constitutive decay element (CDE) in the 3' UTR of the mRNA. Here, we demonstrate that the CDE folds into an RNA stem-loop motif that is specifically recognized by Roquin and Roquin2. Binding of Roquin initiates degradation of TNF-α mRNA and limits TNF-α production in macrophages. Roquin proteins promote mRNA degradation by recruiting the Ccr4-Caf1-Not deadenylase complex. CDE sequences are highly conserved and are found in more than 50 vertebrate mRNAs, many of which encode regulators of development and inflammation. In macrophages, CDE-containing mRNAs were identified as the primary targets of Roquin on a transcriptome-wide scale. Thus, Roquin proteins act broadly as mediators of mRNA deadenylation by recognizing a conserved class of stem-loop RNA degradation motifs."
https://openalex.org/W2100631580,"Current theories propose that coherence of oscillatory brain activity in the gamma band (30-80 Hz) constitutes an avenue for communication among remote neural populations. However, reports documenting stimulus dependency and time variability of gamma frequency suggest that distant neuronal populations may, at any one time, operate at different frequencies precluding synchronization. To test this idea, we recorded from macaque V1 and V2 simultaneously while presenting gratings of varying contrast. Although gamma frequency increased with stimulus contrast in V1 and V2 (by ∼25 Hz), V1-V2 gamma coherence was maintained for all contrasts. Moreover, while gamma frequency fluctuated by ∼15 Hz during constant contrast stimulation, this fluctuation was highly correlated between V1 and V2. The strongest coherence connections showed a layer-specific pattern, matching feedforward anatomical connectivity. Hence, gamma coherence among remote populations can occur despite large stimulus-induced and time-dependent changes in gamma frequency, allowing communication through coherence to operate without a stimulus independent, fixed-frequency gamma channel."

Here, we identified a genome-wide, pluripotency-specific interaction network around the Nanog promoter by adapting circular chromosome conformation capture sequencing. This network was rearranged during differentiation and restored in induced pluripotent stem cells. A large fraction of Nanog-interacting loci were bound by Mediator or cohesin in pluripotent cells. Depletion of these proteins from ESCs resulted in a disruption of contacts and the acquisition of a differentiation-specific interaction pattern prior to obvious transcriptional and phenotypic changes. Similarly, the establishment of Nanog interactions during reprogramming often preceded transcriptional upregulation of associated genes, suggesting a causative link. Our results document a complex, pluripotency-specific chromatin ""interactome"" for Nanog and suggest a functional role for long-range genomic interactions in the maintenance and induction of pluripotency."

Participants’ preferences converged to those of the liked group, but diverged from the disliked group. Activation of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) tracked the discrepancy between one’s own preference and its social ideal and was associated with subsequent preference change (toward the liked and away from the disliked group), even several months later. A follow-up study found overlapping activation in this same region of dmPFC with negative monetary outcomes, but no overlap with nearby activations induced by response conflict. A single social encounter can thus result in long-lasting preference change, a mechanism that recruits dmPFC and that may reflect the aversive nature of cognitive imbalance."

However, the mechanism of clustering at CNS nodes remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the assembly of nodes of Ranvier in the CNS involves three mechanisms: a glia-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) complex containing proteoglycans and adhesion molecules that cluster NF186, paranodal axoglial junctions that function as barriers to restrict the position of nodal proteins, and axonal cytoskeletal scaffolds (CSs) that stabilize nodal Na⁺ channels. We show that while mice with a single disrupted mechanism had mostly normal nodes, disruptions of the ECM and paranodal barrier, the ECM and CS, or the paranodal barrier and CS all lead to juvenile lethality, profound motor dysfunction, and significantly reduced Na⁺ channel clustering. Our results demonstrate that ECM, paranodal, and axonal cytoskeletal mechanisms ensure robust CNS nodal Na⁺ channel clustering."

The stereotyped structure and signaling function of cilia inextricably depend on the selective segregation of molecules in cilia. However, the fundamental principles governing the access of soluble proteins to primary cilia remain unresolved. We developed a methodology termed 'chemically inducible diffusion trap at cilia' to visualize the diffusion process of a series of fluorescent proteins ranging in size from 3.2 nm to 7.9 nm into primary cilia. We found that the interior of the cilium was accessible to proteins as large as 7.9 nm. The kinetics of ciliary accumulation of this panel of proteins was exponentially limited by their Stokes radii. Quantitative modeling suggests that the diffusion barrier operates as a molecular sieve at the base of cilia.

https://openalex.org/W2061068248,"Mineral nitrogen in nature is often found in the form of nitrate (NO3(-)). Numerous microorganisms evolved to assimilate nitrate and use it as a major source of mineral nitrogen uptake. Nitrate, which is central in nitrogen metabolism, is first reduced to nitrite (NO2(-)) through a two-electron reduction reaction. The accumulation of cellular nitrite can be harmful because nitrite can be reduced to the cytotoxic nitric oxide. Instead, nitrite is rapidly removed from the cell by channels and transporters, or reduced to ammonium or dinitrogen through the action of assimilatory enzymes. Despite decades of effort no structure is currently available for any nitrate transport protein and the mechanism by which nitrate is transported remains largely unknown. Here we report the structure of a bacterial nitrate/nitrite transport protein, NarK, from Escherichia coli, with and without substrate. The structures reveal a positively charged substrate-translocation pathway lacking protonatable residues, suggesting that NarK functions as a nitrate/nitrite exchanger and that protons are unlikely to be co-transported. Conserved arginine residues comprise the substrate-binding pocket, which is formed by association of helices from the two halves of NarK. Key residues that are important for substrate recognition and transport are identified and related to extensive mutagenesis and functional studies. We propose that NarK exchanges nitrate for nitrite by a rocker switch mechanism facilitated by inter-domain hydrogen bond networks."
https://openalex.org/W2042210724,"Regulation of neuronal excitability and cardiac excitation-contraction coupling requires the proper localization of L-type Ca²⁺ channels. We show that the actin-binding protein α-actinin binds to the C-terminal surface targeting motif of α11.2, the central pore-forming Ca(V)1.2 subunit, in order to foster its surface expression. Disruption of α-actinin function by dominant-negative or small hairpin RNA constructs reduces Ca(V)1.2 surface localization in human embryonic kidney 293 and neuronal cultures and dendritic spine localization in neurons. We demonstrate that calmodulin displaces α-actinin from their shared binding site on α11.2 upon Ca²⁺ influx through L-type channels, but not through NMDAR, thereby triggering loss of Ca(V)1.2 from spines. Coexpression of a Ca²⁺-binding-deficient calmodulin mutant does not affect basal Ca(V)1.2 surface expression but inhibits its internalization upon Ca²⁺ influx. We conclude that α-actinin stabilizes Ca(V)1.2 at the plasma membrane and that its displacement by Ca²⁺-calmodulin triggers Ca²⁺-induced endocytosis of Ca(V)1.2, thus providing an important negative feedback mechanism for Ca²⁺ influx."

https://openalex.org/W2086028445,"Natural environments are uncertain. Uncertainty of emotional outcomes can induce anxiety and raise vigilance, promote and signal the opportunity for learning, modulate economic choice and regulate risk-seeking. Here we demonstrate that a subset of neurons in the anterodorsal region of the primate septum (ADS) are primarily devoted to processing uncertainty in a highly specific manner. Those neurons were selectively activated by visual cues indicating probabilistic delivery of reward (for example, 25%, 50% and 75% reward) and did not respond to cues indicating certain outcomes (0% and 100% reward). The average ADS uncertainty response was graded with the magnitude of reward uncertainty and selectively signaled uncertainty about rewards rather than punishments. The selective and graded information about reward uncertainty encoded by many neurons in the ADS may underlie modulation of uncertainty of value- and sensorimotor-related areas to regulate goal-directed behavior."

Here, we investigate the flexible and carbon source-dependent use of NADPH synthesis pathways in the cytosol of the procyclic stage. The T. brucei genome encodes two cytosolic NADPH-producing pathways, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and the NADP-dependent malic enzyme (MEc). Reverse genetic blocking of those pathways and a specific inhibitor (dehydroepiandrosterone) of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase together established redundancy with respect to H2O2 stress management and parasite growth. Blocking both pathways resulted in ∼10-fold increase of susceptibility to H2O2 stress and cell death. Unexpectedly, the same pathway redundancy was observed in glucose-rich and glucose-depleted conditions, suggesting that gluconeogenesis can feed the PPP to provide NADPH. This was confirmed by (i) a lethal phenotype of RNAi-mediated depletion of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (PGI) in the glucose-depleted Δmec/Δmec null background, (ii) an ∼10-fold increase of susceptibility to H2O2 stress observed for the Δmec/Δmec/RNAiPGI double mutant when compared with the single mutants, and (iii) the 13C enrichment of glycolytic and PPP intermediates from cells incubated with [U-13C]proline, in the absence of glucose.

The diverse functions of Bag6 are supported by its ubiquitous localization to the cytoplasm, the nucleus, and membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in cells. In ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathways, Bag6 can interact with the membrane-associated ubiquitin ligase gp78 via its ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain, but the relative low affinity of this interaction does not reconcile with the fact that a fraction of Bag6 is tightly bound to the membranes. Here, we demonstrate that the UBL domain of Bag6 is required for interaction with the ER membranes. We find that in addition to gp78, the Bag6 UBL domain also binds a UBL-binding motif in UbxD8, an essential component of the gp78 ubiquitinating machinery. Importantly, Bag6 contains a proline-rich (PR) domain termed PDP (Proline rich-DUF3587-Proline rich) that forms homo-oligomer, allowing the UBL domain to form multivalent interactions with gp78 and UbxD8, which are essential for recruitment of Bag6 to the ER membrane. Furthermore, the PR domain comprises largely intrinsically disordered segments, which are sufficient for interaction with an unfolded substrate. We propose that simultaneous association with multiple ERAD factors helps to anchor a disordered chaperone oligomer to the site of retrotranslocation to prevent protein aggregation in ERAD.Background:The Bag6-Ubl4A-Trc35 complex is localized to the ER membrane to regulate ERAD.Results:A disordered chaperoning domain in Bag6 forms homo-oligomer.

https://openalex.org/W2006269312,"Fragile X syndrome is caused by the loss of Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein that suppresses protein translation. We found that FMRP binds to Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam) RNA, a molecule that is involved in neural development and has been implicated in Down syndrome. Elevated Dscam protein levels in FMRP null Drosophila and in flies with three copies of the Dscam gene both produced specific and similar synaptic targeting errors in a hard-wired neural circuit, which impaired the flies' sensory perception. Reducing Dscam levels in FMRP null flies reduced synaptic targeting errors and rescued behavioral responses. Our results indicate that excess Dscam protein may be a common molecular mechanism underlying altered neural wiring in intellectual disabilities such as Fragile X and Down syndromes."
https://openalex.org/W2082771349,"Kidney podocytes are highly specialized terminally differentiated cells that form the final barrier to urinary protein loss. Podocytes are a target for injury by metabolic, autoimmune, hereditary, inflammatory, and other stressors. Persistence of podocyte injury leads to podocyte death and loss, which results in progressive kidney damage and ultimately kidney failure. Dendrin is a dual compartment protein with proapoptotic signaling properties. Nuclear relocation of dendrin in response to glomerular injury promotes podocyte apoptosis. Here we show that Yes-associated protein (YAP), a downstream target of Hippo kinases and an inhibitor of apoptosis, is expressed in the nucleus of podocytes. The WW domains of YAP mediate the interaction with the PPXY motifs of dendrin. This interaction is functionally relevant because YAP binding to dendrin reduces dendrin-dependent, staurosporine-induced apoptosis in co-transfected HEK293 cells. Moreover gene silencing of YAP in podocytes increases adriamycin-induced podocyte apoptosis. It also increases staurosporine-induced caspase-3/7 activity, which is rescued by dendrin depletion in YAP knockdown cells. Our findings elucidate YAP binding to dendrin as a prosurvival mechanism. The antiapoptotic signaling properties of YAP in podocytes could hold significance in the quest for targeted therapeutics aimed at preventing podocyte loss."
https://openalex.org/W2058330808,"How is visual space represented in cortical area MT+? At a relatively coarse scale, the organization of MT+ is debated; retinotopic, spatiotopic, or mixed representations have all been proposed. However, none of these representations entirely explain the perceptual localization of objects at a fine spatial scale--a scale relevant for tasks like navigating or manipulating objects. For example, perceived positions of objects are strongly modulated by visual motion; stationary flashes appear shifted in the direction of nearby motion. Does spatial coding in MT+ reflect these shifts in perceived position? We performed an fMRI experiment employing this ""flash-drag"" effect and found that flashes presented near motion produced patterns of activity similar to physically shifted flashes in the absence of motion. This reveals a motion-dependent change in the neural representation of object position in human MT+, a process that could help compensate for perceptual and motor delays in localizing objects in dynamic scenes."
https://openalex.org/W1969473557,"Hypoxia promotes tumor evolution and metastasis, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a key regulator of hypoxia-related cellular processes in cancer. The eIF4E translation initiation factors, eIF4E1, eIF4E2, and eIF4E3, are essential for translation initiation. However, whether and how HIF-1α affects cap-dependent translation through eIF4Es in hypoxic cancer cells has been unknown. Here, we report that HIF-1α promoted cap-dependent translation of selective mRNAs through up-regulation of eIF4E1 in hypoxic breast cancer cells. Hypoxia-promoted breast cancer tumorsphere growth was HIF-1α-dependent. We found that eIF4E1, not eIF4E2 or eIF4E3, is the dominant eIF4E family member in breast cancer cells under both normoxia and hypoxia conditions. eIF4E3 expression was largely sequestered in breast cancer cells at normoxia and hypoxia. Hypoxia up-regulated the expression of eIF4E1 and eIF4E2, but only eIF4E1 expression was HIF-1α-dependent. In hypoxic cancer cells, HIF-1α-up-regulated eIF4E1 enhanced cap-dependent translation of a subset of mRNAs encoding proteins important for breast cancer cell mammosphere growth. In searching for correlations, we discovered that human eIF4E1 promoter harbors multiple potential hypoxia response elements. Furthermore, using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase and point mutation assays, we found that HIF-1α utilized hypoxia response elements in the human eIF4E1 proximal promoter region to activate eIF4E1 expression. Our study suggests that HIF-1α promotes cap-dependent translation of selective mRNAs through up-regulating eIF4E1, which contributes to tumorsphere growth of breast cancer cells at hypoxia. The data shown provide new insights into protein synthesis mechanisms in cancer cells at low oxygen levels. Background: Hypoxia promotes tumor growth, but connections to translation mechanisms are obscure. Results: Hypoxia-enhanced tumorsphere growth of breast cancer cells is HIF-1α-dependent, and HIF-1α up-regulates eIF4E1 in hypoxic cancer cells. Conclusion: HIF-1α promotes cap-dependent translation of selective mRNAs through up-regulating eIF4E1 in cancer cells at hypoxia. Significance: Our study provides new insights into the translation mechanisms in cancer cells under low O2 concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2018378535,"Axon pruning during development is essential for proper wiring of the mature nervous system, but its regulation remains poorly understood. We have identified an immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) transmembrane protein, Plum, that is cell autonomously required for axon pruning of mushroom body (MB) γ neurons and for ectopic synapse refinement at the developing neuromuscular junction in Drosophila. Plum promotes MB γ neuron axon pruning by regulating the expression of Ecdysone Receptor-B1, a key initiator of axon pruning. Genetic analyses indicate that Plum acts to facilitate signaling of Myoglianin, a glial-derived TGF-β, on MB γ neurons upstream of the type-I TGF-β receptor Baboon. Myoglianin, Baboon, and Ecdysone Receptor-B1 are also required for neuromuscular junction ectopic synapse refinement. Our study highlights both IgSF proteins and TGF-β facilitation as key promoters of developmental axon elimination and demonstrates a mechanistic conservation between MB axon pruning during metamorphosis and the refinement of ectopic larval neuromuscular connections."
https://openalex.org/W2040824502,"Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) is the most potent inhibitor of myogenic differentiation (MyoD) of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS); however, the underlying mechanisms of this inhibition remain unclear. In this study, we identified novel TGF-β1-related microRNAs (miRNAs); among these, miR-450b-5p is significantly regulated by TGF-β1. We provide evidence that TGF-β1 exerts it function by suppressing miR-450b-5p. Both in cultured cells and tumor implants, miR-450b-5p significantly arrested the growth of RMS and promoted its MyoD. Utilizing a bioinformatics approach, we identified miR-450b-5p target mRNAs. Among these candidates, only the expression of ecto-NOX disulfide-thiol exchanger 2 (ENOX2) and paired box 9 (PAX9) was augmented by miR-450b-5p knockdown examined by western blot; the engineered inhibition antagonized TGF-β1-mediated differentiation inhibition. Furthermore, we found that the Smad3 and Smad4 pathways, but not Smad2, are the principal mediator of TGF-β1 suppression of miR-450b-5p. Taken together, these results suggest that disrupting the TGF-β1 suppression of miR-450b-5p, or knockdown of ENOX2 and PAX9, are effective approaches in inducing RMS MyoD."
https://openalex.org/W2073621719,"Met tyrosine kinase has been implicated in tumorigenesis and metastasis; its overexpression and deregulation is often observed in cancer. Although Met's functions in cell motility has been studied extensively, its involvement in bleb-based, amoeboid motility is yet to be determined. The aim of this work is to study the role of Met in amoeboid cell motility and invasion. We show that aggressive breast cancer cells expressing high levels of endogenous Met, as well as HEK293T cells over expressing fluorescent Met, exhibit constitutive, ligand-independent Met activation, leading to Met-dependent membrane blebbing and amoeboid cell motility; HEK293T cells over expressing fluorescent Met were able to invade in three-dimensional matrix. Hyper-activated Met mutant significantly enhances blebbing and cell motility. Met inhibition by either a Met-specific inhibitor or by exogenous expression of a dominant-negative Met remarkably repressed membrane blebbing and invasion. Inhibition of Rho signaling pathway by a ROCK inhibitor also represses Met-induced blebbing, suggesting that Met regulates the blebbing machinery through Rho-ROCK pathway, which controls the actin-myosin contractile force. Either de-polymerization or hyper-polymerization of the actin cytoskeleton abrogates Met-induced blebbing, signifying that actin polymerization has a role in halting and retracting Met-induced mature blebs. Indeed, when blebs retract, membrane wrinkles containing high levels of Met and actin are generated, indicating localized formation of Met-signaling microdomains. We suggest that this bleb-based activity is induced by amplification of Met signaling in unique membrane domains generated by bleb retraction. Our results indicate that Met-induced blebbing has an important role in cell detachment, amoeboid motility and invasion ability, which are utilized by cancer cells for migration and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2043847943,"Complex links between infection and cancer suggest that we still can learn much about tumorigenesis by studying how infectious agents hijack the host cell machinery. We studied the effects of an intracellular parasite called Theileria that infects bovine leukocytes and turns them into invasive cancer-like cells. We investigated the host cells pathways that are deregulated in infected leukocytes and might link infection and lymphoproliferative disease. We show that intracellular Theileria parasites drive a Warburg-like phenotype in infected host leukocytes, characterized by increased expression of metabolic regulators, increased glucose uptake and elevated lactate production, which were lost when the parasite was eliminated. The cohabitation of the parasites within the host cells leads to disruption of the redox balance (as measured by reduced/oxidized glutathione ratio) and elevated ROS (reactive oxygen species) levels, associated with chronic stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1α). Inhibition of HIF1α (pharmacologically or genetically), or treatment with antioxidants, led to a marked reduction in expression of aerobic glycolytic genes and inhibited the transformed phenotype. These data show that stabilization of HIF1α, following increased ROS production, modulates host glucose metabolism and is critical for parasite-induced transformation. Our study expands knowledge about the molecular strategy used by the parasite Theileria to induce the transformed phenotypes of infected cells via reprogramming of glucose metabolism and redox signaling."

Here, we explored a key role of the secreted glycoprotein YKL-40, a mesenchymal marker, in the interaction between endothelial cells and mesenchymal mural-like cells for tumor angiogenesis. Xenotransplantation of tumor-derived mural-like cells (GSDCs) expressing YKL-40 in mice developed extensive and stable blood vessels covered with more GSDCs than those in YKL-40 gene knockdown tumors. YKL-40 expressed by GSDCs was associated with increased interaction of neural cadherin/β-catenin/smooth muscle alpha actin; thus, mediating cell-cell adhesion and permeability. YKL-40 also induced the interaction of vascular endothelial cadherin/β-catenin/actin in endothelial cells (HMVECs). In cell co-culture systems, YKL-40 enhanced both GSDC and HMVEC contacts, restricted vascular leakage, and stabilized vascular networks. Collectively, the data inform new mechanistic insights into the cooperation of mural cells with endothelial cells induced by YKL-40 during tumor angiogenesis, and also enhance our understanding of YKL-40 in both mural and endothelial cell biology."

Mutant channels with reduced activity are a cause of congenital hyperinsulinism, whereas hyperactive channels are a cause of neonatal diabetes. A current regulatory model proposes that ATP hydrolysis is required to switch SUR1 into post-hydrolytic conformations able to antagonize the inhibitory action of nucleotide binding at the Kir6.2 pore, thus coupling enzymatic and channel activities. Alterations in SUR1 ATPase activity are proposed to contribute to neonatal diabetes and type 2 diabetes risk. The regulatory model is partly based on the reduced ability of ATP analogs such as adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate (AMP-PNP) and adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) (ATPγS) to stimulate channel activity, presumably by reducing hydrolysis. This study uses a substitution at the catalytic glutamate, SUR1E1507Q, with a significantly increased affinity for ATP, to probe the action of these ATP analogs on conformational switching. ATPγS, a slowly hydrolyzable analog, switches SUR1 conformations, albeit with reduced affinity. Nonhydrolyzable AMP-PNP and adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylenetriphosphate) (AMP-PCP) alone fail to switch SUR1, but do reverse ATP-induced switching. AMP-PCP displaces 8-azido-[32P]ATP from the noncanonical NBD1 of SUR1. This is consistent with structural data on an asymmetric bacterial ABC protein that shows that AMP-PNP binds selectively to the noncanonical NBD to prevent conformational switching.

Contrary to the current model, we observed that the binding of ATP, without hydrolysis, is sufficient to switch SUR1 from conformations with high affinity for glibenclamide (GBC), a KATP channel antagonist, to conformations with reduced antagonist affinity, but a markedly enhanced affinity for the channel agonist diazoxide, i.e. from nonstimulatory to stimulatory states (31Ortiz D. Voyvodic P. Gossack L. Quast U. Bryan J. Two Neonatal diabetes mutations on transmembrane helix 15 of SUR1 increase affinity for ATP and ADP at nucleotide binding domain 2.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 17985-17995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). ATP4−, in the absence of Mg2+ required for enzymatic activity (17de Wet H. Mikhailov M.V. Fotinou C.

Studies of the ATPase activity of the ABC protein SUR1.FEBS J. 2007; 274: 3532-3544Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), efficiently switched the conformations of wild-type (WT) SUR1 and mutant receptors known to hyperactivate Kir6.2 pores and thus cause neonatal diabetes (ND). The ND mutant receptors, SUR1Q1178R and SUR1R1182Q, substitutions outside the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), have increased affinities for MgATP and ATP4−, consistent with their spending more time in stimulatory conformations able to increase channel activity. Structural studies on multiple ABC proteins show that ATP binding to the NBDs induces the formation of an NBD dimer with two ATP molecules sandwiched in the dimer interface. Dimerization drives reconfiguration of the transmembrane helix bundles from inward-to-outward-facing conformations (reviewed in Refs. 32Higgins C.F. Linton K.J.

ABC transporters: the power to change.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 10: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Therefore we proposed that ATP binding and NBD dimerization, without hydrolysis, drive SUR1 from a nonstimulatory, inward-facing conformation with highest affinity for GBC to an outward-facing stimulatory state with >10-fold reduced affinity for GBC and >100-fold increased affinity for channel agonists (31Ortiz D.

AMP-PNP stabilizes NBD dimers of symmetric ABC proteins in outward-facing configurations with two bound nucleotides (34Dawson R.J. Locher K.P.

On the other hand, the structure of an asymmetric ABC protein, TM287/288 from Thermotoga maritima, shows a single AMP-PNP bound to an inward-facing conformation (36Hohl M. Briand C. Grütter M.G.

The sensitivity of the analysis was improved by using SUR1 substitutions with increased affinities for ATP. These include SUR1Q1178R identified with hyperactive KATP channels in an ND patient (41Christesen H.B.T. Sjöblad S. Brusgaard K. Papadopoulou D. Jacobsen B.B.

The Glu → Gln substitution, in the highly conserved catalytic glutamate of SUR1 NBD2, dramatically reduces enzymatic activity (≥500-fold) in other ABC proteins (43Tombline G. Bartholomew L.A.

Under equilibrium conditions, we found that SUR1E1507Q binds ATP4− nearly 150 times more tightly than WT, showing that charge at position 1507 in the conserved Walker B phosphate-binding domain is a significant determinant of nucleotide affinity. For comparison, the affinity of SUR1Q1178R, a substitution outside the NBDs, is intermediate between WT and E1507Q. The inclusion of Mg2+ increases the affinity for ATP by ≥100-fold. ATPγS fully supports switching with or without Mg2+, but SUR1 has a reduced affinity for this analog versus ATP. In contrast, MgAMP-PNP and MgAMP-PCP (AMP-PxP) alone do not affect GBC binding at high concentration, but fully reverse the action of added MgATP in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, AMP-PCP displaces 8-azido-[32P]ATP from the noncanonical NBD1 of SUR1. The results are consistent with studies on two other asymmetric ABC proteins that demonstrate that AMP-PNP selectively binds the noncanonical NBD1 of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) with high affinity, but binds NBD2 with much lower affinity (48Aleksandrov L. Aleksandrov A.A. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R.

Briand C. Grütter M.G. Seeger M.A. Crystal structure of a heterodimeric ABC transporter in its inward-facing conformation.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We propose that AMP-PxP act on SURs to reduce channel activity by stabilizing an inward-facing conformation, and thus the actions of AMP-PxP reflect the asymmetry of SURs, rather than inhibition of ATP hydrolysis per se. The procedures used to express WT and mutant SUR1 in Pichia pastoris, to isolate membranes, and to carry out 3H-labeled GBC binding experiments were described previously (31Ortiz D. Voyvodic P. Gossack L. Quast U. Bryan J. Two Neonatal diabetes mutations on transmembrane helix 15 of SUR1 increase affinity for ATP and ADP at nucleotide binding domain 2.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 17985-17995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). An additional wash step was added in the membrane isolation protocol to reduce carryover of endogenous nucleotides. 3H-labeled GBC was held fixed at 1 nm, and the reactions included the indicated concentrations of nucleotides. Experiments with MgATP (free [Mg2+] > 1 mm) included a creatine phosphokinase-based ATP-regenerating system to maintain a constant concentration of ATP over the 30-min incubation (50Löffler-Walz C. Quast U. Binding of KATP channel modulators in rat cardiac membranes.Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 123: 1395-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The stability of ATP levels was verified using luciferase assays (Sigma). Experiments with MgADP included 10 mm AMP to inhibit endogenous adenylate kinases to reduce ATP production. Experiments with MgADP and MgATP analogs, where a regenerating system was not required, included 1 mm free Mg2+. Mg2+-free experiments included 1 mm EDTA. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled GBC and was typically 15% of total binding. The results are plotted as Specific bound GBC=specific bound(+X)specific bound(−X)(Eq.1) where X is the reagent whose effect is being assayed, e.g. ± ATP4−, etc. 8-azido-[32P]ATP photolabeling and densitometry were done as described previously (31Ortiz D. Voyvodic P. Gossack L. Quast U. Bryan J. Two Neonatal diabetes mutations on transmembrane helix 15 of SUR1 increase affinity for ATP and ADP at nucleotide binding domain 2.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 17985-17995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The equations for the equilibrium models were derived following Wyman and Gill (51Wyman J. Gill S.J. Binding and Linkage: Functional Chemistry of Biological Macromolecules. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1990Google Scholar); the algebraic manipulations were done using Mathematica (Wolfram Research, Champaign, IL). The binding equations were derived from the binding partition functions, the sum of the contributions of the different species relative to one reference species, taken here as the unliganded receptor, R. The eight-state allosteric model shown in Fig. 4C is used as an example. The model describes the linkage between the equilibrium binding of MgAMP-PNP (A), 3H-labeled GBC (G), and MgATP (T) on SUR1E1507Q (R). KA is the equilibrium dissociation constant for binding of A, KG is the constant for G, and K1 and K2 are the constants for the binding of T to NBD1 and NBD2, respectively. α, β, and γ are allosteric constants. α = γ = 1 because previous data indicate that binding of nucleotide to NBD1 alone does not alter GBC binding (31Ortiz D. Voyvodic P. Gossack L. Quast U. Bryan J. Two Neonatal diabetes mutations on transmembrane helix 15 of SUR1 increase affinity for ATP and ADP at nucleotide binding domain 2.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 17985-17995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). β is the allosteric constant reflecting the linkage between GBC binding and structural changes associated with occupation of both NBDs. For β > 1, nucleotide binding reduces the affinity of SUR1 for sulfonylureas. The partition function for the eight-state model is p=[R]+[RA]+[RG]+[TRT]+[TRG]+[TRTG]+[ARG][R](Eq.2) where TR and TRT indicate binding at NBD1 and both NBD1 and NBD2, respectively. Substituting dissociation constants gives the binding polynomial. p=1+AKA+GKG+TK1+T2K1K2+GTαK1KG+GT2βK1K2KG+AGγKAKG(Eq.3) Ḡ, the amount of 3H-labeled GBC specifically bound per mole of SUR1, which is dependent on [G], [T], and [A], is given by G¯=∂lnP∂lnG=[G]P∂P∂G(Eq.4) where G¯=G(1KG+TαK1KG+T2βK1K2KG+AγKAKG)1+AKA+GKG+TK1+T2K1K2+GTαK1KG+GT2βK1K2KG+AGγKAKG(Eq.5) The plotted experimental variable, specific bound GBC, is defined as Ḡ /Ḡno ATP. Parameters were estimated using nonlinear fit models in the Mathematica environment with α = γ = 1 and predetermined values of β, KG, and G. The equation for the four-state equilibrium model is. G¯=G(1KG+TβKGKT)1+GKG+TKT+GTβKGKT(Eq.6) Fittings were estimated using predetermined values for KG. Where indicated, the IC50 values were estimated by fitting a logistic equation. The means ± S.E. are plotted; the number of replicate experiments varies, but n ≥ 3 in all cases. The effect of ATP on SUR1 conformation was determined using GBC as a conformational probe. Fig. 1 shows that ATP, with or without Mg2+, has a strong negative effect on GBC binding. ATP effectively switches WT and substituted SURs from inward-facing conformations with highest affinities for GBC to outward-facing states with reduced affinities as shown schematically. The apparent differences in affinity, judged for example by their IC50 values (panel A and Table 1), is ∼430-fold for WT versus SUR1E1507Q; the value for SUR1Q1178R, characterized previously, is intermediate (31Ortiz D. Voyvodic P. Gossack L. Quast U. Bryan J. Two Neonatal diabetes mutations on transmembrane helix 15 of SUR1 increase affinity for ATP and ADP at nucleotide binding domain 2.J. Biol.

Comparison of panels A and B shows that Mg2+ significantly increases the apparent affinity of all three receptors for ATP.TABLE 1Binding parameters (KG, IC50, and KT values) for WT, Q1178R, and E1507QKGIC50KTMgATPMgADPMgATP (β)ATP4− (βMgATPγS (β)ATPγS4− (β)WT0.25 ± 0.021163 ± 439161 ± 28—13,400 ± 3360 (15.1 ± 9.4)——Q1178R1.0 ± 0.117 ± 325 ± 2—2550 ± 290 (9.2 ± 1.4)——E1507Q0.63 ± 0.162.7 ± 0.4—1 ± 0.2 (40 ± 3)94 ± 8 (40 ± 1)29 ± 7 (11.6 ± 3)234 ± 31 (3.2 ± 0.1) Open table in a new tab The E1507Q and Q1178R substitutions do not have large effects on the affinities of the apo-receptors for GBC, given by the dissociation constants (KG), which are determined in independent experiments (Table 1).

https://openalex.org/W2077317247,"During the formation of neuronal circuits, axon pathfinding decisions specify the location of synapses on the correct brain side and in correct target areas. We investigated a possible link between axon midline crossing and the subsequent development of output synapses formed by these axons. Conditional knockout of Robo3 in the auditory system forced a large commissural synapse, the calyx of Held, to be exclusively formed on the wrong, ipsilateral side. Ipsilateral calyx of Held synapses showed strong transmission defects, with reduced and desynchronized transmitter release, fewer fast-releasable vesicles, and smaller and more variable presynaptic Ca2+ currents. Transmission defects were not observed in a downstream inhibitory synapse, and some defects persisted into adulthood. These results suggest that axon midline crossing conditions functional maturation of commissural synapses, thereby minimizing the impact of mislocalized synapses on information processing. This mechanism might be relevant to human disease caused by mutations in the ROBO3 gene."
https://openalex.org/W2142952771,"The vesicle fusion reaction in regulated exocytosis requires the concerted action of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) core fusion engine and a group of SNARE-binding regulatory factors. The regulatory mechanisms of vesicle fusion remain poorly understood in most exocytic pathways. Here, we reconstituted the SNARE-dependent vesicle fusion reaction of GLUT4 exocytosis in vitro using purified components. Using this defined fusion system, we discovered that the regulatory factor synip binds to GLUT4 exocytic SNAREs and inhibits the docking, lipid mixing, and content mixing of the fusion reaction. Synip arrests fusion by binding the target membrane SNARE (t-SNARE) complex and preventing the initiation of ternary SNARE complex assembly. Although synip also interacts with the syntaxin-4 monomer, it does not inhibit the pairing of syntaxin-4 with SNAP-23. Interestingly, synip selectively arrests the fusion reactions reconstituted with its cognate SNAREs, suggesting that the defined system recapitulates the biological functions of the vesicle fusion proteins. We further showed that the inhibitory function of synip is dominant over the stimulatory activity of Sec1/Munc18 proteins. Importantly, the inhibitory function of synip is distinct from how other fusion inhibitors arrest SNARE-dependent membrane fusion and therefore likely represents a novel regulatory mechanism of vesicle fusion."
