https://openalex.org/W2059146372,"Conservation priority setting based on phylogenetic diversity has frequently been proposed but rarely implemented. Here, we define a simple index that measures the contribution made by different species to phylogenetic diversity and show how the index might contribute towards species-based conservation priorities. We describe procedures to control for missing species, incomplete phylogenetic resolution and uncertainty in node ages that make it possible to apply the method in poorly known clades. We also show that the index is independent of clade size in phylogenies of more than 100 species, indicating that scores from unrelated taxonomic groups are likely to be comparable. Similar scores are returned under two different species concepts, suggesting that the index is robust to taxonomic changes. The approach is applied to a near-complete species-level phylogeny of the Mammalia to generate a global priority list incorporating both phylogenetic diversity and extinction risk. The 100 highest-ranking species represent a high proportion of total mammalian diversity and include many species not usually recognised as conservation priorities. Many species that are both evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered (EDGE species) do not benefit from existing conservation projects or protected areas. The results suggest that global conservation priorities may have to be reassessed in order to prevent a disproportionately large amount of mammalian evolutionary history becoming extinct in the near future."
https://openalex.org/W2046766973,"Sharing research data provides benefit to the general scientific community, but the benefit is less obvious for the investigator who makes his or her data available.We examined the citation history of 85 cancer microarray clinical trial publications with respect to the availability of their data. The 48% of trials with publicly available microarray data received 85% of the aggregate citations. Publicly available data was significantly (p = 0.006) associated with a 69% increase in citations, independently of journal impact factor, date of publication, and author country of origin using linear regression.This correlation between publicly available data and increased literature impact may further motivate investigators to share their detailed research data."
https://openalex.org/W2038294038,"The quest to determine how precise neural activity patterns mediate computation, behavior, and pathology would be greatly aided by a set of tools for reliably activating and inactivating genetically targeted neurons, in a temporally precise and rapidly reversible fashion. Having earlier adapted a light-activated cation channel, channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), for allowing neurons to be stimulated by blue light, we searched for a complementary tool that would enable optical neuronal inhibition, driven by light of a second color. Here we report that targeting the codon-optimized form of the light-driven chloride pump halorhodopsin from the archaebacterium Natronomas pharaonis (hereafter abbreviated Halo) to genetically-specified neurons enables them to be silenced reliably, and reversibly, by millisecond-timescale pulses of yellow light. We show that trains of yellow and blue light pulses can drive high-fidelity sequences of hyperpolarizations and depolarizations in neurons simultaneously expressing yellow light-driven Halo and blue light-driven ChR2, allowing for the first time manipulations of neural synchrony without perturbation of other parameters such as spiking rates. The Halo/ChR2 system thus constitutes a powerful toolbox for multichannel photoinhibition and photostimulation of virally or transgenically targeted neural circuits without need for exogenous chemicals, enabling systematic analysis and engineering of the brain, and quantitative bioengineering of excitable cells."
https://openalex.org/W1978346502,"Antimicrobial resistance in Yersinia pestis is rare, yet constitutes a significant international public health and biodefense threat. In 1995, the first multidrug resistant (MDR) isolate of Y. pestis (strain IP275) was identified, and was shown to contain a self-transmissible plasmid (pIP1202) that conferred resistance to many of the antimicrobials recommended for plague treatment and prophylaxis. Comparative analysis of the DNA sequence of Y. pestis plasmid pIP1202 revealed a near identical IncA/C plasmid backbone that is shared by MDR plasmids isolated from Salmonella enterica serotype Newport SL254 and the fish pathogen Yersinia ruckeri YR71. The high degree of sequence identity and gene synteny between the plasmid backbones suggests recent acquisition of these plasmids from a common ancestor. In addition, the Y. pestis pIP1202-like plasmid backbone was detected in numerous MDR enterobacterial pathogens isolated from retail meat samples collected between 2002 and 2005 in the United States. Plasmid-positive strains were isolated from beef, chicken, turkey and pork, and were found in samples from the following states: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York and Oregon. Our studies reveal that this common plasmid backbone is broadly disseminated among MDR zoonotic pathogens associated with agriculture. This reservoir of mobile resistance determinants has the potential to disseminate to Y. pestis and other human and zoonotic bacterial pathogens and therefore represents a significant public health concern."
https://openalex.org/W2042943373,"Invertebrates have contributed greatly to our understanding of associative learning because they allow learning protocols to be combined with experimental access to the nervous system. The honeybee Apis mellifera constitutes a standard model for the study of appetitive learning and memory since it was shown, almost a century ago, that bees learn to associate different sensory cues with a reward of sugar solution. However, up to now, no study has explored aversive learning in bees in such a way that simultaneous access to its neural bases is granted. Using odorants paired with electric shocks, we conditioned the sting extension reflex, which is exhibited by harnessed bees when subjected to a noxious stimulation. We show that this response can be conditioned so that bees learn to extend their sting in response to the odorant previously punished. Bees also learn to extend the proboscis to one odorant paired with sugar solution and the sting to a different odorant paired with electric shock, thus showing that they can master both appetitive and aversive associations simultaneously. Responding to the appropriate odorant with the appropriate response is possible because two different biogenic amines, octopamine and dopamine subserve appetitive and aversive reinforcement, respectively. While octopamine has been previously shown to substitute for appetitive reinforcement, we demonstrate that blocking of dopaminergic, but not octopaminergic, receptors suppresses aversive learning. Therefore, aversive learning in honeybees can now be accessed both at the behavioral and neural levels, thus opening new research avenues for understanding basic mechanisms of learning and memory."
https://openalex.org/W2146068085,"Background Disruption of the intestinal homeostasis and tolerance towards the resident microbiota is a major mechanism involved in the development of inflammatory bowel disease. While some bacteria are inducers of disease, others, known as probiotics, are able to reduce inflammation. Because dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in regulating immune responses and in inducing tolerance, we investigated their role in the anti-inflammatory potential of probiotic lactic acid bacteria. Methodology/Principal Findings Selected LAB strains, while efficiently taken up by DCs in vitro, induced a partial maturation of the cells. Transfer of probiotic-treated DCs conferred protection against 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. Protection was associated with a reduction of inflammatory scores and colonic expression of pro-inflammatory genes, while a high local expression of the immunoregulatory enzyme indolamine 2, 3 dioxgenase (IDO) was observed. The preventive effect of probiotic-pulsed DCs required not only MyD88-, TLR2- and NOD2-dependent signaling but also the induction of CD4+ CD25+ regulatory cells in an IL-10-independent pathway. Conclusions/Significance Altogether, these results suggest that selected probiotics can stimulate DC regulatory functions by targeting specific pattern-recognition receptors and pathways. The results not only emphasize the role of DCs in probiotic immune interactions, but indicate a possible role in immune-intervention therapy for IBD."
https://openalex.org/W2019887475,"Streptococcus suis serotype 2 (SS2) is an important zoonotic pathogen, causing more than 200 cases of severe human infection worldwide, with the hallmarks of meningitis, septicemia, arthritis, etc. Very recently, SS2 has been recognized as an etiological agent for streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS), which was originally associated with Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) in Streptococci. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying STSS are poorly understood.To elucidate the genetic determinants of STSS caused by SS2, whole genome sequencing of 3 different Chinese SS2 strains was undertaken. Comparative genomics accompanied by several lines of experiments, including experimental animal infection, PCR assay, and expression analysis, were utilized to further dissect a candidate pathogenicity island (PAI). Here we show, for the first time, a novel molecular insight into Chinese isolates of highly invasive SS2, which caused two large-scale human STSS outbreaks in China. A candidate PAI of approximately 89 kb in length, which is designated 89K and specific for Chinese SS2 virulent isolates, was investigated at the genomic level. It shares the universal properties of PAIs such as distinct GC content, consistent with its pivotal role in STSS and high virulence.To our knowledge, this is the first PAI candidate from S. suis worldwide. Our finding thus sheds light on STSS triggered by SS2 at the genomic level, facilitates further understanding of its pathogenesis and points to directions of development on some effective strategies to combat highly pathogenic SS2 infections."
https://openalex.org/W2033671240,"We identify matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8, the polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocyte collagenase, as a critical mediator initiating lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-responsiveness in vivo. PMN infiltration towards LPS is abrogated in Mmp8-null mice. MMP-8 cleaves LPS-induced CXC chemokine (LIX) at Ser4∼Val5 and Lys79∼Arg80. LIX bioactivity is increased upon N-terminal cleavage, enhancing intracellular calcium mobilization and chemotaxis upon binding its cognate receptor, CXCR2. As there is no difference in PMN chemotaxis in Mmp8-null mice compared with wild-type mice towards synthetic analogues of MMP-8-cleaved LIX, MMP-8 is not essential for extravasation or cell migration in collagenous matrices in vivo. However, with biochemical redundancy between MMPs 1, 2, 9, and 13, which also cleave LIX at position 4∼5, it was surprising to observe such a markedly reduced PMN infiltration towards LPS and LIX in Mmp8-/- mice. This lack of physiological redundancy in vivo identifies MMP-8 as a key mediator in the regulation of innate immunity. Comparable results were found with CXCL8/IL-8 and CXCL5/ENA-78, the human orthologues of LIX. MMP-8 cleaves CXCL8 at Arg5-Ser6 and at Val7-Leu8 in CXCL5 to activate respective chemokines. Hence, rather than collagen, these PMN chemoattractants are important MMP-8 substrates in vivo; PMN-derived MMP-8 cleaves and activates LIX to execute an in cis PMN-controlled feed-forward mechanism to orchestrate the initial inflammatory response and promote LPS responsiveness in tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1998410431,"The human amygdala is thought to play a pivotal role in the processing of emotionally significant sensory information. The major subdivisions of the human amygdala—the laterobasal group (LB), the superficial group (SF), and the centromedial group (CM)—have been anatomically delineated, but the functional response properties of these amygdala subregions in humans are still unclear. We combined functional MRI with cyto-architectonically defined probabilistic maps to analyze the response characteristics of amygdala subregions in subjects presented with auditory stimuli. We found positive auditory stimulation-related signal changes predominantly in probabilistically defined LB, and negative responses predominantly in SF and CM. In the left amygdala, mean response magnitude in the core area of LB with 90–100% assignment probability was significantly larger than in the core areas of SF and CM. These differences were observed for pleasant and unpleasant stimuli. Our findings reveal that the probabilistically defined anatomical subregions of the human amygdala show distinctive fMRI response patterns. The stronger auditory responses in LB as compared with SF and CM may reflect a predominance of auditory inputs to human LB, similar to many animal species in which the majority of sensory, including auditory, afferents project to this subdivision of the amygdala. Our study indicates that the intrinsic functional differentiation of the human amygdala may be probed using fMRI combined with probabilistic anatomical maps."
https://openalex.org/W2101275612,"Background Epidermal ionocytes play essential roles in the transepithelial transportation of ions, water, and acid-base balance in fish embryos before their branchial counterparts are fully functional. However, the mechanism controlling epidermal ionocyte specification and differentiation remains unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings In zebrafish, we demonstrated that Delta-Notch-mediated lateral inhibition plays a vital role in singling out epidermal ionocyte progenitors from epidermal stem cells. The entire epidermal ionocyte domain of genetic mutants and morphants, which failed to transmit the DeltaC-Notch1a/Notch3 signal from sending cells (epidermal ionocytes) to receiving cells (epidermal stem cells), differentiates into epidermal ionocytes. The low Notch activity in epidermal ionocyte progenitors is permissive for activating winged helix/forkhead box transcription factors of foxi3a and foxi3b. Through gain- and loss-of-function assays, we show that the foxi3a-foxi3b regulatory loop functions as a master regulator to mediate a dual role of specifying epidermal ionocyte progenitors as well as of subsequently promoting differentiation of Na+,K+-ATPase-rich cells and H+-ATPase-rich cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Conclusions/Significance This study provides a framework to show the molecular mechanism controlling epidermal ionocyte specification and differentiation in a low vertebrate for the first time. We propose that the positive regulatory loop between foxi3a and foxi3b not only drives early ionocyte differentiation but also prevents the complete blockage of ionocyte differentiation when the master regulator of foxi3 function is unilaterally compromised."
https://openalex.org/W2091955685,"Type III polyketide synthases (PKSs) are responsible for aromatic polyketide synthesis in plants and bacteria. Genome analysis of filamentous fungi has predicted the presence of fungal type III PKSs, although none have thus far been functionally characterized. In the genome of Neurospora crassa, a single open reading frame, NCU04801.1, annotated as a type III PKS was found. In this report, we demonstrate that NCU04801.1 is a novel type III PKS catalyzing the synthesis of pentaketide alkylresorcylic acids. NCU04801.1, hence named 2′-oxoalkylresorcylic acid synthase (ORAS), preferred stearoyl-CoA as a starter substrate and condensed four molecules of malonyl-CoA to give a pentaketide intermediate. For ORAS to yield pentaketide alkylresorcylic acids, aldol condensation and aromatization of the intermediate, which is still attached to the enzyme, are presumably followed by hydrolysis for release of the product as a resorcylic acid.

ORAS is the first type III PKS that synthesizes pentaketide resorcylic acids. Polyketides are synthesized by so-called polyketide synthases (PKSs) 2The abbreviations used are: PKS, polyketide synthase; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; LC, liquid chromatography; APCIMS, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry; ORAS, 2′-oxoalkylresorcylic acid synthase; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry. that fall into three groups, types I to III (1Shen B. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 285-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Ketosynthase, which is a pivotal domain for polyketide synthesis, catalyzes the sequential decarboxylative condensation of extender substrates by a process closely similar to fatty acid biosynthesis. In contrast to type I and II megasynthases composed of ketosynthases and accessory enzymes, type III PKSs are a dimer of ketosynthase that accomplishes a complex set of reactions, such as priming of a starter substrate, decarboxylative condensation of extender substrates, ring closure, and aromatization of the polyketide chain, in a multifunctional active site pocket (2Austin M.B. Noel J.P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). A growing number of type III PKSs catalyzing the synthesis of aromatic polyketides have been found from plants and bacteria, and their catalytic properties have been characterized. Chalcone synthases, the representative of type III PKSs in plants, catalyze the synthesis of naringenin chalcone, which is a common precursor of all flavonoids produced by plants (2Austin M.B. Noel J.P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). RppA, the first type III PKS found in bacteria, catalyzes the synthesis of 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene, which is a precursor of hexahydroxyperylenequinone melanin in a bacterium, Streptomyces griseus (3Funa N. Ohnishi Y. Fujii I. Shibuya M. Ebizuka Y. Horinouchi S. Nature. 1999; 400: 897-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Filamentous fungi produce a vast array of polyketides such as melanins, antibiotics, and mycotoxins (4Keller P.N. Turner G. Bennett J.W. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). The pathways and regulation of biosynthesis of the aromatic polyketides in filamentous fungi have been studied extensively for mycotoxins, including aflatoxin and fumonisin, produced by food spoilage fungi (5Sweeny M.J. Dobson A.D.V. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 175: 149-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and for melanogenesis associated with infection of plant-pathogenic fungi (6Langfelder K. Streibel M. Jahn B. Haase G. Brakhage A.A. Fungal Genet. Biol. 2003; 38: 143-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). In addition, the clinical benefit of lovastatin, a cholesterol-lowering agent, produced by Aspergillus terreus (7Tobert J.A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discovery. 2003; 2: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), promotes isolation of the biosynthetic genes for polyketides in fungi. Nevertheless, the enzyme systems for the synthesis of fungal polyketides have been confined to iterative type I PKSs, which are composed of a large multifunctional polypeptide containing discrete functional domains (1Shen B. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 285-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). This makes sense from an evolutionary point of view, because the iterative type I PKS system is structurally and mechanistically similar to the enzyme system of fatty acids synthesis in fungi and yeast (8Schweizer E. Hofmann J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 501-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). On the other hand, recent genome projects for Neurospora crassa (9Galagan J.E. Calvo S.E.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Type III PKSs share an evolutionary origin with the type II fatty acid synthases in plants and bacteria. N. crassa contains a single gene, NCU04801.1, which is thought to encode a type III PKS. In the present study, we characterized the gene product of NCU04801.1, which was found to actually encode a type III PKS. NCU04801.1 turned out to be a novel type III PKS that catalyzes 2′-oxoalkylresorcylic acid synthesis from a long-chain fatty acid CoA ester and four molecules of malonyl-CoA (Fig. 1). We hence named NCU04801.1 ORAS (2′-oxoalkylresorcylic acid synthase). This is the first report that describes the catalytic property of a fungal type III PKS and the synthesis of a pentaketide alkylresorcylic acid by type III PKSs in nature. Materials—Escherichia coli strains JM109 and BL21(DE3), plasmid pUC19, restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and TaqDNA polymerase were purchased from Takara Biochemicals (Shiga, Japan). pET26b was purchased from Novagen (San Diego, CA). An N. crassa conidial cDNA library and N. crassa strains FGSC 9717, 9718, 9719, and 9720 were purchased from the Fungal Genetic Stock Center, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City. [2-14C]Malonyl-CoA was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Nonlabeled CoA esters and 2-carboxymethyl-4,6-dimethoxy-benzoic acid were purchased from Sigma. Stearoyl chloride was purchased from Aldrich. Construction of pET26b-ORAS—Using the N. crassa conidial cDNA library prepared from the conidium stage as a template, a 1.3-kb DNA fragment containing the NCU04801.1-coding region was amplified by PCR with primer I (5′-GCGGAATTC-CATATGGCTGCTTCAACATTGTCCAA-3′, with an EcoRI site shown by underlining, an NdeI site shown by the italic letters, and the start codon of NCU04801.1 shown by the boldface letters) and primer II (5′-GCGAAGCTTATCCAGTTCAACATTGTCCAACG-3′, with a HindIII site shown by underlining). The amplified fragment was cloned between the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pUC19, resulting in pUC19-ORAS. The NdeI-HindIII fragment containing the NCU04801.1 sequence was excised from pUC19-ORAS and cloned between the NdeI and HindIII sites of pET26b, resulting in pET26b-ORAS. Production and Purification of Histidine-tagged ORAS—For production of histidine-tagged ORAS, E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pET26b-ORAS was grown overnight in Luria broth containing 100 μg/ml kanamycin. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 10% glycerol, and disrupted by sonication. A crude cell-lysate was prepared by removal of cell debris by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. ORAS was purified by using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid spin column (Qiagen) according to the manual from the manufacturer. The purified histidine-tagged protein was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 10% glycerol. PKS Assay—The standard reaction mixture contained 100 μm [2-14C]malonyl-CoA, 100 μm starter-CoA, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), and 3.9 μg of ORAS in a total volume of 100 μl. Reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min before being quenched with 20 μl of 6 m HCl. The products were extracted with ethyl acetate, and the organic layer was evaporated to dryness. The residual material was dissolved in 20 μl of methanol for thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (LC-APCIMS) analysis. Silica gel 60 WF254 TLC plates (Merck) were developed in benzene/acetone/acetic acid (85: 15:1, v/v/v) and the 14C-labeled compounds were detected by using a BAS-MS imaging plate (Fuji Film). LC-APCIMS analysis was carried out by using the esquire HCT system (Bruker Daltonics) equipped with a Pegasil-B C4 reversed-phase HPLC column (4.6 × 250 mm; Senshu Scientific, Tokyo). The compounds were eluted with a linear gradient of 70 to 100% CH3CN in water (each containing 0.1% acetic acid) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Triketide pyrones [2b]to[2i], tetraketide pyrones [3c]to[3f], and tetraketide resorcinols [5a] to [5f] were identified by comparing their LC-MS and MS/MS spectra with those obtained from the authentic standards that had been prepared by ArsB and ArsC, type III PKSs from Azo-tobacter vinelandii (12Funa N. Ozawa H. Hirata A. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6356-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For identification of a pentaketide resorcylic acid, 2,4-dihydroxy-6-(2′-oxononadecyl)-benzoic acid [6b] was converted to a stable methyl ether, 2,4-dimethoxy-6-(2′-oxononadecyl)-benzoic acid. The spectrometric data of the methyl ether was compared with those of the synthetic standard. 6b was methylated as follows. To a stirring acetone solution of 6b, which was prepared by ORAS in a 50-ml scale reaction, were added 100 mg of anhydrous K2CO3 and an excess amount of CH3I, and then the mixture was refluxed for 4 h. After K2CO3 had been filtered off, the mixture was evaporated, dissolved in ethyl acetate, and washed with 1 m HCl and brine. The organic phase was concentrated under vacuum to give a sample for LC-MS analysis. Extracted ion chromatograms and LC-MS/MS spectra are shown in Fig. 2. Spectral data are summarized in supplemental Table 1. Synthesis of 2,4-Dimethoxy-6-(2′-oxononadecyl)-benzoic Acid—2,4-Dimethoxy-6-(2′-oxononadecyl)-benzoic acid was synthesized as described by Saeed (13Saeed A. Helv. Chem. Acta. 2003; 86: 377-383Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A stirring mixture of 30 mg (0.125 mmol) of 2-carboxymethyl-4,6-dimethoxy-benzoic acid and 152 mg (0.501 mmol) of stearoyl chloride was heated in an oil bath at 200 °C for 4 h. Preparative TLC developed in hexane/ethyl acetate (5:1, v/v) gave 3-heptadecyl-6,8-dimethoxy-isochromen-1-one (6 mg, 11% yield) as a white solid: 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) δ 0.86 (t, J = 7.0 Hz, 3H, C17′H), 1.25 (m, 28H, methylene of C3′ to C16′), 1.65 (m, 2H, C2′H), 2.43 (t, J = 7.0 Hz, 2H, C1′H), 3.88 (s, 3H, CH3O-C6), 3.94 (s, 3H, CH3O-C8), 6.06 (s, 1H, C4H), 6.30 (d, J = 2.0 Hz, 1H, C5H), 6.40 (d, J = 2.0 Hz, 1H, C7H). To a solution of 4 mg (0.009 mmol) of 3-heptadecyl-6,8-dimethoxy-isochromen-1-one in 3 ml of ethanol was added 6 ml of 5% KOH solution, and the mixture was refluxed for 4 h. After the mixture had been cooled at ambient temperature, the ethanol was removed by evaporation. A small amount of water was added, and the mixture was acidified with diluted HCl and extracted with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate phase was washed with brine and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Sodium sulfate was removed by filtration, and the organic layer was evaporated under reduced pressure. Preparative TLC developed in hexane/ethyl acetate/acetic acid (50: 60:1, v/v/v) gave 2,4-dimethoxy-6-(2′-oxononadecyl)-benzoic acid (4 mg, 96% yield) as a white solid: 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) δ 0.86 (t, J = 7.0 Hz, 3H, C19′H), 1.26 (m, 30H, methylene of C4′ to C18′), 1.59 (m, 2H, C3′H), 2.32 (t, J = 7.5 Hz, 1H, C4H of tautomeric lactol form; see Fig. 2A), 2.59 (t, J = 7.5 Hz, 1H, C4H of lactol tautomeric form), 3.84 (s, 3H, CH3O-C2), 3.99 (s, 3H, CH3O-C4), 4.04 (s, 2H, C1′H), 6.39 (d, J = 2.0 Hz, 1H, C3H), 6.47 (d, J = 2.0 Hz, 1H, C5H). Determination of Kinetic Parameters of ORAS—The 100-μl scale reactions contained 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 100 μm [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (19,800 dpm), and 0.99, 0.51, or 0.25 μm ORAS for the hexanoyl-CoA-, lauroyl-CoA-, or stearoyl-CoA-primed reaction, respectively. The concentrations of starter-CoAs were varied between 3.0 to 15, 0.5 to 1.75, and 0.5 to 1.75 μm for hexanoyl-CoA, lauroyl-CoA, and stearoyl-CoA, respectively. After the reaction mixture had been preincubated at 30 °C for 4 min, the reactions were initiated by adding the substrates. The reactions were continued for 300, 60, or 45 s for hexanoyl-CoA, lauroyl-CoA, or stearoyl-CoA, respectively. The reactions were stopped with 20 μl of 6 m HCl, and the material in the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was evaporated and combined with nonlabeled carrier products for HPLC analysis. After separation by HPLC, the amounts of polyketides were quantified by means of [2-14C]malonyl-CoA incorporation. Steady-state parameters were determined by Lineweaver-Burk plots. Transcription of the ORAS Gene in N. crassa—In this study, we used the cDNA library prepared from the conidium stage of N. crassa for cloning the ORAS gene. We determined whether the ORAS gene was also transcribed during the mycelium and perithecium stages. Reverse transcription-PCR experiments, using the commercially available cDNA libraries prepared for the mycelium, conidium, and perithecium stages, all gave a distinct PCR product of the same length in almost the same amount (data not shown), indicating that the ORAS gene is expressed throughout growth. We also disrupted the ORAS gene on the chromosome of strains FGSC 9717, 9718, 9719, 9720, having a mutation in the KU genes (14Ninomiya Y. Suzuki K. Ishii C. Inoue H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12248-12253Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), by inserting a hygromycin B resistance gene into the ORAS-coding region. KU was originally identified as an autoantigen recognized by sera and later was found to be involved in nonhomologous recombination in eukaryotes (14Ninomiya Y. Suzuki K. Ishii C. Inoue H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12248-12253Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). True disruptants, which were checked by Southern hybridization, were obtained after repeated growth of hygromycin-resistant colonies on agar medium containing 500 μg/ml hygromycin B. These disruptants grew normally and differentiated to form conidia on several agar media (data not shown), which showed that ORAS mutations gave no apparent phenotypic changes. We could not determine the loss of the ability of the disruptants to produce alkylresorcylic acids and alkylresorcinols (the products of ORAS; see below), because the parental strains produced these polyketides in such a small amount that we failed to detect production by HPLC. Production of His-tagged ORAS in E. coli—The amino acid alignment of ORAS with plant and bacterial type III PKSs (supplemental Fig. 1) showed that the Cys-His-Asn catalytic triad, which is required for priming and extension of polyketides in type III PKSs (2Austin M.B. Noel J.P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2003; 20: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), was conserved in ORAS. We constructed an E. coli plasmid to prepare ORAS with a His tag at its C terminus and to determine its in vitro catalytic properties. The plasmid we constructed was pET26b-ORAS, which contained the ORAS gene under the control of the T7 promoter. This plasmid would direct the synthesis of Met-ORAS (Ala2-Asp445)-Lys-Leu-Ala3-Leu-Glu-His6. The histidine-tagged ORAS protein was purified by using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. The purified ORAS protein gave a single protein band at a position of ∼48 kDa on SDS-PAGE (data not shown). In Vitro Analysis of ORAS Reactions—We first checked whether ORAS accepts p-coumaroyl-CoA, a substrate of chalcone synthase, as a starter substrate by incubating ORAS in the presence of p-coumaroyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA as an extender substrate. No products were observed (Fig. 3), in agreement with the idea that filamentous fungi produce no flavonoid-related compounds. We then tested whether ORAS could accept CoA esters of C2 to C20 straight-chain fatty acids as a starter substrate, because the fatty acids and their intermediates are abundant primary metabolites in N. crassa (15Kushwaha S.C. Kates M. Kramer J.K.G. Subden R.E. Lipids. 1976; 11: 778-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and because ArsB, a type III PKS in A. vinelandii, produces alkylresorcinols by using long-chain fatty acid CoA esters as starters and malonyl-CoA as extenders (12Funa N. Ozawa H. Hirata A. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6356-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). [2-14C]Malonyl-CoA was used as an extender substrate to follow reaction products by TLC. As we expected, ORAS yielded 14C-labeled products for a broad range of CoA esters of C4-C20 fatty acids (Fig. 3). The products were identified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Their chemical structures, together with their biosynthesis routes, are illustrated in Fig. 1. ORAS gave triketide pyrones [2b]to[2i] from the C4 to C18 substrates, as revealed by radio-TLC (Fig. 3) and LC-APCIMS analysis (Supplementary Table 1). In addition, tetraketide resorcinols [5a]to [5f] were produced from the C10-C20 substrates and tetraketide pyrones [3c]to[3f] were also produced from the C10 to C16 substrates (Fig. 3). Interestingly, ORAS produced pentaketide resorcinols [7a]to[7c] from the C16-C20 substrates, pentaketide resorcylic acids [6a] and [6b] from the C18-C20 substrates, and tetraketide resorcylic acid [4a] from the C20 substrate [1a]. The structure of tetraketide resorcylic acid [4a] was deduced from the observed [M - H]- ion (supplemental Table 1). The structure deduction was supported by the observation that 4a was non-enzymatically converted to a tetraketide resorcinol [5a]. The chemical structures of pentaketide resorcylic acids were elucidated by a comparison of LC-MS/MS spectra between the methyl ether of 6b with the chemically synthesized authentic sample (Fig. 2) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We observed that ORAS produced the pentaketide resorcylic acid [6b] exclusively when the reaction period was shortened. The prolonged reaction resulted in a decrease of the pentaketide resorcylic acid [6b] with a concomitant increase of the pentaketide resorcinol [7b] (Fig. 4). Therefore we concluded that the resorcinols produced by the action of ORAS resulted from non-enzymatic decarboxylation of the corresponding resorcylic acids (see Discussion). Hence, ORAS is the first type III PKS that catalyzes the synthesis of a pentaketide resorcylic acid, 2′-oxoalkylresorcylic acid. Kinetic Analysis of ORAS—The product profile shown in Fig. 3 was not affected by pH change from 6 to 8. The pH optimum, as determined by measuring consumption of hexanoyl-CoA [1h], lauroyl-CoA [1e], and stearoyl-CoA [1b], was around pH 7. ORAS gave no products when the pH was lower than 5. We chose 1h, 1e, and 1b as representatives for measuring the steady state kinetic parameters of ORAS. The kcat/Km value for stearoyl-CoA [1b] consumption was the largest among these substrates (Table 1), indicating that ORAS prefers the CoA esters derived from long-chain fatty acids. In addition, the largest kcat/Km value in the polyketide formation was observed for the pentaketide resorcylic acid [6b] synthesis (Table 2). Considering the observation that the primary products of ORAS were resorcylic acids, we conclude that ORAS is a novel type III PKS that is responsible for the synthesis of 2′-oxoalkylresorcylic acid from long-chain starter substrates.TABLE 1Steady-state kinetic parameters of the starter-CoA consumption by ORASStarter substratesKmkcatkcat/Kmμm×10−3 s−1s−1 m−1Hexanoyl-CoA (1h)9.99 ± 1.30.643 ± 0.04364,767Lauroyl-CoA (1e)3.41 ± 0.614.12 ± 0.761,211,583Stearoyl-CoA (1b)21.7 ± 5.153.7 ± 7.72,507,705 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Steady-state kinetic parameters of the ORAS reactionsProductsKmkcatkcat/Kmμm×10−3 s−1s−1 m−14-Hydroxy-6-pentyl-2-pyrone (2h)aA product from hexanoyl-CoA-primed reaction.9.99 ± 1.30.643 ± 0.04364,7674-Hydroxy-6-undecyl-2-pyrone (2e)bProducts from lauroyl-CoA-primed reaction.3.35 ± 0.492.73 ± 0.29821,0214-Hydroxy-6-(2′-oxotridecyl)-2-pyrone (3e)bProducts from lauroyl-CoA-primed reaction.3.16 ± 0.820.563 ± 0.11180,8385-Undecylresorcinol (5e)bProducts from lauroyl-CoA-primed reaction.0.992 ± 0.180.343 ± 0.026356,9536-Heptadecyl-4-hydroxy-2-pyrone (2b)cProducts from stearoyl-CoA-primed reaction.0.573 ± 0.190.198 ± 0.041383,6772-Hyptadecylresorcinol (5b)cProducts from stearoyl-CoA-primed reaction.0.264 ± 0.0530.229 ± 0.011892,4712,4-Dihydroxy-6-(2′-oxononadecyl)-benzoic acid (6b)cProducts from stearoyl-CoA-primed reaction.24.1 ± 7.846.9 ± 151,947,621a A product from hexanoyl-CoA-primed reaction.b Products from lauroyl-CoA-primed reaction.c Products from stearoyl-CoA-primed reaction. Open table in a new tab The product profile of ORAS can be categorized into three groups: (i) triketide pyrone synthesis from C4,C6, and C8 starter units; (ii) triketide pyrone synthesis, accompanied by tetraketide resorcinol and tetraketide pyrone synthesis in small amounts, from C10,C12, and C14 starter units; and (iii) tetraketide and pentaketide resorcylic acid synthesis from C16,C18, and C20 starter units. It is evident that the incorporation of longer starter substrates leads to an increased extension time of the extender substrate. We assume that the increased extension time results from stable retention of the hydrophobic substrates in the active site of ORAS. Recently, a hydrophobic tunnel, which accounts for binding of long-chain aliphatic substrates, has been found in the structure of PKS18, a type III PKS responsible for pyrone synthesis from C12 to C20 starter units (16Sankaranarayanan R. Saxena P. Marathe U.B. Gokhale R.S. Shanmugam V.M. Rukmini R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 894-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A similar tunnel may also exist in ORAS, although ORAS differs from PKS18 in that it prefers stearoyl-CoA among hexanoyl-CoA, lauroyl-CoA, and stearoyl-CoA (Table 1), whereas PKS18 prefers lauroyl-CoA (17Saxena P. Yadav G. Mohanty D. Gokhale R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44780-44790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). ORAS is the first type III PKS that catalyzes the formation of pentaketide resorcylic acids, although there are many type III PKSs that produce tetraketide resorcinols, such as stilbene (18Austin M.B. Bowman M.E. Ferrer J-L. Schroöder J. Noel J.P. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 1179-1194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), stilbene carboxylic acid (19Eckermann C. Schroöder G. Eckermann S. Strack D. Schmidt J. Schneider B. Schroöder J. Phytochemistry. 2003; 62: 271-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and alkylresorcinol (12Funa N. Ozawa H. Hirata A. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6356-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Another unique feature of ORAS is the ability to synthesize resorcylic acids. This finding suggests a mechanistic difference between ORAS and ArsB, which shares 24% amino acid similarity with ORAS. Considering that ArsB produces alkylresorcinols exclusively (12Funa N. Ozawa H. Hirata A. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6356-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), we assume that ArsB synthesizes a resorcinol scaffold by decarboxylative aldol condensation (Fig. 5A). In contrast, in the ORAS reaction, aldol condensation and aromatization presumably take place before hydrolysis, resulting in producing the resorcylic acid scaffold (Fig. 5B). If the hydrolysis precedes aldol condensation, two cases for synthesis of the resorcinol scaffold are possible: one, decarboxylative aldol condensation (Fig. 5C), and the other, aldol condensation, which does not accompany decarboxylation (Fig. 5D). In the latter case, retention or detachment of the carboxylic acid depends on whether or not decarboxylation is concerted with aromatization (Fig. 5D). However, these are unlikely possibilities for the ORAS reaction, because these reactions would lead to the production of alkylresorcinol, which is not a direct product of ORAS. Although Neurospora is a model organism for studying the genetics, biochemistry, and molecular biology of filamentous fungi, no reports describing secondary metabolism in this genus have been published. It is not clear whether alkylresorcylic acids and alkylresorcinols in fungi play a role as membrane components as found for the cysts of A. vinelandii (12Funa N. Ozawa H. Hirata A. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6356-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) or are just secondary metabolites. 2′-Oxoalkylresorcinol is known to be a metabolite of a basidiomycete (20Filip P. Anke T. Sterner O. Z. Naturforsch. 2002; 57c: 1004-1008Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar), rice (21Suzuki Y. Esumi Y. Saito T. Kishimoto Y. Morita T. Koshino H. Uzawa J. Kono Y. Yamaguchi I.

Food Chem. 1992; 40: 1541-1546Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar), suggesting the occurrence of type III PKSs with ORAS activity in these organisms. It is also possible that ORAS-like enzymes are involved in the synthesis of some tetraketide alkylresorcinols in other fungi, such as Aspergillus (23Yang S-W. Chan T.-M. Terracciano J. Loebenberg D. Patel M. Gullo V. Chu M. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 2006; 59: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and Fusarium (24Zarnowski R. Lewicka T. Pietr S.J. Z.

CD indicated that the MeCP2 monomer was nearly 60% unstructured under conditions where it could preferentially recognize CpG dinucleotides and condense chromatin. Protease digestion experiments demonstrate that MeCP2 is composed of at least six structurally distinct domains, two of which correspond to the well characterized methyl DNA binding domain and transcriptional repression domain. These domains collectively are organized into a tertiary structure with coil-like hydrodynamic properties, reflecting the extensive disorder in the MeCP2 sequence. When expressed as individual fragments, the methyl DNA binding domain and transcriptional repression domain both could function as nonspecific DNA binding domains. The unusual structural features of MeCP2 provide a basis for understanding MeCP2 multifunctionality in vitro and in vivo.

Residues 78-162 are required to specifically recognize methylated CpG dinucleotides and have been termed the methyl DNA binding domain (MBD) (19Nan X. Meehan R.R. Bird A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4886-4892Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). The minimal sequence needed to repress transfected DNA has been called the transcriptional repression domain (TRD) and consists of residues 207-310 (20Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2804) Google Scholar). Despite the extensive interest in MeCP2 function, very little is known beyond the tertiary structure of the protein outside of the MBD, and even this domain is not well understood at the biochemical level. For example, fully one-half of the residues required to recognize a single methylated CpG are disordered in the NMR structure of the MBD (21Free A. Wakefield R.I. Smith B.O. Dryden D.T. Barlow P.N.

The HMGA family of high mobility group proteins are examples of intrinsically disordered proteins that mostly lack secondary and tertiary structure (35Reeves R.

The MeCP2 monomer has been reported to be asymmetric and yields an anomalous molecular mass when characterized by gel filtration and SDS-PAGE (36Klose R.J. Bird A.P. J. Biol.

To better understand MeCP2 tertiary structure and determine how MeCP2 structure and function may be influenced by intrinsic disorder, we have purified the recombinant human protein and characterized it by analytical ultracentrifugation, circular dichroism, and protease mapping. The location of order and disorder was predicted using the Fold-Index program. We find that the MeCP2 monomer is composed of at least six biochemically distinct domains, which are organized into a tertiary structure that is 60% unstructured and has coil-like hydrodynamic properties. When expressed as individual fragments, the MBD and TRD function as autonomous DNA binding domains in vitro. These results demonstrate that the MeCP2 tertiary structure is characteristic of an intrinsically disordered protein and provide a structural basis for understanding the multifunctionality of MeCP2 in vitro and in vivo. Expression and Purification of MeCP2—Recombinant human MeCP2 isoform e2 (486 residues) was purified as described (37Yusufzai T.M. Wolffe A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4172-4179Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), with the exceptions that the expression host BL21RP+ was used and the clarified supernatant was allowed to rock overnight in the presence of the chitin agarose. Purified proteins contained the vector-derived sequence, EFLEGSSC, linked to their C-terminal ends. Full-length MeCP2 and the TRD and MBD fragments were eluted with a 300-1000 mm NaCl step gradient (in 100 mm steps), dialyzed into storage buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 10 mm NaCl, 2 μm β-mercaptoethanol), and stored at 4 °C. Mass spectroscopy analysis (Bruker Ultraflex MALDI/TOF) was performed at the Colorado State University (CSU) Macromolecular Resources core facility. The full-length MeCP2/pTYB1 plasmid was used as the template for generating the MBD and TRD fragments. Primers were designed to amplify DNA fragments corresponding to amino acids 74-172 (MBD) MBD5′, 5′-GAC ATA TGG TGC CGG AAG CTT CTG CC; MBD3′, 5′-CAG AAT TCT TTC TGC TCT CG CCG GGA; 198-305 (TRD) TRD5′, 5′-GA CAT ATG CCC AAG GCG GCC ACG TCA GAG GGT; and TRD3′, 5′-CAG AAT TCG GGG AGT ACG GTC TCC TGC ACA TACGG ATAG. Polymerase chain reaction was used to generate the fragments. The corresponding products were digested with NdeI and EcoR1, gel-purified, and ligated into similarly digested and purified pTYB1 vector DNA. The pTYB1 clones were sequenced (CSU Core Facility) to confirm fidelity and continuity of the open reading frame, and successful clones were selected. DNA and Chromatin Binding Assays—The preparation of the DNA and nucleosomal arrays for electrophoretic mobility shift assay have been previously described (7Georgel P.T. Horowitz-Scherer R.A. Adkins N. Woodcock C.L. Wade P.A. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32181-32188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Methylated 198 DNA was generated by incubating 208-12 DNA in the presence of SssI and verified by digesting the DNA with the methylation-sensitive enzyme AvaI. The methylated DNA was then digested with EcoRI, which released two fragments: a 198-bp fragment that contains 10 methylated CG sites and a 10-bp fragment (all enzymes from New England Biolabs). The methylated 198 DNA fragment was purified using a PCR cleanup column (Qiagen) to remove the 10-bp fragments. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed with either a Beckman XL-I or a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge using the absorbance optical system as described (38Carruthers L.M. Schirf V.R. Demeler B. Hansen J.C. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 321: 66-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Boundaries were analyzed using the method of Demeler et al. (39Demeler B. Behlke J. Ristau O. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 321: 38-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Demeler B. van Holde K.E. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 335: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) using Ultrascan (version 7.3). This analysis yields an integral distribution of sedimentation coefficients, g(s). Sedimentation coefficients (s) were corrected to that in water at 20 °C (s20,w). The solvent densities (ρ) were calculated in Ultrascan. The partial specific volume of full-length MeCP2 (0.731 cm3/g at 20 °C) was calculated from the primary amino acid sequence within Ultrascan. Modeling of hydrodynamic parameters was performed within Ultrascan. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at 5 °C using charcoal-filled Epon 6-sector centerpieces. Scans were collected with the absorbance optical system at 229 and 280 nm by using an average of 20 scans collected at a radial step resolution of 0.001 cm. Overlays of successive scans taken 4 h apart at each speed confirmed that the samples had reached equilibrium. The equilibrium concentration gradients were edited and globally fitted within Ultrascan. The frictional ratio (f/fo) was calculated from the known molecular mass and measured sedimentation coefficient using Ultrascan. Circular Dichroism and Prediction Algorithms—CD spectroscopy was performed on a Jasco-720 spectropolarimeter at 20 °C. Proteins were dialyzed extensively against 10 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.9, 20 mm NaCl prior to obtaining measurements. A total of 15 spectra from full-length MeCP2 and the TRD and MBD fragments (all at 5 μm) were collected and averaged to obtain the final spectra. The spectra were baseline-subtracted versus the dialysis buffer. The molar ellipticity [Θ] was obtained by normalization of the measured ellipticity (Θ, millidegree), where [Θ] = (Θ × 100)/(nlc), n is the number of residues, c is the total concentration (mm), and l is the cell path length (cm). The percentages of secondary structure types were determined from the spectra using the CONTINLL, SELCON3, and CDSSTR methods within CDPro analytical software (41Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). The SDP48 basis set was used to deconvolute the CD spectrum. The full-length MeCP2 protein sequence (National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) accession number AAH11612) was analyzed by the following algorithms: DPM, DSC, GOR3, HNNC, MLRC, PHD, Predator, and SOPM) (42Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Delé;age G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). The results are reported as the mean ± standard deviation of the values returned by each algorithm. The FoldIndex program (43Prilusky J. Felder C.E. Zeev-Ben-Mordehai T. Rydberg E.H. Man O. Beckmann J.S. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2005; 21: 3435-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar) was accessed through the Bioinformatics & Biological Computing site. The window and step parameters were set at 6 and 2, respectively. Trypsin Digestion and N-terminal Sequencing—MeCP2 was dialyzed into 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, and 150 mm NaCl (digestion buffer). Trypsin (Roche Applied Science) was dissolved in 1 mm HCl, and serial dilutions were prepared (5.0-0.3125 μg/ml into digestion buffer). 10 μl of each trypsin dilution was incubated with 10 μl of MeCP2 (0.8 mg/ml) for 30 min on ice. The reactions were quenched with 5× SDS sample buffer, and the samples were boiled for 3 min and loaded onto a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel and electrophoresed. Protein bands were visualized by staining the gel with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Images were visualized by white light epi-illumination and digitized in a GelLogic 200 (Eastman Kodak Co.). For N-terminal sequencing, 8 μg of MeCP2 was digested with either 5 or 2.5 μg/ml trypsin as described. Following electrophoresis, the proteins were electroeluted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and visualized with RAPIDstain (Calbiochem). Protein bands 1-7 (see Fig. 3B) were excised and submitted to the CSU core facility for N-terminal sequencing (Applied Biosystems Procise Sequencer) and analyzed using Smooth Degree 3 software. Recombinant human MeCP2 isoform e2 was purified to greater than 95% homogeneity on the large scale (see Fig. 3B, lane 7) using the Intein system and heparin chromatography (37Yusufzai T.M. Wolffe A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4172-4179Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). MeCP2e2 subsequently will be referred to as MeCP2. MALDI/TOF-MS yielded a MeCP2 molecular mass of 53,541 Da, within 1% of the mass calculated from the amino acid sequence. To assay for methylated DNA binding, purified MeCP2 was bound to unmethylated 208-12 DNA, the complexes were incubated with identical amounts of methylated or unmethylated 198-1 DNA, and the products were analyzed on a native PAGE gel (8Nikitina T. Shi X. Ghosh R.P. Horowitz-Scherer R.A. Hansen J.C. Woodcock C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 27: 864-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The results indicated that purified MeCP2 preferentially bound to the methylated 198-1 DNA (Fig. 1, compare lanes 3-5 and 7-9). The pronounced shifts of the 208-12 competitor further demonstrated that MeCP2 also bound well to unmethylated DNA under the same conditions. The addition of increasing amounts of purified MeCP2 led to a progressive decrease in the mobility of nucleosomal arrays, as observed previously (supplemental Fig. 1) (7Georgel P.T. Horowitz-Scherer R.A. Adkins N. Woodcock C.L. Wade P.A. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32181-32188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 8Nikitina T. Shi X. Ghosh R.P. Horowitz-Scherer R.A. Hansen J.C. Woodcock C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 27: 864-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Together, these data show that the purified recombinant human MeCP2 characterized below was able to preferentially recognize methylated DNA, bind to unmethylated DNA, and condense unmethylated nucleosomal arrays into higher order secondary and tertiary chromatin structures. Hydrodynamic Properties and Oligomeric State—A wide range of sizes has been reported for MeCP2. For example, in the same study, an apparent molecular mass of ∼500 kDa was obtained from gel filtration and an apparent molecular mass of ∼57 kDa was estimated from sucrose density gradient centrifugation (36Klose R.J. Bird A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46490-46496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To rigorously assess the oligomeric state of MeCP2 over a large range of protein concentrations and in the presence and absence of salt, the purified protein was characterized by analytical ultracentrifugation. We initially performed sedimentation velocity experiments in low salt buffer covering a 10-fold protein concentration range. g(s) plots of the diffusion-corrected sedimentation coefficient distributions are shown in Fig. 2A. The vertical distributions indicate that MeCP2 sedimented as a single homogeneous 2.2 s species at all concentrations examined. The same result was obtained when the sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at 2.9 μm MeCP2, and the NaCl concentration was varied from 2 to 500 mm (Fig. 2B). The 2.2 s sedimentation coefficient observed in our studies is the same as that obtained using sucrose gradient centrifugation at a single MeCP2 and salt concentration (36Klose R.J. Bird A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46490-46496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Purified MeCP2 was next sedimented to equilibrium at six different protein loading concentrations (1.6-47 μm) and at three different rotor speeds. The buffer contained 50 mm NaCl. The subsequent concentration gradients obtained at equilibrium spanned approximately 3 orders of magnitude of protein concentrations, ranging from mid-nanomolar to high micromolar (Fig. 2C). 36 different scans were globally fit to a single, ideal species model. The residuals using this model were randomly distributed and showed no systematic deviations (Fig. 2D). A molecular mass of 54,970 Da was obtained from the sedimentation equilibrium analysis, within 3% of the mass calculated from the MeCP2 sequence. The frictional coefficient ratio, f/fo, calculated from the molecular mass and the 2.2 s sedimentation coefficient was 2.4. This large frictional coefficient ratio could result from either a rod-like structure with a high axial ratio or a coil-like structure such as that of a denatured protein (34McBryant S.J. Krause C. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15941-15948Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Together, the data in Fig. 2 demonstrate that MeCP2 is monomeric in the presence of 2-500 mm NaCl and over a nearly 1000-fold range in protein concentration and indicate that MeCP2 is not a well packed, globular protein. The MeCP2 Tertiary Structure Is Extensively Disordered—To better understand the tertiary structure of MeCP2, the purified protein was characterized by CD spectroscopy and protease digestion. The experimental results were then compared with FoldIndex disorder predictions (43Prilusky J. Felder C.E. Zeev-Ben-Mordehai T. Rydberg E.H. Man O. Beckmann J.S. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2005; 21: 3435-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). This same approach has been used to identify extensive disorder in the yeast SIR3p tertiary structure (34McBryant S.J. Krause C. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15941-15948Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The CD spectrum of purified MeCP2 in low ionic strength buffer is shown in Fig. 3A. The most prominent feature of the spectrum was a strong negative peak at 198 nm that arises from the disordered region(s) of a polypeptide chain (44Sreerama N. Venyaminov S.Y. Woody R.W. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). In contrast, the minimal negative shoulder at ∼225 nm indicated that only a small fraction of the polypeptide chain was in an α-helical conformation. The CD spectrum was deconvoluted using CDPro software (41Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar) and a 48-protein reference set that included denatured and/or unfolded proteins (see “Experimental Procedures”). This analysis yielded values of 4% α-helix, 21% β-sheet, 13% β-turn, and 59% unstructured. There are 90 consensus trypsin cleavage sites located throughout the 486-residue MeCP2 sequence (the mean and mode distance between consecutive sites is 5.4 and 3 residues, respectively, with a range of 36 residues). 3ExPASy PeptideCutter site. Thus, trypsin accessibility is a sensitive probe of global tertiary structure. Purified MeCP2 was digested with increasing amounts of trypsin, and the proteolytic products were visualized by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3B). Of note, the undigested 53-kDa protein yielded an apparent molecular mass of ∼75 kDa (Fig. 3B, lane 7) (36Klose R.J. Bird A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46490-46496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 37Yusufzai T.M. Wolffe A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4172-4179Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Digestion of MeCP2 under conditions where most of the protein remained intact produced at least 16 discrete bands, with apparent sizes ranging from ∼18-74 kDa (Fig. 3B, lanes 1-4). At a higher enzyme concentration, most of the high molecular weight bands were depleted, and three new major fragments appeared with apparent sizes of ∼10, 12, and 14 kDa (Fig. 3B, lane 5). At the highest trypsin concentration employed, prominent protease-resistant bands were observed at ∼10, 12, 14, 18, 19, and 20 kDa (termed bands 1-6; Fig. 3B, lane 6). We note that each of these trypsin-resistant bands contained 10-25 trypsin digestion sites that were not utilized. A Southwestern blot of a duplicate gel using a radiolabeled methylated DNA probe was used to identify bands with an intact MBD (8Nikitina T. Shi X. Ghosh R.P. Horowitz-Scherer R.A. Hansen J.C. Woodcock C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 27: 864-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 13Chandler S.P. Guschin D. Landsberger N. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7008-7018Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Of the trypsin-resistant fragments identified in Fig. 3B, only band 2 (∼19 kDa) and band 4 (∼14 kDa) could bind methylated DNA (Fig. 3C, compare lanes S and SW). The trypsin-resistant bands were excised from the gel and subjected to Edman sequencing. N-terminal sequences were obtained for bands 1-4 and band 6. The C-terminal ends of these bands could only be estimated from sizes returned by SDS-PAGE as we were unable to obtain masses from mass spectroscopy. These estimates took into account the anomalously high masses returned by SDS-PAGE. The results are described below and shown schematically in Fig. 3D. Band1(∼20 kDa apparent; 14 kDa actual) began with residue 355 and was presumed to extend to the C-terminal residue 486. Band 2 (∼19 kDa apparent; ∼18 kDa actual) began with residue 2 and bound methylated DNA, suggesting that it was composed of residues 2-162. Band 3 (∼18 kDa apparent; 14 kDa actual) began with residue 2 and did not bind methylated DNA. This suggests that it spanned residues 2-130/133/135 and was derived from band 2. Band 4 (14 kDa apparent) began with residue 85 and bound methylated DNA, suggesting that its C terminus was at residue 162, 177, or 186 (9, 10, or 11 kDa actual, respectively). Band 2 also may have been derived from band 4. Band 6 (10 kDa apparent; 9 kDa actual) began with residue 212, suggesting that it was composed of residues 212-293. We were unable to sequence band 5 despite repeated attempts but speculate that it may be a slightly larger version of band 6 based on the smearing between the two bands seen only in the SDS gel. During the course of these studies, we also isolated and sequenced the apparent ∼27-kDa fragment prominent throughout digestion (band 7) and found that it began with residue 310, suggesting that this band consisted of residues 310-486 (19 kDa actual) and was the direct precursor of band 1 (note that a minor MBD-containing fr"

Recently, we used a targeted metabolomics approach using mass spectrometry and NMR to identify changes in the metabolic profile of wild type and mutants in the flagellar glycosylation locus, characterize novel metabolites, and assign function to genes to define the pseudaminic acid biosynthetic pathway in Campylobacter jejuni 81-176 (McNally, D.

In this study, we use a similar approach to further define the glycome and metabolomic complement of nucleotide-activated sugars in Campylobacter coli VC167. Herein we demonstrate that, in addition to CMP-pseudaminic acid, C. coli VC167 also produces two structurally distinct nucleotide-activated nonulosonate sugars that were observed as negative ions at m/z 637 and m/z 651 (CMP-315 and CMP-329). Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry yielded suitable amounts of the pure sugar nucleotides for NMR spectroscopy using a cold probe. Structural analysis in conjunction with molecular modeling identified the sugar moieties as acetamidino and N-methylacetimidoyl derivatives of legionaminic acid (Leg5Am7Ac and Leg5AmNMe7Ac). Targeted metabolomic analyses of isogenic mutants established a role for the ptmA-F genes and defined two new ptm genes in this locus as legionaminic acid biosynthetic enzymes.

This is the first report of legionaminic acid in Campylobacter sp. and the first report of legionaminic acid derivatives as modifications on a protein. Campylobacter sp. are among the most frequent cause of bacterial diarrhea worldwide and the leading cause of food-borne illness in North America (1Blaser M.J. J. Infect.

All genes known to be involved in glycosylation of Campylobacter flagellins map near the flaA and flaB structural genes in a region that is one of the most hypervariable in the chromosome.

Mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy experiments showed definitively that the major sugars decorating flagellin from C. jejuni 81-176 were pseudaminic acid, 5,7-diacetamido-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-l-glycero-α-l-manno-nonulosonic acid (Pse5Ac7Ac), 3The abbreviations used are: Pse5Ac7Ac, 5,7-diacetamido-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-l-glycero-l-manno-nonulosonic acid (also known as pseudaminic acid); Pse5Ac7Am, 5-acetamido-7-acetamidino-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-l-glycero-l-manno-nonulosonic acid; CE, capillary electrophoresis; CE-ESMS, capillary electrophoresis electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry; HILIC-MS, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; HMBC, heteronuclear multiple bond correlation; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; Leg5Ac7Ac, 5,7-diacetamido-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-nonulosonic acid; Leg5Am7Ac, 5-acetamidino-7-acetamido-3,5,7,9,-tetradeoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-nonulosonic acid; Leg5AmNMe7Ac, 5-E/Z-N-(N-methylacetimidoyl)-7-acetamidino-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-d-glycero-d-galacto-nonulosonic acid; Neu5Ac, N-acetylneuraminic acid; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; TDP, thymidine diphosphate; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; UDP-QuiNAc4NAc, UDP-2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-α-d-glucopyranose. 5-acetamido-7-acetamidino-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-l-glycero-α-l-manno-nonulosonic acid (Pse5Ac7Am), and related derivatives (10Thibault P.

Genes in this pathway have also been characterized in C. coli VC167 (11Logan S.M. Kelly J.F. Thibault P. Ewing C.P. Guerry P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), although the pseA gene, which is involved in synthesis of Pse in C. jejuni 81-176, is a pseudogene in this strain. The structural characterization of flagellar modifications on C. coli VC167 has also been reported, and evidence was presented indicating that, although there were some groups conserved with C. jejuni 81-176, there were also differences in glycosyl modifications that could be distinguished serologically. In addition to Pse, C. coli VC167 appears to synthesize a structurally and serologically distinct acetamidino sugar having the same mass (315 Da) as the Pse5Ac7Am modification found on flagellin from C. jejuni 81-176 (11Logan S.M. Kelly J.F. Thibault P. Ewing C.P. Guerry P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Mutation of genes from the ptm locus in C. coli VC167 resulted in altered isoelectric focusing patterns of flagellin. Further, mass spectrometric analyses confirmed the loss of this 315-Da modification on the flagellin protein (11Logan S.M. Kelly J.F. Thibault P. Ewing C.P. Guerry P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) thus implicating the ptm genes in the production of this flagellar glycan. Although the ptm locus is present in most strains of C. jejuni (with the exception of 81-176), the precise reason for the serological specificity of this unique 315-Da modification and the precise function of each of the ptm genes has yet to be determined. The application of a novel CE-ESMS and precursor ion scanning method (21Soo E.C. Aubry A.J. Logan S.M. Guerry P. Kelly J.F. Young N.M. Thibault P. Anal.

McNally and coworkers (18McNally D.J. Hui J.P. Aubry A.J. Mui K.K. Guerry P. Brisson J.R. Logan S.M. Soo E.C. J. Biol.

CMP-Pse5Ac7Am was identified from the metabolome of wild-type C. jejuni 81-176. For the isogenic mutant pseC, UDP-2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-α-d-glucopyranose (UDP-QuiNAc4NAc), a derivative of bacillosamine, was identified revealing an unexpected cross-talk between the N-linked glycosylation pgl pathway and the O-linked flagellar glycosylation pse pathway in C. jejuni 81-176 (18McNally D.J. Hui J.P. Aubry A.J. Mui K.K. Guerry P. Brisson J.R. Logan S.M. Soo E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18489-18498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 20Schoenhofen I.C.

The success of using targeted metabolomics strategies to elucidate unknown gene functions and identify novel biosynthetic substrates prompted us to employ this strategy to investigate the ptm flagellin glycosylation locus using C. coli VC167 as a model strain. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—C. coli VC167 (23Harris L.A. Logan S.M. Guerry P. Trust T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5066-5071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has been described, and mutants of this strain are listed in Table 1. All Campylobacter strains were grown in Mueller-Hinton broth under microaerophilic conditions for 24 h at 37 °C. Media was supplemented with kanamycin (25 μg/ml) or chloramphenicol (10 μg/ml) when appropriate. For targeted metabolomic analysis of the parent strain C. coli VC167 and the isogenic mutants by CE-ESMS, cells from 500 ml of overnight culture were used. For purification of the intracellular sugar-nucleotide metabolites from C. coli VC167, cells from 10 liters of overnight culture of the parent strain were utilized.TABLE 1C. coli VC167 mutants used in this studyStrain no.Cj numberaRefers to the homolog in the genome of NCTC11168 (16).Gene namebGenes in the flagellin glycosylation locus of C. coli VC167 have been deposited at GenBank™ under accession number AY102621.

Open table in a new tab Mutant Construction—Mutants in C. coli VC167 alleles of Cj1319 and Cj1320 were generated by insertion of an aph3 cassette (24Labigne-Roussel A. Courcoux P. Tompkins L. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1704-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) into unique PstI and MluI sites within each gene, respectively. Mutation in ptmG and ptmH was done by transposition of a modified Tn5-transposon containing the Campylobacter cat gene as previously described (15Guerry P. Ewing C.P. Schirm M. Lorenzo M. Kelly J. Pattarini D. Majam G. Thibault P. Logan S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 299-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The insertion within ptmG occurred at bp 256 (in the 971-bp open reading frame) and that in ptmH at bp 520 of the 681-bp open reading frame. Mutation of the pglE gene was also done by Tn5 transposition. The insertion selected mapped to bp 27 within the pglE open reading frame. Plasmids from Escherichia coli were used to electroporate C. coli VC167 to either KmR or CmR. Transformants were screened by PCR using primers that mapped outside the insertion point of the antibiotic gene to confirm that the DNA had undergone a double crossover. Purification of Flagellin—Flagellin was purified as previously described (13Power M.E. Guerry P. McCubbin W.D. Kay C.M. Trust T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3303-3313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Top Down MS Analysis of Flagellin—Flagellin was dialyzed in H2O (0.2% formic acid) using a Centricon YM30 membrane filter. Flagellin was concentrated to 0.2 mg/ml and infused into a Waters Q-TOF mass spectrometer at a flow rate of 0.5 μl/min. Multiply protonated flagellin precursor ions were subjected to top down analysis according to Schirm et al. (28Schirm M. Schoenhofen I.C. Logan S.M. Waldron K.C. Thibault P. Anal. Chem. 2005; 77: 7774-7782Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Preparation of Cell Lysates—Cell lysates were obtained as described in earlier studies (21Soo E.C. Aubry A.J. Logan S.M.

Extraction of intracellular sugar-nucleotides from parent strain and isogenic mutants was achieved using Envi-Carb solid-phase extraction cartridges as described previously (18McNally D.J. Hui J.P.

Metabolomic Analysis by CE-ESMS—Cell lysates from parent strain C. coli VC167 and isogenic mutants ptmA-F were probed for intracellular sugar-nucleotides using a CE-ESMS and precursor ion scanning method as described earlier (21Soo E.C. Aubry A.J. Logan S.M. Guerry P. Kelly J.F. Young N.M. Thibault P. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The CE-MS instrumentation used in this study consisted of a CE system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) coupled to a 4000 QTRAP mass spectrometer equipped with a TurboV source via a coaxial sheath flow interface (AB/Sciex, Concord, Canada). HILIC-MS Purifications of Sugar-Nucleotide Metabolites—The CMP-activated precursors were isolated from cell lysates of parent strain C. coli VC167 by HILIC-MS as described in earlier work (18McNally D.J. Hui J.P. Aubry A.J. Mui K.K. Guerry P. Brisson J.R. Logan S.M. Soo E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18489-18498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The liquid chromatography-MS instrumentation consisted of a 1100 Series LC system (Agilent Technologies) coupled to a 4000 QTRAP mass spectrometer (AB/Sciex). A TSKgel Amide80 column (4.6- × 250-mm inner diameter, Tosoh Bioscience, Montgomeryville, PA) was employed for the HILIC separations, and the mobile phase was delivered to the column at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min and split 2:8 v/v post-column via a stainless steel tee to the 4000 QTRAP mass spectrometer during fraction collection of the intracellular sugar-nucleotide intermediates. Selective detection of the intracellular CMP-linked sugars was achieved using precursor ion scanning for fragment ions related to CMP (m/z 322). An average of 300 fractions of each of the purified intermediates was pooled to achieve sufficient material for the NMR analysis. NMR Spectroscopy of Sugar-Nucleotide Metabolites—Metabolites were lyophilized, resuspended in 200 μl of 99% D2O (Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories Inc., Andover, MD), and analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. To observe exchangeable NH protons, metabolite samples were suspended in 95% H2O (5% D2O), and the pH was lowered through the addition of diluted DCl to reduce the rate of proton exchange (pH 3.7). To remove CMP from compound II forming Leg5Am7Ac (III), an aliquot of II was treated overnight with diluted DCl at 70 °C (pH 1.3). All samples were analyzed in 3-mm NMR tubes. Standard homo- and heteronuclear correlated two-dimensional 1H NMR, 13C HSQC, HMBC, COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY pulse sequences from Varian (Palo Alto, CA) were used for general assignments. Selective one-dimensional TOCSY experiments with a Z-filter and one-dimensional NOESY experiments were used for complete residue assignments and measurement of proton coupling constants (JH,H) and NOEs (25Brisson J.R.

NMR in Microbiology: Theory and Applications. 2000: 165-210Google Scholar). NMR experiments were performed with a Varian 600 MHz (1H) spectrometer equipped with a Varian 5-mm Z-gradient triple resonance (1H, 13C, and 15N) cryogenically cooled probe (cold probe) and with a Varian Inova 500-MHz (1H) spectrometer with a Varian Z-gradient 3-mm triple resonance (1H, 13C, and 31P) probe. NMR experiments were typically performed at 25 °C with suppression of the HOD resonance at 4.78 ppm. For proton and carbon experiments, the methyl resonance of acetone was used as an internal reference (δH 2.225 ppm and δC 31.07 ppm). Molecular Dynamics Simulations for II and III—Molecular dynamics modeling was used to verify NOEs and to measure dihedral angles. Molecular models for II and III were constructed using the Biopolymer module of the Insight II Software package (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). All subsequent calculations were performed using the computation module running on a Sybyl 7.0 environment (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO), and atoms were assigned Tripos potentials and Gasteiger-Huckel charges. To avoid unfavorable atomic contacts, the systems were subjected to a 500-step energy minimization using a BFGS method. Molecular dynamics simulations were then performed in vacuum at 400 K for 1000 ps following a 100-ps equilibration. A Verlet algorithm with a 0.5-fs time step group-based non-bond method with a cutoff distance of 10 Aå and a distance-dependent dielectric value of 2 was used for simulations with trajectory frames being saved every 1 ps. Molecular Modeling of the N-Methylated Acetamidino Groups for IV and V—Molecular modeling was used to determine the lowest energy E and Z conformers for the N-methylated acetamidino groups in IV and V. Structures were optimized using the Austin Model 1 (AM1) Hamiltonian as implemented in Hyperchem 6.0 starting from idealized ring structures for cyclohexane. These optimized structures were then re-optimized using the Amsterdam Density Functional-Density Functional Theory-Quantum Mechanics (ADF-DFT-QM) program version 2005. Optimized structures were checked using frequency calculations (analytical second derivatives) for true convergence. Structures that exhibited negative frequencies were re-optimized using the coefficients of the negative modes to adjust the Cartesian coordinates. Optimization and frequency calculations were then repeated until all modes were positive. All structures were optimized as internal coordinates using the triple zeta plus basis set. Full solvation was considered using the ADF default continuum solvation model parameterized to water. Metabolomic Analysis of C. coli VC167 by CE-ESMS—Using CE-ESMS and precursor ion scanning, cell lysates from wild-type C. coli VC167 were found to contain an intracellular pool of CMP-linked sugars at m/z 638 and 637 that were indicative of CMP-nonulosonic acids as observed before (18McNally D.J. Hui J.P. Aubry A.J. Mui K.K. Guerry P. Brisson J.R. Logan S.M. Soo E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18489-18498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) (insets, Fig. 1A). However, in addition to these expected intermediates, the precursor ion-scanning experiments also revealed a novel intermediate as negative ions at m/z 651 that corresponds to a CMP-linked sugar of mass 329 Da. This mass is determined following subtraction of the mass of the CMP-carrier (i.e. m/z 651-322 (CMP + H2O) = 329). To investigate this metabolite further, a series of tandem mass spectrometry experiments was performed. The product ion scan (negative mode) of the parent ions revealed a fragment ion at m/z 322 that is characteristic of the CMP moiety (data not shown). In the positive mode, oxonium ions corresponding to CMP-329 were observed at m/z 653, and tandem mass spectrometry experiments gave rise to a product ion corresponding to the 329 Da carbohydrate moiety at m/z 330 (Fig. 1B). To obtain structural information on this carbohydrate moiety, MS3 experiments were performed on the novel CMP-sugar. The product ion spectrum (Fig. 1C) revealed losses of water that are typically observed with carbohydrates and an unusual fragment ion at m/z 258.1 that corresponded to the loss of 72.1 Da. Top Down MS Analysis of C. coli VC167 Flagellin—Earlier analysis by LC-ESMS and MS/MS of tryptic digests of C. coli VC167 flagellin (bottom up approach) revealed the presence of both 315- and 316-Da glycans on the flagellin protein (11Logan S.M. Kelly J.F. Thibault P. Ewing C.P. Guerry P. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These modifications correspond to the mass of the respective glycan moieties of the CMP-nonulosonic acids (m/z 637 and 638), which we found in the metabolome of C. coli VC167. In contrast, the 329-Da carbohydrate moiety was not observed as a modification of the flagellin protein in these initial bottom up studies. It is known that there are limitations to the use of a bottom up approach in the identification and characterization of post-translational modifications. For example, low stoichiometric abundance of a particular modification and intrinsic properties leading to poor ionization efficiency or instability during digestion and sample preparation may prevent the identification of novel glycan moieties. MS analysis of an intact protein (top down approach) is now often used in conjunction with the bottom up approach to provide a more complete analysis of a post-translationally modified protein. When this type of analysis was performed in the current study, the presence of a glycan moiety of mass 329 was clearly demonstrated on the flagellin protein. As can be seen in Fig. 2A, in addition to the expected modifications giving oxonium ions at 315 and 316 Da (m/z 316 and 317), an oxonium ion of m/z 330 was observed. This oxonium ion corresponds to the 329-Da glycosyl moiety that had been found to be CMP-activated (m/z 651) in the metabolome during CE-ESMS and precursor ion-scanning experiments. In addition, fragment ions at m/z 299 and 281, which result from neutral losses of water from m/z 317, were also observed in the mass spectrum. The MS/MS spectrum of the oxonium ion at m/z 330 from the flagellin protein (Fig. 2B) provided additional confirmation that this glycosyl moiety corresponds to the glycosyl moiety of the CMP-329 metabolite (Fig. 1C). HILIC-MS and NMR experiments were undertaken to fully characterize this unknown carbohydrate, suspected to be related to a nonulosonic acid.

https://openalex.org/W2100769394,"GSH is released in cells undergoing apoptosis, and the present study indicates that the multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs/ABCC) are responsible for this GSH release. Jurkat cells released ∼75-80% of their total intracellular GSH during both Fas antibody- and staurosporine-induced apoptosis. In contrast, Raji cells, a lymphocyte cell line that is deficient in phosphatidylserine externalization, did not release GSH during apoptosis, and other apoptotic features appeared more slowly in these cells. Jurkat and Raji cell lines expressed comparable MRP and OATP/SLCO (organic anion-transporting polypeptide) mRNA levels, and MRP1 protein levels; however, differences existed in MRP1 localization and function. In Jurkat cells, MRP1 was largely localized to the plasma membrane, and these cells exported the MRP substrate calcein. Calcein release was enhanced during apoptosis. In contrast, Raji cells had little MRP1 at the plasma membrane and did not export calcein under basal or apoptotic conditions, indicating that these cells lack functional MRPs at the plasma membrane. GSH release in Jurkat cells undergoing apoptosis was inhibited by the organic anion transport inhibitors MK571, sulfinpyrazone, and probenecid, supporting a role for the MRP transporters in this process. Furthermore, when MRP1 expression was decreased with RNA interference, GSH release was lower under both basal and apoptotic conditions, providing direct evidence that MRP1 is involved in GSH export.

Cells stimulated to undergo apoptosis release GSH into the extracellular space, but the precise mechanisms behind the GSH export and its significance to the apoptotic process are not understood (1Hammond C.L. Lee T.K. Ballatori N. J. Hepatol. 2001; 34: 946-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Because GSH regulates many cellular functions, depletion of intracellular GSH can disrupt these processes. Although apoptotic GSH release may be a simple consequence of cell death, there is increasing evidence that it is required for either activation of specific apoptotic signaling pathways or for proper dismantling of cellular components (1Hammond C.L. Lee T.K. Ballatori N. J. Hepatol. 2001; 34: 946-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 2Coppola S. Ghibelli L. Biochem. Soc.

For example, the decrease in GSH may lead to an increase in reactive oxygen species, which could function as second messengers, or may accelerate mitochondrial damage and apoptosis. Intracellular GSH levels are controlled in two major ways: by regulating its rate of synthesis inside the cell and its rate of transport out of the cell (3Ballatori N. Hammond C.L. Cunningham J.B. Krance S.M. Marchan R. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2005; 204: 238-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). GSH depletion during apoptosis has been reported to occur concomitantly with an increase in extracellular GSH, indicating that GSH is exported (4Ghibelli L. Coppola S. Rotilio G. Lafavia E.

GSH release is probably mediated by transport proteins, because it is detected before plasma membrane integrity is lost (5Ghibelli L. Fanelli C. Rotilio G. Lafavia E. Coppola S. Colussi C.

Lafavia E. Coppola S. Colussi C. Civitareale P. Ciriolo M.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Although GSH release is important for maintaining both basal and apoptotic intracellular GSH levels, the mechanisms responsible for GSH transport out of the cell are not well characterized (3Ballatori N. Hammond C.L. Cunningham J.B. Krance S.M. Marchan R. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2005; 204: 238-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). A recent study suggests that the OATP (organic anion-transporting polypeptide)/SLCO) family of proteins is responsible for apoptotic GSH release (9Franco R. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29542-29557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar); however, only indirect evidence was provided for this conclusion. Under basal conditions, GSH is thought to be released from cells largely via the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP/ABCC) family of proteins (3Ballatori N. Hammond C.L. Cunningham J.B. Krance S.M. Marchan R. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2005; 204: 238-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), although the OATPs may also contribute (3Ballatori N. Hammond C.L. Cunningham J.B. Krance S.M. Marchan R. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2005; 204: 238-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 10Li L. Lee T.K. Meier P.J. Ballatori N. J. Biol.

San Marin J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30326-30335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Several members of the MRP family have been shown to mediate GSH transport, including MRP1, MRP2, MRP4, MRP5, and CFTR (3Ballatori N. Hammond C.L. Cunningham J.B. Krance S.M. Marchan R. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2005; 204: 238-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). For the OATPs, rat Oatp1 is thought to release GSH through an exchange mechanism with an organic anion (10Li L. Lee T.K. Meier P.J. Ballatori N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16184-16191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), and human OATP8 (OATP1B3) has been implicated in the cotransport of GSH and bile acids (11Briz O. Romero M.R. Martinez-Becerra P. Macias R.I. Perez M.J. Jimenez F. Martin F. G. San Marin J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30326-30335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). OATP8 is the only human OATP implicated in GSH transport thus far. The present findings indicate that the MRPs, and not the OATPs, are responsible for the GSH export that is observed in cells undergoing apoptosis. Materials—Fas antibody clone CH-11 was purchased from MBL International Corp. (Woburn, MA), and MK571 was purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Fluorescent caspase 3 substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC (7-amido-4-methylcoumarin) was from Calbiochem, Annexin V-APC was from BD Pharmingen (San Jose, CA), and calcein-AM and FM®1-43FX were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). All other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture—Jurkat and Raji cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA). Both cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 with l-glutamine (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 μg/ml gentamycin (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 atmosphere. Experiments were run with 4 × 106 cells/ml in Krebs-Henseleit (KH) 3The abbreviations used are: KH, Krebs-Henseleit; TBST, Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20; siRNA, small interfering RNA; Ab, antibody. buffer (118 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 0.6 mm MgSO4, 1.25 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.5) containing 0.5 mm acivicin, an inhibitor of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase activity. GSH Release—Jurkat and Raji cells were treated with an apoptotic inducer after a 20-min preincubation period at 37 °C in KH buffer plus 0.5 mm acivicin. KH buffer was collected to analyze extracellular GSH, and cell lysate was analyzed for intracellular GSH using an enzymatic assay containing 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and glutathione reductase (12Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). Protein analysis was performed using the Lowry protein assay (13Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GSH release is expressed as the percentage of total GSH (extracellular and intracellular) present in the media. Phosphatidylserine Externalization—After treatment, Jurkat and Raji cells were stained with Annexin V-APC and propidium iodide in KH buffer containing 2.5 mm CaCl2. Cells were analyzed for propidium iodide exclusion and increases in Annexin V-APC staining using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer at the University of Rochester Flow Cytometry Core. Data were analyzed using Cell Quest software, gating out propidium iodide-positive cells and including Annexin V-positive cells for phosphatidylserine externalization. Plasma Membrane Integrity—Plasma membrane integrity was measured by propidium iodide exclusion and by lactate dehydrogenase release. Propidium iodide exclusion was measured by flow cytometry. Lactate dehydrogenase release was measured as described by Vassault (14Vassault A. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 1983; (Bergmeyer, H. V., ed), Verlag Chemie, Deerfield Beach, FL: 118-126Google Scholar), and the results are expressed as a percentage of total lactate dehydrogenase activity (lysed untreated cells). Caspase 3-like Activity—The caspase 3-like activity assay was based on one provided by BD PharMingen. Briefly, cells were placed in cell lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4/NaHPO4, pH 7.5, 130 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate) and frozen at -80 °C until activity assay. Cell lysates were combined with 1× HEPES buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) and 30 μm Ac-DEVD-AMC. Caspase 3-like activity was measured using a SPECRTAmax Gemini XS spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) at 37 °C. DNA Fragmentation—Jurkat and Raji cells were analyzed for a sub-G1 population, which corresponds to cells with fragmented DNA using a protocol described by Nicoletti et al. (15Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4431) Google Scholar). The protocol was altered slightly, substituting KH buffer for phosphate-buffered saline in the propidium iodide solution. Flow cytometry was performed on an Epics Elite ESP (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL) cytometer and analyzed with EPICS Cyto-Logic software (Beckman Coulter) at the University of Rochester Flow Cytometry Core. Truncated Bid Protein Expression Analysis—Whole cell lysates were prepared as previously described (16Grant C.E. Valdimarsson G. Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 357-361PubMed Google Scholar, 17Almquist K.C. Loe D.W. Hipfner D.R. Mackie J.E. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 102-110PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were resuspended in Western blot lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 μg/ml EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture at 5 × 107 cells/ml at 4 °C for 10 min and then homogenized. Sucrose was added to a final concentration of 250 mm, and lysate was centrifuged at 800 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. Proteins were detected using 1:1000 primary antibody for Bid (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) overnight at 4 °C and secondary antibody (1:3000) for 1 h at room temperature. Images were detected using a Kodak Digital Science Image Station 440 (Eastman Kodak Co.). MRP1 Protein Expression Analysis—Membrane-enriched fractions were prepared as previously described (16Grant C.E. Valdimarsson G. Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 357-361PubMed Google Scholar, 17Almquist K.C. Loe D.W. Hipfner D.R. Mackie J.E. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 102-110PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, whole cell lysate was prepared as above and was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 125 mm sucrose, 200 μg/ml EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture. MRPr1 (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA) primary antibody was diluted to 1:300, and the secondary antibody was diluted to 1:15,000. mRNA Expression—Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit and the RNase-Free DNase set (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Oligonucleotide primers were designed for portions of the MRP and OATP families of genes as well as for β-actin using Primer Express 1.5 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and published sequences from GenBank™ (Table 1). One primer set was designed that identifies both OATP-C and OATP8, because they are very similar in sequence. Reactions were conducted and analyzed on a Roto-Gene 3000 real time light cycler (Corbett Research, Phenix Corp., Hayward, CA). PCR analysis was performed on 10-100 ng of RNA using the Quantitect Sybr Green quantitative reverse transcription-PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).TABLE 1Primer sequences and annealing temperatures (Ta) for real time reverse transcription-PCRProteinGeneGenBank™ accession numberForward primer (5′–3′)Reverse primer (5′–3′)TaAmplicon sizebpMRP1ABCC1NM 004996AGGTCAAGCTTTCCGTGTACTGGGACTTTCGTGTGCTCCTGA57174MRP2ABCC2NM 000392CTGCGGTGGATCTAGAGACAGATGCCGCACTCTATAATCTTCCC58156MRP3ABCC3AF085690GGCTGCAGGGCGTACAGTCTGCCAAGATGAGGGCAGAGAGTA61184MRP4ABCC4AY081219TTTGTGACCTTCACCACCTACGTGGTTGCGCTGTGATATCTCATCAAGT62201MRP5ABCC5NM 005688AGTTCTGTTTGTTACCCACCAGTTACCCTTGTCTTGTGACTTCTTCTGT57226MRP6ABCC6NM 001171GCTCTATCCTCAGGAACTCGAAGACGCTTTCTCTGCATTCATAGCATTCT60226MRP7ABCC10NM 033450GATTCTGCCACTGGTACAAGCTGTCAGTAAGCTTGGTACACGTGCAAG61201MRP8ABCC11NM 032583GCCAAAGGTAGAAAGTCAGGCTCTGAAGATCGTTAAGAAGACGATCA58216MRP9ABCC12NM 145187AGCAGGAAAAGTACCCCAAAGAGCTGTGCAGAACCGATTTGA57.8153CFTRABCC7NM 000492CTACTCTCCTTCGCCACATTTTCTGGCTCAGAGAGGCCTTCTC58188OATP-ASLCO1A2NM 021094.2CTGTGCGACAAAGGACCTGACTGTTATCCAGGTATGGCAGCCAAAGAA59101OATP-BSLCO2B1NM 007256.2CCTTTGCTTGCTAGTCTGAACAGGTATACTTCTTTCCACCCAG59144OATP-CSLCO1B1NM 006446.2GAAAAGGTTGTTTAAAGGAATCTGGCGAAATCATCAATGTAAGAAAGCC55123OATP-DSLCO3A1NM 013272.2GCGGTCTTCATTGACACAAGGAAGAGAAGAAGAGTAAGGCACC54110OATP-ESLCO4A1NM 016354.3GCCATAGCCTGCTTCTTATACAAGCTGGCTATCTGTGGCACTGTCAG59104OATP-FSLCO1C1NM 017435.2GAACAATGGTGTCTACAAGATTCCAGTTTCTAAAGTTGAGTTTCCTTGCC57102OATP-HSLCO4C1NM 180991.4GATGAAACTGCTCCACCTCAGACCTCCACCTCTTGTTAGATCAGTAGTG59147OATP-ISLCO6A1NM 173488.2GGAGCCAGGATGAAGTCTCAAGAACCTTATCAAGGCCTCTGGAAG55155OATP-JSLCO5A1NM 03958.1TCATGCTCCCCTACGGTACAGGCTCACCTTTGTTTGGAGTGTTAG59102OATP8SLCO1B3NM 019844.1GAAAAGGTTGTTTAAAGGAATCTGGCGAAATCATCAATGTAAGAAAGCC55123PGTSLCO2A1NM 05630.1CCGTATTCCGAGGAGTAGAGAGGGTATGAGCATGTCTGAAACCAG57152ActinNM 031144CCGTGAAAAGATGACCCAGATCGGTACGACCAGAGGCATACAGG55100 Open table in a new tab Immunofluorescence Detection of MRP1—Cells were fixed and stained using the Fix and Perm® cell permeabilization kit (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). After washing with phosphate-buffered saline plus 5% goat serum, cells were incubated with 1.25 μg/ml MRPr1 (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA), 1.25 μg/ml rat IgG2a (Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA) in Reagent B of the Fix and Perm Kit or phosphate-buffered saline plus 5% goat serum for 30 min at room temperature in a humidified chamber. Rat IgG2a and phosphate-buffered saline plus 5% goat serum were used as negative controls. Cells were then labeled with a 1:1000 dilution of anti rat IgG Alexa Fluor 647 (Molecular Probes) in Reagent B for 30 min at room temperature in a humidified chamber. After washing, 10 nm SYTOX green nucleic acid stain (Molecular Probes) was added for 10 min. Cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde and mounted with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). Confocal Laser-scanning Microscopy—Images were taken with a Leica TCS SP Spectral Confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Exton, PA) incorporating an upright DMRE Leica microscope at the University of Rochester Pathology/Morphology Imaging Core. Images were scanned simultaneously with a 488-nm argon laser and a 633-nm helium-neon laser. MRP Transport Activity—Cells were incubated with 1 μm calcein-AM at 37 °C for 30 min, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in KH buffer plus 0.5 mm acivicin. Apoptotic inducers were added, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. Samples were analyzed on a SPECRTAmax Gemini XS spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices) at 37 °C, excitation 485 nm; emission 530 nm. Cells without calcein were measured to detect background fluorescence. Protein was analyzed using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). The calcein release data were expressed as average fluorescence/mg of protein and then converted to percentage of calcein released (supernatant) from total calcein made by cells (supernatant + cell lysate calcein). RNA Interference Knockdown of MRP1 in Jurkat Cells—Double-stranded siRNAs specific to MRP1 were designed by Dharmacon Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The targeting sequences were as follows: sense, 5′-GAUGACACCUCUCAACAAAUU; antisense, 5′-PUUUGUUGAGAGGUGUCAUCUU (catalog number MU-007308-00-0020). siCONTROL nontargeting siRNA (Dharmacon) was used as a negative control. Jurkat cells were transfected as described by Ku et al. (18Ku G.M. Yablonski D. Manser E. Lim L. Weiss A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 107 cells were resuspended in 400 μl of culture medium and electroporated with 100 nm siRNA and 10 μg of pmaxGFP (Amaxa Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) at 250 V and 950 microfarads using the GenePulsar Xcell Electroporation System (Bio-Rad). After electroporation, cells were incubated for 24 h in 200 ml of culture medium. As controls, cells were electroporated without RNA or were not electroporated. After 24 h, the cells were resuspended in cold KH buffer and sorted for green fluorescent protein-positive cells at the University of Rochester Flow Cytometry Core using a FACSVantage SE (BD Biosciences). GSH release experiments and total intracellular and extracellular GSH levels were assayed as described above. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using Statview 5. Data were analyzed using one-factor analysis of variances and Fisher’s PLSD (protected least significant difference) post hoc or unpaired t tests where appropriate. In all cases, p values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. GSH Release Is a Feature Observed in Both Intrinsic and Extrinsic Apoptosis—Jurkat cells treated with Fas antibody released a large amount of intracellular GSH into the media (Fig. 1A), confirming the findings of van den Dobblesteen et al. (8van den Dobbelsteen D.J. Nobel C.S. Schlegel J. Cotgreave I.A. Orrenius S. Slater A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15420-15427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). There was a concurrent decline of intracellular GSH (data not shown). Apoptosis was indicated by an increase in phosphatidylserine externalization (Fig. 1C), caspase 3 activity (Fig. 1E), DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1G), and Bid truncation (Fig. 1I). Lactate dehydrogenase was not released after Fas antibody treatment (data not shown), indicating that the release of GSH was not due to cell lysis. Another lymphocyte cell line, the Raji cells, was tested for GSH release during apoptosis in order to examine if this transport process is associated with phosphatidylserine externalization, since Raji cells are deficient in this process (19Fadeel B. Gleiss B. Hogstrand K. Chandra J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Henter J.I. Orrenius S. Samali A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 20Tepper A.D.

Schroit A.J. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2004; 6: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Raji cells did not externalize phosphatidylserine after Fas antibody exposure (Fig. 1D), confirming previous findings (19Fadeel B. Gleiss B. Hogstrand K. Chandra J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Henter J.I. Orrenius S. Samali A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 504-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar); however, they exhibited features of apoptosis as indicated by increases in caspase 3 activity (Fig. 1F) and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1H) and the presence of tBid (Fig. 1J). The increase in apoptotic markers was higher in Jurkat cells, and caspase activity appeared more quickly in the Jurkat cells than in the Raji cells (Fig. 1). Both the Raji and Jurkat cells had ∼40 ng of intracellular GSH/mg of protein; however, GSH was not released in Raji cells treated with Fas antibody (Fig. 1B). In addition, GSH was not released even after 6 h of treatment or when 500 ng/ml Fas antibody was used (data not shown). Inducing apoptosis chemically with staurosporine also resulted in GSH release in Jurkat cells but not in the Raji cells (Fig. 2). Raji cells also failed to externalize phosphatidylserine after treatment with staurosporine (Fig. 2D). Staurosporine elicited other features of apoptosis in the Raji cells, including enhanced caspase activity (Fig. 2F) and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2H), and truncation of Bid (Fig. 2J). Similarly to Fas antibody treatment, staurosporine led to a higher apoptotic marker expression level in the Jurkat cells when compared with the Raji cells (Fig. 2). Jurkat and Raji Cells Express Comparable Levels of MRPs and OATPs—MRP1, MRP2, MRP4, and MRP5, putative GSH transporters, were expressed at comparable levels in Raji and Jurkat cells (Figs. 3, A and B). MRP2 expression was low in both cell lines, and this was expected, because MRP2 is not often present in nonpolarized cells. MRP1 was the most abundant member of this gene family in both cell lines. Western blotting revealed that MRP1 protein was expressed at similar levels in Jurkat and Raji cells (Fig. 3E), consistent with the mRNA data. Jurkat and Raji cells also expressed similar levels of OATP mRNA, except for OATP-D, which was higher in the Raji cells. Neither the Jurkat nor the Raji cells expressed OATP8 (Fig. 3, C and D), the only human OATP suggested to transport GSH thus far (11Briz O. Romero M.R. Martinez-Becerra P. Macias R.I. Perez M.J. Jimenez F. Martin F. G. San Marin J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30326-30335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). MRP1 Is Not Localized to the Plasma Membrane, and MRP-associated Transport Activity Is Not Observed in Raji Cells— MRP transporters are generally located either at the plasma membrane or in intracellular vesicles (23Gennuso F. Fernetti C. Tirolo C. Testa N. L'Episcopo F. Caniglia S. Morale M.C. Ostrow J.D. Pascolo L. Tiribelli C. Marchetti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pfannschmidt M. Klar E. Hofmann W.J. Keppler D. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 94: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These vesicles may regulate transport activity through trafficking to and from the plasma membrane (23Gennuso F. Fernetti C. Tirolo C. Testa N. L'Episcopo F. Caniglia S. Morale M.C. Ostrow J.D. Pascolo L. Tiribelli C. Marchetti B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2470-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To examine MRP1 subcellular localization in Jurkat and Raji cells, these cells were stained with MRP1 antibody and visualized using confocal laser-scanning microscopy. In the Jurkat cells, plasma membrane MRP1 staining was observed (Fig. 4, B-D), whereas MRP1 staining was largely intracellular in the Raji cells (Fig. 4, F-H). Note that both Jurkat and Raji cells have large nuclei and very little cytoplasm (Fig. 4, A and E). FM®1-43FX, a marker for the plasma membrane, confirmed that the MRP1 staining was on the plasma membrane in Jurkat cells and that MRP1 was not on the plasma membrane in Raji cells (data not shown). To examine whether differences in MRP transport activity between the Jurkat and Raji cells may explain the lack of GSH export in the Raji cells, the export of the MRP substrate calcein was measured in both cell lines. Calcein-AM freely diffuses into cells and is cleaved by nonspecific esterases to form the fluorescent product calcein. Calcein is a substrate for MRP transporters, and the overexpression of MRP proteins has been shown to deplete cells of calcein (26Feller N. Broxterman H.J. Wahrer D.C. Pinedo H.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 27Versantvoort C.H. Bagrij T. Wright K.A. Twentyman P.R. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 63: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Untreated Jurkat cells released ∼25% of the calcein over 3 h (Fig. 5, A and C), suggesting that these cells have functional MRP proteins. Adding Fas antibody (Fig. 5A) or staurosporine (Fig. 5C) increased the amount of calcein released by Jurkat cells. This increase in calcein release follows a similar time course as the increase in GSH release due to either apoptotic inducer (Figs. 1A and 2A). Probenecid inhibited both the basal calcein release and that induced by Fas antibody (Fig. 5A) or staurosporine (Fig. 5C). MK571 also inhibited both basal and Fas antibody-stimulated calcein export (data not shown). In contrast to the Jurkat cells, Raji cells loaded with calcein failed to release this compound over 3 h, and treatment with Fas antibody or staurosporine did not stimulate calcein release (Fig. 5, B and D). Note that both Jurkat and Raji cells had similar levels of total calcein fluorescence (Fig. 5, E and F), indicating that the lack of calcein export in Raji cells was not due to insufficient loading.

https://openalex.org/W2051409222,"Wild-type p53 is a conformationally labile protein that undergoes nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling. MDM2-mediated ubiquitination promotes p53 nuclear export by exposing or activating a nuclear export signal (NES) in the C terminus of p53. We observed that cancer-derived p53s with a mutant (primary antibody 1620-/pAb240+) conformation localized in the cytoplasm to a greater extent and displayed increased susceptibility to ubiquitination than p53s with a more wild-type (primary antibody 1620+/pAb240-) conformation. The cytoplasmic localization of mutant p53s required the C-terminal NES and an intact ubiquitination pathway. Mutant p53 ubiquitination occurred at lysines in both the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and C terminus. Interestingly, Lys to Arg mutations that inhibited ubiquitination restored nuclear localization to mutant p53 but had no apparent effect on p53 conformation. Further studies revealed that wild-type p53, like mutant p53, is ubiquitinated by MDM2 in both the DBD and C terminus and that ubiquitination in both regions contributes to its nuclear export. MDM2 binding can induce a conformational change in wild-type p53, but this conformational change is insufficient to promote p53 nuclear export in the absence of MDM2 ubiquitination activity. Taken together, these results support a stepwise model for mutant and wild-type p53 nuclear export. In this model, the conformational change induced by either the cancer-derived mutation or MDM2 binding precedes p53 ubiquitination. The addition of ubiquitin to DBD and C-terminal lysines then promotes nuclear export via the C-terminal NES.

The tumor suppressor protein p53 is inactivated in the vast majority of human cancers, either through mutation, cytoplasmic sequestration, interaction with viral oncoproteins, or increased interactions with its negative regulator, MDM2 (1Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2694) Google Scholar). It is therefore important to determine how p53 is normally regulated and how this regulation is altered in cancer. Wild-type p53 is a short lived protein and is expressed at low levels in most normal cells (2Maki C.G. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 3Maltzman W. Czyzyk L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that can bind p53 and promote its rapid ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (4Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3659) Google Scholar, 5Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2814) Google Scholar). Importantly, MDM2 is the product of a p53-inducible gene, thus establishing a negative feedback loop in which p53 increases expression of its own inhibitor (6Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2776) Google Scholar, 7Oliner J.D. Kinzler K.W. Meltzer P.S. George D.L. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1992; 358: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). The importance of MDM2 in regulating p53 has been revealed through genetic studies in which embryonic lethality in MDM2 knockout mice is rescued by simultaneous knock-out of p53 (8Montes de Oca Luna R. Wagner D.S. Lozano G. Nature. 1995; 378: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). Recently, other ubiquitin-protein ligases have been identified that can also bind p53 and promote its degradation, including Pirh2, Cop1, and Chip (9Dornan D. Wertz I. Shimizu H. Arnott D. Frantz G.D. Dowd P. O'Rourke K. Koeppen H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 429: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 10Esser C. Scheffner M. Hohfeld J. J. Biol.

At least some of these (PirH2 and Cop1) have been identified as p53-responsive gene products, similar to MDM2. The relative importance of these ligases and the context in which they may regulate p53 have not been fully clarified.MDM2, in addition to promoting p53 degradation, can also affect the localization of p53. Two nuclear export signals (NES) 3The abbreviations used are: NES, nuclear export signal; DBD, DNA-binding domain; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; pAb, primary antibody; TEV, tobacco etch virus; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild type; DKO, double knockout; Ub, ubiquitin. 3The abbreviations used are: NES, nuclear export signal; DBD, DNA-binding domain; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; pAb, primary antibody; TEV, tobacco etch virus; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild type; DKO, double knockout; Ub, ubiquitin. have been identified in p53, one located within the C-terminal oligomerization domain and the other located in the N terminus (12Stommel J.M. Marchenko N.D. Jimenez G.S. Moll U.M. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1660-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 13Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Science. 2001; 292: 1910-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). MDM2 promoted wild-type p53 nuclear export in cells transiently co-expressing both proteins (14Geyer R.K. Yu Z.K. Maki C.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 15Boyd S.D. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). This effect required the C-terminal NES of p53 and was not observed with an MDM2 mutant that lacks its ability to promote p53 ubiquitination. It was also reported that mutation of the six C-terminal lysines in p53 inhibited its nuclear export by MDM2 (16Gu J. Nie L. Wiederschain D. Yuan Z.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8533-8546Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Lohrum M.A. Woods D.B. Ludwig R.L. Balint E. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8521-8532Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These findings supported a model in which MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of one or more lysines in the p53 C terminus promotes p53 nuclear export by exposing or activating the C-terminal NES. In this regard, it is worth noting studies in which wild-type p53 that is sequestered in the cytoplasm of breast, liver, and neuroblastoma cancer cell lines shuttled back into the nucleus upon treatment with either MDM2 antisense oligonucleotides, or the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin-B (12Stommel J.M.

Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These findings suggested cytoplasmic localization of p53 in these cancers is MDM2-dependent and results from excessive nuclear export.Over 50% of human cancers harbor missense mutations in the p53 gene (20Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C. Science. 1991; 253: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (7412) Google Scholar). These mutations are found almost exclusively in the DNA-binding domain (21Soussi T. Dehouche K. Beroud C. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 15: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 22Olivier M. Eeles R. Hollstein M. Khan M.A. Harris C.C. Hainaut P. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar) and inhibit the ability of p53 to activate expression of its downstream target genes. Cancer-derived p53 mutations also affect the conformation and localization of p53 to varying extents. Changes in p53 conformation can be monitored by reactivity with conformation-specific antibodies that recognize p53 in either a wild-type (pAb1620) or mutant (pAb240) conformation (23Milner J. Cook A. Sheldon M. Oncogene. 1987; 1: 453-455PubMed Google Scholar, 24Gannon J.V. Greaves R. Iggo R. Lane D.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1595-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding changes in conformation, a number of other unique properties have been ascribed to mutant p53s that can distinguish them from the wild-type protein. Most obvious among these is the pronounced stability exhibited by mutant p53s. This stability may result from either association of mutant p53s with stabilizing complexes, some of which include Hsp90 (25Peng Y. Chen L. Li C. Lu W. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40583-40590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), or from an inability of mutant p53s to activate expression of proteins like MDM2, PirH2, or Cop1 that could promote its degradation. Mutant p53s are also susceptible to various post-translational modifications to which wild-type p53 may be relatively resistant, such as ribosylation and ubiquitination (26Wesierska-Gadek J. Bugajska-Schretter A. Cerni C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 62: 90-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 27Shimizu H. Saliba D. Wallace M. Finlan L. Langridge-Smith P.R. Hupp T.R. Biochem. J. 2006; 397: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Finally, a number of oncogenic and growth-promoting properties have been ascribed to mutant p53. Included among these is the ability to inhibit the transcriptional activity of wild-type p53, and the p53 family members p73 and p63, in a dominant-negative fashion (28Koutsodontis G. Vasilaki E. Chou W.C. Papakosta P. Kardassis D. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 443-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Such oncogenic properties may explain the selective retention of mutant p53s in cancer (29Irwin M.S. Kondo K. Marin M.C. Cheng L.S. Hahn W.C. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 403-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 30Irwin M.S. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 319-323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In this study, we observed that certain cancer-derived p53s with a mutant (pAb1620-/pAb240+) conformation localized in the cytoplasm and displayed an increased susceptibility to ubiquitination. The cytoplasmic localization of mutant p53s depended on the C-terminal NES and an intact ubiquitination pathway. Ubiquitination of mutant p53 occurred at lysines in the DBD and the C terminus. Interestingly, Lys to Arg mutations that inhibited ubiquitination also restored nuclear localization to mutant p53 but had no apparent effect on p53 conformation. These results suggested that conformational change could expose lysines in mutant p53 for ubiquitination, and ubiquitination of these lysines promotes nuclear export. Wild-type p53, like mutant p53, is ubiquitinated by MDM2 in both the DBD and C terminus, and ubiquitination in both regions contributes to its nuclear export. MDM2 binding induces a conformational change in wild-type p53, but this conformational change is insufficient to promote p53 nuclear export in the absence of MDM2 ubiquitination activity. Based on these results, we suggest a model in which MDM2-binding induces a conformational change in wild-type p53 that exposes lysines for ubiquitination. Ubiquitination, in turn, exposes the C-terminal NES for nuclear export.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfections—Saos-2 (p53-null) and U2OS (p53 wild-type) are osteosarcoma cell lines. p53/MDM2 double knock-out (DKO) mouse embryo fibroblasts were from Rudy Alarcon (Stanford University). These cells were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin. ts-20 cells were from Harvey Ozer (University of Medicine and Dentistry, New Jersey) and harbor a temperature-sensitive mutation in the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme system (31Chowdary D.R. Dermody J.J. Jha K.K. Ozer H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). ts-20 cells were maintained at 32 or 39 °C, as indicated in the text. Transfections were done using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s protocol when cells were ∼60% confluent. Briefly, cells were transfected with 0.5-1.0 μg of FLAG p53 DNA alone or with 1.0 μg of DNA encoding MDM2 and/or Myc-tagged ubiquitin (myc-Ub). Total DNA in each transfection was equalized by the addition of empty plasmid. 100 μl of serum and antibiotic-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium were mixed with 3 μl of FuGENE 6, incubated at room temperature for 5 min, and then mixed with the appropriate DNAs. Following 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the mixture was added to cells to initiate transfection. Cell lysates were harvested 20-24 h later.Plasmid DNAs—FLAG-tagged wild-type p53 has been described previously (32Gu J. Chen D. Rosenblum J. Rubin R.M. Yuan Z.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and was from Zhi-min Yuan (Harvard School of Public Health). This DNA contains wild-type p53 sequences cloned into BamHI and XbaI sites downstream of the FLAG epitope. Myc-tagged ubiquitin DNA (33Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar) was from Ron Kopito (Stanford University). DNAs encoding untagged p53 mutants V143A, R248W, and H179E were from Peter Howley (Harvard Medical School). DNAs encoding wild-type MDM2 and HA-tagged p53 C135Y were from Steve Grossman (University of Massachusetts Medical School). Untagged p53 mutant DNAs were amplified by PCR to contain a BamHI site at their N termini and an EcoRI site at their C termini and were then cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites downstream of the FLAG epitope. NES mutants of FLAG p53 C135Y and FLAG p53 V143A were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the following primer and its complement: 5′-GAGCTGAATGAGGCCGCAGAAGCCAAGGATGCCCAGGCTG-3′. Lysine to arginine mutants of FLAG p53 WT and FLAG p53 C135Y were also generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit using FLAG p53 (WT or C135Y) as the template and the following primers and their complements: for the K372R,K373R mutation, 5′-CAGCCACCTGAAGTCCAGAAGGGGTCAGTCTACCTCC-3′; for the K370R mutation, 5′-CACTCCAGCCACCTGAGGTCCAGAAGGGGTCAG-3′; for the K381R,K382R mutation, 5′-CTACCTCCCGCCATAGGAGGCTCATGTTCAAG-3′; for the K386R mutation, 5′-CTCATGTTCAGGACAGAAGG-3′; for the K357R mutation, 5′-GCCCAGGCTGGGAGGGAGCCAGGG-3′; for the K351R mutation, 5′-CCTTGGAACTCAGGGATGCCCAG-3′; for the K319R,K320R,K321R mutation, 5′-CCTCTCCCCAGCCAAGGAGGAGACCACTGGATGGAG-3′; for the K305R mutation, 5′-GGAGCACTAGGCGAGCACTG-3′; for the K292R,K293R mutation, 5′-CTCCGCAGGAGAGGGGAGCCTC-3′; for K164R mutation, 5′-GCCATCTACAGGCAGTCACAGC-3′; for the K139R mutation, 5′-CAACTGGCCAGGACCTGCCCTG-3′; for the K132R mutation, 5′-GCCCTCAACAGGATGTTTTACC-3′; for the K120R mutation, 5′-GGGACAGCCAGGTCTGTGACTTG-3′; for the K101R mutation, 5′-CCTTCCCAGAGAACCTACCAG-3′; and for the K24R mutation, 5′-GACCTATGGAGACTACTTCCTG-3′. p53-(Δ101-195) was generated by two-step PCR using the following primer and its complement: 5′-GTCCCTTCCCAGCGAGTGGAAGG-3′.DNAs Encoding TEV-cleavable p53—The TEV protease cleavage site is 7 amino acids long (ENLYFQG). p53 DNAs encoding a TEV protease cleavage site at different positions were generated by two-step PCR. To introduce the TEV site at position 364, the following two primers were used: 5′-GGGAGCAGGGCTGAGAATCTCTACTTCCAGGGACACTCCAGCCA-3′ and 5′-GTGGCTGGAGTGTCCCTGGAAGTAGAGATTCTCAGCCCTGCTCCC-3′. To introduce the TEV site at position 294, the following two primers were used: 5′-CGCAAGAAAGGGGAGAATCTCTACTTCCAGGGAGAGCCTCACCAC-3′ and 5′-GTGGTGAGGCTCTCCCTGGAAGTAGAGATTCTCCCCTTTCTTGCG-3′. To introduce the TEV site at position 290, the following two primers were used: 5′-GGAAGAGAATCTCTACTTCCAGGGACGCAAGAAAGGG-3′ and 5′-CCCTTTCTTGCGTCCCTGGAAGTAGAGATTCTCTTCC-3′. An HA tag was introduced to the C terminus of p53 (TEV 290) by PCR using a C-terminal primer that encodes the HA tag 5′-CGGAATTCCTCAAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTACATGTCTGAGTCAGGCCCTTC-3′.Immunoprecipitations, Immunoblotting, and TEV Cleavage—To harvest cell lysates, cells were rinsed with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped into 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin) and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. The cells were then incubated on ice for 30 min with occasional vortexing and spun at 4 °C at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. For immunoprecipitations, the resulting supernatant was mixed for 1 h with 30 μl of protein A-agarose beads to pre-clear the lysate. The supernatant from this pre-clear was immunoprecipitated for 12-15 h at 4 °C with 2 μl of anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (F-7145, Sigma) or 1.75 μl of p53 wild-type conformation-specific antibody (pAb1620, Ab-5, Calbiochem) or mutant conformation-specific antibody (pAb240, Ab-3, Calbiochem). Immunoprecipitations were incubated with 30 μl of protein A-agarose beads for 1 h, and the beads were isolated by centrifugation for 10 s at 13,000 rpm. For direct immunoblot analysis without TEV cleavage, the beads were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer and boiled for 10 min. For TEV cleavage, the beads were washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and once with ice-cold TEV buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The beads were then resuspended in 25 μl of TEV buffer, and 1 μl of TEV protease was added. The beads were rotated in the presence of TEV protease for 3 h at room temperature, and the beads were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 s at 13,000 rpm. The supernatant contained the TEV cleavage products and was boiled for 10 min. Products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for immunoblotting. Antibodies used in immunoblotting to detect p53 included the sheep polyclonal antibody Ab-7 (Oncogene Science), monoclonal p53 antibody 1801 (Oncogene Science), and the FLAG monoclonal antibody Ab-5 (Sigma). MDM2 antibody was SMP-14 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence staining was carried out as described previously (34Inoue T. Stuart J. Leno R. Maki C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15053-15060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were transfected on glass coverslips in 6-well dishes. Cells were fixed 20-24 h later by incubation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 45 min. Cells were blocked by two 5-min incubations in the presence of 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100. FLAG p53s were detected with the anti-FLAG p53 polyclonal antibody F-7145 (Sigma) as the primary antibody, and with rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (The Jackson Laboratory) as the secondary antibody. DNA was stained with DAPI. Cells were visualized using a fluorescence microscope. Merged images showing FLAG p53 localization, and DNA stainings were obtained. The staining pattern for p53 was scored for 100-150 cells in two or three separate experiments.RESULTSMutant p53s Are Cytoplasmic and Dependent on Their C-terminal NES and an Intact Ubiquitination Pathway—Cancer-associated mutations in p53 occur almost exclusively in the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and alter the conformation and localization of p53 to varying extents. p53 conformation can be monitored by assessing reactivity with the conformation-specific antibodies pAb1620 (wild-type specific) and pAb240 (mutant specific) (23Milner J. Cook A. Sheldon M. Oncogene. 1987; 1: 453-455PubMed Google Scholar, 24Gannon J.V. Greaves R. Iggo R. Lane D.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1595-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). In our first experiment, Saos-2 cells (p53 null) were transfected with DNAs encoding FLAG-tagged p53 that was either wild-type or harbored different cancer-associated mutations. Transfected cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with wild-type (pAb1620) or mutant (pAb240) antibodies, followed by immunoblotting for p53. The relative amount of p53 immunoprecipitated by the wild-type or mutant-specific antibodies is an indication of p53 conformation. As shown in Fig. 1C, wild-type (WT) p53 and p53 R248W displayed a mostly wild-type conformation, and p53 C135Y, H179E, and V143A were all mostly mutant in their conformation. Next, we monitored localization of the different p53 proteins by immunofluorescence staining. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, wild-type p53 and p53 R248W displayed a mostly nuclear localization, whereas p53 C135Y, V143A, and H179E localized throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm in most cells in which they were expressed. These results support a correlation between the conformation and localization of p53. Specifically, p53s with a mostly mutant conformation (such as V143A, C135Y, and H179E) localize in the cytoplasm to a greater extent than p53s with a more wild-type conformation (such as R248W).Wild-type p53 contains an NES in its C terminus that is required for MDM2-dependent nuclear export (14Geyer R.K. Yu Z.K. Maki C.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 15Boyd S.D. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if cytoplasmic localization of cancer-derived p53 mutants involves nuclear export, then mutation of this NES would cause the mutants to assume a more nuclear localization. To test this, we mutated the C-terminal NES in p53 C135Y and p53 V143A and monitored their localization in transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, nonmutated p53 C135Y and p53 V143A displayed largely cytoplasmic localizations, whereas the p53 C135Y NES and p53 V143A NES mutants were re-localized almost completely to the nucleus. This indicates that cytoplasmic localization of these mutants requires an intact NES in the p53 C terminus. Importantly, the NES mutations had no apparent effect on conformation of p53 C135Y and p53 V143A, at least to the extent the wild-type and mutant-specific antibodies can recognize changes in p53 conformation (Fig. 2C). This suggests that nuclear accumulation of the NES mutants was not due to a change in their conformation. In total, these results suggest cytoplasmic localization of mutant p53s involves nuclear export via the p53 C-terminal NES. It should also be noted that the NES mutant of p53 C135Y was still ubiquitinated in cells when co-expressed with myc-Ub (Fig. 4B), indicating the nuclear accumulation of p53 C135Y NES was not due to an inability to be ubiquitinated.FIGURE 2Cytoplasmic localization of mutant p53s requires an intact NES in the C terminus. A, U2OS cells were transfected with DNAs encoding the indicated FLAG-tagged p53s. p53 localization was monitored by immunofluorescence staining with an anti-FLAG antibody (red) and DNA was visualized by DAPI staining (blue).

Support for this comes from studies in which p53 nuclear export by MDM2 was inhibited at the nonpermissive temperature in ts-20 cells (15Boyd S.D. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), which harbor a temperature-sensitive mutation in the ubiquitin-activating enzyme. These cells maintain ubiquitination activity at 32 °C but lose ubiquitination activity at 39 °C (35Zeng G.C. Donegan J. Ozer H.L. Hand R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To test whether an intact ubiquitination system is required for mutant p53 nuclear export, we monitored p53 C135Y localization in ts-20 cells at 32 °C and nonpermissive 39 °C. We also monitored wild-type p53 nuclear export at both temperatures as a control for the experiment. As shown in Fig. 3A, wild-type p53 was mostly nuclear when expressed alone, but re-localized to the cytoplasm (was exported) when co-expressed with MDM2 in ts-20 cells that were maintained at 32 °C. In contrast, wild-type p53 remained largely nuclear when expressed alone or with MDM2 in ts-20 cells that were grown at 39 °C to inhibit ubiquitination activity. This is consistent with previous findings that ubiquitination activity is required for MDM2 to promote p53 nuclear export (15Boyd S.D. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Mutant p53 (C135Y) was mostly cytoplasmic in ts-20 cells at 32 °C, but it accumulated in the nucleus in ts-20 cells at 39 °C (Fig. 3B). This indicates that nuclear export of mutant p53 (C135Y) also depends, at least in part, on an intact ubiquitination pathway. p53 C135Y displayed a mostly cytoplasmic localization at both 32 and 39 °C in U2OS cells, indicating that nuclear accumulation of p53 C135Y at 39 °C is only seen in cells (ts-20) where ubiquitination activity can be inhibited at elevated temperature.FIGURE 3Nuclear export of mutant p53s requires an intact ubiquitination system. A, ts-20 cells were grown at 37 °C and transfected with DNAs encoding FLAG-tagged WT p53 and MDM2 (1 μg each). 3-4 h after transfection, the cells were switched to either 32 or 39 °C for 20 h. p53 localization was monitored by immunofluorescence staining in cells in which it was co-expressed with MDM2, and p53 localization was scored. The graph shows the percent cells with the indicated p53 localization. Average results from two separate experiments are shown. MDM2 displayed a nuclear only localization in the majority of cells. Cells in which MDM2 was not completely nuclear were excluded from the analysis. B, ts-20 cells and U2OS cells were transfected with DNA encoding FLAG-tagged p53 C135Y (1 μg). The cells were then either maintained at 32 °C or shifted to 39 °C for 20 h. p53 C135Y localization was monitored by immunofluorescence staining with an anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody, and p53 C135Y localization was scored. The graph shows the percent cells with the indicated p53 C135Y localization. Average results from two separate experiments are shown.View Large"

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is considered to be a major virulence determinant of this encapsulated bacterium and most mutations to the lipid A anchor of LPS are conditionally lethal to the bacterium. We studied the role of LPS acylation in K. pneumoniae disease pathogenesis by using a mutation of lpxM (msbB/waaN), which encodes the enzyme responsible for late secondary acylation of immature lipid A molecules. A K. pneumoniae B5055 (K2:O1) lpxM mutant was found to be attenuated for growth in the lungs in a mouse pneumonia model leading to reduced lethality of the bacterium. B5055ΔlpxM exhibited similar sensitivity to phagocytosis or complement-mediated lysis than B5055, unlike the non-encapsulated mutant B5055nm. In vitro, B5055ΔlpxM showed increased permeability of the outer membrane and an increased susceptibility to certain antibacterial peptides suggesting that in vivo attenuation may be due in part to sensitivity to antibacterial peptides present in the lungs of BALB/c mice. These data support the view that lipopolysaccharide acylation plays a important role in providing Gram-negative bacteria some resistance to structural and innate defenses and especially the antibacterial properties of detergents (e.g. bile) and cationic defensins.

These data support the view that lipopolysaccharide acylation plays a important role in providing Gram-negative bacteria some resistance to structural and innate defenses and especially the antibacterial properties of detergents (e.g. bile) and cationic defensins. Klebsiella pneumoniae is a common cause of nosocomial pneumonia, septicemia, and urinary tract infections; a recent US study found the bacterium to be the third most commonly isolated organism from intensive care wards and the most common species identified in blood cultures (1Neuhauser M.M. Weinstein R.A. Rydman R. Danziger L.H. Karam G. Quinn J.P. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2003; 289: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), with a similar trend reported among European hospitals (2Hanberger H. Garcia-Rodriguez J.A. Gobernado M. Goossens H. Nilsson L.E. Struelens M.J. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1999; 281: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). This rising prevalence combined with the extensive spread of antibiotic-resistant strains, especially extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains, will drive the search for alternative treatments and/or an effective vaccine against the bacterium. K. pneumoniae is known to express a number of virulence determinants, including a thick polysaccharide capsule. The capsule protects the bacterium from phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (3Simoons-Smit A.M. Verwey-van Vught A.M. Kanis I.Y. MacLaren D.M. J. Med. Microbiol. 1984; 17: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and is thought to prevent killing of the bacterium by bactericidal serum factors (4Williams P. Lambert P.A. Brown M.R. Jones R.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1983; 129: 2181-2191PubMed Google Scholar). Other, well studied virulence factors of K. pneumoniae include the pili/fimbriae and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). 6The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentrations; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight.6The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentrations; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight. LPS consists of an outer membrane-embedded lipid A molecule, partially conserved inner core carbohydrate structure, attached to an outer core (of which there are at least two variants, conferred by the waa operon (5Regue M. Izquierdo L. Fresno S. Pique N. Corsaro M.M. Naldi T. De Castro C. Waidelich D. Merino S. Tomas J.M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 4198-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)), and a repeated polysaccharide or O-antigen (O-Ag). The O-Ag region specifically is thought to play a role in resistance to complement killing (6Merino S. Camprubi S. Alberti S. Benedi V.J. Tomas J.M. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 2529-2535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to contribute to bacteremia and lethality during murine pneumonia infections (7Shankar-Sinha S. Valencia G.A. Janes B.K. Rosenberg J.K. Whitfield C. Bender R.A. Standiford T.J. Younger J.G. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 1423-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) although this contribution is still disputed (8Cortes G. Borrell N. de Astorza B. Gomez C. Sauleda J. Alberti S. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 2583-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The comparatively small number of Klebsiella LPS or O-types (9 serotypes) compared with capsule or K-types (>77 serotypes) suggests that LPS could be utilized for vaccination. However any LPS-based vaccines would need to be detoxified before use in humans. The lipid A (endotoxic) region of LPS has been studied as a possible virulence determinant in a number of Gram-negative bacteria (9Somerville Jr., J.E. Cassiano L. Darveau R.P. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6583-6590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Khan S.A. Everest P. Servos S. Foxwell N. Zahringer U. Brade H. Rietschel E.T. Dougan G. Charles I.G. Maskell D.J. Mol.

J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5240-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) but has not yet been studied in detail in K. pneumoniae in vivo. Lipid A is thought to be the primary inflammatory component of LPS because of specific and sensitive recognition by the innate immune system (12Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 173: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). The structure of K. pneumoniae lipid A differs from the classical lipid A form (i.e. Escherichia coli) only by the presence of a secondary myristoyl residue mainly taking the place of the lauroyl group, resulting in two secondary myristoyl chains for K. pneumoniae (13Sforza S. Silipo A. Molinaro A. Marchelli R. Parrilli M. Lanzetta R. J. Mass Spectrom. 2004; 39: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), see Fig. 1. Lipid A is generally considered essential for normal growth of Gram-negative bacteria albeit an LPS-deficient mutant of Neisseria meningitidis has been constructed which shows a reduced growth rate (14Steeghs L. de Cock H. Evers E. Zomer B. Tommassen J. van der Ley P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6937-6945Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). There are only a small number of mutations that can be made in the lipid A molecule that do not affect the growth of the bacterium. One mutation that has been studied in a number of Enterobacteriacceae is in lpxM (formally msbB or waaN) which encodes the enzyme responsible for the addition of one of the secondary acyl chains (10Khan S.A. Everest P. Servos S. Foxwell N. Zahringer U. Brade H. Rietschel E.T. Dougan G. Charles I.G. Maskell D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 15Somerville Jr., J.E. Cassiano L. Bainbridge B. Cunningham M.D. Darveau R.P. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Mutation of lpxM has had varying and inconclusive effects in animal models for different pathogens: attenuation of an lpxM mutant in a mouse model of Salmonella enterica var Typhimurium (10Khan S.A. Everest P. Servos S. Foxwell N. Zahringer U. Brade H. Rietschel E.T. Dougan G. Charles I.G. Maskell D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) was consequently attributed to secondary mutations induced by the lpxM defect (16Murray S.R. Bermudes D. de Felipe K.S. Low K.B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5554-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); Shigella flexneri lpxM mutants showed attenuated inflammation in a rabbit ligation loop model (11D'Hauteville H. Khan S. Maskell D.J. Kussak A. Weintraub A. Mathison J. Ulevitch R.J. Wuscher N. Parsot C. Sansonetti P.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5240-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), while N. meningitidis lpxM mutants showed defects in assembly and incorporation of the lipid A into the outer membrane thereby precluding in vivo analysis (17Post D.M. Ketterer M.R. Phillips N.J. Gibson B.W. Apicella M.A. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The only attenuation in a murine model of infection directly linked to the lpxM mutation has been in a clinical isolate of E. coli, however secondary effects such as capsule reduction and filament formation were also seen in this bacterium (9Somerville Jr., J.E. Cassiano L. Darveau R.P. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6583-6590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) making data interpretation difficult. The effect of underacylated lipid A on human cells is better understood as purified pentaacyl and tetraacyl LPS has been shown to act as an endotoxin antagonist in the induction of cytokines because of differential recognition by human MD2·TLR4 complexes (18Hajjar A.M. Ernst R.K. Tsai J.H. Wilson C.B. Miller S.I. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). However, this is not the case for murine cells as mouse MD2:TLR4 do not appear to differentiate between acylation states of lipid A (18Hajjar A.M. Ernst R.K. Tsai J.H. Wilson C.B. Miller S.I. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was therefore to analyze an lpxM mutant of K. pneumoniae for in vivo attenuation and to understand the mechanisms leading to any observed attenuation, with a view to increasing our global understanding of the role of LPS. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—The K. pneumoniae strain used was B5055, a mouse virulent clinical isolate (serotype K2:O1) or non-encapsulated mutant designated B5055 nm, produced by Tania Uren and Adam Jenney through the inactivation of wza and wzb, data not shown. E. coli JM109 and the plasmid pGEM T-Easy or pBR322 (Promega) were used for cloning work (Table 1). The temperature-sensitive plasmid pKD46 (19Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10838) Google Scholar) was used to induce λ red recombinase production in the host cell to enhance homologous recombination. Bacteria were grown in Luria broth (LB) or on Luria agar (LA) at 37 °C (except for induction of λ red recombinase when bacteria were cultured at 30 °C). Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: ampicillin at 100 μg/ml, kanamycin at 60 μg/ml, and chloramphenicol at 30 μg/ml.TABLE 1Bacterial strains and plasmidsStrain or plasmidRelevant characteristicReference or sourceK. pneumoniae strains B5055K2:O1, mouse lethal clinical isolateD.HansenSSI B5055nmB5055, mutation in wza/wzb, non-mucoidA.

The entire gene plus 500 bp at either end of the open reading frame was cloned from B5055 using oligonucleotide primers (5′-GTCACACTAGTGTCCAGTTCGACAACGTGGAAG and 5′-CTAGTGGGCCCGGTAAGGATTACTATGCCATCC, which include the underlined restriction enzyme sites SpeI and ApaI, respectively. The gene was ligated using these sites into pGEM T-EASY (to form pGEM-lpxM) and digested with BssHII and SphI to remove a central 142-bp fragment. A chloramphenicol resistance cassette (cat) from pACYC184 was amplified with primers 5′-ACTGTGCATGCCGTAAGAGGTTCCAACTTTCAC and 5′-GATCAGCGCGCGTAGCAGCACCAGGCGTTTAAGGG and cloned into pGEM-lpxM using the underlined SphI and BssHII sites (to form pGEM-lpxM/Chl). pKD46 was electroporated into B5055 (2.5 kV, 25 μF, 200 Ω) and grown at 30 °C with l-arabinose to induce λ red recombinase production. The lpxM-Chl fragment was then amplified as a 2755-bp linear fragment, gel-purified, and digested with NotI to remove any residual intact plasmid. The linear DNA fragment was then electroporated into B5055 + pKD46 or B5055nm + pKD46 and grown at 37 °C on chloramphenicol to remove pKD46 and select for recombinants, respectively. The anticipated disrupted lpxM gene size was confirmed by PCR and confirmed recombinants designated B5055ΔlpxM and B5055nmΔlpxM (for capsulated and unencapsulated strains, respectively). pGEM-lpxM and pBR-lpxM (lpxM gene amplified with SalI and EcoRI sites and ligated into pBR322 using these sites) were used as high and low copy number constructs for complementation studies. SDS-PAGE Analysis of the Mutant—Crude LPS preparations were made by pelleting cells from 3 ml of overnight (o/n) cultures. The pellets were resuspended in Laemmli buffer (2.3% SDS, 0.8% Tris, 10% glycerol, 5% dithiothreitol) and samples boiled for 10 min. Samples were digested with proteinase K (0.417 μg/μl) for 2 h at 56°C. SDS-PAGE was performed on 15% polyacrylamide gels (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and stained with alkaline silver stain to visualize LPS (21Tsai C.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar). Extraction and Quantification of Capsule—Cell-associated capsule was extracted from mid-log and static cultures by the phenol-extraction method (22Westphal O. Jann K. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1963; 5: 83-91Google Scholar). Briefly, 5-ml samples were centrifuged (5000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), washed, resuspended in 500 μl of dH2O, and viable counts determined. Samples were then incubated at 68 °C for 2 min before addition of 500 μl of phenol, incubation was then continued for 30 min. Mixture was cooled, and 500 μl of chloroform added, centrifuged, and aqueous phase taken. Capsular material was precipitated at -20 °C for 20 min and resuspended in 500 μl of dH2O. Uronic acid content was determined as previously described (23Blumenkrantz N. Asboe-Hansen G. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 54: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (5784) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.2 ml of 12.5 mm tetraborate in concentrated H2SO4 was added to 200 μl of sample and vortexed vigorously. Samples were then boiled for 5 min and cooled before addition of 20 μl of 0.15% 3-hydroxydiphenol in 0.5% NaOH. Absorbance was measured at 520 nm. Standard curves were constructed with glucuronic acid. Bacterial capsules were also visualized by Maneval's stain (24Maneval W.E. Staining Technol. 1941; 16: 13-19Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thin Layer Chromatography of 32P-labeled Lipid A—Strains were grown to mid-log with 5 μCi/ml 32Pi in the presence and absence of EDTA to activate pagP (25Jia W. Zoeiby A.E. Petruzziello T.N.

Lipid A was extracted from cells by the mild acid hydrolysis method as described in Ref. 26Zhou Z. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18503-18514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar with slight modifications: initial single phase Bligh/Dyer incubation was at room temperature for 10 min rather than 60 min and the lipid A recovered after two-phase Bligh/Dyer was washed only once with fresh two-phase Bligh/Dyer mixture. 1000 cpm of each lipid preparation was applied to the origin of a Silica Gel 60 TLC. The plate was developed using the solvent chloroform:pyridine:88% formic acid:water (50:50:16:5, v/v) and exposed to a PhosPhorImage Screen overnight for visualization. MALDI-MS Analysis of Lipid A—Lipid A samples were resuspended in chloroform/methanol (4:1 v/v) and analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. Mass spectra were acquired on a Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer (PerSpective Biosystems) in the negative reflector mode, scanning over a mass/charge range of 1000–3000, and using an extraction delay time of 92 ns and an accelerating voltage of 21 kV. Saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) in 60% 1-propyl alcohol was used as the matrix, and free glycosylphosphatidylinositols of known molecular weights (27Ralton J.E. McConville M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4245-4257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) were used as standards. GC-MS Analysis of Lipid A—Lipid A samples containing scyllo inositol standard (1 nm) were resuspended in methanol, dried under vacuum, and then subjected to methanolysis in 0.5 m methanolic HCl (50 μl, Sigma) at 80 °C for 16 h. The samples were N-acetylated with pyridine (10 μl) and acetic anhydride (10 μl) for 15 min at 25 °C, dried under vacuum, and derivatized with N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide + 1% trichloromethylsilane (50 μl; Pierce) for 1 h at 25 °C. Samples were injected directly onto the GC-MS and analyzed as previously described (27Ralton J.E. McConville M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4245-4257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To investigate modification of lipid A with amino-arabinose, dried lipid A samples were resuspended in either water (200 μl) or 10 mm HCl (200 μl) and incubated at 100 °C for 10 min. The mixture was subjected to biphasic 1-butyl alcohol:water (1:1 v/v) partitioning. The lipid A species recovered in the butanol fraction were dried under vacuum, subjected to methanolysis, and GC-MS analysis as described above. In Vivo Growth—B5055 and B5055ΔlpxM were grown to mid-log and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and diluted to ∼104 cfu/dose. BALB/c mice (6–8 week old) were inoculated intravenously with 200 μl, or intranasally with 50 μl of bacterial suspension. Five mice for each bacterial strain tested were euthanased at 4, 24, and 72 h time points, and lungs, livers, and spleens were aseptically removed. Organs were homogenized in sterile phosphate-buffered saline and plated on LA with appropriate antibiotics at several dilutions to obtain a viable count. Complement-mediated Lysis Assay—Complement-mediated lysis assay was performed as described previously (6Merino S. Camprubi S. Alberti S. Benedi V.J. Tomas J.M. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 2529-2535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 400 μl of human sera (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to ∼106 cfu/100 μl of bacteria (mid-log phase) and incubated at 37 °C, with rotation. Samples were taken every 30 min and plated for counts. Heat-inactivated sera (56 °C, 30 min) was used as a negative control for all strains. Whole Blood Phagocytosis Assay—300 μl of fresh (used within 30 min of removal) whole mouse or human blood was mixed with ∼107 cfu/100 μl of B5055, B5055nm, B5055ΔlpxM, and B5055nmΔlpxM (grown to mid-log phase) and incubated for 3 h with rotation at 37 °C. Bacterial dilutions were plated to obtain viable counts. The bacterial counts recovered were divided by the initial counts to give a survival index, with <1 indicating a susceptible organism (i.e. bacteria killed) and >1 indicating a resistant organism (i.e. bacteria proliferated). Outer Membrane Permeability Assay—All strains were transformed with pGEM T-EASY and pBR322 (except complemented strains) to enable β-lactamase production. β-lactamase leakage from the periplasm into the culture supernatant was measured using a nitrocephin (Oxoid) spectrophotometric assay exactly as described previously (28Frirdich E.

Sensitivity to Antimicrobial Peptides and Antibiotics—MICs for B5055, B5055ΔlpxM, and the complemented mutant (B5055ΔlpxM + pGEM-lpxM) were determined for a range of antimicrobial peptides and antibiotics as described previously (30Amsterdam D. Lorian V. Antibiotics in Laboratory Medicine. 4th Ed. Williams and Wilkins, Baltimore, MD1996: 52-111Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates containing 0.125–64 μg/ml peptides or antibiotics were prepared by 2-fold dilution in LB and wells inoculated with ∼5 × 105 cfu/ml of mid-log bacterial cultures. Growth was scored after 18–24 h. Peptides were synthesized by standard f-moc chemistry at the Nucleic Acids and Protein Synthesis Unit, University of British Columbia and reconstituted in deionized water at 2 mg/ml. C18G Sensitivity Assay—Mid-log bacterial cultures were diluted to ∼5 × 104 cfu/ml, and 50 μl of bacteria added to 250 μl of normal human sera plus C18G (synthesized by Jackson Laboratory, University of Melbourne from published sequence (31Darveau R.P.

Samples were rotated at 37 °C for 3 h, and aliquots diluted to obtain viable counts. The lpxM gene was identified in the sequenced K. pneumoniae MGH75878 genome by homology to the lpxM genes from E. coli (AAC74925) and S. enterica var Typhimurium (AAL20805). 76% nucleotide homology exists between E. coli and K. pneumonaie lpxM genes with a probability score of 4.4e-119. ClustalW protein analysis is shown in Fig. 1A. A second region of homology (55% nucleotide homology, p = 2.6e-8) was found to have higher homology to lpxL (71%, p = 1.2e-93) and is therefore believed to be one of two lpxL homologs present in MGH75878. Primers were designed from the MGH75878 sequence to amplify the lpxM gene from K. pneumoniae B5055 (K2:O1). The gene was disrupted by removal of an internal 142 bp and addition of a cat (chloramphenicol acetyl transferase) gene and then re-introduced into B5055 and B5055nm (a non-encapsulated mutant of B5055 containing a deletion in wza-wzc). Mutants with the disrupted gene (B5055ΔlpxM or B5055nmΔlpxM) incorporated were selected on chloramphenicol plates and resultant colonies confirmed by PCR (Fig. 1B) and Southern blotting. Wild type and B5055ΔlpxM cells synthesized equivalent levels of LPS, as shown by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C) and monosaccharide analysis of total cell extracts (data not shown). Analysis of uronic acids levels in the wild type and the B5055ΔlpxM mutant indicated that both strains synthesized a cell-associated capsule. Total capsule uronic acid in the mutant was approximately half that of the wild type (12.61 ± 0.43 ng/106 cfu versus 21.13 ± 4.6 ng/106 cfu), but much higher than in the non-encapsulated B5055nm mutant (p < 0.0001). The cell-associated capsule of B5055ΔlpxM appeared ultrastructurally similar to the capsule of wild type cells when stained with Maneval's stain (Fig. 1D) and appeared to be functionally intact as shown by the resistance of the lpxM mutant to innate immune mechanisms for which the capsule is required (Figs. 5 and 6).FIGURE 6Whole blood phagocytosis of K. pneumoniae mutant strains. 300 μl of fresh whole (murine) blood was mixed with 107 cfu/100 μlofthe labeled bacterial strains and incubated for 3 h with rotation, 37 °C. The bacterial counts recovered were divided by the initial counts to give a survival index, with <1 indicating a susceptible organism (i.e. bacteria killed) and >1 indicating a resistant organism (i.e. bacteria proliferated).

This was confirmed by TLC analysis of the 32P-labeled lipid A moieties, GC-MS and MALDI-MS. (Fig. 3) and thin layer chromatography (TLC) of 32P-labeled lipid A (Fig. 2). The TLC analysis showed that the lipid A of wild type LPS was primarily hexaacylated (see species labeled 1(1-OH), 1(1-O-P), and 1(1-O-PP)), while the majority of the lpxM mutant was predominantly pentaacylated (species labeled 2(1-OH), 2(1-O-P), and 2(1-O-PP) (Fig. 2). The lipid A moieties from both wild type and mutant cells were similarly phosphorylated at the reducing termini of the chitobiose backbone. A significant pool of lipid A in the mutant contained molecular species that corresponded to palmitoylated pentaacyl-lipid A (Pal-2 (1-OH). The abundance of this species and several other species with the expected migration position of palmitoylated pentaacyl-lipid A increased dramatically when cultures were treated with EDTA prior to harvesting, conditions known to induce palmitoylation of the lipid A by pagP (25Jia W.

A pagP homolog has not been published for K. pneumoniae however BLAST analysis revealed a region of homology to pagP from E. coli K12 (GI: 946360) in MGH78578. ClustalW analysis shows the translated genes to have 72% amino acid homology, with the C-terminal half showing higher amino acid homology (86%) than the N-terminal half (58%). The absence of heptaacylated lipid A in the EDTA-treated lpxM mutant, indicated that very little, if any of the lipid A in this mutant is hexacylated.FIGURE 2Thin layer chromatography of 32P-labeled lipid A species extracted from K. pneumoniae wild type and lpxM mutant grown in the presence (lanes 2 and 4) or absence (lanes 1 and 3) of EDTA. Species 1 is hexaacyl lipid A and 2 is pentaacyl lipid A; palmitoylated variations are prefixed with pal (i.e. Pal-1 is palmitoylated hexaacyl lipid A and Pal-2 is palmitoylated pentaacyl lipid A. 1-OH, 1-O-P, and 1-O-PP contain 0, 1, or 2 phosphate groups at the reducing termini of the lipid A chitobiose core (see Fig. 3 for structure).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm the TLC-based assignments of lipid A structure, the lipid A moieties of wild type and lpxM mutant LPS was analyzed by MALDI-TOF (Fig. 3). The negative ion MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of wild type lipid A contained a series of prominent molecular ions that indicated hexaacylated, bisphosphoylated structure with a variable 2′ secondary acyl chain. The secondary acyl chain comprised (in order of abundance) myristate (m/z 1822), laurate (m/z 1794), or hydroxymyristate (m/z 1838), consistent with previous reports for K. pneumoniae lipid A (13Sforza S.

Lindner B. Nummila K. Sugiyama T. Yokochi T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Minor lipid A species containing an additional palmitate (m/z 2062) or aminoarabinose (m/z 1952) were also detected. In contrast, the lipid A from the lpxM mutant was separated by MALDI-MS into two major clusters; pentaacylated, bisphosphorylated lipid A (with a variable 2′ secondary acyl substitution) or hexacylated bisphosphorylated lipid A (with a variable 2′ secondary acyl substitution and a secondary palmitate addition). These analyses are consistent with the TLC analyses, in indicating that the lipid A moiety of the lpxM mutant is under-acylated compared with the wild type lipid A, due to loss of the conserved myristate group. They also reveal that loss of myristate is partially compensated for by increased palmitoylation of the lipid A. The deletion of the lpxM gene had no apparent effects on other modification, such as substitution with aminoarabinose, as shown by GC-MS analysis of the lipid A fractions (33Lehmann V. Redmond J.

https://openalex.org/W2062203284,"Members of the caspase family are essential for many apoptotic programs. We studied mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient in caspases 3 and 7 and in caspase 9 to determine the role of these proteases in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis. Both caspase 3(-/-)/caspase 7(-/-) and caspase 9(-/-) MEFs were resistant to cytotoxicity induced via ER stress and failed to exhibit apoptotic morphology. Specifically, apoptosis induced by increased intracellular calcium was shown to depend only on caspases 3 and 9, whereas apoptosis induced by disruption of ER function depended additionally on caspase 7. Caspase 3(-/-)/caspase 7(-/-) and caspase 9(-/-) MEFs also exhibited decreased loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, which correlated with altered caspase 9 processing, increased induction of procaspase 11, and decreased processing of caspase 12 in caspase 3(-/-)/caspase 7(-/-) cells. Furthermore, disruption of ER function was sufficient to induce accumulation of cleaved caspase 3 and 7 in a heavy membrane compartment, suggesting a potential mechanism for caspase 12 processing and its role as an amplifier in the death pathway. Caspase 8(-/-) MEFs were not resistant to ER stress-induced cytotoxicity, and processing of caspase 8 was not observed upon induction of ER stress. This study thus demonstrates a requirement for caspases 3 and 9 and a key role for the intrinsic pathway in ER stress-induced apoptosis."

Protein degradation is an essential component in the regulation of proteins and their quality control in all organisms (1Vierstra R.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Many of the proteases that perform these tasks are highly selective in their targeted polypeptide substrates. This substrate specificity is achieved in certain proteases by the incorporation of a chaperone/regulatory component within the proteolytic complex. In such large multisubunit proteases, the proteolytic activity is sequestered within an internal chamber away from the surrounding cellular environment, thus preventing inadvertent degradation of non-targeted proteins. The associated regulatory component facilitates proteolysis by selectively binding protein substrates and unfolding them, often in an ATP-dependent manner. The unfolded protein is then translocated into the proteolytic chamber for degradation. This basic mechanism is shared by many well defined proteases including the 26S proteasome, Lon, Deg, FtsH, and Clp (4Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol.

The model Clp protease in Escherichia coli is composed of the proteolytic subunit ClpP, the activity of which is dependent on an AAA+ HSP100 chaperone, either ClpA or ClpX (5Gottesman S. Clark W.P.

The proteolytic subunit ClpP forms a barrel-like structure comprised of two heptameric rings. These face-to-face rings enclose a proteolytic chamber which houses the catalytic triad Ser-His-Asp characteristic of a Ser-type protease (11Wang J.M. Hartling J.A. Flanagan J.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). This chamber is capped on one or both ends by a hexameric ring of either ClpA or ClpX (12Grimaud R. Kessel M. Beuron F. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12476-12481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). These chaperone partners are responsible for substrate recognition, unfolding, and translocation into the proteolytic chamber and each confers distinct substrate specificities to the protease. Adding to the complexity of substrate recognition is the presence of modulators that alter the subset of proteins bound by the chaperone partners (13Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S.

ClpS, for example, is essential for degradation of N-end rule substrates by the ClpAP protease in eubacteria. This small adaptor protein binds directly to N-terminal destabilizing residues on the substrate protein, targeting them to ClpAP for degradation (15Dougan D.A. Reid B.G. Horwich A.L. Bukau B. Mol.

They are unique for being the only bacteria that perform oxygenic photosynthesis and as such are considered the progenitors of plant chloroplasts according to the endosymbiotic theory (17Herrmann R.G. Schenk H.E.A. Herrmann R.G. Jeon K.W. Muöller N.E. Schwemmler W. Eukaryotism and Symbiosis. 1997: 73-118Google Scholar, 18Martin W. Herrmann R.

Nature. 1998; 393: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). This complexity is mirrored by the diversity of proteases that exist in cyanobacteria (20Sokolenko A. Pojidaeva E. Zinchenko V. Panichkin V. Glaser V.M. Herrmann R.G. Shestakov S.V. Curr. Genet. 2002; 41: 291-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In the case of the Clp protease, cyanobacteria possess more than one paralog for several of the component subunits. Unlike E. coli, which has only a single ClpP, the model strain Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (Synechococcus) 4The abbreviations used are: Synechococcus, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942; Chl, chlorophyll; LSU, large subunit of Rubisco; PBS, phycobilisome; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). 4The abbreviations used are: Synechococcus, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942; Chl, chlorophyll; LSU, large subunit of Rubisco; PBS, phycobilisome; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). has three distinct ClpP paralogs as well as a ClpP-like protein termed ClpR (21Schelin J. Lindmark F. Clarke A.K. Microbiol. 2002; 148: 2255-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Though similar in sequence and size to ClpP, ClpR lacks the catalytic triad enabling it to function as a Ser-type protease (22Clarke A.K. Ann. Bot. 1999; 83: 593-599Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cyanobacteria also possess two HSP100 proteins, ClpX and ClpC that likely function as regulatory AAA+ components of the Clp protease. They also have two paralogs of the ClpS adaptor protein, which here we term ClpS1 and ClpS2. Interestingly, the complexity in cyanobacterial ClpP subunits also occurs in plant chloroplasts but to a far greater extent. Five ClpP and four ClpR paralogs exist in chloroplasts of the model higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana (23Adam Z. Adamska I. Nakabayashi K. Ostersetzer O. Haussuhl K. Manuell A. Zheng B. Vallon O. Rodermel S.R. Shinozaki K. Clarke A.K. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 1912-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). All nine proteins are found mixed together in a single 335-kDa complex, presumably in a double heptameric ring structure as for the similar-sized Clp proteolytic core in E. coli (24Peltier J.B. Ytterberg J. Liberles D.A. Roepstorff P. van Wijk K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16318-16327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Like those in land plants, chloroplasts of green algae also contain multiple ClpP and ClpR paralogs arranged in a single core complex (25Majeran W. Friso G. van Wijk K.J. Vallon O. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 5558-5571Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The significance of this complexity in the structure of the Clp proteolytic core in chloroplasts remains unknown as does the function of the ClpR variant. Although the number and types of Clp proteins in cyanobacteria have been well established, nothing is yet known about the composition of the Clp protease(s) they form. In particular it is unclear whether the various ClpP and ClpR subunits in cyanobacteria oligomerize into a single heterogeneous core complex as do their counterparts in plant chloroplasts, or form several, more simpler structures. Moreover, the identify of the HSP100 chaperone partners for whatever Clp proteolytic core complexes exist in cyanobacteria remains unknown, as does the possible interaction with the two ClpS adaptor proteins. In this study, we have examined the oligomeric structure of the various Clp proteins in Synechococcus. We report the identity of two distinct Clp proteolytic core complexes in the soluble fraction of the cell. Each core complex is a mixture of two separate subunits, and each associates with a specific HSP100 chaperone partner. We also provide evidence for the possible existence of a third Clp proteolytic core attached to the inner membrane network. Strains and Growth Conditions—Cultures of S. elongatus PCC 7942 wild type and the two mutant strains, ΔclpP1 (26Clarke A.K. Schelin J. Porankiewicz J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 791-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and ΔclpP2 (21Schelin J. Lindmark F. Clarke A.K. Microbiol. 2002; 148: 2255-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), were grown in BG-11 inorganic medium (27Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar) buffered with 10 mm 3-(N-morpholino) propanosulfonic acid (pH 7.5) and bubbled with 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C with continuous, white light of 70 μmol of photons m-2 s-1 (28Campbell D. Zhou G. Gustafsson P. Oquist G. Clarke A.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5457-5466Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Experimental cultures were inoculated from liquid precultures to a chlorophyll (Chl) concentration of 1.0 μgml-1. Experiments were conducted on exponentially growing cells at a Chl concentration of 3.0–4.5 μgml-1. Chl content was determined using whole cell spectra and the equations as previously described (29Myers J. Graham J. Wang R.T. Plant Physiol. 1980; 66: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For both mutant strains, the selection antibiotic (kanamycin for ΔclpP1, chloramphenicol for ΔclpP2) was included in the BG-11 plates and in liquid precultures but excluded from all experimental cultures to avoid possible antibiotic-induced changes in the phenotype. Preparation of Clp-specific Antibodies—In addition to those already existing for certain Clp proteins in Synechococcus, polyclonal antibodies specific for ClpR, ClpS1, and ClpS2 were prepared in this study. Antibodies for Synechococcus ClpR and ClpS1 were made against full-length recombinant proteins produced in E. coli. The recombinant ClpS1 protein was expressed with an N-terminal His tag using the pQE-80L vector (Qiagen) and ClpR as a fusion with the maltose-binding protein using the pMAL-c2 overexpression plasmid (New England Biolabs). Expression of both proteins was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to actively growing E. coli cells. Both proteins were then purified according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The ClpS2 antibody was made using the peptide CRREGLTMAPLEAA conjugated to BSA at the N terminus via a disulfide bridge. All purified proteins were injected into rabbits intramuscularly and subcutaneously to produce the specific antibodies (AgriSera). The specificity of the antibodies for all Synechococcus Clp proteins used in this study has been shown either previously (21Schelin J. Lindmark F. Clarke A.K. Microbiol. 2002; 148: 2255-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 33Porankiewicz J. Clarke A.K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5111-5117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or in the supplementary figure. Denaturing-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE)—Total cell proteins were isolated from Synechococcus cultures by first lyzing cells using a French Press (1000 psi; Thermo Spectronic) in isolation buffer containing 25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.0), 330 mm sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm ATP. Following a low-speed centrifugation (1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) to remove cell debris, internal membrane and soluble protein fractions were separated by centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. Soluble protein fractions were concentrated as necessary (Microsep 3K Omega; Pall Life Sciences), while the membrane protein fractions were washed twice with isolation buffer and repelleted at 35,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Prior to electrophoresis, NuPAGE sample buffer was added to the soluble protein fraction, and used to resuspend the membrane protein fraction as recommended (Invitrogen). Samples containing equal protein content were separated on 12% polyacrylamide Bis-Tris NuPAGE gels (or 3–8% Tris-acetate gels when detecting ClpC by immunoblotting) according to manufacturer’s instruction (Invitrogen). Native-PAGE—For separation of native soluble protein complexes the Tris borate-based PAGE system was used (30Sokolenko A. Lerbs-Mache S. Altschmied L. Herrmann R.G. Planta. 1998; 207: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Soluble proteins were isolated as previously described (31Pojidaeva E. Zinchenko V.V. Shestakov S.V. Sokolenko A. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 3991-3999Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: Synechococcus cells were lysed in 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.0), 0.5 m sucrose, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm ATPγS by vortexing with glass beads. Membranes were separated from the soluble protein fraction by centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 45 min. Soluble proteins were concentrated (10K Nanosep, Pall Life Sciences), and then loaded (60 μg of total protein) on large (20 × 20 cm), 6–13% gradient polyacrylamide gels. Samples were electrophoresed at 4 °C for 20 h at a constant current to ensure proteins reach their pore size limitation within the gel matrix as previously described (32Clarke A.K. Critchley C. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 2081-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Native molecular mass standards included ferritin (440 kDa monomer, 880 kDa dimer), urease (272 kDa trimer), and bovine serum albumin (66 kDa monomer, 132 kDa dimer). Native/Denaturing Two-dimensional PAGE—For the separation of individual Clp proteins from native complexes, a combination of native and denaturing PAGE was used as described (32Clarke A.K. Critchley C. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 2081-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). After separation of protein complexes by native PAGE, the gel lanes were excised and immersed in equilibration buffer (100 mm sucrose, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 40 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% LDS) for 30 min. The gel piece was then layered on top of a second dimension denaturing 15% linear polyacrylamide gel (20 cm × 20 cm) and electrophoresed for 16 h under constant current at 4 °C. Immunoblotting—After electrophoresis, separated proteins were transferred to supported nitrocellulose membranes using either the NuPAGE blotting system (Invitrogen) or Trans-Blot Cell (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s directions. Besides those made in this study, polyclonal antibodies specific for Synechococcus ClpP1–3, ClpC, or ClpX have been described elsewhere (21Schelin J. Lindmark F. Clarke A.K. Microbiol. 2002; 148: 2255-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26Clarke A.K. Schelin J. Porankiewicz J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 791-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 33Porankiewicz J. Clarke A.K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5111-5117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All primary antibodies were detected with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, anti-rabbit secondary antibody and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus, GE Healthcare). When necessary, chemiluminescent signals were detected and quantified from triplicate samples using the ChemiGenius Imaging system (Syngene) and associated software. Gel Filtration Chromatography—Separation of native soluble protein complexes by gel filtration chromatography was performed at 4 °C using a calibrated Superose 6 10/30 GL column (GE Healthcare) attached to an automated low pressure chromatography and fraction collection system (ÁKTA Prime, GE Healthcare). The column was pre-equilibrated in 25 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm ATP. The size range of each collected fraction was calculated from the separation of molecular mass standards thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (237 kDa), and aldolase (158 kDa). Soluble proteins were extracted from cultures as described above and concentrated (10K Nanosep, Pall Life Sciences) to 4 mg ml-1. Samples (2 mg of total protein) were then filtered (0.45 μm filter) and immediately applied to the size exclusion column. Proteins were separated at a flow rate of 0.3 ml min-1 and collected in 0.5-ml fractions. Each fraction was concentrated (10K Nanosep, Pall Life Sciences) to a volume of 60 μl, separated on denaturing 12% polyacrylamide Bis-Tris or 3–8% polyacrylamide Tris-acetate NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) and then analyzed by immunoblotting using the suite of Clp-protein specific antibodies. Immunoprecipitation—Soluble proteins from wild-type Synechococcus were isolated in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.0), 150 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.2% glycerol. Immunoprecipitations were performed using a kit (SeizeX, Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s directions, firstly to prepare columns for ClpC and ClpX antibodies as well as their respective pre-serums for controls. For each column 500 μg of purified IgG was used and 200–400 μg of total soluble protein was loaded. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature followed by overnight at 4 °C, the collected elute was concentrated (10K Nanosep, Pall Life Sciences), separated by denaturing-PAGE, and then analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for Synechococcus ClpC, ClpX, ClpR, ClpP1–3, ClpS1, and ClpS2. In all experiments when necessary, protein concentrations were determined using the BCA method (Pierce). Localization of Clp Proteins—The first characteristic we examined for the numerous Clp proteins in Synechococcus was their intracellular localization. Most unicellular cyanobacteria like Synechococcus contain an internal membrane system, which unlike the thylakoid membranes in plant chloroplasts consists of several concentric rings positioned just inside the cell membrane. Using our suite of antibodies, we examined the distribution of Clp proteins in soluble and internal membrane fractions extracted from wild-type Synechococcus and both ΔclpP mutants (Fig. 1). The quality of the fractionations was verified using antibodies to exclusively soluble (large subunit of Rubisco-LSU) or membrane (D1 protein of photosystem II) proteins. Localization analysis revealed that all Clp proteins in wild-type Synechococcus were primarily or exclusively localized in the soluble fraction (Fig. 1). ClpP2, ClpP3, ClpS1, and ClpX were found only in soluble protein fraction. In comparison, a minor proportion (20–40%) of ClpC, ClpP1, and ClpR was also detected in the membrane fraction, suggesting these proteins have a membrane-bound population in addition to their more abundant soluble one. The adaptor protein ClpS2 was also associated to the membrane, but it appeared more evenly distributed between the two fractions, indicating a relatively large membrane-bound population (Fig. 1). To better understand the distribution of Clp proteins within Synechococcus, the two viable knock-out strains, ΔclpP1 and ΔclpP2, were also included in the fraction study. As shown in Fig. 1, the loss of either ClpP1 or ClpP2 did not significantly change the localization of most Clp proteins. Inactivation of ClpP1 caused an almost complete down-regulation of ClpP2 but a 3-fold increase in ClpP3 and ClpR, consistent with earlier observations (21Schelin J. Lindmark F. Clarke A.K. Microbiol. 2002; 148: 2255-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note, however, that ClpP3 no longer was localized only in the soluble fraction, and traces (10%) were also present at the membrane. The amount of ClpR in the membrane was also greatly increased in abundance compared with wild type (Fig. 1), though had a similar distribution with 20% of the total in the membrane. The molecular chaperone ClpX was more abundant in ΔclpP1, again as previously reported (21Schelin J. Lindmark F. Clarke A.K. Microbiol. 2002; 148: 2255-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) but it remained exclusively a soluble protein. In comparison, ClpC levels remained relatively unchanged in both soluble and membrane fractions. Similarly, the levels and distribution of ClpS1 and ClpS2 did not change in the ΔclpP1 strain relative to the wild type (Fig. 1). In contrast to the ΔclpP1 strain, less dramatic alterations were observed in ΔclpP2. The most notable change was in ClpP1 distribution, in which a greater proportion of ClpP1 protein was associated to the membranes in the absence of soluble ClpP2 (Fig. 1). In comparison, levels of ClpP3 and ClpR remained relatively unchanged in the soluble fraction, although a small amount of both proteins was evident in the membrane fraction but much less so compared with that in the ΔclpP1 strain. Levels of ClpC and ClpX remained relatively unchanged in ΔclpP2 as previously described (21Schelin J. Lindmark F. Clarke A.K. Microbiol. 2002; 148: 2255-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), with a slight increase of ClpX protein. No significant change also occurred in the amount or distribution of the two ClpS adaptors in the absence of ClpP2. Soluble Proteolytic Core Complexes—In E. coli a single homogeneous Clp proteolytic core exists, consisting of a double heptameric ring of ClpP (11Wang J.M. Hartling J.A. Flanagan J.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Similarly, both algae and land plants have only one Clp proteolytic core in chloroplasts, but one which is composed of multiple ClpP and ClpR subunits (24Peltier J.B. Ytterberg J. Liberles D.A. Roepstorff P. van Wijk K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16318-16327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 25Majeran W. Friso G. van Wijk K.J. Vallon O. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 5558-5571Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Given the many ClpP/R proteins in cyanobacteria, we next analyzed soluble cell extracts from Synechococcus by native-PAGE and immunoblotting using the various Clp-specific antibodies to determine the number and composition of the Clp proteolytic core. As shown in Fig. 2, two different-sized complexes were found in the wild type. ClpP1 and ClpP2 were both found in a complex of ∼140 kDa while ClpP3 and ClpR were together in a single complex of ∼270 kDa. Given that each ClpP/R protein has a different mass (ClpP1, 22 kDa; ClpP2, 23.5 kDa; ClpP3, 21 kDa; ClpR, 28 kDa; 21Schelin J. Lindmark F. Clarke A.K. Microbiol. 2002; 148: 2255-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and taking into account the arrangement of the E. coli ClpP core, the 140-kDa complex appears likely to be a single mixed heptameric ring of ClpP1 and ClpP2, while the 270-kDa complex would be a core structure consisting of both ClpP3 and ClpR. In both the mutant strains the 270-kDa complex of ClpP3 and ClpR was essentially unaffected by the loss of either ClpP1 or ClpP2 (Fig. 2). In contrast, the 140-kDa ClpP1/P2 complex was completely absent in the ΔclpP1 strain, again inferring that the stability of ClpP2 relies on the presence of ClpP1. Similarly, although a complex containing ClpP1 was detectable in ΔclpP2, the signal was relatively diffuse, suggesting that the stable oligomerization of ClpP1 also needs ClpP2. To confirm the Clp protein composition of both the 140- and 270-kDa complexes, we next performed a second dimension under denaturing conditions with the native complexes extracted from wild-type cells (Fig. 3). There are several advantages of using such a native/denaturing-PAGE method. When proteins are in their native folded state the epitopes recognized by the respective antibodies are sometimes hidden and enclosed within the protein conformation. Therefore antibodies that usually recognize proteins with ease under denaturing electrophoretic conditions may be unable to recognize their target proteins under native gel conditions. Moreover, the technique in this case ensures each antibody recognizes the correct Clp protein because each has a different mass which is easily separated on large gels. As shown in Fig. 3, the 140-kDa complex was confirmed to be composed of ClpP1 and ClpP2, while the 270-kDa complex consisted of ClpP3 and ClpR. Because the smaller size of the 140-kDa ClpP1/P2 complex likely corresponded to a single heptameric ring, it appeared that a larger intact ClpP1/P2 proteolytic core was relatively unstable under the electrophoretic conditions used in our study. In general, protein complexes can become destabilized for a variety of reasons and if the interactions between subunits are not strong, certain conditions can cause them to break down more easily than others. Conditions in size exclusion chromatography are often milder than most PAGE systems, and so we used this method to separate the different soluble Clp proteolytic core complexes from wild-type cultures. Immunoblotting of the fractions obtained from gel filtration revealed that both ClpP3 and ClpR were eluted in the same size range, with the maximum amount of each protein in a fraction corresponding to 280 kDa (Fig. 4); a size for the ClpP3/R complex matching that obtained by native-PAGE. ClpP1 and ClpP2 also eluted together but in a fraction corresponding to a larger size (∼300 kDa) than that for ClpP3 and ClpR. This size of the ClpP1/P2 complex corresponded to double that observed by native-PAGE and which would be consistent with a double heptameric proteolytic core. In the case of ClpP1, additional protein was also observed in fractions of slightly smaller size, suggesting the possibility that some ClpP1 protein might oligomerize independently of ClpP2. However, in the ΔclpP2 strain, ClpP1 protein only eluted in fractions corresponding to ∼150 kDa (data not shown), similar to that observed by native-PAGE, again suggesting ClpP1 only forms a stable soluble core complex in association with ClpP2. HSP100 and Adaptor Proteins—In addition to the components of the proteolytic core complexes, the oligomeric state of the likely HSP100 chaperone partners of the Clp proteases in cyanobacteria (ClpC and ClpX) is unknown. In general, all members of the HSP100 family investigated to date form a single hexameric ring upon binding of ATP (12Grimaud R. Kessel M. Beuron F. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12476-12481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 34Maurizi M.R. Experientia. 1992; 48: 178-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) although many of these complexes are difficult to identify and appear unstable. To determine the oligomeric state of ClpC and ClpX in Synechococcus cells in vivo we separated soluble proteins by native-PAGE, and detected each Clp protein by immunoblottin"
https://openalex.org/W1989440019,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a blinding genetic disorder that is caused by the death of photoreceptors in the outer nuclear layer of the retina. To date, 39 different genetic loci have been associated with the disease, and 28 mutated genes have been identified. Despite the complexity of the underlying genetic basis for RP, the final common pathway is photoreceptor cell death via apoptosis.In this study, P23H and S334ter rhodopsin transgenic rat models of RP were used to test the neuroprotective effects of anti-apoptotic gene therapy. Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) carrying the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) or green fluorescent protein (GFP) were delivered subretinally into the eye of transgenic rat pups. Histological and functional measures were used to assess neuroprotection. XIAP is known to block apoptosis by inhibiting the action of caspases-3, -7 and -9. The results show that XIAP gene therapy provides long-term neuroprotection of photoreceptors at both structural and functional levels.Our gene therapy strategy targets the apoptotic cascade, which is the final common pathway in all forms of retinitis pigmentosa. This strategy holds great promise for the treatment of RP, as it allows for the broad protection of photoreceptors, regardless of the initial disease causing mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2030122054,"The MET proto-oncogene encodes for the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, a plasma membrane tyrosine kinase that is involved in melanocyte growth and melanoma development. In mouse melanoma cells, Met expression is increased by αMSH via the activation of the cAMP pathway. However, the mechanism by which cAMP regulates MET and the biological consequences of this increase were not known. In the present report, we show that αMSH regulates MET expression in both human melanocytes and mouse melanoma cells through a transcriptional mechanism that requires MITF. Furthermore, the adenovirus driven expression of MITF is sufficient to increase MET in melanoma cells. Functional analysis of the MET promoter allows us to identify an E-box motif conserved in both human and mouse promoter that mediates the effect of MITF. Interestingly, up-regulation of MET expression by cAMP leads to an exacerbated HGF signaling and allows HGF to protect melanocytes and melanoma cells from apoptosis. Thus, physiological stimuli or pathological events that would induce MITF expression may lead to increased MET expression thereby favoring melanoma survival.

The MET proto-oncogene encodes for the hepatocyte growth factor receptor, a plasma membrane tyrosine kinase involved in the pleiotropic physiological effects and tumorogenic processes of numerous tissues. Upon HGF binding, the intracellular part of b-subunit undergoes autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues creating a unique docking site for PI3K 3The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; αMSH, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; RT, reverse transcription; siRNA, small interfering RNA; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. or GRB2-SOS adaptors that allow the activation of ERK signaling pathways. The C-terminal part of MET also interacts with the non-receptor tyrosinase kinase Src, the transcription factor STAT3, and the adapters Shc and Gab1 (1Bolanos-Garcia V.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 276: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). All of these partner molecules allow MET to activate numerous signaling pathways and induce various physiological effects, including cell motility, cell growth, tubulogenesis, B-cell differentiation, and muscle and nervous system development (2van der Voort R. Taher T.E. Derksen P.W. Spaargaren M. van der Neut R. Pals S.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 2000; 79: 39-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of MET in growth and motility, often called “invasive growth” places MET at a center stage of tumor and metastasis development. Indeed, MET overexpression is very common in human cancer. Gain-of-function mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor have been identified in hereditary papillary renal carcinoma type I and in other sporadic tumors (3Danilkovitch-Miagkova A. Zbar B. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). HGF/MET signaling has is. Indeed, in transgenic mice over expressing HGF, melanosis in central nervous system and skin hyperpigmentation were observed (4Takayama H. La Rochelle W.J. Anver M. Bockman D.E. Merlino G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5866-5871Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). HGF can replace steel factor, the Kit ligand, to promote melanoblast growth and differentiation from neural crest explants (5Kos L. Aronzon A. Takayama H. Maina F. Ponzetto C. Merlino G. Pavan W. Pigment Cell Res. 1999; 12: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). MET is expressed on melanocytes and HGF is a growth factor for cultured melanocytes (6Matsumoto K. Tajima H. Nakamura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). HGF/MET has been shown to influence melanocyte transformation and the acquisition of the metastatic phenotype (7Otsuka T. Takayama H. Sharp R. Celli G. LaRochelle W.J. Bottaro D.P. Ellmore N. Vieira W. Owens J.W. Anver M. Merlino G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5157-5167PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, HGF appears to play a key role in the regulation of melanoma interaction with its microenvironment, since HGF controls E-cadherin (8Li G. Schaider H. Satyamoorthy K. Hanakawa Y. Hashimoto K. Herlyn M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8125-8135Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), CD44v6 (9Recio J.A. Merlino G.

Cancer. 1999; 82: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) expression in melanoma cells. It is noteworthy that transgenic mice overexpressing HGF in their skin develop melanoma upon UV radiation of the neonates thereby recapitulating the etiologic role of UV in human melanoma genesis (12Noonan F.P. Otsuka T. Bang S. Anver M.R. Merlino G. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3738-3743PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, overexpression of MET in human melanoma samples has been correlated with a poor clinical outcome (13Cruz J. Reis-Filho J.S. Silva P. Lopes J.M. Oncology. 2003; 65: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). HGF and MET play a key protective role against apoptosis (14Xiao G.H. Jeffers M. Bellacosa A. Mitsuuchi Y. Vande Woude G.F. Testa J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Indeed, HGF counters anoikis-induced apoptosis (15Zeng Q. Chen S. You Z. Yang F. Carey T.E. Saims D. Wang C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25203-25208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) that is particularly relevant when cancer cells enter the bloodstream to form distant metastasis. Interestingly, MET also favors cell survival, in a HGF-independent process, by interacting and sequestering FAS (16Wang X. DeFrances M.C. Dai Y. Pediaditakis P. Johnson C. Bell A. Michalopoulos G.K. Zarnegar R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 411-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In melanocytes or in melanoma cells, the role of HGF/MET in apoptosis has not been studied so far, although we have shown that HGF does not protect human melanocytes from Trail induced apoptosis (17Larribere L. Khaled M. Tartare-Deckert S. Busca R. Luciano F. Bille K. Valony G. Eychene A. Auberger P. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. Bertolotto C. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 1084-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Induction of melanocyte differentiation by αMSH and other cAMP-elevating agents, such as forskolin, has been extensively studied. During this process, the activation of the cAMP pathway induces the up-regulation of tyrosinase, Tyrp1, and DCT, the key enzymes in melanin synthesis, through a transcriptional mechanism involving MITF (18Widlund H.R. Fisher D.E. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3035-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), the master gene of melanocyte differentiation. Interestingly, in B16 melanoma cells, αMSH-induced differentiation is accompanied by an increase in Met expression (19Rusciano D. Lorenzoni P. Burger M.M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 623-630Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This observation suggests that upon differentiation, melanocytes may acquire exacerbate HGF-induced signaling and biological effects. In the present report, we studied the effect of αMSH- and cAMP-elevating agents, such as forskolin, on MET expression in both B16 melanoma cells and in normal human melanocytes. We demonstrated that the cAMP pathway regulates MET through MITF that binds and activates the MET promoter. Finally, we showed that up-regulation of MET expression by cAMP renders melanocytes responsive to the protective effects of HGF against apoptosis.

The samples (30 μg) were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and then exposed to the appropriate antibodies. The proteins were visualized with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Transfection, Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase (CAT), and Luciferase Assays—B16 melanoma cells were seeded in 6-well dishes, and 24 h later, the cells were co-transfected with 2 μg of promoter/CAT reporter construct, 0.2 μgof β-galactosidase expression vector, and 1 μg of empty pCDNA3 or pCDNA3-Mitf expression vector. The transfection was performed using 10 μl of Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) in 800 μl of Opti-MEM for 6 h. The transfection medium was then replaced with fresh medium and 48 h later the cells were extracted with reporter lysis buffer (Promega). The CAT assay was performed according manufacturer’s instructions. The β-galactosidase plasmid was co-transfected to monitor transfection efficiency and the CAT activity was corrected by the activity of β-galactosidase in each experiment. The luciferase assays were performed as described previously (24Bertolotto C. Bille K. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). αMSH Increases MET Expression in Both Human Melanocytes and Mouse Melanoma Cells—In B16F10 melanoma cells and in human melanocytes, we showed that αMSH and forskolin treatments, for 8 h, increased MET and MITF levels (Fig. 1, A and B). MET expression that reached a maximum after 8 h of forskolin was slightly delayed compared with the Mitf expression profile that peaked at 5 h (data not shown). Conversely, treatment of B16 melanoma cells with 0.1 μm HGF for 8 h led to a decrease in Met and Mitf expression (Fig. 1A). HGF has no significant effect on MITF and MET expression in human melanocytes (Fig. 1B). In human Mel501 melanoma cells, HGF also decreased MET expression but did not significantly affect MITF level (Fig. 1C). Forskolin or αMSH did not increase MITF or MET expression. The cAMP pathway does not seem to be functional in these cells. Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed a clear increase in Met messengers, 4 h after forskolin addition. The maximum stimulation was reached at 8 h and remained stable, at least until 24 h (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, cAMP-elevating agents, forskolin and αMSH, increased (4–6-fold) Met promoter activity in CAT reporter assay (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, HGF, which decreased Met expression at the protein level, slightly activated Met promoter. This set of observations indicates that cAMP increases MET expression through a transcriptional regulation. The correlation between MET and MITF up-regulation upon activation of the cAMP pathway suggests that MITF might be involved in this process. MITF Mediates the Effect of cAMP on MET and Is Sufficient to Regulate MET Expression—To verify this hypothesis we used specific siRNA to silence Mitf (20Busca R. Berra E. Gaggioli C. Khaled M. Bille K. Marchetti B. Thyss R. Fitsialos G. Larribere L. Bertolotto C. Virolle T. Barbry P. Pouyssegur J. Ponzio G. Ballotti R. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that Mitf messengers were dramatically decreased, in both basal and forskolin-stimulated conditions, after transfection with siMitf compared with scramble siRNA (siSc) (Fig. 3A). The messengers of tyrosinase, one of the best characterized Mitf target genes, were also decreased in both conditions by siMitf. Met mRNA were markedly increased by forskolin treatment in B16 cells transfected by siSc. However, upon transfection with siMitf the levels of Met mRNA were decreased, and the effect of forskolin was almost completely lost. At the protein level, Western blot analysis confirmed that siMitf blocked Mitf expression and, consequently, the effect of cAMP on tyrosinase and Met expression (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the basal levels of Met in B16 melanoma cells as well as in human melanoma, Mel501 (Fig. 3C) were dramatically reduced by MITF silencing, indicating that basal and cAMP-stimulated Met expression, in melanoma cells, required the presence of MITF. However, we still had to determine whether MITF was sufficient to up-regulate MET expression. For this purpose, human A375 melanoma cells, expressing a very low level of MITF, were infected with mouse Mitf encoding adenovirus. The levels of mouse and human MITF messengers, as well as the amounts of mRNA of several MITF target genes, were evaluated by Real-time PCR (Fig. 4A). Infection with Ad-Mitf increased the amount of mouse Mitf mRNA (4-fold), with a minor effect on human MITF mRNA (1.5-fold). BCL2 and HIF1α that are MITF target genes (27McGill G.G. Horstmann M. Widlund H.R. Du J. Motyckova G. Nishimura E.K. Lin Y.L. Ramaswamy S. Avery W. Ding H.F. Jordan S.A. Jackson I.J. Korsmeyer S.J. Golub T.R. Fisher D.E. Cell. 2002; 109: 707-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) were stimulated by Ad-Mitf infection. Although TYR is a well known MITF target gene, TYR mRNA was not induced by Ad-Mitf infection. In agreement with a previous report (21Gaggioli C. Busca R. Abbe P. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. Pigment Cell Res. 2003; 16: 374-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), this observation indicates that Mitf is required but not sufficient to regulate TYR expression. It is noteworthy that Mitf over expression markedly increased MET messengers. The same observation has been made at the protein level, in both human melanocytes and in A375 melanoma cells (Fig. 4, B and C), indicating that MITF is sufficient to up-regulate MET expression.FIGURE 4MITF is sufficient for MET expression in melanocytes and melanoma cells. A, real-time RT-PCR analysis was used to determine the levels of the human MITF, mouse Mitf, TYR, MET, and HIF1a transcripts in A375 human melanoma cells infected with an adenovirus encoding wild-type mouse Mitf (ad-Mitf). All results were normalized to samples infected with control adenovirus and SB34 values. The results are the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. B and C, A375 melanoma cells (B) or human normal melanocytes (C) infected with an adenovirus encoding mouse Mitf or an empty adenovirus were analyzed by Western blot using monoclonal antibodies against MET and MITF. ERK2 antibody was used as a loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MITF Stimulates the MET Promoter Activity through an E-box Motif Conserved in Both Mouse and in Human Sequences—Next, we performed a functional analysis of the Met promoter to identify the Mitf binding site. We used the 1.6-kb mouse Met promoter fused to CAT reporter gene (pMet) described by Seol et al. (25Seol D.W. Zarnegar R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1395: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This sequence shows a strong homology with the human MET promoter. The regions in black in Fig. 5. A display over 70% identity, and the proximal region contains 3 E-boxes that could bind Mitf (Fig. 5A). Transfection of a Mitf expression vector led to an 8-fold stimulation of the promoter activity (Fig. 5B). First, we deleted 1.2 kb from the 5′ end to remove E-box1. The new construct ΔpMet contains 400 bp of the Met promoter including 2 E-boxes. The response of this construct to Mitf was identical to that of the full-length promoter, indicating that Mitf responses were mediated by cis-acting elements found in this proximal fragment. We analyzed the effect of the individual mutation of the three E-boxes (–13/–19, –83/–89, and –234/–240) contained in this fragment. As expected from the results obtained with the deletion construct, mutation of E-box1 (–234/–240) did not affect Mitf effects. Similarly, mutation of E-box3 (–13/–19) did not impair Mitf effects. However, mutation of the E-box2 (–83/–89) dramatically reduced the activation of the Met promoter by Mitf. The same experiments using the human MET promoter upstream the luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 5C) confirmed that the MET promoter is stimulated by Mitf through the E-box2 that is perfectly conserved in both human and mouse promoters. Gel shift assay using a probe encompassing the E-box 2 showed an increased binding of nuclear proteins in extract from forskolin treated cells (Fig. 5D). This binding was displaced by an excess of cold E-box2 but not by the mutated E-box2. Furthermore, Mitf was identified as the nuclear protein bound to E-box2, since the E-box2 complex was shifted by antibody to Mitf. HGF Signaling and Anti-apoptotic Effects Are Exacerbated in Melanocytes and Melanoma Cells Exposed to Forskolin—Analysis of the HGF signaling pathway in B16 melanoma cells (Fig. 6A) showed that in basal conditions, the addition of HGF led to a slight, yet significant activation of Akt and Erk, monitored by Western blot analysis with phospho-Akt and phospho-Erk antibodies. After 8 h of exposure to forskolin, Met and Mitf expression markedly increased. In these conditions, the addition of HGF induced a stronger phosphorylation, and thus activation of Akt compared with basal conditions. Interestingly, after forskolin treatment, HGF led to a huge Erk phosphorylation. This high Erk activity is reflected by the Mitf shift from a doublet to a single upper band, corresponding to Erk phosphorylated Mitf on serine 73 (28Wu M. Hemesath T.J. Takemoto C.M. Horstmann M.A. Wells A.G. Price E.R. Fisher D.Z. Fisher D.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 301-312PubMed Google Scholar). Western blots with anti-Erk2 antibody were performed to ensure the even loading of each lane. Thus cAMP elevating agents increase Met expression and exacerbate Met signaling. Finally, we investigated the biological consequences of the increased Met expression and signaling. We studied the anti-apoptotic effect of HGF in normal human melanocytes and in B16 melanoma cells exposed or not to forskolin. An valuation of melanocyte viability showed that TRAIL induced death in normal human melanocytes (Fig. 6B). HGF was not able to protect normal human melanocytes from TRAIL-induced death. When the cells were first exposed to forskolin for 15 h, before treatment with TRAIL, we observed a slight increase in cell viability. In these cells, HGF completely blocked cell death induced by TRAIL. We also analyzed two classical apoptosis parameters, caspase 3 and PARP cleavage. Consistent with the survival data, in control B16 melanoma cells, staurosporine treatment led to a decrease in caspase 3 expression that reflected its cleavage and activation (Fig. 6C). As a consequence, we observed a cleavage of PARP monitored by an antibody specific for the cleaved form of PARP. In these cells HGF neither prevented caspase 3 nor PARP cleavage. Conversely, in cells pretreated with forskolin, to up-regulate Met, HGF markedly decreased the effect of staurosporine on caspase 3 activation and PARP cleavage. Taken together, these observations indicate that the up-regulation of MET by cAMP and MITF allows HGF to protect melanocytes and melanoma cells from apoptosis. In the present report, we demonstrated that cAMP elevating agents, αMSH and forskolin, increase MET expression in melanocyte and melanoma cells through a transcriptional mechanism that requires MITF. Furthermore, MITF overexpression is sufficient to increase HIF1A, BCL2, and MET levels but not tyrosinase expression. The tyrosinase gene, as well as the genes encoding other melanogenic proteins, appears to have a non-permissive chromatin conformation. Indeed, MITF needs to recruit the SWI/SNF enzymes that allow chromatin remodelling and melanogenic gene transcription (29de la Serna I.L. Ohkawa Y. Higashi C. Dutta C. Osias J. Kommajosyula N. Tachibana T. Imbalzano A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20233-20241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). HIF1A, BCL2, and MET, which do not require SWI/SNF enzymes, appear to be in an active genomic region. This suggests that overexpression of MITF in pathological conditions such as genomic amplification (30Garraway L.A. Widlund H.R. Rubin M.A. Getz G. Berger A.J. Ramaswamy S. Beroukhim R. Milner D.A. Granter S.R. Du J. Lee C. Wagner S.N. Li C. Golub T.R. Rimm D.L. Meyerson M.L. Fisher D.E. Sellers W.R. Nature. 2005; 436: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar) would be sufficient to induce MET over expression. However, one should not conclude that MET expression is controlled exclusively by MITF. Indeed, analysis of several melanoma cells lines did not show a tight correlation between MET and MITF expression. However, in melanoma cell lines expressing both MITF and MET, MITF silencing dramatically reduced MET expression. In melanoma cells, regulation of MET expression probably depends on ubiquitous transcription factors such as SP1 (31Zhang X. Li Y. Dai C. Yang J. Mundel P. Liu Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F82-F94Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) or AP1 (32Seol D.W. Chen Q. Zarnegar R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1132-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) that control MET expression in other cell systems. More recently, hypoxia, through HIF1A, has been shown to regulate MET expression in osteosarcoma cells (33Pennacchietti S. Michieli P. Galluzzo M. Mazzone M. Giordano S. Comoglio P.M. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 347-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Since we have shown that cAMP, through MITF, regulates HIF1A expression in melanoma, it was tempting to propose that HIF1A mediates the effect of MITF on MET. However, in non-hypoxic conditions, HIF1A silencing did not affect MET expression in melanoma cells (data not shown) suggesting that MITF acts directly on MET. This hypothesis is strengthened by studies on the MET promoter. Analysis of 5′ non-coding sequence of the mouse Met promoter showed a strong homology with human MET gene. In this region 3 E-boxes are conserved in both human and mouse sequences. Functional analysis of the mouse promoter showed a strong stimulation of its activity by Mitf that is mainly mediated by the E-box in position –83/–89 that binds Mitf. This E-box is conserved in the human MET gene and also mediates MITF responsiveness of the human MET promoter. Our data, identifying MITF as the transcription factor that mediates the effects of cAMP on MET expression in melanocytes and melanoma cells, agree with the recent paper by McGill et al. (34McGill G.G. Haq R. Nishimura E.K. Fisher D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10365-10373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) reporting that MITF mediated the up-regulation of MET by its own ligand, HGF. However, important differences should be highlighted between our data and that of the report mentioned above. In our hands, it has never been possible to show an increase in MET protein expression induced by HGF. On the contrary, we consistently observe an inhibition of MET at the protein level, with a slight increase in the MET messengers. Our observations are consistent with numerous reports demonstrating that HGF increases MET transcription through activation of the AP1 transcription factor (32Seol D.W. Chen Q. Zarnegar R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1132-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, at the same time HGF decreases MET protein level through a classical desensitization mechanism shared by membrane tyrosine kinase receptors (35Petrelli A. Gilestro G.F. Lanzardo S. Comoglio P.M. Migone N. Giordano S. Nature. 2002; 416: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Therefore, the results obtained by McGill (34McGill G.G. Haq R. Nishimura E.K. Fisher D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10365-10373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) do not seem to be consistent with the literature and might be explained by the use of an anti-Met antibody that recognizes RON, a closely related tyrosine kinase receptor, that is indeed up-regulated by HGF (36Chen Q. Seol D.W. Carr B. Zarnegar R. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 59-66PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of a gel shift assay, McGill et al. (34McGill G.G. Haq R. Nishimura E.K. Fisher D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10365-10373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) have identified E-box at position –300 in the human MET promoter as the sequence that binds MITF. According to a previous report from Comoglio’s group (33Pennacchietti S. Michieli P. Galluzzo M. Mazzone M. Giordano S. Comoglio P.M. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 347-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar), this E-box is located at +19/ +25 at the 5′ end of exon 1 and was recently shown to be the target of the Notch effector, HES-1 (37Stella M.C. Trusolino L. Pennacchietti S. Comoglio P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3982-3996Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the present report, the functional analysis of the mouse and human promoters shows that this E-box is not involved in the regulation of the MET promoter by MITF. Finally, it should be mentioned that we consistently observe that HGF does not stimulate the tyrosinase promoter or a MITF reporter gene composed of 3 M-box upstream the thymidine kinase promoter (data not shown). These observations clearly indicate that HGF does not activate MITF transcriptional activity. It should be noted that up-regulation of MET expression by cAMP has biological consequences in melanocytes and melanoma cells. First, we observe exacerbated HGF signaling in melanoma cells exposed to forskolin. In these cells, HGF is much more efficient in the activation of the PI3K/AKT and ERK pathways. Although HGF/MET signaling plays a key role in the control of cell migration, it also plays a crucial role in protection against apoptosis. Since apoptosis resistance is the hallmark of many tumors including melanomas, we have studied the effect of HGF on apoptosis in cells exposed or not to cAMP. As reported previously (17Larribere L. Khaled M. Tartare-Deckert S. Busca R. Luciano F. Bille K. Valony G. Eychene A. Auberger P. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. Bertolotto C. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 1084-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), HGF is not able to protect human melanocytes from TRAIL induced apoptosis. However, in melanocytes and melanoma cells exposed to forskolin, the increase in MET expression allows HGF (i) to exert a pro-survival effect and (ii) to activate more strongly PI3 kinase and ERK pathways compared with cells not exposed to forskolin. Although MET signaling involves Src kinase, PLCγ (38Kochhar K.S. Iyer A.P. Cancer Lett. 1996; 104: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or NFκB (39Muller M. Morotti A. Ponzetto C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1060-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), the anti-apoptotic function of MET is mediated by ERK and PI3K pathways (14Xiao G.H. Jeffers M. Bellacosa A. Mitsuuchi Y. Vande Woude G.F. Testa J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Thus, the robust activation of these two pathways by HGF in melanocytes and melanoma cells exposed to forskolin might account for the anti-apoptotic effect of HGF in these cells (Fig. 7). Interestingly, the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 (PTPN11) is required for MET signaling to ERK and PI3K pathways and mutations in SHP2 lead to generalized lentigines found in the LEOPARD syndrome. These observations support the role of MET in melanocyte biology. The role of HGF/MET in the survival of melanoma cells has not been extensively studied and as far as we know this the first report demonstrating that HGF/MET can protect melanoma cells from apoptosis. This effect of the HGF/MET cascade might be particularly important for the pro survival effects provided by HGF derived from the stromal environment of the tumor (40Kankuri E. Cholujova D. Comajova M. Vaheri A. Bizik J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9914-9922Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, at the beginning of the invasive process, melanoma cells enter the bloodstream to disseminate and form distant metastasis. Up-regulation of MET could favor melanoma survival in anoikis conditions and allow transient growth in an anchorage-independent manner. These effects of MET are not necessarilly dependent on HGF, since MET interacts with other membrane receptors with adhesive functions such as CD44 and integrin (41Corso S. Comoglio P.M. Giordano S. Trends Mol. Med. 2005; 11: 284-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). MET can also block apoptosis through its direct interaction with Fas (16Wang X. DeFrances M.C. Dai Y. Pediaditakis P. Johnson C. Bell A. Michalopoulos G.K. Zarnegar R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 411-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and melanoma cells are particularly resistant to Fas ligand-induced apoptosis. Since melanoma cells are more sensitive to TRAIL, it would be interesting to investigate the possible interaction of MET with TRAIL receptors (DR4, DR5). The up-regulation of MET by the activation of the cAMP pathway is particularly relevant in the case of solar irradiation. Indeed, UV radiations are known to increase the production of αMSH and stimulate the synthesis of pro-inflammatory agents such as prostaglandins. Both αMSH and prostaglandins through G-protein coupled receptor activate the cAMP and could stimulate MET expression as a response to solar exposure or acute inflammation. Taken together the data presented in this report shows that the up-regulation of MITF expression by cAMP or by other physiological or pathological stimuli would lead to increased expression of MET thereby favoring melanoma survival. These observations strengthen the roles of MITF and MET in melanoma development. We are grateful to Dr. Seol for pMet-Cat construct."

High expression levels of the neurotrophin receptor TrkB and its ligands in neuroblastomas are associated with an unfavorable outcome. We report here that NTRK2, which encodes the TrkB receptor tyrosine kinase, is an oxygen-regulated gene, whose expression is stimulated by the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). TrkB mRNA and protein levels were elevated nearly 30-fold in neuroblastoma-derived Kelly cells in hypoxia (1% O2) versus normoxia (21% O2). A luciferase reporter construct containing ≈2.1 kilobases of the human TrkB promoter was activated about 6-fold both in hypoxia and after stimulation with the hypoxia mimetic 2,2′-dipyridyl (100 μm) at 21% O2. Luciferase activity in the presence of 2,2′-dipyridyl was reduced significantly upon small interfering RNA knockdown of HIF-1α but not of HIF-2α. Accordingly, hypoxia failed to stimulate the TrkB promoter in mouse embryonic fibroblasts that lacked HIF-1α. The hypoxia-responsive promoter region could be mapped to three HIF-1 binding elements that were located between -923 and -879 bp relative to the transcription start site. The migration of cultured neuroblastoma cells was increased ∼2-fold upon incubation at 1 versus 21% O2. This effect of hypoxia was abrogated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor K252a (200 nm). Our findings indicate that transcription of the NTRK2 gene is stimulated at low oxygen tension through a HIF-1-dependent mechanism.

Neurotrophin signaling through the Trk receptors controls diverse processes in the developing and adult nervous system including cell survival and proliferation, fate determination of neural progenitors, axon and dendrite growth, as well as pattern formation (reviewed in Ref. 8Bibel M. Barde Y.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2919-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Of the neurotrophin family, the BDNF-TrkB system has been identified as a major regulator of excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity, i.e. during long-term potentiation and memory storage in the hippocampus (9Patterson S.L. Grover L.M. Schwartzkroin P.A. Bothwell M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Activation of TrkB by its ligands results in the phosphorylation of several tyrosine residues and stimulation of signaling mechanisms that include the Shc-Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, phospholipase Cγ-Ca2+, and protein kinase C pathways (reviewed in Ref. 10Arevalo J.C. Wu S.H. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 1523-1537Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In addition to the full-length TrkB receptor, which has a molecular mass of ∼145 kDa (gp145TrkB), additional isoforms with truncated intracellular tyrosine kinase domains exist (11Klein R. Conway D.

These shorter TrkB variants (gp95TrkB) presumably act as dominant-negative inhibitors of the full-length TrkB protein and/or may function as scavenger receptors that bind to BDNF and NT-4/5 without having intrinsic biological activities (12Biffo S.

Neuroblastomas, which can develop from sympathetic progenitor cells of the neural crest, belong to the most common childhood malignancies (reviewed in Ref. 17Brodeur G.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). Remarkably, TrkB and its preferred ligands, BDNF and NT-4/5, are highly expressed in aggressive neuroblastomas with unfavorable outcome (18Nakagawara A. Azar C.G. Scavarda N.J. Brodeur G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 19Aoyama M. Asai K. Shishikura T. Kawamoto T. Miyachi T. Yokoi T. Togari H. Wada Y. Kato T. Nakagawara A. Cancer Lett. 2001; 164: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Acting in an autocrine/paracrine manner, the BDNF-TrkB pathway may enhance the invasiveness of tumor cells (18Nakagawara A.

Life Sci. 2006; 63: 755-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), detailed knowledge of the mechanisms that control its expression in neuroblastoma cells is desirable. Local hypoxia due to an imbalance between oxygen supply to the neoplastic tissue and O2 consumption by the tumor cells is a common situation in neuroblastomas and other malignancies (reviewed in Ref. 25Vaupel P. Harrison L. Oncologist. 2004; 9: 4-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). As a precondition for tumor progression, hypoxia triggers the formation of new blood vessels through the synthesis and release of vascular growth factors and their cognate receptors. Recent findings indicate that hypoxia can also modify gene expression in neuroblastoma cells toward a more immature and aggressive phenotype (26Jogi A. Ora I. Nilsson H. Lindeheim A. Makino Y. Poellinger L. Axelson H. Pahlman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7021-7026Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 27Jogi A. Vallon-Christersson J. Holmquist L. Axelson H. Borg A. Pahlman S. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 295: 469-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms that convey hypoxia-induced de-differentiation of neuroblastoma cells are poorly understood. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) exerts an important function in the genomic control at low oxygen tension. HIF-1 is a heterodimeric transcription factor consisting of an oxygen-regulated α-subunit and the constitutively expressed β-subunit (28Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5105) Google Scholar). At normoxia the HIF-1α protein is post-translationally hydroxylated at two proline residues (29Masson N. Willam C. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5197-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar) and, following ubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (30Ivan M. Kondo K.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, our sequence analysis of the promoter of the TrkB encoding gene, NTRK2, revealed several putative binding sites for HIF-1 in regulatory important regions. Furthermore, enhanced expression of TrkB in response to ischemic brain injury, a condition that is intimately linked with tissue hypoxia, has been reported (33Narumiya S. Ohno M. Tanaka N. Yamano T. Shimada M. Brain Res. 1998; 797: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These evidences prompted us to hypothesize that TrkB expression may be controlled by oxygen tension. We demonstrate here that transcription of the TrkB encoding gene, NTRK2, is indeed stimulated in hypoxia through a mechanism that involves HIF-1. Enhanced expression of TrkB could play a role in the de-differentiation of neuroblastoma cells at low oxygen tension. Cell Culture—Human neuroblastoma-derived Kelly cells (ACC 355), U2OS osteosarcoma cells (ATCC HTB-96), and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (ACC 305), were obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ) and the American Type Culture Collection, respectively. A HIF-1α-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line (MEF) was the kind gift of Roland H. Wenger (34Ryan H.E. Poloni M. McNulty W. Elson D. Gassmann M. Arbeit J.M. Johnson R.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4010-4015PubMed Google Scholar). Kelly cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, HEK293, U2OS, and MEF cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium nutrient (PAA Laboratories, Pasching, Austria), each supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany), 100 IU/ml penicillin, 1% glutamate, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen). The cells were expanded until 40% confluency at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 21% O2, 5% CO2. Hypoxic conditions were established by placing the cells in a tissue culture incubator (Binder GmbH, Tuttlingen, Germany) at reduced oxygen content (1% O2). In some experiments the iron chelator and HIF prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor 2,2′-dipyridyl (DP, Sigma) was added at 21% O2 to a final concentration of 100 μm. Reporter Gene Assays—Kelly cells were grown to ∼50% confluency in 6-well dishes, the MEF cells were transfected at 80% confluency in 24-well tissue culture plates. Nine hundred nanograms of the reporter constructs and 100 ng of a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven β-galactosidase plasmid were transiently co-transfected by the use of FuGENE 6® reagent (3 μl per well) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Roche Diagnostics). Transfection with the empty pGL3basic vector (Promega) served as a control. The transfected cells were incubated for 16 h either at 1 or 21% O2 prior to lysis in Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega). Luciferase activities were measured in a luminometer (Microlite TLX1, MGM Instruments, Hamden, CT) and β-galactosidase activities were determined spectrophotometrically (Beckman DU 540 spectrophotometer, Beckman Coulter GmbH, Krefeld, Germany) as described (35Wagner K.D. Wagner N. Schley G. Theres H. Scholz H. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 305: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 36Dame C. Kirschner K.M. Bartz K.V. Wallach T. Hussels C.S. Scholz H. Blood. 2006; 107: 4282-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Data are presented as relative light units normalized to β-galactosidase activities for the control of transfection efficiencies. siRNAs and Transfection Procedures—The use of siRNAs for the knockdown of HIF-α transcription factors in cultured cells has been described in detail elsewhere (37Warnecke C. Zaborowska Z. Kurreck J. Erdmann V.A. Frei U. Wiesener M. Eckardt K.U. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1462-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). HIF-α siRNAs with the following sequences were synthesized by Xeragon/Qiagen (Koöln, Germany): HIF-1α, 5′-GCCACUUCGAAGUAGUGCUdTdT-3′ (sense) targeting 1378 to 1398 bp of the human HIF-1α mRNA (NCBI accession number AF304431.1); and HIF-2α, 5′-GCGACAGCUGGAGUAUGAAdTdT-3′ (sense), targeting 2274 to 2294 bp of the human HIF-2α mRNA (NCBI accession number NM_001430.1). As a negative control, we used siRNA targeting the firefly luciferase coding sequence of the pGL2basic vector (38Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar): 5′-CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGAdTdT-3′ (sense); synthesis by Eurogentec, Brussels, Belgium. Kelly cells were co-transfected at 40–50% confluency in 24-well plates with the TrkB promoter-reporter construct pGL3-TrkB-2107 (see below) and a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven β-galactosidase plasmid as described above. On the next day, the cells were transfected with the siRNAs (200 nm final concentration) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the supplier’s protocol. Twenty-four hours after siRNA transfection, the cells were stimulated with the hypoxia-mimetic DP (100 μm) for 16 h. Reverse Transcription Real Time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells by the use of TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed with 2 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT) primers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Two percent of the volumes of the reaction products were used for quantitative real time PCR amplification with SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The PCRs were carried out on a GeneAmp5700 thermocycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) under the following conditions (45 cycles): DNA denaturation (15 s) at 94 °C, primer annealing (15 s) and extension of double-stranded DNA at 60 °C (60 s), detection of SYBR Green fluorescence at 77 °C (30 s). The PCR primers used for the amplification reactions are listed in Table 1. The Ct values for the genes of interest were subtracted from the Ct values for β-actin to obtain δCt values. Differences in transcript levels between normoxic (21% O2) and hypoxic (1% O2) or DP-treated cells were calculated as δCt(normoxia) - δCt(hypoxia/DP). -Fold increases in mRNA levels were obtained according to 2δδCt.TABLE 1Sequence of the oligonucleotides used for real time PCRGeneNCBI accession No.SequenceHuman TrkBQ16620Forward: 5′-CCTAACCTCACTGTGGAGGAA-3′Reverse: 5′-ATCTGCTTCCCACTGTCATCG-3′Human TrkABC062580Forward: 5′-CATTTCACTCCTCGGCTCAGTC-3′Reverse: 5′-CAGATTTCATCACCGTGGCTG-3′Human TrkCBC013693Forward: 5′-GCTCTACACCGGACTTCAAAAGC-3′Reverse: 5′-TGCAGTAGAGGTTCTGGCTGTTG-3′Human p75NTRBC052977Forward: 5′-TGGGCAGGACCTCAGAGTCC-3′Reverse: 5′-TTCCTCCCTCTGAGTCTCTG-3′Human β-actinNM_001101Forward: 5′-AGAAAATCTGGCACCACACC-3′Reverse: 5′-GCCATCTCTAGCTCGAAGTC-3′ Open table in a new tab Plasmids—Cloning of the upstream region of the human gene, NTRK2, which encodes the TrkB neurotrophin receptor (NCBI accession number AL390777) from a bacterial artificial chromosome (clone RP11–301F14) has been described previously (16Wagner N. Wagner K.D. Theres H. Englert C. Schedl A. Scholz H. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2631-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The plasmid pGL3-TrkB-2107 contained a ≈2.1-kilobase pair (kbp) SacI restriction fragment of NTRK2 extending from -2107 to +104 bp relative to the transcription start point in the SacI site of the pGL3basic reporter vector (Promega). This plasmid was identical to the previously described pTrkBprom construct (16Wagner N. Wagner K.D. Theres H. Englert C. Schedl A. Scholz H. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2631-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) except that it contained the pGL3basic vector backbone instead of the pGL2basic vector. A 5′-truncated TrkB promoter construct (-969 bp to +104 bp) was obtained by restriction digest of pGL3-TrkB-2107 with KpnI and designated pGL3-TrkB-969. Another truncation at the 5′-end was generated by PCR amplification by the use of Pwo polymerase (peQlab, Erlangen, Germany) and the following oligonucleotides: 5′-ATCGGTACCTGTGAACTCCCACATGCTGCTGCTG-3′ (forward), 5′-GTTCCATCTTCCAGCGGATA-3′ (reverse). The forward primer contained a suffixed KpnI restriction site allowing ligation of the amplicon into the KpnI-SacI sites of the pGL3basic plasmid. The resulting construct, which comprised the TrkB promoter from -878 to +104 bp, was designated pGL3-TrkB-878. A PCR-based protocol was applied to introduce site-directed mutations into three identified HIF-1-binding elements (HREs) that were located between -923 bp and -879 bp in the promoter of the TrkB gene. For this purpose the following PCR primers (mutant nucleotides underlined) were used with pGL3-TrkB-969 serving as DNA template: 5′-ATAGAGCTCAGGAGCTCGGCGAGGCCAGGA-3′ (forward), 5′-GTTCCATCTTCCAGCGGATA-3′ (reverse), 5′-GATGTGTGCTTATGTGCGCGCTTATGTGAAC-3′ (double mutant forward), 5′-GTTCACATAAGCGCGCACATAAGCACACATC-3′ (double mutant reverse). The resulting mutant plasmid pGL3-TrkB-ΔHRE2/3 served as template for a third PCR mutation: 5′-TATGAGCTCGGCGGTGATCCTTGGTTACCA-3′ (forward), 5′-GTTCCATCTTCCAGCGGATA-3′ (reverse), 5′-CGCACGCGATGTCATGTCTAC-3′ (mutant forward), 5′-GTAGACATGACACGCGTGCG-3′ (mutant reverse). The amplified DNA was ligated into the KpnI-SacI sites of the pGL3basic plasmid yielding pGL3-TrkB-ΔHRE1/2/3. The correct identity of the amplified DNA was assessed by automated sequencing (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). SDS-PAGE—Membrane fractions from snap-frozen cultures of subconfluent Kelly cells that had been grown for 16 h either at 1 or 21% O2 were prepared as described previously (39Baltensperger K. Porzig H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10151-10159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and separated on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences) by the use of a semidry blotting apparatus (Bio-Rad). Nonspecific binding activity was reduced by incubating the membranes for 60 min at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline, 5% nonfat milk (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), 0.05% Tween 20 (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany). Incubation with primary antibodies was performed overnight at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline, 2.5% nonfat milk, 0.05% Tween 20 as described in detail elsewhere (40Wagner K.D. Wagner N. Sukhatme V.P. Scholz H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 1188-1196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The TrkB antibody was detected with a peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse-IgG (catalog number sc-2031, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:7,500 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline, 5% nonfat milk, 0.05% Tween 20), and the reaction products were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). The following primary antibodies were used at the indicated dilutions (in phosphate-buffered saline, 5% nonfat milk, 0.05% Tween 20): mouse monoclonal anti-TrkB antibody (catalog number H00004915-M01, Abnova Corp., Taipei, Taiwan, 1:500), rabbit polyclonal anti-HIF-1α antibody (catalog number 100-449, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, 1:1,000), rabbit polyclonal anti-HIF-2α antibody (catalog number 100-122, Novus Biologicals, 1:1,000), and mouse monoclonal antibody against β-actin (catalog number MAB1501R, Chemicon, 1:1,000). The anti-β-actin antibody was applied after stripping of the membranes with 0.2 m NaOH at room temperature for 6 min to detect differences in protein loading. Immunocytochemistry—Immunostaining of acetone:methanol (3:2, v/v) fixed Kelly cells was performed with the following antibodies in ready-to-use diluent (catalog number 00–3218, Zymed Laboratories Inc., Berlin, Germany): goat polyclonal anti-TrkB antibody (catalog number sc-20542, Lot# F1505, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:75 dilution) and polyclonal donkey Cy3-conjugated anti-goat IgG as secondary antibody. Incubation of the cells with normal goat serum was performed as a negative control. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out with nuclear extracts from Kelly cells, which had been grown on 10-cm dishes for 5 h at 1 or 21% O2, respectively. Nuclear extract preparation and DNA binding reaction were performed according to Ref. 41Frede S. Freitag P. Otto T. Heilmaier C. Fandrey J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4690-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar. In brief, the oligonucleotides (see below) were 5′-end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (7,000 Ci/mmol, catalog number 35020, ICN Biochemicals, Eschwege, Germany) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min with 5 μg of nuclear extract in a 1× reaction buffer consisting of: 12 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg of denatured calf thymus DNA (Sigma). The following double-stranded oligonucleotides with the putative HIF-1 binding elements in the TrkB promoter were used: 5′-GACACACACACGCACGCGCGTGCATGTCTA-3′ (TrkB-HRE1), 5′-GACACACAAAAACACGCGAAAACATGTCTA-3′ (TrkB-HRE1mut), 5′-GATGTGTGCGTGTGTGCGCGCGTGTGTGAA-3′ (TrkB-HRE2/3), 5′-GATGTGTGAAAATGTGCGCGAAAATGTGAA-3′ (TrkB-HRE2/3mut). For the supershift experiments 1 μg of a mouse monoclonal anti-HIF-1α antibody (catalog number 610958, BD Biosciences) was added to the binding reactions overnight at 4 °C. The samples were run for 4 h on a non-denaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C. The dried gels (gel dryer, model 583, Bio-Rad) were exposed to an x-ray film for 1 h. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay (ChIP)—ChIP assays were carried out with a commercial kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Hamburg, Germany) according to our previously described protocol (36Dame C. Kirschner K.M. Bartz K.V. Wallach T. Hussels C.S. Scholz H. Blood. 2006; 107: 4282-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 42Kirschner K.M. Wagner N. Wagner K.D. Wellmann S. Scholz H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31930-31939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In brief, Kelly cells were incubated for 5 h at 1 or 21% O2, respectively. Cross-linking of DNA-bound protein was achieved by 10 min incubation of the cells in a 1% formaldehyde solution at room temperature. After quenching with 125 mm glycine the cell lysates were ultrasonicated yielding an average DNA fragment size of 200 to 600 bp. Immunoprecipitations were performed overnight at 4 °C using the following antibodies: mouse monoclonal anti-HIF-1α antibody (catalog number 610958, BD Biosciences), rabbit polyclonal anti-HIF-1α antibody (catalog number 100–449, Novus Biologicals), and rabbit polyclonal anti-acetylhistone H3 antibody (catalog number 06-599, Upstate Biotechnology). Incubation with normal mouse IgG served as a negative control. The antibody-bound proteins were precipitated for 3 h at 4 °C with DNA-blocked protein A/G-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology). After several washes in low and high salt buffer, the DNA was eluted from the agarose beads, extracted by phenol:chloroform treatment, and precipitated in 100% ethanol. The DNA pellet was resuspended in 30 μl of TE buffer, and 1/10 volume was taken for PCR amplification of the human TrkB promoter by the use of the following primers: 5′-GAAGCAGACAGCAGCAGCATGTG-3′ (forward), 5′-CGCGATTGTAGAAGAGACTGTGGT-3′ (reverse). The PCR (32 cycles) was carried out on a thermocycler (GeneAmp2400, Applied Biosystems) with DNA denaturation at 95 °C, primer annealing at 58 °C, and primer extension at 72 °C, each step lasting 30 s. The amplicons were separated on a 1.2% agarose gel and visualized with SYBR Safe® DNA stain (Invitrogen). Cell Migration Assay—Assays were performed on polycarbonate filters with 8-μm pore size following the manufacturer’s instructions (BioCoat® Cell Culture Inserts, BD Biosciences). Briefly, Kelly cells that had been incubated for 24 h either at 21 (controls) or 1% O2 to stimulate TrkB expression were detached from the tissue culture dishes with Accutase (catalog number L11–007, PAA). The cells were seeded in serum-free medium at 77,000 cells per well in the upper compartment of the transwell chambers. Tissue culture medium with or without supplementation of 50 ng/ml human BDNF (catalog number B-250, Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) was added to the lower compartments. In some experiments, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor K252a (catalog number 420298, Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) was given to the cells at a final concentration of 200 nm. Cell migration was assessed in a 21% O2, 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. After 27 h of incubation, the migrated cells were stained with toluidine blue (1% solution in 1% sodium tetraborate, Morphisto GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany) on the lower side of the membranes. The cells were counted under the microscope (Axiovert S100, Carl Zeiss AG, Goöttingen, Germany) at ×100 magnification. The migration assays were carried out in triplicate and at least three independent experiments were performed for each condition. Statistics—If not otherwise indicated all values are presented as mean ± S.D. Student’s paired t test was applied to reveal statistical significances. p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. The Kelly neuroblastoma cell line was used to explore whether expression of the different neurotrophin receptors is sensitive to changes in local oxygen tension. Kelly cells were chosen because they have previously been used as a model to study the molecular mechanisms of oxygen-regulated gene expression (43Stolze I. Berchner-Pfannschmidt U. Freitag P. Wotzlaw C. Rossler J. Frede S. Acker H. Fandrey J. Blood. 2002; 100: 2623-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Furthermore, high expression levels of the TrkB neurotrophin receptor and its cognate ligands, BDNF and NT-4/5, in neuroblastomas are associated with aggressive tumor growth (18Nakagawara A. Azar C.G. Scavarda N.J. Brodeur G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) G"
https://openalex.org/W1972095476,"Genome tiling microarray studies have consistently documented rich transcriptional activity beyond the annotated genes. However, systematic characterization and transcriptional profiling of the putative novel transcripts on the genome scale are still lacking. We report here the identification of 25,352 and 27,744 transcriptionally active regions (TARs) not encoded by annotated exons in the rice (Oryza. sativa) subspecies japonica and indica, respectively. The non-exonic TARs account for approximately two thirds of the total TARs detected by tiling arrays and represent transcripts likely conserved between japonica and indica. Transcription of 21,018 (83%) japonica non-exonic TARs was verified through expression profiling in 10 tissue types using a re-array in which annotated genes and TARs were each represented by five independent probes. Subsequent analyses indicate that about 80% of the japonica TARs that were not assigned to annotated exons can be assigned to various putatively functional or structural elements of the rice genome, including splice variants, uncharacterized portions of incompletely annotated genes, antisense transcripts, duplicated gene fragments, and potential non-coding RNAs. These results provide a systematic characterization of non-exonic transcripts in rice and thus expand the current view of the complexity and dynamics of the rice transcriptome."
https://openalex.org/W2093673377,"The carboxyamidated wFwLL peptide was used as a core ligand to probe the structural basis for agonism versus inverse agonism in the constitutively active ghrelin receptor. In the ligand, an switch could be built at the N terminus, as exemplified by AwFwLL, which functioned as a high potency agonist, whereas KwFwLL was an equally high potency inverse agonist. The wFw-containing peptides, agonists as well as inverse agonists, were affected by receptor mutations covering the whole main ligand-binding pocket with key interaction sites being an aromatic cluster in transmembrane (TM)-VI and -VII and residues on the opposing face of TM-III. Gain-of-function in respect of either increased agonist or inverse agonist potency or swap between high potency versions of these properties was obtained by substitutions at a number of positions covering a broad area of the binding pocket on TM-III, -IV, and -V. However, in particular, space-generating substitutions at position III:04 shifted the of the ligands from inverse agonism toward agonism, whereas similar substitutions at position III: 08, one helical turn below, shifted the from agonism toward inverse agonism. It is suggested that the relative position of the ligand in the binding pocket between this efficacy shift region on TM-III and the opposing aromatic cluster on TM-VI and TM-VII leads either to agonism, i.e. in a superficial binding mode, or it leads to inverse agonism, i.e. in a more profound binding mode. This relationship between different binding modes and opposite is in accordance with the Global Toggle Switch model for 7TM receptor activation."

Bovine heart mitochondrial matrix preparations were prepared free from contamination by proteins from other subcellular components and, using a combination of radioisotopic labeling and mass spectrometry, were shown to contain all of the enzymes required for the extension of a 2-carbon precursor by malonyl moieties to saturated acyl-ACP thioesters containing up to 14 carbon atoms. A major product was octanoyl-ACP and, in the presence of the apo-H-protein of the glycine cleavage complex, the newly synthesized octanoyl moieties were translocated to the lipoylation site on the acceptor protein. These studies demonstrate that one of the functions of the de novo fatty acid biosynthetic pathway in mammalian mitochondria is to provide the octanoyl precursor required for the essential protein lipoylation pathway.

These studies demonstrate that one of the functions of the de novo fatty acid biosynthetic pathway in mammalian mitochondria is to provide the octanoyl precursor required for the essential protein lipoylation pathway. Lipoic acid was discovered in the early 1950s, through a collaboration between Lester Reed and Eli Lilly and Company (1Reed L.J. De Busk B.G. Gunsalus I.C. Hornberger Jr., C.S. Science. 1951; 114: 93-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and initially was thought to represent a new member of the B vitamin family. Thirty years elapsed before evidence was obtained indicating that lipoic acid was not a vitamin for animals and that radiolabel from acetate and octanoate could be incorporated into lipoic acid, most likely in the liver (2Dupre S. Spoto G. Matarese R.M. Orlando M. Cavallini D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 202: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which lipoic acid is synthesized in animals has yet to be elucidated. In addition to performing an important role as an antioxidant in the free acid form (3Hagen T.M. Liu J. Lykkesfeldt J. Wehr C.M. Ingersoll R.T. Vinarsky V. Bartholomew J.C. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1870-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), lipoyl moieties are essential cofactors for several mitochondrial multienzyme complexes that play critical roles in energy metabolism, including the α-ketoacid dehydrogenases and the glycine cleavage system. In each of these enzyme complexes, lipoyl moieties are covalently attached via an amide bond to the ɛ-amino group of specific lysine residues (4Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Studies in prokaryotes have established that lipoyl moieties can be derived either from endogenous lipoic acid, via a lipoyl-AMP intermediate formed by the lipoyl ligase, LplA (5Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16091-16100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or from octanoyl-ACP, 2The abbreviations used are: ACP, acyl carrier protein; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. an intermediate in fatty acid synthesis, by the insertion of sulfur atoms at C-6 and C-8 in a reaction catalyzed by lipoic acid synthase, LipA (6Morris T.W.

Homologs of LplA, LipA, and LipB have been identified in eukaryotes (9Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2001; 42: 650-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), suggesting that the same two pathways for production of lipoyl moieties may be operative in mitochondria. Recently, strong evidence has been obtained for the existence of a mitochondrial pathway for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis in both fungi (12Schweizer E. Hofmann J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 501-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and plants (13Gueguen V. Macherel D. Jaquinod M. Douce R. Bourguignon J. J. Biol.

These freestanding, type II enzymes are quite distinct from the type I multifunctional polypeptide fatty acid synthase system found in the cytosol. However, direct evidence for the functioning of a mitochondrial pathway for fatty acid synthesis in animals is lacking. The objectives of this study were to determine whether the entire pathway could be reconstituted in mitochondrial extracts, to identify the products of the pathway, and to ascertain whether the pathway can provide the octanoyl precursor required for the de novo synthesis of lipoyl moieties. We chose to use bovine heart for these experiments because this organ is readily obtainable, it contains little or no cytosolic fatty acid synthase and is rich in mitochondria. Isolation, Purification, and Subfractionation of Bovine Heart Mitochondria—Crude mitochondria were prepared from ∼0.5 kg of beef heart essentially as described earlier (18Smith A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 81-86Crossref Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The crude mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm Tris succinate (pH 7.8), 0.2 mm EDTA containing protease inhibitors, washed twice by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, resuspended in the same medium without protease inhibitors, and purified by centrifugation for 3 h at 4 °C on an OptiPrep density gradient (19–27%). The layer containing purified mitochondria was diluted with 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm Tris succinate (pH 7.8) and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 10 min. The mitochondrial pellet was washed by resuspension and centrifugation and finally resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm Tris succinate (pH 7.8), then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. As required, mitochondria were thawed, diluted with 40 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol to a protein concentration of ∼5 mg/ml and lysed by subjecting to 5 freeze-thaw cycles; conditions were optimized by monitoring the release of citrate synthase. The extract was centrifuged at 230,000 × g for 28 min to pellet mitochondrial membranes and the supernatant containing matrix proteins was concentrated on a Vivaspin 5,000 Mr cut-off device to ∼27 mg/ml. Protein concentration was estimated by the BCA™ Protein Assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Characterization of Mitochondrial Preparations Using Marker Proteins—1/170,000, 1/103,000, and 1/26,000 of final volumes of nuclei-free homogenate, gradient purified mitochondria, and mitochondrial matrix, respectively, were separated by SDS-PAGE on 8% (larger molecular mass subcellular markers) or 12% (smaller molecular mass subcellular markers) gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membrane blocking, washing, and exposure to primary and secondary antibodies was performed by standard procedures. The primary antibodies used were: mouse anti-pyruvate dehydrogenase E1β subunit (Molecular Probes), rabbit anti-human mitochondrial β-ketoacyl synthase serum raised by Antibodies Inc., Davis, CA, from our purified protein (17Zhang L. Joshi A.K. Hofmann J. Schweizer E. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12422-12429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), rabbit anti-prohibitin (BioLegend), rabbit anti-prostaglandin E synthase-2 (Cayman Chemical Co.), rabbit-anti-PMP70 (U.S. Biological), and goat anti-lactate dehydrogenase (U.S. Biological). The secondary antibodies used were: horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (Bio-Rad), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (Pierce), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Technology). Staining was performed with either ECL or SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Expression and Purification of Human Mitochondrial ACP, Synthesis of Holo-ACP and Acetyl-ACP—Human mitochondrial ACP was expressed in the insect Sf9 cell/baculoviral host/vector system and the apo-form purified as described previously (16Zhang L. Joshi A.K. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40067-40074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Holo-ACP, acetyl-ACP, and d15-labeled octanoyl-ACP were synthesized using the human phosphopantetheinyl transferase with CoA, acetyl-CoA, and d15-octanoyl-CoA, respectively, as donor substrate, and purified by anion exchange chromatography (17Zhang L. Joshi A.K. Hofmann J. Schweizer E. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12422-12429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Bovine H-protein—Bovine H-protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as the apo-form, essentially as described earlier (19Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20011-20016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B and Sephadex G-100 were replaced with TSK gel DEAE-5PW (13 μ, 21.5 × 150 mm, Tosohaas) and HiPrep™ Sephacryl S-100 HR (16/60, Amersham Biosciences), respectively, and the hydroxylapatite step was omitted. The protein was at least 86% pure (SDS-PAGE). The m/z of the purified protein determined by MALDI-TOF MS was 13,847.4 ± 0.5, in good agreement with the estimated m/z for the apo-H-protein from which the N-terminal methionine had been cleaved (13,847.5). Full-length protein was not found either in the purified preparation or in the bacterial homogenate. A calculated absorbance coefficient for 280 nm 18,450 m-1 cm-1 (ProtParam, ExPASy server) was utilized to determine protein concentration. Synthesis of d15-Labeled Octanoyl-CoA—d15-labeled octanoyl-CoA was synthesized from d15-octanoic acid (CDN Isotopes) and CoASH via thiophenol thioesters (20Rutkoski A. Jaworski J.G. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and purified on a Waters C18 SepPak cartridge (21Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Berman H.A. Zhang L. Smith S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4100-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Identity and purity was confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS and reversed-phase HPLC. Analysis of 14C-Fatty Acyl-ACP Acyl Moieties Formed by Mitochondrial Matrix Preparations—The reaction mixture composition was based on earlier experiments using plant mitochondrial preparations (13Gueguen V. Macherel D. Jaquinod M. Douce R. Bourguignon J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5016-5025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and consisted of 0.1 m MOPS buffer (pH 7.1), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm S-adenosylmethionine, 4 mm sodium sulfide, 1.72 mg/ml bovine mitochondrial matrix extract, 8.5 μm holo-ACP, 26.5 μm S-acetyl-ACP, 4.5 mm NADPH, and 4.5 mm NADH and either 0.1 mm [2-14C]malonyl-CoA, initial concentration (25.7 kdpm/nmol), or 3.9 mm [2-14C]malonate (21.1 kdpm/nmol). When [2-14C]malonyl-CoA was used as the substrate, additional [2-14C]malonyl-CoA (85 μm) was added every hour. Reaction mixtures containing malonate were supplemented with 5 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, and4mm CoA. Additional 5 mm ATP was added every 2 h. Incubations were continued at 37 °C for 2 or 6 h. Before incubation, all reaction mixtures were degassed under house vacuum for 40 s and vacuum was replaced with nitrogen. The procedure was repeated twice. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 m HCl to a final pH ∼ 2 and ACPs were precipitated by treatment with ammonium sulfate, final concentration 2.4 m, for 1 h on ice. The precipitate was centrifuged and washed extensively with cold 2.4 m ammonium sulfate to remove free radioactivity. Subsequently, the S-acyl-ACP thioesters were hydrolyzed by treatment of the precipitates with 1 m KOH for 1 h at 20 °C. The hydrolysate was acidified, fatty acid standards (10 nmol each) were added, and the contents was extracted with hexane/isopropyl alcohol. To avoid loss of short fatty acids during evaporation, fatty acids were converted to the potassium salts, solvent was removed by evaporation with nitrogen and the fatty acid salts were derivatized with phenacyl-8 (Pierce). Phenacyl esters were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC (22Witkowski A. Joshi A.K. Smith S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10458-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To improve separation of phenacyl esters of short chain fatty acids and lipoic acid, the gradient was modified as follow: 45% solvent B (acetonitrile) for 5 min, then linear gradient to 56% B over 13 min, linear gradient to 90% B over 12 min, and finally linear gradient to 98% B over 9 min. Solvent A was water and the flow rate was 1 ml/min. Overall recoveries for the extraction and derivatization process were >90% for acyl chains longer than 4 C atoms, 80% for butyryl, 30% for acetyl, and 8% for malonyl standards. MALDI-TOF MS Analysis of Fatty Acyl-ACP and Fatty Acyl-H-protein Species Formed by Mitochondrial Matrix Preparation—Large scale (440 μl) de novo synthesis of acyl-ACPs was carried out as described above for [2-14C]malonyl-CoA except that non-radioactive malonyl-CoA was used as a substrate. When products of transfer of acyl moieties from ACP to the apo-H-protein were analyzed, 20 μm apo-H-protein was present and the reaction volume was reduced to 100 μl. Assay mixtures were incubated for 6 h, then 2-propanol was added to 40%, samples were kept on ice for 20 min and then centrifuged (12,900 × g for 30 min). The supernatant, enriched in ACPs, was collected, concentrated to 40 μl in a VivaSpin 5-kDa molecular mass cut-off device (VivaScience), diluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to 145 μl, and the acyl-ACP species were separated on a C18 300 Aå, 5 μm, 2.1 × 250-mm HPLC column (Vydac). The column was developed at 0.2 ml/min in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid using a 30–45% acetonitrile gradient over 5 min, 45% acetonitrile for 20 min, and two-step acetonitrile gradient 45–90% over 10 min and 90–95% over 2 min; elution was continued for additional 10 min. The HPLC fractions were lyophilized or directly used in MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Transfer of d15-octanoyl from ACP to H-protein was assayed in a 100-μl reaction where malonyl-CoA, NADPH, NADH, holo- and acetyl-ACP were replaced with 20 μm d15-labeled octanoyl-ACP and the matrix extract concentration was increased to 5.8 mg of protein/ml. The reaction was stopped after 2 h by addition of 2-propanol to 40% and the products analyzed as described above. Identification of 14C-Fatty Acyl Moieties Covalently Linked to H-protein—Radiolabeled fatty acids were synthesized de novo by mitochondrial extract in a slightly modified procedure. To increase the amount of 14C label on the H-protein, the matrix protein concentration was increased to 7.7 mg/ml and the initial concentration of acetyl-ACP primer was 17.5 μm. Every 2 h, acetyl-ACP was replenished (11 μm each addition). Reactions were stopped by addition of ammonium sulfate (2.4 m final concentration) that precipitated the acyl-ACPs. The supernatant containing H-protein was adjusted to pH 3.5 with 10% trifluoroacetic acid and injected onto an reversed-phase HPLC column, C18 300 Aå, 5 μm, 2.1 × 250 mm (Vydac). The column was eluted with a three-step gradient 5–40% over 15 min, 40–50% over 30 min, and 50–95% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 10 min and the elution was continued for another 5 min. Radioactive fractions eluting immediately following the unlabeled H-protein were collected, lyophilized, and H-protein radiopurity confirmed by SDS-PAGE on 13% gels followed by phosphorimaging. The 14C-acyl-H-protein species were hydrolyzed under vacuum for 3 h at 110 °C by treatment with 2 m KOH in the presence of bovine serum albumin (40 mg/ml) added as a carrier protein (23Kataoka H. Hirabayashi N. Makita M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 279: 166-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The hydrolysate was acidified to pH 1 with 6 n HCl and fatty acids extracted twice with 1.5 volume of dichloromethane. Fatty acids were derivatized with phenacyl-8 and identified as described above. MALDI-TOF-Mass Spectrometry—Samples dissolved in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid were mixed with sinapinic acid solution containing internal standards (cytochrome c and ubiquitin) and spotted on the target plate. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were acquired with Autoflex MS (Bruker Daltonics) and analyzed with Bruker Daltonics flexAnalysis version 2.0 software. Mass averages were calculated from at least six measurements. Characterization of the Mitochondrial Matrix Preparation—Conditions for homogenization were optimized to provide efficient cell lysis with minimal damage to mitochondria by monitoring the release of lactate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase (markers for cytosol and mitochondrial matrix, respectively) into the high speed supernatant. The purity of the mitochondrial preparation and the matrix fraction derived therefrom was assessed using various marker proteins (Fig. 1). The purified mitochondrial fraction was free of contamination by the cytosolic marker but contained small amounts of both peroxisomal and microsomal membrane markers. The mitochondrial matrix fraction was essentially free of contamination by peroxisomal, microsomal, and mitochondrial membrane markers. The mitochondrial β-ketoacyl synthase was recovered in the matrix fraction together with the matrix marker protein and this fraction was examined for its ability to synthesize fatty acyl chains. Fatty Acid Synthesis by Mitochondrial Matrix Preparation—The system used to assess the lipogenic activity of mitochondrial matrix preparations included acetyl-ACP and [2-14C]malonyl-CoA as substrates and both NADPH and NADH as a potential source of reducing equivalents. Preliminary experiments revealed that no radiolabel was incorporated into fatty acyl chains unless free ACP was included in the incubation system, indicating that malonyl-ACP, formed from malonyl-CoA by endogenous malonyl transferase was the actual source of chain extender units for lipogenesis and confirming the earlier finding that mammalian mitochondrial β-ketoacyl synthase uses malonyl-ACP but not malonyl-CoA as substrate (17Zhang L. Joshi A.K. Hofmann J. Schweizer E. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12422-12429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Control experiments also revealed that 90% of [2-14C]malonyl-CoA was destroyed after 2 h incubation with mitochondrial matrix extract, being converted mainly to malonic, acetic acid, and traces of acetyl-CoA. Previous studies have identified acyl-CoA thioesterase activity in mitochondria (24Svensson L.T. Alexson S.E.H. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12177-12183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and we confirmed that our matrix preparations contained thioesterase activity toward malonyl- and C2-C10 acyl-CoA thioesters; in contrast, the corresponding ACP thioesters were stable in the presence of matrix extract (details not shown). Thus, in subsequent experiments [2-14C]malonyl-CoA was routinely replenished every hour throughout the incubation period. Acyl-ACPs were precipitated with ammonium sulfate, the acyl chains were released by mild alkaline hydrolysis and derivatized with phenacyl-8. The major products formed after a 2-h incubation were C4- and C8-ACP with smaller amounts of C6-ACP and traces of C10-ACP (Fig. 2a). After 6 h of incubation, C8-ACP was the dominant product but significant amounts of C10, C12- and C14-ACP were also formed (Fig. 2b). Essentially the same product profile was observed when the acyl-ACPs were collected by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid (data not shown). The only radiolabeled compounds detected in the supernatants remaining after precipitation of the acyl-ACPs were malonate and acetate, the latter presumably formed by decarboxylation of malonyl moieties. Thus, the acyl-ACP products appeared to be stable and the acyl moieties did not undergo significant hydrolysis. The average condensation rate in these reactions was 1.06 and 1.25 nmol of malonyl moieties incorporated per mg of matrix protein per h for the 2- and 6-h incubations, respectively. The rate of uncoupled malonyl decarboxylation, as measured by the formation of radiolabeled acetyl moieties, was 0.08 and 0.06 nmol h-1 mg-1, respectively. No radiolabled acyl-ACPs were synthesized in the presence of cerulenin (data not shown), an inhibitor of β-ketoacyl synthases involved in de novo fatty acid synthesis in prokaryotes, plant chloroplasts, and eukaryotic cytosol (25Heath R.J. Rock C.O. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 581-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Recombinant human mitochondrial β-ketoacyl synthase is also inhibited by cerulenin (17Zhang L. Joshi A.K. Hofmann J. Schweizer E. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12422-12429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Utilization of the recombinant human mitochondrial His6-tagged ACP as the acyl carrier for fatty acid synthesis in the bovine mitochondrial matrix preparations also allowed unambiguous identification of newly synthesized acyl-ACPs by mass spectrometry, because the human ACP (11,445.0 Da, for N-acetylated, His6 apo form) and endogenous bovine ACP (10,109.6 Da, for apo form) differ significantly in molecular mass. The acyl-ACP species formed during a 6-h incubation were fractionated directly by reversed-phase HPLC and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. 3a). The recombinant acyl-ACP species eluted from the HPLC column in zones broader than anticipated, based on the elution profiles of purified acyl-ACP standards. Mass spectrometric analysis provided an explanation for this finding and revealed that the acyl-ACPs recovered from the reaction mixture included several species in which the ACP had been truncated in the C-terminal His6 tag to varying extents (Fig. 3, b and c, and Table 1). For example, C8-ACP was detected in zone C of the chromatogram as both the His6-tagged and His2-tagged ACP species (Fig. 3b) and C14-ACP was detected in zone H as the His6-tagged, His2-tagged, and untagged ACP species (Fig. 3c). Mass spectrometric analysis of purified ACP that had been incubated with the mitochondrial matrix extract, in the absence of any other substrates or cofactors, confirmed the presence of protease activity responsible for the removal of the C-terminal His tag (details not shown). Nevertheless, the data fully supported the results obtained by analysis of the radiolabeled acyl moieties and confirmed that the matrix preparation was capable of synthesizing saturated acyl chains containing up to 14 C atoms.TABLE 1Major acyl-ACP products identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry Samples were obtained as described in the legend to Fig. 3.

One potential source could be free malonate and this possibility was evaluated experimentally using the bovine mitochondrial matrix preparation (Fig. 2c). When [2-14C]malonyl-CoA was replaced by [2-14C]malonate plus ATP, CoA, and MgCl2, and the fatty acids released from the acyl-ACP species by mild basic hydrolysis were analyzed as phenacyl esters, again significant amounts of de novo synthesized fatty acids were detected, predominantly octanoate, although the rate of formation was lower than when malonyl-CoA was added directly to the incubation system. No products were formed in the absence of ATP and MgCl2 (Fig. 2d), confirming that an ATP-dependent ligase present in the matrix preparation is able to convert malonate to malonyl-CoA that can be subsequently utilized for fatty acid synthesis. Coupling of Lipogenesis and Lipoylation Pathways in Mitochondrial Matrix Preparations—One of the roles proposed for the mitochondrial fatty acid biosynthetic pathway is to provide octanoyl moieties that can be utilized as a substrate for the lipoylation of mitochondrial proteins, pyruvate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and the glycine cleavage enzyme. This hypothesis was evaluated by including in the mitochondrial matrix incubations the apo-form of the recombinant bovine H-protein of the glycine cleavage system and separating the radiolabeled protein products by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4, a and b). In the absence of apo-H-protein, the only radiolabeled protein detected was ACP, but inclusion of the apo-H-protein in the incubation system resulted in formation of a radiolabeled protein corresponding approximately to the molecular mass of the H-protein (theoretically 13,850 Da). Neither the ACP nor H-protein was radiolabeled when cerulenin was included in the incubation confirming that the radiolabel was associated with a product of fatty acid synthesis. The absence of radiolabel corresponding to residual [2-14C]malonyl-ACP in the phosphorimages apparently is due to lability of the malonyl-CoA thioester during sample preparation and SDS-PAGE, because residual [2-14C]malonyl-ACP was readily detectable by reversed-phase HPLC, which does not involve heating or exposure to alkaline pH. Verification of the identity of the radiolabeled H-protein was provided by first removing acyl-ACPs from the postincubation reaction mixture by ammonium sulfate precipitation; H-protein is not precipitated by this procedure. The supernatant was subjected to reversed-phase HPLC, fractions were collected and examined by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Two zones were identified in the eluate from the HPLC column that contained H-protein. Only the second zone (Fig. 4c, inset) contained radioactivity and subsequent analysis revealed that essentially all of the radioactivity associated with the H-protein corresponded to octanoyl moieties (Fig. 4c). The formation of octanoyl-H-protein was directly confirmed in a similar experiment where [2-14C]malonyl-CoA was replaced with non-radioactive substrate (Fig. 5a). The presence in the mitochondrial matrix extract of a enzyme capable of translocating octanoyl moieties from ACP thioester linkage to H-protein N-lysyl amide linkage was confirmed by incubating highly purified d15-labeled octanoyl-ACP with mitochondrial matrix extract and apo-H-protein. The H-proteins were purified and examined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. 5b). Two species were identified with molecular masses corresponding to unreacted apo-H-protein and d15-octanoyl-H protein.FIGURE 5MALDI-TOF MS spectra of octanoyl-H-protein product formed by mitochondrial matrix extract. a, de novo fatty acid synthesis from malonyl-CoA after a 6-h incubation and (b) 2 h transfer of d15-labe"

Here we identify mycobacterial UvrD1 as a novel interaction partner for Ku in a genome-wide yeast two-hybrid screen. UvrD1 per se is a vigorous DNA-dependent ATPase but a feeble DNA helicase. Ku stimulates UvrD1 to catalyze ATP-dependent unwinding of 3′-tailed DNAs. UvrD1, Ku, and DNA form a stable ternary complex in the absence of ATP. The Ku binding determinants are located in the distinctive C-terminal segment of UvrD1. A second mycobacterial paralog, UvrD2, is a vigorous Ku-independent DNA helicase. Ablation of UvrD1 sensitizes Mycobacterium smegmatis to killing by ultraviolet and ionizing radiation and to a single chromosomal break generated by I-SceI endonuclease. The physical and functional interactions of bacterial Ku and UvrD1 highlight the potential for cross-talk between components of nonhomologous end joining and nucleotide excision repair pathways.

Stephanou, unpublished data.An outstanding issue is whether the bacterial NHEJ apparatus incorporates other components beside Ku and LigD. An important corollary question is whether the actions of Ku or LigD extend beyond NHEJ. To begin to address these problems, we conducted unbiased two-hybrid screens of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomic library for LigD and Ku binding partners. The power of the screen was exemplified by the recovery of library plasmid clones encoding Ku when full-length LigD was used as the bait (2Gong C. Bongiorno P. Martins A. Stephanou N.C. Zhu H. Shuman S. Glickman M.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The present study was prompted by the results of a new two-hybrid screen using Ku as the bait, which identified two Ku-binding proteins. One of these is Ku itself, consistent with the fact that mycobacterial Ku is a homodimer (3Weller G.R. Kysela B. Roy R. Tonkin L.M. Scanlan E. Della M. Devine S.K. Day J.P. Wilkinson A. di Fagagna F. Devine K.M. Bowater R.P. Jeggo P.A. Jackson S.P. Doherty A.J. Science. 2002; 297: 1686-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). A second novel Ku-binding protein is UvrD1, which is one of two mycobacterial homologs of the bacterial UvrD/PcrA helicase clade (13Mackintosh S.G. Raney K.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4154-4159Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 14Matson S.W. Robertson A.B.

The connection between Ku and UvrD1 is provocative, given that UvrD-like enzymes in other bacteria participate in non-NHEJ pathways of DNA repair. Here we present a biochemical and genetic characterization of mycobacterial UvrD1, which reveals a requirement for Ku to activate its latent helicase activity. We provide evidence that UvrD1, although nonessential for replication, plays a role in the repair of multiple forms of DNA damage, including site-specific chromosomal double-strand breaks.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Two-hybrid Screen for M. tuberculosis Ku-binding Proteins—The bait plasmid comprised a fusion of the LexA DNA-binding domain (BD) encoded in pEG202 (17Golemis E. Serebriiskii I. Finley R.L.J. Kolonin M.G. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1999: 20.21.21-20Google Scholar) to the N terminus of full-length MtuKu. Expression of the appropriately sized fusion protein in yeast was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-LexA antisera (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and control experiments verified that the BD-Ku fusion protein localized to the nucleus but did not activate reporter gene expression by itself. An M. tuberculosis LexA activation domain (AD) fusion library was produced by partial digestion of M. tuberculosis Erdman genomic DNA with TaqI, AccI, and HinPII. These individual digests were size-selected (1-1.5kb), combined, and then ligated into the unique ClaI site of pJSC401, which is a derivative of pJG4-5. The interaction screen was performed as described (17Golemis E. Serebriiskii I. Finley R.L.J. Kolonin M.G. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1999: 20.21.21-20Google Scholar) by mating of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain EGY48 containing the AD fusion library to strain W303a containing the BD bait plasmid and the lacZ reporter plasmid pSH18-34. A screen of 105 yeast transformants for Ku interaction yielded 67 positives that: (i) retested for Ku interaction upon plasmid recovery and retransformation in the yeast reporter strain and (ii) did not activate reporter gene expression in tandem with an unrelated bait plasmid. The inserts of all positives were sequenced to identify the M. tuberculosis coding sequence in the BD plasmid.Recombinant UvrD1—The open reading frame encoding Mycobacterium smegmatis UvrD1 (MSMEG5534, available at www.tigr.org) was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA with primers that introduced an NdeI site at the start codon and a BglII site 3′ of the stop codon. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BglII and inserted between the NdeI and BamHI sites in pET16b to generate an expression plasmid encoding the MsmUvrD1 polypeptide fused to an N-terminal His10 tag. The open reading frame encoding M. tuberculosis UvrD1 (Rv0949) was amplified from genomic DNA with primers that introduced an NdeI site at the start codon and a BamHI site 3′ of the stop codon. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and inserted into pET16b to generate an expression plasmid encoding the MtuUvrD1 polypeptide fused to an N-terminal His10 tag. Alanine substitution mutations were introduced into the MsmUvrD1 plasmid by PCR amplification with mutagenic primers. The inserts of all UvrD1 plasmids were sequenced to exclude the acquisition of unwanted coding changes during amplification or cloning.The pET-MsmUvrD1 and pET-MtuUvrD1plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Cultures (1 liter) were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin until the A600 reached ∼0.6. The cultures were chilled on ice for 45 min, and the expression of recombinant protein was induced by adjusting the culture to 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, followed by incubation at 17 °C for 16 h with constant shaking. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellets were stored at -80 °C. All of the subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Thawed bacteria were resuspended in 50 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m NaCl, 10% sucrose). Lysozyme and Triton X-100 were added to final concentrations of 1 mg/ml and 0.1%, respectively. The lysates were sonicated to reduce viscosity, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The soluble extracts were applied to 3-ml columns of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated with buffer A. The columns were washed with 20 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25 m NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) and then eluted stepwise with 10-ml aliquots of buffer B containing 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 mm imidazole. The polypeptide compositions of the column fractions were monitored by SDS-PAGE. The His10-UvrD1 polypeptides were recovered predominantly in the 100 and 200 mm imidazole eluates. Fractions containing the UvrD1 protein were pooled and dialyzed against buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) containing 150 mm NaCl. The dialysates were adjusted to 250 mm NaCl and then applied to 3-ml columns of DEAE-Sephacel that had been equilibrated with 250 mm NaCl in buffer C. The columns were washed with the same buffer and then eluted stepwise with 500 and 1000 mm NaCl in buffer C. UvrD1 was recovered in the flow-through, which was dialyzed against 150 mm NaCl in buffer C and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by using the Bio-Rad dye reagent with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The yield of wild-type MsmUvrD1 was 5 mg from a 1-liter bacterial culture. The MsmUvrD1-(K45A/T46A) mutant was produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells by IPTG induction at 17 °C and purified as described above. The MsmUvrD1-(D235A) mutant was produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) Codon Plus (grown in LB broth containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol) by IPTG induction at 17 °C and purified as described above.Recombinant Ku—The open reading frame encoding M. tuberculosis Ku (Rv0937c) was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA with primers that introduced an NdeI site at the start codon and a BamHI site 3′ of the stop codon. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and inserted into pET16b (Novagen) to yield a plasmid encoding full-length Ku fused to an N-terminal His10 tag. The insert was sequenced to exclude the acquisition of unwanted coding changes. The pET-MtuKu plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). Ku was produced by IPTG induction at 17 °C and purified from a soluble lysate by nickel-agarose and DEAE-Sephacel chromatography as described above for UvrD1. Ku was recovered in the 100 and 200 mm imidazole eluates during the nickel-agarose step and the flow-through during the DEAE-Sephacel step. The yield of Ku was 30 mg from a 500-ml bacterial culture.Recombinant UvrD2—The open reading frame encoding M. smegmatis UvrD2 (MSMEG1952) was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA with primers that introduced BamHI sites over the start codon and 3′ of the stop codon. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and inserted into pET28-His10-Smt3 to generate an expression plasmid encoding the full-length MsmUvrD2 polypeptide fused to an N-terminal His10-Smt3 tag. The D237A coding change was introduced by PCR amplification with mutagenic primers. The inserts of the MsmUvrD2 plasmids were sequenced to exclude the acquisition of unwanted coding changes during amplification or cloning. The expression plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). The wild-type and mutant His10-Smt3-MsmUvrD2 proteins were produced by IPTG induction at 17 °C and purified from soluble lysates by nickel-agarose and DEAE-Sephacel chromatography as described above for UvrD1. His10-Smt3-MsmUvrD2 was recovered in the 1000 mm imidazole eluate during the nickel-agarose step and the flow-through during the DEAE-Sephacel step. The His10-Smt3 tag was then removed by digestion of the preparation with the Smt3-specific protease Ulp1 for 3 h at 4 °C (at a UvrD2:Ulp1 ratio of 1000:1). The tag-free MsmUvrD2 protein was separated from His10-Smt3 by passage of the digest over a nickel-agarose column. MsmUvrD2 was recovered in the flow-through. The yield of MsmUvrD2 was 1 mg from a 2-liter bacterial culture.Velocity Sedimentation—An aliquot (50 μg) of UvrD1 or UvrD2 was mixed with catalase (50 μg), BSA (50 μg), and cytochrome c (100 μg). The mixture was applied to a 4.8-ml 15-30% glycerol gradient containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100. The gradient was centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 18 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW55Ti rotor. Fractions (∼0.2 ml) were collected from the bottom of the tube.Nucleoside Triphosphatase Assay—Reaction mixtures containing (per 10 μl) 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP or [α-32P]ATP (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences), 50 ng of salmon sperm DNA, and UvrD1 or UvrD2 as specified were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. An aliquot (2 μl) of the mixture was applied to a polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate, which was developed either with 0.45 m ammonium sulfate or 0.5 m LiCl, 1 m formic acid. The radiolabeled material was visualized by autoradiography, and 32Pi or 32P-ADP formation was quantified by scanning the TLC plate with a Fujix BAS2500 imager. Alternatively, reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm unlabeled NTP or dNTP, 100 ng of salmon sperm DNA, and UvrD1 or UvrD2 as specified were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched by adding 1 ml of malachite green reagent (BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA). Phosphate release was determined by measuring A620 and interpolating the value to a phosphate standard curve.Helicase Assay—The 5′ 32P-labeled strand was prepared by reaction of a synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The labeled DNA was purified by electrophoresis through a native 18% polyacrylamide gel. The labeled strand was annealed to a 2-fold excess of a complementary DNA strand to form the tailed duplex helicase substrates shown in the figures. Helicase reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 pmol (50 nm) radiolabeled DNA, and proteins as specified were preincubated for 5 min on ice. The reaction was initiated by adding 1 mm ATP and 5 pmol of an unlabeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the labeled strand of the helicase substrate. The addition of excess of unlabeled strand was necessary to prevent the spontaneous reannealing of the unwound 32P-labeled DNA strand. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C and then quenched by adding 2 μl of a solution containing 2% SDS, 200 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol, 0.3% bromphenol blue. A control reaction mixture containing no protein was heated for 5 min at 95 °C. The reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 15-cm 15% polyacrylamide gel in 89 mm Tris borate, 2.5 mm EDTA. The products were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by scanning the gel with a Fujix BAS-2500 imaging apparatus.M. smegmatis uvrD1 Null Mutant—The M. smegmatis ΔuvrD1 mutant was engineered by two-step allelic exchange using suicide vectors and the counterselectable marker sacB (2Gong C. Bongiorno P. Martins A. Stephanou N.C. Zhu H. Shuman S. Glickman M.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The disruption cassette generated an in-frame deletion of the majority of the coding sequence (spanning aa 27-756), thereby avoiding possible polar effects on downstream genes. The gene disruption was confirmed by Southern blotting using flanking DNA sequences as probes. The wild-type M. smegmatis uvrD1 gene (under the control of its native promoter) was inserted into the integrase-based plasmid pMV306-Kan and then introduced by transformation into the chromosomal attB locus of the ΔuvrD1 strain (18Lee M.H. Pascopella L. Jacobs W.R. Hatfull G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3111-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The wild-type M. tuberculosis uvrD1 gene (under the control of the M. smegmatis uvrD1 promoter) was also integrated at the attB locus of a ΔuvrD1 strain.UV Sensitivity—Aliquots (10 μl) of serial 10-fold dilutions of wild-type and ΔuvrD1 strains of M. smegmatis (A600 =∼0.3) were spotted in duplicate on LB agar plates. The plates were irradiated with the indicated UV dose using a Stratalinker 254-nm UV light source. The plates were then incubated in the dark for 3 days at 37 °C. The surviving colonies were counted and normalized to the colony counts from duplicate samples spotted from the same cultures that were not exposed to UV (defined as 100%).Ionizing Radiation (IR) Sensitivity—Cultures of wild-type and ΔuvrD1 strains of M. smegmatis in log phase (A600 = 0.2-0.3) or stationary phase (A600 = 2.0) were harvested by centrifugation, and the cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% Tween 80. After brief treatment in a water bath sonicator to disperse clumps, aliquots (0.2 ml containing ∼107 bacteria) were irradiated with a 137Cs source that delivered a dose of 12 grays min-1. Radiation was performed on a rotating platform to ensure equal IR exposure of each cell suspension. Serial dilutions of the irradiated cells were plated on LB agar. IR-surviving colonies were counted with a dissecting microscope and normalized to the colony counts from controls that were not exposed to IR (defined as 100%).Inducible Chromosome Breakage by Expression of I-SceI Endonuclease—Induction of a site-specific double strand break in the M. smegmatis chromosome was achieved by expression of the rare-cutting I-SceI endonuclease (19Colleaux L. D'Auriol L. Galibert F. Dujon B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6022-6026Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) under the control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter (20Ehrt S. Guo X.V. Hickey C.M. Ryou M. Monteleone M. Riley L.W. Schnappinger D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e21Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The Tet/I-SceI cassette was integrated at the attB locus with or without a neighboring 18-bp recognition site for I-SceI cleavage. Anhydrotetracycline (AHT)-induced I-SceI expression, and cleavage at the target site was verified by Southern blotting of genomic DNA. 7N. C. Stephanou, F. Gao, P. Bongiorno, S. Ehrt, D.

Aliquots (10 μl) of serial 10-fold dilutions of the cultures were plated in duplicate on LB agar containing 20 μg/ml kanamycin (which selects for the I-SceI cassette) and 50 ng/ml AHT. AHT-surviving colonies were counted with a dissecting microscope and normalized to the colony counts from controls that were plated on LB agar lacking AHT.RESULTSIdentification of UvrD1 as a Binding Partner for Ku—To identify additional candidate components of the mycobacterial NHEJ pathway, we performed an unbiased yeast two-hybrid screen for mycobacterial gene products that interact with M. tuberculosis Ku. The AD fusion library contains ∼1-kilobase pair inserts of M. tuberculosis genomic DNA. An initial round of screening entailed cotransformation of the bait and library plasmids and selection for galactose-dependent leucine prototrophy, followed by secondary screening for galactose-dependent lacZ reporter expression. Plasmids recovered from individual isolates were retested by cotransformation with the BD-Ku plasmid or a control plasmid encoding a BD-MmaA2 fusion (21Glickman M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7844-7849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Of 67 clones that retested positive for leucine prototrophy and lacZ expression, 28 had in-frame fusions to a M. tuberculosis gene. Two contained a fusion between the activation domain and Ku, spanning the segment of Ku from aa 25 to 273. The Ku-Ku interaction in vivo is consistent with biochemical evidence that purified mycobacterial Ku is a homodimer (3Weller G.R. Kysela B. Roy R. Tonkin L.M. Scanlan E. Della M. Devine S.K. Day J.P.

Science. 2002; 297: 1686-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar).The novel finding was that 24 of 28 clones recovered from the screen encoded an in-frame AD fusion to a C-terminal fragment of M. tuberculosis UvrD1 (Rv0949). MtuUvrD1 is a 771-aa polypeptide and a putative ortholog of the DNA repair helicases Bacillus stearothermophilus PcrA and E. coli UvrD. The N-terminal segment of UvrD1 contains the canonical motifs I (GXGXGKT) and II (DEXX) that comprise the ATP and metal-binding sites of the superfamily I helicases. Indeed, the full suite of amino acids that form the ATPase active site or interact with the 3′-tailed helicase substrate in the DNA co-crystal of PcrA (15Velankar S.S. Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S.

Cell. 2006; 127: 1349-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) are conserved in MtuUvrD1 (Fig. 1). The primary structures of UvrD1 and PcrA are conserved across their entire lengths, with the notable exceptions of several UvrD1-specific inserts within the C-terminal segment. The 24 AD-UvrD1 clones selected in the Ku interaction screen encoded four different fusions starting from MtuUvrD1 residues 442, 469, 491, and 508 and extending to the C terminus (Fig. 1). The MtuUvrD1 fusions interacted specifically with Ku, and reporter gene activation was abolished by glucose repression of the MtuUvrD1 fusion, indicating that the Ku bait alone did not activate transcription (Fig. 1). These results provide evidence of a physical interaction between mycobacterial Ku and UvrD1 in the absence of other mycobacterial proteins, and they localize the Ku interface of UvrD1 to the distinctive C-terminal portion of the UvrD1 protein.UvrD1 Ablation Sensitizes Mycobacterium to DNA Damage—M. smegmatis encodes a 783-aa UvrD1 polypeptide (MSMEG5534) that has 637 positions of side chain identity to MtuUvrD1. To gauge the role of UvrD1 in mycobacterial physiology, we deleted the uvrD1 gene of M. smegmatis by removing the bulk of the open reading frame and rejoining the 5′ and 3′ termini with maintenance of the translation frame. The ΔuvrD1 mutant was generated by a two-step allelic exchange strategy. The ΔuvrD1 cassettes were cloned into mycobacterial suicide plasmids containing hygR and sacB markers, which were then used to transform M. smegmatis mc2155 to hygromycin resistance. The hygR sucrose-sensitive ΔuvrD1 uvrD1+ mero-diploid strains were genotyped to verify targeted insertion and then subjected to sucrose counterselection for loss of the intervening sacB marker (2Gong C. Bongiorno P. Martins A. Stephanou N.C. Zhu H. Shuman S. Glickman M.S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Southern hybridization of restriction endonuclease-digested genomic DNA from hygromycin-sensitive, sucrose-resistant segregants revealed the predicted fragment sizes for correctly targeted allelic exchange at the uvrD1 locus (not shown). The viable ΔuvrD1 strain grew as well as the parental wild-type strain on agar medium and in liquid culture (not shown).Wild-type and ΔuvrD1 strains were tested for sensitivity to various DNA damaging agents (Fig. 2). The ΔuvrD1 strain was extremely sensitive to killing by UV irradiation, suffering a 1000-fold reduction in survival after exposure to 5-10 J/m2, a dose that had virtually no effect on wild-type M. smegmatis (Fig. 2A).

In the present study, the Raf-1, MEK, and ERK activities were concomitantly decreased in fibroblasts, which inhibit morphological transformation and proliferation by Axin induction. The inhibition of the components of the ERK pathway by Axin occurred in cells retaining wild-type β-catenin, including primary hepatocytes, but not in cells retaining non-degradable mutant β-catenin. Axin inhibits cellular proliferation and ERK pathway activation induced by either epidermal growth factor or Ras, indicating a role of Axin in the regulation of growth induced by ERK pathway activation. ERK pathway regulation by Axin occurs at least partly via reduction of the protein level of Ras. Both wild-type and mutant Ras proteins are subjected to regulation by Axin, which occurs in cells retaining wild-type but not mutant β-catenin gene. The role of β-catenin in the regulation of the Ras-ERK pathway was further confirmed by Ras reduction and subsequent inhibitions of the ERK pathway components by knock down of mutated form of β-catenin. The Ras regulation by Axin was blocked by treatment of leupeptin, an inhibitor of the lysosomal protein degradation machinery.

The implication of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in carcinogenesis has been attributable to aberrant regulation of this pathway as a result of mutations of the β-catenin gene, adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc), and/or Axin.

Although deregulation of both the Wnt/β-catenin and ERK pathways can lead to transformation, the interaction of the two pathways during tumorigenesis is poorly understood. The potential tumor formation by K-ras mutation was significantly inhibited in cells retaining wild-type Apc (21Jen J. Powell S.M. Papadopoulos N. Smith K.J. Hamilton S.R. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5523-5526PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that β-catenin gene can cooperate with ras in neoplastic transformation (22Damalas A. Kahan S. Shtutman M. Ben-Ze'ev A. Oren M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4912-4922Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 23Harada N. Oshima H. Katoh M. Tamai Y. Oshima M. Taketo M.M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies utilizing colorectal cancer cell lines demonstrated that Ras-induced proliferation and transformation were reduced by overexpression of Apc (24Park K.S. Jeon S.H. Kim S.E. Bahk Y.Y. Holmen S.L. Williams B.O. Chung K.C. Surh Y.J. Choi K.Y. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although these studies imply an interaction between the Wnt/β-catenin and ERK signaling pathways in carcinogenesis, a mechanism and in vivo evidence for the interaction are lacking. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the Wnt/β-catenin and the ERK pathways by measuring the effects of Axin induction using stable L929 fibroblast cells retaining doxycycline (Dox)-inducible Axin (L929-Axin). Axin, a negative regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, was identified as an inhibitor of the Raf-1 → MEK → ERK cascade in fibroblasts, the finding of which was also revealed in primary hepatocytes and several cancer cells. β-Catenin was identifiable as a mediator in ERK pathway regulation by Axin, for which regulation was investigated by measurements of Axin overexpression on activation of the ERK pathway components in different types of cells that retained either a mutated or functionally active wild-type β-catenin gene. Inhibition of the ERK pathway by Axin appears to be associated with Ras regulation. The GTP-loading capacities of both mutant and wild-type Ras were reduced by Axin overexpression. The reductions of GTP loading of non-hydrolyzable mutant Ras (25Lyu J. Costantini F. Jho E.H. Joo C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13487-13495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was found to be attributable to the reduction of the Ras protein level by Wnt/β-catenin signaling. The Ras regulation by Axin overexpression was abolished by treatment of leupeptin, the lysosomal inhibitor, indicating involvement of the lysosomal protein degradation machinery in the regulation of the Ras protein level. Axin inhibits ERK pathway activation stimulated either by EGF or Ras and at least partly via reduction of Ras protein level. The Ras-ERK pathway inhibition by Axin occurs in a β-catenin-dependent manner and is related to regulation of cellular proliferation. The roles of β-catenin in the regulation of Ras and the ERK pathway components were clearly indicated by the measured effects of the knockdown of non-degradable mutant β-catenin. The role of β-catenin in Ras regulation was further indicated by the lack of effect of Axin induction in cells overexpressing β-catenin S33Y, a non-degradable β-catenin. Axin can affect Ras at the levels both of GTP loading and protein regulation. The role of EGFR in the regulation of Ras by Axin was indicated by the measured effects of EGFR siRNA. The functional point of Axin was further defined as occurring upstream of Raf by loss of the anti-proliferative role of Axin in cells over-expressing Raf-1-CAAX (26Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), an active form of Raf. The role of Axin as the anti-transforming factor involving ERK pathway regulation was revealed by inhibition of the anchorage-independent cellular growth by EGF or oncogenic Ras in cells expressing Axin. The identification of Ras-ERK pathway regulation by Wnt/β-catenin signaling provides evidence for interaction between the Wnt/β-catenin and ERK pathways in carcinogenesis. In addition, this study also contributes to resolving the uncertainty in previous observations of a functional synergism between ras and β-catenin gene in carcinogenesis. Plasmids—The expression vector for Axin, pCS2-MT-Axin, and inducible expression vectors for GFP (pBI-EGFP) and GFP-Axin (pBI-EGFP-Axin) were described in previous studies (14Zeng L. Fagotto F.

Axin-inducible Fibroblasts and Preparation of Cells—To establish GFP (L929-GFP) and GFP-Axin (L929-GFP-Axin), inducible L929 cells were co-transfected with either pBI-EGFP or pBI-EGFP-Axin with rtTA2SM2-Neo at a 1:3 molar ratio using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). Stably transfected clones were selected in a medium containing 800 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), and individual G418-resistant clones were isolated in cloning dishes (Sigma). L929-GFP-Axin cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), G418 (200 μg/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin G sodium (100 μg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Axin was induced by 0.5 μg/ml Dox (Sigma) and/or stimulated with 20 ng/ml EGF (Cell Signaling Biotechnology). For observation of cell morphological changes, L929-Axin-GFP cells and L929-GFP cells were seeded into 6-well plates at 4 × 104 cells/well and cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 24 h. The GFP-expressed cells were induced for 24 h by treatment with 0.5 μg/ml Dox. After induction, the cells were examined under a phase-contrast fluorescence microscope (Nikon, TE-2000U, Japan) for visualization of morphology and expression of GFP or Axin-GFP. DLD-1, HCT-116, and SW-480 colorectal cancer cells and Chang normal liver and HepG2 hepatoma cancer cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured as previously described (24Park K.S.

After growth for 24 h, cells were transfected with plasmids using Lipofectamine Plus reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen), and then harvested at 24 h thereafter. Cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, harvested, and then lysed using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) to determine the protein concentrations. Primary Cells—Rat primary hepatocytes were isolated using the collagenase perfusion method (29Woodcroft K.J. Novak R.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 304-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The portal vein was catheterized with a 22-gauge Angiocath catheter, and following perfusion of the liver with collagenase buffer, the liver was removed and shredded for isolation of hepatocytes. The hepatocytes were then washed three times with cold serum-free DMEM. Hepatocytes (1.5 × 106) were seeded onto 60-mm dishes coated with collagen IV (BD Biosciences) and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS, streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin G sodium (100 μg/ml) then incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2.To examine the effects of Axin and/or EGF, cells were transiently transfected with pCS2-MT-Axin and/or were treated with 20 ng/ml EGF. The cells were harvested at 24 h after transfection and subjected to Western blot analysis. β-Catenin and EGFR siRNAs and Treatment—β-Catenin gene (GenBank™ accession number NM_001904) and EGFR (NM_207655) mRNA target sequences were designed using an siRNA template design tool (Ambion, Austin, TX), and siRNA was prepared with a Silencer™ siRNA construction kit (Ambion), as described previously (24Park K.S. Jeon S.H. Kim S.E. Bahk Y.Y. Holmen S.L. Williams B.O. Chung K.C. Surh Y.J. Choi K.Y. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). 29-mer oligonucleotides containing the T7 promoter sequence (5′-CCTGTCTC-3′) were designed (mouse EGFR, 5′-AATGGACTTACAGAGCCATCC-3′ (531-551) and 5′-AAAGAAGACGCCTTCTTGCAG-3′ (3181-3201); human β-catenin gene, 5′-AAGGAGCTAAAATGGCAGTGC-3′ (800-821) and 5′-AATGGCTTGGAATGAGACTGC-3′ (2061-2082)). The siRNAs were transfected into HCT-116 or L929-Axin cells with Lipofectamine Plus reagent, using an 8.4 μg per 100-cm culture dish. The transfected cells were grown for 36 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator and harvested for Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed as previously described (7Laurent-Puig P. Legoix P. Bluteau O. Belghiti J. Franco D. Binot F. Monges G. Thomas G. Bioulac-Sage P.

Protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Foci Formation Assay—To evaluate anchorage-independent growth, 1.2 × 103 L929-Axin-GFP cells were suspended in 1 ml of 0.3% molten top agarose (Invitrogen) with or without 0.5 μg/ml Dox and overlaid onto 1 ml of 0.5% solid bottom agarose in 12-well plates. After solidification, the top layer of agarose was covered with 1 ml of culture medium with and without 0.5 μg/ml Dox and, where required, 20 ng/ml EGF was added. The colonies were maintained at 37 °C and periodically replenished with fresh medium containing Dox and/or EGF. Fourteen days after plating, colonies were examined under a phase-contrast fluorescence microscope for visualization of colonies expressing GFP. Whole well images were captured using a Nikon digital camera and viewed using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 software. The average size of globes was calculated by averaging data (data are expressed as mean, μm3) from at least 150 colonies. Differences between groups were analyzed using the two-sample t test and were considered significant when the p value was <0.05.

Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) were transfected with pCS20MT-Axin for 24 h, 1.5 × 103 cells were then re-seeded into a 12-well soft agar plate, as described above, and H-RasG12R was induced with Dox, also as described above. Cell Cycle and Quantitative Proliferation Analyses—The cell cycle was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) as previously described (24Park K.S. Jeon S.H. Kim S.E. Bahk Y.Y. Holmen S.L. Williams B.O. Chung K.C. Surh Y.J. Choi K.Y. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). L929-GFP-Axin cells were grown to 60% confluence in 6-well plates and were arrested with double thymidine blocking for 12 h. Cells were then either untreated or treated with 0.5 μg/ml Dox and/or 20 ng/ml EGF at 12 h before FACS analysis. Cells were harvested, rinsed twice with PBS, fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol, and then washed in PBS containing 1% FBS. Subsequently, DNA was stained with propidium iodide (BD Biosciences) for 30 min at 37 °C. The cell cycle profile was determined using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using the ModFit LT 2.0 program (Verity Software House, Inc., Topsham, ME) and the WinMDI 2.8 program created by Joseph Trotter of Scripps Research Institute. Error bars indicate the standard deviations of three independent analyses experiments. For quantitative analyses of proliferation, L929-GFP-Axin cells were transfected with pZIP-Raf-CCAX (26Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3136-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) for 24 h followed by subsequent induction of Axin with 0.5 μg/ml Dox for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. BrdUrd addition and measurements of the relative intensities of BrdUrd were performed as described previously (24Park K.S. Jeon S.H. Kim S.E. Bahk Y.Y. Holmen S.L. Williams B.O. Chung K.C. Surh Y.J. Choi K.Y. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cell Growth Measurement—Cell growth was determined by the number of viable cells. The cells were seeded into 6-well plates at 2 × 104 cells/well, and the medium was replaced every day with fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS with or without 0.5 μg/ml Dox. Where required, 20 ng/ml EGF was added. For enumeration of viable cells, cells were trypsinized and washed once with PBS, and then the total numbers of viable cells were counted using a hemocytometer. BrdUrd Incorporation—For BrdUrd incorporation, L929 or NIH3T3-Ras cells were seeded onto 22 × 22-mm coverslips in 6-well plates at 2 × 104 cells per well. Cells were transiently transfected with pCS2-MT-Axin, pCS2-MT, FLAG-β-catein-pcDNA3.0, or pcDNA3.0 and treated with 0.5 μg/ml Dox for H-Ras induction. Where required, BrdUrd (Roche Applied Science) was added at a final concentration of 20 μm at 36 h after transfection, and the cells were further incubated for 8 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with PBS and then fixed in a methanol/formaldehyde (99:1, v/v) mixture at -20 °C for 20 min. Cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 30 min and then gently washed three times with PBS. Cells were incubated with mouse anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) at a 1:100 dilution for 2 h at room temperature, incubated with goat anti-mouse-Cy™2-conjugated secondary antibody at a 1:1000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature, and then washed five times with PBS. For nuclear staining, 4′, 6′-diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, Roche Applied Science) was used at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml in PBS for 10 min followed by extensive washing with PBS. Coverslips were mounted, and then cells were viewed using a Radiance 2000/MP multiphoton imaging system (BioRad). Each analysis was performed at least three times. Measurement of Ras Activation—The capacity of Ras-GTP to bind the Ras binding domain of Raf-1 was used to determine the level of GTP-bound Ras, as described previously (24Park K.S. Jeon S.H. Kim S.E. Bahk Y.Y. Holmen S.L. Williams B.O. Chung K.C. Surh Y.J. Choi K.Y. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Reporter Analysis—For reporter gene assays, L929-GFP-Axin cells were seeded into 6-well dishes at 2 × 104 cells per well. Transfection efficiencies were determined by transfecting cells with 50 ng of the β-galactosidase reporter plasmid, pCMV β-galactosidase (Clontech). L929-GFP-Axin cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of pElk-1, 0.5 μg of pFR-Luc, and 25 ng of pFA2-Elk-1. At 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested and luciferase assay were performed in triplicate from independent cell cultures as described previously (24Park K.S. Jeon S.H. Kim S.E. Bahk Y.Y. Holmen S.L. Williams B.O. Chung K.C. Surh Y.J. Choi K.Y. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical Staining—For immunocytochemical staining, L929-Axin-GFP cells were seeded at 2 × 104 cells/well in 6-well plates on 22 × 22-mm coverslips and cultured for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The cells were treated with 0.5 μg/ml Dox. Induced L929-Axin-GFP cells were fixed for 15 min at room temperature with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS at pH 7.4, per-meabilized for 30 min on ice with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. The antibody and DAPI reactions used the same fluorescence staining method. Following several washing with PBS, the slides were mounted in a mounting medium. Cells were imaged using a Radiance 2100 laser scanning confocal microscope and operated by Lasersharp 2000 software (Bio-Rad). A minimum of three 0.5-μm Z slices were acquired for each cell. Axin Inhibits the ERK Pathway and Alters the Morphology of L929 Fibroblasts—The role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in ERK pathway regulation was investigated by examining the effects of Axin on the activities of the ERK pathway components. For this purpose, we generated L929 cells expressing Axin by a Dox-inducible system (L929-GFP-Axin). Upon treatment with Dox, expression of GFP-Axin was evident in L929-GFP-Axin cells after 2 h and was sustained up to 8 h post-induction (Fig. 1A). There was a concomitant reduction in β-catenin protein levels and ERK phosphorylation upon GFP-Axin induction (Fig. 1A). The phosphorylation of upstream regulators of ERK, such as Raf-1 and MEK, were also reduced by GFP-Axin induction (Fig. 1B). Phosphorylation of the ERK pathway components and the level of β-catenin were restored in cells grown in fresh Dox-depleted medium (Fig. 1B, left panel), indicating that coregulation of β-catenin and ERK signaling is a reversible process. The β-catenin and ERK pathway components were not affected by induction of GFP in L929-GFP cells (Fig. 1B, right panel). The levels of phosphorylated Raf-1, MEK, and ERK were elevated in cells expressing increased levels of β-catenin due to Axin siRNA (Fig. 1C), confirming the negative role of Axin in ERK activation. The level of endogenous Axin was low due to rapid protein turnover (30Salahshor S. Woodgett J.R. J. Clin. Pathol. 2005; 58: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), but the low level was detectable when the protein extracts were enriched by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1C). Murine L929 cells display fibroblast morphology characterized as the polygonal/cuboidal phenotype with projection of long, sharp spikes at the cellular periphery. GFP expression alone did not significantly change the cellular morphology (Fig. 2, left two panels). However, expression of GFP-Axin resulted in an altered cellular morphology characterized by a spindle (bipolar) or globular shape (Fig. 2, right two panels). L929-GFP-Axin cells that failed to express GFP-Axin upon Dox treatment (marked by arrows) retained the typical polygonal morphology of L929 cells (Fig. 2). Axin Inhibits the G1 to S Phase Cell Cycle Progression and Growth of L929 Fibroblast Cells Stimulated by EGF—To determine whether Axin affects proliferation via the ERK pathway, we measured the effect of Axin expression on G1 to S phase cell cycle progression stimulated by EGF. EGF treatment increased the proportion of cells in the S phase from 43% to 58% (Fig. 3A). The increase was abolished after introduction of GFP-Axin (Fig. 3A, representative data are shown in the lower panel). EGF with 96-h post-treatment increased the cell numbers 3-fold compared with the untreated cells (Fig. 3B, upper panel). However, the Dox-induced growth stimulation was reduced 70% in cells expressing GFP-Axin (Fig. 3B, upper panel). Treatment of L929-GFP cells with Dox alone did not affect the cell number (Fig. 3B, lower panel), indicating that Dox alone does not inhibit L929 cell growth. Axin Inhibits EGF-induced Activation of the ERK Pathway in L929 Fibroblast Cells and in Primary Hepatocytes—To confirm the role of the ERK pathway in anti-proliferation by Axin, we monitored the effect of Axin induction on activations of ERK pathway components. The phosphorylation levels of Raf-1, MEK, and ERK kinases that were concomitantly increased upon EGF treatment were reduced by GFP-Axin induction followed by a 2-h Dox treatment (Fig. 4A, upper panel). The effects of Axin on the EGF-induced activation of ERK"

The efficacy of such method was tested in rice, and the results presented in the paper indicate high sensitivity in predicting SFP. The sensitivity of polymorphism detection was further demonstrated by the fact that no biasness was observed in detecting SFP with either single or multiple nucleotide polymorphisms. The high density SFP data that can be generated quite effectively by the current method has promise for high resolution genetic mapping studies, as physical location of features are well-defined on rice genome."
https://openalex.org/W3121199369,"Background Significant quantities of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) to treat HIV/AIDS have been procured for Sub-Saharan Africa for the first time in their 20-year history. This presents a novel opportunity to empirically study the roles of brand and generic suppliers in providing access to ARVs. Methodology/Principal Findings An observational study of brand and generic supply based on a dataset of 2,162 orders of AIDS drugs for Sub-Saharan Africa reported to the Global Price Reporting Mechanism at the World Health Organization from January 2004-March 2006 was performed. Generic companies supplied 63% of the drugs studied, at prices that were on average about a third of the prices charged by brand companies. 96% of the procurement was of first line drugs, which were provided mostly by generic firms, while the remaining 4%, of second line drugs, was sourced primarily from brand companies. 85% of the generic drugs in the sample were manufactured in India, where the majority of the drugs procured were ineligible for patent protection. The remaining 15% was manufactured in South Africa, mostly under voluntary licenses provided by brand companies to a single generic company. In Sub-Saharan African countries, four first line drugs in the dataset were widely patented, however no general deterrent to generic purchasing based on a patent was detected. Conclusions/Significance Generic and brand companies have played distinct roles in increasing the availability of ARVs in Sub-Saharan Africa. Generic companies provided most of the drugs studied, at prices below those charged by brand companies, and until now, almost exclusively supplied several fixed-dose combination drugs. Brand companies have supplied almost all second line drugs, signed voluntary licenses with generic companies, and are not strictly enforcing patents in certain countries. Further investigation into how price reductions in second line drugs can be achieved and the cheapest drugs can actually be procured is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2036438792,"Chronic myeloid leukemia is a hematopoietic stem cell cancer, originated by the perpetually “switched on” activity of the tyrosine kinase Bcr-Abl, leading to uncontrolled proliferation and insensitivity to apoptotic stimuli. The genetic phenotype of myeloid leukemic K562 cells includes the suppression of cytosolic sialidase Neu2. Neu2 transfection in K562 cells induced a marked decrease (-30% and -80%) of the mRNA of the anti-apoptotic factors Bcl-XL and Bcl-2, respectively, and an almost total disappearance of Bcl-2 protein. In addition, gene expression and activity of Bcr-Abl underwent a 35% diminution, together with a marked decrease of Bcr-Abl-dependent Src and Lyn kinase activity. Thus, the antiapoptotic axis Bcr-Abl, Src, and Lyn, which stimulates the formation of Bcl-XL and Bcl-2, was remarkably weakened. The ultimate consequences of these modifications were an increased susceptibility to apoptosis of K562 cells and a marked reduction of their proliferation rate. The molecular link between Neu2 activity and Bcr-Abl signaling pathway may rely on the desialylation of some cytosolic glycoproteins. In fact, three cytosolic glycoproteins, in the range 45–66 kDa, showed a 50–70% decrease of their sialic acid content upon Neu2 expression, supporting their possible role as modulators of the Bcr-Abl complex.

The understanding of signals and pathways that regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis is crucial in searching devices capable to control diseases such as cancer. In fact, a raised threshold for apoptosis represents a central step in tumorigenesis, and tumors that possess alterations of the cell death signaling system are often resistant to chemotherapy (1Bremer E. van Dam G. Kroesen B.J. de Leij L. Helfrich W. Trends Mol. Med. 2006; 12: 382-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 2Debatin K.M. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2004; 53: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The evasion of apoptosis in response to death signals is achieved by malignant cells using sets of mutations that inactivate pro-apoptotic proteins or up-regulate anti-apoptotic proteins (3Papadopoulos K. Semin Oncol. 2006; 33: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Chronic myeloid leukemia is a hematopoietic stem cell cancer cytologically characterized by the Philadelphia chromosome, which results from a reciprocal translocation between chromosome 9 and chromosome 22 (4Groffen J. Stephenson J.R. Heisterkamp N. de Klein A. Bartram C.R. Grosveld G. Cell. 1984; 36: 93-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar, 5Shtivelman E. Lifshitz B. Gale R.P. Canaani E. Nature. 1985; 315: 550-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). This mutation leads to the formation of the chimeric fusion protein Bcr/Abl, which manifests an uncontrolled tyrosine kinase activity. The expression of Bcr/Abl also contributes to confer apoptosis resistance after growth factors withdrawal or DNA damage. The ability to escape the normal death program provides a huge proliferative advantage and represents, especially during the accelerated or blast phase of the disease, an obstacle to the successful treatment of this pathology, even when employing the new chemotherapic agent Imatinib (6Ren R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 7Inokuchi K. J. Nippon Med. Sch. 2006; 73: 178-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 8Pasternak G. Hochhaus A.

In fact, Bcr-Abl kinase stimulates a variety of downstream survival pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, Akt, Src kinases, the signal transducers and activators of transcription, and the nuclear factor κB. Activation of these pathways in Bcr-Abl-positive cells results in an increased expression of several anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-XL and Bcl-2, which block the release of cytochrome c from mytochondria, resulting in inactivation of caspases (11Deininger M.W. Goldman J.M. Melo J.V. Blood. 2000; 96: 3343-3356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Salesse S. Verfaillie C.M. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2003; 2: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the context of cancer disease and signaling, ever-increasing attention is being focused not only on mutations involving proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes but also on alterations affecting glycosylation of lipids and proteins, such as Myc and p53 (13Fuster M.M. Esko J.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 526-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar, 14Dube D.H. Bertozzi C.R. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2005; 4: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar, 15Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5309-5318PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, to regulate communication with each other and intracellular signaling, normal cells use the tool to attach specific sugars to lipids and proteins. Conversely, the ability to alter many glycosylation processes is instrumental to cancer cells to bypass the regular checkpoints that control cell life and death (16Wells L. Vosseller K. Hart G.W. Science. 2001; 291: 2376-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). The modification of the sialic acid content of glycoproteins and glycolipids is among the most frequently recognized glycosylation aberrations used by cancer cells to assure proliferation (13Fuster M.M. Esko J.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 526-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar, 15Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5309-5318PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids, such as gangliosides, actively participate in several signal transduction pathways through interaction with tyrosine kinases associated to growth factor receptors (17Allende M.L. Proia R.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Moreover, several sphingolipids such as ceramide and lactosyl-ceramide are protagonists in the apoptotic event (17Allende M.L. Proia R.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 18Lin C.F. Chen C.L. Lin Y.S. Curr. Med. Chem. 2006; 13: 1609-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Moreover, some sialoglycoproteins were recognized to play important roles in the modulation of cell survival (13Fuster M.M. Esko J.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 526-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). For example, some mucins, such as MUC4, have been identified as apoptosis suppressors and important regulators of cellular growth (13Fuster M.M. Esko J.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 526-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that several integrins were also demonstrated to be deeply compromised in their signaling function by an aberrant sialylation profile (15Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5309-5318PubMed Google Scholar). Of course, these findings point to the importance of the enzymes implicated in sialic acid metabolism, including them in the complicate system that controls cell survival and proliferation. Among these enzymes, sialidases attracted a particular interest (19Miyagi T. Wada T. Yamaguchi K. Hata K. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 20: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Sialidases or neuraminidases (EC 3.2.1.18) are capable of hydrolyzing sialic acid from different sialoglycoconjugates and are present in mammals as four isoenzymes, characterized by distinct genes, molecular features, and subcellular localization: Neu1, Neu2, Neu3, and Neu4 (20Achyuthan K.E. Achyuthan A.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 129: 29-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 21Monti E. Preti A. Venerando B. Borsani G. Neurochem. Res. 2002; 27: 649-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Alterations in the expression of all sialidases, with the exception of Neu4, still not fully characterized (22Yamaguchi K. Hata K. Koseki K. Shiozaki K. Akita H. Wada T. Moriya S. Miyagi T. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), were found to occur in several tumors (23Kato T. Wang Y.

J. 2006; 394: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In particular, the cytosolic sialidase Neu2 was unexpressed or repressed in the more aggressive tumors, in correlation with their invasiveness (27Tokuyama S. Moriya S. Taniguchi S. Yasui A. Miyazaki J. Orikasa S. Miyagi T. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 73: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Sawada M. Moriya S. Saito S. Shineha R. Satomi S. Yamori T. Tsuruo T. Kannagi R. Miyagi T. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 97: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In fact, when Neu2 was introduced by transfection in murine melanoma B16-BL6 cells or in mouse colon adenocarcinoma cells, a strong reduction of the metastatic potential of these cells was observed, because of a decrease in ganglioside GM3, a substrate of Neu2 (27Tokuyama S. Moriya S. Taniguchi S. Yasui A. Miyazaki J. Orikasa S. Miyagi T. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 73: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Sawada M. Moriya S. Saito S. Shineha R. Satomi S. Yamori T. Tsuruo T. Kannagi R. Miyagi T. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 97: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although a significant amount of data has been published on sialidase involvement in solid tumors (19Miyagi T. Wada T. Yamaguchi K. Hata K. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 20: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), to the best of our knowledge, the contribution of these enzymes in the pathogenesis of blood cancers such as leukemia has not yet been investigated. We recently reported that sialidase Neu2 is not normally expressed in K562 chronic myeloid leukemic cells (29Tringali C. Anastasia L. Papini N. Bianchi A. Ronzoni L. Cappellini M.D. Monti E. Tettamanti G. Venerando B. Glycoconj. J. 2006; 24: 67-79Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). On these bases, we decided to transfect these cells with Neu2 cDNA and to examine the changes of the biochemical machinery in relationship with the proliferation potential of the same cells. We demonstrated that Neu2 expression in K562 leukemic cells leads to impair Bcr-Abl activity, consequently modifying the signaling cascades stimulated by this oncoprotein. These modifications have marked effects on the apoptotic machinery of K562 cells, inducing a decrease of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL genes expression and, therefore, making the cells more sensitive to apoptotic stimuli. The interaction between Neu2 and these signaling pathways seems to be mediated by the desialylation of specific glycoproteins, promoted by the enzyme. These findings concur to elucidate the importance of glycoproteins and sialidases in the complex mechanism of apoptosis resistance triggered by Bcr-Abl, with possible implications also on the development of new therapeutic strategies against leukemic cells.

Cell Culture and Transfection of HsNeu2 into K562 Cells— The human chronic myeloid leukemic cell line, K562, was purchased from ECACC (European Collection of Cell Culture; Sigma) and cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. cDNAs encoding human Neu2 (Homo sapiens Neu2, HsNeu2) and an activity-defective Neu2, characterized by an inactivating mutation in which Asp46 (pertaining to the active site of the enzyme) was substituted by Ala, were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector. Then 2 × 106 K562 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-Neu2, pcDNA3.1-Neu2(Ala → Asp), or pcDNA3.1 using the DMRIE-C reagent, according to manufacturer’s guidelines. Stable transfectants were isolated after selection with 700 μg/ml geneticin. RNA Extraction and Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit, following the protocol suggested by the manufacturer. Then 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed employing the Improm II reverse transcription system, using random examers. cDNA representing 10 ng of total RNA was used as template for real time PCR, performed using the iCycler thermal cycler (Bio-Rad). PCR mixture included 0.2 μm primers, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.4, 0.8 mm dNTPs, 0.7U iTaq DNA polymerase, 3 mm MgCl2, and SYBR Green (iQ SYBR Green Supermix), in a final volume of 20 μl. Amplification and real time data acquisition were performed using the following cycle conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 10 s at 95 °C and 30 s at 57 °C. The fold change in expression of the different genes in Neu2 expressing cells compared with control cells was normalized to the expression of β-actin RNA and was calculated by the equation 2-ΔΔCt. The primers used for PCR are reported in Table 1. All of the reactions were performed in triplicate. The accuracy was monitored by the analysis of melting curves.TABLE 1Primers used for gene expressionGeneForward primerReverse primerNeu25′-AGAAGGATGAGCACGCAGA-3′5′-GGATGGCAATGAAGAAGAGG-3′Bcl-25′-GAGGATTGTGGCCTTCTTTG-3′5′-CCCAGCCTCCGTTATCCT-3′Bcl-XL5′-ACATCCCAGCTCCACATCAC-3′5′-CGATCCGACTCACCAATACC-3′Bad5′-GTTCCAGATCCCAGAGTTTG-3′5′-CCTCCATGATGGCTGCTG-3′Bcr-Abl5′-GGAGCTGCAGATGCTGACCACC-3′5′-TCAGACCCTGAGGCTCAAAGTC-3′Src5′-CAATGCAGAGAACCCGAGAG-3′5′-TCAGATGAAATTCTTTGGAGAG-3′Lyn5′-CCTATACGAAATTGTCACCTATGG-3′5′-ACGCTCTGTAAGTAGTCAAACG-3′β-Actin5′-CGACAGGATGCAGAAGGAG-3′5′-ACATCTGCTGGAAGGTGGA-3′ Open table in a new tab Sialidase Activity Assay—Mock, Neu2, and Neu2 (Ala → Asp) transfected K562 cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in PBS containing 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The cells were lysated by sonication and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min to eliminate unbroken cells and nuclear components. The crude extract was, subsequently, centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 20 min on TL100 Ultracentrifuge (Beckman) to obtain a cytosolic fraction and a particulate fraction. Aliquots of the supernatant were used for Neu2 sialidase activity determination. Enzymatic activity was assayed using [3H]GD1a, 4-MU-NeuAc, and fetuin as substrates, at pH 5.6 or 7.0, according to Tringali et al. (29Tringali C. Anastasia L. Papini N. Bianchi A. Ronzoni L.

One unit of sialidase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme liberating 1 μmol product/min. Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—3 × 104 Neu2 transfected K562 cells in a volume of 200 μl of medium were centrifuged onto glass slides in a Shandon cytospin centrifuge, briefly air-dried, and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. After three washes with PBS, the cells were incubated for 15 min in 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% saponin in PBS. The cells were then incubated for 1 h with rabbit anti-human Neu2 (1:500) antiserum in 0.5% saponin in PBS and, after extensive washes, with secondary donkey anti-rabbit-Cy2-conjugated antibodies (Jackson Laboratories). The samples were then washed with PBS, and a glass coverslip was mounted with DakoCytomation fluorescent mounting medium (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark). Confocal laser analysis was performed with the Bio-Rad MRC-1024 system, and the acquired images were processed with Adobe Photoshop software. Proliferation Assays—For proliferation assay, 5 × 104 mock, Neu2, and Neu2 (Ala → Asp) transfected K562 cells were seeded in 24-well culture plates, and viable cells were counted every 24 h with Trypan Blue for up to 5 days. To assess thymidine incorporation, 1.2 × 106 cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 plus 10% FBS, 24 h before the assay. Then 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine were added to each well, and after 3 h at 37 °C, the radioactivity incorporated was determined in trichloroacetic insoluble material. Concerning the soft agar colony formation assay, 0.72% bactoagar was melt in 2 ml of RPMI 1640 plus 10% FBS to constitute the hard agar layer and was spread into 35-mm dishes. 1.5 × 105 mock, Neu2, and Neu2 (Ala → Asp) transfected K562 cells were rapidly suspended in 2 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS and 0.36% bactoagar at 37 °C and were distributed onto the hard agar layer. Then the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 2 weeks, and the cell colonies were counted (23Kato T. Wang Y. Yamaguchi K. Milner C.M. Shineha R. Satomi S. Miyagi T. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 92: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Apoptosis Sensitivity Assays—The resistance of mock, Neu2, and Neu2 (Ala → Asp) transfected K562 cells to apoptotic stimuli was evaluated culturing cells under serum depletion conditions, for 72h. For Hoechst 33342 staining, 5 × 105 cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 15 min with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 at room temperature, in the dark. The cells were then observed using an inverted fluorescence microscope (IX50 Olympus) and photographed. To detect caspase 3 activation, 1 × 106cells were harvested and lysed by sonication. The activation was followed using an antibody recognizing the cleavage fragment of caspase-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) (24Kakugawa Y. Wada T. Yamaguchi K. Yamanami H. Ouchi K.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar), 2 × 106 cells were resuspended in 50 mm PIPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, containing 250 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. After 30 min of incubation in ice, the cells were homogenized with a glass Dounce homogenizer. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were subsequently centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 20 min. Supernatants containing cytosolic proteins were separated by electrophoresis, blotted to PVDF membrane, and probed with cytochrome c antibody (Sigma). Metabolic Labeling of Cell Sphingolipids with [1-3H]Sphingosine—[1-3H]Sphingosine, kept in methanol, was dried under a nitrogen stream and dissolved in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS to obtain a final concentration of 3 × 10-8 m (corresponding to 0.4 μCi). 2 × 106 mock, Neu2, and Neu2 (Ala → Asp) transfected K562 cells were incubated in this medium for a 2-h pulse followed by a 24-h chase. The sphingolipid pattern was determined according to Papini et al. (38Papini N. Anastasia L. Tringali C. Croci G. Bresciani R. Yamaguchi K. Miyagi T. Preti A. Prinetti A. Prioni S. Sonnino S.

Glycoprotein Analysis—30 μg of proteins derived from the membrane and cytosolic fractions of mock, Neu2, and Neu2 (Ala → Asp) transfected K562 cells were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. Sialoglycoproteins were visualized employing the digoxigenin glycan differentiation kit, in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. α2–6-Linked sialic acid was identified using the Sambucus nigra agglutinin lectin, whereas α2–3-linked sialic acid was recognized with the Maackia amurensis agglutinin lectin. Western Blot—25 μg of total, cytosolic, or membrane proteins were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE and subsequently transferred onto PVDF membrane. β-Tubulin was used as internal control to ensure equal loading and transfer of proteins. The following antibodies were used for the assays: anti-β-tubulin, anti-Bcl-2 (Sigma), anti-phospho-Bcr (Tyr177), anti-phospho-Src family (Tyr416) (Cell Signaling, Denvers, MA), anti-Tyr(P), anti-Lyn, anti-Src (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-Neu2 (30Monti E. Preti A. Nesti C. Ballabio A. Borsani G. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1313-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The densitometric analysis of blots was performed using Quantity One Software (Bio-Rad). Statistical Analyses—The values are presented as the means ± S.D. Statistical analyses were made using unpaired Student’s t test. Significance was attributed at the 95% level of confidence (p < 0.05). Neu2 Expression in K562 Cells—In a previous work (29Tringali C. Anastasia L. Papini N. Bianchi A. Ronzoni L. Cappellini M.D. Monti E. Tettamanti G. Venerando B. Glycoconj. J. 2006; 24: 67-79Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we demonstrated the absence of endogenous Neu2 sialidase in K562 cells. These findings supported published evidence indicating that many aggressive tumors do not express cytosolic sialidase activity (27Tokuyama S. Moriya S. Taniguchi S. Yasui A. Miyazaki J. Orikasa S. Miyagi T. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 73: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 28Sawada M. Moriya S. Saito S. Shineha R. Satomi S. Yamori T. Tsuruo T. Kannagi R. Miyagi T. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 97: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). On this basis, we decided to explore the biochemical phenotype of K562 cells with regard to malignancy on the same cells transfected with Neu2 cDNA. Following the transfection protocol described in the experimental section, we yielded the isolation of eight stable clones, which were checked for Neu2 mRNA expression by RT-PCR, Neu2 protein by Western blot with anti-Neu2 antibody, and Neu2 catalytic activity by enzymatic assay on the cytosolic fraction (200,000 × g supernatant). We selected for our study the clone named K-Neu2-3, which showed the highest enzymatic activity. As controls, we used stable mock transfectants carrying the pcDNA 3.1 vector alone and a stable clone of K562 cells transfected with Neu2 (Ala → Asp), a mutant form of Neu2 in which Asp46, one of the amino acids characteristic of Neu2 active site (39Chavas L.M.

Chem. 2005; 280: 469-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), was substituted by Ala. The mutated protein was proved to lack completely enzymatic activity. As shown in Fig. 1 (A and B), K-Neu2-3 and K562 cells transfected with Neu2 (Ala → Asp) mutant showed the presence of both the corresponding mRNA and Neu2 as protein. The expression level of Neu2 and mutant Neu2 in the clones was similar, as emerged by the quantification of the respective mRNA and protein content, by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). The Neu2 sialidase expressed by the K-Neu2-3 clone displayed (Fig. 1C) a broad range of substrate recognition, from artificial substrates such as MU-NeuAc (119 ± 10.2 milliunits/mg protein), to gangliosides such as GD1a (103 ± 6.3 milliunits/mg protein), and α2–3 sialoglycoproteins, such as fetuin (5.2 ± 0.4 milliunits/mg protein), with an optimal pH of 5.6 in all cases. Interestingly, Neu2 showed a conspicuous activity toward all the three substrates, also at pH 7.0 (44.6 ± 2.7 milliunits/mg protein with MU-NeuAc, 5.1 ± 0.4 milliunits/mg protein with GD1a, 2.8 ± 0.06 milliunits/mg protein with fetuin), supporting the notion that the living cells acquired an efficient cytosolic sialidase activity. As expected, both mock and mutant transfectants did not present any sialidase activity under the same experimental conditions. To define the cell localization of expressed Neu2, K-Neu2-3 cells were subjected to confocal microscopy analysis. Fig. 1D shows an internal spread staining in a confocal plane of the cells expressing Neu2, clearly indicating a cytosolic distribution of the enzyme. Control experiments showed that the expression of the other sialidases, Neu1 and Neu3, naturally present in K562 cells, was not affected by Neu2-induced expression (data not shown). Neu2 Reduces the Cell Proliferation Rate—Aimed at recognizing the effects of Neu2 activity inside leukemic cells, we first checked the cells growth potential. The investigation was carried out at three different levels: by a growth curve obtained counting viable cells every 24 h, by a measurement of [3H]thymidine incorporation, and by a colony formation assay in soft agar. In all of the assays, the K-Neu2-3 cells revealed an evident impaired proliferation capacity. Growth curve experiments evidenced that after 5 days of culture, the viable cells were significantly less (-55%), as compared with mock cells (Fig. 2A). This important decrease of growth rate may be directly connected to a slowed progression through the cell cycle as shown by a 30% reduction of [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA of the K-Neu2-3 cells (Fig. 2B). Importantly, transfectant cells carrying the activity-defective form of Neu2 showed a proliferation rate and [3H]thymidine uptake practically equal to those of mock cells, suggesting that the reduction of cell proliferation is directly linked to the enzymatic activity of Neu2. This trend was confirmed by the colony formation assay in soft agar because K-Neu2-3 cells produced fewer colonies than mock and Neu2 mutant transfected cells and either died or remained as single cells for up to 2 weeks in culture (Fig. 2C). Neu2 Partially Restores the Susceptibility to Apoptotic Stimuli—Neu2 expressing K562 became less resistant to apoptosis than control cells (Fig. 3)"
https://openalex.org/W1968595500,"TFIID plays a role in nucleating RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex assembly on protein-coding genes. TFIID is a multisubunit complex comprised of the TATA box binding protein (TBP) and 14 TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Another class of multiprotein transcriptional regulatory complexes having histone acetyl transferase (HAT) activity, and containing TAFs, includes TFTC, STAGA and the PCAF/GCN5 complex. Looking for as yet undiscovered subunits by a proteomic approach, we had identified TAF8 and SPT7L in human TFTC preparations. Subsequently, however, we demonstrated that TAF8 was not a stable component of TFTC, but that it is present in a small TAF complex (SMAT), containing TAF8, TAF10 and SPT7L, that co-purified with TFTC. Thus, TAF8 is a subunit of both TFIID and SMAT. The latter has to be involved in a pathway of complex formation distinct from the other known TAF complexes, since these three histone fold (HF)-containing proteins (TAF8, TAF10 and SPT7L) can never be found together either in TFIID or in STAGA/TFTC HAT complexes. Here we show that TAF8 is absolutely necessary for the integration of TAF10 in a higher order TFIID core complex containing seven TAFs. TAF8 forms a heterodimer with TAF10 through its HF and proline rich domains, and also interacts with SPT7L through its C-terminal region, and the three proteins form a complex in vitro and in vivo. Thus, the TAF8-TAF10 and TAF10-SPT7L HF pairs, and also the SMAT complex, seem to be important regulators of the composition of different TFIID and/or STAGA/TFTC complexes in the nucleus and consequently may play a role in gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2107965372,"The core of the exon-junction complex consists of Y14, Magoh, MLN51 and eIF4AIII, a DEAD-box RNA helicase. MLN51 stimulates the ATPase activity of eIF4AIII, whilst the Y14-Magoh complex inhibits it. We show that the MLN51-dependent stimulation increases both the affinity of eIF4AIII for ATP and the rate of enzyme turnover; the KM is decreased by an order of magnitude and kcat increases 30 fold. Y14-Magoh do inhibit the MLN51-stimulated ATPase activity, but not back to background levels. The ATP-bound form of the eIF4AIII-MLN51 complex has a 100-fold higher affinity for RNA than the unbound form and ATP hydrolysis reduces this affinity. MLN51 stimulates the RNA-helicase activity of eIF4AIII, suggesting that this activity may be functionally important."

These findings indicate that p94 protease activity is essential to maintain healthy condition of skeletal muscle. However, the specific physiological functions of p94 as a protease in skeletal muscle remain largely unknown. Skeletal muscles contain highly organized sarcomere structures that consist of systematically expressed myofibrillar proteins. One of the earliest myofibrillar proteins expressed in vertebrate myogenic cells is connectin/titin (9Tokuyasu K.T. Maher P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2795-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), which is the largest protein molecule known and is abundantly expressed in striated muscles where it constitutes an intrasarcomeric filament (10Maruyama K.

During sarcomere assembly, connectin is considered a key molecule for integration of thin filament/Z-band precursors (I-Z-I bodies) and the thick filaments, which are independently assembled in growth tips of elongating myotubes. The N terminus of connectin is located in both I-Z-I body and mature Z, and the C terminus is in the M-line of the thick filament (12Labeit S. Kolmerer B.

Thus, p94 exists in all three regions in sarcomeres, suggesting that p94 may contribute to myofibril organization in cooperation with other connectin ligands and/or connectin. This study aims 1) to characterize the spatiotemporal expression and localization of p94 and its splicing variants during skeletal muscle differentiation in relation to connectin, 2) to identify p94 interacting molecules in the Z-band components, and 3) to clarify the role of the proteolytic activity of p94 in the unique context of muscle cells. Detailed immunohistochemical study using primary cultures of skeletal muscle cells revealed that p94 and its splice variants differ in their expression and localization during maturation of sarcomere structures. It was also demonstrated that correlation between localization of p94 and sarcomere lengths exists, which at least in part involves its protease activity. Experimental Animals—All procedures used for experimental animals were approved by the Experimental Animal Care and Use Committee in the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science. C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Nihon CLEA Inc. Preparation of Mouse Skeletal Muscle Cells—Mouse skeletal muscle cells were prepared as previously described (23Ojima K. Uezumi A. Miyoshi H.

Isolated myogenic cells were cultured on Matrigel (BD Bioscience)-coated Labtech chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International Inc.) or 60-mm dishes (Asahi Techno Glass) in growth medium (20% fetal bovine serum and 0.2 μm ascorbic acid (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd.) in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium). To induce muscle differentiation, the medium was switched to differentiation medium (5% horse serum (Invitrogen) and 0.2 μm ascorbic acid in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium) for further culture. All media were supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen). RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from cultured muscle cells from the quadriceps femoris and the soleus muscles of 15-week-old C57BL6 mice using TRISOL (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA using a First Strand Synthesis kit (GE Healthcare). Primers used to detect p94, splicing variants of p94, connectin, and μ-calpain are shown in Table 1.

The amount of protein was quantified with a DC RC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein from each sample were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred onto Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore Corp.). After blocking, membranes were incubated with antibodies against p94 (anti-pIS2C antibody, 1:1000; further purified anti-pIS2 antibody (21Ono Y. Torii F. Ojima K. Doi N. Yoshioka K. Kawabata Y.

An affinity-purified rabbit anti-p94:ex15-16- antibody was generated using the KLH-conjugated peptide SVDRPVPRPGHT-C, corresponding to the sequence encoded by transcript of exons 14 and 17 of the mouse p94 gene. Subsequently, membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10; Nichirei Inc.) followed by visualization of reacted bands using a POD immunostaining kit (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd). Immunofluorescent Staining—Cultured cells and muscle tissues were fixed and then stained as previously described (23Ojima K. Uezumi A. Miyoshi H. Masuda S. Morita Y. Fukase A. Hattori A. Nakauchi H.

For muscle tissues, longitudinal cryostat sections (7 μm) of EDL muscles from 6-month-old C57BL/6 mice were made.

Alexa-488- or Alexa-555-conjugated secondary antibodies were used (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). Nuclei were stained with TOTO3 or 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (Molecular Probes). Specimens were analyzed on a laser scanning confocal microscopic system (LSM 510; Carl Zeiss Inc.) that employed a Zeiss Axiovert inverted microscope with a Plan-Apochromat 63× (NA 1.4) lens. Images were recorded and processed with LSM510 imaging software. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The cDNA sequence corresponding to the NS domain of human p94 (nucleotides 307-531 of NM_000070, amino acids 1-75) was cloned into pGBKT7 (Clontech). The bait plasmid and a human skeletal muscle cDNA library (HL4010AB, Clontech) were cotransformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH109 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. About 9 × 106 transformants were screened on selection medium plates, SD-LWHA, at 30 °C, yielding 20 grown colonies. Prey plasmids were isolated from these colonies and subjected to DNA sequencing. Three prey plasmids were confirmed for their reproducibility, two of which encoded s-α-actinin (corresponding to amino acids 441-568 in ACTN2); the other encoded von Willebrand factor. Because von Willebrand factor is an extracellular protein secreted by endothelial cells (27Sadler J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 395-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar), we did not further analyze if it indeed interacts with p94 in vivo. Thus, only s-α-actinin was further analyzed as to its interaction with p94. cDNA Constructs for Expression in Mammalian Cells—The cDNA corresponding to full-length human p94, mouse p94 variants lacking exon 6, and/or exons 15 and 16 (p94ΔexX) and their protease-inactive forms, p94: C129S (p94CS) and p94ΔexX:CS, were cloned into pcDNA3.1/N-FLAG vector (28Sato N. Kawahara H. Toh-e A. Maeda T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6662-6671Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The NS domain of human p94 was cloned into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). The cDNA for human s-α-actinin 2 (nucleotides 174-2921 of NM_001103, amino acids 1-894) with an N-terminal Myc tag was cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Immunoprecipitation—Expression vectors for Myc-tagged human s-α-actinin and FLAG-tagged human p94 or green fluorescent proteintagged human p94 NS were transfected into COS7 cells. Cells were harvested 72 h after electroporation and then homogenized in lysis buffer (0.5% digitonin, 50 mm CsCl, 10 mm triethanolamine, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin (pH 7.8)). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants preincubated with protein G-Sepharose (GE Health-care) to absorb nonspecific binding proteins. After centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated with anti-Myc antibody (9E10; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma), or anti-green fluorescent protein antibody (JL-6, Clontech). After incubation with protein G-Sepharose for 60 min, which was omitted when ANTI-FLAG affinity gel was used, immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation. The resin was washed with an excess amount of lysis buffer followed by elution of immunoprecipitated proteins with SDS sample buffer. Transfection into Primary Skeletal Muscle Cells—Transfection was performed using TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus Inc.). On the indicated day, cells were fixed and analyzed by immunofluorescent staining. Quantitative comparison of different sarcomeric localization was performed by the following formula: M-line (N2A) accumulation (%) = the number of sarcomeres that presented accumulation of FLAG-tagged p94 in M-lines (N2A region)/total number of counted sarcomeres. Sarcomere length was measured as the distance between the centers of adjacent M-lines, which is positive for connectin M8M9, using Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscopic imaging software. Calculated ratios were resorted according to sarcomere lengths. In cultured cells expressing p94WT, p94CS, p94Δex6:WT, and p94Δex6:CS, 108, 107, 47, and 86 sarcomeres, respectively, were counted. Transcription of the p94 Gene during Myofibrillogenesis—Expression of p94/calpain 3 and its splicing variants during myofibril development was analyzed by detecting corresponding transcripts in primary mouse skeletal muscle cell culture. Because previous studies have revealed that mouse embryonic muscles express p94 variants without exons 6, 15, and/or 16 (29Herasse M. Ono Y. Fougerousse F. Kimura E. Stockholm D. Beley C. Montarras D. Pinset C. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. Beckmann J.S. Richard I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4047-4055Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), the relative abundance of transcripts resulting from those exon-skipping events was examined (Fig. 1A). Differentiation of cultured cells was confirmed by decreased expression of embryonic MHC compared with the expression of desmin (Fig. 1B) and by the formation of sarcomere structures (see below). In proliferating presumptive myoblasts (PM), i.e. cells before the onset of differentiation, p94 and its splicing variants were hardly detected (Fig. 1, C-F, PM). Predominating among the tested p94 splice isoforms, transcripts for full-length p94 (Fig. 1A, FL) became detectable immediately after induction of muscle differentiation and was observed throughout muscle maturation (Fig. 1, C-F, arrows). Splice isoforms lacking exon 6 (Fig. 1A, Δex6) were recognized from days 1-13 (Fig. 1D, open arrowhead). Splice isoforms lacking exons 15 and 16 (Fig. 1A, Δex15/16) were also observed from days 1-13, but the amount relative to the transcripts with exons 15 and 16 (Fig. 1A, ex15/16+) was very low (Fig. 1E, open arrowhead). The expression of variant transcripts without exons 6, 15, and 16 (Fig. 1A, Δex6/15/16) was slightly detected at day 3 (Fig. 1F). All tested adult skeletal muscles only expressed a full-length p94, i.e. no exon-skipping variants were detectable (Fig. 1, C-F, QC and Sol). In contrast, transcripts of the μ-calpain large subunit gene showed constant expression in all samples (Fig. 1G), consistent with its proposed nature as a housekeeping gene (30Farkas A. Tompa P. Friedrich P. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Changes in the Protein Amounts of p94 Isoforms during Myofibrillogenesis—Next, the expression of protein products corresponding to the p94 transcripts detected above was examined. No 94-kDa full-length p94 protein was detected in cells cultured under proliferating conditions (Fig. 1H, PM). Immediately after the induction of differentiation, full-length p94 was detected (Fig. 1H, arrow), and the amounts of protein were not down-regulated during myofibrillogenesis. In addition, the amounts of protein in the faster migrating bands, possible proteolytic fragments of p94, decreased, suggesting that the stabilization of p94 is facilitated as myofibrillogenesis proceeds (Fig. 1H, closed arrowheads). In adult skeletal muscles, the predominating full-length p94 is coexpressed with lower amounts of shorter isoforms or proteolytic fragments (Fig. 1H, QC). Based on molecular size, the 89-kDa band (Fig. 1H, open arrowhead) could be variants lacking either exon 6, 15, and/or 6 or proteolytic fragments of full-length p94. Therefore, an anti-pΔex15/16 antibody specific for p94 isoforms lacking exons 15 and 16 (Δex15/16) was raised by using a peptide spanning the exon 14-17 junction of the mouse p94 as an antigen (Fig. 1, A and I). The antibody detected the 89-kDa bands (Fig. 1I), and its protein amount gradually decreased during myofibril maturation. In contrast to the results of RT-PCR, anti-pΔex15/16 antibody recognized the 89-kDa band in PM, suggesting that p94Δex15/16 protein might not quickly be degraded and accumulate in PM cells even though the corresponding mRNA expression was extremely low (Fig. 1, C-F). Together, our transcriptional and Western studies indicate that p94Δex isoforms are expressed in immature myotubes, whereas full-length p94 constantly accumulated throughout muscle differentiation. Constant Expression of the Two p94 Binding Sites in Connectin/Titin during Muscle Differentiation—p94 binds to connectin/titin at I82-I83 in the N2A region and at is7 in the M-line (Fig. 2A) (31Kinbara K. Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 32Witt C.C. Ono Y. Puschmann E. McNabb M. Wu Y. Gotthardt M. Witt S.H. Haak M. Labeit D. Gregorio C.C. Sorimachi H. Granzier H. Labeit S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, expression of these regions was also investigated in cultured skeletal muscle cells. N2A connectin was expressed at all stages examined (Fig. 2B). The 559-bp transcripts corresponding to the M-line region with is7 (is7+) were also constantly expressed (Fig. 2C). The 256-bp bands encoding is7-lacking molecules (is7-) were faintly detected in cultured cells. Consistent with previous reports on muscle fiber type-dependent expression of is7 (12Labeit S. Kolmerer B. Science. 1995; 270: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar); both is7+ and is7- variants were expressed at similar levels in the quadriceps femoris, which predominantly consists of fast twitch myofibers, whereas is7+ predominated in the soleus, composed of both fast and slow myofibers (Fig. 2C). These results indicated that the two p94 binding sites in connectin are almost constantly provided during muscle differentiation. Cytosolic but Not Sarcomeric Localization of p94 during Early Myofibrillogenesis—To clarify when p94 is incorporated into specific positions within myofibrils, localization of p94 in cultured myotubes at different stages was analyzed. At day 3, s-α-actinin was observed as punctuated pattern, i.e. the I-Z-I bodies, in emerging growth tips where de novo synthesized myofibrillar proteins are assembled into sarcomere structures (14Ojima K.

Conversely, using an anti-pIS2C antibody, p94 was detected as small granules in the cytosol of whole myotubes without colocalization with s-α-actinin (Fig. 3, B, E, and H). The relationship between p94 and connectin localization was explored by staining myotubes using two different anti-connectin antibodies. The anti-N2A antibody (antigen map in Fig. 2A) detected grainy signals in the growth tips and striated patterns in the shaft of some myotubes (Fig. 3D, bracket and arrows). An anti-M-line connectin (M8M9, antigen map in Fig. 2A) antibody detected striated signals in the shaft of myotubes but none in the growth tips (Fig. 3G, arrows and bracket). No colocalization of p94 with these two regions of connectin was observed (Fig. 3, F and I). At this stage, p94 signals were also detected in myonuclei (Fig. 3, B and H). In summary, p94 was not localized in the Z-bands including the I-Z-I bodies, in the N2A regions, or in the M-lines at this stage, whereas s-α-actinin and connectin were already organized in striated patterns. p94 Is Targeted to the N2A Regions and the M-lines in the Later Stages of Myofibrillogenesis—At day 6 of culture, more than 90% of myotubes showed typical myofibrillar protein localization, with s-α-actinin, connectin N2A, and M8M9, at their proper locations; that is, Z, N2A, and M, respectively. p94 was still detected in the cytosol as granular structures, as seen at day 3, in more than 80% of myotubes, and infrequently, the localization of p94 precisely coincided with the localization of connectin M8M9. At day 10, embryonic MHC was hardly detected in cultured cells by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B), indicating that the cells had become almost fully mature myotubes. In these mature myotubes, in addition to the cytosolic distribution, two main types of p94 positive structures were observed. One was M-line striations coinciding with M8M9 signals (Fig. 3, P-R, arrowheads and arrows). The other was in the I-bands, possibly in the N2A regions (Fig. 3, M-O, brackets and arrows). Intensity in the M-lines was stronger than that in the I-band staining. Localization of p94 in Z was not significant (Fig. 3, J-L). These results indicate that p94 is incorporated into myofibrils after the sarcomere structures are fully mature, through association with above mentioned regions of connectin. Distinct Localization of p94 Isoforms in Sarcomeres—As shown above, expression of p94Δex15/16 was restricted in developing myotubes (see Fig. 1, E, F, and I). Thus, the localization of p94Δex15/16 was examined in cultured myotubes at day 6 (Fig. 4, A-C). The anti-pΔex15/16 antibody captured fuzzy thick striations, which almost overlapped with the s-α-actinin signals at Z (Fig. 4, E and F, brackets) or doublets around Z (Fig. 4, H and I, arrowheads). These data indicate that p94Δex15/16 is probably loca"

Both NOXA and Bim are avid binders of Mcl-1, but a functional linkage between these BH3-only proteins has not yet been reported. In this study, we demonstrate that Mcl-1 binding of endogenously induced NOXA interferes with the ability of Mcl-1 to efficiently sequester endogenous Bim, as Bim is displaced from its complex with Mcl-1. Induced NOXA significantly enhances the UV sensitivity of cells, and the ensuing mitochondrial depolarization is entirely abrogated by Bim knockdown. These results demonstrate a Mcl-1-mediated cross-talk between endogenous NOXA and Bim that occurs upstream of the Bak/Bax-dependent execution of UV-induced mitochondrial depolarization. The current findings demonstrate that the mitochondrial response to an induced expression of NOXA is executed by endogenous Bim and suggest a plausible mechanism for the observed NOXA-Bim linkage.

Mitochondrial involvement in programmed cell death is mediated by mitochondrial alterations that lead to the release of caspase activators and caspase-independent death effectors, which are cumulatively responsible for eventual cell death. The permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane is regulated by pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (1.Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J.

Bcl-2 proteins can be divided into three sub-classes on the basis of their function and the number of Bcl-2 homology (BH) 3The abbreviations used are: BH, Bcl-2 homology domain; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GSI, γ-secretase inhibitor; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; nt, nucleotide(s); RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small interference RNA; JC-1, 1,1′3,3′-tetraethylbenzamidazolocarbocyanin iodide; Tet, tetracycline.3The abbreviations used are: BH, Bcl-2 homology domain; Ab, antibody; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GSI, γ-secretase inhibitor; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; nt, nucleotide(s); RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small interference RNA; JC-1, 1,1′3,3′-tetraethylbenzamidazolocarbocyanin iodide; Tet, tetracycline. domains included in their structure. The anti-apoptotic members, including Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-W, A1, and Mcl-1 contain three or four BH domains; the pro-apoptotic members, including Bax and Bak, possess three BH domains; and the “BH3-only” pro-apoptotic members, such as Bid, Bim, NOXA, and Puma, share homology only within the BH3 domain (5.Cory S. Huang D.C. Adams J.M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8590-8607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Structural studies have suggested that the hydrophobic face of the α-helix formed by the BH3 domain of BH3-only proteins inserts into the hydrophobic groove formed by the BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 members (6.Petros A.M. Olejniczak E.T. Fesik S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1644: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). In response, Bax and Bak form homo-oligomers that are capable of permeabilizing the mitochondrial outer membrane for an egress of mitochondrial apoptotic proteins. Bid and Bim appear to function upstream of Bax and Bak; ectopic expression of these proteins in cells lacking both Bax and Bak could not induce the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c (7.Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). The function of Bcl-2 proteins is also closely tied (in a yet unresolved manner) to the loss in mitochondrial membrane potential that represents an early phase in the apoptotic process (9.Green D.R. Kroemer G. Science. 2004; 305: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2775) Google Scholar, 10.Halestrap A.P. McStay G.P. Clarke S.J.

The electrochemical gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane is critical for normal mitochondrial function and therefore its loss is ultimately associated with cell death.The BH3-only proteins NOXA and Puma have been identified as transcription targets of p53 that are involved in DNA damage-induced apoptosis (11.Villunger A.

NOXA was originally identified as an adult T-cell leukemia-derived phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-responsive gene (12.Hijikata M. Kato N. Sato T. Kagami Y. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4632-4639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and more recently as a p53-induced gene in x-ray-irradiated murine embryo fibroblasts (13.Oda E. Ohki R. Murasawa H. Nemoto J. Shibue T. Yamashita T. Tokino T. Taniguchi T. Tanaka N. Science. 2000; 288: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar). Expression of NOXA is induced by phorbol ester, p53, UV radiation, and other DNA-damaging agents, such as etoposide and doxorubicin (13.Oda E. Ohki R. Murasawa H. Nemoto J. Shibue T. Yamashita T.

The human NOXA gene is located on chromosome 18q21 and encodes a 54-amino acid protein with a single BH3 motif, which is in contrast to the murine NOXA protein that possesses two BH3 domains (13.Oda E.

Both the human and the mouse proteins contain a mitochondrial targeting domain. Following its translocation to the mitochondria, NOXA binds preferentially to Mcl-1, and not to Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL (20.Willis S.N. Chen L. Dewson G. Wei A. Naik E. Fletcher J.I. Adams J.M. Huang D.C.

As Mcl-1 is also a preferred binding target of NOXA, we investigated the relationships between NOXA and Bim in Mcl-1 binding and in mediating mitochondrial apoptotic susceptibility. The current study demonstrates a functional linkage between NOXA and Bim, which is suggested by the apoptotic involvement of Bim downstream of NOXA induction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents−Anti-human Mcl-1 Abs were from Oncogene (Boston, MA; mouse clone RC13 generated against recombinant Mcl-1), and from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA; a polyclonal Ab generated against a 20-amino acid residue synthetic peptide of human Mcl-1). Anti-β-actin mAb (clone AC-15) was purchased from Sigma; anti-Cox IV mAb was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); rabbit anti-Bim Ab was from ProSci (Poway, CA); Bim-specific rat mAb was from Apoptech (San Diego, CA; Clone 14A8); anti-NOXA Ab was from Imgenex (San Diego, CA). Abs to AIF, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, p53 (clone DO-1), and β-tubulin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-Xpress mouse mAb for lacZ was from Invitrogen; [35S]methionine, Protein A-Sepharose beads, and Protein G-Sepharose beads were from Amersham Biosciences. The γ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) consisting of a tripeptide aldehyde, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-norleucine-CHO was from Calbiochem.Cell Lines, Cell Lysates, and Cell Extracts−Jurkat T leukemic cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 20 mm HEPES, 2 mml-glutamine, and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. HeLa, breast carcinoma CAMA-1, colon cancer Hct116, and T-REx-293 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 15% fetal calf serum, 20 mml-glutamine, and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. Transfected T-REx-293 clonal cell lines were maintained in the presence of blasticidin (5 μg/ml) and Zeocin (20 μg/ml). Cell lysates were prepared with 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. To prepare cell extracts, cultured cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in ice-cold buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm sodium EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose, and protease inhibitors). After incubation on ice for 20 min, cells (2.5 × 106/0.5 ml) were disrupted by Dounce homogenization. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 650 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cellular extracts were obtained as the supernatants resulting from centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min.Cellular Fractionation and Mitochondria Purification−To obtain an enriched mitochondrial fraction, Hct116 or T-REx-293 cells were suspended in mitochondrial buffer composed of 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA, and 4 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.4) and lysed by Dounce homogenization as previously described (21.Han J. Goldstein L.A. Gastman B.R. Froelich C.J. Yin X.M. Rabinowich H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22020-22029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei and debris were removed by a 10-min centrifugation at 650 × g, and a pellet containing mitochondria was obtained by two successive spins at 10,000 × g for 12 min. To obtain the S-100 fraction, the postnuclear supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. To obtain the enriched mitochondrial fraction, the mitochondria containing pellet was resuspended in mitochondrial buffer and layered on a Percoll gradient consisting of four layers of 10%, 18%, 30%, and 70% Percoll in mitochondrial buffer. After centrifugation for 30 min at 15,000 × g, the mitochondrial fraction was collected at the 30/70 interface. Mitochondria were diluted in mitochondrial buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (at least a 10-fold dilution required to remove Percoll). The mitochondrial pellet was obtained by a 40-min spin at 20,000 × g and used immediately. Purity was assessed by electron microscopy and by enzyme marker analysis (23.Han J. Goldstein L.A. Gastman B.R. Rabinowich H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10153-10163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). For enzyme analysis, the following enzymes were assayed: aryl sulfatase (lysosomes/granules); N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase, α-l-fucosidase, and β-glucoronidase (lysosome); lactate dehydrogenase (cytosol); cytochrome oxidase or monoamine oxidase (mitochondria); thiamine pyrophosphatase (Golgi); NADH oxidase (endoplasmic reticulum); and dipeptidylpeptidase IV (plasma membrane). The purity was assessed at 95%, with ∼5% or less contamination from the microsomal fraction.Molecular Cloning of Tet-inducible NOXA Expression Plasmid−Total RNA was isolated from Jurkat T-cells using RNA STAT-60 Reagent (Tel-Test B, Inc.). Reverse transcription was carried out with 5 μg of total RNA using an oligo(dT)12–18 primer and SuperScript II RNase H– reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR was performed using the Expand Long Template PCR System kit (Roche Applied Science). A NOXA amplicon containing its open reading frame was generated with the following primer pair (forward and reverse): 5′-CGCGGATCCGCGGAGATGCCTGGGAAG-3′, extends 6 nucleotides (nt) into 5′-untranslated region and 5′-ACGCGTCGACCATGAATGCACCTTCACATTC-3′, complementary to nt 437–457 in 3′-untranslated region (extends 119 nt into the 3′-untranslated region). The putative NOXA amplicon was size-selected using a 1.4% agarose gel, and DNA was purified with the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The purified amplicon was digested with the restriction enzymes BamHI and SalI and ligated into the Tet-inducible vector, pcDNA4/TO (Invitrogen) that had been previously digested with BamH1 and XhoI. Following transformation (Escherichia coli TOP 10F′, Invitrogen), plasmids from randomly picked colonies underwent automated DNA sequence analysis (University of Pittsburgh DNA Sequencing Core Facility) to confirm sequence integrity.Stable Transfection of T-REx-293 Cells with Tet-inducible Plasmids pcDNA4/TO, pcDNA4/TO/lacZ, and pcDNA4/TO/NOXA−The cell line T-REx-293 (Invitrogen) comprises human embryonic kidney cells that stably express the Tet repressor. To generate stable clones that harbor the pcDNA4/TO vector control, pcDNA4/TO/lacZ expression control (Invitrogen) and pcDNA4/TO/NOXA, all plasmids were linearized using the restriction enzymes FspI (pcDNA4/TO and pcDNA4/TO/NOXA) and ScaI (pcDNA4/TO/lacZ). Transfection was carried out using 30 μl of GenePorter Transfection Reagent (Gene Therapy Systems Inc., San Diego, CA) following the manufacturer’s directions and 5 μg of linearized plasmid in 6-well plates with 0.8 × 106 cells per well (∼60% confluency) that were maintained in the presence of 5 μg/ml blasticidin. At 48 h post-transfection Zeocin was added to a final concentration of 100–200 μg/ml. After ∼2 weeks individual colonies were selected, expanded, and harvested. Induction of NOXA and lacZ expression by individual clones was confirmed by immunoblotting after the addition of 1 μg/ml tetracycline for 16 h. Confirmation of stable clones containing integrated pcDNA4/TO vector was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR of their total RNA. We utilized a primer pair that delimits the Zeocin resistance gene open reading frame in pcDNA4/TO (forward and reverse): 5′-ACCATGGCCAAGTTGACCAGT-3′, corresponds to nt 2247–2267 and 5′-GAAATCTCGTAGCACGTGTCA-3′, complementary to nt 2622–2642. Multiple such clones were utilized in the studies to confirm the described findings.RNAi Using NOXA, Mcl-1, Bim, Bak, and Bax siRNAs and a Non-targeting siRNA−NOXA, Mcl-1, and Bim siRNAs were obtained as duplexes in purified and desalted form (Option C) from Dharmacon. The three siRNAs had the following sense strand sequences: NOXA, 5′-GUCGAGUGUGCUACUCAACUdTdT-3′; Mcl-1, 5′-GAAACGCGGUAAUCGGACUdTdT-3′; and Bim, 5′-GACCGAGAAGGUAGACAAUUGdTdT-3′. Bak and Bax siRNAs were also obtained from Dharmacon but as siGENOME SMARTpool reagents M-003305-01 and M-003308-00, respectively. The non-targeting siRNA control used in our RNAi experiments is the siCONTROL Non-Targeting siRNA #1 (D-001210-01) from Dharmacon. Hct116 or T-REx-293 cells (2.5 × 105) were plated in a 6-well plate, and following 16 h (at ∼30% confluency) were transfected with 200 nm siRNA in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) without fetal calf serum using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s transfection protocol. After 4 h, fetal calf serum was added to a final concentration of 10%. At 40 h, the medium over the cells was adjusted to 1 ml before the addition of an apoptotic agent.UV Irradiation−T-REx-293 cells were irradiated with UV light from a germicidal lamp, which emitted radiation primarily in the UVC region, with a peak wavelength of 254 nm. The total dose of irradiation was 60 J/m2 as measured by a Black-Ray UV meter, model J225 (UVP Inc., Upland, CA).In Vitro Transcription-Translation−Mcl-1, NOXA, Bim, and Bak cDNAs were expressed in the TnT T7 transcription-translation reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). Each coupled transcription-translation reaction contained 1 μg of plasmid DNA in a final volume of 50 μl in a methionine-free reticulocyte lysate reaction mixture supplemented with 35S-labeled methionine according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After incubation at 30 °C for 90 min, the reaction products were immediately used or stored at –78 °C.Western Blot Analysis−Proteins in cell lysates, cell extracts, mitochondria, or S-100 were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, as previously described (24.Johnson D.E. Gastman B.R. Wieckowski E. Wang G.Q. Amoscato A. Delach S.M. Rabinowich H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1818-1823PubMed Google Scholar). Following probing with a specific primary Ab and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab, the protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce).Flow Cytometry−Cytofluorometric analyses of apoptosis were performed by co-staining with propidium iodide and fluorescein isothiocyanate-Annexin V conjugates (BD Biosciences). Mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization was measured by utilizing a fluorescent cationic dye, 1,1′3,3′-tetraethylbenzamidazolocarbocyanin iodide (JC-1, Molecular Probes). The staining was performed according to the manufacturer’s procedures, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was quantified by flow cytometric analysis of the decrease in the 590 nm (red)/527 nm (green) fluorescence intensity emission ratio utilizing a Beckman Coulter Epics XL-MCL and analyzed with the EXPO32 software.RESULTSInvolvement of Mcl-1, NOXA, and Bim in GSI-mediated Changes in Mitochondrial Membrane Potential−To investigate the role of NOXA in mitochondrial apoptotic events, we treated several tumor cell lines with GSI, which was recently reported to mediate apoptosis in association with induced expression of NOXA (18.Qin J.Z. Stennett L. Bacon P. Bodner B. Hendrix M.J. Seftor R.E. Seftor E.A. Margaryan N.V. Pollock P.M. Curtis A. Trent J.M. Bennett F. Miele L. Nickoloff B.J. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 895-902PubMed Google Scholar). This drug is a tripeptide aldehyde that was initially identified as an inhibitor of Notch signaling (25.Curry C.L. Reed L.L. Golde T.E. Miele L. Nickoloff B.J. Foreman K.E. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 6333-6344Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 26.Kang J.H. Lee da H. Lee J.S. Kim H.J. Shin J.W. Lee Y.H. Lee Y.S. Park C.S. Chung I.Y. Eur. J.

Bodner B. Hendrix M.J. Seftor R.E. Seftor E.A. Margaryan N.V. Pollock P.M. Curtis A. Trent J.M. Bennett F. Miele L. Nickoloff B.J. Mol.

In our studies, this aldehyde inhibitor induced a significant level of apoptosis in most of the treated tumor cell lines (Fig. 1, A and B). GSI-induced apoptosis was associated with NOXA induction in four of five treated cell lines, whereas only a low level of apoptosis was detected in CAMA-1 cells, where NOXA was not induced. Induction of p53 accompanied that of NOXA in WT Hct116, but NOXA up-regulation can also be independent of p53, as was determined in a p53 knock-out-Hct116 clonal cell line (p53–/–) and in Jurkat cells (p53-null). Moreover, despite p53 expression, there was no induction of NOXA by GSI in CAMA-1 cells. GSI enhanced the Mcl-1 expression levels in both Hct116 clonal cell lines (WT and p53–/–), in CAMA-1 and in HeLa cells, whereas in Jurkat cells it mediated Mcl-1 degradation. Bim was up-regulated following treatment with GSI in Hct116 clonal cell lines, unchanged in CAMA-1 cells, and down-regulated in Jurkat and HeLa cells. These observations illustrate the occurrence of multiple changes in the expression levels of mitochondrial apoptosis regulatory proteins in response to a single drug and suggest that these differential alterations are cell-type specific.Because GSI induced a significant apoptotic level in Hct116 cells in association with up-regulated expression of the mitochondrial Bcl-2 members, Mcl-1, NOXA, and Bim, we investigated the roles of these proteins in the regulation of mitochondrial membrane potential in these cells. To this end, RNAi was carried out on WT Hct116 cells with siRNA specific for Mcl-1, NOXA, and Bim or with a non-targeting siRNA control. During the last 16 h of the siRNA transfection, the cells were treated with GSI and assessed by immunoblotting for the expression levels of the targeted proteins and by JC-1 flow cytometry for changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 1, C and D). JC-1 is a lipophilic fluorochrome that, upon mitochondrial binding, emits a green fluorescent signal, which is further processed to an additional red fluorescent signal only in mitochondria with preserved membrane potential. Thus, mitochondria with intact membrane potential emit high green and high red fluorescence, whereas loss of mitochondrial membrane potential results in reduced emission of red fluorescence while maintaining the high green fluorescence. Mcl-1 siRNA increased the loss in red fluorescence in response to GSI, whereas knockdown of either NOXA or Bim significantly inhibited the GSI-mediated loss in mitochondrial membrane potential. These observations suggest that the changes in mitochondrial membrane potential in response to GSI are jointly regulated by Mcl-1, NOXA, and Bim. However, because of the multiple concurrent changes in the expression of these mitochondrial apoptosis regulators, the drug-induced cell is not an optimal system for analyzing the functional relationship between NOXA and Bim.Elucidation of NOXA Apoptotic Implications in Tet-induced NOXA-transfected Cells−To elucidate a potential role for NOXA in mitochondrial apoptotic events, we utilized a tetracycline-regulated expression (T-REx) system consisting of the T-REx-293 (human embryonic kidney epithelial cells stably transfected with the Tet repressor) clonal cell line stably transfected with NOXA or the empty inducible vector whose expression is switched on by the presence of tetracycline. Similar to GSI-induced NOXA, Tet-induced NOXA accumulated exclusively in the mitochondria (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast to GSI-induced NOXA, Tet-induced NOXA was not associated with increased expression of Bim, p53, or Mcl-1 (Figs. 2B and 3C). Furthermore, induction of NOXA alone did not result in cell death or a release of mitochondrial apoptogenic proteins.FIGURE 2Apoptotic implications of mitochondrial translocation of GSI- or Tet-induced NOXA. A, mitochondrial translocation of GSI-induced NOXA is associated with cytochrome c release. GSI-treated Jurkat cells (5 μm, 16 h) were disrupted by Dounce homogenization followed by a purification process for mitochondria and S-100 fractions. The extract, mitochondrial (Mit) and S-100 fractions of either control or GSI-treated cells were assessed for the expression of the indicated proteins. Expression of β-actin (cytosolic protein) and Cox IV (mitochondrial protein) serve as markers for equal loading and purity of the cellular fractions. B, mitochondrial translocation of Tet-induced NOXA is not associated with release of apoptogenic proteins or changes in expression of Bim or p53. T-REx-293 cells stably transfected with either Tet-inducible NOXA or its vector control were treated with tetracycline (1μg/ml for 16 h). The cells were then disrupted by Dounce homogenization and subcellular fractionated as described in A. The same membrane was stripped and reprobed successively for the indicated proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Co-immunoprecipitation of NOXA with Mcl-1. A, GSI-induced NOXA co-immunoprecipitates with endogenous Mcl-1. Hct116 cells were treated with GSI (5 μm, 16 h). The lysates of control and GSI-treated cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with Mcl-1-specific mouse mAb. The original lysates, depleted supernatants, and immunoprecipitated pellets were assessed by immunoblotting for the expression of Mcl-1 (using rabbit anti-Mcl-1 Ab, top). The membrane was stripped and reprobed with NOXA-specific mouse mAb (bottom). B, in vitro translated NOXA co-immunoprecipitates with in vitro translated Mcl-1. The 35S-labeled in vitro translated Mcl-1 was mixed with unlabeled in vitro translated NOXA and subjected to immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-Mcl-1 Ab. The original mixture, depleted supernatant, and immunoprecipitated pellet were assessed by immunoblotting for the presence of Mcl-1 (top) and NOXA (middle), and by autoradiography for the radioactive signal generated by 35S-labeled Mcl-1 (bottom). C, Tet-induced NOXA co-immunoprecipitates with endogenous Mcl-1. T-REx-293 cells stably transfected with Tet-inducible control or with Tet-inducible NOXA were treated with tetracycline (1 μg/ml, 16 h). The cells were then lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation by rabbit anti-Mcl-1 Ab. The original lysates, depleted supernatants, and immunoprecipitated pellets were assessed by immunoblotting for expression of Mcl-1 and NOXA. β-Actin serves as an equal loading control. All immunoprecipitation procedures were performed after pre-clearance with protein A/G-Sepharose beads and nonspecific rabbit or mouse Ig. The ratio of cell lysate (Input) gel loading to that of the immunoprecipitation (IP) pellet was 1:4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Recently, NOXA was reported to bind exclusively to Mcl-1, and not to Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL (20.Willis S.N.

To investigate the ability of drug-induced NOXA and Tet-induced NOXA to bind Mcl-1, we immunoprecipitated Mcl-1 in three experimental systems, including GSI-treated Hct116 cells (Fig. 3A), a mixture of in vitro translated Mcl-1 and NOXA proteins (Fig. 3B), and T-REx-293 cells expressing Tet-induced NOXA or Tet-vector control (Fig. 3C). In each of these experimental systems, Mcl-1 was efficiently immunoprecipitated, because it was completely depleted from the remaining supernatants (Fig. 3, A (lane 7 top), B (lane 4 top), and C (lanes 4–6 top)). GSI-induced NOXA was entirely co-immunoprecipitated with Mcl-1 (Fig. 3A, lanes 6–8 bottom), whereas Tet-induced NOXA was partly, although significantly, co-immunoprecipitated with Mcl-1 (Fig. 3C, lanes 3, 6, and 9). It is possible that the expression level of Tet-induced NOXA is excessive relative to that of endogenous Mcl-1, and thus a significant proportion of the induced NOXA remains Mcl-1-free.Previous studies performed by others (28.Opferman J.T.

https://openalex.org/W2041351554,"Neisseria meningitidis, a causative agent of bacterial meningitis, has a relatively small repertoire of transcription factors, including NMB0573 (annotated AsnC), a member of the Lrp-AsnC family of regulators that are widely expressed in both Bacteria and Archaea. In the present study we show that NMB0573 binds to l-leucine and l-methionine and have solved the structure of the protein with and without bound amino acids. This has shown, for the first time that amino acid binding does not induce significant conformational changes in the structure of an AsnC/Lrp regulator although it does appear to stabilize the octameric assembly of the protein. Transcriptional profiling of wild-type and NMB0573 knock-out strains of N. meningitidis has shown that NMB0573 is associated with an adaptive response to nutrient poor conditions reflected in a reduction in major surface protein expression. On the basis of its structure and the transcriptional response, we propose that NMB0573 is a global regulator in Neisseria controlling responses to nutrient availability through indicators of general amino acid abundance: leucine and methionine."
https://openalex.org/W2145584982,"Large numbers of bats are killed by collisions with wind turbines, and there is at present no direct method of reducing or preventing this mortality. We therefore determine whether the electromagnetic radiation associated with radar installations can elicit an aversive behavioural response in foraging bats. Four civil air traffic control (ATC) radar stations, three military ATC radars and three weather radars were selected, each surrounded by heterogeneous habitat. Three sampling points matched for habitat type and structure, dominant vegetation species, altitude and surrounding land class were located at increasing distances from each station. A portable electromagnetic field meter measured the field strength of the radar at three distances from the source: in close proximity (<200 m) with a high electromagnetic field (EMF) strength >2 volts/metre, an intermediate point within line of sight of the radar (200-400 m) and with an EMF strength <2 v/m, and a control site out of sight of the radar (>400 m) and registering an EMF of zero v/m. At each radar station bat activity was recorded three times with three independent sampling points monitored on each occasion, resulting in a total of 90 samples, 30 of which were obtained within each field strength category. At these sampling points, bat activity was recorded using an automatic bat recording station, operated from sunset to sunrise. Bat activity was significantly reduced in habitats exposed to an EMF strength of greater than 2 v/m when compared to matched sites registering EMF levels of zero. The reduction in bat activity was not significantly different at lower levels of EMF strength within 400 m of the radar. We predict that the reduction in bat activity within habitats exposed to electromagnetic radiation may be a result of thermal induction and an increased risk of hyperthermia."
https://openalex.org/W2049226316,"In the brain, aquaporin-1 (AQP-1), a water channel for high osmotic water permeability, is mainly expressed in the apical membrane of the ventricular choroid plexus and regulates formation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Although the physiology of AQP-1 has been the subject of several publications, much less is known about the trans-acting factors involved in the control of AQP-1 gene expression. Here we report that TTF-1, a homeodomain-containing transcriptional regulator, is coexpressed with AQP-1 in the rat brain choroid plexus and enhances AQP-1 gene transcription by binding to conserved core TTF-1-binding motifs in the 5′-flanking region of the AQP-1 gene. Intracerebroventricular administration of an antisense TTF-1 oligodeoxynucleotide significantly decreased AQP-1 synthesis and reduced CSF formation. In addition, blockade of TTF-1 synthesis increased survival of the animals following acute water intoxication-induced brain edema. These results suggest that TTF-1 is physiologically involved in the transcriptional control of AQP-1, which is required for CSF formation. In the brain, aquaporin-1 (AQP-1), a water channel for high osmotic water permeability, is mainly expressed in the apical membrane of the ventricular choroid plexus and regulates formation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

Most CSF in the cerebral ventricular system is formed in discrete sites, including the choroid plexus and circumventricular organs of the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles. Altogether, these sites produce nearly 90% of all ventricular CSF (1Brown P.D. Davies S.L. Speake T. Millar I.D. Neuroscience. 2004; 129: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). CSF has several important functions. Foremost, it provides a mechanical cushion to protect the brain from impact with the bony calvarium when the head moves (2Segal M.B. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1993; 16: 617-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and also serves as a flexible physical support for the brain. In addition, it facilitates the transport of nutrients, peptides, and hormones into the brain. Because CSF communicates with the interstitial fluid of the brain, it plays an important role in maintaining a constant external environment for neurons and glia (3Johanson C.E. Preston J.E. Chodobski A. Stopa E.G. Szmydynger-Chodobska J. McMillan P.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C82-C90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of brain water content and brain volume is critical for normal functioning of the central nervous system, which is highly sensitive to any change in fluid osmolality. Aquaporins (AQPs), a family of small integral membrane proteins, have been implicated in the regulation of water homeostasis in the brain (4Venero J.L. Vizuete M.L. Machado A. Cano J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 63: 321-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have shown that the expression of AQP-1, -4, and -9 is sensitive to brain injury, swelling, and other experimental interventions that affect the homeostatic regulation of brain water balance (5Arima H. Yamamoto N. Sobue K. Umenishi F. Tada T. Katsuya H. Asai K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44525-44534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 6Gunnarson E. Zelenina M.

Chem. 2005; 280: 13906-13912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). AQP-1, a water channel for high osmotic water permeability, is abundantly present in the epithelium of kidney, lung, eye, liver, and brain (8Umenishi F. Verkman A.S. Gropper M.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). AQP-1 was first discovered in human erythrocytes (9Preston G.M. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11110-11114Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). In the brain, AQP-1 is mainly expressed in the apical (CSF-facing) membrane of the ventricular choroid plexus epithelium and regulates the formation of CSF (10Speake T. Freeman L.J. Brown P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1609: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 11Oshio K. Watanabe H. Song Y. Verkman A.S. Manley G.T. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 76-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying the transcriptional control of AQP-1 gene expression in the brain, however, are poorly understood. We report that thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), a homeodomain-containing transcription factor, regulates AQP-1 gene transcription in the choroid plexus. TTF-1 was first identified in the thyroid gland (12Civitareale D. Lonigro R. Sinclair A.J. DiLauro R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2537-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and its cDNA was cloned and characterized as having sequence homology with the Drosophila NKx-2 homeodomain transcription factor (13Guazzi S. Price M. De Felice M. Damante G. Mattei M.G. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). A different study identified the lung and fetal diencephalon as additional sites of TTF-1 expression (14Lazzaro D. Price M. de Felice M. Di Lauro R. Development (Camb.). 1991; 113: 1093-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We and others have reported that TTF-1 remains expressed in the discrete regions of the postnatal rat brain (15Lee B.J. Cho G.J. Norgren Jr., R.B. Junier M.P. Hill D.F. Tapia V. Costa M.E. Ojeda S.R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 107-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 16Nakamura K. Kimura S. Yamazaki M. Kawaguchi A. Inoue K. Sakai T. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2001; 130: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). More recently, we showed that TTF-1 is expressed in the subfornical organ where it regulates angiotensinogen synthesis (17Son Y.J. Hur M.K. Ryu B.J. Park S.K. Damante G. D'Elia A.V. Costa M.E. Ojeda S.R. Lee B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27043-27052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). During the course of these experiments, we noticed the presence of TTF-1 mRNA in the rat choroid plexus, and thus we examined the 5′-flanking region of the AQP-1 gene; we found several conserved core TTF-1-binding motifs. Promoter analysis performed in the BAS8.1 (astrocyte) and C6 (glioblastoma) cell lines showed that TTF-1 activated AQP-1 transcription in a dose-dependent manner. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that TTF-1 bound specific subsets of putative DNA recognition sites in the AQP-1 promoter. In vivo experiments in which inhibition of TTF-1 synthesis was achieved by administration of antisense (AS) oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) into the lateral ventricle decreased AQP-1 synthesis and, in turn, led to a decrease in CSF formation. Animals and Tissue Preparation—Two-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (Daehan Animal Breeding Co., Chungwon, Korea) were used in this study. Following arrival, rats were housed in a room with a conditioned photoperiod (12-h light/12-h darkness, lights on from 600 to 1800 h) and temperature (23–25 °C) and allowed ad libitum access to tap water and pelleted rat chow. Animals were sacrifice, and the choroid plexus was collected from their brains. The tissues were quickly frozen on dry ice and stored at -80 °C until RNA or protein isolation was performed. Some brain samples were placed in embedding medium (Tissue-Tek, Torrance, CA) and frozen by placing them in 2-methylbutane (isopentane) immersed in liquid nitrogen for 2 min and then stored in a -80 °C freezer for cryosectioning at a later time. Twelve-μm cryostat sections were prepared, maintaining the cryostat temperature at -20 °C, and were mounted onto SuperFrost slides (Fisher). The slides were kept at -80 °C until used for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). PCR Cloning of TTF-1 and AQP-1 cDNA Fragments and 5′-Flanking Region of the AQP-1 Gene—A cDNA fragment derived from TTF-1 mRNA was cloned by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR from rat hypothalamic RNA. The specific primer sets (sense primer, 5′-AAC AGT CAA GCA AAT CCA AC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-AAT ACC AAA CCG TGG AGT AA-3′) were designed to generate a 552-bp TTF-1 cDNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 1669–2220 in rat TTF-1 mRNA (NCBI GenBank™ accession number X53858). A rat AQP-1 cDNA fragment was also cloned by RT-PCR from rat choroid plexus RNA. The specific primer set (sense primer, 5′-AGC GAA ATC AAG AAG AAG C-3′; antisense primer, 5′-ATA TCA TCA GCA TCC AGG TC-3′) generates a 773-bp AQP-1 cDNA fragment corresponding to nucleotides 7–779 in rat AQP-1 mRNA (NCBI GenBank™ data base, accession number NM_012778). The cDNA fragments were cloned into a pEZ-T vector (RNA Corp., Seoul, Korea); constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The proximal promoter of the human AQP-1 gene (-1779 to +22 bp) that was to be employed for promoter analysis was also cloned by PCR from human genomic DNA using the sequence information deposited in the NCBI GenBank™ data base (accession number AF026479). The sense primer was 5′-ACT TAT GAC CTT CGG CCA CC-3′, and the antisense primer was 5′-GGT GCT CAA TTC CCT CTG AG-3′. The 1802-nucleotide-long PCR product was inserted into a luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL-3 basic, Promega, Madison, WI), and its sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Fourteen AQP-1 promoter constructs containing individually mutated core TTF-1-binding motifs were generated using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions; the intended mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH)—The TTF-1 cDNA template described above was linearized by SpeI and NcoI digestion for the production of either sense or antisense RNA probes, respectively, and the AQP-1 cDNA was linearized using either NotI or SalI. In vitro transcription of digoxygenin (DIG)-labeled or fluorescein-labeled cRNA probes was performed using an RNA labeling mix (Roche Applied Science) and T3 and T7 RNA polymerases (Promega). Tissue sections were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, for 10 min. Following two 5-min washes with PBS, the slides were incubated in a 0.25% acetylation solution for 10 min to reduce ionic background. After acetylation, the sections were washed three times in 2× SSPE (pH 7.4, 0.3 m NaCl, 20 mm NaH2PO4, 2 mm EDTA) for 5 min and dehydrated in ascending ethanol concentrations (75, 90, and 100%, 2 min each). To reduce nonspecific background, prehybridization was performed in hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 2× SSPE, 1× Denhardt’s solution, 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 100 μg/ml polyadenylic acid, 500 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 4 units/ml RNase inhibitor) at 60 °C for 3 h. The hybridization procedure was performed overnight at 60 °C using 200 μl of hybridization solution containing 300 ng of probe (a DIG-labeled cRNA probe to detect TTF-1 mRNA or a fluorescein-labeled cRNA probe to detect AQP-1 mRNA). The next morning the sections were incubated in 50% formamide and 2× SSPE at 62 °C for 1 h and washed with 0.2× SSPE and 0.1× SSPE (30 min each) at 62 °C. After the last washing step, to reduce endogenous peroxidase activity, the slides were incubated with 1% H2O2 in TNT buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.3% Triton X-100) for 30 min and washed three times with TNT buffer for 5 min each. A blocking step with TNB blocking buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5% Blocking Reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences)) for 1 h at room temperature was followed by 1 h of incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-DIG antibody (a final concentration of 1.5 milliunits/ml; Roche Applied Science) or with HRP-conjugated anti-fluorescein antibody (0.75 milliunits/ml; Roche Applied Science) in TNB blocking buffer. After washing three times in TNT buffer for 5 min each, mRNA signals of TTF-1 and AQP-1 were detected by using a Cy3-labeled and FITC-labeled tyramide signal amplification system, respectively (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Simultaneous Detection of TTF-1 and AQP-1 Transcripts Using Double FISH—To visualize mRNA expression of these two genes, sections were hybridized simultaneously with a DIG-labeled TTF-1 cRNA probe and a fluorescein-labeled AQP-1 cRNA probe. The detailed procedure for detection of each probe is described above. Briefly, the DIG-labeled TTF-1 probe was detected by incubating with HRP-conjugated DIG antibody (anti-DIG-HRP). After incubation with Cy3-coupled tyramide to detect the DIG-labeled TTF-1 probe, the sections were washed three times in TNT buffer for 5 min each. To quench the peroxidase activity of anti-DIG-HRP, the sections were incubated with 2% H2O2 in TNT buffer for 2 h and washed three times in TNT buffer for 5 min each. To detect fluorescein-labeled AQP-1 probe, sections were then placed in TNB blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-fluorescein antibody for 1 h. After washing three times in TNT buffer for 5 min each, signals were detected by incubating with FITC-coupled tyramide. Finally, the slides were dipped in Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) solution for visualization of cell nuclei. Microscopy and Imaging—FISH images were captured with an InfinityX CCD camera (Lumenera Corp., Ontario, Canada) attached to an Axioskop2 Plus fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Merged images were analyzed using i-solution (iMTechnology, Seoul, Korea) image processing software. The Cy3 fluorescence image was visualized with a 546-nm green excitation filter set. FITC signal was observed with a 450–490-nm blue excitation filter set. Hoechst 33258 fluorescence emission from cell nuclei was observed with a 365-nm excitation filter. In addition, confocal microscope images were acquired using a Fluoview FV500 confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Further image processing was carried out using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 software. No selective visual enhancement of specific area or cells was applied to the images. Cell Culture and Assays for Luciferase Activity—BAS8.1 and C6 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and the cultures were maintained at either 34 °C (BAS8.1 cells) or 37 °C (C6 cells) in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. Twenty four h after seeding the cells in 12-well plates, they were transiently transfected with the AQP-1 promoter-luciferase reporter construct (AQP-1-P) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) along with different concentrations (100–400 ng/well) of the expression vector pcDNA 3.1-zeo (Invitrogen) containing the TTF-1 coding region (TTF-1-pcDNA) (15Lee B.J. Cho G.J. Norgren Jr., R.B. Junier M.P. Hill D.F. Tapia V. Costa M.E. Ojeda S.R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 107-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was normalized by cotransfecting the β-galactosidase reporter plasmid (pCMV-β-gal; Clontech) at 20 ng/ml. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and used for both luciferase and β-galactosidase assays as described previously (18Kim M.S. Hur M.K. Son Y.J. Park J.I. Chun S.Y. D'Elia A.V. Damante G. Cho S. Kim K. Lee B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36863-36871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cells containing different combination of vectors were simultaneously cultured and assayed for each experiment. In each case, we used 6 wells per condition, and each experiment was repeated 2–3 times. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The procedure for expression and purification of the TTF-1 homeodomain (TTF-1HD) protein has been described previously (19Damante G. Pellizzari L. Esposito G. Fogolari F. Viglino P. Fabbro D. Tell G. Formisano S. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4992-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides 5′-labeled with 32P were used as probes. Sequences of the oligodeoxynucleotides employed are shown in Table 1. Oligodeoxynucleotides C and Cβ were used as a positive and negative control, respectively (20Pellizzari L. Tell G. Damante G. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 253-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EMSA was performed as described previously (17Son Y.J. Hur M.K. Ryu B.J. Park S.K. Damante G. D'Elia A.V. Costa M.E. Ojeda S.R. Lee B.J. J. Biol.

Electrophoretically separated signals corresponding to the protein-bound and free DNA were quantitated with Multianalyst software. Binding of TTF-1HD to the oligodeoxynucleotides representing different regions of the AQP-1 promoter was expressed as a percentage of TTF-1HD binding to oligodeoxynucleotide C, which contains the core TTF-1 binding domain and flanking region of the thyroglobulin gene promoter (12Civitareale D. Lonigro R. Sinclair A.J. DiLauro R.

Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar), utilizing the mixture of protease inhibitors recommended by Kuhn et al. (22Kuhn R. Monuki E.S. Lemke G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4642-4650Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The binding assay was performed as described previously (17Son Y.J. Hur M.K. Ryu B.J. Park S.K. Damante G. D'Elia A.V. Costa M.E. Ojeda S.R. Lee B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27043-27052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), using 15 μg of protein and 20,000 cpm of probe (-724 in Table 1). To further confirm the presence of immunoreactive TTF-1 in the nuclear extracts, the proteins were incubated with 1 μl of undiluted TTF-1 antiserum (NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA) or preimmune serum for 30 min at room temperature before initiating the binding reactions. Intracerebroventricular Administration of AS TTF-1 ODN—To determine the effect of blocking TTF-1 expression on AQP-1 synthesis and formation of CSF, a phosphorothioate AS TTF-1 ODN (GenoTech Corp., Daejeon, Korea) was delivered into the lateral ventricle of adult male rats. The AS TTF-1 ODN used to disrupt TTF-1 synthesis (5′-GAC TCA TCG ACA TGA TTC GGC GTC-3′) was directed against the sequence surrounding the first ATG codon of TTF-1 mRNA as reported previously (17Son Y.J. Hur M.K. Ryu B.J. Park S.K. Damante G. D'Elia A.V. Costa M.E. Ojeda S.R. Lee B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27043-27052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 18Kim M.S.

As a control, a scrambled (SCR) sequence of identical base composition was used (5′-AGT CCT ACT CGG TAC GTA TGC AGC-3′). For the intracerebroventricular injection, ODNs were diluted to a final concentration of 1 nmol/μl in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (in mm, 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.24 NaH2PO4, 1.3 MgSO4, 2.4 CaCl2, 26 NaHCO3, 10 d-glucose, pH 7.3, and bubbled with 95% air, 5% CO2). Injections were performed under pentobarbital (7.5 mg/kg body weight) and ketamine hydrochloride (25 mg/kg body weight) anesthesia. A polyethylene cannula (outer diameter of 1.05 mm and inner diameter of 0.35 mm) containing an inner stylet was stereotaxically implanted into the brain with its opening protruding from the roof of the lateral ventricle (coordinates were as follows: antero-posterior = 1.0 mm caudal to the bregma; ventral = 3.6 mm from the dura mater; lateral = 0.16 mm from the mid-line). After a week of recovery, the inner stylet was removed, and the ODNs (4 μl) were injected twice with a Hamilton syringe at a 12-h interval. The animals were sacrificed 12 h after the second ODN administration, and total RNA and proteins were extracted from the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle. Changes in CSF secretion were also measured in other animals 12 h after the second ODN injection. Western Blots—Choroid plexus tissue from SCR or AS ODN-treated animals was homogenized in lysis buffer (T-PER tissue protein extract reagent; Pierce) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 3 mm aprotinin) and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, pH 6.8. Electrophoretically separated polypeptides were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane at 20 mA for 16 h using transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol, pH 8.3). The nitrocellulose membrane was blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. After incubation with a monoclonal mouse TTF-1 antibody (1:2000) (NeoMarkers) or a polyclonal goat AQP-1 antibody (1:5000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h, bound antibody was detected with an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. The membranes were exposed to x-ray film for 5 min in a dark room. Real Time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from the rat choroid plexus using TRIzol reagent (Sigma). Total RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed and amplified by a real time PCR using two sets of primers as follows: AQP-1 sense primer, 5′-CATGTATATCATCGCGGAGT-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-CACAGCCAGTGTAGTCAATG-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase sense primer, 5′-TGTGAACGGATTTGGCCGTA-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-ACTTGCCGTGGGTAGAGTCA-3′. Real time PCRs (20-μl total volume, containing 5 pmol of primer, 10 μl of SYBR green dye (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and 2 μl of cDNA) were carried out in capillaries of a DNA Engine Opticon continuous fluorescence detection system (MJ Research Inc., Waltham, MA) for ∼40 cycles. Assays for CSF Production—CSF production was measured by the ventriculocisternal perfusion method as described previously (23Davson H. Hollingsworth J.G. Carey M.B. Fenstermacher J.D. J. Neurobiol. 1982; 13: 293-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Animals who were intracerebroventricular-injected with ODNs were anesthetized with pentobarbital (7.5 mg/kg body weight) and ketamine hydrochloride (25 mg/kg body weight), placed on a stereotaxic device, and subjected to catheterization of the lateral ventricle and the cisterna magna. Lateral ventricles of the brain were perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing 1 mg/ml fluorescence isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran (Mr 70,000) as a volume marker (7Papadopoulos M.C. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13906-13912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) at 4 μl min-1 using a slow drive syringe pump (KDS 100, kdScientific, Holliston, MA). CSF samples from the cisterna magna were collected at 10-min intervals for 90 min. Fluorescence from the collected CSF samples was measured in a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Wallac Victor 1420 multilabel counter; EG & G Wallac, Turku, Finland). The rate of CSF secretion was calculated as described previously (11Oshio K. Watanabe H. Song Y. Verkman A.S. Manley G.T. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 76-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar): CSF secretion rate (μl min-1) = Fin(Din - Dout)/Dout. Din is the fluorescence of FITC-dextran in the in flow solution and Dout is fluorescence of FITC-dextran in the outflow solution. Fin is the rate of artificial cerebrospinal fluid perfusion (4 μl min-1). Measurements of Survival Rate of Animals and Brain Water Content after Acute Water Intoxication—To determine the effect of TTF-1 AS ODN on the survival rate of animals subjected to acute water intoxication, rats were given distilled water containing 1-deamino-8-d-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP, 0.4 μg/kg body weight; Sigma) equal to a 25% of body weight by intraperitoneal injection, as reported previously (24Manley G.T.

Beginning immediately after water injection, the survival rate of animals was monitored for 24 h. To measure brain water content (11Oshio K. Watanabe H. Song Y. Verkman A.S. Manley G.T. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 76-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), some animals were sacrificed 1 h after water injection, and their brains were weighed immediately and dried in a vacuum oven at 105 °C for 24 h. The dried brains were weighed again, and % brain water content was calculated as (wet weight - dry weight) × 100/wet weight. Statistics—The differences between several groups were analyzed by analysis of variance with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. Student’s t test was used for the comparison of two groups. TTF-1 and AQP-1 mRNA Are Coexpressed in the Rat Choroid Plexus—The choroid plexus is a tissue in the ventricle regions of the brain with branched structures made up of numerous villi that are composed of a single layer of epithelial cells overlying a core of connective tissue and blood capillaries (1Brown P.D. Davies S.L. Speake T. Millar I.D. Neuroscience. 2004; 129: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Previous reports have shown that AQP-1 is exclusively expressed in the apical membrane of the choroid plexus epithelium (25Nielsen S. Smith B.L. Christensen E.I. Agre P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7275-7279Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). We used FISH to determine the localization of TTF-1 and AQP-1 mRNAs in the choroid plexus. FISH showed that TTF-1 mRNA was expressed in epithelial cells of the lateral ventricular choroid plexus (Fig. 1, A and C, red), and as expected, AQP-1 was exclusively expressed in choroid plexus epithelial cells (Fig. 1, B and D, green). Double FISH demonstrated that TTF-1 mRNA was present in all AQP-1 mRNA-containing cells of the choroid plexus (Fig. 1, E and F, yellow). The donut-shaped fluorescence staining strongly revealed that both mRNA signals were present only in the cytoplasm surrounding cellular nuclei stained with Hoechst 33258 (Fig. 1, C and D). We also confirmed the colocalization of TTF-1 and AQP-1 mRNAs in the choroid plexus by classical double in situ hybridization using DIG-labeled TTF-1 cRNA and 35S-UTP-labeled AQP-1 cRNA probes (data not shown). In control experiments, hybridization with DIG-labeled TTF-1 sense RNA or fluorescein-labeled AQP-1 sense RNA probes revealed absence of specific signals detected in the choroid plexus (data not shown). TTF-1 Transactivates the AQP-1 Promoter—The coexpression of TTF-1 and AQP-1 suggested that the former may control transcription of the AQP-1 gene. Thus, we evaluated whether TTF-1 was able to activate the AQP-1 promoter. In this study, we used the 5′-flanking region of the human AQP-1 gene, as no confirmed promoter sequence for mouse or rat AQP-1 has been reported to date. We also used a rat TTF-1 expression vector to transfect either mouse BAS8.1 glial progenitor cells or rat glioma C6 cells, both of which express AQP-1 mRNA detected by RT-PCR (data not shown).

This study profiled and investigated functionally candidate genes mediating this switch between cell survival and death during an acute inflammatory reaction subsequent to the absence of glucocorticoid signaling. Oligonucleotide microarray analysis revealed that following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intracerebral administration at striatum level, more modulated genes presented transcription impairment than exacerbation upon glucocorticoid receptor blockage. Among impaired genes we identified ceruloplasmin (Cp), which plays a key role in iron metabolism and is implicated in a neurodegenative disease. Microglial and endothelial induction of Cp is a natural neuroprotective mechanism during inflammation, because Cp-deficient mice exhibited increased iron accumulation and demyelination when exposed to LPS and neurovascular reactivity to pneumococcal meningitis. This study has identified genes that can play a critical role in programming the innate immune response, helping to clarify the mechanisms leading to protection or damage during inflammatory conditions in the CNS."

Previous studies have shown that Pax-6 is a phosphoprotein, and its phosphorylation by ERK, p38, and homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 greatly enhances its transactivation activity. However, the protein phosphatases responsible for the dephosphorylation of Pax-6 remain unknown. Here, we present both in vitro and in vivo evidence to show that protein serine/threonine phosphatase-1 is a major phosphatase that directly dephosphorylates Pax-6. First, purified protein phosphatase-1 directly dephosphorylates Pax-6 in vitro. Second, immunoprecipitation-linked Western blot revealed that both protein phosphatase-1α and protein phosphatase-1β interact with Pax-6. Third, overexpression of protein phosphatase-1 in human lens epithelial cells leads to dephosphorylation of Pax-6. Finally, inhibition of protein phosphatase-1 activity by calyculin A or knockdown of protein phosphatase-1α and protein phosphatase-1β by RNA interference leads to enhanced phosphorylation of Pax-6. Moreover, our results also demonstrate that dephosphorylation of Pax-6 by protein phosphatase-1 significantly modulates its function in regulating expression of both exogenous and endogenous genes. These results demonstrate that protein phosphatase 1 acts as a major phosphatase to dephosphorylate Pax-6 and modulate its function.

These results demonstrate that protein phosphatase 1 acts as a major phosphatase to dephosphorylate Pax-6 and modulate its function. Protein dephosphorylation at the serine and threonine residues of various proteins, like their cognate phosphorylation, plays important roles in regulating gene expression, cell cycle progression, cell differentiation, and apoptosis (1Gallego M. Virshup D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, dephosphorylation at the serine/threonine sites is largely executed by four major protein phosphatases: phosphatase-1 (PP-1), 3The abbreviations used are: PP, protein phosphatase; HLE, human lens epithelial; HLEC, human lens epithelial cell; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RT, reverse transcription; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. phosphatase-2A (PP-2A), phosphatase-2B (PP-2B), and phosphatase 2C (PP-2C) (2Cohen P.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1462-1468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) also contribute to this process. In the ocular lens, we have previously shown that PP-1 is a major serine/threonine phosphatase (8Li W.-C. Xiang H. Fass U. Zhang X.Y. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 2603-2609PubMed Google Scholar). PP-1 plays an important role in the ocular lens. First, PP-1 acts as a survival promoter of lens epithelial cells. Inhibition of PP-1 activity leads to apoptosis of rabbit, rat, and human lens epithelial cells (9Li D. W.-C. Fass U. Huizar I. Spector A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 351-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 10Li D. W.-C. Xiang H. Mao Y. Wang J. Fass U. Zhang X. Xu C. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 266: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Part of the mechanism by which PP-1 promotes survival is derived from its negative regulation of p53, a master regulator of apoptosis. PP-1 can directly dephosphorylate p53 at Ser-15 and Ser-37 to attenuate its transcriptional and apoptotic activities (11Li D.W. Liu J.P. Schmid P.C. Schlosser R. Feng H. Liu W.B. Yan Q. Gong L. Sun S.M. Deng M. Liu Y. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 3006-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Second, PP-1 regulates gene expression through modulation of various transcription factors. In this regard, here we present first evidence to show that PP-1 acts as a major phosphatase to dephosphorylate Pax-6, an important transcription factor in the eye (12Cvekl A. Piatigorsky J.

Gehring W.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1788-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that various forms of Pax-6 with different molecular weights exist, and at least four variants of Pax-6 (p46, p48, p43, and p32) were detected in cellular extracts (Fig. 1A) (32Carriere C.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7257-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). All forms of Pax-6 bear a conserved C-terminal transactivation domain, which contains relatively rich proline (P), serine (S) and threonine (T) residues, and is thus named the PST domain. Several phosphorylation sites have been identified in this region of the human and zebrafish Pax-6 (Fig. 1B). It has been shown that phosphorylation of these sites in Pax-6 is carried out by p38, ERK (34Mikkola I. Bruun J.A. Bjorkoy G. Holm T. Johansen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15115-15126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (35Kim E.A. Noh Y.T. Ryu M.J. Kim H.T. Lee S.E. Kim C.H.

On the other hand, dephosphorylation of Pax-6 remains largely unknown. Here, we present both in vitro and in vivo evidence to show that PP-1 is involved in the dephosphorylation of Pax-6 to modulate its function. In normal physiological conditions, most cellular Pax-6 protein is in an inactivate status, probably due to its dephosphorylation by PP-1. Dephosphorylation of Pax-6 by PP-1 attenuates its transcriptional activity on the downstream target genes.

Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 512-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). To prepare active p38 kinase and parallel control, 10 μg of mouse anti-p38 (pT180/pY182) or 10 μg of mouse anti-β-actin antibody (control) was added into 1 mg of HLE total proteins, and after vortexing for 10 s the mixture was incubated on ice for 1 h. Then 100 μl of protein A/G plus-agarose beads were added into the protein solution, and the protein solution was subjected to rotation at 4 °C for overnight. The pellet was collected by centrifugation and washed four times with washing buffer as previously described (11Li D.W. Liu J.P. Schmid P.C. Schlosser R. Feng H. Liu W.B. Yan Q. Gong L. Sun S.M.

Briefly, HLECs transfected with pCI-neo-hPax-6 were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (200 μCi/ml) in phosphatase-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s minimal essential medium. Then total proteins were extracted for immunoprecipitation with an antibody against Pax-6. The precipitated protein pellets were dissolved in 100 μl of 1× protein phosphatase assay buffer. Then, 10 μl of the precipitated protein solution was mixed with 2 μl 0.01% Me2SO, or 10 nm specific PP-1 inhibitor, PP1-I2 (from Calbiochem, catalog number 539516, IC50 = 2 nm), or 90 nm specific PP-2A inhibitor, PP2A-I2 (from Calbiochem, catalog number 539620, IC50 = 30 nm), or 5 nm calyculin A (Invitrogen). After incubation on ice for 30 min, the immunoprecipitated protein complex was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. After trichloroacetic acid precipitation, the supernatant fraction was recovered for counting the release of free 32P in a scintillation counter. RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—Various transfected HLECs were grown to 100% confluence and then harvested for RNA extraction. Briefly, after phosphate-buffered saline washing twice, the pelleted cells were resuspended in RNA extraction buffer, Trizol. The total RNAs were extracted according to the instruction manual. For reverse transcription, 500 ng of total RNAs, 500 ng of oligo(dT)15, and diethyl pyrocarbonate-H2O were mixed in a total reaction volume of 11 μl. After a brief centrifugation, the mixture was heated at 65 °C for 5 min followed by immediate incubation on ice for 5 min. After brief centrifugation, the reverse transcription reaction was carried out in a 20-μl system with 1 mm dNTP, 0.01 m dithiothreitol, 2 units/μl RNase inhibitor, and 15 units of avian myeloblastosis virus at 42 °C for 60 min.

At 24 h after transfection, the cells were harvested for luciferase assay according to the company instruction manual. And the luciferase activity was determined by using the Luminoskan RS microplate reader from Thermo Labsystems Corp. Quantitation of the Total Phospho-Pax-6 and Nonphospho-Pax-6—The Western blot gel and RT-PCR gel were analyzed with UN-SCAN-IT software from Silk Scientific Corp. Total pixel data were averaged from three or more different groups of samples of each species after normalization against the background. Statistical Analysis—In the present study, all of the data presented are derived from at least three experiments. During data analysis, statistical analysis was conducted for all sets of data when necessary. Both average and S.D. value were calculated and included in the figures. PP-1 and PP-2A Can Dephosphorylate Pax-6 in Vitro—To explore what phosphatases may dephosphorylate Pax-6, we first tested the serine/threonine phosphatase-1 and -2A with the in vitro dephosphorylation assays. Our previous studies have shown that both PP-1 and PP-2A are present in the lens epithelial cells (8Li W.-C. Xiang H. Fass U. Zhang X.Y. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 2603-2609PubMed Google Scholar). To do so, the full-length Pax-6 protein or its PST domain was fused into the pGEX 4T-1 vector to make fusion proteins (Fig. 2A). Both Coomassie Blue staining and Western blot analysis were applied to test their expression in Escherichia coli BL-21. Both full-length GST Pax-6 fusion protein (GST-mPax-6) (Fig. 2B, right lane) and the GST PST domain fused protein (GST-PST) (Fig. 2B, middle lane) were obtained. Since the full-length GST-mPax-6 only accounted for a small portion of the expressed GST-mPax-6 (the majority of the GST-mPax-6 full-length fusion proteins were truncated by bacterial enzymes and thus appeared in multiple bands with molecular mass less than 74 kDa), the purified GST-PST protein was used for in vitro dephosphorylation assays, and GST was used for the parallel control (Fig. 2B). Both GST-PST and GST substrates were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and the immunoprecipitated p38 kinase or the immunoprecipitated β-actin (for mock). The labeled GST or GST-PST was then subjected to dephosphorylation by purified catalytic subunits of PP-1 or PP-2A obtained from Calbiochem. After dephosphorylation, the released free 32P was determined. As shown in Fig. 2, C and D, respectively, both PP-1 and PP2A were able to dephosphorylate Pax-6. In contrast, the GST did not generate a significant amount of free 32P, indicating that both PP-1 and PP-2A specifically dephosphorylated Pax-6 but not GST (Fig. 2, C and D). Moreover, the labeling reaction with immunoprecipitated β-actin did not yield significant free 32P from the reactions with either PP-1 or PP-2A (data not shown), further demonstrating that the specificity of dephosphorylation of the serine/threonine residues in Pax-6 by PP-1 and PP-2A. Under the present assay conditions, dephosphorylation of Pax-6 by PP-2C was not detected (data not shown). Together, these results suggest that PP-1 and PP-2A are able to dephosphorylate Pax-6 in vitro. The Catalytic Subunits for PP-1 but Not for PP-2A Form a Complex with Pax-6 in Vivo—To demonstrate that PP-1 and PP-2A are able to dephosphorylate Pax-6 in vivo, we first examined whether the catalytic subunits for PP-1 or PP-2A could form interacting complexes. To do so, total proteins extracted from HLECs with or without UVA irradiation were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation assays. Two anti-Pax-6 antibodies were used for these studies. The two antibodies made either in mice or in rabbits by two separate companies recognize Pax-6 (Fig. 3A). Since the rabbit anti-Pax-6 is a polyclonal antibody, it was used for immunoprecipitation, and on the other hand, the mouse anti-Pax-6 was used for Western blot analysis. When the proteins immunoprecipitated by rabbit anti-Pax-6 were probed with the antibody against the α form of the catalytic subunits for PP-1 (PP-1α), it was found that less than 50% of PP-1α was bound to Pax-6. UVA enhanced the interaction (Fig. 3B, panel 1). In the reverse immunoprecipitation-linked Western blot analysis, it was found that more than 90% of 46-kDa Pax-6 and 100% of 32-kDa Pax-6 were found bound to PP-1α. Less than 10% of 46-kDa Pax-6 was left in the supernatant (Fig. 3B, panel 2). In the same way, we tested the interaction between the β form of the catalytic subunits for PP-1 (PP-1β) and Pax-6 and also the interaction between the catalytic subunit of PP-2A and Pax-6. As shown in panels 3 and 4 of Fig. 3B, PP-1β also interacts with Pax-6, but the affinity of the 46-kDa Pax-6 to PP-1β seems to be less than to PP-1α (Fig. 3B, panels 2 and 4). Although PP-2A was able to dephosphorylate Pax-6 in the in vitro assay (Fig. 2D), immunoprecipitation-linked Western blot analysis revealed no interactions between the catalytic subunit of PP-2A and Pax-6 (Fig. 3C), between the scaffold subunit A of PP-2A and Pax-6 (Fig. 3D), and between the regulatory subunit B of PP-2A and Pax-6 (Fig. 3E). Thus, it is likely that PP-1 but not PP-2A is involved in direct dephosphorylation of Pax-6 in normal physiological conditions. UVA irradiation enhances the interactions of both PP-1α and PP-1β with Pax-6 (panels 1–4 of Fig. 3B). To further explore the interactions between PP-1α and Pax-6, as well as PP-1β and Pax-6, we treated human lens epithelial cells with calyculin A, an inhibitor for both PP-1 and PP-2A. Inhibition of PP-1α or PP-1β with calyculin A attenuates the interaction between PP-1 and Pax-6 (Fig. 3F). Thus, both PP-1α and PP-1β are likely to participate in dephosphorylation of Pax-6. PP-1α Can Dephosphorylate Pax-6 in Vivo, and Overexpression of PP-1α Leads to Dephosphorylation of Pax-6—To demonstrate that PP-1 actually dephosphorylates Pax-6 in vivo, we conducted the in vivo dephosphorylation assay as previously described (11Li D.W. Liu J.P. Schmid P.C. Schlosser R. Feng H. Liu W.B. Yan Q. Gong L. Sun S.M. Deng M. Liu Y. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 3006-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 41Ayllon V. Martinez-A C. Garcia A. Cayla X. Rebollo A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2237-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). HLECs overexpressing hPax-6 were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, and the labeled proteins were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-Pax-6 antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resuspended in dephosphorylation buffer and then incubated at 30 °C 10 min for the dephosphorylation reaction. After the reaction, the released free 32P was determined. As shown in Fig. 4A, a significant amount of free 32P was released, and this release was mostly blocked when a specific PP-1 inhibitor, PP1-I2 (IC50 = 2nm), or 5 nm calyculin A was present in the dephosphorylation reaction (Fig. 4A). However, a specific inhibitor for PP-2A, PP2A-I2 (IC50 = 30 nm), did not block the dephosphorylation reaction. This result clearly showed that PP-1 binds to Pax-6 and dephosphorylates it in normal human lens epithelial cells. To further explore this in vivo dephosphorylation, we examined the phosphorylation status of the 32- and 46-kDa Pax-6 in normal HLE cells, vector-transfected HLE cells, or PP-1α overexpression HLE cells. As shown in Fig. 4B, whereas 46-kDa Pax-6 appears in hypophosphorylation status in all three types of cells, the 32-kDa Pax-6 exists in both hyper- and hypophosphorylation status. Moreover, in the PP-1α overexpression cells, the ratio of hyperphospho-Pax-6 to hypophopho-Pax-6 is much lower than that in the vector-transfected or nontransfected HLE cells (Fig. 4C). Together, these results show that two different forms of Pax-6 with different phosphorylation status are present in human lens epithelial cells. Overexpression of PP-1α leads to enhanced dephosphorylation of the hyperphosphorylated 32-kDa Pax-6. Inhibition of PP-1 by Calyculin A Enhances the Phosphorylation of Pax-6—Since overexpression of PP-1α did not change the phosphorylation status of the 46-kDa Pax-6, we next explored whether inhibition of PP-1 activity would affect the phosphorylation status of the 46-kDa Pax-6 as well as 32-kDa Pax-6. As shown in Fig. 5A, inhibition of PP-1 with 5 nm calyculin A led to the presence of multiple forms of hyperphosphorylated Pax-6, either 32 or 46 kDa in both vector and PP-1α transfected human lens epithelial cells. Analysis of the ratio between hyper- and hypophosphorylated Pax-6 through the density scanning of the Western blots revealed that the hyperphosphorylation of the 46-kDa Pax-6 observed in the vector-transfected clone due to inhibition of PP-1 by calyculin A was almost reversed by overexpression of PP-1α in the pCI-PP-1α-transfected clone (Fig. 5B). For the 32-kDa Pax-6, inhibition of PP-1α by calyculin A caused more than 30% hyperphosphorylation in vector-transfected cells. In the pCI-PP-1α transfected clone, however, much reduced hyperphosphorylation in p32 Pax-6 was observed due to the"

However, it remains unclear how CED-3 activation results in cell death because few substrates for this protease have been described. We have used a global proteomics approach to seek substrates for CED-3 and have identified 22 worm proteins that undergo CED-3-dependent proteolysis. Proteins that were found to be substrates for CED-3 included the cytoskeleton proteins actin, myosin light chain, and tubulin, as well as proteins involved in ATP synthesis, cellular metabolism, and chaperone function. We estimate that ∼3% of the C. elegans proteome is susceptible to CED-3-dependent proteolysis. Notably, the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone calreticulin, which has been implicated in the recognition of apoptotic cells by phagocytes, was cleaved by CED-3 and was also cleaved by human caspases during apoptosis. Inhibitors of caspase activity blocked the appearance of calreticulin on the surface of apoptotic cells, suggesting a mechanism for the surface display of calreticulin during apoptosis.

Further analysis of these substrates is likely to yield important insights into the mechanism of killing by CED-3 and its human caspase counterparts. The caspase family of cysteine proteases have been implicated in the regulation of programmed cell death in numerous organisms, from simple invertebrates to man (1Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2417) Google Scholar). Caspases are present in most cells as inactive proenzymes and become activated during apoptosis through diverse signaling pathways (2Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar, 3Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Upon activation, caspases promote programmed cell death by restricted proteolysis of numerous proteins within the dying cell (4Fischer U. Janicke R.U. Schulze-Osthoff K. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 76-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Caspase-dependent proteolytic events produce dramatic rearrangements of the cellular architecture and engulfment of the dying cell by phagocytes (5Savill J. Fadok V. Nature. 2000; 407: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has contributed greatly to our understanding of the regulation of cell death in metazoans through discovery of a series of cell death defective (ced) genes (6Ellis R.E. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1986; 44: 817-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 7Lettre G. Hengartner M.O. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In several cases, this led directly to the discovery of a role for their mammalian counterparts in the regulation of apoptosis, the caspases being a notable example (8Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2229) Google Scholar, 9Miura M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartwieg E.A. Yuan J.

The worm caspase, CED-3, has been established as essential for the great majority of developmentally related programmed cell deaths in the worm (6Ellis R.E. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1986; 44: 817-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 11Shaham S. Reddien P.W. Davies B. Horvitz H.R. Genetics. 1999; 153: 1655-1671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to mammalian caspases, CED-3 is probably present in most cells as an inactive precursor but becomes activated in cells fated to die during development. CED-3 activation is achieved through recruitment of the inactive CED-3 precursor to the scaffold protein CED-4, which assembles into a tetrameric complex (12Yan N. Chai J. Lee E.S. Gu L. Liu Q. He J. Wu J.W. Kokel D. Li H. Hao Q. Xue D. Shi Y. Nature. 2005; 437: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The latter event is normally prevented by CED-9, which represses CED-4 tetramerization and CED-3 recruitment (12Yan N. Chai J. Lee E.S. Gu L. Liu Q. He J. Wu J.W. Kokel D. Li H. Hao Q. Xue D. Shi Y. Nature. 2005; 437: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 13Hengartner M.O. Ellis R.E. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). However, although CED-3 is firmly established as a central participant in the molecular control of programmed cell death in the worm, how activation of this protease results in cell death is obscure because few substrates for CED-3 have been identified thus far. Understanding how CED-3 kills cells in the worm is of considerable interest, not only because this is likely to shed further light upon how programmed cell death is coordinated in this organism, but because this is also likely to generate insight into how human caspases promote apoptosis. The observation that a single caspase is sufficient to coordinate apoptosis in the worm suggests that CED-3 harbors all of the activities that have subsequently become allocated to several different caspases in higher organisms. Here we have used two-dimensional gel-based proteomics to seek substrates for CED-3. This approach yielded 22 substrates and included proteins involved in protein and DNA synthesis, chaperone function, cellular metabolism, and the cytoskeleton. We estimate that ∼3% of the worm proteome is susceptible to CED-3-dependent proteolysis. These data suggest that CED-3 promotes cell death through simultaneously targeting diverse cellular functions. Detailed analysis of these substrates is likely to yield important insights into the mechanism of killing by CED-3. Reagents—The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting: anti-CED-3 C-20 (Santa Cruz), anti-GST (BD Pharmingen), anti-β-tubulin (ICN), anti-calreticulin polyclonal antibody (Affinity Bioreagents), and anti-calreticulin monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories). Anti-calreticulin polyclonal antibody was also used for surface immunostaining in conjunction with anti-rabbit Alexafluor 488 as a secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated against recombinant CED-3, as follows. Briefly, His-CED-3221-503 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified over nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, and rabbits were immunized with the purified protein. Polyclonal antibodies against p17 and p13 domain peptides of CED-3 were also generated and affinity-purified using the immunization peptides. The peptides z-VAD-fmk, 2The abbreviations used are: z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; DCI, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Ac-DEVD-AFC, Ac-LEHD-AFC, Ac-IETD-AFC, and Ac-YVAD-AFC were purchased from Bachem. 17-cm immobilized pH gradient strips (pH 3-6 and pH 5-8), easy melt agarose and Bio-Lyte ampholytes™ were obtained from Bio-Rad. The serine protease inhibitors, tosylphenylalanylchloromethane, and 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (DCI) were purchased from Merck. Unless otherwise indicated, all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The CED-3221-503 open reading frame was cloned from a pQE30-CED-3221-503 template (kindly provided by Dr. Shai Shaham) into the pGEX4TK2 vector to generate GST-tagged CED-33221-503. Crt-1, Tbb-2, and Ftt-2 open reading frames were amplified by PCR from a C. elegans cDNA library (Origene) and cloned into the pET45b vector. The human calreticulin open reading frame was amplified by PCR from an IMAGE clone (MRC) and inserted into pcDNA3. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using a QuikChange kit (Stratagene). All of the plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Expression and Purification of Recombinant CED-3—E. coli DH5α cells were transformed with pGEX4TK2-CED-3221-503. CED-3 protein expression was induced by the addition of 100 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to culture medium followed by a 3-h incubation at 25 °C. Proteins were affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose, as previously described, and eluted in protease reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 75 mm NaC1, 0.1% CHAPS, 2 mm dithiothreitol) with 10 mm glutathione. CED-3 was then active site titrated against Ac-DEVD-AFC, using z-VAD-fmk as an inhibitor. Fluorimetry Assays—The Reactions containing recombinant GST-CED-3221-503 were typically assembled in a final volume of 100 μl, containing 50 μm Ac-DEVD-AFC, Ac-LEHD-AFC, Ac-IETD-AFC, or Ac-YVAD-AFC in protease reaction buffer. Fluorescence was then measured in an automated fluorimeter (Spectrafluor Plus; TECAN) at wavelengths of 430 nm (excitation) and 535 nm (emission). Coupled in Vitro Transcription/Translation—[35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were generated using the TnT kit (Promega) as described previously (35Martin S.J. Amarante-Mendes G.P. Shi L. Chuang T.H. Casiano C.A. O'Brien G.A. Fitzgerald P. Tan E.M. Bokoch G.M. Greenberg A.H. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2407-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Typically, 25-μl reactions were assembled containing 0.5 μg of template plasmid DNA and 2 μl of translation grade [35S]methionine (1000 μCi/ml; MP Biomedicals). Nematode Cell-free Reactions—Bristol N2 strain C. elegans were harvested from a 250-ml liquid culture by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. Nematodes were washed twice in 50 ml of 100 mm NaCl, added to 20 ml of 60% sucrose, and centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 × g. Worms were immediately removed from the sucrose and washed in 100 mm NaCl. Following a final centrifugation at 500 × g, pelleted worms were resuspended in 2 volumes of extract buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotonin). Resuspended worms were lysed by sonication, and insoluble material was pelleted for 15 min at 15,000 × g. CED-3 was added to soluble C. elegans extract at 130 nm (as determined by active site titration with z-VAD-fmk) unless otherwise indicated. The reactions were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C to facilitate CED-3-dependent proteolysis. Cell-free reactions were then assessed by immunoblotting or subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis as described. Two-dimensional Electrophoresis—Approximately 500 μg of protein was solubilized to a final volume of 350 μl in IEF sample buffer (8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 0.05% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% w/v Bio-Lyte ampholytes™, 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue). Immobilized pH gradient strips were passively rehydrated in the presence of protein samples overnight. The samples were then focused on a Bio-Rad IEF cell under the following conditions: 1) a linear voltage ramp to 500 V over 1 h, 2) 5 h at a constant 500 V to facilitate desalting, 3) linear voltage ramp to 3500V over 5 h, and 4) 15 h at a constant 3500 V. Following isoelectric focusing, immobilized pH gradient strips were prepared for second dimension SDS-PAGE by a 10-min incubation in reducing buffer (2% (w/v) dithiothreitol in 6 m urea, 375 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol), followed by a 10-min incubation in alkylating buffer (2.5% (w/v) iodoacetimide in 6 m urea, 375 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol). Strips were then mounted on 12% SDS-PAGE gels using 1-2 ml of easy melt agarose (Bio-Rad) and electrophoresed at 37.5 mA/gel in a Bio-Rad Protean IIxi electrophoresis cell (Bio-Rad). Silver Staining of Two-dimensional Gels—Proteins were visualized using a mass spectrometry-compatible silver staining protocol as previously described (14Adrain C. Creagh E.M. Cullen S.P. Martin S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36923-36930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Silver-stained gel images were acquired using a digital camera and were visually inspected for CED-3-dependent changes in spot patterns. In-gel Protein Digestion and Identification by MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—Candidate protein spots were excised from two-dimensional gels, in-gel digested with trypsin, extracted, and identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (ABI Voyager DE-Pro), as previously described (14Adrain C. Creagh E.M. Cullen S.P. Martin S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36923-36930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Induction of Apoptosis—CEM cells were cultured in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum under standard conditions. Apoptosis was induced by incubation in indicated concentrations of actinomycin D, tosylphenylalanylchloromethane, or DCI. To quantitate apoptosis, the cells were stained with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate at 1 μg/ml and propidium iodide at 10 μg/ml in annexin V binding buffer (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2). Cell fluorescence was measured on a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson, CA). Immunostaining—The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% NaN3, followed by a 15-min incubation in the same buffer. Antibodies were added at 1:400 and incubated for 1 h. After a further three washes, secondary antibody was added at 1:500 for 1 h. The cells were washed another three times and fixed for 15 min in phosphate-buffered saline with 3% paraformaldehyde and then prepared for flow cytometry. Preparation of Cell Lysates—The cells were pelleted at 800 × g and resuspended at 2 × 107 cells/ml in SDS-PAGE loading buffer (2% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol). The lysates were assessed by immunoblotting. Preparation and Activation of Jurkat Cell-free Extracts—Cell-free extracts were prepared from human Jurkat cells, and caspases were activated by the addition of cytochrome c and dATP to these extracts, as described previously (14Adrain C.

CED-3 Displays Characteristics of Initiator and Effector Caspases—Programmed cell death in the nematode takes place in scattered cells during development such that of a total of 1090 cells born in the C. elegans hermaphrodite, 131 of these die in a programmed manner (16Sulston J.E. Horvitz H.R. Dev. Biol. 1977; 56: 110-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (2442) Google Scholar). Preliminary studies established that it was not possible to induce coordinate programmed cell death in worm embryos or in the somatic cells of adult worms using UV radiation, microtubule-disrupting drugs, or inhibitors of protein or RNA synthesis. 3R. C. Taylor and S. J. Martin, unpublished data. The latter stimuli readily trigger apoptosis in fly and mammalian cells, and their failure to do so in the worm suggests that a damage-associated programmed cell death pathway is absent in the majority of somatic cells in the nematode. Because it was not possible to obtain homogenous populations of dying cells from worm embryos or larval stages, we adopted a biochemical approach to finding CED-3 substrates. This involved generating homogenates from mixed stage worm populations, to which recombinant active CED-3 was added. To obtain recombinant CED-3 we generated a variety of expression constructs including full-length CED-3, a truncated CED-3 lacking the N-terminal prodomain, and constructs encoding the large and small subunits individually. However, most of these failed to produce soluble protein, and several denaturation and refolding strategies proved unsuccessful (data not shown). Recombinant active CED-3 was produced by removing the N-terminal CARD domain of the protease (amino acids 1-220) and replacing with GST (Fig. 1, A and B). Purified GST-CED-3 fusion protein exhibited robust proteolytic activity against several synthetic caspase substrate peptides including DEVD-AFC, IETD-AFC, and LEHD-AFC (Fig. 1C). In contrast, CED-3 did not hydrolyze YVAD-AFC, a substrate that is commonly preferred by inflammatory caspases in mammals. CED-3 exhibited a preference for DEVD-AFC, which is typical of mammalian effector caspases such as caspase-3, but was also capable of cleaving IETD-AFC and LEHD-AFC relatively efficiently (Fig. 1C). Importantly, an N-terminally His-tagged CED-3 construct also displayed similar activity toward tetrapeptide substrates (supplemental Fig S1), suggesting that the addition of the N-terminal GST moiety did not significantly alter the specificity of CED-3 toward peptide substrates. Thus, CED-3 appears to be more promiscuous than the major effector caspase in mammals (caspase-3), which is consistent with the role of CED-3 as the only essential effector, as well as initiator, caspase in the worm. We also assessed the catalytic activity of recombinant CED-3 using protein substrates that were produced by coupled in vitro transcription/translation. CED-3 has previously been reported to cleave its own precursor, consistent with its ability to auto-activate (17Xue D. Shaham S. Horvitz H.R.

Nature. 1997; 390: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Therefore, we titrated recombinant GST-CED-3 onto 35S-labeled pro-CED-3 and 35S-labeled CED-9 to assess the ability of CED-3 to cleave these proteins (Fig. 1D). As Fig. 1D illustrates, CED-3 cleaved its own precursor to fragments of ∼17 and ∼13 kDa consistent with separation of the large and small subunits through proteolysis at Asp374 and Asp388. However, the addition of C. elegans homogenate (see below) significantly attenuated the activity of GST-CED-3 toward both 35S-labeled substrates (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig S2). CED-3-mediated proteolysis of pro-CED-3 and CED-9 was also largely suppressed by the polycaspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 1E). CED-3-dependent Proteolysis in C. elegans Homogenates—To screen for CED-3 substrates within the C. elegans proteome, we generated worm homogenates as follows. Mixed stage populations of C. elegans were grown in liquid cultures until bacteria were entirely cleared because this facilitated the elimination of contaminating E. coli from the worm digestive tracts. Worms were then washed several times in M9 buffer followed by purification over sucrose gradients. Homogenates of worm populations were generated by brief sonication, and the resulting protein preparations were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g to eliminate unbroken worms and empty cuticles (supplemental Fig S3). These preparations were then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of recombinant CED-3. The concentration of CED-3 chosen was based upon preliminary titrations of recombinant CED-3 against known substrates, in the presence and absence of worm homogenates (as shown in Fig. 1D). Proteins were separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 2A, incubation of C. elegans homogenates with active GST-CED-3 failed to reveal any obvious alterations to the worm proteome, suggesting that CED-3 is a highly specific protease that cleaves relatively few substrate proteins, at least at concentrations where this protease can process its own precursor (Fig. 1D). We next analyzed similar CED-3-treated worm homogenates using two-dimensional SDS-PAGE, and these analyses were successful in detecting ∼40 alterations to the two-dimensional protein spot patterns (Fig. 2, B and C, and supplemental Fig S4). Altered protein spots were then excised from the gels, and the proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. As illustrated in Fig. 3A and supplemental Table 1, 22 proteins were identified as undergoing CED-3-dependent proteolysis under these conditions. These included proteins involved in a diverse range of cellular functions. Of note, several homologues of known human caspase substrates were identified, including the cytoskeletal proteins actin, myosin, and α-tubulin (19Moretti A. Weig H.J. Ott T. Seyfarth M.

Additionally, several of the substrates identified, including actin, myosin, tubulin, and calreticulin, have previously been implicated in apoptosis-associated events in mammalian systems (20Adrain C.

Validation of CED-3 Substrates—To confirm that the identified proteins were bona fide CED-3 substrates rather than two-dimensional PAGE running artifacts, we cloned several of the genes encoding these proteins and explored whether in vitro transcribed and translated forms of these proteins were cleaved by CED-3 in vitro. As Fig. 3 (B-D) illustrates, 14-3-3 family protein 2 (FTT-2), calreticulin (CRT-1), and tubulin β2 (TBB-2) were cleaved by CED-3 with comparable efficiency to the known substrates pro-CED-3 and CED-9. In contrast, a panel of control worm proteins failed to undergo substantial proteolysis under the same conditions (supplemental Fig S5). Sites of CED-3-mediated cleavage in FTT-2, CRT-1, and TBB-2 were mapped by site-directed mutagenesis as shown in Fig. 3 (B-D). In the case of FTT-2, a single CED-3 cleavage site (Asp240) appeared to be responsible for the proteolysis seen, because mutation of this site completely suppressed FTT-2 cleavage by CED-3 (Fig. 3B). In the case of TBB-2, mutation of three potential sites individually caused changes in the pattern of substrate proteolysis (data not shown), whereas mutation of all three sites simultaneously resulted in only a partial reduction in substrate cleavage efficiency, suggesting that multiple CED-3 cleavage sites are present in TBB-2 (Fig. 3C). A similar situation prevailed in the case of CRT-1, although mutation of three candidate sites in this protein did substantially attenuate proteolysis by CED-3 (Fig. 3D). The majority of the sites found in these substrates were found to match the consensus DXXD (Table 1), which is also typical of mammalian effector caspases. In addition, where multiple cleavage sites existed within a particular substrate, sites matching the DXXD consensus were the most efficiently cleaved (data not shown).TABLE 1Alignment of CED-3 cleavage sites Sites of CED-3-mediated cleavage identified by site-directed mutagenesis in FTT-2, TBB-2, and CRT-1 were aligned with known CED-3 cleavage sites in CED-3 and CED-9. This alignment was used to derive a consensus sequence for CED-3-mediated protein cleavage motifs. Open table in a new tab Cleavage of Human Homologues—Although it was not possible because of the lack of suitable antibodies to explore whether all CED-3 substrate homologues were also caspase substrates in man, we were able to confirm this in the case of FTT-2 homologues 14-3-3β, ɛ, and τ, TBB-2 homologue β-tubulin isoform 5, and CRT-1 homologue calreticulin. As shown in Fig. 4A, three human 14-3-3 isoforms underwent caspase-mediated proteolysis in a human cell-free system based on Jurkat cell-free extracts, whereas a fourth isoform, 14-3-3 ζ, remained uncleaved (data not shown). Human β-tubulin and calreticulin were also confirmed to be caspase substrates in apoptotic cell extracts (Fig. 4, B and C). Calreticulin Is Cleaved during Apoptosis and Exposed on the Surface of Apoptotic Cells—The identification of the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone calreticulin as a caspase substrate was particularly interesting, because a recent report has shown that calreticulin is exposed on the cell surface during apoptosis (25Gardai S.J. McPhillips K.A. Frasch S.C. Janssen W.J. Starefeldt A. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Bratton D.L. Oldenborg P. Michalak M. Henson P.M. Cell. 2005; 123: 321-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). Cell surface-exposed calreticulin acts as a ligand for CD91 on phagocytes, leading to engulfment of the apoptotic cell (25Gardai S.J. McPhillips K.A. Frasch S.C. Janssen W.J. Starefeldt A. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Bratton D.L. Oldenborg P. Michalak M. Henson P.M. Cell. 2005; 123: 321-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). Thus, calreticulin appears to act as an inducible engulfment signal, the appearance of which on the cell surface may be controlled by caspases. To explore this possibility, we first assessed whether cleavage of calreticulin occurred in human CEM cells after exposure to a range of pro-apoptotic stimuli (actinomycin D, tosylphenylalanylchloromethane, and DCI). Proteolysis of calreticulin was indeed observed during apoptosis, although a relatively small proportion of the total cellular protein appeared to be cleaved in comparison with substrates such as XIAP and caspase-9 (Fig. 4D). Because the majority of calreticulin in healthy cells is contained within the endoplasmic reticulum, this protein is largely inaccessible to caspases, which may explain the inefficient proteolysis seen during apoptosis. In contrast, when in vitro transcribed and translated calreticulin was added to cell-free extracts, where this protein was not protected by endoplasmic reticulum, very robust proteolysis of calreticulin was observed (Fig. 4C). We then explored whether surface exposure of calreticulin during apoptosis could be detected by immunostaining with an anti-calreticulin antibody, as recently reported (25Gardai S.J. McPhillips K.A. Frasch S.C. Janssen W.J. Starefeldt A. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Bratton D.L. Oldenborg P. Michalak M. Henson P.M. Cell. 2005; 123: 321-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). As Fig. 5A illustrates, whereas healthy CEM cells exhibited little surface immunoreactivity for calreticulin (Crt), this changed dramatically upon exposure to actinomycin D, DCI, or etoposide (VP-16), all of which promoted robust apoptosis under these conditions. Significantly, when these cells were treated with the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, surface exposure of calreticulin was profoundly inhibited (Fig. 5B). In addition, CEM cells stably expressing the apoptosis inhibitory protein Bcl-2 also failed to exhibit an increase in surface calreticulin upon exposure to actinomycin D (Fig. 5C). In contrast, surface expression of calreticulin was readily detected in wild type CEM cells under the same conditions (Fig. 5C). Thus, caspase activity appears to be essential for the cell surface exposure of calreticulin during apoptosis. In this study, we have identified 22 novel substrates of the C. elegans caspase CED-3. Because only four CED-3 substrates have been identified to date (17Xue D. Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes Dev. 1996;"

To identify transcription factors that may play a role in gene regulation in stroma cells, we performed comparative gene expression analysis of fibroblastic NIH3T3 cells, unable to support hematopoiesis in vitro, and OP-9 stroma cells, highly efficient in this regard. These experiments revealed that transcription factors of the early B cell factor (EBF) family were highly expressed in OP-9 cells as compared with the NIH3T3 cells. To identify potential targets genes for EBF proteins in stroma cells, we overexpressed EBF in fibroblasts and analyzed the pattern of induced genes by microarray analysis. This revealed that EBF was able to up-regulate expression of among others the Cxcl12, Ccl9, and Periostin genes. The identification of relevant promoters revealed that they all contained functional EBF binding sites able to interact with EBF in OP-9 cells. Furthermore, ectopic expression of a dominant negative EBF protein or antisense EBF-1 RNA in OP-9 stroma cells resulted in reduced expression of these target genes. These data suggest that EBF proteins might have dual roles in hematopoiesis acting both as intrinsic regulators of B-lymphopoiesis and as regulators of genes in bone marrow stroma cells.

The development of hematopoietic cells from multipotent progenitors is a process regulated by the coordinated action of transcription factors and extrinsic signals from the bone marrow environment. This can be exemplified by one developmental pathway that has been under intense investigation, the maturation of B-lymphocytes from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow.

However, the early stages of this developmental pathway is also critically dependent on the active support of bone marrow stroma cells that provide signals crucial for homing, proliferation, and differentiation of progenitor cells. One such factor is Cxcl12 (8Egawa T. Kawabata K. Kawamoto H. Amada K. Okamoto R. Fujii N. Kishimoto T. Katsura Y. Nagasawa T. Immunity. 2001; 15: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) that appears to be produced by stroma cells in an anatomically restricted region of the bone marrow (9Tokoyoda K. Egawa T. Sugiyama T. Choi B.I. Nagasawa T. Immunity. 2004; 20: 707-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). These bone marrow cells are involved in the support of the earliest stages of B cell development and possibly also participate in the regulation of the hematopoietic stem cell niche (9Tokoyoda K.

Subsequent differentiation of the progenitor cell is suggested to be associated with relocation into another anatomical niche composed of stroma cells producing interleukin-7, a cytokine shown to be crucial for normal hematopoiesis (10von Freeden-Jeffry U.

However, information regarding transcription factor function and genetic networks in the stroma cells are limited. Stroma cells from fetal livers in c-myb-deficient mice has been shown to have a reduced ability to support blood cell development (14Sicurella C. Freeman R. Micallef S. Mucenski M.L. Bertoncello I. Ramsay R.G. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2001; 27: 470-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and recently a role for the homeo-box transcription factor pitx-2 was suggested from in vitro differentiation experiments using stroma from pitx-2-deficient embryos (15Kieusseian A. Chagraoui J. Kerdudo C. Mangeot P.E. Gage P.J. Navarro N. Izac B. Uzan G. Forget B.G. Dubart-Kupperschmitt A. Blood. 2006; 107: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To understand more about the biology of hematopoiesis supporting stroma cells, we decided to compare gene expression patterns in fibroblasts (NIH3T3) unable to support B-lymphocyte development without the addition of cytokines in vitro, and stroma cells (OP-9) highly efficient in this regard (16Vieira P. Cumano A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 271: 67-76PubMed Google Scholar). One group of transcription factors that turned out as highly expressed in the stroma cells was EBF proteins. Identification of target genes for EBF in the stroma indicates that these factors among other things regulate a set of cytokine/chemokine genes suggesting dual roles for EBF proteins in hematopoiesis. Tissue Culture Conditions and Cell Lines—BaF/3 cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm pyruvate, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (all purchased from Invitrogen AB, Taöby, Sweden). The medium for the BaF/3 cells was supplemented with 10% of conditioned medium from confluent WEHI3 cells as a source of interleukin-3. NIH3T3 and S17N stroma cells were propagated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (all purchased from Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2. OP-9 cells were grown in Opti-MEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Protein Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Schreiber et al. (17Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muöller M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). DNA probes were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by incubation with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche), annealed with the complementary strand, and purified on a micro-spin column (Roche). 5-10 μg of nuclear extract or 0.5-2 μl of in vitro-transcribed/translated protein was incubated with the labeled probe (20,000 cpm, 3 fmol) for 30 min at room temperature in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 70 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 1 mm ZnCl2) with 0.75 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences). DNA competitors were added 10 min before addition of the labeled probe. The samples were separated on a 6% acrylamide TBE gel, which was dried and subjected to autoradiography. Competitors based on synthetic oligonucleotides were added at the molar excesses indicated in the respective figures. Supershifts were performed under the same conditions but with the additional presence of 2 μl of polyclonal anti-EBF (SC-15333) or anti-actin (SC-1616) (Santa Cruz) as a negative control.

In Vitro Transcription and Translation—Recombinant protein was generated by coupled in vitro transcription/translation using a reticulocyte lysate kit (Promega) and a cDNA3-based EBF-1 vector (18Sigvardsson M.

Target cells (NIH3T3 or OP-9) were infected in 100- or 60-mm dishes at 50% confluence, using 1 volume of virus supernatant diluted in 1 volume of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) with 10% (v/v) calf serum, after which Poly-brene (Sigma) was added at a final concentration of 6 μg/ml. The medium was replenished 8-12 h following infection. 24 h after infection the cells were split 1:3 to 100-mm dishes and selected with 2 μg/ml of puromycin (Sigma) for 24-48 h. Dishes with selected cells were trypsinized, pooled, and replated on 100- or 60-mm dishes for differentiation. BaF/3 cells were transduced as described in Ref. 21Mansson R. Tsapogas P. Akerlund M.

The cells were selected with 2 μg/ml of puromycin (Sigma) for 48 h where after dead, cells were removed by centrifugation on a Ficoll gradient. Gene Expression Analysis—RNA was prepared using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and 7.5 μg of total RNA was annealed to a T7-oligo(T) primer by denaturation at 70 °C for 10 min followed by a 10-min incubation of the samples on ice. First strand synthesis was performed for 2 h at 42 °C using 20 units of Superscript Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) in buffers and nucleotide mixtures according to the manufacturers instructions. This was followed by a second strand synthesis for 2 h at 16 °C, using RNase H, Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, and E. coli DNA ligase (all from Invitrogen), according to the manufacturers instructions. The obtained double-stranded cDNA was then blunted by the addition of 20 units of T4 DNA polymerase and incubation for 5 min at 16 °C. The material was then purified by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction followed by precipitation with NH4Ac and ethanol. The cDNA was then used in an in vitro transcription reaction for 6 h at 37 °C using a T7 IV Translation kit and biotin-labeled ribonucleotides. The obtained cRNA was purified from unincorporated nucleotides on an RNeasy column (Qiagen). The eluted cRNA was then fragmented by incubation of the products for 2 h in fragmentation buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.1, 100 mm KOAc, 150 mm MgOAc). 20 μg of the final fragmented cRNA was then hybridized to Affymetrix chips U74Av2 or MOE4302 (Affymetrix) in 200 μl of hybridization buffer (100 mm MES buffer, pH 6.6, 1 m NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 0.01% Tween 20) supplemented with herring sperm DNA (100 μg/ml) and acetylated bovine serum albumin (500 μg/ml) in an Affymetrix Gene ChIP Hybridization oven 320. The chip was then developed by the addition of fluorescein isothiocyanate-streptavidin followed by washing using an Affymetrix Gene Chip Fluidics Station 400. Scanning was performed using a Hewlett Packard Gene Array Scanner. Hierarchical tree clusters were generated using the dCHIP program (24Li C. Wong W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (2713) Google Scholar). Expression values were calculated according to the PM-only model. Real Time Quantitative-PCR and Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Analysis—RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and cDNA was generated by annealing 1 μg of total RNA to 0.5 μg of random hexamers in 10 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Reverse transcriptase reactions were performed with 200 units of SuperScript Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) in the manufacturers buffer supplemented with 0.5 mm dNTP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 units of RNase inhibitor (Roche) in a total volume of 20 μl. The real time PCR was based on the TaqMan™ technology (Applied Biosystems). The threshold cycles (Ct) for the endogenous control hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase mRNA and the target signals were determined and the relative RNA quantification was calculated using the comparative Ct method as 2-ΔCt, where ΔCt is Ct(target) - Ct(hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase). Oligonucleotides for quantitative TaqMan real time PCR were ordered as Assay on demand (Applied Biosystems): Ccl9 Mm00441260_m1, Cxcl12 Mm00445552_m1; Postn Mm00450111_m1; and EBF-1 Mm01288947_g1. Real time PCR of EBF-1 expression in short hairpin RNA-transduced cells was performed as in Ref. 20Jimenez M.A. Akerblad P. Sigvardsson M. Rosen E.D. Mol. Cell.

Conventional reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed using cDNA prepared as above and a 25-μl PCR composed of 2 units of Taq (Invitrogen) in 0.1 mm dNTP and the buffer recommended by the manufacturer. The primers were added at a final concentration of 1 μm. Actin was amplified by 25 cycles (94 °C, 30 s; 58 °C, 30 s; and 72 °C, 30 s), whereas 35 cycles were used to amplify the EBF-1, EBF-2, and EBF-3 message (94 °C, 30 s; 60 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 30 s). The following primers were used for amplification: actin sense, 5′-GTTTGAGACCTTCAACACC; actin antisense, 5′-GTGGCCATCTCCTGCTCGAAGTC; EBF-1 sense, 5′-TGGATGGCCATGTCCTGGCAGTC; EBF-1 antisense, 5′-TGTAGATGAATCTGCCTGGTGTC; EBF-2 sense, 5′-TGGATGGACATGTGCTGGCTGTT; EBF-2 antisense, 5′-CTGTGTAGATGAACCTGCCCGGG; EBF-3 sense, 5′-TGGACGGCCACGTGCTGGCCGTG; EBF-3 antisense, 5′-TGTAGACAAAGCGTCCAGGAGCG. 5′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) Analysis—Total RNA was prepared by TRIzol extraction of OP-9 stroma cells according to the manufactures instructions. 5 μg of total RNA was then used for cDNA synthesis and RACE reaction using the RACE analysis kit (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturers protocol. Briefly, oligonucleotide primers located about 200 bp into the published cDNAs of the Perisotin, Ccl9, and Cxcl12 genes were annealed to the RNA and first strand synthesis was performed with Expand Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Roche). The products were purified and the cDNAs were modified by terminal dioxynucleotide transferase-mediated addition of a 5′ oligo(G) tail. The RACE products were then amplified by PCR using a second nested gene-specific primer and an oligo(C) primer aimed toward the generated 5′ poly(G) tail. 1/200 dilutions of the primary PCR products were subjected to a second round of amplification using a third nested primer. The obtained products were purified and sequenced. The RACE primers were: Cxcl12:1, 5′-AAGCTTTCTCCAGGTACTCTTGG; Cxcl12:2, 5′-CAGCCGTGCAACAATCTGAAGG; Cxcl12:3, 5′-GGCACAGTTTGAGTGTTGAGG; Ccl9:1, 5′-GAATCCGTGAGTTATAGGACAGG; Ccl9:2, 5′-GCTGTGCCTTCAGACTGCTCTGG; Ccl9:3, 5′-TGGACTTCTTTTGTCTCTGTTGC; Periostin:1, 5′-CGTTCGAGACATCGGAGTAGTGC; Periostin:2, 5′-AACATGGTCAATAGGCATCACTGC; Periostin:3, 5′-CATCCCTTCCATTCTCATATAGC.

Transient Transfections and Luciferase Assays—HeLa cells were seeded into a 24-well tissue culture plate so that they reached 60-80% confluence for transfection. A total of 400 ng of DNA was used to transfect the cells each well. 50 ng of each reporter construct was co-transfected with 300 ng of expression vector and all transfections included 50 ng of pRL-0 Renilla luciferase, received from Dr. Bjoörn Olde, as internal control, and used for normalization of the luciferase activities. The DNA was first added to 50 μl of serum-free Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen), mixed with 7 μl of PLUS Reagent (Invitrogen), and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. 0.75 μl of Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) was diluted in 25 μl of serum-free medium, incubated for 30 min in room temperature, mixed with the diluted DNA, and then incubated for another 15 min at room temperature. Meanwhile, the complete RPMI medium was replaced with 300 μl of serum-free medium, and the DNA-Plus/Lipofectamine mixture was added to the cells that were then incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 3 h, after which each well was supplemented with 1 ml of complete RPMI. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and protein extracts were prepared directly in the 24-well plates by adding 100 μl of cell lysis buffer. Chromatin Immunoprecipitations (ChIP)—ChIP experiments were conducted using the ChIP kit (Upstate Biotech) according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Briefly, formaldehyde was added to a concentration of 1% to cultures at 80% confluence of the OP-9 cells. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min before the formaldehyde was removed and the cells were washed 2 times with ice-cold PBS supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete™, Roche). After lysis of the cells and sonication of the chromatin, the lysate was pre-cleared and 2 μl of either anti-EBF or preimmune rabbit antisera was added (23Gisler R. Sigvardsson M. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5130-5138Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). After incubation overnight at 4 °C, protein A-Sepharose was added and the precipitated material was washed according to the Upstate protocol. Protein A-Sepharose-bound material was eluted by incubation in 500 μl of 0.1 m Na2CO3 buffer supplemented with 0.1% SDS. The protein/DNA cross-links were removed by addition of 20 μl of 5 m NaCl and incubation at 65 °C for 3 h. The DNA was then purified by incubation with 10 μg of proteinase K followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and precipitation with 0.1 volumes of 3 m NaAc, pH 5.6, and 2.5 volumes of 95% ethanol. After centrifugation and wash with 70% ethanol the material was dried and redissolved in 25 μl of water. 1 μl of precipitated material was added to a 25-μl PCR. The PCRs were performed using the conditions described above with a PCR cycle 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s, using the following specific primers: Cxcl12 180 sense, CAGCGGAGCCGCGGACACTGAGG; Cxcl12 60 antisense, GcGCTTTAGAGGCGAAAACCAGG; Ccl9 80 sense, GGGTGTTATGTAGTCAAAGGAGG; Ccl9 10 antisense, CTTGCTATTTATACATGTAAGAGG; Periostin 250 sense, AtAGGAGACAGAGTTCAGATTGC; Periostin 200 antisense, CTTGCGATGGCCTTACAGAAGC; CD53 sense, TACCATGCTGGCTTGGTCAGTATGG; CD53 antisense, AGTGCTTCTCAATTGAAGCAGC. Isolation and Purification of Bone Marrow Cells—Bone marrow was flushed and passed through a cell strainer. 15-20 × 106 cells were incubated in a 75-ml cell culture flask using α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen), and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen) for 24 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2. Non-adherent cells were removed and washed twice with PBS (Invitrogen), adherent cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized, and washed twice with PBS, RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) as described above. ELISA—ELISA was made using the DuoSet® ELISA kits against CCL9 and CXCL12 (R&D Systems UK). ELISA plates were treated with 100 μl of capture antibody diluted in PBS and incubated in room temperature overnight. Unspecific binding were avoided by blocking the plate with 200 μl of 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS in 37 °C for 1 h. Plates were then incubated with 100 μl of supernatant from virally infected OP-9 or NIH 3T3 cells for 2 h in 37 °C and standards from the kit were used as positive controls. The plates were then incubated with 100 μl of detection antibody diluted in 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 2 h at 37 °C. Streptavidin/horse-radish peroxidase was added and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Between all incubation steps washing were performed with 400 μl of washing buffer (0.9% NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and repeated four times. For antibody detection 100 μl of Dako® TMB Blue Substrate-Chromogen was used. The TMB reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 2 m H2SO4. Substrate conversion was quantified in an automatic ELISA reader (VERSA max) at 450 nm. Bone Marrow Stroma Cells Express EBF Proteins—To identify transcription regulatory networks in stroma cells it is crucial to identify cells capable of supporting blood cell development. Because the exact nature of such cells in the bone marrow remains elusive, we decided to compare gene expression patterns in two cell types with different abilities to support lymphopoiesis in vitro. Two candidates for such a comparison is the stroma cell line is OP-9, able to support the development of B-lymphocytes, and the fibroblast line NIH3T3, being much less efficient in this regard (supplementary data) (16Vieira P. Cumano A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 271: 67-76PubMed Google Scholar). To get information about the overall gene expression pattern in these cells, we performed global gene expression profiling using MOE4302 Affymetrix microarray chips. The data were analyzed using the dCHIP software (24Li C. Wong W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (2713) Google Scholar) revealing clear differences in gene expression patterns (Fig. 1A and supplementary data Fig. S1). Among the transcription factors were Fox G1 as well as Fox F2 expressed at a higher level in the NIH3T3 cells, whereas the expression levels of Gata-6 and Id genes (Id1-4), were higher in the Op-9 cells. Another clear difference between two cell types was the expression of EBF genes, where three different probe sets indicated 11-15-fold higher levels of EBF-1 message in the OP-9 cells as compared with the NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1A, supplementary data Fig. S1). To investigate the relative levels of EBF-1 message in the stroma cell line OP-9 and the pre-B cell lines, 230-238 and 18-81, we performed a quantitative-PCR of EBF-1 expression. This confirmed the microarray results where the OP-9 cells expressed high levels of EBF-1 message as compared with the NIH3T3 as well as the pre-B cell lines (Fig. 1B). EBF-1 belongs to a group of transcription factors designated EBF 1-4 (25Garel S. Marin F. Mattei M.G. Vesque C. Vincent A. Charnay P. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 26Wang S.S. Betz A.G. Reed R.R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 20: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and the microarray analysis of 3T3 and OP-9 cells suggested differential expression of EBF-1 and -3 (supplementary data Fig. S1). To further investigate the spectra of EBF genes expressed in stroma cell lines, we performed reverse transcriptase-PCR with mRNA from the stroma cell lines OP-9 and S17N (previously shown to express EBF mRNA (27DeKoter R.P. Lee H.J. Singh H. Immunity. 2002; 16: 297-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar)), or the pre-B cell line 70Z3 (Fig. 1C). This revealed that whereas the pre-B cells only expressed EBF-1, EBF-1 as well as the EBF-3 message were detected in OP-9 cells. The S17N cells also expressed high levels of EBF-2, whereas none of the tested cell types were found to express EBF-4 (data not shown). The expression of EBF proteins in OP-9 cells could also be detected in EMSAs using nuclear extracts from OP-9 cells and the mb-1 promoter EBF site (Fig. 1D). This resulted in one prominent DNA-protein complex that was supershifted by the anti-EBF, but not the control anti-actin antibody. To investigate if primary bone marrow stroma cells express EBF genes, bone marrow cells were incubated on a plastic surface and EBF expression in adherent and non-adherent cells were investigated by PCR (Fig. 1E). The non-adherent cells, including B-cell progenitors, expressed EBF-1 exclusively, whereas the adherent population expressed EBF-1 as well as EBF-2 message (Fig. 1E). Thus, we conclude that bone marrow stroma cells lines as well as primary bone marrow stroma cells express EBF mRNA. Ectopic Expression of EBF-1 Induces Cytokine/Chemokine Gene Expression in Fibroblastic Cells—Knowing that EBF proteins were expressed in stroma cells, we wanted to learn more about the role of these factors in stroma cells by the identification of target genes. Developing a useful loss of function model is complicated by the fact that EBF-1 as well as EBF-2-deficient mice display dramatic phenotypes outside of the hematopoietic system (28Garel S. Marin F.

https://openalex.org/W2081518179,"The 2.7 A crystal structure of the 55-kDa N-terminal breakage-reunion domain of topoisomerase (topo) IV subunit A (ParC) from Streptococcus pneumoniae, the first for the quinolone targets from a gram-positive bacterium, has been solved and reveals a 'closed' dimer similar in fold to Escherichia coli DNA gyrase subunit A (GyrA), but distinct from the 'open' gate structure of Escherichia coli ParC. Unlike GyrA whose DNA binding groove is largely positively charged, the DNA binding site of ParC exhibits a distinct pattern of alternating positively and negatively charged regions coincident with the predicted positions of the grooves and phosphate backbone of DNA. Based on the ParC structure, a new induced-fit model for sequence-specific recognition of the gate (G) segment by ParC has been proposed. These features may account for the unique DNA recognition and quinolone targeting properties of pneumococcal type II topoisomerases compared to their gram-negative counterparts."
https://openalex.org/W2005962929,"GATA-1 is the key transcription factor for the development of the erythroid, megakaryocytic, eosinophilic, and mast cell lineages. GATA-1 possesses the ability to self-associate, and this characteristic has been suggested to be important for GATA-1 function. To elucidate the roles self-associated GATA-1 plays during hematopoietic cell development in vivo, in this study we prepared GATA-1 mutants in which three lysine residues potentially contributing to the self-association (Lys-245, Lys-246, and Lys-312) are substituted in combination with alanines. Of the mutants, 3KA harboring alanine substitutions in all three lysines showed reduced self-association activity without considerable interference in the modification of GATA-1 by acetylation. We generated transgenic mouse lines that express these GATA-1 mutants utilizing the Gata1 hematopoietic regulatory domain, and crossed the mice to Gata1 knockdown (GATA-1.05) mutant mice. Although NKA (K245A and K246A) and CKA (K312A) mutants almost fully rescued the GATA-1.05 mice from anemia and embryonic lethality, the 3KA mutant only partially rescued the GATA-1.05 mutant mice. Even with the higher than endogenous level expression, GATA-1.05/Y::3KA embryos were prone to die at various stages in mid-to-late gestation. Live birth and an anemic phenotype were restored in some embryos depending on the expression level of the 3KA transgene. The expression of the transferrin receptor and heme biosynthesis enzymes was impaired in the yolk sac and liver of the 3KA-rescued embryos. Immature erythroid cells with insufficient expression of the transferrin receptor accumulated in the livers of 3KA-rescued embryos. These results provide the first convincing line of evidence that the self-association of GATA-1 is important for proper mammalian erythroid development in vivo.

Significant progress has been made in the analysis of the transcriptional machinery operating during hematopoietic development. Elaborate regulation of hematopoiesis is suggested to be a consequence of highly orchestrated interactions of multiple transcription factors and cofactors. Modifications of transcription factors also appear to be important for the establishment of specificity and/or affinity of the interactions. The impact of the interactions and modifications of transcription factors on hematopoietic development in vivo is an important topic to be addressed. GATA-1 is the key regulator of transcription in erythroid, megakaryocytic, eosinophilic, and mast cells (1Evans T. Felsenfeld G.

Yamamoto M. Semin. Cell. Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We recently found that erythroid progenitors accumulate in the hematopoietic organs of heterozygous Gata1 knockdown mice (GATA-1.05/X); these cells are produced by the inhibition of apoptosis, in conjunction with stimulation of proliferation and inhibition of erythroid differentiation. The latter two mechanisms are provoked by the reduced expression of GATA-1 to 5% of wild-type level, whereas the former mechanism (i.e. inhibition of apoptosis) is an inherent function of GATA-1 that is still operating despite the severely reduced GATA-1 level. These erythroid progenitors eventually proceed to overt leukemic cells (12Takahashi S. Komeno T. Suwabe N. Yoh K. Nakajima O. Nishimura S. Kuroha T. Nagasawa T. Yamamoto M.

Trainor C.D. Yamamoto M. Blood. 2004; 103: 2560-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). An intriguing observation in the analysis was that, in contrast to the case for the entire NF-deletion mutant, high level accumulation of the Val-205 mutant sustains hematopoietic progenitor differentiation to the erythroid lineage despite impaired ability to interact with FOG-1 (28Shimizu R. Ohneda K. Engel J.D. Trainor C.D. Yamamoto M. Blood. 2004; 103: 2560-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Rescued mice with Val-205 mutant transgene develop to adult stage. Whereas disruption of the self-association ability of GATA-1 was found to reduce markedly the positive autoregulation mechanism for the Gata1 gene in zebrafish embryos (29Kobayashi M. Nishikawa K. Yamamoto M. Development. 2001; 128: 2341-2350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Nishikawa K. Kobayashi M. Masumi A. Lyons S.E. Weinstein B.M. Liu P.P. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 8295-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the physiological significance of the self-association mechanism remains to be assessed. Therefore, to gain insights into the contribution of GATA-1 self-association to the regulation of erythropoiesis in vivo, especially in mammalian systems, in this study we attempted another transgenic complementation rescue analysis exploiting GATA-1 mutants that lack the self-association ability. We modified two lysine residues (Lys-245 and Lys-246) located at the C-terminal side of NF, along with one (Lys-312) located at the C-terminal side of CF. The combination of these three lysine mutations (3KA) reduces self-association ability significantly but affects the acetylation of GATA-1 only mildly. The 3KA mutant expressed under the control of G1HRD hardly rescues GATA-1 knockdown mutant mice from embryonic lethality. Although 3KA mutant embryos survive the primitive hematopoietic stage, they succumb to anemia during definitive hematopoiesis, and die at various late embryonic stages. The expression of the transferrin receptor and heme biosynthesis enzymes is markedly reduced, indicating that self-association is indispensable for GATA-1 to direct proper erythroid development through regulating the expression of specific target genes. Immunoblot Analysis—Whole cell extracts were prepared from bone marrow. Bone marrow cells in 300-μl SDS sample buffer were sonicated and subsequently heat-denatured. Samples were separated by SDS-10% PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). The membrane was probed with anti-mouse GATA-1 antibody (N6, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA (31Ito E. Toki T. Ishihara H. Ohtani H. Gu L. Yokoyama M. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1993; 362: 466-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar)) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-rat IgG (ICN Biomedicals) as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. Expression and Purification of Wild-type GATA-1 and Mutant Proteins—Maltose-binding protein (MBP)-GATA-1, -NKA, -CKA, -3KA, and MBP were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 codon plus RIL (Stratagene). The cells were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 nm zinc acetate and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in phosphate-buffer saline by sonication, and the proteins were purified by affinity chromatography over an amylose resin column (New England Biolabs). His-tagged human p300 protein was purified from Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus, which is a kind gift from Drs. Ito and Kraus (32Ito T. Ikehara T. Nakagawa T. Kraus W.L. Muramatsu M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1899-1907PubMed Google Scholar, 33Kraus W.L. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In Vitro Acetyltransferase Assays—Acetyltransferase assays were performed as previously described with a minor modification (34Masumi A. Ozato K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20973-20980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were incubated with 100 ng of p300 or p/CAF in the presence of [14C]acetyl-CoA for 1 h at 30 °C in acetyltransferase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 0.5-mm dithiothreitol, 1-mm p-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm sodium butyrate). Reaction mixtures were separated by SDS-10% PAGE and analyzed with a phosphorimaging device (BAS 1600, Fujifilm). GST Pulldown Assay—MBP and glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion GATA-1 proteins were produced in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS competent cells (Novagen) as described (30Nishikawa K. Kobayashi M. Masumi A. Lyons S.E. Weinstein B.M. Liu P.P. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 8295-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins containing the GATA-1 finger domain (200-322 amino acids) were purified with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and mixed with graded amount of MBP fusion protein (0, 2, 5, and 10 μg). Proteins were incubated in binding buffer (40 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C for 1 h. Glutathione-Sepharose beads were subsequently washed three times with the binding buffer, and bound proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer and separated in SDS-7% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 100 ng of MBP fusion protein was used as an input control. Immunoblot analysis was performed using anti-MBP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Results were quantified by the use of an LAS-3000 phosphorimaging device (Fujifilm). RT-PCR—Total RNA from the spleen or bone marrow of transgenic founder mice was prepared by using the RNA-sol extraction system (Tel-Test). The cDNAs were synthesized with superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). For analyzing the expression of GATA-1 mutants, the amount of reverse-transcribed cDNA was adjusted by dilution to give an amount equivalent to that of the endogenous GATA-1 cDNA amplicon. The expression of total Gata1 mRNA was detected by real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis with an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system. Primers used were 5′-CAGAACCGGCCTCTCATCC and 5′-TAGTGCATTGGGTGCCTGC. The TaqMan fluorescence probe used was 5′-CCCAAGAAGCGAATGATTGTCAGCAAA. For semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis of mRNAs, the amount of cDNA was diluted to give an amount equivalent to that of the Hprt amplicon. Sequences of the primers used were 5′-TGGATTCATGAGTGGCTACCTGG and 5′-GTTCATCTCGCCAGACTTTGCTG for transferrin receptor 1 (Trfc). The other primers used in this study were as described previously (27Shimizu R. Takahashi S. Ohneda K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5250-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 28Shimizu R. Ohneda K. Engel J.D. Trainor C.D. Yamamoto M. Blood. 2004; 103: 2560-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Each primer pair was designed to span at least one intron to distinguish amplicons originating from cDNA and genomic DNA. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed with a Student's t test. Probability values of p < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. A GATA-1 Mutation That Impairs Self-association but Not Acetylation Modification—To gain further insights into the contribution of GATA-1 self-association to the regulation of erythropoiesis in a mammalian in vivo system, in this study we established transgenic lines of mice that harbor a GATA-1 mutant specifically lacking the self-association ability. In addition to contributing to the interaction surface between GATA-1 molecules, the lysine residues in the NF and CF tail regions of mouse GATA-1 (mGATA-1) are also acetylated by CBP/p300 (35Boyes J. Byfield P. Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V. Nature. 1998; 396: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 36Blobel G.A. Blood. 2000; 95: 745-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Hung H.L. Lau J. Kim A.Y. Weiss M.J. Blobel G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3496-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Therefore, to distinguish the affects of self-association from those caused by acetylation, it was necessary to generate a GATA-1 mutant molecule that cannot self-associate but can be acetylated. To this end, we modified two lysine residues of the KKR motif (Lys-245 and Lys-246) located at the N-terminal side of CF (NKA, Fig. 1A), along with one lysine residue (Lys-312) located at the C-terminal side of CF (CKA). We established three independent GATA-1 mutants that contain these lysine to alanine substitutions alone and in combination, NKA, CKA, and 3KA (NKA+CKA), as shown in Fig. 1A. To examine the susceptibility of these mutant GATA-1 molecules to acetylation, we performed an in vitro acetylation assay. As shown in Fig. 1B, an MBP fusion protein containing 3KA mutant GATA-1 was acetylated by p300 to ∼60% of the wild-type level. This result shows very good agreement with the report of a GATA-1 mutant acetylation attained by CBP (37Hung H.L. Lau J. Kim A.Y. Weiss M.J. Blobel G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3496-3505Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar); the substitution of Lys-312 to alanine was reported not to influence the acetylation of GATA-1 by CBP, perhaps because of the compensation by adjacent lysine residues. We next examined whether or not the self-association ability of GATA-1 was impaired by the introduction of NKA, CKA, or 3KA mutation by a GST pulldown assay. GST-tagged GATA-1 finger domain (corresponding to amino acids 200-322) harboring the NKA, CKA, or 3KA mutation was incubated with graded amount of wild-type or mutant GATA-1 proteins fused to MBP, and resulting complexes were captured with glutathione-Sepharose beads, followed by immunoblotting with anti-MBP antibody (Fig. 1C). In this analysis the MBP-GATA-1 protein was detected as a doublet (a major band plus a minor band with slower mobility) in both wild-type and mutant protein lanes, suggesting the existence of certain modification of the fusion proteins. When 2 μg of MBP fusion protein was added to the reaction, the amount of MBP-GATA-1 bound to the GST fusion protein was much less in all three mutants than that of wild-type GATA-1 (Fig. 1, C and D). Upon the addition of 5 μg of MBP fusion protein, the binding ability was still lower in the CKA and 3KA mutants, whereas the self-association of the NKA mutant was comparable to that of wild-type GATA-1. When 10 μg of fusion protein was added, the ability of self-association was significantly lower in the 3KA mutant, whereas that of the CKA mutant was comparable to the wild-type GATA-1 protein. In this case the self-association ability of NKA mutant appears stronger than that of wild-type GATA-1. The amount of GST fusion protein used as bait was almost comparable among the four different protein lanes when visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig. 1C, bottom panel). These results thus indicate that both the N-terminal (245 and 246) and C-terminal (312) lysine residues are involved in the self-association of GATA-1 protein in vitro, and these residues act cooperatively. The C-terminal Lys-312 residue seems to contribute more critically to the GATA-1 self-association than the N-terminal lysine residues do. Expression of GATA-1 Mutant in Vivo under the Regulation of GATA-1 Hematopoietic Regulatory Domain—We cloned NKA, CKA, and 3KA mutants of GATA-1 individually into a vector harboring the G1HRD, which directs expression of the transgenes in both primitive and definitive erythroid lineages (23Onodera K. Takahashi S. Nishimura S. Ohta J. Motohashi H. Yomogida K. Hayashi N. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4487-4492Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 26Takahashi S. Shimizu R. Suwabe N. Kuroha T. Yoh K. Ohta J. Nishimura S. Lim K.C. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Blood. 2000; 96: 910-916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These transgenic constructs were then microinjected into fertilized eggs using the standard procedure (38Wassarman P. DePamphilis M. Methods in Enzymology: Guide to Techniques in Mouse Development. Vol. 225. Academic Press, New York1993: 747-799Google Scholar), and several transgenic mouse lines were established for each GATA-1 construct. The expression level of the transgenes was determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR as described previously (27Shimizu R. Takahashi S. Ohneda K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5250-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Because all transgenic constructs contain 110-bp extra sequence insertion into 5′-un-translated region, a single PCR reaction enabled us to determine the expression level of all constructs as well as the difference of expression level between transgene-derived and endogenous GATA-1 mRNA. As shown in Fig. 2A, we obtained three to five transgenic mouse lines per construct. These mouse lines were classified in accordance with the expression level of transgene-derived GATA-1 mRNA determined by the semi-quantitative RT-PCR using the cDNA templates from the spleens of transgenic females. Each transgenic line was categorized into High (transgene-derived mRNA level was severalfold higher than endogenous GATA-1 mRNA level; H), Medium (comparable to endogenous GATA-1 mRNA level; M), and Low expressers (less abundant than the endogenous GATA-1 mRNA; L). We next examined the expression GATA-1 mRNA derived from both Gata1 transgene and endogenous Gata1 gene by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Showing very good coincidence with the results of conventional semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses (Fig. 2A), we found that the expression of 3KA-H1 mRNA was much higher than that of 3KA-M in this quantitative RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2B). We found no hematological abnormality in these transgenic lines of mice (data not shown). To verify whether the accumulation of mutant GATA-1 protein inside the transgenic animals was comparable with that expected from the transgene-derived mRNA level, we prepared total protein lysates from the 3KA transgenic male mice bone marrow and performed immunoblot analysis using N6 anti-GATA-1 antibody (31Ito E. Toki T. Ishihara H. Ohtani H. Gu L. Yokoyama M. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1993; 362: 466-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). A 2.5-, 4-, and 4-fold increase of the expression level of immunoreactive proteins was detected in bone marrow cell lysates prepared from 3KA-M, 3KA-H2, and 3KA-H1 transgenic mice, respectively, compared with that of the wild-type mouse (Fig. 2C). In the immunoblotting experiment, we found a low molecular weight protein band, with expression levels that correlate well with full-length GATA-1. This phenomenon has been observed reproducibly in the immunoblot analyses of GATA-1 in hematopoietic tissues, but not for the GATA-1 from cultured cells, suggesting that the band may correspond to a limited proteolysis product of GATA-1 (35Boyes J. Byfield P. Nakatani Y. Ogryzko V. Nature. 1998; 396: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrate that the GATA-1 mutant proteins do accumulate in the hematopoietic organs of transgenic mice, showing very good coincidence with the results of semi-quantitative and quantitative RT-PCR. GATA-1 harbors two nuclear localization signals, the RPKKR (243-247 amino acids) and KGKKK (312-316 amino acids) motifs, and the alanine-substituted lysines were located in either of the two GATA-1 nuclear localization signals. Therefore, to examine nuclear localization of the mutant GATA-1 proteins, the subcellular localization of the transgene-derived mutant GATA-1 proteins was examined by immunohistochemistry using N6 antibody and the yolk sacs of E9.5 embryos. Whereas GATA-1 could not be detected in the GATA-1.05/Y embryonic yolk sacs without the transgene (Fig. 2E), N6 antibody detected 3KA mutant GATA-1 in the nucleus of erythroid cells in the yolk sacs of GATA-1.05/Y embryo bearing 3KA transgene (Fig. 2F) as well as wild-type embryos (Fig. 2D). This is in very good agreement with the previous report that a GATA-1 mutant with multiple lysine-to-alanine substitutions, including Lys-245, Lys-246, and Lys-312, did accumulate in the nucleus (39Lamonica J.M. Vakoc C.R. Blobel G.A. Blood. 2006; 108: 3736-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that the mutant GATA-1 proteins derived from the transgenes were expressed in the nucleus of hematopoietic cells in vivo at levels compatible with the amounts of their mRNAs. Self-association of GATA-1 Is Necessary for Erythropoiesis—To examine the importance of the self-association of GATA-1 protein for its function, we performed complementation rescue analysis of GATA-1 knockdown mice from embryonic lethality (26Takahashi S. Shimizu R. Suwabe N. Kuroha T. Yoh K. Ohta J. Nishimura S. Lim K.C. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Blood. 2000; 96: 910-916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Shimizu R. Takahashi S. Ohneda K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5250-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Because the GATA-1 gene is located on the X chromosome, hemizygous male (GATA-1.05/Y) mice cannot live beyond 12.5 embryonic days (E12.5), whereas heterozygous female (GATA-1.05/X) mice are viable and fertile, albeit they have various degrees of anemia during the neonatal period due to random X chromosome inactivation (9Takahashi S.

We have shown that transgene-derived wild-type GATA-1 accumulated under the regulation of G1HRD can overcome the GATA-1.05/Y embryonic lethality (26Takahashi S. Shimizu R. Suwabe N. Kuroha T. Yoh K. Ohta J. Nishimura S. Lim K.C. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Blood. 2000; 96: 910-916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so the rationale of this analysis is that GATA-1.05/Y mice bearing a mutant tran"

Concomitantly, TPA increases the avidity of α2β1 for collagen and the number of conformationally activated α2β1 integrins. The structural change was shown using a monoclonal antibody 12F1 that recognizes the “open” (active) conformation of the inserted domain in the α2 subunit (α2I). Amino acid residue Glu-336 in α2 subunit is proposed to mediate the interaction between α2I domain and β1 subunit. Glu-336 seems to regulate a switch between open and “closed” conformations, since the mutation α2E336A inhibited the TPA-related increase in the number of 12F1 positive integrins. E336A also reduced cell adhesion to collagen. However, E336A did not prevent the TPA-related increase in adhesion to collagen or α2β1 aggregation. Thus, α2β1 integrin avidity is regulated by two synergistic mechanisms, first an α2E336-dependent switch to the open α2I conformation, and second an α2E336-independent mechanism temporally associated with receptor aggregation.

Integrin-type cell adhesion receptors undergo functional regulation via different conformational states (1Springer T.A. Wang J.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 2004; 68: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In an inactive integrin α/β heterodimer, the ligand binding headpiece is bent toward the cell surface (2Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar), while an active integrin stands tall but may still have multiple activation states. Nine α subunits out of 24 human integrin heterodimers have an inserted αI (or αA) ligand binding domain, which can exist in multiple configurations of differing affinity. The conformation of αI is regulated by a spring-like mechanism formed by a conserved glutamate residue in the α7 helix acting as an intrinsic ligand of the I-like domain of the β subunit (βI; Refs. 3Alonso J.L.

Avidity, the overall strength of integrin mediated interactions between cells and extracellular ligands, is multideterminant, involving the affinity of individual receptors and variations in the spatial arrangement of the integrins. The total number of receptors participating in the interaction, or valency, is expected to be larger if integrins form clusters. The relationship between conformational regulation and cluster formation has been thoroughly studied in αLβ2 integrin, a leukocyte receptor for intercellular adhesion molecules (5Jin M. Andricioaei I. Springer T.A. Structure (Lond.). 2004; 12: 2137-2147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 6Salas A. Shimaoka M. Kogan A.N. Harwood C. von Andrian U.H.

Recent studies suggest that αLβ2 clustering takes place only after binding a multivalent ligand and that clustering strengthens adhesion after ligand binding (8Kim M. Carman C.V. Yang W. Salas A. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1241-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The requirement of a ligand for receptor clustering has also been reported for αVβ3 (9Cluzel C. Saltel F. Lussi J. Paulhe F. Imhof B.A. Wehrle-Haller B. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and αIIbβ3 integrins (10Loftus J.C. Albrecht R.M. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 822-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Four collagen receptors, α1β1, α2β1, α10β1, and α11β1, form a subgroup of αI domain containing integrins. Integrin α2β1 is expressed on platelets, epithelial cells, and many mesenchymal cell types (11White D.J. Puranen S. Johnson M.S. Heino J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1405-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The α2I domain, like other integrin I domains, can exist in both an “open” and a “closed” conformation (12Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C. Cell. 2000; 101: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar), as well as a less frequent, intermediate form (13Shimaoka M. Xiao T. Liu J-H. Yang Y. Dong Y. Jun C.-D. McCormack A. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Takagi J. Wang J.-H. Springer T.A. Cell. 2003; 112: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Thus, α2β1 can also be found in more than one conformation (14Cruz M.A. Chen J. Whitelock J.L. Morales L.D. Lopez J.A. Blood. 2005; 105: 1986-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), likely regulated similarly to other αI domain integrins. The unique functions of collagen receptor integrins may also be governed by the regulation of the receptor distribution and local density. For example, α2β1 and α11β1 participate in the formation and rearrangement of collagen fibrils (15Velling T. Risteli J. Wennerberg K. Mosher D.F. Johansson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37377-37381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 16Li S. Van Den Diepstraten C. D'Souza S.J. Chan B.M. Pickering J.G. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 1045-1056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and echovirus-1-dependent clustering leads to rapid relocation and internalization of α2β1. In this process, α2β1 behaves differently from other integrin family members, such as αV integrins (17Upla P. Marjomaöki V. Kankaanpaöaö P. Ivaska J. Hyypiaö T. Van Der Goot F.G. Heino J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The phorbol ester TPA 2The abbreviations used are: TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; col I, collagen I; BSA, bovine serum albumin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; BIS, bisindolylmaleimide. can increase the avidity of α2β1 binding to collagen (18Polanowska-Grabowska R. Gear A.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 3044-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We report here that while TPA induces rapid (5-15 min) clustering of cell surface α2β1inthe absence of ligand and increases α2β1 avidity for collagen, it also activates the integrin via a conformational mechanism involving α2E336 and intermolecular cross-talk between the α2I and β1I domains. Aggregation of α2β1 is independent of E336 and temporally associated with increased avidity of adhesion. We conclude that the avidity of α2β1 for collagen is regulated by two synergistic mechanisms.

Stable CHO-α2E309A, CHO-α2Y410A, and CHO-α2E336A cell lines were created by using FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). α2 positive cells were first selected with G418 (0.5 mg/ml; Invitrogen). Additionally, positive cells were stained with integrin α2 mAb 12F1 (BD Biosciences) and anti-mouse FITC-IgG (Dako) and isolated by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences).

Cells were allowed to spread in serum-free medium with 50 μm cycloheximide (Sigma) for 2 h at 37 °C. Fixed cells were analyzed by phase-contrast microscopy as described earlier (26Jokinen J. Dadu E.

Receptor Staining—100 nm TPA (Calbiochem) was added to subconfluent cells in serum free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium. Released cells were fixed (4% formalin) and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline with 3% BSA and 0.6% rat IgG at time points. Cells were stained with mAb (12F1 or 16B4, Serotec) and anti-mouse Alexa-488-IgG (Molecular Probes) and assayed by flow cytometry. Cellular Adhesion Assay—Adherent cells were first treated with 10 μm bisindolylmaleimide (BIS; Calbiochem) or α2 integrin inhibitory antibody P1H5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), for 15 min at 37 °C when stated. Then, col I- or BSA-coated bead suspension (Ø 9.6 μm; 8 × 105 beads (27Connors W.L. Heino J. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 337: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar)) ± 100 nm TPA was added. Finally, cells were released and fixed at time points and assayed by flow cytometry (27Connors W.L. Heino J. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 337: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Integrin Clustering and Internalization—1) Cells cultured on chambered coverslips in CO2-independent medium (Sigma) were stained with Alexa-555-conjugated 16B4 (labeling kit, Molecular Probes) and treated with 1 μm TPA, anti-mouse IgG (positive control), or left untreated (negative control). Four-dimensional (three-dimensional + time) data sets were obtained at 37 °C at 3-min intervals for a total time of 24 min. 2) Cells were starved overnight in medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum and treated either with 10 μm BIS or 1 μm TPA for 40 min at 37 °C, or cells were pretreated with 10 μm BIS for 15 min followed by addition of 1 μm TPA for 30 min. Control cells were untreated. Fixed cells (4% paraformaldehyde) were permeabilized (0.2% Triton X-100) and stained with mAb α2 integrin (2AE11, a kind gift from Dr. Fedor Berditchevski, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK) and anti-mouse Alexa-488-IgG. In each sample, 200 cells were analyzed. 3) Cells on coverslips were untreated (negative control), treated with 1 μm TPA for 15 min or 16B4 and anti-mouse Alexa-488-IgG (positive control).

The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA. 2002; Google Scholar). On-line Supplemental Material—Four-dimensional microscopy shows TPA-induced clustering and internalization of α2β1 integrin in Saos-α2 cells. The movie (see supplemental material) was created using BioImageXD. TPA Induces a Ligand-independent but PKCα-dependent Aggregation and Internalization of α2β1 Integrins—Virus and antibody-mediated α2β1 clustering are known to activate PKCα (17Upla P. Marjomaöki V. Kankaanpaöaö P. Ivaska J. Hyypiaö T. Van Der Goot F.G. Heino J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Here, the effect of the phorbol ester TPA, a PKC activator, on integrin clustering and internalization was investigated using Saos osteosarcoma cells transfected to express α2β1 integrin (22Ivaska J. Reunanen H. Westermarck J. Koivisto L. Kaöhaöri V-M. Heino J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 401-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated with TPA, and the experiments were done in the absence of collagen ligands. In four dimensional confocal microscopy studies, both fast macroclustering and internalization of α2β1 integrin induced by TPA were observed (Fig. 1A and supplemental movie). The effect of TPA was comparable with, but not as extensive as, that obtained by secondary antibody-induced clustering, which was used as a positive control (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, the average time for the appearance of clear clusters after TPA addition was about 10 min, and the average time for their internalization was about 14 min. For secondary antibody-induced clustering, these times were about 3.5 and 7 min, respectively. No clustering or internalization was observed in negative control cells that were not stimulated in any way. Furthermore, BIS, a chemical inhibitor of PKCs, prevented the formation of TPA-induced integrin aggregates and their internalization (Fig. 1C). Thus, we propose bidirectional dialog between PKCα activation and integrin aggregation: receptor clustering activates PKCα (17Upla P. Marjomaöki V. Kankaanpaöaö P. Ivaska J. Hyypiaö T. Van Der Goot F.G. Heino J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and PKCα further promotes the aggregation. TPA Increases the Avidity of α2β1-mediated Adhesion to Collagen in a PKC-dependent Manner—We have previously reported a fast and sensitive cell adhesion assay based on the use of collagen-coated polystyrene beads and flow cytometry (27Connors W.L. Heino J. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 337: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This sophisticated method allows accurate studies of the effect of TPA on the integrin avidity for collagen. CHO cells transfected to express either α2β1, α10β1, or mutant α2β1 integrin (α2/α1 chimera) as their only collagen receptor (CHO-α2WT, CHO-α2/α1, CHO-α10WT; Refs. 20Nykvist P. Tu H. Ivaska J.

Biol. 2002; 22: 1352-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) were used. The binding of CHO-α2WT cells to collagen I coated beads was detected by flow cytometry at successive time points (Fig. 2A). Cell adhesion to collagen I appeared to increase nearly linearly for up to 50 min before equilibrating. However, when CHO-α2WT cells were treated with TPA, a significantly faster adhesion, which reached its equilibrium in 40 min, was obvious. At every time point, TPA caused a 50% increase in cell adhesion compared with untreated CHO-α2WT cells (Fig. 2A). Increased adhesion was already clear at the 10 min time point, indicating the rapidity of TPA-induced activation (Fig. 2B). Previously, it has been shown that the cytoplasmic tail of the α2 subunit is required for outside-in signaling mediated by α2β1 integrin (22Ivaska J. Reunanen H. Westermarck J. Koivisto L. Kaöhaöri V-M. Heino J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 401-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 33Ivaska J. Nissinen L. Immonen N. Eriksson J.E. Kaöhaöri V-M. Heino J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1352-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In these studies, a chimeric α2 integrin subunit bearing an α1 cytoplasmic tail (α2/α1) appeared to be unable to mediate heterodimer-specific signals. To investigate the role of the α2 cytoplasmic tail in TPA-activated adhesion, CHO-α2/α1 cells were tested in time series. Temporal profiles of both untreated and TPA-treated CHO-α2/α1 cell adhesion to collagen I resembled the adhesion of CHO-α2WT cells. However, the TPA mediated increase in cell adhesion was substantially higher in CHO-α2/α1 cells than in CHO-α2WT cells (Fig. 2C). Thus, the swap mutation did not affect the ability of the receptor to become activated. CHO cells bearing α10β1 integrin were analyzed similarly (CHO-α10WT; Fig. 2D). In this case, the adhesion in both TPA treated and untreated cells reached saturation at earlier time points than in CHO-α2WT cells (Fig. 2D). Furthermore at the 10-min time point, TPA treatment increased CHO-α10WT cell adhesion to collagen I more than seen in CHO-α2WT or CHO-α2/α1 cells indicating an earlier overall response. Altogether, the results show that the intracellular domains of integrin α subunits may not directly participate in regulation by TPA and that the effect is not limited to the α2β1 heterodimer. To verify that the observed increases in adhesion were mediated by α2β1 integrin, a series of control experiments were performed using CHO-α2WT, CHO-α2/α1, and CHO-pAW cells. All cell types showed an invariably low level of interaction with negative control beads, which were either left uncoated or coated with BSA (Fig. 2E). Additionally, vector-transfected control cells, CHO-pAW cells, did not interact with collagen I-coated beads (Fig. 2E). However, CHO-α2WT and CHO-α2/α1 cells adhered strongly to collagen I-coated beads, revealing a specific interaction. This adhesion, both basal and TPA-mediated, was significantly decreased by pretreating cells with the α2 integrin-specific function blocking mAb P1H5, thereby verifying that adhesion occurred in all conditions via the α2β1 integrin (Fig. 2E). To confirm that the TPA-mediated increase in α2β1 integrin avidity to collagen I uses a PKC-related signaling pathway, the PKC inhibitor, BIS, was tested in the presence and absence of TPA. When CHO-α2WT and CHO-α2/α1 cells were pretreated with BIS, the TPA-mediated cell adhesion to collagen decreased about 35%. However, BIS did not significantly alter the basal adhesion of CHO-α2WT cells to collagen I. In comparison, the PKC inhibitor slightly reduced basal adhesion in CHO-α2/α1 cells (Fig. 2F). Integrin β1 Subunit Is Essential for TPA-related Increase in α2-mediated Cell Adhesion to Collagen I—Talin is a cytoskeletal protein and a well know substrate for PKC (34Litchfield D.W. Ball E.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 1276-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Talin binding to the cytosolic part of the integrin β subunit is typically required for the initiation of integrin activation (35Tadokoro S. Shattil S.J. Eto K. Tai V. Liddington R.C. de Pereda J.M. Ginsberg M.H. Calderwood D.A. Science. 2003; 302: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). To analyze the importance of the β1 subunit in TPA-mediated integrin avidity regulation, we used GD25 cells expressing similar levels of either wild type α2β1 or α2β1 with Y783/795F mutations in the cytoplasmic tail of the β1 subunit (25Grundstroöm G. Mosher D.F. Sakai T. Rubin K. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 291: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Substituting these tyrosine residues in conserved NPXY motifs of the β tail has previously shown to be sufficient to inhibit talin binding (35Tadokoro S. Shattil S.J. Eto K. Tai V. Liddington R.C. de Pereda J.M. Ginsberg M.H. Calderwood D.A. Science. 2003; 302: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar, 36Czuchra A. Meyer H. Legate K.R. Brakebusch C. Faössler R. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 889-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Here, in agreement with previous studies (25Grundstroöm G. Mosher D.F. Sakai T. Rubin K. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 291: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), both wild type α2β1 and α2β1mut integrin heterodimers could mediate cell attachment to collagen I-coated beads when analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 3). Additionally, TPA dramatically increased the collagen binding in GD25-α2β1 cells as expected. In sharp contrast, TPA did not affect the activation of GD25-α2β1mut cells (Fig. 3). The results suggest that integrin β1 subunit is required for appropriate activation of α2β1 heterodimer by TPA. TPA Increases the Number of Conformationally Activated Integrins on the Cell Surface—Recent papers have identified monoclonal antibodies that recognize epitopes corresponding to specific activation states of the α2 integrin subunit (14Cruz M.A. Chen J. Whitelock J.L. Morales L.D. Lopez J.A. Blood. 2005; 105: 1986-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 37Van de Walle G.R. Vanhoorelbeke K. Majer Z. Illyes E. Baert J. Pareyn I. Deckmyn H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36873-36882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, the possibility that treatment with TPA causes α2 integrin conformational activation in CHO-α2WT cells was tested. Cells were stimulated at different time points with TPA, and relative amounts of “total” and open α2 integrin subunit were determined by flow cytometry. Monoclonal α2 integrin-specific antibody 16B4, whose epitope is located outside the ligand binding region of the α2 subunit, was used for determination of total α2. Open α2 conformation was determined using mAb 12F1, which has recently been shown to favor an activated conformation of α2 subunit on platelets (14Cruz M.A. Chen J. Whitelock J.L. Morales L.D. Lopez J.A. Blood. 2005; 105: 1986-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The expression of integrin α2 on the cell surface decreased in the presence of TPA between the first two measured time points (0 and 10 min) in all three independent experiments as shown in Fig. 4. This was not surprising given that some internalization of α2β1 integrin was seen by confocal microscopy in TPA treated Saos cells (Fig. 1). Notwithstanding the initial decrease, the amount of α2 integrin on the cell surface remained stable after 10 min in all three experiments. In contrast, a significant increase in the number of 12F1 epitopes corresponding to the active conformation of α2 integrin was apparent in each experiment beginning at between 20 and 40 min after stimulation with TPA. The increase was transient in each case, lasting from 10 to 20 min before declining to near baseline levels (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the transient conformational activation of the α2 integrin seemed to occur later than the increase in avidity (within 10 min). CHO-α2E336A Cells Retain Adhesion to Collagen, but the Mutation Inhibits TPA-related Conformational Change—In leukocyte β2 integrins, e.g. in αMβ2 and αLβ2 integrins, ligand binding is shown first to cause a change in the conformation of the αI domain, including a downward movement of the α7 helix. This is followed by a similar change in the βI domain, leading to separation of the leg domains of the α and β subunits (1Springer T.A. Wang J.H. Adv. Protein Chem. 2004; 68: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 3Alonso J.L. Essafi M. Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Arnaout M.A. Curr. Biol.

Biol. 2005; 21: 381-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). A conserved glutamate residue on the α7 helix of the αI domain was suggested to act as an intrinsic ligand for the β1I domain. The same structural link between the αI and βI domains seems to be important in integrin inside-out signaling and regulation of affinity. The corresponding glutamate in the α2I domain, the conserved Glu-336, may interact in a similar manner with the β1I domain and participate in the switch between open and closed α2I domain conformations (Fig. 5A). We wanted, however, also to test the hypothesis that the conformational regulation of α2β1 takes place in a different manner than the regulation of αLβ2 and αMβ2. Thus, we mutated amino acid residues Glu-336, Glu-309, and Tyr-410. Glu-309 is located close to the C terminus of the α7 or terminal helix of the α2I domain and potentially could interact with the β1I domain metal binding sites (Fig. 5A). This residue was mutated to alanine to remove the negative charge of the side group. The mutation Y410A was constructed to probe the importance of the interaction between the α2 β-propeller and the β1I domain. A large surface area is buried between these two subunits, and there appears to be a specific interaction at the center of the α2 β-propeller (Fig. 5A). From our molecular models of this specific interaction, based on the αVβ3 crystal structures (2Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar), Tyr-410 could be one of the three aromatic residues involved in a cation-π interaction with β1K269. Disruption of this interaction might lead to defects in signaling and/or conformational activation. CHO cells transfected to express integrin α2 subunits carrying either E309A, Y410A, or E336A mutations (CHO-α2E309A, CHO-α2Y410A, and CHO-α2E336A) were tested by flow cytometry for their ability to adhere to collagen I-coated polystyrene beads. It appeared that the base level adhesion of CHO-α2E336A to collagen I was clearly affected compared with CHO-α2WT cells (Fig. 5B). Mutation Y410A also decreased α2 integrin binding to collagen I, whereas mutation E309A had no effect (Fig. 5B). Reduced CHO-α2E336A cell binding to"

IL-2, a member of a class of cytokines that binds to receptors containing the common gamma chain (gammac) has been shown to reverse anergy. We examined the role of gammac cytokines in reversing HIV specific T cell anergy.PBMC from untreated HIV-infected individuals were briefly exposed to a panel of gammac cytokines, and frequencies of gag specific T cells were enumerated by intracellular IFN-gamma flow cytometry.Of the gammac cytokines, brief exposure to IL-2, IL-15, or combined IL-15/IL-7 significantly enhanced (range 2-7 fold) the CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell IFN-gamma responses to HIV gag, with IL-15 giving the greatest enhancement. The effects of cytokines were not due to enhanced proliferation of pre-existing antigen specific cells, but were due to a combination of enhanced cytokine production from antigen specific T cells plus activation of non-epitope specific T cells.These observations support the notion that a significant number of HIV specific T cells are circulating in an anergic state. IL-2, IL-7 and particularly IL-15 as an immune modulator to reverse HIV-1 specific T cell anergy should be investigated, with the caveat that non-specific activation of T cells may also be induced."
https://openalex.org/W2065550070,"α- and β-spectrins are components of molecular scaffolds located under the lipid bilayer and named membrane skeletons. Disruption of these scaffolds through mutations in spectrins demonstrated that they are involved in the membrane localization or the maintenance of proteins associated with them. The ubiquitous αII-spectrin chain bears in its central region a unique domain that is sensitive to several proteases such as calpains or caspases. The conservation of this region in vertebrates suggests that the proteolysis of αII-spectrin by these enzymes could be involved in important functions. To assess the role of αII-spectrin cleavage in vivo, we generated a murine model in which the exons encoding the region defining this cleavage sensitivity were disrupted by gene targeting. Surprisingly, homozygous mice expressing this mutant αII-spectrin appeared healthy, bred normally, and had no histological anomaly. Remarkably, the mutant αII-spectrin assembles correctly into the membrane skeleton, thus challenging the notion that this region is required for the stable biogenesis of the membrane skeleton in nonerythroid cells. Our finding also argues against a critical role of this particular αII-spectrin cleavage in either major cellular functions or in normal development. α- and β-spectrins are components of molecular scaffolds located under the lipid bilayer and named membrane skeletons.

Our finding also argues against a critical role of this particular αII-spectrin cleavage in either major cellular functions or in normal development. Spectrin was first identified at the inner surface of the red blood cell membrane and is well known to be the central component of the membrane skeleton, a ubiquitous and complex spectrin-actin scaffold. Spectrins are long and flexible molecules composed of two subunits, α and β, that intertwine to form α/β heterodimers. Spectrin is subsequently integrated into the membrane skeleton as (α/β)2 tetramers resulting from the self-association of α/β heterodimers (1Byers T.J. Branton D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6153-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). These tetramers constitute the filaments of the lattice, the nodes of which are cross-linked by short actin filaments (2Mohandas N. An X. Transfus Clin. Biol. 2006; 13: 29-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Each spectrin subunit is mainly composed of a succession of triple helical repeats. The spectrin-based membrane skeleton is responsible for the characteristic shape and the unique physical properties of red blood cells, such as deformability and remarkable stability to shear stress. Defects in components of this network lead to membrane fragility and are associated with various hemolytic anemias (3Delaunay J. Blood Rev. 2007; 21: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This membrane skeleton network was identified in all nonerythroid mammalian cells with components, including spectrins, that are very similar to those found into red blood cells but in most cases are expressed by different genes. There are only two genes encodingα-spectrins. TheαI-spectrin is mainly expressed into red blood cells in association with βI. The ubiquitous αII-spectrin (also named α-fodrin) is actually considered as the major α-spectrin expressed in nonerythroid cells, and the αII/βII heterodimers are the main species described in these cells. Disruption of membrane skeletons through β-spectrin mutations was found to be responsible for the abnormal localization or the maintenance of proteins associated with spectrin-based complexes (4Ikeda Y. Dick K.A. Weatherspoon M.R. Gincel D. Armbrust K.R. Dalton J.C. Stevanin G. Durr A. Zuhlke C. Burk K. Clark H.B. Brice A. Rothstein J.D. Schut L.J. Day J.W. Ranum L.P. Nat.

There are no mammalian models describing αII-spectrin mutations. Defects in the unique α-spectrin ortholog to the αII-gene from vertebrates are lethal in larva in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, arguing for the crucial role of the entire protein (8Lee J.K.

Biol. 2005; 283: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). αII-spectrin differs from the erythroid αI-spectrin mainly in one feature as follows: the presence of a short region consisting of 36 amino acids encoded by three exons and located in the middle part of the protein near an SH3 2The abbreviations used are: SH, Src homology; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; BDP, breakdown product; MEF, murine embryonic fibroblast; PGK, phosphoglycerate kinase; ES, embryonic stem; ALLN, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal. 2The abbreviations used are: SH, Src homology; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; BDP, breakdown product; MEF, murine embryonic fibroblast; PGK, phosphoglycerate kinase; ES, embryonic stem; ALLN, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal. domain. This region bears several cleavage sites for different proteases, including calpains and caspases. Moreover, it contains a binding site for calmodulin, and a calmodulin/αII-spectrin interaction was shown to regulate the cleavage by calpains and caspases (11Rotter B. Kroviarski Y. Nicolas G. Dhermy D. Lecomte M.C. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We and others found that calpain cleavage is also regulated by phospho/dephosphorylation of the tyrosine residue (position 1176) located in the calpain recognition site (12Nicolas G. Fournier C.M. Galand C. Malbert-Colas L. Bournier O. Kroviarski Y. Bourgeois M. Camonis J.H. Dhermy D. Grandchamp B. Lecomte M.C. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2003; 278: 7735-7741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that this region here named CCC (for calpain, caspase, calmodulin) is also targeted by proteases (e.g. Pet) secreted by pathological enteroaggregative strains of Escherichia coli (14Canizalez-Roman A. Navarro-Garcia F. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 947-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 15Navarro-Garcia F. Canizalez-Roman A. Sui B.Q. Nataro J.P. Azamar Y. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 3609-3621Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Our working hypothesis is that specific proteolysis of αII-spectrin by proteases such as calpains and caspases could be a pathway for local and global membrane skeleton reorganization that occurs during different cellular mechanisms such as cell shape regulation, cell differentiation, motility, or cytokinesis (16Simonovic M. Zhang Z. Cianci C.D. Steitz T.A. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34333-34340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As an example, cells treated with the Pet protease underwent actin remodeling, which might be the consequence of αII-spectrin cutting (15Navarro-Garcia F. Canizalez-Roman A. Sui B.Q. Nataro J.P. Azamar Y. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 3609-3621Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cleavage by calpains could be more physiological than cutting by caspases, which are mainly activated during the irreversible apoptotic process. However, calpains can also be overactivated in pathological conditions (17Harwood S.M. Yaqoob M.M. Allen D.A. Ann. Clin. Biochem. 2005; 42: 415-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the αII-spectrin cleavage during apoptosis can be responsible for the membrane blebbing, which is typical in this process. To address in vivo the role of the CCC αII-spectrin region, we generated mice in which this region is deleted by using gene targeting. This is the first report concerning the description of a murine mutant for αII-spectrin. Surprisingly, homozygous mice expressing this mutant spectrin are healthy, breed normally, and present no histological anomaly, arguing against the role of this particular αII-spectrin cleavage in either major cellular functions or in normal development. Construction of the Targeting Vector—Both Spna1 and Spna2 genes encoding αI- and αII-spectrin, respectively, have similar intron-exon organizations. The main difference consists in the presence of three additional exons in the Spna2 gene, which encode the specific CCC region of αII-spectrin (Fig. 1). The first exon (24 bp), which we arbitrarily named exon “24b” (to respect the nomenclature of other exons based on intron-exon organization of Spna1 gene), encodes an 8-amino acid sequence containing the calpain cleavage site. The two following exons, exons “24c” (36 bp) and “24d” (48 bp), encode the caspase cleavage site and the calmodulin binding domain, respectively. We also named “Σ1” for the alternative spliced exon located between exons 22 and 23, which encodes a 20-amino acid sequence specific for the αIIΣ1 isoform. Our strategy consists of the elimination of these three exons using a classical knockout approach. However, the rest of the encoded mutant αII-spectrin was kept intact as the deletion should not impair the translation reading frame. To evaluate the splicing of the chimeric intron resulting from Cre recombination, a minigene model was developed. A genomic DNA portion of the murine Spna2 gene, including exon 24, chimeric intron 24/24d, and exon 25, was cloned into pcDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen). After transfection of this construct into NIH-3T3 fibroblastic cells, we demonstrated that this chimeric intron was correctly spliced using reverse transcription-PCR (data not shown). The targeted mutation was introduced at the Spna2 locus by homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells. The targeting construct was assembled as follows. All amplifications were performed with Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). All primers were from Invitrogen or MWG Biotec. Genomic DNA (129/Sv) was amplified using primers 5′-cagtcagcctcgagggagaacc-3′ and 5′-gggggatccaaccaagggcaccacagacac-3′, and the 3.5-kbp amplified product was cloned into XhoI-BamHI-linearized pBluescript II KS plasmid (Stratagene). The resulting plasmid was linearized with BamHI and NotI, and a 3.6-kbp fragment amplified with primers 5′-gggggatccttaagttcctaagttccttaaatagataagtgttttg-3′ and 5′-ataagaatgcggccgcataacttcgtatagcatacattatacgaagttatttgaatacttggtcccctttgga-3′ (LoxP site is underlined) was subcloned (after digestion with BamHI and NotI). The resulting plasmid was linearized with NotI and SacII and a 3.5-kbp fragment amplified with primers 5′-gggggatccataacttcgtataatgtatgctatacgaagttatgcggccgcacatgagcctatgggagtcattctc-3′ (LoxP site is underlined) and 5′-tccccgcggctcgagacctgtcaagtcatgaagcccagtc-3′ was subcloned (after digestion with NotI and SacII). The resulting plasmid was linearized with BamHI to receive a 2.1-kbp “floxed” PGK promoter/hygromycin resistance cassette (a generous gift from Marco Giovannini, INSERM U434, Paris, France). Orientation of the cassette was checked. Each cloned fragment was completely sequenced at each step. No mutation was found when compared with sequences from data bases. The 12.7-kbp recombination fragment was separated from pBluescript II KS backbone using XhoI digestion, agarose electrophoresis, gel purification QIAquick PCR purification kit, Qiagen), and then a second purification (QIAquick PCR purification kit, Qiagen). Gene Targeting in ES Cells and Generation of Chimeras—Following linearization at the XhoI site, the 12.7-kbp targeting vector was electroporated into 129/Sv-ter ES cells grown on feeder layers (Mouse Clinical Institute, Illkirch, France). After hygromycin selection (150 μg/ml), DNA of resistant clones was analyzed by Southern blot and PCR strategies to identify correctly targeted ES cells. To generate chimeras, targeted ES cells were injected into C57BL/6J host blastocysts that were transferred into foster females. Male chimeras were selected by coat color and crossed with C57BL/6J females to obtain germ line transmission of the targeted Spna2 allele. Males chimeras were then bred with 129/Sv-ter females in order to put the targeted allele on a homogeneous 129/Sv genetic background. The Cre recombination was performed by crossing mice bearing the targeted Spna2 allele with the MeuCre40 transgenic line (18Leneuve P. Colnot S. Hamard G. Francis F. Niwa-Kawakita M. Giovannini M. Holzenberger M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e21Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recombined alleles were then segregated by crossing the mosaic mice with 129/Sv mice (Charles River Laboratories). In this study we focused only on the allele that recombined between the LoxP site 1 and LoxP site 3 (see Fig. 1). All experiments were performed in compliance with French laws on animal care, using relevant INSERM guidelines. Genotype Analysis—Genotyping on mouse DNA was performed using Southern blot (data not shown, available upon request) or by using a multiplex PCR to identify wild-type and Spna2 knock-out alleles. Genomic DNA (0.1–0.5 μg) was used in a 25-μl reaction that included five primers as follows: primer 1, 5′-gatctgaaagccaatgagtctcggc-3′ (forward, annealing in exon 24); primer 2, 5′-tacatagagaatggccagtcttttgac-3′ (forward, annealing in intron 24d), primer 3, 5′-gcacaactgggtaaggttcctattcc-3′ (reverse, annealing in intron 24d), primer 4, 5′-cccggcattctgcacgcttc-3′ (forward, annealing in PGKhygro cassette) and primer 5- 5′ tccatggcctccgcgaccg 3′ (reverse, annealing in PGKhygro cassette). The wild-type Spna2S allele amplifies a single amplicon (201 bp with primers 2 + 3, see Fig. 2A); the targeted Spna2 allele amplifies two amplicons (243 bp with primers 2 + 3 and 450 bp with primers 4 + 5), and the Cre recombined (LoxP site 1 with LoxP site 3) Spna2R allele amplifies one single amplicon (374 bp with primers 1 + 3, see Fig. 2A). PCR was performed as follows: 35 cycles (each cycle consisting of 20 s at 94 °C, 20 s at 65 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C) with an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 4 min, and a final elongation at 72 °C for 5 min in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm each dNTP, 0.18 mm each primer 1–3, 0.2 mm each primer 4–5, 0.5 unit of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). The reaction was analyzed on 2% agarose gel containing SYBR Safe (Invitrogen). This PCR method for genotyping gave the same results as Southern blot (data not shown). Cre transgene genotyping was performed as described (19Rubera I. Poujeol C. Bertin G. Hasseine L. Counillon L. Poujeol P. Tauc M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 2050-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription—Total RNA was extracted from organs biopsies with RNA PLUS™ (Q-Biogen). The cDNA synthesis was performed in 20 μl with 2 μg of total RNA, in the presence of 0.5 mm of each dNTP, 10 ng/μl of random hexanucleotide primers, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1 unit/μl RNase OUT (Invitrogen), 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 units/μl SuperScript™ reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The reaction was conducted for 65 min at 42 °C before reverse transcriptase was inactivated for 6 min at 96 °C. After reaction, cDNA was diluted with 80 μlof10mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). PCR amplification was performed with 2.5 μlof reverse transcriptase reaction mixture in 25 μlof20mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm each dNTP, 0.2 mm each primer as follows: forward, 5′-gggaagcttccaccatggatctgaaagccaatgagtctcggc-3′ (annealing in exon 24), and reverse, 5′-gggctcgaggtgaaacctctgtacttcgtgtgcac-3′ (annealing in exon 25), 0.5 units of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). PCR was performed as follows: 30 cycles (each cycle consisting of 20 s at 94 °C, 20 s at 60 °C, and 40 s at 72 °C) with an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 5 min, and a final elongation step at 72 °C for 5 min. The reaction was analyzed on 1.5% agarose gel containing SYBR Safe (Invitrogen). Primary Murine Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs)—Primary fibroblast cultures were established from E13.5 embryos. The time of fertilization was determined by observation of copulation plugs, and noon of that day was defined as E0.5. Embryos were dissected from pregnant mutant (Spna2R/R) females that had been bred with mutant males or from wild-type females (Spna2S/S) that had been bred with wild-type males. The yolk sacs, heads, and internal organs were removed. Carcasses were carefully rinsed with D-PBS (Invitrogen), cut into very small pieces with fine scissors, and treated with trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen; 4 ml per embryo) for 5 min at 37 °C under agitation. Clumps of cells were disrupted by repeated aspirations through a 5-ml pipette. The trypsin was neutralized by adding an equal volume of culture medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (4.5 g/liter glucose, 110 mg/liter pyruvate sodium, 862 mg/liter GlutaMAX™ I) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in culture medium and plated onto 10-cm plates. Fibroblasts were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cells were diluted at a 1:5 ratio 24 h later on new plates, and confluence was obtained 3 days later. They were frozen in 90% fetal bovine serum with 10% Me2SO. Cells were passed every three or 4 days. We observed a growth crisis after passage 5 (approximately 2 weeks), so the study presented here was only performed with fibroblasts maintained at passage 4 maximum. When indicated, cells were preincubated with 5 μm calpain inhibitor I (N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN); BioMol). Induction of Apoptosis—Apoptosis was triggered using either 1 mm H2O2 during 24 h in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% FBS or UV irradiation (312 nm) for 5 min. The UV irradiation was delivered by six bulbs (15 watts, T15M) on a 35 × 20 cm surface. Caspase and Calpain Cleavage Assay—Organs were submitted to an Ultraturrax rotor in the following ice-cold lysis buffer: 50 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton, 2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml bestatin. For post-mortem analysis, pieces of liver were kept at 4 °C for 48 h and were then treated as the other organs. Tritonsoluble extracts correspond to the supernatant obtained after centrifugation at 13,000 rpm (Eppendorf 5415R Centrifuge) for 20 min (4 °C) of the lysed organs previously kept on ice for 20 min. The pellets were further solubilized in the same lysis buffer containing 1% SDS and kept on ice for 20 min; insoluble extracts correspond to the supernatant obtained after centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 20 min (4 °C) of these resuspended pellets. Extracts from MEF culture were obtained in a similar way except that samples were vigorously vortexed instead of treatment with the Ultraturrax rotor. Protein concentration was measured using the micro-BC assay protein quantification kit (Uptima) with bovine serum albumin (62.5 to 2000 ng) as standard samples. Wild-type or mutant endogenous αII-spectrin present in Triton-soluble cell lysates were submitted to exogenous recombinant proteases. Recombinant caspase 2 (catalog number SE-175, Biomol) and caspase 3 (catalog number 235417, Calbiochem, or catalog number C-1305, A. G. Scientific) were used at 1.5–1.7 units/μl of reaction in 10 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) CHAPS, and 50 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) (final volume, 60 μl) for 2 (caspase 2) or 2–4 h (caspase 3) at 30 °C. Digestion with μ-calpains (catalog number C6108, Sigma) was used with 3.2 units/μl of reaction in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 nm recombinant calmodulin for 1 h at 30 °C (final volume, 60 μl). Cleavage reactions were stopped by addition of electrophoresis sample buffer, and the proteins were analyzed by Western blot. Western Blotting—Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (7% polyacrylamide gel) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Optitran®, Schleicher & Schuell) using a Tris/glycine buffer (Bio-Rad). After saturation in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), and 5% (w/v) nonfat-milk, blots were probed with specific antibodies. Antibodies used are as follows: immunopurified anti-SH3 domain of αII-spectrin (10 ng/ml (12Nicolas G. Fournier C.M. Galand C. Malbert-Colas L. Bournier O. Kroviarski Y. Bourgeois M. Camonis J.H. Dhermy D. Grandchamp B. Lecomte M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3527-3536Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar)); anti-αII-spectrin monoclonal antibody (50 ng/ml, FG 6090 antibody, clone AA6; BioHit); immunopurified anti-CCC region obtained by immunization of rabbits against the NH2-Cys-Ser-Lys-Thr-Ala-Ser-Pro-Trp-Lys-Ser-Ala-Arg-Leu-Met-Val-His-Thr-Val-Ala-Thr-Phe-Asn-Ser-Ile-Lys-COOH peptide coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (1:500 dilution; Covalab). The antibodies against the mutant αII-spectrin were obtained by immunization of rabbits with NH2-Ala-Val-Gln-Gln-Gln-Glu-Leu-Asn-Glu-Arg-COOH peptide coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (200 ng/ml; DB-BioRun). Immunopurifications were performed against the immunization peptide or recombinant αII-spectrin peptide with HiTrap column (Amersham Biosciences). Immunocomplexes with immunopurified antibodies against mutant αII-spectrin were performed in 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm CaCl2. Other immunocomplexes were formed in PBST with or without 5% (w/v) nonfat milk. Detections were performed with either anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Nordic Immunological Laboratories) using the Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce) and Gel Doc™ system (Bio-Rad). Immunohistochemistry on MEF—Cells cultured on glass slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and washed in PBS. Free aldehyde groups were blocked by 50 mm NH4Cl for 10 min. Slides were washed in PBS, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton for 15 min, and washed again in PBS. To reduce nonspecific binding, slides were incubated in 0.1% PBS/BSA for 15 min. They were then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-SH3 αII-spectrin antibody diluted at 2 μg/ml (0.1% PBS/BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. After washings (0.1% PBS/BSA), slides were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Alexa Fluor™ 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200 dilution) and Alexa Fluor™ 568 phalloidin (1:50 dilution; Molecular Probes) diluted in 0.1% PBS/BSA. Samples were examined by confocal microscopy using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope equipped with a 60× oil immersion objective NA 1.4 and a D-Eclipse C1 confocal system. Immunohistochemistry on Tissue Sections—Organs were fixed in 4% formaldehyde (Carlo Erba) in PBS and embedded in paraffin, and 3-μm sections of the paraffin block were deparaffinized with EZ-DeWax™ (BioGenex). Rehydration was completed in demineralized water. Slides were then incubated in 1× Target Retrieval Solution at pH 9.0 (DakoCytomation) and heated for 40 min at 98 °C in a heated water bath. This step unmasked antigen and allowed immunostaining on formaldehyde-fixed paraffin sections, as determined in preliminary experiments (not shown). The tank containing slides was cooled at room temperature for 20 min. To reduce nonspecific binding, sections were rinsed in 0.1% PBS/BSA for 5 min and preincubated for 20 min with antibody diluent with background reducing components (DakoCytomation). The labeling procedure was as follows: affinity-purified anti-SH3 antibodies (4 μg/ml), diluted in antibody diluent with background reducing components, were applied for 1 h at room temperature. After intensive washes with 0.1% PBS/BSA, sections were incubated with a 1:200 dilution (in antibody diluent with background reducing components) of Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by washings in 0.1% PBS/BSA. Nuclei were labeled by incubation of 0.2 μg/ml propidium iodide in 0.1% PBS/BSA for 15 min. Sections were mounted with ProLong™ Gold (Molecular Probes) and then examined by confocal microscopy. We took advantage of the platform present at the Mouse Clinical Institute (Illkirch, France) to perform an extensive histological analysis on mutant males (n = 3) or females (n = 3) and control wild-type male (n = 1) and female mice (n = 1). Mice were 6 months old. Organ biopsies analyzed were the salivary glands, pancreas, stomach (trimmed after fixation), duodenum, distal ileum, proximal colon, liver (the median lobe and half of the left lateral lobe), spleen, kidney (trim before fixation), urinary bladder, adrenal glands (both), mesenteric lymph nodes, thoracic aorta, trachea, thyroid gland, esophagus, thymus, heart, entire lung, leg muscle, tongue, white adipose tissue (paragenital fat pad), brown adipose tissue, dorsal tail, footpad and snout skin, eye, Harderian gland, knee joint, brain, and hypophysis. Specific samples from males were preputial gland, right testis and epididymis (fixed in Bouin's fluid), left testis, and epididymis (fixed in neutral buffered formalin), prostate and seminal vesicles. Supplementary samples from females were ovaries, oviducts, vagina, uterus body, uterine horns, and urinary bladder. Ka/Ks Values—The Ka/Ks value is the ratio of the number of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (Ka) to the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks), with Ks indicating the background rate of evolution. These parameters allow an estimation of the selective forces acting on a protein sequence during evolution. If a sequence should be kept intact, a Ka/Ks value lower than 1 is expected. The process is called “purifying selection.” The Ka/Ks analysis was performed using DnaSP software using cDNA from exons 23 to 27 and protein sequences available from Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Bos taurus, Canis familiaris, and Gallus gallus. Analysis of the Selection Pressure on the Central Domain of the αII-spectrin Using the KA/KS Evaluation Method—Analysis of the CCC sequences from data bases reveals that this region is highly conserved in vertebrates but does not exist in invertebrates. To estimate the level of constraint on the CCC region, we aligned the orthologous sequences of exon 24b, 24c, and 24d from different species (Tables 1 and 2). Compared with human, the murine sequence (separated by 91 million years (20Hedges S.B. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar)) shows 3 nonsynonymous mutations and 12 synonymous mutations in exon 24b, 24c, and 24d with the consequence that there are only two substitutions leading to amino acid change, giving a Ka/Ks of 0.051 (Tables 1 and 2). Compared with human, the chicken sequence (separated by 310 million years (20Hedges S.B. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar)) shows 1 nonsynonymous mutation and 13 synonymous mutations resulting in only one substitution at the protein level and a Ka/Ks of 0.013. These data reveal that the CCC region is under a strong purifying selection. The pressure to keep intact the protein sequence suggests that the CCC region has at least one important function. It should be noted that the purifying selection is not restricted to the CCC region because Ka/Ks values <<1 were also found when flanking exons (exon 23 to exon 27) were analyzed.TABLE 1Ka/Ks values of the CCC region Alignment of the nucleotide and amino acid (in black) sequences of exons 24b, 24c, and 24d of αII-spectrin from various species.

https://openalex.org/W1997961423,"Transposable elements are major components of most eukaryotic genomes. Such sequences are generally defective for transposition and have little or no coding capacity. Because transposition can be highly mutagenic, mobile elements that remain functional are tightly repressed in all living species. Drosophila pericentromeric heterochromatin naturally contains transposition-defective, non-coding derivatives of a LINE retrotransposon related to the I-factor. The I-factor is a good model to study the regulation of transposition in vivo because, under specific conditions, current functional copies of this mobile element can transpose at high frequency, specifically in female germ cells, with deleterious effects including female sterility. However, this high transpositional activity becomes spontaneously repressed upon ageing or heat treatment, by a maternally transmitted, transgenerational epigenetic mechanism of unknown nature. We have analyzed, by quantitative real time RT-PCR, the RNA profile of the transposition-defective I-related sequences, in the Drosophila ovary during ageing and upon heat treatment, and also in female somatic tissues and in males, which are not permissive for I-factor transposition. We found evidence for a role of transcripts from these ancestral remnants in the natural epigenetic protection of the Drosophila melanogaster genome against the deleterious effects of new invasions by functional I-factors. These results provide a molecular basis for a probably widespread natural protection against transposable elements by persisting vestiges of ancient invasions."

YOYO-1, a fluorescent bis-intercalator, promotes and signals the formation of the specific triplex. Genomic duplexes may be assayed homogeneously with single base pair resolution. The specific triple-stranded structures of the assay may approximate homologous recombination intermediates, which various models suggest may form in either the major or minor groove of the duplex. The bases of the stable duplex target are rendered specifically reactive to the bases of the probe because of the activity of intercalated YOYO-1, which is known to decondense duplex locally 1.3 fold. This may approximate the local decondensation effected by recombination proteins such as RecA in vivo. Our assay, while involving triplex formation, is sui generis, as it is not homopurine sequence-dependent, as are “canonical triplexes”. Rather, the base pair-specific heteropolymeric triplex of the assay is conformation-dependent. The highly sensitive diagnostic assay we present allows for the direct detection of base sequence in genomic duplex samples, including those containing human genomic duplex DNA, thereby bypassing the inherent problems and cost associated with conventional PCR based diagnostic assays."
https://openalex.org/W2128303081,"Movement formulas, engrams, kinesthetic images and internal models of the body in action are notions derived mostly from clinical observations of brain-damaged subjects. They also suggest that the prehensile geometry of an object is integrated in the neural circuits and includes the object's graspable characteristics as well as its semantic properties. In order to determine whether there is a conjoined representation of the graspable characteristics of an object in relation to the actual grasping, it is necessary to separate the graspable (low-level) from the semantic (high-level) properties of the object. Right-handed subjects were asked to grasp and lift a smooth 300-g cylinder with one hand, before and after judging the level of difficulty of a “grasping for pouring” action, involving a smaller cylinder and using the opposite hand. The results showed that simulated grasps with the right hand exert a direct influence on actual motor acts with the left hand. These observations add to the evidence that there is a conjoined representation of the graspable characteristics of the object and the biomechanical constraints of the arm."
