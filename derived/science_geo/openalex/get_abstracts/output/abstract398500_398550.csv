https://openalex.org/W2114022883,"Constitutively active androgen receptor variants (AR-V) lacking the ligand binding domain (LBD) may promote the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The expression of AR-Vs in the clinically most important metastatic site, the bone, has, however, not been well documented. Our aim was therefore to compare levels of AR-Vs in hormone-naive (HN) and CRPC bone metastases in comparison to primary PC and non-malignant prostate tissue, as well as in relation to AR protein expression, whole-genome transcription profiles and patient survival.Hormone-naïve (n = 10) and CRPC bone metastases samples (n = 30) were obtained from 40 patients at metastasis surgery. Non-malignant and malignant prostate samples were acquired from 13 prostatectomized men. Levels of full length AR (ARfl) and AR-Vs termed AR-V1, AR-V7, and AR-V567es mRNA were measured with RT-PCR and whole-genome transcription profiles with an Illumina Beadchip array. Protein levels were examined by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Transcripts for ARfl, AR-V1, and AR-V7 were detected in most primary tumors and metastases, and levels were significantly increased in CRPC bone metastases. The AR-V567es transcript was detected in 23% of the CRPC bone metastases only. A sub-group of CRPC bone metastases expressed LBD-truncated AR proteins at levels comparable to the ARfl. Detectable AR-V567es and/or AR-V7 mRNA in the upper quartile, seen in 1/3 of all CRPC bone metastases, was associated with a high nuclear AR immunostaining score, disturbed cell cycle regulation and short survival.Expression of AR-Vs is increased in CRPC compared to HN bone metastases and associated with a particularly poor prognosis. Further studies are needed to test if patients expressing such AR-Vs in their bone metastases benefit more from drugs acting on or down-stream of these AR-Vs than from therapies inhibiting androgen synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2043154679,"Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many loci associated with body mass index (BMI), but few studies focused on obesity as a binary trait. Here we report the results of a GWAS and candidate SNP genotyping study of obesity, including extremely obese cases and never overweight controls as well as families segregating extreme obesity and thinness. We first performed a GWAS on 520 cases (BMI>35 kg/m(2)) and 540 control subjects (BMI<25 kg/m(2)), on measures of obesity and obesity-related traits. We subsequently followed up obesity-associated signals by genotyping the top ∼500 SNPs from GWAS in the combined sample of cases, controls and family members totaling 2,256 individuals. For the binary trait of obesity, we found 16 genome-wide significant signals within the FTO gene (strongest signal at rs17817449, P = 2.5 × 10(-12)). We next examined obesity-related quantitative traits (such as total body weight, waist circumference and waist to hip ratio), and detected genome-wide significant signals between waist to hip ratio and NRXN3 (rs11624704, P = 2.67 × 10(-9)), previously associated with body weight and fat distribution. Our study demonstrated how a relatively small sample ascertained through extreme phenotypes can detect genuine associations in a GWAS."
https://openalex.org/W1998231556,"Modern agriculture is based on the notion that nitrate is the main source of nitrogen (N) for crops, but nitrate is also the most mobile form of N and easily lost from soil. Efficient acquisition of nitrate by crops is therefore a prerequisite for avoiding off-site N pollution. Sugarcane is considered the most suitable tropical crop for biofuel production, but surprisingly high N fertilizer applications in main producer countries raise doubt about the sustainability of production and are at odds with a carbon-based crop. Examining reasons for the inefficient use of N fertilizer, we hypothesized that sugarcane resembles other giant tropical grasses which inhibit the production of nitrate in soil and differ from related grain crops with a confirmed ability to use nitrate. The results of our study support the hypothesis that N-replete sugarcane and ancestral species in the Andropogoneae supertribe strongly prefer ammonium over nitrate. Sugarcane differs from grain crops, sorghum and maize, which acquired both N sources equally well, while giant grass, Erianthus, displayed an intermediate ability to use nitrate. We conclude that discrimination against nitrate and a low capacity to store nitrate in shoots prevents commercial sugarcane varieties from taking advantage of the high nitrate concentrations in fertilized soils in the first three months of the growing season, leaving nitrate vulnerable to loss. Our study addresses a major caveat of sugarcane production and affords a strong basis for improvement through breeding cultivars with enhanced capacity to use nitrate as well as through agronomic measures that reduce nitrification in soil."
https://openalex.org/W2092938083,"Huntington's disease-like-2 (HDL2) is a phenocopy of Huntington's disease caused by CTG/CAG repeat expansion at the Junctophilin-3 (JPH3) locus. The mechanisms underlying HDL2 pathogenesis remain unclear. Here we developed a BAC transgenic mouse model of HDL2 (BAC-HDL2) that exhibits progressive motor deficits, selective neurodegenerative pathology, and ubiquitin-positive nuclear inclusions (NIs). Molecular analyses reveal a promoter at the transgene locus driving the expression of a CAG repeat transcript (HDL2-CAG) from the strand antisense to JPH3, which encodes an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) protein. Importantly, BAC-HDL2 mice, but not control BAC mice, accumulate polyQ-containing NIs in a pattern strikingly similar to those in the patients. Furthermore, BAC mice with genetic silencing of the expanded CUG transcript still express HDL2-CAG transcript and manifest polyQ pathogenesis. Finally, studies of HDL2 mice and patients revealed CBP sequestration into NIs and evidence for interference of CBP-mediated transcriptional activation. These results suggest overlapping polyQ-mediated pathogenic mechanisms in HD and HDL2."
https://openalex.org/W2069541965,"High salinity soils inhibit crop production worldwide and represent a serious agricultural problem. To meet our ever-increasing demand for food, it is essential to understand and engineer salt-resistant crops. In this study, we evaluated the occurrence and function of sulfated polysaccharides in plants. Although ubiquitously present in marine algae, the presence of sulfated polysaccharides among the species tested was restricted to halophytes, suggesting a possible correlation with salt stress or resistance. To test this hypothesis, sulfated polysaccharides from plants artificially and naturally exposed to different salinities were analyzed. Our results revealed that the sulfated polysaccharide concentration, as well as the degree to which these compounds were sulfated in halophytic species, were positively correlated with salinity. We found that sulfated polysaccharides produced by Ruppia maritima Loisel disappeared when the plant was cultivated in the absence of salt. However, subjecting the glycophyte Oryza sativa Linnaeus to salt stress did not induce the biosynthesis of sulfated polysaccharides but increased the concentration of the carboxylated polysaccharides; this finding suggests that negatively charged cell wall polysaccharides might play a role in coping with salt stress. These data suggest that the presence of sulfated polysaccharides in plants is an adaptation to high salt environments, which may have been conserved during plant evolution from marine green algae. Our results address a practical biological concept; additionally, we suggest future strategies that may be beneficial when engineering salt-resistant crops."
https://openalex.org/W2093277182,"Neuronal function depends on the properties of the synaptic inputs the neuron receive and on its intrinsic responsive properties. However, the conditions for synaptic integration and activation of intrinsic responses may to a large extent depend on the level of background synaptic input. In this respect, the deep cerebellar nuclear (DCN) neurons are of particular interest: they feature a massive background synaptic input and an intrinsic, postinhibitory rebound depolarization with profound effects on the synaptic integration. Using in vivo whole cell patch clamp recordings from DCN cells in the cat, we find that the background of Purkinje cell input provides a tonic inhibitory synaptic noise in the DCN cell. Under these conditions, individual Purkinje cells appear to have a near negligible influence on the DCN cell and clear-cut rebounds are difficult to induce. Peripheral input that drives the simple spike output of the afferent PCs to the DCN cell generates a relatively strong DCN cell inhibition, but do not induce rebounds. In contrast, synchronized climbing fiber activation, which leads to a synchronized input from a large number of Purkinje cells, can induce profound rebound responses. In light of what is known about climbing fiber activation under behaviour, the present findings suggest that DCN cell rebound responses may be an unusual event. Our results also suggest that cortical modulation of DCN cell output require a substantial co-modulation of a large proportion of the PCs that innervate the cell, which is a possible rationale for the existence of the cerebellar microcomplex."
https://openalex.org/W2115129558,"Proteins vital to presynaptic function are synthesized in the neuronal perikarya and delivered into synapses via two modes of axonal transport. While membrane-anchoring proteins are conveyed in fast axonal transport via motor-driven vesicles, cytosolic proteins travel in slow axonal transport via mechanisms that are poorly understood. We found that in cultured axons, populations of cytosolic proteins tagged to photoactivatable GFP (PAGFP) move with a slow motor-dependent anterograde bias distinct from both vesicular trafficking and diffusion of untagged PAGFP. The overall bias is likely generated by an intricate particle kinetics involving transient assembly and short-range vectorial spurts. In vivo biochemical studies reveal that cytosolic proteins are organized into higher order structures within axon-enriched fractions that are largely segregated from vesicles.

Proteins are delivered to synapses by both fast and slow axonal transport The slow axonal transport of cytosolic proteins is poorly defined Our studies show that cytosolic cargoes move as slow biased streams in axons Working model: cytosolic proteins organize into complexes driven by motors The vast majority of the proteins in a neuron are synthesized in cell-bodies and conveyed into axons and presynapses via axonal transport. Distal presynaptic boutons are critically dependent on axonal transport throughout life and functional organization of the adult neuronal circuitry relies upon continued protein synthesis and transport (Kleim et al., 2003Kleim J.A. Bruneau R. Calder K. Pocock D. VandenBerg P.M. MacDonald E. Monfils M.H. Sutherland R.J. Nader K.

Previous pulse-chase radiolabeling studies have shown that newly synthesized proteins are conveyed via two distinct modes of transport. While proteins with membrane-spanning or anchoring domains are packaged into vesicles and conveyed via fast axonal transport at overall rates of 50–400 mm/day (0.5–4 μm/s), cytosolic proteins lacking such domains are transported much more slowly in a transport group historically called Slow Component b (SCb) at rates of 1–10 mm/day (0.01–0.1 μm/s) (reviewed in Brown, 2003Brown A.

Of the 200+ cytosolic proteins that are conveyed in slow axonal transport, many are enriched at presynaptic terminals as shown by detailed radiolabeling studies (Garner and Mahler, 1987Garner J.A. Mahler H.R. Biogenesis of presynaptic terminal proteins.J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Similar studies have also characterized the transport of two well-known presynaptic proteins—synapsin and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CamKIIa)—showing that after perikaryal synthesis, the vast majority of these synaptic proteins move with slow overall rates, whereas a smaller fraction (≈15%) is conveyed rapidly in fast axonal transport (Baitinger and Willard, 1987Baitinger C.

Axonal transport kinetics and posttranslational modification of synapsin I in mouse retinal ganglion cells.J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2938-2946PubMed Google Scholar). By their very nature, pulse-chase radiolabeling experiments offer a descriptive and indirect view of axonal transport and provide little insight into the mechanisms that generate this motion. Thus, though the overall transport of these synaptic proteins was described decades ago, critical questions remain unanswered. How do inherently soluble proteins move in this slow sustained manner? What is the underlying molecular basis of this movement? What (if any) is the role of diffusion in this process? What is the nature of the minor pool that is conveyed in fast axonal transport? To date, no evidence-based model can provide molecular details that can adequately explain the slow sustained transit of soluble proteins seen in the classic radiolabeling studies decades ago. To address these questions we developed an assay for cytosolic cargo transport in cultured neurons by using photoactivatable vectors, in which we could visualize bulk cargo movement and particle dynamics with high resolution. Coupled with in vivo biochemical assays and data-driven biophysical modeling, we show that cytosolic synaptic proteins employ atypical transport strategies. These studies provide evidence for a detailed model that can explain the mechanistic logic behind the axonal transport of these cytosolic cargoes in neurons, providing insights into a long-standing scientific question. To investigate bulk axonal transport of cytosolic protein populations, we transfected cultured hippocampal neurons with synapsin (synapsin-Ia) or CamKIIa tagged to photoactivatable green fluorescent protein (PAGFP), selectively photoactivated discrete protein pools within the primary axon emerging from the soma (away from presynaptic boutons), and tracked the mobility of photoactivated cytosolic protein populations at various time compressions (Figures 1 and 2). We focused our studies on two cytosolic proteins enriched at synapses—synapsin and CamKIIa—as radiolabeling studies have established the overall transport of these proteins, showing that they are largely conveyed by slow axonal transport (Baitinger and Willard, 1987Baitinger C. Willard M. Axonal transport of synapsin I-like proteins in rabbit retinal ganglion cells.J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3723-3735PubMed Google Scholar, Lund and McQuarrie, 2001Lund L.M. McQuarrie I.G.

Axonal transport kinetics and posttranslational modification of synapsin I in mouse retinal ganglion cells.J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2938-2946PubMed Google Scholar). The GFP fusions of these synaptic proteins have been characterized in previous studies (Gitler et al., 2004Gitler D. Xu Y. Kao H.T. Lin D. Lim S. Feng J. Greengard P. Augustine G.J. Molecular determinants of synapsin targeting to presynaptic terminals.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3711-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, Sturgill et al., 2009Sturgill J.F. Steiner P.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 12845-12854Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar; also see Figure S1, available online). Note that punctate particles are clearly visible both in axons expressing the fluorescent proteins and adjacent naive axons (Figure S1B) suggesting that the fusion proteins generally mimic the behaviors of their in situ counterparts. Figures 1A and 1B show typical results from photoactivation experiments (also see Movie S1. PA:GFP:Synapsin Transport, Movie S2. PAGFP:CamKIIa Transport, available online). The photoactivated axonal protein pool of synapsin and CamKIIa dispersed as a plume of fluorescence with a distinct anterograde bias, as shown in the representative kymographs (Figures 1A and 1B). This directional bias of fluorescence is unlikely to be a result of some nonspecific bulk axonal flow that moves all soluble proteins in its wake, as there was no bias in the axonal dispersion of untagged PAGFP, which showed bidirectional rapid diffusion as expected (Figure 1C; also see Movie S3. Untagged Soluble PAGFP Transport, Movie S5. Untagged Soluble PAGFP:GFP Kinetics). Also, the intensity-center analyses (see below) are not likely influenced by photobleaching as similar trends of intensity-center shifts were observed under imaging conditions that greatly minimized photobleaching (Figures S2A and S2B). The transport behavior of cytosolic proteins is also very different from the fast component amyloid precursor protein (APP), where discrete photoactivated vesicles rapidly escaped the activated zone over time (Figure 1D; also see Movie S4), in line with conventional stochastic motor-driven transport (Kaether et al., 2000Kaether C. Skehel P. Dotti C.G. Axonal membrane proteins are transported in distinct carriers: A two-color video microscopy study in cultured hippocampal neurons.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1213-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Similar results were also obtained with PAGFP:synaptophysin (data not shown). If the biased anterograde migration of the synapsin and CamKIIa population in our studies is the visual correlate of the slow axonal transport seen in pulse-chase radiolabeling studies, the overall vectorial bias of the fluorescence pool in our experiments should be similar to the overall rates of the radiolabeled population. To address this we quantified the bulk movement of the entire photoactivated pool by using intensity-center shift analysis (Figure 2A ). Briefly, the intensity center in a given frame is a quantitative center of the distribution of binned fluorescence intensities along a line scan within the photoactivated zone. A bulk vectorial movement of fluorescent molecules within the axon would lead to a corresponding shift in the intensity center as well. Anterograde shifts were consistently seen in the photoactivated pools of both synapsin and CamKIIa though there were differences in the overall kinetics as shown in Figure 2B. Specifically, for CamKIIa, there was a slight lag in the initiation of intensity-center shift as well as a periodic variation that was more pronounced than that for synapsin. Note that there is an expected flattening of the wave after the initial rise as the fluorescent molecules leave the analyzed area (photoactivated zone) over time. Despite these differences in the overall nature of the intensity-center shifts between synapsin and CamKIIa, there were similarities in their initial intensity shifts, suggesting possible commonalities between mechanisms transporting these cytosolic proteins—a notion supported by radiolabeling studies as well (Garner and Lasek, 1982Garner J.A. Lasek R.J. Cohesive axonal transport of the slow component b complex of polypeptides.J. Neurosci. 1982; 2: 1824-1835PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate this in more detail we focused on the initial intensity shift, imaging the activated zone with higher time compression. Indeed there was some similarity in the overall transport behaviors of both proteins (Figure 2B, lower panel). Linear regression slopes were 0.008 and 0.01 respectively, equivalent to predicted average rates of 0.008–0.01 μm/s for the entire population. These data are comparable to known slow rates of synapsin and CamKIIa from in vivo radiolabeling experiments, ≈0.01–0.03 μm/s (Baitinger and Willard, 1987Baitinger C. Willard M. Axonal transport of synapsin I-like proteins in rabbit retinal ganglion cells.J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3723-3735PubMed Google Scholar, Lund and McQuarrie, 2001Lund L.M. McQuarrie I.G.

Commun. 2001; 289: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, Petrucci et al., 1991Petrucci T.C. Macioce P. Paggi P. Axonal transport kinetics and posttranslational modification of synapsin I in mouse retinal ganglion cells.J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2938-2946PubMed Google Scholar), providing confidence in the validity of this assay in evaluating axonal transport of these cytosolic cargoes. Note that similar analysis of untagged soluble PAGFP diffusion does not show any bias in its mobility (Figure 2B, lower right panel). The anterogradely biased transit of synapsin and CamKIIa, distinct from the bidirectional unbiased movement of untagged soluble PAGFP in axons, suggests that the movement is not a simple diffusive process. We further tested this notion by analyzing synapsin and CamKIIa transport in the presence of micromolar amounts of the alkylating agent N-ethyl maleimide (NEM), a known inhibitor of kinesins, dyneins, and myosins (Pfister et al., 1989Pfister K.K. Wagner M.C. Bloom G.S. Brady S.T. Modification of the microtubule-binding and ATPase activities of kinesin by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) suggests a role for sulfhydryls in fast axonal transport.Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9006-9012Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Most recently, NEM was used to inhibit molecular motors to dissect their role in mobilizing vesicles at synapses (Shakiryanova et al., 2005Shakiryanova D. Tully A. Hewes R.S. Deitcher D.L. Levitan E.S. Activity-dependent liberation of synaptic neuropeptide vesicles.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and when perfused in squid axons, 1 μM NEM inhibits bidirectional vesicular transport within minutes (Pfister et al., 1989Pfister K.K. Wagner M.C. Bloom G.S. Brady S.T. Modification of the microtubule-binding and ATPase activities of kinesin by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) suggests a role for sulfhydryls in fast axonal transport.Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9006-9012Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This transport inhibition is due to the action of alkylating sulfhydryl groups on motors that profoundly alters their interactions with ATP and microtubules, stalling vesicle-motor complexes (Pfister et al., 1989Pfister K.K. Wagner M.C. Bloom G.S. Brady S.T. Modification of the microtubule-binding and ATPase activities of kinesin by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) suggests a role for sulfhydryls in fast axonal transport.Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9006-9012Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Without knowledge of the specific anterograde and retrograde motor(s) moving the assortment of cytosolic proteins, NEM provides a useful tool to examine the role of molecular motors in generating the intensity-center shift of synapsin and CamKIIa in our imaging experiments. Upon the addition of 0.5 μM NEM, axonal transport of APP vesicles was gradually perturbed and vesicular transport completely ceased at 20 min (Figure 3A ). Accordingly, for our experiments we visualized synapsin and CamKIIa transport after 10 min of NEM treatment. We found that such NEM treatment resulted in the accumulation of stationary puncta within axons with a dramatic inhibition of the anterogradely biased motion (Figure 3B). NEM treatment did not lead to any discernible changes in the diffusion kinetics of untagged PAGFP (Figures S2C and S2D). Addition of nocodazole, a microtubule-depolymerizing agent, also resulted in an inhibition of the anterograde bias (Figure 3C and Figure S3A) as did the cellular metabolic poison (oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler) 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP) (Figure S3B). Finally, coexpression of headless kinesins 1A, 1B, and 1C (also called Kif-5A, Kif-5B, and Kif-5C) known to act in a dominant negative fashion to inhibit kinesin-1 mediated transport (Kozielski et al., 1997Kozielski F. Sack S. Marx A. Thormählen M. Schönbrunn E. Biou V. Thompson A. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E.

Cell. 2009; 20: 4997-5006Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) also inhibited the anterograde bias of synapsin (Figure S3C), further suggesting that the bias is dependent on the activity of motors. The above experiments show that populations of synapsin and CamKIIa move along axons with a motor-dependent anterograde bias. This movement seems different from fast transport, where individual vesicles are stochastically transported by molecular motors. What is the underlying molecular basis for this unconventional motion of cytosolic protein populations? We reasoned that the overall biased transit of these proteins is ultimately mediated by the movement of particles that are transport competent. First, when neurons are stained for endogenous cytosolic synaptic proteins, particulate structures are seen within naive axons (Figure S1A, and also see Fletcher et al., 1991Fletcher T.L. Cameron P.

Delayed localization of synelfin (synuclein, NACP) to presynaptic terminals in cultured rat hippocampal neurons.Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 99: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), suggesting that these are the native structural form of cytosolic proteins within axons. Second, particulate structures are also clearly present within photoactivated zones in our experiments (note vertical lines in kymographs, Figure 1A and elsewhere). Third, when the anterograde bias of the photoactivated pool was inhibited with NEM or nocodazole, stalled particles are seen in axons (Figure 3B and Figure S3A). Furthermore, upon carefully examining kymographs, we could occasionally pick out diagonal tracks suggestive of vectorial particle motion (see kymographs in Figure 1, for example). However, our experiments designed to visualize bulk axonal transport of soluble proteins by maximally photoactivating synapsin and CamKIIa protein pools were not ideal for detecting the movement of individual particles. Accordingly, we photoactivated smaller protein pools, reasoning that stochastic incorporation of fluorescent molecules on synapsin and CamKIIa particles would allow us to see their movement, adopting methods from the speckle microscopy field (Dorn et al., 2008Dorn J.F. Danuser G. Yang G. Computational processing and analysis of dynamic fluorescence image data.Methods Cell Biol. 2008; 85: 497-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Indeed, such methods revealed numerous mobile particles within the photoactivated zone as shown in the kymograph examples in Figure S4. These movements were surprisingly intricate, consisting of rapid assembly and disassembly and vectorial spurts of the speckles. Manual analyses of a subset of vectorial tracks from the kymographs show that the average velocities of synapsin and CamKIIa speckles are comparable to known rates of kinesins and dyneins (1.981 ± 0.14 μm/s and 1.931 ± 0.13 μm/s, mean ± SEM for anterogradely moving synapsin and CamKIIa, respectively, n ≈60). Previous radiolabeling studies have shown that small fractions (≈15%) of somatically synthesized cytosolic synaptic proteins are conveyed in fast axonal transport (Baitinger and Willard, 1987Baitinger C. Willard M. Axonal transport of synapsin I-like proteins in rabbit retinal ganglion cells.J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3723-3735PubMed Google Scholar, Paggi and Petrucci, 1992Paggi P. Petrucci T.C.

Axonal transport kinetics and posttranslational modification of synapsin I in mouse retinal ganglion cells.J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2938-2946PubMed Google Scholar). These data have always been puzzling and the nature of this smaller, rapidly transported pool is poorly understood. To more closely simulate the radiolabeling paradigm, we photoactivated perikaryal PAGFP:synapsin and immediately thereafter imaged the emanating axon to track the migration of the photoactivated protein population from the soma into the axon (Figure 4A ; also see Movie S6). We reasoned that such experiments would photoactivate large protein pools and allow us to visualize both the slowly transported wave and the potential persistent particles as they emerged into an axon devoid of background fluorescence. Focusing on the proximal axonal region (Figure 4A, region of interest [ROI]-A) we saw a gradual migration of synapsin into the axon over time at rates closely resembling slow axonal transport (Figure 4Ai, representative of four such experiments), probably representing the slow transport of synapsin from the perikarya into axons. Next, after the slow-moving front had entered the axon, we imaged the advancing synapsin wave front within ROI-A at higher time compressions (Figure 4Aii). Surprisingly, we saw numerous particles emerge from the leading edge of the wave and move rapidly and persistently along the axon (Figure 4Aii). Such persistent, anterogradely moving particles were also readily visible when we imaged a more distal region of the same axon (Figure 4Aiii, kymograph from ROI-B). Note that the persistently mobile particles in the distal axon originated in the cell body as only the soma was photoactivated in these experiments. Imaging of the fast axonal transport protein APP by using a similar experimental strategy gave entirely different results, in which a deluge of photoactivated APP vesicles rapidly entered the axon a few seconds after perikarya photoactivation as expected (Figure S5; representative of four such experiments, also see Movie S7) and no slowly migrating wave was observed, as seen with synapsin. To determine if the persistent synapsin particles seen in the above experiments were associated with vesicular cargoes moving in fast axonal transport, we cotransfected neurons with GFP:synapsin-I (labeling all synapsin at steady state) and synaptophysin:monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP; transmembrane protein moving in fast transport) and simultaneously imaged both cargoes in thin distal axons by using dual-camera imaging (DC2 Dual-Cam system, Photometrics, Tucson, AZ). We found that a large fraction of persistent synapsin particles were colocalized with synaptophysin as shown in Figure 4B. Collectively the data show that while a large population of synapsin moves as a slowly migrating wave (likely with intricate particle kinetics), a subpopulation of somatically derived synapsin associates with vesicles conveying other fast synaptic proteins and moves persistently. These data help reconcile the seemingly conflicting observations by live imaging that synapsin particles clearly move rapidly as transport packets (Ahmari et al., 2000Ahmari S.E. Buchanan J. Smith S.J. Assembly of presynaptic active zones from cytoplasmic transport packets.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) and the fact that radiolabeling studies have established that the majority of synapsin is conveyed in slow axonal transport (Baitinger and Willard, 1987Baitinger C. Willard M. Axonal transport of synapsin I-like proteins in rabbit retinal ganglion cells.J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 3723-3735PubMed Google Scholar, Petrucci et al., 1991Petrucci T.C. Macioce P. Paggi P. Axonal transport kinetics and posttranslational modification of synapsin I in mouse retinal ganglion cells.J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 2938-2946PubMed Google Scholar). The data above support a model where the majority of the cytosolic protein population organizes into particles that undergo slow transport via intricate kinetics. Particles are invariably seen upon immunostaining of cytosolic proteins in neurons and (at least a fraction of them) probably represent the cargo structure moving in slow transport. What is the nature of these punctate structures and how are they being transported? One possibility is that they represent the association of synapsin and CamKIIa molecules with a proteinaceous particle or macromolecular complex that is transported by motors (Lasek et al., 1984Lasek R.J. Garner J.A. Brady S.T. Axonal transport of the cytoplasmic matrix.J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 212s-221sCrossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that these puncta represent the association of individual monomers with vesicles. Indeed, association of both synapsin and CamK with synaptic vesicles is well established (Takamori et al., 2006Takamori S. Holt M. Stenius K. Lemke E.A. Grønborg M. Riedel D. Urlaub H. Schenck S. Brügger B. Ringler P. et al.Molecular anatomy of a trafficking organelle.Cell. 2006; 127: 831-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar) and it is possible that they have transient vesicular associations in nonsynaptic compartments as well. To address the biochemical nature of synapsin and CamKII cargoes in mouse brains in vivo we first used classical assays to isolate synaptosomal-rich and synaptosomal-depleted fractions (P2 and S2 respectively, see strategy in Figure 5A ). We reasoned that the S2 fractions, largely free from the pre- and postsynaptic terminals (Dunkley et al., 2008Dunkley P.R. Jarvie P.E. Robinson P.J. A rapid Percoll gradient procedure for preparation of synaptosomes.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1718-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, Whittaker, 1993Whittaker V.P. Thirty years of synaptosome research.J. Neurocytol. 1993; 22: 735-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), would probably contain the putative cargo elements transporting these proteins and characterized the nature of synapsin and CamKIIa in these fractions. For these experiments, 4-week-old mouse brains were homogenized under conditions that aim to preserve native interactions and separated into various soluble (S) and pellet (P) fractions (see Experimental Procedures for further details). If the entire synapsin and CamKII population was completely soluble in nonsynaptic S2 fractions, one would expect that these proteins would exclusively migrate in the supernatant (S100) fractions. In line with that, we found that the small signaling molecule RhoGDI, previously used as a soluble marker in neurons (Kimura et al., 2005Kimura T. Watanabe H. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Tubulin and CRMP-2 complex is transported via Kinesin-1.J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), is predominantly enriched in the S100 fractions (Figure 5A, bottom). Though the axonal transport of signaling molecules has not been rigorously evaluated by radiolabeling, it is generally believed that their intracellular motion is largely diffusive (Brangwynne et al., 2008Brangwynne C.P. Koenderink G.H. MacKintosh F"
https://openalex.org/W2095317976,"Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of blindness amongst the elderly. Approximately 10% of AMD patients suffer from an advanced form of AMD characterized by choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Recent evidence implicates a significant role for complement in the pathogenesis of AMD. Activation of complement terminates in the incorporation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) in biological membranes and subsequent cell lysis. Elevated levels of MAC have been documented on choroidal blood vessels and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of AMD patients. CD59 is a naturally occurring membrane bound inhibitor of MAC formation. Previously we have shown that membrane bound human CD59 delivered to the RPE cells of mice via an adenovirus vector can protect those cells from human complement mediated lysis ex vivo. However, application of those observations to choroidal blood vessels are limited because protection from MAC- mediated lysis was restricted only to the cells originally transduced by the vector. Here we demonstrate that subretinal delivery of an adenovirus vector expressing a transgene for a soluble non-membrane binding form of human CD59 can attenuate the formation of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization and murine MAC formation in mice even when the region of vector delivery is distal to the site of laser induced CNV. Furthermore, this same recombinant transgene delivered to the intravitreal space of mice by an adeno-associated virus vector (AAV) can also attenuate laser-induced CNV. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a non-membrane targeting CD59 having biological potency in any animal model of disease in vivo. We propose that the above approaches warrant further exploration as potential approaches for alleviating complement mediated damage to ocular tissues in AMD."
https://openalex.org/W1997617373,"microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported as key regulators at post-transcriptional level in eukaryotic cells. In insects, most of the studies have focused in holometabolans while only recently two hemimetabolans (Locusta migratoria and Acyrthosiphon pisum) have had their miRNAs identified. Therefore, the study of the miRNAs of the evolutionarily basal hemimetabolan Blattella germanica may provide valuable insights on the structural and functional evolution of miRNAs.Small RNA libraries of the cockroach B. germanica were built from the whole body of the last instar nymph, and the adult ovaries. The high throughput Solexa sequencing resulted in approximately 11 and 8 million reads for the whole-body and ovaries, respectively. Bioinformatic analyses identified 38 known miRNAs as well as 11 known miRNA*s. We also found 70 miRNA candidates conserved in other insects and 170 candidates specific to B. germanica. The positive correlation between Solexa data and real-time quantitative PCR showed that number of reads can be used as a quantitative approach. Five novel miRNA precursors were identified and validated by PCR and sequencing. Known miRNAs and novel candidates were also validated by decreasing levels of their expression in dicer-1 RNAi knockdown individuals. The comparison of the two libraries indicates that whole-body nymph contain more known miRNAs than ovaries, whereas the adult ovaries are enriched with novel miRNA candidates.Our study has identified many known miRNAs and novel miRNA candidates in the basal hemimetabolan insect B. germanica, and most of the specific sequences were found in ovaries. Deep sequencing data reflect miRNA abundance and dicer-1 RNAi assay is shown to be a reliable method for validation of novel miRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2042866471,"Probe-based fluorescence melting curve analysis (FMCA) is a powerful tool for mutation detection based on melting temperature generated by thermal denaturation of the probe-target hybrid. Nevertheless, the color multiplexing, probe design, and cross-platform compatibility remain to be limited by using existing probe chemistries. We hereby explored two dual-labeled, self-quenched probes, TaqMan and shared-stem molecular beacons, in their ability to conduct FMCA. Both probes could be directly used for FMCA and readily integrated with closed-tube amplicon hybridization under asymmetric PCR conditions. Improved flexibility of FMCA by using these probes was illustrated in three representative applications of FMCA: mutation scanning, mutation identification and mutation genotyping, all of which achieved improved color-multiplexing with easy probe design and versatile probe combination and all were validated with a large number of real clinical samples. The universal cross-platform compatibility of these probes-based FMCA was also demonstrated by a 4-color mutation genotyping assay performed on five different real-time PCR instruments. The dual-labeled, self-quenched probes offered unprecedented combined advantage of enhanced multiplexing, improved flexibility in probe design, and expanded cross-platform compatibility, which would substantially improve FMCA in mutation detection of various applications."
https://openalex.org/W2077623699,"Cardiomyocyte apoptosis is an important remodeling event contributing to heart failure and adiponectin may mediate cardioprotective effects at least in part via attenuating apoptosis. Here we used hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells to examine the effect of adiponectin and cellular mechanisms of action. We first used TUNEL labeling in combination with laser scanning cytometry to demonstrate that adiponectin prevented H/R-induced DNA fragmentation. The anti-apoptotic effect of adiponectin was also verified via attenuation of H/R-induced phosphatidylserine exposure using annexin V binding. H/R-induced apoptosis via the mitochondrial-mediated intrinsic pathway of apoptosis as assessed by cytochrome c release into cytosol and caspase-3 activation, both of which were attenuated by adiponectin. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that adiponectin enhanced anti-oxidative potential in these cells which led to attenuation of the increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by H/R. To further address the mechanism of adiponctins anti-apoptotic effects we used siRNA to efficiently knockdown adiponectin receptor (AdipoR1) expression and found that this attenuated the protective effects of adiponectin on ROS production and caspase 3 activity. Knockdown of APPL1, an important intracellular binding partner for AdipoR, also significantly reduced the ability of adiponectin to prevent H/R-induced ROS generation and caspase 3 activity. In summary, H/R-induced ROS generation and activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway was prevented by adiponectin via AdipoR1/APPL1 signaling and increased anti-oxidant potential."
https://openalex.org/W2086195681,"One of the major causes of chemotherapy failure in cancer treatment is multidrug resistance (MDR) which is mediated by the ABCB1/P-glycoprotein. Previously, through the use of an extensive screening process, we found that vardenafil, a phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE-5) inhibitor significantly reverses MDR in ABCB1 overexpressing cancer cells, and its efficacy was greater than that of tadalafil, another PDE-5 inhibitor. The present study was designed to determine the reversal mechanisms of vardenafil and tadalafil on ABC transporters-mediated MDR. Vardenafil or tadalafil alone, at concentrations up to 20 µM, had no significant toxic effects on any of the cell lines used in this study, regardless of their membrane transporter status. However, vardenafil when used in combination with anticancer substrates of ABCB1, significantly potentiated their cytotoxicity in ABCB1 overexpressing cells in a concentration-dependent manner, and this effect was greater than that of tadalafil. The sensitivity of the parenteral cell lines to cytotoxic anticancer drugs was not significantly altered by vardenafil. The differential effects of vardenafil and tadalafil appear to be specific for the ABCB1 transporter as both vardenafil and tadalafil had no significant effect on the reversal of drug resistance conferred by ABCC1 (MRP1) and ABCG2 (BCRP) transporters. Vardenafil significantly increased the intracellular accumulation of [3H]-paclitaxel in the ABCB1 overexpressing KB-C2 cells. In addition, vardenafil significantly stimulated the ATPase activity of ABCB1 and inhibited the photolabeling of ABCB1 with [125I]-IAAP. Furthermore, Western blot analysis indicated the incubation of cells with either vardenafil or tadalafil for 72 h did not alter ABCB1 protein expression. Overall, our results suggest that vardenafil reverses ABCB1-mediated MDR by directly blocking the drug efflux function of ABCB1."
https://openalex.org/W2115049926,"The genetic diversity of photosynthetic picoeukaryotes was investigated in the South East Pacific Ocean. Genetic libraries of the plastid 16S rRNA gene were constructed on picoeukaryote populations sorted by flow cytometry, using two different primer sets, OXY107F/OXY1313R commonly used to amplify oxygenic organisms, and PLA491F/OXY1313R, biased towards plastids of marine algae. Surprisingly, the two sets revealed quite different photosynthetic picoeukaryote diversity patterns, which were moreover different from what we previously reported using the 18S rRNA nuclear gene as a marker. The first 16S primer set revealed many sequences related to Pelagophyceae and Dictyochophyceae, the second 16S primer set was heavily biased toward Prymnesiophyceae, while 18S sequences were dominated by Prasinophyceae, Chrysophyceae and Haptophyta. Primer mismatches with major algal lineages is probably one reason behind this discrepancy. However, other reasons, such as DNA accessibility or gene copy numbers, may be also critical. Based on plastid 16S rRNA gene sequences, the structure of photosynthetic picoeukaryotes varied along the BIOSOPE transect vertically and horizontally. In oligotrophic regions, Pelagophyceae, Chrysophyceae, and Prymnesiophyceae dominated. Pelagophyceae were prevalent at the DCM depth and Chrysophyceae at the surface. In mesotrophic regions Pelagophyceae were still important but Chlorophyta contribution increased. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a new clade of Prasinophyceae (clade 16S-IX), which seems to be restricted to hyper-oligotrophic stations. Our data suggest that a single gene marker, even as widely used as 18S rRNA, provides a biased view of eukaryotic communities and that the use of several markers is necessary to obtain a complete image."
https://openalex.org/W2103848011,"Background Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a novel candidate for use in cardiac stem cell therapy. However, their intrinsic tumorigenicity requires further investigation prior to use in a clinical setting. In this study we investigated whether undifferentiated iPSCs are tumorigenic after intramyocardial transplantation into immunocompetent allogeneic recipients. Methodology/Principal Findings We transplanted 2×104, 2×105, or 2×106 cells from the established rat iPSC line M13 intramyocardially into intact or infarcted hearts of immunocompetent allogeneic rats. Transplant duration was 2, 4, or 6 weeks. Histological examination with hematoxylin-eosin staining confirmed that undifferentiated rat iPSCs could generate heterogeneous tumors in both intracardiac and extracardiac sites. Furthermore, tumor incidence was independent of cell dose, transplant duration, and the presence or absence of myocardial infarction. Conclusions/Significance Our study demonstrates that allogeneic iPSC transplantation in the heart will likely result in in situ tumorigenesis, and that cells leaked from the beating heart are a potential source of tumor spread, underscoring the importance of evaluating the safety of future iPSC therapy for cardiac disease."
https://openalex.org/W2052749450,"Many HIV-infected children in sub-Saharan Africa reside in rural areas, yet most research on treatment outcomes has been conducted in urban centers. Rural clinics and residents may face unique barriers to care and treatment.A prospective cohort study of HIV-infected children was conducted between September 2007 and September 2010 at the rural HIV clinic in Macha, Zambia. HIV-infected children younger than 16 years of age at study enrollment who received antiretroviral therapy (ART) during the study were eligible. Treatment outcomes during the first two years of ART, including mortality, immunologic status, and virologic suppression, were assessed and risk factors for mortality and virologic suppression were evaluated.A total of 69 children entered the study receiving ART and 198 initiated ART after study enrollment. The cumulative probabilities of death among children starting ART after study enrollment were 9.0% and 14.4% at 6 and 24 months after ART initiation. Younger age, higher viral load, lower CD4+ T-cell percentage and lower weight-for-age z-scores at ART initiation were associated with higher risk of mortality. The mean CD4(+) T-cell percentage increased from 16.3% at treatment initiation to 29.3% and 35.0% at 6 and 24 months. The proportion of children with undetectable viral load increased to 88.5% and 77.8% at 6 and 24 months. Children with longer travel times (≥ 5 hours) and those taking nevirapine at ART initiation, as well as children who were non-adherent, were less likely to achieve virologic suppression after 6 months of ART.HIV-infected children receiving treatment in a rural clinic experienced sustained immunologic and virologic improvements. Children with longer travel times were less likely to achieve virologic suppression, supporting the need for decentralized models of ART delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2004599342,"Background Oysters play important roles in estuarine ecosystems but have suffered recently due to overfishing, pollution, and habitat loss. A tradeoff between growth rate and disease prevalence as a function of salinity makes the estuarine salinity transition of special concern for oyster survival and restoration. Estuarine salinity varies with discharge, so increases or decreases in precipitation with climate change may shift regions of low salinity and disease refuge away from optimal oyster bottom habitat, negatively impacting reproduction and survival. Temperature is an additional factor for oyster survival, and recent temperature increases have increased vulnerability to disease in higher salinity regions. Methodology/Principal Findings We examined growth, reproduction, and survival of oysters in the New York Harbor-Hudson River region, focusing on a low-salinity refuge in the estuary. Observations were during two years when rainfall was above average and comparable to projected future increases in precipitation in the region and a past period of about 15 years with high precipitation. We found a clear tradeoff between oyster growth and vulnerability to disease. Oysters survived well when exposed to intermediate salinities during two summers (2008, 2010) with moderate discharge conditions. However, increased precipitation and discharge in 2009 reduced salinities in the region with suitable benthic habitat, greatly increasing oyster mortality. To evaluate the estuarine conditions over longer periods, we applied a numerical model of the Hudson to simulate salinities over the past century. Model results suggest that much of the region with suitable benthic habitat that historically had been a low salinity refuge region may be vulnerable to higher mortality under projected increases in precipitation and discharge. Conclusions/Significance Predicted increases in precipitation in the northeastern United States due to climate change may lower salinities past important thresholds for oyster survival in estuarine regions with appropriate substrate, potentially disrupting metapopulation dynamics and impeding oyster restoration efforts, especially in the Hudson estuary where a large basin constitutes an excellent refuge from disease."
https://openalex.org/W2044335415,"In spite that chemoreception is important in sexual selection for many animals, such as reptiles, the mechanisms that confer reliability to chemical signals are relatively unknown. European green lizards (Lacerta viridis) have substantial amounts of α-tocopherol ( = vitamin E) in their femoral secretions. Because vitamin E is metabolically important and can only be attained from the diet, its secretion is assumed to be costly. However, its role in intraspecific communication is unknown.Here, we experimentally show that male European green lizards that received a dietary supplement of vitamin E increased proportions of vitamin E in their femoral secretions. Furthermore, our experiments revealed that females preferred to use areas scent marked by males with experimentally increased vitamin E levels in their secretions. Finally, female preferences were stronger when vitamin E differences between a pair of males' secretions were larger.Our results demonstrate that female green lizards are able to discriminate between males based on the vitamin E content of the males' femoral secretions. We suggest that the possible cost of allocating vitamin E to secretions, which might be dependent on male quality, may be a mechanism that confers reliability to scent marks of green lizards and allows their evolution as sexual signals."
https://openalex.org/W2027677218,"Background The eye lens is composed of fiber cells that are filled with α-, β- and γ-crystallins. The primary function of crystallins is to maintain the clarity of the lens through ordered interactions as well as through the chaperone-like function of α-crystallin. With aging, the chaperone function of α-crystallin decreases, with the concomitant accumulation of water-insoluble, light-scattering oligomers and crystallin-derived peptides. The role of crystallin-derived peptides in age-related lens protein aggregation and insolubilization is not understood. Methodology/Principal Findings We found that αA-crystallin-derived peptide, 66SDRDKFVIFLDVKHF80, which accumulates in the aging lens, can inhibit the chaperone activity of α-crystallin and cause aggregation and precipitation of lens crystallins. Age-related change in the concentration of αA-(66-80) peptide was estimated by mass spectrometry. The interaction of the peptide with native crystallin was studied by multi-angle light scattering and fluorescence methods. High molar ratios of peptide-to-crystallin were favourable for aggregation and precipitation. Time-lapse recordings showed that, in the presence of αA-(66-80) peptide, α-crystallin aggregates and functions as a nucleus for protein aggregation, attracting aggregation of additional α-, β- and γ-crystallins. Additionally, the αA-(66-80) peptide shares the principal properties of amyloid peptides, such as β-sheet structure and fibril formation. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that crystallin-derived peptides such as αA-(66-80), generated in vivo, can induce age-related lens changes by disrupting the structure and organization of crystallins, leading to their insolubilization. The accumulation of such peptides in aging lenses may explain a novel mechanism for age-related crystallin aggregation and cataractogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1983196544,"Background In malaria endemic areas, most people are simultaneously infected with different parasite clones. Detection of individual clones is hampered when their densities fluctuate around the detection limit and, in case of P. falciparum, by sequestration during part of their life cycle. This has important implications for measures of levels of infection or for the outcome of clinical trials. This study aimed at measuring the detectability of individual P. falciparum and P. vivax parasite clones in consecutive samples of the same patient and at investigating the impact of sampling strategies on basic epidemiological measures such as multiplicity of infection (MOI). Methods Samples were obtained in a repeated cross-sectional field survey in 1 to 4.5 years old children from Papua New Guinea, who were followed up in 2-monthly intervals over 16 months. At each follow-up visit, two consecutive blood samples were collected from each child at intervals of 24 hours. Samples were genotyped for the polymorphic markers msp2 for P. falciparum and msp1F3 and MS16 for P. vivax. Observed prevalence and mean MOI estimated from single samples per host were compared to combined data from sampling twice within 24 h. Findings and Conclusion Estimated detectability was high in our data set (0.79 [95% CI 0.76–0.82] for P. falciparum and, depending on the marker, 0.61 [0.58–0.63] or 0.73 [0.71–0.75] for P. vivax). When genotyping data from sequential samples, collected 24 hours apart, were combined, the increase in measured prevalence was moderate, 6 to 9% of all infections were missed on a single day. The effect on observed MOI was more pronounced, 18 to 31% of all individual clones were not detected in a single bleed. Repeated sampling revealed little difference between detectability of P. falciparum and P. vivax."
https://openalex.org/W2076318919,"Background Mutations in the cellular prion protein associated to familial prion disorders severely increase the likelihood of its misfolding into pathogenic conformers. Despite their postulation as incompatible elements with the native fold, these mutations rarely modify the native state structure. However they variably have impact on the thermodynamic stability and metabolism of PrPC and on the properties of PrPSc aggregates. To investigate whether the pathogenic mutations affect the dynamic properties of the HuPrP(125-229) α-fold and find possible common patterns of effects that could help in prophylaxis we performed a dynamic diagnosis of ten point substitutions. Methodology/Principal Findings Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and novel analytical tools we have explored the effect of D178N, V180I, T183A, T188K, E196K, F198S, E200K, R208H, V210I and E211Q mutations on the dynamics of HuPrP(125-228) α-fold. We have found that while preserving the native state, all mutations produce dynamic changes which perturb the coordination of the α2-α3 hairpin to the rest of the molecule and cause the reorganization of the patches for intermolecular recognition, as the disappearance of those for conversion inhibitors and the emergence of an interaction site at the β2-α2 loop region. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that pathogenic mutations share a common pattern of dynamical alterations that converge to the conversion of the β2-α2 loop into an interacting region that can be used as target for interference treatments in genetic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2087763371,"Linear trend analysis of time series is standard procedure in many scientific disciplines. If the number of data is large, a trend may be statistically significant even if data are scattered far from the trend line. This study introduces and tests a quality criterion for time trends referred to as statistical meaningfulness, which is a stricter quality criterion for trends than high statistical significance. The time series is divided into intervals and interval mean values are calculated. Thereafter, r(2) and p values are calculated from regressions concerning time and interval mean values. If r(2) ≥ 0.65 at p ≤ 0.05 in any of these regressions, then the trend is regarded as statistically meaningful. Out of ten investigated time series from different scientific disciplines, five displayed statistically meaningful trends. A Microsoft Excel application (add-in) was developed which can perform statistical meaningfulness tests and which may increase the operationality of the test. The presented method for distinguishing statistically meaningful trends should be reasonably uncomplicated for researchers with basic statistics skills and may thus be useful for determining which trends are worth analysing further, for instance with respect to causal factors. The method can also be used for determining which segments of a time trend may be particularly worthwhile to focus on."
https://openalex.org/W2085538774,"Activating mutations of FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) are found in approximately 30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). FLT3 is therefore an attractive drug target. However, the molecular mechanisms by which FLT3 mutations lead to cell transformation in AML remain unclear. To develop a better understanding of FLT3 signaling as well as its downstream effectors, we performed detailed phosphoproteomic analysis of FLT3 signaling in human leukemia cells. We identified over 1000 tyrosine phosphorylation sites from about 750 proteins in both AML (wild type and mutant FLT3) and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (normal and amplification of FLT3) cell lines. Furthermore, using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), we were able to quantified over 400 phosphorylation sites (pTyr, pSer, and pThr) that were responsive to FLT3 inhibition in FLT3 driven human leukemia cell lines. We also extended this phosphoproteomic analysis on bone marrow from primary AML patient samples, and identify over 200 tyrosine and 800 serine/threonine phosphorylation sites in vivo. This study showed that oncogenic FLT3 regulates proteins involving diverse cellular processes and affects multiple signaling pathways in human leukemia that we previously appreciated, such as Fc epsilon RI-mediated signaling, BCR, and CD40 signaling pathways. It provides a valuable resource for investigation of oncogenic FLT3 signaling in human leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W2000563102,"The life stages of Leishmania spp. include the infectious promastigote and the replicative intracellular amastigote. Each stage is phagocytosed by macrophages during the parasite life cycle. We previously showed that caveolae, a subset of cholesterol-rich membrane lipid rafts, facilitate uptake and intracellular survival of virulent promastigotes by macrophages, at least in part, by delaying parasitophorous vacuole (PV)-lysosome fusion. We hypothesized that amastigotes and promastigotes would differ in their route of macrophage entry and mechanism of PV maturation. Indeed, transient disruption of macrophage lipid rafts decreased the entry of promastigotes, but not amastigotes, into macrophages (P<0.001). Promastigote-containing PVs were positive for caveolin-1, and co-localized transiently with EEA-1 and Rab5 at 5 minutes. Amastigote-generated PVs lacked caveolin-1 but retained Rab5 and EEA-1 for at least 30 minutes or 2 hours, respectively. Coinciding with their conversion into amastigotes, the number of promastigote PVs positive for LAMP-1 increased from 20% at 1 hour, to 46% by 24 hours, (P<0.001, Chi square). In contrast, more than 80% of amastigote-initiated PVs were LAMP-1+ at both 1 and 24 hours. Furthermore, lipid raft disruption increased LAMP-1 recruitment to promastigote, but not to amastigote-containing compartments. Overall, our data showed that promastigotes enter macrophages through cholesterol-rich domains like caveolae to delay fusion with lysosomes. In contrast, amastigotes enter through a non-caveolae pathway, and their PVs rapidly fuse with late endosomes but prolong their association with early endosome markers. These results suggest a model in which promastigotes and amastigotes use different mechanisms to enter macrophages, modulate the kinetics of phagosome maturation, and facilitate their intracellular survival."
https://openalex.org/W2003992760,"Given the central importance of protected area systems in local, regional and global conservation strategies, it is vital that there is a good understanding of their effectiveness in maintaining ecological functioning. Here, we provide, to our knowledge, the first such global analysis, focusing on plant production, a ""supporting"" ecosystem function necessary for multiple other ecosystem services. We use data on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a measure of variation in plant production in the core, boundary and surroundings of more than 1000 large protected areas over a 25 year period. Forested protected areas were higher (or similar), and those non-forested were lower (or similar), in NDVI than their surrounding areas, and these differences have been sustained. The differences from surrounding areas have increased for evergreen broadleaf forests and barren grounds, decreased for grasslands, and remained similar for deciduous forests, woodlands, and shrublands, reflecting different pressures on those surroundings. These results are consistent with protected areas being effective both in the representation and maintenance of plant production. However, widespread overall increases in NDVI during the study period suggest that plant production within the core of non-forested protected areas has become higher than it was in the surroundings of those areas in 1982, highlighting that whilst the distinctiveness of protected areas from their surroundings has persisted the nature of that difference has changed."
https://openalex.org/W2054584316,"In the developing Xenopus tadpole, conditioning with 20 min of visual stimulation leads to increased proBDNF protein levels in the tectum measured 4 hr later. Following conditioning, the ability to induce direction selectivity in tectal neurons, as well as both retinotectal long-term potentiation and depression, thought to underlie this phenomenon, was strongly facilitated. This facilitation was blocked by knockdown of BDNF expression in tectal neurons. Animals that had been exposed to visual conditioning and subsequently received normal visual input for 7–11 hr exhibited higher spatial frequency thresholds of tectal cell responses to counterphasing gratings than nonconditioned control animals. An improvement in visual acuity was confirmed by enhanced sensitivity to counterphasing gratings in a behavioral test. These results indicate that brief sensory stimulation, by initiating nuclear transcription and de novo protein synthesis of BDNF, can facilitate the refinement of response properties in the developing visual system."
https://openalex.org/W1983298307,"Studies relating physical activity (PA) to weight gain in children have produced mixed results, although there is some evidence for stronger associations with more intense physical activities. The present study tested the hypothesis that weight gain over one year in 8-10 year olds would be more strongly predicted by moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA) than total physical activity (total PA) or sedentary behaviour.Participants were 280 children taking part in the Physical Exercise and Appetite in Children Study (PEACHES). Weight status was assessed using body mass index (BMI), fat mass index (FMI), and waist circumference (WC) in school Year 4 (baseline; age 8.7 yrs) and Year 5 (follow-up; age 9.7 yrs). Physical activity was measured at baseline using the Actigraph GT1M accelerometer to assess total PA (mean accelerometers counts per minute), MVPA; ≥ 4000 counts per minute) and sedentary time (<100 counts per minute).After adjustment for baseline BMI, SES, sex and ethnicity, MVPA was significantly associated with follow-up BMI (adjusted β = -0.07; p = 0.002). This association was independent of total PA or sedentary time. Similar results were observed for FMI; again MVPA was significantly associated with follow up FMI (β = -0.16; p = 0.001) independent of total PA or sedentary time. The pattern was similar for WC (β = -0.07), but the association between MVPA and WC did not reach significance at p = 0.06.The results of this study strongly support promotion of MVPA in children."
https://openalex.org/W1986504117,"Rnd proteins are a subfamily of Rho GTPases involved in the control of actin cytoskeleton dynamics and other cell functions such as motility, proliferation and survival. Unlike other members of the Rho family, Rnd proteins lack GTPase activity and therefore remain constitutively active. We have recently described that RhoE/Rnd3 is expressed in the Central Nervous System and that it has a role in promoting neurite formation. Despite their possible relevance during development, the role of Rnd proteins in vivo is not known. To get insight into the in vivo function of RhoE we have generated mice lacking RhoE expression by an exon trapping cassette. RhoE null mice (RhoE gt/gt) are smaller at birth, display growth retardation and early postnatal death since only half of RhoE gt/gt mice survive beyond postnatal day (PD) 15 and 100% are dead by PD 29. RhoE gt/gt mice show an abnormal body position with profound motor impairment and impaired performance in most neurobehavioral tests. Null mutant mice are hypoactive, show an immature locomotor pattern and display a significant delay in the appearance of the hindlimb mature responses. Moreover, they perform worse than the control littermates in the wire suspension, vertical climbing and clinging, righting reflex and negative geotaxis tests. Also, RhoE ablation results in a delay of neuromuscular maturation and in a reduction in the number of spinal motor neurons. Finally, RhoE gt/gt mice lack the common peroneal nerve and, consequently, show a complete atrophy of the target muscles. This is the first model to study the in vivo functions of a member of the Rnd subfamily of proteins, revealing the important role of Rnd3/RhoE in the normal development and suggesting the possible involvement of this protein in neurological disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2076997838,"Background Genetic analysis in the mouse revealed that GREMLIN1 (GREM1)-mediated antagonism of BMP4 is essential for ureteric epithelial branching as the disruption of ureteric bud outgrowth and renal agenesis in Grem1-deficient embryos is restored by additional inactivation of one Bmp4 allele. Another BMP ligand, BMP7, was shown to control the proliferative expansion of nephrogenic progenitors and its requirement for nephrogenesis can be genetically substituted by Bmp4. Therefore, we investigated whether BMP7 in turn also participates in inhibiting ureteric bud outgrowth during the initiation of metanephric kidney development. Methodology/Principal Findings Genetic inactivation of one Bmp7 allele in Grem1-deficient mouse embryos does not alleviate the bilateral renal agenesis, while complete inactivation of Bmp7 restores ureteric bud outgrowth and branching. In mouse embryos lacking both Grem1 and Bmp7, GDNF/WNT11 feedback signaling and the expression of the Etv4 target gene, which regulates formation of the invading ureteric bud tip, are restored. In contrast to the restoration of ureteric bud outgrowth and branching, nephrogenesis remains aberrant as revealed by the premature loss of Six2 expressing nephrogenic progenitor cells. Therefore, very few nephrons develop in kidneys lacking both Grem1 and Bmp7 and the resulting dysplastic phenotype is indistinguishable from the one of Bmp7-deficient mouse embryos. Conclusions/Significance Our study reveals an unexpected inhibitory role of BMP7 during the onset of ureteric bud outgrowth. As BMP4, BMP7 and GREM1 are expressed in distinct mesenchymal and epithelial domains, the localized antagonistic interactions of GREM1 with BMPs could restrict and guide ureteric bud outgrowth and branching. The robustness and likely significant redundancy of the underlying signaling system is evidenced by the fact that global reduction of Bmp4 or inactivation of Bmp7 are both able to restore ureteric bud outgrowth and epithelial branching in Grem1-deficient mouse embryos."

Staphylococcal superantigen-like protein 5 (SSL5) has recently been shown to bind to platelet glycoproteins and induce platelet activation. This study investigates further the interaction between SSL5 and platelet glycoproteins. Moreover, using a glycan discovery approach, we aim to identify potential glycans to therapeutically target this interaction and prevent SSL5-induced effects.In addition to platelet activation experiments, flow cytometry, immunoprecipitation, surface plasmon resonance and a glycan binding array, were used to identify specific SSL5 binding regions and mediators. We independently confirm SSL5 to interact with platelets via GPIbα and identify the sulphated-tyrosine residues as an important region for SSL5 binding. We also identify the novel direct interaction between SSL5 and the platelet collagen receptor GPVI. Together, these receptors offer one mechanistic explanation for the unique functional influences SSL5 exerts on platelets. A role for specific families of platelet glycans in mediating SSL5-platelet interactions was also discovered and used to identify and demonstrate effectiveness of potential glycan based inhibitors in vitro.These findings further elucidate the functional interactions between SSL5 and platelets, including the novel finding of a role for the GPVI receptor. We demonstrate efficacy of possible glycan-based approaches to inhibit the SSL5-induced platelet activation. Our data warrant further work to prove SSL5-platelet effects in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1964040902,"T cells often make sequential contacts with multiple DCs in the lymph nodes and are likely to be equipped with mechanisms that allow them to sum up the successive signals received. We found that a period of stimulation as short as two hours could imprint on a T cell a ""biochemical memory"" of that activation signal that persisted for several hours. This was evidenced by more rapid induction of activation markers and earlier commitment to proliferation upon subsequent stimulation, even when that secondary stimulation occurred hours later. Upregulation of the immediate early gene product c-fos, a component of the AP-1 transcription factor, was maximal by 1-2 hours of stimulation, and protein levels remained elevated for several hours after stimulus withdrawal. Moreover, phosphorylated forms of c-fos that are stable and transcriptionally active persisted for a least a day. Upon brief antigenic stimulation in vivo, we also observed a rapid upregulation of c-fos that could be boosted by subsequent stimulation. Accumulation of phosphorylated c-fos may therefore serve as a biochemical fingerprint of previous suboptimal stimulation, leaving the T cell poised to rapidly resume its activation program upon its next encounter with an antigen-bearing DC."
https://openalex.org/W2011998854,"Background Exposure to intense sound or high doses of aminoglycoside antibiotics can increase hearing thresholds, induce cochlear dysfunction, disrupt hair cell morphology and promote hair cell death, leading to permanent hearing loss. When the two insults are combined, synergistic ototoxicity occurs, exacerbating cochlear vulnerability to sound exposure. The underlying mechanism of this synergism remains unknown. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that sound exposure enhances the intra-cochlear trafficking of aminoglycosides, such as gentamicin, leading to increased hair cell uptake of aminoglycosides and subsequent ototoxicity. Methods Juvenile C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to moderate or intense sound levels, while fluorescently-conjugated or native gentamicin was administered concurrently or following sound exposure. Drug uptake was then examined in cochlear tissues by confocal microscopy. Results Prolonged sound exposure that induced temporary threshold shifts increased gentamicin uptake by cochlear hair cells, and increased gentamicin permeation across the strial blood-labyrinth barrier. Enhanced intra-cochlear trafficking and hair cell uptake of gentamicin also occurred when prolonged sound, and subsequent aminoglycoside exposure were temporally separated, confirming previous observations. Acute, concurrent sound exposure did not increase cochlear uptake of aminoglycosides. Conclusions Prolonged, moderate sound exposures enhanced intra-cochlear aminoglycoside trafficking into the stria vascularis and hair cells. Changes in strial and/or hair cell physiology and integrity due to acoustic overstimulation could increase hair cell uptake of gentamicin, and may represent one mechanism of synergistic ototoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1985575781,"Although impaired decoding of emotional prosody has frequently been associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), to date only few reports have sought to explore the effect of Parkinson's treatment on disturbances of prosody decoding. In particular, little is known about how surgical treatment approaches such as high frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) affect emotional speech perception in patients with PD. Accordingly, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation on prosody processing.To this end the performance of 13 PD patients on three tasks requiring the decoding of emotional speech was assessed and subsequently compared to the performance of healthy control individuals. To delineate the effect of STN-DBS, all patients were tested with stimulators turned on as well as with stimulators turned off. Results revealed that irrespective of whether assessments were made ""on"" or ""off"" stimulation, patients' performance was less accurate as compared to healthy control participants on all tasks employed in this study. However, while accuracy appeared to be unaffected by stimulator status, a facilitation of reactions specific to highly conflicting emotional stimulus material (i.e. stimulus material presenting contradicting emotional messages on a verbal and non-verbal prosodic level) was observed during ""on"" stimulation assessments.In sum, presented results suggest that the processing of emotional speech is indeed modulated by STN-DBS. Observed alterations might, on the one hand, reflect a more efficient processing of highly conflicting stimulus material following DBS. However, on the other hand, given the lack of an improvement in accuracy, increased impulsivity associated with STN stimulation needs to be taken into consideration."
https://openalex.org/W1996825174,"The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele has been reported to be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Previous neuropathological studies have demonstrated similar frequencies of the APOE ε4 allele in AD and DLB. However, the few ante-mortem studies on APOE allele frequencies in DLB have shown lower frequencies than post-mortem studies. One reason for this may be inaccuracy of diagnosis. We examined APOE genotypes in subjects with AD, DLB, and a control group using the latest diagnostic criteria and MRI, SPECT, and MIBG myocardial scintigraphy.The subjects of this study consisted of 145 patients with probable AD, 50 subjects with probable DLB, and a control group. AD subjects were divided into two groups based on age of onset: early onset AD (EOAD) and late onset AD (LOAD). All subjects had characteristic features on MRI, SPECT, and/or myocardial scintigraphy.The rate of APOE4 carrier status was 18.3% and the frequency of the ε4 allele was 9.7% in controls. The rate of APOE4 carrier status and the frequency of the ε4 allele were 47% and 27% for LOAD, 50% and 31% for EOAD, and 42% and 31% for DLB, respectively.The APOE4 genotypes in this study are consistent with previous neuropathological studies suggesting accurate diagnosis of AD and DLB. APOE4 genotypes were similar in AD and DLB, giving further evidence that the ε4 allele is a risk factor for both disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2048091386,"Depressive episodes are frequently preceded by stressful life events. Evidence from genetic association studies suggests a role for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), an essential element in the regulation of stress responses, in the pathophysiology of the disorder. Since the stress response system is affected by pregnancy and postpartum-associated changes, it has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of postpartum depression. Using a 2 × 2 factorial design, we investigated whether a heterozygous deletion of GR would influence maternal care behavior in C57BL/6 and Balb/c mice, two inbred strains known to display qualitative differences in this behavior. Behavioral observation was carried out between postnatal days 1 and 7, followed by a pup retrieval test on postnatal days 7 or 8. While previously noted inter-strain differences were confirmed for different manifestations of caring behavior, self-maintenance and neglecting behaviors as well as the pup retrieval test, no strain-independent effect of the GR mutation was noted. However, an interaction between GR genotype and licking/grooming behavior was observed: it was down-regulated in heterozygous C57BL/6 mice to the level recorded for Balb/c mice. Home cage observation poses minimal disturbance of the dam and her litter as compared to more invasive assessments of dams' emotional behavior. This might be a reason for the absence of any overall effects of the GR mutation, particularly since GR heterozygous animals display a depressive-like phenotype under stressful conditions only. Still, the subtle effect we observed may point towards a role of GR in postpartum affective disorders."

The DRN receives a direct input from the retina. However little is known regarding the type of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) that innervates the DRN. We examined morphological characteristics and physiological properties of these DRN projecting ganglion cells.The Mongolian gerbils are highly visual rodents with a diurnal/crepuscular activity rhythm. It has been widely used as experimental animals of various studies including seasonal affective disorders and depression. Young adult gerbils were used in the present study. DRN-projecting RGCs were identified following retrograde tracer injection into the DRN, characterized physiologically by extracellular recording and morphologically after intracellular filling. The result shows that DRN-projecting RGCs exhibit morphological characteristics typical of alpha RGCs and physiological response properties of Y-cells. Melanopsin was not detected in these RGCs and they show no evidence of intrinsic photosensitivity.These findings suggest that RGCs with alpha-like morphology and Y-like physiology appear to perform a non-imaging forming function and thus may participate in the modulation of DRN activity which includes regulation of sleep and mood."
https://openalex.org/W2015227322,"The fur of common rabbits is constituted of 3 types of hair differing in length and diameter while that of rex animals is essentially made up of amazingly soft down-hair. Rex short hair coat phenotypes in rabbits were shown to be controlled by three distinct loci. We focused on the “r1” mutation which segregates at a simple autosomal-recessive locus in our rabbit strains. A positional candidate gene approach was used to identify the rex gene and the corresponding mutation. The gene was primo-localized within a 40 cM region on rabbit chromosome 14 by genome scanning families of 187 rabbits in an experimental mating scheme. Then, fine mapping refined the region to 0.5 cM (Z = 78) by genotyping an additional 359 offspring for 94 microsatellites present or newly generated within the first defined interval. Comparative mapping pointed out a candidate gene in this 700 kb region, namely LIPH (Lipase Member H). In humans, several mutations in this major gene cause alopecia, hair loss phenotypes. The rabbit gene structure was established and a deletion of a single nucleotide was found in LIPH exon 9 of rex rabbits (1362delA). This mutation results in a frameshift and introduces a premature stop codon potentially shortening the protein by 19 amino acids. The association between this deletion and the rex phenotype was complete, as determined by its presence in our rabbit families and among a panel of 60 rex and its absence in all 60 non-rex rabbits. This strongly suggests that this deletion, in a homozygous state, is responsible for the rex phenotype in rabbits."
https://openalex.org/W2048315186,"Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is a water channel expressed at the sarcolemma of fast-twitch skeletal muscle fibers, whose expression is altered in several forms of muscular dystrophies. However, little is known concerning the physiological role of AQP4 in skeletal muscle and its functional and structural interaction with skeletal muscle proteome. Using AQP4-null mice, we analyzed the effect of the absence of AQP4 on the morphology and protein composition of sarcolemma as well as on the whole skeletal muscle proteome. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that the absence of AQP4 did not perturb the expression and cellular localization of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex proteins, aside from those belonging to the extracellular matrix, and no alteration was found in sarcolemma integrity by dye extravasation assay. With the use of a 2DE-approach (BN/SDS-PAGE), protein maps revealed that in quadriceps, out of 300 Coomassie-blue detected and matched spots, 19 proteins exhibited changed expression in AQP4−/− compared to WT mice. In particular, comparison of the protein profiles revealed 12 up- and 7 down-regulated protein spots in AQP4−/− muscle. Protein identification by MS revealed that the perturbed expression pattern belongs to proteins involved in energy metabolism (i.e. GAPDH, creatine kinase), as well as in Ca2+ handling (i.e. parvalbumin, SERCA1). Western blot analysis, performed on some significantly changed proteins, validated the 2D results. Together these findings suggest AQP4 as a novel determinant in the regulation of skeletal muscle metabolism and better define the role of this water channel in skeletal muscle physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2094462211,"Alternative splicing creates several Na(v)1.5 transcripts in the mammalian myocardium and in various other tissues including brain, dorsal root ganglia, breast cancer cells as well as neuronal stem cell lines. In total nine Na(v)1.5 splice variants have been discovered. Four of them, namely Na(v)1.5a, Na(v)1.5c, Na(v)1.5d, and Na(v)1.5e, generate functional channels in heterologous expression systems. The significance of alternatively spliced transcripts for cardiac excitation, in particular their role in SCN5A channelopathies, is less well understood. In the present study, we systematically investigated electrophysiological properties of mutant T1620K channels in the background of all known functional Na(v)1.5 splice variants in HEK293 cells. This mutation has been previously associated with two distinct cardiac excitation disorders: with long QT syndrome type 3 (LQT3) and isolated cardiac conduction disease (CCD). When investigating the effect of the T1620K mutation, we noticed similar channel defects in the background of hNa(v)1.5, hNa(v)1.5a, and hNa(v)1.5c. In contrast, the hNa(v)1.5d background produced differential effects: In the mutant channel, some gain-of-function features did not emerge, whereas loss-of-function became more pronounced. In case of hNa(v)1.5e, the neonatal variant of hNa(v)1.5, both the splice variant itself as well as the corresponding mutant channel showed electrophysiological properties that were distinct from the wild-type and mutant reference channels, hNa(v)1.5 and T1620K, respectively. In conclusion, our data show that alternative splicing is a mechanism capable of generating a variety of functionally distinct wild-type and mutant hNa(v)1.5 channels. Thus, the cellular splicing machinery is a potential player affecting genotype-phenotype correlations in SCN5A channelopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2007414375,"Dendritic cells (DC) are able to elicit anti-tumoral CD8+ T cell responses by cross-presenting exogenous antigens in association with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Therefore they are crucial actors in cell-based cancer immunotherapy. Although apoptotic cells are usually considered to be the best source of antigens, live cells are also able to provide antigens for cross-presentation by DC. We have recently shown that prophylactic immunotherapy by DC after capture of antigens from live B16 melanoma cells induced strong CD8+ T-cell responses and protection against a lethal tumor challenge in vivo in C57Bl/6 mice. Here, we showed that DC cross-presenting antigens from live B16 cells can also inhibit melanoma lung dissemination in a therapeutic protocol in mice. DC were first incubated with live tumor cells for antigen uptake and processing, then purified and irradiated for safety prior to injection. This treatment induced stronger tumor-specific CD8+ T-cell responses than treatment by DC cross-presenting antigens from apoptotic cells. Apoptotic B16 cells induced more IL-10 secretion by DC than live B16 cells. They underwent strong native antigen degradation and led to the expression of fewer MHC class I/epitope complexes on the surface of DC than live cells. Therefore, the possibility to use live cells as sources of tumor antigens must be taken into account to improve the efficiency of cancer immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2084148790,"Development of the vertebrate forebrain and craniofacial structures are intimately linked processes, the coordinated growth of these tissues being required to ensure normal head formation. In this study, we identify five small subsets of progenitors expressing the transcription factor dbx1 in the cephalic region of developing mouse embryos at E8.5. Using genetic tracing we show that dbx1-expressing cells and their progeny have a modest contribution to the forebrain and face tissues. However, their genetic ablation triggers extensive and non cell-autonomous apoptosis as well as a decrease in proliferation in surrounding tissues, resulting in the progressive loss of most of the forebrain and frontonasal structures. Targeted ablation of the different subsets reveals that the very first dbx1-expressing progenitors are critically required for the survival of anterior neural tissues, the production and/or migration of cephalic neural crest cells and, ultimately, forebrain formation. In addition, we find that the other subsets, generated at slightly later stages, each play a specific function during head development and that their coordinated activity is required for accurate craniofacial morphogenesis. Our results demonstrate that dbx1-expressing cells have a unique function during head development, notably by controlling cell survival in a non cell-autonomous manner."
https://openalex.org/W2034006644,"Both ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and its regulatory protein, antizyme inhibitor (AZI), can bind with antizyme (AZ), but the latter has a higher AZ-binding affinity. The results of this study clearly identify the critical amino acid residues governing the difference in AZ-binding affinities between human ODC and AZI. Inhibition experiments using a series of ODC mutants suggested that residues 125 and 140 may be the key residues responsible for the differential AZ-binding affinities. The ODC_N125K/M140K double mutant demonstrated a significant inhibition by AZ, and the IC50 value of this mutant was 0.08 µM, three-fold smaller than that of ODC_WT. Furthermore, the activity of the AZ-inhibited ODC_N125K/M140K enzyme was hardly rescued by AZI. The dissociation constant (Kd) of the [ODC_N125K/M140K]-AZ heterodimer was approximately 0.02 µM, which is smaller than that of WT_ODC by approximately 10-fold and is very close to the Kd value of AZI_WT, suggesting that ODC_N125K/M140K has an AZ-binding affinity higher than that of ODC_WT and similar to that of AZI. The efficiency of the AZI_K125N/K140M double mutant in the rescue of AZ-inhibited ODC enzyme activity was less than that of AZI_WT. The Kd value of [AZI_K125N/K140M]-AZ was 0.18 µM, nine-fold larger than that of AZI_WT and close to the Kd value of ODC_WT, suggesting that AZI_K125N/K140M has an AZ-binding affinity lower than that of AZI_WT and similar to that of ODC. These data support the hypothesis that the differences in residues 125 and 140 in ODC and AZI are responsible for the differential AZ-binding affinities."
https://openalex.org/W2152360784,"Background Many insects feed on pollen surface lipids and contents accessible through the germination pores. Pollen walls, however, are not broken down because they consist of sporopollenin and are highly resistant to physical and enzymatic damage. Here we report that certain Microlepidoptera chemically dissolve pollen grains with exudates from their mouthparts. Methodology/Principal Findings Field observations and experiments in tropical China revealed that two species of Deltophora (Gelechioidea) are the exclusive pollinators of two species of Phyllanthus (Phyllanthaceae) on which their larvae develop and from which the adults take pollen and nectar. DNA sequences placed the moths and plants phylogenetically and confirmed that larvae were those of the pollinating moths; molecular clock dating suggests that the moth clade is younger than the plant clade. Captive moths with pollen on their mouthparts after 2-3 days of starvation no longer carried intact grains, and SEM photographs showed exine fragments on their proboscises. GC-MS revealed cis-β-ocimene as the dominant volatile in leaves and flowers, but GC-MS analyses of proboscis extracts failed to reveal an obvious sporopollenin-dissolving compound. A candidate is ethanolamine, which occurs in insect hemolymphs and is used to dissolve sporopollenin by palynologists. Conclusions/Significance This is the first report of any insect and indeed any animal chemically dissolving pollen."
https://openalex.org/W2025937551,"Neurexins (Nrxs) are presynaptic membrane proteins with a single membrane-spanning domain that mediate asymmetric trans-synaptic cell adhesion by binding to their postsynaptic receptor neuroligins. α-Nrx has a large extracellular region comprised of multiple copies of laminin, neurexin, sex-hormone-binding globulin (LNS) domains and epidermal growth factor (EGF) modules, while that of β-Nrx has but a single LNS domain. It has long been known that the larger α-Nrx and the shorter β-Nrx show distinct binding behaviors toward different isoforms/variants of neuroligins, although the underlying mechanism has yet to be elucidated. Here, we describe the crystal structure of a fragment corresponding to the C-terminal one-third of the Nrx1α ectodomain, consisting of LNS5-EGF3-LNS6. The 2.3 Å-resolution structure revealed the presence of a domain configuration that was rigidified by inter-domain contacts, as opposed to the more common flexible “beads-on-a-string” arrangement. Although the neuroligin-binding site on the LNS6 domain was completely exposed, the location of the α-Nrx specific LNS5-EGF3 segment proved incompatible with the loop segment inserted in the B+ neuroligin variant, which explains the variant-specific neuroligin recognition capability observed in α-Nrx. This, combined with a low-resolution molecular envelope obtained by a single particle reconstruction performed on negatively stained full-length Nrx1α sample, allowed us to derive a structural model of the α-Nrx ectodomain. This model will help us understand not only how the large α-Nrx ectodomain is accommodated in the synaptic cleft, but also how the trans-synaptic adhesion mediated by α- and β-Nrxs could differentially affect synaptic structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W2000155083,"Oxidative stress generates harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) that attack biomolecules including DNA. In living cells, there are several mechanisms for detoxifying ROS and repairing oxidatively-damaged DNA. In this study, transcriptomic analyses clarified that disruption of DNA repair genes mutS and mutL, or the anti-recombination gene mutS2, in Thermus thermophilus HB8, induces the biosynthesis pathway for vitamin B1, which can serve as an ROS scavenger. In addition, disruption of mutS, mutL, or mutS2 resulted in an increased rate of oxidative stress-induced mutagenesis. Co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down experiments revealed previously-unknown interactions of MutS2 with MutS and MutL, indicating that these proteins cooperatively participate in the repair of oxidatively damaged DNA. These results suggested that bacterial cells sense the accumulation of oxidative DNA damage or absence of DNA repair activity, and signal the information to the transcriptional regulation machinery for an ROS-detoxifying system."
https://openalex.org/W2049356309,"Species-specificity is one of the major characteristics of cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) and is the primary reason for the lack of a mouse model for the direct infection of human CMV (HCMV). It has been determined that CMV cross-species infections are blocked at the post-entry level by intrinsic cellular defense mechanisms, but few details are known. It is important to explore how CMVs interact with the subnuclear structure of the cross-species host cell. In our present study, we discovered that nuclear domain 10 (ND10) of human cells was not disrupted by murine CMV (MCMV) and that the ND10 of mouse cells was not disrupted by HCMV, although the ND10-disrupting protein, immediate-early protein 1 (IE1), also colocalized with ND10 in cross-species infections. In addition, we found that the UL131-repaired HCMV strain AD169 (vDW215-BADrUL131) can infect mouse cells to produce immediate-early (IE) and early (E) proteins but that neither DNA replication nor viral particles were detectable in mouse cells. Unrepaired AD169 can express IE1 only in mouse cells. In both HCMV-infected mouse cells and MCMV-infected human cells, the knocking-down of ND10 components (PML, Daxx, and SP100) resulted in significantly increased viral-protein production. Our observations provide evidence to support our hypothesis that ND10 and ND10 components might be important defensive factors against the CMV cross-species infection."
https://openalex.org/W1998103364,"Background COUP transcription factors are required for the regulation of gene expression underlying development, differentiation, and homeostasis. They have an evolutionarily conserved function, being a known marker for neurogenesis from cnidarians to vertebrates. A homologue of this gene was shown previously to be a neuronal and nematocyte differentiation marker in Hydra. However, COUP-TFs had not previously been studied in a colonial cnidarian. Methodology/Principal Findings We cloned a COUP-TF homologue from the colonial marine cnidarian Hydractinia echinata. Expression of the gene was analysed during normal development, allorecognition events and ectopic Wnt activation, using in situ hybridisation and quantitative PCR. During normal Hydractinia development, the gene was first expressed in post-gastrula stages. It was undetectable in larvae, and its mRNA was present again in putative differentiating neurons and nematocytes in post-metamorphic stages. Global activation of canonical Wnt signalling in adult animals resulted in the upregulation of COUP-TF. We also monitored a strong COUP-TF upregulation in stolons undergoing allogeneic interactions. COUP-TF mRNA was most concentrated in the tissues that contacted allogeneic, non-self tissues, and decreased in a gradient away from the contact area. Interestingly, the gene was transiently upregulated during initial contact of self stolons, but dissipated rapidly following self recognition, while in non-self contacts high expression levels were maintained. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that COUP-TF is likely involved in neuronal/nematocyte differentiation in a variety of contexts. This has now been shown to include allorecognition, where COUP-TF is thought to have been co-opted to mediate allorejection by recruiting stinging cells that are the effectors of cytotoxic rejection of allogeneic tissue. Our findings that Wnt activation upregulates COUP-TF expression suggests that Wnts' role in neuronal differentiation could be mediated through COUP-TF."

The development of receivers with an acoustic modem has greatly facilitated the practicality of deploying marine lines, as data can now be uploaded to ship remotely. The POST array, which now spans over 3,000 km from California, through British Columbia, to Alaska, is composed of over 400 receivers in 10 ocean lines and strategic regions within rivers. The POST array and the associated database serve as a research tool for answering critical questions on ecology and marine resource management. Valuable data has been collected on salmonids and other marine species, and the combination of POST technology with other molecular and physiological tools is already revealing important clues in mortality and migration behaviours. POST has created a proof-of-concept, continental-scale marine tracking array and has served as a valuable pilot project despite the fact that it didn't realize its full potential envisioned at the beginning of the Census of Marine Life. POST has however served as a flagship model for developing large scale arrays in other regions of the world through the international Ocean Tracking Network."

The anti-VEGF ccFv showed the same binding affinity as scFv but significantly improved stability and phage display level. Furthermore, phage display libraries in the ccFv format were constructed for humanization and affinity maturation of the anti-VEGF antibody. A panel of VH frameworks and VH-CDR3 variants, with a significant improvement in affinity and expressibility in both E. coli and yeast systems, was isolated from the ccFv phage libraries. These results demonstrate the potential application of the ccFv antibody format in antibody engineering."

It has been suggested that FFAR1 may play a role in insulin sensitivity, lipotoxicity and is associated with type 2 diabetes. Here we investigate the effect of three common SNPs of FFAR1 (rs2301151; rs16970264; rs1573611) on pancreatic function, BMI, body composition and plasma lipids. Methodology/Principal Findings For this enquiry we used the baseline RISCK data, which provides a cohort of overweight subjects at increased cardiometabolic risk with detailed phenotyping. The key findings were SNPs of the FFAR1 gene region were associated with differences in body composition and lipids, and the effects of the 3 SNPs combined were cumulative on BMI, body composition and total cholesterol. The effects on BMI and body fat were predominantly mediated by rs1573611 (1.06 kg/m2 higher (P = 0.009) BMI and 1.53% higher (P = 0.002) body fat per C allele). Differences in plasma lipids were also associated with the BMI-increasing allele of rs2301151 including higher total cholesterol (0.2 mmol/L per G allele, P = 0.01) and with the variant A allele of rs16970264 associated with lower total (0.3 mmol/L, P = 0.02) and LDL (0.2 mmol/L, P<0.05) cholesterol, but also with lower HDL-cholesterol (0.09 mmol/L, P<0.05) although the difference was not apparent when controlling for multiple testing. There were no statistically significant effects of the three SNPs on insulin sensitivity or beta cell function. However accumulated risk allele showed a lower beta cell function on increasing plasma fatty acids with a carbon chain greater than six. Conclusions/Significance Differences in body composition and lipids associated with common SNPs in the FFAR1 gene were apparently not mediated by changes in insulin sensitivity or beta-cell function."
https://openalex.org/W2072964965,"Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is partly caused by genetic factors. The underlying susceptibility genes are currently unknown, with the exception of COL3A1. We used three independent GERD patient cohorts to identify GERD susceptibility genes. Thirty-six families, demonstrating dominant transmission of GERD were subjected to whole genome microsatellite genotyping and linkage analysis. Five linked regions were identified. Two families shared a linked region (LOD 3.9 and 2.0) on chromosome 16. We used two additional independent GERD patient cohorts, one consisting of 219 trios (affected child with parents) and the other an adult GERD case control cohort consisting of 256 cases and 485 controls, to validate individual genes in the linked region through association analysis. Sixty six single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers distributed over the nine genes present in the linked region were genotyped in the independent GERD trio cohort. Transmission disequilibrium test analysis followed by multiple testing adjustments revealed a significant genetic association for one SNP located in an intron of the gene 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase (ABAT) (P(adj) = 0.027). This association did not replicate in the adult case-control cohort, possibly due to the differences in ethnicity between the cohorts. Finally, using the selective ABAT inhibitor vigabatrin (γ-vinyl GABA) in a dog study, we were able to show a reduction of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs) by 57.3 ± 11.4 % (p = 0.007) and the reflux events from 3.1 ± 0.4 to 0.8 ± 0.4 (p = 0.007). Our results demonstrate the direct involvement of ABAT in pathways affecting lower esophageal sphincter (LES) control and identifies ABAT as a genetic risk factor for GERD."
