https://openalex.org/W2081259911,"The blood serums of Antarctic fishes freeze at -2 degrees C, which is approximately 1 degrees C below the melting points of their serums. This thermal hysteresis is due to the influence of serum glycoproteins. The temperatures of freezing and melting of aqueous solutions of the purified glycoproteins suggest that this thermal hysteresis results from the adsorption of the glycoprotein molecule onto the surface of ice crystals."
https://openalex.org/W2046602549,"The assumptions underlying the use of the Poisson distribution are essentially that the probability of an event is small but nearly identical for all occurrences and that the occurrence of an event does not alter the probability of recurrence of such events. These assumptions do not seem to be met for evolutionary events since (i) the probability of fixing nucleotide codon substitutions is not equal for all substitutions at a codon, and probably varies for the same substitution in different lineages; (ii) the probability of fixing codon substitutions varies among positions of a cistron; and (iii) the fixation of a nucleotide codon substitution at one position in a cistron modifies, and may even promote, the fixation of a codon substitution elsewhere along the cistron. Natural selection presumably is the causative factor that acts to modify the probability of a nucleotide codon substitution's being fixed in a population. The use of the negative binomial distribution is consistent with the evidence that selective pressure on amino acid or nucleotide codon positions varies both among codon positions of a cistron and at a particular position during evolutionary time. If the number of fixations of nucleotide codon substitutions per position of cistrons encoding cytochromes c are phyletically inferred (phylogeny based on a paleontological record) rather than phenetically inferred (based on paired comparisons of extant species' differences in the absence of a phylogeny) the distribution of these fixation data cannot be described adequately by a single Poisson distribution. The fit of these same data to a negative binomial distribution is very satisfactory. It has been argued that the fit of phenetically inferred fixation data, which do not take account of parallel or reverse fixations, to the Poisson distribution was supportive evidence for the hypothesis that protein evolution results from the fixation of selectively neutral codon substitutions. This argument now appears to be undercut by the evidence that data on nucleotide codon fixation are more probably distributed according to the negative binomial distribution. The fact that fixation data can be described by a particular discrete probability distribution does not of itself provide insight into the mechanisms of the evolutionary process. However, the facts-(i) that the assumptions underlying the use of the negative binomial distribution adequately deal with the varying probability of fixing amino acid or nucleotide codon substitutions at and among the positions of a cistron and (ii) that the negative binomial distribution provides an excellent fit for the phyletically inferred fixation data-suggest that the negative binomial is a very appropriate discrete probability distribution for describing evolutionary events. Amino acids or their nucleotide codon substitutions may be fixed at a position of a cistron as though selectively neutral relative to the codon being replaced, even though the codon position will not be selectively neutral, since many amino acids cannot function there. The negative binomial distribution treats this situation well whereas a single Poisson distribution could only be satisfactory if all codon positions that could vary were selectively neutral."

X-ray diffraction data have been collected for the native protein crystals and for three heavy atom derivatives prepared by soaking crystals in p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate, Hg(CN)2, and PtCl6=. The electron density map is interpreted in terms of four possible models, of which a T-shaped model is favored. The dimensions of this model are compared with those reported by other physical and chemical techniques for immunoglobulin molecules."

The active principle was purified by preparative acrylamide-gel electrophoresis. Application of the hypertonic salt extraction method is now yielding sufficient HL-A antigen to begin the elucidation of the molecular basis of transplantation individuality.
https://openalex.org/W1964517676,"Hydrogen peroxide, dialuric acid, or 6-hydroxydopamine inhibited the uptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin into rat brain synaptosomal preparations. The addition of catalase protected all systems, but catalase was only partially protective for 6-hydroxydopamine acting upon catecholamine uptake. The data show that 6-hydroxydopamine generates hydrogen peroxide and that hydrogen peroxide can damage the biogenic amine uptake systems. Part of the damage caused by the 6-hydroxydopamine that accumulates in the catecholamine nerve terminals in vivo may be attributed to the hydrogen peroxide."
https://openalex.org/W2059624036,Chemical methylation of mercuric chloride with methylcobalamin has been studied. Methylated mercury was detected by gas chromatography; and analysis of the products of the reaction by thin-layer chromatography revealed that the methylation proceeded at a remarkably high rate when methylcobalamin and inorganic mercury were mixed. Dimethylmercury was an initial product of the reaction.
https://openalex.org/W2092859875,"The highly characteristic early and midstage histological lesions of Duchenne dystrophy were reproduced experimentally in the rat by the combination of a vascular abnormality, aortic ligation, which does not affect the structure of the intramuscular blood vessels, and the humoral vasoactive substance 5-hydroxytryptamine. Neither ligation nor injection of 5-hydroxytryptamine alone causes changes in the muscle fibers. This result establishes the possibility of a similar combined mechanism for a nonstructural ischemia pathogenesis in Duchenne dystrophy. The proposed pathogenesis is contrary to the generally held idea that the cause is an intrinsic abnormality of muscle fiber metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1549194029,"Abstract The effects of protein depletion and repletion on the rate of albumin synthesis and on the levels of albumin in hepatic subcellular particles were measured in intact rats. A second serum protein of hepatic origin, transferrin, was measured simultaneously for comparison. A method capable of assaying albumin synthesis within a 16-min interval was developed in order to permit detection of rapid changes in rates of synthesis; in this procedure the total 14C-albumin content of intrahepatic albumin was divided by the integrated specific radioactivity of intrahepatic free 14C-l-leucine from the time of injection to the time of measurement. This method gave good agreement with measurements based on the circulating 14C-albumin at 2 hours after injection of the tracer. A 10-day period of protein depletion caused a 60 to 70% fall in rate of both albumin and transferrin synthesis, and a 40% fall in the quantities of these proteins bound in hepatic microsomes. Upon refeeding a complete mixture of amino acids by gavage, the level of microsomal albumin increased detectably within 15 min, and the rates of albumin and transferrin synthesis rose 50% within 30 min. This response was not inhibited by actinomycin D. These observations demonstrate the close control of albumin and transferrin synthesis by the amino acid supply in vivo. The amount of albumin in the intracellular albumin pool was observed to reach its normal level even before the circulating albumin level was restored, signifying that hypoalbuminemia can elicit increased synthesis without maintaining a decrease in the intracellular pool."
https://openalex.org/W1492668417,"Abstract Pyruvate carboxylase purified to near homogeneity from rat liver mitochondria sedimented as a single peak in the ultracentrifuge, s020,w = 15 S, and migrated as a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate, acrylamide gels. The protomer molecular weight was 1.3 x 105; this unit dissociated further to a mixture of three or four different polypeptide chains. The native enzyme contained both biotin and tightly bound manganese. In addition to substrates the reaction required the presence of acetyl-CoA, magnesium in excess of MgATP, and a monovalent cation (preferably K+, NH4+, or Rb+). A discussion of the mechanistic function of the cations is presented based on experiments in which the substrates were varied at fixed levels of the metal activators. Variation of acetyl-CoA resulted in sigmoid saturation curves that were marked functions of pH, temperature, and ionic strength. Other aspects of the reaction are discussed preparatory to a kinetic study of the over-all mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1537207127,"The reaction of iron(III)-nitrilotriacetate (NTA) with transferrin was studied with a stopped flow spectrophotometer. In the presence of bicarbonate ion the time course of the reaction is biphasic. The first phase is complete within a few tenths of a second, while the second phase requires some 10 s. Although the first phase does not follow second order kinetics, the initial velocity is dependent on both the transferrin and iron(III)-NTA concentrations. The fraction of the absorbance change of the total reaction contributed by the first phase is about 60%, and is relatively constant. The second phase follows first order kinetics. Addition of excess NTA or bicarbonate has little effect on either phase of the reaction. In the absence of bicarbonate the reaction time course becomes monophasic. The absorbance change of the reaction is greater in the absence of bicarbonate, and corresponds closely with static spectra obtained under anaerobic conditions. Based on the data presented, a reaction sequence is proposed. In the presence of bicarbonate, the first phase represents the reaction of iron(III)-NTA with a transferrin binding site to form an intermediate complex involving NTA, iron(III), and transferrin. In the second phase the breakdown of this complex frees the NTA and results in the formation of the specific iron(III)-transferrin-bicarbonate product. In the absence of bicarbonate a stable complex of NTA, iron(III), and transferrin is formed. Possible structures for the kinetic intermediate and the bicarbonate-free complex are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1566741264,"Abstract Highly purified fractions of the plasma inhibitor of activated Factor X were found to inhibit purified thrombin, but had no effect on activated Factors XI and XII or on nonactivated Factor X. The inhibitor was greater than 30 times more effective towards activated Factor X than thrombin, on a weight basis. The inhibition of the biological activity of both enzymes by activated Factor X inhibitor was progressive and irreversible. Irreversible inhibition of activated Factor X by its inhibitor was also demonstrated by employing a purified fraction of goat antibody developed against the inhibitor. Both the coagulant and esterase activities of activated Factor X and thrombin were neutralized by activated Factor X inhibitor. In the presence of optimal amounts of heparin and activated Factor X inhibitor, the destruction of the coagulant activity of activated Factor X and the blockade of the thrombin coagulant activity occurred. The esterase activity of activated Factor X was similarly affected in the presence of heparin, but that of thrombin was unaffected. In the presence of heparin, the complete and irreversible inactivation of the biological activity of activated Factor X by its inhibitor remained unchanged when the heparin was subsequently neutralized with protamine sulfate. In contrast, the thrombin clotting activity blocked by activated Factor X inhibitor in the presence of heparin was quantitatively recovered when the heparin was neutralized by protamine sulfate. The complete recovery of biologically active thrombin was dependent upon the pH of the test system and the ratio of activated Factor X inhibitor to heparin. These data indicate that the efficiency of activated Factor X inhibitor as an anticoagulant during normal blood coagulation (an action profoundly enhanced by heparin) may depend more on its preventing any generated activated Factor X from activating prothrombin than it may on preventing thrombin from attacking fibrinogen."
https://openalex.org/W1514591440,"Abstract The flux of the glycine residue of glycyl-l-proline (Gly-Pro) from intestinal lumen into mucosal cell was investigated in rabbit ileum. Measurements of tissue 14C, after 60-s exposure of the mucosal surface to [Gly-14C]Gly-Pro at concentrations from 0.05 to 32 mm, suggest two saturable influx processes, one with a Vmax of 0.59 Âµmole per cm2 hr and an apparent affinity constant (Kt) of 0.93 mm, and the other with a Vmax of 4.03 Âµmoles per cm2 hr and a Kt of 56.8 mm. The low Kt process was investigated further. After brief exposure to 0.5 mm [Gly-14C]Gly-Pro, all 14C in the tissue was in the form of free glycine. The influx of [Gly-14C]Gly-Pro (Gly(Gly-Pro) influx) at 0.5 mm Gly-Pro concentration was not inhibited by 20 mm glycine and inhibited only 8% by 20 mm l-proline. Conversely, Gly-Pro (20 mm) did not inhibit the influx of either [3H]glycine (0.5 mm) or [3H]proline (0.5 mm). l-Methionine, l-phenylalanine, and l-leucine all markedly inhibited glycine influx but had little or no effect on Gly(Gly-Pro) influx. In contrast, Met-Pro and Phe-Pro strongly inhibited Gly(Gly-Pro) influx but had little effect on glycine influx. All peptides tested inhibited Gly(Gly-Pro) influx except those which lacked a free NH2-group in the Î± position. In the case of Leu-Leu, this inhibition was shown to be competitive. Gly(Gly-Pro) influx was dependent on the Na+ concentration in the mucosal medium, although, at a Na+ concentration close to zero, influx was far greater than could be accounted for by passive diffusion. Removal of Na+ inhibited Gly-(Gly-Pro) influx by reducing Vmax, whereas it inhibited glycine influx by increasing Kt. Loading tissues first with 50 mm glycine or Gly-Pro reduced Gly(Gly-Pro) influx, whereas prior loading with 50 mm proline, leucine, or d-glucose did not inhibit. It is concluded that most Gly(Gly-Pro) influx at low Gly-Pro concentrations occurs by a process selective for dipeptides with a free NH2 group in the Î± position. The process is partially inhibited by a low Na+ concentration in the mucosal medium and also by a high glycine concentration in the mucosal cell."

https://openalex.org/W1496978645,"Abstract Initial rate kinetic studies of soluble rat brain hexokinase indicate that the kinetic mechanism is random Bi Bi. These studies also indicate that the ADP interaction with enzyme cannot be ascribed merely to action at a product site and suggest the presence of a separate inhibitory nucleotide-binding site. Rates of glucose phosphorylation were evaluated in the presence of a number of metabolites at or near their intracellular levels to determine their regulatory potential. Inhibition from ADP, GTP, and UTP was insensitive to fluctuations in the Pi level; whereas, glucose-6-P inhibition was partially relieved by Pi. Studies of the enzyme cumulatively inhibited by the above nucleotides and glucose-6-P indicate that the reaction rate was markedly depressed to a level corresponding to only 3 to 5% of the uninhibited rate. Under these conditions the rate responds to changes in glucose concentration and only large changes in Pi level. The soluble-particulate distribution of the brain enzyme was found to be relatively insensitive to changes in metabolite levels."

https://openalex.org/W1534628900,"The incorporation of 14C-leucine in vivo into transferrin within rat liver cell fractions and in the blood stream has been measured and compared with that of serum albumin. The rate of transferrin production as measured by two techniques was about 0.13 mg per g of liver per hour, one-fifth the rate of albumin production. Both proteins are apparently synthesized directly from the pool of free leucine in the liver, but it takes about 2 min to form a molecule of transferrin in contrast to 1 min for an albumin molecule. Like albumin, transferrin remains bound to cytoplasmic membranes until its secretion into the circulation. The secretion of newly formed transferrin is a slower process than that of albumin, requiring a minimum time of about 30 min and an average of about 80 min. The amount of transferrin found in microsomes was correspondingly larger relative to its rate of production than the amount of albumin; the levels obtained by an immunochemical technique were 320 and 390 Âµg per g of liver, respectively. From the shapes of the curves of microsomal radioactivity, it is proposed that newly synthesized proteins migrate through the channels of the endoplasmic reticulum in an orderly sequence, but that some randomization of molecules of different ages occurs at a stage prior to secretion."

https://openalex.org/W2013429713,Certain tasks which increase attention to stimuli also elicit the contingent negative variation and increase the amplitude of the P300 component of the sensory evoked response. Therefore it appeared possible that the contingent negative variation and attention-related increases in P300 are either confounded by artifact or generated by common neural mechanisms. The fact that we have recorded attention-related increases in P300 amplitude independent of corresponding systematic changes in contingent negative variation indicates that neither of these possibilities is correct. The two phenomena are independently variable modulations of cortical activity.
https://openalex.org/W1496297579,"Abstract Cytochrome f was purified from spinach grana membranes with a final yield of 42%. Using technology of disc gel electrophoresis with and without nonionic detergent, it was found that the cytochrome was intrinsically hydrophobic and existed as soluble aggregates at pH 8 which could be disaggregated by 0.1% nonionic detergent to a single, stable, electrophoretic species. Disc gel electrophoresis with non-ionic detergent was indispensable both in designing and in monitoring the purification procedure and served as a final preparative chromatographic step. The cytochrome moved as a single electrophoretic species throughout the purification. Cytochrome f was inactivated by urea, guanidine, and sodium dodecyl sulfate, which have commonly been used as disaggregating agents. Satisfactory chromatography of cytochrome f in nonionic detergent solution was found possible in uncharged support media (disc gel electrophoresis or, alternatively, on Sephadex G-200), but not on DEAE-cellulose. Proof of homogeneity of cytochrome f is presented. The cytochrome appears to contain one heme-containing polypeptide chain and one non-heme chain, each about 31,000. The absorbance spectra of cytochrome f (reduced, oxidized, and reduced minus oxidized) at 22Â° and at -199Â° are presented. The cytochrome was not autoxidizable, did not react with carbon monoxide, and contained no non-heme iron. The cytochrome was originally tightly bound, perhaps hydrophobically, to grana membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1493246859,"Abstract Sedimentation rate as a function of protein concentration obtained by ultracentrifugation has revealed the dissociation of follicle-stimulating hormone at concentrations below 0.5%; extrapolation to zero protein concentration indicated two s20,w values of 1.98 and 2.89 S, suggesting the existence of a monomer-dimer system. With the s20,w of 2.89 S, diffusion coefficient of 7.504 x 10-7 cm2 sec-1, and a partial specific volume of 0.72 calculated from the amino acid analysis, the molecular weight of the undissociated follicle-stimulating hormone was calculated to be 32,600, which is in good agreement with the value of 31,000 Â± 600 obtained for the weight average molecular weight by sedimentation equilibrium studies. Stokes radii of the unlabeled and 131I-labeled follicle-stimulating hormones were determined by molecular sieve chromatography to be 31.3 and 23.7 A, respectively, supporting the dissociation of the follicle-stimulating hormone at lower concentrations. Treatment of the follicle-stimulating hormone with 8 m urea yielded an s20,w of 0.61 Â± 0.10 S. Ion exchange chromatography of the urea-treated hormone on diethyl amino ethyl Sephadex A-50 resulted in the separation of two subunits designated as Î± and Î². Incubation of the Î± and Î² subunits (1:1 w/w) resulted in a 400% augmentation of the biological activity of the subunits, exhibiting recombination of the subunits. Disc electrophoreses of the Î± and Î² subunits showed two basic and three acidic bands, respectively, suggesting microheterogeneity. Acid hydrolysates (24-, 48-, and 72-hour) of the follicle-stimulating hormone, and 24-hour acid hydrolysates of the subunits were analyzed for amino acids. Amino acid analysis of the follicle-stimulating hormone revealed a total of 236 amino acid residues for a molecular weight of 32,600. A comparison of the amino acid analyses of the subunits indicates higher quantities of histidine, methionine, and glycine, and lower quantities of proline, cysteine, and tyrosine in the Î± subunit than in the Î² subunit. The disc electrophoreses, amino acid analyses, and bioassays indicate that the Î± and Î² subunits are two nonidentical, noncovalently linked components of follicle-stimulating hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1527587609,"Abstract The effects of anions on substrate binding to the mitochondrial and supernatant isozymes of aspartate transaminase (EC 2.6.1.1) have been studied by direct spectrophotometric titrations of the active site-bound pyridoxal phosphate. The binding affinity of both isozymes for amino and dicarboxylic acids is dependent on the type and concentration of buffer anions. At high physiological pH, the substrate dissociation constants are proportional to the anion concentration. At low pH, substrate binding to the enzyme involves the displacement of more than one anion. The anions act as competitive inhibitors of the substrates and are thought to occupy the positively charged sites at the isozymes' active center where the substrate(s) carboxyl group(s) bind. Of all the anions studied, the order of inhibition was benzoate g chloride g acetate g phosphate g cacodylate. The comparison of the dissociation constants of the enzyme-substrate complexes for the mitochondrial and supernatant isozymes confirms that, although there is competition between the anions and the substrates or dicarboxylic acid inhibitors for the active center of the enzyme, the anion independent dissociation constants for substrates and inhibitors are intrinsically different in each isozyme. The various buffer anions also affect the pK of the active site-bound pyridoxal phosphate chromophore in different ways. Instead of the pK values of 6.3 previously reported for the mitochondrial and supernatant chromophore in chloride or phosphate buffers (high affinity anions), a pK of 5.4 can be measured for both transaminases with cacodylate buffers (low affinity anions). Thus, the binding of anions results in a pK shift of the chromophore to higher pH. This shift seems to be more pronounced the higher the affinity of the enzyme for the anion. Anions also act as competitive inhibitors for the second half of the transamination, the conversion of the pyridoxamine enzyme to the pyridoxal enzyme. The anion-binding affinities of the pyridoxamine enzyme are higher than those for the pyridoxal enzyme in both supernatant and mitochondrial transminases. Thus, a given anion concentration will affect unequally the apparent affinity of the pyridoxal form for amino acid and of the pyridoxamine form for keto acid. Since in general, the mitochondrial enzyme shows a higher anion affinity than the supernatant isozyme, whether in the pyridoxal or pyridoxamine form, the anion competition with substrates at any given concentration will be greater for the mitochondrial isozyme. The mechanistic schemes of either isozyme of aspartate transaminase must, therefore, include anion effects. Besides the obligatory enzyme substrate intermediates, there must be complexes such as pyridoxal enzyme-anion and pyridoxamine enzyme-anions in equilibrium mixtures of aspartate transaminase, substrate(s), and buffers."
https://openalex.org/W1995473356,"Squid nerve contains an enzyme that hydrolyzes the nerve gas Tabun at about one-tenth the rate it hydrolyzes diisopropylphosphorofluoridate (DFP), and at about one-third to one-fourth the rate it hydrolyzes Sarin and Soman. Tabun is a more potent inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase than is DFP, is both lipid-and water-soluble, and penetrates readily into the squid giant axon in its inhibitory form. The failure of Tabun to block or markedly decrease the conducted action potential in the squid axon makes it likely that the blocking of conduction caused by DFP is probably not due to inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. Sub-strate specificity with regard to organophosphate metabolism by squid enzyme has possible implications for the disposal and detoxication of nerve gases in the ocean."

https://openalex.org/W1530801197,"Abstract To extend the application of affinity labeling for the characterization of macromolecular steroid binding sites, we synthesized two cortisone derivatives (cortisone 21-iodoacetate and 21-iododeoxycortisone) and studied their reactions with the use of 20Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from Streptomyces hydrogenans in 0.05 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, as the model protein. Both derivatives are capable of the reversible binding step at the active site, as both serve as substrates. Cortisone 21-iodoacetate inactivates the enzyme in a time-dependent and irreversible manner, cortisone slows the rate of this inactivation, and excess 2-mercaptoethanol stops it. Iodoacetic acid did not inactivate the enzyme (with or without added cortisone), nor did 21-iododeoxycortisone. Nevertheless, both steroid derivatives easily react with model sulfhydryl compounds. Radioactive cortisone 21-iodoacetate was then synthesized with 2-3H-iodoacetic acid. Inactivation of the enzyme by this steroid was accompanied by radiolabeling; neither was seen with 2-3H-iodoacetic acid alone. After inactivation and acid hydrolysis, a single major fraction of radioactivity was seen on paper chromatography. Amino acid analysis of the hydrolysate revealed a major radioactive peak (containing 86% of total radioactivity) with mobility identical with standard 1,3-dicarboxymethyl histidine and a minor peak (containing 5% of total radioactivity) with mobility identical with standard 3-carboxymethyl histidine. These observations are compatible with a mechanism whereby the steroid moiety of cortisone 21-iodoacetate delivers the reagent group to the binding site of 20Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, where it reacts with a histidine residue at that site. These derivatives are offered as compounds which may possibly be used to study certain steroid binding sites of high affinity present in receptor proteins of target organs."
https://openalex.org/W1501291041,"Abstract The demonstration that the reactions of Î² oxidation and the glyoxylate cycle occur in the glyoxysome, a cellular organelle isolated from castor bean endosperm, has raised the question of the intracellular location of the enzymatic activation of free fatty acids in this tissue. Glyoxysomes, isolated on sucrose gradients, have been shown to contain a thiokinase which, in the presence of CoA, MgCl2, and ATP (GTP is ineffective), activates free fatty acids to their cognate fatty acyl-CoA derivatives. The thiokinase is specific for fatty acids of chain length greater than C-10. An acetate thiokinase was also found in glyoxysomes. It is specific for ATP and is more tightly bound to the organelles than the long chain thiokinase. Although the long chain thiokinase is easily solubilized, the data show that the intact glyoxysomes can convert free fatty acids to their CoA derivatives and oxidize them to acetyl-CoA."
https://openalex.org/W1540551361,"Abstract Conformational investigations have been carried out on derivatives of lysozyme in which tyrosines 20 and 23 were nitrated (NT2-lysozyme), or in which the nitrotyrosine residues had been reduced to aminotyrosine (AT2-lysozyme). Also, a derivative modified at the 6 tryptophan residues by reaction with 2-nitrophenyl sulfenyl chloride (NPS6-lysozyme) was studied. In optical rotatory dispersion measurements, NT2-lysozyme and AT2-lysozyme showed equal rotations at the negative 233-nm minima and at the positive 199-nm maxima. Also, they had identical b0 values. These two derivatives were more rotatory than lysozyme. On the other hand, NPS6-lysozyme showed an appreciable degree of unfolding evidenced by a decrease of all its optical rotatory dispersion parameters. Measurements of the reduced molar ellipticities showed that the present three derivatives, like lysozyme, give a negative circular dichroism band at 208 nm and a shoulder around 220 nm. Results were in agreement with optical rotation measurements. The rotatory behavior of lysozyme and the derivatives showed no change in the pH range 7 to 3. The conformational changes revealed by optical rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism measurements were also shown by increase in disulfide reducibility. Both NT2-lysozyme and AT2-lysozyme exhibited appreciable disulfide reducibility (one bond) relative to lysozyme (0.03 bond), and the great unfolding in NPS6-lysozyme was also confirmed by the large increase in accessibility of its disulfide bonds (2Â½ bonds). Changes in conformation obtained on binding of each of these proteins with sodium dodecyl sulfate were monitored by disulfide accessibility. It was shown that NT2-lysozyme and AT2lysozyme assume ârelaxedâ conformation with identical disulfide accessibility (two bonds). The conformation of lysozyme also became ârelaxedâ, although to a lesser extent than the tyrosyl derivatives, on binding with sodium dodecyl sulfate. In contrast to these, NPS6-lysozyme, assumed a âconstrainedâ conformation on binding with sodium dodecyl sulfate. It was concluded that conformational changes take place upon modification of the tyrosine or tryptophan residues and that NT2-lysozyme and AT2-lysozyme had identical conformations. From these results and the previously reported immunochemical behaviors of these derivatives, it may be concluded that one (or both) of tyrosines 20 and 23 is located in an antigenic reactive site in lysozyme. The results also indicated that, although the antigenic reactivity of native proteins is highly influenced by changes in conformation, not every conformational change will exert an effect on the antigenic reactivity. This should be dependent on the protein and the nature of the conformational change."
https://openalex.org/W1546557954,"Purification and crystallization of an enzyme which catalyzes the oxidation of 2,5-dihydroxypyridine, an intermediate in nicotinic acid catabolism, are described. The labile enzyme is stabilized by dithiothreitol. Activity lost by dialysis or purification procedures is restored by incubation with dithiothreitol and ferrous sulfate. The enzyme is inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents and iron-chelating agents. The crystalline enzyme, on polyacrylamide electrophoresis with dithiothreitol, yields a single major band and a region of minor diffuse bands. In the absence of dithiothreitol the intensity of the minor bands is increased. On acrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate, a single band with mobility corresponding to a molecular weight of 39,500 is obtained. A single region of enzyme activity corresponding to a molecular weight of 242,000 is obtained on sucrose gradients containing dithiothreitol. A portion of this activity is shifted to a region corresponding to lower molecular weight when dithiothreitol is omitted."

The enzyme dissociates to inactive monomeric subunits in the absence of monovalent cations and reassociates to greater than 80% upon readdition of cations. The reassociation process involves cations in at least two steps. Steps I has little specificity and the cation requirement can be eliminated with ADP or ATP. The second step has an absolute requirement for monovalent cations where the order of selectivity is: NH4+ g K+, Rb+, Cs+ g Na+, Li+. At saturating concentrations of NH4Cl the rate of reassociation is first order with respect to protein which suggests that a conformational change of protein following binding of cation in Step II is the rate-determining process. No species intermediate between monomer and tetramer were observed."

https://openalex.org/W1517519836,Abstract Comparison of the incorporation of various primers into fatty acids by rabbit mammary fatty acid synthetase shows butyryl coenzyme A to be most effective for the synthesis of fatty acids. Butyryl-CoA can be synthesized from acetyl-CoA by the reversal of Î² oxidation by means of enzymes which are present in the cytoplasm. A 3-fold stimulation observed in the incorporation of acetyl-CoA into fatty acids by the fatty acid synthetase on supplementation of the incubation mixture with the Î²-oxidative enzymes suggests that the role of the Î²-oxidative enzymes is to provide the synthetase with the most favored primer.

After an infrared stimulus from a carbon dioxide laser, which has a monochromatic output at 10.6 micrometers, we find evoked potentials in boas with chronically implanted electrodes. Our data suggest that the receptors operate on a thermal principle."

Three separate experiments were performed: (1) with thymine and 2-ketoglutarate, (2) with 5-hydroxymethyluracil and 2-ketoglutarate, and (3) with 5-formyluracil and 2-ketoglutarate. The 18O content was assessed by means of mass spectrometry after gas chromatographic separation of the trimethylsilyl derivatives of 5-hydroxymethyluracil (Experiment 1) and 5-carboxyuracil (Experiment 3) as well as of succinic acid (Experiments 1 to 3). The results show the incorporation of one atom of molecular oxygen in the products. It is concluded that the enzyme(s) catalyzing the three reactions belong(s) to the class of oxygenases for which a 2-keto acid functions for oxygen reduction."
https://openalex.org/W1999791153,"Abstract The conversion of Î±-methyleneglutarate (Î±MG) to dimethylmaleate (DMM) via methylitaconate (MeIT) is the reaction sequence that produces a symmetrical intermediate in the fermentation of nicotinic acid by Clostridium barkeri. Î±MG mutase catalyzes the isomerization of Î±MG in a B12 coenzyme-dependent reaction to form MeIT which in turn is isomerized to DMM by MeIT isomerase. Both enzymes are induced by growth on nicotinic acid and are not detectable in cells grown on glucose. The isomerase reaction favors the formation of DMM, whereas the mutase reaction favors the formation of Î±MG. Both reactions were demonstrated to be reversible. Î±MG mutase activity was assayed by coupling the formation of MeIT with the production of DMM in the presence of the isomerase. The purified mutase has an absolute requirement for cobamide coenzyme. The apparent Km values for Î±MG, Î±-(5,6-dimethylbenzimidazolyl)-cobamide coenzyme, Î±-(benzimidazolyl)-cobamide coenzyme, and Î±-(adenyl)-cobamide coenzyme are 7.14 x 10-3, 7.3 x 10-8, 3.0 x 10-7, and 1.25 x 10-6m, respectively. The most effective coenzyme, Î±-(5,6-dimethylbenzimidazolyl)cobamide coenzyme, is the same one that is synthesized in large amounts when C. barkeri is grown on nicotinic acid. No added cofactors are required for methylitaconate isomerase activity. The Km value is 6.2 x 10-3 m for methylitaconate and 4.0 x 10-3 m for dimethylmaleate. Both the mutase and the isomerase appear to be sulfhydryl proteins; neither requires metal ions for activity. A number of dicarboxylic acids are competitive inhibitors of Î±MG mutase but none of these affect MeIT isomerase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1499460295,"Abstract Polysaccharide phosphorylase isolated from Idaho potatoes was the subject of a steady state kinetic study. The initial velocity of the reaction between Î±-d-glucopyranose 1-phosphate (glucose-1-P) and amylopectin, in the absence of orthophosphate, was determined as a function of substrate concentration. A similar study was carried out for the reverse reaction. The result is characteristic of a sequential reaction mechanism in which both substrates must add to the enzyme before any product can be liberated. Isotope exchange rates at chemical equilibrium were determined for the glucose-1-P:Pi:amylopectin system in the presence of phosphorylase. Exchange of 32P from glucose-1-P into Pi and exchange of 14C from glucose-1-P into amylopectin were followed simultaneously by the use of glucose-1-P containing both isotopes. Concentrations of glucose-1-P and Pi were varied together in their equilibrium ratio at constant amylopectin concentration, and the concentration of amylopectin was varied at fixed concentrations of phosphates. Exchange rates for the two isotopes were equal under all conditions and gave linear reciprocal plots. These results support a rapid equilibrium mechanism. Isotope exchange rates were also determined under nonequilibrium conditions. Exchange of 32P from glucose-1-P into Pi was followed as a function of amylopectin concentration at a fixed concentration of glucose-1-P and several fixed concentrations of Pi. The exchange was also followed as a function of glucose-1-P concentration at a fixed amylopectin concentration and several fixed Pi concentrations. These experiments are equivalent to conventional product inhibition experiments. The results indicate that Pi is a competitive inhibitor with respect to glucose-1-P and a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to amylopectin. Our conclusion is that potato phosphorylase has a rapid equilibrium Random Bi Bi mechanism (Cleland, W. W., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 67, 104 (1963)) involving binary complexes of enzyme with amylopectin, glucose-1-P, and Pi, and ternary complexes of enzyme with amylopectin and glucose-1-P and with amylopectin and Pi."
https://openalex.org/W1985581710,"Cigarettes impregnated with various preparations of Delta(9)-tetrahydro-cannabinol (Delta(9)-THC) and cannabidiol were artificially smoked, and the smoke was analyzed by means of gas chromatography and a combination of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Retention of the two test substances in smoke was 21 to 23 percent of the starting amount. The ratio of Delta(9)-THC to cannabidiol in smoke is different from that in starting material. It is suggested that these differences are the result of partial cyclization of the cannabidiol to Delta(9)-THC. An increase in the percentage of cannabinol in smoke is the result of a partial dehydrogenation drogenation of Delta(9)-THC or cannabidiol. No evidence for the isomerization of Delta(9)-THC to Delta(8)-THC or for the formation of new pyrolyzed products was found."
https://openalex.org/W1572646229,"Abstract Solid phase synthetic peptides have been prepared corresponding to the sequence in staphylococcal nuclease of residues 6 through 47, as well as single substitution analogues of this region in which aspartic acid 21, arginine 35, aspartic acid 40, or glutamic acid 43 was replaced with a closely related residue. Aspartic acid was replaced with either asparagine or glutamic acid, arginine with either citrulline or lysine, and glutamic acid with aspartic acid. All synthetic peptides were examined for the ability to form an enzymically active complex analogous to the nuclease-T' complex formed by nuclease-T-(6-48) (nuclease residues 6 through 48) with the native fragment nuclease-T-(49-149) (nuclease residues 49 or 50 through 149). Whereas [Asn40]-synthetic-(6-47) formed a complex with nuclease-T-(49-149) with about 25% the activity of that formed with the normal synthetic peptide, synthetic-(6-47), none of the remaining analogues generated activity. All four charge-preserved analogues, namely [Glu21]-, [Lys35]-, [Glu40]-, and [Asp43]-synthetic-(6-47), formed inactive complexes with nuclease-T-(49-149), while the amide analogues [Asn21]- and [Cit35]-synthetic-(6-47) did not bind to the native fragment effectively. These, together with earlier data on an analogue with glutamine rather than glutamic acid at position 43 (Ontjes, D. A., and Anfinsen, C. B., J. Biol. Chem., 244, 6316 (1969)), indicate the importance of all of residues 21, 35, 40, and 43 in the formation of enzymically active nuclease-T'. The results support the view, suggested by the structure of nuclease deduced from x-ray studies, that these 4 residues play critical roles in the binding of competitive inhibitors and calcium ions."

https://openalex.org/W1552794490,"Abstract Evidence has been obtained on the content and essential role of sulfhydryl groups in crystalline human erythrocytic purine nucleoside phosphorylase. The present report is concerned with the total number of âSH groups of purine nucleoside phosphorylase and their behavior. Sulfhydryl groups of purine nucleoside phosphorylase differ greatly in their reactivity with sulfhydryl reagents, 5,5'-dithiobis(2nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) and p-chloromercuribenzoic acid (PCMB). One mole (81,000 g) of native purine nucleoside phosphorylase binds with 11 to 12 moles of 14C-labeled PCMB, and there is no increase in number upon denaturation with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). DTNB reacts with four to five âSH groups in the native enzyme, but upon denaturation with SDS 11 to 12 âSH groups reacts with DTNB. The reaction of the first four or five âSH groups of purine nucleoside phosphorylase with PCMB inactivates the enzyme completely, but activity can be restored by addition of an excess of dithiothreitol. However, the reaction of DTNB with four âSH groups causes only a partial loss of activity (60%) which is not reactivated completely by treatment with dithiothreitol. Guanine, hypoxanthine, adenine, inosine, and Formycin B partially protect the âSH groups from the reaction with DTNB whereas ribose 1-phosphate and phosphate are ineffective. However, the guanine does not protect the enzyme from reaction with PCMB. The kinetic behavior is markedly changed by treatment with DTNB either in the presence or absence of guanine. The activation in the presence of high concentrations of inosine reported earlier (Kim, B. K., Cha, S., and Parks, R. E., Jr., J. Biol. Chem., 243, 1771 (1968)) is abolished on treatment with DTNB, and the Km for inosine increases 4- to 5-fold. However, the original kinetic behavior is restored on reactivation of the enzyme with dithiothreitol."
https://openalex.org/W1562993705,"Abstract The phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (l-phenylalanine: tRNA ligase [AMP] EC 6.1.1.6) from rat liver was purified 500-fold by phosphocellulose and Sephadex G-100 chromatography. The behavior of this enzyme during purification suggests that intracellularly it exists as a complex with its specific transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNAphe). The sedimentation coefficient in sucrose gradients of the purified enzyme is 7.7 S while that of the complex with yeast tRNAphe is 11.6 S. This change in sedimentation coefficient is most compatible with the binding of 4 tRNAphe molecules to a synthetase of about 180,000 molecular weight although alternative explanations cannot be fully discounted. Similar changes in sedimentation coefficient were observed on binding rat liver tRNAphe and yeast tRNAphe from which the Y base had been removed. Heat inactivation of the synthetase, as measured by its decrease in ability to aminoacylate yeast tRNAphe, proceeds with apparent first order kinetics between pH 6 and pH 8. At pH 6.3 the rate constant for inactivation, ki, increases markedly with increasing ionic strength. However, at pH 7.5, ki decreases somewhat with increasing ionic strength. An inflection point in the plot of ki in 0.2 m KCl versus pH occurs at pH 6.4 and corresponds to the known pK of histidyl residues. Glycerol substantially protects against heat inactivation under all conditions of ionic strength and pH examined."

https://openalex.org/W1563327893,"Abstract Reaction of p-mercuribenzoic acid (PMB) with transglutaminase in the presence of 50 mm CaCl2 results in parallel losses in transferase, hydrolysis, and esterase activities of the enzyme. Complete loss in catalytic activities was estimated, by the use of 14C-labeled PMB, to be associated with the binding of 1 mole of reagent per molecule of enzyme protein. The PMB-inactivated enzyme is readily reactivated by treatment with reduced glutathione. PMB, added at the level of 2 moles per mole of enzyme protein in the absence of Ca++, is quantitatively bound and causes pronounced changes in the catalytic activity toward amide substrates, but no change in activity toward active ester substrates. With benzyloxycarbonyl (Z)-l-glutaminylglycine, where deacylation of acyl enzyme intermediate is the rate-limiting step for hydrolysis by native transglutaminase, the PMB modification causes a significant increase in the Michaelis constant, but no change in the maximum velocity for hydrolysis. However, with Z-d-glutaminylglycine and Z-Î±-l-glutamyl(Î³-glycine ethyl ester)glycine, where acylation of enzyme is rate-limiting for transfer with native enzyme, the binding of PMB results in a pronounced reduction in the maximum velocity for transfer in each case. These kinetic findings form the basis for a conclusion that the binding of PMB in the absence of Ca++ causes a reduction in the rate of formation of covalent acyl intermediate from enzyme and the acyl portion of amide substrates. The differences in reactivity of PMB with transglutaminase in the presence and in the absence of Ca++, as reflected in the catalytic properties of the modified enzymes, are in accord with earlier observations that a Ca++-induced conformational change in the enzyme protein influences its reactivity toward modifying agents. Dissociation constants for Ca++, 8 Â± 1 and 7 Â± 1 x 10-3 m, estimated from the catalytic changes that occur upon the binding of PMB, are in good agreement with those determined from other direct binding studies."
