https://openalex.org/W3170734619,"Despite the discovery of animal coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, the evolutionary origins of this virus are elusive. We describe a meta-transcriptomic study of 411 bat samples collected from a small geographical region in Yunnan province, China, between May 2019 and November 2020. We identified 24 full-length coronavirus genomes, including four novel SARS-CoV-2-related and three SARS-CoV-related viruses. Rhinolophus pusillus virus RpYN06 was the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 in most of the genome, although it possessed a more divergent spike gene. The other three SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses carried a genetically distinct spike gene that could weakly bind to the hACE2 receptor in vitro. Ecological modeling predicted the co-existence of up to 23 Rhinolophus bat species, with the largest contiguous hotspots extending from South Laos and Vietnam to southern China. Our study highlights the remarkable diversity of bat coronaviruses at the local scale, including close relatives of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV."

Breastfeeding guides healthier immune-microbe relationships by providing nutrients to specialized microbes that in turn benefit the host's immune system. Such bacteria have co-evolved with humans but are now increasingly rare in modern societies. Here we show that a lack of bifidobacteria, and in particular depletion of genes required for human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) utilization from the metagenome, is associated with systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation early in life. In breastfed infants given Bifidobacterium infantis EVC001, which expresses all HMO-utilization genes, intestinal T helper 2 (Th2) and Th17 cytokines were silenced and interferon β (IFNβ) was induced. Fecal water from EVC001-supplemented infants contains abundant indolelactate and B. infantis-derived indole-3-lactic acid (ILA) upregulated immunoregulatory galectin-1 in Th2 and Th17 cells during polarization, providing a functional link between beneficial microbes and immunoregulation during the first months of life."
https://openalex.org/W3165788001,"The capping of mRNA and the proofreading play essential roles in SARS-CoV-2 replication and transcription. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2 replication-transcription complex (RTC) in a form identified as Cap(0)-RTC, which couples a co-transcriptional capping complex (CCC) composed of nsp12 NiRAN, nsp9, the bifunctional nsp14 possessing an N-terminal exoribonuclease (ExoN) and a C-terminal N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase), and nsp10 as a cofactor of nsp14. Nsp9 and nsp12 NiRAN recruit nsp10/nsp14 into the Cap(0)-RTC, forming the N7-CCC to yield cap(0) (7MeGpppA) at 5′ end of pre-mRNA. A dimeric form of Cap(0)-RTC observed by cryo-EM suggests an in trans backtracking mechanism for nsp14 ExoN to facilitate proofreading of the RNA in concert with polymerase nsp12. These results not only provide a structural basis for understanding co-transcriptional modification of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA but also shed light on how replication fidelity in SARS-CoV-2 is maintained."

The cerebellum and thalamus are two key areas involved in shaping cortical output and movement, but the contribution of a cerebellar-thalamocortical pathway to voluntary movement initiation remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated how an auditory “go cue” transforms thalamocortical activity patterns and how these changes relate to movement initiation. Population responses in dentate/interpositus-recipient regions of motor thalamus reflect a time-locked increase in activity immediately prior to movement initiation that is temporally uncoupled from the go cue, indicative of a fixed-latency feedforward motor timing signal.

The ability to generate appropriately timed motor actions in response to sensory cues is a hallmark of mammalian motor control. Movement timing is controlled in part by the cerebellum, as dysfunction leads to the execution of poorly timed actions (Bastian and Thach, 1995Bastian A.J. Thach W.T.

In contrast, disrupting output from fastigial nucleus results in deficits in posture, locomotion, and motor planning, with minimal effects on reaching (Li et al., 2015Li N. Chen T.W. Guo Z.V.

Thus, individual cerebellar nuclei provide differing contributions to movement control, where DN/IPN likely convey motor timing signals via thalamus to cortex in order to initiate and modify ongoing movements (Kurata, 2005Kurata K.

The fastigial nucleus primarily targets ventromedial (VM), while DN/IPN target the anteromedial (AM), and ventral anterolateral (VAL) subdivisions (Angaut et al., 1985Angaut P. Cicirata F.

Key remaining questions are whether ventral motor thalamus plays a role in movement initiation and whether this is dependent on cerebellar input. To address these questions, we developed a cued lever push task for mice requiring execution of a basic stimulus-response behavior for reward. This habitual behavior depends on antecedent stimuli rather than goal value, likely recruiting feedback reinforcement circuits, including VAL thalamus (Balleine, 2019Balleine B.W. The meaning of behavior: discriminating reflex and volition in the brain.Neuron. 2019; 104: 47-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar; Graybiel, 2008Graybiel A.M. Habits, rituals, and the evaluative brain.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 359-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). Using imaging, electrophysiology, and gain- and loss-of-function experiments, we investigated how an auditory go cue transforms thalamic and motor cortical activity patterns during movement initiation. Population responses in DN/IPN-recipient regions of motor thalamus were dominated by a time-locked increase in activity immediately prior to movement initiation, providing a fixed-latency feedforward timing signal to motor cortex. Consistent with this view, membrane potential dynamics of layer 5B projection neurons matched pre-movement timing of thalamic activation, while suppressing cerebellar or thalamic output blocked movement initiation. Conversely, photostimulation of DN/IPN or recipient thalamic regions triggered movement initiation, but in a context-dependent manner. Our results demonstrate an important and causal contribution of a cerebellar-thalamocortical pathway to voluntary movement initiation. To investigate voluntary movement initiation, we developed a cued forelimb push task for mice. The design of the task required mice to execute horizontal push movements (4 mm) after a randomized inter-trial interval (4–6 s) and in response to a 6-kHz auditory go cue. Miss trials, partial pushes, or spontaneous lever movements resulted in no reward and a lever reset (Figure 1A; Video S1). Mice rapidly learned the task (mean = 7.5 days [6.3, 8.6] 95% confidence interval [CI], N = 16 mice; all data unless otherwise stated are presented as mean [bootstrapped 95% CI]; percentage of successful trials [last session], mean = 63.7% [56.0, 71.7]), displaying moderate reaction times (RTs; last session median = 0.32 s [0.30, 0.34]) and reproducible push trajectories (Figures 1B–1E; Video S1). Even in expert mice, we observed miss trials, likely reflecting changing levels of attention or satiation within sessions (Figure 1E; Video S1). https://www.cell.com/cms/asset/c3c41015-621d-43e8-823f-368e7e1617d3/mmc2.mp4Loading ...

A region of dense overlap centered on VAL and AM nuclei, with sparse colocalization in the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM). We found no overlap in the ventromedial nucleus (VM), which primarily receives input from the fastigial nucleus (Gao et al., 2018Gao Z. Davis C. Thomas A.M. Economo M.N. Abrego A.M. Svoboda K.

Although injections were targeted to DN/IPN, low-level expression was detected in some adjacent vestibular nuclei, which do not send direct projections to VAL (Figures S1A and S1C).

This degree of connectivity is consistent with DN/IPN-recipient regions of motor thalamus (MThDN/IPN) being an important functional node connecting the cerebellum and CFA. To explore whether MThDN/IPN population responses were consistent with a role in movement initiation, we employed gradient-index (GRIN) lens-mediated two-photon population calcium imaging (Figures 1I and 1J). Lens implantation above MThDN/IPN did not affect overall behavior when compared to control (control versus GRIN lens-implanted mice: two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, RT p = 0.56, push duration p = 0.22, number of successful pushes p = 0.35, N = 23 control versus 9 GRIN lens-implanted mice, data not shown). Most MThDN/IPN neurons displayed push-related activity (210/248 neurons) either prior to movement initiation (early-onset increase in ΔF/F0, 104/210 neurons; early-onset decrease in ΔF/F0, 32/210 neurons) or during the execution/reward period (late-onset increase in ΔF/F0, 47/210 neurons; late-onset decrease in ΔF/F0, 27/210 neurons), while during miss trials, MThDN/IPN population responses were absent (11 fields of view [FOVs], N = 8 mice) (Figures 1K–1L). Increased activity appeared as the dominant population response prior to movement (early-onset neurons: increased activity, 76.4%; decreased activity, 23.5%) (Figure 1L) and was found across the extent of MThDN/IPN (Figure 1M). If MThDN/IPN conveys a motor timing signal, then population responses could be described by three hypothetical models. First, thalamic activity is uncoupled from the go cue rising immediately before movement onset. In this regard, rapidly increasing thalamic activity dictates the time of movement initiation (model i). Second, thalamic activity rises at the go cue and is maintained until additional inputs trigger movement. Thus, thalamic activity contributes to, but does not dictate, the time of initiation (model ii). Third, thalamic activity reflects a continuous sensorimotor transformation from cue to movement. The slope dictates the time of movement initiation (model iii) (Figure 2A). To distinguish between these models, we grouped trials by short, medium, and long RTs and aligned trial-averaged ΔF/F0 responses to movement initiation, focusing on early increased activity as this was the dominant population response (Figure 2B). Changes in ΔF/F0 occurred immediately prior to movement initiation, irrespective of RT (median onsets: short RT, −267 ms [−361, −178] 95% CI; medium RT, −276 ms [−374, −177] 95% CI; long RT, −367 ms [−464, −271] 95% CI, n = 104 neurons/9 FOVs, N = 6 mice, p = 0.46, one-way ANOVA). During medium and long RTs, baseline ΔF/F0 was maintained upon cue presentation, rising immediately before movement (Figures 2C and 2D). Response profiles were consistent trial to trial and across mice, indicative of a reliable motor timing signal that is temporally uncoupled from the auditory go cue (i.e., model i) (Figures 2E–2G). In rodents, projections from VAL thalamus target deep layers of motor cortex (Hooks et al., 2013Hooks B.M. Mao T. Gutnisky D.A. Yamawaki N. Svoboda K. Shepherd G.M. Organiza"
https://openalex.org/W3167964895,"Glycolysis plays a crucial role in reprogramming the metastatic tumor microenvironment. A series of lncRNAs have been identified to function as oncogenic molecules by regulating glycolysis. However, the roles of glycolysis-related lncRNAs in regulating colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) remain poorly understood. In the present study, the expression of the glycolysis-related lncRNA MIR17HG gradually increased from adjacent normal to CRC to the paired liver metastatic tissues, and high MIR17HG expression predicted poor survival, especially in patients with liver metastasis. Functionally, MIR17HG promoted glycolysis in CRC cells and enhanced their invasion and liver metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, MIR17HG functioned as a ceRNA to regulate HK1 expression by sponging miR-138-5p, resulting in glycolysis in CRC cells and leading to their invasion and liver metastasis. More interestingly, lactate accumulated via glycolysis activated the p38/Elk-1 signaling pathway to promote the transcriptional expression of MIR17HG in CRC cells, forming a positive feedback loop, which eventually resulted in persistent glycolysis and the invasion and liver metastasis of CRC cells. In conclusion, the present study indicates that the lactate-responsive lncRNA MIR17HG, acting as a ceRNA, promotes CRLM through a glycolysis-mediated positive feedback circuit and might be a novel biomarker and therapeutic target for CRLM."

Less job satisfaction and impaired health can have an impact on health care quality. Our aim was to examine the association of stressors (illegitimate tasks) and health related resources (work-related sense of coherence; recovery experience) with life satisfaction, happiness, job satisfaction and burnout among German general practitioners (GPs). We conducted a cross-sectional survey among general medical practices in Germany. Main outcome measures were life satisfaction, happiness (Subjective Happiness Scale), job satisfaction (Work Satisfaction Scale) and burnout (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory). 548 GPs from across Germany participated (53.6% males, 45.6% females; mostly representative of German GPs). One third (35.2%) of the participants reported a high prevalence of personal, and one quarter (26.5%) indicated a high prevalence of work-related burnout symptoms. Illegitimate tasks are negatively associated with life and job satisfaction and are positively associated with personal, work-related and patient-related burnout among GPs. Work-SoC and recovery experience are positively associated with life satisfaction, happiness, and job satisfaction and are negatively associated with personal, work-related and patient-related burnout. Female physicians have a higher job satisfaction than male physicians. Being female and working as an employed physician is associated with a higher prevalence of personal burnout symptoms. GPs working in a group practice are happier and more satisfied with their job than GPs in single practices. Personal, work-related and patient-related burnout symptoms are stronger in GPs working in a single practice than in GPs in group practices. Our results highlight that Work-SoC, recovery experience and illegitimate tasks are important for creating work-related well-being among GPs. Introducing health promotion activities which aim to strengthen recovery experience and Work-SoC, as well as interventions to restructure tasks, may increase life satisfaction, happiness, and job satisfaction and reduce burnout symptoms in this health care profession."
https://openalex.org/W3167372670,"Alteration of RNA splicing is a hallmark of cellular senescence, which is associated with age-related disease and cancer development. However, the roles of splicing factors in cellular senescence are not fully understood. In this study, we identified the splicing factor PRPF19 as a critical regulator of cellular senescence in normal human diploid fibroblasts. PRPF19 was downregulated during replicative senescence, and PRPF19 knockdown prematurely induced senescence-like cell cycle arrest through the p53–p21 pathway. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that PRPF19 knockdown caused a switch of the <i>MDM4</i> splicing isoform from stable full-length MDM4-FL to unstable MDM4-S lacking exon 6. We also found that PRPF19 regulates <i>MDM4</i> splicing by promoting the physical interaction of other splicing factors, PRPF3 and PRPF8, which are key components of the core spliceosome, U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP. Given that MDM4 is a major negative regulator of p53, our findings imply that PRPF19 downregulation inhibits MDM4-mediated p53 inactivation, resulting in induction of cellular senescence. Thus, PRPF19 plays an important role in the induction of p53-dependent cellular senescence."

Especially in complex statistical analyses-such as the analysis of longitudinal data-reproducing results is far from simple, especially if no source code is available. In this work we aimed to reproduce analyses of longitudinal data of 11 articles published in PLOS ONE. Inclusion criteria were the availability of data and author consent. We investigated the types of methods and software used and whether we were able to reproduce the data analysis using open source software. Most articles provided overview tables and simple visualisations. Generalised Estimating Equations (GEEs) were the most popular statistical models among the selected articles. Only one article used open source software and only one published part of the analysis code. Replication was difficult in most cases and required reverse engineering of results or contacting the authors. For three articles we were not able to reproduce the results, for another two only parts of them. For all but two articles we had to contact the authors to be able to reproduce the results. Our main learning is that reproducing papers is difficult if no code is supplied and leads to a high burden for those conducting the reproductions. Open data policies in journals are good, but to truly boost reproducibility we suggest adding open code policies."

We aimed to investigate whether exogenous l-fucose could be an enteral nutritional supplement to protect intestinal barrier function. The effect of l-fucose on the restoration of epithelial barrier function in both the DSS-induced colitis mouse model and LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells was investigated, and the impact on fucosylation of epithelial cells was examined. The severity of DSS-induced colitis was significantly reduced by l-fucose. Restoration of epithelial barrier function by l-fucose was detected. Direct l-fucose-mediated protection of tight junctions was observed in Caco-2 cells. Moreover, exogenous l-fucose promoted the exogenous metabolic pathway of l-fucose, and fucosylation of epithelial cells both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, knockout of the FUT2 gene restrained fucosylation and the protective effect of l-fucose on barrier function. The severity of colitis was not improved by l-fucose in Fut2 knockout mice. Therefore we conclude that exogenous l-fucose protects intestinal barrier function and relieves intestinal inflammation via upregulation of FUT2-mediated fucosylation of intestinal epithelial cells."

In Japan, the remarkable temperature increase in summer caused by an urban heat island and climate change has become a threat to public health in recent years.This study aimed to determine the potential risk factors for heatstroke by analysing data extracted from the records of emergency transport to the hospital due to heatstroke in Fukuoka City, Japan. In this regard, a negative binomial regression model was used to account for overdispersion in the data. Age-structure analyses of heatstroke patients were also embodied to identify the sub-population of Fukuoka City with the highest susceptibility.The daily maximum temperature and wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT), along with differences in both the mean temperature and time-weighted temperature from those of the consecutive past days were detected as significant risk factors for heatstroke. Results indicated that there was a positive association between the resulting risk factors and the probability of heatstroke occurrence. The elderly of Fukuoka City aged 70 years or older were found to be the most vulnerable to heatstroke. Most of the aforementioned risk factors also encountered significant and positive associations with the risk of heatstroke occurrence for the group with highest susceptibility.These results can provide insights for health professionals and stakeholders in designing their strategies to reduce heatstroke patients and to secure the emergency transport systems in summer."

However, this tool comes with risks as well as rewards, which must be assessed to guide aquaculture activities and recovery efforts. Olympia oysters (Ostrea lurida) provide key ecosystem functions and services along the west coast of North America, but populations have declined to the point of local extinction in some estuaries. Here, we present a species-level, range-wide approach to strategically planning the use of aquaculture to promote recovery of Olympia oysters. We identified 12 benefits of culturing Olympia oysters, including identifying climate-resilient phenotypes that add diversity to growers' portfolios. We also identified 11 key risks, including potential negative ecological and genetic consequences associated with the transfer of hatchery-raised oysters into wild populations. Informed by these trade-offs, we identified ten priority estuaries where aquaculture is most likely to benefit Olympia oyster recovery. The two highest scoring estuaries have isolated populations with extreme recruitment limitation-issues that can be addressed via aquaculture if hatchery capacity is expanded in priority areas. By integrating social criteria, we evaluated which project types would likely meet the goals of local stakeholders in each estuary. Community restoration was most broadly suited to the priority areas, with limited commercial aquaculture and no current community harvest of the species, although this is a future stakeholder goal. The framework we developed to evaluate aquaculture as a tool to support species recovery is transferable to other systems and species globally; we provide a guide to prioritizing local knowledge and developing recommendations for implementation by using transparent criteria. Our collaborative process engaging diverse stakeholders including managers, scientists, Indigenous Tribal representatives, and shellfish growers can be used elsewhere to seek win-win opportunities to expand conservation aquaculture where benefits are maximized for both people and imperiled species."
https://openalex.org/W3168914038,"Segregation of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons by type and eye of origin is considered a hallmark of dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) structure. However, recent anatomical studies have shown that neurons in mouse dLGN receive input from multiple RGC types of both retinae. Whether convergent input leads to relevant functional interactions is unclear. We studied functional eye-specific retinogeniculate convergence using dual-color optogenetics in vitro. dLGN neurons were strongly dominated by input from one eye. Most neurons received detectable input from the non-dominant eye, but this input was weak, with a prominently reduced AMPAR:NMDAR ratio. Consistent with this, only a small fraction of thalamocortical neurons was binocular in vivo across visual stimuli and cortical projection layers. Anatomical overlap between RGC axons and dLGN neuron dendrites alone did not explain the strong bias toward monocularity. We conclude that functional eye-specific input selection and refinement limit convergent interactions in dLGN, favoring monocularity."
https://openalex.org/W3170390297,"Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive bone cancer of children and young adults defined by the presence of a chromosomal translocation: t(11;22)(q24;q12). The encoded protein, EWS/FLI, fuses the amino-terminal domain of EWS to the carboxyl-terminus of FLI. The EWS portion is an intrinsically disordered transcriptional regulatory domain, while the FLI portion contains an ETS DNA-binding domain and two flanking regions of unknown function. Early studies using non-Ewing sarcoma models provided conflicting information on the roles of each domain of FLI in EWS/FLI oncogenic function. We therefore sought to define the specific contributions of each FLI domain to EWS/FLI activity in a well-validated Ewing sarcoma model and, in doing so, to better understand Ewing sarcoma development mediated by the fusion protein. We analyzed a series of engineered EWS/FLI mutants with alterations in the FLI portion using a variety of assays. Fluorescence anisotropy, CUT&RUN, and ATAC-sequencing experiments revealed that the isolated ETS domain is sufficient to maintain the normal DNA-binding and chromatin accessibility function of EWS/FLI. In contrast, RNA-sequencing and soft agar colony formation assays revealed that the ETS domain alone was insufficient for transcriptional regulatory and oncogenic transformation functions of the fusion protein. We found that an additional alpha-helix immediately downstream of the ETS domain is required for full transcriptional regulation and EWS/FLI-mediated oncogenesis. These data demonstrate a previously unknown role for FLI in transcriptional regulation that is distinct from its DNA-binding activity. This activity is critical for the cancer-causing function of EWS/FLI and may lead to novel therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3167777808,"Small animal veterinarians frequently have to manage conflicting interests. Beside the key consideration of the patient's interests, small animal veterinarians are often challenged to consider not only client's emotional needs, but also their own personal aspirations to provide quality patient care and to make a good living as a professional. Further, veterinarians have an interest in continuous professional development and the use of the newest treatments, which may influence their decision-making process. Based on published work, we hypothesize the existence of four decision ethics orientations that veterinarians can use to manage potentially conflicting concerns. These are: the patient-focused, the client-empathetic, the client-devolved and the development-oriented decision ethics orientations. We surveyed small animal veterinarians in Austria, Denmark, and the UK using a questionnaire (N = 648), and successfully identified the four decision ethics orientations in all three countries. The patient-focused and client-empathetic decision ethics orientations are salient in all countries, whereas Danish and UK veterinarians are slightly more client-empathetic and client-devolved compared to their Austrian colleagues. Across countries our findings show that experienced and older veterinarians tend to be more client-empathetic. Younger and less experienced professionals are more development-oriented compared to their older and more experienced colleagues. In contrast to other studies investigating ethical issues in small animal practice, we found no evidence that gender plays a decisive role in the tendency towards any decision ethics orientation. We also show that veterinarians with a higher client-empathetic orientation and development-orientation more often discuss the possibility of health insurance with clients who do not have it. The present study provides a first empirical insight into how veterinarians manage challenging expectations and ethical concerns as part of decision making in modern small animal practice."
https://openalex.org/W3171558333,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a transcription factor activated by exogenous halogenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, including the environmental toxin TCDD, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, and naturally occurring dietary and endogenous compounds. The activated AHR enhances transcription of specific genes including phase I and phase II metabolism enzymes and other targets genes such as the TCDD-inducible poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (TiPARP). The regulation of AHR activation is a dynamic process: immediately after transcriptional activation of the AHR by TCDD, the AHR is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it is subjected to proteasomal degradation. However, the mechanisms regulating AHR degradation are not well understood. Here, we studied the role of two enzymes reported to enhance AHR breakdown: the cullin 4B (CUL4B)AHR complex, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets the AHR and other proteins for ubiquitination, and TiPARP, which targets proteins for ADP-ribosylation, a posttranslational modification that can increase susceptibility to degradation. Using a WT mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line and an MEF cell line in which CUL4B has been deleted (MEFCul4b-null), we discovered that loss of CUL4B partially prevented AHR degradation after TCDD exposure, while knocking down TiPARP in MEFCul4b-null cells completely abolished AHR degradation upon TCDD treatment. Increased TCDD-activated AHR protein levels in MEFCul4b-null and MEFCul4b-null cells in which TiPARP was knocked down led to enhanced AHR transcriptional activity, indicating that CUL4B and TiPARP restrain AHR action. This study reveals a novel function of TiPARP in controlling TCDD-activated AHR nuclear export and subsequent proteasomal degradation."

Neutrophils infiltrate BP skin lesions, however, their role in immune dysregulation remains unclear. We investigated whether BP involves aberrant neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation in skin lesions and circulation; and examined the triggers and deleterious immuno-inflammatory consequences. In the present study, we found that circulating NET-related biomarker levels increased in serum and blister fluid of BP patients and significantly correlated with disease severity. Additionally, circulating neutrophils from BP patients displayed enhanced spontaneous NETs formation than healthy controls. In vitro, BP180-NC16A immune complexes-induced NETosis in neutrophils from BP patients, which was abrogated by Fcγ receptor and/or NADPH pathway blockade. Furthermore, the elevated levels of NETs from BP patients boosted autoantibody production by inducing B-cell differentiation into plasma cells, mediated by MAPK P38 cascade activation. Together, our findings provide strong evidence that NETs are involved in a pathogenic loop, causing excessive differentiation of B cells and promotion of autoantibody production. Hence, targeting aberrant neutrophil responses will provide novel potential targets for the treatment of BP."

Yet there is a lack of validated questionnaires that measure these attitudes. The goal of our study was to construct and validate such a questionnaire and use it to assess attitudes of Croatian scientists. We first developed a 21-item questionnaire called Attitudes towards Open data sharing, preprinting, and peer-review (ATOPP), which had a reliable four-factor structure, and measured attitudes towards open data, preprint servers, open peer-review and open peer-review in small scientific communities. We then used the ATOPP to explore attitudes of Croatian scientists (n = 541) towards these topics, and to assess the association of their attitudes with their open science practices and demographic information. Overall, Croatian scientists' attitudes towards these topics were generally neutral, with a median (Md) score of 3.3 out of max 5 on the scale score. We also found no gender (P = 0.995) or field differences (P = 0.523) in their attitudes. However, attitudes of scientist who previously engaged in open peer-review or preprinting were higher than of scientists that did not (Md 3.5 vs. 3.3, P<0.001, and Md 3.6 vs 3.3, P<0.001, respectively). Further research is needed to determine optimal ways of increasing scientists' attitudes and their open science practices."
https://openalex.org/W3174539914,"We tested the hypothesis that the cognitive impairment associated with inflammatory pain may result from dysregulation of the top-down control of locus ceruleus's (LC) activity by the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) served as a model for inflammatory pain. The CFA injection decreased the thermal thresholds in both sexes but only the male mice showed increased anxiety-like behavior and diminished cognition, while the females were not affected. Increased calcium fluorescence, a marker for neuronal activity, was detected by photometry in the mPFC of males but not in females with CFA. Next, while chemogenetic inhibition of the projections from the mPFC to the LC improved the object recognition memory of males with pain, the inhibition of the mPFC to LC pathway in female mice produced anxiolysis and spatial memory deficits. The behavior results prompted us to compare the reciprocal innervation of mPFC and LC between the sexes. We used an anterograde transsynaptic tagging technique, which relies on postsynaptic cre transfer, to assess the innervation of LC by mPFC efferents. The males showed a higher rate of postsynaptic cre transfer into LC neurons from mPFC efferents than the females. And vice versa, a retrograde tracing experiment demonstrated that LC to mPFC projection neurons were more numerous in females when compared to males. In conclusion, we provide evidence that subtle differences in the reciprocal neuronal circuit between the LC and mPFC may contribute to sex differences associated with the adverse cognitive effects of inflammatory pain."

Fluorofenidone (AKF-PD) is a novel pyridone agent able to ameliorate hepatic fibrosis in an experimental hepatic fibrosis model induced by dimethylnitrosamine. However, the underlying mechanism remains to be further elucidated. In light of the critical role of the NF-κB pathway in inflammation and hepatic fibrosis, together with the preliminary finding that AKF-PD decreases the release of proinflammatory cytokines in the endotoxemia and unilateral ureteral occlusion model, the aim of this study was to explore whether AKF-PD exerts an antifibrotic effect in hepatic fibrosis by inhibiting inflammation and suppressing the activation of the NF-κB pathway in vivo and in vitro. To test this possibility, the effect of AKF-PD on hepatic fibrosis models induced by both carbon tetrachloride (CCL4) and porcine serum (PS) was investigated. Our results showed that AKF-PD treatment ameliorated hepatic injury and fibrosis in both models. Furthermore, the administration of AKF-PD induced a robust anti-inflammatory reaction revealed by the downregulation of the proinflammatory cytokines as well as the suppression of the infiltration of inflammatory cells in the fibrotic liver. The analysis of the mechanism of action demonstrated that the attenuation of the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines mediated by AKF-PD in vivo and in vitro were accompanied by the suppression in the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. In conclusion, AKF-PD might be considered as an antifibrotic agent attenuating hepatic inflammation and fibrosis potentially through the suppression of the NF-κB pathway."

To keep the pandemic at bay, countries have implemented various measures to interrupt the transmission of the virus from person to person and prevent an overload of their health systems. We analyze the impact of these measures implemented against the COVID-19 pandemic by using a sample of 68 countries, Puerto Rico and the 50 federal states of the United States of America, four federal states of Australia, and eight federal states of Canada, involving 6,941 daily observations. We show that measures are essential for containing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. After controlling for daily COVID-19 tests, we find evidence to suggest that school closures, shut-downs of non-essential business, mass gathering bans, travel restrictions in and out of risk areas, national border closures and/or complete entry bans, and nationwide curfews decrease the growth rate of the coronavirus and thus the peak of daily confirmed cases. We also find evidence to suggest that combinations of these measures decrease the daily growth rate at a level outweighing that of individual measures. Consequently, and despite extensive vaccinations, we contend that the implemented measures help contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and ease the overstressed capacity of the healthcare systems."

However, CNAs of long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) in ovarian cancer (OC) and their potential functions have not been fully investigated. Here, based on analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we identified in this study an oncogenic lincRNA termed LINC00662 that exhibited a significant correlation between its CNA and its increased expression. LINC00662 overexpression is highly associated with malignant features in OC patients and is a prognostic indicator. LINC00662 significantly promotes OC cell proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, LINC00662 is stabilized by heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1 (HNRNPH1). Moreover, LINC00662 exerts oncogenic effects by interacting with glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and preventing its ubiquitination in OC cells, leading to activation of the oncogenic p38 MAPK signaling pathway.

Fasting suppresses hepatic mTORC1 activity via the activity of the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a negative regulator of mTORC1, to suppress anabolic metabolism. The loss of TSC1 in the liver locks the liver in a constitutively anabolic state even during fasting, which was suggested to regulate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) signaling and ketogenesis, but the molecular determinants of this regulation are unknown. Here, we examined if the activation of the mTORC1 complex in mice by the liver-specific deletion of TSC1 (TSC1L−/−) is sufficient to suppress PPARα signaling and therefore ketogenesis in the fasted state. We found that the activation of mTORC1 in the fasted state is not sufficient to repress PPARα-responsive genes or ketogenesis. Furthermore, we examined whether the activation of the anabolic program mediated by mTORC1 complex activation in the fasted state could suppress the robust catabolic programming and enhanced PPARα transcriptional response of mice with a liver-specific defect in mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid oxidation using carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (Cpt2L−/−) mice. We generated Cpt2L−/−; Tsc1L−/− double-KO mice and showed that the activation of mTORC1 by deletion of TSC1 could not suppress the catabolic PPARα-mediated phenotype of Cpt2L−/− mice. These data demonstrate that the activation of mTORC1 by the deletion of TSC1 is not sufficient to suppress a PPARα transcriptional program or ketogenesis after fasting.

These data demonstrate that the activation of mTORC1 by the deletion of TSC1 is not sufficient to suppress a PPARα transcriptional program or ketogenesis after fasting. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is often referred to as a master regulator of the cellular metabolism (1Liu G.Y. Sabatini D.M. mTOR at the nexus of nutrition, growth, ageing and disease.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 21: 183-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). mTOR exists in two independent complexes, mTorc1 and mTorc2. The activation of mTorc1 signaling by nutrients and/or growth factor signaling promotes the biosynthesis of macromolecules such as proteins and lipids required for cellular growth. As such, mTorc1 is a strong inducer of anabolic metabolism. In mammals, the switch from the fed state to the fasted state requires the suppression of mTorc1 signaling mediated by the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) consisting of Tsc1 and Tsc2. The TSC is a negative regulator of mTorc1 as it is a GTPase-activating protein complex for the small GTPase Ras homolog enriched in brain. Ras homolog enriched in brain directly binds to and activates mTorc1. Mutations in the TSC cause constitutive mTorc1 activity, anabolic cellular programing, and a rare genetic disease, resulting in tumor formation in multiple organ systems. Consequently, the loss of Tsc1 in the liver results in the age-dependent development of hepatocellular tumors (2Menon S. Yecies J.L. Zhang H.H. Howell J.J. Nicholatos J. Harputlugil E. Bronson R.T. Kwiatkowski D.J. Manning B.D. Chronic activation of mTOR complex 1 is sufficient to cause hepatocellular carcinoma in mice.Sci. Signal. 2012; 5ra24Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that the suppression of the mTorc1 complex by Tsc1 is important for the switch from anabolic to catabolic metabolism in the liver upon fasting. As such, the loss of Tsc1 and therefore inappropriate activation of the mTorc1 complex in the fasted state was shown to suppress peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Pparα) transcriptional activity and therefore prevent hepatic ketogenesis (3Sengupta S. Peterson T.R. Laplante M. Oh S. Sabatini D.M. mTORC1 controls fasting-induced ketogenesis and its modulation by ageing.Nature. 2010; 468: 1100-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar).Hepatic ketogenesis is an important adaptation during starvation (4Puchalska P. Crawford P.A. Multi-dimensional roles of ketone bodies in fuel metabolism, signaling, and therapeutics.Cell Metab. 2017; 25: 262-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Upon fasting but after the depletion of hepatic glycogen, the liver produces glucose de novo. This gluconeogenesis is accompanied by the generation of ketone bodies from acetyl-CoA generated from abundant mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation (5Lee J. Choi J. Scafidi S. Wolfgang M.J. Hepatic fatty acid oxidation restrains systemic catabolism during starvation.Cell Rep. 2016; 16: 201-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Ketogenesis serves two main purposes. First, it is an important mechanism to regenerate coenzyme A by utilizing acetyl units to generate the ketone bodies (acetone, acetoacetate, and beta hydroxybutyrate [βHB]). This enables the continuous oxidation of fatty acids without the need to fully oxidize acetyl-CoA in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and therefore sequestering CoA (6Cotter D.G. Ercal B. Huang X. Leid J.M. d'Avignon D.A. Graham M.J. Dietzen D.J. Brunt E.M. Patti G.J. Crawford P.A. Ketogenesis prevents diet-induced fatty liver injury and hyperglycemia.J. Clin. Invest. 2014; 124: 5175-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Second, they serve as alternative oxidative substrates such that some tissues such as the brain can become less dependent on glucose oxidation (7Cahill Jr., G.F. Fuel metabolism in starvation.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2006; 26: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 8Owen O.E. Morgan A.P. Kemp H.G. Sullivan J.M. Herrera M.G. Cahill Jr., G.F. Brain metabolism during fasting.J. Clin. Invest. 1967; 46: 1589-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). The transcriptional shift in the liver to facilitate ketogenesis is largely mediated by Pparα.Pparα is a nuclear hormone receptor that is activated by lipid ligands in the liver during fasting. Pparα drives the expression of genes in ketogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. The loss of hepatic fatty acid oxidation genes results in an increased expression of hepatic fatty acid catabolic gene expression as the mice attempt to compensate for a defect in the pathway (9Zhang D. Christianson J. Liu Z.X. Tian L. Choi C.S. Neschen S. Dong J. Wood P.A. Shulman G.I.

A. 2007; 104: 17075-17080Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The liver-specific deletion of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (Cpt2L−/−) mice, an obligate enzyme in mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid β-oxidation, results in a robust increase in a procatabolic fasting-induced Pparα transcriptional program (5Lee J. Choi J. Scafidi S. Wolfgang M.J.

Maternal lipid metabolism directs fetal liver programming following nutrient stress.Cell Rep. 2019; 29: 1299-1310.e1293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This is likely mediated by the increased availability of lipids that can ligand and induce Pparα-dependent transcription. As mTorc1 is an inducer of an anabolic program and putative master regulator of cellular metabolism, we asked if the activation of mTorc1 by the deletion of its negative regulator Tsc1 could suppress the catabolic programing of Cpt2L−/− mice in the fasted state.Here, we examined if the activation of the mTorc1 complex by the deletion of Tsc1 in the liver was sufficient to suppress Pparα signaling and therefore ketogenesis in the fasted state. We found that although the activation of mTorc1 in the fasted state had a modest impact on Pparα-responsive genes, it was not sufficient to suppress ketogenesis. Furthermore, we examined if the activation of the anabolic program mediated by the activation of the mTorc1 complex in the fasted state could suppress the robust catabolic programing and enhanced Pparα transcriptional response of Cpt2L−/− mice. Therefore, we generated liver-specific Cpt2L−/−; Tsc1L−/− double-KO (DKO) mice and show that the activation of mTorc1 by the deletion of Tsc1 could not suppress the catabolic phenotype of Cpt2L−/− mice. These data demonstrate that the activation of mTorc1 by the deletion of Tsc1 is not sufficient to suppress a Pparα transcriptional program or ketogenesis after a fast.ResultsGeneration of mice with a combined liver-specific loss of fatty acid oxidation and activation of mTorc1Previously, we showed that the loss of hepatic fatty acid oxidation in the Cpt2L−/− mice resulted in a robust increase in a procatabolic fasting-induced Pparα-dependent transcriptional program (5Lee J. Choi J. Scafidi S. Wolfgang M.J. Hepatic fatty acid oxidation restrains systemic catabolism during starvation.Cell Rep. 2016; 16: 201-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 11Lee J. Choi J.

Maternal lipid metabolism directs fetal liver programming following nutrient stress.Cell Rep. 2019; 29: 1299-1310.e1293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it has been previously reported that activating mTorc1 signaling in the liver by removing its negative regulator Tsc1 (Tsc1L−/− mice) was required for fasting-induced Pparα signaling and ketogenesis (3Sengupta S. Peterson T.R. Laplante M. Oh S. Sabatini D.M. mTORC1 controls fasting-induced ketogenesis and its modulation by ageing.Nature. 2010; 468: 1100-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether activating mTorc1 and clamping the fasted liver in an mTorc1-dependent anabolic state could inhibit the dramatic Pparα transcriptional response seen in mice with defective hepatic fatty acid oxidation (Cpt2L−/− mice). To accomplish this, we generated mice with liver-specific KOs of Cpt2, Tsc1 and Cpt2;Tsc1 DKO mice. First, we confirmed the loss of Cpt2 and Tsc1 in their respective models by Western blotting (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, the loss of Tsc1 was associated with a marked increase in Cpt2 protein, further suggesting an interaction between the two pathways. To investigate the activation of the mTorc1 pathway by the loss of Tsc1, we examined the phosphorylation of canonical mTorc1 targets such as RPS6 and 4EBP-1. These targets are phosphorylated in fed livers by the mTorc1 complex and dephosphorylated in fasted livers. The loss of Tsc1 removes the negative regulation on mTorc1 and maintains RPS6 and 4EBP-1 phosphorylation even within the fasted state, as seen in both Tsc1L−/− and DKO livers (Fig. 1A). In addition, asparagine synthetase, a target of mTorc1-mediated activation of ATF4, is induced in the livers of Tsc1L−/− and DKO mice.The loss of Cpt2 and Tsc1 has seemingly opposite effects on hepatic triglyceride content. The loss of Cpt2 and therefore fatty acid oxidation results in an increase in fasting-induced hepatic triglyceride accumulation (5Lee J. Choi J. Scafidi S. Wolfgang M.J. Hepatic fatty acid oxidation restrains systemic catabolism during starvation.Cell Rep. 2016; 16: 201-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The loss of Tsc1 results in livers with a decrease in hepatic triglyceride accumulation (13Yecies J.L. Zhang H.H. Menon S. Liu S. Yecies D. Lipovsky A.I. Gorgun C. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hotamisligil G.S. Lee C.H. Manning B.D.

Sabatini D.M. mTOR complex 1 regulates lipin 1 localization to control the SREBP pathway.Cell. 2011; 146: 408-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Consistent with these known roles, fasting resulted in pale lipid-laden livers in Cpt2L−/− mice and dark red lipid-poor livers in Tsc1L−/− mice. However, DKO livers were pale and lipid laden, suggesting that the loss of Tsc1 was not able to suppress triglyceride accumulation in Cpt2L−/− mice (Fig. 1B). Quantification of liver triglycerides (TGs) showed the same pattern of suppression of TGs in Tsc1L−/− and increases in Cpt2L−/− and DKO mice (Fig. 1C). We also measured the concentration of fasting liver βHB by LC/MS, and contrary to previous reports (3Sengupta S. Peterson T.R. Laplante M. Oh S. Sabatini D.M. mTORC1 controls fasting-induced ketogenesis and its modulation by ageing.Nature. 2010; 468: 1100-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 15Kucejova B. Duarte J. Satapati S. Fu X. Ilkayeva O. Newgard C.B. Brugarolas J. Burgess S.C. Hepatic mTORC1 opposes impaired insulin action to control mitochondrial metabolism in obesity.Cell Rep. 2016; 16: 508-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), Tsc1L−/− liver had an equal concentrations of βHB to control livers, whereas Cpt2L−/− and DKO liver exhibited a marked reduction (Fig. 1C). In addition, we performed Western blotting for Plin2, a lipid droplet protein that is stabilized by association with lipid droplets. Consistent with the liver histology and TG concentration, Plin2 was suppressed in Tsc1L−/− mice and induced in Cpt2L−/− and DKO mice (Fig. 1D). These results are consistent with the known roles of Tsc1 and Cpt2 in the fasted liver and demonstrate the generation of a novel mouse model of activated hepatic mTorc1 signaling in the setting of impaired hepatic fatty acid catabolism.Activating mTorc1 is not sufficient to suppress fasting-induced ketogenesisTo understand the effect of activating hepatic mTorc1 in a model of enhanced Pparα signaling, we phenotyped control, Cpt2L−/−, Tsc1L−/−, and DKO mice in the fed and 24-h-fasted state. The loss of Cpt2, Tsc1, or both did not have an effect on the body weights of 9-week-old male mice (Fig. 2A). Although the loss of these genes had no effect on fasting blood glucose concentrations, DKO mice exhibited increased circulating NEFA and TGs as expected (Fig. 2C). It has been previously reported that mice with a liver-specific loss of Tsc1 exhibit suppressed ketone body production using the identical KO strategy used here (3Sengupta S. Peterson T.R. Laplante M. Oh S. Sabatini D.M. mTORC1 controls fasting-induced ketogenesis and its modulation by ageing.Nature. 2010; 468: 1100-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were surprised to see that the loss of Tsc1 had no effect on the generation of serum βHB in the fed or the fasted state in comparison with control mice. Cpt2L−/− and DKO exhibited a marked suppression of serum βHB because of their inability to oxidize fatty acids in the liver (Fig. 2C). Liver weight increased in the KO mice as expected with fasted DKO mice having enlarged livers without effecting adiposity (Fig. 2D). To further understand the role of Tsc1 in the generation of ketone bodies, we directly profiled the livers of control, Cpt2L−/−, Tsc1L−/−, and DKO mice in the fasted state by 1H-NMR metabolomics. Again, the Tsc1L−/− livers exhibited no change in the βHB concentration, whereas Cpt2L−/− and DKO mice had a marked suppression of βHB (Fig. 3A). Other metabolites profiled were not consistently altered by the absence of Tsc1 save the amino acid lysine which was significantly suppressed in the DKO (Fig. 3B). These data show that the activation of mTorc1 is not sufficient to suppress hepatic ketogenesis.Figure 2Physiological profiling of fed and 24-h-fasted mice with liver-specific single and double KOs of Cpt2 and Tsc1.

Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated that Tsc1L−/− and control mice clustered and Cpt2L−/− and DKO mice clustered (Fig. 4A). Again, utilizing a fourth independent measure, Tsc1L−/− livers did not exhibit a suppression in βHB, whereas Cpt2L−/− and DKO mice had a marked suppression in liver βHB (Fig. 4B). Consistent with the PCA, loss of Cpt2 dominated the metabolic changes in DKO mice (Fig. 4, B–D). The 1H-NMR analysis of DKO livers demonstrated a Tsc1-dependent suppression of lysine in Cpt2L−/− mice. Consistent with these data, unbiased metabolomics demonstrated a suppression in lysine catabolic products such as 2-oxoadipate, glutarylcarnitine, and 2-aminoadipate in the DKO liver (Fig. 4D). These data confirm that Tsc1L−/− mice do not have an inherent defect in ketogenesis and have limited ability to suppress the catabolic phenotype of Cpt2L−/− mice.Figure 4Global unbiased metabolome profiling of fasted mice demonstrates unique contributions of fatty acid oxidation and mTorc1.

To understand the effect of activating hepatic mTorc1 in a model of enhanced Pparα signaling, we performed RNA-seq on control, Cpt2L−/−, Tsc1L−/−, and DKO mice after a 24-h fast. Similar to the analysis of the metabolomic data, PCA demonstrated that Tsc1L−/− and control mice clustered more closely together and Cpt2L−/− and DKO mice clustered more closely together (Fig. 5A). Pathway analysis demonstrated that Cpt2L−/− mice exhibited enhanced Pparα signaling, whereas Tsc1L−/− mice exhibited suppressed Pparα signaling by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome pathway analysis (Fig. 5B). However, the loss of Tsc1 on the Cpt2L−/− background was not sufficient to suppress Pparα signaling. DKO mice do not exhibit a suppression in Pparα, suggesting that the deletion of Tsc1 is not sufficient to suppress fasting-induced Pparα in Cpt2L−/− liver, a physiological model of enhanced Pparα signaling.Figure 5RNAseq analysis reveals differential transcriptional regulation by activated mTorc1 and suppressed fatty acid oxidation.

Consistent with the RNA-seq analysis, the loss of Cpt2 resulted in a robust induction of canonical Pparα target genes such as Elovl7, Fgf21, Acot1, and so forth. However, we could not demonstrate the suppression of these targets in Tsc1L−/− mice. In addition, these Pparα-dependent genes could not be suppressed by the activation of mTorc1 in DKO livers as DKO livers exhibited a similar induction of these genes as Cpt2L−/− livers (Fig. 6). There are several notable exceptions such as Plin5, which was suppressed in Tsc1L−/− livers. These data show that the activation of mTorc1 by the deletion of Tsc1 is not sufficient to suppress the activation of Pparα transcriptional program even in mice with a physiologically elevated Pparα response.Figure 6Activating mTorc1 is not sufficient to suppress fasting-induced Pparα signaling.

Fatty acid β-oxidation plays several important roles during fasting as it provides mitochondrial acetyl-CoA for ketogenesis and along with the abundant reducing equivalents (e.g., NADH) the redirection of carbon skeletons toward gluconeogenesis (16Perry R.J. Camporez J.P. Kursawe R. Titchenell P.M. Zhang D. Perry C.J. Jurczak M.J. Abudukadier A. Han M.S. Zhang X.M. Ruan H.B. Yang X. Caprio S. Kaech S.M.

Given the important roles of hepatic fatty acid β-oxidation, we were surprised that mice with a loss of hepatic Cpt2 could maintain normal blood glucose but a loss of ketone body production after a 24-h fast (5Lee J.

This study aimed to determine the abdominal aorta calcification volume using computerized tomography and its association with serum magnesium levels in pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease stage 5 patients.This single-center cross-sectional study included 100 consecutive patients with pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease stage 5 between January 2016 and May 2020 at Aichi Medical University Hospital, Japan. The relationships between serum magnesium levels and the abdominal aorta calcification volume were assessed using multiple linear regression models after adjusting for clinically relevant factors. We also assessed clinical factors that affect serum magnesium levels.The mean serum magnesium level was 2.0 mg/dL (interquartile range, 1.8 to 2.3). Multivariate analyses revealed that a higher serum magnesium level (stand. β = -0.245, p = 0.010) was significantly associated with a reduced abdominal aorta calcification volume, and that a history of cardiovascular disease (stand. β = 0.3792, p < 0.001) and older age (stand. β = 0.278, p = 0.007) were significantly associated with an increased abdominal aorta calcification volume. Moreover, multivariate analysis showed that the use of proton pump inhibitor or potassium-competitive acid blocker was significantly associated with lower serum magnesium levels (stand. β = -0.246, p = 0.019).The present study revealed that the higher Mg level was significantly associated with lower volume of abdominal aorta calcification in pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease stage 5 patients. Further studies should be undertaken to determine the appropriate magnesium level to suppress vascular calcification."
https://openalex.org/W3175326150,"This paper develops a methodology for the assessment of the short-run effects of lockdown policies on economic activity. The methodology combines labor market data with simulation of an agent-based model. We apply our methodology to the Santiago Metropolitan Region, Chile. We recover the model parameters from observed data, taking into account the recurring policy adjustments that characterized the study window. The model is used to build counterfactual scenarios. We estimate an 8 percent output loss in the first 5 months of the pandemic from the policy that was put in place, achieving a 56 percent reduction in the total number of infections. During this period, with an output loss to 10.5 percent of GDP, the infection rate would have decreased 92 percent, significantly delaying the spread of COVID and spike in infections. Our methodology applied to real data provided results that could be valuable in guiding policies in other lockdown situations in times of disaster, pandemics or social upheaval."

Study 1 identified the core components of the measured constructs theoretically and verified those features through confirmatory factor analysis (n = 2,778). Study 2 replicated these findings (n = 10,707), contrasted the theoretically defined two-factor model to alternative models, and tested for invariance of factor covariances and mean structures for men and women. Study 3 examined the relationship between the EPQ and related indicators of ethical thought (values and moral foundations) and the theory's four-fold classification typology of exceptionists, subjectivists, absolutists, and situationists. The three studies substantially reduced the original EPQ's length, clarified the conceptual interpretation of the idealism and relativism scales, affirmed the EPQ's predictive and convergent validity, and supported the four-fold classification of individuals into ethics positions. Implications for previous findings and suggestions for future research are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3173255961,"Monitoring measurable residual disease (MRD) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) plays an important role in predicting relapse and outcome. The applicability of the leukemia-initiating nucleophosmin1 ( NPM1) gene mutations in MRD detection is well-established, while that of isocitrate dehydrogenase1/2 ( IDH1/2 ) mutations are matter of debate. The aim of this study was to investigate the stability of NPM1 and IDH1 / 2 mutations at diagnosis and relapse retrospectively in 916 adult AML patients. The prognostic value of MRD was evaluated by droplet digital PCR on the DNA level in a selected subgroup of patients in remission. NPM1 re-emerged at relapse in 91% (72/79), while IDH1/2 in 87% (20/23) of mutation-positive cases at diagnosis. NPM1 mutation did not develop at relapse, on the contrary novel IDH1/2 mutations occurred in 3% (3/93) of previously mutation-negative cases. NPM1 MRD-positivity after induction (n = 116) proved to be an independent, adverse risk factor (MRD pos 24-month OS: 39.3±6.2% versus MRD neg : 58.5±7.5%, p = 0.029; HR: 2.16; 95%CI: 1.25–3.74, p = 0.006). In the favorable subgroup of mutated NPM1 without fms -like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication ( FLT3 -ITD) or with low allelic ratio, NPM1 MRD provides a valuable prognostic biomarker ( NPM1 MRD pos versus MRD neg 24-month OS: 42.9±6.7% versus 66.7±8.6%; p = 0.01). IDH1 / 2 MRD-positivity after induction (n = 62) was also associated with poor survival (MRD pos 24-month OS: 41.3±9.2% versus MRD neg : 62.5±9.0%, p = 0.003; HR 2.81 95%CI 1.09–7.23, p = 0.032). While NPM1 variant allele frequency decreased below 2.5% in remission in all patients, IDH1/2 mutations (typically IDH2 R140Q) persisted in 24% of cases. Our results support that NPM1 MRD even at DNA level is a reliable prognostic factor, while IDH1/2 mutations may represent pre-leukemic, founder or subclonal drivers."
https://openalex.org/W3175491006,"Although adipose-derived human mesenchymal stem cell (hADSC) transplantation has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic modality for Parkinson's disease (PD), its underlying mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated. This study evaluated the therapeutic effects of stereotaxic injection of hADSCs in the striatum of the 6-OHDA-induced mouse model. Furthermore, an in vitro PD model was constructed using tissue-organized brain slices. The therapeutic effect was also evaluated using a co-culture of the hADSCs and 6-OHDA-treated brain slice. The analysis of hADSC exocrine proteins using RNA-sequencing, human protein cytokine arrays, and label-free quantitative proteomics identified key extracellular factors in the hADSC secretion environment. The degeneration and apoptosis of the dopaminergic neurons were measured in the PD samples in vivo and in vitro, and the beneficial effects were evaluated using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, Fluoro-Jade C, TUNEL assay, and immunofluorescence analysis. This study found that hADSCs protected the dopaminergic neurons in the in vivo and vitro models. We identified Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) as a key extracellular factor in the hADSC secretion environment. Moreover, we found that human recombinant PTX3 (rhPTX3) treatment could rescue the pathophysiological behavior of the PD mice in vivo, prevent dopaminergic neuronal death, and increase neuronal terminals in the ventral tegmental area + substantia nigra pars compacta and striatum in the PD brain slices in vitro. Furthermore, testing of the pro-apoptotic markers in the PD mouse brain following rhPTX3 treatment revealed that rhPTX3 can prevent apoptosis and degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons. This study discovered that PTX3, a hADSC-secreted protein, potentially protected the dopaminergic neurons against apoptosis and degeneration during PD progression and improved motor performance in PD mice, indicating the possible mechanism of action of hADSC replacement therapy for PD. Thus, our study discovered potential translational implications for the development of PTX3-based therapeutics for PD."

However, effects of combination radium-223 plus abiraterone or enzalutamide on survival and safety remain unclear.This single-center retrospective cohort study used electronic health record data of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases who were treated with radium-223 between April 1, 2014 and February 19, 2019. Patients who received radium-223 monotherapy were compared to patients who received a combination of radium-223 plus either abiraterone or enzalutamide. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, time to symptomatic skeletal event, symptomatic skeletal event-free survival, and incidence of drug-related adverse events. Time-to-event analyses were estimated by log rank tests using Kaplan-Meier curves. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were derived from Cox proportional hazards models. Chi-square tests evaluated difference in serious adverse events between the two arms.A total of 60 patients met inclusion criteria (n = 41 in the monotherapy arm, n = 19 in the combination arm). Differences in median overall survival were not observed (12.7 vs. 12.8 months; HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.59-2.23; P = 0.68), but median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the combination arm (7.6 vs. 4.9 months; HR 1.94, 95% CI 1.11-3.40; P = 0.02). Significant differences were not observed in time to first SSE (P = 0.97), SSE-free survival (P = 0.16), or in the overall incidence of serious adverse events (P = 0.45).Combination radium-223 plus abiraterone or enzalutamide did not improve overall survival, but prolonged progression-free survival without increasing the incidence of serious adverse events in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with bone metastases. However, these results are limited by small numbers and patient selection inherent in retrospective analysis."
https://openalex.org/W3177399825,"Like many indigenous populations worldwide, Yucatec Maya communities are rapidly undergoing change as they become more connected with urban centers and access to formal education, wage labour, and market goods became more accessible to their inhabitants. However, little is known about how these changes affect children's language input. Here, we provide the first systematic assessment of the quantity, type, source, and language of the input received by 29 Yucatec Maya infants born six years apart in communities where increased contact with urban centres has resulted in a greater exposure to the dominant surrounding language, Spanish. Results show that infants from the second cohort received less directed input than infants in the first and, when directly addressed, most of their input was in Spanish. To investigate the mechanisms driving the observed patterns, we interviewed 126 adults from the communities. Against common assumptions, we showed that reductions in Mayan input did not simply result from speakers devaluing the Maya language. Instead, changes in input could be attributed to changes in childcare practices, as well as caregiver ethnotheories regarding the relative acquisition difficulty of each of the languages. Our study highlights the need for understanding the drivers of individual behaviour in the face of socio-demographic and economic changes as it is key for determining the fate of linguistic diversity."

We previously reported that the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway and autophagy are essential to maintain quiescence induced by nitrogen deprivation in S. pombe; however, specific ubiquitin ligases that maintain quiescence are not fully understood. Here we investigated the SPX-RING-type ubiquitin ligase Pqr1, identified as required for quiescence in a genetic screen. Pqr1 is found to be crucial for vacuolar proteolysis, the final step of autophagy, through proper regulation of phosphate and its polymer polyphosphate. Pqr1 restricts phosphate uptake into the cell through ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of phosphate transporters on plasma membranes. We hypothesized that Pqr1 may act as the central regulator for phosphate control in S. pombe, through the function of the SPX domain involved in phosphate sensing. Deletion of pqr1+ resulted in hyperaccumulation of intracellular phosphate and polyphosphate and in improper autophagy-dependent proteolysis under conditions of nitrogen starvation. Polyphosphate hyperaccumulation in pqr1+-deficient cells was mediated by the polyphosphate synthase VTC complex in vacuoles. Simultaneous deletion of VTC complex subunits rescued Pqr1 mutant phenotypes, including defects in proteolysis and loss of viability during quiescence. We conclude that excess polyphosphate may interfere with proteolysis in vacuoles by mechanisms that as yet remain unknown.

The transition between cellular proliferation states, i.e., active mitosis or cellular quiescence (G0 phase), is finely controlled in response to intra- and/or extracellular conditions, such as the availability of growth factors (animal cells) or nutrients (yeasts), and remains a central issue in biology (1Yanagida M.

Failure to control entry into or exit from quiescence may lead to cancer. Moreover, maintenance of differentiated postmitotic cells in quiescence is strongly relevant to pathology of diseases such as neural degeneration. Therefore, regulatory mechanisms governing transitions into and out of quiescence have medical importance. Like budding yeast (3Gray J.V. Petsko G.A. Johnston G.C. Ringe D. Singer R.A.

Rev. 2004; 68: 187-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, has served as an excellent model to study cellular quiescence, because the transition between vegetative proliferation and quiescence can easily be controlled experimentally by adding or removing a nitrogen source in the media (4Su S.S.

These cells remain metabolically active in quiescence for at least 2 months without growth or division (5Sajiki K. Hatanaka M. Nakamura T. Takeda K. Shimanuki M. Yoshida T. Hanyu Y. Hayashi T.

In this study, we investigated an uncharacterized, putative ubiquitin ligase, designated Pqr1, which was originally identified during genetic screening, to find fission yeast mutants of ubiquitin ligase showing defects in viability and/or mitochondrial maintenance (e.g., mitochondrial degradation, mitochondrial morphology, etc.) during quiescence induced by nitrogen source withdrawal. In our analyses, Pqr1 was not a specific regulator of mitochondrial degradation, but it proved indispensable for general autophagic proteolysis induced by nitrogen starvation. The specific function of Pqr1 is to restrict phosphate uptake by downregulating phosphate transporters on plasma membranes and to sustain appropriate levels of cellular phosphate, especially polyphosphate. Hyperaccumulation of polyphosphate, invoked by Pqr1 dysfunction, led to defective vacuolar proteolysis, causing incomplete autophagy-dependent proteolysis and shortened life span during quiescence. In our previous study, we reported that proteasomes and autophagy are important for mitochondrial maintenance and viability during quiescence (9Takeda K. Yoshida T. Kikuchi S. Nagao K. Kokubu A. Pluskal T. Villar-Briones A. Nakamura T. Yanagida M. Synergistic roles of the proteasome and autophagy for mitochondrial maintenance and chronological lifespan in fission yeast.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2010; 107: 3540-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In proteasome-deficient fission yeast cells during quiescence induced by nitrogen deprivation, autophagy-mediated destruction of mitochondria occurs, which may suppress accumulation of ROS to preserve cellular viability. However, the ubiquitin ligases involved are unknown, so we attempted to find mutants defective in sustaining viability and/or mitochondria during quiescence. As a pilot study, 70 ubiquitin ligase mutants (gene deletion or temperature-sensitive) were investigated. We found a gene deletion mutant of a putative ubiquitin ligase encoded by SPAC6B12.07c, which showed loss of viability in quiescence/G0 phase induced by nitrogen deprivation, abnormal degradation of mitochondria by autophagy, and fragmented mitochondria. However, this study revealed that the ubiquitin ligase is important for proteolysis dependent on starvation-induced autophagy, but that it is not specific to mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy (22Okamoto K. Kondo-Okamoto N. Ohsumi Y. Mitochondria-anchored receptor Atg32 mediates degradation of mitochondria via selective autophagy.Dev.

Atg32 is a mitochondrial protein that confers selectivity during mitophagy.Dev. Cell. 2009; 17: 98-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar)) as shown later. We designated the ubiquitin ligase encoded by SPAC6B12.07c as Pqr1 (proteolysis factor that quiescence requires) and sought to determine the mechanism by which this ubiquitin ligase guarantees autophagic protein recycling and sustains cellular viability under nitrogen starvation. Cellular functions of Pqr1 were investigated by means of a deletion mutant of the pqr1+ gene (Δpqr1). The proliferation rate of Δpqr1 mutants on synthetic Edinburgh Minimal Medium 2 (EMM2) was almost indistinguishable from that of the wild-type strain 972 (WT), while Δpqr1 grew slightly slower at lower temperature (Fig. 1A). Then, we examined phenotypes of Δpqr1 under nitrogen starvation (−N). Upon nitrogen withdrawal, effected by changing the medium from EMM2 (containing 93.5 mM NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source) to EMM2 without NH4Cl (EMM2–N), cell number increased (Fig. S1), and ploidy and morphology of Δpqr1 cells were analyzed and compared with those of WT (Fig. 1, B and C). Δpqr1 cells divided twice, arrested with 1C DNA content (before S phase), and displayed reduced cell size, as did WT cells at 24 h under −N. Although nuclei are usually located in the center of the cell, in Δpqr1 mutants, nuclei were located at the cell periphery (Fig. 1C). Mitotic cyclin Cdc13 was decreased in Δpqr1, as well as in WT (Fig. 1D) (5Sajiki K. Hatanaka M. Nakamura T. Takeda K. Shimanuki M. Yoshida T. Hanyu Y. Hayashi T. Nakaseko Y. Yanagida M. Genetic control of cellular quiescence in S. pombe.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 1418-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Pqr1 is dispensable for entering quiescence induced by −N. However, we found that Δpqr1 mutants lose viability after −N (Fig. 1E). Taken together, we concluded that Pqr1 is not required for vegetative proliferation or for entry into quiescence, but that it is required for maintenance of viability during quiescence induced by −N. We next investigated whether Pqr1 has specific functions in mitochondrial degradation. If Pqr1 is specific to mitochondria and is not involved in general autophagy, starvation-induced autophagy may not be affected overall. In WT cells, Atg8 protein on autophagosomes is normally degraded in vacuoles. To determine whether this occurs in Δpqr1 cells, the GFP-Atg8 method was adopted (24Nair U. Thumm M. Klionsky D.J.

In WT under −N conditions, autophagy was active, as confirmed by detecting cleaved-GFP by immunoblot (Fig. 2A). In autophagy-deficient mutants, namely Δatg3, Δatg5, and Δatg13, and in Δpqr1, cleaved-GFP was not detected. If Pqr1 is specific to mitophagy and does not affect nonselective autophagy, cleaved GFP should be detected. This result suggests that in Δpqr1 cells, autophagy-dependent proteolysis may be compromised, rather than mitophagy. We then asked which steps in the autophagy cascade are affected in Δpqr1. First, we examined the activity of target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1), a serine/threonine kinase that controls autophagy (26González A. Hall M.N.

Sci. 2011; 366: 3508-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Upon −N, TORC1 is immediately inactivated, resulting in dephosphorylation of Atg13, which triggers an autophagy cascade (29Kamada Y. Yoshino K.-I. Kondo C. Kawamata T. Oshiro N. Yonezawa K. Ohsumi Y. Tor directly controls the Atg1 kinase complex to regulate autophagy.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 30: 1049-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In S. pombe, TORC1 activity is monitored by phosphorylation states of the S6 kinase ortholog (Psk1) and Atg13 (30Nakashima A. Otsubo Y. Yamashita A. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Tamanoi F. Psk1, an AGC kinase family member in fission yeast, is directly phosphorylated and controlled by TORC1 and functions as S6 kinase.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 5840-5849Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Otsubo Y. Nakashima A. Yamamoto M. Yamashita A. TORC1-dependent phosphorylation targets in fission yeast.Biomolecules. 2017; 7: 50Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To detect Psk1 and Atg13 by immunoblot, endogenous genes of psk1+ and atg13+ were C-terminally tagged with FLAG5 or V5. The anti-phospho-S6 (T389) antibody reportedly recognizes Psk1 phosphorylated by TORC1. Immunoblot analyses showed that Psk1, recognized by anti-phospho-S6 kinase (T389) antibody, disappeared within an hour after −N in both WT and Δpqr1, suggesting that TORC1 was inactivated (Fig. 2B, Psk1p). Dephosphorylation of Psk1 was also confirmed by immunoblot using anti-FLAG antibody. The phosphorylated upper band (asterisk in Fig. 2B), corresponding to the band detected with the anti-phospho-S6 antibody, disappeared within an hour. Consistently, the electrophoretic mobility of Atg13-V5 increased within an hour after −N in WT and Δpqr1, suggesting that dephosphorylation of Atg13-V5 normally occurs in Δpqr1 cells. Hence, we conclude that Pqr1 is not required for sensing nitrogen starvation and inactivation of TORC1. Then, we examined formation of pre-autophagosomal structures (PAS) in Δpqr1. Atg proteins involved in autophagosome nucleation have been reported to form foci, called PAS, after activation of autophagy (25Sun L.-L. Li M. Suo F. Liu X.-M. Shen E.-Z. Yang B. Dong M.-Q. He W.-Z. Du L.-L. Global analysis of fission yeast mating genes reveals new autophagy factors.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9e1003715Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 32Suzuki K. Kubota Y. Sekito T. Ohsumi Y. Hierarchy of Atg proteins in pre-autophagosomal structure organization.Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Localization of Atg8, Atg14, and Atg16 was visualized using GFP (Fig. 2C). The gene for GFP was C-terminally fused to endogenous atg14+ or atg16+ and was fused N-terminally to atg8+ using a plasmid vector for chromosomal integration. The expression construct of GFP-Atg8 controlled by the promoter of atg8+ was integrated into the leu1+ locus on chromosome II. We then investigated localization of these Atg proteins in WT and Δpqr1 6 h after −N and found that all Atg proteins formed PAS, even in Δpqr1 (Fig. 2C). To complete autophagy-dependent proteolysis, autophagosome-vacuole fusion is necessary, so we examined it in WT and Δpqr1. Because GFP fluorescence is sensitive to acidic environments, as in vacuolar lumens, we created a strain expressing mCherry-Atg8. mCherry fluorescence is less affected by pH. If autophagosomes are formed and engulfed by vacuoles, mCherry-Atg8 on autophagosome membranes should be transported into vacuoles, where protease-resistant mCherry should accumulate inside vacuoles. WT and Δpqr1 cells expressing mCherry-Atg8 were shifted to EMM2–N for 8 h, and we observed that the mCherry signal accumulated in vacuoles in both strains (Fig. 2D), suggesting that autophagosome-vacuolar fusion occurs in the absence of Pqr1. These results indicate that nitrogen-sensing, autophagy activation, and autophagosome-vacuole fusion occur normally in Δpqr1 as well as in WT; however, degradation of engulfed autophagosomes may be impaired in Δpqr1. To better understand vacuoles in Δpqr1, we visualized vacuoles with FM4-64, a fluorescent dye that stains vacuolar membranes (Fig. 2E). We observed that vacuoles were significantly enlarged in Δpqr1 24 h after −N, compared with WT (p < 0.01, N = 52). In Δpqr1, nuclei were not located centrally, but peripherally, probably due to vacuolar enlargement in Δpqr1 (Fig. 1C). Then vacuolar functions in Δpqr1 were examined using GFP-tagged Cpy1 carboxypeptidase Y, which requires functional vacuolar proteases for its maturation (Fig. S2) (33Mukaiyama H. Iwaki T. Idiris A.

Vesicle-mediated protein transport pathways to the vacuole in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Cell Struct. Funct. 2003; 28: 399-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The level of immature Cpy1-GFP was higher in Δpqr1 than in WT, suggesting that maturation of Cpy1 may be impaired in Δpqr1 to some extent. Interestingly, the severe lethality of pqr1+ deletion under −N was almost completely suppressed by simultaneous deletion of atg genes, (atg3+, atg5+, atg6+, atg7+, atg8+, or atg13+), all of which are indispensable for autophagosome formation (Fig. 2F). While the viability of Δpqr1 72 h after −N was ∼4%, all double mutants Δpqr1Δatg maintained high viability (>70%) comparable to that of WT (∼84%). Single-deletion mutants of atg genes did not show significant viability loss within 72 h after −N, consistent with previous studies (8Sajiki K. Tahara Y. Uehara L. Sasaki T. Pluskal T. Yanagida M.

Fission yeast autophagy induced by nitrogen starvation generates a nitrogen source that drives adaptation processes.Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In a previous study (35Kohda T.A. Tanaka K. Konomi M. Sato M. Osumi M. Yamamoto M. Fission yeast autophagy induced by nitrogen starvation generates a nitrogen source that drives adaptation processes.Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), a similar loss of viability of Δisp6 after −N was suppressed by Δatg. Isp6 is an ortholog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae vacuolar proteinase B Prb1 and is required for autophagy-dependent protein degradation induced by −N (36Nakashima A. Hasegawa T. Mori S. Ueno M. Tanaka S. Ushimaru T. Sato S. Uritani M. A starvation-specific serine protease gene, isp6 +, is involved in both autophagy and sexual development in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Curr. Genet. 2006; 49: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To obtain further information on vacuoles, we performed electron microscopic analyses, adopting freeze-substitution methods (Fig. 3). Cells of WT, Δpqr1, Δisp6, Δpqr1Δisp6, and Δatg13 were harvested 7 h after −N and were observed. While well-developed vacuoles were seen in WT, vacuoles of Δisp6 contained a number of autophagic bodies (AB), consistent with a previous report (35Kohda T.A. Tanaka K. Konomi M. Sato M. Osumi M. Yamamoto M. Fission yeast autophagy induced by nitrogen starvation generates a nitrogen source that drives adaptation processes.Genes Cells. 2007; 12: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in vacuoles of Δpqr1, ABs were not obviously accumulated comparing with Δisp6, but instead, unidentified electron-dense, amorphous materials (hereafter EDAM) without membranes were seen (Fig. 3, B and H, indicated by ED). Other than EDAMs, the vacuolar lumen of Δpqr1 was much more electron-densely stained than in WT. In Δpqr1Δisp6, ABs were accumulated and EDAMs were also observed (Fig. 3, D, E and I). The AB accumulation in Δpqr1Δisp6 suggests that either autophagosome formation or autophagosome-vacuole fusion may occur in the absence of pqr1+. Pqr1 possesses a C3HC4-type RING (Really Interesting New Gene) finger motif in the C-terminal region and an SPX (Syg1-Pho81-Xpr1) domain in the N-terminal region (Fig. 4A). It has been suggested that the SPX domain may act as a “phosphate sensor” by binding inositol polyphosphates (InsPs), concentrations of which may respond to changes in cellular phosphate availability (27Saxton R.A.

https://openalex.org/W3168609611,"Abl family kinases are nonreceptor tyrosine kinases activated by diverse cellular stimuli that regulate cytoskeleton organization, morphogenesis, and adhesion. The catalytic activity of Abl family kinases is tightly regulated in cells by a complex set of intramolecular and intermolecular interactions and post-translational modifications. For example, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ), important for cell proliferation and chemotaxis, is a potent activator of Abl family kinases. However, the molecular mechanism by which PDGFRβ engages and activates Abl family kinases is not known. We show here that the Abl2 Src homology 2 domain directly binds to phosphotyrosine Y771 in the PDGFRβ cytoplasmic domain. PDGFRβ directly phosphorylates multiple novel sites on the N-terminal half of Abl2, including Y116, Y139, and Y161 within the Src homology 3 domain, and Y299, Y303, and Y310 on the kinase domain. Y116, Y161, Y272, and Y310 are all located at or near the Src homology 3/Src homology 2-kinase linker interface, which helps maintain Abl family kinases in an autoinhibited conformation. We also found that PDGFRβ-mediated phosphorylation of Abl2 in vitro activates Abl2 kinase activity, but mutation of these four tyrosines (Y116, Y161, Y272, and Y310) to phenylalanine abrogated PDGFRβ-mediated activation of Abl2. These findings reveal how PDGFRβ engages and phosphorylates Abl2 leading to activation of the kinase, providing a framework to understand how growth factor receptors engage and activate Abl family kinases.

Reciprocal regulation of Abl and receptor tyrosine kinases.Cell Signal. 2009; 21: 1143-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but the molecular mechanism by which PDGFRβ engages and activates Abl family kinases is not known. Here, we report the molecular mechanism by which PDGFRβ interacts with, phosphorylates, and activates Abl2 kinase. We found that PDGFRβ binds and phosphorylates Abl2 both in vitro and in cells. We also identified several novel tyrosine (Y) phosphorylation sites on Abl2 including Y116, Y139, and Y161 on the SH3 domain and Y299, Y303, and Y310 on the kinase domain. Of notable interest, Y116, Y161, Y272, and Y310 are all located near the SH3/SH2–kinase linker interface, which is crucial for keeping Abl2 in an autoinhibited conformation. Mutation of Y116, Y161, Y272, and Y310 to phenylalanine abrogated PDGFRβ-mediated activation on Abl2. These findings provide a mechanism to understand how Abl family kinases are regulated by receptor tyrosine kinases through different phosphorylation events. Previous work demonstrated that Abl2 coimmunoprecipitates with PDGFRβ from cell lysates (3Plattner R. Koleske A.J. Kazlauskas A. Pendergast A.M. Bidirectional signaling links the Abelson kinases to the platelet-derived growth factor receptor.Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 2573-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but whether the PDGFRβ binds Abl2 directly or which protein–protein interfaces mediate this interaction is not known. Upon activation by PDGF binding, the PDGFRβ cytoplasmic domain (CD) undergoes tyrosine autophosphorylation at multiple sites, which recruit key adaptor and signaling proteins. We hypothesized that Abl2 SH2 domain directly binds one or more of these phosphotyrosines. PDGFRβ was expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and activated by stimulation with PDGF-BB (PDGF). Following stimulation, we found that PDGFRβ could be retained on Abl2 SH2 domain–containing agarose beads but not on beads containing the Abl2 SH2 R198K point mutation that disrupts SH2 binding to phosphotyrosine-containing binding partners (6Lapetina S. Mader C.C. Machida K. Mayer B.J. Koleske A.J. Arg interacts with cortactin to promote adhesion-dependent cell edge protrusion.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 503-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 35MacGrath S.M. Koleske A.J. Arg/Abl2 modulates the affinity and stoichiometry of binding of cortactin to F-actin.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 6644-6653Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). In parallel, the kinase-inactive PDGFRβ point mutant (K634R) did not undergo PDGF-stimulated autophosphorylation and was not retained on Abl2 SH2 beads (Fig. 1, A and B). These data indicate that autophosphorylated PDGFRβ in cell lysates can bind the Abl2 SH2 domain. PDGFRβ is phosphorylated at multiple sites in cells, some or all of which could be binding interfaces for the Abl2 SH2 domain, but previous studies have not resolved which phosphotyrosine (pY) residue(s) of PDGFRβ serve as binding sites for the Abl2 SH2 domain. To address this, we mutated specific tyrosine residues in the PDGFRβ CD to phenylalanine and expressed the mutants in HEK293 cells. All mutants were expressed at similar levels and underwent significant tyrosine phosphorylation following PDGF-BB treatment, but binding of the PDGFRβ Y771F mutant to Abl2 SH2 domain beads was reduced by 90% relative to WT PDGFRβ or any of the other Y to F single-substitution mutants of PDGFRβ (Fig. 1, C and D). Binding of PDGFRβ Y751F was also reduced but only by 10% relative to WT controls (Fig. 1, C and D). These data suggest that phospho-Y771 in PDGFRβ is required to interact with the Abl2 SH2 domain. We next used purified recombinant Abl2 SH2 domain and PDGFRβ CD to test whether the proteins interact directly and to measure the affinity and specificity of this interaction. The PDGFRβ CD was comprised of the residues spanning from the C-terminal end of the transmembrane region to the C terminus of the protein (554M-1106L). We purified 6XHis-tagged PDGFRβ CD following baculovirus-mediated expression in insect cells, fully dephosphorylated it in vitro using phage lambda phosphatase, and repurified the dephosphorylated PDGFRβ CD (Fig. 2A). We incubated PDGFRβ CD in the presence of saturating Mg2+ and ATP for 2 h to enable it to autophosphorylate to completion (Fig. 2A). Purified autophosphorylated PDGFRβ CD bound to the Abl2 SH2 domain beads with submicromolar affinity (Kd = 0.26 ± 0.07 μM), whereas the nonphosphorylated PDGFRβ CD only exhibited weak background binding (Fig. 2B). As in experiments using cell-derived PDGFRβ (Fig. 1B), the binding-defective Abl2 SH2 domain R198K mutant completely abolished binding to autophosphorylated PDGFRβ CD (Fig. 2C). While the PDGFRβ CD Y771F mutant was able to autophosphorylate in vitro, the amount of protein binding to Abl2 SH2 domain–containing beads was greatly reduced compared with WT (Fig. 2, A, D, and E). The Abl2 SH2 domain might bind to other minor phosphorylated tyrosine(s) in the Y771F PDGFR construct, which could explain the small amount of residual PDGFRβ CD Y771F pulled down by SH2 beads (Fig. 2D). Together, our data indicate that the Abl2 SH2 domain binds directly to phosphorylated Y771 interface on the PDGFR CD. Abl2 kinase activity is activated by phosphorylation (26Tanis K.Q. Veach D. Duewel H.S. Bornmann W.G. Koleske A.J. Two distinct phosphorylation pathways have additive effects on Abl family kinase activation.Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 3884-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We used an in vitro kinase assay to measure whether purified recombinant PDGFRβ CD phosphorylates Abl2. We expressed maltose-binding protein (MBP)-Abl2 full length (encompassing the first common exon to C terminus), MBP-Abl2 C terminus (residues 557–1182, ∼120 KDa) and a 6XHis-tagged Abl2 N terminus (Abl2N; residues 74–557, ∼55 KDa) in insect cells and purified them (Fig. 3A). The Abl2 kinase domain–containing constructs carried two inactivating mutations (D307N and K317M) in the kinase domain, which eliminates possible Abl2 autophosphorylation. In the presence of Mg2+ and ATP, 5 nM of recombinant PDGFRβ CD directly phosphorylated full-length Abl2 and the Abl2N but only very weakly the Abl2 C terminus (Fig. 3B). We next investigated whether PDGFR/Abl2 direct interaction is required for PDGFR to phosphorylate Abl2. PDGFRβ CD phosphorylation of the Abl2N (R198K) SH2 domain mutant, defective in binding, was greatly reduced relative to WT Abl2N (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that SH2 domain–mediated Abl2 recruitment to PDGFR is required for its phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Abl2 at Y272 in the SH2 domain-kinase linker and Y439 in the kinase activation loop can activate its kinase activity, and Abl1 is similarly activated via phosphorylation of those homologous sites (25Brasher B.B. Van Etten R.A. c-Abl has high intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity that is stimulated by mutation of the Src homology 3 domain and by autophosphorylation at two distinct regulatory tyrosines.J. Biol.

Two distinct phosphorylation pathways have additive effects on Abl family kinase activation.Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 3884-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We mutated these sites in the Abl2N construct to test how this impacts phosphorylation by the PDGFRβ CD. Unexpectedly, we found that the PDGFRβ CD could still phosphorylate Abl2N Y272F/Y439F mutant with a similar kcat (6.8 versus 7.3 min−1) and KM (1.6 versus 2.8 μM) as compared with WT, suggesting that the PDGFRβ CD phosphorylates one or more novel sites in Abl2 (Fig. 3D). In order to identify the novel phosphorylation sites, we performed phosphopeptide mapping with MS. Abl2N purified from insect cells was treated with a mix of Lambda protein phosphatase and YopH for dephosphorylation. Abl2N phosphorylated by PDGFRβ CD was monitored for phosphorylation status at different time points. Samples immunoblotted for phosphotyrosine show phosphorylation intensity saturates at a reaction time of 2 h (Fig. 4A, top panel). Phos-tag SDS-PAGE successfully separated unphosphorylated Abl2N and resolved multiple phosphorylated Abl2N species in the PDGFRβ CD-treated samples. As kinase reaction time increases, the intensity increases for higher phosphorylated states of Abl2N, whereas the intensity decreases for lower phosphorylated states and nonphosphorylated Abl2N (Fig. 4A, lower panel). The phosphorylated Abl2N was used to perform phosphopeptide mapping by MS to locate potential new phosphotyrosine residues. We attempted to limit nonspecific phosphorylation as much as possible by reducing both the kinase concentration and time of phosphorylation. MS analysis identified seven tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Fig. 4B), including phospho-Y439, which was previously identified as an Src family kinase (SFK)–mediated phosphorylation site (26Tanis K.Q. Veach D. Duewel H.S. Bornmann W.G. Koleske A.J. Two distinct phosphorylation pathways have additive effects on Abl family kinase activation.Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 3884-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4C) and several novel sites including phospho-Y161 (Fig. 4D). In parallel with the MS study, we used smaller subfragments of Abl2N as substrates to identify regions phosphorylated by PDGFRβ. We found that the isolated tandem SH3–SH2 domain fragment, a fragment of the SH2 domain containing the SH2–kinase linker, and the kinase domain were all phosphorylated by PDGFRβ, indicating that PDGFRβ can phosphorylate multiple sites as MS study suggests. To cross examine the MS study, we created a panel of Y to F subs"

Despite the base station involving several ingenious scheduling schemes for resource allocation, the intended outcome might be influenced by the interference, especially in heterogeneous scenarios, where many kinds of small cells can be deployed under the coverage of macrocell area. To develop the network of small cells, it is essential to take into account such boundaries, in particular, mobility, interference and resources scheduling a strategy which assist getting a higher spectral efficiency in anticipate small cells. Another challenge with small cellular network deployment is further analyzing the impact of power control techniques in the uplink direction for the network performance. With that being said, this article investigates the problem of interference in LTE-advanced heterogeneous networks. The proposed scheme allows mitigation inter-cell interference through fractional self-powered control performed at each femtocell user. This study analyzes a scheme with optimum power value that provides a compromise between the served uplink signal within unwanted interference plus noise ratio to enhance spectral efficiency in terms of throughput. In particular, the maximum transmit power for user equipment in uplink direction should be reviewed for small cells as a major contributor to the interference. The simulation results showed that the proposed fractional power control approach can outperform the traditional power control employed as a full compensation mode in small cell uplinks."
https://openalex.org/W3173704638,"The purpose of this study is to examine the prevalence, associated factors and quality of life associated with depressive disorder in cervical cancer patients.This cross-sectional study was carried out in a gynecologic oncology clinic of a university hospital in Northern Thailand from October 2018 to August 2019. Two-hundred cervical cancer patients were screened for depressive disorder using the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and psychiatrists interviewed eligible patients to confirm diagnoses. We measured the quality of life using questionnaires from the European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer: Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and Cervical Cancer Module 24 (EORTC QLQ-Cx24). Associated factors, including comorbidity, fatigue, and pain, were collected using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), the eleven-item Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFQ 11), and the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, respectively.Twenty-seven (13.5%) cervical cancer patients were diagnosed with depressive disorder by psychiatrists according to the DSM-5. Depressive disorder was related to a worse quality of life in these patients. A binary logistic regression analysis revealed that depressive disorder among these patients was linked with these factors: high fatigue score (aOR: 1.35; CI: 1.18-1.53), high pain score (aOR: 1.25; CI: 1.02-1.54), no perception of social support, (aOR: 3.12; CI: 1.11-8.81), and no previous surgical treatment for cervical cancer (aOR: 2.99; CI: 1.08-8.29).The depressive disorder prevalence was 13.5% in Northern Thai cervical cancer patients. In this demographic, cervical cancer patients-who reported high fatigue or pain scores, did not perceive social support, or had no previous cervical cancer surgery- were more likely to have depressive disorder."

This study aimed to examine the variation of periodontitis experienced with different serotypes suffered by RA patients and to examine the relationship between the different medications taken for RA that may influence this relationship. Two hundred and sixty RA and control participants underwent standardized periodontal examinations. Medical, serological and radiological (Sharp/van der Heijde) records were assessed. Functional status was assessed using the administered Health Assessment Questionnaire. Moreover, disease parameters, including disease activity (DAS28-ESR) and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) and rheumatoid factor (RF) seropositivity were evaluated. Periodontitis was higher in RA (71.54%) compared with controls (54.62%). The stage of periodontitis experienced by ACPA-positive participants were higher than APCA-negative participants. The probing pocket depth and recession experienced by RF-positive participants were higher than those who were RF-negative. RA participants on methotrexate had lower clinical attachment loss and lower periodontal probing depth compared with participants on a combination methotrexate and other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Participants taking corticosteroids had lower gingival index scores. The association between seropositivity and the type of medications taken with periodontal health parameters in this group of patients suggests that both seropositivity and medications taken are important modifiers in the relationship between periodontitis and RA."
https://openalex.org/W3174817875,"Oligoasthenozoospermia is a complex disease caused by a variety of factors, and its incidence is increasing yearly worldwide. Yishen Tongluo formula (YSTLF), created by Professor Sun Zixue, has been used to treat oligoasthenozoospermia in clinical practice for several decades with a good therapeutic effect. However, the chemical and pharmacological profiles of YSTLF remain unclear and need to be elucidated. In this study, a network pharmacology approach was applied to explore the potential mechanisms of YSTLF in oligoasthenozoospermia treatment. All of the compounds in YSTLF were retrieved from the corresponding databases, and the bioactive ingredients were screened according to their oral bioavailability (OB) and drug-likeness (DL). The potential proteins of YSTLF were obtained from the traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology (TCMSP) database and the Bioinformatics Analysis Tool for Molecular Mechanism of Traditional Chinese Medicine (BATMAN-TCM) database, while the potential genes of oligoasthenozoospermia were obtained from the GeneCards database and the DisGeNET database. The STRING database was used to construct an interaction network according to the common targets identified by the online tool Venny for YSTLF and oligoasthenozoospermia. The topological characteristics of nodes were visualized and analyzed through Cytoscape. Biological functions and significant pathways were determined and analyzed using the Gene Ontology (GO) knowledgebase, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Metascape. Finally, the disease-formula-compound-target-pathway network was constructed by Cytoscape. A total of 106 bioactive ingredients and 134 potential targets from YSTLF were associated with oligoasthenozoospermia or considered to be therapeutically relevant. Pathway analysis indicated that the PI3K/Akt, MAPK and apoptosis signaling pathways were significant pathways involved in oligoasthenozoospermia. In conclusion, the current study expounded the pharmacological actions and molecular mechanisms of YSTLF in treating oligoasthenozoospermia from a holistic viewpoint. The potential molecular mechanisms were closely related to antioxidative stress, antiapoptosis and anti-inflammation, with TNF, CCND1, ESR1, NFKBIA, NR3C1, MAPK8, and IL6 being possible targets. This network pharmacology prediction may offer a helpful tool to illustrate the molecular mechanisms of the Chinese herbal compound YSTLF in oligoasthenozoospermia treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3167524638,"PB1-F2 is a virulence factor of influenza A virus known to increase viral pathogenicity in mammalian hosts. PB1-F2 is an intrinsically disordered protein displaying a propensity to form amyloid-like fibers. However, the correlation between PB1-F2 structures and the resulting inflammatory response is unknown. Here, we used synchrotron-coupled Fourier transform-IR and deep UV microscopies to determine the presence of PB1-F2 fibers in influenza A virus–infected mice. In order to study the correlation between PB1-F2 structure and the inflammatory response, transgenic mice expressing luciferase under the control of an NF-κB promotor, allowing in vivo monitoring of inflammation, were intranasally instilled with monomeric, fibrillated, or truncated forms of recombinant PB1-F2. Our intravital NF-κB imaging, supported by cytokine quantification, clearly shows the proinflammatory effect of PB1-F2 fibers compared with N-terminal region of PB1-F2 unable to fibrillate. It is noteworthy that instillation of monomeric PB1-F2 of H5N1 virus induced a stronger inflammatory response when compared with prefibrillated PB1-F2 of H1N1 virus, suggesting mechanisms of virulence depending on PB1-F2 sequence. Finally, using whole-body plethysmography to measure volume changes in the lungs, we quantified the effects of the different forms of PB1-F2 on respiratory parameters.

Influenza A virus (IAV), the causative agent of flu, is a major source of respiratory disease worldwide. IAVs are members of the Orthomyxoviridae family, and their genome is constituted of eight segments of single-stranded negative-sense RNA encoding up to 17 proteins (1Dou D. Revol R. Ostbye H. Wang H. Daniels R. Influenza A virus cell entry, replication, virion assembly and movement.Front. Immunol. 2018; 9: 1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). According to the World Health Organization, the impact of this pathogen on the human population is estimated to result in about 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths worldwide each year (http://www.who.int/influenza/en/). IAV spreads through aerosol or by direct contact with respiratory secretions, and it causes acute respiratory tract infections by targeting and replicating within epithelial cells of both upper and lower respiratory tracts. IAV can affect all populations by inducing primary viral pneumonia, a pulmonary manifestation recognized as extremely severe (2Rello J. Pop-Vicas A. Clinical review: Primary influenza viral pneumonia.Crit. Care. 2009; 13: 235Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, many IAV-related complications are likely to develop even in the case of moderate viral pathology, including bacterial superinfection. Indeed, IAV infection predisposes to secondary bacterial infections (secondary pneumonia) by inducing changes in the lung's physical and immunological defenses (3Barthelemy A. Ivanov S. Fontaine J. Soulard D. Bouabe H. Paget C. Faveeuw C. Trottein F. Influenza A virus-induced release of interleukin-10 inhibits the anti-microbial activities of invariant natural killer T cells during invasive pneumococcal superinfection.Mucosal Immunol. 2017; 10: 460-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The most common coinfecting bacterial pathogens are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes (4Kash J.C. Taubenberger J.K. The role of viral, host, and secondary bacterial factors in influenza pathogenesis.Am. J. Pathol. 2015; 185: 1528-1536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The IAV-associated morbidity is mediated by several virulence factors. Among them, PB1-F2 has been well described for its propensity to promote and increase the severity of secondary bacterial infection (5McAuley J.L. Hornung F. Boyd K.L. Smith A.M. McKeon R. Bennink J. Yewdell J.W. McCullers J.A.

PB1-F2 is a small accessory protein encoded by a +1 alternate reading frame of IAV segment 2. This viral protein presents a wide degree of sequence and length polymorphism depending on the viral strain and can be considered as a virulence factor since most of the IAV strains expressing a full-length PB1-F2 are more pathogenic than strains expressing a C-terminally truncated version of the protein. Likewise, in mammalian hosts, laboratory engineered PB1-F2 knockout viruses show a loss of virulence when compared with their WT PB1-F2–expressing counterparts (6Le Goffic R. Leymarie O. Chevalier C.

The supramolecular organization of PB1-F2 has been described to be implicated in the alteration of host-cell integrity (17Vidic J. Richard C.A. Pechoux C. Da Costa B. Bertho N. Mazerat S. Delmas B. Chevalier C. Amyloid assemblies of influenza A virus PB1-F2 protein damage membrane and induce cytotoxicity.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 739-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar): PB1-F2 amyloid-like fibers display no cytotoxicity when added to mammalian cells, whereas soluble oligomers are highly cytotoxic and disrupt membrane at nanomolar concentrations depending on membrane composition (18Ajjaji D. Richard C.A. Mazerat S. Chevalier C. Vidic J.

Commun. 2016; 477: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). PB1-F2 is initially produced within the infected cell but, because of its membrane disruption activity, PB1-F2 can also be found in the extracellular medium after lysis of the host cell (17Vidic J. Richard C.A. Pechoux C. Da Costa B. Bertho N. Mazerat S. Delmas B. Chevalier C. Amyloid assemblies of influenza A virus PB1-F2 protein damage membrane and induce cytotoxicity.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 739-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It is thus possible to assay the presence of PB1-F2 in extracellular fluids such as bronchoalveolar lavages from washings of IAV-infected mice (15Miodek A. Vidic J. Sauriat-Dorizon H. Richard C.A. Le Goffic R. Korri-Youssoufi H. Chevalier C. Electrochemical detection of the oligomerization of PB1-F2 influenza A virus protein in infected cells.Anal. Chem. 2014; 86: 9098-9105Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a report demonstrated the propensity of the aggregated form of PB1-F2 to activate the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome pathway extracellularly (19McAuley J.L. Tate M.D. MacKenzie-Kludas C.J. Pinar A. Zeng W. Stutz A. Latz E. Brown L.E. Mansell A. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by IAV virulence protein PB1-F2 contributes to severe pathophysiology and disease.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9e1003392Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In contrast, the accumulation of soluble oligomers at the mitochondrial membrane suppresses retinoic acid-inducible gene I protein and NLRP3 signaling pathways (20Yoshizumi T. Ichinohe T. Sasaki O. Otera H. Kawabata S. Mihara K. Koshiba T. Influenza A virus protein PB1-F2 translocates into mitochondria via Tom40 channels and impairs innate immunity.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4713Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In fact, the soluble form of PB1-F2 is able to interact with the Calcoco2 protein leading to modulation of the nature of the innate immune response (21Leymarie O. Meyer L. Tafforeau L. Lotteau V. Costa B.D. Delmas B. Chevalier C. Le Goffic R. Influenza virus protein PB1-F2 interacts with CALCOCO2 (NDP52) to modulate innate immune response.J. Gen. Virol. 2017; 98: 1196-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, PB1-F2 molecular structure and virulence seem to be correlated. However, the putative role of PB1-F2 amyloid aggregates in the pathogenicity of IAV remains unclear, and new techniques are required to study them properly in the viral context.In the present work, we harnessed synchrotron UV and IR beamlines to characterize PB1-F2 structures directly within the lungs of infected mice. Using synchrotron-coupled deep UV (sDUV) fluorescence microscopy and taking advantage of the high content of tryptophan (Trp) residues in the PB1-F2 sequence (5/90 amino acids), we correlated the increase of the autofluorescent signal recorded in IAV-infected cells with the synchrotron-coupled Fourier-transform IR (sFT-IR) detection of β-aggregates, as previously demonstrated at the single-cell level (22Chevalier C. Le Goffic R. Jamme F. Leymarie O. Refregiers M. Delmas B.

Chem. 2016; 291: 9060-9072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Mice were infected with a WT IAV and its PB1-F2 knockout mutant (ΔF2) and were monitored at different times postinfection (p.i.). IR spectra were recorded in the regions of interest (ROIs) identified using sDUV microscopy and subjected to multivariate analysis revealing the presence of β-aggregated structures in mice infected with PB1-F2–expressing IAV. Finally, by delivering recombinant PB1-F2 protein within the lungs of mice, we characterized the PB1-F2 proinflammatory properties and the epithelial damages it provoked in a virus-free context. These damages profoundly alter the respiratory capacities of infected hosts and therefore emphasize the role of PB1-F2 as an important virulence factor of IAVs. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time the tight correlation between the supramolecular structure of PB1-F2 and its associated pathogenicity in mammalian hosts.ResultsMapping of PB1-F2 within the lung architecturePB1-F2 is known to increase pathogenesis of IAV through exacerbation of the inflammatory processes induced by the infection (5McAuley J.L.

PB1-F2 proteins from H5N1 and 20 century pandemic influenza viruses cause immunopathology.PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6e1001014Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that because of its propensity to oligomerize and damage cellular membranes, PB1-F2 could induce cytotoxicity and locally impair tissue structure integrity leading to an exacerbation of inflammation. We have previously monitored the impact of PB1-F2 upon infection using sFT-IR and sDUV fluorescence microscopies at the single-cell level (22Chevalier C. Le Goffic R. Jamme F. Leymarie O. Refregiers M. Delmas B. Synchrotron infrared and deep UV fluorescent microspectroscopy study of PB1-F2 beta-aggregated structures in influenza A virus-infected cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 9060-9072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Taking advantage of the high content of Trp amino acid in the PB1-F2 sequence (5/90, i.e., 5.5% of the residues), we have previously shown that the increase of the Trp autofluorescence signal is correlated with the presence of PB1-F2 β-aggregated structures in a cell-type–dependent and time-dependent manner. Given that Trp frequency is estimated to be 1.3% in vertebrate proteins (24Kozlowski L.P. Proteome-pI: Proteome isoelectric point database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45: D1112-D1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), we decided to apply this method in order to finely map PB1-F2 aggregated structures in the lungs of IAV-infected mice. To this end, we compared mock-infected mice with mice infected with 1 × 106 PFU of WT A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) virus or with its mutant unable to express PB1-F2 (ΔF2). Mice were euthanized at days 1, 2, and 3 p.i., and lungs were embedded with paraformaldehyde and cut into 8 μm-thick cryosections. sDUV fluorescence of the three sample types was then compared at day 1 and 2 p.i. (Fig. 1). The Trp fluorescence emission intensity was quantified and normalized to the studied area using the 3D surface plot plugin (ImageJ; https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/disclaimer.html). When compared with mock-infected mice, a clear increase of fluorescence was observed into WT IAV-infected mice cryosections and localized within the vicinity of bronchioles, which are known to be a major site of IAV infection (6Le Goffic R. Leymarie O. Chevalier C. Rebours E. Da Costa B. Vidic J. Descamps D. Sallenave J.M. Rauch M. Samson M. Delmas B. Transcriptomic analysis of host immune and cell death responses associated with the influenza A virus PB1-F2 protein.PLoS Pathog. 2011; 7e1002202Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This increase of Trp autofluorescence was measured to a lesser extent in ΔF2-infected mice. Thus, sDUV microscopy allowed us to scan the whole surface of the slice of IAV-infected lungs and determine the ROI submitted subsequently to FT-IR microspectroscopic analysis in an attempt to detect the presence of β-aggregated structures. Hence, PB1-F2 appeared to be expressed within bronchioles, and β-aggregated structures are detected at early steps of infection. This feature is known to influence the outcome of the infection (8Vidy A. Maisonnasse P. Da Costa B. Delmas B. Chevalier C. Le Goffic R. The influenza virus protein PB1-F2 increases viral pathogenesis through neutrophil recruitment and NK cells inhibition.PLoS One. 2016; 11e0165361Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), suggesting that PB1-F2 could alter the tracheobronchial functions at the beginning of infection.PB1-F2 expression is associated with β-aggregated structures within infected bronchiolesPreviously, we used multivariable statistical data analysis applied to sFT-IR spectroscopy to detect PB1-F2 β-aggregated structures at the single-cell level in IAV-infected cells (22Chevalier C. Le Goffic R. Jamme F. Leymarie O. Refregiers M. Delmas B.

Chem. 2016; 291: 9060-9072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A specific signature corresponding to PB1-F2–aggregated amyloid-like fibers was defined in a cell-type–dependent and time-dependent manner. In this study, we applied the aforementioned method to investigate the presence of PB1-F2 β-aggregated structures in the lungs of IAV-infected mice expressing PB1-F2 within the bronchioles displaying the highest level of Trp fluorescence by sDUV microscopy. Using the serial cryosections previously mapped and analyzed by sDUV microscopy, we randomly acquired sFT-IR spectra within the bronchioles following straight lines from the outside (i.e., the lumen) to the inside of the tissue (cells composing the bronchiole and intra-alveolar space). FT-IR spectra were processed as previously described, analyzed by principal component (PC) analysis, and represented as score plots and loading plots (22Chevalier C. Le Goffic R. Jamme F. Leymarie O. Refregiers M. Delmas B. Synchrotron infrared and deep UV fluorescent microspectroscopy study of PB1-F2 beta-aggregated structures in influenza A virus-infected cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 9060-9072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Score plots (Fig. 2, A and C and Fig. S1A) enable us to plot the data in a form where each FT-IR spectrum is represented as a single point in a relevant space (PC). Then, loading plots (Fig. 2B and Fig. S1B) permit to enlighten the correlation between the variables (wave number values) and determine to what extent a variable is influencing the model of study (herein, IR signature of IAV-infected bronchioles). Finally, we localized each spectrum of interest on the bright field image of the studied bronchiole with a color code corresponding to the score calculated for each spectrum by the multivariate analysis (Fig. 2, D and E and Fig. S1C; maps of ΔF2-infected mice are presented in Fig. S2). FT-IR is a classical method to study the folding/unfolding and aggregation of proteins in particular, thanks to the amide I region (1715–1575 cm−1), which is very sensitive to protein secondary structure (22Chevalier C. Le Goffic R. Jamme F. Leymarie O. Refregiers M. Delmas B.

Evaluation of the information content in infrared spectra for protein secondary structure determination.Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 2946-2957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Thus, we paid special attention to this region of the spectrum, which allows us to discriminate between different types of β-sheet structure signatures (27Zandomeneghi G. Krebs M.R. McCammon M.G. Fandrich M. FTIR reveals structural differences between native beta-sheet proteins and amyloid fibrils.Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 3314-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Figure 2 displays the comparison between the secondary structure content of WT and ΔF2-infected mice at day 1 and day 2 p.i. (day 3 is presented in Fig. S1). At day 1, the score plot presented in Figure 2A revealed two independent clusters following the PC2 axis, which represents 31.7% of the total variance. The loading plot associated to PC2 allows us to determine that the main variation in the positive direction of PC2 (associated to WT-infected mice) is mainly because of peak variations with maxima situated at 1632 and 1668 cm−1. The peak at 1632 cm−1 is indicative of amyloid fibrils and aggregates. The second peak at 1668 cm−1 is ascribed to internal random coiled segments (disordered structures) and formation of β-turns. In contrast, the peak corresponding to the main variation in the negative direction of PC2 (associated to ΔF2-infected mice) at 1655 cm−1 is related to α-helical structures (28Movasaghi Z. Rehman S. Rehman I.U. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of biological tissues.Appl. Spectrosc. Rev. 2008; 43: 134-179Crossref Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Analysis of the spectra recorded at day 2 leads to the same observation: clear discrimination along the PC2 (31.7% of the total variance) axis between WT- and ΔF2-infected mice although the clusters are partially overlapping compared with day 1 (Fig. 2C). The two same main peaks were observed at 1633 and 1668 cm−1 in the positive values, and one peak at 1655 cm−1 was observed in the negative values of PC2 (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, a third peak appeared at 1691 cm−1 associated with WT-infected mice. The peak at 1691 cm−1 associated with the second peak at 1633 cm−1 is specifically ascribed to aggregated structures such as amyloid aggregates and strengthening the presence of β-aggregated structures in the bronchioles of PB1-F2 expressing–infected mice. This IR signature is similar to the PB1-F2 β−aggregated structures that have been determined at the single-cell level (22Chevalier C. Le Goffic R. Jamme F. Leymarie O. Refregiers M. Delmas B. Synchrotron infrared and deep UV fluorescent microspectroscopy study of PB1-F2 beta-aggregated structures in influenza A virus-infected cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 9060-9072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A similar pattern was observed at day 3 (Fig. S1), although the score plot displays partially overlapping clusters following the PC1 axis (28% of the total variance). The loading plot presented in Fig. S1B indicates a pattern similar to what is observed at day 2, with two peaks at 1630 and 1690 cm−1 in the positive values and one peak at 1659 cm−1 in the negative values. The shift of the minor peak from 1633 to 1630 cm−1 in association with the major peak at 1690 cm−1 is indicative of highly aggregated β-sheet structures in WT-infected mice. In comparison with day 1 and 2, a new peak at 1643 cm−1 was observed at day 3, whereas the peak at 1668 cm−1 disappeared. It is very interesting to note that this domain of the spectrum (1630–1643 cm−1) is generally ascribed to native β-sheet structures, suggesting a phenomenon of accumulation of such structures in a time-dependent manner.Figure 2Synchrotron FT-IR microspectroscopic cartography of secondary structures content of WT and ΔF2-infected IAV-infected lung slices at day 1 and day 2 p.i. within the amide I region. The second-derivative IR spectra were analyzed by applying PCA. A and C, score plots of principal component (PC) analysis from the 1700 to 1600 cm−1 band IR spectra. The explained variance for PC2 is 31.68% at day 1 (A) and 31.74% at day 2 (C).

At day 2, the same tendency is observed: WT and F2 groups are separated along PC2 and characterized by the two peaks present at day 1: 1633 and 1668 cm−1.

Such evidence is primarily drawn from mouse knockout studies and suggests GPR17 as a potential novel therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic diseases. However, links between human GPR17 genetic variants, downstream cellular signaling, and metabolic diseases have yet to be reported. Here, we analyzed GPR17 coding sequences from control and disease cohorts consisting of individuals with adverse clinical metabolic deficits including severe insulin resistance, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity. We identified 18 nonsynonymous GPR17 variants, including eight variants that were exclusive to the disease cohort. We characterized the protein expression levels, membrane localization, and downstream signaling profiles of nine GPR17 variants (F43L, V96M, V103M, D105N, A131T, G136S, R248Q, R301H, and G354V). These nine GPR17 variants had similar protein expression and subcellular localization as wild-type GPR17; however, they showed diverse downstream signaling profiles. GPR17-G136S lost the capacity for agonist-mediated cAMP, Ca2+, and β-arrestin signaling. GPR17-V96M retained cAMP inhibition similar to GPR17-WT, but showed impaired Ca2+ and β-arrestin signaling. GPR17-D105N displayed impaired cAMP and Ca2+ signaling, but unaffected agonist-stimulated β-arrestin recruitment. The identification and functional profiling of naturally occurring human GPR17 variants from individuals with metabolic diseases revealed receptor variants with diverse signaling profiles, including differential signaling perturbations that resulted in GPCR signaling bias. Our findings provide a framework for structure-function relationship studies of GPR17 signaling and metabolic disease."
https://openalex.org/W3172437858,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system maintains protein homoeostasis, underpins the cell cycle, and is dysregulated in cancer. However, the role of individual E3 ubiquitin ligases, which mediate the final step in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, remains incompletely understood. Identified through screening for cancer-specific endogenous retroviral transcripts, we show that the little-studied E3 ubiquitin ligase HECTD2 exerts dominant control of tumour progression in melanoma. HECTD2 cell autonomously drives the proliferation of human and murine melanoma cells by accelerating the cell cycle. HECTD2 additionally regulates cancer cell production of immune mediators, initiating multiple immune suppressive pathways, which include the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) pathway. Accordingly, higher HECTD2 expression is associated with weaker anti-tumour immunity and unfavourable outcome of PD-1 blockade in human melanoma and counteracts immunity against a model tumour antigen in murine melanoma. This central, multifaceted role of HECTD2 in cancer cell-autonomous proliferation and in immune evasion may provide a single target for a multipronged therapy of melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W3172484167,"Tourette syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with hyperactivity in dopaminergic networks. Dopaminergic hyperactivity in the basal ganglia has previously been linked to increased sensitivity to positive reinforcement and increases in choice impulsivity. In this study, we examine whether this extends to changes in temporal discounting, where impulsivity is operationalized as an increased preference for smaller-but-sooner over larger-but-later rewards. We assessed intertemporal choice in two studies including nineteen adolescents (age: mean[sd] = 14.21[±2.37], 13 male subjects) and twenty-five adult patients (age: mean[sd] = 29.88 [±9.03]; 19 male subjects) with Tourette syndrome and healthy age- and education matched controls. Computational modeling using exponential and hyperbolic discounting models via hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation revealed reduced temporal discounting in adolescent patients, and no evidence for differences in adult patients. Results are discussed with respect to neural models of temporal discounting, dopaminergic alterations in Tourette syndrome and the developmental trajectory of temporal discounting. Specifically, adolescents might show attenuated discounting due to improved inhibitory functions that also affect choice impulsivity and/or the developmental trajectory of executive control functions. Future studies would benefit from a longitudinal approach to further elucidate the developmental trajectory of these effects."
https://openalex.org/W3167255085,"The maximal power generating capacity of a muscle declines with age and has a negative impact on the performance of daily life activities. As muscle power is the product of force and velocity, we recruited 20 young (10 men, 10 women: 20–31 years) and 20 older (10 men, 10 women: 65–86 years) people to investigate which of these components contributes to the lower power and performance in old age. After determination of the maximal isometric knee extension torque (MVC), they performed a countermovement jump (CMJ) in 1) the normal situation (normal), 2) with an extra load of 15% body weight (loaded) and 3) 15% lower body weight (unloaded with a pulley system), and a timed up-and-go test (TUG) in the normal or loaded condition. The TUG and CMJ performance was lower in old than young participants (p&lt;0.001). Below a critical CMJ peak power of ~23.7 W·kg -1 TUG showed a progressive decrease. The CMJ take-off velocity (V off ) in the normal condition was lower in old than young participants (p&lt;0.001). However, the V off vs . body weight/MVC relationship of the normal, loaded and unloaded data combined was similar in the old and young participants and fitted the Hill equation (R 2 = 0.396). This indicates that 1) only when peak power drops below a critical threshold TUG becomes impaired and 2) there was no evidence for intrinsic slowing of the muscle contractile properties in older people, but rather the older people were working on a slower part of the force-velocity relationship due to weaker muscles."
https://openalex.org/W3171157041,"Liver fibrosis is a common characteristic of chronic liver diseases. The activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) plays a key role in fibrogenesis in response to liver injury, yet the mechanism by which damaged hepatocytes modulate the activation of HSCs is poorly understood. Our previous studies have established that liver-specific deletion of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT)leads to hepatocyte necroptosis and spontaneous fibrosis. Here, we report that OGT-deficient hepatocytes secrete trefoil factor 2 (TFF2) that activates HSCs and contributes to the fibrogenic process. The expression and secretion of TFF2 are induced in OGT-deficient hepatocytes but not in WT hepatocytes. TFF2 activates the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta signaling pathway that promotes the proliferation and migration of primary HSCs. TFF2 protein expression is elevated in mice with carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury. These findings identify TFF2 as a novel factor that mediates intercellular signaling between hepatocytes and HSCs and suggest a role of the hepatic OGT–TFF2 axis in the process of fibrogenesis. Liver fibrosis is a common characteristic of chronic liver diseases. The activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) plays a key role in fibrogenesis in response to liver injury, yet the mechanism by which damaged hepatocytes modulate the activation of HSCs is poorly understood. Our previous studies have established that liver-specific deletion of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT)leads to hepatocyte necroptosis and spontaneous fibrosis. Here, we report that OGT-deficient hepatocytes secrete trefoil factor 2 (TFF2) that activates HSCs and contributes to the fibrogenic process. The expression and secretion of TFF2 are induced in OGT-deficient hepatocytes but not in WT hepatocytes. TFF2 activates the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta signaling pathway that promotes the proliferation and migration of primary HSCs. TFF2 protein expression is elevated in mice with carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury. These findings identify TFF2 as a novel factor that mediates intercellular signaling between hepatocytes and HSCs and suggest a role of the hepatic OGT–TFF2 axis in the process of fibrogenesis. Chronic liver diseases affect more than 1.5 billion patients worldwide (1Asrani S.K. Devarbhavi H. Eaton J. Kamath P.S. Burden of liver diseases in the world.J. Hepatol. 2019; 70: 151-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). Without proper intervention, chronic liver diseases progress to liver cancer, which is the global leading cause of cancer mortality. Liver fibrosis is the common pathological outcome regardless of the etiology of liver diseases and also a critical determinant for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (2O'Rourke J.M. Sagar V.M. Shah T. Shetty S. Carcinogenesis on the background of liver fibrosis: Implications for the management of hepatocellular cancer.World J. Gastroenterol. 2018; 24: 4436-4447Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Liver fibrosis is reversible if the primary cause of the liver injury is removed or limited. However, no Food and Drug Administration–approved drug is available for liver fibrosis per se. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the hepatic fibrogenesis is critical for the identification of novel drug targets and the development of therapies. Liver fibrosis is defined by excessive deposition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the tissue. The hepatic stellate cell (HSC) is the major cell type that contributes to liver fibrogenesis. Activated HSCs transdifferentiate from quiescent, fat-storing cells into proliferative myofibroblasts, which is marked by the loss of lipid droplets and the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) (3Friedman S.L. Hepatic stellate cells: Protean, multifunctional, and enigmatic cells of the liver.Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 125-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). Activated HSCs show increased proliferation, chemotaxis, and contractility, as well as synthesis and secretion of the ECM. Lineage-tracing experiments in several animal models of liver fibrosis have shown that HSCs are the primary source of ECM production (4Mederacke I. Hsu C.C. Troeger J.S. Huebener P. Mu X. Dapito D.H. Pradere J.P. Schwabe R.F. Fate tracing reveals hepatic stellate cells as dominant contributors to liver fibrosis independent of its aetiology.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). In contrast, HSC apoptosis and senescence promote the resolution of liver fibrosis (5Kendall T.J. Hennedige S. Aucott R.L. Hartland S.N. Vernon M.A. Benyon R.C.

Senescence of activated stellate cells limits liver fibrosis.Cell. 2008; 134: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). Therefore, investigating the mechanisms for the activation of HSCs may hold the key to treat liver fibrosis. The crosstalk between hepatocytes and nonparenchymal cells is an emerging paradigm in the pathogenesis of liver diseases. Located along the sinusoids of the liver, the spread and elongated morphology of HSCs allows them to make contact with both hepatocytes and endothelial cells (7Wake K. Hepatic stellate cells: Three-dimensional structure, localization, heterogeneity and development.Proc. Jpn. Acad. Ser. B Phys. Biol. Sci. 2006; 82: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, our current knowledge of how paracrine factors released from damaged hepatocytes affect HSCs remains very limited, and the contribution of the hepatocyte–HSC crosstalk to liver fibrogenesis is unknown.

Although over 1000 targets have been identified for O-GlcNAc modification, only one pair of enzymes is responsible for the attachment and removal of this modification. O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) adds O-GlcNAc to serine or threonine residues on proteins, and O-GlcNAcase removes this sugar moiety. Maintaining optimal O-GlcNAcylation levels in the liver has been found to be important for liver metabolism and tissue homeostasis (12Housley M.P. Udeshi N.D. Rodgers J.T. Shabanowitz J.

The nutrient-dependent O-GlcNAc modification controls the expression of liver fatty acid synthase.J. Mol. Biol. 2016; 428: 3295-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Previously, we have discovered that deletion of OGT in hepatocytes leads to necroptotic cell death (21Zhang B. Li M.D. Yin R. Liu Y. Yang Y. Mitchell-Richards K.A. Nam J.H. Li R. Wang L. Iwakiri Y. Chung D. Robert M.E. Ehrlich B.E. Bennett A.M. Yu J. et al.O-GlcNAc transferase suppresses necroptosis and liver fibrosis.JCI Insight. 2019; 4e127709Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Mice lacking OGT in hepatocytes spontaneously develop liver fibrosis, which could only be partially attributed to hepatocyte necroptosis. Here, we report that the HSCs from liver-specific OGT KO (OGT-LKO) mice are activated by a novel secreted factor trefoil factor 2 (TFF2). TFF2 activates PDGFRβ signaling and promotes the proliferation and migration of HSCs. TFF2 is also increased in mice with liver injury, which indicates a potential role in the pathogenesis of liver diseases. We generated OGT-LKO mice by crossing Albumin-Cre; OgtF/Y mice with OgtF/F mice to specifically delete OGT in hepatocytes (Fig. 1, A and B). We reported that OGT-deficient hepatocytes undergo excessive necroptosis that contributes to liver fibrogenesis in these mice (21Zhang B. Li M.D. Yin R. Liu Y. Yang Y. Mitchell-Richards K.A. Nam J.H. Li R. Wang L. Iwakiri Y. Chung D. Robert M.E. Ehrlich B.E. Bennett A.M. Yu J. et al.O-GlcNAc transferase suppresses necroptosis and liver fibrosis.JCI Insight. 2019; 4e127709Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We observed extensive Sirius Red–positive stains in 8-week-old OGT-LKO mouse liver sections, which confirmed the spontaneous development of liver fibrosis in these mice (Fig. 1, C and D). The expression of αSMA is a hallmark of the transdifferentiation of quiescent HSCs to the activated fibroblasts. Immunofluorescence staining of liver sections showed that αSMA is highly expressed in livers of 4-week-old OGT-LKO mice but not WT mice (Fig. 2, A and B). To further characterize HSCs from OGT-LKO mice, we isolated primary HSCs from WT and OGT-LKO livers. Quiescent HSCs are the major sites in the liver that stores retinoids and their metabolites in the form of lipid droplets (22Wake K. “Sternzellen” in the liver: Perisinusoidal cells with special reference to storage of vitamin A.Am. J. Anat. 1971; 132: 429-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Multiple lipid droplets were presented in freshly isolated HSCs from WT livers as demonstrated by the BODIPY staining (Fig. 2C). In contrast, primary HSCs from OGT-LKO mice showed a significant decrease in the lipid content, indicating the transdifferentiation of HSCs into fibroblasts (Fig. 2C) (23Hautekeete M.L. Geerts A. The hepatic stellate (ito) cell: Its role in human liver disease.Virchows Arch. 1997; 430: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In agreement with these findings, mRNA levels of a battery of fibrogenic genes were elevated in primary HSCs from OGT-LKO mice (Fig. 2D). These results demonstrate that OGT deletion in hepatocytes promotes the transdifferentiation and activation of HSCs.Figure 2Primary HSCs are activated in OGT-LKO mice.

The silver staining of these secreted proteins showed different patterns between WT and OGT-LKO primary hepatocytes (Fig. 3A). We therefore hypothesized that changes in these secreted proteins would affect the status of HSCs. To test this hypothesis, we treated primary HSCs and LX-2 cells (an immortalized human stellate cell line) with the conditioned medium harvested from WT and OGT-deficient hepatocytes for 16 h (Fig. 3B) (24Xu L. Hui A.Y. Albanis E. Arthur M.J. O'Byrne S.M. Blaner W.S. Mukherjee P. Friedman S.L. Eng F.J. Human hepatic stellate cell lines, LX-1 and LX-2: New tools for analysis of hepatic fibrosis.Gut. 2005; 54: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). The expression of key fibrogenic genes, Acta2 and Col1a1, was significantly increased in both primary HSCs and LX-2 cells treated with the OGT-deficient hepatocyte-conditioned medium compared with those treated with the WT hepatocyte-conditioned medium (Fig. 3, C and D). The immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that the αSMA protein level was increased in primary HSCs treated with the OGT-deficient hepatocyte-conditioned medium (Fig. 3, E and F). These results demonstrate that proteins secreted from OGT-deficient hepatocytes can induce the activation of HSCs. To identify potential candidates in the conditioned medium that mediate the effect on HSC activation, we re-examined the RNA-sequencing data of the OGT-LKO livers (21Zhang B. Li M.D. Yin R. Liu Y. Yang Y. Mitchell-Richards K.A. Nam J.H. Li R. Wang L. Iwakiri Y. Chung D. Robert M.E. Ehrlich B.E. Bennett A.M. Yu J. et al.O-GlcNAc transferase suppresses necroptosis and liver fibrosis.JCI Insight. 2019; 4e127709Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A variety of genes that encode secreted proteins were differently expressed in WT and OGT-LKO livers (Fig. 4A). To identify secreted factors that may mediate the crosstalk between hepatocytes and HSCs, we chose Tff2, Bmp8b, and Gpnmb for the initial validation. These factors were chosen because they were upregulated in OGT-LKO livers and highly relevant to the pathogenesis of chronic liver diseases based on the analysis of the Gene Expression Omnibus database. We found that the mRNA levels of all three candidates were increased in OGT-LKO primary hepatocytes and livers, confirming the cell-autonomous upregulation of these genes in OGT-deficient hepatocytes (Fig. 4, B–D). To test whether the increase in these gene transcripts results in elevated secretion of the corresponding proteins, we analyzed the protein extracts from the WT and OGT-LKO hepatocyte-conditioned medium. We found that TFF2 but not BMP8b and GPNMB was present in the OGT-LKO hepatocyte-conditioned medium (Fig. 4E). Immunofluorescence staining of primary hepatocytes further demonstrated the expression of TFF2 protein in OGT-LKO but not WT hepatocytes (Fig. 4F). There are three members in the TFF family: Tff1, Tff2, and Tff3 (25Thim L. A new family of growth factor-like peptides. 'Trefoil' disulphide loop structures as a common feature in breast cancer associated peptide (pS2), pancreatic spasmolytic polypeptide (PSP), and frog skin peptides (spasmolysins).FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We found no significant changes in Tff1 and Tff3 mRNA levels in OGT-LKO hepatocytes, indicating the specificity of increased Tff2 transcription in response to Ogt deletion (Fig. 4, G and H). In summary, these results show that OGT deficiency in hepatocytes induces the expression and secretion of TFF2. To investigate whether secreted TFF2 might mediate the crosstalk between hepatocytes and HSCs, we treated freshly isolated primary HSCs with recombinant TFF2. Activated HSCs demonstrate the increased capability to proliferate and migrate (3Friedman S.L. Hepatic stellate cells: Protean, multifunctional, and enigmatic cells of the liver.Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 125-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). We found that TFF2 treatment promoted the proliferation of primary HSCs compared with the control group (Fig. 5A). To determine whether this effect is specific to HSCs, we also treated primary hepatocytes with recombinant TFF2 and observed no difference in the cell number compared with the control group (Fig. 5B). We further tested the effect of TFF2 on LX-2 cells and found that TFF2 increased the proliferation of these human stellate cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C). We then examined whether TFF2 can affect HSC migration with a modified Boyden chamber (Fig. 5D). Transforming growth factor beta was used as a positive control in the assay. With TFF2 treatment, more cells were migrated to the lower membrane in the Boyden chamber (Fig. 5, E and F). Similarly, TFF2 facilitated the migration of LX-2 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5G). Taken together, these results indicate that secreted TFF2 promotes the proliferation and migration of HSCs. We next sought to dissect the signaling pathways mediated by TFF2 in the activation of HSCs. Previous research demonstrated that the activation of the PDGFRβ signaling pathway governs the proliferation and migration of HSCs (26Higashi T. Friedman S.L. Hoshida Y. Hepatic stellate cells as key target in liver fibrosis.Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2017; 121: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). We examined whether TFF2 can activate the PDGFRβ signaling pathway in primary HSCs. Immunofluorescence staining of cells treated with recombinant TFF2 or PDGF-bb for 10 min showed a marked increase in phospho-PDGFRβ but not total PDGFRβ protein levels, which indicated the activation of the PDGFRβ signaling (Fig. 6, A and B). Protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) signaling pathways are downstream of PDGFRβ activation. We found that TFF2 treatment increased the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK in primary HSCs in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6, C and D). These results together indicate that TFF2 exerts its effect on HSC proliferation and migration at least partially through the PDGFRβ signaling pathway. TFF2 has been shown to be a poor prognostic marker for gastric cancer (27Dhar D.K. Wang T.C. Maruyama R. Udagawa J. Kubota H. Fuji T. Tachibana M. Ono T. Otani H. Nagasue N. Expression of cytoplasmic TFF2 is a marker of tumor metastasis and negative prognostic factor in gastric cancer.Lab. Invest. 2003; 83: 1343-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We probed the cancer genome atlas database and found a similar trend in HCC: patients with higher expression of Tff2 showed a lower survival rate (Fig. 7A). Because liver fibrosis is highly correlated to the development of HCC, we ask whether TFF2 is involved in the progression of liver diseases. To test the potential role of TFF2 in the mouse model of liver injury, we induced an acute liver injury by injecting carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) to C57BL/6J mice for 1 week (28Kocabayoglu P. Lade A. Lee Y.A. Dragomir A.C. Sun X. Fiel M.I. Thung S. Aloman C. Soriano P. Hoshida Y. Friedman S.L. Beta-PDGF receptor expressed by hepatic stellate cells regulates fibrosis in murine liver injury, but not carcinogenesis.J. Hepatol. 2015; 63: 141-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The fibrogenic program was initiated in CCl4-treated mice as demonstrated by increased mRNA expression of major fibrogenic genes (Fig. 7B). We found that TFF2 protein expression was increased in CCl4-treated mice along with the increased levels of αSMA and phospho-PDGFRβ proteins (Fig. 7, C and D). Immunohistochemistry staining of livers from mice injected with CCl4 for 3 weeks also showed higher expression of TFF2 than that from vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 7E). These results indicate a strong association between TFF2 expression and the early stage of liver fibrosis in these mice. Hepatocytes show a remarkable capability to synthesize and secrete proteins that mediate intercellular and interorgan crosstalk. Changes in the intercellular crosstalk are observed in various liver pathological conditions, which indicate the critical role of this signaling network in the pathogenesis of liver diseases. Here, we report that TFF2, a novel secreted factor from OGT-deficient necroptotic hepatocytes, induced the activation of HSCs (Fig. 7F). We found that TFF2 promoted HSC proliferation and migration at least partially through the activation of PDGFRβ signaling. TFF2 was increased in mice with CCl4-induced liver injury. Given that liver injury triggers the development of HCC, these findings could potentially provide an explanation for the poor prognosis of HCC patients with a higher Tff2 mRNA level and suggest that TFF2 may serve as a biomarker for early detection of liver injury. The role of TFFs has not been understood in the liver until very recently. TFFs are broadly expressed in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, liver, pancreas, kidney, and brain (29Hertel S.C. Chwieralski C.E. Hinz M. Rio M.C. Tomasetto C. Hoffmann W. Profiling trefoil factor family (TFF) expression in the mouse: Identification of an antisense TFF1-related transcript in the kidney and liver.Peptides. 2004; 25: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Previous research on TFFs focused on their roles in the GI tract. Injured intestinal epithelial cells release TFFs, which promote cell proliferation and migration to restore the mucosal integrity of the GI tract (30Aihara E. Engevik K.A. Montrose M.H. Trefoil factor peptides and gastrointestinal function.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2017; 79: 357-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our re-examination of the RNA-sequencing data from intestinal epithelial cell–specific OGT KO mice showed the increased expression of Tff2 transcripts (31Zhao M. Xiong X. Ren K. Xu B. Cheng M. Sahu C. Wu K. Nie Y. Huang Z. Blumberg R.S. Han X. Ruan H.B. Deficiency in intestinal epithelial O-GlcNAcylation predisposes to gut inflammation.EMBO Mol. Med. 2018; 10e8736Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This result indicates that OGT may regulate Tff2 expression in different types of cells through an unknown yet conserved mechanism. One possible mechanism is that OGT regulates Tff2 gene transcription. It has been well established that OGT can suppress gene expression through direct or indirect interaction with the promoter of its target (32Yang X. Qian K. Protein O-GlcNAcylation: Emerging mechanisms and functions.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18: 452-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). A recent study reported that O-GlcNAcylation of FOXA2 suppressed its transcriptional activity and decreased the expression of FOXA2 target genes in various liver cell lines (33Huang H. Wu Q. Guo X. Huang T. Xie X. Wang L. Liu Y. Shi L. Li W. Zhang J. Liu Y. O-GlcNAcylation promotes the migratory ability of hepatocellular carcinoma cells via regulating FOXA2 stability and transcriptional activity.J. Cell Physiol. 2021; https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.30385Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). FOXA2 is predicted to bind to the promoter region of Tff2 (34Wederell E.D. Bilenky M. Cullum R. Thiessen N. Dagpinar M. Delaney A. Varhol R. Zhao Y. Zeng T. Bernier B. Ingham M. Hirst M. Robertson G.

It is possible that the deletion of OGT in the liver or GI epithelial cells releases the inhibition of FOXA2 transcriptional activity and thus increases the gene expression of Tff2. Hepatic TFF1 expression is increased in patients with hepatectomy, hepatolithiasis, cholangiocarcinoma, and HCC (35Sasaki M. Tsuneyama K. Nakanuma Y.

It has also been shown that TFF3 is involved in hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism (39Xue Y. Shen L. Cui Y. Zhang H. Chen Q. Cui A. Fang F. Chang Y.

However, the role of TFF2 is unknown in the liver. Our results reveal that TFF2, expressed and secreted by damaged hepatocytes, mediates the crosstalk between hepatocytes and HSCs. We found increased TFF2 expression in mice with CCl4-induced liver injury. Consistently, Tff2 mRNA expression is also increased in a mouse model of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis fibrosis (43Tsuchida T. Lee Y.A. Fujiwara N. Ybanez M. Allen B. Martins S. Fiel M.I. Goossens N.

These results suggest that TFF2 could potentially serve as a biomarker for chronic liver disease. Whether TFF2 represents a general marker for hepatic stress response or a specific modulator under certain pathological conditions is a question that remains to be answered. Future research will be needed to determine whether TFF2 could be detected in the circulation and whether neutralizing TFF2 would ameliorate liver fibrosis in different models of liver injury. In"

However, less information is available on the microbiomes associated with low water activity foods. Pine nuts and sesame seeds, and food products which contain these ingredients, have been associated with recalls due to contamination with bacterial foodborne pathogens. The objective of this study was to identify the microbial community of pine nuts and sesame seeds using targeted 16S rRNA sequencing technology. Ten different brands of each seed type were assessed, and core microbiomes were determined. A total of 21 and 16 unique taxa with proportional abundances >1% in at least one brand were identified in the pine nuts and sesame seeds, respectively. Members of the core pine nut microbiome included the genera Alishewanella, Aminivibrio, Mycoplasma, Streptococcus, and unassigned OTUs in the families of Desulfobacteraceae and Xanthomonadaceae. For sesame seeds, the core microbiome included Aminivibrio, Chryseolina, Okibacterium, and unassigned OTUs in the family Flavobacteriaceae. The microbiomes of these seeds revealed that these products are dominated by environmental bacterial genera commonly isolated from soil, water, and plants; bacterial genera containing species known as commensal organisms were also identified. Understanding these microbiomes can aid in the risk assessment of these products by identifying food spoilage potential and community members which may co-enrich with foodborne bacterial pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W3174827034,"Background Nondaily smoking has been on the rise, especially in Mexico. While Mexico has strengthened its tobacco control policies, their effects on nondaily smokers have gone largely unexamined. We developed a simulation model to estimate the impact of tobacco control policies on daily and nondaily smoking in Mexico. Methods A previously validated Mexico SimSmoke model that estimated overall trends in smoking prevalence from 2002 through 2013 was extended to 2018 and adapted to distinguish daily and nondaily smoking prevalence. The model was then validated using data from Mexican surveys through 2016. To gauge the potential effects of policies, we compared the trends in smoking under current policies with trends from policies kept at their 2002 levels. Results Between 2002 and 2016, Mexico SimSmoke underestimated the reduction in male and female daily smoking rates. For nondaily smoking, SimSmoke predicted a decline among both males and females, while survey rates showed increasing rates in both genders, primarily among ages 15–44. Of the total reduction in smoking rates predicted by the model by 2018, tax policies account for more than 55%, followed by health warnings, cessation treatment, smoke-free air laws, and tobacco control spending. Conclusions Although Mexico SimSmoke did not successfully explain trends in daily and nondaily smoking, it helps to identify gaps in surveillance and policy evaluation for nondaily smokers. Future research should consider appropriate measures of nondaily smoking prevalence, trajectories between daily and nondaily smoking, and the separate impact of tobacco control policies on each group."
https://openalex.org/W3177371562,"The following paper explores the link between production difficulty and grammatical variability. Using a sub-sample of the Switchboard Corpus of American English (285 transcripts, 34 speakers), this paper shows that the presence of variable contexts does not positively correlate with two metrics of production difficulty, namely filled pauses (um and uh) and unfilled pauses (speech planning time). When 20 morphosyntactic variables are considered collectively (N= 6,268), there is no positive effect. In other words, variable contexts do not correlate with measurable production difficulties. These results challenge the view that grammatical variability is somehow sub-optimal for speakers, with additional burdensome cognitive planning."
https://openalex.org/W3171479211,"In this paper, we seek to identify the existing conceptualisations and applications of social capital contained in the literature, as well as how these are used and combined across and within research fields. Our analytical approach presents a unique combination of topic models and bipartite blockmodelling, enabling us to analyse both the content and structures of a large collection of academic texts. In particular, this allows us to: (a) summarise the content in relation to a variety of topics; and (b) uncover the structure, with diverse text subsets engaging differently with these topics. Our analysis of all of the 11,975 articles on Web of Science that address 'social capital' demonstrates that these can be reduced to nine distinct topic clusters and six article clusters. Specifically, we identify the multifaceted nature of the social-capital metaphor and show that there are clear variations in how it is deployed in different bodies of literature. Finally, by mapping the diverse conceptualisations and applications of social capital in a network, we propose a tool for identifying future research opportunities for those interested in novel social-capital treatments in their field."
https://openalex.org/W3171528997,"Previous studies have reported conflicting results for the effect of overall treatment time with stereotactic body radiotherapy on tumor control in early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer. To examine this effect, we conducted a propensity score-weighted, retrospective, observational study at a single institution. We analyzed the data of 200 patients with early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer who underwent stereotactic body radiotherapy (48 Gy in 4 fractions) at our institution between January 2007 and October 2013. Patients were grouped into consecutive (overall treatment time = 4-5 days, n = 116) or non-consecutive treatment groups (overall treatment time = 6-10 days, n = 84). The outcomes of interest were local control and overall survival. The Cox regression model was used with propensity score and inverse probability of treatment weighting. The median overall treatment times in the consecutive and non-consecutive groups were 4 and 6 days, respectively. The 5-year local control and overall survival rates in the consecutive vs. the non-consecutive group were 86.3 vs. 77.2% and 55.5 vs. 51.8%, respectively. After propensity score weighting, consecutive stereotactic body radiotherapy was associated with positive local control (adjusted hazard ratio 0.30, 95% confidence interval 0.14-0.65; p = 0.002) and overall survival (adjusted hazard ratio 0.56, 95% confidence interval 0.34-0.91; p = 0.019) benefits. The prolonged overall treatment time of stereotactic body radiotherapy treatment negatively affected the outcomes of patients with early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that in patients with early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer treated with the same dose-fractionation regimen, consecutive stereotactic body radiotherapy has a more beneficial effect on tumor control than non-consecutive stereotactic body radiotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W3173881815,"Entropy is an important index for describing the structure, function, and evolution of network. The existing research on entropy is primarily applied to undirected networks. Compared with an undirected network, a directed network involves a special asymmetric transfer. The research on the entropy of directed networks is very significant to effectively quantify the structural information of the whole network. Typical complex network models include nearest-neighbour coupling network, small-world network, scale-free network, and random network. These network models are abstracted as undirected graphs without considering the direction of node connection. For complex networks, modeling through the direction of network nodes is extremely challenging. In this paper, based on these typical models of complex network, a directed network model considering node connection in-direction is proposed, and the eigenvalue entropies of three matrices in the directed network is defined and studied, where the three matrices are adjacency matrix, in-degree Laplacian matrix and in-degree signless Laplacian matrix. The eigenvalue-based entropies of three matrices are calculated in directed nearest-neighbor coupling, directed small world, directed scale-free and directed random networks. Through the simulation experiment on the real directed network, the result shows that the eigenvalue entropy of the real directed network is between the eigenvalue entropy of directed scale-free network and directed small-world network."
https://openalex.org/W3175174411,"This study aimed to assess the biophysical parameters of the skin in Polish Konik horses (Polish primitive horses). According to the authors, this is the first assessment performed on such a wide scale in this group of animals. The evaluation carried out is innovative both with regards to the breed of the animals and the wide scope of the physicochemical skin assessment. The study group comprised mares, stallions and geldings, and the evaluations concerned transepidermal water loss, corneometry, pH, skin temperature assessment and mexametry. These parameters were assessed in five skin regions: the lips, the right ear, the prosternum, the right side of the neck and the chest. The measurements were taken after spreading the hair apart, with the use of a Multiprobe Adapter System (MPA®) and dedicated probes (Courage + Khazaka electronic GmbH, Cologne, Germany). The measurements revealed statistically significant differences in the values of transepidermal water loss in the lips in mares compared with stallions (P = 0.023) and also in stallions compared with geldings (P = 0.009). Corneometry showed significantly higher results in the neck region in mares compared with stallions (P = 0.037) and the prosternum areas in mares and geldings compared with stallions (P = 0.037 and P = 0.018). Skin pH measurement on the right side of the neck rendered significantly higher values in stallions than in mares (P = 0.037). In geldings, the skin temperature was significantly higher than in stallions (P = 0.049). Once the appropriate physicochemical values for specific animal species and breeds are determined, non-invasive methods of skin examination in many diseases and also methods of evaluation of the efficacy and/or adverse effects of applied medications can be established."
