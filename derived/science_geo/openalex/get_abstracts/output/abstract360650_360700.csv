https://openalex.org/W2074623278,"Sensory experiences exert a powerful influence on the function and future performance of neuronal circuits in the mammalian neocortex1,2,3. Restructuring of synaptic connections is believed to be one mechanism by which cortical circuits store information about the sensory world4,5. Excitatory synaptic structures, such as dendritic spines, are dynamic entities6,7,8 that remain sensitive to alteration of sensory input throughout life6,9. It remains unclear, however, whether structural changes at the level of dendritic spines can outlast the original experience and thereby provide a morphological basis for long-term information storage. Here we follow spine dynamics on apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in functionally defined regions of adult mouse visual cortex during plasticity of eye-specific responses induced by repeated closure of one eye (monocular deprivation). The first monocular deprivation episode doubled the rate of spine formation, thereby increasing spine density. This effect was specific to layer-5 cells located in binocular cortex, where most neurons increase their responsiveness to the non-deprived eye3,10. Restoring binocular vision returned spine dynamics to baseline levels, but absolute spine density remained elevated and many monocular deprivation-induced spines persisted during this period of functional recovery. However, spine addition did not increase again when the same eye was closed for a second time. This absence of structural plasticity stands out against the robust changes of eye-specific responses that occur even faster after repeated deprivation3. Thus, spines added during the first monocular deprivation experience may provide a structural basis for subsequent functional shifts. These results provide a strong link between functional plasticity and specific synaptic rearrangements, revealing a mechanism of how prior experiences could be stored in cortical circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2051731737,"Many complex behaviours, like speech or music, have a hierarchical organization with structure on many timescales, but it is not known how the brain controls the timing of behavioural sequences, or whether different circuits control different timescales of the behaviour. Here we address these issues by using temperature to manipulate the biophysical dynamics in different regions of the songbird forebrain involved in song production. We find that cooling the premotor nucleus HVC (formerly known as the high vocal centre) slows song speed across all timescales by up to 45 per cent but only slightly alters the acoustic structure, whereas cooling the downstream motor nucleus RA (robust nucleus of the arcopallium) has no observable effect on song timing. Our observations suggest that dynamics within HVC are involved in the control of song timing, perhaps through a chain-like organization. Local manipulation of brain temperature should be broadly applicable to the identification of neural circuitry that controls the timing of behavioural sequences and, more generally, to the study of the origin and role of oscillatory and other forms of brain dynamics in neural systems."

A study of the relationship between the oestrogen receptor and ERBB2/HER-2 pathways in breast cancer throws light on the mechanism of tamoxifen action and on the basis of tamoxifen-resistance. The new work shows that Pax2 is required for active repression of ErbB2 in breast cancer and that reduction of Pax2 causes ErbB2-driven tamoxifen-resistant cell growth. Tamoxifen is commonly used for breast cancer therapy. This paper shows that the transcriptional repression of the ERBB2 oncogene by tamoxifen in breast cancer cells is affected by an antagonistic interaction between the transcriptional regulators PAX2 and AIB-1. This affects the ability of tamoxifen to inhibit cancer cell proliferation. The relative levels of PAX2 and AIP1 in breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen correlates with relapse-free survival. Crosstalk between the oestrogen receptor (ER) and ERBB2/HER-2 pathways has long been implicated in breast cancer aetiology and drug response1, yet no direct connection at a transcriptional level has been shown. Here we show that oestrogen–ER and tamoxifen–ER complexes directly repress ERBB2 transcription by means of a cis-regulatory element within the ERBB2 gene in human cell lines. We implicate the paired box 2 gene product (PAX2), in a previously unrecognized role, as a crucial mediator of ER repression of ERBB2 by the anti-cancer drug tamoxifen. We show that PAX2 and the ER co-activator AIB-1/SRC-3 compete for binding and regulation of ERBB2 transcription, the outcome of which determines tamoxifen response in breast cancer cells. The repression of ERBB2 by ER-PAX2 links these two breast cancer subtypes and suggests that aggressive ERBB2-positive tumours can originate from ER-positive luminal tumours by circumventing this repressive mechanism. These data provide mechanistic insight into the molecular basis of endocrine resistance in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1987745928,"Background The CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) is a distinct phenotype associated with microsatellite instability (MSI) and BRAF mutation in colon cancer. Recent investigations have selected 5 promoters (CACNA1G, IGF2, NEUROG1, RUNX3 and SOCS1) as surrogate markers for CIMP-high. However, no study has comprehensively evaluated an expanded set of methylation markers (including these 5 markers) using a large number of tumors, or deciphered the complex clinical and molecular associations with CIMP-high determined by the validated marker panel. Metholodology/Principal Findings DNA methylation at 16 CpG islands [the above 5 plus CDKN2A (p16), CHFR, CRABP1, HIC1, IGFBP3, MGMT, MINT1, MINT31, MLH1, p14 (CDKN2A/ARF) and WRN] was quantified in 904 colorectal cancers by real-time PCR (MethyLight). In unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis, the 5 markers (CACNA1G, IGF2, NEUROG1, RUNX3 and SOCS1), CDKN2A, CRABP1, MINT31, MLH1, p14 and WRN were generally clustered with each other and with MSI and BRAF mutation. KRAS mutation was not clustered with any methylation marker, suggesting its association with a random methylation pattern in CIMP-low tumors. Utilizing the validated CIMP marker panel (including the 5 markers), multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that CIMP-high was independently associated with older age, proximal location, poor differentiation, MSI-high, BRAF mutation, and inversely with LINE-1 hypomethylation and β-catenin (CTNNB1) activation. Mucinous feature, signet ring cells, and p53-negativity were associated with CIMP-high in only univariate analysis. In stratified analyses, the relations of CIMP-high with poor differentiation, KRAS mutation and LINE-1 hypomethylation significantly differed according to MSI status. Conclusions Our study provides valuable data for standardization of the use of CIMP-high-specific methylation markers. CIMP-high is independently associated with clinical and key molecular features in colorectal cancer. Our data also suggest that KRAS mutation is related with a random CpG island methylation pattern which may lead to CIMP-low tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2044898641,"When plants are repeatedly injured their growth is stunted and the size of organs such as leaves is greatly reduced. The basis of this effect is not well-understood however, even though it reduces yield of crops injured by herbivory, and produces dramatic effects exemplified in ornamental bonsai plants. We have investigated the genetic and physiological basis of this “bonsai effect” by repeatedly wounding leaves of the model plant Arabidopsis. This treatment stunted growth by 50% and increased the endogenous content of jasmonate (JA), a growth inhibitor, by seven-fold. Significantly, repeated wounding did not stunt the growth of the leaves of mutants unable to synthesise JA, or unable to respond to JA including coi1, jai3, myc2, but not jar1. The stunted growth did not result from reduced cell size, but resulted instead from reduced cell number, and was associated with reduced expression of CycB1;2. Wounding caused systemic disappearance of constitutively expressed JAZ1::GUS. Wounding also activates plant immunity. We show that a gene, 12-oxo-phytodienoate reductase, which catalyses a step in JA biosynthesis, and which we confirm is not required for defence, is however required for wound-induced stunting. Our data suggest that intermediates in the JA biosynthetic pathway activate defence, but a primary function of wound-induced JA is to stunt growth through the suppression of mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2127494940,"Voltage-activated sodium (Nav) channels are crucial for the generation and propagation of nerve impulses, and as such are widely targeted by toxins and drugs. The four voltage sensors in Nav channels have distinct amino acid sequences, raising fundamental questions about their relative contributions to the function and pharmacology of the channel. Here we use four-fold symmetric voltage-activated potassium (Kv) channels as reporters to examine the contributions of individual S3b–S4 paddle motifs within Nav channel voltage sensors to the kinetics of voltage sensor activation and to forming toxin receptors. Our results uncover binding sites for toxins from tarantula and scorpion venom on each of the four paddle motifs in Nav channels, and reveal how paddle-specific interactions can be used to reshape Nav channel activity. One paddle motif is unique in that it slows voltage sensor activation, and toxins selectively targeting this motif impede Nav channel inactivation. This reporter approach and the principles that emerge will be useful in developing new drugs for treating pain and Nav channelopathies. Nav sodium ion channels in nerve and muscle cells open and close, or 'gate', in response to changes in transmembrane voltage. They are crucial for the production of nerve impulses, and are targets for many toxins and drugs. Unlike voltage-gated K+ channels, made up of four subunits containing identical voltage-sensing domains, Nav channels derive from one gene and contain four non-identical voltage-sensing domains. Bosmans et al. utilized symmetrical K+ channels as 'reporters' to reveal the properties of various Na+ channel voltage sensors transplanted into a K+ channel core. They find that the paddle domain is important for Na+ channel function, and that toxin–paddle interactions are highly specific."
https://openalex.org/W2144439874,"Memory CD8 T cells, generated by natural pathogen exposure or intentional vaccination, protect the host against specific viral infections. It has long been proposed that the number of memory CD8 T cells in the host is inflexible, and that individual cells are constantly competing for limited space. Consequently, vaccines that introduce over-abundant quantities of memory CD8 T cells specific for an agent of interest could have catastrophic consequences for the host by displacing memory CD8 T cells specific for all previous infections. To test this paradigm, we developed a vaccination regimen in mice that introduced as many new long-lived memory CD8 T cells specific for a single vaccine antigen as there were memory CD8 T cells in the host before vaccination. Here we show that, in contrast to expectations, the size of the memory CD8 T-cell compartment doubled to accommodate these new cells, a change due solely to the addition of effector memory CD8 T cells. This increase did not affect the number of CD4 T cells, B cells or naive CD8 T cells, and pre-existing memory CD8 T cells specific for a previously encountered infection were largely preserved. Thus, the number of effector memory CD8 T cells in the mammalian host adapts according to immunological experience. Developing vaccines that abundantly introduce new memory CD8 T cells should not necessarily ablate pre-existing immunity to other infections."
https://openalex.org/W2000325349,"Increased nuclear protein O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine glycosylation (O-GlcNAcylation) mediated by high glucose treatment or the hyperglycemia of diabetes mellitus contributes to cardiac myocyte dysfunction. However, whether mitochondrial proteins in cardiac myocytes are also submitted to O-GlcNAcylation or excessive O-GlcNAcylation alters mitochondrial function is unknown. In this study, we determined if mitochondrial proteins are O-GlcNAcylated and explored if increased O-GlcNAcylation is linked to high glucose-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. By immunoprecipitation, we found that several mitochondrial proteins, which are members of complexes of the respiratory chain, like subunit NDUFA9 of complex I, subunits core 1 and core 2 of complex III, and the mitochondrial DNA-encoded subunit I of complex IV (COX I) are O-GlcNAcylated. By mass spectrometry, we identified that serine 156 on NDUFA9 is O-GlcNAcylated. High glucose treatment (30 mm glucose) increases mitochondrial protein O-GlcNAcylation, including those of COX I and NDUFA9 which are reduced by expression of O-GlcNAcase (GCA). Increased mitochondrial O-GlcNAcylation is associated with impaired activity of complex I, III, and IV in addition to lower mitochondrial calcium and cellular ATP content. When the excessive O-GlcNAc modification is reduced by GCA expression, mitochondrial function improves; the activity of complex I, III, and IV increases to normal and mitochondrial calcium and cellular ATP content are returned to control levels. From these results we conclude that specific mitochondrial proteins of cardiac myocytes are O-GlcNAcylated and that exposure to high glucose increases mitochondrial protein O-GlcNAcylation, which in turn contributes to impaired mitochondrial function."

Phosphorylation at Ser-129 (p-Ser-129) is of particular interest because the majority of synuclein in Lewy bodies contains this modification (15Fujiwara H. Hasegawa M. Dohmae N. Kawashima A.

Interpretation of these studies is complicated by a recent study showing that the S129D and S129A mutations themselves have effects on the aggregation properties of α-synuclein independent of their effects on phosphorylation, with the S129A mutation stimulating fibril formation (20Paleologou K.E.

Clearly, determination of the role of p-Ser-129 phosphorylation would be helped by identification of the responsible kinase. In addition, identification will provide a pathologically relevant way to increase phosphorylation in a cell or animal model. Several kinases have been proposed to phosphorylate α-synuclein, including casein kinases 1 and 2 (10Okochi M. Walter J. Koyama A. Nakajo S. Baba M. Iwatsubo T. Meijer L. Kahle P.J. Haass C. J. Biol.

Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 26515-26522Google Scholar). In this report, we offer evidence that a member of the polo-like kinase (PLK) family, PLK2 (or serum-inducible kinase, SNK), functions as an α-synuclein kinase. The ability of PLK2 to directly phosphorylate α-synuclein at Ser-129 is established by overexpression in cell culture and by in vitro reaction with the purified kinase. We show that PLK2 phosphorylates α-synuclein in cells, including primary neuronal cultures, using a series of kinase inhibitors as well as inhibition of expression with RNA interference. In addition, inhibitor and knock-out studies in mouse brain support a role for PLK2 as an α-synuclein kinase in vivo. Kinase Assays—To prepare biotinylated α-synuclein substrate, a cysteine residue was introduced into the C terminus (141C-αSyn) of the recombinant α-synuclein expression construct previously described (11Anderson J.P.

PLK1, -2, -3, and -4 (Carna Biosciences) or CK 2 (New England Biolabs) were mixed with 66 nm biotin-141C-α-synuclein (33 nm) and 0.2 mm phospholipid vesicles (75% soybean phosphatidylcholine (Sigma Aldrich), 25% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sre-glycero-3-phosphate (Avanti Polar Lipids) in buffer A (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). The kinase reaction was started by adding an equal volume of buffer B (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm MgCl2) and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Europium cryptate-labeled p-Ser-129-specific11A5 antibody (2 nm) and streptavidin-allophycocyanin (7.5 nm) were added in the same reaction volume of buffer C (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.8 m KF, 66 nm EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin), and fluorescence intensity was measured. Uniform phosphorylation of the p-Ser-129 α-synuclein standard was confirmed by reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy. The p-Ser-129 α-synuclein standard curve was obtained under the same conditions as for measurement of assay samples, without kinase. Unphosphorylated α-synuclein was added to keep the total synuclein constant at 33 nm. For inhibitor studies, compounds were serially diluted in buffer B, with a PLK2 concentration of 0.3 nm. Targeted Gene Disruption and Generation of Plk2–/– Mice—plk2–/– mice were prepared by Caliper Life Sciences. A plk2 targeting construct was designed to replace all 14 plk2 exons (deletion between sequences 5′-CAGCCAGCCGGCGCGTATTTAAAGC-3′ and 5′-AGCACGGGTTCCTGACACGTCAG-3′) with a Neo cassette (targeting vector FtNwCD, Caliper Life Sciences). This targeting construct was used to disrupt the plk2 gene in C57BL6 embryonic stem cells. These embryonic stem cells were injected into blastocysts and implanted into pseudo-pregnant females. Resulting germ line chimeras were crossed to C57BL/6N Tac mice, and heterozygous offspring were intercrossed to produce PLK2-null animals. Similar to a previous report (23Ma S. Charron J. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell Biol... 2003; 23: 6936-6943Google Scholar), few live plk2–/– homozygous offspring were observed. Mice were genotyped by PCR using the following primers: 5′-CTGTGCTCGACGTTGTCACTG-3′ and 5′-GATCCCCTCAGAAGAACTCGT-3′ for the disrupted allele and 5′-CTTGCTCGTACTCATCACGGCA-3′ and 5′-AACCTAGTCACTTAGCAATGCCAGGT-3′ for the wild-type allele. Preparation of Lentiviral Constructs—The lentiviral plasmid designated pAGMK was generated by modifying the parent lentiviral plasmid pCSC-SP-PW-GFP1 (24Marr R.A. Guan H. Rockenstein E. Kindy M. Gage F.H. Verma I. Masliah E. Hersh L.B. J. Mol. Neurosci... 2004; 22: 5-11Google Scholar) as described in the supplemental materials. The cDNA coding for α-synuclein or α-synuclein (E46K) was cloned into pAGMK to replace green fluorescent protein, using the AgeI/PmeI sites. The Plk2 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) containing plasmid (TRCN0000000869, CCGGGTGACGGTGCTGAAATACTTTCTCGAGAAAGTATTTCAGCACCGTCACTTTTT) was obtained from Sigma. The procedures for lentivirus production are described in the supplemental materials. After the total RNA was isolated, the efficiency of mRNA knockdown by shRNA was determined by TaqMan quantitative RT-PCR with the Applied Biosystems Gene-Assay kit using the protocol provided by the supplier. The relative copy number of PLK2 mRNA in the cellular extract was calculated after normalization to a housekeeping mRNA, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Cortical Cultures from PLK2 Knock-out Mice—Embryonic day 15 embryos were obtained from heterozygous PLK2 knockout crossed C57Bl6 mice (International Animal Care and Use Convention (IACUC) protocol MO-PH-05-08). Each embryo was placed in a distinct Petri dish for subsequent genotyping analysis as described above. Cultures, at least 95% neuronal, were prepared as described by Wright et al. (25Wright S. Malinin N.L. Powell K.A. Yednock T. Rydel R.E. Griswold-Prenner I. Neurobiol. Aging.. 2007; 28: 226-237Google Scholar). After 14 days in culture, cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in ice-cold cell extraction buffer (CEB; 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, 20 mm Na2P2O7, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate). Plates were snap-frozen on dry ice and stored at –80 °C. Duplicate plates from each culture were harvested for qRT-PCR as detailed below. RNA was extracted from samples and purified using the Qiagen RNeasy 96 kit according to the Qiagen protocol. Transfection of HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells were co-transfected with pAGMK-α-synuclein (wild type), along with either pCMV6-XL4 empty vector or pCMV6-XL4 vector containing PLK2 (OriGene Technologies, Rockville, MD). Cells were plated at a density of 4,000 cells/well into poly-d-lysine-coated 96-well plates. The following day, growth medium was replaced with 293 medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate), and cDNAs were incubated at room temperature with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 15 min prior to transfection with 100 nm siRNA and Lipofectamine 2000 per well following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline 48 h after transfection and then harvested in CEB. Plates were snap-frozen on dry ice and stored at –80 °C. Compound Treatment of Swiss-Webster Cortical Cultures and of Transfected HEK293 Cells—Mouse cortical cultures were prepared as described above from embryonic day 15 Swiss-Webster embryos, except that the embryonic cortices were pooled. Cells were maintained for 14 days prior to inhibitor treatment. Transfected HEK293 cells were prepared as described above. The following inhibitors were diluted into medium, and cells were treated for 2 h: BI2536, N-[4-(4-aminothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)phenyl]-N′-(3-methylphenyl)urea (APMU), and 2-dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole (DMAT; Calbiochem). After 2 h, cells were washed and lysed as described above. In Vivo Experiments—Female 9-week-old FVB/N mice (20–26 g each) were purchased from Taconic. All experiments were approved by the IACUC of Elan Pharmaceuticals and conducted in accordance with its guidelines. Drug administration was by intravenous tail vein injection with one 30 mg/kg dose of BI2536 or vehicle at a 5 ml/kg dose volume in 0.9% saline. Animals were euthanized by carbon dioxide 3 h after dosing. Brains were removed, rinsed in 0.9% saline, and separated into left and right hemispheres. The cortex was dissected from the right hemisphere, frozen on dry ice, and kept at –80 °C until used for quantitation of α-synuclein levels. ELISA Assay—Protein concentration of lysates was measured using the Micro BCA Kit (Pierce Biotechnology). Total α-synuclein and p-Ser-129 α-synuclein levels were each normalized to the total protein measured in each lysate, and a ratio of phosphorylated synuclein to total synuclein was calculated. Total and p-Ser-129 α-synuclein levels were quantified by sandwich ELISA using 1H7 as the capture antibody and biotinylated 5C12 or biotinylated 11A5 as the total or phosphosynuclein reporter antibodies as described (11Anderson J.P. Walker D.E. Goldstein J.M. De Laat R. Banducci K. Caccavello R.J. Barbour R. Huang J. Kling K. Lee M. Diep L. Keim P.S. Shen X. Chataway T. Schlossmacher M.G. Seubert P. Schenk D. Sinha S. Gai W.P. Chilcote T.J. J. Biol. Chem... 2006; 281: 29739-29752Google Scholar) with the exception that cells were lysed in CEB instead of guanidine, and Costar EIA/RIA high binding 96-well plates (Corning) were used. qRT-PCR Analysis of PLK2 Knock-out Mouse Cortical Cultures—cDNA from mouse cortical culture RNA was made using the SuperScript II first-strand synthesis system from Invitrogen. Gene expression assays from Applied Biosystems containing fluorogenic quantitative PCR primer/probe sets were obtained for mouse PLK2. Each cDNA was added to the qPCR master mix containing Applied Biosystems TaqMan universal PCR master with uracil N-glycosylase and ROX reference dye, 900 nm each of the forward and reverse primer, and 200 nm of the fluorogenic probe. qRT-PCR was carried out using one cycle of 50 °C, 2 min, 95 °C, 2 min and 40 cycles of 95 °C, 15 s and 60 °C, 1 min. For each well, the relative copy number of the gene of interest was normalized to total RNA as measured by the RiboGreen 96-well kit (Invitrogen). To identify potential α-synuclein kinases, we screened HEK293 cells overexpressing α-synuclein for reduction of the p-Ser-129 modification, using the Ambion Silencer kinase siRNA library (Applied Biosystems). Such knockdown approaches have the advantage of avoiding artificial activity resulting from overexpression. Several kinases whose reduction decreased synuclein phosphorylation were identified (26Chilcote T.J. Banducci K. Frigon N.L. Basi G.S. Anderson J.P. Goldstein J. Griswold-Prenner I. Chereau D. World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).August 9 2007Google Scholar). Of the candidate kinases, PLK2 was of particular interest because the siRNAs against this enzyme provided the largest and most consistent decrease in α-synuclein phosphorylation. Importantly, PLK2, as well as the closely related PLK3, are expressed in brain (27Kauselmann G. Weiler M. Wulff P. Jessberger S. Konietzko U. Scafidi J. Staubli U. Bereiter-Hahn J. Strebhardt K. Kuhl D. EMBO J.. 1999; 18: 5528-5539Google Scholar, 28Simmons D.L. Neel B.G. Stevens R. Evett G. Erikson R.L. Mol. Cell Biol... 1992; 12: 4164-4169Google Scholar). PLK Family Members Directly Phosphorylate α-Synuclein—To confirm that PLK2 can directly phosphorylate α-synuclein, we examined the proteins in vitro. PLK2 was compared with the other members of the PLK family, as well as CK2, which has been previously shown to phosphorylate α-synuclein (10Okochi M. Walter J. Koyama A. Nakajo S. Baba M. Iwatsubo T. Meijer L. Kahle P.J. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 390-397Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at Ser-129 was measured with a fluorescence assay using an antibody specific for phosphorylation at this residue (11Anderson J.P. Walker D.E. Goldstein J.M. De Laat R. Banducci K. Caccavello R.J. Barbour R. Huang J. Kling K. Lee M. Diep L. Keim P.S. Shen X. Chataway T. Schlossmacher M.G. Seubert P. Schenk D. Sinha S. Gai W.P. Chilcote T.J. J. Biol. Chem... 2006; 281: 29739-29752Google Scholar); no other phosphorylation was observed by mass spectroscopy. PLK2 and -3 efficiently phosphorylated α-synuclein (Fig. 1A), with results consistent with complete phosphorylation of the 33 nm synuclein substrate (compare with the 33 nm p-Ser-129 (pS129) standard, Fig. 1A, inset). PLK1 had lower activity, comparable with that of CK2. To ensure that all enzymes were active, their abilities to phosphorylate another substrate, casein, were verified (supplemental Fig. S1). PLK4 had no measurable activity against either substrate but was able to autophosphorylate, suggesting that both casein and synuclein may be poor substrates for this enzyme. Inhibition or Reduction of PLK2 Decreases α-Synuclein Phosphorylation—To establish the role of PLK2 in neurons, the effect of knockdown of PLK2 levels in human cortical cultures was investigated using shRNA in lentiviral vectors. As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, transduction with the PLK2 shRNA vectors caused substantial reduction of PLK2 message levels (by as much as 64%) and a parallel reduction of p-Ser-129 α-synuclein (as much as 78%). No effect was observed on PLK3 mRNA or total α-synuclein levels, and there was no cellular toxicity detected by Alamar Blue assay, suggesting that the effect on phospho-α-synuclein was mediated by specific mRNA silencing (data not shown). We have compared the potency of selected kinase inhibitors against PLK2 in mouse primary cortical cultures with their potency in the biochemical PLK2 assay. Many of the studies investigating CK2 as an α-synuclein kinase have used the inhibitor DMAT. We also find that DMAT inhibits α-synuclein phosphorylation in mouse cortical cultures, with an EC50 around 30 μm. However, it also inhibits PLK2 in the biochemical assay (Fig. 2, A and B). APMU (compound 3 in Johnson et al. (29Johnson E.F. Stewart K.D. Woods K.W. Giranda V.L. Luo Y. Biochem.. 2007; 46: 9551-9563Google Scholar)), which has good activity against PLK2 and -3 but is inactive against PLK1, inhibited α-synuclein phosphorylation in mouse cortical cultures. These results, together with the lower activity for PLK1 (Fig. 1A), suggest a limited role, if any, for PLK1 as an α-synuclein kinase. BI2536 has high potency and specificity for PLK family kinases (30Steegmaier M. Hoffmann M. Baum A. Lenart P. Petronczki M. Krssak M. Gurtler U. Garin-Chesa P. Lieb S. Quant J. Grauert M. Adolf G.R. Kraut N. Peters J.M. Rettig W.J. Curr. Biol... 2007; 17: 316-322Google Scholar) (see profiling results in supplemental Table S1). This compound inhibited up to 85–90% of α-synuclein phosphorylation in the cortical cultures, with an EC50 in multiple assays of 50–100 nm. Because comparison of inhibitor potencies in cells and in vitro can be complicated by the ability of cells to exclude or accumulate different inhibitors, we compared the potency of inhibitors in HEK293 cells transfected with PLK2 (Fig. 2C) or with vector controls (endogenous HEK293 cell kinases only, Fig. 2D). Transfection with PLK2 increases the levels of synuclein phosphorylation over 10-fold so that almost all of the activity could be attributed to the transfected kinase. Good agreement was observed between inhibitor potencies in the presence and absence of overexpressed PLK2. In the absence of kinase transfection, the maximum inhibition of p-Ser-129 α-synuclein was around 60%. The remainder may be due to an additional kinase in these cells. BI2536 was used to validate the role of PLK family members in α-synuclein phosphorylation in vivo. Mice were dosed intravenously with BI2536, the brains were collected, and the levels of total and p-Ser-129 α-synuclein in cortical extracts were measured by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 3A, consistent and significant inhibition of α-synuclein phosphorylation was observed. The effect of removal of the plk2 gene on α-synuclein levels was also investigated using PLK2 knock-out mice. Primary cortical cultures from a homozygous knock-out mouse were compared with those from wild-type (plk2+/+) littermates. Measurement of mRNA levels by qRT-PCR showed that PLK2 expression was completely ablated. Comparison of α-synuclein and p-Ser-129 α-synuclein levels in primary cortical cultures from knock-out and wild-type littermates showed that α-synuclein phosphorylation was decreased by about 70%. A similar decrease was observed in soluble α-synuclein in 2–3-month-old cortices (Fig. 3, B and C). In this study, we have shown that members of the PLK family, specifically PLK1, -2, and -3, phosphorylate Ser-129 of α-synuclein in vitro, suggesting that they are capable of acting as direct α-synuclein kinases. Studies with inhibitors additionally suggest that PLK2 and PLK3 are responsible for the majority of α-synuclein phosphorylation in cultured neurons and in mouse brain. PLK2-specific shRNA knockdown and genetic deletion of the plk2 gene in mice identify a role for this kinase in particular. Previous studies of PLK2 have identified several properties that are particularly intriguing for an α-synuclein kinase. It is induced by excitotoxic glutamate agonists (27Kauselmann G. Weiler M. Wulff P. Jessberger S. Konietzko U. Scafidi J. Staubli U. Bereiter-Hahn J. Strebhardt K. Kuhl D. EMBO J.. 1999; 18: 5528-5539Google Scholar). Furthermore, Sheng and colleagues have proposed that PLK2 has a critical role in maintaining dendritic spine stability (31Pak D.T.S. Sheng M. Science.. 2003; 302: 1368-1373Google Scholar) and modulating excitatory glutaminergic synaptic connections (32Seeburg D.P. Feliu-Mojer M. Gaiottino J. Pak D.T.S. Sheng M. Neuron.. 2008; 58: 571-583Google Scholar, 33Seeburg D.P. Sheng M. J. Neurosci... 2008; 28: 6583-6591Google Scholar). Thus, the involvement of PLK2 in α-synuclein phosphorylation provides a potential link between excitotoxic responses and Lewy pathology. Investigation of how the biology of PLK2 relates to the pathogenesis of PD and DLB should help clarify the role of synuclein phosphorylation in these diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2087929503,"Thrombospondin-1 regulates nitric oxide (NO) signaling in vascular cells via CD47. Because CD47 binding motifs are conserved in the C-terminal signature domains of all five thrombospondins and indirect evidence has implied CD47 interactions with other family members, we compared activities of recombinant signature domains of thrombospondin-1, -2, and -4 to interact with CD47 and modulate cGMP signaling. Signature domains of thrombospondin-2 and -4 were less active than that of thrombospondin-1 for inhibiting binding of radiolabeled signature domain of thrombospondin-1 or SIRPα (signal-regulatory protein) to cells expressing CD47. Consistent with this binding selectivity, the signature domain of thrombospondin-1 was more potent than those of thrombospondin-2 or -4 for inhibiting NO-stimulated cGMP synthesis in vascular smooth muscle cells and downstream effects on cell adhesion. In contrast to thrombospondin-1- and CD47-null cells, primary vascular cells from thrombospondin-2-null mice lack enhanced basal and NO-stimulated cGMP signaling. Effects of endogenous thrombospondin-2 on NO/cGMP signaling could be detected only in thrombospondin-1-null cells. Furthermore, tissue survival of ischemic injury and acute recovery of blood flow in thrombospondin-2-nulls resembles that of wild type mice. Therefore, thrombospondin-1 is the dominant regulator of NO/cGMP signaling via CD47, and its limiting role in acute ischemic injury responses is not shared by thrombospondin-2. Thrombospondin-1 regulates nitric oxide (NO) signaling in vascular cells via CD47. Because CD47 binding motifs are conserved in the C-terminal signature domains of all five thrombospondins and indirect evidence has implied CD47 interactions with other family members, we compared activities of recombinant signature domains of thrombospondin-1, -2, and -4 to interact with CD47 and modulate cGMP signaling.

Therefore, thrombospondin-1 is the dominant regulator of NO/cGMP signaling via CD47, and its limiting role in acute ischemic injury responses is not shared by thrombospondin-2. Nitric oxide (NO) is a major mediator of intracellular and paracellular signal transduction. NO preserves vascular health by minimizing the adhesion of inflammatory cells to the vessel wall, limiting platelet activation, and increasing blood vessel diameter and blood flow by relaxing vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). 3The abbreviations used are: VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell(s); DEA/NO, diethylamine/NONOate; sGC, soluble guanylate cyclase; SIRP, signal-regulatory protein; TSP, thrombospondin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.3The abbreviations used are: VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell(s); DEA/NO, diethylamine/NONOate; sGC, soluble guanylate cyclase; SIRP, signal-regulatory protein; TSP, thrombospondin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. These actions of NO are mediated by activating soluble isoforms of guanylate cyclase (sGC) to increase cGMP levels, resulting in downstream activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinases and ion channels (1Ignarro L.J. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2002; 53: 503-514PubMed Google Scholar). Physiological NO/cGMP signaling is limited by several phosphodiesterases that degrade cGMP and by thrombospondin-1 (TSP). TSP1 is a secreted protein that is produced by vascular and inflammatory cells that regulates cellular behavior by engaging several cell surface receptors. Recently we reported that TSP1 potently blocks NO-stimulated prosurvival responses in endothelial and VSMC (2Isenberg J.S. Ridnour L.A. Perruccio E.M. Espey M.G. Wink D.A. Roberts D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13141-13146Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 3Isenberg J.S. Wink D.A. Roberts D.D. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 71: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). TSP1 also plays a role in promoting platelet thrombus formation and hemostasis by antagonizing the antithrombotic activity of NO (4Isenberg J.S. Hyodo F. Matsumoto K. Romeo M.J. Abu-Asab M. Tsokos M. Kuppusamy P. Wink D.A. Krishna M.C. Roberts D.D. Blood. 2007; 109: 1945-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In all of these vascular cells, picomolar concentrations of TSP1 are sufficient to block NO-stimulated fluxes in cGMP by engaging its receptor CD47 (5Isenberg J.S. Ridnour L.A. Dimitry J. Frazier W.A. Wink D.A. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26069-26080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Nanomolar concentrations of TSP1 further inhibit the same signaling pathway by inhibiting CD36-mediated uptake of myristate into vascular cells (6Isenberg J.S. Jia Y. Fukuyama J. Switzer C.H. Wink D.A. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15404-15415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In vivo, mice lacking TSP1 demonstrate elevated basal tissue cGMP levels and greater increases in regional blood flow in response to a NO challenge than wild type controls (4Isenberg J.S. Hyodo F. Matsumoto K. Romeo M.J. Abu-Asab M. Tsokos M. Kuppusamy P. Wink D.A. Krishna M.C. Roberts D.D. Blood. 2007; 109: 1945-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). After an ischemic insult, the absence of TSP1 or CD47 in transgenic mice is associated with better maintenance of tissue perfusion and enhanced tissue survival. Similarly, targeting TSP1 or CD47 using function blocking antibodies enhances ischemic tissue perfusion and survival in wild type mice and pigs (7Isenberg J.S. Romeo M.J. Abu-Asab M. Tsokos M.

Roberts D.D. Ann. Surg. 2008; 247: 860-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). TSP1 belongs to a family of five secreted glycoproteins that share an evolutionarily conserved C-terminal signature domain (9Carlson C.B. Lawler J. Mosher D.F. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 672-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). TSP1 and TSP2 form a distinct subfamily of trimeric proteins that exhibit similar anti-angiogenic activities for endothelial cells in vitro and activities in vivo to block tumor growth. Despite their similarities in structure, TSP1 and TSP2 have markedly different expression patterns after tissue injury, with TSP1 being immediately expressed and maximal at day 3, whereas TSP2 was not expressed until day 7 and was maximal 10 days after injury (10Agah A. Kyriakides T.R. Lawler J. Bornstein P. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 831-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In addition, large amounts of TSP1 but not TSP2 are stored in platelet α-granules and released into the wound environment. Polymorphisms in TSP1 and TSP2 have been linked to altered risk of premature myocardial infarction (11Topol E.J. McCarthy J. Gabriel S. Moliterno D.J. Rogers W.J. Newby L.K. Freedman M. Metivier J. Cannata R. O'Donnell C.J. Kottke-Marchant K. Murugesan G. Plow E.F. Stenina O. Daley G.Q. Circulation. 2001; 104: 2641-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 12Boekholdt S.M.

A 3′-untranslated region polymorphism in TSP2 is also associated with type 2 diabetes in men (13Yamaguchi S. Yamada Y. Matsuo H. Segawa T. Watanabe S. Kato K. Yokoi K. Ichihara S. Metoki N. Yoshida H. Satoh K. Nozawa Y. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2007; 19: 631-637PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular basis for these associations is unclear. Less is known about the roles of the pentameric TSP3–5 in vascular cells. TSP3 and TSP5 (also known as cartilage oligomeric matrix protein) appear to serve their primary functions in bone development (14Hankenson K.D. Hormuzdi S.G. Meganck J.A. Bornstein P. Mol. Cell.

Heart J. 2006; 152: 543.e1-543.e5Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A proatherogenic activity for the A387P variant of TSP4 was proposed based on its differential ability to modulate proliferation of endothelial and VSMC (18Stenina O.I. Desai S.Y. Krukovets I. Kight K. Janigro D. Topol E.J. Plow E.F. Circulation. 2003; 108: 1514-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Cardiovascular functions of TSP4 may also be linked to the high expression of TSP4 in heart (19Lawler J. Duquette M. Whittaker C.A. Adams J.C. McHenry K. DeSimone D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1059-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and its altered expression in that tissue during hypertensive heart failure (20Rysa J. Leskinen H. Ilves M. Ruskoaho H. Hypertension. 2005; 45: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of TSP1 is sufficient to mediate CD47-dependent inhibition of cGMP signaling (5Isenberg J.S. Ridnour L.A. Dimitry J. Frazier W.A. Wink D.A. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26069-26080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Of the two CD47 binding VVM motifs identified in this domain of TSP1, the first is conserved among all five TSPs, suggesting that CD47 binding could be a universal attribute of this family (21Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Finn M.B. Blystone S.D. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Based on structural evidence that the VVM motifs may not be accessible (22Adams J.C. Bentley A.A. Kvansakul M. Hatherley D. Hohenester E. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 784-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23Kvansakul M. Adams J.C. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), however, conservation of VVM motifs may not be sufficient to predict CD47 binding. Uncertainty regarding the location of the CD47 binding site in the G domain of TSP1 therefore limits interpretation of the known sequence homology to predict CD47 binding to other TSP family members. Although CD47 recognition of other TSPs has not been demonstrated experimentally, a local deficiency of inflammation-associated T cell apoptosis shared by TSP1-, CD47-, and TSP2-null mice is consistent with this hypothesis (24Ticchioni M. Raimondi V. Lamy L. Wijdenes J. Lindberg F.P. Brown E.J. Bernard A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a 21-residue peptide from the C-terminal domain of TSP4 was found to decrease human umbilical vein endothelial cell proliferation similar to the CD47 binding peptides from TSP1, although it lacks the VVM motif and no interaction with CD47 was demonstrated (25Congote L.F. Temmel N. FEBS Lett. 2004; 576: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To directly address whether other TSP family members can inhibit NO responses and signaling in vascular cells, we now compare binding of recombinant signature domains of TSP1, TSP2, and TSP4 to cell surface CD47 and inhibition of NO-stimulated cell responses and cGMP signaling by these domains. We also compared acute tissue blood flow and perfusion responses to ischemic challenge in TSP1 and TSP2-null mice and cGMP responses in primary cultures of vascular cells isolated from these mice. These studies clearly demonstrate that CD47 selectively interacts with TSP1 and that the signature domains of TSP2 and TSP4 are less potent inhibitors of NO signaling in vascular cells in vitro. Furthermore, we show that the role of TSP1 to acutely limit recovery from ischemic injury in vivo is not shared by TSP2. Cells and Reagents—Human aortic VSMC were obtained from Lonza (Switzerland) and maintained in the appropriate growth medium provided by the manufacturer. Wild type and CD47 negative (clone JinB8) Jurkat cells were obtained from Drs. Kevin Gardner and Eric Brown, respectively, and maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum. The nitric oxide donors diethylamine/NONOate (DEA/NO) and diethylenetriamine/NONOate were provided kindly by Dr. Larry Keefer (NCI-Frederick, Maryland). Type I collagen was obtained from Inamed Biomaterials (Fremont, CA). TSP1 was prepared as previously described from fresh platelets obtained under an approved protocol from the transfusion service of the National Institutes of Health (26Roberts D.D. Cashel J. Guo N. J. Tissue Cult. Methods. 1994; 16: 217-222Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins derived from TSP4 were expressed in insect cells using baculovirus (27Misenheimer T.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41229-41235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Recombinant regions of TSP1 and TSP2 as summarized in Fig. 1A were prepared as described (28Annis D.S. Gunderson K.A. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27067-27075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Recombinant extracellular domain of human SIRPα including all three Ig domains fused to a modified human Fc domain was prepared as described (29Piccio L. Vermi W. Boles K.S. Fuchs A. Strader C.A. Facchetti F. Cella M. Colonna M. Blood. 2005; 105: 2421-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). SIRPα and E123CaG1 were labeled using Na125I by the iodogen method as previously described for TSP1 (30Guo N.H. Krutzsch H.C. Negre E. Vogel T. Blake D.A. Roberts D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3040-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A CD47 monoclonal antibody (B6H12) was purified from conditioned medium of the corresponding hybridoma (American Type Culture Collection). An isotype-matched control IgG1 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. TSP1 antibody A6.1 was obtained from Thermo Scientific (Cheshire, UK). An antisense morpholino oligonucleotide complementary to murine TSP2 mRNA (5′-GGCCAGTGCCCAGAGCATCTTGTCT-3′) and a 5-base mismatched control morpholino were obtained from Gene Tools (Philomath, OR). Animals—C57BL/6 wild type and TSP1-null mice were housed in a pathogen-free environment with ad libitum access to water and rat chow on a 12-h light-dark cycle. TSP2-null male mice 12 weeks of age and matched wild type mice in a B6129sf1/J background were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). All animal studies conformed to the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Cancer Institute of the NIH. Primary Murine Vascular Cell Isolation—Using sterile technique, whole lungs were excised from 12-week-old wild type, TSP1, and TSP2-null male mice, minced into 1–2-mm fragments, and incubated in basal medium with collagenase type II (Worthington, MA). The cell suspension was then plated in standard culture flasks (Nunc) in the presence of endothelial cell growth medium (Lonza) and used at the first passage. Under such conditions staining for CD31 has demonstrated 85–95% of cells to be endothelial cells (2Isenberg J.S. Ridnour L.A. Perruccio E.M. Espey M.G. Wink D.A. Roberts D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13141-13146Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Cell Adhesion Assay—Human aortic VSMC were plated at 10,000 cells/well onto 96-well plates (Nunc Maxisorb) precoated with type I collagen (3 μg/ml). Cells were incubated for 1 h in basal medium with 0.1% BSA and no growth factors and the indicated concentrations of recombinant TSP2, -3, and -4 domains ± DEA/NO. Plates were then washed with PBS, fixed with glutaraldehyde, stained with crystal violet, and washed. Absorbed stain was solubilized with acetic acid from fixed cells and quantified using a Micro580 Elisa plate reader (Dynatech Laboratories, Alexandria, VA) at 450 nm. Cell Proliferation Assay—Primary wild type and TSP2-null lung-derived endothelial cells were harvested as described (2Isenberg J.S. Ridnour L.A. Perruccio E.M. Espey M.G. Wink D.A. Roberts D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13141-13146Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and plated at a density of 10,000 cells/well in standard endothelial cell growth medium ± NO (10 μm diethylenetriamine/NONOate) and incubated for 72 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) was then added, and the product was quantified at 450 nm. Intracellular Cyclic GMP Measurement—Yucatan white hairless pig femoral artery VSMC (8Isenberg J.S. Romeo M.J. Maxhimer J.B. Smedley J. Frazier W.A. Roberts D.D. Ann. Surg. 2008; 247: 860-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) or wild type and TSP1- and TSP2-null murine endothelial cells (105 cells/well) grown overnight in 6- or 12-well culture plates (Nunc) were pretreated for 24 h with medium containing 2% fetal calf serum and weaned off serum over 48 h before treatment with DEA/NO with or without the indicated treatment agents in serum-free medium containing 0.1% BSA. Intracellular cGMP levels were determined using an enzyme immunoassay (Amersham Biosciences) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Hindlimb Ischemia Model—Wild type and TSP2-null 12-week-old male mice underwent inhalation general anesthesia with 1.5% isoflurane. Using sterile techniques, the femoral artery at the level of the inguinal ligament was identified and under operative magnification ligated with a 5–0 nylon suture, and the skin incision was closed. Limb perfusion was then measured at 5-min intervals for the first hour postoperatively and at 72 h post-operatively via laser Doppler (Moor Instruments, Devon England). Also at 72 h post-operatively, vascular remodeling was assessed in the medial thigh musculature above and below the point of femoral artery ligation. Laser Doppler Analysis—Dorsal cutaneous flap or hindlimb perfusion was determined in wild type and TSP2-null male mice under light general anesthesia via inhalation of 1.5% isoflurane. Core body temperature was constantly monitored and maintained at 35 °C. Pre-operative and post-operative perfusion flux levels were obtained at 5-min intervals with the following machine parameters: scan area, 1.6 × 2.5 cm; scan speed, 4 ms/pixel; scan time, 1 min 54 s; override distance, 25 cm. The override distance was 20 cm. In hindlimb studies the opposite unoperated limb served as an internal control. Ischemic Soft Tissue Flap Model—Under inhalation isoflurane (1.5%), animals underwent creation of a random myocutaneous (McFarlane) flap as previously described (4Isenberg J.S. Hyodo F. Matsumoto K. Romeo M.J. Abu-Asab M. Tsokos M. Kuppusamy P. Wink D.A. Krishna M.C. Roberts D.D. Blood. 2007; 109: 1945-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Flap viability was assessed 72 h post-operatively. Determination of Flap Survival—Clinical assessment of flap perfusion was performed with notation of color, capillary refill, and bleeding to needle-stick being recorded. Flap dimensions were then traced onto a clear plastic sheet with demarcation of viable and non-viable areas made. Weights of segments of sheeting corresponding to viable versus non-viable portions of flaps were then determined, and % survival was expressed as a percentage versus total as previously described (4Isenberg J.S. Hyodo F. Matsumoto K. Romeo M.J. Abu-Asab M. Tsokos M. Kuppusamy P. Wink D.A. Krishna M.C. Roberts D.D. Blood. 2007; 109: 1945-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). CD47 Binding Studies—Jurkat T lymphoma cells (1 × 106 cells/well) were suspended in PBS containing divalent cations and 0.1% BSA with the indicated treatment reagents for 30 min at 37 °C. 125I-SIRPα or 125I-E123CaG1 was then added, and the cells were incubated at room temperature on a plate shaker for 1 h. Cells were separated by centrifugation through silicone oil (Nye Co, New Bedford, MA), and cell-bound radioactivity was quantified using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences gamma counter. Background counts in the absence of cells were determined for each experiment and subtracted to determine net binding. Detection of TSP2 Secretion—A heparin-BSA capture assay was used to detect TSP2 levels in the conditioned media. A 50-μl volume of heparin-BSA conjugate diluted to 100 ng/ml was adsorbed onto 96-well plate wells overnight at 4 °C. The next day the wells were blocked with 250 μl/well 5 mm Tris, 1% BSA, 0.02 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.8, for 30 min. Samples were dispensed at 50 μl per well and allowed to bind to the immobilized heparin-BSA for 2 h at 37 °C. The wells were aspirated, and 50 μl of polyclonal anti-mouse TSP2 diluted 1:1000 in 50 mm Tris and 1% BSA was added to each well. The antibody was allowed to bind to the immobilized TSP2 for 2 h at 37 °C. After aspiration, the wells were washed 3 times with 50 μl per well of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline with 0.02% BSA, 0.02 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.05% Tween 20. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Kirkegaard and Perry) was diluted to 1:1000 in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 and allowed to bind for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were washed 3 times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20. A 50-μl volume of o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride was dissolved in phosphate-citrate buffer with sodium perborate (Sigma #P4922), and 30 μl of hydrogen peroxide was added to each well just before use. After 10 min, 3 m sulfuric acid was added to stop the color development. Absorbance values were read at 490 nm. Statistics—Results of vascular cell in vitro data are presented as the mean ± S.D. of at least three experiments. Significance was calculated with Student's t test or, where appropriate, one-way and two-way analysis of variance using a standard software package (Origin) with p < 0.05. In vivo tissue survival and perfusion study results represent the mean ± S.D. of five pairs of wild type and TSP2-null animals. Selective Binding of the Signature Domain of TSP1 to CD47-expressing Cells—Because others have failed to detect TSP1 binding to a recombinant extracellular domain of CD47 (22Adams J.C. Bentley A.A. Kvansakul M. Hatherley D. Hohenester E. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 784-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we chose to examine TSP1 binding to native CD47 using a cell binding assay. TSP1 engages multiple cell surface receptors, and high affinity binding via the N domain to heparan sulfate proteoglycans is typically dominant in such cell binding studies (31Chandrasekaran S. Guo N.H. Rodrigues R.G. Kaiser J. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11408-11416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To detect CD47 binding, therefore, we used a recombinant signature domain of TSP1 that is known to mediate CD47-dependent signaling but lacks the high affinity heparin-binding site (Fig. 1A). The only other cell surface receptors known to interact with this domain are αvβ3 integrin, which is not expressed in Jurkat T lymphoma cells (32Li Z. Calzada M.J. Sipes J.M. Cashel J.A. Krutzsch H.C. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Roberts D.D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and β1 integrins, which interact with low affinity with the E123 domain (33Calzada M.J. Annis D.S. Zeng B. Marcinkiewicz C. Banas B. Lawler J. Mosher D.F. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41734-41743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In Jurkat cells, β1 integrin interaction with this domain of TSP1 requires activating signals that were not present in these studies. Jurkat cells were also chosen for the binding studies based on their well characterized CD47-mediated responses to TSP1 (32Li Z. Calzada M.J. Sipes J.M. Cashel J.A. Krutzsch H.C. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Roberts D.D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and the availability of a somatic mutant of the Jurkat line lacking CD47 (JinB8) (24Ticchioni M. Raimondi V. Lamy L. Wijdenes J. Lindberg F.P. Brown E.J. Bernard A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). 125I-Labeled E123CaG1 bound at much higher levels to wild type Jurkat cells than to CD47-negative JinB8 cells (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, binding to Jurkat cells expressing CD47 was inhibited to background levels in a dose-dependent manner by the function-blocking CD47 antibody B6H12 (Fig. 1C). An isotype-matched control IgG1 did not significantly inhibit binding of E123CaG1 at the same concentrations. Binding was also significantly inhibited by the TSP1-derived CD47 binding peptide 1102FIRVVMYEGKK1112 (7N3) at 1 μm (p = 0.02) but not by the respective control peptide FIRGGMYEGKK (604, Fig. 1D). Specific binding of 125I-E123CaG1 to Jurkat cells was inhibited in the presence of 22 pm TSP1 (Fig. 1B), consistent with the known potency of TSP1 for inhibiting NO/cGMP signaling via CD47 (5Isenberg J.S. Ridnour L.A. Dimitry J. Frazier W.A. Wink D.A. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26069-26080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Unlabeled E123CaG1 was similarly active for self-inhibition of labeled ligand binding to Jurkat cells (Fig. 1E). In contrast, the corresponding signature domain of TSP2 (E123CaG2) was inactive over the same concentration range, and although the signature domain of TSP4 (E1234CaG4) produced consistent inhibition, the changes did not achieve significance (Fig. 1E). Therefore, high affinity interaction with CD47 appears to be relatively specific for the signature domain of TSP1. Selective Inhibition by TSP1 of SIRPα Binding to Cell Surface CD47—We were concerned that the relatively high non-displaceable fraction of E123CaG1 binding in Fig. 1 could reflect residual interactions with other TSP1 receptors. Therefore, competition with the well characterized CD47 ligand SIRPα (34Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 130-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar) was used to further assess TSP1 binding to cell surface CD47. TSP1 potently and dose-dependently inhibited 125I-SIRPα binding to Jurkat cells (Fig. 2A). Analysis of the binding data using Scafit (Version 2.4 of Ligand software (35Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7759) Google Scholar)) gave an apparent dissociation constant for TSP1 of 12 pm with a Bmax of ∼5000 sites/cell (Fig. 2A, inset). The latter value is consistent with the known copy numbers for CD47 on other cell lines (36Subramanian S. Parthasarathy R. Sen S. Boder E.T. Discher D.E. Blood. 2006; 107: 2548-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The apparent Kd is consistent with the known potency of TSP1 for inhibiting cGMP signaling, but we caution that this number is dependent on assumptions used in the analysis and does not represent an intrinsic dissociation constant. The requirement of CD47 for this interaction was confirmed by complete inhibition of 125I-SIRPα binding to Jurkat cells in the presence of the CD47 blocking antibody B6H12 and the absence of 125I-SIRPα binding to CD47-negative JinB8 cells (Fig. 2B). The dose dependence for B6H12 inhibition of SIRPα binding paralleled that for inhibiting E123CaG1 binding (compare Figs. 2C and 1C), and an isotype-matched control IgG1 did not significantly inhibit binding of SIRPα to wild type Jurkat cells (Fig. 2C). E123CaG1 showed a similar dose dependence for inhibiting SIRPα binding to Jurkat cells as intact TSP1, but the corresponding signature domains of TSP2 (E123CaG2) and TSP4 (E1234CaG4) were essentially inactive (Fig. 2D). This confirmed the relative specificity of CD47 for TSP1 and also established that TSP1 binding to CD47 can prevent interaction with its counter-receptor SIRPα. This has been hypothesized to occur in smooth muscle cells based on reduced co-immunoprecipitation of SIRPα with CD47 in the presence of TSP1 (37Maile L.A. Clemmons D.R. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 925-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but here is the first direct proof that such inhibition occurs at the level of SIRPα-CD47 binding.

We investigate the stability of such lists when ranks are converted to probabilities of extinction under different scenarios.Using a simple example and computer simulation, we show that preserving the categories when converting such list designations to probabilities of extinction does not guarantee the stability of the resulting lists.Care must be taken when choosing a suitable transformation, especially if conservation dollars are allocated to species in a ranked fashion.

https://openalex.org/W1990761473,"The accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is caused by many disease-relevant conditions, inducing conserved signaling events collectively known as the unfolded protein response. When ER stress is excessive or prolonged, cell death (usually occurring by apoptosis) is triggered. We undertook a chemical biology approach for investigating mechanisms of ER stress-induced cell death. Using a cell-based high throughput screening assay to identify compounds that rescued a neuronal cell line from thapsigargin-induced cell death, we identified benzodiazepinones that selectively inhibit cell death caused by inducers of ER stress (thapsigargin and tunicamycin) but not by inducers of extrinsic (tumor necrosis factor) or intrinsic (mitochondrial) cell death pathways. The compounds displayed activity in several cell lines and primary cultured neurons. Mechanism of action studies revealed that these compounds inhibit ER stress-induced activation of p38 MAPK and kinases responsible for c-Jun phosphorylation. Active benzodiazepinones suppressed cell death at the level of apoptotic signal kinase-1 (ASK1) within the IRE1 pathway but without directly inhibiting the kinase activity of ASK1 or >400 other kinases tested. Rather, active compounds enhanced phosphorylation of serine 967 of ASK1, promoting ASK1 binding to 14-3-3, an event associated with suppression of ASK1 function. Reducing ASK1 protein expression using small interfering RNA also protected cells from ER stress-induced apoptosis, confirming the importance of this protein kinase.

Multiple disturbances can cause pathological accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER, triggering an evolutionarily conserved response termed the “unfolded protein response” (UPR) (reviewed in Refs. 1Marciniak S.J. Ron D. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 1133-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 2Xu C. Bailly-Maitre B. Reed J.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2656-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar). ER stresses that induce the UPR include the following: (a) disturbances in cellular redox regulation caused by hypoxia, oxidants, or reducing agents that interfere with disulfide bonding of proteins in the lumen of the ER; (b) glucose deprivation, probably by interfering with N-linked protein glycosylation in the ER; (c) aberrations of Ca2+ regulation that impair the functions of Ca2+-dependent ER chaperones such as Grp78, Grp94, and calreticulin; (d) viral infections, which overload the ER with virus-encoded proteins; (e) high fat diet; and (f) inclusion body diseases typical of most chronic neurodegenerative diseases as well as disorders such as inclusion body myositis, which indirectly cause accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER perhaps by exhausting proteasome capacity (3Lindholm D. Wootz H. Korhonen L. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 4Yoshida H. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 630-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 5Kim I.-K. Xu W. Reed J.C. Nat. Drug Discovery Rev. 2008; 7: 1013-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). UPR-associated signaling events are initially intended to reestablish homeostasis and normal ER function, predominantly by activating transcriptional programs that induce expression of genes capable of enhancing the protein folding capacity of the ER and genes for ER-assisted degradation to help clear the ER of unfolded proteins and export them to the cytosol for degradation. However, when the adaptive mechanisms triggered by the UPR fail to compensate, cell death is often induced, typically by apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 2Xu C. Bailly-Maitre B. Reed J.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2656-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar, 5Kim I.-K. Xu W. Reed J.C. Nat. Drug Discovery Rev. 2008; 7: 1013-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). Indeed, ER stress-induced cell death has been implicated in a wide variety of diseases, including ischemic injury (stroke and myocardial infarction), heart failure, several neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and bipolar disorder, among others (reviewed in Refs. 4Yoshida H. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 630-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 5Kim I.-K. Xu W. Reed J.C. Nat. Drug Discovery Rev. 2008; 7: 1013-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). Thus, the identification of small molecule compounds that inhibit cell death induced by ER stress may provide new therapeutic opportunities for a variety of diseases. The predominant signaling pathways associated with the UPR are initiated by the ER membrane-associated proteins, Ire1α, PERK, and ATF6 (reviewed in Ref. 1Marciniak S.J. Ron D. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 1133-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Among these three major UPR signal transduction pathways, the Ire1α pathway has been most clearly connected to cell death, because it leads to activation of stress kinases, including JNK, which is known to phosphorylate and thereby modulate the activities of several Bcl-2 family proteins (6Nishitoh H.

In this study, we describe the identification by high throughput screening (HTS) of benzodiazepinone derivatives that selectively suppress cell death induced by ER stress, without impacting other cell death pathways. These benzodiazepinone compounds inhibit biochemical events associated with the Ire1α pathway, including modulating phosphorylation of apoptotic signaling kinase-1 (ASK1) and inhibiting downstream activation of JNK and p38 MAPK.

ATPlite assay kit was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 3.2 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5 mm KH2PO4, 1.3 mm KCl, 135 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) was from Invitrogen. Cell Culture—CSM14.1, SNB19, 293T, HeLa, and PPC-1 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 IU penicillin, and 1% l-glutamine. OVCAR5, Jurkat, and SW1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 IU penicillin, and 1% l-glutamine. PC12 cells were maintained in F-12/DMEM (50:50) with 10% fetal calf serum, 5% FBS, and antibiotics. C17.2 cells were maintained with same media for PC12 cells, but with 10% FBS and 5% fetal calf serum. For routine culture, CSM14.1 cells were incubated at 32 °C, whereas others were at 37 °C. High Throughput Compound Library Screening—CSM14.1 cells were recovered from cultures by trypsinization and plated in 96-well plates (Greiner catalog number 655074) at 3 × 103 cells per well in 40 μl of phenol red-free DMEM containing 2% FBS, and the plates were incubated overnight at 32 °C in a humidified atmosphere in 95% air, 5% CO2. Using an automated liquid handler (BIOMEK™ FX (Beckman Coulter)), 5 μl of test compounds in 10% DMSO were added to wells to achieve an approximate final concentration of 15 μg/ml. Aliquots of 5 μl of salubrinal (100 μm) in DMSO were delivered to column 1 (wells A–D), whereas 5 μl of 10% DMSO was delivered to column 1 (wells E–H) and column 12 (wells A–H) in every plate. After 2 h of preincubation, all wells except for those in column 12 were treated with 5 μl of TG-containing DMEM to give a final concentration of 15 μm. The wells in column 12 were treated with 5 μl of medium. The plates were returned to the incubator for an additional 20 h. Cell viability was assessed by a cellular ATP content assay (ATPlite, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The plates were read on an Analyst™ HT (Molecular Device Corp.) multimode plate reader in luminescence mode. Raw values from plates were analyzed in EXCEL software to evaluate survival rates, and imported into CBIS (Chem-Innovation Software, Inc.) for cheminformatics analysis. Wells that received DMSO + TG (column 1, wells F–H) were used as negative controls, whereas wells that received DMSO but no TG (column 12, wells A–H) were used as positive controls for the plate. The % efficacy of rescue for compounds was calculated as follows: % efficacy = ((well value - average of negative control)/(average of positive control - average of negative control))·100 (pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The 384-well assay protocol is available at PubChem (AID = 1222). Cell Viability Assays—Cell viability was evaluated by cellular ATP levels using a bioluminescence plate reader assay (above) or by annexin V-FITC staining using flow cytometry. For ATP assays, cells at a 105/ml were seeded at 40 μl per well in 96-well polystyrene, flat-bottom, Lumitrac microtiter plates (catalog number 655074, Greiner Bio-One). The next day, cells were preincubated with testing compounds for 2 h, followed by cell death-inducing agents. At various times thereafter, 20 μl of ATPlite solution was added, and ATP luminescence contents were evaluated using an Analyst™ HT (Molecular Devices Corp.) plate reader with Criterion Host analysis software, applying the luminescence mode. For flow cytometry, undifferentiated CSM14.1 cells at 104 cells per 400 μl of DMEM containing 2% FBS and antibiotics were cultured in 24-well plates (Greiner Bio One). The next day, cells were preincubated with DMSO or 25 μm of test compounds (same final DMSO volume). After 2 h, cells were treated with cell death-inducing agents, and the plates were returned to culture. After indicated times, all cells were recovered from wells by media transfer and trypsinization, Cells were washed with cold PBS and resuspended in 500 μl of 1× annexin V binding buffer (Biovision 1035-100), including 0.25 mg/ml annexin V FITC (Biovision 1001-1000) and propidium iodide (50 μg/ml). The percentage of annexin V-negative/PI negative cells (live) was determined by flow cytometry, using a FACSort analytical instrument (BD Biosciences). Immunoblotting—Undifferentiated CSM14.1 cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105/well in 6-well plates (Falcon). After overnight incubation at 32 °C, cells were treated with 15 μm TG for 2 h (c-Jun, p38 MAPK, eIF2α) or for 8 h (ATF-6 and CHOP), with either DMSO or compounds in DMSO added 2 h previously. Cell extracts were generated by adding lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) to collected cells. The extracts were centrifuged, and supernatants were recovered. After protein concentration determination, and boiling in an equal volume of Laemmli gel loading solution, 50 μg of cell extract was analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting, using polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Antibodies employed for immunoblotting included the following: anti-GST antibody (produced in our laboratory); anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science); anti-CHOP antibody (Sc-7351), anti-c-Jun antibody (Sc-1694), anti-p38 MAPK antibody (Sc-728), anti-ASK1 antibody (Sc-7931), and anti-eIF2α antibody (Sc-11386) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-phospho c-Jun antibody (9164), anti-phospho p38 MAPK antibody (9216), anti-phospho-eIF2α (3597) antibody, anti-phospho-ASK1 (Ser-967) antibody (3764), anti-phospho-ASK1 (Ser-83) antibody (3761), anti-phospho-ASK1 (Thr-845) antibody (3765), and anti-14-3-3 antibody (9639) (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA); and anti-ATF-6 antibody (IMG-273) (Imgenex, San Diego). Proteins were detected using various secondary antibodies by Super Signal (West Pico) and chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce) with exposure to x-ray film. Transfections—293T cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plates. After overnight incubation, cells were transfected with 0.4 μg of pcDNA-HA-ASK1 and cultured for 18 h. Cells were preincubated with 100 μm of test compounds for 2 h prior to culture with or without TG. Alternatively, 293T cells in 6-well plates were transfected with pcDNA-HA-ASK1 (0.5 μg) and pEBG-GST-14-3-3 (0.5 μg). The following day, cells were preincubated with DMSO or 100 μm compounds in DMSO for 2 h before TG (20 μm) treatment. GST Pulldown and Immunoprecipitation Assays—For binding of ASK1 with 14-3-3, extracts were prepared from transfected cells by adding lysis buffer containing 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) to collected cells and normalized for total protein content, and GST-14-3-3 protein was recovered using glutathione sulfotransferase 4B-Sepharose beads. Beads were washed and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting using various antibodies. For analysis of endogenous binding of ASK1 to 14-3-3, lysates were prepared from 100-mm dishes of OVCAR5 and SNB19 cells using the same lysis buffer, to which 1 μg of anti-ASK1 antibody was added for immunoprecipitation, and the resulting immune complexes were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-14-3-3 antibody. Primary Cortical Neurons—Primary cortical neurons were prepared from the midbrain of mice. Cerebral cortex was dissected from E16 mouse embryos and was incubated with 0.05% trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C. After mechanical dissociation by polished Pasteur tube, cortical cells were suspended in neural plating medium as follows: DMEM high glucose (Hyclone) medium containing 12.5% defined FBS (Hyclone), 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen), 12.5% nutrient mixture/Ham’s F-12 (Hyclone), 100 IU of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at a density of 5 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates on sterile coverslips. The medium was replaced with B27-neurobasal medium consisting of neurobasal medium (Hyclone) containing 2% B27 (Invitrogen) and 0.8 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen) after 24 h. After 14 days of maturation in culture, medium was changed to an alternative neurobasal media (Invitrogen). After 1 day, cells were preincubated with DMSO (0.2%) or 25 μm of compound CID-2891837 for 2 h, prior to treating neurons for 18 h with 5 μm TG. Cells were fixed on glass coverslips using 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. After washing in cold PBS, cells were blocked by 5% horse serum in PBS for 1 h, then washed with cold PBS, and incubated with either anti-NeuN monoclonal antibody (MAB377) (Chemicon, Billerica, MA) or anti-MAP2 monoclonal antibody (M4403) (Sigma) with 5% horse serum in PBS. Cells were washed in cold PBS and incubated with Texas Red-conjugated horse anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories) at 1:500 (v/v) dilution in PBS with 2% horse serum for an additional 1 h. Hoechst dye (5 μg/ml) was added for the final 5 min. After washing again, slides were mounted for UV microscopy. Apoptotic neurons were quantified by the percentage of immunostained cells that have both condensed nuclei by Hoechst dye and retracted neurites stained by MAP2 antibody, counting a minimum of >250 cells per sample. RNAi Experiments—For cell survival assay, HeLa cells were seeded at 1.5 × 103 cells/well in 384-well plates. For efficiency check, cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plates and cultured overnight. The cells were transfected with 10 nm scrambled (siCtrl) or siRNA targeting ASK1 for 48 h using Lipofectamine RNAimax (Invitrogen). The sense sequences of siRNA reagents were siCtrl (5′-GACGCGATCAGAGAGTAAT-3′), siASK1 number 1 (5′-GGTGGCACAAGCAAGTTCT-3′), and siASK1 number 2 (5′-GGTATACATGAGTGGAATT-3′). To check efficiency of RNA interference, ASK1 siRNA-transfected HeLa cells were transfected with pcDNA-HA-ASK1, and 1 day later, cell extracts were prepared, and protein concentration was determined and 50 μg subjected to immunoblotting using anti-HA antibody. Cell-based Screen for Inhibitors of ER Stress-induced Cell Death—Because cell death linked to ER stress is a prominent feature of several neurological diseases, we focused on developing a primary HTS assay utilizing neuronal cells. CSM14.1 is a rat striatal neuroprogenitor cell line that was established by immortalization using a temperature-sensitive variant of SV40 large T antigen (11Haas S.J. Wree A. J. Anat. 2002; 201: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For convenience, and because transient reductions in temperature that might be associated with large screening experiments could restore large T activity, we developed our HTS assay using undifferentiated CSM14.1 cells, with the plan to then confirm hits using differentiated cells. For monitoring cell death, we used a commercially available bioluminescence reagent that determines intracellular ATP content (ATPlite, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To trigger cell death using a stimulus known to induce ER stress, we selected thapsigargin (TG), a sesquiterpene lactone that irreversibly inhibits the Ca2+-ATPase of the ER (12Tsukamoto A. Kaneko Y. Cell Biol. Int. 1993; 17: 969-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As a positive control compound, we employed salubrinal, a compound previously reported to block ER stress-induced cell death (13Boyce M. Bryant K.F. Jousse C. Long K. Harding H.P. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Ma D. Coen D.M. Ron D. Yuan J. Science. 2005; 307: 935-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). Salubrinal (100 μm) significantly protected against TG-induced cell death using undifferentiated CSM14.1 cells and measuring ATP as a surrogate for cell viability (Fig. 1). A plate-based HTS assay was established in 96- and 384-well formats, with good assay performance characteristics (Z′ factors = 0.7) (PubChem AID = 1010 and AID = 1222). The NIH library of ∼187,265 compounds was screened at a single concentration of 20 μm (PubChem AID 1222), but no viable hits were identified. We also screened a commercially available library of 50,000 small molecule compounds (ChemBridge) at an average concentration of 15 μg/ml (∼20–50 μm), from which 198 primary hit compounds were identified using the primary HTS assay (work flow for hit evaluation is depicted in supplemental Fig. 1). Of these, 93 compounds were confirmed upon re-testing. Dose-response studies resulted in 30 compounds that displayed appropriate dose-dependent cytoprotection with EC50 values <25 μm. Fresh stocks of the 30 compounds were purchased, and 26 were confirmed to be active, with similar potency to the originally tested material, whereas 4 showed only weak activity. All 26 active compounds were confirmed to be cytoprotective for undifferentiated CSM14.1 cells treated with TG by an orthogonal assay, in which cell viability was assessed by staining of cells with fluorescein-conjugated annexin V. Cheminformatics data analysis revealed that 11 of the 26 confirmed hits constituted a series of 11 structurally related benzodiazepinones (EC50 values ranging from 10 to 25 μm), and thus we focused our efforts on this compound series. Compound CID-2891837 was the most potent (EC50 = 7.1 μm) of the 11 benzodiazepinones (Fig. 1B and Table 1) (PubChem-1247). To confirm the activity of the 11 benzodiazepinone compounds, we tested their efficiency for protecting differentiated neuronal CMS14.1 cells against TG-induced cell death. Although all of them showed cytoprotective activity, 2 of the 11 benzodiazepinone derivatives (CID-2882794, CID-2891579; hits 10 and 18) were less active when tested in differentiated CSM14.1 cells (supplemental Fig. 2), and thus we focused on the remaining nine compounds.TABLE 1Structures of cytoprotective benzodiazepinones Undifferentiated CSM14.1 cells were treated with thapsigargin (15 μm) and with various concentrations of hit compounds (PubChem, pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Cellular ATP levels were measured in triplicate, and data were normalized to calculate the mean (±S.D.) concentration of compounds required to maintain 50% cell survival following treatment with thapsigargin (EC50). Shaded region (bottom) indicates inactive and white (top) represents active compounds. The structure of the benzodiazepinone (BZD) scaffold is presented, indicating seven diversity positions (R1–R7). The structure of compound CID-2879344 is also shown. Open table in a new tab To establish that the hit compound series displayed a clear structure-activity relationship, 41 analogues of CID-2891837 were acquired from commercial sources (data not shown). Compounds were tested using TG-treated undifferentiated CSM14.1 cells, measuring viability based on ATP levels, and rank-ordered according to potency. The initial benzodiazepinone pharmacophore has two aryl rings (A and B) with multiple diversity positions (R1–R7) as illustrated in Table 1. Preliminary analysis of structure-activity relationships across the analogues suggests that the benzodiazepinone scaffold tolerates a number of different substituents on either of the pendant aryl rings A and B without loss of cytoprotective activity. The structure-activity relationship is rather flat, with EC50 values of the active analogues (EI-1 to EI-21) ranging from ∼7 to 24 μm. Within the series of active analogues aryl ring A may be unsubstituted, mono-, or di-substituted with methoxy or may be replaced entirely with dimethyl, as in CID-2879344. Any of the positions on aryl ring B (R3–R7) may be substituted to give active analogues, with favored substituents, including methyl, halogen, trifluoromethyl, phenyl, alkoxy, phenoxy, and thiomethyl. Interestingly, however, the inactive analogues (IA-1 to IA-5) are either substituted at the para position (R5) of aryl ring B, contain a polar substituent such as OH (as in IA-1), or aryl ring B is electron-deficient pyridyl (as in IA-5). Although we currently do not have any data on the relative ability of the compounds to enter the cells, lack of cell penetration may in part explain the inactivity of compounds IA-1 to IA-5 (Table 1). Benzodiazepinone Compounds Selectively Inhibit ER Stress-induced Cell Death—Cell death can be initiated from several locations in cells, besides the ER, and ER stress can be induced by many stimuli, besides TG. To determine whether the benzodiazepinone derivatives are general inhibitors of cell death versus ER-selective or thapsigargin-specific inhibitors, we compared their cytoprotective activity when CSM14.1 cells were challenged with a variety of cell death-inducing stimuli, including tunicamycin (N-linked glycosylation inhibitor and inducer of ER stress), VP16/etoposide (DNA-damaging agent, which activates mitochondrial pathways for cell death), staurosporine (STS) (broad spectrum protein kinase inhibitor), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (which activates a plasma membrane death receptor). When tested on undifferentiated CSM14.1 cells, the 11 active benzodiazepinone compounds inhibited tunicamycin-induced cell death, but did not inhibit cell death triggered by VP16, STS, or TNF (Fig. 2A). An example of flow cytometry analysis of FITC-annexin V staining is shown in Fig. 2B, for undifferentiated CSM14.1 cells cultured with DMSO solvent control versus compound CID-2891837, and treated with various cell death stimuli. Thus, the benzodiazepinone compound series appears to be selective for suppression of cell death induced by ER stress. For comparison, salubrinal was tested against the same cell death-inducing reagents. Similar to our hit compounds, salubrinal did not protect against cell death induced by VP16, STS, or TNF/CHX, although it did inhibit cell death induced by the ER stress-inducing agent TG (supplemental Fig. 10). To explore the range of cell types in which the benzodiazepinone compounds show cytoprotective activity, we tested seven different cell lines under 10 conditions with respect to cell death induced by TG (supplemental Table 1). For all experiments, compounds were tested at a concentration of 25 μm. In addition to the aforementioned results for undifferentiated and differentiated CSM14.1 rat neuronal cells, the benzodiazepinone compounds showed cytoprotective activity (≥40% survival compared with DMSO control) for HeLa (human cervical carcinoma) (9/11 compounds), PPC1 (human prostate cancer) (10/11 compounds), and SW1 (mouse melanoma) (6/11 compounds) cells (Fig. 2C and data not shown). In other neuronal cell lines such as differentiated PC12 (rat pheochromocytoma), and differentiated C17.2 (mice neuronal stem cell), the hit compounds showed more variable activity. In differentiated PC12 cells, 2 were active (>40% survival), 4 were partially active (20–40% more survival), and 5 were inactive (supplemental Table 1). In differentiated C17.2 cells, 1 was active (>40% survival), whereas others showed no activity. Moreover, when applied"
https://openalex.org/W2008191260,"Background Overexpression of RRM1 and RRM2 has been associated with gemcitabine resistance. BRCA1 overexpression increases sensitivity to paclitaxel and docetaxel. We have retrospectively examined the effect of RRM1, RRM2 and BRCA1 expression on outcome to gemcitabine plus docetaxel in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Methodology and Principal Findings Tumor samples were collected from 102 chemotherapy-naïve advanced NSCLC patients treated with gemcitabine plus docetaxel as part of a randomized trial. RRM1, RRM2 and BRCA1 mRNA levels were assessed by quantitative PCR and correlated with response, time to progression and survival. As BRCA1 levels increased, the probability of response increased (Odds Ratio [OR], 1.09: p = 0.01) and the risk of progression decreased (hazard ratio [HR], 0.99; p = 0.36). As RRM1 and RRM2 levels increased, the probability of response decreased (RRM1: OR, 0.97; p = 0.82; RRM2: OR, 0.94; p<0.0001) and the risk of progression increased (RRM1: HR, 1.02; p = 0.001; RRM2: HR, 1.005; p = 0.01). An interaction observed between BRCA1 and RRM1 allowed patients to be classified in three risk groups according to combinations of gene expression levels, with times to progression of 10.13, 4.17 and 2.30 months (p = 0.001). Low BRCA1 expression was the only factor significantly associated with longer time to progression in 31 patients receiving cisplatin-based second-line therapy. Conclusions The mRNA expression of BRCA1, RRM1 and RRM2 is potentially a useful tool for selecting NSCLC patients for individualized chemotherapy and warrants further investigation in prospective studies."

Our recent proteomic observations revealed strikingly extensive O-GlcNAc modification of several proteins that function in regulating synaptic vesicle (SV) availability for release. For example, the presynaptic proteins synapsin and Bassoon, critical in regulating SV pools, are O-GlcNAc modified at 7 and 19 unique sites, respectively (14Vosseller K. Trinidad J.C. Chalkley R.J. Specht C.G. Thalhammer A. Lynn A.J. Snedecor J.O. Guan S. Medzihradszky K.F. Maltby D.A. Schoepfer R. Burlingame A.L. Mol. Cell.

These observations are consistent with immunoelectron microscopy showing 5-fold more intensity of O-GlcNAc localization presynaptically versus postsynaptically in rat cerebellar cortex (11Akimoto Y. Comer F.I. Cole R.N. Kudo A. Kawakami H. Hirano H. Hart G.W. Brain Res. 2003; 966: 194-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), with staining being most intense surrounding SVs. The evidence strongly suggests evolutionarily conserved functional roles for O-GlcNAc in synaptic transmission, but this has not been examined. OGT and O-GlcNAc are most abundant in hippocampus (16Liu K. Paterson A.J. Zhang F. McAndrew J. Fukuchi K. Wyss J.M. Peng L. Hu Y. Kudlow J.E. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 1044-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), a brain region implicated in learning and memory through forms of synaptic plasticity such as long term potentiation (LTP). LTP is an activity-dependent strengthening of synaptic responses thought to be an electrophysiological correlate to some forms of learning/memory. Phosphorylation is a critical mechanism regulating synaptic processes. For example, hippocampal LTP involves phosphorylation/activation of kinases such as CaM kinase II, p42/44 Erk (MAPK 1/2), and PKA (17Miyamoto E. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2006; 100: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 18Giovannini M.G. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 17: 619-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Although postsynaptic mechanisms are critical to LTP-based learning and memory (19Martin S.J. Grimwood P.D. Morris R.G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 649-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (2074) Google Scholar), presynaptic mechanisms, including synapsin phosphorylation, have been implicated in hippocampal LTP (20Kushner S.A.

Synapsins I/II tether SVs to the actin cytoskeleton, limiting their availability for release. During synaptic activity, Synapsins I/II are phosphorylated, dissociate from vesicles, and thus promote vesicle availability for release (24Hilfiker S. Pieribone V.A. Czernik A.J. Kao H.T.

Synapsin I and II have been linked to activity-dependent increased SV release probability in hippocampal synaptic plasticity (27Jensen V. Walaas S.I. Hilfiker S. Ruiz A. Hvalby O. J. Physiol.

O-GlcNAc may compete directly with phosphorylation at specific serines and threonines (31Chou T.Y. Hart G.W. Dang C.V. J. Biol.

Alternatively, O-GlcNAc may contribute to up-regulation of phosphorylation events (34Kneass Z.T. Marchase R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14579-14585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Given the potential for interplay between O-GlcNAc and phosphorylation (35Kamemura K. Hart G.W. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 73: 107-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), O-GlcNAc may modulate phosphorylation-based signaling in synaptic processes. Here we utilize acute hippocampal slice electrophysiology to examine the influence of modulating O-GlcNAc levels on synaptic transmission/plasticity and functionally related phosphorylation events. Reagents—Antibodies used in Western blotting were as follows: anti-synaptophysin mouse monoclonal IgG (Chemicon, Temecula, CA); anti-O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) rabbit polyclonal (kind gift of Gerald Hart, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore); anti-O-GlcNAc (110.6) IgM monoclonal (36Comer F.I. Vosseller K. Wells L. Accavitti M.A. Hart G.W. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar); anti-active CaM kinase II (Thr(P)286) (Promega, Madison, WI); rabbit polyclonal IgG anti-synapsin (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA); rabbit polyclonal IgG anti-phospho-synapsin (Ser9) (Cell Signaling); rabbit polyclonal IgG anti-phospho-Ser62/67 synapsin (PhosphoSolutions, Aurora, CO); rabbit polyclonal IgG anti-ERK 1/2 (Promega, Madison, WI); rabbit polyclonal IgG and anti-ERK 1/2 (pTpY185/187) rabbit polyclonal IgG (BIOSOURCE). The pharmacological inhibitor of O-GlcNA-case 9d was synthesized as described (37Macauley M.S. Whitworth G.E. Debowski A.W. Chin D. Vocadlo D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25313-25322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Pharmacological Treatments and Hippocampal Slice Preparation—Male mice (6–8 weeks old) were intravenously injected in the tail vein with 9d (75 mg/kg) in saline or with saline alone for controls for the time indicated. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated, and the brains were rapidly removed into ice-cold glycerol/artificial cerebrospinal fluid (glycerol/ACSF) (130 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm KCl, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 1.5 mm MgSO4·7H2O, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 24 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm glucose, 260 mm glycerol) gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2. The hippocampus was removed, and transverse slices, 400 μm thick, were cut on a tissue chopper (Vibratome, St. Louis, MO). Control slices were placed in ACSF without glycerol, whereas hippocampal slices from 9d-injected mice were placed in ACSF containing 200 μm 9d. The slices were incubated in a water bath (33 °C) and were continuously gassed in 95% oxygen and 5% CO2 for 1 h. Slices were either then used for electrophysiological recordings or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent lysis and Western blotting. Electrophysiology—Electrophysiological studies were done as described previously (38Baratta M.V. Lamp T. Tallent M.K. J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 88: 3078-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 39Qiu C. Zeyda T. Johnson B. Hochgeschwender U. de Lecea L. Tallent M.K. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3567-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, hippocampal slices were placed in the recording chamber, and the slices were completely submerged and continuously superfused with gassed ACSF (31 °C) at a constant rate (2 ml/min) for the remainder of the experiment. We acquired data with an Axoclamp 2B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Foster City, CA) by digital/analogue sampling (20 kHz) using pCLAMP acquisition software (Molecular Devices). Extracellular field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded in the stratum radiatum using a glass micropipette filled with ACSF. We evoked orthodromic Schaffer collateral synaptic responses at 0.05 Hz with a bipolar tungsten stimulating electrode placed in the stratum radiatum. The stimulus duration was 100 μs. Stable base-line fEPSPs were confirmed by stimulating at 40–50% maximal field amplitude for 20–30 min prior to beginning experiments. We generated LTP with two trains of high frequency stimulus (HFS) of 1 s each at 100 Hz, 20 s apart, using the test stimulus intensity. Alternatively, to test for LTP enhancement, we used a single HFT. Test responses at 40–50% of maximal amplitudes were acquired for 15 min prior to (base line) and 60 min following trains. The mean initial slopes (between the 0 and 50% points on the rising phase) of two averaged fEPSPs were compared between the slice groups over the 60 min following LTP generation. Statistical analysis of electrophysiology experiments was done using analysis of variance with repeated measures. Data are represented as means ± S.E. Synaptosome Fractionation—Synaptosome fractions were prepared essentially as described (40Dunkley P.R. Jarvie P.E. Heath J.W. Kidd G.J. Rostas J.A. Brain Res. 1986; 372: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Hippocampus was homogenized in 0.32 m sucrose using a glass Teflon tissue grinder and centrifuged at 2,600 × g for 2 min. Supernatants were collected and spun at 14,500 × g for 12 min to obtain pellet P2. P2 was processed by layering over a Percoll gradient comprising 23, 10, and 3% Percoll solutions, and the synaptosome-enriched fraction was recovered at the 23 to 10% interface. The preparations were washed into oxygenated HEPES-buffered saline (142 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 1.2 mm K2HPO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm d-glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) and collected by centrifugation. Tissue Lysis and Western Blotting—Samples for Western blotting of hippocampal slices and fractions from synaptosome preparation were obtained by lysis in 6 m urea buffer containing 200 mm Tris, pH 7.8, and 5 mm EDTA added to two slices and subjected to sonication with a microtip on ice using a Branson Sonifier 250. (Duty cycle %: 20, output control: 2, 10 pulses per sample.) Samples were clarified at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Protein levels in the supernatant were determined by a protein assay (Bio-Rad). For O-GlcNAc Western blotting, 40 μg of sample was loaded on precast 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (BioRad), whereas for all other blotting, 10 μg of sample was loaded per lane. Protein was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride for Western blotting. Densitometry of bands on Western blots was performed on the Alpha Innotech-AlphaImager™ 3400 (San Leandro, CA). Immunoprecipitation—Whole hippocampus was placed in 100 μl of RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl containing phosphatase inhibitor mixture I and II (Sigma) and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Samples were sonicated on ice as described for hippocampal slice lysis, left on ice for 10 min, and clarified at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants were precleared with agarose-bound protein A/G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and immunoprecipitations were performed using 3 μg of anti-synapsin (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) and 30 μl of a 50% slurry of agarose-bound protein A/G. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in ice-cold RIPA buffer and eluted by boiling in 2× SDS sample buffer. OGT and O-GlcNAc Enrichment at Hippocampal Synapses—Previous O-GlcNAc proteomic analysis of whole brain post-synaptic density preparations (14Vosseller K. Trinidad J.C. Chalkley R.J. Specht C.G. Thalhammer A. Lynn A.J. Snedecor J.O. Guan S. Medzihradszky K.F. Maltby D.A. Schoepfer R. Burlingame A.L. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2006; 5: 923-934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), O-GlcNAc immunohistochemistry of cerebellar neurons (11Akimoto Y. Comer F.I. Cole R.N. Kudo A. Kawakami H. Hirano H. Hart G.W. Brain Res. 2003; 966: 194-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and biochemical fractionation (10Cole R.N. Hart G.W. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1080-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) suggest enrichment of O-GlcNAc at brain synapses. We examined this in mouse hippocampus by Western blotting of increasingly enriched synaptosomal fractions from 6- to 8-week-old male C57Bl6/J mice. Equal amounts of whole hippocampal initial homogenate, a crude endosomal pellet (P2), a synaptosomal fraction, or supernatant from the P2 preparation (S2) were separated by SDS-PAGE for Western blotting. As expected, the synaptosomal marker synaptophysin was strongly enriched in synaptosomes, indicating successful fractionation (Fig. 1). Additionally, enrichment of OGT in synaptosomes was also observed (Fig. 1), indicating concentration of OGT at hippocampal nerve terminals. Consistent with this observation, increased O-GlcNAc reactivity patterns (particularly at high molecular weights) are observed in the synaptosome fraction, with several O-GlcNAc reactive bands being detected exclusively in synaptosomes (Fig. 1). Pharmacological in Vivo Elevation of O-GlcNAc Alters Synaptic Plasticity in Hippocampal Slices—To examine potential functional roles of O-GlcNAc at neuronal synapses, we first examined effects of modulating O-GlcNAc in vivo on electrophysiological responses in acute hippocampal slices. We tested the ability of an O-GlcNAcase inhibitor (9d) (37Macauley M.S. Whitworth G.E. Debowski A.W. Chin D. Vocadlo D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25313-25322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) to pharmacologically elevate in vivo O-GlcNAc levels. 6–8-Week-old male C57BL6/J mice were injected intravenously in the tail vein with 75 mg/kg of 9d or with saline vehicle, and the hippocampus was dissected for determination of O-GlcNAc levels by Western blotting at 3, 5, and 7 h. Maximal O-GlcNAc elevation occurred between 5 and 7 h, whereas levels of the presynaptic marker synaptophysin were unchanged (Fig. 2A). Dose-response studies indicated that 75 mg/kg 9d was the lowest dose for inducing maximal O-GlcNAc levels (data not shown). Following in vivo elevation of O-GlcNAc by 5 h 9d intravenous treatment (Fig. 2B), the slope of fEPSPs evoked by varied stimulus intensities at the CA1 Shaffer collateral pathway (input-output analysis) in acute hippocampal slices was unchanged (n = 7 after 9d; n = 8 for control; Fig. 2C). The range of stimulus intensities used to evoke threshold, half-maximal, and maximal fEPSPs and to generate LTP was also not different between control and 9d slices (p = 0.5). PPF, a form of short term facilitation of synaptic transmission attributed to presynaptic mechanisms, was significantly decreased at 15- (p = 0.006) and 100-ms (p = 0.043) interstimulus intervals in hippocampal slices from 9d-treated mice (Fig. 2E). With an interstimulus interval of 50 ms, PPF was not significantly different between control and 9d slices (p = 0.246). In control slices, the ratio of slope of the 2nd fEPSP to the 1st was 1.9 ± 0.14, 1.9 ± 0.10, and 1.8 ± 0.13 at 15-, 50-, and 100-ms interstimulus intervals, respectively. In slices from 9D-treated mice, the ratio of the 2nd to the 1st fEPSP slope was 1.5 ± 0.11, 1.7 ± 0.10, and 1.5 ± 0.03 at 15-, 50-, and 100-ms interstimulus intervals, respectively. The level of LTP measured as percent increase in base-line slope of fEPSPs induced by a single train of stimuli at 100 Hz was enhanced significantly over 60 min by 9d treatment (Fig. 2D, p = 0.03). 60 min following the train, the initial slope of fEPSPs recorded from control slices was increased by 47 ± 14% (n = 8) relative to the base-line pre-train value. In slices from 9d-treated animals (n = 7), the initial slope of the fEPSP was increased by 77 ± 10% 60 min following the train. Short term potentiation (STP) measured from 1 to 5 min following the train was also significantly increased in 9d-treated mice compared with control mice (p = 0.007). 1 min following the train, fEPSP slope was increased by 215 ± 14% in control mice and 322 ± 24% in 9d-treated mice. Because STP is mediated by presynaptic mechanisms (41Lauri S.E. Palmer M. Segerstrale M. Vesikansa A. Taira T. Collingridge G.L. Neuropharmacology. 2007; 52: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), these results suggest that 9d treatment results in an increase in presynaptic function. Pharmacological Reduction of O-GlcNAc Levels Inhibits LTP—Alloxan is an inhibitor of OGT (42Konrad R.J. Zhang F. Hale J.E. Knierman M.D. Becker G.W. Kudlow J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and has been used to reduce levels of O-GlcNAc in cells (43Dehennaut V. Lefebvre T. Sellier C. Leroy Y. Gross B. Walker S.

Physiol. 2007; 292: C178-C187Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We incubated acute hippocampal slices in ACSF for 4 h with a concentration of alloxan previously shown to maximally reduce O-GlcNAc levels in cells (5 mm) or with 5 mm of the analogue uracil (which lacks OGT inhibitory action) (42Konrad R.J. Zhang F. Hale J.E. Knierman M.D. Becker G.W. Kudlow J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) as a control. Alloxan (n = 8) reduced O-GlcNAc levels (Fig. 3A) but had no effect compared with uracil (n = 8) on basal CA1 Shaffer collateral pathway basic synaptic transmission as measured by the input-output in response to different stimulus intensities (Fig. 3B, p = 0.26). The stimulus intensities used to generate the input-output relationship was also not affected by alloxan treatment (p = 0.4). Furthermore, alloxan treatment did not affect PPF using interstimulus intervals from 15 to 100 ms (Fig. 3C, p = 0.614). However, pretreatment with alloxan strongly inhibited LTP measured as percent increase in baseline slope of fEPSPs (Fig. 3D, p = 0.021). In uracil-treated slices, 60 min following LTP induction, the fEPSP slope was increased by 41 ± 12% relative to the base line (n = 8). However, in alloxan-treated slices, only a 9.5 ± 3.7% increase in fEPSP slope remained 60 min following the trains (n = 8). When fEPSP slopes from 51 to 60 min following the train are compared with the base line, no significant enhancement is present in alloxan-treated mice (p = 0.08), whereas uracil-treated slices show significant enhancement (p = 0.005). Thus, blocking O-GlcNAc elevation with alloxan prevents generation of LTP. The results show that SC CA1 hippocampal LTP is enhanced by pharmacological elevation of O-GlcNAc and is reciprocally inhibited by pharmacological reduction of O-GlcNAc levels. Elevation of O-GlcNAc Levels Increases Synapsin Phosphorylation—The influences of O-GlcNAc elevation on synaptic plasticity could be linked to effects on phosphorylation-based signaling known to function in synaptic transmission/LTP. As synapsins are among the most extensively O-GlcNAc-modified proteins (14Vosseller K. Trinidad J.C. Chalkley R.J. Specht C.G. Thalhammer A. Lynn A.J. Snedecor J.O. Guan S. Medzihradszky K.F.

Nature. 2002; 415: 277-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and because altered PPF in response to 9d treatment suggested presynaptic influences (Fig. 2E), we examined the effects of in vivo pharmacological elevation of O-GlcNAc on synapsin phosphorylation. Known sites of synapsin phosphorylation and O-GlcNAc modifications, and the enzymes thought to catalyze addition of these modifications, are depicted in Fig. 4. Elevation of O-GlcNAc in acute hippocampal slices was achieved as in electrophysiological studies, except that slices were lysed and examined by Western blotting using antibodies specific for total Synapsin I/II levels and synapsin phosphorylation events at serine 9 (P-site 1) and serines 62/67 (P-site 3 and 4). Elevation of O-GlcNAc levels in response to 9d treatment was confirmed (Fig. 5A). Additionally, immunoprecipitated Synapsin I from hippocampal lysates of 9d-treated mice was modified by increased levels of O-GlcNAc (Fig. 5B). 9d treatment of mice had no effect on total Synapsin I/II protein levels, but phosphorylation of synapsin at both serine 9 and serines 62/67 was increased in response to elevation of O-GlcNAc (Fig. 5A). Densitometry was used to quantify changes in intensity of Synapsin IA-phosphorylated bands from nine independent experiments (Fig. 5C). Serine 9 and serine 62/67 phosphorylation in 9d-treated samples was increased relative to total synapsin levels by 160 and 104%, respectively.FIGURE 5In vivo pharmacol"
https://openalex.org/W1979532594,"Renin angiotensin system (RAS) regulates circulating blood volume and blood pressure systemically, whereas RAS also plays a role in the local milieu. Previous in vitro studies suggested that RAS may be involved in the regulation of bone cells. However, it was not known whether molecules involved in RAS are present in bone in vivo. In this study, we examined the presence of RAS components in adult bone and the effects of angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor blocker on bone mass. Immunohistochemistry revealed that AT2 receptor protein was expressed in both osteoblasts and osteoclasts. In addition, renin and angiotensin II-converting enzyme were expressed in bone cells in vivo. Treatment with AT2 receptor blocker significantly enhanced the levels of bone mass, and this effect was based on the enhancement of osteoblastic activity as well as the suppression of osteoclastic activity in vivo. These results indicate that RAS components are present in adult bone and that blockade of AT2 receptor results in alteration in bone mass."
https://openalex.org/W2018225292,"Specification of the appropriate neurotransmitter is a crucial step in neuronal differentiation because it enables signalling among populations of neurons. Experimental manipulations demonstrate that both autonomous and activity-dependent genetic programs contribute to this process during development, but whether natural environmental stimuli specify transmitter expression in a neuronal population is unknown. We investigated neurons of the ventral suprachiasmatic nucleus that regulate neuroendocrine pituitary function in response to light in teleosts, amphibia and primates. Here we show that altering light exposure, which changes the sensory input to the circuit controlling adaptation of skin pigmentation to background, changes the number of neurons expressing dopamine in larvae of the amphibian Xenopus laevis in a circuit-specific and activity-dependent manner. Neurons newly expressing dopamine then regulate changes in camouflage colouration in response to illumination. Thus, physiological activity alters the numbers of behaviourally relevant amine-transmitter-expressing neurons in the brain at postembryonic stages of development. The results may be pertinent to changes in cognitive states that are regulated by biogenic amines."
https://openalex.org/W2071320656,"The molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic exocytosis in the hair cell, the auditory and vestibular receptor cell, are not well understood. Otoferlin, a C2 domain-containing Ca2+-binding protein, has been implicated as having a role in vesicular release. Mutations in the OTOF gene cause nonsyndromic deafness in humans, and OTOF knock-out mice are deaf. In the present study, we generated otoferlin fusion proteins containing two of the same amino acid substitutions detected in DFNB9 patients (P1825A in C2F and L1011P in C2D). The native otoferlin C2F domain bound syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 in a Ca2+-dependent manner (with optimal 61 μm free Ca2+ required for binding). These interactions were greatly diminished for C2F with the P1825A mutation, possibly because of a reduction in tertiary structural change, induced by Ca2+, for the mutated C2F compared with the native C2F. The otoferlin C2D domain also bound syntaxin 1A, but with weaker affinity (Kd = 1.7 × 10–5m) than for the C2F interaction (Kd = 2.6 × 10–9m). In contrast, it was the otoferlin C2D domain that bound the Cav1.3 II-III loop, in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The L1011P mutation in C2D rendered this binding insensitive to Ca2+ and considerably diminished. Overall, we demonstrated that otoferlin interacts with two main target-SNARE proteins of the hair-cell synaptic complex, syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25, as well as the calcium channel, with the otoferlin C2F and C2D domains of central importance for binding. Because mutations in the otoferlin C2 domains that cause deafness in humans impair the ability of otoferlin to bind syntaxin, SNAP-25, and the Cav1.3 calcium channel, it is these interactions that may mediate regulation by otoferlin of hair cell synaptic exocytosis critical to inner ear hair cell function. The molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic exocytosis in the hair cell, the auditory and vestibular receptor cell, are not well understood. Otoferlin, a C2 domain-containing Ca2+-binding protein, has been implicated as having a role in vesicular release. Mutations in the OTOF gene cause nonsyndromic deafness in humans, and OTOF knock-out mice are deaf. In the present study, we generated otoferlin fusion proteins containing two of the same amino acid substitutions detected in DFNB9 patients (P1825A in C2F and L1011P in C2D). The native otoferlin C2F domain bound syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 in a Ca2+-dependent manner (with optimal 61 μm free Ca2+ required for binding). These interactions were greatly diminished for C2F with the P1825A mutation, possibly because of a reduction in tertiary structural change, induced by Ca2+, for the mutated C2F compared with the native C2F. The otoferlin C2D domain also bound syntaxin 1A, but with weaker affinity (Kd = 1.7 × 10–5m) than for the C2F interaction (Kd = 2.6 × 10–9m). In contrast, it was the otoferlin C2D domain that bound the Cav1.3 II-III loop, in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The L1011P mutation in C2D rendered this binding insensitive to Ca2+ and considerably diminished. Overall, we demonstrated that otoferlin interacts with two main target-SNARE proteins of the hair-cell synaptic complex, syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25, as well as the calcium channel, with the otoferlin C2F and C2D domains of central importance for binding. Because mutations in the otoferlin C2 domains that cause deafness in humans impair the ability of otoferlin to bind syntaxin, SNAP-25, and the Cav1.3 calcium channel, it is these interactions that may mediate regulation by otoferlin of hair cell synaptic exocytosis critical to inner ear hair cell function. Calcium is a key regulator of synaptic vesicle fusion (reviewed in Ref. 1Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 509-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar). In mechanosensory hair cells, calcium microdomains (2Tucker T. Fettiplace R. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1323-1335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and possibly nanodomains (3Brandt A. Khimich D. Moser T. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11577-11585Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) are formed when voltage-gated calcium channels open upon depolarization. Calcium at these sites is thought to activate protein interactions, leading to vesicle fusion. Some of the key players in this process are the target-SNARE 2The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; 3-AT, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HBS-E, HEPES-buffered saline with EDTA; HBS-EP, HEPES-buffered saline with EDTA and phosphate; HBS-P, HEPES-buffered saline with phosphate; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PBST, phosphate-buffered saline with Tween 20; RU, response unit; SPR, surface plasmon resonance.2The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; 3-AT, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HBS-E, HEPES-buffered saline with EDTA; HBS-EP, HEPES-buffered saline with EDTA and phosphate; HBS-P, HEPES-buffered saline with phosphate; IPTG, isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PBST, phosphate-buffered saline with Tween 20; RU, response unit; SPR, surface plasmon resonance. proteins, syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25, and the vesicle-SNARE, synaptobrevin (4Chapman E.R. Hanson P.I. An S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23667-23671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Vesicle-SNARE synaptotagmin 1 plays a crucial role as a calcium sensor at the neuronal synapse, modulating calcium channels and vesicle release by a Ca2+-dependent interaction with other SNARE proteins in the presence of lipid molecules (4Chapman E.R. Hanson P.I. An S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23667-23671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 5Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol.

Wenthold R.J. Euro. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 803-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Instead, fast neurotransmitter release in auditory and vestibular hair cells, facilitated largely by an L-type voltagegated calcium channel, Cav1.3 (8Lewis R.S. Hudspeth A.J.

Cell. 2000; 102: 89-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar), is thought to be modulated by a newly discovered protein, otoferlin, acting as the Ca2+ sensor and vesicle-binding protein. When mutated, otoferlin causes DFNB9 nonsyndromic deafness (10Yasunaga S. Grati M. Cohen-Salmon M. El-Amraoui A. Mustapha M. Salem N. El-Zir E. Loiselet J. Petit C. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Gene sequences of different deaf families show that the OTOF gene can undergo mutation at multiple locations (11Migliosi V. Modamio-Høybjør S. Moreno-Pelayo M.A. Rodríguez-Ballesteros M. Villamar M. Tellería D. Menéndez I. Moreno F. del Castillo I. J. Med.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that otoferlin is necessary for synaptic exocytosis from hair cells (14Roux I. Safieddine S. Nouvian R. Grati M. Simmler M. Bahloul A. Perfettini I. Rostaing P. Hamard G. Triller A. Avan P. Moser T. Petit C. Cell. 2006; 127: 277-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Further, an engineered mutation in the C2B domain of otoferlin has been shown to cause deafness in mice (15Longo-Guess C. Gagnon L.H. Bergstrom D.E. Johnson K.R. Hear. Res. 2007; 234: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the precise function of otoferlin as a synaptic protein is not well understood. Specific mutations in the otoferlin C2F (P1825A) or C2D (L1011P) domains in humans have been documented to cause DFNB9 deafness (11Migliosi V. Modamio-Høybjør S. Moreno-Pelayo M.A. Rodríguez-Ballesteros M. Villamar M. Tellería D. Menéndez I. Moreno F. del Castillo I. J. Med. Genet. 2002; 39: 502-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Tekin M. Akcayoz D. Incesulu A. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2005; 138A: 6-10Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggested that a region of otoferlin containing all three C2 domains, D, E, and F, binds directly to the t-SNARE molecules syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 in response to an increase in Ca2+ concentration (14Roux I. Safieddine S. Nouvian R. Grati M. Simmler M. Bahloul A. Perfettini I. Rostaing P. Hamard G. Triller A. Avan P. Moser T. Petit C. Cell. 2006; 127: 277-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). However, it is not understood how a single amino acid substitution in one domain of otoferlin, such as C2F (11Migliosi V. Modamio-Høybjør S. Moreno-Pelayo M.A. Rodríguez-Ballesteros M. Villamar M. Tellería D. Menéndez I. Moreno F. del Castillo I. J. Med. Genet. 2002; 39: 502-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or C2D (12Tekin M. Akcayoz D. Incesulu A. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2005; 138A: 6-10Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar), might independently lead to deafness. Here, we examine the role of otoferlin as a Ca2+ sensor as well as a facilitator of vesicle fusion, as indicated by protein-protein interactions and their [Ca2+] dependence. Materials—Plasmids for hexahistidine-tagged fusion proteins, pRSET A, B, and C, and anti-Xpress antibody (raised against the sequence DLYDDDDK) were obtained from Invitrogen. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion plasmid pGEX-6P-1 and HBS-E, HBS-P, and HBS-EP buffers for surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis were from GE Healthcare. Yeast two-hybrid plasmids, pGBKT7 and pGADT7, and mouse brain cDNA were from BD-Biosciences-Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Anti-His tag monoclonal antibody (recognizing polyhistidine sequences), anti-GST antibody (against Schistosoma japonicum GST sequence), anti-syntaxin antibody, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and PBST buffer were from Sigma-Aldrich. Cloning of Otoferlin C2 Domains, Syntaxin 1A, SNAP-25, and Cav1.3 II-III Loop in pRSET Vectors—PCR primers for otoferlin C2 domains, syntaxin 1A (minus the transmembrane region), SNAP-25, and the Cav1.3 II-III loop, containing the desired restriction sites, were designed from mouse cDNA sequence (GenBank™ NM_031875, NM_016801, M22012, and NM_028981, respectively), custom-synthesized, and used in PCRs containing mouse brain cDNA as template (BD-Biosciences-Clontech). PCR products were digested with restriction enzymes and cloned into similarly digested pRSET bacterial expression vectors (Invitrogen). The plasmids were prepared in Escherichia coli DH5α cells (Invitrogen). Selected clones were sequence-verified before expression studies. Primers used for PCR (upstream, downstream) were: otoferlin C2A, TCTAGAATTCATGGCCCTGATTGTTCAC, GGATCCTAGCAGCCCATCTGTCTC; otoferlin C2B, TCTAGAATTCGACCCTGACTCCGTGTCT, GGATCCCACAGCGACATCACACTT; otoferlin C2C, TCTAGAATTCCGGTTCTATGTGAAAATTTAC, GGATCCGCCGTACATGTTCACCCA; otoferlin C2D, TCTAGAATTCGCCAAGCTGGAGCTCTAC, GGATCCCAGCTCGAAGGCAGCCAG; otoferlin C2E, TCTAGAATTCCGCATAGTAGGCCGATTC, GGATCCCCCATGGGGACCAAAGTG; otoferlin C2F, TCTAGAATTCCCGCTGCTCAACCCTGAC, GGATCCGGGCCACCAGCCTTTGAC; syntaxin 1A, ATGGAGGACCGAACCCAGGAG, CTACTTCTTCCTGCGCGC; SNAP-25, AGGATCCGATGGCCGAGGACGCAGACATG, TCGAATTCTTAACCACTTCCCAGCATCTTTGT; and the Cav1.3 II-III loop, TCAGAATTCGTGGACAATTTGGCTGAT, GGATCCAAGGTTGGTGAAGATGTG. C2 Domain Mutations—Mutations within the otoferlin C2 domains were generated in vitro in two steps by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The upstream and downstream mutated primers were: otoferlin C2D, TGGGACCAGATGCCGGTATTTGAC, GTTGTCAAATACCGGCATCTGGTC (underlined nucleotides yield Pro, CCG, substituting for Leu); and otoferlin C2F, GAGTACAAGATCGCTGCGCGGCTC, AGCCGCGCAGCGATCTTGTA (underlined nucleotides yield Ala, GCT, substituting for Pro). In the first step, each member of the mutated primer pair was coupled with the opposing downstream or upstream original C2D or C2F primer and otoferlin cDNA template to produce two smaller PCR products that each contained the mutated, complementary regions at one end. In the second step, the products were purified, mixed in equal proportion, and allowed to extend for three cycles of PCR, yielding full C2D or C2F mutated sequence. Additional original C2D or C2F upstream and downstream primers were added, and the reaction was continued. The resulting amplified products were purified and sequenced for verification of the single amino acid change, before cloning in pRSET vectors. Expression of Hexahistidine Fusion Proteins—pRSET vectors containing the desired sequences were used to transform E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. Clones were selected, and expression of fusion proteins was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl β-m-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) in LB culture medium. The cultures were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested, lysed in 10 mm phosphate buffer, 8 m urea (pH 7.4), centrifuged, and analyzed via 4–12% SDS-PAGE, with protein bands visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Clones that showed robust expression were selected and stored for future use. For purification of fusion proteins, 100–500-ml cultures of each clone were grown for 4–6 h, with protein expression induced by IPTG. The cells were harvested, lysed, and centrifuged, and the clear supernatant passed through a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity spin column (Qiagen). The columns were washed with wash buffer (10 mm phosphate, 8 m urea, pH 6.3) three times to remove nonspecific components, and the affinity-bound proteins were eluted with elution buffer (10 mm phosphate, 8 m urea, pH 4.5). For thorough removal of urea, the samples were diluted in an equal volume of PBST buffer and dialyzed extensively against PBST containing 1× protease inhibitors, with five or six buffer changes for 24 h at 4 °C and constant stirring. At the end of the dialysis, the proteins were collected from the dialysis tubes, and protein concentration was determined with the Qubit fluorescent system (Invitrogen). Purity of the proteins was ascertained by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining and Western immunoblotting using anti-His monoclonal antibody. In an alternate procedure not involving urea, cells induced with IPTG were lysed by sonication, followed by centrifugation. The clear supernatant was mixed with 0.5 ml of Talon beads (Clontech). The beads were sedimented and washed, and the bound fusion proteins were eluted by the addition of elution buffer, followed by mixing and centrifugation. The supernatant containing the fusion proteins was then exhaustively dialyzed against cold PBST buffer containing 1× protease inhibitors. Cloning of Syntaxin 1A and Cav1.3 II-III Loop in pGEX-6P-1 for Expression of GST Fusion Proteins—GST fusion proteins were prepared for pull-down assay. PCR primers for syntaxin 1A and Cav1.3 II-III loop containing the desired restriction sites were used in PCRs to clone syntaxin and the calcium channel domain in pGEX-6P-1 vector. Expression of GST Fusion Proteins—pGEX-6P-1 vectors containing syntaxin 1A or the Cav1.3 II-III loop were utilized to transform E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. The clones were selected for expression of the fusion protein by IPTG induction. Bacterial cell lysates were either used directly in pull-down assays, or the fusion products were affinity-purified using Glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—Appropriate prey and bait vectors were used to co-transform yeast strain AH109 and were incubated in a low stringency medium, SD/–Trp/–Leu, to select the double transformants. The colonies that grew were streaked onto a higher stringency medium, SD/–Trp/–Leu/–His/–Ade, containing 3 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) and grown for at least 5 days. Negative controls comprising empty bait or prey vectors were paired with vectors for their counterpart binding partners. Pull-down Assay—Pull-down assays were performed using GST fusion proteins (GST-syntaxin 1A and GST-Cav1.3 II-III loop) and hexahistidine-tagged fusion proteins (otoferlin C2 domains). GST conjugates were mixed with hexahistidine-tagged C2 domains in binding buffer (PBST buffer, pH 7.4, 1× protease inhibitor mixture) for 2 h at room temperature. Glutathione-Sepharose beads (30 μl of a 50% slurry) were added to the reaction mix for 1 h at room temperature, followed by centrifugation for 2 min at 1,000 × g. The beads were washed five times in the binding buffer, incubated at 70 °C for 5 min in gel loading buffer (30 μl), and centrifuged. The supernatant was then electrophoresed in a 4–12% NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen), electroblotted to a nylon membrane, and immunodetected using anti-Xpress antibody. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—SPR was performed with a Biacore 3000 instrument. Affinity-purified fusion proteins were immobilized on a CM5 chip (research grade; Biacore, Piscataway, NJ) by an amine-coupling reaction (16Johnsson B. Löfås S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Surface tests (17Drescher D.G. Ramakrishnan N.A. Drescher M.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 493: 323-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) were performed on each immobilized protein (ligand), with different concentrations of purified otoferlin C2 domain fusion protein (analyte). The reference surface was blocked with ethanolamine and thus contained no ligand. The response was recorded as the ligand RU minus the reference RU. Once appropriate binding and regeneration conditions were established, binding studies were performed. SPR Kinetic Measurements of Otoferlin Binding—To determine the rate and equilibrium binding constants of the interaction of otoferlin C2 domains with syntaxin 1A, SNAP-25, and the Cav1.3 II-III loop, the fusion proteins were immobilized as ligands on a CM5 chip. Otoferlin C2D and C2F domains (analytes) were diluted to a series of concentrations in HBS-P buffer, with added 61 μm Ca2+ for optimal binding. Kinetic values were determined using BIAevaluation software (Biacore), and the data were fitted with the model showing closest match (17Drescher D.G. Ramakrishnan N.A. Drescher M.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 493: 323-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A 1:1 Langmuir binding model was generally selected. However, when there was a mass transfer limitation (18Schuck P. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1230-1249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) in the binding, 1:1 binding with mass transfer was chosen. The “residuals” (19O'Shannessy D.J. Brigham-Burke M. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Brooks I. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) were checked, and the values with the lowest χ2 values were selected. Residuals reflect the deviation of the actual binding from that of the model chosen and were in the range of ±2 RU. Generally, we employed the global fitting method (20Markey F. BIA J. 1999; 1: 5-7Google Scholar), in which all the sensorgrams representing the different analyte concentrations were fitted simultaneously with the wide window of association and dissociation phases. Individual concentration curves were also evaluated to confirm the fitting data. Optical Analyses—For fluorometric analysis, 50 nm each of C2F and C2Fm in PBS (pH 7.4) were analyzed in a FluroMax-2 fluorometer (Jobin Yvon Inc., Edison, NJ) with excitation at 282 nm, and the emission was recorded from 295 to 450 nm. CD spectra were recorded with a Chirascan CD spectrometer (Applied Photophysics Ltd., Leatherhead, Surrey, UK) at 200–260 nm, using a 1-cm path length cell. The samples were diluted in 1× PBS to yield a final concentration of 20 μm, and the PBS blank was subtracted from the sample. Determination of Ca2+ Concentrations—Ca2+ concentrations of all solutions were directly checked by mass spectral analysis, because of the possibility of background Ca2+ in reagents. Thus the Ca2+ values reported in the present experiments are actual, assayed values. C2 Domains of Otoferlin—Many isoforms of otoferlin, resulting from single amino acid substitutions and truncations caused by differential splicing (12Tekin M. Akcayoz D. Incesulu A. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2005; 138A: 6-10Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar), are seen in DFNB9 patients (Fig. 1). A short otoferlin isoform in humans contains only C2D, C2E, C2F, and the transmembrane domain. It is not yet clear whether the short form or the long form of the otoferlin transcript is expressed in the human cochlea, although there are indications that the long forms are functionally important (13Yasunaga S. Grati M. Chardenoux S. Smith T.N. Friedman T.B. Lalwani A.K. Wilcox E.R. Petit C. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 591-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Otoferlin C2F Domain Directly Binds to Syntaxin 1A—In pilot studies (not illustrated), mouse otoferlin domains C2A, C2B, C2C, C2D, C2E, and C2F, cloned as bait in pGBKT7 vector, were tested in yeast strain AH 109 versus syntaxin 1A fusion protein, which was cloned as prey in pGDAT7 vector. In SD/–Trp/–His/–Ade/–Leu medium containing 2 mm 3-AT, colonies that appeared represented syntaxin 1A interaction with C2A, C2B, and C2F. Few colonies were present when C2D and C2E were used as bait. When C2A, C2B, and C2F colonies were screened in a higher stringency medium containing 3 mm 3-AT, colonies appeared only for C2F (Fig. 2A) and C2A (not illustrated). There were no colonies on control plates where either bait or prey was substituted with empty vectors. Otoferlin Domains Interact with Syntaxin 1A in Pull-down Assays—Pilot pull-down assays using GST-syntaxin 1A fusion protein and purified otoferlin-C2 domain His tag fusion proteins showed that syntaxin 1A binds C2A, C2B, and C2E (not illustrated) as well as C2F (Fig. 2B, lane 3). However, it is the C2F interaction that is strictly Ca2+-dependent (see below), unlike the interaction for C2A, C2B, and C2E where Ca2+ is not absolutely required. SPR Analysis of Otoferlin Domain-Syntaxin 1A Interactions—Interaction of the six otoferlin C2 domains with syntaxin 1A was also examined with SPR, utilizing affinity-purified fusion proteins of the C2 domains as analytes and affinity-purified syntaxin 1A fusion protein immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip as ligand. The purified C2 domains were diluted to 200 nm concentration. The C2F domain distinctly bound syntaxin 1A in SPR analysis (Fig. 2C). There was no binding when bovine serum albumin was used as a negative control (Fig. 2C, Blank). Ca2+ Sensitivity of C2F Interaction with Syntaxin 1A—We examined the binding of the purified C2F fusion protein to syntaxin 1A at various Ca2+ concentrations. No binding was observed when 200 nm C2F was analyzed in HBS-P buffer containing 3 mm EGTA (Fig. 2D, bar 1). However, a dramatic increase was observed when the C2F binding was analyzed in buffer containing 30 μm free Ca2+ (Fig. 2D, bar 2). With each increment in free Ca2+, there was a steady increase in binding that peaked at 61 μm Ca2+ (bar 7). However, there was a drop of more than 50% in the binding when the Ca2+ concentration was increased to 95 μm (bar 8), and there was no substantial decrease in binding when the level of Ca2+ was further increased to 199 and 371 μm (bars 9 and 10). The results were normalized by subtracting the SPR response (RU) for buffer alone and averaged from a single experiment performed in triplicate. All of the experiments were performed multiple times, and samples for different Ca2+ concentrations were analyzed randomly. There was no binding to the reference cell surface, which was blocked by ethanolamine. Thus the present data indicate that the C2F domain of otoferlin directly interacts with syntaxin 1A; this interaction requires free Ca2+ optimally in the range of 30–61 μm, and there is no interaction if Ca2+ is absent. The C2F domain is 98–100% conserved among the mammalian species shown in Table 1 and would be expected to interact in a similar manner in other species, including human.TABLE 1Percent identity of C2 domains across vertebratesSpeciesC2AC2BC2CC2DC2EC2FHuman (34/40331)901001001009798Rat (149050818)9410010099100100Chick (118089149)759389909494Zebrafish (113462015)749089839393Tetraodon (47224638)709091529290 Open table in a new tab To test whether C2A binding was sensitive to Ca2+, the C2A domain was diluted to 200 nm in buffer containing either 44 μm free Ca2+ or 3 mm EDTA and analyzed by SPR (Fig. 2E). There was little difference between the traces. Fig. 2F shows quantitatively that there was no significant difference in binding when free Ca2+ was absent (with EGTA, bar 1) versus present (bar 2). Thus it appears that the C2A interaction is insensitive to Ca2+, in contrast to the calcium sensitivity of the C2F interaction. C2B and C2E domains, not requiring Ca2+ for binding to syntaxin 1A in pull-down assays (above), exhibited relatively low SPR binding values, 35 and 14 RU, respectively (not illustrated). A P1825A Substitution in the C2F Domain Abolishes C2F Ca2+ Binding Affinity—To explore how a single amino acid substitution in the C2F domain might correlate with nonsyndromic deafness in humans (11Migliosi V. Modamio-Høybjør S. Moreno-Pelayo M.A. Rodríguez-Ballesteros M. Villamar M. Tellería D. Menéndez I. Moreno F. del Castillo I. J. Med. Genet. 2002; 39: 502-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we produced the same amino acid substitution (P1825A) in mouse that is known to cause deafness in humans, by oligonucleotide-directed PCR-based alteration in C2F. The purified mutant C2Fm fusion protein showed no interaction with syntaxin 1A in SPR experiments (Fig. 3, A and B), in contrast to the prominent binding of native C2F to syntaxin 1A. Pull-down assays using GST-syntaxin 1A and C2F native and C2Fm mutated forms also demonstrated that the C2Fm does not interact with syntaxin 1A (Fig. 3C). The position of the P1825A mutation in C2F lies between strands 6 and 7 (β sheet) of the secondary structure (Fig. 3D), with proline demarking a probable bend in the polypeptide chain for native C2F. Calcium Binding of the C2F Domain—The intrinsic fluorescence of the C2F domain (contributed by Trp and other aromatic amino acids; Fig. 3D) was markedly elevated with Ca2+ for native but not the mutated form. Panels E (mutated form) and F (native form) of Fig. 3 show emission spectra in the presence of 61 μm free Ca2+ (solid traces) and emission in the absence of Ca2+ (1 mm EGTA) by the dashed traces. Fig. 3E shows that the C2Fm solution does not exhibit any increase in fluorescence in the presence of 61 μm free Ca2+ compared with the absence of free Ca2+. However, for the native C2F domain, emission is clearly increased by the addition of Ca2+ toa61 μm free Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 3F, solid trace). This effect was reversed by 2 mm EGTA (dashed trace). To test whether the native state of C2 fusion protein was maintained after purification with urea-containing buffers followed by dialysis (see “Experimental Procedures”), we analyzed with circular dichroism the C2F domain fusion protein prepared under denaturing versus nondenaturing conditions (Fig. 3G). The CD spectra proved similar, suggesting that fusion proteins such as C2F extracted with urea, after exhaustive dialysis against nondenaturing buffers, were properly refolded in the present studies. The spectra show a broad minimum at 206–207 nm as well as a tendency for a minimum in the 221–222-nm region. The spectral trace was flat above 240 nm and increased below 205 nm (Fig. 3G). Ca2+ Dependence of Otoferlin C2F Binding to SNAP-25—SPR binding assays involving affinity-purified SNAP-25 as ligand and affinity-purified native and mutated C2F domains as analytes showed that the native C2F binds SNAP-25 (Fig. 4A, upper trace), whereas the mutated, C2Fm does not (lower trace). Fig. 4B illustrates that the SNAP-25-C2F binding is sensitive to Ca2+. There is minimal binding when there is no free Ca2+ (bar 1). However, when the free Ca2+ increases to 30 μm, there is an increase in binding (bar 2), and a further, almost 3-fold increase in binding when the free Ca2+ increases to 33 μm (bar 3). An additional increase in binding occurs, until the free Ca2+ concentration reaches 61 μm (bar 7). Then, when the free Ca2+ is increased further (to 95 μm), the binding drops by ∼50% and continues to decrease up to a free Ca2+ concentration of 371 μm (bar 10). Otoferlin C2D Binds to the Voltage-gated Calcium Channel's Cav1.3 II-III Loop—In pilot studies, otoferlin C2 domains A–F were constructed in pGBKT7 vector and with the Cav1.3 II-III loop prey construct were used to co-transform yeast strain AH109. In high stringency selection medium containing 3 mm 3-AT, the C2D bait, paired with Cav1.3 II-III loop prey, exhibited growth, whereas the C2D bait with the empty prey vector did not (Fig. 5A). In general, the number of colonies that developed on the selection plate indicated the strength of the interaction. Although we also detected interaction of Cav1.3 with the C2A, C2B, and C2F domains, the latter interactions were clearly weaker (not shown). Otoferlin C2D-Cav1.3 II-III loop interaction was also demonstrated in pull-down assays, where native C2D bound the GST-Cav1.3 II-III loop, yielding a prominent band on Western blot ("
https://openalex.org/W2169932685,"The enzyme norcoclaurine synthase (NCS) catalyzes the stereospecific Pictet-Spengler cyclization between dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, the key step in the benzylisoquinoline alkaloid biosynthetic pathway. The crystallographic structure of norcoclaurine synthase from Thalictrum flavum in its complex with dopamine substrate and the nonreactive substrate analogue 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde has been solved at 2.1Å resolution. NCS shares no common features with the functionally correlated “Pictet-Spenglerases” that catalyze the first step of the indole alkaloids pathways and conforms to the overall fold of the Bet v1-like protein. The active site of NCS is located within a 20-Å-long catalytic tunnel and is shaped by the side chains of a tyrosine, a lysine, an aspartic, and a glutamic acid. The geometry of the amino acid side chains with respect to the substrates reveals the structural determinants that govern the mechanism of the stereoselective Pictet-Spengler cyclization, thus establishing an excellent foundation for the understanding of the finer details of the catalytic process.

Alkaloids are among the most important plant secondary metabolites, comprising approximately 12,000 compounds grouped into several families (1Ziegler J. Facchini P.J. Annu. Rev. Plant. Biol. 2008; 59: 735-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Most alkaloids are derived from amines produced by the decarboxylation of amino acids such as histidine, lysine, ornithine, tryptophan, and tyrosine. The coupling of the amines to other metabolites represents the first step in the biosynthesis of alkaloids belonging to diverse families. So far, however, this important entry reaction has been fully characterized only for a few biosynthetic pathways.Benzylisoquinoline alkaloids are tyrosine-derived compounds and include a number of biologically active substances that are widely employed as pharmaceuticals such as morphine, codeine, berberine, papaverine, etc. The enzymatic pathways leading to the amazing diversity of benzylisoquinoline derivatives have been shown to originate from a common route in which the first committed step consists of the Pictet-Spengler condensation of dopamine with 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (4-HPAA) 2The abbreviations used are: 4-HPAA, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde; NCS, norcoclaurine synthase; SeMet, selenomethionine; PHB, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde.2The abbreviations used are: 4-HPAA, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde; NCS, norcoclaurine synthase; SeMet, selenomethionine; PHB, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. to yield the benzylisoquinoline central precursor, (S)-norcoclaurine (Fig. 1). The reaction is highly stereospecific, and the chirality of the (S)-norcoclaurine product is essential to drive the intricate pathway of substrate stereoselective enzymatic reactions toward the terminal metabolites (2Facchini P.J. St-Pierre B. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol.. 2005; 8: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 3Stadler R. Zenk M.H. Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1990; 6: 555-562Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar).The Pictet-Spengler reaction entails the acid-catalyzed electrophilic addition of an iminium ion to a substituted benzyl (benzylisoquinoline alkaloids) or indole (indole alkaloids) species. The reaction mechanism consists of a two-step process in which the iminium ion is generated first from the condensation between the aldehyde carbonyl and the phenylethyl amine (or tryptamine) substrate followed by a Mannich type cyclization to yield tetrahydro-benzylisoquinolines (or tetrahydro-β-carboline) (4Maryanoff B.E. Zhang H.C. Cohen J.H. Turchi I.J. Maryanoff C.A. Chem. Rev. 2004; 144: 1431-1628Crossref Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of (S)-strictosidine (the most important natural β-carboline), a central intermediate for indole alkaloids, have been recently characterized from the structural and mechanistic point of view. Strictosidine synthase, which catalyzes the formation of (S)-strictosidine from tryptamine and secologanin, has been cloned from Catharanthus roseus and Rauwolfia serpentina (5Kutchan T.M. Phytochemistry. 1993; 32: 493-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Co-crystallization of strictosidine synthase from R. serpentina in the presence of tryptamine or secologanin substrates yielded key structural information into substrates binding and orientation within the active site of the enzyme (6Ma X. Panjikar S. Koepke J. Loris E. Stöckigt J. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 907-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These studies provided the first example of an enzyme-catalyzed Pictet-Spengler reaction within the indole alkaloids biosynthesis.In contrast, little structural information is presently available for norcoclaurine synthases (NCS), the key enzymes in the pathway that leads to the biosynthesis of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids. NCS from Thalictrum flavum (NCS; EC 4.2.1.78) has been identified recently (7Samanani L. Facchini P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33878-33883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and has been fully characterized in terms of substrate specificity and enzymatic activity (8Samanani L. Liscombe D.K. Facchini P.J. Plant J. 2004; 40: 302-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 9Luk L.Y. Bunn S. Liscombe D.K. Facchini P.J. Tanner M.E. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 10153-10161Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The enzyme shares no sequence similarity to the functionally correlated indole alkaloid synthases, whereas it shows low (12–15% identity) but significant homology with proteins belonging to the vast family of Bet v1 and pathogen-related PR10 proteins, whose physiological functions are still poorly understood (9Luk L.Y. Bunn S. Liscombe D.K. Facchini P.J. Tanner M.E. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 10153-10161Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). NCS enzymes from T. Flavum, Papaver somniferum, Eschscholzia californica, and Coptis japonica (CjPR10A) are capable of catalyzing the Pictet-Spengler condensation of 4-HPAA with dopamine at neutral pH values and do not require any co-factor. It is worth considering that NCS activity has also been demonstrated for a distinct enzyme from C. japonica (CjNCS1) that is able to catalyze (S)-norcoclaurine synthesis by the condensation of dopamine and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate or pyruvate in addition to 4-HPAA (10Minami H. Dubouzet E. Iwasa K. Sato F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6274-6282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).Enzyme kinetics studies on T. flavum NCS demonstrated sigmoidal binding of dopamine and hyperbolic binding kinetics for 4-HPAA, thus suggesting a cooperative mechanism at the basis of the catalytic behavior in enzymes from different species (6Ma X. Panjikar S. Koepke J. Loris E. Stöckigt J. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 907-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 7Samanani L. Facchini P.J. J. Biol.

Plant J. 2004; 40: 302-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). At present, however, the structural basis of NCS catalytic mechanism remains elusive. A first clue on the overall structure and catalytic site has been obtained by NMR investigations coupled to homology modeling on structurally related proteins (11Berkner H. Schweimer K. Matecko I. Rösch P. Biochem. J. 2008; 413: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The overall α-carbon backbone was shown to conform to the fold of the major birch allergen protein Bet v-1, but the substrate binding site and amino acid side chains relevant for catalysis have not been assigned with certainty. So far, it is also unclear whether the enzyme is assembled in a quaternary structure that could explain the reported cooperativity. In fact, the association state in solution has been reported to be dimeric in gel filtration measurements, whereas NMR investigations indicated that the protein is mostly monomeric (7Samanani L. Facchini P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33878-33883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 11Berkner H. Schweimer K. Matecko I. Rösch P. Biochem. J. 2008; 413: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).In the present work, we report the first crystallographic structure of NCS from T. flavum in its complex with dopamine and the nonreactive substrate analogue 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (PHB). The x-ray data unveil the geometry of the active site and indicate clearly the nature of the structural determinants that govern the asymmetric Pictet-Spengler condensation at the basis of (S)-norcoclaurine synthesis. Determination of the catalytic activity in site-specific mutants confirms the roles of the catalytically competent residues identified by the x-ray data.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification of SeMet Derivative—The expression of the SeMet NCS protein was designed, synthesized, and optimized for Escherichia coli codon usage by the Gene Optimizer Assisted Sequence Analysis (Genart-Ag). The NCS protein truncated at the first 19 amino acids (12Pasquo A. Bonamore A. Franceschini S. Macone A. Boffi A. Ilari A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Crystallogr. Commun. 2008; 64: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), with a N-terminal MTGS sequence and a His tag at the C terminus was subcloned into the NdeI and XhoI restriction site of the vector pET22-b. Transformation of chemically competent E. coli strain BL21DE3 and protein expression have been performed as described by Pasquo et al. (12Pasquo A. Bonamore A. Franceschini S. Macone A. Boffi A. Ilari A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Crystallogr. Commun. 2008; 64: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The protein has been purified using a 5-ml HisTrap Fast Flow column (GE) equilibrated with a 50 mm Tris HCl buffer at pH 7.5. A linear gradient of imidazole concentration from 0 to 0.5 m (buffered at pH 7.5) was applied. The protein eluted at an imidazole concentration comprised between 0.25 and 0.30 m (12Pasquo A. Bonamore A. Franceschini S. Macone A. Boffi A. Ilari A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Crystallogr. Commun. 2008; 64: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Crystallization—SeMet NCS crystals grew under conditions similar to those identified for the His-tagged wild type protein (12Pasquo A. Bonamore A. Franceschini S. Macone A. Boffi A. Ilari A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Crystallogr. Commun. 2008; 64: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was ∼11 mg/ml, and crystallization buffer was 0.1 m acetate buffer at pH 4 containing 1.4 m ammonium sulfate and 0.2 m sodium chloride. Crystallization temperature was 298 K. The SeMet crystals were cryo-protected in a solution containing 75% v/v of the reservoir solution and 25% v/v of glycerol and mounted on nylon loops. Then the crystals were flash-frozen by quick submersion into liquid nitrogen.Data Collection and Data Analysis of the SeMet Derivative—A three-wavelength multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction data set was collected from SeMet-NCS on the ID14-2 beamline at the synchrotron radiation source Berliner Elektronenspeicherring-Gesellschaft für Synchrotronstrahlung (Berlin, Germany), using a CCD detector. Complete data sets (120° of φ rotation each) were collected at the peak (λ = 0.97966 Å), inflection (λ = 0.97984 Å), and remote (λ = 0.97800 Å) wavelengths, at a temperature of 100 K. Each frame was collected with an exposure time of 2 s and a 1.0° oscillation range.The three data sets were processed with DENZO (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38361) Google Scholar) and scaled with SCALEPACK (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38361) Google Scholar). The three-wavelengths multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction data set of SeMet-NCS was further scaled and analyzed with SCALEIT from the CCP4 suite (14Cowtan K. Jnt. CCP4/ESF–EACBM Newsl. Protein Crystallogr. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar). The autoindexing procedure indicated that the crystals belonged to the trigonal space group P3121 with unit cell dimensions a = b = 86.31 Å, c = 118.36 Å, α = β = 90°, γ = 120°. All three of the data sets were more than 96% complete with Rmerge values below 10%. All of the statistics of the scaling procedure are reported in Table 1. A value of Vm = 2.89 Å3 Da–1 has been calculated according to Matthews (15Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7899) Google Scholar), assuming 6 asymmetric units within the unit cell. Each asymmetric unit contained two monomers with molecular masses of 24 kDa each.TABLE 1Crystal parameters, data collection, and refinement statistics of the SeMet norcoclaurine synthase (SeMet NCS) and of SeMet norcoclaurine synthase in complex with dopamine and hydroxybenzaldehyde (Complex)ComplexSeMet NCSPeakInflectionRemoteSpace groupP3121P3121Unit-cell parametersa (Å)86.4786.31B (Å)86.4786.31c (Å)118.00118.36No. of molecules in ASU22<B> for atomic model (Å2)37.458.7Resolution (Å)2.12.702.852.70Total observations94324773756900060831Unique reflections30,118 (2978)14,034 (1344)12,015 (1169)13,618 (1301)Completeness (%)97.8 (98.3)98.9 (97.7)99 (98.4)96 (94.1)Redundancy3.3 (3.1)5.5 (4.8)5.8 (5.3)4.6 (4.0)RmergeaRmerge = ΣhklΣi|Ii(hkl) — <I(hkl)>|/ΣhklΣi Ii(hkl) where Ii(hkl) is the ith observation of the reflection (hkl), and <I(hkl)> is the mean intensity of the (hkl) reflection.0.075 (0.51)0.114 (0.51)0.088 (0.55)0.083 (0.51)C21.01 (0.84)1.3 (0.9)1.0 (0.8)1.0 (0.8)<I/s(I)>13.7 (2.0)16.4 (2.5)17.0 (3.0)14.0 (2.0)Rcrys (%)22.0723.9Rfree (%)26.6728.5Residues in core region of Ramachandran plot (%)92.888.4Residues in most allowed region (%)7.211.6Residues in generously allowed region (%)00a Rmerge = ΣhklΣi|Ii(hkl) — <I(hkl)>|/ΣhklΣi Ii(hkl) where Ii(hkl) is the ith observation of the reflection (hkl), and <I(hkl)> is the mean intensity of the (hkl) reflection.

Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar) using data collected at the three wavelengths (indicated under “Data Collection and Data Analysis of the SeMet Derivative”) in the 20-2.7 Å resolution range. A single solution was found with six heavy atom sites with a Z score of 14.3 for a signal-to-noise ratio of 0.3, leading to a mean figure of merit of 0.46. The program ARP-WARP (17Lamzin V.S. Perrakis A. Wilson K.S. Rossmann M.G. Arnold E. International Tables for Crystallography. Volume F: Crystallography of biological macromolecules. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2001: 720-722Google Scholar) was used to improve the initial phase and build automatically part of the protein skeleton. The program disclosed the presence of two molecules in the asymmetric unit as indicated by the Vm calculation. The phases thus obtained were improved using the solvent-flattening and 2-fold averaging density modification (18Cowtan K.D. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 43-4814Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Refinement was performed using the program REFMAC5 (19Murshudov N. Lebedev A. Vagin A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar), which applies the maximum likelihood method. The refinement statistics are presented in Table 1. Model building was performed using the program COOT (20Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22799) Google Scholar). The final model (a dimer) includes 327 residues (19–27 and 31–194 residues in monomer A and 40–194 in monomer B), each monomer contains four SeMet and 18 water molecules. The final Rcrys for all resolution shells (74-2.72 Å), calculated using the working set reflections (12882), is 23.9%, and the free R value calculated using the test set reflections (676) is 28.5%. The final Rcrys calculated for the highest resolution shell (2.72–2.79Å) using the working set reflections (898) is 33.7%, and the free R value calculated using the test set reflections (30Petřek M. Otyepka M. Banáš P. Košinová P. Koča J. Damborský J. BMC Bioinformatics. 2006; 7: 316Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) is 49%. The quality of the model was assessed by the program PRO-CHECK (21Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot contained 88.4% of nonglycine residues. The atomic coordinates and the structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession number 2VNE).Structure Solution and Refinement of Norcoclaurine Synthase in Complex with Dopamine and 4-Hydroxybenzaldehyde—The crystals of SeMet norcoclaurine synthase, obtained as reported above, were soaked in the mother liquor solution containing dopamine (2 mm) and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (2 mm) at 294 K for 24 h. Attempts to soak the crystals using the natural substrate, 4-HPAA, were unfruitful because of the intrinsic instability of the substrate itself (half-life of ∼1 h) under the soaking conditions described above. The data were collected as 0.65° oscillation frames using the CCD detector on the x-ray beamline ID-23-1 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France), at a wavelength of 0.972 Å at 100 K using 25% v/v of glycerol as cryoprotectant. Data analysis, performed with DENZO (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38361) Google Scholar), indicated that the crystal belonged to the trigonal space group P3121 and had the following unit cell dimensions: a = b = 86.474, c = 117.977 Å. The data were scaled using SCALEPACK (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38361) Google Scholar) and had an Rmerge = 7.5% and an χ2 = 1.012.The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the monomer B of SeMet norcoclaurine synthase without ligands as search probe (Protein Data Bank entry 2VNE). The rotational and translational searches, performed with the program MOLREP (22Vagin A.A. Teplyakov A.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4120) Google Scholar) in the resolution range of 10-3.0 Å, produced a clear solution corresponding to a dimer in the asymmetric unit. Refinement was performed using the program REFMAC5 (19Murshudov N. Lebedev A. Vagin A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar), and model building was performed using the program COOT (20Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22799) Google Scholar) (Table 1). The final model includes 327 residues (19–27 and 31–194 residues in monomer A, 40–194 in monomer B), a dopamine molecule, two 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde molecules, 176 water molecules, two acetate anions, and five chloride anions. The final Rcrys for all resolution shells (50-2.09 Å), calculated using the working set reflections (28573), is 22.07%, and the free R value, calculated using the test set reflections (1508), is 26.67%. The final Rcrys calculated for the highest resolution shell (2.144-2.089 Å) using the working set reflections (2045) is 26.5%, and the free R value calculated using the test set reflections (99) is 35.6%. The most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot contain 92.8% of nonglycine residues. The atomic coordinates and the structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (2VQ5).Catalytic Activity and Site-directed Mutagenesis—K122A, E110A, Y108F, and Y108A mutants were obtained on the same PEt 22-b vector, expressed and purified as described under “Protein Expression and Purification of SeMet Derivative.” The Y108A mutant, however, resulted in the expression of insoluble, possibly unfolded protein and could not be recovered in soluble form by guanidine denaturation/refolding experiments. The three soluble mutants and the wild type protein were thus analyzed for enzymatic activity using the circular dichroism-based assay proposed by Luk et al. (9Luk L.Y. Bunn S. Liscombe D.K. Facchini P.J. Tanner M.E. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 10153-10161Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter was used for kinetic measurements (see supplemental materials paragraph 2). Dopamine hydrochloride was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde was prepared from tyrosine according to the method of Hazen et al. (Ref. 23Hazen S.L. Gaut J.P. Hsu F.F. Crowley J.R. d'Avignon A. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16990-16998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar; see also supplemental materials paragraph 1). Kinetic data were obtained by following CD signal changes at 285 nm and 37 °C. Data analysis and fitting procedures were carried out with the Matlab program (The Math Works inc. South Natick, MA) according to a simple Michaelis and Menten scheme. Substrate consumption and (S)-norcoclaurine formation were also measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using an Agilent 6850A gas chromatograph coupled to a 5973N quadrupole mass selective detector (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Ethyl acetate extracts at the end of the reaction were also analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry apparatus (Thermo Finnigan LXQ) equipped with a linear ion trap analyzer.RESULTSAnalysis of the x-ray structures 2VNE and 2VQ5 revealed a dimeric assembly in the asymmetric unit. A crystallographic tetramer composed of two asymmetric units, each containing a single dimer (A1-B1 or A2-B2), is represented in Fig. 2. Each NCS monomer revealed that NCS conforms to the overall fold adopted by proteins belonging to the Bet v1-like superfamily, which includes plant phytohormone carriers, pathogen-related proteins (PR10), MLN64-START domains, and the recently characterized tetracenomycin aromatase/cyclase (24Gajhede M. Osmark P. Poulsen F.M. Ipsen H. Larsen J.N. van Neerven R.J.J. Schou C. L⊘wenstein H. Spangford M.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 1040-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 25Ames B.D.

Accordingly, the ensemble of secondary elements consists of a seven-stranded antiparallel β-sheets wrapped around a long C-terminal helix (α3) and two smaller α-helical segments (α1 and α2) (26Pasternak O. Bujacz G.D. Fujimoto Y. Jelen F. Otlewski J. Sikorski M.M. Jaskolski M. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 2622-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, the C-terminal helix is longer in NCS than in Bet-v1 homologous proteins and is formed by two helical segments joined by an extended stretch (residues 173–177). Further, NCS has an additional N-terminal domain that forms a short α-helix and a long flexible segment that yields interpretable diffraction patterns only in one monomer within a single dimeric asymmetric unit. This segment folds in a β-strand secondary element that stabilizes the interface of the crystallographic 2-fold symmetry related dimer within the tetramer (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Tetrameric packing of NCS. Two asymmetric units, each containing a single dimer (A1-B1 or A2-B2), are represented. Each dimer is stabilized by the N terminus β-strand of the symmetry related dimer.

The wider opening (4.2 Å diameter), is formed by an array of hydrophobic residues and a polar patch composed by Tyr108, Tyr131, Tyr139, and Glu103 side chains located at the entrance of the cavity. Deeper in the cavity, the side chain of Lys122 protrudes toward the interior of the tunnel forming a “hook” capable of intercepting the carbonyl group of the aldehyde substrate (Fig. 3b). In correspondence with Lys122, the tunnel is thus restricted to a diameter of 1.2 Å. The smaller opening of the catalytic tunnel (3.2 Å) lies besides the Lys122 side chain and Asn117 and is solvent-accessible. X-ray data obtained on crystals soaked with the dopamine substrate and the nonreactive substrate analogue 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (PHB) indicate that the two molecules adopt a stacked configuration with the respective aromatic rings lying on almost parallel planes (Figs. 4 and 5). PHB carbonyl oxygen is hydrogen-bonded to Lys122 amino group, whereas the phenolic oxygen is in contact (2.44 Å) with the carboxyl moiety of Asp141. Dopamine is hold in place by the stacking interaction with PHB and by hydrogen bonding of the C-1 phenol hydroxyl with the Tyr108 phenol hydroxyl. Most significantly, dopamine C-5 carbon atom lies at 2.7 Å from the carboxyl group of Glu110, suggesting a key role for this residue in the catalytic mechanism (Fig. 6). Comparison between the structures of the unliganded (2VNE) and substrate-bound (2VQ5) derivatives brings about that only very small adjustments of the residues just described occurred upon substrates binding in the crystal state.FIGURE 3NCS monomer and catalytic tunnel. a, protein surface and catalytic tunnel.

https://openalex.org/W2083237411,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated, aggregated tau protein and extracellular deposits of beta-amyloid peptide. Increased beta-amyloid levels are thought to precede tangle formation, but tau pathology is more closely related to neuronal death. Minocycline, a tetracycline derivative, has potent antiinflammatory, antiapoptotic, and neuroprotective effects in several models of neurodegenerative disease, including models of AD with amyloid pathology. We have used both in vitro and in vivo models of AD to determine whether minocycline may have therapeutic efficacy against tau pathology. In primary cortical neurons, minocycline prevents beta-amyloid-induced neuronal death, reduces caspase-3 activation, and lowers generation of caspase-3-cleaved tau fragments. Treatment of tangle-forming transgenic mice (htau line) with minocycline results in reduced levels of tau phosphorylation and insoluble tau aggregates. The in vivo effects of minocycline are also associated with reduced caspase-3 activation and lowered tau cleavage by caspase-3. In tau mice, we find that conformational changes in tau are susceptible to minocycline treatment, but are not directly associated with the amount of tau fragments produced, highlighting a dissociation between the development of these pathological tau species. These results suggest a possible novel therapeutic role for minocycline in the treatment of AD and related tauopathies."
https://openalex.org/W1980401884,"Down-regulation of E-cadherin plays an important role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is critical in normal development and disease states such as tissue fibrosis and metastasis. Snail, a key transcription repressor of E-cadherin, is a labile protein with a short half-life and is regulated through phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation. Previously, we showed that GSK-3beta phosphorylated two stretches of serine residues within the nuclear export signal and the destruction box of Snail, provoking its cytoplasmic export for ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation. However, the mechanism of Snail dephosphorylation and the identity of the Snail-specific phosphatase remain elusive. Using a functional genomic screening, we found that the small C-terminal domain phosphatase (SCP) is a specific phosphatase for Snail. SCP interacted and co-localized with Snail in the nucleus. We also found that SCP expression induced Snail dephosphorylation and stabilization in vitro and in vivo. However, a catalytically inactive mutant of SCP had no effect on Snail. Furthermore, we found that Snail stabilization induced by SCP enhanced snail activity in the suppression of E-cadherin and increased cell migration. Thus, our findings indicate that SCP functions as a Snail phosphatase to control its phosphorylation and stabilization, and our study provides novel insights for the regulation of Snail during EMT and cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2059332071,"Background The Human Microbiome Project (HMP) is one of the U.S. National Institutes of Health Roadmap for Medical Research. Primary interests of the HMP include the distinctiveness of different gut microbiomes, the factors influencing microbiome diversity, and the functional redundancies of the members of human microbiotas. In this present work, we contribute to these interests by characterizing two extinct human microbiotas. Methodology/Principal Findings We examine two paleofecal samples originating from cave deposits in Durango Mexico and dating to approximately 1300 years ago. Contamination control is a serious issue in ancient DNA research; we use a novel approach to control contamination. After we determined that each sample originated from a different human, we generated 45 thousand shotgun DNA sequencing reads. The phylotyping and functional analysis of these reads reveals a signature consistent with the modern gut ecology. Interestingly, inter-individual variability for phenotypes but not functional pathways was observed. The two ancient samples have more similar functional profiles to each other than to a recently published profile for modern humans. This similarity could not be explained by a chance sampling of the databases. Conclusions/Significance We conduct a phylotyping and functional analysis of ancient human microbiomes, while providing novel methods to control for DNA contamination and novel hypotheses about past microbiome biogeography. We postulate that natural selection has more of an influence on microbiome functional profiles than it does on the species represented in the microbial ecology. We propose that human microbiomes were more geographically structured during pre-Columbian times than today."

The arrhythmic horses are in possession of one of the largest terrestrial animal eyes and the purpose of this study is to reveal whether their eye is sensitive enough to see colours at night. During the day horses are known to have dichromatic colour vision. To disclose whether they can discriminate colours in dim light a behavioural dual choice experiment was performed. We started the training and testing at daylight intensities and the horses continued to choose correctly at a high frequency down to light intensities corresponding to moonlight. One Shetland pony mare, was able to discriminate colours at 0.08 cd/m2, while a half blood gelding, still discriminated colours at 0.02 cd/m2. For comparison, the colour vision limit for several human subjects tested in the very same experiment was also 0.02 cd/m2. Hence, the threshold of colour vision for the horse that performed best was similar to that of the humans. The behavioural results are in line with calculations of the sensitivity of cone vision where the horse eye and human eye again are similar. The advantage of the large eye of the horse lies not in colour vision at night, but probably instead in achromatic tasks where presumably signal summation enhances sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W1997995756,"Very diverse research fields frequently deal with the analysis of multiple clustering results, which should imply an objective detection of overlaps and divergences between the formed groupings. The congruence between these multiple results can be quantified by clustering comparison measures such as the Wallace coefficient (W). Since the measured congruence is dependent on the particular sample taken from the population, there is variability in the estimated values relatively to those of the true population. In the present work we propose the use of a confidence interval (CI) to account for this variability when W is used. The CI analytical formula is derived assuming a Gaussian sampling distribution and recurring to the algebraic relationship between W and the Simpson's index of diversity. This relationship also allows the estimation of the expected Wallace value under the assumption of independence of classifications. We evaluated the CI performance using simulated and published microbial typing data sets. The simulations showed that the CI has the desired 95% coverage when the W is greater than 0.5. This behaviour is robust to changes in cluster number, cluster size distributions and sample size. The analysis of the published data sets demonstrated the usefulness of the new CI by objectively validating some of the previous interpretations, while showing that other conclusions lacked statistical support."

We hypothesized that the extent of pGSN reduction correlates with outcomes of septic patients and that circulating actin is a manifestation of sepsis.We assayed pGSN in plasma samples from non-surgical septic patients identified from a pre-existing database which prospectively enrolled patients admitted to adult intensive care units at an academic hospital. We identified 21 non-surgical septic patients for the study. Actinemia was detected in 17 of the 21 patients, suggesting actin released into circulation from injured tissues is a manifestation of sepsis. Furthermore, we documented the depletion of pGSN in human clinical sepsis, and that the survivors had significantly higher pGSN levels than the non-survivors (163+/-47 mg/L vs. 89+/-48 mg/L, p = 0.01). pGSN levels were more strongly predictive of 28-day mortality than APACHE III scores. For every quartile reduction in pGSN, the odds of death increased 3.4-fold.We conclude that circulating actin and pGSN deficiency are associated with early sepsis. The degree of pGSN deficiency correlates with sepsis mortality. Reversing pGSN deficiency may be an effective treatment for sepsis."

They are responsible for the maturation of stable RNA and the degradation of RNA molecules that are defective or no longer required by the cell. Both maturation and degradation are initiated by endoribonucleolytic cleavage(s) and completed by the action of exoribonucleases (1Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, three, relatively nonspecific, 3′ to 5′ processive exoribonucleases are responsible for degradation of RNA: RNase II, RNase R, and polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase). 3The abbreviations used are: PNPase, polynucleotide phosphorylase; CSD, cold-shock domain; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; ss, single-stranded; ds, double-stranded.3The abbreviations used are: PNPase, polynucleotide phosphorylase; CSD, cold-shock domain; DTT, dithiothreitol; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; ss, single-stranded; ds, double-stranded.

However, mRNAs containing extensive secondary structure, such as repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences, are degraded by PNPase (4Khemici V. Carpousis A.J. Mol.

These findings suggest that PNPase and RNase R are the universal degraders of structured RNAs in vivo, leaving RNase II to act on relatively unstructured RNAs. Whether or not an RNase acts upon a particular RNA appears to depend upon the specificity of the RNase and the accessibility of the RNA to that RNase (1Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Purified RNase R readily degrades both single- and double-stranded RNA molecules (5Cheng Z.F. Deutscher M.P. Mol.

Deutscher, unpublished observation. How RNase R then proceeds through the RNA duplex is of great interest. An important step toward elucidating the mechanism of action of RNase R is to determine the contribution that each of its domains makes to substrate binding and exoribonuclease activity. Despite differences in their physiological roles and intrinsic substrate specificities, RNase R and RNase II both belong to the widely distributed RNR family of exoribonucleases (10Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 11Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P.

RNR family members are all large multidomain proteins with processive 3′ to 5′ hydrolytic exoribonuclease activity that share a common linear domain organization. RNase R contains two cold-shock domains (CSD1 and CSD2) near its N terminus, a central nuclease, or RNB domain, an S1 domain near the C terminus, and a low complexity, highly basic region at the C terminus (Fig. 1A). The nuclease domain contains four highly conserved sequence motifs (10Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 11Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P.

The role of the basic region at the C terminus of RNase R is unknown, but it may act as an RNA-binding domain and/or a mediator of protein-protein interactions. Crystal structures of E. coli wild-type RNase II and a D209N catalytic site mutant in complex with single-stranded RNA have recently been solved (14Frazão C. McVey C.E. Amblar M. Barbas A.

Cell. 2006; 24: 149-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In these structures the two CSDs and the S1 domain come together to form an RNA-binding clamp that directs RNA to the catalytic center at the base of a narrow, basic channel within the nuclease domain (14Frazão C. McVey C.E. Amblar M. Barbas A. Vonrhein C. Arraiano C.M. Carrondo M.A. Nature. 2006; 443: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 30Zuo Y. Vincent H.A. Zhang J. Wang Y. Deutscher M.P. Malhotra A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 149-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Only single-stranded RNA can be accommodated by the RNA-binding clamp and the nuclease domain channel, which explains the single strand specificity of RNase II. It is expected that RNase R will adopt a similar structure. In this study, we determine the contribution that each of the domains of RNase R makes to RNA-binding and exoribonuclease activity. We show that the CSDs and the S1 domain are important for substrate binding, although their roles differ. Of most interest, we show that the nuclease domain alone of RNase R is sufficient to degrade through double-stranded RNA, whereas the nuclease domain of RNase II is unable to carry out this reaction. The nuclease domain of RNase R also binds RNA more tightly, which may explain the difference in catalytic properties between RNase R and RNase II.

Fractions containing RNase R ΔCSDsΔS1 were pooled, concentrated, aliquoted, and stored frozen at -80 °C. Preparation of Oligoribonucleotide Substrates—Oligoribonucleotides were deprotected according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The single-stranded oligoribonucleotide substrates used were A4, A17, and ss17-A17 (5′-CCCCACCACCAUCACUUA17-3′). These were 5′-labeled with 32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. A substrate consisting of a 17-base pair duplex with a 17-nucleotide 3′ overhang (ds17-A17) was prepared by mixing 5′-32P-labeled ss17-A17 with the non-radioactive complementary oligoribonucleotide (5′-AAGUGAUGGUGGUGGGG-3′) in a 1:1.2 molar ratio in the presence of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 20 mm KCl, heating the mixture in a boiling water bath for 5 min, and then allowing the solution to cool slowly to room temperature. Acid Soluble Activity Assays—Assays were carried out in 50-μl reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm KCl, 0.25 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, and 30 μg[3H]polyadenylic acid substrate (100 cpm nmol-1). The concentration of purified enzyme was adjusted to ensure that less than 25% of the substrate was degraded. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 150 μl of 0.5% (w/v) yeast RNA and 200 μl of 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. This was incubated on ice for 15 min and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The acid-soluble counts in 200 μl of the supernatant fraction were determined by liquid scintillation counting using a LS 6500 multipurpose scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter, Inc.). Activities were normalized according to the moles of protein in each sample. Electrophoretic Activity Assays—RNase R assays were typically carried out in 30-μl reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm KCl, 0.25 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, and 10 μm oligoribonucleotide substrate. RNase II assays were carried out in 30-μl reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, and 10 μm oligoribonucleotide substrate. The amount of purified enzyme was as indicated in the figures or, for calculation of the initial rates, was selected to ensure that less than 25% of the substrate was degraded. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C, portions were taken at the indicated times or at regular intervals for determination of the initial rates, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 volumes of gel loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 0.025% xylene cyanol). Reaction products were resolved on denaturing 7.5 m urea, 20% polyacrylamide gels and visualized using a STORM 840 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Quantification was carried out using ImageJ (NIH) (32Abramoff M.D. Magelhaes P.J. Ram S.J. Biophotonics Int. 2004; 11: 36-42Google Scholar), initial rates were calculated from at least four points taken from the linear region of the degradation curve. Binding Assays—The double-filter nucleic acid-binding assay developed by Wong and Lohman (33Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and adapted by Tanaka and Schwer (34Tanaka N. Schwer B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9795-9803Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was used. Nitrocellulose and nylon membranes were washed as described by Vincent and Deutscher (9Vincent H.A. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29769-29775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and equilibrated in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm DTT, 10 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol) for at least 1 h prior to use. Twenty-μl reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm DTT, 10 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 200 pm 32P-labeled oligoribonucleotide substrate, and varying amounts of purified enzyme were incubated on ice for 30 min. No degradation of the RNA occurs in the absence of Mg2+. A 96-well dot-blot apparatus (Bio-Rad) was used to apply the sample to a nitrocellulose membrane placed above a nylon membrane. Each well was washed with 100 μl of ice-cold binding buffer just prior to loading the sample and immediately following sample application. The apparatus was disassembled, the membranes were allowed to air dry and were visualized using a PhosphorImager. Quantification was carried out in ImageJ (NIH) (32Abramoff M.D. Magelhaes P.J. Ram S.J. Biophotonics Int. 2004; 11: 36-42Google Scholar) and the fraction of RNA bound was determined from signalnitrocellulose/(signalnitrocellulose + signalnylon). The fraction of RNA bound was plotted against the total enzyme concentration and the Kd was determined by non-linear regression analysis using a one-site binding hyperbola in Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Construction of Truncated RNase R Proteins—Based upon sequence analysis, RNase R contains a central nuclease domain and four putative RNA-binding domains: two cold-shock domains (CSD1 and CSD2) near the N terminus of the protein, an S1 domain near the C terminus of the protein, and a low complexity, highly basic region at the C terminus (Fig. 1A). To investigate the relative contribution that each of these domains makes to substrate binding and exoribonuclease activity, a series of truncated RNase R proteins was constructed. The domain organization of the truncated proteins is shown in Fig. 1A. RNase RΔCSDs is missing the first 221 amino acids of RNase R, which include CSD1 and CSD2. RNase RΔBasic lacks the 83 amino acids from the C terminus, which comprise the low complexity, highly basic region. RNase RΔS1 is truncated 170 amino acids from the C terminus to remove both the S1 domain and the low complexity, highly basic region. Finally, RNase RΔCSDsΔS1 consists of the nuclease domain alone, and, therefore, lacks all of the putative RNA-binding domains. With the exception of RNase RΔBasic (31Suzuki H. Zuo Y. Wang J. Zhang M.Q. Malhotra A. Mayeda A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: e63Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), which was obtained from Dr. A. Malhotra (University of Miami, Miami, FL), the RNase R truncations were expressed and purified from an R-/II- strain as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Homogeneous preparations were obtained for each of the RNase R truncations as determined by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). RNA Binding by Truncated RNase R Proteins—To assess the contribution that each domain of RNase R makes to substrate binding, a double-filter binding assay was used to determine the Kd for binding of single-stranded A17 to each of the truncated RNase R proteins. In this assay, protein-bound RNA is retained on the nitrocellulose membrane, whereas unbound RNA is trapped on the lower nylon membrane, thus allowing determination of the fraction of RNA bound. Binding assays were carried out in the absence of Mg2+ and in the presence of 10 mm EDTA to prevent degradation of the RNA upon binding to RNase R. As shown in Table 1, A17 bound tightly to full-length RNase R with a Kd of 0.8 nm. This is consistent with previous data (9Vincent H.A. Deutscher M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29769-29775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF"
https://openalex.org/W2025177279,"CD44 and fibrin(ogen) play critical roles in the hematogenous dissemination of tumor cells, including colon carcinomas. We recently reported that CD44 is the primary fibrin, but not fibrinogen, receptor on LS174T colon carcinomas. However, the biochemical nature of this interaction and the roles of CD44 standard (CD44s) versus CD44 variant (CD44v) isoforms in fibrin(ogen) recognition have yet to be delineated. Microspheres, coated with CD44 immunopurified from LS174T or T84 colon carcinoma cells, which express primarily CD44v, effectively bind to immobilized fibrin, but not fibrinogen, in shear flow. In contrast, CD44s from HL-60 cells binds to both immobilized fibrin and fibrinogen under flow. Use of highly specific enzymes and metabolic inhibitors reveals that LS174T CD44 binding to fibrin is dependent on O-glycosylation of CD44, whereas CD44s-fibrin(ogen) interaction has an absolute requirement for N-, but not O-, linked glycans. The presence of chondroitin and dermatan sulfate on CD44 standard and variant isoforms facilitates fibrin recognition. Use of the anti-CD44 function-blocking monoclonal antibody Hermes-1 nearly abolishes binding of LS174T CD44 to fibrin, although it has no effect on CD44s-fibrin(ogen) interaction. The CD44-binding site is localized within the N-terminal portion of the fibrin β chains, including amino acid residues (β15-66). Surface plasmon resonance experiments revealed high affinity binding of immobilized CD44 with solubilized fibrin but not fibrinogen. Collectively, these data suggest that immobilization of fibrinogen exposes a cryptic site that mediates binding to CD44s but not CD44v. Our findings may provide a rational basis for designing novel therapeutic strategies to combat metastasis.

Our findings may provide a rational basis for designing novel therapeutic strategies to combat metastasis. CD44 is a multitasking protein that plays a pivotal role in a number of biological processes, including inflammation, hematopoiesis, wound healing, and cancer metastasis (1Ponta H. Sherman L. Herrlich P.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). CD44 proteins are type I transmembrane molecules encoded by a single gene, which spans ∼50 kb on human chromosome 11 and includes at least 20 exons (2Martin T.A. Harrison G. Mansel R.E. Jiang W.G. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2003; 46: 165-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Exons 1-5, 16-18, and 20 are spliced together to form the smallest CD44 transcript known as standard form (CD44s) 2The abbreviations used are: CD44s, CD44 standard isoform; CD44v, CD44 variant isoform; GPRP-NH2, Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro-amide; DPBS, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; mAb, monoclonal antibody; DMJ, 1-deoxymannojirimycin, hydrochloride; PNGase, peptide:N-glycosidase; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; PE, phycoerythrin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; GAG, glycosaminoglycan.2The abbreviations used are: CD44s, CD44 standard isoform; CD44v, CD44 variant isoform; GPRP-NH2, Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro-amide; DPBS, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; mAb, monoclonal antibody; DMJ, 1-deoxymannojirimycin, hydrochloride; PNGase, peptide:N-glycosidase; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; PE, phycoerythrin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; GAG, glycosaminoglycan. (2Martin T.A. Harrison G. Mansel R.E. Jiang W.G. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2003; 46: 165-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The human CD44s protein is composed of 341 amino acid residues with a predicted size of 37 kDa, whereas its estimated molecular mass by SDS-PAGE is 80-95 kDa because of extensive post-translational modification resulting from the attachment of carbohydrates to N- and O-linked glycosylation sites of the extracellular domain. At least 10 exons (6-15; typically identified as v1-v10 that encode a membrane-proximal portion of the extracellular domain) can be alternatively spliced and inserted at a single site between exons 5 and 16 to give rise to multiple variant isoforms of CD44 (CD44v) with a molecular mass up to 250 kDa (1Ponta H. Sherman L. Herrlich P.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar, 2Martin T.A. Harrison G. Mansel R.E. Jiang W.G. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2003; 46: 165-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). CD44s can be found in most tissues of the adult organism, with a particularly strong expression on cells of the hematopoietic system, whereas the larger variant isoforms are expressed in only a few epithelial tissues, mainly in proliferating cells, and in several cancers (1Ponta H. Sherman L. Herrlich P.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). Several studies have disclosed the critical involvement of CD44 in the facilitation of blood-borne metastasis. In certain cases, such as with colorectal carcinomas, the expression of CD44v confers metastatic potential in vivo (3Harada N. Mizoi T. Kinouchi M. Hoshi K. Ishii S. Shiiba K. Sasaki I. Matsuno S. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 91: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 4Hofmann M. Rudy W. Zoller M. Tolg C. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Gunthert U. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 5292-5297PubMed Google Scholar) and results in poor prognosis (5Wielenga V.J. Heider K.H. Offerhaus G.J. Adolf G.R. van den Berg F.M. Ponta H. Herrlich P. Pals S.T. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4754-4756PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the up-regulation of CD44 expression appears to be an early event in colon carcinogenesis (6Kim H. Yang X.L. Rosada C. Hamilton S.R. August J.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 504-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and requires adenomatous polyposis coli gene inactivation (7Wielenga V.J. Smits R.

These observations coupled to the well established hyaluronic acid binding function of CD44 have led to the hypothesis that CD44-mediated tumor cell adhesion to hyaluronan is a dominant factor regulating metastasis (8Kim H.R. Wheeler M.A. Wilson C.M. Iida J. Eng D. Simpson M.A. McCarthy J.B. Bullard K.M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4569-4576Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Fibrinogen is a 340-kDa glycoprotein that is involved in diverse physiological and pathological processes. Structurally, fibrinogen consists of two identical disulfide-linked subunits, each of which is formed by three distinct polypeptide chains, Aα, Bβ, and γ (9Weisel J.W. Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 70: 247-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). These chains assemble to form a number of independently folded domains, grouped into five structural regions as follows: the central E region, two identical terminal D regions, and two αC regions (10Madrazo J. Brown J.H. Litvinovich S. Dominguez R. Yakovlev S. Medved L. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11967-11972Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 11Medved L.V. Gorkun O.V. Privalov P.L. FEBS Lett. 1983; 160: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12Privalov P.L. Medved L.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 159: 665-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The central region E is a dimer formed by the N-terminal portions of all six chains; the distal D regions are formed by the C-terminal portions of the Bβ and γ chains and a portion of the Aα chain, and the two αC regions are made up of the C-terminal two-thirds of the Aα chains. Proteolytic degradation of fibrin(ogen) by plasmin or some other proteases results in the D and E fragments, which correspond to the D and E regions. Because these fragments mainly preserve the structure and functional properties of the D and E regions, they are often used as models of these regions in fibrin(ogen) studies (9Weisel J.W. Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 70: 247-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). In contrast, the αC regions are highly susceptible to proteolysis and degraded into smaller fragments. However, the full-length αC region can be prepared by the recombinant technique (13Matsuka Y.V. Medved L.V. Migliorini M.M. Ingham K.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5810-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 14Tsurupa G. Tsonev L. Medved L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6449-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the N-terminal portions of the Bβ chains (residues ∼1-55), which form in the central E region a pair of functional BβN-domains (15Gorlatov S. Medved L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4107-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), are also easily degraded upon proteolysis into a smaller (Bβ1-42) fragment (15Gorlatov S. Medved L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4107-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, the proteolytically prepared E fragment, which is often called E3 fragment, is devoid of these domains while preserving other structures of the E region. The BβN-domains were also expressed in a disulfide-linked dimeric form, as the (Bβ1-66)2 fragment, which mimics the dimeric arrangement of these domains in fibrinogen (15Gorlatov S. Medved L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4107-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although fibrinogen is relatively inert in the circulation, upon conversion to fibrin it interacts with a variety of proteins and cells to participate in numerous (patho)physiological processes. Most notably, fibrinogen is involved in the blood clotting cascade whereby its thrombin-mediated conversion to fibrin (via cleavage of two N-terminal fibrinopeptides A and B, residues Aα(1Ponta H.

Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 70: 247-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). It is now widely accepted that fibrin(ogen) plays a critical role in the hematogenous dissemination of tumor cells, including colon carcinomas. The most compelling evidence for the direct role of fibrin(ogen) in metastatic spread is the profound inhibition of experimental and spontaneous metastasis in fibrinogen-deficient mice compared with wild type controls (16Palumbo J.S.

It is believed that fibrin(ogen) clots surrounding tumor cells may protect them from immunologic and physiologic stresses in the bloodstream, and facilitate their lodging to the pulmonary vasculature. This hypothesis is corroborated by recent in vivo data, which disclose that in mice lacking functional NK cells, fibrinogen deficiency was no longer a significant determinant of metastatic potential. It is also noteworthy that many patients with cancer, including those with disseminated colon cancer (20Wojtukiewicz M.Z. Zacharski L.R. Moritz T.E. Hur K. Edwards R.L. Rickles F.R. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1992; 3: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), also have detectable abnormalities of blood coagulation such as elevated levels of fibrinogen and fibrinopeptide A (21Luzzatto G. Schafer A.I. Semin. Oncol. 1990; 17: 147-159PubMed Google Scholar). Increased plasma levels of soluble fibrin have also been observed at the time of recurrence of colorectal cancer (22Iversen L.H. Thorlacius-Ussing O. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 89: 726-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Using RNA interference, we have recently shown that CD44 is the functional fibrin, but not fibrinogen, receptor on LS174T colon carcinoma cells (23Alves C.S. Burdick M.M. Thomas S.N. Pawar P. Konstantopoulos K. Am. J. Physiol. 2008; 294: C9-7-C916Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, detailed studies on the biochemical and biophysical characterization of CD44-fibrin(ogen) recognition have yet to be performed. Circumstantial evidence in the literature based on antibody interference assays suggests nonglycosylated CD44s supports human lung fibroblast adhesion and migration on both fibrinogen and fibrin under static conditions (24Svee K. White J. Vaillant P. Jessurun J. Roongta U. Krumwiede M. Johnson D. Henke C. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 1713-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In striking contrast, CD44s-mediated transmigration of human dermal fibroblasts into fibrin gels requires dermatan-, but not chondroitin-, sulfate proteoglycans (25Clark R.A. Lin F. Greiling D. An J. Couchman J.R. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2004; 122: 266-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a CD44-related chondroitin-sulfate proteoglycan, expressed on rabbit microvascular endothelial cells, serves as a receptor for both fibrinogen and fibrin (26Henke C.A. Roongta U. Mickelson D.J. Knutson J.R. McCarthy J.B. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 2541-2552Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Given the conflicting nature of the existing literature, we aimed to elucidate the roles of the various glycosaminoglycans and glycosylation patterns in CD44-fibrin(ogen) recognition, and to identify the CD44-binding sites on fibrin(ogen). Additionally, it is not clear whether the presence or absence of CD44 variant isoforms modulates CD44-fibrin(ogen) binding in shear flow. To this end, we have employed an integrated biophysical and biochemical approach, involving cell-free flow-based adhesion assays coupled to enzymatic and metabolic inhibition studies and surface plasmon resonance, to comprehensively characterize the molecular interaction between CD44 and fibrin(ogen). Reagents and Monoclonal Antibodies—Fibrinogen (von Willebrand factor-, plasminogen-, and fibronectin-free) and plasmin were from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). Thrombin, fibrin polymerization inhibitor Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro-amide (GPRP-NH2), human IgG, chondroitinase ABC (Proteus vulgaris), chondroitinase B (Flavobacterium heparinum), chondroitinase AC II (Arthrobacter aurescens), heparinase II (F. heparinum), and benzyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-galactopyranoside (benzyl-GalNAc), hyaluronic acid, and sodium chlorate were purchased from Sigma. The endoglycosidase H (Streptomyces plicatus) and 1-deoxymannojirimycin, hydrochloride (DMJ) were obtained from EMD Biosciences (Gibbstown, NJ). The keratanase I (Pseudomonas), keratanase II (Bacillus), and chondroitinase AC I (Flavobacterium heparinum) were from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). The sialidase (Vibrio cholerae) was from Roche Applied Science. The p-nitrophenyl α-d-xylopyranoside (α-xyloside) and p-nitrophenyl β-d-xylopyranoside (β-xyloside) were purchased from Glycosynth (Warrington, UK). The PNGase F was from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). The anti-human CD44 mAbs, 2C5 and 156-3C11, were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and AbD Serotec (Raleigh, NC), respectively. The unlabeled and PE-conjugated mouse anti-human CD44 (515), PE-labeled mouse IgG1 isotype control, and anti-CLA (HECA-452) were from BD Biosciences. Cell Culture and Staining—LS174T and T84 human colon adenocarcinoma cells and HL60 human myeloid cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in the recommended medium. LS174T and T84 cells were detached from culture flasks by mild trypsinization (0.25% trypsin/EDTA for 5 min at 37 °C), and subsequently incubated at 37 °C for 2 h to regenerate surface glycoproteins, as described previously (27Burdick M.M.

The cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) containing Ca2+/Mg2+, and stored at 4 °C for no longer than 4 h before use in flow-based adhesion assays or flow cytometry. HL60 cells were grown in suspension and as such required no trypsinization or regeneration step. Whole Cell Lysis and Immunoprecipitation of CD44—LS174T, T84, or HL60 whole cell lysate was prepared by membrane disruption using 2% Nonidet P-40 followed by differential centrifugation (30Hanley W.D.

CD44 was immunoprecipitated from colon carcinoma cell lysate with the anti-CD44 mAb 2C5, whereas CD44s was immunopurified from HL60 human myeloid cells with the anti-CD44 mAb 515 using recombinant protein G-agarose beads (Invitrogen) (33Hanley W.D.

Preparation of CD44-coated Microspheres—Prior to protein binding, 10-μm polystyrene microspheres (2.5 × 107 microspheres/ml; Bangs Labs, Fishers, IN) were washed three times with DPBS, followed by two times with citrate/phosphate buffer, pH 3.0. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, the microspheres were washed once more with the citrate/phosphate buffer, three times with DPBS, and two times with binding buffer (0.2 m carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.2). Immunoprecipitated CD44 from LS174T, T84, or HL60 whole cell lysate or human IgG was diluted to the desired concentrations with binding buffer and incubated with the microspheres overnight at 4 °C with constant rotation (23Alves C.S.

Microspheres were washed two times with DPBS and subsequently blocked with DPBS, 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, microspheres were resuspended (2 × 106 microspheres/ml) in DPBS, 0.1% BSA for use in flow cytometric and flow chamber assays. Flow Cytometry—CD44 expression levels on LS174T, T84, and HL60 cells and microspheres were quantified by single-color immunofluorescence and flow cytometry (FACSCalibur; BD Biosciences) using the PE-conjugated anti-CD44 mAb 515. Background levels were determined by incubating cell or microsphere suspensions with the properly matched PE-conjugated mouse IgG isotype control antibody (30Hanley W.D. Napier S.L. Burdick M.M.

Site densities of CD44 adsorbed onto microspheres following enzymatic treatments were determined by flow cytometry and confirmed to be equivalent to untreated controls before use in adhesion assays. Inhibitor Treatments—Prior to metabolic inhibitor studies, LS174T or HL60 cell suspensions (107 cells/ml) were pretreated with 0.1 unit/ml V. cholerae sialidase for 60 min at 37 °C to remove terminal sialic acid residues and to ensure de novo synthesis of newly generated HECA-452 reactive carbohydrate structures (30Hanley W.D.

Here we show that Dutch Calvinists and atheists, brought up in the same country and culture and controlled for race, intelligence, sex, and age, differ with respect to the way they attend to and process the global and local features of complex visual stimuli: Calvinists attend less to global aspects of perceived events, which fits with the idea that people's attentional processing style reflects possible biases rewarded by their religious belief system."
https://openalex.org/W2007958340,"Bacteria resistant to methylmercury utilize two enzymes (MerA and MerB) to degrade methylmercury to the less toxic elemental mercury. The crucial step is the cleavage of the carbon-mercury bond of methylmercury by the organomercurial lyase (MerB). In this study, we determined high resolution crystal structures of MerB in both the free (1.76-Å resolution) and mercury-bound (1.64-Å resolution) states. The crystal structure of free MerB is very similar to the NMR structure, but important differences are observed when comparing the two structures. In the crystal structure, an amino-terminal α-helix that is not present in the NMR structure makes contact with the core region adjacent to the catalytic site. This interaction between the amino-terminal helix and the core serves to bury the active site of MerB. The crystal structures also provide detailed insights into the mechanism of carbon-mercury bond cleavage by MerB. The structures demonstrate that two conserved cysteines (Cys-96 and Cys-159) play a role in substrate binding, carbon-mercury bond cleavage, and controlled product (ionic mercury) release.

These findings are an important step in understanding the mechanism of carbon-mercury bond cleavage by MerB. In the environment, mercury can exist in three different forms: elemental mercury, ionic mercury, and methylmercury. The toxicity of methylmercury is attributed to its lipophilicity and affinity for thiol residues found in proteins (1Clarkson T.W. Magos L. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 2006; 36: 609-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). The ability of methylmercury to accumulate in fat tissues leads to its biomagnification within the food chain and ultimately to its toxicity (2Mergler D. Anderson H.A. Chan L.H. Mahaffey K.R. Murray M. Sakamoto M. Stern A.H. Ambio. 2007; 36: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar, 3Scheuhammer A.M. Meyer M.W. Sandheinrich M.B. Murray M.W. Ambio. 2007; 36: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). An example of methylmercury bioaccumulation is the high levels found in fish species in contaminated waterways. Select fish species accumulate high levels of methylmercury, and consumption of these contaminated species poses a serious health threat to humans. Because of the high number of mercury-contaminated waterways throughout the world, there is a need to develop an effective remediation system for methylmercury. Most systems for cleanup of mercury-contaminated sediments use either physical or chemical remediation. Unfortunately these systems are expensive and environmentally disruptive. In the 1960s, bacteria were isolated from soils and sediments contaminated with high levels of mercury (4Moore B. Lancet. 1960; 2: 453-458Abstract PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 5Richmond M.H.

Analysis of these bacteria demonstrated that they had acquired a series of plasmid-encoded genes collectively referred to as the mer operon that imparts resistance to mercury. Although the precise composition of the mer operon varies between bacterial strains, strains resistant to high levels of methylmercury code for two enzymes (MerA and MerB) that transform methylmercury to elemental mercury (7Summers A.O. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1986; 40: 607-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The organomercurial lyase MerB cleaves the carbon-mercury bond of methylmercury, releases methane (8Schottel J.L.

MerA reduces the ionic mercury to elemental mercury, which is volatile and diffuses out of the bacteria (9Summers A.O. Sugarman L.I. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 242-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the unique properties of these two enzymes, there are numerous ongoing attempts to exploit them in bioremediation systems to clean up methylmercury contamination (10Lyyra S. Meagher R.B.

MerB cleaves the carbon-mercury bond of many organomercurials to generate ionic mercury and a protonated carbon species (14Begley T.P. Walts A.E. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7186-7192Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Based on kinetic experiments, it was concluded that the reaction mechanism is a bimolecular electrophilic substitution (SE2) (15Begley T.P. Walts A.E. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7192-7200Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this mechanism, a proton attacks the carbon moiety from the same side as the mercury, and bond cleavage and protonation occur with retention of the stereochemistry at the carbon position. Based on subsequent mutagenesis experiments, more detailed models have been proposed describing the catalytic role of cysteine residues (16Pitts K.E. Summers A.O. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10287-10296Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies with MerB from Escherichia coli (plasmid R831b) demonstrated that two highly conserved cysteines (Cys-96 and Cys-159) were essential for catalytic activity. The NMR structure of free MerB confirmed that these two cysteines are in close proximity within the active site (17Di Lello P. Benison G.C. Valafar H. Pitts K.E. Summers A.O. Legault P. Omichinski J.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8322-8332Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Recently model compounds have been shown to cleave carbon-mercury bonds using only thiol groups, and their unique properties have been proposed to mimic the mechanism of MerB and specifically Cys-96 and Cys-159 (18Melnick J.G. Parkin G. Science. 2007; 317: 225-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Despite these efforts, the precise details of the mechanism by which MerB cleaves methylmercury are still poorly understood. In this study, we determined high resolution crystal structures of MerB in the free (1.76-Å resolution) and mercury-bound (1.64-Å resolution) states. The two structures of MerB provide important insights into the catalytic mechanism of this unique enzyme. The structures support earlier studies indicating that Cys-96 and Cys-159 are important for the binding to organomercurials and suggest that Asp-99 is an active site residue that participates in the protonolysis of the carbon-mercury bond. Expression of Recombinant Proteins—The sequence encoding MerB from E. coli plasmid R831b was cloned as described previously (17Di Lello P. Benison G.C. Valafar H. Pitts K.E. Summers A.O. Legault P. Omichinski J.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8322-8332Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The MerB mutants (C96S MerB, C159S MerB, and C160S MerB) were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis of plasmid pQZB1 (16Pitts K.E. Summers A.O. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10287-10296Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Wild-type MerB was expressed and purified as described previously (16Pitts K.E. Summers A.O.

Crystallization—Crystals of MerB, C96S MerB, C159S MerB, and C160S MerB were grown by vapor diffusion at 23 °C using either a 1:1 or 1:2 mixture of protein solution (8 mg/ml initial protein concentration) and precipitant buffer, respectively, that was equilibrated against a reservoir of precipitant buffer (see supplemental methods). Data Collection and Processing—MerB crystals were soaked for precise times (7, 10, and 25 min) in organomercurial buffer (precipitant buffer plus a 1.0 mm concentration of either methylmercury or para-hydroxymercury benzoic acid plus 10 mm l-DTT 5The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; [TmBut]K, tris(2-mercapto-1-t-butylimidazoylyl)hydroborate. or cysteine).

Proteins. 1988; 3: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Crystallization Conditions and Structure Determination—MerB crystals were obtained at pH 5.5 and then soaked with several different organomercurial analogs including methyl-mercury to generate the mercury-bound MerB. The MerB crystal structure is a homodimer in the asymmetric unit, although MerB in solution has been shown to be monomeric (Fig. 1) (14Begley T.P. Walts A.E. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7186-7192Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 17Di Lello P. Benison G.C. Valafar H. Pitts K.E. Summers A.O. Legault P. Omichinski J.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8322-8332Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry exists between the two subunits (A and B) present in the crystal. MerB from E. coli (R831b) is 212 amino acids long, and residues 1–208 were used to refine subunit A. For subunit B, residues 1–204 were used with the exception of residues 13–18 and 149–151. The average B-factor for Cα atoms is 19.5 Å2 for the two monomers, 17.4 Å2 for subunit A, and 21.8 Å2 for subunit B. Despite differences in the data quality, the two subunits have identical folds. Comparison between the Crystal and NMR Structures of Free MerB—The NMR structure demonstrated that MerB consists of three antiparallel β-sheets surrounded by six α-helices that could be divided into two regions, an amino-terminal region and a core region. The crystal structure of free MerB is very similar to the solution structure (Fig. 2). Alignment of the backbone from the amino-terminal region and the core region of the two structures demonstrates that there are only minor differences (supplemental Fig. 5). However, comparison of the overall topology of the two structures demonstrates a number of important differences. The most striking differences are observed in the first 25 amino acids at the amino terminus and in a stretch of 8 amino acids (residues 154–161) located adjacent to the catalytic site. In addition, the crystal structure gave a more complete description of other regions of MerB (residues 73–82 and residues 95–104) that were not completely defined by the NMR data. In the solution structure, the first 25 amino acids at the amino terminus are not defined because of the lack of resonance assignments. In the crystal structures, residues 3–14 form an α-helix that is packed against the core region of MerB. This results in the entire amino-terminal region having a different orientation relative to the core region when compared with the NMR structure (Fig. 2). In addition, a new α-helix has been identified between residues 154–161 in the crystal structure that is absent in the NMR structure. The new helix is contained within a large flexible loop between residues Val-146 and His-161 in the NMR structure. In contrast, these residues are all well defined in the crystal structure with the exception of residues 149–151 in subunit B. The differences between the two structures can be explained by factors that stabilize structural elements between the amino-terminal region (residues 3–14) and the core region (residues 146–161). The amino-terminal α-helix (residues 3–14) is interacting with the surface of the core region through van der Waals interactions involving Leu-3, Tyr-6, Ile-7, Leu-10, Leu-11, and Thr-17 as well as hydrogen bonds from the side chains of Tyr-6, Ser-13, and Ala-16. Residues 148–161 in the core region are thus stabilized near the active site by interactions with the amino terminus, and this helps explain the formation of the two helices that were not seen in the solution structure. In addition, the interaction between the amino-terminal helix and the flexible loop is stabilized by interactions between the two subunits. Searches of the DALI structural data base with the MerB crystal coordinates failed to identify any new significant matches (31Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). The only protein with structural homology is the copper chaperone protein NosL (32Taubner L.M. McGuirl M.A. Dooley D.M. Copie V. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12240-12252Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and the homology is only with the core region of MerB (Z = 3.5, root mean square deviation = 3.0 Å, calculated with DaliLite (33Holm L. Park J. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 566-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar)). The Active Site Is Buried in the Crystal Structure—MerB encoded by E. coli (R831b) contains four cysteines (Cys-96, Cys-117, Cys-159, and Cys-160), and NMR studies demonstrated that three cysteines (Cys-96, Cys-159, and Cys-160) are positioned near the active site (17Di Lello P. Benison G.C. Valafar H. Pitts K.E. Summers A.O. Legault P. Omichinski J.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8322-8332Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Point mutations demonstrated that the highly conserved Cys-96 and Cys-159 are essential for enzymatic activity, but replacing the non-conserved Cys-160 with a serine only moderately reduces activity (16Pitts K.E. Summers A.O. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10287-10296Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure, the sulfhydryl groups of Cys-96 and Cys-159 are buried within the protein core. They are buried as a result of the amino-terminal α-helix being in contact with the core region including the large loop between residues 148 and 161. There are two possible ways to access the sulfhydryl groups of Cys-96 and Cys-159 (Fig. 3). The first is by removing the loop (residues 148–161), and the second is by removing the amino-terminal α-helix. In contrast, Cys-160 is solvent-accessible (17Di Lello P. Benison G.C. Valafar H. Pitts K.E. Summers A.O. Legault P. Omichinski J.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8322-8332Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Structure of Mercury-bound Form of MerB—To obtain a substrate-bound complex, crystals of free MerB were soaked with organomercurials (methylmercury or para-hydroxymercury benzoic acid) in the presence or absence of small exogenous thiols including l-DTT, cysteine, and glutathione. These experiments consistently generated a mercury-bound as opposed to an organomercurial-bound form of MerB. In every condition, there was no indication that either the carbon side chain or the exogenous thiol remained attached to the mercury (Fig. 4, A and B). This is in contrast to NMR studies where incubation of MerB with organomercurial compounds in the presence of DTT resulted in a MerB-Hg-DTT complex (34Benison G.C. Di Lello P. Shokes J.E. Cosper N.J. Scott R.A. Legault P. Omichinski J.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8333-8345Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The structure of mercury-bound MerB is very similar to that of the free MerB with the exception of the mercury ion, and the two structures have a root mean square deviation difference of 0.190 Å about Cα. The mercury is bound to MerB in a planar-trigonal conformation by two sulfurs from Cys-96 and Cys-159 (at 2.3- and 2.4-Å distance, respectively), making a 127° angle. The third atom binding the mercury is oxygen from a bound water molecule at 2.6 Å, making angles of 122° and 111° with the mercury and the sulfurs of Cys-96 and Cys-159, respectively. As with the free MerB, the active site residues are completely inaccessible to solvent. Crystal Structures of Cysteine Mutants—Given their importance, cysteine to serine mutants (C96S, C159S, and C160S) of MerB were prepared in an attempt to generate substrate-bound complexes. The structures of the three mutants were essentially identical to that of the native MerB in the free form. Following incubation with organomercurial compounds, we observed no evidence for bound organomercurial substrate or bound mercury product with either the C96S or C159S mutant (data not shown). In contrast, we observed bound mercury ion product in the C160S mutant (supplemental Table 2). This indicates that the C160S crystal retains enzymatic activity and that Cys-160 is not absolutely required for MerB activity. These results are in agreement with previous mutagenesis studies examining the effect of these mutants on MerB activity (16Pitts K.E. Summers A.O. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10287-10296Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, these results indicate that Cys-96 and Cys-159 are essential for both substrate binding and for carbon-mercury bond cleavage. Asp-99 Is in Position to Act as a Proton Mediator—As part of the mechanism of MerB, Cys-96 and/or Cys-159 must first be deprotonated and then react with the organomercurial compound to form a higher order structure about the mercury ion that makes the carbon-mercury bond more amenable to protonolysis. Analysis of the crystal structure of the mercury-bound form of MerB indicates that Asp-99 is the only amino acid vicinal to the bound mercury ion that can serve as proton mediator with one of its carboxylic oxygens within 2.9 Å and the second oxygen of the side chain within hydrogen bonding distance of the bound water attached to mercury. In addition, Asp-99 is in close proximity to the sulfhydryl group of Cys-96 (3.6 Å) in the crystal structure of the free form and would be in an ideal position to function in the deprotonation step required for the sulfhydryl group prior to attack of the organomercurial substrate. MerB and Chemicals Cleave by Similar Mechanisms—It has recently been demonstrated that alkyl mercury compounds designed to mimic MerB are able to cleave organomercurial compounds (18Melnick J.G. Parkin G. Science. 2007; 317: 225-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 35Wilhelm M. Deeken S. Berssen E. Saak W. Lützen A. Koch R. Strasdeit H. Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2004; 2004: 2301-2312Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). One compound, tris(2-mercapto-1-t-butylimidazoylyl)hydroborate (TmButK), forms a four-coordinated pseudotetrahedral mercury center containing three sulfurs and one carbon group (TmButHgCH2CN) when reacted with ethyl mercuric chloride and potassium borohydride in acetonitrile (supplemental Fig. 6). Overlaying the crystal structures of TmButHgCH2CN and the mercury-bound form of MerB about the mercury ion clearly demonstrates that Cys-96 and Cys-159 can be aligned with two or three sulfur atoms from TmButHgCH2CN (Fig. 4C). This is despite the fact that mercury-bound form of MerB is in a trigonal geometry and the TmButHgCH2CN is in a pseudotetrahedral geometry. In this overlay, the third sulfur atom of TmButHgCH2CN is positioned in virtually the identical location as the carboxylate group of Asp-99, and the carbon of the uncleaved carbon-mercury bond of TmButHgCH2CN is 3.1 Å away from one of the oxygen atoms of Asp-99. Given the facile nature with which TmButHgCH2CN cleaves carbon-mercury bonds, this similarity provides additional evidence for the role of Asp-99 in the protonolysis of carbon-mercury bonds by MerB. Buried Active Site—One important observation from the MerB crystal structures is the occurrence of the active site buried within the hydrophobic core. Burying the MerB active site could serve to inhibit the release of the product ionic mercury. Ionic mercury is highly toxic, and rapid release of mercury ion from MerB following cleavage of the carbon-mercury bond could result in extensive cellular damage. Retaining ionic mercury would enable MerB to transfer ionic mercury directly to the reductase MerA for conversion to the less toxic elemental mercury. Previous in vitro studies demonstrated that MerB shuttles ionic mercury to MerA, and the buried active site is consistent with this mechanism (34Benison G.C. Di Lello P. Shokes J.E. Cosper N.J. Scott R.A. Legault P. Omichinski J.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8333-8345Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). MerA would compete with MerB for the mercury ion, and this would result in the direct transfer without release. Two questions still remain. 1) How does the substrate enter the active site, and 2) how is mercury efficiently transferred to MerA? Based on our NMR studies, residues 146–161 are part of a flexible loop, and the 25 amino-terminal residues either exchange too rapidly or they are flexible. In the crystal structures, the high B-factors and the poor density of several residues in these regions support the possibility that these two regions of MerB are flexible and dynamic. Because Cys-159 is part of the flexible loop, substrate binding could trigger the stabilization of these two regions through a mutual interaction. The result of these interactions would be to bury the active site. This requires significant movements of structural elements and would result in a significant loss of entropy. The loss of entropy would reduce the overall activity of the enzyme, but the flexible active site enables MerB to cleave a wide range of organomercurial substrates. This rearrangement of structural elements following substrate binding is not only consistent with the low kcat (0.7–240 min-1) and high Km values (0.5 mm for methylmercury) observed for MerB but also with the wide range of organomercurial substrates (methylmercury to para-hydroxymercury benzoic acid) that can be cleaved. The geometry of the mercury in the mercury-bound MerB crystal is similar to what we previously observed for a MerB-Hg-DTT complex in solution (34Benison G.C. Di Lello P. Shokes J.E. Cosper N.J. Scott R.A. Legault P. Omichinski J.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8333-8345Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this complex, the mercury ion binds Cys-96 and two sulfurs from DTT. In this structure, Cys-159 is in competition with the DTT for binding to the mercury. Given that the DTT is in excess, the Cys-159 sulfhydryl can be displaced by the DTT. Despite this difference, there is a similarity of the preferred geometry (planar trigonal), and the distance (2.42 Å) of the three sulfurs to the mercury is approximately the same. This MerB-Hg-DTT intermediate can be viewed as one step further along the reaction pathway. The MerB-Hg-DTT complex demonstrates how a molecule with two sulfhydryls can compete with Cys-159 for the mercury ion and serves as a model for how two cysteines of MerA could function to abstract the mercury ion from MerB in a shuttling mechanism (direct transfer). Role of Cysteines Residues—The crystal structure of the cysteine mutants of MerB allowed us to analyze the roles for the three cysteines residues near the active site. The wild-type MerB crystals are enzymatically active, and in the presence of organomercurials a mercury-bound form is generated. In the mercury-bound form, Cys-96 and Cys-159 are bound to the mercury ion in a planar-trigonal geometry, and this form can be generated either in the presence or absence of exogenous thiols. In contrast, we were unable to obtain a mercury-bound form with crystals of either the C96S or C159S mutants, but we were able to generate a mercury-bound form with crystals of the C160S mutant. These results demonstrate that Cys-96 and Cys-159 have a role in substrate binding, carbon-mercury bond cleavage, and regulation of mercury ion release from the active site. Asp-99 as a Proton Donor—The common mechanism for chemical cleavage of carbon-mercury bonds involves the activation of the mercury atom by nucleophilic ligands followed by protonolysis of the carbon-mercury bond (18Melnick J.G. Parkin G. Science. 2007; 317: 225-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 35Wilhelm M. Deeken S. Berssen E. Saak W. Lützen A. Koch R. Strasdeit H. Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2004; 2004: 2301-2312Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although difficult, the critical step appears to be the formation of organomercurial compounds with high coordination numbers. Once the high coordination number has been achieved, the protonolysis step is relatively easy to perform (18Melnick J.G. Parkin G. Science. 2007; 317: 225-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Comparison of the crystal structure of TmButHgCH2CN with the crystal structures of MerB indicates that MerB cleaves the carbon-mercury bond in a manner similar to these chemical methods. As proposed earlier, Cys-96 would initially attack the organomercurial, and we postulated that the Asp-99 would deprotonate Cys-96. The carboxylate of Asp-99 is in closer proximity to Cys-96 (3.6 Å) in the free form than it is to Cys-159 (4.3 Å). Following attack by Cys-159 to form an organomercurial compound with a high coordination number, Asp-99 is perfectly positioned to donate the proton required for the protonolysis step. Thus, Asp-99 would serve as the proton mediator or acid/base catalyst by deprotonating the sulfhydryl group of Cys-96 and then donating this proton to the carbon moiety for protonolysis. In all of the MerB sequences isolated from bacteria resistant to organomercurials, Asp-99 is strictly conserved except for one sequence where it is substituted by a serine. Interestingly this variant shows a much narrower range of substrate specificity (36Huang C.C. Narita M. Yamagata T. Endo G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 239: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). NMR studies with a D99A MerB mutant demonstrated that this protein is improperly folded and does not cleave carbon-mercury bonds under the same conditions as MerB (data not shown). This points to the uniqueness of the MerB active site and emphasizes the importance of Asp-99 in the catalytic mechanism of MerB. Mechanism—Based on the crystal structures of MerB, we propose a model for the mechanism of carbon-mercury bond cleavage (Scheme 1). This mechanism is analogous to previously proposed mechanisms (15Begley T.P. Walts A.E. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7192-7200Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 16Pitts K.E. Summers A.O. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10287-10296Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18Melnick J.G. Parkin G. Science. 2007; 317: 225-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 35Wilhelm M. Deeken S. Berssen E. Saak W. Lützen A. Koch R. Strasdeit H. Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2004; 2004: 2301-2312Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 37Gopinath E. Bruice T.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 7903-7905Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In particular, it is in agreement with the hypothesis that a carboxylate group present in MerB would serve as the proton mediator for the carbon-mercury bond cleavage (37Gopinath E. Bruice T.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 7903-7905Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, the crystal structures enable better description of the order in which the cysteine residues attack and identify Asp-99 as the residue that serves as the proton mediator. In our model, an exogenous thiol is bound to the organomercurial in the cytoplasm of the cell. The first step involving MerB is the deprotonation of Cys-96 by Asp-99. Once deprotonated, Cys-96 attacks the organomercurial compound, and almost simultaneously Cys-159 attacks the mercury atom and displaces the exogenous thiol. These two reactions result in the formation of a higher order species with mercury trigonally bound. This higher coordination state recruits structural elements necessary to form the hydrophobic binding pocket between the flexible loop (residues 146–161) and the amino-terminal helix (residues 3–14). The trigonally bound mercury is positioned in proximity to Asp-99, which serves to polarize the carbon-mercury bond and stabilize the carbanion that is then protonolyzed by Asp-99. This results in bond cleavage and the retention of the ionic mercury in the active site. The ionic mercury is then directly shuttled to MerA for reduction. In this manner, MerB and MerA keep the toxic organomercurial and ionic mercury species bound at all times and thus minimize their damaging interactions with other cellular proteins. In this study, we solved the crystal structure of MerB in its free and mercury-bound forms. These structures provide important information that is essential to ongoing attempts to exploit the potential of the mer system in the bioremediation of methylmercury.

https://openalex.org/W2087015119,"We hypothesized that the peptidoglycan component of B. anthracis may play a critical role in morbidity and mortality associated with inhalation anthrax. To explore this issue, we purified the peptidoglycan component of the bacterial cell wall and studied the response of human peripheral blood cells. The purified B. anthracis peptidoglycan was free of non-covalently bound protein but contained a complex set of amino acids probably arising from the stem peptide. The peptidoglycan contained a polysaccharide that was removed by mild acid treatment, and the biological activity remained with the peptidoglycan and not the polysaccharide. The biological activity of the peptidoglycan was sensitive to lysozyme but not other hydrolytic enzymes, showing that the activity resides in the peptidoglycan component and not bacterial DNA, RNA or protein. B. anthracis peptidoglycan stimulated monocytes to produce primarily TNFα; neutrophils and lymphocytes did not respond. Peptidoglycan stimulated monocyte p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and p38 activity was required for TNFα production by the cells. We conclude that peptidoglycan in B. anthracis is biologically active, that it stimulates a proinflammatory response in monocytes, and uses the p38 kinase signal transduction pathway to do so. Given the high bacterial burden in pulmonary anthrax, these findings suggest that the inflammatory events associated with peptidoglycan may play an important role in anthrax pathogenesis."

Although the sclera does not contribute significantly to visual perception, scleral diseases such as refractory scleritis, scleral perforation and pathological myopia are considered incurable or difficult to cure. The aim of this study is to identify characteristics of the human sclera as one of the connective tissues derived from the neural crest and mesoderm.We have demonstrated microarray data of cultured human infant scleral cells. Hierarchical clustering was performed to group scleral cells and other mesenchymal cells into subcategories. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed similarity between scleral cells and auricular cartilage-derived cells. Cultured micromasses of scleral cells exposed to TGF-betas and BMP2 produced an abundant matrix. The expression of cartilage-associated genes, such as Indian hedge hog, type X collagen, and MMP13, was up-regulated within 3 weeks in vitro. These results suggest that human 'sclera'-derived cells can be considered chondrocytes when cultured ex vivo.Our present study shows a chondrogenic potential of human sclera. Interestingly, the sclera of certain vertebrates, such as birds and fish, is composed of hyaline cartilage. Although the human sclera is not a cartilaginous tissue, the human sclera maintains chondrogenic potential throughout evolution. In addition, our findings directly explain an enigma that the sclera and the joint cartilage are common targets of inflammatory cells in rheumatic arthritis. The present global gene expression database will contribute to the clarification of the pathogenesis of developmental diseases such as high myopia."
https://openalex.org/W2059713022,"Voltage-dependent N-type Ca2+ channels play important roles in the regulation of diverse neuronal functions in the brain, but little is known about its role in social aggressive behaviors. Mice lacking the α1B subunit (Cav2.2) of N-type Ca2+ channels showed markedly enhanced aggressive behaviors to an intruder mouse in the resident-intruder test. The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), which contains serotonin neurons, is known to be involved in aggression in animals. We thus examined the DRN neurons in the Cav2.2-deficient (Cav2.2–/–) mice. Microinjection of ω-conotoxin GVIA, an N-type Ca2+ channel-specific blocker, into the DRN of wild type mice resulted in escalated aggression, mimicking the phenotypes of Cav2.2–/–. Electrophysiological analysis showed increased firing activity of serotonin neurons with a reduced inhibitory neurotransmission in the Cav2.2–/– DRN. Cav2.2–/– mice showed an elevated level of arginine vasopressin, an aggression-related hormone, in the cerebrospinal fluid.

Voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels play important roles in the regulation of diverse neuronal functions, including neurotransmitter release, regulation of cell membrane excitability, and control of gene expression. Ca2+ influx via N-type Ca2+ channels has a crucial role in controlling the release of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters at presynaptic terminals in central synapses (1Catterall W.A. Cell Calcium.. 1998; 24: 307-323Google Scholar).

Genes Brain Behav.. 2007; 6: 375-388Google Scholar), there was no study of the role of N-type Ca2+ channels in aggression. It is believed that most social animals possess neural mechanisms for the control of aggression, which is essential for maintenance of beneficial relationships among members in a community. Aggression is considered a complex social behavior influenced by both internal (e.g. hormones or genes) and external stimuli (e.g. drive, TV, and frustration etc.) (7de Waal F.B. Science.. 2000; 289: 586-590Google Scholar). Deficit of the control mechanisms for suppression of aggression might be implicated in the development of violence in various psychiatric disorders, such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and personality disorders (8Fountoulakis K.N.

The modulation of aggression has been associated with a change in the central serotonin (5-HT) system at the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) (10Bannai M. Fish E.W. Faccidomo S. Miczek K.A.

In the DRN, the 5-HT neuronal activity showing a slow and regular firing pattern (15Allers K.A. Sharp T. Neuroscience.. 2003; 122: 193-204Google Scholar, 16Trulson M.E. Jacobs B.L.

Brain Res... 1983; 289: 109-119Google Scholar). Furthermore, the modulation of these signals in the DRN affected aggression behaviors in animals (10Bannai M. Fish E.W. Faccidomo S. Miczek K.A. Psychopharmacology.. 2007; 193: 295-304Google Scholar, 11Mos J. Olivier B. Poth M. Van Oorschot R. Van Aken H. Eur. J. Pharmacol... 1993; 238: 411-415Google Scholar, 12Sijbesma H.

Auerbach S.B. Brain Res... 2003; 961: 109-120Google Scholar). It has been shown that the Cav2.2 is highly expressed in the DRN of adult rats (20Tanaka O. Sakagami H. Kondo H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res... 1995; 30: 1-16Google Scholar). However, the role of Cav2.2 in the DRN has not been examined, nor has the involvement of Cav2.2 in the regulation of aggression. Therefore, we have characterized aggression behaviors of Cav2.2–/– mice and investigated the properties of the Cav2.2–/– DRN neurons. Interestingly, the Cav2.2–/– mice exhibited an enhanced aggressive behavior and a reduced inhibitory transmission in the DRN. In addition, Cav2.2–/– mice showed an increased level of arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), together with an increase of 5-HT in the hypothalamus. Our results suggest a possibility that the N-type Ca2+ channel plays a critical role in the suppression of aggressive behaviors. Animals—All of the animals were handled in accordance with the animal care and use guidelines of the Korea Institute of Science and Technology. The animals were housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment with free access to food and water under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. Mice lacking the α1B subunit (Cav2.2) were established previously (2Kim C. Jun K. Lee T. Kim S.S. McEnery M.W. Chin H. Kim H.L. Park J.M. Kim D.K. Jung S.J. Kim J. Shin H.S. Mol. Cell Neurosci... 2001; 18: 235-245Google Scholar). For this study, homozygotes (Cav2.2–/–) in the F1 (C57BL/6J × 129S4/SvJae) background were produced by crossing heterozygous 129 co-isogenic mice (Cav2.2+/–) with heterozygous N12 C57BL/6J mice (Cav2.2+/–). The Cav2.2–/– male mice (10–15 weeks old) in the F1 background were used for behavioral tests, and wild type littermates served as control. All of the behavioral experiments were performed and videotaped by one investigator, and the tape was interpreted by another investigator blinded to the genotypes of the animals used in the experiments. Resident-Intruder Test—The test was based on a previously described protocol (21Chiavegatto S. Dawson V.L. Mamounas L.A. Koliatsos V.E. Dawson T.M. Nelson R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2001; 98: 1277-1281Google Scholar). The isolation-induced resident-intruder aggression test was conducted by introducing a small, experimentally naïve male C57BL/6J mouse (5–6 weeks old) that had been housed in groups of five into a clear polycarbonate cage (27 × 21 × 17 cm) of a resident male mouse (10–15 weeks old) that had been housed in isolation for at least 4 weeks without a change of bedding for 7 days before testing. The behavior of the resident mouse was videotaped, and offensive aggression was measured by determining the latency to the first attack and total number of bite attacks by the isolated resident mouse during 15 min of exposure to the experimental naive male C57BL/6J intruder mouse. If an animal did not make a bite attack, the latency to the first attack was recorded as 900 s (test duration), and all the other attack scores were recorded as zero. Water Competition Test—The water competition test used was based on a previously described method (22Muehlenkamp F. Lucion A. Vogel W.H. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav... 1995; 50: 671-674Google Scholar). Male mice of both genotypes of equal weight were paired and housed together in a same cage. After 6 days, the animals were deprived of water for 23 h. One water bottle was introduced with a shielded spout so that only one animal could drink at a time. The time (in seconds) of spout possession and water consumption were recorded for 2 min. The animal with the longest duration of water consumption and spout possession was considered to be the dominant animal. Intra-raphe Injection and Histology—Wild type male mice were anesthetized with Avertin® (2,2,2 tribromoethanol; 0.2 ml/10 g of 20 mg/ml solution), and a 26-gauge guide cannular (Plastics One) for microinjection of the N-type Ca2+ channel blocker, ω-conotoxin GVIA (ω-GVIA), was stereotaxically placed into the DRN. The cannular was implanted at anterior-posterior = –4.5 mm from the bregma; lateral = ±1.2 mm; ventral = –4.0 mm; tilted 22.5 degree, as calculated from the mouse brain atlas (23Kang S.J. Cho S.H. Park K. Yi J. Yoo S.J. Shin K.S. Mol. Cells.. 2008; 25: 124-130Google Scholar). After 10 days, the animals were injected either with vehicle (0.9% NaCl containing 1 mg/ml cytochrome C) alone or with ω-GVIA (9 ng/0.2 μl/5 min, Alomone) into the DRN 1 h before the resident-intruder test. After the experiments, the mice were deeply anesthetized by injection of Avertin®, and the brains were removed, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for at least 48 h, and stored in a 30% sucrose solution until being sliced on a freezing microtome (30-μm-thick sections) (23Kang S.J. Cho S.H. Park K. Yi J. Yoo S.J. Shin K.S. Mol. Cells.. 2008; 25: 124-130Google Scholar). The brains were lightly stained with cresyl violet for histological verification of needle placement. All of the injection sites included in the statistical analyses were referenced to the mouse brain atlas (24Paxinos G. Franklin K.B.J. The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates.2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego2001Google Scholar) and illustrated in Fig. 2. Extracellular Recording of 5-HT Neurons—Mice (8–12 weeks old) were decapitated, and coronal 400-μm brain stem slices containing the DRN were prepared in oxygenated cold artificial CSF (124 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm KCl, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 1.3 mm MgSO4, 26 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4). After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, a single slice was submerged in a recording chamber and continuously superfused with oxygenated artificial CSF (34 °C; 95% O2/5% CO2) (25Jeon D. Song I. Guido W. Kim K. Kim E. Oh U. Shin H.S. J. Biol. Chem... 2008; 283: 12093-12101Google Scholar). Firing was recorded in the DRN using a borosilicate glass microelectrode (8–10 MΩ) filled with 2 m NaCl and evoked by adding the α1-adrenoreceptor agonist phenylephrine (3 μm) (17Vandermaelen C.P. Aghajanian G.K. Brain Res... 1983; 289: 109-119Google Scholar). The cells were identified as putative 5-HT neurons according to the following criteria: biphasic action potentials, long spike width (>2 ms), slow and regular pattern of discharges, and reversible inhibition by 5-HT (100 μm) (15Allers K.A. Sharp T. Neuroscience.. 2003; 122: 193-204Google Scholar, 17Vandermaelen C.P. Aghajanian G.K. Brain Res... 1983; 289: 109-119Google Scholar). Signals were amplified 10,000-fold and filtered at 300∼3000 Hz by a Cyberamp-402 amplifier (Axon Instruments), digitized at a 10-kHz sampling rate, and stored in a computer (Digidata; Axon Instruments). The number of spikes was quantified using Mini-Analysis software (Synaptosoft). Whole Cell Patch Clamp Recording of 5-HT Neurons—Mice (2.5–3.5 weeks old) were decapitated, and brain stem slices (250∼300 μm) containing the DRN were prepared as described above for extracellular recordings, and the methods of patch clamp recording were described in our previous report (25Jeon D. Song I. Guido W. Kim K. Kim E. Oh U. Shin H.S. J. Biol. Chem... 2008; 283: 12093-12101Google Scholar). Pipettes (3–4 MΩ) were filled with the internal solution for patch clamp recording (140 mm KCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 4.6 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 4 mm Na-ATP, and 0.4 mm Na-GTP, adjusted to pH 7.3 with KOH). The DRNs were visually identified by their position along the midline in the slice and by their morphology. Although the staining of 5-HT or tryptophan hydroxylase is needed exactly to identify a 5-HT neuron, cells, at least, that meet the electrophysiological criteria of a 5-HT neuron were recorded (supplemental data). For IPSC and EPSC measurement, the cells were voltage-clamped at –60 mV. GABA receptor-mediated sIPSC and eIPSC was isolated and recorded in the presence of 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2.3-dione (10 μm, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor antagonist), dl-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (50 μm, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist), and CGP 55845 (5 μm, a selective GABAB receptor antagonist). sEPSC and eEPSC were measured in the presence of bicuculline (10 μm, GABAA receptor antagonist) and CGP 55845. For the eIPSC and eEPSC experiments, the current was evoked within DRN by a bipolar tungsten electrode. The signals were filtered at 2 kHz, digitized at 5 kHz sampling rate, and stored in a computer (Digidata; Axon Instrument). The data was analyzed by Minianlysis software (Synaptosoft Inc.). Radioimmunoassay of AVP—To determine the basal levels of CSF AVP hormones, individually housed male mice were left undisturbed for 4 weeks and anesthetized with Avertin® in the light phase. Collection of CSF samples was based on what was described by DeMattos et al. (26DeMattos R.B. Bales K.R. Parsadanian M. O'Dell M.A. Foss E.M. Paul S.M. Holtzman D.M. J. Neurochem... 2002; 81: 229-236Google Scholar). Clear CSF samples were drawn (10–15 μl/animal) from the cisterna magna using a glass capillary to avoid blood contamination of CSF. All of the samples were centrifuged for at 3000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The clear supernatants were stored at –70 °C until the assay. The AVP levels were measured in 10-μl samples of CSF using a radioimmunoassay kit (Peninsula Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Ventricular Infusion of a V1a Receptor Antagonist—Male mice were anesthetized with Avertin®, and an osmotic pump (flow rate, 0.25 μl/h; ALZET) for infusion of AVP antagonist was stereotaxically placed with its tip into a lateral ventricle region. The stereotaxic coordinates for the microinfusion were anterior-posterior = –0.22 mm from the bregma; lateral = ±1.0 mm; ventral = –2.8 mm. The animals were infused with either vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline) or the selective V1a receptor antagonist d((CH2) 15,Tyr(Me)2,Arg8)-vasopressin (AVP-8, 10 ng/μl; Bachem) into the lateral ventricle using the pump according to the manufacturer's protocols. After 10 days, the resident-intruder test was performed. Analysis of Monoamines by High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)—The adult brain was rapidly removed and dissected on ice as previously described (27Iversen L.L. Glowinski J. J. Neurochem... 1966; 13: 671-682Google Scholar). The hypothalamus was immediately homogenized in 0.1 m perchloric acid with a Tissue Tearer (Biospec) at 30,000 rpm for 30 s. The homogenates (5% w/v) were centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected and stored at –70 °C until analysis. The endogenous levels of norepinephrine, dopamine, 5-HT, and their metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, homovanillic acid, and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) were determined by reverse phase HPLC with an ICA-3063 electrochemical detector (Toa). Briefly, 10-μl portions of the samples were separated using a C18 reversed-phase column (octadecyl silica; 4.6 mm × 150 mm; NaKalai, Japan) and separated using a mobile phase of 85:15 0.5 m KH2PO4, pH 3.2, containing 2.5 mm 1-octane sulfate and 10-μm EDTA/methanol delivered at 0.9 ml/min. The oxidation potential of the detector was fixed at 750 mV using a glass carbon working electrode versus an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The peak areas of the internal standard (dihydrobenzylamine) were used to quantify the sample peaks. The values obtained were expressed as μg/g of tissue wet weight. Statistical Analyses—All of the values are presented as the means ± S.E. of the means (S.E.), and statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. The values were considered statistically different at p < 0.05. Enhanced Aggression in Cav2.2–/– Mice—To quantify the aggressive behaviors of Cav2.2–/– male mice, we performed the resident-intruder test (21Chiavegatto S. Dawson V.L. Mamounas L.A. Koliatsos V.E. Dawson T.M. Nelson R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2001; 98: 1277-1281Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 (A and B), Cav2.2–/– mice showed a significantly shortened latency to the first attack on the intruder mouse and an increased number of attacks compared with wild type male littermates, showing that Cav2.2–/– mice are significantly more aggressive than the wild type mice. Because dominant males are more aggressive than subordinate males in intermale conflicts to maintain their social position (28Raleigh M.J. McGuire M.T. Brammer G.L. Pollack D.B. Yuwiler A. Brain Res... 1991; 559: 181-190Google Scholar), we next performed the water competition test (22Muehlenkamp F. Lucion A. Vogel W.H. Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav... 1995; 50: 671-674Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, Cav2.2–/– mice displayed a longer duration of water consumption than the wild type. There was no significant difference in the duration of water consumption over a 2-min test period between the two genotypes, when they were separately housed (data not shown). These results demonstrate that Cav2.2–/– mice are dominant over the wild type mice in social interactions. Intra-raphe Injection of an N-type Ca2+ Channel Blocker—To examine whether the inactivation of N-type Ca2+ channels in the DRN is responsible for the increased aggression of Cav2.2–/– mice, we focally injected an N-type Ca2+ channel blocker, ω-conotoxin GVIA (ω-GVIA), into the DRN of wild type male mice according to the procedures described under “Experimental Procedures.” The mice microinjected with ω-GVIA showed symptoms mimicking the phenotype of the Cav2.2–/– mice: a significantly reduced latency to the first attack and an increased number of bite attacks on the intruder compared with the saline-treated control mice (Fig. 2, C and D). Histological analyses confirmed that injection placements were correctly located in the dorsal raphe (Fig. 2B). An example of the cannular tract and injection site is shown in Fig. 2A. These results indicate that the highly aggressive behaviors of Cav2.2–/– mice was primarily due to a lack of N-type Ca2+ channels in the DRN and also suggest that a developmental anomaly is not a factor in the expression of the aggression phenotype. Increased Activities of 5-HT Neurons in Cav2.2–/– Mice—To define the alterations in the DRN that resulted from the mutation and were responsible for the aggression phenotype, we examined the physiological properties of the DRN in slices. First, we recorded extracellularly the single-unit activities from the putative 5-HT neurons, identified according to the criteria described in literature (15Allers K.A. Sharp T. Neuroscience.. 2003; 122: 193-204Google Scholar, 17Vandermaelen C.P. Aghajanian G.K. Brain Res... 1983; 289: 109-119Google Scholar), in the DRN slices of the wild type and Cav2.2–/– mice. Firing was induced by adding the α1-adrenoreceptor agonist phenylephrine (3 μm). The results show that 5-HT neurons of the Cav2.2–/– DRN fired more frequently than those of the wild type mice (wild type, 1.66 ± 0.16 Hz; Cav2.2–/– mice, 2.85 ± 0.23 Hz; p < 0.01; Student's t test) (Fig. 3, A and B). For further analysis of 5-HT neurons in the DRN of the Cav2.2–/– mice, we next tried to identify 5-HT neurons, based on electrophysiological criteria as described under “Experimental Procedures” and supplemental data and measured their activity by whole cell patch clamp recordings with the procedures. We analyzed individual action potential shapes in the current clamp recordings. There was no difference in the amplitude or duration of action potential or in the amplitude of after hyperpolarization between the wild type and Cav2.2–/– mice (supplemental Fig. S1 and Table S1). However, when we slightly depolarized membrane potential of the cells by an intracellular current injection of +20 pA, we consistently observed that the 5-HT neurons in the Cav2.2–/– DRN fired more frequently than those of the wild type mice (wild type, 2.48 ± 0.27 Hz; Cav2.2–/–, 3.57 ± 0.36 Hz; p < 0.05; Student's t test) (Fig. 4, A–C, before bicuculline). These results were consistent with the extracellular single-unit recordings as described above (Fig. 3). The activity of 5-HT neurons can be highly modulated by input from the GABAergic interneurons (19Tao R. Auerbach S.B. Brain Res... 2003; 961: 109-120Google Scholar). To test whether the increased firing rate of 5-HT neurons in the Cav2.2–/– DRN was due to a decreased GABA inhibition, we recorded neuronal activities from identified 5-HT neurons, based on electrophysiological criteria, in the presence of bicuculline, a GABAA receptor antagonist. The application of bicuculline (10 μm) increased the firing rates in both Cav2.2–/– and the wild type to a similar level (the wild type with bicuculline, 4.01 ± 0.51 Hz; Cav2.2–/– with bicuculline, 4.56 ± 0.39 Hz; p = 0.48; Student's t test) (Fig. 4C). However, the magnitude of the increase of the firing rate was significantly greater (p < 0.01; Student's t test) in the wild type (161.56 ± 7.55%) than in the Cav2.2–/– (131.10 ± 4.75%), reflecting the already increased level of firing in the mutant, presumably because of decreased inhibition (Fig. 4D). These results suggested a possibility that the increased firing rate in the 5-HT neurons of Cav2.2–/– mice was due to an impaired GABA transmission in the DRN. Decreased GABA Release in the Cav2.2–/– DRN—To define further how the inhibitory transmission is altered in the Cav2.2–/– DRN, we measured spontaneous and evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSC and eIPSC, respectively) from identified 5-HT neurons, based on electrophysiological criteria, in DRN slices under a voltage-clamp configuration. We found that the frequency of sIPSC in Cav2.2–/– neurons was significantly reduced compared with that of wild type neurons (wild type, 3.17 ± 0.68 Hz; Cav2.2–/–, 1.05 ± 0.48 Hz; p < 0.05; Fig. 5B), without any significant change in the amplitude (wild type, 46.84 ± 14.42 pA; Cav2.2–/–, 41.74 ± 3.94 pA; p = 0.85; Fig. 5C). Furthermore, this reduction of sIPSC in the Cav2.2–/– was mimicked in the wild type slices by an N-type channel blocker; when ω-GVIA (1 μm) was added to the recording solution of the wild type slice (n = 5), the frequency of the sIPSC was reduced to the values displayed in the Cav2.2–/– (wild type with ω-GVIA, 1.18 ± 0.45 Hz; Fig. 5B), without any change in the amplitude (wild type with ω-GVIA, 42.04 ± 11.40 pA; Fig. 5C). Next, we recorded the eIPSC in 5-HT neurons following a focal stimulation within the DRN. The maximum amplitude of eIPSC in the Cav2.2–/– was lower than that in the wild type (wild type, 172.89 ± 20.53 pA; Cav2.2–/–, 32.69 ± 5.92 pA; p < 0.0001; Fig. 5D). Furthermore, application of ω-GVIA to the wild type slice significantly reduced the amplitude of eIPSC, by 75% (Fig. 5E). These results on sIPSC and eIPSC indicate that presynaptic GABA release is impaired with normal postsynaptic GABA responses in the Cav2.2–/– DRN and suggest that N-type Ca2+ channels have a crucial role in the release of GABA in the DRN. In contrast to IPSC, there was no difference in the frequency or amplitude of the spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current (sEPSC) between the two genotypes (supplemental Fig. S2, B and C). The maximum amplitude of evoked excitatory postsynaptic current (eEPSC) in the Cav2.2–/– was also similar to that of the wild type (supplemental Fig. S2, D and E). Thus, these results indicate that excitatory transmissions into 5-HT neurons were not altered in the Cav2.2–/– DRN. Increased Levels of CSF AVP and Hypothalamic 5-HT/5-HIAA in Cav2.2–/–—Central AVP is known to play an important role in the regulation of aggressive behaviors. In particular, an increased level of CSF AVP has been consistently implicated in enhanced aggressive behaviors in various species including humans (29Ferris C.F. Potegal M. Physiol. Behav... 1988; 44: 235-239Google Scholar, 30Haller J. Makara G.B. Barna I. Kovacs K. Nagy J. Vecsernyes M. J. Neuroendocrinol... 1996; 8: 361-365Google Scholar, 31Coccaro E.F. Kavoussi R.J. Hauger R.L. Cooper T.B. Ferris C.F. Arch. Gen. Psychiatry.. 1998; 55: 708-714Google Scholar). We thus tried to measure AVP levels in the CSF of the Cav2.2–/– mice and found that the Cav2.2–/– mice have a significantly higher level of AVP in the CSF compared with wild type mice (Fig. 6A). We then examined whether the increased level of AVP is related to the enhanced aggression of Cav2.2–/– mice. It has been demonstrated that microinjection of the AVP receptor (V1a) antagonist d(CH2)5,Tyr(Me)AVP into the anterior hypothalamus of the golden hamster rapidly inhibits aggression (29Ferris C.F. Potegal M. Physiol. Behav... 1988; 44: 235-239Google Scholar, 32Ferris C.F. Melloni Jr., R.H. Koppel G. Perry K.W. Fuller R.W. Delville Y. J. Neurosci... 1997; 17: 4331-4340Google Scholar). In our experiments, microinfusion of an AVP receptor V1a antagonist, d((CH2)51,Tyr(Me)2, Arg8)-vasopressin (AVP-8, 10 ng/μl, 0.25 μl/hr), into the lateral ventricle using an osmotic pump reduced the level of aggressiveness of Cav2.2–/– mice (Fig. 6, B and C). However, the same dose of the antagonist did not affect the aggression behavior of wild type mice (Fig. 6, B and C). These results suggest that the elevation of AVP in the CSF is at least in part involved in the enhanced aggressive behaviors of Cav2.2–/– mice. A large number of studies have revealed that AVP is produced in the hypothalamus, including the paraventricular nucleus, supraoptic nucleus, anterior hypothalamus, and suprachiasmatic nucleus, in addition to other brain areas including bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial amygdale, and lateral septum (32Ferris C.F. Melloni Jr., R.H. Koppel G. Perry K.W. Fuller R.W. Delville Y. J. Neurosci... 1997; 17: 4331-4340Google Scholar, 33Davis E.S. Marler C.A.

Ferris C.F. Brain Behav. Evol... 2000; 55: 53-76Google Scholar). Moreover, those AVP neurons in the hypothalamus are innervated by serotonergic neurons originating in the dorsal and median raphe nucleus (36Sawchenko P.E. Swanson L.W. Steinbusch H.W. Verhofstad A.A. Brain Res... 1983; 277: 355-360Google Scholar, 37Larsen P.J. Hay-Schmidt A. Vrang N. Mikkelsen J.D. Neuroscience.. 1996; 70: 963-988Google Scholar). Therefore, we next attempted to measure the amount of monoamines including 5-HT in the hypothalamus of the Cav2.2–/– mice using HPLC. The results revealed that the levels of 5-HT and 5-HIAA were significantly elevated in the Cav2.2–/– hypothalamus compared with those of the wild type (Fig. 6D), indicating increased 5-HT release in the Cav2.2–/– hypothalamus. However, there was no significant difference in the levels of other monoamines between the two genotypes. In this study, we examined aggressive b"
https://openalex.org/W1999804485,"The level of the MafA transcription factor is regulated by a variety of effectors of β cell function, including glucose, fatty acids, and insulin. Here, we show that phosphorylation at Ser65 of mammalian MafA influences both protein stability and transactivation potential. Replacement of Ser65 with Glu to mimic phosphorylation produced a protein that was as unstable as the wild type, whereas Asp or Ala mutation blocked degradation. Analysis of MafA chimeric and deletion constructs suggests that protein phosphorylation at Ser65 alone represents the initial degradation signal, with ubiquitinylation occurring within the C terminus (amino acids 234–359). Although only wild type MafA and S65E were polyubiquitinylated, both S65D and S65E potently stimulated transactivation compared with S65A. Phosphorylation at Ser14 also enhanced activation, although it had no impact on protein turnover. The mobility of MafA S65A was profoundly affected upon SDS-PAGE, with the S65E and S65D mutants influenced less due to their ability to serve as substrates for glycogen synthase kinase 3, which acts at neighboring N-terminal residues after Ser65 phosphorylation. Our observations not only illustrate the sensitivity of the cellular transcriptional and degradation machinery to phosphomimetic mutants at Ser65, but also demonstrate the singular importance of phosphorylation at this amino acid in regulating MafA activity.

The mammalian MafA transcription factor was originally isolated due to the significance to insulin gene expression (1Matsuoka T.-A. Zhao L. Artner I. Jarrett H.W. Friedman D. Means A. Stein R. Mol.

Islet β cell-specific transcription of the insulin gene appears to be mediated by interactions between MafA and other islet-enriched factors, including Pdx1 and NeuroD1 (also known as BETA2) (5Zhao L.

Notably, MafA is first observed during pancreatic development in the wave of insulin+ cells that eventually mature into islet β cells (6Matsuoka T.-A. Artner I. Henderson E. Means A. Sander M. Stein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2930-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), a unique property in relation to all other islet-enriched regulators (7Aramata S. Han S.-I.

MacDonald R.J. Curr. Opin Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, MafA is not essential to β cell development, presumably due to compensation by MafB (3Artner I. Blanchi B. Raum J.C. Guo M. Kaneko T. Cordes S. Sieweke M. Stein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Diabetes. 2006; 55: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). MafA appears to act as a barometer of adult β cell function. For example, this factor is exclusively expressed in β cells within the context of the pancreas, and global mafA knock-out mice are diabetic due in part to compromised insulin secretion capacity (12Zhang C. Moriguchi T. Kajihara M. Esaki R. Harada A. Shimohata H. Oishi H. Hamada M. Morito N. Hasegawa K. Kudo T. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Takahashi S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4969-4976Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In addition, human embryonic stem cells differentiated to produce insulin and many islet-enriched transcription factors were neither glucose-responsive nor capable of protecting against streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia until becoming MafA+ (13Kroon E.

Precisely how these effectors influence MafA expression is unclear but is likely through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional control mechanisms. Members of the large Maf family are highly phosphorylated proteins, although how this modification influences activity has principally been examined with avian homologs. For example, alanine mutations in the ERK1/2-like 4The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular signal-regulation protein kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild type; GFP, green fluorescent protein.4The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular signal-regulation protein kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild type; GFP, green fluorescent protein. sites at Ser14 and Ser65 of quail MafA influenced both the activity of this oncogene in transformation assays and lens α-, β-, and δ-crystalline gene transcription (19Benkhelifa S.

Ser65 phosphorylation was also recently shown to be essential to GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3) activity at neighboring serines and threonines in quail and mouse MafA, with these events associated with activation and protein stability (20Rocques N.

Aramata S. Yasuda K. Kataoka K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6593-6605Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Stimulation of quail protein activity was through recruitment of the p300/CBP-associated factor co-activator to the N-terminal activation domain (20Rocques N. Abou Zeid N. Sii-Felice K. Lecoin L. Felder-Schmittbuhl M.P. Eychene A. Pouponnot C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 584-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), whereas glucose levels in islet β cells were proposed to regulate the degradation of mouse MafA (21Han S.-I. Aramata S. Yasuda K. Kataoka K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6593-6605Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Here, we examined if the protein levels and activation properties of mouse MafA could be influenced by Ser14, Ser65, and/or Thr267 phosphorylation. Phosphomimetic glutamic and aspartic acid substitution mutants were used in these studies to examine how phosphorylation potentially affected activity. The mobility of S65A was found to be faster and similar to phosphatase-treated MafA, whereas the S65E and S65D mutants behaved more like the wild type. Both the S65E and S65D mutants in MafA were also found to be substrates for GSK3. However, only the S65E mutant, and not the S65D or S65A mutants, was polyubiquitinylated and degraded in a wild type manner. In contrast, S65D, S65E, as well as S14E potentiated MafA-mediated activation. We discuss the possibility that Ser65 phosphorylation is pivotal in controlling both the degradation and activation potential of MafA. DNA Constructs—The S14A, S14E, S65A, S65E, S65D, and T267A mutants were prepared in cytomegalovirus-driven Myc-MafA expression plasmid using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Wild type Gal4-MafA (amino acids 1–359) and the 1–75 and 1–233 mutants were constructed by subcloning PCR-generated mouse MafA sequences into the simian virus 40 promoter/enhancer-driven Gal4 expression plasmid pSG424 (22Lillie J.W.

Cell Culture and Transfections—Monolayer cultures of HeLa and mouse islet βTC-3 cells were maintained as described previously (24Zhao L. Cissell M.A. Henderson E. Colbran R. Stein R. J. Biol.

Gal4-MafA (0.5 μg) and (Gal4)5E1bLuc (0.5 μg) were transfected using the Lipofectamine procedure (Invitrogen) on 6-well plates. The herpes simplex virus promoter-driven Renilla luciferase expression plasmid phRL-TK (Promega) was used as a recovery marker (10 ng), with 1 μg of total DNA used for each point. The Dual-Luciferase assay (Promega) was performed 40–48 h after transfection according to the manufacturer's directions. Each experiment was repeated at least three times using at least two different plasmid preparations. To measure the turnover rate of MafA, βTC-3 cells were cultured in 100-mm dishes and first transfected with 4 μg of the MafA expression construct. Medium containing 0.2 mm glucose and 18 μm cycloheximide was added 48 h post-transfection (termed zero time), and cell nuclear extracts (25Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3912) Google Scholar) were prepared at the indicated times. The MafA and Pdx1 levels were measured by Western analysis using anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-Pdx1 (a gift of Dr. Chris Wright, Vanderbilt University) antibodies, respectively. Ubiquitinylation Assay—HeLa cells were transfected on 100-mm plates with 4 μg of cytomegalovirus-MafA and/or 2 μg of cytomegalovirus-human HA-ubiquitin expression vector (a gift from Dr. Hal Moses, Vanderbilt University). The cells were then washed twice after 48 h with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). After centrifugation, the soluble protein was incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-MafA antibody (1:100; Bethyl Laboratories) and immunoprecipitated with protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The beads were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and the eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-HA antibody (Sigma). In Vivo Labeling of MafA and 32P-Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—HeLa cells were infected with adenovirus-driven MafA (5Zhao L. Guo M. Matsuoka T.-A. Hagman D.K. Parazzoli S.D. Poitout V. Stein R. J.

The washed pelleted cells were suspended for 30 min in 0.3 ml of 8 m urea (in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl), and the dissolved proteins were mixed at room temperature with 0.1 ml of nickel-agarose beads (Qiagen) for 30 min. The MafA bound beads were washed two times with 1 ml of 8 m urea, once with 1 ml of 5 mm imidazole (in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl), and once with 1 ml of buffer alone (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl), and then MafA was eluted with 0.1 ml of 500 mm imidazole (in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaCl). 32P-Labeled MafA was localized after 10% SDS-PAGE by x-ray film exposure and cut from the gel. The eluted protein was hydrolyzed with 6 n HCl as described previously (26Hunter T. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2034-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and cold phosphoserine (Sigma), phosphothreonine (Sigma), and phosphotyrosine (Sigma) served as position markers. The Phosphorylation State of MafA Affects Mobility after SDS-PAGE—The DNA binding activity of mammalian MafA is inhibited by endogenous and exogenous (e.g. calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase and a rat brain-enriched phosphatase preparation (24Zhao L. Cissell M.A. Henderson E. Colbran R. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10532-10537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Matsuoka T.-A. Zhao L. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22071-22076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar)) phosphatases. The phosphoamino acid composition of MafA was assessed in HeLa cells infected with an adenovirus-expressing mouse MafA in medium containing [32P]orthophosphate. Two-dimensional electrophoresis of acid-hydrolyzed, nickel affinity-purified 32P-labeled MafA revealed that the principal site of phosphorylation was serine, with a serine:threonine ratio of ∼12 (Fig. 1A). The phosphorylation status of MafA influenced mobility after SDS-PAGE. Thus, MafA migrated noticeably faster after either rat brain-enriched phosphatase preparation treatment or upon incubation of βTC-3 cell nuclear extract in the absence of protein phosphatase inhibitors at 30 °C (Fig. 1B), the permissible temperature of the endogenous MafA phosphatase(s) (24Zhao L. Cissell M.A. Henderson E. Colbran R. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10532-10537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The slower and faster mobility forms were termed hyperphosphorylated and hypophosphorylated MafA, respectively. The migration of phosphatase-treated MafA was similar to the reticulocyte lysate-translated protein, presumably reflecting suboptimal conditions for phosphorylation in this in vitro system. MafA levels are very sensitive to a variety of metabolic effectors of β cell function, including glucose and fatty acids (14Kataoka K. Han S.-I. Shioda S. Hirai M. Nishizawa M. Handa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49903-49910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 15Poitout V. Hagman D. Stein R. Artner I. Robertson R.P. Harmon J.S. J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 32413-32418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To determine the influence of these effectors on MafA mobility, rat islets were next cultured under basal (2.8 mm) or stimulatory (16.7 mm) glucose concentrations or in the presence of palmitate, which was previously shown to inhibit MafA expression (15Poitout V. Hagman D. Stein R. Artner I. Robertson R.P. Harmon J.S. J. Nutr. 2006; 136: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 17Hagman D.K. Hays L.B. Parazzoli S.D. Poitout V. J. Biol.

The 46-kDa hyperphosphorylated form was observed principally under all three culture conditions (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the phosphorylation event(s) that impacts MafA mobility is not rate-limiting in β cells. Phosphorylation at Ser65 Alone Influences MafA Mobility—The biological significance of MafA phosphorylation has been examined most extensively with the avian protein (19Benkhelifa S. Provot S.

Felder-Schmittbuhl M.P. Eychene A. Pouponnot C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 584-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For example, phosphorylation at Ser14 and Ser65 appears to potentiate quail MafA activation and transformation (19Benkhelifa S. Provot S. Nabais E. Eychene A. Calothy G. Felder-Schmittbuhl M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4441-4452Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These conserved amino acids can be phosphorylated by ERK2 in vitro (19Benkhelifa S. Provot S. Nabais E. Eychene A. Calothy G. Felder-Schmittbuhl M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4441-4452Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), but this kinase does not appear to be involved in (at least) Ser65 phosphorylation in vivo (21Han S.-I. Aramata S. Yasuda K. Kataoka K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6593-6605Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The kinase regulating Ser65 phosphorylation is unknown; however, its actions were recently shown to be essential for recruitment of GSK3 to act on neighboring Ser61, Thr57, Thr53, and Ser49 residues (20Rocques N.

Here, we have examined how phosphorylation at Ser14, Ser65, and Thr267 could impact mammalian MafA mobility and activity. Thr267 is a conserved amino acid within the DNA-binding domain of MafA and a potential protein kinase A/protein kinase C site (29Civil A. van Genesen S.T. Lubsen N.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 975-982Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alanine substitution mutants in Myc-tagged MafA at Ser14, Ser65, or Thr267 were expressed in βTC-3 (Fig. 2A) and/or HeLa (Fig. 2B) cells. The migration of the S14A and T267A mutants was indistinguishable from the wild type, whereas the S65A mutant was clearly faster. An intermediate migrating form of MafA was produced with glutamic or aspartic acid mutants at Ser65 (Fig. 2A), suggesting that phosphorylation at this site directly impacts mobility. However, mutation of this conserved serine (Ser70) had no effect on the mobility of MafB (Fig. 2C), the other principal large Maf expressed in the islet (11Artner I. Le Lay J. Hang Y. Elghazi L. Schisler J.C. Henderson E. Sosa-Pineda B. Stein R. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 30Nishimura W. Kondo T. Salameh T. El Khattabi I. Dodge R. Bonner-Weir S. Sharma A. Dev. Biol. 2006; 293: 526-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). GSK3 Phosphorylates the S65E and S65D Mutants of MafA—Phosphorylation at Ser65 in MafA is necessary for the sequential actions of GSK3 on Ser49, Thr51, Thr57, and Ser61 (20Rocques N. Abou Zeid N. Sii-Felice K. Lecoin L. Felder-Schmittbuhl M.P. Eychene A. Pouponnot C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 584-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 21Han S.-I. Aramata S. Yasuda K. Kataoka K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6593-6605Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To examine if S65D and S65E served as substrates for further phosphorylation, we incubated HeLa (Fig. 3) and βTC-3 (data not shown) cells expressing these mutants with LiCl, a GSK3 inhibitor (31Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3926) Google Scholar). Notably, only the faster mobility, hypophosphorylated MafA band was detected with the wild type, S65D, and S65E forms in the presence of LiCl, although this inhibitor had no effect on S65A migration. The compression of the S65D and S65E bands after LiCl treatment indicates that both mimic Ser65 phosphorylation. However, these mutants were relatively poor GSK3 substrates as judged by the lower conversion to the slower mobility, hyperphosphorylated band (15 ± 10% conversion of S65D or S65E to the hyperphosphorylated form) (Fig. 3). Significantly, only the S65E mutant was degraded in the same manner as wild type MafA (see below). Phosphorylation at Ser65 Regulates MafA Protein Turnover—The S65A mutant affected not only MafA mobility but also apparently the steady-state level of the protein (Fig. 2, A and B). The change in mutant MafA levels was not a result of nuclear compartmentalization because S65A had the same nuclear enrichment pattern as wild type MafA (supplemental Fig. 1). To directly test whether Ser65 phosphorylation impacted MafA stability, S65A, S65D, S65E, and wild type MafA were expressed in βTC-3 cells in the presence and absence of a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. Nuclear extracts were collected at various time points for Western blot analysis and indeed showed that turnover of S65A was profoundly reduced relative to the wild type (Fig. 4). In contrast, there was little or no effect on endogenous Pdx1 levels. Strikingly, MafA S65E behaved similarly to the wild type in these protein turnover assays, whereas the S65D mutant was very stable, much like S65A (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the protein turnover rate of S14A and T267A was like that of wild type MafA, suggesting that modification of these amino acids does not impact protein stability. These results not only demonstrate that Ser65 plays a pivotal role in regulating MafA levels in β cells, but also illustrate that the protein degradation machinery can distinguish between the “phosphomimetic” S65D and S65E mutants, with recognition of only S65E. Only Wild Type MafA and the S65E Mutant Are Polyubiquitinylated—MafA levels are influenced by glucose, the most important physiological effector of islet β cell activity. Thus, increasing cellular glucose concentrations acutely stimulate (e.g. Fig. 1C) (5Zhao L. Guo M. Matsuoka T.-A. Hagman D.K. Parazzoli S.D. Poitout V. Stein R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 11107-11113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) MafA mRNA and protein expression. The impact of glucose on MafA stability was examined in MIN6 β cells cultured under low-glucose (1 mm) and high-glucose (25 mm) conditions in the presence of cycloheximide; TATA-binding protein served as the internal control. In contrast to recent results suggesting that transfected MafA was less stable under low-glucose conditions (21Han S.-I. Aramata S. Yasuda K. Kataoka K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6593-6605Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we found that the rate of endogenous MafA turnover was insensitive to the glucose concentration in the medium (Fig. 5A). MafA degradation in cycloheximide-treated MIN6 cells was blocked by MG132 (Fig. 5B), an inhibitor of the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway (33Kim D. Kim S.H. Li G.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To examine the specificity of this process in greater detail, a plasmid encoding HA-tagged ubiquitin was co-transfected with wild type MafA and S14A, S65A, S65D, S65E, and T267A mutant expression plasmids. As expected from the protein turnover experiments (Fig. 4), S65E and wild type MafA, and not the S65A and S65D mutants, were polyubiquitinylated (Fig. 6, top panels). The S14A and T267A mutants were also polyubiquitinylated, as predicted. Collectively, the data strongly indicate that phosphorylation at Ser65 regulates MafA stability. Notably, the higher molecular weight and polyubiquitinylated forms of MafA represent a very minor portion of the MafA pool in the cells, which is much less than nonubiquitinylated MafA (Fig. 6, bottom panels). Phosphorylation at Ser65 Stimulates Transactivation—Ser65 is located within the N-terminal activation domain of large Maf proteins (19Benkhelifa S. Provot S. Nabais E. Eychene A. Calothy G. Felder-Schmittbuhl M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4441-4452Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To examine if the phosphorylation at Ser14 and Ser65 affected MafA-mediated transactivation, N-terminal sequences from 1–75 and 1–233 were fused in-frame to the DNA-binding domain of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Gal4 transcription factor (Fig. 7A). Each of the Gal4 expression plasmids, together with a reporter plasmid containing five Gal4 DNA-binding sites upstream of the E1B TATA sequences, was transfected into HeLa cells. Strikingly, wild type Gal4-MafA-(1–75) was much less active than wild type Gal4-MafA-(1–233) (Fig. 7B). In addition, much lower levels of Gal4-MafA-(1–75) were found compared with Gal4-MafA-(1–233) as a result of Ser65-mediated degradation (compare wild type and S65A mutant Gal4-MafA-(1–75) in Fig. 7C). Interestingly, the Ser65 mutants did not affect Gal4-MafA-(1–233) levels (Fig. 7C), which enabled a straightforward comparison of S65A, S65D, and S65E activation ability. Both S65D and S65E stimulated Gal4-MafA-(1–233) activity, whereas S65A and S14A were relatively inactive (Fig. 7D). The increased activity of S14E Gal4-MafA-(1–233) suggests that phosphorylation throughout the activation domain is vital (Fig. 7D), as also supported by the ability of MafA to recruit the p300/CBP-associated factor co-activator after GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of Ser61, Thr57, Thr53, and Ser49 (20Rocques N. Abou Zeid N. Sii-Felice K. Lecoin L. Felder-Schmittbuhl M.P. Eychene A. Pouponnot C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 584-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Ser14, Ser65, and Thr267 were also found to influence insulin gene-driven reporter activity, with S14A (0.55 ± 0.09%) and T267A (0.52 ± 0.11%) specifically compromising expression relative to the wild type. The MafA C-terminal Region (Amino Acids 234–359) Is a Ubiquitin-targeted Region—The ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway requires recognition of a degradation signal (e.g. Ser65 phosphorylation) by E3 ubiquitin ligase and polyubiquitinylation of lysine(s) (34Muratani M. Tansey W.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Both the relatively low lysine density in the N-terminal region of MafA and the comparable stability of the Gal4-MafA-(1–233) mutants suggested that a lysine within the Gal4 DNA-binding region may have been utilized in Gal4-MafA-(1–75) degradation (only 4 of 16 lysines in MafA are located between amino acids 1 and 233). The level of the wild type and S65A versions of Gal4-MafA-(1–233) were compared with those of Gal4-MafA-(1–359) to examine the importance of the C-terminal lysine-rich region of MafA to protein stability. As expected of a lysine(s) necessary to ubiquitin-mediated degradation, Gal4-MafA-(1–359) protein levels were not only lower than Gal4-MafA-(1–233) protein levels but also increased in response to the S65A mutation (Fig. 8A). To further examine the significance of the C-terminal region in MafA degradation, the ubiquitinylation state of the MafA-(1–233) deletion mutant was compared with that of the wild type. This C-terminal truncation mutant was not polyubiquitinylated effectively, and much higher levels were in the cytoplasm compared with the wild type (Fig. 8B and supplemental Fig. 1). MafA is a key activator of adult islet β cell function, specifically through actions on genes associated with cell identity, including the insulin gene (1Matsuoka T.-A. Zhao L. Artner I. Jarrett H.W.

Nutr. 2006; 136: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This transcription factor has been proposed to be a master regulator due to not only the importance of its target genes but also its unusual sensitivity to metabolic effectors (35Wang H. Brun T. Kataoka K. Sharma A.J. Wollheim C.B. Diabetologia. 2007; 50: 348-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Here, we have examined the potential role of phosphorylation in regulating MafA activity and demonstrated that alanine mutations at Ser14 and Ser65 reduced activation. Notably, we found that MafA stability was specifically controlled by modification at Ser65 alone, as a glutamic acid substitution mutant was eliminated through the proteasome degradation pathway, whereas an alanine or aspartic acid mutant was not. Phosphorylation at Ser65 was also recently found to be the nucleating site for GSK3 actions at Ser49, Thr53, Thr57, and Ser61 in quail and mouse MafA (20Rocques N. Abou Zeid N. Sii-Felice K. Lecoin L. Felder-Schmittbuhl M.P. Eychene A. Pouponnot C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 584-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 21Han S.-I. Aramata S. Yasuda K. Kataoka K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6593-6605Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Two recognition signals are necessary for protein degradation in the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway. The initiating event involves binding by E3 enzymes (ubiquitin ligase) to a specific degradation signal sequence (referred to as the degron), which in MafA represents Ser65 phosphorylation. In fact, the degron is commonly found within the activation domain region of transcription factors (34Muratani M. Tansey W.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin is covalently bound to the ∊-amino group of a lysine residue(s), with polyubiquitinylation targeting substrates to the 26 S proteasome. Our results demonstrate that polyubiquitin chains are added to the lysine-rich C-terminal region of MafA, as the full-length Gal4 fusion protein was unstable and sensitive to Ser65 phosphorylation, but the truncated amino acid 1–233 chimera was stable and insensitive (Fig. 8A). Interestingly, MafA-(1–233) was principally found in the cytoplasm (supplemental Fig. 1), indicating that the C-terminal region also contributes to nuclear localization. Significantly, the S65A mutant blocked degradation of MafA (Fig. 4) as well as the amino acid 1–359 (Fig. 8A) and amino acid 1–75 (Fig. 7C) chimeras. We conclude from these results that the MafA degron is defined by phosphorylation of Ser65 alone, as further supported by the instability of the S65E mutant. In contrast, it was recently suggested that MafA stability was regulated by GSK3 phosphorylation of Ser49, Thr53, Thr57, and Ser61 (20Rocques N. Abou Zeid N. Sii-Felice K. Lecoin L. Felder-Schmittbuhl M.P. Eychene A. Pouponnot C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 584-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 21Han S.-I. Aramata S. Yasuda K. Kataoka K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6593-6605Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The principal utilization of multiple alanine site mutants within these studies likely contributes to this discrepancy, although it is noteworthy that only the S65A mutation was shown to stabilize MafA and eliminate MG132 sensitivity (compare S65A with T57A and T53A in Fig. 4D of Ref. 21Han S.-I. Aramata S. Yasuda K. Kataoka K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6593-6605Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We believe that the ∼2-fold reduction in the rate of degradation of compound Ser49, Thr53, Thr57, and Ser61 mutants reflects poor recognition by E3 ligase (compare mutant 4A with WT in Fig. 4A of Ref. 20Rocques N. Abou Zeid N. Sii-Felice K. Lecoin L. Felder-Schmittbuhl M.P. Eychene A. Pouponnot C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 584-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), as the stability of S65D illustrated the exquisite sensitivity of the conjugation machinery (Fig. 4). Notably, this 4A mutant only reduced the rate of MafA degradation, whereas S65A and S65D prevented degradation entirely. Furthermore, both S65E and S65D mutants of MafA were phosphorylated by GSK3 (Fig. 3), yet only S65E was subjected to the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway. In addition, MafA was recently reported to be less stable at low- compared with high-glucose concentrations in β cells (21Han S.-I. Aramata S. Yasuda K. Kataoka K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6593-6605Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which we did not observe (Fig. 5). Our focus on the regulation of endogenous MafA possibly explains the discrepancy with their transfection data. It is likely that glucose-induced MafA expression is regulated at the transcriptional level, as it shares many of the factors involved in glucose-stimulated insulin gene expression (15Poitout V. Hagman D. Stein R. Artner I. Robertson R.P. Harmon J.S. J. Nutr. 2006; 136: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 36Raum J.C. Gerrish K. Artner I. Henderson E. Guo M. Sussel L. Schisler J.C. Newgard C.B. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5735-5743Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at Thr53 and Thr57 in MafA was confirmed using phosphosite-specific antibodies (20Rocques N. Abou Zeid N. Sii-Felice K. Lecoin L. Felder-Schmittbuhl M.P. Eychene A. Pouponnot C. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 584-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We have subjected nickel affinity chromatography-purified MafA to mass spectrometry analysis to directly identify sites of phosphorylation, an approach that previously illustrated quail MafA Ser272 phosphorylation (i.e. equivalent to mouse Ser342 (37Sii-Felice K. Pouponnot C. Gillet S. Lecoin L. Girault J.A. Eychene A. Felder-Schmittbuhl M.P. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3547-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)). Presently, Ser14, Thr53, Ser56, Thr132, Ser234, Ser290, Ser297, and Ser342 phosphorylation has been found by mass spectrometry of mouse MafA (data not shown). Our inability to observe Ser65 phosphorylation probably reflects properties of the proteinase-released peptide, as even the unmodified form was undetectable. Importantly, the ability of S65E and S65D to influence the mobility of MafA by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2) and their impact on its destruction and activation properties strongly suggest that this site is phosphorylated in vivo. Ser14 phosphorylation contributed to transactivation by MafA (Fig. 7) but did not impact protein turnover (Fig. 4). The S14E mutant was equally active compared with the wild type and S14E/S65E in Gal4-MafA-(1–233), whereas the S14A/S65A double mutant was less active than the individual alanine site mutants (Fig. 7D). Collectively, our results demonstrate that phosphorylation at Ser65 alone influences both the steady-state levels and transactivation potential of MafA in β cells. Although Ser65 phosphorylation does not appear to be regulated in vivo (Fig. 1) (21Han S.-I. Aramata S. Yasuda K. Kataoka K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 6593-6605Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), it is likely that the action of GSK3 (and other kinases) on the activation domain will be regulated to potentiate transactivation capabilities and reduce degradation. Evidence supporting such an idea was provided by showing that GSK3-mediated recruitment of the p300/CBP-associated factor co-activator impacted MafA stability (20Rocques N. Abou Zeid N. Sii-Felice K.

https://openalex.org/W1982542119,"Activity plays a critical role in network formation during developmental, experience-dependent, and injury related remodeling. Here we report a mechanism by which axon trajectory can be altered in response to remote neuronal activity. Using photoconductive stimulation to trigger high frequency action potentials in rat hippocampal neurons in vitro, we find that activity functions as an attractive cue for growth cones in the local environment. The underlying guidance mechanism involves astrocyte Ca2+ waves, as the connexin-43 antagonist carbenoxolone abolishes the attraction when activity is initiated at a distance greater than 120 µm. The asymmetric growth cone filopodia extension that precedes turning can be blocked with CNQX (10 µM), but not with the ATP and adenosine receptor antagonists suramin (100 µM) and alloxazine (4 µM), suggesting non-NMDA glutamate receptors on the growth cone mediate the interaction with astrocytes. These results define a potential long-range signalling pathway for activity-dependent axon guidance in which growth cones turn towards directional, temporally coordinated astrocyte Ca2+ waves that are triggered by neuronal activity. To assess the viability of the guidance effect in an injury paradigm, we performed the assay in the presence of conditioned media from lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activated purified microglial cultures, as well as directly activating the glia present in our co-cultures. Growth cone attraction was not inhibited under these conditions, suggesting this mechanism could be used to guide regeneration following axonal injury."
https://openalex.org/W2074206418,"Sulfite dehydrogenases (SDHs) catalyze the oxidation and detoxification of sulfite to sulfate, a reaction critical to all forms of life. Sulfite-oxidizing enzymes contain three conserved active site amino acids (Arg-55, His-57, and Tyr-236) that are crucial for catalytic competency. Here we have studied the kinetic and structural effects of two novel and one previously reported substitution (R55M, H57A, Y236F) in these residues on SDH catalysis. Both Arg-55 and His-57 were found to have key roles in substrate binding. An R55M substitution increased Km(sulfite)(app) by 2-3 orders of magnitude, whereas His-57 was required for maintaining a high substrate affinity at low pH when the imidazole ring is fully protonated. This effect may be mediated by interactions of His-57 with Arg-55 that stabilize the position of the Arg-55 side chain or, alternatively, may reflect changes in the protonation state of sulfite. Unlike what is seen for SDHWT and SDHY236F, the catalytic turnover rates of SDH R55M and SDHH57A are relatively insensitive to pH (approximately 60 and 200 s(-1), respectively). On the structural level, striking kinetic effects appeared to correlate with disorder (in SDHH57A and SDHY236F) or absence of Arg-55 (SDHR55M), suggesting that Arg-55 and the hydrogen bonding interactions it engages in are crucial for substrate binding and catalysis. The structure of SDHR55M has sulfate bound at the active site, a fact that coincides with a significant increase in the inhibitory effect of sulfate in SDHR55M. Thus, Arg-55 also appears to be involved in enabling discrimination between the substrate and product in SDH."
https://openalex.org/W2032196402,"Dermatan sulfate is a highly sulfated polysaccharide and has a variety of biological functions in development and disease. Iduronic acid domains in dermatan sulfate, which are formed by the action of two DS-epimerases, have a key role in mediating these functions. We have identified the catalytic site and three putative catalytic residues in DS-epimerase 1, His-205, Tyr-261, and His-450, by tertiary structure modeling and amino acid conservation to heparinase II. These residues were systematically mutated to alanine or more conserved residues, which resulted in complete loss of epimerase activity. Based on these data and the close relationship between lyase and epimerase reactions, we propose a model where His-450 functions as a general base abstracting the C5 proton from glucuronic acid. Subsequent cleavage of the glycosidic linkage by Tyr-261 generates a 4,5-unsaturated hexuronic intermediate, which is protonated at the C5 carbon by His-205 from the side of the sugar plane opposite to the side of previous proton abstraction. Concomitant recreation of the glycosidic linkage ends the reaction, generating iduronic acid. In addition, we show that proper N-glycosylation of DS-epimerase 1 is required for enzyme activity.

This study represents the first description of the structural basis for epimerization by a glycosaminoglycan epimerase. Chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycans are ubiquitous components of extracellular matrices and have been implicated in several biological processes, such as cell proliferation, cell signaling, wound healing, blood coagulation and neurite outgrowth (1Trowbridge J.M. Gallo R.L. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 117R-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sugahara K. Mikami T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Chondroitin/dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains consist of a repeated disaccharide unit of GlcA and GalNAc, where in DS, 3The abbreviations used are: DS, dermatan sulfate; IdoA, iduronic acid; dK4, defructosylated E. coli K4 capsular polysaccharide; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; DS-Epi1, DS-epimerase 1. in addition to β-d-GlcA, its epimer α-l-iduronic acid (IdoA) can be found to various extents. The chain can also be modified by sulfation of position 2 of GlcA/IdoA and of positions 4 and 6 of GalNAc by sulfotransferases that are specific for each position (3Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The degree of epimerization and sulfation and the position of the sulfate groups vary during development and among tissues and are regulated by growth factors (4Tiedemann K. Olander B. Eklund E. Todorova L. Bengtsson M. Maccarana M. Westergren-Thorsson G. Malmstrom A. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 1277-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The presence of IdoA is critical in mediating several biological functions of dermatan sulfate, such as the binding to hepatocyte growth factor and heparin cofactor II (1Trowbridge J.M. Gallo R.L. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 117R-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IdoA is also required for self-interaction of DS chains, and the self-interactions of decorin side chains are believed to be important in collagen fibrillogenesis (5Ruhland C. Schonherr E. Robenek H.

Chem. 1982; 257: 6333-6338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This can be explained by the fact that IdoA increases the glycosaminoglycan chains conformational flexibility, which facilitates interactions (7Ferro D.R. Provasoli A. Ragazzi M. Casu B. Torri G.

Epimerization of GlcA into IdoA in dermatan sulfate is catalyzed by the DS-epimerase, which we recently purified and cloned (8Maccarana M. Olander B. Malmstrom J. Tiedemann K. Aebersold R. Lindahl U.

Based on sequence similarity with the DS-epimerase, a second epimerase has also been identified, and its activity has been established. 4B. Pacheco, A. Malmström, and M. Maccarana, manuscript in preparation. Here, the two enzymes are referred to as DS-epimerase 1 (encoded by the DSE gene) and DS-epimerase 2 (encoded by the DSEL gene), respectively. The polymer level stereochemical inversion of the C5 carboxyl group of GlcA from an equatorial to an axial position, thereby forming the epimer IdoA, is a chemically challenging reaction. First, it requires the abstraction of the C5 proton, which has a very high pKa, and the subsequent reprotonation has to take place from the opposite side of the sugar plane. The mechanism of epimerization has not been extensively studied but has been suggested to consist of a two-base reaction mechanism where the initial destabilization of the C5 proton is achieved by coordination of the C5 carboxylate to a divalent cation (9Hannesson H.H. Hagner-McWhirter A. Tiedemann K. Lindahl U. Malmstrom A. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to characterize the active site of DS-epimerase 1 to elucidate the molecular mechanism of epimerization. Despite the similar catalytic activities of the DS-epimerases, HS-epimerase, and alginate epimerases, they are highly diverged at the primary sequence level. We therefore could not rely on sequence-based alignments of these enzymes to identify key catalytic residues through conservation. Instead, by employing a structural homology-based modeling approach, we identified several bacterial lyases as significant structural homologues of DS-epimerase 1. Based on the modeled enzyme and site-directed mutagenesis, we propose a mechanism of epimerization involving two histidines (His-205 and His-450) and one tyrosine (Tyr-261) as putative catalytic amino acids with the formation of a 4,5-unsaturated hexuronic acid intermediate. Materials—293HEK was from ATCC, and cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. 5-3H-Labeled defructosylated K4 capsular polysaccharide (dK4) was prepared as previously described from a K4-producing Escherichia coli strain (9Hannesson H.H.

If regions remained unassigned, they were parsed into domains using PFAM and then using the block structure from a multiple sequence alignment generated with PSI-BLAST against the NCBI nonredundant data base (10Chivian D.

Domains detected using PSI-BLAST and FFAS against the Protein Data Bank were annotated with the homolog of known structure, and that structure was used in subsequent homology modeling. The alignment between the query sequence and the structure was optimized using FFAS03 before the homology models were generated using Rosetta (17Misura K.M.S. Chivian D. Rohl C.A. Kim D.E. Baker D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2006; 103: 5361-5366Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Several hundred models were created and visually inspected, and the alignment was manually adjusted using 2DDB to accommodate differences in loop lengths (18Malmstrom L. Marko-Varga G.

To create the C-terminal tagged expression construct for DS-epi1, pDONR221-DS-epi1 was subsequently recombined with a modified pcDNA3/CTAP vector containing a Gateway cloning cassette using an LR recombination kit (Invitrogen). Mutations were generated with the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), using the primers indicated in Table S2. All constructs were sequenced (MWG Biotech). DS-epimerase 1 Expression and Purification—Expression of wild-type and mutated versions of DS-Epi1 was carried out in 293HEK cells. Confluent 25-cm2 flasks were transfected with 8 μg of expression plasmid using 20 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 48 h of incubation, cells were lysed in 400 μl of TAP lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0,1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin)). Protein concentrations were estimated with a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. To purify recombinant proteins, 500 μg of cell lysate was bound to 10 μl of IgG-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 4 h at 4 °C, end over end. After binding, beads were washed once with 20 volumes of TAP lysis buffer and twice with 20 volumes of desalting buffer (20 mm MES (pH 5.5 at 37 °C), 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors). The IgG gel was then resuspended in 200 μl of desalting buffer, of which 80 μl were used for determination of epimerase activity (see below). Wild-type and mutant protein expression was detected by Western blot, using 1 μg/ml of an affinity-purified anti-DS-epimerase 1 rabbit polyclonal antibody obtained by immunizing rabbits with the peptide KWSKYKHDLAAS (Innovagen). Tunicamycin Treatment—293HEK cells were transfected as above with pcDNA3-DS-epi1/CTAP and grown for 48 h before the addition of 1 μg/ml tunicamycin. The cells were subsequently grown for an additional 24 h prior to lysis as above. Determination of DS-epimerase Activity—Epimerase activity was measured as previously described (8Maccarana M.

Briefly, cells were lysed in TAP lysis and desalted (in Fig. 6) or purified as above (in Fig. 4) before assaying. Assays were performed in a total reaction volume of 100 μl of 0.8× desalting buffer, 0.5 mg of bovine serum albumin, 2 mm MnCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 30,000 dpm [5-3H]dK4 (∼20 μm HexA) and incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. The supernatant was subsequently distilled, and tritium release was quantified with liquid scintillation counting. Alternatively, when specified, assays using 25 μg of dermatan were performed in the same buffer composition as above in the presence of 25 mCi of tritiated water. The assay product was subsequently purified as previously described, and the incorporated tritium was quantified (9Hannesson H.H. Hagner-McWhirter A. Tiedemann K. Lindahl U. Malmstrom A. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For kinetic assays, reactions were performed as above, varying the substrate concentration from 4 to 155 μm. A time course of the reaction showed linearity up to 4 h. Kinetic parameters were calculated from the obtained initial rates of product formation (4-h assay) using a nonlinear fitting regression analysis (Hyperbolic Regression Analysis Method, available on the World Wide Web).FIGURE 4Analysis of DS-epimerase 1 mutants.

Despite low sequence similarity, the N-terminal domain showed significant structural homology to several PL5 and PL8 family lyases, such as heparinase II, hyaluronan lyase, alginate lyase, and chondroitinase ACI (19Lunin V.V. Li Y. Linhardt R.J. Miyazono H. Kyogashima M. Kaneko T. Bell A.W. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 367-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 20Shaya D. Tocilj A. Li Y. Myette J.

Mikami B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The prediction was validated by submission of the primary sequence of DS-epimerase 1 to the Structure Prediction Metaserver (Table S1) (22Ginalski K. Elofsson A. Fischer D. Rychlewski L. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1015-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). The central domain showed a significant homology only with heparinase II. The N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–390) is predicted to be an α-helical domain (SCOP superfamily, a.102.2) containing 13 α-helices shaped as an incomplete (α/α)6 toroid. The central domain (amino acids 391–690) is a β-sheet domain, where the β-strands form a two-layered stack (predicted SCOP superfamily, b.30.5). No homolog of known structure could be detected for the C-terminal domain (amino acids 691–958), and we therefore attempted to predict the SCOP superfamily using a Rosetta de novo method, but the results were inconclusive (23Malmstrom L. Riffle M. Strauss C.E.M. Chivian D. Davis T.N. Bonneau R. Baker D. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e76Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Secondary structure predictions showed that this domain contained mostly α-helices (Fig. 1A). Since our initial prediction only generated models of the individual domains, the crystal structure of heparinase II (2FUT) was subsequently used as a template to build a full-length tertiary structure model of the N-terminal and central domain of DS-epimerase 1 (Fig. 1B). The N-terminal and central domain together form a groove where the walls are built up by α-helices 2–7 in the N-terminal domain, whereas several loops in the central domain form the second wall. Differences between heparinase II and DS-epimerase 1 could be identified in this region, where in the latter several loops are considerably longer. The bottom of the groove is formed by a loop connecting α-helices 8 and 9 together with α-helix 11 and a loop connecting α-helices 12 and 13. The structural homology to PL5 and PL8 family lyases strongly suggests that DS-epimerase 1 has evolved from these bacterial enzymes. In addition, the lyase and the polymer level epimerase reaction have been proposed to proceed in a similar manner (24Gacesa P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 199-202Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Identification of the Active Site in DS-epimerase 1—In an effort to identify the active site of DS-epimerase 1 we turned to similarities with heparinase II. In the latter, the active site is located in the groove formed by the N-terminal α-helical domain together with the central domain, as seen in DS-epimerase 1 (Fig. 1B) (20Shaya D. Tocilj A. Li Y. Myette J. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. Cygler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15525-15535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The active site of heparinase II has been suggested to consist of a histidine (His-406) or a tyrosine (Tyr-257), functioning as the general base abstracting the C5 proton from GlcA. In the second step, a tyrosine (Tyr-257) is believed to function as a general acid by donating a proton to the 4-O-glycosidic bond, resulting in cleavage of the linkage. As mentioned above, DS-epimerase 1 and heparinase II are highly diverged at the primary sequence level. However, a structure-based sequence alignment shows conservation of His-450 and Tyr-261 corresponding to the residues implied in the catalytic activity of heparinase II (Fig. 2). These residues are also conserved in DS-epimerase 2 (data not shown). Superposition of the predicted DS-epimerase 1 structure and heparinase II crystal structure (2FUT) shows that these residues are spatially conserved and well oriented in regard to the C5 proton and the glycosidic oxygen of a modeled chondroitin sulfate tetrasaccharide substrate, respectively (Fig. 3A). Based on this structural conservation, it is therefore likely that these residues also play a role in the first steps of epimerization of GlcA.FIGURE 3Comparison of the active sites of DS-epimerase 1, heparinase II, and chondroitinase ACI.

In addition, this general acid must be different from the general base abstracting the C5 proton. Based on these prerequisites, we searched for potential general acids in our modeled structure. A closer inspection of the proposed active site showed the presence of two histidines (His-203 and His-205) located at the top of α-helix 8 opposite to His-450. His-203 is pointing away from the bound substrate, whereas the position of His-205, which is pointing toward the C5 position of GlcA, fulfills the criteria of a general acid, located in such a way that it respects the axial-equatorial requirements for proton abstraction and readdition (Fig. 3A). In the reverse reaction, His-205 would instead function as a general base and His-450 as a general acid. This view is strengthened by the conservation of His-205 in heparinase II (His-202), which has the ability to cleave both GlcA and IdoA linkages (Fig. 3, A and B). A similar composite active site has also recently been suggested for chondroitinase ABC (25Shaya D. Hahn B.-S. Bjerkan T.M. Kim W.S. Park N.Y. Sim J.-S. Kim Y.-S. Cygler M. Glycobiology. 2008; 18: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Interestingly, chondroitinase ACI, which can only cleave GlcA linkages, lacks the corresponding histidine (Fig. 3C). Mutational Analysis of DS-epimerase 1—Candidate amino acids were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in 293HEK cells. C-terminally tagged recombinant enzymes were subsequently purified by binding to IgG-Sepharose and assayed for epimerase activity, measured as the release of tritium from 5-3H-labeled dK4 or as the incorporation of tritium derived from tritiated water into desulfated dermatan sulfate (dermatan). Incubation of 5-3H-labeled dK4 with a purified wild-type version of DS-epimerase 1 resulted in substantial release of tritium (1200 dpm) from the substrate, whereas no tritium release was noted from mock lysates (Fig. 4A). Subsequently, we analyzed the effect of replacing His-450 with an alanine or asparagine. These mutants did not show any release of tritiated water from [5-3H]dK4, indicating that the C5 proton could not be abstracted (Fig. 4A). To address whether this residue is functioning as a general acid in the conversion of IdoA to GlcA, the incorporation of tritium from tritiated water into dermatan was measured. The H450A mutant did not show any incorporation of tritium into the substrate, whereas the purified wild-type protein incorporated 4200 dpm. These results are in agreement with structural findings suggesting a function of His-450 as the general base (proton abstractor) in the conversion of GlcA to IdoA and as a general acid (proton donor) in the reverse reaction (Fig. 5). It has previously been suggested that proton abstraction from GlcA is performed by a polyprotic base, such as a lysine (9Hannesson H.H. Hagner-McWhirter A. Tiedemann K. Lindahl U. Malmstrom A. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, we could not find any lysines present in the active site in our model of DS-epimerase 1. Our structural data and the fact that the H450A/N mutants are inactive show that H450 is indeed the general base. We then continued to investigate the role of His-203 and His-205 in catalytic activity. Mutation of His-205 into alanine or asparagine resulted in a complete loss of activity toward chondroitin, suggesting a role as a general acid (Fig. 4A). On the contrary, the H203A and H203N mutants still retained around 9.6 and 5.2% of the activity compared with the wild-type enzyme, indicating that His-203 is not directly involved in the catalytic mechanism. His-203 might instead be involved in positioning of the substrate within the active site (Fig. 4). The fact that no tritium release was observed from [5-3H]dK4 incubated with the H205A/N mutants and no tritiated water-derived tritium was incorporated into dermatan with the H450A mutant shows that after proton abstraction, there is no immediate exchange of the abstracted proton with the solvent. Interestingly, the absence of tritium release from [5-3H]dK4 incubated with the H205A/N mutants indicates that after proton abstraction by His-450, the intermediate can be reprotonated by the same residue. Tyr-257 is thought to be essential for heparinase II to cleave the sugar chain and is also found in a structurally equivalent position in DS-epimerase 1 (Tyr-261) (Fig. 3). This residue was therefore mutated into alanine, and the mutant was indeed shown to be inactive using both dermatan (data not shown) and chondroitin as substrates (Fig. 4A). Similar results were also obtained replacing the tyrosine with a phenylalanine. This is intriguing and suggests that during epimerization, a cleaved 4,5-unsaturated hexuronic intermediate is formed (Fig. 5). This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that a 4,5-unsaturated intermediate has been shown to exist in the C5 mannuronan epimerase reaction, which also takes place at the polymer level (26Jerga A. Stanley M.D. Tipton P.A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 9138-9144Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). How the glycosidic linkage is subsequently reformed in an epimerase compared with a lyase remains an open question. It is possible that the tyrosinate ion formed after cleavage is also involved in the reformation of the glycosidic linkage before reprotonation of the C5 carbon (Fig. 5). Whether this is a general mechanism for epimerases acting at the polymer level remains to be elucidated, since no structure is currently available for the heparan sulfate epimerase. A homology search using the sequence of the HS epimerase did not show any significant structural hits, suggesting that it has a currently unknown fold. This line of evidence strengthens the view that the DS-epimerases and the HS-epimerase are not evolutionarily related but does not exclude a similar reaction mechanism. To rule out the possibility that mutation of the above residues caused any major misfolding, expression levels of the wild-type and mutant enzymes were evaluated with Western blot. When transiently overexpressed in 293HEK cells, the mutant constructs showed similar expression levels as the wild-type enzyme after purification on an IgG-Sepharose (Fig. 4B). A charged amino acid (Lys-331) located in α-helix 12 outside of the active site and Tyr-256 located in the same loop as the catalytic residue Tyr-261 were also mutated into alanine to serve as general controls of mutation. These two mutants showed activity similar to that of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 4A). Together, these data indicate that the mutations performed do not induce any major misfolding of the protein that could explain the loss of activity. N-Glycosylation Is Required for DS-epimerase 1 Activity— Several enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of dermatan sulfate have been shown to be dependent on N-glycosylation for proper function (27Yusa A. Kitajima K. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20393-20403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 28Yusa A. Kitajima K. Habuchi O. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the importance of N-glycosylation for enzymatic activity of DS-epimerase 1. The enzyme has four predicted N-glycosylation sites (Fig. 1), as determined by the NetNGlyc program (available on the World Wide Web) and no predicted O-glycosylation sites. To experimentally determine if DS-epimerase 1 is N-glycosylated, cells overexpressing the enzyme were treated with tunicamycin. After a 24-h incubation with 1 μg/ml tunicamycin, a second band with a shift in molecular mass of ∼8 kDa could be detected (Fig. 6A). To determine if N-glycosylation is required for enzyme activity, lysates from control and tunicamycin-treated cells were compared for their ability to convert GlcA into IdoA. After tunicamycin treatment, epimerase activity was reduced by 70% compared with the control (Fig. 6B). Similar results were also obtained by purifying DS-epi1 after tunicamycin treatment (data not shown). This reduction in activity cannot simply be explained by an impaired production of the protein in the absence of N-glycosylation, since tunicamycin-treated cells showed an expression of DS-epimerase 1 equal to that of control cells (Fig. 6A). To investigate if the glycosylation status could influence detection of DS-epi1 by Western blot and hamper the interpretation of expression levels in the experiment above, lysates were treated with peptide N-glycosidase F. No difference in band intensity could be detected after digestion (data not shown). The residual activity observed is probably due to the fully glycosylated enzyme that can still be found after tunicamycin treatment (Fig. 6A). In agreement with the essential role of N-glycosylation, the full-size protein expressed in a bacterial system was inactive (data not shown). DS-epimerase 1 Carries Four N-Glycosylation Chains—To address which predicted sites are carrying N-glycans, mutants were constructed for each site by replacing the asparagine residues with serine. The mutants were subsequently expressed in 293HEK cells and analyzed with Western blot. All four mutants showed a shift of about 2 kDa, indicating that the four predicted sites are all occupied (Fig. 6C). The mutants were expressed at the same level, indicating that no single N-glycosylation site is necessary for expression of the enzyme. This is in agreement with the tunicamycin data above. We then investigated the role of each N-glycosylation site in enzyme activity. N183S and N642S mutants had a 3.6- and 1.5-fold reduction in Vmax values compared with that of the wild-type protein, respectively (Table 1). The N336S and N648S mutants had a strong reduction in catalytic activity (13- and 43-fold) with minor but discernable release of tritium from the substrate (Table 1). The almost complete loss of activity observed for the N336S and N648S mutants is hard to reconcile with a mechanism where the N-glycosylation chains are somehow involved in substrate binding due to their location far away from the active site (Fig. 1B). A more feasible explanation would be that the lack of large N-glycosylation chains in these regions induces local changes in structure that result in reduction of enzyme activity. This view is strengthened by kinetic analysis of the various mutants. The major effect was seen in Vmax and not Km values, indicating an aberrant enzyme function rather than impaired substrate binding (Table 1).TABLE 1Kinetic analysis of DS-epi1 N-glycosylation mutantsVmaxKmfmol s–1μmDS-epi1/His29 ± 1.324 ± 2N183S8.0 ± 0.5716 ± 2.4N336S2.3 ± 0.07314 ± 0.99N642S19 ± 1.116 ± 2.0N648S0.67 ± 0.0944.9 ± 2.6 Open table in a new tab In summary, this study provides the first structural investigation of a glycosaminoglycan epimerase and the molecular mechanism behind epimerization of chondroitin. We conclude, through structure-based bioinformatics, that the DS-epimerases have evolved from bacterial lyases. The active site of DS-epimerase 1 is located in a groove formed by two distinct domains of the enzyme. Based on site-directed mutagenesis and structural conservation, we propose a mechanism of epimerization where His-450 functions as the initial general base abstracting the C5 proton from GlcA. The subsequent cleavage of the glycosidic linkage by Tyr-261 generates a 4,5-unsaturated intermediate, which is protonated from the opposite side of the sugar plane by His-205 with a concomitant recreation of the glycosidic linkage by either the tyrosinate ion generated after cleavage or a second general acid, which was not identified in this study (Fig. 5). In addition, we show that proper N-glycosylation is necessary for the production of an active DS-epimerase 1."
https://openalex.org/W2083014861,"We have previously shown that Fhit tumor suppressor protein interacts with Hsp60 chaperone machinery and ferredoxin reductase (Fdxr) protein. Fhit-effector interactions are associated with a Fhit-dependent increase in Fdxr stability, followed by generation of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis induction under conditions of oxidative stress. To define Fhit structural features that affect interactions, downstream signaling, and biological outcomes, we used cancer cells expressing Fhit mutants with amino acid substitutions that alter enzymatic activity, enzyme substrate binding, or phosphorylation at tyrosine 114. Gastric cancer cell clones stably expressing mutants that do not bind substrate or cannot be phosphorylated showed decreased binding to Hsp60 and Fdxr and reduced mitochondrial localization. Expression of Fhit or mutants that bind interactor proteins results in oxidative damage and accumulation of cells in G(2)/M or sub-G(1) fractions after peroxide treatment; noninteracting mutants are defective in these biological effects. Gastric cancer clones expressing noncomplexing Fhit mutants show reduction of Fhit tumor suppressor activity, confirming that substrate binding, interaction with heat shock proteins, mitochondrial localization, and interaction with Fdxr are important for Fhit tumor suppressor function."

With the advent of large scale genome sequencing efforts along with more sophisticated methods of genetic mapping, a number of loci have been identified that are associated with human disease. Intriguingly, many genes identified in these loci remain uncharacterized at the biochemical and functional level, and although current annotation can provide a general prediction of the function of some proteins, understanding finer aspects of their regulation require individual analysis at a single gene level. Chromosome 11p13-14 has been extensively studied because of its association with various tumors, among them lung and bladder cancers (1Shipman R. Schraml P. Colombi M. Raefle G. Ludwig C.U. Hum.

The 239FB gene is present between the FSHB and PAX6 genes, and earlier studies have shown that the chromosomal locus of 239FB gene is present within a deletion interval that had been associated with the mental retardation phenotype of WAGR syndrome (19Schwartz F. Eisenman R. Knoll J. Gessler M. Bruns G. Genomics. 1995; 29: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). 239FB mRNA is predominantly expressed in the fetal brain (20Schwartz F. Neve R. Eisenman R. Gessler M. Bruns G. Hum. Genet. 1994; 94: 658-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and the high degree of similarity between the predicted protein sequence of 239FB and two Caenorhabditis elegans cDNA clones showed an extensive evolutionary conservation of this protein (21Schwartz F. Ota T. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 194: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Although the function of the 239FB protein remains unknown, the distinctive expression of the gene in the fetal brain and the presence of an “ancient conserved region” (21Schwartz F. Ota T. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 194: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) in this gene suggest its role in the development of the nervous system. In current databases (Genecards), the 239FB gene has been annotated as a metallophosphoesterase (MPE), 4The abbreviations used are: MPE, metallophosphoesterase; CthPnkp, C. thermocellum polynucleotide kinase-phosphatase; DLS, dynamic light scattering; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PDE, phosphodiesterase.4The abbreviations used are: MPE, metallophosphoesterase; CthPnkp, C. thermocellum polynucleotide kinase-phosphatase; DLS, dynamic light scattering; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PDE, phosphodiesterase. and a close ortholog of this protein, called 239AB, is expressed in the adult brain (21Schwartz F.

Metallophosphoesterases are a large group of enzymes that catalyze a variety of diverse reactions. All members contain five blocks of residues and within these blocks are found 11 invariant residues, DXnGDXnGNH(E/D)XnHXnGHXH, and the structural motif conserved in metallophosphoesterases is the β-α-β-α-β-fold (22Hopfner K.P.

The superfamily of metallophosphoesterases is made up of two functionally and structurally well characterized groups, phosphomonoesterases and phosphodiesterases. Whereas phosphomonoesterases have been divided into protein Ser/Thr phosphatases, purple acid phosphatases, and 5′-nucleotidases, diesterases are categorized into phospholipases, 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, UDP 2′,3′-diacylglucosaminase, and Class III phosphodiesterases (25Ek-Rylander B.

The amino acid residues involved in coordinating the dimetal center are located at the carboxyl end of the parallel β-strands of the fold (23Miller D.J. Shuvalova L. Evdokimova E. Savchenko A.

Structural and biochemical analysis of these proteins have shown the metal requirements (Fe2+, Fe3+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Co2+, Ni2+) at the dimetal nuclear center for activity (27Cohen P. Annu. Rev.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6276-6282Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Despite the large number of MPEs that have been biochemically characterized, the function of these proteins in the organism remains enigmatic, and no natural substrate has been identified for many of them (23Miller D.J.

Moreover, it is not readily possible to classify the MPEs as either monoesterases or diesterases by inspection of the sequences of the proteins. Recently, we have biochemically and structurally characterized the Rv0805 gene from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which to date is the only identifiable cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase in M. tuberculosis (24Shenoy A.R.

Visweswariah S.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15695-15704Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The Rv0805 protein is a Class III cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, which are enzymes found almost exclusively in bacteria. The catalytic core of Rv0805 is distantly related to the calcineurin-like phosphatases, and a unique substrate binding pocket was identified by computational docking (24Shenoy A.R. Capuder M. Draskovic P. Lamba D. Visweswariah S.S. Podobnik M. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 211-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). During our attempts to identify orthologs of this gene in different organisms, we were surprised to see that a number of genes similar to Rv0805 protein could be identified in eukaryotes and among them were the 239FB and 239AB genes. In the present study we have cloned the full-length cDNAs of the 239FB and 239AB genes from rat brain, and using extensive biochemical and mutational analysis, we have shown that these proteins are indeed metallophosphoesterases. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) seen in the FB gene inactivates the protein, and because the 239AB protein can hydrolyze 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesters, this is the first report of a functional Class III PDE in eukaryotes. All nucleotides as well as the colorimetric substrates p-nitrophenyl phosphate, bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate, p-nitrophenyl thymidine 5′-monophosphate, p-nitrophenyl phenylphosphonate, and p-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Malachite green reagent was purchased from MP Biomedicals. Bioinformatic Analysis for Identification of ICC/CpdA-like Proteins—The metallophosphoesterase superfamily encompasses a large number of protein sub-families that have in common a core seven-residue bimetal binding active site that catalyzes the hydrolysis of various phospho-, mono-, and diester substrates. The Pfam data base of protein families groups all these proteins by a single hidden Markov model (PF00149) built on 332 seed sequences. A cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase from Escherichia coli (product of the ICC/CpdA gene) is a metallophosphoesterase, and the Rv0805 is similar to this protein (33Shenoy A.R. Sreenath N. Podobnik M. Kovacevic M. Visweswariah S.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15695-15704Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As we aimed to identify ICC-related sequences, we relied on the established subclassifications of highly related proteins in the Clusters of Orthologous Groups data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG). Eight proteins of 332 Pfam seed sequences matched to Cog2129 (ICC-related) using RPS-BLAST. These sequences were aligned using PROBCONS and the alignment used to generate a new hidden Markov model that would identify only ICC-related phosphodiesterases and prevent all other metallophosphoesterases from being enlisted in the desired inventory of ICC-like proteins. A HMMER (34Eddy S.R. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (3958) Google Scholar) search of the non-redundant data base of proteins revealed the presence of ∼130 eukaryotic ICC-like proteins (supplemental Fig. 1 and Table I) among a total of 505 hits and identified two human proteins, 239AB and 239FB. Expression and Purification of 239FB—RNA was isolated from fetal (20 days of gestation) and adult rat brain using TRI reagent (Sigma) as per the manufacturer's protocol and subjected to first strand cDNA synthesis using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). The rat 239FB full-length coding region was amplified using 239FBfwdMun1 and 239FBrvs primers on the fetal brain cDNA (supplemental Table II). PCR was performed with DeepVent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), and the purified PCR product was digested with MunI and XhoI and cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pBKS II vector (Invitrogen). The sequence of the cloned fragment was identical to accession number NM_198778. For expression of the protein, a clone was generated using a forward primer containing an Nco1 site and cloned as an NcoI-XhoI fragment into pPROExHT-C to generate plasmid pPRO-239FB1-294. This allowed expression in E. coli of the 239FB protein with a hexahistidine tag. The D65A, H67A, H67R, D86A, E89A, N117A, H118A, H213A, G252H, H254A mutations were generated on the pPRO-239FB1-294 plasmid using a single oligonucleotide-based mutagenesis protocol (35Shenoy A.R. Visweswariah S.S. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 319: 335-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The sequences of the oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis are provided in supplemental Table II, and all inserts were sequenced to confirm the presence of only the desired mutations (Macrogen). Proteins were expressed in the E. coli BL21DE3 strain on induction using isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (500 μm) for 20 h at 16 °C. Cells were lysed by sonication in buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.2), 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm benzamidine, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride followed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g. The supernatant was interacted with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen), and the matrix was washed with a similar buffer. This was followed by washes with a buffer containing 100 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.2), 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole, and elution in the buffer containing 100 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.2), 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm NaCl, and 300 mm imidazole. Purified protein was desalted into buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.2), 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol and stored in aliquots at -70 °C until further use. For expression of 239FB fused to an N-terminal GST tag, a BamHI-XhoI fragment from the pBKS II-239FB plasmid was cloned in to the BamHI and XhoI sites of pGEX-6P3 (GE Healthcare) to generate plasmid, pGEX-6P3-239FB. Gel Filtration and Dynamic Light Scattering—Gel filtration was carried out in buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol at pH 8.8 and 4 °C at a flow rate of 200 μl/min using a Superose 12 column and an AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system (GE Healthcare). The column was calibrated using commercially available gel filtration standards containing thyroglobulin (670 kDa), bovine γ-globulin (158 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (44 kDa), equine myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1.35 kDa). Protein estimation of peaks containing 239FB protein was performed by the modified Bradford method (36Zor T. Selinger Z. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Dynamic Light Scattering experiments were performed on a DynaPro Molecular Sizing Instrument (Protein Solutions). DLS measures fluctuations in the intensity of light scattered by a macromolecular solution which can be related to its hydrodynamic radius (Rh). Samples of 239FB protein were analyzed directly after gel filtration at concentrations of ∼400 μg/ml. Protein solutions were centrifuged three times at 16,000 × g for 15 min and immediately loaded into a quartz cuvette before measurement. Several measurements were taken at 277 K and analyzed using DYNAMICS Version 3.30 software (Protein Solutions). Data collection times of 10 s were used in all cases, for a minimum of 15 acquisitions. Western Blot Analysis of 239FB—Purified 239FB protein was injected into rabbits to raise an antibody to the protein by standard procedures as described earlier (33Shenoy A.R. Sreenath N. Podobnik M. Kovacevic M. Visweswariah S.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15695-15704Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Rat fetal brain tissues were homogenized in homogenization buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 80 μm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, after which samples were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 1 h at 4 °C. Aliquots were stored at -70 °C. Total brain proteins (25 μg) were fractionated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Western blotting was carried out using the immunoglobulin fraction (3 μg/ml) prepared from the immune serum as described earlier (33Shenoy A.R. Sreenath N. Podobnik M. Kovacevic M. Visweswariah S.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15695-15704Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Blots were subsequently probed with Hsp70 antibody (Stressgen; 200 ng/ml) to normalize protein levels in the individual lanes. Metallophosphoesterase Enzymatic Assays—Assays for various activities (phosphatase, phosphodiesterase, nuclease, phospholipase) were performed in a triple buffer system (MES, HEPES, diethanolamine, 50 mm (pH 9.0) (37Newman J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 610-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm NaCl in the presence of 10 mm concentrations of the specified substrate and Mn2+ as the metal cofactor. The triple buffer system allowed a change in a wide range of pH without altering the ionic composition of the buffer. Assays were stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 200 mm NaOH, and absorbance was monitored at 405 nm. The amount of p-nitrophenol formed was estimated based on its molar extinction coefficient of 18,450 m-1 cm-1. For kinetic analysis assays were performed with the same buffer system as described earlier with 239FB protein and different concentrations of substrates and metals (Ni2+ and Mn2+) as indicated. Each measurement was performed in triplicate for two different enzyme preparations. Hydrolysis of single-stranded M13 DNA or double-stranded pUC19 DNA or RNA (yeast RNA type II) was assayed in 20 μl of reaction volume in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm MnCl2 at 37 °C for 120 min in the presence of 1 μg of 239FB. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 6× loading dye, and the reaction products were analyzed on 0.8% agarose, 1× Tris acetate, EDTA gels containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterase Assays—Hydrolysis of cyclic mononucleotides (2′,3′-cAMP, 3′,5′-cAMP, and 3′,5′-cGMP) was analyzed in reaction mixtures in the three buffer system (50 mm MES, HEPES, diethanolamine (pH 9.0)), 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MnCl2 with different concentrations of the specified substrate in the presence of 1 μg of 239FB and 0.1 unit of calf intestine phosphatase. The reaction was stopped after 90 min of incubation at 37 °C by the addition of 50 μl of a malachite green solution, prepared as described previously (38Harder K.W. Owen P. Wong L.K. Aebersold R. Clark-Lewis I. Jirik F.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 39Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Absorbance was measured at 620 nm to detect the released inorganic phosphate, and the amount of released phosphate was estimated by interpolating the value to a standard curve generated with inorganic phosphate. For analysis of the cyclic nucleotide PDE assay by HPLC, 1 μg of 239FB was incubated for 120 min with 10 mm of the specified substrate as well as metal cofactor in the buffer system mentioned above in a volume of 25 μl. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 20 mm (NH4)H2PO4 (pH 6.2). Aliquots from assays were applied to a Supelcosil LC-8DB (25 cm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) HPLC column equilibrated with 20 mm (NH4)H2PO4 (pH 6.2) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min on an Agilent Technologies HPLC system. The column was calibrated with a mixture of nucleotides containing 2′,3′-cAMP, 3′,5′-cAMP, 3′-AMP, 5′-AMP, and 2′-AMP. Cloning and Expression of Rat 239AB—The full-length coding region of rat 239AB was amplified using 239ABfwd and 239ABrvs primers and Deep Vent polymerase (supplemental Table II) from cDNA prepared from the adult rat brain. Single 3′-A overhangs were added to the PCR product using TaqDNA polymerase and then ligated in to pGEMT Easy vector (Promega). The clone was sequenced and subcloned as a BamHI and NotI fragment into the BamHI and NotI sites of pGEX-5X2 (GE Healthcare) to generate plasmid pGEX-5X2-239AB, encoding 239AB fused to an N-terminal GST tag. GST-FB and GST-AB proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21DE3 strain after induction with isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (500 μm) for 20 h at 16 °C. Cells were lysed by sonication in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.2), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm benzamidine, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride followed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g. The supernatant was interacted with GSH beads, and the matrix was washed with a similar buffer. This was followed by washes with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.2), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton-X. Subsequently, beads were washed with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.2), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol, and stored at 4 °C. Protein was estimated by addition of Bradford reagent to the beads suspension. Identification of 239FB as an Ortholog of the Rv0805 Gene—During our earlier studies on cyclic nucleotide metabolism in bacteria, we identified and characterized both structurally and biochemically the Rv0805 3′,5′-cAMP PDE from M. tuberculosis (24Shenoy A.R. Capuder M. Draskovic P. Lamba D. Visweswariah S.S. Podobnik M. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 211-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 33Shenoy A.R. Sreenath N. Podobnik M. Kovacevic M. Visweswariah S.S. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15695-15704Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This protein hydrolyzed cAMP in vitro and in vivo and, therefore, may contribute to cAMP homeostatis in mycobacteria. Given the unique features of Rv0805 and the availability of structural information, we sought to identify similar proteins in other genomes. The MPE family encompasses several subfamilies of homologous proteins grouped based on their substrate specificities. Here we have narrowed down our searches to identify as many members possible of the subfamily that could hydrolyze 3′,5′-cAMP and -cGMP. Using a combined RPS-BLAST and hidden Markov model approach, we found that although not all genomes contain Rv0805-like proteins, these genes nonetheless seem to have a wide phyletic distribution. The majority of proteins identified were of bacterial or archaebacterial in origin (supplemental Table I). This was expected because eukaryotic cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases belong to a phylogenetically unrelated group of proteins, the class I PDEs (40Conti M. Beavo J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 481-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). However, we were intrigued to find some orthologs in eukaryotes, including mammals (Fig. 1; supplemental Table I and Fig. 1). Of the 505 genes identified, 287 were found in bacteria, 82 in archaebacteria, 135 in eukaryotes, and a single gene in a virus. The majority of sequence diversity in the MPE domain was found in archaebacteria followed by proteobacteria and actinobacteria, among the eubacterial lineages. We, therefore, selected the most diverse members among the bacterial genes to construct a representative phylogenetic tree retaining Rv0805 and a few other eukaryotic sequences to highlight their relative placement and bring out the diversification within several bacterial and archaeal clades. We were surprised to notice the close relation between Rv0805 and the mammalian proteins (Fig. 1), and the availability of biochemical and structural information on Rv0805 prompte"
https://openalex.org/W1964288132,"Background Individuals with lower socioeconomic status experience higher rates of mortality and are more likely to suffer from numerous diseases. While some studies indicate that humans who suffer from social inequality suffer generally worse health, to our knowledge no controlled experiments of this nature have been done in any species. Lipofuscin is a highly oxidized cross-linked aggregate consisting of oxidized protein and lipid clusters. This eminent terminal oxidation outcome accumulates within cells during aging process. Methodology/Principal Findings Thirty two rabbits were assigned into four groups randomly of eight each. The first group encountered food deprivation for eight weeks and was kept in an isolated situation. The second group was food deprived for eight weeks but encountered to other groups continuously. The third group suffered two weeks of deprivation and then received free access to food. The fourth group had free access to diet without any deprivation. All hearts were removed for histopathological evaluation. Cross-sections of hearts were examined by light microscopy for the presence of yellow-brown Lpofuscin pigment granules. Here we show that relative food deprivation can cause accumulation of Lipofuscin pigmentation. We find that cardiac Lipofuscin deposition increases the most in the inequitable condition in which food deprived individuals observe well-fed individuals. Conclusions/Significance Our findings demonstrate that a sense of inequality in food intake can promote aging more than food deprivation alone. These findings should be considered as a basis for further studies on the physiological mechanisms by which inequality negatively impacts health and well-being."
https://openalex.org/W1982474742,"We observed previously that combined small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting CrkII and CrkL, known activators of guanine nucleotide exchange factor DOCK1, strongly inhibit Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cell spreading and migration on collagen IV. DOCK1 siRNA reduced its expression >95% in Caco-2 cells but inhibited spreading much less than combined CrkII/CrkL siRNAs, suggesting that CrkII/CrkL interact with additional DOCK proteins. siRNA targeting DOCK5, a closely related DOCK1 family member, inhibited Caco-2 spreading similarly to DOCK1 siRNA, and the combined siRNAs synergistically inhibited spreading.

The downstream effectors of CrkII and CrkL in this system, however, have not been identified. In this paper, we examine the role of DOCK1 and DOCK5 in regulation of Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cell spreading and migration on collagen IV using siRNAs that target these proteins and confirm these results in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Additionally, we report the cloning and expression of the complete human DOCK5 cDNA, examine its association with CrkII and CrkL through coimmunoprecipitation studies using mutant forms of these proteins, and characterize the function of the expressed DOCK5 protein in cell spreading assays. We also characterize the intracellular localization of DOCK5 in Caco-2 cells by expression of green fluorescent protein-tagged DOCK5. Materials—Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, Oligofectamine, Lipofectamine, and Plus Reagent and the β-galactosidase detection kit were obtained from Invitrogen. Collagen IV was obtained from Sigma. CrkII monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. CrkL polyclonal antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal antibodies to α-tubulin and HA tag (12CA5) were obtained from Calbiochem and Roche Applied Science, respectively. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) polyclonal antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Protein A/G-agarose was obtained either from Santa Cruz Biotechnology or EMD Biosciences (Gibbstown, NJ). siRNAs to human DOCK1, DOCK5, CrkII, and CrkL and control nontargeting siRNA 1 (NT1 control siRNA) were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). siRNA sequences were selected using Dharmacon Smartdesign and corresponded to the following sequences: DOCK1, GTACCGAGGTTACACGTTA; DOCK5, AGATTTACCTTCCGACAC (DOCK5-1), ATCCATTGCTATAGAAGAA (DOCK5-2), and TGATCCACGGTGAGTTTGA (DOCK5-3); CrkII, ACACTATTTGGACACTACA; CrkL, GTCACAAGGATGAATATAA.

Aequorea coerulescens green fluorescent protein (AcGFP) vector and monoclonal antibody (JL-8) to AcGFP were obtained from Clontech. Human DOCK5 Cloning and Expression—RNA from Caco-2 cells and HUVECs was obtained using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA libraries were made using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The full-length DOCK5 cDNA clone was assembled from two partial Caco-2 cDNA clones and one partial cDNA clone (AK126249) obtained from the NITE Biological Resource Center (Kisarazu-shi, Chiba Prefecture, Japan), extending from 137 to 1700, 1682 to 2977, and 2833 to 6266, respectively, of the most recently compiled DOCK5 sequence (accession number NM024940; open reading frame from 138 to 5750). Silent mutations were introduced into one of the DOCK5 siRNA target regions (DOCK5-2 targeting 1682–1700) by using overlapping primers for the two Caco-2 cDNA library clones containing the silent mutations in the sequences at the start of the 49-base pair primers. Caco-2 cDNA library clones were amplified using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) for PCR and then verified by sequencing. Aside from the silent mutations introduced into the siRNA target region, the Caco-2 cDNA clones differed from the DOCK5 sequence given in NM024940 at three positions, none of which affected the protein sequence: A for G at 1028, which changes a valine codon from GTG to GTA; C for T at 1946, which changes a serine codon from CTT to CTC; and G for A at 2786, which changes a threonine codon from ACA to ACG. DOCK5 carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants were made by PCR using Vent polymerase or by using internal restriction enzyme sites to create in-frame stop codons. Eukaryotic expression expression vectors containing CrkII and CrkII W169L were obtained from Dr. Michiyuki Matsuda (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan), and PCR was used for cloning of cDNAs into pGEX4T-1 GST fusion protein expression vector (GE Healthcare). GST-CrkL expression vector was obtained from Dr. Ayako Arai and Dr. Osamu Miura (Tokyo Medical and Dental University), and PCR was used to introduce W160L mutation into the amino-terminal SH3 domain of this protein. All expression vectors derived by PCR were confirmed by sequencing. Cell Culture—The Caco-2 cell line used for this work was a subclone (Caco-2BBE) of the original Caco-2 cell line that was selected for its ability to differentiate in culture, as indicated by the formation of an apical brush border and brush border enzyme expression, and has been previously described (27Peterson M.D. Bement W.M. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 461-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Peterson M.D. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 445-460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Passage 45–67 Caco-2 cells were cultured as described previously (26Sanders M.A. Basson M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23516-23522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). HUVECs were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured according to their instructions. Coating of Cell Culture Dishes—Cell culture dishes were coated with a saturating concentration (29Madri J.A. Pratt B.M. Yannariello-Brown J. Am. J. Pathol. 1988; 132: 18-27PubMed Google Scholar) of collagen IV (12.5 μg/ml) in precoating buffer (15 mm Na2CO3, 35 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.4). Collagen IV-coated tissue culture dishes were overlaid with 1% heat-inactivated (80 °C, 30 min) bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 45 min at 37 °C prior to spreading studies. Cell Lysis—Cells were lysed on ice in modified radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm ethylene glycol-bis[β-aminoethyl ether]-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 50 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin). For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, deoxycholic acid and SDS were omitted from the lysis buffer. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were stored at –80 °C or, for coimmunoprecipitation experiments, used directly. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA® method (Pierce). Blots were detected by the ECL method (GE Healthcare) after transfer of gels to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Densitometry on autoradiographs of immunoblots was performed using an Eastman Kodak Co. 440CF Image Station within the linear range of exposure. Expression of Glutathione S-Transferase Fusion Proteins—BL21(DE3)pLysS Escherichia coli (Invitrogen) were transformed with control pGEX vector or pGEX vectors expressing CrkII, CrkL, or the corresponding mutant proteins (CrkII W169L and CrkL W160L) with the invariant tryptophan in the amino-terminal SH3 domain changed to leucine. 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 10-ml log phase cultures of BL21(DE3)pLysS for 2 h at 33 °C to induce expression of GST fusion proteins. Cultures were then lysed in modified radioimmunoprecipitation buffer, and lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 2–3 h at 4 °C. After beads were rinsed with modified radioimmunoprecipitation buffer, lysates of Caco-2 cells expressing HA-DOCK5 were added, and immunoprecipitations were continued overnight at 4 °C. Transfections—Caco-2 cells and HUVECs were transfected with siRNA using Oligofectamine and Plus reagent as described previously (26Sanders M.A. Basson M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23516-23522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For plasmid transfections, p100 dishes of Caco-2 cells were transfected with 5 μg of vector control or DOCK5 plasmid DNA, as described previously (26Sanders M.A. Basson M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23516-23522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For cell spreading experiments, cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector to indicate cells transfected with plasmid DNA. Cell Spreading and Migration—Cell spreading experiments were performed as described previously (26Sanders M.A. Basson M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23516-23522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, trypsinized cells were allowed to initially adhere for 15 min at 37 °C in serum-free medium to collagen IV-coated dishes blocked with bovine serum albumin. Nonadherent cells were then rinsed off with serum-free medium, and cells were allowed to continue spreading in serum-free medium at 37 °C for 90 min (Caco-2) or 30 min (HUVECs). Cells were plated at low density (∼5000 cells/well of a 6-well dish) to minimize cell-cell contacts that might interfere with cell spreading. Cells were stained with Harris modified hematoxylin after fixation with 10% formalin. Measurements of cell size were based on at least 150 cells for each condition in each experiment. For spreading experiments in which cells were transfected with plasmid DNA, cells were fixed and stained for β-galactosidase expression to identify transfected cells. In these experiments, measurements of cell size were based on at least 150 lacZ-positive cells for each condition in each experiment. For migration experiments, cells transfected with NT1 control or DOCK1 and DOCK5 siRNAs were replated 2 days after transfection on collagen IV-coated p60 Petri dishes in 0.3% serum medium (to minimize proliferation after replating) at 3 × 106 cells/dish. A uniform migrating front was then created the next day in the confluent cell monolayer, as described previously (25Sanders M.A. Basson M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: G547-G557Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and migrations were allowed to continue for 16–20 h. Measurements of migration area were based on at least five random measurements for each condition in each of five or more independent experiments. Statistical Analysis—Where indicated, results were compared using Student’s t test and considered statistically significant when p was <0.05. When indicating significance, an asterisk indicates p < 0.05, a double asterisk indicates p < 0.01, and a triple asterisk indicates p < 0.001. All experiments were done independently at least three times unless otherwise indicated. DOCK1 siRNA Only Partially Reduces Caco-2 Cell Spreading—We have previously observed that combined siRNA inhibition of the adaptor proteins CrkII and CrkL strongly inhibits Caco-2 cell spreading and migration on collagen IV by more than 40% and strongly inhibits lamellipodial formation at the leading edge of the migrating front (26Sanders M.A. Basson M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23516-23522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). siRNA targeting the GEF DOCK1, which is a downstream effector of CrkII and CrkL in numerous cell systems (1Hasegawa H. Kiyokawa E. Tanaka S. Nagashima K. Gotoh N. Shibuya M. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1770-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 30Albert M.L. Kim J.I. Birge R.B. Nat Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 31Reddien P.W. Horvitz H.R. Nat Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), only reduced cell spreading by 15% despite reducing DOCK1 protein levels by more than 95% (Fig. 1A). Among the DOCK1 family members most closely related to DOCK1 is DOCK5. Two siRNAs specifically targeting different regions of the DOCK5 mRNA each reduced cell spreading similarly to DOCK1 siRNA, whereas the combined DOCK1 and DOCK5 siRNAs inhibited cell spreading synergistically (36 ± 4% inhibition, n = 8, p < 0.001 compared with NT1 control siRNA; Fig. 1A; images in Fig. 1B). In order to confirm our results in a nonepithelial cell line, we examined HUVEC spreading on collagen IV (Fig. 1A). The DOCK1 and DOCK5 siRNAs had an even greater effect in this cell type, and, as in Caco-2 cells, the combined siRNAs acted synergistically (33 ± 2, 41 ± 7, and 57 ± 2% inhibition, respectively, for DOCK1, DOCK5, and combined siRNAs; n ≥ 3, p < 0.01 for each condition). Additionally, the combined DOCK1 and DOCK5 siRNAs inhibited HUVEC spreading similarly to the combined Crk and CrkL siRNAs (50 ± 6% inhibition, n = 3, p < 0.05 compared with NT1 control). As in Caco-2 cells, DOCK5 results were confirmed in HUVECs with two different DOCK5 siRNAs. Reverse transcriptase PCR using primers to a carboxyl-terminal portion of the DOCK5 open reading frame confirmed expression of DOCK5 in Caco-2 cells and HUVECs and reduction of DOCK5 mRNA by DOCK5 siRNA (Fig. 1C). TA vector cloning of the Caco-2 PCR product additionally confirmed its identity as DOCK5. Although the individual siRNAs to DOCK1 and DOCK5 slightly, but not significantly, inhibited Caco-2 cell migration (11 ± 5 and 9 ± 4% inhibition, respectively, for individual DOCK1 and DOCK5 siRNAs, n = 7 for each), as for cell spreading, the combination of DOCK1 and DOCK5 siRNAs synergistically inhibited Caco-2 sheet migration on collagen IV by 20 ± 3% (Fig. 1D, n = 5, p < 0.01 compared with NT1 control siRNA-transfected cells). Similarly to migrating Caco-2 cells in which CrkII and CrkL are reduced by siRNA (26Sanders M.A. Basson M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23516-23522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), Caco-2 cells transfected with the combination of DOCK1 and DOCK5 siRNAs had fewer lamellipodial extensions at the migrating front compared with NT1 control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 1D). Dock5 Requires CrkII/CrkL in Order to Restore Cell Spreading—Full-length DOCK5 was assembled from Caco-2 cDNA library clones and from a cDNA containing the carboxyl-terminal portion of DOCK5 obtained from the NITE Biological Resource Center (Fig. 2). During the process of cloning, eight silent mutations were introduced into one of the DOCK5 siRNA target regions (DOCK5-2) to allow expression of the HA-tagged DOCK5 in the presence of the DOCK5 siRNA used in Fig. 1A and 1C. The HA-tagged DOCK5 protein was expressed at the predicted size of ∼190 kDa (Fig. 3A). HA-DOCK5 reexpression in Caco-2 cells transfected with both DOCK1 and DOCK5-2 siRNAs restored cell spreading to control levels, verifying the function of DOCK5 in cell spreading in Caco-2 cells. HA-DOCK5 reexpression, however, did not affect cell spreading after siRNA reduction of CrkII and CrkL (Fig. 3B; immunoblots in Fig. 3C), indicating that DOCK5 function in cell spreading requires CrkII/CrkL. Additionally, HA-DOCK5 was present in both CrkII (Fig. 3D) and CrkL (Fig. 3E) immunoprecipitates from lysates of subconfluent spreading Caco-2 cells on either collagen I (Fig. 3D) or collagen IV (not shown). Treatment of cells with CrkII or CrkL siRNA greatly reduced the amount of HA-DOCK5 in the CrkII or CrkL immunoprecipitates, confirming the specificity of the association. Together, these results suggest that both CrkII and CrkL promote cell movement in part via DOCK5 and that DOCK5 function in cell spreading requires CrkII and CrkL.FIGURE 3DOCK5 expression and function in Caco-2 cell spreading. A, Caco-2 cells were transfected with pKH3 control vector or HA-tagged DOCK5 cDNA assembled as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, HA-DOCK5 expression compensates for DOCK1 function only in the presence of CrkII/CrkL. Cells were transfected with 250 nm NT1 siRNA, 50 nm CrkII, CrkL, and DOCK1, and 100 nm DOCK5-2 siRNAs or with 100 nm NT1, 50 nm DOCK1, and 100 nm DOCK5-2 siRNAs and then transfected with pKH3 control vector or HA-DOCK5 cDNA as indicated, along with β-galactosidase expression plasmid to indicate transfected cells, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For cell spreading studies, at least 150 lacZ-positive cells for each condition in each of three or more independent experiments were measured. **, p < 0.01 compared with pKH3 vector control C. The remaining cells not used for the spreading study in Fig. 3B were lysed and immunoblotted for the indicated proteins. D and E, DOCK5 associates with CrkII and CrkL. Lysates of subconfluent Caco-2 cells on collagen I transfected with the indicated siRNAs and with either pKH3 control vector or HA-DOCK5 were immunoprecipitated with CrkII or CrkL antibody and immunoblotted for HA-tagged DOCK5. One of three or more independent experiments is shown for both CrkII and CrkL. For both CrkII and CrkL coimmunoprecipitations, 100 nm DOCK5-2 siRNA was included in each transfection condition to reduce endogenous DOCK5 expression. F, CrkII and CrkL association with DOCK5 requires the amino-terminal SH3 domain of each protein. Lysates of Caco-2 cells transfected with HA-DOCK5 were immunoprecipitated with GST-CrkII, GST-CrkII W169L, GST-CrkL, or GST-CrkL W160L fusion proteins complexed to glutathione-Sepharose, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and then immunoblotted for HA tag or GST. One of four similar experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Amino-terminal SH3 Domains of CrkII and CrkL Mediate Their Association with DOCK5—The CrkII amino-terminal SH3 domain mediates its association with the adaptor protein C3G (32Knudsen B.S. Feller S.M. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32781-32787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and with DOCK1 (33Tanaka S. Hattori S. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Fukui Y. Nakamura S. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4409-4415Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The CrkII amino-terminal SH3 domain mutant W169L expressed at 10-fold lower levels than the wild-type protein in transfected Caco-2 cells (not shown), so in order to compare binding of the mutant and wild-type protein to DOCK5, they were expressed in E. coli as GST fusion proteins. Additionally, we compared the binding of DOCK5 to CrkL and CrkL with the corresponding mutation in its amino-terminal SH3 domain (W160L). Both CrkII W169L and CrkL W160L exhibited dramatically reduced association with DOCK5 compared with the respective unmutated protein (Fig. 3F), indicating that for both CrkII and CrkL, the amino-terminal SH3 domain is essential for mediating association with DOCK5.

https://openalex.org/W1978019342,"Bacterial hyaluronan lyase enzymes are the major virulence factors that enable greater microbial ingress by cleaving hyaluronan (HA) polymers present predominantly in extracellular space of vertebrates. Based on the premise that effective inhibitors may bind to and stabilize HA thereby protecting it from degradation, here we investigated inhibitory activity of human hyaluronan-binding protein 1 (HABP1) on bacterial hyaluronidase because it is highly specific to HA and localized on the cell surface. Biochemical characterization revealed that HABP1 is a competitive inhibitor of Streptococcus pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase (SpnHL) with an IC50 value of 22 μm. This is thus the first report of an endogenous protein inhibitor that may be used during natural antibacterial defense. Our findings also support a novel multipronged mechanism for the high efficacy of HABP1-mediated inhibition based on structural modeling of enzyme, substrate, and inhibitor. Evidence from docking simulations and contact interface interactions showed that the inherent charge asymmetry of HABP1 plays a key role in the inhibitory activity. This novel role of HABP1 may pave the way for peptide inhibitors as alternatives to synthetic chemicals in antibacterial research.

This novel role of HABP1 may pave the way for peptide inhibitors as alternatives to synthetic chemicals in antibacterial research. Bacterial hyaluronidases have long been known as the “spreading factors” or virulence factors responsible for a wide range of acute and invasive infections in humans causing life-threatening diseases, such as pneumonia, meningitis, and septicemia among many others (1Chain E. Duthie E.S. Nature.. 1939; 144: 977-978Google Scholar, 2Mathews M.B. Dorfman A. Physiol. Rev.. 1955; 35: 381-402Google Scholar, 3Hynes W.L. Walton S.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett.. 2000; 183: 201-207Google Scholar). These enzymes directly facilitate the spread of infection by degrading the HA 3The abbreviations used are: HA, hyaluronan; HABP1, hyaluronan-binding protein 1; SpnHL, S. pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase; a.s.a., accessible surface area. 3The abbreviations used are: HA, hyaluronan; HABP1, hyaluronan-binding protein 1; SpnHL, S. pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase; a.s.a., accessible surface area. matrix, which constitutes a highly organized network in the extracellular space in all vertebrates, acting as a diffusion barrier in vivo and regulating the transport of other substances through the intercellular space (4Rapport M.M. Linker A. Meyer K. J. Biol. Chem.. 1951; 192: 283-291Google Scholar). The HA matrix in extracellular matrix is mainly composed of HA polymer, a negatively charged polysaccharide of repeating disaccharide units of d-glucuronic acid (β-1,3) and N-acetyl-β-d-glucosamine, and is highly viscous in nature (5Laurent T.C. Laurent U.B. Fraser J.R. Immunol. Cell Biol.. 1996; 74: A1-7Google Scholar). Hyaluronidases are able to split this matrix, reducing its viscoelasticity and increasing membrane permeability, thereby allowing greater microbial access to or promoting diffusion between host tissues for colonization (4Rapport M.M. Linker A. Meyer K. J. Biol. Chem.. 1951; 192: 283-291Google Scholar, 6Day T.D. Nature.. 1950; 166: 785-786Google Scholar, 7Csoka T.B. Frost G.I. Stern R. Invasion Metastasis.. 1997; 17: 297-311Google Scholar). The organized structure of HA substantially influences binding to receptors and to the active site of hyaluronidases. Bacterial hyaluronidases, isolated from strains of various microorganisms such as Clostridium, Micrococcus, Streptococcus, or Streptomyces, degrade HA at very fast rates via a β-elimination reaction that cleaves the alternate β-1,4-glycosidic linkage between the repeating units, resulting in unsaturated disaccharide products (8Weissmann B. Meyer K. Sampson P. Linker A. J. Biol. Chem.. 1954; 208: 417-429Google Scholar, 9Kreil G. Protein Sci.. 1995; 4: 1666-1669Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of hyaluronidase-mediated degradation of HA has been very well elucidated through biochemical as well as structural investigations (10Jedrzejas M.J. Mewbourne R.B. Chantalat L. McPherson D.T. Protein Expr. Purif.. 1998; 13: 83-89Google Scholar, 11Li S. Kelly S.J. Lamani E. Ferraroni M. Jedrzejas M.J. EMBO J.. 2000; 19: 1228-1240Google Scholar), relatively little is known about the defense mechanisms used by the host during infection or about the role of HA and hyaluronidase in pathophysiological processes. It is believed that the balance of HA biosynthesis and intrinsic hyaluronidase levels may be regulated by invoking specific inhibitors (12Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R. FASEB J.. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Google Scholar, 13Stern R. Eur. J. Cell Biol.. 2004; 83: 317-325Google Scholar, 14Stern R. Glycobiology.. 2003; 13: 105R-115RGoogle Scholar). As a result, potent and specific inhibitors of bacterial hyaluronate lyase would have enormous therapeutic potential as drugs in the treatment of various bacterial infections.The search for effective hyaluronidase inhibitors began more than half a century ago (2Mathews M.B. Dorfman A. Physiol. Rev.. 1955; 35: 381-402Google Scholar, 15Meyer K. Rapport M.M. J. Biol. Chem.. 1951; 188: 485-490Google Scholar, 16Haas E. J. Biol.

Chem.. 1948; 174: 621-629Google Scholar) and continues to this day. Exogenous small molecule inhibitors have been identified, but they have weak potency and low selectivity, and there are many unanswered questions with regard to their mechanism of inhibition and whether they would be active against bacterial hyaluronidases as well. For example, heparins and derivatives of alginic acids (19Brodiagin N.A. Saburov G.E. Biull. Eksp. Biol. Med.. 1970; 70: 52-54Google Scholar, 20Asada M. Sugie M. Inoue M. Nakagomi K. Hongo S. Murata K. Irie S. Takeuchi T. Tomizuka N. Oka S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem.. 1997; 61: 1030-1032Google Scholar) have structural similarity to HA, whereas polyphenols, flavone analogues (21Kuppusamy U.R. Khoo H.E. Das N.P. Biochem. Pharmacol.. 1990; 40: 397-401Google Scholar), saponins, norlignans, or antiallergic drugs are among other reported inhibitors of hyaluronidases (22Mio K. Csoka A.B. Nawy S.S. Stern R. Methods Mol. Biol.. 2001; 171: 391-397Google Scholar, 23Udabage L. Brownlee G.R. Stern R. Brown T.J. Glycoconj. J.. 2004; 20: 461-471Google Scholar). Vitamin C, l-arginine derivatives, and fatty acids have been reported to inhibit streptococcal hyaluronidases at submillimolar concentrations, but a comparison of percent inhibition and IC50 values between these and previous reports is difficult because of differences in the experimental conditions (24Li S. Taylor K.B. Kelly S.J. Jedrzejas M.J. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 15125-15130Google Scholar, 25Spickenreither M. Braun S. Bernhardt G. Dove S. Buschauer A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett.. 2006; 16: 5313-5316Google Scholar, 26Suzuki K. Terasaki Y. Uyeda M. J. Enzyme Inhib. Med. Chem.. 2002; 17: 183-186Google Scholar). In view of the enormous medical applications of effective inhibitors, a systematic search has continued, using computer-aided drug design strategies. A rational analysis based on structural interactions led to the identification of a hydrophobic derivative of vitamin C as a strong inhibitor of Streptococcus agalactiae hyaluronidase, but it was weakly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, a major human Gram-positive pathogen (27Botzki A. Rigden D.J. Braun S. Nukui M. Salmen S. Hoechstetter J. Bernhardt G. Dove S. Jedrzejas M.J. Buschauer A. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 45990-45997Google Scholar). Computer-aided drug design-based strategies mainly explore new leads by virtue of structural similarity to HA or, in some cases, by rational de novo approaches. An alternative strategy may also exist wherein an inhibitor may bind to and stabilize HA thereby protecting it from degradation. Such an alternative is plausible because HA has been known to bind and interact with receptors and a large number of HA-binding proteins. Hyaladherins are a very well characterized and highly selective family of proteins reported to interact non-covalently with HA and have a wide array of functions, including receptor-mediated activation of intracellular signaling and structural aggregations in the extracellular matrix (28Turley E.A. Noble P.W. Bourguignon L.Y. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 4589-4592Google Scholar, 29Toole B.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol.. 1990; 2: 839-844Google Scholar, 30Day A.J. Prestwich G.D. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 4585-4588Google Scholar). We therefore began this work with the surmise that a potent hyaluronidase inhibitor may be supplied endogenously by one of these ubiquitous proteins. HABP1 (synonym human p32 or gC1qR), a member of the multifunctional hyaladherin family, is a 68-kDa protein originally purified and cloned from human fibroblast as a novel HA receptor by our group (31Deb T.B. Datta K. J. Biol. Chem.. 1996; 271: 2206-2212Google Scholar). In this work, HABP1 was tested as an inhibitor of bacterial hyaluronidase because we had already confirmed its localization on the cell surface (32Gupta S. Batchu R.B. Datta K. Eur. J. Cell Biol.. 1991; 56: 58-67Google Scholar). According to the crystal structure of HABP1, it exists as a homotrimer having N-terminal α-helices and asymmetric charge distribution with structural plasticity (33Jiang J. Zhang Y. Krainer A.R. Xu R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1999; 96: 3572-3577Google Scholar).Here we report the role of HABP1 as an inhibitor of S. pneumoniae hyaluronidase (SpnHL) and the elucidation of its competitive nature of inhibition. We also propose a unique multipronged mechanism of action based upon evidence from structural modeling of the interactions among substrate, enzyme, and inhibitor. Thus we present biochemical evidence for a novel role of HABP1 in pathophysiological processes as a highly potent inhibitor of SpnHL, offering a variety of avenues for optimization of selectivity and potency.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneral Materials and Reagents—Substrate from human umbilical cord HA was purchased from Sigma Co. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and obtained from Sigma.Purification and Estimation of HABP1—HABP1 (amino acids 74-282) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified following the method described earlier (34Jha B.K. Salunke D.M. Datta K. J. Biol. Chem.. 2003; 278: 27464-27472Google Scholar) with modifications using the 55-90% ammonium sulfate cut followed by ion exchange chromatography on Mono Q™ HR (10/10) column (Amersham Biosciences) using a linear gradient of 0-1 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, after washing the column with 150 mm NaCl in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2. The pooled peak fractions were dialyzed in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, and quantified for further use.Assay of SpnHL Enzymatic Activity—The activity of SpnHL was determined following the method described earlier (35Akhtar M.S. Bhakuni V. J. Biol. Chem.. 2003; 278: 25509-25516Google Scholar) and is defined as its ability to break down HA to unsaturated disaccharide units (36Yamagata T. Saito H. Habuchi O. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem.. 1968; 243: 1523-1535Google Scholar). In a 1-ml solution of 0.2 mg/ml HA in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 6.5, 10 μl of enzyme sample (3 ng/μl, diluted just before taking measurement) was added. The reaction mixture was incubated for 5 min during which the measurements were carried out by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 232 nm at 25 °C in a Cary 100 Bio UV-visible double beam spectrophotometer (Varian Inc.).Determination of Inhibitory Activity on Hyaluronidase—The in vitro enzyme inhibition experiments were performed with varying concentrations of HABP1. The inhibitory effect of HABP1 on S. pneumoniae hyaluronidase was measured by using two different enzymatic inhibition assays. In the first assay 0.2 mg/ml HA was preincubated with varying concentrations (0-100 μm) of HABP1 for 1 h at 4 °C ina l-ml reaction volume of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 6.5. The reaction was initiated with 30 ng of enzyme, and activity was measured. In the second assay, 30 ng of SpnHL was preincubated in the above mentioned 1-ml reaction volume of buffer with varying concentrations of HABP1 (0-100 μm) for 1 h at 4 °C. The reaction was initiated with 0.2 mg/ml HA, and enzymatic activity was measured. In both assays, the reaction was initiated exactly at 60 s after the addition of either enzyme or HA, respectively, to the reaction mixture. The progress of the reaction was monitored by detecting the appearance of HA oligosaccharide at 232 nm absorbance.Enzyme Activity in Absence and Presence of Inhibitor—To study the effect of varying the concentration of substrate in the presence of inhibitor, HA concentration in solution was expressed as moles of hexasaccharide based on a hexasaccharide molecular weight of 1203.9 (37Jedrzejas M.J. Mello L.V. de Groot B.L. Li S. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 28287-28297Google Scholar). In the absence of inhibitor, varying concentrations of HA (0.0625-0.750 mm) in 150 mm sodium acetate buffer, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 6.5, was added to the enzyme (30 ng), and the activity was measured. In the presence of inhibitor, 20 μm HABP1 was preincubated with the enzyme (30 ng) for 1 h at 4 °C ina 1-ml reaction volume of buffer, increasing concentrations of HA (0.0625-0.750 mm) were added, and enzymatic activity was measured exactly 60 s after the HA was added to the reaction mixture. The progress of the reaction was monitored by detecting the appearance of HA oligosaccharide at 232 nm absorbance.Initial Velocity Measurement and Data Analysis—The reaction progress curves for the enzymatic activity and enzyme inhibition were obtained by measurement of the absorbance at 232 nm due to the unsaturated disaccharide product. The reaction was carried out in a 1-ml solution of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 6.5, with substrate concentration ranging from 0.2072 to 0.3469 mm HA in the above buffer. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of enzyme in the same buffer. The product absorbance was measured every 60 s for 5 min at 25 °C. The reaction progress was linear over the time of measurement within the precision of the instrument. The initial velocity of the reaction was determined from the increase in absorbance over the first 5 min of the reaction. The slope was divided by the molar absorption coefficient for the disaccharide product, 5.5 × 103 mol-1 cm-1 (36Yamagata T. Saito H. Habuchi O. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem.. 1968; 243: 1523-1535Google Scholar). The values were calculated and expressed in μm/min HA degradation by SpnHL in the presence of HABP1.The data for initial velocity, Vi, from each experiment in which the concentration of substrate, S, was varied, were fit into the Michaelis-Menten equation with a nonlinear regression program (GraphPad Prism, version 5, GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). For all experiments, goodness-of-fit statistics showed that R2 and correlation values were greater than 0.987 and 0.982, respectively. Among the curve fitting results, the program gave values of Vmax and Km as well as their respective standard deviations (σ).Computational Simulations—The structural details of the interactions among substrate, enzyme, and inhibitor were elucidated by molecular docking experiments. Available crystal structures of the S. pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase (Protein Data Bank code 1LOH) and human HABP1 (Protein Data Bank code 1P32) were used for docking studies (33Jiang J. Zhang Y. Krainer A.R. Xu R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1999; 96: 3572-3577Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of the HA oligomers, namely disaccharide, tetrasaccharide, and hexasaccharide, were processed from the available crystal structure complex of SpnHL and HA hexasaccharide (Protein Data Bank code 1LOH). Details of local non-covalent interactions were studied using an in-house Fortran program/script that requires an interacting complex in Protein Data Bank format. The solvent-accessible area lost upon complexation was measured using NACCESS (38Hubbard S.J. Thornton J.M. NACCESS. University College, London1993Google Scholar). All visualizations and renderings were done using VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics) (39Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph.. 1996; 14 (27-38): 33-38Google Scholar) and PyMOL (40Delano W.L. The PyMOL User's Manual. Delano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA2002Google Scholar).Substrate Inhibitor Interaction—The three-dimensional structure of the inhibitor (Protein Data Bank code 1P32) having three potential active sites (one per monomer) was treated as the static “receptor” molecule with HA polysaccharide as the mobile “ligand” molecule. The three processed HA oligomers were docked to HABP1, one at a time, with the experimentally characterized BX7B (where B is a basic residue) HA binding motif (residues 119-128, 1P32 numbering) defined as the binding site (31Deb T.B. Datta K. J. Biol. Chem.. 1996; 271: 2206-2212Google Scholar, 41Yang B. Yang B.L. Savani R.C. Turley E.A. EMBO J.. 1994; 13: 286-296Google Scholar). Flex-X molecular docking program was used because it is able to accurately predict the geometry of the protein-ligand complex for a protein with known three-dimensional structure and a small ligand molecule. Flex-X is based on a robust incremental construction algorithm where the ligand is decomposed into pieces and thereafter flexibly rebuilt in the active site using multiple placement strategies followed by a ranking of all orientations using a variety of scoring functions. Hydrogens were added to both structures before the experiment. Default parameter values were used, and the top ranking orientations were considered for further analysis.Enzyme Inhibitor Interaction—The enzyme S. pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase protein (Protein Data Bank code 1LOH), which was the smaller of the two proteins, was kept flexible and docked onto the HABP1 homotrimer, which was kept static. Preprocessing of the hyaluronidase involved removal of HA and water molecules. The receptor and ligand were projected onto a 160-Å cubical grid using ZDOCK, a rigid body docking program, followed by a refinement program, RDOCK. ZDOCK uses a fast Fourier transform to search all possible binding modes for the proteins, evaluating based on shape complementarity, desolvation energy, and electrostatics. The top 2000 predictions from ZDOCK were submitted to RDOCK where they were minimized by CHARMM (Chemistry at Harvard Molecular Mechanics) to improve the energies and eliminate clashes. Finally the electrostatic and desolvation energies were recomputed by RDOCK, and the top ranking complex was selected for analysis of the contact interface.RESULTSIn Vitro Effect of HABP1 on the Activity of SpnHLThe in vitro enzyme inhibition experiments demonstrated that highly purified HABP1 inhibits SpnHL activity in a concentration-dependent manner as shown in Fig. 1. The activity of purified SpnHL gradually decreased in the presence of increasing concentrations of purified HABP1 either when HABP1 was preincubated with HA and the reaction was initiated with SpnHL or when it was preincubated with the enzyme SpnHL and the reaction was initiated with HA. This can be seen much better in Fig. 1B, which shows a plot of percent inhibition of SpnHL activity versus inhibitor concentration. HABP1 was found to inhibit SpnHL with an IC50 value of 22 μm.Structural Modeling: Binding of HA Hexasaccharide to HABP1It has been reported that the alternate β-1,4-glycosidic linkage within HA gets cleaved by SpnHL (37Jedrzejas M.J. Mello L.V. de Groot B.L. Li S. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 28287-28297Google Scholar), and we were interested in finding out whether HABP1 mediates SpnHL inhibition by protecting this bond during its interaction with HA. To test this, we structurally modeled the HABP1 and HA interaction. The results showed that binding of HA to HABP1 indeed involves the β-1,4-glycosidic linkage site on the HA oligomer, explaining the observed reduction in enzyme activity.Docking simulations depicted a steric fit between substrate and inhibitor. Interestingly when the top ranking orientations were analyzed to elucidate the molecular details of binding, the HA hexasaccharide was predicted to bind with an energy of -7.59 kcal/mol, whereas the tetrasaccharide and disaccharide HA oligomers showed binding energies of -6.56 and -6.28 kcal/mol, respectively. These observations are in agreement with previous experimental reports stating that the HA hexasaccharide shows better binding affinity than its shorter oligomers (42Deb T.B. Majumdar M. Bhardwaj A. Jha B.K. Datta K. Kennedy J.F. Philips G.O. Williams P.A. Hyaluronan. 1. Woodhead Publishing Ltd, Cambridge, UK2001: 365-372Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the top ranking confirmation between the hexasaccharide substrate and inhibitor after refinement as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A total of 24 contacts were observed between the sugar and HABP1 of which 17 were from chain A and seven were from chain B. Thus, only two of the three polypeptide chains of HABP1 participate in this interaction, and binding occurs at the junction of these two chains. The hexasaccharide sugar was found to bind with HABP1 strongly via hydrophobic as well as hydrogen bond interactions. Interestingly the two β-1,4-glycosidic linkages of the HA polymer (one between HA1 and HA2 and the other between HA2 and HA3) are both entirely buried in this complex; they are tethered on both sides by hydrogen bonds as well as hydrophobic interactions. For example, the C-1 and C-4 carbon atoms that mediate the β-1,4-glycosidic linkages are bound by multiple hydrophobic interactions with HABP1 residues His-75 and Thr-76 for the first linkage and Asp-245, Arg-246, and Gly-247 for the second linkage. Furthermore residue Arg-122 of the HA binding motif plays a key role in the first linkage, making hydrogen bonds with the glucuronate moiety on the sugar preceding the linkage and the secondary alcohol group on the sugar succeeding the linkage. Motif residues Arg-122 and Ala-125 also participate in hydrophobic interactions with the ligand. The binding between HABP1 and the HA hexasaccharide is further strengthened by side chains of Lys-80, Ser-106, and Arg-244 that make hydrogen bonds with the sugar and Met-74, Gly-107, Asp-249, and Thr-251 that are involved in hydrophobic interactions. Atomic details of the all these interactions have been provided in Table 1.FIGURE 2Model of hyaluronan binding by HABP1. Each monomer of the HABP1 trimer has been shown in distinct colors. The docked complex depicts HA hexamer (shown in atom colors) closely bound to one of the HA binding motifs (depicted in gray) on the trimeric HABP1 protein. The inset zooms into the complex to show the details of the contact interface between the ligand and receptor. Hydrogen bonds are depicted as yellow dashes. As can be seen, the β-1,4-glycosidic linkage is protected during binding, being tethered by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interaction on all sides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Interactions and surface accessibility at the HABP1-HA hexasaccharide contact interfaceView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Thus the collective strength of a substantial number of non-covalent interactions at the contact interface enhances the binding of HA oligomers to HABP1, thereby protecting HA from degradation. It may be noted that the inhibitor is in the homotrimeric form, and the interaction causes a very small loss of accessible surface area (479 Å2; roughly 2% of the entire molecule) at one of the three interchain junctions (see Fig. 2). Therefore it is plausible that the remaining two interchain junctions of HABP1 could potentially bind more HA molecules, or a much longer HA polymer may utilize all three binding sites at various regions along its length, ensuring protection.Competitive Nature of SpnHL Inhibition by HABP1To determine the nature of inhibition observed during the preincubation of SpnHL and HABP1 (Fig. 1), enzyme assays were carried out either in the absence or in the presence of purified HABP1 (20 μm). Fig. 3 depicts the plot of substrate concentrations against the enzyme activity in the presence and absence of inhibitor. An inhibition of 20-30% was observed in the presence of the inhibitor. The plot shows that reaction was linear over the time of measurement, and the initial velocity and other parameters were calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The Km was calculated to be 0.2765 and 0.41129 mm in the absence and presence of the inhibitor, respectively. A Lineweaver-Burke plot (double reciprocal) of the data obtained was indicative of competitive inhibition. The value for Ki was obtained from plots of 1/V versus 1/[S]. It was found that HABP1 inhibits the enzyme at a Ki value of 34.24 μm. These results confirmed that the inhibition observed in Fig. 1 is competitive in nature.FIGURE 3Lineweaver-Burke plot representing competitive nature of inhibition. A, Michaelis-Menten graph. B, Lineweaver-Burke plot. In both cases, curve ○ represents enzyme activity in the absence of HABP1 (0 μm), and curve ▴ represents 20-30% inhibition of enzyme activity in the presence of HABP1 (20 μm). The Km and Vmax values were calculated according to the Lineweaver-Burke plot. Each plot is representative of at least more than four separate experiments. The Km was calculated to be 0.2765 and 0.41129 mm in the absence and presence of the inhibitor, respectively. The inhibitor inhibits the enzyme at a Ki value of 34.24 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Structural Modeling: Inhibition of Hyaluronidase Mediated by HABP1To comprehend the molecular details and structural implications of the observed competitive inhibition, HABP1 was docked with SpnHL as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Analysis of the top ranking docking complex confirmed that HABP1 binds to the enzyme in the same region where substrate HA has been reported to bind (37Jedrzejas M.J. Mello L.V. de Groot B.L. Li S. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 28287-28297Google Scholar); the data thus support the competitive inhibition observed in the experimental assays.Fig. 4A depicts the overall mode of binding with the inset (Fig. 4B) showing the molecular details of the interaction. An accessible surface area (a.s.a.) of ∼2938 Å2 (roughly 11% of the total a.s.a.) is buried on the negatively charged face of HABP1 trimer upon binding to SpnHL, occluding an a.s.a. of 5489 Å2 (roughly 20% of total a.s.a.) from the enzyme around its active site cleft. The majority of interactions at the contact interface emerge from the juxtaposition of these two large and oppositely charged surfaces. All three monomers of the inhibitor participate in binding. The refined model of binding revealed a total of 207 contacts between the two structures mediated by 49 residues from HABP1 and 81 residues from SpnHL. Of these, 25 are ionic interactions. The inhibitory activity of HABP1 is evidently due to the combined effect of the considerable number of non-covalent interactions it forms with catalytically essential residues in the active site of the enzyme.FIGURE 4HABP1 binding to SpnHL. The enzyme SpnHL (green schematic) is shown docked with the inhibitor HABP1 (trimer shown in silver schematic). The active site is in the α-domain of the enzyme; catalytic triad residues have been labeled and depicted in orange ball-and-stick model. Residues of the aromatic patch can be seen in pink (dots in A and lines in B); the negative patch in the active site is depicted in red (dots in A and lines in B). Non-covalent interactions all along the contact interface are represented as dashed lines of distinct colors, namely hydrogen bonds (yellow), electrostatic interactions (blue), and hydrophobic interactions (cyan). Residues of both molecules involved in these interactions are colored in the same color as the interaction. (Only main chain carbon atoms are shown to maintain cla"
https://openalex.org/W2125672886,"The bacterial protein DsbD transfers reductant from the cytoplasm to the otherwise oxidizing environment of the periplasm. This reducing power is required for several essential pathways, including disulfide bond formation and cytochrome c maturation. DsbD includes a transmembrane domain (tmDsbD) flanked by two globular periplasmic domains (nDsbD/cDsbD); each contains a cysteine pair involved in electron transfer via a disulfide exchange cascade. The final step in the cascade involves reduction of the Cys103-Cys109 disulfide of nDsbD by Cys461 of cDsbD. Here we show that a complex between the globular periplasmic domains is trapped in vivo only when both are linked by tmDsbD. We have found previously (Mavridou, D. A., Stevens, J. M., Ferguson, S. J., & Redfield, C. (2007) J. Mol. Biol.370, 643-658) that the attacking cysteine (Cys461) in isolated cDsbD has a high pKa value (10.5) that makes this thiol relatively unreactive toward the target disulfide in nDsbD. Here we show using NMR that active-site pKa values change significantly when cDsbD forms a complex with nDsbD. This modulation of pKa values is critical for the specificity and function of cDsbD. Uncomplexed cDsbD is a poor nucleophile, allowing it to avoid nonspecific reoxidation; however, in complex with nDsbD, the nucleophilicity of cDsbD increases permitting reductant transfer. The observation of significant changes in active-site pKa values upon complex formation has wider implications for understanding reactivity in thiol:disulfide oxidoreductases.

The observation of significant changes in active-site pKa values upon complex formation has wider implications for understanding reactivity in thiol:disulfide oxidoreductases. DsbD is a unique protein that transfers reductant across the cytoplasmic membrane to the periplasm in many Gram-negative bacteria (1Kadokura H. Katzen F. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 2003; 72: 111-135Google Scholar, 2Ito K. Inaba K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol... 2008; 18: 450-458Google Scholar). Provision of reductant to the periplasm is required because this compartment is otherwise considered to be an oxidizing environment (2Ito K. Inaba K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol... 2008; 18: 450-458Google Scholar). DsbD includes three domains, each containing a pair of cysteine residues that perform a series of disulfide exchange reactions (Fig. 1A). In the first step, the transmembrane domain (tmDsbD) accepts electrons from thioredoxin in the cytoplasm; these are then transferred to the periplasmic C-terminal domain (cDsbD) and finally to the N-terminal domain (nDsbD), which is also located in the periplasm (3Katzen F. Beckwith J. Cell.. 2000; 103: 769-779Google Scholar, 4Gordon E.H. Page M.D. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Mol. Microbiol... 2000; 35: 1360-1374Google Scholar, 5Collet J.F. Riemer J. Bader M.W. Bardwell J.C. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 26886-26892Google Scholar). nDsbD acts as a junction point for several pathways that require reductant, including the general disulfide isomerase system and the pathway that is thought to reduce the cysteine thiols of apocytochromes in the cytochrome c biogenesis pathway (6Crooke H. Cole J. Mol. Microbiol... 1995; 15: 1139-1150Google Scholar). In Gram-positive bacteria, CcdA, an integral membrane protein, and ResA, which has a thioredoxin fold, provide the reductant required for cytochrome c maturation (7Hodson C.T. Lewin A. Hederstedt L. Le Brun N.E. J. Bacteriol... 2008; 190: 4697-4705Google Scholar). Structural studies have sought to explain how DsbD functions and interacts with its various partners. The structures of the two soluble periplasmic domains have been determined (Fig. 1A, left). nDsbD has an immunoglobulin-like structure (8Goulding C.W. Sawaya M.R. Parseghian A. Lim V. Eisenberg D. Missiakas D. Biochemistry.. 2002; 41: 6920-6927Google Scholar, 9Haebel P.W. Goldstone D. Katzen F. Beckwith J. Metcalf P. EMBO J.. 2002; 21: 4774-4784Google Scholar) and is the only known thiol:disulfide oxidoreductase with this fold. cDsbD has the more typical thioredoxin fold found in many oxidoreductases; this has the characteristic active-site CXXC motif (10Stirnimann C.U. Rozhkova A. Grauschopf U. Bockmann R.A. Glockshuber R. Capitani G. Grutter M.G. J. Mol. Biol... 2006; 358: 829-845Google Scholar, 11Kim J.H. Kim S.J. Jeong D.G. Son J.H. Ryu S.E. FEBS Lett... 2003; 543: 164-169Google Scholar). A covalent complex between single-cysteine variants of each of these two domains was produced in vitro and its x-ray structure solved (12Rozhkova A. Stirnimann C.U. Frei P. Grauschopf U. Brunisholz R. Grutter M.G. Capitani G. Glockshuber R. EMBO J.. 2004; 23: 1709-1719Google Scholar), revealing the interface between the two domains (Fig. 1A, right). Although this mixed disulfide is accepted as a physiological intermediate in the function of DsbD, an in vivo complex between the two soluble domains has not been reported previously (3Katzen F. Beckwith J. Cell.. 2000; 103: 769-779Google Scholar). Further complexes between nDsbD and its other physiological partners have also been trapped and their structures examined (9Haebel P.W. Goldstone D. Katzen F. Beckwith J. Metcalf P. EMBO J.. 2002; 21: 4774-4784Google Scholar, 13Stirnimann C.U. Rozhkova A. Grauschopf U. Grutter M.G. Glockshuber R. Capitani G. Structure (Lond.).. 2005; 13: 985-993Google Scholar). Interestingly, all of the interaction partners of nDsbD are thioredoxin-like proteins; similarities in their folds are congruous with common interaction interfaces (14Stirnimann C.U. Grutter M.G. Glockshuber R. Capitani G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci... 2006; 63: 1642-1648Google Scholar). However, only cDsbD will reduce nDsbD, whereas nDsbD will reduce several partners. This raises questions about how the direction of reductant flow is maintained and controlled within the series of disulfide-exchange reactions. As part of our structural and mechanistic characterization of DsbD and its domains in solution, we have previously measured by NMR the pKa values of the active-site cysteine pair, Cys461 and Cys464, of cDsbD (numbered according to the full-length Escherichia coli DsbD sequence) (15Mavridou D.A. Stevens J.M. Ferguson S.J. Redfield C. J. Mol. Biol... 2007; 370: 643-658Google Scholar). An unusually high pKa value of 10.5 was measured for the N-terminal cysteine of the CXXC motif, Cys461, and the pKa value of the second cysteine, Cys464, was significantly higher than the maximum pH value that was studied (pH 12.2). The pKa value of 10.5 is the highest reported for the N-terminal cysteine of the CXXC motif in a thioredoxin fold. The striking consequence of the elevated pKa value is that the active-site cysteine of cDsbD, Cys461, is not strongly nucleophilic, raising critical questions about how this cysteine reacts with the disulfide in nDsbD. It was demonstrated using site-directed mutagenesis that the negatively charged side chains of Asp455 and Glu468, which are located close to the CXXC motif (Fig. 1B), are responsible for the unusually high pKa value of Cys461; mutation of one or both of these residues to Asn and Gln, respectively, resulted in decreases in the pKa value of Cys461 from 10.5 to 9.9 (E468Q), to 9.3 (D455N), and to 8.6 (D455N/E468Q). The pKa values for Asp455 were found to be 5.9 and 6.6 in oxidized and reduced cDsbD; these values are significantly higher than the value of ∼4 for an unperturbed aspartic acid. We postulated that the properties of the amino acid side chains in the immediate environment of the cysteines in cDsbD would change upon complex formation with nDsbD, changing the reactivity of the cysteines and explaining how the reaction between the two domains is initiated (15Mavridou D.A. Stevens J.M. Ferguson S.J. Redfield C. J. Mol. Biol... 2007; 370: 643-658Google Scholar). Specifically, we proposed that an increase in the pKa value of Asp455 upon complex formation would lead to a decrease in the pKa value of Cys461, thereby making it a better nucleophile. Stirnimann et al. (10Stirnimann C.U. Rozhkova A. Grauschopf U. Bockmann R.A. Glockshuber R. Capitani G. Grutter M.G. J. Mol. Biol... 2006; 358: 829-845Google Scholar) previously presented pKa calculations suggesting an increase in the Asp455 pKa value upon complex formation. The aim of this work has been to determine the molecular basis of the control of the reactivity of the active-site cysteine residues in cDsbD, using NMR to compare the active-site properties of cDsbD alone and in its physiological complex with nDsbD. We demonstrate that the pKa value of Asp455 is elevated by at least 1.1 pH units when cDsbD forms a complex with nDsbD. This modulation of the pKa value is critical for the specificity and function of cDsbD. These in vitro studies are complemented by in vivo studies on complex formation, in which we have trapped the nDsbD-cDsbD complex for the first time. The results of our experiments explain how the intramolecular disulfide cascade within the soluble domains of DsbD functions, and demonstrate the importance of the transmembrane domain in controlling and facilitating complex formation between the soluble domains. Construction of DsbD Plasmids—The plasmid pDzc1 was used to express isolated wild-type cDsbD bearing a C-terminal His6 tag and the plasmid pDzc5 a single cysteine variant (C464A) of cDsbD with a thrombin cleavage site preceding the C-terminal His6 tag. Isolated nDsbD with the PelB signal peptide replacing the endogenous signal peptide and with a C-terminal streptavidin tag was expressed from the plasmid pDzn1, and from that a single-cysteine variant (C103A) was produced. Finally, the full-length construct in which nDsbD and cDsbD could be cleaved from tmDsbD (thrombin-cleavable DsbD) was expressed from pDsbd4. Details of the production of the above plasmids can be found in supplemental material. Protein Production, Purification, and Characterization—All experiments were performed in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Stratagene). All cells expressing unlabeled protein were grown at 37 °C in 500-ml volumes of Luria Bertani (LB) broth in 2-liter flasks from overnight starter cultures (grown at 37 °C). SDS-PAGE analysis was carried out on 10-20% BisTris 6The abbreviations used are: BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; DDM, n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence. NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) with prestained protein markers (SeeBlue Plus 2, Invitrogen). Overexpression of Thrombin-cleavable DsbD—Bacteria transformed with pDsbd4 were grown with 100 μg ml-1 carbenicillin to an A600 of 0.7 before addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After further incubation for 3 h the cells were harvested, and the crude membrane fraction was isolated using a French press. Disruption of the cells was performed at 16,000 p.s.i. which was followed by centrifugation at 257,000 × g for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The membrane fraction was solubilized at a protein concentration of 5 mg ml-1 for 1 h at 4 °C under gentle agitation in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, 20% v/v glycerol, 1% w/v n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM) (Anatrace) (pH 7.5). Unsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation at 257,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to 10 ml of Fast Flow Chelating-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) charged with Ni2+. The column was washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 0.1% w/v DDM (pH 7.5), and the bound protein was eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 200 mm imidazole, 0.1% w/v DDM (pH 7.5). A concentrated protein solution of 0.5 ml was applied to a Superdex 200 (HR) size-exclusion column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.03% w/v DDM (pH 7.5). The purest fractions were pooled and concentrated to 0.5 ml. To prevent artifactual thiol-disulfide exchange reactions from occurring during the thrombin cleavage, free thiols were alkylated with N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma) (16Katzen F. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2003; 100: 10471-10476Google Scholar). Purified protein was incubated in the presence of 30 mm N-ethylmaleimide for 1 h at room temperature. After removal of the excess alkylating reagent, the protein was cleaved using the thrombin Clean-Cleave kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). The presence of the nDsbD-cDsbD mixed disulfide was confirmed by Western blotting using two primary antibodies as follows: 1) penta-His HRP-conjugated monoclonal antibody (Qiagen), and 2) goat antiserum raised against the cDsbD sequence of E. coli DsbD and donkey anti-sheep alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (Sigma), as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. Characterization of the nDsbD-cDsbD Mixed Disulfide Formed in Vivo—The covalent complex between nDsbD and cDsbD was N-terminally sequenced from protein samples in SDS-polyacrylamide gels that were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The protein bands were excised and subjected to automated Edman sequencing using an Applied Biosystems 494A Procise protein sequencer. Simultaneous Overexpression of nDsbD and C464A-cDsbD—Bacteria transformed with pDzn1 and pDzc5 were grown with 100 μg ml-1 ampicillin and 20 μg ml-1 gentamycin to an A600 of 1.2 before addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After further incubation for 4 h, the cells were harvested spheroplasted as described (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc, New York2003: 16.1-16.8Google Scholar) omitting EDTA. Western blotting of the extracted periplasm for the detection of the nDsbD-cDsbD mixed disulfide complex was done using two primary antibodies as follows: 1) StrepMAB-Classic HRP-conjugated monoclonal antibody (IBA GmbH), and 2) penta-His HRP-conjugated monoclonal antibody (Qiagen). Production and Purification of the C103A-nDsbD-15N-C464A-cDsbD Complex for NMR Studies—The mixed disulfide complex was formed in vitro using C103A-nDsbD and uniformly 15N-labeled C464A-cDsbD purified separately from BL21(DE3) cells (Stratagene). For the production of C103A-nDsbD, cells transformed with pDzn2 were grown at 30 °C with 20 μg ml-1 gentamycin to an A600 of 1.5 before addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After further incubation for 4 h at 37 °C the cells were harvested and spheroplasted as described (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc, New York2003: 16.1-16.8Google Scholar) omitting EDTA. The periplasmic fraction was applied to 5 ml of Strep-Tactin-Sepharose (IBA GmbH) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.5). The column was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 m NaCl (pH 7.5), and the protein was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm desthiobiotin (IBA GmbH) (pH 7.5) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Production and purification of 15N-labeled C464A-cDsbD were done in the same way as for wild-type cDsbD, as described in previous work (15Mavridou D.A. Stevens J.M. Ferguson S.J. Redfield C. J. Mol. Biol... 2007; 370: 643-658Google Scholar). The C103A-nDsbD-15N-C464A-cDsbD mixed disulfide complex was prepared using a reported method (12Rozhkova A. Stirnimann C.U. Frei P. Grauschopf U. Brunisholz R. Grutter M.G. Capitani G. Glockshuber R. EMBO J.. 2004; 23: 1709-1719Google Scholar). First, C103A-nDsbD was mixed with 10 mm dithiobisnitrobenzoic acid (Sigma) at 25 °C for 30 min. After removal of excess dithiobisnitrobenzoic acid, it was mixed with equimolar 15N-C464A-cDsbD and incubated as above. The reaction mixture was purified by two affinity chromatography steps, each specific to one of the domains. The mixture was applied to 3 ml of Fast Flow Chelating-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) charged with Ni2+and purified as described previously (15Mavridou D.A. Stevens J.M. Ferguson S.J. Redfield C. J. Mol. Biol... 2007; 370: 643-658Google Scholar). After removing the imidazole, the protein solution was applied to 3 ml of Strep-Tactin-Sepharose (IBA GmbH) and was purified as described above for C103A-nDsbD. The nDsbD-15N-cDsbD mixed-disulfide sample was of high purity as assessed using SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. S1A), and its correct molecular weight was verified by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (expected mass, 33,187 Da; observed mass, 33,185 Da). Production and Purification of the 15N-labeled Wild Type and C464A-cDsbD—15N-Labeled wild-type cDsbD and C464A-cDsbD were used as control proteins for the pH titration of the nDsbD-15N-cDsbD mixed disulfide. Both proteins were produced and purified as described previously (15Mavridou D.A. Stevens J.M. Ferguson S.J. Redfield C. J. Mol. Biol... 2007; 370: 643-658Google Scholar). pH Titration of the nDsbD-15N-cDsbD Mixed Disulfide Using NMR Spectroscopy—The 1HN and 15N resonances of C464A-cDsbD as a separate domain and in the nDsbD-15N-cDsbD mixed disulfide were assigned using uniformly 15N-labeled samples of 0.8 mm protein for the isolated domains and 0.5 mm protein for the mixed disulfide, in 95% H2O, 5% D2O at pH 6.5. Assignments for C464A-cDsbD in the isolated domain and in the nDsbD-15N-cDsbD complex were obtained by comparison of three-dimensional 15N-edited nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy-HSQC and total correlation spectroscopy-HSQC spectra with the previously assigned spectra of reduced wild-type cDsbD (15Mavridou D.A. Stevens J.M. Ferguson S.J. Redfield C. J. Mol. Biol... 2007; 370: 643-658Google Scholar). NMR experiments for the determination of the pKa values of Asp455 in the active-site of cDsbD in the nDsbD-15N-cDsbD mixed disulfide were performed using 0.5 mm of complex in 95% H2O, 5% D2O. Determination of the pKa values of Asp455 in the active-site of 15N-labeled wild-type cDsbD and C464A-cDsbD was done in the same way as a control experiment. In the case of the 15N-labeled wild-type cDsbD, the sample was a ∼1:1 mixture of oxidized and reduced protein allowing simultaneous measurement of the pKa value for the two oxidation states. The pH of solutions was adjusted by using small volumes of 0.1-1 m HCl or 0.1-1 m NaOH. The pH of the samples was measured before and after each experiment, and the average of the two measurements was used for data analysis. The pH values given are direct pH meter readings measured at room temperature. Two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra were collected at 313 K on a home-built 750-MHz NMR spectrometer, which is controlled with GE/Omega software and is equipped with a home-built triple-resonance pulsed-field gradient probe-head. Sweep widths of 9345.79 Hz and 2500 were used in F2 (1H) and F1 (15N), respectively. 128 complex 15N increments of 8, 12, and 96 scans were collected with 1024 complex points in the acquisition dimension for 15N-labeled wild-type cDsbD, C464A-cDsbD, and the nDsbD-15N-cDsbD mixed disulfide complex, respectively. NMR data were processed and visualized using NMRPipe, NMRDraw, and NMRView (18Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR.. 1995; 6: 277-293Google Scholar, 19Johnson B.A. Methods Mol. Biol... 2004; 278: 313-352Google Scholar). Peak picking was carried out using in-house software. pH Titration of [3-13C]Cysteine-labeled Wild Type and D455N-cDsbD—1H-13C HSQC experiments for the determination of the pKa value of Cys461 at 313 K were performed on solutions containing ∼1.5 mm of [3-13C]cysteine-labeled wild-type or D455N cDsbD in 99% D2O as described previously at 298 K (15Mavridou D.A. Stevens J.M. Ferguson S.J. Redfield C. J. Mol. Biol... 2007; 370: 643-658Google Scholar). Dithiothreitol was added to maintain the proteins in the reduced state. Data Fitting—pKa values for Asp455 were determined from 1HN or 15N chemical shifts measured as a function of pH. pKa values for Cys461 were determined from 1Hβ or 13Cβ chemical shifts measured as a function of pH. The titration data were fitted to either one or two pKa curves (20Shrager R.I. Cohen J.S. Heller S.R. Sachs D.H. Schechter A.N. Biochemistry.. 1972; 11: 541-547Google Scholar) using in-house software as described previously (15Mavridou D.A. Stevens J.M. Ferguson S.J. Redfield C. J. Mol. Biol... 2007; 370: 643-658Google Scholar). The pKa value for Asp455 was determined from the pH dependence of five chemical shift values (Asp455/Glu468 1HN and 15N and Gln488 15Nϵ). The pKa value for Cys461 was determined from the pH dependence of four to six chemical shift values (Cys461/Cys464 1Hβ and 13Cβ). Errors in the pKa values were estimated as the standard deviation from the mean pKa value. Details of the parameters obtained in each fit are listed in supplemental Tables S1 and S2. In Vivo Studies of the Formation of an nDsbD-cDsbD Complex in Full-length DsbD—We have used a thrombin-cleavable variant of DsbD (Fig. 1A) to attempt to identify a mixed-disulfide complex of nDsbD and cDsbD in vivo. This construct expresses full-length DsbD in which nDsbD and cDsbD can each be cleaved from the transmembrane domain by virtue of engineered thrombin cleavage sites. The C464A mutation in cDsbD was introduced in an attempt to trap the nDsbD-cDsbD mixed-disulfide complex because Cys464 is believed to be responsible for driving the cleavage of the interdomain disulfide and the final transfer of reductant from cDsbD to nDsbD (12Rozhkova A. Stirnimann C.U. Frei P. Grauschopf U. Brunisholz R. Grutter M.G. Capitani G. Glockshuber R. EMBO J.. 2004; 23: 1709-1719Google Scholar). Thrombin-cleavable DsbD was expressed, purified, incubated with N-ethylmaleimide to alkylate its free thiols, incubated with thrombin, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with antibodies against the His6 tag and cDsbD; the results of the Western blotting are shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen in Fig. 2, lanes 6, 7, 14, and 15, that a band of the expected molecular weight for an nDsbD-cDsbD mixed disulfide (∼32 kDa) appeared after thrombin cleavage of thrombin-cleavable DsbD (box II). No band can be seen at this position before thrombin cleavage (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 13). The ∼32-kDa band disappears in the presence of reductant (Fig. 2, lanes 8 and 16), confirming that it is a covalent complex containing a disulfide bond. The ∼32-kDa covalent complex from the SDS-PAGE band was N-terminally sequenced, and both the nDsbD ((M)LFDAPGRSQ) and cDsbD (GSGQTHLNFT) termini were detected. As seen in Fig. 2, lanes 6 and 7 or 14 and 15, the band corresponding to the complex is present whether or not the free thiols of the protein were alkylated before thrombin cleavage. Incubation with N-ethylmaleimide, therefore demonstrates that this complex was formed before cleavage of the full-length protein. A band for the full-length thrombin-cleavable DsbD can be seen (at ∼49 kDa) even after thrombin cleavage (Fig. 2, lanes 6-8 and 14-16, box I); this is attributed to inefficient thrombin cleavage because of the presence of the detergent DDM in the protein solutions. It is also likely that the presence of the protein in the detergent micelle could reduce the accessibility of the protease cleavage sites to the thrombin (21Hiniker A. Vertommen D. Bardwell J.C. Collet J.F. J. Bacteriol... 2006; 188: 7317-7320Google Scholar). Moreover, a C464A-cDsbD band can be seen (at ∼14 kDa) after thrombin cleavage even in the absence of reductant (Fig. 2, lanes 6, 7, 14, and 15, box III). This is observed because there are molecules in the protein sample in which the nDsbD-cDsbD mixed disulfide had not formed and for which the thrombin cleavage led to release of the two separate periplasmic domains (isolated nDsbD cannot be seen in the Western blot because it is not His6-tagged). In Vivo Studies of Complex Formation between Isolated nDsbD and cDsbD—To assess the role of tmDsbD in mediating the interaction between nDsbD and cDsbD, the two periplasmic domains of DsbD, nDsbD bearing a C-terminal streptavidin tag and a C464A variant of cDsbD bearing a C-terminal His6 tag, were overexpressed simultaneously as soluble proteins exported to the periplasm. The C464A mutation in cDsbD was used for reasons described above. The periplasmic extract was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with antibodies against the streptavidin tag, to detect nDsbD, and against a penta-histidine sequence, to detect cDsbD. The nDsbD-cDsbD mixed disulfide is expected to migrate on SDS-PAGE between the 28- and 38-kDa molecular mass markers and to be detected by both antibodies (Fig. 3). No band corresponding to the nDsbD-cDsbD mixed disulfide was observed in Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 8. In Fig. 3, lane 4, only the nDsbD band at ∼17 kDa is observed, and in lane 8 the C464A-cDsbD band at ∼14 kDa and a band corresponding to its homodimer at ∼33 kDa (confirmed by Western blotting, not shown) are observed. A possible explanation for the failure of the nDsbD-cDsbD mixed-disulfide complex to form in vivo is that the proteins were present in the incorrect oxidation states for disulfide bond formation to occur; interdomain disulfide bond formation requires the presence of oxidized nDsbD and reduced C464A-cDsbD. NMR studies of periplasmically overexpressed nDsbD show that it is present predominantly in the oxidized form. cDsbD cannot form an intramolecular disulfide bond because it has a single cysteine and the homodimer is observed as only a minor species (Fig. 3, lane 8). For these reasons, attack of the cDsbD cysteine thiol on the disulfide of nDsbD, as occurs in the physiological pathway, should have been possible. We therefore conclude that a complex between soluble nDsbD and cDsbD, co-expressed in the E. coli periplasm, does not form in the absence of the transmembrane domain that usually connects the two domains in the full-length protein. NMR Analysis of the nDsbD-15N-cDsbD Mixed-disulfide Complex—A mixed-disulfide complex was produced using purified single-cysteine variants of nDsbD (C103A) and cDsbD (C464A) to ensure that the physiologically relevant disulfide was formed (Cys461-SS-Cys109), to avoid any cleavage of this disulfide because of the presence of Cys464 and to eliminate any complications during the pKa determination of Asp455 caused by the titration of the Cys464 or Cys103 thiols in the active site. NMR spectroscopy allows measurement of the pKa value of Asp455 in the active site of cDsbD when cDsbD is in close proximity to its periplasmic partner nDsbD. For this purpose we used uniformly 15N-labeled C464A-cDsbD covalently linked to unlabeled C103A-nDsbD, thus producing a C103A-nDsbD-15N-C464A-cDsbD covalent complex (subsequently referred to as nDsbD-15N-cDsbD) where only cDsbD gives NMR signals in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum but in which it is influenced by the presence of nDsbD. In this way we were able to simplify the NMR spectrum of a relatively large (∼32-kDa) protein complex and to focus on the domain of interest. Previous studies of isolated cDsbD were carried out at 298 K. The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the nDsbD-15N-cDsbD complex at 298 K is significantly broader, because of the higher molecular weight of the complex, than that of isolated cDsbD, and many of the expected peaks are not observed (supplemental Fig. S1, D and E). A significant improvement in the quality of the HSQC spectrum of the complex was observed at 313 K (supplemental Fig. S1F); at this temperature all expected peaks from cDsbD are observed. Both nDsbD and cDsbD have relatively high thermal stabilities and are completely folded and native at 313 K (supplemental Fig. S1B). The pH titration experiments described below were therefore performed at 313 K. pKa Determination for Asp455 in the nDsbD-15 N-cDsbD Complex—We have monitored, between pH 4 and pH 10, the 15N and 1HN chemical shifts of the backbone amides of Asp455 and Glu468 and the side chain 15Nϵ of Gln488 in HSQC spectra of the nDsbD-15N-cDsbD mixed-disulfide complex (Fig. 4A). These shifts are all sensitive to titration of Asp455 because of a hydrogen bond network involving Asp455, Glu468, and Gln488 (10Stirnimann C.U. Rozhkova A. Grauschopf U. Bockmann R.A. Glockshuber R.

https://openalex.org/W2037803378,"We demonstrate the reversibility of RecA-promoted strand exchange reaction between short oligonucleotides in the presence of adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate). The reverse reaction proceeds without the dissociation of RecA from DNA. The reaction reaches equilibrium and its yield depends on the homology between the reaction substrates. We estimate the tolerance of the RecA-promoted strand exchange to individual base substitutions for a comprehensive set of possible base combinations in a selected position along oligonucleotide substrates for strand exchange and find, in agreement with previously reported estimations, that this tolerance is higher than in the case of free DNA. It is demonstrated that the short oligonucleotide-based approach can be applied to the human recombinases Rad51 and Dmc1 when strand exchange is performed in the presence of calcium ions and ATP. Remarkably, despite the commonly held belief that the eukaryotic recombinases have an inherently lower strand exchange activity, in our system their efficiencies in strand exchange are comparable with that of RecA. Under our experimental conditions, the human recombinases exhibit a significantly higher tolerance to interruptions of homology due to point base substitutions than RecA. Finding conditions where a chemical reaction is reversible and reaches equilibrium is critically important for its thermodynamically correct description. We believe that the experimental system described here will substantially facilitate further studies on different aspects of the mechanisms of homologous recombination."
https://openalex.org/W1983238316,"Multiplexing technologies, which allow for simultaneous detection of multiple nucleic acid sequences in a single reaction, can save a lot of time, cost and labor compared to traditional single reaction detection methods. However, the multiplexing method currently used requires precise handiwork and many complicated steps, making a new, simpler technique desirable. Oligonucleotides containing locked nucleic acid residues are an attractive tool because they have strong affinities for their complementary targets, they have been used to avoid dimer formation and mismatch hybridization and to enhance efficient priming. In this study, we aimed to investigate the use of locked nucleic acid pentamers for genomic DNA amplification and multiplex genotyping.We designed locked nucleic acid pentamers as universal PCR primers for genomic DNA amplification. The locked nucleic acid pentamers were able to prime amplification of the selected sequences within the investigated genomes, and the resulting products were similar in length to those obtained by restriction digest. In Real Time PCR of genomic DNA from three bacterial species, locked nucleic acid pentamers showed high priming efficiencies. Data from bias tests demonstrated that locked nucleic acid pentamers have equal affinities for each of the six genes tested from the Klebsiella pneumoniae genome. Combined with suspension array genotyping, locked nucleic acid pentamer-based PCR amplification was able to identify a total of 15 strains, including 3 species of bacteria, by gene- and species-specific probes. Among the 32 species used in the assay, 28 species and 50 different genes were clearly identified using this method.As a novel genomic DNA amplification, the use of locked nucleic acid pentamers as universal primer pairs in conjunction with suspension array genotyping, allows for the identification of multiple distinct genes or species with a single amplification procedure. This demonstrates that locked nucleic acid pentamer-based PCR can be utilized extensively in pathogen identification."
https://openalex.org/W2020993696,"Background Alexithymia is a personality trait characterized by deficiency in understanding, processing, or describing emotions. Recent studies have revealed that alexithymia is associated with less activation of the anterior cingulate cortex, a brain region shown to play a role in cognitive and emotional processing. However, few studies have directly investigated the cognitive domain in relation to alexithymia to examine whether alexithymic trait is related to less efficient voluntary control. Methodology/ Principal Findings We examined the relationship between alexithymic trait and voluntary control in a group of healthy volunteers. We used the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) to measure alexithymic trait. Additionally, we examined state and trait voluntary control using the revised Attention Network Test (ANT-R) and the Adult Temperament Questionnaire (ATQ), respectively. Alexithymic trait was positively correlated with the overall reaction time of the ANT-R, and negatively correlated with the Effortful Control factor of the ATQ. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that alexithymic trait is associated with less efficient voluntary control."
https://openalex.org/W1979218095,"The first steps of poxvirus DNA synthesis yield concatemeric arrays of covalently linked genomes. The virus-encoded Holliday junction resolvase is required to process concatemers into unit-length genomes for packaging. Previous studies of the vaccinia virus resolvase have been problematic due to poor protein solubility. We found that fowlpox virus resolvase was much more tractable. Fowlpox resolvase formed complexes with a variety of branched DNA substrates, but not linear DNA, and had the highest affinity for a Holliday junction substrate, illustrating a previously unappreciated affinity for Holliday junctions over other substrates. The cleavage activity was monitored in fixed time assays, showing that, as with vaccinia resolvase, the fowlpox enzyme could cleave a wide array of branched DNA substrates. Single turnover kinetic analysis revealed the Holliday junction substrate was cleaved 90-fold faster than a splayed duplex substrate containing a single to double strand transition. Multiple turnover kinetic analysis, however, showed that the cleavage step was not limiting for the full reaction cycle. Cleavage by resolvase was also tightly coupled at symmetrical positions across the junction, and coupling required the complete Holliday junction structure. Last, we found that cleavage of an extruded cruciform yielded a product, which after treatment with ligase, had the properties expected for covalently closed DNA hairpin ends, as is seen for poxvirus genome monomers. These findings provide a tractable poxvirus resolvase usable for the development of small molecule inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2054656166,"Eye contact and pointing are typical gestures in order to direct another individual's attention toward a target. We previously investigated on Japanese monkeys whether joint attention ability encouraged by eye contact and pointing was associated with the imitation of human's actions. The monkeys with the joint attention skills showed the imitation of human's actions. In the current study, we investigated on a monkey whether joint attention ability also facilitated the imitation of human body-movements. Results showed that the monkey being taught eye contact and pointing showed the imitation of human body-movements. These results suggest that the monkeys have basic potential for following another individual's motion, and that what imitation expresses depends on where the monkeys are paying attention. Thus, eye contact and pointing are suitable for directing the monkey's attention toward the human."
https://openalex.org/W2110290069,"Since synaptic plasticity is regarded as a potential mechanism for memory formation and learning, there is growing interest in the study of its underlying mechanisms. Recently several evolutionary models of cellular development have been presented, but none have been shown to be able to evolve a range of biological synaptic plasticity regimes. In this paper we present a biologically plausible evolutionary cellular development model and test its ability to evolve different biological synaptic plasticity regimes. The core of the model is a genomic and proteomic regulation network which controls cells and their neurites in a 2D environment. The model has previously been shown to successfully evolve behaving organisms, enable gene related phenomena, and produce biological neural mechanisms such as temporal representations. Several experiments are described in which the model evolves different synaptic plasticity regimes using a direct fitness function. Other experiments examine the ability of the model to evolve simple plasticity regimes in a task -based fitness function environment. These results suggest that such evolutionary cellular development models have the potential to be used as a research tool for investigating the evolutionary aspects of synaptic plasticity and at the same time can serve as the basis for novel artificial computational systems."
