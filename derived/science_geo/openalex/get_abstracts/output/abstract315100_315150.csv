The Arctic spillover model, first proposed to explain the marine extinctions, would have caused a rapid and intense change in the earth's climate including a lowering of temperature and of precipitation. This change in climate may have triggered a series of ecological disasters that included the radical change in the distribution of vegetation on the earth as well as the extinction of the dinosaurs."

https://openalex.org/W2045441778,An experiment has been performed to measure directly the effect of atmospheric turbulence on spherical wave propagation of light on a vertical path. The results permit determination of the magnitude of the effect at a variety of locations and under different conditions. Agreement is found with the functional form predicted by the inertial theory of turbulence. General agreement is found with scattering data obtained by a low-frequency radar and with predictions of some turbulence profile models. The results also demonstrate some reasons for poor agreement with time integrating sensors.

On the other hand, when foreign substances are introduced into the blood stream, they either fail to reach the spinal fluid or reach it in small amounts. This apparently does not depend on diffusibility, since"
