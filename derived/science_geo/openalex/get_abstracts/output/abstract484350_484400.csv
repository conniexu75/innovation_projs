https://openalex.org/W2075902740,"Acoustically Isolated The control of sound transmission is desirable in a number of circumstances from noise suppression to imaging technologies. Fleury et al. (p. 516 ; see the cover; see the Perspective by Cummer ) studied a subwavelength acoustic meta-atom consisting of a resonant ring cavity biased by an internally circulating fluid. The direction of rotational flow of the fluid (air) changed the resonant properties of the ring cavity, allowing the propagation of sound waves within the cavity to be controlled. With several ports connected to the cavity, sound could be directed to a certain port while isolating transmission in another."

How their characteristics are extracted from acoustic speech input is not well understood. Directly recording from the superior temporal gyrus of patients as part of their clinical evaluation for epilepsy surgery, Mesgarani et al. (p. 1006 , published online 30 January; see the Perspective by Grodzinsky and Nelken ) investigated neural responses while the subjects listened to continuous speech. The findings reveal how both vowels and consonants of different phonetic categories are encoded."

Now, Jimenez et al. (p. 10.1126/science.1247136 , published online 30 January) propose a role for ESCRT proteins in wound repair at the plasma membrane. In vivo imaging, modeling, and electron microscopy were used to reveal how the ESCRTs participate in a rapid energy-independent, calcium-dependent, membrane-shedding process at the plasma membrane that reseals small wounds caused by toxins or laser treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2141408144,"Surveying Savannas Savannas are structurally similar across the three major continents where they occur, leading to the assumption that the factors controlling vegetation structure and function are broadly similar, too. Lehmann et al. (p. 548 ) report the results of an extensive analysis of ground-based tree abundance in savannas, sampled at more than 2000 sites in Africa, Australia, and South America. All savannas, independent of region, shared a common functional property in the way that moisture and fire regulated tree abundance. However, despite qualitative similarity in the moisture–fire–tree-biomass relationships among continents, key quantitative differences exist among the three regions, presumably as a result of unique evolutionary histories and climatic domains."

(p. 506 ; see the Perspective by Singleton ) investigated the underlying genetics of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), a human neurodegenerative disease, by sequencing the exomes of individuals with recessive neurological disorders. Loss-of-function gene mutations in both novel genes and genes previously implicated for this condition were identified, and several were functionally validated."
https://openalex.org/W2015254140,"Lung stem cells are instructed to produce lineage-specific progeny through unknown factors in their microenvironment. We used clonal 3D cocultures of endothelial cells and distal lung stem cells, bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs), to probe the instructive mechanisms. Single BASCs had bronchiolar and alveolar differentiation potential in lung endothelial cell cocultures. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments showed that BMP4-Bmpr1a signaling triggers calcineurin/NFATc1-dependent expression of thrombospondin-1 (Tsp1) in lung endothelial cells to drive alveolar lineage-specific BASC differentiation. Tsp1 null mice exhibited defective alveolar injury repair, confirming a crucial role for the BMP4-NFATc1-TSP1 axis in lung epithelial differentiation and regeneration in vivo. Discovery of this pathway points to methods to direct the derivation of specific lung epithelial lineages from multipotent cells. These findings elucidate a pathway that may be a critical target in lung diseases and provide tools to understand the mechanisms of respiratory diseases at the single-cell level."
https://openalex.org/W1999301366,"Genetic errors in meiosis can lead to birth defects and spontaneous abortions. Checkpoint mechanisms of hitherto unknown nature eliminate oocytes with unrepaired DNA damage, causing recombination-defective mutant mice to be sterile. Here, we report that checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2 or Chek2), is essential for culling mouse oocytes bearing unrepaired meiotic or induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Female infertility caused by a meiotic recombination mutation or irradiation was reversed by mutation of Chk2. Both meiotically programmed and induced DSBs trigger CHK2-dependent activation of TRP53 (p53) and TRP63 (p63), effecting oocyte elimination. These data establish CHK2 as essential for DNA damage surveillance in female meiosis and indicate that the oocyte DSB damage response primarily involves a pathway hierarchy in which ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) signals to CHK2, which then activates p53 and p63."

https://openalex.org/W2109490882,"The response to DNA damage, which regulates nuclear processes such as DNA repair, transcription, and cell cycle, has been studied thoroughly. However, the cytoplasmic response to DNA damage is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that DNA damage triggers dramatic reorganization of the Golgi, resulting in its dispersal throughout the cytoplasm. We further show that DNA-damage-induced Golgi dispersal requires GOLPH3/MYO18A/F-actin and the DNA damage protein kinase, DNA-PK. In response to DNA damage, DNA-PK phosphorylates GOLPH3, resulting in increased interaction with MYO18A, which applies a tensile force to the Golgi. Interference with the Golgi DNA damage response by depletion of DNA-PK, GOLPH3, or MYO18A reduces survival after DNA damage, whereas overexpression of GOLPH3, as is observed frequently in human cancers, confers resistance to killing by DNA-damaging agents. Identification of the DNA-damage-induced Golgi response reveals an unexpected pathway through DNA-PK, GOLPH3, and MYO18A that regulates cell survival following DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2043968267,"The Makings of a Choosy Pathogen The oomycete Phytophthora infestans is responsible for potato blight. A closely related pathogen afflicts the 4 o'clock flower. To assess why such similar pathogens are restricted to one host or the other, Dong et al. (p. 552 ; see the Perspective by Coaker ) analyzed similar effectors from both pathogens. The results suggest that the host specialization that led to evolutionary divergence depends on reciprocal single–amino acid changes that tailor the pathogen effector to a specific host protease that is being disabled. Thus, small changes can open the door for a pathogen to jump to another species of host and, itself, diversify into another species of pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W1984538868,"A Matter of Timing Plants flower only when their developmental programs give the go-ahead; otherwise floral genes remain repressed. Sun et al. ( 10.1126/science.1248559 ; see the Perspective by Zhang ) analyzed the regulatory program that controls expression of the transcription factor KNUCKLES (KNU), which is required in the control of floral genes. KNU expression was silenced by the presence of Polycomb group (PcG) proteins. The floral homeotic protein AGAMOUS competed for control of KNU and activated its expression, but with a 2-day lag time. Thus, eviction of PcG by activating DNA binding proteins can insert a lag time before a switch in gene expression takes place."
https://openalex.org/W2025890951,"Although interferon (IFN) signaling induces genes that limit viral infection, many pathogenic viruses overcome this host response. As an example, 2'-O methylation of the 5' cap of viral RNA subverts mammalian antiviral responses by evading restriction of Ifit1, an IFN-stimulated gene that regulates protein synthesis. However, alphaviruses replicate efficiently in cells expressing Ifit1 even though their genomic RNA has a 5' cap lacking 2'-O methylation. We show that pathogenic alphaviruses use secondary structural motifs within the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of their RNA to alter Ifit1 binding and function. Mutations within the 5'-UTR affecting RNA structural elements enabled restriction by or antagonism of Ifit1 in vitro and in vivo. These results identify an evasion mechanism by which viruses use RNA structural motifs to avoid immune restriction."
https://openalex.org/W2087541556,"Understanding the interaction between surfaces and their surroundings is crucial in many materials-science fields, such as catalysis, corrosion, and thin-film electronics, but existing characterization methods have not been capable of fully determining the structure of surfaces during dynamic processes, such as catalytic reactions, in a reasonable time frame. We demonstrate an x-ray-diffraction-based characterization method that uses high-energy photons (85 kiloelectron volts) to provide unexpected gains in data acquisition speed by several orders of magnitude and enables structural determinations of surfaces on time scales suitable for in situ studies. We illustrate the potential of high-energy surface x-ray diffraction by determining the structure of a palladium surface in situ during catalytic carbon monoxide oxidation and follow dynamic restructuring of the surface with subsecond time resolution."

https://openalex.org/W2082699771,"It has been shown that mature hepatocytes compensate tissue damages not only by proliferation and/or hypertrophy but also by conversion into cholangiocyte-like cells. We found that Sry HMG box protein 9-positive (Sox9(+)) epithelial cell adhesion molecule-negative (EpCAM(-)) hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α-positive (HNF4α(+)) biphenotypic cells showing hepatocytic morphology appeared near EpCAM(+) ductular structures in the livers of mice fed 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC)-containing diet. When Mx1-Cre:ROSA mice, which were injected with poly(I:C) to label mature hepatocytes, were fed with the DDC diet, we found LacZ(+)Sox9(+) cells near ductular structures. Although Sox9(+)EpCAM(-) cells adjacent to expanding ducts likely further converted into ductular cells, the incidence was rare. To know the cellular characteristics of Sox9(+)EpCAM(-) cells, we isolated them as GFP(+)EpCAM(-) cells from DDC-injured livers of Sox9-EGFP mice. Sox9(+)EpCAM(-) cells proliferated and could differentiate to functional hepatocytes in vitro. In addition, Sox9(+)EpCAM(-) cells formed cysts with a small central lumen in collagen gels containing Matrigel® without expressing EpCAM. These results suggest that Sox9(+)EpCAM(-) cells maintaining biphenotypic status can establish cholangiocyte-type polarity. Interestingly, we found that some of the Sox9(+) cells surrounded luminal spaces in DDC-injured liver while they expressed HNF4α. Taken together, we consider that in addition to converting to cholangiocyte-like cells, Sox9(+)EpCAM(-) cells provide luminal space near expanded ductular structures to prevent deterioration of the injuries and potentially supply new hepatocytes to repair damaged tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2109247985,"Modulation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) determines immune cell function. In this study, we investigated how hypercholesterolemia affects HSPC biology and atherosclerosis. Hypercholesterolemia induced loss of HSPC quiescence, characterized by increased proliferation and expression of cyclin B1, C1, and D1, and a decreased expression of Rb, resulting in a 3.6- fold increase in the number of HSPCs in hypercholesterolemic Ldlr-/- mice. Competitive bone marrow (BM) transplantations showed that a hypercholesterolemic BM microenvironment activates HSPCs and skews their development toward myeloid lineages. Conversely, hypercholesterolemia-primed HSPCs acquired an enhanced propensity to generate myeloid cells, especially granulocytes and Ly6Chigh monocytes, even in a normocholesterolemic BM microenvironment. In conformity, macrophages differentiated from hypercholesterolemia-primed HSPCs produced 17.0% more TNF-α, 21.3% more IL-6, and 10.5% more MCP1 than did their normocholesterolemic counterparts. Hypercholesterolemia-induced priming of HSPCs generated leukocytes that more readily migrated into the artery, which resulted in a 2.1-fold increase in atherosclerotic plaque size. In addition, these plaques had a more advanced phenotype and exhibited a 1.2-fold increase in macrophages and 1.8-fold increase in granulocytes. These results identify hypercholesterolemia-induced activation and priming of HSPCs as a novel pathway in the development of atherosclerosis. Inhibition of this proinflammatory differentiation pathway on the HSPC level has the potential to reduce atherosclerosis.—Seijkens, T., Hoeksema, M.

https://openalex.org/W2003306507,"Among adolescents, overweight, obesity and metabolic syndrome are rapidly increasing in recent years as a consequence of unhealthy palatable diets. Animal models of diet-induced obesity have been developed, but little is known about the behavioural patterns produced by the consumption of such diets. The aim of the present study was to determine the behavioural and biochemical effects of a cafeteria diet fed to juvenile male and female rats, as well as to evaluate the possible recovery from these effects by administering standard feeding during the last week of the study. Two groups of male and female rats were fed with either a standard chow diet (ST) or a cafeteria (CAF) diet from weaning and for 8 weeks. A third group of males (CAF withdrawal) was fed with the CAF diet for 7 weeks and the ST in the 8th week. Both males and females developed metabolic syndrome as a consequence of the CAF feeding, showing overweight, higher adiposity and liver weight, increased plasma levels of glucose, insulin and triglycerides, as well as insulin resistance, in comparison with their respective controls. The CAF diet reduced motor activity in all behavioural tests, enhanced exploration, reduced anxiety-like behaviour and increased social interaction; this last effect was more pronounced in females than in males. When compared to animals only fed with a CAF diet, CAF withdrawal increased anxiety in the open field, slightly decreased body weight, and completely recovered the liver weight, insulin sensitivity and the standard levels of glucose, insulin and triglycerides in plasma. In conclusion, a CAF diet fed to young animals for 8 weeks induced obesity and metabolic syndrome, and produced robust behavioural changes in young adult rats, whereas CAF withdrawal in the last week modestly increased anxiety, reversed the metabolic alterations and partially reduced overweight."
https://openalex.org/W2137885656,"Brown macroalgae represent an ideal source for complex polysaccharides that can be utilized as precursors for cellulosic biofuels. The lack of recalcitrant lignin components in macroalgae polysaccharide reserves provides a facile route for depolymerization of constituent polysaccharides into simple monosaccharides. The most abundant sugars in macroalgae are alginate, mannitol, and glucan, and although several classes of enzymes that can catabolize the latter two have been characterized, studies of alginate-depolymerizing enzymes have lagged. Here, we present several crystal structures of Alg17c from marine bacterium Saccharophagus degradans along with structure-function characterization of active site residues that are suggested to be involved in the exolytic mechanism of alginate depolymerization. This represents the first structural and biochemical characterization of a family 17 polysaccharide lyase enzyme. Despite the lack of appreciable sequence conservation, the structure and β-elimination mechanism for glycolytic bond cleavage by Alg17c are similar to those observed for family 15 polysaccharide lyases and other lyases. This work illuminates the evolutionary relationships among enzymes within this unexplored class of polysaccharide lyases and reinforces the notion of a structure-based hierarchy in the classification of these enzymes.

The increasing cost and limited reserve of fossil fuels have resulted in massive efforts in fields of research aimed at the discovery of efficient sources of renewable energy (1.Lee S.J. Lee S.J. Lee D.W. Design and development of synthetic microbial platform cells for bioenergy.Front. Microbiol. 2013; 4: 92Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Over the past decade, massive resources have been invested in the optimization of methods for extracting ethanolic precursors from terrestrial biomass, such as corn and perennial grasses (2.Martin M.A. First generation biofuels compete.New Biotechnol. 2010; 27: 596-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Comparatively, less effort has been directed toward the bioprocessing of marine algal biomass, which has shown potential as a replacement for land-based plant materials (3.Hu G. Ji S. Yu Y. Wang S. Zhou G. Li F. Organisms for biofuel production: natural bioresources and methodologies for improving their biosynthetic potentials.Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 2013; https://doi.org/10.1007/10_2013_245Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Red, brown, and green algae contain an abundance of polysaccharide-derived sugars and, because of tolerance of changes in climate or soil conditions, represent the most sustainable source for fermentative biofuels (4.Markou G. Angelidaki I. Georgakakis D. Microalgal carbohydrates: an overview of the factors influencing carbohydrates production, and of main bioconversion technologies for production of biofuels.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2012; 96: 631-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Moreover, large scale cultivation of algae can be carried out in controlled environments, such as photo bioreactors. The unique carbohydrate composition of algae presents a formative challenge for bioprocessing (5.Blanch H.W. Bioprocessing for biofuels.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2012; 23: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As a consequence, there has been increasing interest in the discovery and development of enzymes that can depolymerize algal polysaccharides into fermentable monomeric sugars. The most widely distributed component of brown algae is alginate, a cell wall polysaccharide composed of polymeric blocks of α-(1,4) O-linked β-d-mannuronate (M) 2The abbreviations used are: Mβ-d-mannuronateGα-l-guluronatePLpolysaccharide lyaser.m.s.d.root mean square deviation. and its C5 epimer α-l-guluronate (G). These monosaccharides can form homopolymeric blocks of G residues (G blocks) or M residues (M blocks) or heteropolymers of alternating M and G (MG blocks). Depolymerization of alginate is catalyzed by diverse alginate lyases, which target the 1→4 O-linkage via β-elimination of the 4-O-glycosidic bond (6.Wong T.Y. Preston L.A. Schiller N.L. Alginate lyase: review of major sources and enzyme characteristics, structure-function analysis, biological roles, and applications.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 289-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Endotype alginate lyases, such as A1-I, A1-II, and A1-III from Sphingomonas sp. A1, depolymerize alginate into di-, tri-, and tetrasaccharides, which are then further processed by an exotype alginate lyase to yield monosaccharides that further undergo non-enzymatic conversion into 4-deoxy-l-erythro-5-hexoseulose uronic acid (Fig. 1). Within the Carbohydrate-Active EnZymes (CAZy) database (7.Cantarel B.L. Coutinho P.M. Rancurel C. Bernard T. Lombard V. Henrissat B. The Carbohydrate-Active EnZymes database (CAZy): an expert resource for glycogenomics.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D233-D238Crossref PubMed Scopus (4114) Google Scholar), alginate lyases are categorized into one of 21 different polysaccharide lyase (PL) families, and exotype activity has been experimentally determined for the PL15 and PL17 families of enzymes (8.Lombard V.

J. 2010; 432: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, there is limited conservation of primary sequence between PL15 and PL17 family enzymes with less than 15% sequence identity between representative family members. In addition, PL17 enzymes lack nearly all the requisite catalytic and functionally critical residues identified through structural and biochemical studies of the PL15 enzyme Atu3025 from Agrobacterium tumefaciens (9.Ochiai A. Yamasaki M. Mikami B. Hashimoto W. Murata K. Crystal structure of exotype alginate lyase Atu3025 from Agrobacterium tumefaciens.J. Biol.

To date, there is no structural or biochemical characterization of any PL17 family member. β-d-mannuronate α-l-guluronate polysaccharide lyase root mean square deviation. The marine bacterium Saccharophagus degradans 2-40 has been shown to degrade several complex polysaccharides, including alginate, and bioinformatics analysis of its genome identifies nine putative alginate lyases belonging to PL families 7, 14, 17, and 18 (10.Weiner R.M. Taylor 2nd, L.E. Henrissat B. Hauser L. Land M. Coutinho P.M. Rancurel C. Saunders E.H. Longmire A.G. Zhang H. Bayer E.A. Gilbert H.J. Larimer F. Zhulin I.B. Ekborg N.A. Lamed R. Richardson P.M.

Complete genome sequence of the complex carbohydrate-degrading marine bacterium, Saccharophagus degradans strain 2-40 T.PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e1000087Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Biochemical characterization of the S. degradans PL17 enzyme (Alg17c) demonstrates that this exotype enzyme can depolymerize alginate di-, tri-, and tetrasaccharides into monosaccharides, providing the necessary precursor for ethanol fermentation (11.Kim H.T. Chung J.H. Wang D. Lee J. Woo H.C. Choi I.G. Kim K.H. Depolymerization of alginate into a monomeric sugar acid using Alg17C, an exo-oligoalginate lyase cloned from Saccharophagus degradans 2-40.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2012; 93: 2233-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, given the lack of sequence similarity with PL15 and lack of conservation of active site features, little is known about the mechanism of any PL17 family enzyme. Given that there are 77 different polypeptides that are annotated as PL17 family members in the CAZy database (8.Lombard V. Bernard T. Rancurel C. Brumer H. Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. A hierarchical classification of polysaccharide lyases for glycogenomics.Biochem. J. 2010; 432: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), the structure and mechanism of a representative PL17 family enzyme should provide an understanding of the basis for alginate depolymerization. Here, we present several crystal structures of the PL17 enzyme Alg17c from S. degradans, including the wild-type enzyme (to 1.85-Å resolution), two active site variants (to 1.7- and 2.45-Å resolution), and the co-crystal structure of an inactive variant in complex with an alginate trisaccharide (to 1.9-Å resolution). Structure-guided analysis of several active site variants allowed identification of residues that are critical for substrate recognition and for the basis of the exolytic reaction mechanism of PL17 enzymes. S. degradans 2-40 genomic DNA was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. Low viscosity alginate was purchased from MP Biomedicals. Protein molecular weight markers for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) were obtained from Bio-Rad. All other reagents were purchased from Fisher Scientific and were of the highest purity available. Alginate oligosaccharides were generated by enzymatic depolymerization of low viscosity alginate using alginate lyase from Flavobacterium multivorum (Sigma CAS 40591-57-9). Briefly, 150 μl of enzyme at a concentration of 1 unit/ml was added to a solution containing 0.1% sodium alginate at pH 6.3, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Reaction mixtures containing up to 20 mg of digested polysaccharides were loaded onto a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column (2.8 × 20 cm), which was equilibrated with 25 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.8. A gradient from the equilibration buffer to 1 m NH4OAc over 1 ml/min with a flow rate of 5 ml/min was used for separation at room temperature. Fractions containing digestion products were identified from their absorbance at 235 nm. Oligosaccharides were desalted using a BioGel P-2 column (1.5 × 50 cm) equilibrated with 1 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. Samples were then further purified using a Hypercarb column (100 × 3 mm) on an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC system. The solvent flow rate was 0.3 ml/min with a temperature of 65 °C. The products were eluted using the following gradient where solvent A is 0.2% TFA in water and solvent B is methanol: 30% B from 0 to 10 min and gradient from 30 to 90% B from 10 to 40 min. The final products were lyophilized, and masses for the lyophilized products were determined using an Agilent 1100 LC/MSD Trap XCT Plus mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Amplification of Alg17c (GenBankTM accession number ABD82539.1) from S. degradans genomic DNA was done using PCR, and the resultant insert was cloned into pET-28b. To facilitate heterologous expression, the expression construct lacks the first 24 residues that encode the signal peptide. Site-specific mutations in the coding sequence were carried out using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). The PCR product (12.5 μl) was digested with methylation-dependent restriction enzyme DpnI at 37 °C for 8 h to digest the parental plasmid DNA. Escherichia coli DH-5α competent cells were transformed with the product from the DpnI restriction digestion and plated onto lysogeny broth (LB) solidified with Bacto agar (Difco) containing 25 μg/ml kanamycin sodium salt, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C overnight. Individual colonies were cultivated in LB medium supplemented with kanamycin until stationary phase was reached, and plasmids were extracted using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The integrity of all of the constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing (W. M. Keck Center for Comparative and Functional Genomics, University of Illinois). E. coli BL21-(DE3)-Rosetta cells harboring a recombinant plasmid bearing either the Al17c gene or variants were cultured in LB containing 25 μg/ml kanamycin for ∼12 h at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. Gene expression was induced when the absorbance at 600 nm reached ≈0.5 with the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the temperature was decreased to 16 °C followed by incubation for an additional 16 h at 200 rpm. Cell pellets were harvested from the cultures by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, washed with 10 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris, 300 mm KCl, pH 7.5), and frozen as cell pellets at −80 °C. Preparation of selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled Alg17c was carried out by repression of methionine synthesis in defined media (12.Doublié S. Production of selenomethionyl proteins in prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems.Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 363: 91-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Frozen cell pellets were thawed, resuspended in 35 ml of ice-cold binding buffer, and passed through an EmulsiFlex C-3 homogenizer (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada) to rupture the cells. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant containing the soluble fraction was loaded onto a 5-ml immobilized metal ion affinity resin column (Hi-Trap nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid, GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm KCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.5). The column was extensively washed with lysis buffer supplemented with 30 mm imidazole and eluted by a linear gradient to 200 mm imidazole. The polyhistidine affinity tag was removed by overnight incubation with thrombin (1 unit/mg of protein). Samples were concentrated using a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff Amicon centrifugal filters and further purified using size exclusion chromatography (Superdex HiloadTM 75 16/60, GE Healthcare) in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl buffer. Crystals of wild-type, SeMet-labeled, and variant Alg17c were grown by the hanging drop method. 15 mg/ml protein was incubated in a condition containing 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, 5% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 10% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 over the course of 3 days at 16 °C. Crystals were soaked in a solution containing 20% PEG 6000, 12% ethylene glycol, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, 5% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Flash cooled crystals of wild-type Alg17c diffracted x-rays to 1.85-Å resolution using a Mar 300 charge-coupled device detector at an insertion device synchrotron beam line (LS-CAT Sector 21 ID-G, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne, IL). These crystals belong to space group P21 with unit cell parameters a = 85.5 Å, b = 126.4 Å, c = 87.6 Å, and β = 111.5° with two molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. A 3-fold redundant data set was collected to 1.85-Å resolution with an overall Rmerge of 9.2% and I/σ(I) of 2.1 in the highest resolution shell. All data were indexed and scaled using either the HKL2000 (13.Otwinowski Z. Borek D. Majewski W. Minor W. Multiparametric scaling of diffraction intensities.Acta Crystallogr.

Open table in a new tab Kinetic characterization was carried out on wild-type Alg17c as well as the variants H202L and Y258A using low viscosity alginate as the substrate. For each assay, 0.613 μm enzyme was added to 1 ml of mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and varying concentrations of substrate (0.1–10 mg/ml). The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h and then boiled for 5 min to stop the reaction, and the thiobarbituric acid assay method was used to quantify the amount of unsaturated uronic acids produced. Briefly, 40 μl of the reaction mixture was added to 0.25 ml of 5 mm H5IO6 (in 62.5 mm H2SO4) and incubated at room temperature for 20 min followed by the addition of 0.50 ml of 2% sodium arsenite to the mixture and incubation for 2 min with vigorous shaking. 2 ml of 0.3% thiobarbituric acid at pH 2 was then added, and the mixture was heated to 100 °C for 10 min. After cooling, the resultant condensation of β-formylpyruvic acid with thiobarbituric acid was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 548 nm. 1 unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount required to liberate 1 μm β-formylpyruvic acid/min. Alginate oligosaccharides with degrees of polymerization of 2, 3, and 4 (0.5 mg/ml) were incubated with 0.6 μm Alg17c in a buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 at 30 °C for 1 h. Reaction products were analyzed by TLC using a solvent of n-butyl alcohol:formic acid:water (4:6:1, v/v/v). The depolymerized products were visualized by developing the plates with 10% (v/v) sulfuric acid in ethanol followed by incubation at 100 °C for 20 min. Standards consisted of either d-glucose (2 mm) monosaccharide or d-trehalose (2 mm) disaccharide. The MicroCal VP-ITC system from GE Healthcare was used to calculate dissociation constants for the binding of oligosaccharide to catalytically inactive Alg17c. Purified enzyme was concentrated to 15 mg/ml and diluted in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl buffer. Oligosaccharide with a degree of polymerization between 2 and 4 was diluted in the same buffer to ∼1 mm. Both Alg17c and substrate were degassed and brought to room temperature. The reference cell contained deionized water, and the sample chamber was washed with deionized water and methanol before the sample was injected. The protein sample (in a 1.44-ml reaction cell) was injected with 26 successive 10-μl aliquots of ligand at 300-s intervals. Data were fitted by nonlinear regression using a single site model (MicroCal Origin). To facilitate heterologous expression, the first 24 residues encoding the signal peptide were not included for any of the expression constructs. Determination of the kinetic parameters for degradation of low viscosity alginate by Alg17c was carried out using the thiobarbituric acid assay method (Table 2). Wild-type Alg17c was shown to have a kcat of 56.9 s−1, kcat/Km of 2.6 × 106 m−1 s−1, Km of 22.3 μm, and Vmax of 34.9 μm s−1. These parameters are well within the range of values for enzymes from other polysaccharide lyase classes and are also similar to values reported for other alginate lyases, including AlgL from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.Farrell E.K. Tipton P.A. Functional characterization of AlgL, an alginate lyase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 10259-10266Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and Atu3025 from A. tumefaciens (9.Ochiai A.

Treatment of a mixture containing oligosaccharides with degrees of polymerization of 2, 3, and 4 resulted in complete processing only of the tri- and tetrasaccharide substrates. In contrast, the disaccharide substrate was only partially processed. These results are consistent with Alg17c having a minimal polymer specificity of 3. Kinetic analysis of wild-type Alg17c using a trisaccharide substrate yielded a kcat of 62.4 s−1, kcat/Km of 8.2 × 106 m−1 s−1, Km of 7.7 μm, and Vmax of 38.2 μm s−1. These kinetic values are similar to those determined using heteropolymeric low viscosity alginate as a substrate, consistent with the notion that an alginate trisaccharide represents the minimal length substrate for Alg17c. The structure of wild-type Alg17c was determined to 1.85-Å resolution using phases determined by single wavelength anomalous diffraction measurements collected using crystals of SeMet-labeled protein (relevant data collection statistics are provided in Table 1). In each of the structures, no electron density can be observed for the first 6 residues at the amino terminus, and no effort was made to model these residues. The final model for each of the structures consists of all residues spanning His30–Arg734. The overall architecture of each Alg17c monomer consists of two domains: an amino-terminal imperfect α-barrel (consisting of residues His30–Glu365) and the carboxyl-terminal β-sheet domain (composed of residues Pro370–Arg735) (Fig. 2, A and B). There are 13 helices in the amino-terminal domain, resulting in a topological arrangement that is similar to an α6/α6-barrel but with an extra helix that buttresses against the side of the barrel. The arrangement of the α6/α6-helices produces an open barrel structure, and this additional helix serves to maintain rigidity of the barrel. The carboxyl-terminal domain is composed of three co-planar layers of antiparallel β-strands arranged as sheets and further supported by four small helices near the top layer that interject between the two domains (Fig. 2, A and B). Sequence conservation among other PL17 family members extends throughout all of the secondary structural elements (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the Alg17c structure is representative of all PL17 enzymes. In contrast, all of the alginate lyases in nearly all other PL families adopt either an α-barrel or a jelly roll fold (8.Lombard V. Bernard T. Rancurel C. Brumer H. Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. A hierarchical classification of polysaccharide lyases for glycogenomics.Biochem. J. 2010; 432: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), which is distinct from the combination of the α6/α6-barrel and antiparallel β-sheet arrangement observed in the PL17 structure. The general domain structure observed in Alg17c is reminiscent of that observed in the structure of the PL15 family enzyme Atu3205 from A. tumefaciens (Protein Data Bank code 3A0O) (9.Ochiai A. Yamasaki M. Mikami B. Hashimoto W. Murata K. Crystal structure of exotype alginate lyase Atu3025 from Agrobacterium tumefaciens.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 24519-24528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although the two enzymes are topologically distinct as evidenced by an r.m.s.d. value of 3.4 Å upon least square alignment of 567 Cα atoms, the PL15 family Atu3205 also consists of an α6/α6-barrel joined to a carboxyl-terminal antiparallel β-sheet. A recent structure-based classification of polysaccharide lyases terms this topological class as that of a multidomain (α/α)n toroid (Fig. 3) (24.Garron M.L. Cygler M. Structural and mechanistic classification of uronic acid-containing polysaccharide lyases.Glycobiology. 2010; 20: 1547-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A"

The chordotonal organs, which have similarities to the mammalian ear, were also required for sensation of a vibration stimulus and its effects on the endogenous brain clock. The chordotonal organs, present in the joints of the limbs, provide neuronal signals that allow the animal to sense its position or posture—and thus might mediate feedback of a range of behaviors onto the endogenous biological clock."
https://openalex.org/W2028385156,"Muscle represents an abundant, accessible, and replenishable source of adult stem cells. Skeletal muscle-derived stem cells, called satellite cells, play essential roles in regeneration after muscle injury in adult skeletal muscle. Although the molecular mechanism of muscle regeneration process after an injury has been extensively investigated, the regulation of satellite cells under steady state during the adult stage, including the reaction to exercise stimuli, is relatively unknown. Here, we show that voluntary wheel running exercise, which is a low stress exercise, converts satellite cells to the activated state due to accelerated Wnt signaling. Our analysis showed that up-regulated canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling directly modulated chromatin structures of both MyoD and Myf5 genes, resulting in increases in the mRNA expression of Myf5 and MyoD and the number of proliferative Pax7(+)Myf5(+) and Pax7(+) MyoD(+) cells in skeletal muscle. The effect of Wnt signaling on the activation of satellite cells, rather than Wnt-mediated fibrosis, was observed in both adult and aged mice. The association of β-catenin, T-cell factor, and lymphoid enhancer transcription factors of multiple T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor regulatory elements, conserved in mouse, rat, and human species, with the promoters of both the Myf5 and MyoD genes drives the de novo myogenesis in satellite cells even in aged muscle. These results indicate that exercise-stimulated extracellular Wnts play a critical role in the regulation of satellite cells in adult and aged skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2044388785,"Sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors are central regulators of cellular lipogenesis. Release of membrane-bound SREBP requires SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) to escort SREBP from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi for cleavage by site-1 and site-2 proteases. SCAP then recycles to the ER for additional rounds of SREBP binding and transport. Mechanisms regulating ER-to-Golgi transport of SCAP-SREBP are understood in molecular detail, but little is known about SCAP recycling. Here, we have demonstrated that SCAP Golgi-to-ER transport requires cleavage of SREBP at site-1. Reductions in SREBP cleavage lead to SCAP degradation in lysosomes, providing additional negative feedback control to the SREBP pathway. Current models suggest that SREBP plays a passive role prior to cleavage. However, we show that SREBP actively prevents premature recycling of SCAP-SREBP until initiation of SREBP cleavage. SREBP regulates SCAP in human cells and yeast, indicating that this is an ancient regulatory mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2010710724,"Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) is an α-arrestin family member involved in redox sensing and metabolic control. Growing evidence links TXNIP to mitochondrial function, but the molecular nature of this relationship has remained poorly defined. Herein, we employed targeted metabolomics and comprehensive bioenergetic analyses to evaluate oxidative metabolism and respiratory kinetics in mouse models of total body (TKO) and skeletal muscle-specific (TXNIP(SKM-/-)) Txnip deficiency. Compared with littermate controls, both TKO and TXNIP(SKM-/-) mice had reduced exercise tolerance in association with muscle-specific impairments in substrate oxidation. Oxidative insufficiencies in TXNIP null muscles were not due to perturbations in mitochondrial mass, the electron transport chain, or emission of reactive oxygen species. Instead, metabolic profiling analyses led to the discovery that TXNIP deficiency causes marked deficits in enzymes required for catabolism of branched chain amino acids, ketones, and lactate, along with more modest reductions in enzymes of β-oxidation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The decrements in enzyme activity were accompanied by comparable deficits in protein abundance without changes in mRNA expression, implying dysregulation of protein synthesis or stability. Considering that TXNIP expression increases in response to starvation, diabetes, and exercise, these findings point to a novel role for TXNIP in coordinating mitochondrial fuel switching in response to nutrient availability."
https://openalex.org/W2128779436,"Dysregulated expression of histone methyltransferases and demethylases is an emerging epigenetic mechanism underlying cancer development and metastasis. We recently showed that the histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) demethylase KDM2A (also called FBXL11 and JHDM1A) is necessary for tumorigenic and metastatic capabilities of KDM2A-overexpressing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Here, we report that KDM2A transcriptionally represses the histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) gene by removing methyl groups from dimethylated H3K36 at the HDAC3 promoter in KDM2A-overexpressing NSCLC cells. KDM2A depletion reduced expression levels of cell cycle-associated genes (e.g. CDK6) and cell invasion-related genes (e.g. NANOS1); these levels were rescued by ectopic expression of KDM2A but not its catalytic mutant. These genes were occupied and down-regulated by HDAC3. HDAC3 knockdown significantly recovered the proliferation and invasiveness of KDM2A-depleted NSCLC cells as well as the levels of CDK6 and NANOS1 expression in these cells. Similar to their previously reported functions in other cell types, CDK6 and NANOS1 were required for the proliferation and invasion, respectively, of KDM2A-overexpressing NSCLC cells. In a mouse xenograft model, HDAC3 depletion substantially restored the tumorigenic ability of KDM2A knockdown cells. These findings reveal a novel cancer-epigenetic pathway in which the antagonistic effect of KDM2A on HDAC3 expression releases cell cycle-associated genes and cell invasion-related genes from HDAC3 repression and indicate the importance of this pathway for tumorigenicity and invasiveness of KDM2A-overexpressing NSCLC cells."
https://openalex.org/W2026335686,"Glutaredoxin-1 (Glrx) is a cytosolic enzyme that regulates diverse cellular function by removal of GSH adducts from S-glutathionylated proteins including signaling molecules and transcription factors. Glrx is up-regulated during inflammation and diabetes, and Glrx overexpression inhibits VEGF-induced EC migration. The aim was to investigate the role of up-regulated Glrx in EC angiogenic capacities and in vivo revascularization in the setting of hind limb ischemia. Glrx-overexpressing EC from Glrx transgenic (TG) mice showed impaired migration and network formation and secreted higher levels of soluble VEGF receptor 1 (sFlt), an antagonizing factor to VEGF. After hind limb ischemia surgery Glrx TG mice demonstrated impaired blood flow recovery, associated with lower capillary density and poorer limb motor function compared with wild type littermates. There were also higher levels of anti-angiogenic sFlt expression in the muscle and plasma of Glrx TG mice after surgery. Noncanonical Wnt5a is known to induce sFlt. Wnt5a was highly expressed in ischemic muscles and EC from Glrx TG mice, and exogenous Wnt5a induced sFlt expression and inhibited network formation in human microvascular EC. Adenoviral Glrx-induced sFlt in EC was inhibited by a competitive Wnt5a inhibitor. Furthermore, Glrx overexpression removed GSH adducts on p65 in ischemic muscle and EC and enhanced NF-κB activity, which was responsible for Wnt5a-sFlt induction. Taken together, up-regulated Glrx induces sFlt in EC via NF-κB-dependent Wnt5a, resulting in attenuated revascularization in hind limb ischemia. The Glrx-induced sFlt explains part of the mechanism of redox-regulated VEGF signaling."

Here we report that Wnt/β-catenin enhances iPSCs induction at the early stage of reprogramming. The augmented reprogramming induced by β-catenin is not due to increased total cell population or activation of c-Myc. In addition, β-catenin interacts with reprogramming factors Klf4, Oct4, and Sox2, further enhancing expression of pluripotency circuitry genes. These studies reveal novel mechanisms underlying the regulation of reprogramming somatic cells to pluripotency by Wnt/β-catenin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2080495115,"Cluster of differentiation 166 (CD166 or Alcam) is a cell surface molecule that can be greatly induced in liver cancer cells after serum deprivation, suggesting its role in influencing cell survival. However, whether and how CD166 acts as an anti-apoptotic regulator needs to be further investigated. Here, we report that gene silencing of CD166 promoted apoptosis via down-regulation of Bcl-2 in liver cancer cells. PI3K/AKT signaling was found to up-regulate CD166 expression independently of transcription. We also revealed that CD166 promoted both AKT expression and activity, thus providing a novel positive regulatory feedback between PI3K/AKT signaling and CD166. Moreover, Yes-associated protein (YAP) was identified as a CD166 downstream effecter, which can partly rescue CD166 knockdown-induced apoptosis and reduced in vivo cancer cell growth. Mechanically, CD166 modulated YAP expression and activity through at least two different ways, transcriptional regulation of YAP through cAMP-response element-binding protein and post-transcriptional control of YAP stability through inhibition to AMOT130. We also showed that CD9 enhanced CD166-mediated regulation of YAP via a mechanism involving facilitating CD166-CD166 homophilic interaction. Tissue microarray analysis revealed that CD166 and YAP were up-regulated and closely correlated in liver cancer samples, demonstrating the importance of their relationship. Taken together, this work summarizes a novel link between CD166 and YAP, explores the interplay among related important signaling pathways, and may lead to more effective therapeutic strategies for liver cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2025844590,"Regular exercise as an effective non-pharmacological antihypertensive therapy is beneficial for prevention and control of hypertension, but the central mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we hypothesized that chronic exercise training (ExT) delays the progression of hypertension and attenuates cardiac hypertrophy by up-regulating anti-inflammatory cytokines, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines (PICs) and restoring the neurotransmitters balance in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In addition, we also investigated the involvement of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 and NAD(P)H oxidase in exercise-induced effects.Moderate-intensity ExT was administrated to young normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and SHR rats for 16 weeks. SHR rats had a significant increase in mean arterial pressure and cardiac hypertrophy. SHR rats also had higher levels of glutamate, norepinephrine (NE), phosphorylated IKKβ, NF-κB p65 activity, NAD(P)H oxidase subunit gp91(phox), PICs and the monocyte chemokine protein-1 (MCP-1), and lower levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) in the PVN. These SHR rats also exhibited higher renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA), and higher plasma levels of PICs, and lower plasma IL-10. However, ExT ameliorates all these changes in SHR rats.These findings suggest that there are the imbalances between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters and between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the PVN of SHR rats, which at least partly contributing to sympathoexcitation, hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy; chronic exercise training attenuates hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy by restoring the balances between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters and between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the PVN; NF-κB and oxidative stress in the PVN may be involved in these exercise-induced effects."

The crystal structures of several α-l-arabinofuranosidases have been determined, although the structures, catalytic mechanisms, and substrate specificities of GH62 enzymes remain unclear. To evaluate the substrate specificity of a GH62 enzyme, we determined the crystal structure of α-l-arabinofuranosidase, which comprises a carbohydrate-binding module family 13 domain at its N terminus and a catalytic domain at its C terminus, from Streptomyces coelicolor. The catalytic domain was a five-bladed β-propeller consisting of five radially oriented anti-parallel β-sheets. Sugar complex structures with l-arabinose, xylotriose, and xylohexaose revealed five subsites in the catalytic cleft and an l-arabinose-binding pocket at the bottom of the cleft. The entire structure of this GH62 family enzyme was very similar to that of glycoside hydrolase 43 family enzymes, and the catalytically important acidic residues found in family 43 enzymes were conserved in GH62. Mutagenesis studies revealed that Asp202 and Glu361 were catalytic residues, and Trp270, Tyr461, and Asn462 were involved in the substrate-binding site for discriminating the substrate structures. In particular, hydrogen bonding between Asn462 and xylose at the nonreducing end subsite +2 was important for the higher activity of substituted arabinofuranosyl residues than that for terminal arabinofuranoses. α-l-Arabinofuranosidase, which belongs to the glycoside hydrolase family 62 (GH62), hydrolyzes arabinoxylan but not arabinan or arabinogalactan.

Sugar complex structures with l-arabinose, xylotriose, and xylohexaose revealed five subsites in the catalytic cleft and an l-arabinose-binding pocket at the bottom of the cleft. The entire structure of this GH62 family enzyme was very similar to that of glycoside hydrolase 43 family enzymes, and the catalytically important acidic residues found in family 43 enzymes were conserved in GH62. Mutagenesis studies revealed that Asp202 and Glu361 were catalytic residues, and Trp270, Tyr461, and Asn462 were involved in the substrate-binding site for discriminating the substrate structures. In particular, hydrogen bonding between Asn462 and xylose at the nonreducing end subsite +2 was important for the higher activity of substituted arabinofuranosyl residues than that for terminal arabinofuranoses."
https://openalex.org/W2050555170,"PCR-ribotyping is a broadly used method for the classification of isolates of Clostridium difficile, an emerging intestinal pathogen, causing infections with increased disease severity and incidence in several European and North American countries. We have now carried out clustering analysis with selected genes of numerous C. difficile strains as well as gene content comparisons of their genomes in order to broaden our view of the relatedness of strains assigned to different ribotypes. We analyzed the genomic content of 48 C. difficile strains representing 21 different ribotypes. The calculation of distance matrix-based dendrograms using the neighbor joining method for 14 conserved genes (standard phylogenetic marker genes) from the genomes of the C. difficile strains demonstrated that the genes from strains with the same ribotype generally clustered together. Further, certain ribotypes always clustered together and formed ribotype groups, i.e. ribotypes 078, 033 and 126, as well as ribotypes 002 and 017, indicating their relatedness. Comparisons of the gene contents of the genomes of ribotypes that clustered according to the conserved gene analysis revealed that the number of common genes of the ribotypes belonging to each of these three ribotype groups were very similar for the 078/033/126 group (at most 69 specific genes between the different strains with the same ribotype) but less similar for the 002/017 group (86 genes difference). It appears that the ribotype is indicative not only of a specific pattern of the amplified 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer but also reflects specific differences in the nucleotide sequences of the conserved genes studied here. It can be anticipated that the sequence deviations of more genes of C. difficile strains are correlated with their PCR-ribotype. In conclusion, the results of this study corroborate and extend the concept of clonal C. difficile lineages, which correlate with ribotypes affiliation."
https://openalex.org/W1987429107,"Background Sleep deprivation and obesity, are associated with neurocognitive impairments. Effects of sleep deprivation and obesity on cognition are unknown, and the cognitive long-term effects of improvement of sleep have not been prospectively assessed in short sleeping, obese individuals. Objective To characterize neurocognitive functions and assess its reversibility. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Tertiary Referral Research Clinical Center. Patients A cohort of 121 short-sleeping (<6.5 h/night) obese (BMI 30–55 kg/m2) men and pre-menopausal women. Intervention Sleep extension (468±88 days) with life-style modifications. Measurements Neurocognitive functions, sleep quality and sleep duration. Results At baseline, 44% of the individuals had an impaired global deficit score (t-score 0–39). Impaired global deficit score was associated with worse subjective sleep quality (p = 0.02), and lower urinary dopamine levels (p = 0.001). Memory was impaired in 33%; attention in 35%; motor skills in 42%; and executive function in 51% of individuals. At the final evaluation (N = 74), subjective sleep quality improved by 24% (p<0.001), self-reported sleep duration increased by 11% by questionnaires (p<0.001) and by 4% by diaries (p = 0.04), and daytime sleepiness tended to improve (p = 0.10). Global cognitive function and attention improved by 7% and 10%, respectively (both p = 0.001), and memory and executive functions tended to improve (p = 0.07 and p = 0.06). Serum cortisol increased by 17% (p = 0.02). In a multivariate mixed model, subjective sleep quality and sleep efficiency, urinary free cortisol and dopamine and plasma total ghrelin accounted for 1/5 of the variability in global cognitive function. Limitations Drop-out rate. Conclusions Chronically sleep-deprived obese individuals exhibit substantial neurocognitive deficits that are partially reversible upon improvement of sleep in a non-pharmacological way. These findings have clinical implications for large segments of the US population. Trail registration www.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00261898. NIDDK protocol 06-DK-0036"

Apart from participating in extracellular processes, serglycin proteoglycan and one of its associated proteases, tryptase, are known to regulate cell death by promoting apoptosis over necrosis. Here we sought to outline the underlying mechanism and identify core histones as primary proteolytic targets for the serglycin-tryptase axis. During the cell death process, tryptase was found to relocalize from granules into the cytosol and nucleus, and it was found that the absence of tryptase was associated with a pronounced accumulation of core histones both in the cytosol and in the nucleus. Intriguingly, tryptase deficiency resulted in defective proteolytic modification of core histones even at baseline conditions, i.e. in the absence of cytotoxic agent, suggesting that tryptase has a homeostatic impact on nuclear events. Indeed, tryptase was found in the nucleus of viable cells and was shown to cleave core histones in their N-terminal tail. Moreover, it was shown that the absence of the serglycin-tryptase axis resulted in altered chromatin composition. Together, these findings implicate histone proteolysis through a secretory granule-derived serglycin-tryptase axis as a novel principle for histone modification, during both cell homeostasis and cell death.

https://openalex.org/W1986811536,"Dioxygenases catalyze a diverse range of chemical reactions that involve the incorporation of oxygen into a substrate and typically use a transition metal or organic cofactor for reaction. Bacterial (1H)-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinaldine 2,4-dioxygenase (HOD) belongs to a class of oxygenases able to catalyze this energetically unfavorable reaction without any cofactor. In the quinaldine metabolic pathway, HOD breaks down its natural N-heteroaromatic substrate using a mechanism that is still incompletely understood. Experimental and computational approaches were combined to study the initial step of the catalytic cycle. We have investigated the role of the active site His-251/Asp-126 dyad, proposed to be involved in substrate hydroxyl group deprotonation, a critical requirement for subsequent oxygen reaction. The pH profiles obtained under steady-state conditions for the H251A and D126A variants show a strong pH effect on their kcat and kcat/Km constants, with a decrease in kcat/Km of 5500- and 9-fold at pH 10.5, respectively. Substrate deprotonation studies under transient-state conditions show that this step is not rate-limiting and yield a pKa value of ∼ 7.2 for WT HOD. A large solvent isotope effect was found, and the pKa value was shifted to ∼ 8.3 in D2O. Crystallographic and computational studies reveal that the mutations have a minor effect on substrate positioning. Computational work shows that both His-251 and Asp-126 are essential for the proton transfer driving force of the initial reaction. This multidisciplinary study offers unambiguous support to the view that substrate deprotonation, driven by the His/Asp dyad, is an essential requirement for its activation."
https://openalex.org/W2040322474,"Mutations in otoferlin, a C2 domain-containing ferlin family protein, cause non-syndromic hearing loss in humans (DFNB9 deafness). Furthermore, transmitter secretion of cochlear inner hair cells is compromised in mice lacking otoferlin. In the present study, we show that the C2F domain of otoferlin directly binds calcium (KD = 267 μM) with diminished binding in a pachanga (D1767G) C2F mouse mutation. Calcium was found to differentially regulate binding of otoferlin C2 domains to target SNARE (t-SNARE) proteins and phospholipids. C2D-F domains interact with the syntaxin-1 t-SNARE motif with maximum binding within the range of 20-50 μM Ca(2+). At 20 μM Ca(2+), the dissociation rate was substantially lower, indicating increased binding (KD = ∼10(-9)) compared with 0 μM Ca(2+) (KD = ∼10(-8)), suggesting a calcium-mediated stabilization of the C2 domain·t-SNARE complex. C2A and C2B interactions with t-SNAREs were insensitive to calcium. The C2F domain directly binds the t-SNARE SNAP-25 maximally at 100 μM and with reduction at 0 μM Ca(2+), a pattern repeated for C2F domain interactions with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. In contrast, C2F did not bind the vesicle SNARE protein synaptobrevin-1 (VAMP-1). Moreover, an antibody targeting otoferlin immunoprecipitated syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25 but not synaptobrevin-1. As opposed to an increase in binding with increased calcium, interactions between otoferlin C2F domain and intramolecular C2 domains occurred in the absence of calcium, consistent with intra-C2 domain interactions forming a ""closed"" tertiary structure at low calcium that ""opens"" as calcium increases. These results suggest a direct role for otoferlin in exocytosis and modulation of calcium-dependent membrane fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2002952111,"Protein arginine methylation is emerging as a significant post-translational modification involved in various cell processes and human diseases. As the major arginine methylation enzyme, protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) strictly generates monomethylarginine and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), but not symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA). The two types of dimethylarginines can lead to distinct biological outputs, as highlighted in the PRMT-dependent epigenetic control of transcription. However, it remains unclear how PRMT1 product specificity is regulated. We discovered that a single amino acid mutation (Met-48 to Phe) in the PRMT1 active site enables PRMT1 to generate both ADMA and SDMA. Due to the limited amount of SDMA formed, we carried out quantum mechanical calculations to determine the free energies of activation of ADMA and SDMA synthesis. Our results indicate that the higher energy barrier of SDMA formation (ΔΔG(‡) = 3.2 kcal/mol as compared with ADMA) may explain the small amount of SDMA generated by M48F-PRMT1. Our study reveals unique energetic challenges for SDMA-forming methyltransferases and highlights the exquisite control of product formation by active site residues in the PRMTs."
https://openalex.org/W1967832196,"Growth-arrested rat mesangial cells (RMCs) at a G0/G1 interphase stimulated to divide in hyperglycemic medium initiate intracellular hyaluronan synthesis that induces autophagy/cyclin D3-induced formation of a monocyte-adhesive extracellular hyaluronan matrix after completing cell division. This study shows that heparin inhibits the intracellular hyaluronan synthesis and autophagy responses, but at the end of cell division it induces synthesis of a much larger extracellular monocyte-adhesive hyaluronan matrix. Heparin bound to RMC surfaces by 1 h, internalizes into the Golgi/endoplasmic reticulum region by 2 h, and was nearly gone by 4 h. Treatment by heparin for only the first 4 h was sufficient for its function. Streptozotocin diabetic rats treated daily with heparin showed similar results. Glomeruli in sections of diabetic kidneys showed extensive accumulation of autophagic RMCs, increased hyaluronan matrix, and influx of macrophages over 6 weeks. Hyaluronan staining in the glomeruli of heparin-treated diabetic rats was very high at week 1 and decreased to near control level by 6 weeks without any RMC autophagy. However, the influx of macrophages by 6 weeks was as pronounced as in diabetic glomeruli. The results are as follows: 1) heparin blocks synthesis of hyaluronan in intracellular compartments, which prevents the autophagy and cyclin D3 responses thereby allowing RMCs to complete cell division and sustain function; 2) interaction of heparin with RMCs in early G1 phase is sufficient to induce signaling pathway(s) for its functions; and 3) influxed macrophages effectively remove the hyaluronan matrix without inducing pro-fibrotic responses that lead to nephropathy and proteinurea in diabetic kidneys."
https://openalex.org/W1984849105,"We have shown previously that tyrosine phosphorylation of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) is important for diverse macrophage functions including phagocytosis, chemotaxis, podosome dynamics, and matrix degradation. However, the specific tyrosine kinase mediating WASP phosphorylation is still unclear. Here, we provide evidence that Hck, which is predominantly expressed in leukocytes, can tyrosine phosphorylate WASP and regulates WASP-mediated macrophage functions. We demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation of WASP in response to stimulation with CX3CL1 or via Fcγ receptor ligation were severely reduced in Hck(-/-) bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) or in RAW/LR5 macrophages in which Hck expression was silenced using RNA-mediated interference (Hck shRNA). Consistent with reduced WASP tyrosine phosphorylation, phagocytosis, chemotaxis, and matrix degradation are reduced in Hck(-/-) BMMs or Hck shRNA cells. In particular, WASP phosphorylation was primarily mediated by the p61 isoform of Hck. Our studies also show that Hck and WASP are required for passage through a dense three-dimensional matrix and transendothelial migration, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of WASP by Hck may play a role in tissue infiltration of macrophages. Consistent with a role for this pathway in invasion, WASP(-/-) BMMs do not invade into tumor spheroids with the same efficiency as WT BMMs and cells expressing phospho-deficient WASP have reduced ability to promote carcinoma cell invasion. Altogether, our results indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of WASP by Hck is required for proper macrophage functions."
https://openalex.org/W2031365733,"A diverse group of coral reef organisms, representing several phyla, possess fluorescent pigments. We investigated the potential of using the characteristic fluorescence emission spectra of these pigments to enable unsupervised, optical classification of coral reef habitats. We compiled a library of characteristic fluorescence spectra through in situ and laboratory measurements from a variety of specimens throughout the Caribbean. Because fluorescent pigments are not species-specific, the spectral library is organized in terms of 15 functional groups. We investigated the spectral separability of the functional groups in terms of the number of wavebands required to distinguish between them, using the similarity measures Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), Spectral Information Divergence (SID), SID-SAM mixed measure, and Mahalanobis distance. This set of measures represents geometric, stochastic, joint geometric-stochastic, and statistical approaches to classifying spectra. Our hyperspectral fluorescence data were used to generate sets of 4-, 6-, and 8-waveband spectra, including random variations in relative signal amplitude, spectral peak shifts, and water-column attenuation. Each set consisted of 2 different band definitions: ‘optimally-picked’ and ‘evenly-spaced.’ The optimally-picked wavebands were chosen to coincide with as many peaks as possible in the functional group spectra. Reference libraries were formed from half of the spectra in each set and used for training purposes. Average classification accuracies ranged from 76.3% for SAM with 4 evenly-spaced wavebands to 93.8% for Mahalanobis distance with 8 evenly-spaced wavebands. The Mahalanobis distance consistently outperformed the other measures. In a second test, empirically-measured spectra were classified using the same reference libraries and the Mahalanobis distance for just the 8 evenly-spaced waveband case. Average classification accuracies were 84% and 87%, corresponding to the extremes in modeled water-column attenuation. The classification results from both tests indicate that a high degree of separability among the 15 fluorescent-spectra functional groups is possible using only a modest number of spectral bands."

We aimed to explore possible explanations for this association in the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development, a prospective birth cohort representative of the general British population.Cognitive function at age 60-64 years was quantified using five measures (verbal memory, letter search speed and accuracy, simple and choice reaction times) and glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at the same age was estimated using cystatin C. The cross-sectional association between cognitive function and eGFR was adjusted for background confounding factors (socioeconomic position, educational attainment), prior cognition, and potential explanations for any remaining association (smoking, diabetes, hypertension, inflammation, obesity).Data on all the analysis variables were available for 1306-1320 study members (depending on cognitive measure). Verbal memory and simple and choice reaction times were strongly associated with eGFR. For example, the lowest quartile of verbal memory corresponded to a 4.1 (95% confidence interval 2.0, 6.2) ml/min/1.73 m(2) lower eGFR relative to the highest quartile. Some of this association was explained by confounding due to socioeconomic factors, but very little of it by prior cognition. Smoking, diabetes, hypertension, inflammation and obesity explained some but not all of the remaining association.These analyses support the notion of a shared pathophysiology of impaired cognitive and kidney function at older age, which precedes clinical disease. The implications of these findings for clinical care and research are important and under-recognised, though further confirmatory studies are required."

The basin suffers from various types of pollutants including heavy metals and nutrients due to a high population density and rapid economic development in this area. We assessed the relationship between heavy metal accumulation by periphyton playing an important role in fluvial food webs and eutrophication in the HRB. The concentrations of the unicellular diatoms (type A), filamentous algae with diatoms (type B), and filamentous algae (type C) varied along the river, with type A dominating upstream, and types B then C increasing in concentration further downstream, and this was consistent with changes in the trophic status of the river. The mean heavy metal concentrations in the type A, B and C organisms were Cr: 18, 18 and 24 mg/kg, respectively, Ni: 9.2, 10 and 12 mg/kg, respectively, Cu: 8.4, 19 and 29 mg/kg, respectively, and Pb: 11, 9.8 and 7.1 mg/kg respectively. The bioconcentration factors showed that the abilities of the organisms to accumulate Cr, Ni and Pb decreased in the order type A, type B, then type C, but their abilities to accumulate Cu increased in that order. The Ni concentration was a good predictor of Cr, Cu and Pb accumulation by all three periphyton types. Our study shows that heavy metal accumulation by periphyton is associated with eutrophication in the rivers in the HRB."

We previously showed that proteasomal degradation of GABAB receptors via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein degradation (ERAD) machinery determines the number of cell surface GABAB receptors and thereby GABAB receptor-mediated neuronal inhibition. Here, we show that proteasomal degradation of GABAB receptors requires the interaction of the GABAB2 C terminus with the proteasomal AAA-ATPase Rpt6. A mutant of Rpt6 lacking ATPase activity prevented degradation of GABAB receptors but not the removal of Lys48-linked ubiquitin from GABAB2. Blocking ERAD activity diminished the interaction of Rtp6 with GABAB receptors resulting in increased total as well as cell surface expression of GABAB receptors. Modulating neuronal activity affected proteasomal activity and correspondingly the interaction level of Rpt6 with GABAB2. This resulted in altered cell surface expression of the receptors. Thus, neuronal activity-dependent proteasomal degradation of GABAB receptors by the ERAD machinery is a potent mechanism regulating the number of GABAB receptors available for signaling and is expected to contribute to homeostatic neuronal plasticity.

Folding and assembly of receptors is a rather inefficient process frequently resulting in incorrectly folded and misassembled proteins. Defective receptor proteins are Lys48-linked polyubiquitinated, exported from the ER membrane, and degraded by proteasomes. This process is executed by a multiprotein machinery called ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) (8Vembar S.S. Brodsky J.L. One step at a time: endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 944-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). In addition to its quality control function, ERAD may also be involved in the activity-dependent regulation of neurotransmitter receptors. For instance, the level of functional GABAA receptors in the plasma membrane has been shown to be down-regulated after suppression of neuronal activity or blocking l-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels by a mechanism that involved ubiquitination of the GABAA receptor β3 subunit and proteasomes (9Saliba R.S.

The excitability of neurons is controlled, among others, by the G protein-coupled GABAB receptors. GABAB receptors are heterodimers composed of the two subunits GABAB1 and GABAB2. They mediate slow inhibitory neurotransmission by activating K+ channels and inhibiting Ca2+ channels (11Bettler B. Kaupmann K. Mosbacher J. Gassmann M. Molecular structure and physiological functions of GABAB receptors.Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 835-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar).

Methods. 2006; 3: 995-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). The target proteins are detected using two primary antibodies raised in different species and a corresponding pair of oligonucleotide labeled species-specific secondary antibodies (PLA probes). Only when the two primary antibodies bound to their target proteins are located in very close proximity (<30 nm), specific oligonucleotides can hybridize to the PLA probes enabling a rolling cycle amplification reaction that generates a long DNA strand to which specific fluorophore-labeled oligonucleotides are hybridized. The signal from each pair of PLA probes generates an individual fluorescent spot detectable by fluorescence microscopy. In this study, in situ PLA was employed for detecting the interaction of GABAB receptors with Rpt6 (using mouse Rpt6 1:20 and rabbit GABAB2N 13 μg/ml μg/ml), HA-tagged Rpt6 with GABAB receptors (using 1:200 mouse HA and 13 μg/ml rabbit GABAB2N), as well as for detecting Lys48-linked (rabbit ubiquitin Lys48-specific (1:50) and guinea pig GABAB2 (1:250)) and Lys63-linked (rabbit ubiquitin Lys63-specific (1:50) and guinea pig GABAB2 (1:250)) ubiquitination of GABAB receptors. The specificity of the PLA signal was validated for each pair of antibodies in HEK 293 cell expressing or not expressing GABAB receptors. In addition, in neurons omitting one of the primary antibodies did not generate PLA signals. In situ PLA was performed using the Duolink in situ kit (Olink Bioscience) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cortical neurons grown on coverslips were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, washed again with PBS, and permeabilized for 10 min with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. After washing again with PBS, the neurons were incubated with the appropriate pair of primary antibodies (diluted in PBS containing 3% BSA) overnight at 4 °C. Thereafter, the cells were washed four times for 5 min with PBS, followed by incubation with the PLA probes (PLA probe anti-mouse minus and PLA probe anti-rabbit plus or PLA probe anti-guinea pig plus, all diluted 1:5 in 3% BSA/PBS) for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing the cells two times for 5 min with PBS, the ligation solution diluted 1:5 in water was added to the neurons and incubated in a preheated humidity chamber for 1 h at 37 °C. The neurons were then washed two times for 5 min with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20. Finally, the amplification solution containing the fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides diluted 1:5 in water along with secondary antibodies for the determination of the GABAB2 expression levels was added to the neurons and incubated in a preheated humidity chamber for 100 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the neurons were washed two times with 0.2 m Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl, and once with 0.002 m Tris, 0.001 m NaCl for 1 min in the dark at room temperature and mounted on microscope slides with Dako fluorescent mounting medium. Stained neurons were immediately analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSM 510 Meta, Zeiss, 100× plan apochromat oil differential interference contrast objective, 1.4 numerical aperture). Five optical sections were taken with a distance of 0.3 μm and a resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels. Quantification was done by counting the PLA spots within the soma of the neurons using MacBiophotonics ImageJ software (version 1.41n). First, the area of the soma and the integrated fluorescence intensity of the GABAB2 signal were determined, and then the PLA spots were counted. PLA signals were normalized to the GABAB2 signal and the area of the soma. We recently showed that the expression of total and cell surface GABAB receptors is regulated by proteasomes via the ERAD (12Zemoura K. Schenkel M. Acuña M.A. Yévenes G.E. Zeilhofer H.U. Benke D.

To identify proteins that might be involved in proteasomal degradation of GABAB receptors, we screened a brain cDNA library with a sequence comprising the last 12 C-terminal amino acids of GABAB2 for interacting proteins using the yeast two-hybrid assay. One of the eight putative GABAB receptor-interacting proteins detected with this system, the AAA-ATPase Rtp6/Sug1/p45 (hereafter named Rpt6), was related to protein degradation. Rpt6 is a component of the 19S regulatory particle of the proteasome and has been implicated in recruiting proteins to proteasomes for degradation (24Su K. Yang X. Roos M.D. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E.

We verified the interaction of Rpt6 with native GABAB receptors by their co-immunoprecipitation from rat brain extracts (Fig. 1A) and by in situ PLA in cultured neurons (Fig. 1B). Moreover, inhibition of proteasomal activity for 30 min with MG132 considerably increased the interaction of Rpt6 with GABAB2 (156 ± 19% of control, Fig. 1B), suggesting that the receptors are no longer degraded and remained bound to Rpt6. This finding was further corroborated by colocalization studies. Blocking proteasomal activity with MG132 for 30 min resulted in a small increase of GABAB2 clusters (120 ± 8% of control, Fig. 1C), whereas Rpt6 clusters remained unchanged. However, the co-localization of GABAB2 clusters with Rpt6 clusters was considerably increased (193 ± 12% of control, Fig. 1C). These results suggest that interaction of Rpt6 with GABAB2 mediates proteasomal degradation of GABAB receptors. The effect of Rpt6 on GABAB receptors was analyzed in detail using coexpression experiments in HEK 293 cells. HEK 293 cells overexpressing Rpt6 displayed reduced levels of total (GABAB1, 56 ± 3%; GABAB2, 49 ± 3% of control; Fig. 2A) as well as cell surface GABAB receptors (GABAB1, 38 ± 5%; GABAB2, 47 ± 5% of control; Fig. 2B), indicating that Rpt6 mediates degradation of GABAB receptors. Coexpression of Rpt6 with individual GABAB receptor subunits reduced the expression level of GABAB2 (60 ± 4% of control, Fig. 2C) but did not affect the level of GABAB1 (Fig. 2D), demonstrating that Rpt6 specifically interacts with GABAB2 to down-regulate GABAB receptors. This notion was further substantiated by the finding that the expression level of a C-terminal truncated version of GABAB2 (GABAB2(T749)), which does not contain the Rpt6 interaction site, was not affected by coexpression with Rpt6 (Fig. 2E). Recently, we showed that proteasomal degradation of GABAB receptors requires Lys48-linked ubiquitination of the GABAB2 C-terminal domain at Lys767/771 (12Zemoura K. Schenkel M. Acuña M.A. Yévenes G.E. Zeilhofer H.U. Benke D. Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) controls cell surface expression of γ-aminobutyric acid, type B receptors.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 34897-34905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To analyze whether Rpt6-mediated down-regulation depends on ubiquitination of GABAB2, we expressed Rpt6 together with a mutant of GABAB2 in which Lys767/771 were exchanged for arginines (GABAB2(RR)) to prevent ubiquitination at these sites (12Zemoura K. Schenkel M. Acuña M.A. Yévenes G.E. Zeilhofer H.U. Benke D. Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) controls cell surface expression of γ-aminobutyric acid, type B receptors.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 34897-34905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As expected, GABAB2(RR) was resistant to Rpt6-mediated down-regulation, verifying that Rpt6 is involved in proteasomal degradation of Lys48-linked ubiquitinated GABAB receptors (Fig. 2F). Finally, to prove that Rtp6-mediated down-regulation of GABAB receptors in fact depends on interaction of GABAB2 with Rtp6, we used a synthetic peptide (R2C-Pep) comprising the last 14 C-terminal amino acids of GABAB2 to disrupt the GABAB2/Rpt6 interaction. R2C-Pep inhibited the down-regulation of GABAB2 by Rpt6 (108 ± 6% of control, Fig. 3), whereas a control peptide (R2r-Pep, random order of the same amino acids) had no significant effect (80 ±"
https://openalex.org/W2037537939,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is secreted in brief pulses that stimulate synthesis and secretion of pituitary gonadotropin hormones and thereby mediate control of reproduction. It acts via G-protein-coupled receptors to stimulate effectors, including ERK. Information could be encoded in GnRH pulse frequency, width, amplitude, or other features of pulse shape, but the relative importance of these features is unknown. Here we examine this using automated fluorescence microscopy and mathematical modeling, focusing on ERK signaling. The simplest scenario is one in which the system is linear, and response dynamics are relatively fast (compared with the signal dynamics). In this case integrated system output (ERK activation or ERK-driven transcription) will be roughly proportional to integrated input, but we find that this is not the case. Notably, we find that relatively slow response kinetics lead to ERK activity beyond the GnRH pulse, and this reduces sensitivity to pulse width. More generally, we show that the slowing of response kinetics through the signaling cascade creates a system that is robust to pulse width. We, therefore, show how various levels of response kinetics synergize to dictate system sensitivity to different features of pulsatile hormone input. We reveal the mathematical and biochemical basis of a dynamic GnRH signaling system that is robust to changes in pulse amplitude and width but is sensitive to changes in receptor occupancy and frequency, precisely the features that are tightly regulated and exploited to exert physiological control in vivo."

The soluble poxvirus-encoded protein viral CC chemokine inhibitor (vCCI), a CC chemokine inhibitor, can bind to human CC chemokines tightly to impair the host immune defense. This protein has no known homologs in eukaryotes and may represent a potent method to stop inflammation. Previously, our structure of the vCCI·MIP-1β (macrophage inflammatory protein-1β) complex indicated that vCCI uses negatively charged residues in β-sheet II to interact with positively charged residues in the MIP-1β N terminus, 20s region and 40s loop. However, the interactions between vCCI and other CC chemokines have not yet been fully explored. Here, we used NMR and fluorescence anisotropy to study the interaction between vCCI and eotaxin-1 (CCL11), a CC chemokine that is an important factor in the asthma response. NMR results reveal that the binding pattern is very similar to the vCCI·MIP-1β complex and suggest that electrostatic interactions provide a major contribution to binding. Fluorescence anisotropy results on variants of eotaxin-1 further confirm the critical roles of the charged residues in eotaxin-1. In addition, the binding affinity between vCCI and other wild type CC chemokines, MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), MIP-1β, and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted), were determined as 1.1, 1.2, and 0.22 nm, respectively.

Chemokines belong to a family of small (8–14-kDa) secreted proteins whose major function is to guide the migration and development of leukocytes. As such, chemokines play a major role in inflammation (1Charo I.F. Ransohoff R.M. The many roles of chemokines and chemokine receptors in inflammation.N. Engl. J.

Despite differences in primary sequence and varied functions within the superfamily, chemokines all adopt very similar tertiary structures, including an extended N terminus followed by a globular core composed of a three-stranded β-sheet arranged in a Greek key motif with a C-terminal α-helix (3Fernandez E.J.

Traditionally, chemokines are divided into four subfamilies, C, CC, CXC, and CX3C, based on the arrangement of their N-terminal cysteine residues (5Luster A.D. Chemokines. Chemotactic cytokines that mediate inflammation.N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (3252) Google Scholar).

In addition, chemokines have been implicated in the damaging activation and migration of immune cells in the brain after traumatic brain injury (11Riva-Depaty I. Fardeau C. Mariani J. Bouchaud C.

Poxviruses and herpes viruses encode proteins that interfere with the actions of chemokines, probably facilitating viral evasion of the host immune system (13Smith C.A. Smith T.D. Smolak P.J.

As for chemokine-binding proteins, poxviruses encode a protein called vCCI (viral CC chemokine inhibitor; also called “35K” due to its original presumed molecular weight).

The structure of vCCI from human cowpox virus was shown by x-ray crystallography to be composed of two parallel β-sheets, two short α-helices, and loops that connect the β-sheets and helices (28Carfí A. Smith C.A. Smolak P.J. McGrew J. Wiley D.C. Structure of a soluble secreted chemokine inhibitor vCCI (p35) from cowpox virus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 12379-12383Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). One helix is on the edge of the structure, and the other short helix is in the exposed side of β-sheet I. A similar protein, EVM1 from mousepox, was also determined (33Arnold P.L. Fremont D.H. Structural determinants of chemokine binding by an Ectromelia virus-encoded decoy receptor.J. Virol. 2006; 80: 7439-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A solution structure of rabbitpox vCCI in complex with a variant of human MIP-1β was also reported by us and showed the interaction surface of vCCI to be the β-sheet II side of the protein (32Zhang L. Derider M. McCornack M.A. Jao S.C. Isern N. Ness T. Moyer R. LiWang P.J. Solution structure of the complex between poxvirus-encoded CC chemokine inhibitor vCCI and human MIP-1β.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13985-13990Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The vCCI-chemokine interaction appears to be largely driven by the negatively charged surface of vCCI interacting with the positively charged regions of the chemokine. Critical residues on vCCI appeared to be negative charges at 141 and 143 and in the long loop region from 53 to 77. These residues interact with several conserved positive charges in the chemokine, including residue 18 and at least one residue at 24 or 45/46 of the 40s loop (the numbering is according to the MIP-1β sequence) (32Zhang L. Derider M. McCornack M.A. Jao S.C. Isern N. Ness T. Moyer R. LiWang P.J. Solution structure of the complex between poxvirus-encoded CC chemokine inhibitor vCCI and human MIP-1β.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13985-13990Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These chemokine positions have also been shown by mutagenesis of other chemokines to be important in vCCI binding (23Beck C.G. Studer C. Zuber J.F. Demange B.J. Manning U. Urfer R.

More recently, mutagenesis has confirmed the essential role of vCCI residues Glu-143 and Tyr-80 in chemokine inhibition. This work also showed that the mutation of R89A in vCCI results in an increase in chemokine inhibition (25White G.E. McNeill E. Christou I. Channon K.M. Greaves D.R. Site-directed mutagenesis of the CC chemokine binding protein 35K-Fc reveals residues essential for activity and mutations that increase the potency of CC chemokine blockade.Mol. Pharmacol. 2011; 80: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In the present work, we sought to expand our knowledge of vCCI interactions by studying this protein structurally and biochemically in complex with a chemokine having a different function than MIP-1β, namely eotaxin-1 (which will hereafter be referred to as eotaxin). Eotaxin has 36% sequence identity to MIP-1β (Fig. 1), but its receptor binding profile is quite different. Eotaxin is an important CC chemokine that has been shown to exist primarily as a monomer in many different buffer conditions, including pH 7.0 (39Crump M.P. Rajarathnam K. Kim K.S. Clark-Lewis I. Sykes B.D. Solution structure of eotaxin, a chemokine that selectively recruits eosinophils in allergic inflammation.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22471-22479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This protein plays important roles in allergy and asthma pathogenesis (40Pease J.E. Targeting chemokine receptors in allergic disease.Biochem. J. 2011; 434: 11-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). vCCI has been shown to be able to bind eotaxin and has also been shown in vivo to reduce airway inflammation, probably due at least in part to its ability to bind eotaxin (22Dabbagh K. Xiao Y. Smith C. Stepick-Biek P. Kim S.G. Lamm W.J. Liggitt D.H. Lewis D.B. Local blockade of allergic airway hyperreactivity and inflammation by the poxvirus-derived pan-CC-chemokine inhibitor vCCI. J.Immunol. 2000; 165: 3418-3422Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Whereas MIP-1β binds to the receptor CCR5 and mediates chemotaxis of macrophages and monocytes, eotaxin binds to CCR3 and mediates eosinophil influx, with particular relevance to asthma (41Bisset L.R.

Sci. 2006; 27: 41-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Therefore, a study of the vCCI-eotaxin interaction is particularly valuable for both biochemical insight and possible applications of medical importance. Here we use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to determine the chemical shift assignments of the vCCI·eotaxin complex and use the docking program HADDOCK to model the interaction surface for the complex (43Dominiguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. HADDOCK. A protein-protein docking approach based on biochemical or biophysical information.J. Am. Chem.

New features and performance of HADDOCK2.0 on the CAPRI targets.Proteins. 2007; 69: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). We have made mutations to putative critical residues on eotaxin and carried out binding experiments to vCCI using a fluorescence anisotropy binding assay that may be generally useful for studying vCCI interactions. This work has allowed the identification of the contact surfaces present on vCCI and human eotaxin that are required for high affinity interaction with each other. The structural model of the vCCI·eotaxin complex is in agreement with the result from the fluorescence anisotropy binding data and indicates that vCCI binds to eotaxin similarly to MIP-1β, utilizing key residues of the chemokine. This work suggests the basis for the ability of vCCI to bind with high affinity to a broad array of chemokines. The encoding sequence for eotaxin and mutants was amplified via PCR and was cloned into the pET-28a(+) vector with a SUMO fusion tag (Novagen, Madison, WI). The plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI). Cells were grown at 37 °C. When A600 reached ∼0.8, protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. The culture was then shaken for 16 h at 16 °C, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole (pH 8.0) with 5 mm benzamidine and French pressed twice at 16,000 p.s.i. After centrifugation for 1 h at 27,000 × g, the supernatant was purified through a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (GE Healthcare), and then the purified protein was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris and 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, buffer overnight at 4 °C for 16 h. During the dialysis, 60–80 μl of 100 μm Ulp1 protease (45Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Ulp1-SUMO crystal structure and genetic analysis reveal conserved interactions and a regulatory element essential for cell growth in yeast.Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) was added in the dialysis bag to cleave the SUMO fusion partner. After dialysis, precipitated matter was removed by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 30 min. Finally, the cleaved protein was purified over a C4 reversed phase chromatography column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) using the Akta purification system (GE Healthcare). Most SUMO tag precipitated out during dialysis. Protein concentration was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. The chemokine MCP-1 was also prepared as described above. 15N-Labeled and 2H/15N-labeled protein was prepared by using M9 minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope Laboratory, Andover, MA) and/or d-[13C6]glucose (Sigma-Aldrich) as the sole nitrogen and/or carbon resource, respectively. For deuterated samples for NMR, the medium was prepared with 95% (final concentration) D2O. MIP-1β-K45A/R46A/K48A, MIP-1β, and RANTES were amplified via PCR and were cloned into pET-28a(+) vector with a SUMO fusion tag. The purification of these proteins involved refolding, as described previously (46Xue J. Kuo N. Schill M.S. LiWang P.J. A comparison of 5P12-vMIP-II and vMIP-II as HIV-1 entry inhibitors.Biochem.

The gene encoding rabbitpox virus vCCI was cloned into pPIC9K plasmid and then transformed into Pichia pastoris strain SMD1168 (Invitrogen). Unlabeled, 15N-labeled, 2H/15N-labeled, and 2H/13C/15N-labeled protein samples were prepared as described previously (32Zhang L. Derider M. McCornack M.A. Jao S.C. Isern N. Ness T. Moyer R.

Spectra were recorded on a Bruker 600-MHz AVANCE III spectrometer equipped with a TCI cryoprobe at 37 °C. 2,2-Dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid was used as an internal standard. Spectroscopic data were also collected on the vCCI·eotaxin complex at the High Field NMR Facility, William R. Wiley Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, allowing initial chemical shift assignments and sample conditions to be tested. These experiments were carried out on Varian Inova 800 spectrometers (Varian, Palo Alto, CA). The NMRPipe software suite (47Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. NMRPipe.

https://openalex.org/W2144917202,"The importance of the early environment on long-term heath and life span is well documented. However, the molecular mechanisms mediating these effects remain poorly understood. Male offspring from a maternal protein restriction model, in which animals are exposed to a low-protein diet while in utero and then are cross-fostered to normally fed dams, demonstrate low birth weight, catch-up growth, and reduced life span (recuperated offspring). In the current study, we used microarray analysis to identify hepatic genes that changed with age. Cell death-inducing DNA fragmentation factor, α subunit-like effector A (Cidea), a transcriptional coactivator that has been implicated in lipid accumulation demonstrated one of the largest age-associated increases in expression (200-fold, P<0.001). This increase was exaggerated ∼3-fold in recuperated offspring. These demonstrated increased hepatic lipid accumulation, higher levels of transcription factors important in lipid regulation, and greater oxidative stress. In vitro analysis revealed that Cidea expression was regulated by oxidative stress and DNA methylation. These findings suggest that maternal diet modulates the age-associated changes in Cidea expression through several mechanisms. This expression affects hepatic lipid metabolism in these animals and thus provides a mechanism by which maternal diet can contribute to the metabolic health and ultimately the life span of the offspring."
https://openalex.org/W1989012867,"We previously reported that phosphorylation of myosin II-interacting guanine nucleotide exchange factor (MyoGEF) by polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) promotes the localization of MyoGEF to the central spindle and increases MyoGEF activity toward RhoA during mitosis. In this study we report that aurora B-mediated phosphorylation of MyoGEF at Thr-544 creates a docking site for Plk1, leading to the localization and activation of MyoGEF at the central spindle. In vitro kinase assays show that aurora B can phosphorylate MyoGEF. T544A mutation drastically decreases aurora B-mediated phosphorylation of MyoGEF in vitro and in transfected HeLa cells. Coimmunoprecipitation and in vitro pulldown assays reveal that phosphorylation of MyoGEF at Thr-544 enhances the binding of Plk1 to MyoGEF. Immunofluorescence analysis shows that aurora B colocalizes with MyoGEF at the central spindle and midbody during cytokinesis. Suppression of aurora B activity by an aurora B inhibitor disrupts the localization of MyoGEF to the central spindle. In addition, T544A mutation interferes with the localization of MyoGEF to the cleavage furrow and decreases MyoGEF activity toward RhoA during mitosis. Taken together, our results suggest that aurora B coordinates with Plk1 to regulate MyoGEF activation and localization, thus contributing to the regulation of cytokinesis.

In addition, T544A mutation interferes with the localization of MyoGEF to the cleavage furrow and decreases MyoGEF activity toward RhoA during mitosis. Taken together, our results suggest that aurora B coordinates with Plk1 to regulate MyoGEF activation and localization, thus contributing to the regulation of cytokinesis. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) 2The abbreviations used are:PlkPolo-like kinase 1GEFguanine nucleotide exchange factorPBDpolo-box domainPHpleckstrin homology domainMyoGEFmyosin II-interacting guanine nucleotide exchange factor. plays a central role in controlling multiple events during cell cycle progression, such as centrosome amplification and maturation, mitotic exit, mitotic spindle assembly, spindle pole maintenance, and cytokinesis (1Barr F.A.

It has been demonstrated that Plk1 associates with its substrates by binding to a docking site (S-pS or S-pT) that is created by the phosphorylation mediated by priming kinases (2Elia A.E. Rellos P.

Plk1 docking sites often overlap with Cdk1 consensus sites ((pS/pT)PX(K/R)), and Cdk1 can act as a priming kinase to generate Plk1 docking sites on a number of proteins, such as INCENP, vimentin, GRASP65, Cep55, Nir2, Bub1, MYPT1, and PICH (4Baumann C.

However, it has also been shown that GEF-H1 (a RhoGEF) contributes to RhoA activation at the cleavage furrow (39Birkenfeld J. Nalbant P. Bohl B.P. Pertz O. Hahn K.M. Bokoch G.M.

More recently, a RhoGEF termed leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG) is involved in the late stages of cytokinesis (40Martz M.K. Grabocka E. Beeharry N. Yen T.J. Wedegaertner P.B. Leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG) is a novel RhoGEF in cytokinesis and required for the proper completion of abscission.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2013; 24: 2785-2794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, our previous findings have shown that another RhoGEF, MyoGEF, is implicated in equatorial RhoA activation during cytokinesis (41Wu D. Asiedu M. Adelstein R.S. Wei Q.

In addition, Plk1 can phosphorylate MyoGEF at Thr-574 and promote the activation and localization of MyoGEF at the central spindle (43Asiedu M. Wu D. Matsumura F. Wei Q.

In this study we provide evidence demonstrating that aurora B can phosphorylate MyoGEF at Thr-544, creating a docking site for Plk1. HeLa cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. A double thymidine block was used to synchronize cells at mitosis as described previously (43Asiedu M. Wu D. Matsumura F. Wei Q.

Briefly, the transfected HeLa cells were treated with 2 mm thymidine for 24 h, cultured in thymidine-free medium for 10 h, and treated with 2 mm thymidine for 16 h followed by “release” to progress through the cell cycle in thymidine-free medium for 12 h. Lipofectamine was used for transfection with plasmids or siRNA according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). For transfection with plasmids, the transfected cells were analyzed ∼24 h after transfection. For transfection with siRNA, the transfected cells were analyzed ∼48–72 h after transfection. The siRNA for human aurora B (5′-CGCGGCACUUC ACAAUUGATT-3′) (44Tang Z. Sun Y. Harley S.E. Zou H. Yu H. Human Bub1 protects centromeric sister-chromatid cohesion through Shugoshin during mitosis.Proc.

To generate plasmids encoding His- and GST-tagged MyoGEF, the human MyoGEF cDNA was cloned into pDEST26 and pDEST27 vectors, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The MyoGEF mutant T544A was generated by site-directed mutagenesis according to the manufacturer's instructions (Agilent Technologies) and confirmed by DNA sequencing (Eurofins MWG Operon).

BL21 bacterial cells expressing GST-tagged recombinant polypeptides were resuspended in PBS and homogenized by sonication. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%. The bacterial lysates were then incubated by shaking at 23 °C for 1 h. A glutathione-conjugated agarose (Sigma) column was used to purify GST-tagged recombinant polypeptides.

After washing four times with binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT), the beads were resuspended in SDS loading buffer to elute the bound proteins. In vitro translated Myc-aurora B was synthesized using the TNT SP6 quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Coimmunoprecipitation assays were carried out as described previously (46Wei Q. Pitx2a binds to human Papillomavirus type 18 E6 protein and inhibits E6-mediated P53 degradation in HeLa cells.J. Biol.

Briefly, transfected HeLa cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF) for 10 min on ice. Cell extracts were collected and precleared with protein A/G-agarose beads. The precleared lysate was incubated with agarose-conjugated anti-Myc antibody overnight at 4 °C. After 3 washes with radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer, the bound proteins were eluted with SDS loading buffer. Cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were separated on 10% or 4–12% SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad), transferred to an Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore), blocked in 5% nonfat milk, and incubated with primary antibodies as indicated. The following primary antibodies were used: mouse anti-Myc (1:1000, 9E10, catalogue number sc-40, Santa Cruz), mouse anti-Plk1 (1:1000, 3F8, catalogue number, sc-53751, Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-aurora B (1:2000, catalogue number, sc-25426, Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-phosphohistone 3 (1:1000, catalogue number, 06-570, Millipore), rabbit anti-phosphothreonine (1:500, catalogue number 71-8200, Invitrogen), rabbit anti-GFP (1:1000, catalogue number sc-8334, Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-β-tubulin (1:2000, catalogue number sc-9104, Santa Cruz), and rabbit anti-MyoGEF (1:250) (41Wu D.

After 3 washes, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000, Santa Cruz) for 1 h at 23 °C and visualized by SuperSignal West Pico Luminol/Enhancer solution (Pierce). HeLa cells grown on coverslips were fixed with methanol for 12 min at −20 °C. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 23 °C, the fixed HeLa cells were incubated with primary antibodies as indicated for 3 h at 23 °C or overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with secondary antibodies for 40 min at 23 °C. The primary antibodies used for immunofluorescence analysis were mouse monoclonal anti-MyoGEF antibody (medium of antibody-producing hybridoma cells; without dilution) and rabbit polyclonal aurora B antibody (1:5000, catalogue number sc-25426; Santa Cruz). The mouse monoclonal anti-MyoGEF antibody was generated using the C-terminal 290 amino acid residues of human MyoGEF as antigen. The hybridoma cells for anti-MyoGEF antibody were produced by Promab Biotechnologies, Inc. (Richmond, CA). The secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500) were purchased from Invitrogen. Nuclei were visualized by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma). The coverslips were mounted using a Prolong antifade kit (Invitrogen). Images were collected using the Nikon TiE Perfect Focus Digital Fluorescence Imaging System (Morrell Instrument Company, Inc.) with an Andor Zyla sCMOS 2560 × 2160 camera. Biotinylated peptides (biotin-SPSTRPS(pT)PSLEGSQ and biotin-SPSTRPS(T)PSLEGSQ; both peptides contain amino acid residues 537–551 from MyoGEF) were purchased from Sigma. The peptide pulldown assay was done as described previously (48Lee Y.H. Bedford M.T. Stallcup M.R.

Briefly, 20 μg of biotinylated peptides were incubated with 10 μg of GST-Plk1-PBD overnight in peptide binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40). Twenty-five microliters of streptavidin-agarose beads (Vector Laboratories) were added and incubated by shaking at 23 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed 5 times with 500 μl of peptide binding buffer on a rotator for 1 min per each washing. Twenty microliters of SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer were added to streptavidin-agarose beads and boiled for 5 min. The samples were separated on 4–12% SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad) and subjected to immunoblot analysis with an antibody specific for Plk1 (1:1000; Santa Cruz).

Phosphorylation of mitotic kinesin-like protein 2 by polo-like kinase 1 is required for cytokinesis.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). For the aurora B in vitro kinase assay, 5 μg of purified GST-tagged MyoGEF polypeptides were incubated with 1 μg of recombinant His-aurora B (Invitrogen) in kinase buffer (5 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 2.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm EGTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mm DTT, 250 μm ATP) and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction mixtures (50 μl) were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and resolved on SDS-PAGE gels. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. The GEF exchange assay was conducted using a fluorescence-based spectrometry analysis, which measured the incorporation of a fluorescence analog of GTP (N-methylanthraniloyl (mant)-GTP) onto the small GTPase RhoA. Briefly, HeLa cells transfected with an empty vector or plasmids encoding GST-MyoGEF-WT or GST-MyoGEF-T544A were enriched in mitosis by release from double thymidine block. Glutathione-conjugated agarose beads were used to precipitate GST-tagged recombinant proteins from the transfected HeLa cells. The beads were washed 4 times with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HC1 (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100). 10 μg of His-tagged RhoA (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) were equilibrated in exchange buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml BSA, and 800 nm mant-GTP (Invitrogen). After taking a few measurements of steady readings at 20 °C using a SpectraMax® i3 Multi-Mode Microplate reader (Molecular Devices), 20 μl of empty vector, GST-MyoGEF-WT, or GST-MyoGEF-T544A beads were added, and relative fluorescence of mant-GTP (excitation λ, 360 nm; emission λ, 440 nm) was monitored. The rhotekin pulldown assay was carried out as described previously (41Wu D. Asiedu M. Adelstein R.S. Wei Q. A novel guanine nucleotide exchange factor MyoGEF is required for cytokinesis.Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 1234-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that Plk1 can phosphorylate MyoGEF at Thr-574 (43Asiedu M. Wu D. Matsumura F. Wei Q. Phosphorylation of MyoGEF on Thr-574 by Plk1 promotes MyoGEF localization to the central spindle.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 28392-28400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Plk1 contains an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal polo-box domain (PBD). The PBD can recognize and bind to a docking site on the substrates. In turn, the kinase domain catalyzes the phosphorylation of the target proteins (2Elia A.E. Rellos P. Haire L.F. Chao J.W.

Sex differences in human lifespans imply nonautonomous effects modulated by sex-specific gene-environment interactions that could still include pheromonal mechanisms.

https://openalex.org/W2097069996,"The lethal toxin (LeTx) of Bacillus anthracis plays a central role in the pathogenesis of anthrax-associated shock. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent lipid mediator that has been implicated in endotoxin-associated shock. In this study, we examined the contribution of PAF to the manifestations of lethal toxin challenge in WT mice. LeTx challenge resulted in transient increase in serum PAF levels and a concurrent decrease in PAF acetylhydrolase activity. Inhibition of PAF activity using PAF antagonists or toxin challenge of PAF receptor negative mice reversed or ameliorated many of the pathologic features of LeTx-induced damage, including changes in vascular permeability, hepatic necrosis, and cellular apoptosis. In contrast, PAF inhibition had minimal effects on cytokine levels. Findings from these studies support the continued study of PAF antagonists as potential adjunctive agents in the treatment of anthrax-associated shock."
