https://openalex.org/W2013523408,"Stasek (1) theorized that the extant mollusks are the progeny of three separate lineages that separated before the phylum was well established. He wrote that no known intermediate forms, fossil or living, bridge the ""enormous gaps between any two of the three lineages,"" and therefore treated each as a separate subphylum. These subphyla are (i) the subphylum Aculifera Hatscheck 1891, containing only the class Aplacophora, derived from the most primitive ancestors of the Mollusca; (ii) the subphylum Placophora von Jhering 1876, containing only the class Polyplacophora, and emphasizing the pseudometamerism of its more advanced premollusk ancestor; and (iii) the subphylum Conchifera Gegenbaur 1878, containing the Monoplacophora and the other classes derived from it. We point out that the Polyplacophora may be derived from the Monoplacophora instead of a more primitive ancestral stock. We also suggest that the Conchifera can be separated into two major lineages, each worthy of the rank of subphylum. The fossil record indicates that the Monoplacophora gave rise to the Gastropoda, Cephalopoda, Rostroconchia, and possibly Polyplacophora, and that the Pelecypoda and Scaphopoda are derived from the Rostroconchia. These last three classes thus form a lineage that diverged from the Monoplacophora in the Early Cambrian. They emphasized a shell form that in all groups is primitively open at both ends, allowing the gut to remain relatively straight, with an anterior mouth and posterior anus. They became burrowing (infaunal) deposit or filter feeders. We coin the term Diasoma (through-body) for the subphylum containing these three classes (Rostroconchia, Pelecypoda, and Scaphopoda). The remaining three classes (Monoplacophora, Gastropoda, and Cephalopoda) emphasize a conical univalved shell, usually twisted into a spiral. The relatively small single aperture forces the anus to lie close to the mouth, and the gut is bent into a ""U."" Most are surface-dwelling (epifaunal) grazers or carnivores. We coin the name Cyrtosoma (hunchback-body) for the subphylum containing these three classes. Strictly speaking, the cyrtosomes are the ancestors of the diasomes but, in fact, both subphyla appeared and began to diversify within a few million years in the Early Cambrian. Note added in proof: After proofs were corrected we were informed that the new genus Opikella (40) is preoccupied by (Opikella = Oepikella) Thorslund 1940, an Ordovican ostracod. We rename the mollusk genus Oepikila."
https://openalex.org/W2024025687,Antibiotic and nonpreference mechanisms are related in cucumber through the action of the bi gene and the absence of cucurbitacins. Cucurbitacins attract cucumber beetles and cause feeding whereas they have an antibiotic effect on two-spotted mites.
https://openalex.org/W2013559755,Diamond powder can be successfully cemented with cobalt. At 62 kilobars the sintering occurs over the temperature range from 1570 degrees to 1610 degrees C. The maximum microhardness of the compact ( 3000 kilograms per square millimeter on the Knoop scale) is obtained with a mixture of 20 percent cobalt (by volume) and a diamond particle size of 1 to 5 micrometers.
https://openalex.org/W1971687566,"Salt used for deicing the streets near Rochester, New York, has increased the chloride concentration in Irondequoit Bay at least fivefold during the past two decades. During the winter of 1969-70 the quantity and salinity of the dense runoff that accumulated on the bottom of the bay was sufficient to prevent complete vertical mixing of the bay during the spring. Comparison with 1939 conditions indicates that the period of summer stratification has been prolonged a month by the density gradient imposed by the salt runoff."
https://openalex.org/W2031779520,"An aggregation of 2 x 10(4) Acanthaster planci was observed from September 1969 to November 1970. The sea stars within the aggregation were very uniform in size, and their reproduction was seasonal. Their average diameter and weight also varied seasonally in a manner that suggests a correlation between average size and breeding condition. The aggregation remained compactly situated in a band a few to tens of meters wide and about 2 kilometers long, parallel to the shore. The band did not move appreciably during the observation period. The sea stars were feeding selectively on a coral which was a minor component of the total coral cover. The coral in the area was predominantly alive, and the proportion of dead coral did not increase appreciably during our period of observation."

https://openalex.org/W1976214405,"Steady-state thermal models for the large satellites of the outer planets strongly indicate that their interiors are currently maintained at temperatures well above the ice-ammonia eutectic temperature by the decay of long-lived radioisotopes of potassium, uranium, and thorium. The present-day steady-state thermal structure of a representative satellite, J IV (Callisto), is shown to be characterized by the presence of a thin icy crust over a deep liquid mantle, with a dense core of hydrous silicates and iron oxides. Some dynamical consequences of this model are briefly discussed."

The association of boron with flavonoid synthesis is consistent with the otherwise anomalous situation that this element is essential for higher plants but not for animals or lower plants."

https://openalex.org/W2034307566,"The brightness dependence on the heliocentric distance that has been observed for the hydrogen and the hydroxyl halos of comet 1969g can be quantitatively explained by a three-step process: the vaporization of the water snows, the photodissociation of the water molecule into the ground states of hydrogen and hydroxyl, and the photoexcitation of hydrogen and hydroxyl by a fluorescence mechanism."
