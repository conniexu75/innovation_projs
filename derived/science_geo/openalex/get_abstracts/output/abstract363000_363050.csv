https://openalex.org/W2022685385,"Sorghum, an African grass related to sugar cane and maize, is grown for food, feed, fibre and fuel. We present an initial analysis of the ∼730-megabase Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench genome, placing ∼98% of genes in their chromosomal context using whole-genome shotgun sequence validated by genetic, physical and syntenic information. Genetic recombination is largely confined to about one-third of the sorghum genome with gene order and density similar to those of rice. Retrotransposon accumulation in recombinationally recalcitrant heterochromatin explains the ∼75% larger genome size of sorghum compared with rice. Although gene and repetitive DNA distributions have been preserved since palaeopolyploidization ∼70 million years ago, most duplicated gene sets lost one member before the sorghum–rice divergence. Concerted evolution makes one duplicated chromosomal segment appear to be only a few million years old. About 24% of genes are grass-specific and 7% are sorghum-specific. Recent gene and microRNA duplications may contribute to sorghum’s drought tolerance. The Sorghum bicolor genome sequence is published this week. Sorghum is a cereal grown widely as food, animal feed, fibre and fuel. Tolerant to hot, dry conditions, it is a staple for large populations in the West African Sahel region. Comparisons of the genome with those of maize and rice shed light on the evolution of grasses and of C4 photosynthesis, which is particularly efficient at assimilating carbon at high temperatures. In addition, protein coding genes and miRNAs that could contribute to sorghum's drought tolerance may also be found. Sorghum yield improvement has lagged behind that of other crops and the availability of the genome sequence could provide a vital boost to work on its improvement. Sorghum is an African grass that is grown for food, animal feed and fuel. The current paper presents an initial analysis of the ∼730 megabase genome of Sorghum bicolor. Genome analysis and its comparison with maize and rice shed light on grass genome evolution and also provide insights into the evolution of C4 photosynthesis, as well as protein coding genes and miRNAs that might contribute to sorghum's drought tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2121531763,"Targeting genomic loci by massively parallel sequencing requires new methods to enrich templates to be sequenced. We developed a capture method that uses biotinylated RNA 'baits' to fish targets out of a 'pond' of DNA fragments. The RNA is transcribed from PCR-amplified oligodeoxynucleotides originally synthesized on a microarray, generating sufficient bait for multiple captures at concentrations high enough to drive the hybridization. We tested this method with 170-mer baits that target >15,000 coding exons (2.5 Mb) and four regions (1.7 Mb total) using Illumina sequencing as read-out. About 90% of uniquely aligning bases fell on or near bait sequence; up to 50% lay on exons proper. The uniformity was such that approximately 60% of target bases in the exonic 'catch', and approximately 80% in the regional catch, had at least half the mean coverage. One lane of Illumina sequence was sufficient to call high-confidence genotypes for 89% of the targeted exon space."

Here, we investigate the excitatory synaptic neuronal network of an anatomically defined cortical column, the C2 barrel column of mouse primary somatosensory cortex. This cortical column is known to process tactile information related to the C2 whisker. Through multiple simultaneous whole-cell recordings, we quantify connectivity maps between individual excitatory neurons located across all cortical layers of the C2 barrel column. Synaptic connectivity depended strongly upon somatic laminar location of both presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons, providing definitive evidence for layer-specific signaling pathways. The strongest excitatory influence upon the cortical column was provided by presynaptic layer 4 neurons. In all layers we found rare large-amplitude synaptic connections, which are likely to contribute strongly to reliable information processing. Our data set provides the first functional description of the excitatory synaptic wiring diagram of a physiologically relevant and anatomically well-defined cortical column at single-cell resolution.

Our data set provides the first functional description of the excitatory synaptic wiring diagram of a physiologically relevant and anatomically well-defined cortical column at single-cell resolution. The sophisticated information processing power of the mammalian brain is thought to derive in large part from computations in synaptically connected neocortical neuronal networks. Anatomical data demonstrate that the vast majority of synapses in the neocortex are formed between nearby neurons, with long-range axonal projections making smaller contributions (Braitenberg and Schüz, 1998Braitenberg V. Schüz A. Cortex: Statistics and Geometry of Neuronal Connectivity. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1998Crossref Google Scholar, Douglas et al., 1995Douglas R.J. Koch C. Mahowald M. Martin K.A.C. Suarez H.H. Recurrent excitation in neocortical circuits.Science. 1995; 269: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Such so-called “small-world networks” with dense local connectivity and sparse long-range interactions are considered to be highly efficient in reducing wiring length while allowing rapid and complex information processing (Watts and Strogatz, 1998Watts D.J. Strogatz S.H. Collective dynamics of ‘small-world’ networks.Nature. 1998; 393: 440-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (28468) Google Scholar). Normal to its surface, the neocortex is characterized by vertically arranged columns divided into layers containing different types of neurons. Neocortical areas differ in organization and are specialized for processing different types of information. Primary sensory areas are organized in highly ordered maps tangential to the cortical surface with nearby regions processing closely related sensory information. One of the most remarkable cortical maps is found in the rodent primary somatosensory cortex, where each whisker is represented in layer 4 (L4) by an anatomically defined unit, termed a “barrel” (Woolsey and Van der Loos, 1970Woolsey T.A. Van der Loos H. The structural organization of layer IV in the somatosensory region (SI) of mouse cerebral cortex. The description of a cortical field composed of discrete cytoarchitectonic units.Brain Res. 1970; 17: 205-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1800) Google Scholar). A cortical “barrel column” can be defined as the vertical thickness of the neocortex laterally bounded by the width of the L4 barrel. Among cortical areas explored in different species, the barrel cortex is unique in offering a precise anatomical definition for a cortical column with clear functional correlates in the underlying synaptic circuits (Bureau et al., 2004Bureau I.

High-probability uniquantal transmission at excitatory synapses in barrel cortex.Science. 2003; 302: 1981-1984Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Tactile sensory information is processed somatotopically within the barrel map, such that deflection of a single whisker initially evokes cortical neuronal activity within its related barrel column (recently reviewed by Petersen, 2007Petersen C.C.H. The functional organization of the barrel cortex.Neuron. 2007; 56: 339-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In order to understand how information is processed in this cortical microcircuit, it will be essential to quantify the underlying synaptic connectivity of the individual neurons. Electrophysiological recordings in brain slices currently provide the highest-resolution technique for analyzing functional synaptic interactions between individual neocortical neurons (Silberberg et al., 2005Silberberg G.

Cortex. 2008; 18: 397-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), but an overall analysis of excitatory synaptic connectivity within an entire cortical column has not yet been attempted. Here, through multiple simultaneous in vitro whole-cell recordings, we specifically and quantitatively investigated the excitatory synaptic circuits of the mouse C2 barrel column. In order to specifically target our microcircuit analysis to the C2 barrel column, each experiment began with intrinsic optical imaging (Grinvald et al., 1986Grinvald A. Lieke E. Frostig R.D. Gilbert C.D. Wiesel T.N. Functional architecture of cortex revealed by optical imaging of intrinsic signals.Nature. 1986; 324: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar) to functionally locate the C2 whisker representation (Ferezou et al., 2006Ferezou I. Bolea S. Petersen C.C.H. Visualizing the cortical representation of whisker touch: voltage-sensitive dye imaging in freely moving mice.Neuron. 2006; 50: 617-629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Under urethane anesthesia, the C2 whisker was repeatedly deflected at 10 Hz for 4 s, which evoked a highly localized hemodynamic response at the location of the C2 barrel column (Figures 1A and 1B). Through alignment of the functional imaging with the surface blood vessels, fluorescent dye was applied to specifically label the C2 barrel column. Parasagittal slices were subsequently prepared with an angle of 35° away from vertical, which was found to be the optimal angle for keeping intact the axonal and dendritic arborizations of neurons in the C2 barrel column. We next screened the brain slices and, in general, only one or two slices were labeled with the fluorescent dye. The brain slice with the brightest fluorescence, locating the C2 barrel column, was selected for electrophysiological recordings (Figure 1C). The somata of individual neurons of the C2 barrel column were visualized using infrared gradient contrast video microscopy. Simultaneous somatic whole-cell recordings were obtained from two to six neurons, allowing investigation of the electrical properties of the neurons and an evaluation of their synaptic connectivity. In the example experiment (Figures 1C–1F), we recorded simultaneously from six pyramidal neurons. By injecting a brief 2 ms depolarizing current pulse, we evoked an action potential (AP) in each of these neurons in turn, while recording the membrane potential of the other neurons. For synaptically coupled excitatory neurons, a presynaptic AP evokes release of glutamate, which opens postsynaptic ionotropic glutamate receptors, resulting in a unitary excitatory postsynaptic potential (uEPSP) measured at the soma. For every presynaptic neuron in a microcircuit containing 6 neurons, there are 5 possible target cells, giving a total of 30 possible synaptic connections. In this example experiment we found 6 synaptic connections out of the possible 30, giving a synaptic connection probability of 20%. Synaptic connectivity differed from experiment to experiment and so, in order to obtain quantitative information, it is clearly important to record from many pairs of neurons. Altogether in this study, we recorded from a total of 2550 neurons specifically located in the mouse C2 barrel column across 322 slices from 307 mice (in a few experiments we recorded from neurons in the C2 barrel column of 2 adjacent slices, both containing bright fluorescent labeling). We tested 8895 possible synaptic connections and we found 909 functional synaptic connections, giving a value of 10.2% as the overall observed connectivity. However, synaptic connectivity was not uniform, but rather depended strongly upon the somatic laminar location of the recorded neurons within the C2 barrel column. We assigned neocortical layer boundaries (Figure 2A) based on both high-contrast micrographs obtained during the electrophysiological experiments (Figure 1C) and post hoc DAPI fluorescence showing locations of cell nuclei (Figures 2B and 2C). DAPI staining was carried out in fixed slices after every experiment together with the staining procedures to reveal the morphology of the recorded neurons. Across 313 slices, we found the following subpial distances (mean ± SEM) for the lower boundaries of the different layers: L1, 128 ± 1 μm; L2, 269 ± 2 μm; L3, 418 ± 3 μm; L4, 588 ± 3 μm; L5A, 708 ± 4 μm; L5B, 890 ± 5 μm; L6, 1154 ± 7 μm. In agreement with previous studies, we found different types of excitatory neurons in different cortical layers (Figure 2A). In L3, L5A, and L5B, we recorded exclusively from pyramidal neurons with a prominent apical dendrite oriented toward the pia. In L2, we additionally recorded from modified pyramidal neurons, in which the apical dendrite was less obvious or horizontally oriented. In L4, most neurons were spiny stellate neurons (82%) with a small fraction of star pyramidal neurons (18%). Most recorded pyramidal neurons in L5A had small tufts in L1 (89%), whereas the apical dendrite of many L5B pyramids bifurcated in L3/4 and had an extensive tuft in L1 (71%). In L6, we recorded from short pyramidal neurons (94%) and inverted pyramidal neurons (6%). Resting membrane potential (Vm), input resistance (Rin), membrane time-constants (Tau), AP threshold, AP amplitude, and rheobase varied across layers (Table 1).Table 1Intrinsic Electrophysiological Properties of Excitatory Neurons in the Mouse C2 Barrel ColumnL2L3L4L5AL5BL6Resting Vm (mV)−72.0 ± 0.3−71.4 ± 0.4−66.0 ± 0.3−62.8 ± 0.2−63.0 ± 0.3−66.8 ± 0.4Rin (MΩ)188 ± 3193 ± 5302 ± 4210 ± 3162 ± 5277 ± 4Tau (ms)28.3 ± 0.330.0 ± 0.634.8 ± 0.537.6 ± 0.625.8 ± 0.728.2 ± 0.5AP threshold (mV)−38.3 ± 0.2−38.7 ± 0.2−39.7 ± 0.2−38.9 ± 0.2−41.1 ± 0.2−40.2 ± 0.3AP amplitude from threshold to peak (mV)72.4 ± 0.473.5 ± 0.570.9 ± 0.470.2 ± 0.573.1 ± 0.569.9 ± 0.5Rheobase (pA)126 ± 3132 ± 456 ± 168 ± 298 ± 376 ± 3Values are mean ± SEM.

To quantify the number of excitatory neurons in different layers of the mouse C2 barrel column, we stained slices with a NeuN antibody to specifically visualize the location of neuronal somata combined with DAPI to locate all nuclei. In order to separately label GABAergic neurons in these anatomical experiments, we used knockin mice expressing GFP from the GAD67 gene locus (Tamamaki et al., 2003Tamamaki N. Yanagawa Y. Tomioka R. Miyazaki J. Obata K. Kaneko T. Green fluorescent protein expression and colocalization with calretinin, parvalbumin, and somatostatin in the GAD67-GFP knock-in mouse.J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 467: 60-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar) (Figures 2B and 2C). NeuN-positive cells lacking GFP labeling were considered as excitatory neurons. We made 3D confocal stacks of 100 μm thick sections of the C2 barrel column for six mice. The number and locations of neuronal somata were found by an automated spot detection algorithm followed by manual correction and verification. The C2 barrel column is ∼300 μm in diameter, and as a first-order approximation for the total number of excitatory neurons in this column, we multiplied the cell counts obtained from the 100 μm thick sections by a factor of three. Our estimates for the mean ± SEM number of excitatory neurons in each layer are as follows: L2, 546 ± 49; L3, 1145 ± 132; L4, 1656 ± 83; L5A, 454 ± 46; L5B, 641 ± 50; L6, 1288 ± 84 (Figure 2D). We estimate the following numbers of GABAergic neurons in different layers of the mouse C2 barrel column (mean ± SEM): L1, 26 ± 8; L2, 107 ± 7; L3, 123 ± 19; L4, 140 ± 9; L5A, 90 ± 14; L5B, 131 ± 6; L6, 127 ± 9 (Figure 2D). We next analyzed the synaptic connectivity with respect to the laminar locations of the somata of both presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. The most prominent excitatory synaptic circuit in the mouse C2 barrel column is formed between neurons within a single L4 barrel (Feldmeyer et al., 1999Feldmeyer D. Egger V. Lübke J. Sakmann B. Reliable synaptic connections between pairs of excitatory layer 4 neurones within a single 'barrel' of developing rat somatosensory cortex.J. Physiol. 1999; 521: 169-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, Petersen and Sakmann, 2000Petersen C.C.H. Sakmann B. The excitatory neuronal network of rat layer 4 barrel cortex.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7579-7586PubMed Google Scholar). In an example experiment (Figure 3A), three spiny stellate neurons were recorded in L4 and large uEPSPs were evoked at each of the six possible L4→L4 synaptic connections in this microcircuit. In this example experiment, we also recorded from two L3 pyramidal neurons and further L4→L3 and L3→L3 synaptic connections were identified. In another example experiment (Figure 3B), the two neurons in L4 were not synaptically coupled, but both provided synaptic input to a neuron in L5A. In this experiment, three L5A neurons were recorded and three synaptic connections were found among these L5A neurons. Altogether within L4, we found 254 excitatory synaptic connections among 1046 tested connections, giving an average probability of any two excitatory L4 neurons being synaptically connected as 24.3% (which we will denote as PL4→L4 = 24.3%). The peak L4→L4 uEPSP amplitudes ranged from 0.06 mV to 7.79 mV (mean ± SEM = 0.95 ± 0.08 mV; median = 0.52 mV) (Table 2). We also quantified the uEPSP kinetics (see Table S1 and Figure S1 available online). Among these synaptically connected pairs of neurons, we found that 59 were reciprocally bidirectionally connected. This is close to the value of 62 reciprocal connections expected for a randomly wired network (given by 24.3% × 24.3% × 1046) (Table S2). However, in other respects the neocortical excitatory synaptic pathways appear far from randomly organized. For example, we found evidence for highly specific patterns of connectivity between L4 and the other layers.

https://openalex.org/W2120144854,"Astrocytes modulate neuronal activity by releasing chemical transmitters via a process termed gliotransmission. The role of this process in the control of behavior is unknown. Since one outcome of SNARE-dependent gliotransmission is the regulation of extracellular adenosine and because adenosine promotes sleep, we genetically inhibited the release of gliotransmitters and asked if astrocytes play an unsuspected role in sleep regulation. Inhibiting gliotransmission attenuated the accumulation of sleep pressure, assessed by measuring the slow wave activity of the EEG during NREM sleep, and prevented cognitive deficits associated with sleep loss. Since the sleep-suppressing effects of the A1 receptor antagonist CPT were prevented following inhibition of gliotransmission and because intracerebroventricular delivery of CPT to wild-type mice mimicked the transgenic phenotype, we conclude that astrocytes modulate the accumulation of sleep pressure and its cognitive consequences through a pathway involving A1 receptors."

To provide a framework for the analysis of chromatin function in Caenorhabditis elegans, we generated a genome-wide map of histone H3 tail methylations. We find that C. elegans genes show distributions of histone modifications that are similar to those of other organisms, with H3K4me3 near transcription start sites, H3K36me3 in the body of genes and H3K9me3 enriched on silent genes. We also observe a novel pattern: exons are preferentially marked with H3K36me3 relative to introns. H3K36me3 exon marking is dependent on transcription and is found at lower levels in alternatively spliced exons, supporting a splicing-related marking mechanism. We further show that the difference in H3K36me3 marking between exons and introns is evolutionarily conserved in human and mouse. We propose that H3K36me3 exon marking in chromatin provides a dynamic link between transcription and splicing."
https://openalex.org/W2090706449,"Influx of Ca(2+) through store-operated Ca(2+) channels (SOCs) is a central component of receptor-evoked Ca(2+) signals. Orai channels are SOCs that are gated by STIM1, a Ca(2+) sensor located in the ER but how it gates and regulates the Orai channels is unknown. Here, we report the molecular basis for gating of Orais by STIM1. All Orai channels are fully activated by the conserved STIM1 amino acid fragment 344-442, which we termed SOAR (the STIM1 Orai activating region). SOAR acts in combination with STIM1 (450-485) to regulate the strength of interaction with Orai1. Activation of Orai1 by SOAR recapitulates all the kinetic properties of Orai1 activation by STIM1. However, mutations of STIM1 within SOAR prevent activation of Orai1 but not co-clustering of STIM1 and Orai1 in response to Ca(2+) store depletion, indicating that STIM1-Orai1 co-clustering is not sufficient for Orai1 activation. An intact carboxy terminus alpha-helicial region of Orai is required for activation by SOAR. Deleting most of the Orai1 amino terminus impaired Orai1 activation by STIM1, but Orai1(Delta1-73) interacted with and was fully activated by SOAR. Accordingly, the characteristic inward rectification of Orai is mediated by an interaction between the polybasic STIM1 (672-685) and a Pro-rich region in the N terminus of Orai1. Hence, the essential properties of Orai1 function can be rationalized by interactions with discrete regions of STIM1."
https://openalex.org/W2000022451,"The generation of cortical projection neurons relies on the coordination of radial migration with branching. Here, we report that the multisubunit histone acetyltransferase Elongator complex, which contributes to transcript elongation, also regulates the maturation of projection neurons. Indeed, silencing of its scaffold (Elp1) or catalytic subunit (Elp3) cell-autonomously delays the migration and impairs the branching of projection neurons. Strikingly, neurons defective in Elongator show reduced levels of acetylated α-tubulin. Reduction of α-tubulin acetylation via expression of a nonacetylatable α-tubulin mutant leads to comparable defects in cortical neurons and suggests that α-tubulin is a target of Elp3. This is further supported by the demonstration that Elp3 promotes acetylation and counteracts HDAC6-mediated deacetylation of this substrate in vitro. Our results uncover α-tubulin as a target of the Elongator complex and suggest that a tight regulation of its acetylation underlies the maturation of cortical projection neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2023147143,"Adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus leads to the incorporation of thousands of new granule cells into the dentate gyrus every month, but its function remains unclear. Here, we present computational evidence that indicates that adult neurogenesis may make three separate but related contributions to memory formation. First, immature neurons introduce a degree of similarity to memories learned at the same time, a process we refer to as pattern integration. Second, the extended maturation and change in excitability of these neurons make this added similarity a time-dependent effect, supporting the possibility that temporal information is included in new hippocampal memories. Finally, our model suggests that the experience-dependent addition of neurons results in a dentate gyrus network well suited for encoding new memories in familiar contexts while treating novel contexts differently. Taken together, these results indicate that new granule cells may affect hippocampal function in several unique and previously unpredicted ways."
https://openalex.org/W2136913089,"Few tools exist to assess replication of chronic pathogens during infection. This has been a considerable barrier to understanding latent tuberculosis, and efforts to develop new therapies generally assume that the bacteria are very slowly replicating or nonreplicating during latency. To monitor Mycobacterium tuberculosis replication within hosts, we exploit an unstable plasmid that is lost at a steady, quantifiable rate from dividing cells in the absence of antibiotic selection. By applying a mathematical model, we calculate bacterial growth and death rates during infection of mice. We show that during chronic infection, the cumulative bacterial burden-enumerating total live, dead and removed organisms encountered by the mouse lung-is substantially higher than estimates from colony-forming units. Our data show that M. tuberculosis replicates throughout the course of chronic infection of mice and is restrained by the host immune system. This approach may also shed light on the replication dynamics of other chronic pathogens."

We imaged hippocampal pyramidal neurons to identify spines of different ages. We then used two-photon glutamate uncaging, whole-cell recording, and Ca2+ imaging to analyze the properties of nascent spines and their older neighbors. New spines expressed glutamate-sensitive currents that were indistinguishable from mature spines of comparable volumes. Some spines exhibited negligible AMPA receptor-mediated responses, but the occurrence of these “silent” spines was uncorrelated with spine age. In contrast, NMDA receptor-mediated Ca2+ accumulations were significantly lower in new spines. New spines reconstructed using electron microscopy made synapses.

The time course over which functional synapses form on individual new spines has not been quantitatively addressed. α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are colocalized at the postsynaptic membrane of most excitatory synapses (Bekkers and Stevens, 1989Bekkers J.M.

Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The relative fraction of AMPA and NMDA receptors changes during development. In the early postnatal cortex a large fraction of hippocampal synapses contain mostly NMDA receptors (“silent synapses”), whereas more mature synapses are dominated by AMPA receptors. Silent synapses can accumulate AMPA-type glutamate receptors in an activity-dependent manner (Durand et al., 1996Durand G.M. Kovalchuk Y. Konnerth A.

Neurosci. 1999; 2: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), a signature of synapse maturation. However, other studies suggest that AMPA and NMDA receptors arrive at hippocampal synapses at approximately the same time (Friedman et al., 2000Friedman H.V. Bresler T. Garner C.C. Ziv N.E.

Wasling P. Hanse E. Gustafsson B. Creation of AMPA-silent synapses in the neonatal hippocampus.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It is therefore unclear if AMPA receptor insertion into silent synapses, or the formation of new synapses with AMPA receptors, accounts for the switch between silent and mature synapses. How quickly do functional glutamate receptors accumulate on new spines? Do AMPA receptors arrive rapidly or after a prolonged delay following new spine formation? How does the arrival of glutamate receptors relate to the formation of anatomically mature synapses? To begin to address these questions, we examined the temporal relationship between spine growth and the accumulation of functional glutamate receptors. We used time-lapse two-photon microscopy of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing hippocampal pyramidal neurons to identify spines of different ages, and then we characterized their functional properties using two-photon glutamate uncaging and electrophysiological measurements. We found that new spines were rapidly competent to respond to glutamate; AMPA receptor-mediated glutamate responses increased with spine age in lock-step with spine volumes. NMDA currents also developed rapidly, although calcium transient amplitudes were lower in new spines. Finally, we found that within a few hours of outgrowth, new spines can participate in ultrastructurally mature synapses. To define the temporal relationship between spine growth and synapse formation, we used time-lapse two-photon microscopy to identify spines of different ages and then characterized their functional properties using two-photon glutamate uncaging and electrophysiological recording. Hippocampal pyramidal neurons in organotypic slice cultures from neonatal rat were transfected at 3–5 days in vitro (DIV) with GFP and imaged using a custom two-photon laser-scanning microscope. Dendrites of GFP-expressing neurons were imaged across multiple time points. By imaging each dendrite three times, we were able to classify spines into three age groups: persistent (>10 hr), new persistent (2–12 hr), and new (<2.5 hr; Figures 1A and 1B). Between image acquisitions, cells were maintained in culture medium at 35°C. By imaging four dendritic segments per neuron (∼200 μm total dendritic length), we consistently identified one to three new spines per cell. Following the final imaging session, we patched the imaged cell and recorded excitatory postsynaptic currents evoked by two-photon photolysis of 4-methoxy-7-nitroindolinyl (MNI)-caged glutamate (Matsuzaki et al., 2001Matsuzaki M. Ellis-Davies G.C. Nemoto T. Miyashita Y. Iino M. Kasai H. Dendritic spine geometry is critical for AMPA receptor expression in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.Nat.

NMDA receptor subunit-dependent [Ca2+] signaling in individual hippocampal dendritic spines.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6037-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) at nascent spines and their neighbors (Figures 1C and 1D). We limited our analysis to spines that were within 160 μm of the soma, well separated (>1 μm) from other spines, and on dendritic segments that were oriented parallel to the surface of the slice. AMPA receptor-mediated whole-cell currents were recorded at −70 mV in the presence of an NMDA receptor blocker (CPP, 5 μM). Uncaging power (60–100 mW in the back focal plane [BFP]) was set to elicit a current of 10–15 pA from a control persistent spine, and then held constant for other spines on the same dendritic segment. The kinetics of uncaging-evoked excitatory currents (uEPSCs) closely matched those of spontaneous miniature EPSCs recorded from the same cell (Sobczyk et al., 2005Sobczyk A. Scheuss V. Svoboda K. NMDA receptor subunit-dependent [Ca2+] signaling in individual hippocampal dendritic spines.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6037-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) (Figure S1, available online). uEPSC amplitudes ranged from 2 to 21 pA for persistent spines (n = 37), 1 to 17 pA for new persistent spines (n = 16), and 2 to 13 pA for new spines (n = 12; Figure S2A). Because of a broad range of depths in the brain slices (∼20–60 μm) and the heterogeneous milieu in the tissue surrounding GFP-transfected cells, the efficiency of glutamate uncaging differed for dendrites recorded in different preparations. Therefore, to compare data across multiple cells recorded in different brain slices, we normalized uEPSC amplitudes from each spine to the average uEPSC amplitude of all persistent and new persistent spines on the same dendrite. Normalized uEPSC amplitudes of persistent (1.02 ± 0.07) and new persistent (0.95 ± 0.09) spines were not significantly different (p > 0.5; Figure 1E). In contrast, new spines had significantly smaller normalized uEPSC amplitudes (0.75 ± 0.1) than those of persistent and new persistent spines (p < 0.05; Figure 1E). We estimated the currents contributed by AMPA receptors on dendritic shafts (including possible shaft synapses) by uncaging at similar distances from the shaft as before, but now in the absence of a spine. Normalized uEPSC amplitudes of new spines (0.75 ± 0.1) were significantly larger than those of dendrites (0.22 ± 0.05; p < 0.001; n = 8; Figure S3A). For a subset of spines (3 persistent, 2 new persistent, and 3 new), uEPSC amplitudes were within 2 standard deviations (SD) of the expected dendritic currents; these spines could lack AMPA receptor clusters. Yet rise times (stimulus to peak) for all but 3 (1 persistent, 1 new persistent, and 1 new) of these 8 spines were within 2 SD (1.8 ms) of the mean rise time (3.8 ms) of persistent spines with significant uEPSC amplitudes, suggesting that most of these small responses arise from AMPA receptors on the spine. Because earlier studies suggested that uEPSC amplitude is proportional to spine volume (Matsuzaki et al., 2001Matsuzaki M. Ellis-Davies G.C. Nemoto T. Miyashita Y. Iino M. Kasai H. Dendritic spine geometry is critical for AMPA receptor expression in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons.Nat.

NMDA receptor subunit-dependent [Ca2+] signaling in individual hippocampal dendritic spines.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6037-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), we wondered whether the smaller uEPSC amplitudes seen in new spines reflected smaller spine volumes. We used brightness as a measure of relative spine volume (Nimchinsky et al., 2004Nimchinsky E.A. Yasuda R. Oertner T.G. Svoboda K. The number of glutamate receptors opened by synaptic stimulation in single hippocampal spines.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2054-2064Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Brightness values (maximum pixel intensities) for each spine were normalized to the mean value for all persistent and new persistent spines on the same dendrite. Normalized volumes of new spines (0.77 ± 0.07) were significantly smaller than those of persistent (1.03 ± 0.05) and new persistent (0.94 ± 0.07) spines (p < 0.01; Figure 1F). By plotting normalized uEPSC amplitudes against normalized volumes, we indeed observed that new spines respond to glutamate at levels comparable to persistent spines of similar volumes (Figure 1G). To determine the time course of functional spine maturation, we performed acute imaging experiments in which dendrites of GFP-transfected hippocampal pyramidal neurons were imaged every 10–12 min at 35°C until a new spine formed (Figure 2A). Immediately after the final time point, we patched the imaged cell and measured uEPSCs at new spines and their neighbors (Figure 2B). uEPSC amplitudes ranged from 2 to 9 pA for these “early” new spines (n = 8) and 1 to 18 pA (n = 31) for neighboring control spines (Figure S2B). Normalized uEPSC amplitudes of early new spines (0.68 ± 0.19) were smaller than those of control spines (1.0 ± 0.10; p < 0.1; one-tailed t test; Figure 2C). Consistent with the hypothesis that smaller response amplitudes of early new spines are correlated with smaller spine size, we found that new spines had correspondingly smaller normalized volumes (0.62 ± 0.13) than control spines (1.00 ± 0.08; p < 0.05). By plotting normalized uEPSC amplitudes against normalized volume, we observed that even very young new spines respond to glutamate at levels comparable to persistent spines of similar volumes (Figure 2D). Normalized uEPSC amplitudes of early new spines (0.68 ± 0.19) were significantly larger than those of dendrites (0.25 ± 0.10; p < 0.05; n = 6; Figure S3B); however, for a subset of spines (13 control and 4 new), uEPSC amplitudes were within 2 SD of the expected dendritic currents. Rise times (stimulus to peak) for all but 3 (2 control and 1 new) of these 17 spines were within 2 SD (2.4 ms) of the mean rise time (4.7 ms) for control spines with significant uEPSC amplitudes, suggesting that most of these small responses arise from AMPA receptors on spines. We estimated spine age as half of the interval between the time point at which the spine was first observed and the time point immediately prior. The median age of new spines was 35 min in the acute imaging experiments and 1.8 hr in the chronic imaging experiments. As spine age increased, spines grew in volume, and AMPA receptor current amplitudes increased (Figure 2E). The proportional relationship between spine volume and AMPA current amplitudes is retained across spines of all age categories (p > 0.4 for all pairwise relationships; Figure 2F). We found no evidence that spine outgrowth and the accumulation of AMPA receptors were separated in time by more than a few tens of minutes (Figures 1G and 2D). Our data are consistent with a model whereby functional AMPA receptors accumulate rapidly in new spines as spine size increases. In addition to synaptic glutamate receptors in the postsynaptic density, the spine membrane likely contains a lower density of extrasynaptic receptors (Figure 2G). What are the contributions of these extrasynaptic receptors to uEPSCs? Assuming a uniform distribution of extrasynaptic receptors, we calculated the relationship between the number of activated receptors and spine head volume for situations with different fractions of synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Our data are consistent with synaptic receptors providing most of the response. Based on reconstructed dendritic segments from SSEM (see Figure 5), we further estimated the fraction of total receptors that would have to be extrasynaptic to produce substantial responses when stimulating spines (Experimental Procedures). These calculations show that if extrasynaptic receptors contributed substantially (>20%) to uEPSCs, then the vast majority (>80%) of receptors would have to be extrasynaptic (Figure 2H). This contradicts AMPA receptor distributions measured with immuno-electron microscopy (e.g., Baude et al., 1995Baude A. Nusser Z. Molnar E. McIlhinney R.A. Somogyi P.

We conclude that new spines contain synaptic glutamate receptors. We next probed the relationship between spine growth and the accumulation of NMDA receptors. As before, we used time-lapse two-photon microscopy to identify spines of different ages (Figure 3A) and then measured their NMDA receptor-mediated responses using two-photon glutamate uncaging combined with simultaneous calcium imaging and electrophysiological recording (Figures 3B–3E). Immediately after time-lapse imaging, neurons were patched and loaded with Ca2+-sensitive (green, Fluo-5F; Figures 3B and 3C, top row) and Ca2+-insensitive (red, Alexa 594; Figures 3B and 3C, bottom row) fluorophores. To ensure a linear relationship of [Ca2+] and fluorescence while minimizing saturation of the calcium indicator, we used a high concentration (1 mM) of the medium-affinity (KD ∼1.6 μM) indicator Fluo-5F (Sabatini et al., 2002Sabatini B.L.

Imaging calcium concentration dynamics in small neuronal compartments.Sci. STKE. 2004; 2004: pl5PubMed Google Scholar). NMDA receptor-mediated whole-cell currents (Figure 3D) and calcium transients (Figure 3E) were recorded in low extracellular Mg2+ (0.1 mM) at −70 mV, and in the presence of drugs that block AMPA receptors (NBQX, 10 μM) and calcium release from internal stores (20 μM ryanodine and 1 μM thapsigargin). We used focal photolysis of MNI-glutamate to stimulate individual spines. Uncaging power (60–100 mW in the BFP) was set to elicit currents of 5–8 pA from a control persistent spine, and then held constant for the remainder of that dendritic segment. The amplitude of [Ca2+] transients (dG/R; Figure 3E) was calculated as the change in green fluorescence (ΔG) normalized by the red fluorescence (R) within regions of interest containing the spine head (Figures 3B and 3C). NMDA current amplitudes ranged from 2 to 17 pA for persistent spines (n = 25), 4 to 6 pA for new persistent spines (n = 5), and 2 to 8 pA for new spines (n = 7; Figure S2C). There was no significant difference between normalized NMDA current amplitudes of persistent (1.04 ± 0.07), new persistent (0.94 ± 0.1), and new (0.87 ± 0.1) spines (p > 0.25; Figure 3F). Normalized uEPSC amplitudes from new spines were significantly larger than those of dendrites (0.26 ± 0.08; p < 0.001; n = 5; Figure S3C). However, for a small subset of spines (2 persistent and 1 new), uEPSC amplitudes were within 2 SD of the expected dendritic currents; these spines could lack NMDA receptor clusters. Our data confirm previous reports that NMDA-receptor-mediated current amplitudes are relatively constant across spines of different volumes (Noguchi et al., 2005Noguchi J. Matsuzaki M.

Furthermore, like AMPA receptors, NMDA receptors accumulate rapidly at nascent spines. Despite having similar NMDA currents, new spines had significantly smaller normalized calcium transient amplitudes (0.54 ± 0.10) than neighboring persistent (1.04 ± 0.12) and new persistent (0.94 ± 0.15) spines (p < 0.05; Figure 3H).

Here, we show that spectral components that are well separated in frequency are no longer heard as separate streams if presented synchronously rather than consecutively. In contrast, responses from neurons in primary auditory cortex of ferrets show that both synchronous and asynchronous tone sequences produce comparably segregated responses along the tonotopic axis. The results argue against tonotopic separation per se as a neural correlate of stream segregation. Instead we propose a computational model of stream segregation that can account for the data by using temporal coherence as the primary criterion for predicting stream formation.

When listening to someone at a crowded cocktail party, or trying to follow the second violin line in a symphonic orchestra, we rely on our ears' and brain's extraordinary ability to parse complex acoustic scenes into individual auditory “objects” or “streams” (Griffiths and Warren, 2004Griffiths T.D. Warren J.D. What is an auditory object?.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 887-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Just as the decomposition of a visual scene into objects is a challenging and mathematically ill-posed problem, requiring top-down and bottom-up information to solve (Marr, 1983Marr D. Vision. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco1983Google Scholar, Zeki, 1993Zeki S. Vision of the Brain. Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford1993Google Scholar), the auditory system uses a combination of acoustic cues and prior experience to analyze the auditory scene. A simple example of auditory streaming (Bregman, 1990Bregman A. Auditory Scene Analysis. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1990Crossref Google Scholar, Carlyon, 2004Carlyon R.P. How the brain separates sounds.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2004; 8: 465-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) can be demonstrated and explored in the laboratory using sound sequences like those illustrated in Figure 1. These sequences are produced by presenting two tones of different frequencies, A and B, repeatedly (Figure 1A). Many psychophysical studies have shown that this simple stimulus can evoke two very different percepts, depending on the frequency separation, ΔF, between the A and B tones, and the time interval, ΔT, between successive tones (for a review, see Bregman, 1990Bregman A. Auditory Scene Analysis. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1990Crossref Google Scholar). In particular, when ΔF is relatively small (<10%), most listeners perceive and describe the stimulus as a single stream of tones alternating in frequency, like a musical trill. However, when ΔF is large, the percept is that of two parallel but separate streams, each containing only tones of the same frequency (A-A- and B-B-; see Supplemental Data available online for an auditory demonstration). The perceptual separation of sound components into distinct streams is usually referred to as stream segregation; the converse process is variously known as stream integration, grouping, or fusion. Manifestations of auditory streaming have been observed in various nonhuman species, including birds, fish, and monkeys, suggesting that streaming is a fundamental aspect of auditory perception, which plays a role in adaptation to diverse ecological environments (Bee and Micheyl, 2008Bee M.A. Micheyl C.

Inspired by the observation that frequency-to-place mapping, or tonotopy, is a guiding anatomical and functional principle throughout the auditory system (Eggermont, 2001Eggermont J.J.

An Introduction to the Physiology of Hearing.Second Edition. Academic Press, London1988Google Scholar), current models of auditory streaming rely primarily on frequency separation for sound segregation (Beauvois and Meddis, 1991Beauvois M.W. Meddis R.

Soc. Am. 1997; 101: 1611-1621Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These models predict that consecutive sounds will be grouped perceptually into a single auditory stream if they activate strongly overlapping tonotopic channels in the auditory system. In contrast, sounds that have widely different spectra will activate weakly overlapping (or nonoverlapping) channels, and be perceptually segregated (i.e., heard as separate streams). In this way, models based on tonotopic separation can account for behavioral findings that show an increase in perceived segregation with increasing frequency separation (Hartmann and Johnson, 1991Hartmann W. Johnson D. Stream segregation and peripheral channeling.Music Percept. 1991; 9: 155-184Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar). By additionally taking into account neural adaptation and forward suppression of responses to consecutive tones, these models can also account for the influence of temporal stimulus parameters, such as the intertone interval or the time since sequence onset, on auditory streaming (Beauvois and Meddis, 1991Beauvois M.W.

Perceptual organization of sound begins in the auditory periphery.Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1124-1128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Although tonotopic separation is important, it is clearly not the only determinant of auditory perceptual organization. Another factor is the relative timing of sounds. Sounds that start and end at the same time are more likely to be perceived as a single event than sounds whose onsets and offsets are staggered by several tens or hundreds of milliseconds (Darwin and Carlyon, 1995Darwin C.J. Carlyon R.P. Auditory grouping.in: Moore B.C.J. Hearing. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1995: 387-424Crossref Google Scholar). Accordingly, if the AB tone pairs were presented synchronously (as in Figure 1B) instead of sequentially (as in Figure 1A), they might form a single perceptual stream, even at large frequency separations. This prediction poses a serious problem for purely tonotopic models of auditory streaming. Unfortunately, nearly all perceptual studies of auditory streaming so far have used strictly sequential, temporally nonoverlapping, stimuli (Figure 1A), although one informal description of an experiment involving partially overlapping stimuli exists (Bregman, 1990Bregman A. Auditory Scene Analysis. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1990Crossref Google Scholar, page 213). On the physiological side, it is unclear how synchrony affects neural responses in the primary auditory cortex (AI), where previous studies have identified potential neural correlates of auditory streaming using purely nonoverlapping stimuli (Fishman et al., 2001Fishman Y.I.

Neurophysiol. 2007; 97: 2230-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The complexity of auditory cortical responses makes it difficult to predict how responses of single AI units will be influenced by stimulus synchrony: depending on the position of the tones relative to the unit's best frequency, responses might be facilitated (i.e., enhanced), inhibited (i.e., reduced), or left unchanged by the synchronous presentation of a second tone within the unit's excitatory receptive field. Here we use a combination of psychophysics in humans, cortical physiology in ferret, and computational modeling to address these questions. We first report psychoacoustic findings, which reveal that synchronous and nonsynchronous sound sequences are perceived very differently, with synchronous tone sequences heard as a single stream, even at very large frequency separations. We then present physiological findings that show synchronous and nonsynchronous tone sequences evoke very similar tonotopic activation patterns in AI. Together, these findings challenge the current view that tonotopic separation in AI is necessary and sufficient for perceptual stream segregation. Finally, we describe a computational model of stream segregation that uses the temporal coherence of responses across tonotopic (or other) neural channels to predict perception, and demonstrate that this model can account for the present and other psychophysical findings. By combining simultaneous and sequential perceptual organization principles that have traditionally been studied separately, the model proposed here provides a new and more general account of auditory perceptual organization of any arbitrary sound combinations. More generally, the present findings suggest that the principle of grouping information across sensory channels based on temporal coherence may play a key role in auditory perceptual organization, just as has been proposed for visual scene analysis (Blake and Lee, 2005Blake R. Lee S.H. The role of temporal structure in human vision.Behav. Cogn. Neurosci. Rev. 2005; 4: 21-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Informal listening to sound sequences like those illustrated in Figure 1A reveals that, for relatively large frequency separations between the A and B tones (e.g., six semitones or more), the alternating-tone sequence (Figure 1A) usually evokes a percept of two separate streams, each with a constant pitch (A-A- and B-B-). In contrast, the sequence of synchronous tones (Figure 1B) evokes the percept of a single stream, even at large ΔFs. To confirm and quantify this subjective impression, we asked listeners to discriminate between two sequences similar to those shown in Figure 1B, except that in one of those two sequences, the last B tone was slightly shifted temporally (forward or backward) so that it was no longer exactly synchronous with the corresponding A tone. We measured the smallest temporal shift that listeners could correctly detect 79.4% of the time. Based on earlier results indicating that listeners can detect onset shifts of as little as a few milliseconds between spectral components of complex tones (Zera and Green, 1993aZera J. Green D.M.

Auditory sequence: confusion of patterns other than speech or music.Science. 1969; 164: 586-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), we reasoned that if listeners heard the A and B tones as a single fused stream, their thresholds in the asynchrony detection task would be relatively small (i.e., a few milliseconds), whereas if the listeners perceived the A and B tones as two separate streams, their thresholds should be substantially larger. The results shown in Figure 2 (filled squares) support these predictions. In the condition where all the A and B tones before the last were synchronous (with intertone intervals of 50 ms), thresholds were small, in the 2–4 ms range. This is true at all of the three A-B frequency separations tested, including the very large one (15 semitones, which is larger than an octave). This outcome is consistent with the hypothesis that synchrony between the A and B tones promotes the perceptual integration of these tones into a single stream, even for relatively large frequency separations. The different symbols indicate different sequence types, which are represented schematically in the inset. Polygonal symbols correspond to sequences of A and B tones, with the duration of the silent gap between consecutive A tones set to 30, 50, or 70 ms, as indicated in the legend. Note that because the duration of the silent gap between consecutive B tones (excluding the last two) was kept constant at 50 ms, the use of a 50 ms gap for the A tones yielded synchronous A and B tones with identical tempi; in contrast, when the gap between consecutive A tones was equal to 30 or 70 ms, these tones were not synchronous with the B tones, and had a different (slower or faster) tempo. Crosses are used to indicate the results of a control condition, in which the A tones were turned off, and the listener's task was to indicate in which of the two presented sequences of B tones the last tone was shifted in time, creating an heterochrony. The numbers on the abscissa indicate the frequency separation between the A and B tones, in semitones. For the control condition in which only the B tones were present, this parameter was used to determine the frequency of the B tones so that it was equal to that used in corresponding conditions where A tones were also present. The error bars are geometric standard errors. To check that thresholds in the asynchrony-detection task provided a valid marker of the listener's auditory percept of streaming, three control conditions were run. The first two control conditions involved stimulus sequences in which the silent gap between consecutive B tones was either shorter (30 ms) or longer (70 ms) than that between consecutive A tones (50 ms), but with the stimulus parameters chosen such that the last A and B tones in one of the two stimulus sequences presented on a given trial would be synchronous (see Figure 2 inset). If thresholds in the asynchrony detection task are a faithful indicator of the listener's auditory percept, these thresholds should be larger in these control conditions than in the main condition because (1) the asynchrony between the A and B tones would promote the perceptual segregation of the stimulus sequence into two separate streams, and (2) stream segregation should hamper listeners' ability to accurately compare the timing of the A and B tones in that pair. The aim of the third control condition was to measure listeners' sensitivity to changes in the timing of the last B tone, even when the A tones were not present. We turned off the A tones and asked listeners to decide in which of the two presented sequences of (B only) tones the last tone was temporally shifted (either backward or forward, as in the main experiment). Therefore, in this control condition, listeners had to detect which of two presented sequences of B tones contained a temporal irregularity near the end. Considerably larger thresholds (10–20 ms) were observed in the two control experiments, where the nominal duration of the intertone interval in the A tone stream was different from that in the B tone stream, being either shorter (30 ms) or longer (70 ms) [F(1,10) = 7.394, p < 0.001]. This outcome is consistent with the idea that asynchrony between the A and B tones promotes the perceptual segregation into two streams and makes it difficult, if not impossible, to accurately judge the timing of events in separate streams. In fact, the thresholds measured in those conditions were not significantly different from those measured in the third control condition, in which the A tones were turned off, so that the only cue listeners could use to perform the task was to listen for an irregularity in the timing of the B tone stream. This indicates that listeners were able to use the presence of the A tones to improve performance only when the A tones were all gated synchronously with the B tones. Overall, the psychophysical results confirm that synchronous and asynchronous tone sequences produce very different percepts, with the synchronous tones being perceived as a single stream and the asynchronous tones being perceived as two streams at large frequency separations. The psychophysical results raise the question of whether neural responses to sequences of synchronous and sequential tones in the central auditory system differ in a way that can account for their very different percepts. To answer this question, we performed two experiments in which we recorded the single-unit responses in AI to sequences such as those illustrated in Figure 1 in the awake (nonbehaving) ferret. In the first experiment, we explored directly the extent of segregation between the responses to the A and B tones. In the second experiment, we assessed the range of frequencies over which the tones interacted (or mutually influenced their responses). This experiment examined the distribution of responses to the two tones by translating them together, relative to the best frequency (BF) of an isolated single unit in AI of awake ferrets in five steps (labeled 1–5 in Figure 3A ), where positions 1 and 5 correspond to one of the two tones being at BF of the unit. The frequency separation (ΔF) between the tones in each test was fixed at 1, 0.5, or 0.25 octaves, corresponding to 12, 6, and 3 semitones, respectively. As described previously, alternating tone sequences are usually perceived as two streams at separations of 12 and 6 semitones (1 or 0.5 octaves), but are only marginally segregated at a separation of 3 semitones (0.25 octaves). In contrast, synchronous tone sequences are always heard as one stream (Figure 2). Therefore, if the spatial segregation hypothesis were valid, alternating sequences should evoke well-segregated neural responses to the far-apart tones (1 and 0.5 octaves), whereas synchronous sequences should evoke spatially overlapping responses in all cases. Both alternating and synchronous tone sequences were tested in all conditions. (A) Experiment I: The two tone frequencies were held fixed at one of three intervals apart (ΔF = 0.25, 0.5, 1 octaves), and then shifted through five equally spaced positions relative to the BF of the isolated cell. (B) Experiment II: Tone A is fixed at the BF of the isolated unit, and tone B is shifted closer to BF in several steps. The results from a population of 122 units in the AI of four ferrets are shown in Figure 4. In Figure 4A, the average rate profiles for the synchronous, overlapping, and alternating presentation modes are constructed from the responses as described in Methods. All 122 units were tested with the synchronous and alternating modes; 75/122 units were also tested with the overlapping sequences. When the tones are far apart (ΔF = 1 octave; right panel of Figure 4A), responses are strongest when either tone is near BF (positions 1 and 5); they diminish considerably when the BF is midway between the tones (position 3), suggesting relatively good spatial separation between the representations of each tone. When the tones are closely spaced (ΔF = 0.25 octave; left panel of Figure 4A), the responses remain relatively strong at all positions, suggesting that the representations of the two tones are not well separated. More importantly, the average rate profiles are similar for all presentation modes: in all cases, the responses are well-segregated with significant dips when the tones are far apart (ΔF = 1 octave), and poorly separated (no dips) when the tones are closely spaced (ΔF = 0.25 octaves). Thus, based on average rate responses, the neural data mimic the perception of the asynchronous but not the synchronous tone sequences. Therefore, the distribution of average rate responses does not appear to represent a general neural correlate of auditory streaming. The two tones were shifted relative to the BF of the cell in five equal steps, from tone B being at BF (position 1) to tone A at BF (position 5), as described in experiment I paradigm. (A) Average firing rates from a total of 122 single units in the five frequency positions in the synchronous and nonoverlapping modes. Overlapping tones were tested in only 75/122 units. Error bars are standard errors. Responses in all presentation modes exhibited a significant dip in response when tones were further apart (0.5 and 1 octaves), and neither was at BF (shaded positions 2–4). (B) The percentage of cells that exhibited a significant dip in their responses were similar in the two extreme presentation modes (synchronous and nonoverlapping alternating). Only the 66 single units that were tested at all five positions were included in this analysis (as responses from all positions are necessary to compile such histograms). The magnitude of dip showed significant difference across ΔF but nonsignificant difference across presentation mode. Error bars represent standard errors. Instead of averaging the responses from all cells, we tabulated the number of cells indicating a significant segregation in the responses (implying a percept of two streams) or no segregation (a percept of one stream) by examining whether a significant dip occurred in each cell's profile during the two extreme presentation modes (synchronous versus alternating tones). The determination of a dip was derived for each condition by finding a significant difference (one-tailed t test; p < 0.025) between the distributions of the maximum response at either of the BF sites (1 or 5) compared with the minimum response at any of the non-BF sites (2, 3, or 4). For the purposes of this analysis, we used a population of 66 units for which positions 1 or 5 were BF sites, and measurements were completed at all positions (1–5). In most experiments, several units with diverse BFs were recorded simultaneously with multiple electrodes, and hence it was only possible to match the tone frequencies to the BF of one or two of the cells. The percentage of cells with a significant dip in their profiles is shown in the histograms of Figure 4B. We also calculated the magnitude of the dip (see Experimental Procedures) for each unit and established that there was no significant difference in neural responses between synchronous and alternating modes (two-tailed t test, p = 0.54 at 0.25 octave, p = 0.37 at 0.5 octave, and p = 0.42 at 1 octave), and that spatial segregation increases significantly with increasing ΔF (one-tailed t test, shown in Figure 4B). The results show that (1) segregation is strongest at 1 octave separation and weakest at 0.25 octaves, and that (2) there is little difference between the patterns of responses to the synchronous and alternating sequences. Thus, this alternative individual-cell response measure also fails to predict the different streaming percepts of the alternating and synchronous tones. The key question of interest in this experiment was whether the range of interactions between the two tones was significantly different in the three presentation modes (alternating, overlapping, or synchronous). We measured the frequency range of interactions between the two tones by fixing tone A at the BF of the isolated unit, while placing tone B at ±1/3, ±2/3, ±1, ±1.5, and ±2 octaves around the BF (Figure 3B). We also estimated the unit's frequency tuning by measuring the isointensity response curve with a single tone sequence (curve with open diamonds in Figure 5A ). Other methodological details can be found in Experimental Procedures. (A) The tuning near the BF averaged from all units. The average isointensity response curve is with open diamonds for comparison. To increase the number of cells included in the average, we folded the responses from above and below BF, but included only units that were tested with the entire two-octave range from BF. Error bars are standard errors. All presentation modes show some suppression of responses as tone A approaches the BF (1–1.5 octaves), and a significant increase closer to BF (about 1 octave, marked by asterisks). (B) Histogram of the difference in bandwidth of interactions between the tones during the two extreme presentation modes (synchronous and alternating) is roughly symmetric, indicating no systematic bias in the scatter. The average spike counts are shown in Figure 5A from a population of 64 single units (in the synchronous and alternating modes) and 41 units (overlapping mode) that were recorded separately from experiment I. All data were combined by computing the isointensity response curve of each unit, centering it around the BF of the unit, and normalizing it by the response of the unit to the single BF tone. We then kept only the half of the tuning curve above or below the BF from which the full two-octave range was tested. Such (half-tuning) curves from all units were then averaged for each condition. The results highlight the interactions observed as the tones approached each other in frequency. For instance, when tone B was far from tone A at BF (e.g., at ±2 octaves), the effects of the B tone on the cell are relatively small, and the firing rate in all modes was similar to that of the single tone at BF (the normalized rate of 1, indicated by the dotted line). As tone B approached BF, the responses become modulated, first decreasing and then increasing steeply beyond about one octave on either side of the BF. Apart from differences in absolute firing rates, the pattern of interactions was similar in all three presentation modes. For example, the frequency separations at which significant interactions ensue are similar, implying that the units' receptive fields (or their tuning curves) are similar whether they are driven by synchronous, alternating, or partially overlapping sequences. To further quantify the population responses, we computed the effective bandwidth of interactions for each unit, defined as the furthest frequency on either side of the BF at which response interactions between the two tones were significant (see Experimental Procedures). The data from all units in the synchronous and alternating (nonoverlapping) modes are displayed in the histogram of the differences between the two measured ranges in Figure 5B. The scatter is mostly symmetric, with a mean not significantly different from zero (two-tailed t test, p = 1). Hence, the bandwidth differences for individual units fail once more to account for the different streaming percepts evoked by the alternating and synchronous presentation modes. Similar comparisons were also performed for the overlapping versus synchronous and overlapping versus alternating modes. The bandwidth differences in both cases were also mostly symmetric, with a mean not significantly different from zero. The results from the two physiological experiments in awake ferrets contradict the hypothesis that segregation of AI responses to two-tone sequences is sufficient to predict their perceptual streaming. Instead, our findings reveal that synchronous and nonsynchronous sequences do not differ appreciably in the spatial representations of their temporally averaged responses in AI despite the substantial differences in their streaming percepts. Clearly a model that is successfully able to predict perception from these neural data will need to incorporate the time dimension."

The perception of others' pain in patients with congenital insensitivity to pain.Brain. 2006; 129: 2494-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), we found that CIP patients globally underestimated the pain of others when emotional cues were lacking, and that their pain judgments, in contrast with those of control subjects, were strongly related to interindividual differences in empathy trait. Here, we used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the neural correlates of empathy for pain in a group of 13 CIP patients and a control group of 13 healthy subjects. Participants were scanned while observing body parts in painful situations (Experiment 1) or facial expressions of pain (Experiment 2), and were instructed to imagine how the person in the picture feels. We anticipated that CIP patients, deprived as they are of the depicted pain experiences, would show decreased activation in regions supposedly involved in automatic resonance to others' pain, including the anterior insula (AI) and anterior mid-cingulate cortex (aMCC) (Singer et al., 2004Singer T.

In addition, we predicted that the patients' effort to build a representation of others' pain might engage brain areas known to be involved in emotional perspective taking, especially midline structures such as medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices (Ochsner et al., 2005Ochsner K.N.

Such engagement of neural processes supporting emotional inference was expected to depend both on the presence or absence of emotional cues during the task and on the empathic abilities of the observer. CIP patients and control subjects did not differ significantly in terms of self-rated empathy, as assessed by both the Balanced Emotional Empathy Scale (BEES) (Mehrabian, 1997Mehrabian A.

In agreement with previous results (Danziger et al., 2006Danziger N. Prkachin K.M. Willer J.C. Is pain the price of empathy? The perception of others' pain in patients with congenital insensitivity to pain.Brain. 2006; 129: 2494-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), pain intensity ratings of pictures depicting body parts in painful situations (Experiment 1) were lower in CIP patients, while the propensity to infer pain from facial expressions (Experiment 2) did not differ between the two groups. Arousal scores for pictures showing painful situations (Experiment 1) did not differ between CIP patients and control subjects. The observation of body parts in painful situations (contrasted with nonpainful situations) resulted in a similar brain activity pattern in CIP patients and control subjects. In each group, the activated regions corresponded to the neural network observed in previous studies on the perception of others' pain (for review, see Jackson et al., 2006Jackson P.L. Rainville P. Decety J. To what extent do we share the pain of others? Insight from the neural bases of pain empathy.Pain. 2006; 125: 5-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), including bilateral AI, aMCC, and bilateral posterior parietal cortices (Figure 1A; Table 2). (A) Viewing pictures of body parts in painful situations contrasted with viewing nonpainful situations (Experiment 1). In both control subjects and CIP patients, a significant increase of BOLD signal was observed in particular in bilateral operculo-insular (op-ins) cortices, anterior mid-cingulate cortex (aMCC), and bilateral inferior parietal lobule (IPL). (B) Viewing facial expressions of pain contrasted with viewing neutral facial expressions (Experiment 2). A significant increase of BOLD signal was observed in the left (L) insula and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in both groups. The activation of the mid-cingulate cortex was observed in the control group but did not reach significance in the CIP group. Coordinates (mm) are in MNI space. R, right; L, left; ant, anterior; post, posterior; ∗p < 0.05, FDR corrected; ∗∗p < 0.01, FDR corrected. No brain area was found to be differently activated between the two groups in the [Painful − Nonpainful] contrast, even when the significance threshold was lowered to p < 0.001 uncorrected at the voxel level. On the other hand, between-group comparison of the [Painful − Baseline] contrast revealed significantly lower activation of visual occipito-temporal cortices bilaterally in the CIP group as compared with those of the control group (Table S1 available online). No correlation was found between brain activity and ratings of pain intensity in either group. In the control group, bilateral caudate, aMCC, and left AI activities were significantly correlated with the arousal score (Table 3), while no correlation with the arousal score was found in the CIP group. Analysis of group x covariate interactions showed a significantly greater correlation coefficient between left caudate and aMCC activities and the arousal score in the control group as compared with that of the CIP group (Table 3). Note: no significant correlation was found in the CIP group. Coordinates (mm) are in MNI space. R, right; L, left; ant, anterior; post, posterior; k, voxels number in the cluster. Probabilities at the cluster level are corrected for multiple comparisons: ∗∗p < 0.001; ∗p < 0.01; and at the voxel level, uncorrected, §p < 0.001. Viewing facial expressions of pain (contrasted with neutral facial expressions) evoked a significant activation in left insula/inferior frontal gyrus in both groups (Figure 1B; Table 4). A significant activation of the mid-cingulate cortex was found in the control group only. Coordinates (mm) are in MNI space. R, right; L, left; ant, anterior; post, posterior; k, voxels number in the cluster. Probabilities at the cluster level are corrected for multiple comparisons: ∗∗p < 0.001; ∗p < 0.01; and at the voxel level, uncorrected, §p < 0.001. Between-group comparison of the [Painful − Nonpainful] contrast showed significantly less activity in occipito-temporal and posterior parietal regions in the CIP group, and between-group comparison of the [Painful − Baseline] contrast showed significantly less activity in occipital and posterior parietal regions in the CIP group (Table S2). Whatever the contrast, activity in the insula and mid-cingulate cortex did not differ significantly between the two groups, even when the significance threshold was lowered to p < 0.001 uncorrected at the voxel level. No correlation was found in either group between brain responses to facial expressions of pain and ratings of pain intensity. In the control group, right precuneus and inferior parietal lobule activities were correlated with the BEES score, but not with any of the IRI scores. In the CIP group, by contrast, the functional activity of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), including pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC), was significantly correlated with both the BEES score and the Empathic Concern score of the IRI, two distinct measures of emotional empathy (Table 5; Figure 2A). Inclusion of anxiety and depression scores as covariates in the analysis did not alter the significance level of these correlations (data not shown). Analysis of group x covariate interactions showed a significantly higher correlation coefficient between pgACC activity and the BEES score in the CIP group as compared with that of the control group (Table 5). BEES, Balanced Emotional Empathy Scale; EC, Empathic Concern subscale of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI). Correlations with empathy trait were considered only when brain activity was significantly correlated with both the BEES score and at least one of the four scores of the IRI; following this criteria, significant correlations between brain activity and empathy trait were found only in the CIP group, not in the control group. Coordinates (mm) are in MNI space. R, right; L, left; k, voxels number in the cluster. Probabilities at the cluster level are corrected for multiple comparisons: ∗∗p < 0.001 ; ∗p < 0.05; and at the voxel level, uncorrected, §p < 0.001, $p < 0.005. (A) Correlation between empathy trait and the hemodynamic responses to pictures of body parts in painful situations (Experiment 1). In the CIP group (but not in the control group), ventromedial prefrontal responses (parameter estimates, ordinate) are strongly and positively correlated with the Balanced Emotional Empathy Scale (BEES) score (abcissa). (B) Correlation between empathy trait and the hemodynamic responses to facial expressions of pain (Experiment 2). In the CIP group (but not in the control group), ventral posterior cingulate cortex responses (parameter estimates, ordinate) are strongly and positively correlated with the BEES score (abcissa). Note: in both experiments, similar correlations were found with the Empathic Concern score of the IRI. In the control group, no significant correlation was found between brain responses to facial expressions of pain and BEES or Empathic Concern scores. In the CIP group, by contrast, ventral posterior cingulate cortex (vPCC) activity was significantly correlated with both of these emotional empathy scores (Table 5; Figure 2B). Inclusion of anxiety and depression scores as covariates in the analysis did not alter the significance level of these correlations (data not shown). Analysis of group x covariate interactions showed a trend toward a higher correlation coefficient between vPCC activity and the BEES score in the CIP group as compared with that of the control group (Table 5). Although CIP patients cannot refer to their own experience of pain to understand how the pain of others feels, they showed normal responses to observed pain in AI and aMCC, two key regions consistently activated by both self and other pain in healthy subjects (Singer et al., 2004Singer T.

Indeed, no group differences were seen in AI and aMCC, whether others' pain was represented from a somatosensory perspective (body parts in painful situations) or from an emotional perspective (facial expressions of pain). These findings challenge the frequently advanced hypothesis that activity in these regions during observed pain corresponds to the automatic engagement of the observer's own pain circuits through a mirror matching mechanism. Rather than specifically reflecting shared representations of pain, AI and aMCC responses to others' pain may relate to the processing of the emotional significance of aversive stimuli in general. A number of studies using a vast variety of emotional stimuli unrelated to pain have shown similar AI and aMCC activations in healthy volunteers (e.g., Morris et al., 1998Morris J.S. Friston K.J. Büchel C. Frith C.D. Young A.W. Calder A.J. Dolan R.J.

Moreover, a recent study suggests that, far from being automatic, such coding of the affective quality of the pain experienced by another person requires an explicit focus on others' pain, as demonstrated by the disappearance of aMCC and AI responses to viewing body parts in painful situations when attention is withdrawn from the pain aspect of the stimuli (Gu and Han, 2007Gu X. Han S. Attention and reality constraints on the neural processes of empathy for pain.Neuroimage. 2007; 36: 256-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the finding of a significant correlation between AI and aMCC (as well as caudate) activities and arousal score in control subjects, but not in CIP patients, suggests that the engagement of these regions during observed pain may be related to different qualities of emotional processing in the two groups. In control subjects, insular and aMCC activation could reflect the generation and/or monitoring of arousal and autonomic changes contributing to the unpleasantness of watching others' pain (Critchley et al., 2000Critchley H.D. Corfield D.R. Chandler M.P. Mathias C.J. Dolan R.J. Cerebral correlates of autonomic cardiovascular arousal: a functional neuroimaging investigation in humans.J.

Affect Neurosci. 2008; 3: 144-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), while less-embodied and more cognitive processes might be at work in CIP patients. One possibility is that despite their lack of sensory experiences of pain, CIP patients may have learned to respond empathetically to others' pain through association mechanisms. Given the involvement of AI and aMCC during both physical pain and the pain of social exclusion (Eisenberger et al., 2003Eisenberger N.I. Lieberman M.D. Williams K.D. Does rejection hurt? An FMRI study of social exclusion.Science. 2003; 302: 290-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (2261) Google Scholar) or grief (Gündel et al., 2003Gündel H. O'Connor M.F. Littrell L. Fort C. Lane R.D. Functional neuroanatomy of grief: an FMRI study.Am. J. Psychiatry. 2003; 160: 1946-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), one might hypothesize, for example, that CIP patients' previous experiences of psychological distress allows them to understand what it means to feel pain (Panksepp, 2003Panksepp J. Feeling the pain of social loss.Science. 2003; 302: 237-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, Danziger and Willer, 2005Danziger N. Willer J.C. Tension-type headache as the unique pain experience of a patient with congenital insensitivity to pain.Pain. 2005; 117: 478-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The lack of significant correlations between AI and aMCC activities and the arousal score in the CIP group suggests that such analogical understanding of others' pain may not be associated with the kind of embodiment observed in healthy subjects, however. In agreement with this assumption, CIP patients, compared with control subjects, exhibited reduced occipito-temporal responses to the sight of others' pain, whether represented from a somatosensory or emotional perspective. In healthy subjects, both valence and arousal are known to contribute to stronger occipito-temporal activation in response to visual stimuli (Lang et al., 1998Lang P.J. Bradley M.M. Fitzsimmons J.R.

Contributions of stimulus valence and arousal to visual activation during emotional perception.Neuroimage. 2003; 20: 1955-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The lesser occipito-temporal activation observed in CIP patients might therefore be associated with reduced emotional salience of pictures with painful content and could indicate impaired immediate affective resonance to others' pain. As a matter of fact, although we did not find any significant between-group difference in arousal scores in the present study, CIP patients did report reduced aversive emotional responses to videos of injury in our previous behavioral study (Danziger et al., 2006Danziger N. Prkachin K.M. Willer J.C. Is pain the price of empathy? The perception of others' pain in patients with congenital insensitivity to pain.Brain. 2006; 129: 2494-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because increased occipito-temporal response to emotional stimuli may result from the modulatory influence of the amygdala (Vuilleumier et al., 2004Vuilleumier P. Richardson M.P. Armony J.L. Driver J. Dolan R.J. Distant influences of amygdala lesion on visual cortical activation during emotional face processing.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 1271-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), lesser amygdala activation would have been expected in the CIP group. However, no amygdala response was found in either group because of Blood Oxygenation Level-Dependent (BOLD) signal loss due to bone artifact (Preston et al., 2004Preston A.R. Thomason M.E. Ochsner K.N. Cooper J.C. Glover G.H. Comparison of spiral-in/out and spiral-out BOLD fMRI at 1.5 and 3 T.Neuroimage. 2004; 21: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Whatever the mode of representation of others' pain, CIP patients showed on average no significant activation in brain regions known to be involved in perspective taking, namely the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), the right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), and adjacent superior temporal sulcus (See Saxe, 2006Saxe R. Uniquely human social cognition.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar for review). However, regression analyses revealed task-specific correlation patterns between emotional empathy scores and activity in mPFC and PCC. In the CIP group (but not in the control group), emotional empathy scores strongly predicted both ventromedial prefrontal responses to pictures of body parts in painful situations and vPCC responses to facial expressions of pain. A number of studies have underlined the role of these midline structures in processes supporting judgments about the emotional"
https://openalex.org/W2001193813,"The repertoire of ∼1200 odorant receptors (ORs) is mapped onto the array of ∼1800 glomeruli in the mouse olfactory bulb (OB). The spatial organization of this array is influenced by the ORs. Here we show that glomerular mapping to broad domains in the dorsal OB is determined by two types of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), which reside in the dorsal olfactory epithelium. The OSN types express either class I or class II OR genes. Axons from the two OSN types segregate already within the olfactory nerve and form distinct domains of glomeruli in the OB. These class-specific anatomical domains correlate with known functional odorant response domains. However, axonal segregation and domain formation are not determined by the class of the expressed OR protein. Thus, the two OSN types are determinants of axonal wiring, operate at a higher level than ORs, and contribute to the functional organization of the glomerular array."
https://openalex.org/W2039526986,"Staphylococcus aureus is an important human commensal and opportunistic pathogen responsible for a wide range of infections. Long chain unsaturated free fatty acids represent a barrier to colonisation and infection by S. aureus and act as an antimicrobial component of the innate immune system where they are found on epithelial surfaces and in abscesses. Despite many contradictory reports, the precise anti-staphylococcal mode of action of free fatty acids remains undetermined. In this study, transcriptional (microarrays and qRT-PCR) and translational (proteomics) analyses were applied to ascertain the response of S. aureus to a range of free fatty acids. An increase in expression of the σB and CtsR stress response regulons was observed. This included increased expression of genes associated with staphyloxanthin synthesis, which has been linked to membrane stabilisation. Similarly, up-regulation of genes involved in capsule formation was recorded as were significant changes in the expression of genes associated with peptidoglycan synthesis and regulation. Overall, alterations were recorded predominantly in pathways involved in cellular energetics. In addition, sensitivity to linoleic acid of a range of defined (sigB, arcA, sasF, sarA, agr, crtM) and transposon-derived mutants (vraE, SAR2632) was determined. Taken together, these data indicate a common mode of action for long chain unsaturated fatty acids that involves disruption of the cell membrane, leading to interference with energy production within the bacterial cell. Contrary to data reported for other strains, the clinically important EMRSA-16 strain MRSA252 used in this study showed an increase in expression of the important virulence regulator RNAIII following all of the treatment conditions tested. An adaptive response by S. aureus of reducing cell surface hydrophobicity was also observed. Two fatty acid sensitive mutants created during this study were also shown to diplay altered pathogenesis as assessed by a murine arthritis model. Differences in the prevalence and clinical importance of S. aureus strains might partly be explained by their responses to antimicrobial fatty acids."

https://openalex.org/W2135945594,"Although action potentials are typically generated in the axon initial segment (AIS), the timing and pattern of action potentials are thought to depend on inward current originating in somatodendritic compartments. Using two-photon imaging, we show that T- and R-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels are colocalized with Na(+) channels in the AIS of dorsal cochlear nucleus interneurons and that activation of these Ca(2+) channels is essential to the generation and timing of action potential bursts known as complex spikes. During complex spikes, where Na(+)-mediated spikelets fire atop slower depolarizing conductances, selective block of AIS Ca(2+) channels delays spike timing and raises spike threshold. Furthermore, AIS Ca(2+) channel block can decrease the number of spikelets within a complex spike and can even block single, simple spikes. Similar results were found in cortex and cerebellum. Thus, voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels at the site of spike initiation play a key role in generating and shaping spike bursts."
https://openalex.org/W2063384908,"The Western Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus often causes devastating or lethal disease. In Europe, the number of human TBE cases has increased dramatically over the last decade, risk areas are expanding and new foci are being discovered every year. The early localisation of new TBE foci and the identification of the main risk factors associated with disease emergence represent a priority for the public health community. Although a number of socio-economic parameters have been suggested to explain TBE upsurges in eastern Europe, the principal driving factors in relatively stable western European countries have not been identified.In this paper, we analyse the correlation between the upsurge of TBE in 17 alpine provinces in northern Italy from 1992 to 2006 with climatic variables, forest structure (as a proxy for small mammal reservoir host abundance), and abundance of the principal large vertebrate tick host (roe deer), using datasets available for the last 40 years. No significant differences between the pattern of changes in climatic variables in provinces where TBE has emerged compared to provinces were no clinical TBE cases have been observed to date. Instead, the best model for explaining the increase in TBE incidence in humans in this area include changes in forest structure, in particular the ratio of coppice to high stand forest, and the density of roe deer.Substantial changes in vegetation structure that improve habitat suitability for the main TBE reservoir hosts (small mammals), as well as an increase in roe deer abundance due to changes in land and wildlife management practices, are likely to be among the most crucial factors affecting the circulation potential of Western TBE virus and, consequently, the risk of TBE emergence in humans in western Europe. We believe our approach will be useful in predicting TBE risk on a wider scale."
https://openalex.org/W1980776509,"The recent discovery of fatty acyl-AMP ligases (FAALs) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) provided a new perspective of fatty acid activation. These proteins convert fatty acids to the corresponding adenylates, which are intermediates of acyl-CoA-synthesizing fatty acyl-CoA ligases (FACLs). Presently, it is not evident how obligate pathogens such as Mtb have evolved such new themes of functional versatility and whether the activation of fatty acids to acyladenylates could indeed be a general mechanism. Here, based on elucidation of the first structure of an FAAL protein and by generating loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutants that interconvert FAAL and FACL activities, we demonstrate that an insertion motif dictates formation of acyladenylate. Because FAALs in Mtb are crucial nodes in the biosynthetic network of virulent lipids, inhibitors directed against these proteins provide a unique multipronged approach to simultaneously disrupting several pathways."

We also theorize that physical and biological processes such as particle shape, size, coating and opsonization that affect MP clearance of debris and microbes can be harnessed to facilitate uptake of nanoparticles (NP) and tissue delivery.Monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) were used as vehicles of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) NP and immunoglobulin (IgG) or albumin coated SPIO for studies of uptake and distribution. IgG coated SPIO was synthesized by covalent linkage and uptake into monocytes and MDM investigated related to size, time, temperature, concentration, and coatings. SPIO and IgG SPIO were infused intravenously into naïve mice. T(2) measures using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used to monitor tissue distribution in animals.Oxidation of dextran on the SPIO surface generated reactive aldehyde groups and permitted covalent linkage to amino groups of murine and human IgG and F(ab')(2) fragments and for Alexa Fluor(R) 488 hydroxylamine to form a Schiff base. This labile intermediate was immediately reduced with sodium cyanoborohydride in order to stabilize the NP conjugate. Optical density measurements of the oxidized IgG, F(ab')(2), and/or Alexa Fluor(R) 488 SPIO demonstrated approximately 50% coupling yield. IgG-SPIO was found stable at 4 degrees C for a period of 1 month during which size and polydispersity index varied little from 175 nm and 200 nm, respectively. In vitro, NP accumulated readily within monocyte and MDM cytoplasm after IgG-SPIO exposure; whereas, the uptake of native SPIO in monocytes and MDM was 10-fold less. No changes in cell viability were noted for the SPIO-containing monocytes and MDM. Cell morphology was not changed as observed by transmission electron microscopy. Compared to unconjugated SPIO, intravenous injection of IgG-SPIO afforded enhanced and sustained lymphoid tissue distribution over 24 hours as demonstrated by MRI.Facilitated uptake of coated SPIO in monocytes and MDM was achieved. Uptake was linked to particle size and was time and concentration dependent. The ability of SPIO to be rapidly taken up and distributed into lymphoid tissues also demonstrates feasibility of macrophage-targeted nanoformulations for diagnostic and drug therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2051001106,"Specification of retinal rod photoreceptors is determined by several different transcription factors that activate expression of rod-specific genes and repress expression of cone photoreceptor-specific genes. The mechanism by which this dual regulation occurs is unclear. We have found that Pias3, a transcriptional coregulator and E3 SUMO ligase that is selectively expressed in developing photoreceptors, promotes the differentiation of rod photoreceptors while preventing rods from adopting cone photoreceptor-like characteristics. Pias3 binds the photoreceptor-specific transcription factors Crx and Nr2e3 and is specifically targeted to the promoters of photoreceptor-specific genes. Pias3 SUMOylates Nr2e3, converting it into a potent repressor of cone-specific gene expression. Rod- and cone-specific promoters are bound by hyperSUMOylated proteins in rod photoreceptors, and blocking SUMOylation in photoreceptors results in cells with morphological and molecular features of cones and an absence of rod-specific markers. Our data thus identify Pias3-mediated SUMOylation of photoreceptor-specific transcription factors as a key mechanism of rod specification."

The hetero-oligomeric cytochrome b6f complex that functions between the reaction center complexes of the oxygenic photosynthetic electron transport chain contains eight tightly bound polypeptide subunits whose dimer molecular weight is ∼217,000. Plastoquinol-plastocyanin or -cytochrome c6 oxidoreductase activity is coupled to proton translocation, which generates the proton electrochemical potential gradient necessary for ATP synthesis and provides the electronic connection between the two photosynthetic reaction center complexes, photosystems I and II. A three-dimensional crystal structure of the b6f complex has been determined from the cyanobacterium Mastigocladus laminosus (1Kurisu G. Zhang H. Smith J.L. Cramer W.A.

Nature. 2003; 426: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Cyanobacteria are potentially ideal sources for obtaining stable photosynthetic membrane proteins for structural studies (4Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar, 5Zouni A. Witt H.T. Kern J. Fromme P. Krauss N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar), because they are readily grown, and the protein yield from a reasonable volume of cell culture is sufficient to obtain crystals suitable for x-ray diffraction analysis. It is unexpected that stable intact dimeric b6f complex suitable for crystal growth has thus far not been obtained from unicellular cyanobacteria, but only from the filamentous moderately thermophilic M. laminosus. In our experience and that of other laboratories, the b6f complex extracted by detergent from unicellular cyanobacteria is always monomerized and inactivated. The reasons for the monomerization are not known. They may involve intrinsic instability of the protein complex in detergent micelles or the action of membrane-bound proteases. Because M. laminosus is not transformable at present, site-directed mutagenesis studies of the b6f complex in cyanobacteria have been carried out in the unicellular cyanobacteria, Synechococcus sp. 7002 (6Yan J. Cramer W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20925-20933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 7Yan J.S. Cramer W.A. J. Mol.

This situation motivated a search for a cyanobacterium that could be used in structure and function studies of the b6f complex that would include the potential for mutagenesis. To identify such cyanobacteria suitable for further analysis of the structure and function of the b6f complex, the amino acid sequences of the closely related homologues of the filamentous M. laminosus b6f complex were analyzed. In the present study, isolation of active dimeric cytochrome b6f complex from the transformable Nostoc sp. PCC 7120, which also contain the unique heme cn previously found in C. reinhardtii (3Stroebel D. Choquet Y. Popot J.L. Picot D.

An additional unique aspect of the structure, resolved by mass spectrometry, was N-terminal acetylation of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (ISP) 3The abbreviations used are: ISP, iron-sulfur protein; cyt, cytochrome; heme bp/bn, cyt b6 hemes located on electrochemically positive/negative sides of membrane; heme cn, heme covalently bound by one thioether bond adjacent to heme bn; DOPC, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; ∈mM, millimolar extinction coefficient; MEROPS, peptidase database; MES, 4-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid; Nostoc, Nostoc (Anabaena) sp.

N-terminal acetylation is common in proteins of eukaryotes and halophilic archaea but very rare in prokaryotes, including cyanobacteria. There has been only one previous report of N-terminal post-translational modification of a cyanobacterial protein, acetylation of a transcription factor in the cyanobacterium, Aphanizomenon ovalisporum (9Shalev-Malul G.

Materials-Ammonium sulfate was purchased from MP Biomedicals (Solon, OH). Decyl-plastoquinol and propyl-agarose were from Sigma-Aldrich, SP-Sepharose from Amersham Biosciences, and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and n-undecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside from Anatrace (Maumee, OH). Unless otherwise specified, all other reagents were purchased from Mallinckrodt Baker, Inc. (Phillipsburg, NJ). Cyanobacterial Strains and Growth Conditions-Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 strain has been kindly provided by R. Haselkorn (University of Chicago). The cyanobacteria were grown in BG-11 media (10Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar) at 30 °C under a light intensity of 100–150 μEinsteins m–2 s–1 obtained from fluorescent lamps. Cells were harvested at early exponential growth phase (A730 ≈ 1–2) and were stored in the frozen state at –70 °C. Purification of Nostoc Cytochrome b6f Complex-A conventional method for isolation of the complex was modified to optimize the procedure for detergent extraction of the b6f complex. Thylakoid membranes were isolated as described for the cyanobacterium, M. laminosus (11Zhang H. Whitelegge J.P. Cramer W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38159-38165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resuspended in 10 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 8.0, and washed with 2 m NaBr solution as described (12Hurt E. Hauska G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 117: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The chlorophyll a concentration was determined as previously described (13Porra R.J. Chlorophylls. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 31-57Google Scholar). The final sediment was resuspended to a chlorophyll a concentration of 2 mg/ml in TNE (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, with protease inhibitors, 2 mm benzamidine, and 2 mm ∈-aminocaproic acid) supplemented with 300 mm sucrose. Cytochrome b6f complex was extracted by adding 0.1 volume of UDM solution to a final concentration of 10 mm with stirring of the suspension for 30 min on ice. The extract was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 45 min in a 70-Ti rotor (Beckman-Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA). Further purification using ammonium sulfate precipitation, hydrophobic chromatography purification, and density centrifugation in sucrose gradient was performed as described (11Zhang H. Whitelegge J.P. Cramer W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38159-38165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that TNE buffer was used in all steps. Purification of Plastocyanin-The protocol was adapted from a previous study (14Ellefson W.L. Ulrich E.A. Krogmann D.W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 69: 223-228Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant of broken Nostoc cells (in the first step of the thylakoid membrane isolation described above) to achieve 45% saturation and stirred for 2 h at 4 °C. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was collected, and ammonium sulfate was added to 100% saturation, and the mixture was stirred for 2 h and stored for 16 h at 4 °C. The precipitate containing plastocyanin was sedimented by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A (1 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.25 mm ferricyanide), and ammonium sulfate was removed using a Centriprep YM-10 concentrator (Millipore, Billerica, MA). This sample was loaded onto a SP-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer A. After a wash with buffer A supplemented with 2 mm NaCl, pure plastocyanin was eluted with a linear gradient of 2–30 mm NaCl in buffer A. Plastoquinol-plastocyanin Oxidoreductase Activity-The assay suspension for plastoquinol-plastocyanin oxidoreductase activity contained 2.5 μm plastocyanin, 5 nm cyt b6f complex, 0.25 mm potassium ferricyanide, 1 mm UDM, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Absorbance changes were assayed on a Cary 4000 spectrophotometer (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The reaction was initiated by addition of 20 μm decyl-plastoquinol, and activity was monitored as the change of potassium ferricyanide absorbance at 420 nm based on ∈mm = 1.02 mm–1 cm–1 (15Peck H.D. Deacon T.E. Davidson J.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 96: 429-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Absorbance Difference Spectra-Chemical difference spectra of cytochromes f and b6 were measured as described previously (16Metzger S.U. Cramer W.A. Whitmarsh J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using a Cary 300 spectrophotometer (Varian Inc.). Mass Spectrometry-Liquid chromatography with electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry and concomitant fraction collection was performed as previously described for the M. laminosus b6f complex (17Whitelegge J.P. Zhang H. Aguilera R. Taylor R.M. Cramer W.A. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2002; 1: 816-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Liquid chromatography with data-dependent tandem mass spectrometry was performed on a quadrupole time-of-flight electrospray mass spectrometer (QSTAR XL, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as described previously (18Xie J. Marusich M.F. Souda P. Whitelegge J. Capaldi R.A. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3545-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). EPR-EPR spectra of cyt b6f complex samples were recorded on a Bruker 300 spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin Corp., Billerica, MA) equipped with an Oxford ESR-910 liquid helium cryostat and a Bruker bimodal cavity for generation of the microwave magnetic field parallel and perpendicular to the static orienting magnetic field (19Zatsman A.I. Zhang H. Gunderson W.A. Cramer W.A. Hendrich M.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 14246-14247Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The quantitation of all signals was relative to a CuEDTA spin standard. The microwave frequency was calibrated with a frequency counter and the magnetic field with a NMR gaussmeter. The sample temperature of the cryostat was calibrated using a calibrated carbon-glass resistor (LakeShore CGR-1–1000) placed in an EPR tube to mimic a sample. A modulation frequency of 100 kHz was used for all EPR spectra. All experimental data were collected under non-saturating conditions. Specific experimental conditions are described in the legend to Fig. 4. Protein Sequence Analysis-Multiple sequence alignments for the eight subunits of cyanobacterial cyt b6f complex were built using the ClustalW version 1.83 algorithm (20Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar) with Gonnet matrix, gap opening penalty, and gap extension penalty equal to 10.0 and 0.2, respectively. A genomic DNA search to identify non-annotated small subunit homologues has been performed using the NCBI Genomic BLAST server (21McGinnis S. Madden T.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W20-W25Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). A Comparative Genomics server of the MEROPS peptidase database release 8.1 (22Rawlings N.D. Morton F.R. Kok C.Y. Kong J. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: D320-D325Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) was used to search unique peptidases characteristic for selected cyanobacteria strains. Crystallization of the b6f Complex-Crystals of the native cytochrome b6f complex were obtained using the modified hanging drop, vapor-diffusion method described before (2Yamashita E. Zhang H. Cramer W.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 370: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Buffer was exchanged to 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm DOPC lipid, and 3 mm UDM detergent. The protein was concentrated to 135 μm, and 4-μl droplets for crystallization were set up by diluting 1:1 with reservoir solution containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CdCl2, 1 mm DOPC, 3 mm UDM, and 12% polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 550. Crystals were grown at 6 °C for 2 days. Prior to flash freezing, crystals were transferred to cryo-protectant solutions containing the same components as the reservoir solution except that the polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 550 concentration was 14% and the glycerol concentration was increased in steps of 5%, to 25%. Crystallography and Analysis of Diffraction Data-Crystals were screened for quality of diffraction at 100 K. Diffraction quality, resolution, and mosaicity were first assessed using in-house x-ray equipment and subsequently at beam line 19-ID at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL). The structure of the Nostoc b6f complex was determined by rigid body refinement using REFMAC5 (23Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) in CCP4 (24Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), with the native structure from M. laminosus (2E74, PDB accession code) as the initial model. The structure refinement used programs REFMAC5 and O (25Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Comparative Sequence Analysis of the Subunits of Cyanobacterial b6f Complexes-The amino acid sequences of the subunits of the b6f complex from several cyanobacteria were compared with that of M. laminosus. Representative cyanobacterial strains whose complete genome sequence has been deposited in the NCBI Genome database were selected for the multiple sequence alignment analysis. The results displayed in Table 1 demonstrate that the highest degree of identity among the subunits of the M. laminosus b6f complex is displayed by the phylogenetically and morphologically related filamentous heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria that reside in the phylogenetically defined subsection IV of the cyanobacteria (10Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar), such as Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413 and Nostoc sp. PCC 7120. These results are in agreement with phylogenetic data derived from 16S rRNA sequence analysis (26Tomitani A. Front. Res. Earth Evol. 2006; 2: 1-5Google Scholar). Compared with M. laminosus, the sequences of the subunits that have been shown to be essential for the function of the complex (cyt b6, cyt f, SuIV and Rieske ISP, petG, and petN) have 81–95% identity. Subunits petL and petM, which appear not to be essential (27Boronowsky U. Wenk S. Schneider D. Jager C. Rogner M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1506: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 28Schneider D. Volkmer T. Rogner M. Res.

Open table in a new tab Purification of b6f Complex from Nostoc sp. PCC 7120; Electron Transport Activity-During extraction of the complex from the membranes of Nostoc, a rapid loss of oxidoreductase activity was observed when the same procedure was employed that was used for isolation from M. laminosus (11Zhang H. Whitelegge J.P. Cramer W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38159-38165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that extraction of thylakoid membranes with a mixture of ionic and glycoside detergents (sodium cholate and octylglucoside) results in lipid depletion of, and/or dissociation of, integral components from the complex. To avoid such denaturation of the protein, a milder maltoside detergent, undecyl-maltoside, was used for extraction. The oxidoreductase activity of the b6f complex was retained when thylakoid membranes containing a cyt b6f equivalent of 2 mg/ml chlorophyll a were extracted on ice with 10 mm UDM. The extraction efficiency was ∼65%. Better extraction efficiency was obtained by increasing concentrations of the detergent to 15–20 mm, although this resulted in a significant reduction of the protein purity ultimately obtained. The UDM concentration was further reduced to 1 mm during purification on a propyl-agarose column. A pure form of dimeric b6f complex was obtained after density centrifugation through a sucrose gradient (Fig. 1). The dimeric protein fraction from Nostoc represented 70–80% of the total purified b6f complex. The density centrifugation was repeated twice to enrich the complex. The final yield of purified b6f complex was ∼7 mg of pure dimer from 25 g of wet cell pellet. The heme ratio of the isolated b6f complex, that of cyt b6 to cyt f, was determined to be 2.1 ± 0.07 by redox difference spectrophotometry using extinction coefficients described previously (16Metzger S.U. Cramer W.A. Whitmarsh J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Decyl-plastoquinol-plastocyanin oxidoreductase activity of the b6f complex was 277 ± 14 s–1·cyt f –1. Comparative Genomics of Cyanobacterial Peptidases-Considering the hypothesis that the absence of endogenous peptidase activity is a major determinant of the stability of the dimeric complex, a proteolytic enzyme composition analysis of unicellular cyanobacteria and the Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 genome was performed using the comparative genomics search engine (MEROPS peptidase data base). The peptidase composition was analyzed for selected cyanobacterial strains (Thermosynechococcus elongatus, Anabaena variabilis, Synechococcus elongatus, and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803) that we or others had previously used for purification of the b6f complex. Compared with Nostoc, 4–20 unique peptidases were found in the other cyanobacterial strains (Table 2).TABLE 2Comparative genomics analysis of cyanobacterial proteasesStrainGenome sizeTotal, known, or putative peptidasesUnique peptidases compared to Nostoc sp.

Open table in a new tab Chemical Modification of the Rieske Iron-Sulfur Protein; N-terminal Acetylation-The polypeptide composition of the purified complex was analyzed by electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry, revealing the eight subunit composition of the complex (Table 3). The analysis also determined that the N terminus of the Rieske ISP is partly acetylated (Fig. 2, A and B, and Table 3). This is seen as a spectral peak in the mass spectrum that is 42 mass units greater than predicted from the amino acid sequence. Two forms of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (petC; ISP) were clearly resolved by chromatography and their mass in Nostoc (Fig. 2A). These species have been assigned as a smaller species with its initiating Met-1 removed (molecular mass = 19,064.2 Da) and a larger species that is acetylated at the N terminus (molecular mass = 19,106.6 Da). A column fraction containing the larger species was treated with trypsin, and tandem mass spectrometry was performed on the N-terminal peptide (nano-liquid chromatograph coupled to MSMS using Qstar XL). An N-terminal ion series (b1–b6) and all other MS and MS/MS mass measurements were all consistent with acetylation at position 1 (Fig. 2B).TABLE 3Masses of subunits of Nostoc cyt b6f complex measured by electrospray-ionization MSSubunitMeasured massaAverage mass, mean of two measurements.Calculated massbCalculated average mass based upon natural isotopic abundances and available sequence modification data.ModificationscModifications include removal of initiating methionine, N-formylation of N terminus (retention of initiating formylmethionine), acetylation (Ac), presence of heme, and disulfide bonds.Cytochrome f31,76931,768+ hemeCytochrome b624,75724,758- Met-1, + hemeRieske ISP19,10719,106- Met-1, +/- Ac19,06419,064+ DisulfidedCalculated 19,066.43 - 2(1.0078) = 19064.41, and for the acetylated form: 19106.42.SuIV17,40417,405- Met-1petG4,0234,023N-FormylpetM3,5743,574N-FormylpetN3,2623,262N-FormylpetL3,2533,253N-Formyla Average mass, mean of two measurements.b Calculated average mass based upon natural isotopic abundances and available sequence modification data.c Modifications include removal of initiating methionine, N-formylation of N terminus (retention of initiating formylmethionine), acetylation (Ac), presence of heme, and disulfide bonds.d Calculated 19,066.43 - 2(1.0078) = 19064.41, and for the acetylated form: 19106.42.

The diffraction data collected under cryo-conditions defined a resolution limit of 3.0 Å (Table 4). The processed data showed that the crystals belong to the hexagonal space group P6122, as in M. laminosus, with very similar unit-cell parameters a = b = 159.2 Å, c = 365.9 Å. The r.m.s.d. between the Cα atom positions of the intact eight subunit structure of M. laminosus (PDB id: 2E74) and Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 (PDB id: 2ZT9) is 0.83 Å. Other r.m.s.d. values are: (i) p-side prosthetic groups, cyt f heme and Rieske [2Fe-2S] cluster, 0.66 and 0.51 Å, respectively; (ii) heme bn, 0.28 Å; (iii) for the unique prosthetic groups in the b6f complex, the n-side heme cn, chlorophyll a, and β-carotene, the r.m.s.d. is 0.33, 0.61, and 0.90 Å. For the p-side heme bp, however, the r.m.s.d. between the 3.0-Å crystal structures from M. laminosus and Nostoc is large, 5.74 Å. The explanation for the latter discrepancy between the two cyanobacterial b6f structures is that the major or exclusive conformation of heme bp in the Nostoc b6f complex is rotated 180° around the axis of the α- and γ-meso carbon atoms relative to the heme orientation in the M. laminosus b6f complex.TABLE 4Intensity data and statistics for a native crystal of Nostoc cytochrome b6f complexCrystalNativeSpace groupP6122Cell constantsa, b (Å)159.2c (Å)365.9Data collectionResolution (Å)3.00 (3.11-3.00)Measured reflections295,712 (29,625)Unique reflections54,614 (5,362)Redundancy5.4 (5.5)I/σ(I)21.9 (4.1)Completeness (%)98.3 (99.3)RmergeaRmerge = ΣhklΣi|Ii(hkl) – 〈I(hkl)〉|/ΣhklΣiIi(hkl), where Ii is the intensity of the measured reflection.0.080 (0.337)RefinementRbR = Σ ∥Fo| – |Fc∥/Σ|Fo|, where Fc and Fo are the calculated and observed structure factors, respectively.0.230RfreecRfree is calculated for a randomly chosen 5.0% of reflections omitted from refinement.0.259rms deviation from idealBond lengths (Å)0.01Bond angles (°)1.77a Rmerge = ΣhklΣi|Ii(hkl) – 〈I(hkl)〉|/ΣhklΣiIi(hkl), where Ii is the intensity of the measured reflection.b R = Σ ∥Fo| – |Fc∥/Σ|Fo|, where Fc and Fo are the calculated and observed structure factors, respectively.c Rfree is calculated for a randomly chosen 5.0% of reflections omitted from refinement.

https://openalex.org/W2083995085,"Even when phenotypic differences are large between natural or domesticated strains, the underlying genetic basis is often complex, and causal genomic regions need to be identified by quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. Unfortunately, QTL positions typically have large confidence intervals, which can, for example, lead to one QTL being masked by another, when two closely linked loci are detected as a single QTL. One strategy to increase the power of precisely localizing small effect QTL, is the use of an intercross approach before inbreeding to produce Advanced Intercross RILs (AI-RILs).We present two new AI-RIL populations of Arabidopsis thaliana genotyped with an average intermarker distance of 600 kb. The advanced intercrossing design led to expansion of the genetic map in the two populations, which contain recombination events corresponding to 50 kb/cM in an F(2) population. We used the AI-RILs to map QTL for light response and flowering time, and to identify segregation distortion in one of the AI-RIL populations due to a negative epistatic interaction between two genomic regions.The two new AI-RIL populations, EstC and KendC, derived from crosses of Columbia (Col) to Estland (Est-1) and Kendallville (Kend-L) provide an excellent resource for high precision QTL mapping. Moreover, because they have been genotyped with over 100 common markers, they are also excellent material for comparative QTL mapping."
https://openalex.org/W2158881923,"A paradox regarding the classic power spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) is whether the characteristic high- (HF) and low-frequency (LF) spectral peaks represent stochastic or chaotic phenomena. Resolution of this fundamental issue is key to unraveling the mechanisms of HRV, which is critical to its proper use as a noninvasive marker for cardiac mortality risk assessment and stratification in congestive heart failure (CHF) and other cardiac dysfunctions. However, conventional techniques of nonlinear time series analysis generally lack sufficient sensitivity, specificity and robustness to discriminate chaos from random noise, much less quantify the chaos level. Here, we apply a ‘litmus test’ for heartbeat chaos based on a novel noise titration assay which affords a robust, specific, time-resolved and quantitative measure of the relative chaos level. Noise titration of running short-segment Holter tachograms from healthy subjects revealed circadian-dependent (or sleep/wake-dependent) heartbeat chaos that was linked to the HF component (respiratory sinus arrhythmia). The relative ‘HF chaos’ levels were similar in young and elderly subjects despite proportional age-related decreases in HF and LF power. In contrast, the near-regular heartbeat in CHF patients was primarily nonchaotic except punctuated by undetected ectopic beats and other abnormal beats, causing transient chaos. Such profound circadian-, age- and CHF-dependent changes in the chaotic and spectral characteristics of HRV were accompanied by little changes in approximate entropy, a measure of signal irregularity. The salient chaotic signatures of HRV in these subject groups reveal distinct autonomic, cardiac, respiratory and circadian/sleep-wake mechanisms that distinguish health and aging from CHF."

https://openalex.org/W2151789787,"A second dermatan sulfate epimerase (DS-epi2) was identified as a homolog of the first epimerase (DS-epi1), which was previously described by our group. DS-epi2 is 1,222 amino acids long and has an approximately 700-amino acid N-terminal epimerase domain that is highly conserved between the two enzymes. In addition, the C-terminal portion is predicted to be an O-sulfotransferase domain. In this study we found that DS-epi2 has epimerase activity, which involves conversion of d-glucuronic acid to l-iduronic acid (EC 5.1.3.19), but no O-sulfotransferase activity was detected. In dermatan sulfate, iduronic acid residues are either clustered together in blocks or alternating with glucuronic acid, forming hybrid structures. By using a short interfering RNA approach, we found that DS-epi2 and DS-epi1 are both involved in the biosynthesis of the iduronic acid blocks in fibroblasts and that DS-epi2 can also synthesize the hybrid structures. Both iduronic acid-containing domains have been shown to bind to several growth factors, many of which have biological roles in brain development. DS-epi2 has been genetically linked to bipolar disorder, which suggests that the dermatan sulfate domains generated by a defective enzyme may be involved in the etiology of the disease."

The DUB/USP17 subfamily were originally identified as murine hematopoietic specific genes (DUB-1, DUB-1A, and DUB-2) induced in response to a range of cytokines (19Zhu Y. Os Pless M. Inhorn R.

We have identified a human orthologue DUB-3/USP17 (subsequently referred to as USP17) that is also cytokine-regulated (21Burrows J.F. McGrattan M.J. Rascle A. Humbert M. Baek K.H. Johnston J.A. J.

HochStrasser M. D'Andrea A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3275-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Additionally, DUB-2 expression can markedly inhibit apoptosis induced by cytokine withdrawal (25Migone T. Humbert M. Rascle A. Sanden D. D'Andrea A. Johnston J.A. Blood. 2001; 98: 1935-1941Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and we have reported that constitutive expression of human USP17 can block cell proliferation (21Burrows J.F. McGrattan M.J.

However, the targets of USP17 have not been identified. The small GTPase p21Ras (Ras) has long been recognized as an important regulator of cell proliferation, and constitutively active mutants have been associated with many cancers (26Shields J.M. Pruitt K. McFall A. Shaub A. Der C.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 147-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 27Malumbres M. Barbacid M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). Although Ras is activated by cycling from the GDP- to the GTP-bound states, membrane localization is also essential for its activation. This requires a series of processing events that involve modifications of its carboxyl-terminal CAAX motif. Briefly, the cysteine residue is isoprenylated by a farnesyltransferase (FTase) (28Reiss Y. Goldstein J.L. Seabra M.C. Casey P.J. Brown M.S. Cell. 1990; 62: 81-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar), and Ras is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where the three carboxyl-terminal amino acids (i.e. the -AAX) are removed by Ras-converting enzyme 1 (RCE1), an ER integral transmembrane protease (29Boyartchuk V.L.

Subsequently, the exposed isoprenylcysteine is methylated by an ER transmembrane methyltransferase called isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (ICMT) (32Hrycyna C.A. Sapperstein S.K. Clarke S. Michaelis S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1699-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Depending on the Ras isoform, it may then be palmitoylated (33Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J.

It had initially been identified as a cysteine protease, but subsequent studies would suggest that it has metalloprotease-like activity (35Dolence J.M. Steward L.E. Dolence E.K. Wong D.H.

Nonetheless, it has been clearly shown that loss of RCE1 blocks proper Ras localization and impedes cell growth and transformation (30Kim E. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Taylor B. Ashby M. Shannon K.

In this study we show that USP17 disrupts Ras plasma membrane localization and activation and markedly inhibits proliferation. Moreover USP17 also blocks RCE1 activity, and this effect is dependent on USP17 deubiquitinating activity.

Chem. 1999; 274: 8379-8382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Transfectants were generated using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science), as specified by the manufacturer. Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitations, and Immunoblotting-Whole cell lysates and immunoprecipitations were generated and separated prior to immunoblotting as previously described (21Burrows J.F.

The following antibodies were used: anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma, Dorset, UK); anti-DUB-3/USP17 (Fusion Antibodies, Belfast, UK); anti-phospho-ERK1/2, ERK2, phosho-MEK1/2, MEK1/2, HA or pan-Ras (Cell Signaling); anti-FTaseα (BD Biosciences); and anti-HA (12ca5; Roche Applied Science). Confocal Microscopy-MEF, Cos7 or HeLa cells were seeded at 2.5 × 104 cells/1.7 cm2 well of LabTek II, CC2-treated chamber slides (Nalge Nunc, Hereford, UK). Cells, as necessary, were transfected with 0.25 μg of each plasmid using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). 24 h after transfection, or 48 h after seeding, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in CBS for 20 min at room temperature. The slides were stained as necessary with the appropriate antibodies and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The following antibodies were used: anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma), anti-DUB-3/USP17 (Fusion Antibodies), anti-HA (12ca5; Roche Applied Science), and anti-calnexin (Jackson Laboratories). The slides were then viewed on a Zeiss LSM 510 META NLO Confocal Microscope. The images presented in the same panels were captured using standardized settings and exposure times (Zeiss, Hertfordshire, UK). Retroviral Infection-Retroviral infections of RCE1+/+ MEF and RCE1-/- MEF cells were carried out as previously described (21Burrows J.F. McGrattan M.J. Rascle A. Humbert M. Baek K.H. Johnston J.A. J.

Ras RBD Pulldown Assay-Ba/F3 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of tetracycline for 48 h before being transferred to serum-free medium for 4 h to minimize basal activation. They were then stimulated with 100 units/ml IL-3 for the indicated time points prior to lysis. MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected as previously described and rested in 0% fetal calf serum Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium for 4 h prior to serum stimulation. The cells were immediately washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer containing 0.5 m Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 m MgCl2, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% Triton, and 5% glycerol with 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 mm benzamidine, and 2 mm Na3VO4, and GST pulldown was carried out. Lysate was rested on ice for 10 min and spun down at 12,000 RPM for 10 min to pellet the membrane. Lysate was removed and added to RBD-GST fusion protein preassociated GST beads (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). The pulldowns were separated and immunoblotted as previously described using a pan-Ras antibody. CAAX Cleavage Assay-The cells were lysed as previously described (39Pickhart C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 544-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), and CAAX assays were performed using membrane fractions prepared as previously described (36Plummer L.J.

Chem. 2006; 281: 4596-4605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and a quenched flurogenic peptide, ABZ-KSKTKC(f)QLIM was obtained from AnaSpec. Membrane fractions (50 μl) were incubated with 50 μl of assay buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2) with 40 μm of flurogenic peptide. The fluorescence generated was recorded at excitation and emission wavelengths of 320 and 420 nm, respectively, using a Cytofluor® Multi-well series 4000 spectrofluorimeter, and all reactions were performed in triplicate on a black 96-well plate. RNA Extraction and RT-PCR-RNA was extracted and RT-PCR was carried out as previously described (21Burrows J.F. McGrattan M.J. Rascle A. Humbert M. Baek K.H. Johnston J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13993-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). USP17 Regulates Ras/MEK/ERK Signaling-We have previously shown that constitutive expression of USP17 blocks cell growth. To determine how this occurs, we examined its effect on intracellular signaling using a previously described IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cell line in which the expression of USP17 is blocked by tetracycline (21Burrows J.F. McGrattan M.J. Rascle A. Humbert M. Baek K.H. Johnston J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13993-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Ba/F3 cells, cultured in the presence or absence of tetracycline for 48 h, were stimulated with IL-3, and activation of ERK was examined using a phospho-ERK-specific antibody. ERK1/2 activation was markedly down-regulated by USP17 expression (Fig. 1A, top panels, and supplemental Fig. S1). We also found that USP17 expression decreased the activation of upstream MEK (Fig. 1A, lower panels, and supplemental Fig. S1). These results suggested that the expression of USP17 may modulate the Ras pathway, and therefore IL-3 induced Ras activity was also assessed using a RBD pulldown assay. This assay involves using a recombinant GST-tagged Raf-RBD to pull down Ras. The Raf-RBD only interacts with active GTP-bound Ras and thus determines Ras activity. In the presence of USP17, the levels of activated Ras were found to be markedly reduced (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1). Because constitutive expression of USP17 decreased Ras activation, we also hypothesized that knockdown of endogenous USP17 would enhance Ras activation. Therefore, we transiently transfected USP17-specific shRNA (shRNA1) and observed the levels of GTP-bound Ras following serum stimulation. The shRNA efficiently knocked down USP17 expression (Fig. 1C, lower panel), resulting in a marked elevation in the level of GTP-bound Ras (Fig. 1C, upper panel, and supplemental Fig. S1). These results, which were representative of three independent experiments and subsequently have been repeated with an independent shRNA for USP17, indicated that Ras activity was regulated by USP17. USP17 Regulates Ras Localization-These results suggested that USP17 was impeding the Ras/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Therefore, because trafficking of Ras to the plasma membrane is required for Ras/MEK/ERK signaling, we decided to determine whether USP17 could alter Ras localization. The localization of Ras to the plasma membrane is controlled by the processing of its carboxyl terminus, and previous studies have used GFP-tagged Ras to monitor its localization. Therefore, wild type (WT) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were transfected with constructs expressing GFP-H-Ras in conjunction with either USP17 or catalytically inactive USP17CS (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S3). In more than three separate experiments, when expressed alone or in conjunction with USP17CS, the majority of GFP-H-Ras localized to the plasma membrane as expected (Fig. 2, see yellow arrows in panels 1 and 3). However, in the presence of USP17, although some GFP-H-Ras was present at the plasma membrane, in repeated experiments H-Ras showed a clear cytosolic distribution (Fig. 2, panel 2). Similar experiments using a shRNA targeting USP17 showed no effect upon GFP-H-Ras localization (supplemental Fig. S3). USP17 Deubiquitinates RCE1-Processing of the Ras carboxyl-terminal CAAX motif is essential for Ras membrane localization and is mediated in a multi-step process by a number of enzymes, namely FTase (28Reiss Y. Goldstein J.L. Seabra M.C. Casey P.J. Brown M.S. Cell. 1990; 62: 81-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar), RCE1 (29Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1699-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). On the basis of our data showing that the expression of USP17 blocked the transfer of Ras to the plasma membrane, we examined the possibility that one or more of these Ras-processing enzymes was a substrate for USP17. Therefore we examined whether these enzymes could be ubiquitinated and whether USP17 could reverse this modification. First we examined the Ras-processing enzymes ICMT and the FTase α-subunit but did not see any evidence of ubiquitination, even in the presence of overexpressed HA-tagged ubiquitin (results not shown). However, when we co-expressed RCE1 with ubiquitin and RCE1 immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted for the presence of ubiquitin, smearing was observed that would indicate RCE1 could be modified by this peptide (Fig. 3A, sixth lane). This smearing was removed upon expression of USP17 (Fig. 3A, seventh lane), but not USP17CS (Fig. 3A, eighth lane), indicating that catalytically competent USP17 acted to remove ubiquitin from RCE1. Moreover, this deubiquitination was specific because the deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD did not remove ubiquitin from RCE1 (Fig. 3B, seventh lane). Interestingly, RCE1 protein levels were not enhanced in the presence of USP17, indicating that the ubiquitination of RCE1 was not promoting turnover of RCE1 by proteasomal degradation, and therefore we further examined the type of ubiquitin chains that form on RCE1 using mutant ubiquitin constructs (Fig. 3C). When a ubiquitin mutant that can only form K63 branched ubiquitin chains was present, the characteristic smears were once again observed, indicating that K63-branched ubiquitin chains could be attached to RCE1 and that USP17 could remove these chains (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the expression of a ubiquitin mutant that only formed K48-linked chains resulted in RCE1 degradation (supplemental Fig. S2). This indicated that K63 linked ubiquitin chains can conjugate to RCE1 and that they can be removed by USP17. Because no alteration in RCE1 protein levels were observed ± USP17, it suggested that ubiquitin was modulating RCE1 in a manner independent of protein turnover. K63 ubiquitin chains have previously been associated with modulation of protein function (39Pickhart C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 544-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 40Ikeda F. Dikic I. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), and we hypothesized that USP17 may modulate the activity of RCE1. This hypothesis was further strengthened when we studied the localization of GFP-H-Ras in MEF cells lacking the enzyme RCE1 (Fig. 3D, panels 1-3). GFP-H-Ras expressed in RCE1 null cells exhibited cytosolic distribution, whether expressed alone or in conjunction with USP17 or USP17CS (Fig. 3D, panels 1-3). This suggested that the presence of RCE1 was required to observe the USP17-induced effect. In addition, when the localization of GFP-H-Ras in RCE1-/- MEF cells ((Fig. 3D, panels 1-3) was compared with the localization in WT MEF cells (Fig. 3D, panels 4-6), it was apparent that the pattern observed in RCE1 null cells was similar to that observed in WT MEF cells expressing USP17 (Fig. 3D, panel 5). This clearly demonstrated the dependence of RCE1 to produce the USP17-induced effect on Ras. USP17 Regulates RCE1 Activity-To determine whether USP17 could attenuate the proteolytic activity of RCE1, we employed a CAAX cleavage assay using a farnesylated internally quenched fluorescent peptidyl substrate derived from the carboxyl terminus of K-Ras, which releases its quencher and fluoresces after RCE1-mediated cleavage (36Plummer L.J. Hildebrandt E.R. Porter S.B. Rogers V.A. McCracken J. Schmidt W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4596-4605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). 293T cells were transfected with combinations of RCE1, USP17, or USP17CS, and microsomal membrane preparations were assessed for RCE1 activity. Expression of USP17, but not USP17CS, markedly reduced both the rate and total turnover of the substrate (Fig. 4A, top panel), indicating that the deubiquitinating activity of USP17 attenuated RCE1 activity. Greater than 50% reduction in RCE1 activity in the presence of USP17 was observed consistently over three independent experiments. Furthermore, equivalent RCE1 expression confirmed that the reduction in RCE1 activity was not merely due to changes in protein levels (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). The ability of USP17 to block RCE1 activity was further confirmed using a shRNA specifically targeting USP17 (shRNA1) (Fig. 4B, bottom right panel). As before, 293T cells were transiently transfected with RCE1 in the presence and absence of the USP17-specific shRNA, and RCE1 activity was determined. In the presence of the shRNA, the level of RCE1 activity was consistently augmented (Fig. 4B, top panel), suggesting that removal of endogenous USP17 enhanced RCE1 activity. Collectively, these observations show that USP17 inhibits RCE1 proteolytic activity, thus attenuating Ras activation. This was further supported by the use of another USP17-specific shRNA (shRNA2), which gave similar results (supplemental Fig. S2). USP17 and RCE1 Co-localize at the Endoplasmic Reticulum-Previously, RCE1 had been shown localized at the ER in yeast (41Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar), so we set out to determine its localization in mammalian cells and examine whether it co-localized with USP17. Cells transfected with RCE1 displayed a perinuclear distribution consistent with the protein being restricted to the ER (Fig. 5A, left panel). This was con"

When expressed alone, the most prevalent NR1 splice variant and all NR2 subunits are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas other NR1 splice variants reach the cell surface to varying degrees. Because similar trafficking patterns have been seen for single transmembrane domain chimeric proteins with appended C termini of NMDA receptor subunits, these chimeric proteins have been used as a model for studying the mechanisms underlying the ER retention and surface trafficking of NMDA receptors. Using this approach, an RRR motif in the C1 cassette has been identified as a major ER retention signal present in NR1 subunits, and the surface localization of other NR1 splice variants has been explained by the absence of the C1 cassette or by the presence of a PDZ/coatomer protein complex II-binding domain in the C2′ cassette. However, when we tested these conclusions using full-length NR1 constructs, a more complex role of the C-terminal cassettes in the trafficking of NR1 subunits emerged. Our experiments showed that two independent ER retention motifs in the C1 cassette, KKK and RRR, are the signals mediating ER retention of the full-length NR1 subunits and that the C2 cassette has an additional inhibitory effect on the forward trafficking of NR1 subunits. On the other hand, C0 and C2′ cassettes had an enhancing effect on the trafficking of NR1 subunits to the cell surface.

Brickley S. Farrant M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar, 2Lau C.G. Zukin R.S. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 413-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). The functional NMDA receptors are composed of NR1, NR2, and/or NR3 subunits. The NR1 subunit exists in eight different splice variants derived from a single gene, whereas NR2 subunits are products of four different genes, NR2A–D, and NR3 subunits are products of two different genes, NR3A and NR3B. All subunits have the same transmembrane topology with four membrane regions (M1–4), two extracellular regions, and an intracellular C-terminal region. Recent evidence suggests that abnormal surface expression and synaptic targeting of NMDA receptors play fundamental roles in the development of many disorders, including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and schizophrenia (1Cull-Candy S. Brickley S. Farrant M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar, 2Lau C.G. Zukin R.S. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 413-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Although much is known about the biophysical properties of NMDA receptors, the mechanisms underlying their trafficking to the cell surface remain poorly understood. Previous studies have shown that full-length NR1-1 and NR2 subunits are retained intracellularly when expressed by themselves in heterologous cells, whereas other NR1 splice variants reach the cell surface (3McIlhinney R.A.

Similar results have been obtained using single transmembrane domain chimeras with the appended C termini of NMDA receptor subunits, and thus, these chimeras have been used as a model for studying the mechanisms governing the trafficking of NMDA receptor subunits (5Standley S. Roche K.W. McCallum J. Sans N. Wenthold R.J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 6Scott D.B. Blanpied T.A. Swanson G.T. Zhang C.

Ehlers M.D. Neuropharmacology. 2003; 45: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Hence, the RRR ER retention motif has been identified as a major ER retention signal in the NR1-1 subunit (5Standley S. Roche K.W. McCallum J. Sans N. Wenthold R.J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 6Scott D.B. Blanpied T.A. Swanson G.T. Zhang C. Ehlers M.D. J.

Neuropharmacology. 2001; 41: 714-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and the reason why the NR1-3 splice variant reaches the cell surface has been explained by the presence of the PDZ- and/or coatomer protein complex II (COPII)-binding domain in the far C terminus of C2′ cassette, which can negate the RRR motif (5Standley S. Roche K.W. McCallum J. Sans N. Wenthold R.J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 6Scott D.B. Blanpied T.A. Swanson G.T. Zhang C.

However, our recent study shows that the NR1 subunit truncated five residues after M4 traffics only slightly to the cell surface, likely due to the presence of an ER retention signal in the M3 domain (10Horak M. Chang K. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3500-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This indicates that the role of the C terminus in the trafficking of full-length NR1 subunits is more complex than previous experiments suggested. In this study, we investigated the role of C-terminal cassettes in ER retention and forward trafficking of NR1 subunits. Using full-length and truncated yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-NR1 constructs expressed in heterologous cells, we demonstrate that the C1 cassette contains two independent ER retention motifs, KKK and RRR, and that the C2 cassette has an additional inhibitory effect on the surface trafficking of NR1 subunits. We also found that both C0 and C2′ cassettes have an enhancing effect on surface targeting of the NR1 subunit and, unexpectedly, that the C2′ cassette can partially negate C1 cassette-mediated ER retention, even when the PDZ-binding domain is not functional. These findings show that each C-terminal cassette has a unique role in the trafficking of NR1 subunits to the cell surface. Molecular Biology-The YFP-NR1-1a expression vector, made previously by inserting a YFP gene between the third and fourth amino acid residues after the signal peptide, was used (11Prybylowski K. Fu Z. Losi G. Hawkins L.M. Luo J. Chang K. Wenthold R.J. Vicini S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8902-8910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The identical YFP-NR1-4a construct was kindly provided by Dr. S. Vicini (Georgetown University); the YFP-NR1 post-M4 (YFP-NR1838stop) expression vector was described previously (10Horak M. Chang K. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3500-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). All other constructs used in this study were generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Amino acid residues are numbered as published (12Ishii T. Moriyoshi K. Sugihara H. Sakurada K. Kadotani H. Yokoi M. Akazawa C. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Masu M. J. Biol.

For simplicity, YFP-NR1863stop and YFP-NR1-1a900stop are called YFP-NR1 C0-stop and YFP-NR1-1a C1-stop, respectively. The entire NR1 region following a YFP region of each construct was sequenced to verify the accuracy of DNA sequences. Cell Culture and Transfection-COS-7 (African green monkey kidney fibroblast) cells were maintained in minimum essential medium with Earle’s salts (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The cells were transfected in 12-well plates in 2 ml of their media with 1.8 μg of cDNA mixed with 4μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After 5 h, medium containing the DNA/Lipofectamine mixture was replaced with fresh medium. Cells were used for experiments within 36–40 h after transfection. Immunofluorescence-COS-7 cells expressing YFP-NR1 subunits were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with blocking solution containing PBS and 0.2% bovine serum albumin on ice for 15 min. The primary antibody (rabbit anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibody; Millipore, Billerica, MA) diluted in blocking solution (1:500) was then added for 30 min, cells were washed twice in PBS, and the secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, Invitrogen) diluted in blocking solution (1:1,000) was applied for 30 min. The cells were washed twice in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, and mounted with ProLong Antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Images from stained COS-7 cells were captured using a 40× oil objective on a Nikon Eclipse E1000 fluorescence microscope. Quantitative Assay of Surface and Total Expression-Transfected COS-7 cells were washed in PBS and fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, and when total expression was measured, cells were treated with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. The cells were incubated for 1 h in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum without (surface) or with (total) 0.1% Triton X-100 and then for 1 h in the primary antibody (rabbit anti-GFP antibody; 1:500 for surface expression and 1:1,000 for total expression) in PBS with 3% normal goat serum. Cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated with the secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig; 1:1,000; Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. Cells were then washed three times in PBS and incubated for 30 min in 400 μl of ortho-phenylenediamine dissolved in phosphate/citrate buffer containing sodium phosphate (Sigma). The color reaction was terminated with 100 μl of 3 m HCl, and the optical density was determined at λ492 using a Personal Densitometer SI (GE Healthcare). The background signal was measured in parallel wells transfected with empty vector and was subtracted from the experimental values obtained from wells containing YFP-NR1-expressing cells. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E.; each value is an average of at least six different transfection reactions in three independent experiments performed under the same conditions. Statistical comparisons were made using an unpaired t test.

To identify the mechanism(s) underlying ER retention of the NR1-1 subunit, single transmembrane domain chimeras containing the C termini of NR1 subunits were employed, resulting in the identification of an RRR motif in the C1 cassette of the NR1-1 subunit as a major ER retention signal present on this subunit (Fig. 1A) (5Standley S. Roche K.W. McCallum J. Sans N. Wenthold R.J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 6Scott D.B. Blanpied T.A. Swanson G.T. Zhang C.

However, in these studies, the role of the RRR motif in ER retention of the full-length NR1-1 subunit was not tested. In this study, we first investigated whether or not the C1 cassette contains any functional ER retention signal(s) when all of the preceding parts of the NR1 subunit are present. To do this, we constructed YFP-NR1 subunits truncated before (YFP-NR1 C0-stop) and after (YFP-NR1-1a C1-stop) the C1 cassette, expressed them in COS-7 cells (which lack native NMDA receptors), and compared the surface and total expression of these constructs with the wild type YFP-NR1-1a subunit using immunofluorescence and quantitative assay of surface and total expression (both performed with anti-GFP antibodies) (Fig. 1, B and C). As expected, the YFP-NR1-1a C1-stop subunit did not traffic to the cell surface, similar to the YFP-NR1-1a subunit, but the YFP-NR1 C0-stop subunit exhibited robust surface staining. This observation indicates that the C1 cassette contains ER retention signal(s). Next, we asked whether the RRR motif in the C1 cassette is a major ER retention signal in the full-length NR1-1 subunit (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, substitution of this motif for alanine residues (YFP-NR1-1a RRR/AAA) did not result in surface targeting of the subunit, showing that the RRR motif is not the ER retention motif or the only ER retention motif responsible for the retention of the full-length NR1-1 subunit (Fig. 1, B and C). Because our experiments with deletion constructs suggested that the C1 cassette contains an ER retention signal, we mutated the other putative ER retention motif, KKK, present in the C1 cassette (YFP-NR1-1a KKK/AAA) and measured its surface targeting (13Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 14Nilsson T. Jackson M. Peterson P.A. Cell. 1989; 58: 707-718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Although this construct tended to go to the surface more than the wild type or YFP-NR1-1a RRR/AAA constructs, we did not see a statistically significant difference compared with the wild type subunit. We then substituted both RRR and KKK motifs in the full-length subunit (YFP-NR1-1a KKK/AAA,RRR/AAA) and expressed it in COS-7 cells (Fig. 1, B and C). A quantitative assay of surface expression revealed significantly higher surface expression of the YFP-NR1-1a KKK/AAA,RRR/AAA construct compared with the wild type YFP-NR1-1a subunit; the total expression of all mutated YFP-NR1 subunits was not significantly different compared with the wild type YFP-NR1-1a subunit. Taken together, our data show that both RRR and KKK motifs work as independent ER retention motifs and are able to retain the full-length NR1-1 subunit even when one of them is not functional. PDZ Interaction but Not Phosphorylation Can Negate C1 Cassette-mediated ER Retention-The C1 cassette contains four serine residues in close proximity to the RRR motif; two of them are known protein kinase C phosphorylation sites (Ser890 and Ser896), and one of them is a protein kinase A phosphorylation site (Ser897) (Fig. 2A) (15Tingley W.G. Ehlers M.D. Kameyama K. Doherty C. Ptak J.B. Riley C.T. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5157-5166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 16Tingley W.G. Roche K.W. Thompson A.K. Huganir R.L. Nature. 1993; 364: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). A previous study has shown that incubation of cells with the protein kinase C activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate results in the appearance of the chimeric protein containing the NR1-1 C terminus on the surface membrane and that mutation of Ser896 and Ser897 to alanine residues completely abolishes phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced surface delivery (Ref. 6Scott D.B. Blanpied T.A. Swanson G.T. Zhang C. Ehlers M.D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3063-3072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; but see also Refs. 5Standley S. Roche K.W. McCallum J. Sans N. Wenthold R.J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar and 7Xia H. Hornby Z.D. Malenka R.C. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 41: 714-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A later study reported that the introduction of a negative charge mutation at Ser897 to mimic protein kinase A phosphorylation results in robust surface expression of the chimeric proteins (9Scott D.B. Blanpied T.A. Ehlers M.D. Neuropharmacology. 2003; 45: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Thus, protein kinase C and protein kinase A phosphorylation at Ser896 and Ser897 could negate the RRR ER retention motif in the chimeric protein containing the NR1-1 C terminus. However, these conclusions were not confirmed using full-length NR1-1 subunits. Because we showed that in addition to the RRR motif, there is also a KKK motif responsible for retention of the NR1-1 subunit (Fig. 1), we asked whether the phosphorylation of these serine residues can negate the ER retention of the full-length subunit. First, we made single and double phosphomimic mutations in the full-length YFP-NR1-1a subunit by replacement of Ser896 and/or Ser897 with glutamic acid residues (YFP-NR1-1a S896E, YFP-NR1-1a S897E, and YFP-NR1-1a S896E,S897E) and performed experiments to determine their surface targeting (Fig. 2, B and C). In all cases, surface and total expression of these phosphomimic constructs was not significantly different compared the wild type YFP-NR1-1a subunit. Second, we incubated COS-7 cells expressing the YFP-NR1-1a subunit with 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (protein kinase C activator) for 90 min and then quantified surface and total receptor expression (Fig. 2, B and C). These experiments showed no significant difference compared with control cells. Similarly, we expressed the YFP-NR1-1a subunit in COS-7 cells and tested the effect of a 90-min-long incubation of 20 μm forskolin (protein kinase A activator) on the surface and total expression of NR1 subunits. Our experiments showed no significant difference between control and forskolin-treated cells in the quantification of both surface and total expression (data not shown). Thus, our results show that protein kinase C and/or protein kinase A phosphorylation is not sufficient to negate the ER retention of the full-length NR1-1 subunit. It has been shown previously using single transmembrane domain chimeric proteins that the far C terminus of the C2′ cassette, which contains a PDZ-binding domain, can negate the C1 cassette-mediated ER retention (5Standley S. Roche K.W. McCallum J. Sans N. Wenthold R.J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 6Scott D.B. Blanpied T.A. Swanson G.T. Zhang C. Ehlers M.D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3063-3072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Xia H. Hornby Z.D. Malenka R.C. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 41: 714-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To verify this observation, we replaced the last six amino acid residues in the C terminus of the YFP-NR1-1a subunit with a PDZ-binding domain present in the C2′ cassette (SVSTVV; YFP-NR1-1a+PDZ) and expressed this subunit in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2, B and C). As expected, adding the PDZ-binding domain to the C terminus of the NR1-1a subunit significantly increased surface but not total expression compared with the wild type subunit. This suggests that the PDZ-binding domain can negate both the RRR and KKK ER retention motifs present in the C1 cassette. Role of the C0 Cassette in Export of the Full-length Subunit to the Cell Surface-Our experiments showed that the YFP-NR1 C0-stop subunit exhibits robust surface staining. However, we reported previously that the NR1 subunit truncated five amino acid residues after M4 (YFP-NR1838stop) exhibits only slight surface trafficking (10Horak M. Chang K. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3500-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This indicates that the C0 cassette enhances surface targeting of the full-length NR1 subunit. Next, we examined the surface trafficking of YFP-NR1 constructs truncated at different positions in the C0 cassette (Fig. 3A). These experiments showed that the YFP-NR1843stop subunit reaches the cell surface significantly more than the YFP-NR1838stop subunit; even more pronounced surface labeling was seen for YFP-NR1846stop and YFP-NR1851stop subunits (Fig. 3, B and C). Together, our data show that the proximal region of the C0 cassette plays a critical role in the export of the NR1 subunit to the cell surface. To determine whether any specific motif is responsible for the C0 cassette-mediated export, we made four different YFP-NR1851stop constructs, each containing three alanine residues replacing the original amino acid residues in the C0 cassette (Fig. 3A). A quantitative assay revealed significantly higher surface expression for all of these constructs compared with the YFP-NR1838stop subunit; interestingly, the constructs with replaced RRK and QMQ trafficked to the surface more than the other two constructs (Fig. 3, B and C). The total expression of all truncated and mutated YFP-NR1 subunits was not significantly different compared with the YFP-NR1838stop subunit. In conclusion, our data show that the presence of the C0 cassette can enhance the surface trafficking of the NR1 subunit and that no particular motif is likely involved in this process. Roles of C2 and C2′ Cassettes in Export/Retention of Full-length NR1 Subunits-As mentioned above, the full-length NR1-1 subunit is retained intracellularly, whereas it has been reported that the other NR1 splice variants traffic to the cell surface to varying degrees (Fig. 4A) (4Okabe S. Miwa A. Okado H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7781-7792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Standley S. Roche K.W. McCallum J. Sans N. Wenthold R.J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). To further explore the roles of the C2 and C2′ cassettes in trafficking of the full-length subunits, we decided to compare the surface labeling of all the NR1 splice variants with that of the YFP-NR1 C0-stop construct (Fig. 4, B and C). These experiments showed that the YFP-NR1-2a subunit, containing a C2 cassette, goes to the cell surface significantly less than the YFP-NR1 C0-stop subunit. On the other hand, both YFP-NR1-3a and YFP-NR1-4a, containing the C2′ cassette, trafficked to the cell surface significantly more than the YFP-NR1 C0-stop subunit. Taken together, these results show that the C2 cassette has an inhibitory effect on the trafficking of the full-length NR1 subunit. In contrast, the C2′ cassette can enhance the surface trafficking of the full-length NR1 subunit in the absence or presence of the C1 cassette. The mechanism of C2′ export function has been studied previously (8Mu Y. Otsuka T. Horton A.C. Scott D.B. Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2003; 40: 581-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). This study showed that the last two residues (VV) of the far C terminus in the C2′ cassette can bind COPII and that this interaction but not a PDZ interaction is necessary for the robust export of the C2′ cassette-containing proteins to the cell surface. We studied the effect of selective disruptions of PDZ and COPII interactions on the surface targeting of YFP-NR1 constructs. We first deleted the last four amino acid residues in the YFP-NR1-4a subunit (YFP-NR1-4a ΔPDZ) to prevent both PDZ and COPII interactions. Second, we substituted the threonine in the PDZ-binding domain with arginine (TVV → RVV; YFP-NR1-4a RVV) so that the COPII interaction with the C2′ cassette remained intact, whereas the PDZ interaction was disrupted (Fig. 5A). After the expression of these constructs in the COS-7 cells, we compared their surface expression with wild type YFP-NR1-4a and YFP-NR1 C0-stop subunits (Fig. 5, B and C). Indeed, the YFP-NR1-4a ΔPDZ construct trafficked significantly less to the cell surface than the YFP-NR1-4a construct, showing that disruption of both PDZ and COPII interactions decreases export function of the C2′ cassette. Interestingly, the YFP-NR1-4a RVV construct exhibited significantly less surface expression compared with the wild type YFP-NR1-4a, similar to the YFP-NR1-4a ΔPDZ construct. These data show that the intact PDZ interaction but not the COPII interaction can enhance the surface trafficking of the NR1-4 subunit. To further support this conclusion, we generated the YFP-NR1-4a construct with valine –1 replaced with alanine (TVV → TAV) so that a type 1 PDZ-binding domain (TXV) is fully functional; however, a COPII interaction is disrupted. Indeed, surface and total expression of this subunit was not significantly different compared with the wild type YFP-NR1-4a subunit having an intact COPII interaction (data not shown). In addition, compared with the YFP-NR1 C0-stop construct, surface labeling of both YFP-NR1-4a ΔPDZ and YFP-NR1-4a RVV constructs was significantly higher, showing that the C2′ cassette has an export effect even when the PDZ-binding domain is not functional. To further verify that the C2′ cassette has an enhancing effect on the trafficking of the NR1 subunit even in the absence of the functional PDZ-binding domain, we made YFP-NR1-3a ΔPDZ (with both the PDZ and COPII interactions disrupted) and YFP-NR1-3a RVV (with the PDZ interaction disrupted) constructs and quantified their surface trafficking together with wild type YFP-NR1-3a and YFP-NR1-1a subunits (Fig. 6). As expected, surface trafficking of both YFP-NR1-3a ΔPDZ and YFP-NR1-3a RVV subunits was significantly diminished compared with the YFP-NR1-3a subunit, confirming the conclusion that an intact PDZ interaction is necessary for the robust surface delivery of NR1 subunits. Unexpectedly, both YFP-NR1-3a ΔPDZ and YFP-NR1-3a RVV subunits trafficked to the cell surface significantly more than the YFP-NR1-1a subunit. This observation shows that even when the PDZ-binding domain is not functional, the C2′ cassette can negate the C1 cassette-mediated ER retention. In conclusion, our data support a model in which both C1 and C2 cassettes have an inhibitory effect, whereas both C0 and C2′ cassettes have an enhancing effect on the surface trafficking of the full-length NR1 subunits. The number and composition of NMDA receptors present at surface membranes are highly regulated. Although the biophysical properties of the NMDA receptors on the surface were extensively studied, NMDA receptors must be first assembled in the ER, modified in the Golgi apparatus, and then sorted in the trans-Golgi network. However, these processes remain largely unexplored. In this study, we have focused on the characterization of the mechanisms governing the trafficking of the NR1 subunits to the cell surface. We found that two different ER retention motifs present in the C1 cassette, KKK and RRR, are responsible for the ER retention of the full-length NR1 subunits. This ER retention can be overcome by the presence of the C2′ cassette even when the PDZ-binding domain in the far C terminus of this cassette is not functional. We further demonstrated that the C0 cassette has an enhancing effect and that the C2 cassette has an inhibitory effect on the surface targeting of the full-length NR1 subunits. ER Retention of Full-length NR1 Subunits Mediated by the C1 Cassette-Previous studies identified an RRR motif as a major ER retention site for the C1 cassette-mediated ER retention of the single transmembrane domain chimeric proteins with an appended C-terminal region from the NR1-1 subunit (5Standley S. Roche K.W. McCallum J. Sans N. Wenthold R.J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 6Scott D.B. Blanpied T.A. Swanson G.T. Zhang C. Ehlers M.D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3063-3072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Xia H. Hornby Z.D. Malenka R.C. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 41: 714-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Our finding that there are two independent ER retention motifs in the C1 cassette, KKK and RRR, shows that the trafficking of the full-length NR1 subunits is likely regulated somewhat differently than the trafficking of the chimeric proteins. It also suggests that a more complex regulation than previously thought controls the ER retention of the NR1 subunits because the M3 domain of the NR1 subunit contains an additional ER retention signal (10Horak M. Chang K. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3500-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We cannot rule out the possibility that the C2 cassette, which plays an inhibitory role in the trafficking of NR1 subunits, plays an additional role in the C1 cassette-mediated ER retention of NR1 subunits. A recent paper has shown that the replacement of the RRR ER retention motif with three alanines is sufficient for a slight release of the full-length NR1-1 subunits to the cell surface of HEK-293 cells (17Kenny A.V. Cousins S.L. Pinho L. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 324-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), which is not in agreement with our results. A similar mechanism of ER retention employing multiple ER retention motifs has been proposed for the kainate receptor subunit KA2 (18Nasu-Nishimura Y. Hurtado D. Braud S. Tang T.T. Isaac J.T. Roche K.W. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7014-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of serine residues adjacent to the RRR ER retention motif can suppress ER retention of single transmembrane chimeric proteins containing the C terminus of the NR1-1 subunit (6Scott D.B. Blanpied T.A. Swanson G.T. Zhang C. Ehlers M.D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3063-3072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Xia H. Hornby Z.D. Malenka R.C. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 41: 714-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 9Scott D.B. Blanpied T.A. Ehlers M.D. Neuropharmacology. 2003; 45: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Here, we have shown that protein kinase A/protein kinase C activation and replacement of Ser896 and/or Ser897 with phosphomimic residues do not negate the C1 cassette-mediated ER retention of the full-length subunit. This observation, supported by our previous study (5Standley S. Roche K.W. McCallum J. Sans N. Wenthold R.J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), is consistent with our finding that two ER retention motifs, KKK and RRR, are present in the C1 cassette, and thus, both signals must be masked before the subunit can leave the ER. Interestingly, the presence of a PDZ-binding domain in the C terminus of the NR1-1 subunit was able to negate both ER retention motifs in the C1 cassette and release the full-length subunit to the cell surface. Indeed, this finding is in agreement with the observation showing that the full-length NR1-3 subunit reaches the cell surface and indicates that other cassettes in the C terminus of the NR1 subunit play a regulatory role in the surface trafficking of the NR1 subunits to the cell surface (4Okabe S. Miwa A. Okado H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7781-7792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Standley S. Roche K.W. McCallum J. Sans N. Wenthold R.J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Role of Other C-terminal Cassettes in Regulation of Surface Delivery of NR1 Subunits-We reported previously that the NR1 subunit truncated five amino acid residues after M4 is slightly transported to the cell surface (10Horak M. Chang K. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3500-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, when we truncated the NR1 subunit immediately after the C0 cassette, robust surface labeling was seen, indicating that the C0 cassette contains an export signal. The serial truncation and replacement of amino acid residues in the proximal region of the C0 cassette revealed that no specific motif is likely responsible for the export of the full-length subunit to the cell surface, although some significant changes in the surface delivery of these constructs were observed. These findings support the idea that the presence of the C0 cassette can negate the ER retention of the NR1 subunit mediated through the M3 domain. One possible mechanism is that C0 regulates the structure of the M4 domain and other surrounding regions critical for the release of the full-length NR1 subunit from the ER (10Horak M. Chang K. Wenthold R.J. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3500-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a 28-amino acid segment following M4 in the GluRδ2 subunit and a shorter segment immediately following M4 of the NR2B subunit have been shown to be critical for the release of receptors from the ER to the cell surface (19Hawkins L.M. Prybylowski K. Chang K. Moussan C. Stephenson F.A. Wenthold R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28903-28910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 20Matsuda I. Mishina M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We tested the effect of the C2 cassette on the trafficking of the NR1 subunits to the cell surface. Our experiments showed that the C2 cassette has an inhibitory effect on the surface targeting of the full-length NR1-2 subunit, which is consistent with previous observations showing that the NR1-2 subunit traffics less to the cell surface than the NR1-4 subunit and that the C2 cassette slows the ER export of the chimeric protein containing this cassette (4Okabe S. Miwa A. Okado H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7781-7792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Mu Y. Otsuka T. Horton A.C. Scott D.B. Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2003; 40: 581-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Finally, we studied the role of the C2′ cassette in the surface targeting of NR1 subunits. Previous data showed that the chimeric protein with an appended C terminus from the NR1-3 subunit reaches the cell surface but that deletion of the PDZ-binding domain from the C2′ cassette results in the ER retention of the chimeric protein (5Standley S. Roche K.W. McCallum J. Sans N. Wenthold R.J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 6Scott D.B. Blanpied T.A. Swanson G.T. Zhang C. Ehlers M.D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3063-3072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the current conclusion is that the PDZ-binding domain can negate the RRR ER retention motif in the C1 cassette. Furthermore, it has been reported that an intact COPII but not PDZ interaction is required for the accelerated C2′-mediated protein trafficking from the ER (8Mu Y. Otsuka T. Horton A.C. Scott D.B. Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2003; 40: 581-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Because these conclusions have not been directly tested using full-length subunits, we asked the following questions. 1) Are intact PDZ and/or COPII interactions required for enhancement of the surface trafficking of the NR1-4 subunit mediated by the C2′ cassette? 2) Are intact PDZ and/or COPII interactions required for negating the C1 cassette-mediated ER retention in the NR1-3 subunit? Our experiments showed that the disruption of PDZ and/or COPII interactions decreased the surface trafficking of both the NR1-4 and the NR1-3 subunits (Figs. 5 and 6). These results do not support the conclusion that a COPII interaction can enhance forward trafficking of the NR1 subunits, obtained using chimeric proteins (8Mu Y. Otsuka T. Horton A.C. Scott D.B. Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2003; 40: 581-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). A PDZ interaction is likely mediated by the PSD-95 family proteins, which have been shown to be able to interact with the NR1-4 subunit in heterologous cells (5Standley S. Roche K.W. McCallum J. Sans N. Wenthold R.J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 887-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). At least one of the members of this family, SAP102, is endogenously expressed in COS-7 cells (21Davey F. Hill M. Falk J. Sans N. Gunn-Moore F.J. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Interestingly, compared with the NR1 subunit truncated after the C0 cassette or with the NR1-1 subunit, the NR1-4 and the NR1-3 subunits lacking PDZ/COPII domains reached the cell surface significantly more. Together, our findings show that the PDZ interaction but not COPII protein interaction can enhance the trafficking of the C2′ cassette-containing NR1 subunits to the cell surface and negate the ER retention mediated by the C1 cassette. In addition, our data indicate that the region of the C2′ cassette preceding the PDZ-binding domain contains another domain that is able to accelerate the surface trafficking of the NR1 subunit and negate the C1 cassette-mediated ER retention of NR1 subunits but to a lesser extent than the PDZ-binding domain. Physiological Implications-Our results show that each cassette in the C terminus of NR1 subunits plays a unique role in the trafficking of the full-length subunit to the cell surface. What are the physiological implications of our findings? Given that NR1 subunits are expressed in stoichiometric excess in the central nervous system and have rapid turnover rates in cells, the precise timing of ER retention and trafficking of NR1 subunits within different compartments regulated by C-terminal cassettes can be a crucial step in the assembly of functional NMDA receptors (22Huh K.H. Wenthold R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). This view is supported by the observation that the NR2A and NR2B subunits associate differently with specific NR1 splice variants in the central nervous system (23Sheng M. Cummings J. Roldan L.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1994; 368: 144-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar) and that the C-terminal splicing of NR1 subunits regulates the number of surface functional NMDA receptors (4Okabe S. Miwa A. Okado H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7781-7792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our preliminary results show that the disruption of both KKK and RRR ER retention motifs in the C1 cassette does not affect the surface targeting of NR1/NR2B receptors in heterologous cells. This observation shows that the NR1 C-terminal regulatory mechanisms can be negated after the assembly of NR1/NR2 receptors. Another interesting aspect of having different NR1 splice variants expressed in the central nervous system is that each variant can interact with a different combination of binding partners and that these interactions can tightly regulate intracellular trafficking of the NR1 subunits. For example, the C1 cassette can directly interact with calmodulin, yoatio, and neurofilament L-protein (24Ehlers M.D. Fung E.T. O’Brien R.J. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 720-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Ehlers M.D. Zhang S. Bernhadt J.P. Huganir R.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 26Lin J.W. Wyszynski M. Madhavan R. Sealock R. Kim J.U. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2017-2027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of the C1 cassette can regulate association with calmodulin (27Hisatsune C. Umemori H. Inoue T. Michikawa T. Kohda K.

Indeed, both ER retention motifs present in the C1 cassette, KKK and RRR, can likely interact with different binding partners so that precise localization of the NR1 subunit can be regulated under various conditions. Finally, the importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying the trafficking of the NR1 variants is emphasized by observations that the C1 cassette regulates NMDA receptor-induced gene expression (28Bradley J.

https://openalex.org/W1971648963,"The BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins are involved in the maintenance of genome stability and germ-line loss-of-function mutations in either BRCA1 or BRCA2 strongly predispose carriers to cancers of the breast and other organs. It has been demonstrated previously that inhibiting elements of the cellular DNA maintenance pathways represents a novel therapeutic approach to treating tumors in these individuals. Here, we show that inhibition of the telomere-associated protein, Tankyrase 1, is also selectively lethal with BRCA deficiency. We also demonstrate that the selectivity caused by inhibition of Tankyrase 1 is associated with an exacerbation of the centrosome amplification phenotype associated with BRCA deficiency. We propose that inhibition of Tankyrase 1 could be therapeutically exploited in BRCA-associated cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1963874300,"Activation of the protein kinases ATM and ATR following chromosomal breakage prevents initiation of DNA replication and entry into mitosis. However, the effects of ATM and ATR activation in cells already progressing through mitosis are poorly understood. Here we report that ATM and ATR activation induced by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) inhibits centrosome-driven spindle assembly in Xenopus laevis mitotic egg extract and somatic cells, delaying mitotic progression. Using a cDNA expression library to screen for ATM and ATR substrates, we identified centrosomal protein CEP63 as an ATM and ATR target required for normal spindle assembly. ATM and ATR phosphorylate Xenopus CEP63 (XCEP63) on Ser 560 and promote its delocalization from the centrosome. Suppression of ATM and ATR activity or mutation of XCEP63 Ser 560 to Ala prevented spindle assembly defects. Consistently, inactivation of the CEP63 gene in avian DT40 cells impaired spindle assembly and prevented ATM- and ATR-dependent effects on mitosis. These data indicate that ATM and ATR control mitotic events in vertebrate cells by targeting CEP63 and centrosome dependent spindle assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2000309201,"The heterotrimeric Toc core complex of the chloroplast protein import apparatus contains two GTPases, Toc159 and Toc34, together with the protein-conducting channel Toc75. Toc159 and Toc34 are exposed at the chloroplast surface and function in preprotein recognition. Together, they have been shown to facilitate the import of photosynthetic proteins into chloroplasts in Arabidopsis. Consequently, the ppi2 mutant lacking atToc159 has a non-photosynthetic albino phenotype. Previous mutations in the conserved G1 and G3 GTPase motifs abolished the function of Toc159 in vivo by disrupting targeting of the receptor to chloroplasts. Here, we demonstrate that a mutant in a conserved G1 lysine (atToc159 K868R) defective in GTP binding and hydrolysis can target and assemble into Toc complexes. We show that atToc159 K868R can support protein import into isolated chloroplasts, albeit at lower preprotein binding and import efficiencies compared with the wild-type receptor. Considering the absence of measurable GTPase activity in the K868R mutant, we conclude that GTP hydrolysis at atToc159 is not strictly required for preprotein translocation. The data also indicate that preprotein import requires at least one additional GTPase other than Toc159.

The data also indicate that preprotein import requires at least one additional GTPase other than Toc159. Chloroplast biogenesis requires the import of hundreds of cytoplasmically synthesized proteins into the chloroplast. Most of them are synthesized as preproteins with a transit sequence specifying import into the organelle (1Bruce B.D. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 440-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Inside the chloroplast, the transit sequence is cleaved by the stromal-processing peptidase (SPP) (2Richter S. Lamppa G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39497-39502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A dual membrane envelope encloses the chloroplast. Translocon complexes at the outer (Toc) 2The abbreviations used are: Toc/Tic, translocon complexes at the outer/inner chloroplast membrane; TAP, tandem affinity purification; CAB, chlorophyll a/b-binding protein; SSu, small subunit of Rubisco; WT, wild type. and inner membranes (Tic) facilitate recognition and translocation of preproteins. In recent years, many components of the Toc and Tic complexes have been identified and characterized (3Oreb M. Tews I. Schleiff E. Trends Cell Biol. 2008; 18: 19-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 4Kessler F. Schnell D.J.

The Toc complex is heteromeric, consisting of a core of three different proteins (the numbers indicate the molecular mass in kDa), Toc159, Toc34, and Toc75, which in vitro may be sufficient for translocation (6Schleiff E. Soll J. Kuchler M. Kuhlbrandt W. Harrer R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Toc75 represents the protein-conducting channel of the Toc complex and is related to bacterial Omp85 known to be involved in the insertion of hydrophobic β-barrel proteins in bacteria and the mitochondrial outer membrane (7Gentle I.E. Burri L. Lithgow T. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 1216-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Toc159 and Toc34 are homologous GTP-binding proteins. Their GTP-binding domains (G-domains) are exposed at the surface of the chloroplast (8Kessler F. Blobel G. Patel H.A. Schnell D.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In addition to the G-domain, Toc159 has a large cytosolic N-terminal acidic (A-) domain of unknown function and a C-terminal membrane anchoring (M-) domain, which is mostly hydrophilic in sequence. Toc34 consists largely of its G-domain anchored in the outer membrane by a C-terminal hydrophobic sequence (9Hiltbrunner A. Bauer J. Alvarez-Huerta M. Kessler F. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Biochemical work has demonstrated the importance of the concerted (inter-)actions of the Toc159 and Toc34 G-domains and their GTPase activities in preprotein import (10Wallas T.R.

The precise mechanisms and sequence of reactions occurring at the GTPases, however, remain, unclear. Two models have been proposed to explain the function of the Toc GTPases, the “targeting model” and the “motor model.” In the targeting model, Toc159 functions as the primary receptor delivering the preprotein to Toc34 and assisting its insertion into the Toc75 channel. Toc159 will then pick up a new preprotein and repeat the cycle (11Smith M.D. Rounds C.M. Wang F. Chen K. Afitlhile M. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 12Smith M.D. Hiltbrunner A. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this model, one GTP binding and hydrolysis cycle of Toc159 is required for the delivery of each preprotein. In the motor model, Toc34 functions as the primary receptor delivering preproteins to Toc159. Subsequently, Toc159, functioning as a motor protein, drives the preprotein across the Toc75 channel (6Schleiff E. Soll J. Kuchler M. Kuhlbrandt W. Harrer R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 541-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 15Schleiff E. Jelic M. Soll J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this model, one or more GTP hydrolysis cycles at Toc159 are required to achieve translocation of preprotein across the outer chloroplast membrane. The crystal structures of the Toc34 G-domains of Arabidopsis (atToc33) and pea (psToc34) have shed light on the structure of the G-domains of Toc-GTPases (17Yeh Y.H. Kesavulu M.M. Li H.M. Wu S.Z.

Structure. 2008; 16: 585-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The overall fold and the G1 and G3 motifs are conserved with the GTPase superfamily. But when compared with the prototypical Ras protein, Toc GTPase G-domains contain additional stretches of amino acids including a motif that appears to be involved in the hetero- and homodimerization. The activities of a number of mutations of the G1-motif have been characterized in vitro using the recombinant, purified G-domains. The atToc159 A864R/K868N/S869R triple mutation (known as mGTP mutant) reduced GTP binding to below 5% of the wild type and GTP hydrolysis was no longer detectable (14Bauer J. Hiltbrunner A. Weibel P. Vidi P.A. Alvarez-Huerta M. Smith M.D. Schnell D.J. Kessler F. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained for the atToc159 K868R mutation (around 20% GTP binding, no detectable GTP hydrolysis) (12Smith M.D. Hiltbrunner A. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In contrast, the atToc159 A864R mutant bound GTP as the wild type but showed a lower hydrolytic rate than the wild type (12Smith M.D. Hiltbrunner A. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 20Wang F. Agne B. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, both the T-DNA insertion mutants of atToc159 (plastid protein import mutant 2; ppi2; albino) (21Bauer J. Chen K. Hiltbunner A. Wehrli E. Eugster M. Schnell D. Kessler F. Nature. 2000; 403: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and atToc33 (ppi1; pale green) (22Jarvis P. Chen L.J. Li H. Peto C.A. Fankhauser C. Chory J. Science. 1998; 282: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) have photosynthetic phenotypes suggesting their involvement in the import of photosynthetic proteins into the nascent chloroplast. But many non-photosynthetic proteins are imported normally into both of these mutants. This import activity has been attributed to the homologs of atToc159 (atToc132, -120, and -90) and atToc33 (atToc34) (23Kubis S. Patel R. Combe J. Bedard J. Kovacheva S. Lilley K. Biehl A. Leister D.

Cell. 2004; 15: 3379-3392Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Moreover, atToc159/-33/-75 and atToc132/-120/-34/-75 may be present in separate heteromeric Toc complexes and represent pathways specific to photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic, housekeeping preproteins, respectively (9Hiltbrunner A. Bauer J. Alvarez-Huerta M. Kessler F. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 25Ivanova Y. Smith M.D. Chen K. Schnell D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3379-3392Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The ppi2 mutant has been exploited to dissect the domain requirements of atToc159 using complementation assays (14Bauer J. Hiltbrunner A. Weibel P. Vidi P.A. Alvarez-Huerta M. Smith M.D. Schnell D.J. Kessler F. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 26Lee K.H. Kim S.J. Lee Y.J. Jin J.B. Hwang I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36794-36805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The complementation experiments demonstrated that the G-domain is essential. The characterized GTPase mutations, the atToc159 mGTP triple point mutation (A864R, K868N, S869R) (G1 motif) (14Bauer J. Hiltbrunner A. Weibel P. Vidi P.A. Alvarez-Huerta M. Smith M.D. Schnell D.J. Kessler F. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 36794-36805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) prevented atToc159 from inserting into the outer chloroplast membrane and from assembling into the Toc complex. These experiments clearly demonstrate an essential role of the Toc159 G-domain in the assembly of Toc159 into Toc complex. But because the mutants stayed in the cytosol, the functions of the G-domain in protein translocation could not be analyzed further in these mutants. A recent study demonstrated that atToc159 A864R increases preprotein import into isolated chloroplasts despite its reduced hydrolysis activity (20Wang F. Agne B. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here, we identify the atToc159 K868R single point mutation as a non-lethal Toc159 GTPase mutant still able to assemble into the Toc complex. We demonstrate an inhibitory effect of the K868R mutation on preprotein binding and import. Because of its strong defect in GTP hydrolysis, we conclude that hydrolysis is not directly implicated in the preprotein binding and translocation mechanism. Import experiments in the atToc159 K868R background using the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog GMP-PNP indicate preprotein import requires additional GTPases other than Toc159. Plant Growth Conditions-Plants were grown on soil (“Rasenerde Top Dressing,” Ricoter AG) or in vitro on 0.8% Phyto Agar (Duchefa, Haarlem, The Netherlands) containing 0.5× Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium (Duchefa) under short day conditions (8-h light, 16-h dark, 120 μmol m-2 s-1, 21 °C). For import experiments, the in vitro growth medium was complemented with 0.8% w/v sucrose. atToc159 Constructs: Binary Vectors for Stable Plant Transformation-For cloning of pCHF7-NTAPi-Toc159GM, the coding sequence for the tandem affinity purification tag (NTAPi) was amplified from plasmid pTN289-NTAPi (27Rohila J.S.

The binary vector pCHF7 (Dr. Christian Fankhauser, Center for Integrative Genomics, University of Lausanne, CH) contains two CaMV35S eukaryotic promotors, one of them having a duplicated enhancer region, an rbcs terminator, and the phosphinotricin acetyltransferase (pat) gene for transgene selection. For the cloning of pCHF7-NTAPi-Toc159GM K868R, the coding sequence for the G-domain of atToc159 was amplified from pET21d-Toc159aa727-1093 (28Weibel P. Hiltbrunner A. Brand L. Kessler F. J. Biol.

The resulting plasmid pETM40-Toc159G was the template to introduce the K868R point mutation along with an additional AseI restriction site using complementary primers qc_K868R_s (5′-CCG GGG TGG GAA GAA GTG CTA CTA TTA ATT CCA TTT TGG G-3′) and qc_K868R_r (5′-CCC AAA ATG GAA TTA ATA GTA GCA CTT CTT CCC ACC CCG G-3′) via QuikChange® Site-directed Mutagenesis (Stratagene). The construct pETM40-Toc159G K868R was digested with NcoI and StuI, and the fragment was ligated into BspHI/StuI-digested pCHF7-NATPi-Toc159GM. pCHF7-NTAPi-Toc159 and pCHF7-NTAPi-Toc159 K868R were obtained by cloning the NcoI/StuI fragment derived from pET21-Toc159 (21Bauer J.

For pET21d-Toc159GM mGTP, a cDNA fragment encoding atToc159aa728-852 was amplified from pET21d-Toc159 using primers 5′-CAT GTC ATG ACT AGT CAG GAT GGT ACG AA-3′ and 5′-CAT GGA GCT CTT CGT TGC CCT CAG CCT CAG-3′. A second cDNA fragment coding for Toc159aa851-1503 (A864R/K868N/S869R) was amplified from the same template using primers 5′-CAT GGA GCT CAT CTT CTC CCT AAA CAT ACT GGT CCT TGG AAA ACG CGG GGT GGG AAA CAG AGC TAC TAT AAA TTC CAT TTT G-3′ and 5′-CCC AAG CTT GAA TTC TTA GTA CAT GCT GTA CTT GTC G-3′. The cDNA fragments were digested either with BspHI and SacI or with SacI and HindIII and ligated in one step into the NcoI/HindIII site of pET21d resulting in pET21d-Toc159GM mGTP. pET21d-Toc159GM K868R was cloned in the same way as pET21d-Toc159GM mGTP but with primer 159K868R (5′-CAT GGA GCT CAT CTT CTC CCT AAA CAT ACT GGT CCT TGG AAA AGC CGG GGT GGG AAg AAG TGC TAC TAT AAA-3′) as sense primer in the second PCR reaction. Plant Transformation-Stable transformation of heterozygous Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Wassilewskija) ppi2 plants was carried out using the floral dip method (29Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were selected by screening the T1 generation for BASTA (phosphinotricin). To determine the genotypes and the presence of transgenes, DNA isolated from seedlings was analyzed by PCR using primers specific for ppi2 allele (forward 5′-GAA TAG GGT TTT AAT CGG AAG-3′ and reverse 5′-GAT GCA ATC GAT ATC AGC CAA TTT TAG AC-3′), the wild-type atTOC159 gene (forward 5′-GAA TAG GGT TTT AAT CGG AAG-3′ and reverse 5′-TGC CAC ATC AAC ATG CAC TG-3′) or the transgene (forward 5′-TCT CCA CTG ACG TAA GGG AT-3′ and reverse 5′-GCC TGT CCT ATA GAC TGT TG-3′). The presence of the K868R mutation was confirmed by digestion of the transgene specific PCR product with AseI and sequencing. Detection of Protein Expression by Western Blotting-Proteins were isolated from Arabidopsis leaves according to (30Rensink W.A. Pilon M. Weisbeek P.

Subcellular Fractionation and Membrane Extraction-Seedlings were ground in mortar in an extraction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% v/v protease inhibitor mixture for plant cell extracts (Sigma P9599). The protein extract was centrifuged for 10 min at 1,500 × g. The supernatant was passed through a 200-μm nylon mesh and subjected to centrifugation (Beckmann, SW55-Ti, 100,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C). The 100,000 × g pellet fraction was treated with extraction buffer or extraction buffer supplemented with 2 m NaCl or 100 mm Na2CO3, pH 11.5 followed by centrifugation (Beckmann, SW55-Ti, 100,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C). Transient Expression and in Vivo Targeting of RbcS-nt:GFP in ppi2 Protoplasts-Protoplasts were isolated from leaf tissue of ppi2 plants using the method described previously (33Jin J.B. Kim Y.A.

At 12 h after transformation, total protein extracts from transformed protoplasts were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-GFP and atToc159 antibodies. Chloroplast Import Experiments-Intact chloroplasts of 4-week-old in vitro grown Arabidopsis plants were isolated according to Ref. 34Fitzpatrick L.M. Keegstra K.

Cellulase Onozuka R-10 and macerozyme R-10 (Serva 16419, 28302) were used at 1.5% and 0.375% w/v, respectively. The breakage buffer was supplemented with 0.1% v/v protease inhibitor mixture for plant cell extracts (Sigma P9599). Chloroplasts were purified on a Percoll step gradient (40% v/v and 85% v/v in 300 mm sorbitol, 20 mm Tricine-KOH, pH 8.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA) rather than a linear gradient. For each import reaction chloroplasts corresponding to 15 μg of chlorophyll and 5 μl of in vitro translated (TnT® T7 Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation System, Promega) preprotein of the small subunit of Rubisco (pSSu) were used. Where indicated chloroplasts were preincubated with 10 mm GMP-PNP for 5 min at room temperature in the dark and for 15 min at 4 °C in the light prior to starting the import reactions with the preprotein substrate. For preprotein binding reactions/early import intermediate formation, the preprotein substrate was dialysed against 330 mm sorbitol, 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8 to remove nucleotides. Chloroplasts were held on ice in the dark for 20 min prior to the assays to deplete of internal ATP. Energy-depleted chloroplasts corresponding to 25 μg of chlorophyll were incubated in the presence or absence of 0.1 mm ATP and 0.1 mm GTP with the dialysed preprotein at 25 °C for 10 min in the dark. Chloroplasts were reisolated by centrifugation through a 35% v/v Percoll cushion. All samples of chloroplast binding and import reactions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by phosphorimaging (BioRad, Personal Molecular Imager Fx). For quantification the Quantity One® software (BioRad) was used. Toc159 Targeting Assays-Toc159 chloroplast targeting reactions were done according to Ref. 14Bauer J. Hiltbrunner A. Weibel P.

After the targeting reactions, chloroplasts were reisolated via a 35% v/v Percoll cushion and thermolysin was used at 50 μg/ml. TAP Purification Procedure-4-week-old in vitro grown seedlings were homogenized in extraction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% v/v Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% v/v protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P9599) followed by incubation on an overhead shaker for 20 min at 4 °C. Insoluble material was separated by centrifugation. 900 μg of protein of each supernatant fraction was incubated with 50 μl of pre-equilibrated IgG Sepharose fast flow (GE Healthcare) for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing five times with 1 ml of extraction buffer, proteins bound to IgG Sepharose were eluted with 0.1 m glycine-HCl pH 3.0, concentrated by chloroform/methanol precipitation and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Complementation of ppi2-Earlier work demonstrated reduced GTP binding as well as the absence of measurable GTP hydrolysis activity in the recombinant atToc159 G-domain containing the K868R mutation (12Smith M.D. Hiltbrunner A. Kessler F. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To analyze the effects of the K868R mutation in vivo, we engineered a T-DNA construct encoding the wild-type G- and M-domains of atToc159 (Toc159aa728-1503) or the same construct carrying the K868R mutation, respectively. The A-domain is known to be non-essential. For detection and purification we replaced its sequence by an N-terminal TAP tag consisting of two IgG binding domains of protein A and calmodulin-binding protein (CBP) (27Rohila J.S. Chen M. Cerny R. Fromm M.E. Plant J. 2004; 38: 172-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This resulted in TAP-Toc159GM and TAP-Toc159-GM K868R, respectively. With both constructs Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of heterozygous ppi2 plants yielded four transformants heterozygous for the ppi2 insertion. In case of transformation with the TAP-Toc159GM construct an additional transformant homozygous for the ppi2 insertion was isolated. Starting from these transgenic lines non-segregating lines homozygous for ppi2 and the TAP-Toc159GM (line 30) or TAP-Toc159-GM K868R (line B16) insertions were isolated (Fig. 1A and supplemental Table S1). The genotypes were confirmed using wild-type and ppi2 specific primer pairs as well as a primer pair specific for the T-DNA construct (Fig. 1C). An AseI restriction site had been introduced along with the K868R mutation allowing identification of the PCR product with the mutation by AseI digestion (Fig. 1C). Western blotting using A-domain specific antibodies (Fig. 1D, anti-Toc159A) revealed the absence of endogenous atToc159 in the homozygous ppi2 lines. Instead, nonspecific rabbit IgG (Fig. 1D, lower panel) specifically decorated the TAP-tagged transgenic Toc159GM proteins at around 110 kDa. Wild-type and mutated TAP-Toc159GM appeared to be expressed at equivalent levels (Figs. 1D and 2). Both constructs resulted in a green phenotype in the ppi2 background suggesting complementation. Under normal growth conditions as well as in de-etiolation experiments (data not shown) the transgenic plants exhibited phenotypes indistinguishable from wild-type plants. Furthermore no difference in chlorophyll accumulation compared with wild-type plants was observed (Fig. 1B). The homozygous ppi2 mutant has reduced levels of some photosynthetic proteins (21Bauer J. Chen K. Hiltbunner A. Wehrli E. Eugster M. Schnell D. Kessler F. Nature. 2000; 403: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Therefore antibodies against the small subunit (SSu) of Rubisco as well as CAB were used as molecular markers for complementation of ppi2 (Fig. 2). As expected, the two proteins were detected only at low levels in the ppi2 mutant but were accumulated to wild-type levels in the ppi2 lines expressing TAP-Toc159GM and TAP-Toc159-GM K868R. Furthermore, in the same Western blotting experiment we observed higher levels of the atToc159 homolog atToc132 in the ppi2 mutant, whereas TAP-Toc159GM:ppi2 and TAP-Toc159-GM K868R:ppi2 transgenic plants revealed wild-type levels of atToc132. This delivers further evidence for the full complementation of the ppi2 import defect by wild-type and TAP-Toc159GM K868R.FIGURE 2Expression of wild-type or mutated TAP-Toc159GM remedies the deficiency of ppi2 for Rubisco and chlorophyll a/b-binding protein.

https://openalex.org/W2083620770,"Laminins that possess three short arms contribute to basement membrane assembly by anchoring to cell surfaces, polymerizing, and binding to nidogen and collagen IV. Although laminins containing the α4 and α5 subunits are expressed in α2-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy, they may be ineffective substitutes because they bind weakly to cell surfaces and/or because they lack the third arm needed for polymerization. We asked whether linker proteins engineered to bind to deficient laminins that provide such missing activities would promote basement membrane assembly in a Schwann cell model. A chimeric fusion protein (αLNNd) that adds a short arm terminus to laminin through the nidogen binding locus was generated and compared with the dystrophy-ameliorating protein miniagrin (mAgrin) that binds to the laminin coiled-coil dystroglycan and sulfatides. αLNNd was found to mediate laminin binding to collagen IV, to bind to galactosyl sulfatide, and to selectively convert α-short arm deletion-mutant laminins LmΔαLN and LmΔαLN-L4b into polymerizing laminins. This protein enabled polymerization-deficient laminin but not an adhesion-deficient laminin lacking LG domains (LmΔLG) to assemble an extracellular matrix on Schwann cell surfaces. mAgrin, on the other hand, enabled LmΔLG to form an extracellular matrix on cell surfaces without increasing accumulation of non-polymerizing laminins. These gain-of-function studies reveal distinct polymerization and anchorage contributions to basement membrane assembly in which the three different LN domains mediate the former, and the LG domains provide primary anchorage with secondary contributions from the αLN domain. These findings may be relevant for an understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of laminin deficiency states.

These findings may be relevant for an understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of laminin deficiency states. Basement membranes are specialized cell-adherent extracellular matrices consisting primarily of laminins, collagen IV, nidogens, and the heparan sulfate proteoglycans agrin and perlecan (for review, see Ref. 1Yurchenco P.D. Amenta P.S. Patton B.L. Matrix Biol. 2004; 22: 521-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Among these, the laminins constitute a family of heterotrimeric glycoproteins that are essential for the assembly of basement membrane scaffolds (2Smyth N. Vatansever H.S. Murray P. Meyer M. Frie C. Paulsson M. Edgar D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 3Miner J.H. Li C. Mudd J.L. Go G. Sutherland A.E. Development. 2004; 131: 2247-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). One property of laminin thought to be critical for basement membrane assembly is that of its anchorage to cell surfaces, a process that appears to be mediated through the LG domains of the α-subunit. Deletion of the five laminin-111 LG domains or of LG domains 4-5 that contain dystroglycan and sulfatide binding loci or excess inhibiting LG4-5 fragment was found to result in a failure of basement membrane assembly in an experimental Schwann cell model (4Tsiper M.V.

Chem. 2007; 282: 21437-21447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These studies further suggested that the reason laminin anchorage is crucial is that it provides the key linkage between the cell surface and the extracellular matrix scaffolding such that the other basement membrane components become tethered through laminin. A second property of laminin is its polymerization into a network-like scaffolding (7Yurchenco P.D. Tsilibary E.C. Charonis A.S. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7636-7644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y.S. Colognato H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1119-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Laminin-111 (α1β1γ1), the most extensively studied in this regard, self-assembles in a thermally reversible manner with an initial oligomer-forming step followed by a calcium-dependent multimer-forming step (7Yurchenco P.D. Tsilibary E.C. Charonis A.S. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7636-7644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Laminin fragment and domain loss-of-function analyses have provided evidence that polymerization requires the participation of all three (α, β, and γ) LN domains located at the N termini of the short arms (6McKee K.K.

Chem. 1993; 268: 17286-17299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) such that laminins that possess fewer domains (as seen with truncated α3 and α4-laminins) lack the ability to polymerize (6McKee K.K.

A third property of laminin found to contribute to basement membrane assembly and stability is that of the binding of nidogen-1 and nidogen-2 (11Fox J.W. Mayer U. Nischt R. Aumailley M. Reinhardt D. Wiedemann H. Mann K. Timpl R. Krieg T. Engel J. Chu M.L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3137-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 12Pöschl E. Mayer U. Stetefeld J. Baumgartner R. Holak T.A. Huber R.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 5119-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The nidogen-1 interaction is mediated between the laminin γ1-LEb3 domain and the nidogen G3 domain. Nidogen G2 and G3 domains, in turn, bind to collagen IV. Although many basement membranes do not exhibit an absolute requirement of this bridging interaction, it appears likely that the interaction increases basement membrane stability (14Bader B.L.

Development. 2004; 131: 1619-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The principal laminins of Schwann cell endoneurial and skeletal muscle sarcolemmal basement membranes contain the α2-subunit (17Patton B.L. Miner J.H. Chiu A.Y. Sanes J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1507-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The absence of this subunit found in laminins 211 and 221 has been shown to cause a congenital muscular dystrophy and peripheral neuropathy in humans (classified as type MDC1A) and in mice (for review, see Ref. 18Gullberg D. Tiger C.F. Veiling T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 442-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Both defects have been corrected by transgenic expression of full-length laminin α1 subunit, indicating interchangeability of the α1 and α2 chains (19Gawlik K. Miyagoe-Suzuki Y. Ekblom P. Takeda S. Durbeej M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1775-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 20Gawlik K.I. Li J.Y. Petersen A. Durbeej M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 2690-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A characteristic of α2 laminin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy is a compensatory increase in the laminin α4 subunit both in nerve and muscle. The assembly and functions of α4-laminin in basement membrane are not well understood. The protein is thought to be non-polymerizing with low affinity binding for α-dystroglycan, sulfatides, and α6β1 and α7β1 integrins (21Talts J.F. Sasaki T. Miosge N. Gohring W. Mann K. Mayne R.

Sekiguchi K. Matrix Biol. 2006; 25: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Improved muscle function in laminin-deficient dystrophic mice, but not improved nerve function, was observed with transgenic expression of a internal domain-truncated muscle agrin (23Moll J.

Although it is likely that the benefit of effect depends on these interactions, it is less clear whether amelioration of the muscle phenotype is due primarily to the enhancement of α4-laminin adhesion, to alterations of sarcolemmal α5-laminin, or to some other effect. Cultured Schwann cells have provided a useful model with which to study basement membrane assembly (4Tsiper M.V. Yurchenco P.D. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Li S.

Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21437-21447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Studies revealed that the galactosyl sulfatide present on the surface of these cells plays an important role in basement membrane anchorage through their binding to laminins, enabling laminin-dependent signaling through dystroglycan and β1-integrins (5Li S. Liquari P. McKee K.K. Harrison D. Patel R. Lee S. Yurchenco P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 25Weir M.L. Oppizzi M.L. Henry M.D. Onishi A. Campbell K.P. Bissell M.J. Muschler J.L. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4047-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both laminin LN and LG domains were found to be required for laminin assembly of Schwann cell surfaces either in the absence or presence of nidogen and collagen IV (6McKee K.K. Harrison D. Capizzi S. Yurchenco P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21437-21447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Interestingly, neither β1-integrins nor dystroglycan was required for laminin anchorage during initial basement membrane assembly on these cells (5Li S. Liquari P. McKee K.K. Harrison D. Patel R. Lee S. Yurchenco P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These receptors may instead act to link (and hence stabilize) the basement membrane to the underlying cell cytoskeleton (26Yurchenco P. Patton B.L. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2009; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study we asked whether laminin deficits of polymerization resulting from LN domain deletions and/or deficits of cell surface binding resulting from LG-domain deletions could be corrected with laminin-binding proteins that add back missing domain activities. Such synthetic protein reagents could provide analytical tools to help understand the role of different domains in basement membrane assembly with the potential for the development of therapeutic approaches. Because there is a nidogen-binding site on laminin γ1 chain near the intersection of the 3 short arms, we designed a chimeric protein (αLNNd) containing the N-terminal α1 LN-LEa domains attached to nidogen-1 G2-rod-G3 domains. We evaluated the capacity of this synthetic short arm to bind laminin and provide type IV collagen binding in lieu of the nidogen it replaces and compared its behavior in a Schwann cell model of basement membrane assembly with that of muscle (non-neural) miniagrin. The fusion protein was found to specifically facilitate polymer formation and basement membrane accumulation of N-terminal-truncated α1-laminins on cultured Schwann cells, whereas miniagrin corrected adhesion deficits. DNA Constructs-Expression vectors for the mouse laminin α1, human β1, and human γ1 subunits, for deletions of α1LN, α1LN-L4b, α1LG1-5, β1LN and γ1LN, and for chick non-neural miniagrin (mAgrin) 3The abbreviations used are: mAgrin, miniagrin; wt, wild type; EHS, Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Pt/C, platinum/carbon. have been previously described (6McKee K.K.

All other laminin cell lines (LmΔαLN-L4b, LmΔαLN, LmΔβLN, LmΔγLN, and the laminins in which the γ1LN domain was replaced with α1LN or β1LN, i.e. Lmγ1∑α1LN, Lmγ1∑β1LN) and mouse nidogen-1 (pCisNid; gift of Rupert Timpl) were generated as previously described (6McKee K.K.

A stable cell line expressing αLNNd was supplemented with zeocin at 100 μg/ml, whereas recombinant laminin lines were supplemented with puromycin, zeocin, and G418 at a final concentration of 1, 100, and 500 μg/ml, respectively. Immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis of secreted protein was used to confirm expression of trimeric laminin, αLNNd, nidogen-1, and mAgrin in the stable cell lines. The α1, β1, and γ1 laminin chains were detected with antibodies specific for myc (Roche Applied Science), hemagglutinin (Roche Applied Science), and FLAG (Sigma) epitopes, respectively. Nidogen-1 and αLNNd were confirmed with anti-entactin (Chemicon MAB1946). The αLNNd protein was initially purified on heparin-agarose (Sigma H6508), eluted with 0.5 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, concentrated in an Amicon Ultra-15 filter (Millipore, 100,000 molecular weight cutoff), and dialyzed in a 20 mm phosphate, 1 m NaCl buffer. αLN-Nd as well as nidogen were finally purified by metal chelating chromatography as described (Fox et al.

Recombinant laminin was purified from media using heparin-agarose (Sigma) and FLAG M2-agarose as previously described (McKee et al. (6McKee K.K. Harrison D. Capizzi S. Yurchenco P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21437-21447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar)). Co-purified laminin and αLN-Nd were isolated directly on FLAG M2-agarose and prepared as above. Type IV collagen and laminin-111 were extracted from lathyritic mouse EHS tumor and purified as described (31Yurchenco P.D. Furthmayr H. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1839-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Protein Concentrations-EHS-laminin concentrations were determined by absorbance (280 nm) as described (9Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17286-17299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with molarity determined based on the protein mass of 710 kDa. Absorbance was also used to measure the concentration of αLNNd and mAgrin with masses of 156 and 125 kDa, respectively. Protein mass and molar concentrations of laminins containing domain deletions (LmΔLG, 605 kDa; LmΔαLN, 682 kDa; LmΔαLN-L4b, 558 kDa; LmΔ(αLN&LG), 577 kDa) were determined by gel densitometry of their Coomassie Blue-stained bands compared with those of EHS-laminin with corrections as needed for decreased mass. Laminin Polymerization Assay-Aliquots (50 μl) of laminin without or with αLNNd in polymerization buffer were incubated at 37 °C, sedimented to separate polymerized protein, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as previously described in detail (6McKee K.K.

Assay of αLNNd Binding to Laminin and Collagen-IV-One μg of recombinant laminin or collagen-IV was bound to a 96-well flat-bottomed dish (Nunc) in 40 mm sodium carbonate buffer overnight at 4 °C. Plates were blocked with 1 mg/ml BSA in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.06%Triton X-100, then incubated with 2-fold increasing amounts of αLNNd or nidogen (0.013-16 μg/ml). Protein was detected by entactin-specific (i.e. nidogen-1) monoclonal antibody (Chemicon MAB1946), protein A-horseradish peroxidase (Sigma P8651), and o-phenylenediamine (Sigma P3888). To determine collagen binding to αLNNd- or nidogen-bound laminin, one μg of recombinant laminin was coated onto a 96-well flat bottomed dish following by blocking with BSA and 5 μg/ml nidogen or αLNNd incubation for 1 h at room temperature. After 3 washes with phosphate-buffered saline and 0.06%Triton X-100, increasing amounts of collagen-IV (0.01-10 μg/ml) were added for 1 h at room temperature. Bound collagen was detected with collagen-IV-specific anti-body (Chemicon AB 756P), protein A-horseradish peroxidase (Sigma P8651), and o-phenylenediamine (Sigma P3888) with absorbance measured at 492 nm with a TECAN Spectrafluor plate reader. Sulfatide Binding Assay-HSO4-3Galβ1-1′Ceramide (brain galactosyl sulfatides) and galactosyl ceramide (Sigma C4905) were dissolved in methanol, and 0.1 μg was added per immulon-1B microtiter well (ThermoLab systems). The plate was dried overnight at room temperature, and the wells were washed and blocked with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay blocking buffer (1% BSA in TBS-50/Ca2+). Proteins in varying concentrations in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay blocking buffer were added to each well and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Protein binding was detected with a horseradish peroxidase-linked monoclonal FLAG antibody (Sigma) and o-phenylenediamine (Sigma) with absorbance at 492 nm on a TECAN Spectrafluor. Cell Culturing-Schwann cells isolated from sciatic nerves from newborn Sprague-Dawley rats were the kind gift of Dr. James Salzer (New York University). These cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 10% fetal calf serum (Gemini Bio Products), neuregulin (0.5 μg/ml, Sigma), forskalin (0.2 μg/ml, Sigma), 1% glutamine, and penicillinstreptomycin. Cells at passages 11-17 were plated onto 24-well dishes (Denville) and treated with the indicated proteins for 1 h at 37 °C followed by washing and fixation. For electron microscopy (see the supplemental data) cells were plated in 60-mm Permanox dishes (Nalgene, Nunc) 2 days before the addition of proteins. Immunofluorescence Microscopy-Schwann cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Immunofluorescence analysis was conducted as previously described (6McKee K.K. Harrison D. Capizzi S. Yurchenco P.D. J. Biol.

Briefly, cultures were blocked with goat serum and then stained with primary and secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorescent probes. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for laminin-111 β1LN-LEa (anti-E4) and α1LG4-5 (anti-E3, 1/500) were used as described (4Tsiper M.V. Yurchenco P.D. J.

Nidogen epitopes were stained with entactin monoclonal reagent (1/100). mAgrin and Myc-tagged laminins were stained with chick agrin (1/1000;30) and Myc (1/100) antibodies, respectively. Detection of bound primary antibodies was accomplished with Alexa Fluor 488 and 647 goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) at 1:500 and 1:100, respectively, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgM at 1:100 (Jackson Immuno-Research) and counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (32Li S.

Laminin, αLNNd, mAgrin, collagen IV, and nidogen-1 immunofluorescence levels were quantitated from digital images recorded with IPLab 3.7 software (Scanalytics) as described (6McKee K.K. Harrison D.

A segmentation range was chosen to subtract background and accellular immunofluorescence. The sum of pixels and their intensities in highlighted cellular areas of fluorescence were measured and normalized by dividing by the number of cells for each image. Data were expressed as the mean and S.D. of normalized summed intensities SigmaPlot and SigmaStat (Jandel). Rotary-shadowed Pt/C Replicas-Rotary shadow laminins (25-50 μg/ml in 0.15 m ammonium bicarbonate, 60% glycerol) were sprayed onto mica discs, evacuated in a BAF500K unit (Balzers), rotary-shadowed with 0.9 nm Pt/C at an 8° angle, and backed with 8-nm carbon at a 90° angle as otherwise described (9Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17286-17299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The domain and subunit composition of proteins used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. The proteins mAgrin, αLNNd, and LmΔ(αLN&LG) were characterized and compared with LmΔαLN and wt Lm-111 by SDS-PAGE after purification. Molecular Morphology-αLNNd, mAgrin, LmΔαLN-L4b, and wild-type (wt) laminin-111 alone and in complexes were visualized in electron micrographs after Pt/C rotary shadowing (Fig. 2). αLNNd molecules had the appearance of three globular domains separated by two short rods in either an extended or bent configuration. LmΔαLN-L4b molecules had the appearance of a laminin with two rather than three short arms. After incubation of this laminin with αLNNd, a third short arm-like structure could be seen attached to the laminin from one of the two short arms near the junction of the other arms (Fig. 2, arrows), rendering laminin complexes not unlike (wt) laminin-111. mAgrin Pt/C replicas had the appearance of a flexible rod and globular protein in which four sphere-like structures could often be appreciated. After incubation of laminin-111 with mAgrin, the long arm (coiled-coil domain) was often seen to have a short projecting stub at about the mid-point along its length (arrows). Binding Interactions of αLNNd-The chimeric protein was designed to possess three activities, i.e. binding of the C-terminal G3 domain to the laminin γ1 domain LE3b, binding of domains G2 and G3 to type IV collagen, and the laminin α1-short arm component of polymerization that resides in the LN domain. Purified chimeric protein was evaluated for its ability to bind to laminin-111 and to type IV collagen (Fig. 3) in solid phase assays and found to bind to both. Chimeric αLNNd and nidogen-1 bound in an almost identical manner (apparent KD of 0.29 and 0.26 nm, respectively). αLNNd also bound to type IV collagen with an apparent Kd of 4.0 nm (compared with 1.6 nm for nidogen-1). The ability of αLNNd was compared with that of nidogen-1 to mediate attachment of laminin to nidogen (ternary complex). αLNNd did this (KD of 1.4 nm) similar to nidogen-1 (1.4 nm). The next question addressed was whether αLNNd, when bound to a laminin with two short arms, would mediate laminin polymerization (Fig. 4). This was evaluated in a standard self-assembly assay (37 °C) in which the products are separated by sedimentation and evaluated by SDS-PAGE (6McKee K.K. Harrison D. Capizzi S. Yurchenco P.D. J. Biol.

However, when LmΔαLN-L4b and αLNNd were incubated in increasing equimolar concentrations, they co-sedimented in the polymer fraction in a concentration-dependent fashion with apparent critical concentrations"
https://openalex.org/W2023864386,"Physical activity (including exercise) is prescribed for health and there are various recommendations that can be used to gauge physical activity status. The objective of the current study was to determine whether twelve commonly-used physical activity recommendations similarly classified middle-aged men as sufficiently active for general health.We examined the commonality in the classification of physical activity status between twelve variations of physical activity recommendations for general health in ninety men aged 45-64 years. Physical activity was assessed using synchronised accelerometry and heart rate. Using different guidelines but the same raw data, the proportion of men defined as active ranged from to 11% to 98% for individual recommendations (median 73%, IQR 30% to 87%). There was very poor absolute agreement between the recommendations, with an intraclass correlation coefficient (A,1) of 0.24 (95% CI, 0.15 to 0.34). Only 8% of men met all 12 recommendations and would therefore be unanimously classified as active and only one man failed to meet every recommendation and would therefore be unanimously classified as not sufficiently active. The wide variability in physical activity classification was explained by ostensibly subtle differences between the 12 recommendations for thresholds related to activity volume (time or energy), distribution (e.g., number of days of the week), moderate intensity cut-point (e.g., 3 vs. 4 metabolic equivalents or METs), and duration (including bout length).Physical activity status varies enormously depending on the physical activity recommendation that is applied and even ostensibly small differences have a major impact. Approximately nine out of every ten men in the present study could be variably described as either active or not sufficiently active. Either the effective dose or prescription that underlies each physical activity recommendation is different or each recommendation is seeking the same prescriptive outcome but with variable success."
https://openalex.org/W2014423765,"Neonatal death in full-term infants who suffer from perinatal asphyxia (PA) is a major subject of investigation, since few tools exist to predict patients at risk of ominous outcome. We studied the possibility that urine S100B measurement may identify which PA-affected infants are at risk of early postnatal death.In a cross-sectional study between January 1, 2001 and December 1, 2006 we measured S100B protein in urine collected from term infants (n = 132), 60 of whom suffered PA. According to their outcome at 7 days, infants with PA were subsequently classified either as asphyxiated infants complicated by hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy with no ominous outcome (HIE Group; n = 48), or as newborns who died within the first post-natal week (Ominous Outcome Group; n = 12). Routine laboratory variables, cerebral ultrasound, neurological patterns and urine concentrations of S100B protein were determined at first urination and after 24, 48 and 96 hours. The severity of illness in the first 24 hours after birth was measured using the Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology-Perinatal Extension (SNAP-PE). Urine S100B levels were higher from the first urination in the ominous outcome group than in healthy or HIE Groups (p<0.001 for all), and progressively increased. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed a significant correlation between S100B concentrations and the occurrence of neonatal death. At a cut-off >1.0 microg/L S100B had a sensitivity/specificity of 100% for predicting neonatal death.Increased S100B protein urine levels in term newborns suffering PA seem to suggest a higher risk of neonatal death for these infants."
https://openalex.org/W2084669567,"Despite the identification of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) in tumors of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) over 40 years ago, the exact contribution of EBV to BL is undefined. EBV encodes for multiple proteins in latent B cells that affect B cell survival and activation. One such protein, latent membrane protein 2A (LMP2A), protects B cells from numerous pro-apoptotic stimuli. Therefore, we tested whether LMP2A protects B cells from apoptosis induced by aberrant c-MYC expression that precedes and dominates BL. We crossed LMP2A-transgenic mice (LMP2A-Tg), in which all B cells express LMP2A, to a transgenic mouse that expresses a BL translocation of myc (λ-MYC-Tg mice). LMP2A promotes proliferation and protects B cells from MYC-induced apoptosis in λ-MYC-Tg mice. LMP2A also accelerates the development of lymphoma in LMP2A/λ-MYC-Tg mice. Finally, LMP2A increases the expression of Bcl-XL in both pre-tumor B cells and tumor cells, suggesting a mechanism for LMP2A-mediated B cell survival in the presence of MYC. These results support a hypothesis that EBV LMP2A promotes tumor development by protecting pre-tumor B cells that would normally apoptose after the c-myc translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2019159816,"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are responsible for the production of type I IFN during viral infection. Viral elimination by IFN-α-based therapy in more than 50% of patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) suggests a possible impairment of production of endogenous IFN-α by pDCs in infected individuals. In this study, we investigated the impact of HCV on pDC function. We show that exposure of pDCs to patient serum- and cell culture-derived HCV resulted in production of IFN-α by pDCs isolated from some donors, although this production was significantly lower than that induced by influenza and human herpesvirus type 1 (HHV-1). Using specific inhibitors we demonstrate that endocytosis and endosomal acidification were required for IFN-α production by pDCs in response to cell culture-derived HCV. HCV and noninfectious HCV-like particles inhibited pDC-associated production of IFN-α stimulated with Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonists (CpG-A or HHV-1) but not that of IFN-α stimulated with TLR7 agonists (resiquimod or influenza virus). The blockade of TLR9-mediated production of IFN-α, effective only when pDCs were exposed to virus prior to or shortly after CpG-A stimulation, was already detectable at the IFN-α transcription level 2 h after stimulation with CpG-A and correlated with down-regulation of the transcription factor IRF7 expression and of TLR9 expression. In conclusion, rapidly and early occurring particle–host cell protein interaction during particle internalization and endocytosis followed by blockade of TLR9 function could result in less efficient sensing of HCV RNA by TLR7, with impaired production of IFN-α. This finding is important for our understanding of HCV-DC interaction and immunopathogenesis of HCV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2073223709,"Wnts are evolutionarily conserved ligands that signal through beta-catenin-dependent and beta-catenin-independent pathways to regulate cell fate, proliferation, polarity, and movements during vertebrate development. Dishevelled (Dsh/Dvl) is a multi-domain scaffold protein required for virtually all known Wnt signaling activities, raising interest in the identification and functions of Dsh-associated proteins.We conducted a yeast-2-hybrid screen using an N-terminal fragment of Dsh, resulting in isolation of the Xenopus laevis ortholog of Hipk1. Interaction between the Dsh and Hipk1 proteins was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays and mass spectrometry, and further experiments suggest that Hipk1 also complexes with the transcription factor Tcf3. Supporting a nuclear function during X. laevis development, Myc-tagged Hipk1 localizes primarily to the nucleus in animal cap explants, and the endogenous transcript is strongly expressed during gastrula and neurula stages. Experimental manipulations of Hipk1 levels indicate that Hipk1 can repress Wnt/beta-catenin target gene activation, as demonstrated by beta-catenin reporter assays in human embryonic kidney cells and by indicators of dorsal specification in X. laevis embryos at the late blastula stage. In addition, a subset of Wnt-responsive genes subsequently requires Hipk1 for activation in the involuting mesoderm during gastrulation. Moreover, either over-expression or knock-down of Hipk1 leads to perturbed convergent extension cell movements involved in both gastrulation and neural tube closure.These results suggest that Hipk1 contributes in a complex fashion to Dsh-dependent signaling activities during early vertebrate development. This includes regulating the transcription of Wnt/beta-catenin target genes in the nucleus, possibly in both repressive and activating ways under changing developmental contexts. This regulation is required to modulate gene expression and cell movements that are essential for gastrulation."
https://openalex.org/W2031823143,"A well-accepted view of developing circuits is that synapses must be active to mature and persist, whereas inactive synapses remain immature and are eventually eliminated. We question this long-standing view by investigating nonfunctional cholinergic nicotinic synapses in the superior cervical ganglia (SCG) of mice with a disruption in the α3 nicotinic receptor (nAChR) subunit gene, a gene essential for fast synaptic transmission in sympathetic ganglia. Using imaging and electrophysiology, we show that synapses persist for at least 2–3 months without postsynaptic activity; however, the presynaptic terminals lack high-affinity choline transporters (CHTs), and as a result, they are quickly depleted of transmitter. Moreover, we demonstrate with rescue experiments that CHT is induced by signals downstream of postsynaptic activity, converting immature terminals to mature terminals capable of sustaining transmitter release in response to high-frequency or continuous firing. Importantly, postsynaptic neurons must be continually active to maintain CHT in presynaptic terminals."
https://openalex.org/W2002237619,"Subiculum, the primary efferent pathway of hippocampus, participates in memory for spatial tasks, relapse to drug abuse, and temporal lobe seizures. Subicular pyramidal neurons exhibit low-threshold burst firing driven by a spike afterdepolarization. Here we report that burst firing can be regulated by stimulation of afferent projections to subiculum. Unlike synaptic plasticity, burst plasticity did not require synaptic depolarization, activation of AMPA or NMDA receptors, or action potential firing. Rather, enhancement of burst firing required synergistic activation of group I, subtype 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR). When either of these receptors was blocked, a suppression of bursting was revealed, which in turn was blocked by antagonists of group I, subtype 5 mGluRs. These results indicate that the output of subiculum can be strongly and bidirectionally regulated by activation of glutamatergic inputs within the hippocampus and cholinergic afferents from the medial septum."
https://openalex.org/W2085578540,"myo-Inositol is an important constituent of membrane phospholipids and is a precursor for the phosphoinositide signaling pathway. It is synthesized from glucose 6-phosphate by myo-inositol-3-phosphate synthase (IP synthase), a homotrimer composed of a 68-kDa polypeptide in most mammalian tissues. It is a putative target for mood-stabilizing drugs such as lithium and valproate. Here, we show that the rat gene (Isyna1) encoding this enzyme generates a number of alternatively spliced transcripts in addition to the fully spliced form that encodes the 68-kDa subunit (the α isoform). Specifically, we identify a small 16-kDa subunit (the γc isoform) derived by an intron retention mechanism and provide evidence for its existence in rat tissues. The γc isoform is highly conserved in mammals, but it lacks the catalytic domain while retaining the NAD+ binding domain. Both α and γc isoforms are predominantly expressed in many rat tissues and display apparent stoichiometry in purified enzyme preparations. An IP synthase polyclonal antibody not only detects the α and γc isoforms but also several other isoforms in pancreas, intestine, and testis suggesting that the holoenzyme is composed of unique subunits in various tissues. Interestingly, the α isoform is not expressed in the intestine. IP synthase activity assays using purified α and γc isoforms indicate that the latter negatively modulates α isoform activity, possibly by competing for NAD+ molecules.

Chem. 2001; 276: 15466-15471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 10Williams R.S.B. Cheng L. Mudge A.W. Harwood A.J. Nature. 2002; 417: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The brain manifests very high levels of inositol, almost 100 times higher than in blood and other tissues (11Wong Y.H. Kalmbach S.J. Hartman B.K. Sherman W.R. J. Neurochem. 1987; 48: 1434-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12Harwood A.J. Mol. Psychiatry. 2005; 10: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The elevated levels may, in part, be due to its active involvement in the PI signaling pathway, which couples the G-protein activation of numerous receptor systems to the generation of diacylglycerol and IP3, two important second messengers, involved in protein kinase C activation and calcium mobilization, respectively (13Delmas P. Coste B. Gamper N. Shapiro M.S. Neuron. 2005; 47: 179-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 14Berridge M.J.

Profound alterations in brain inositol levels can, therefore, affect brain signaling events leading to severe psychiatric and neurological problems. Altered inositol levels have been observed in the brains of Alzheimer (16McLaurin J. Franklin T. Chakrabartty A. Fraser P.E. J. Mol.

High fetal inositol concentrations in the cerebro-spinal fluid have been attributed to the pathogenesis of Down syndrome (22Berry G.T. Mallee J.J. Kwon H.M. Rim J.S. Mulla W.R. Muenke M. Spinner N.B.

Sterns R.H. Rojiani A.M. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2006; 65: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Inositol is known to reduce anxiety-like behavior in mouse models of psychiatric disorders (29Einat H. Belmaker R.H. J. Affect. Disord. 2001; 62: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Bipolar patients in the manic phase are often treated with lithium or valproate, two commonly used drugs that decrease free inositol levels by inhibiting inositol monophosphatase 1 and IP synthase, respectively (9Vaden D.L. Ding D. Peterson B. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15466-15471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), whereas oral administration of inositol can alleviate the depressive phase of bipolar disorder (30Levine J. Barak Y. Gonzalves M. Szor H. Elizur A. Kofman O. Belmaker R.H. Am. J. Psychiatry. 1995; 152: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, IP synthase is considered to be a potential drug target for mood stabilization (31Ju S. Greenberg M.L. Clin. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 4: 181-187Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 32Agam G. Shamir A. Shaltiel G. Greenberg M.L. Bipolar Disord. 2002; 4: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). IP synthase (EC 5.5.1.4) is a rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the biosynthesis of all inositol containing compounds (33Eisenberg Jr., F. Parthasarathy R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 141: 127-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It converts G6P to myo-inositol 3-phosphate (IP1) via a three-step reaction: (i) oxidation of G6P to 5-keto G6P by NAD+, (ii) intramolecular aldol cyclization to form inosose 2,1-phosphate, and (iii) its reduction to IP1 by NADH. The phosphate moiety in IP1 is subsequently removed by inositol monophosphatase 1 to produce free inositol. The mechanism of enzyme action was first demonstrated in the 1960s by groups led by Eisenberg, Loewus, and Hoffmann-Ostenhof (34Loewus F.A. Kelly S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1962; 7: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 35Eisenberg Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1375-1382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Eisenberg Jr., F.

Z. 1964; 339: 374-381PubMed Google Scholar). Mammalian IP synthase was first purified by Maeda and Eisenberg from rat testes (38Maeda T. Eisenberg Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8458-8464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the principal tissue of mammalian inositol biosynthesis and the richest source of this enzyme. It is present in diverse organisms ranging from prokaryotes (cyanobacteria, eubacteria, and archea) to eukaryotes (fungi, plants, and animals) (39Majumder A.L. Chatterjee A. Dastidar K.G. Majee M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 553: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The native enzyme is typically a homotrimer made up of ∼68-kDa subunits in mammalian cells and a homotetramer in yeast and plant cells. Crystallographic studies indicate that the protein is made up of three domains (40Stein A.J. Geiger J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9484-9491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 41Jin X. Foley K.M. Geiger J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13889-13895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar): (i) a “central domain” comprising the N and C termini, which make the majority of contacts between monomers, (ii) an “NAD-binding domain,” and (iii) a “catalytic domain” that binds the substrate, G6P. The rat enzyme is encoded by the Isyna1 gene, which consists of 11 exons and 10 introns. Human ISYNA1 encodes an mRNA of ∼1.8 kb that is expressed variably in different tissues (42Guan G. Dai P. Shechter I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 417: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) with the highest expression in testis followed by heart, placenta, kidney, and pancreas; intriguingly, brain manifests low expression; almost no expression is observed in peripheral blood leukocytes, colon, and thymus (42Guan G. Dai P. Shechter I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 417: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). ISYNA1 is located in 19p13.1, a susceptibility locus for autism spectrum disorders (43McCauley J.L. Li C. Jiang L. Olson L.M. Crockett G. Gainer K. Folstein S.E. Haines J.L. Sutcliffe J.S. BMC Med. Genet. 2005; 6: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Yeast IP synthase encoded by the INO1 gene has been extensively studied and well characterized (44Greenberg M.L. Lopes J.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1999; 38: 361-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). INO1 expression is repressed in the presence of inositol and derepressed in its absence (46Culbertson M.R. Donahue T.F. Henry S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 126: 232-242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Klig L.S. Henry S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3816-3820Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 48Hirsch J.P. Henry S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3320-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Studies in yeast indicate that lithium and valproate deplete intracellular inositol levels, thereby derepressing INO1 expression. These drugs appear to act by different mechanisms: lithium inhibits inositol monophosphatase 1 preventing IP1 conversion to inositol, whereas valproate inhibits IP synthase resulting in decreased IP1, and therefore to decreased inositol, levels (9Vaden D.L. Ding D. Peterson B. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15466-15471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 49Ju S. Shaltiel G. Shamir A. Agam G. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21759-21765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The therapeutic efficacy of lithium in treating bipolar disorder is attributed to its ability to decrease inositol levels and forms the basis for the “inositol depletion hypothesis” (12Harwood A.J. Mol. Psychiatry. 2005; 10: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 50Berridge M.J. Downes C.P. Hanley M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 411-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar), a theory that has been challenged by others (51Berry G.T. Buccafusca R. Greer J.J. Eccleston E. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2004; 82: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Very little is known about the regulation of mammalian IP synthase. Enzyme activity in testis is found to be decreased in rats subjected to long term diabetes (52Whiting P.H. Palmano K.P. Hawthorne J.N. Biochem. J. 1979; 179: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Decreases in activity have been observed in the reproductive organs and liver of hypophysectomized male rats and in the liver of thyroidectomized male rats (53Hasegawa R. Eisenberg Jr., F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4863-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), whereas estrogen has been found to induce this enzyme in rat uterus (54Rivera-Gonzalez R. Petersen D.N. Tkalcevic G. Thompson D.D. Brown T.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 64: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), suggesting hormonal regulation of IP synthase expression. Hasegawa and Eisenberg (53Hasegawa R. Eisenberg Jr., F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4863-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) conclude that IP synthase in male reproductive organs is under the direct control of the pituitary, whereas in the liver it is mediated by the thyroid. IP synthase activity is also increased in the mammary glands beginning at parturition (55Naccarato W.F. Ray R.E. Wells W.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 164: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Rats treated chronically (10 days) with therapeutic levels of lithium appear to show an increase in IP synthase expression in the hippocampus but not in the frontal cortex (56Shamir A. Shaltiel G. Greenberg M.L. Belmaker R.H. Agam G. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2003; 115: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) implying a regiospecific regulation in brain. Guan et al. (42Guan G. Dai P. Shechter I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 417: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have observed that in HepG2 (liver-derived) cells, glucose and lovostatin increase mRNA expression, the latter invoking a G-protein-coupled signal transduction system. Our earlier work with the human promoter suggests that E2F1 can up-regulate gene expression (57Seelan R.S. Parthasarathy L.K. Parthasarathy R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 431: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Clearly there are many interesting facets to IP synthase regulation that remain quite complex and poorly understood. Adding to this complexity, genome databases such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) have identified novel IP synthase transcripts that have the potential to encode putative isoforms (58Strausberg R.L. Feingold E.A. Grouse L.H. Derge J.G. Klausner R.D. Collins F.S. Wagner L. Shenmen C.M. Schuler G.D. Altschul S.F. Zeeberg B. Buetow K.H. Schaefer C.F. Bhat N.K. Hopkins R.F. Jordan H. Moore T.

More recently, some alternatively spliced transcripts of human IP synthase, associated with exon-skipping, have been found to be increased in the lymphocytes of bipolar patients who have had a family history of major psychiatric disorder (59Shamir A. Shaltiel G. Mark S. Bersudsky Y. Belmaker R.H. Agam G. Bipolar Disord. 2007; 9: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Herein, we report for the first time the identification and characterization of a number of isoforms in rat tissues, focusing primarily on a 16-kDa isoform, transcribed by an intron retention (IR) mechanism, that negatively regulates IP synthase function. Our findings resolve some of the molecular weight paradoxes observed with the native enzyme in various tissues and raise intriguing questions about the role of this enzyme in inositol homeostasis and its dysregulation in psychiatric disorders. Materials-Unless specified, reagents were of analytical grade procured from established manufacturers. Fetal rat tissues (21-day gestation) were obtained from Zivic Laboratories (Zelienople, PA). Normal adult brain tissues (cerebellum and amygdala from a 50-year-old female; hypothalamus and Brodmann Area 10 from 50- to 51-year-old males) were obtained from the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center, Boston, MA, after approval by the R & D Committee, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Louisville, KY. Cell culture media, penicillin-streptomycin, and fetal bovine serum were from Invitrogen (Rock-ville, MD) or ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cell Culture-Serum-free HeLa cells (ATCC No. CCL-2.3) were grown in RPMI 1640 media containing 2% TCH (Celox Laboratories, Inc., St. Paul, MN); SK-N-AS cells (ATCC No. CRL-2137), derived from a human neuroblastoma cell line, were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum; HEK (Human embryonic kidney) 293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573) were grown in FreeStyle 293 medium containing 4 mm GlutaMax (Invitrogen). All cell lines were grown in the presence of penicillin and streptomycin. Northern Blot Analysis-A rat multiple tissue Northern blot from Clontech Laboratories, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA) was used. A full-length Isyna1 cDNA fragment was random-labeled using the Prime-a-Gene labeling system (Promega, Madison, WI) and [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) and purified through a Microspin G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences). The blot was prehybridized in 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2/7% SDS for 2 h at 65 °C and then hybridized with the same buffer containing 1 × 106 cpm/ml of the labeled probe overnight. The blot was washed for 10 min at room temperature in 1 × SSC/0.1% SDS and then at 68 °C. This was followed by two stringent washes at 68 °C in 0.1 × SSC/0.1% SDS for 10 min, after which the blot was enclosed in Saran wrap, placed in a Kodak X-Omatic cassette, and exposed at -70 °C for 1-4 days. The blot was stripped by incubating in 0.5% SDS for 10 min in a boiling water bath and reprobed with a 32P-labeled PCR-amplified rat β-actin cDNA fragment (60Chen J. He L. Dinger B. Stensaas L. Fidone S. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 92: 1480-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Total RNA Isolation and cDNA Synthesis-About 50-100 mg of tissue or 1 × 107 cells was used for the isolation of total RNA by employing either the TRIzol method (Invitrogen) or the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Tissues were homogenized with a VirTishear (Virtis, Gardiner, NY) in Falcon 2059 tubes containing the appropriate buffer, while cells were scrapped off dishes, counted, and passed five times through a 19½-gauge needle. 1 μg of total RNA was treated with RQ1 DNase (Promega) at 37 °C for 20 min, inactivated at 70 °C for 15 min, and then used for oligo(dT)-primed cDNA synthesis using the Thermoscript RT-PCR system (Invitrogen). PCR-PCR was carried out in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Cetus DNA Thermal cycler using TaqDNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Two primer sets were used for amplifying rat cDNA sequences: R-ss2 (exon 4, 5′-CAACGACCTGGTGTTTGATG) with R-as2 (exon 6, 5′-ACGATGACCTTGTCCAATCC), and R-ATGXhoI (exon 2, 5′-TCGCTCGAGGCGATGGAGCCTGCCGCCGAGAT) with R-as3 (exons 6/7, 5′-CCAGGCCAAGCTGGATAGTA). The PCR profiles were 94 °C/2 min, followed by 35 cycles at 94 °C/30 s, 50 °C/45 s, and 72 °C/45 s for the former (amplicon size: 368 bp with intron 4 and 279 bp without) and at 52 °C annealing temperature for the latter (amplicon size: 871 bp with intron 4 and 782 bp without). For humans, H-P2 (exon 3/4, 5′-GGAGGCCAACTACTACGGCT) with H-I4TAA EcoRI (intron 4, 5′-GGGAATTCTCACACTCGGCCCTGCCCGGATC) for the γc cDNA (224-bp amplicon), and H-402 (exon 4, 5′-GAGGTGTTCGTACCCTTCAG) with H-598 (exon 5, 5′-AATTCGGGGATGTAAACAGA) for the α cDNA (192-bp amplicon) were used. PCR, as above, was at an annealing temperature of 50 °C. Because these primers were modified for other use, some carried nt mis-matches (underlined) or restriction enzyme sites. Southern Blot Analysis-PCR products were resolved on 1.2% agarose gels and transferred to Zeta-Probe GT membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The DNA was cross-linked to the membrane at 5000 μJ/cm2 in a GS Gene linker UV chamber (Bio-Rad). Probe preparation, membrane hybridization, and processing were as described for Northern blot analysis. Purification of Rat Testes IP Synthase-All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. About 145 g of decapsulated rat testes were homogenized in a Potter-Elvehjem glass Teflon homogenizer in two volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (standard) buffer and centrifuged at 100,000 × g in a Beckman-L8 Ultra-centrifuge. The clear supernatant was subjected to ammonium sulfate (20-40%) fractionation, and the pellet was dissolved in, and dialyzed against, the standard buffer overnight at 4 °C. The supernatant obtained after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min in a Sorvall RC5B centrifuge was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column (50 ml, equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and eluted with a KCl gradient in the same buffer until a concentration of 0.5 m KCl was reached. 10-ml fractions were collected and assayed for IP synthase activity (33Eisenberg Jr., F. Parthasarathy R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 141: 127-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The active fractions were pooled and loaded onto a G6P affinity column (1.5 × 15 cm), prepared as previously described (33Eisenberg Jr., F. Parthasarathy R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 141: 127-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) in standard buffer, and eluted with a salt gradient of 0.3 m KCl. IP synthase activities were assayed for all fractions, and peak fractions were pooled. A portion of the pooled enzyme was passed through a Bio-Gel column (Bio-Rad, 2.5 × 91 cm, total column volume, 447 ml), and 10-ml fractions were collected. Fractions with peak enzyme activity were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue for purity assessment. Some of these fractions were used for antibody preparation (see below). Partial Purification of IP Synthase from Various Tissues for SDS-PAGE Analysis-Decapsulated rat testes (155 g) from Sprague-Dawley rats were homogenized in 310 ml of ice-cold 0.154 m KCl containing 0.2 mm dithiothreitol and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) using a blender. The homogenate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C using a GSA rotor in a Sorvall RC5B centrifuge. To the clear supernatant, ammonium sulfate was added to 30% saturation and stirred at 4 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation, as above, the clear supernatant was subjected to 40% ammonium sulfate saturation. The pellet obtained after centrifugation was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0 buffer and loaded onto a 16/10 HiTrap phenyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 25% ammonium sulfate in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 0.2 mm dithiothreitol. After washing extensively with the equilibrating buffer, the bound proteins were eluted with a 25-0% linear gradient of ammonium sulfate in the same buffer. 5-ml fractions were collected, and IP synthase-containing fractions were identified by Western blot analysis using the R-10 antibody (see below). These fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, buffer and passed over a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with Tris acetate buffer. After washing with the same buffer, bound proteins were eluted with a 0-0.3 m linear gradient of NaCl in Tris acetate buffer. Fractions of 4 ml were collected. The active fractions containing IP synthase activity were resolved into two peaks of activity. The first (Peak I) represented partially purified IP synthase containing both the 68-kDa α and the 16-kDa γc isoforms, whereas the second (Peak II) represented only the 68-kDa α isoform devoid of the γc isoform (see “Results”). Peak II fractions were pooled and concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation and dialyzed in Tris acetate buffer. These fractions were used for IP synthase activity determinations. Peak fractions were analyzed by Western blotting using the R-10 antibody and stored at -70 °C in the presence of 0.02% sodium azide. Pancreas (∼5 g) and intestine (∼210 g, cut into 1-inch pieces) pooled from several rats were processed similarly, except that the ammonium sulfate precipitate between 25 and 50% saturation was used. Purification was carried out until the phenyl-Sepharose column chromatography step, and IP synthase fractions (5 ml) were identified by Western blotting and stored as described above. Rat brains (∼25 g) were purified similarly, and the ammonium sulfate precipitate was fractionated on a BioGel (100 × 15 cm) column. Fractions of 5 ml were collected, identified for IP synthase activity, and stored as before. Generation of the R-10 Polyclonal IP Synthase Antibody-Electrophoretically homogeneous rat testis 68-kDa protein (see above) was used to raise polyclonal antibodies in New Zeal"
https://openalex.org/W1984372197,"Many genomes contain a substantial number of transposable elements (TEs), a few of which are known to be involved in regulating gene expression. However, recent observations suggest that TEs may have played a very important role in the evolution of gene expression because many conserved non-genic sequences, some of which are know to be involved in gene regulation, resemble TEs.Here we investigate whether new TE insertions affect gene expression profiles by testing whether gene expression divergence between mouse and rat is correlated to the numbers of new transposable elements inserted near genes. We show that expression divergence is significantly correlated to the number of new LTR and SINE elements, but not to the numbers of LINEs. We also show that expression divergence is not significantly correlated to the numbers of ancestral TEs in most cases, which suggests that the correlations between expression divergence and the numbers of new TEs are causal in nature. We quantify the effect and estimate that TE insertion has accounted for approximately 20% (95% confidence interval: 12% to 26%) of all expression profile divergence in rodents.We conclude that TE insertions may have had a major impact on the evolution of gene expression levels in rodents."

The domain structure includes: (i) a hydrophobic pocket at the N terminus of MDM2 that is involved in both its transrepressor and E3-ubiqutin ligase functions, (ii) a central acid domain that recognizes a ubiquitination signal in the core DNA binding domain of p53, and (iii) a C-terminal C2H2C4 RING finger domain that is required for E2 enzyme-binding and ATP-dependent molecular chaperone activity. Here we show that the binding affinity of MDM2s hydrophobic pocket can be regulated through the RING finger domain and that increases in pocket affinity are reflected by a gain in MDM2 transrepressor activity. Thus, mutations within the RING domain that affect zinc coordination, but not one that inhibits ATP binding, produce MDM2 proteins that have a higher affinity for the BOX-I transactivation domain of p53 and a reduced I0.5 for p53 transrepression. An allosteric model for regulation of the hydrophobic pocket is supported by differences in protein conformation and pocket accessibility between wild-type and the RING domain mutant MDM2 proteins. Additionally the data demonstrate that the complex relationship between different domains of MDM2 can impact on the efficacy of anticancer drugs directed toward its hydrophobic pocket.

The tumor suppressor protein p53 is a transcription factor that plays a key role in the control of pathways that protect cells from malignant transformation (1.Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J.

As such, p53 is the most frequently inactivated protein in human cancers (3.Hollstein M. Rice K. Greenblatt M.S. Soussi T. Fuchs R. Sorlie T. Hovig E. Smith-Sorensen B. Montesano R. Harris C.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3551-3555PubMed Google Scholar). In response to cellular stress, p53 protein levels are elevated by a decrease in its rate of degradation, and this increase in levels is accompanied by changes in the status of p53 post-translational modifications. Together, elevated levels of p53 and activating post-translational modifications induce its sequence-specific DNA binding and transcriptional activity leading to changes in gene expression that classically result in either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (4.Vousden K.H.

In addition the RING domain houses a P-Walker motif that is required for MDM2 to act as an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone (12.Wawrzynow B. Zylicz A. Wallace M. Hupp T. Zylicz M. J. Biol.

Together these data suggest that binding of the BOX-I activation domain of p53 to the hydrophobic pocket of MDM2 is required for MDM2s oncogenic functions. Recent studies have identified a second MDM2 interaction site within the core domain (BOX-V) of p53 (16.Wallace M. Worrall E. Pettersson S. Hupp T.R. Ball K.L. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 251-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 17.Shimizu H. Burch L.R. Smith A.J. Dornan D. Wallace M. Ball K.L. Hupp T.R. J. Biol.

Mol Cell. 1998; 2: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The BOX-V domain binds to the acid domain of MDM2, and, although this interaction has a relatively low affinity, it is key in determining the rate of p53 ubiquitination as it comprises part of the p53 ubiquitination signal (16.Wallace M. Worrall E. Pettersson S. Hupp T.R. Ball K.L. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 251-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).The current study has used point mutations within critical C2H2C4 resides of the MDM2 RING domain to uncover cross-talk between the zinc coordinating structure and the hydrophobic pocket of MDM2. A gain in the ability of MDM2 to transrepress p53-dependent transcription is seen when zinc-coordinating residues are mutated, whereas mutation of a residue within the RING required for ATP binding has no effect on MDM2 mediated transrepression. Studies on purified MDM2 and p53 provide a mechanism for changes in transrepressor activity by demonstrating that the C2H2C4 RING mutants have a higher affinity for hydrophobic pocket interacting ligands and proteins. Thus, the RING finger domain of MDM2 is linked to the hydrophobic pocket through conformational changes that affect MDM2 transrepressor activity. In addition, the efficacy of small molecules, targeted to the hydrophobic pocket of MDM2, can be determined by the status of the C2H2C4 structure.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Plasmids—Antibodies used were: DO-1 (p53) and 2A10/3G5/4B2/SMP14 (MDM2) produced in-house, p21 was detected using AB1 (Calbiochem).

A375 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C with 10% CO2. MDM2-/-p53-/- cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 10% CO2. Upon reaching 80-90% confluency the cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with the total amount of DNA for all wells kept constant at 0.8 μg. A solution was formed with (30 ng) pGL4.10[luc2] bearing a 44-base stretch of the p21 promoter and with 70 ng of the phRL-CMV plus p53 and MDM2 plasmids as detailed in the figure legends. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, the cells were washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 1× Passive Lysis Buffer (supplied with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System from Promega). Alternatively, Nutlin was added after 24 h (as detailed in the figure legends), and the incubation continued for a further 6 h. Afterward the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay was performed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. For immunoblot analysis transfected cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaF), and lysates were separated on 4-12% NuPAGE (to detect p53 modification) or 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose (16.Wallace M.

Worrall E. Pettersson S. Hupp T.R. Ball K.L. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 251-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).Protein Binding Assays—Recombinant human full-length untagged MDM2 proteins and p53 protein were purified from E. coli as previously described (12.Wawrzynow B.

For peptide and protein binding assays the microtiter wells were adsorbed with streptavidin overnight, washed 6× with phosphate-buffered saline-Tween with biotinylated peptides added for 1 h alternatively the wells were coated with purified p53 (150 ng) as previously described (16.Wallace M. Worrall E. Pettersson S. Hupp T.R. Ball K.L. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 251-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Following extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline-Tween increasing amounts of MDM2 were added either in the absence or presence of Nutlin (as detailed in the figure legends). Following washing (6× washes with phosphate-buffered saline-Tween) MDM2 was detected using the monoclonal antibody 2A10 and a secondary rabbit anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase antibody the wells were developed using ECL. The results were quantified using Fluoroskan Ascent FL equipment (Labsystems) and analyzed with Ascent Software.Tryptic Digestion—wt or mutant MDM2 protein (1 μg) plus trypsin (10 ng) was incubated at 30 °C in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer for up to 30 min. Aliquots were removed, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer and heating at 80 °C for 4 min. The samples were analyzed by 4-12% gradient gels (Invitrogen) and immunoblotted.Intrinsic Fluorescence Assay—Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on a SPEX FLUOROMAX-3 (Jobin Yvon Horiba) spectrofluorometer. The bandwidths for excitation and emission were set at 5 nm, and an excitation wavelength of 295 nm was used. Fluorescence spectra were recorded from 320 to 450 nm in 0.5 nm steps, with an integration time of 1 s. All experiments were carried out at 4 °C in buffer containing: 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 10 μm ZnSO4, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. MDM2wt, MDM2C464A, and MDM2C478S used in this assay were initially preincubated on ice for 5 min at final concentrations raging from 20 nm to 1 μm (Vtotal = 0.5 ml). Each spectrum produced is the average of three emission scans minus the average of the three blanks (buffer) scans.RESULTSC2H2C4 MDM2 Mutant Proteins Have a Gain of Transrepressor Activity—We have recently shown that the E3-ligase activity of MDM2 requires interactions at both the hydrophobic pocket and the acid domain (16.Wallace M. Worrall E. Pettersson S. Hupp T.R. Ball K.L. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 251-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These interactions are linked by an allosteric mechanism, with binding at the hydrophobic pocket favoring recognition of a p53 ubiquitination signal from its core DNA binding domain (BOX-V). This prompted us to ask whether similar mechanisms linked other MDM2 domains and how cooperation between domains impacted on the proteins multifunctional nature. The RING finger domain of MDM2 is required for both its E3-ligase and ATP-dependent chaperone activities through binding to an E2-ubiquitin conjugating enzyme and to ATP, respectively (12.Wawrzynow B. Zylicz A. Wallace M. Hupp T. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32603-32612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 22.Linke K. Mace P.D. Smith C.A. Vaux D.L. Silke J. Day C.L. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). However, whether conformational changes in the RING domain are transmitted to other MDM2 functional domains affecting their activity remains unclear.To study the RING domain in the context of full-length MDM2 we first generated a number of RING finger domain mutant constructs (Fig. 1A). Two of these, Cys464A (MDM2C464A) and Cys478S (MDM2C478S), introduced mutations into the C4 and H2C2 coordination sites of the C2H2C4 structure (21.Kostic M. Matt T. Martinez-Yamout M.A. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 363: 433-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), respectively, and a third, Lys454A (MDM2K454A), is a RING domain residue, which is not required for zinc coordination but is essential for MDM2 to bind ATP (12.Wawrzynow B. Zylicz A. Wallace M. Hupp T. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32603-32612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 23.Poyurovsky M.V. Jacq X. Ma C. Karni-Schmidt O. Parker P.J. Chalfie M. Manley J.L. Prives C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 875-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The Cys464A mutant was chosen because it is the most widely studied E3-ligase-dead MDM2 RING mutant, in addition this cysteine lies within an α-helix, and structure predication using PyMOL suggests that mutation to Ala has little effect on the global structure of the RING or on the extent of solvent exposure. The Cys478S mutant is similarly predicted to have a minimal effect on the local environment, because it lies within an irregular loop structure. To characterize these mutants we first determined the effect of introducing the RING mutations on E3-ligase activity using a cell-based assay. When p53-/-MDM2-/- mouse fibroblasts were transfected with p53 and MDM2 together with His-tagged ubiquitin it was demonstrated that the Lys454A mutant retained the ability to ubiquitinate p53, as determined by the isolation of His-ubiquitin-conjugated p53 protein (Fig. 1B), whereas, as expected, the C2H2C4 mutants were no longer able to mediate p53 modification by ubiquitin. Although the introduction of the Cys mutations is sufficient to inactivate MDM2 as an E3-ligase, they do not affect the overall integrity of the C terminus as we have shown that the Cys464A and Cys478S MDM2 mutants retain the ability to bind ATP, while ATP-binding activity is lost in the Lys454A mutant (12.Wawrzynow B. Zylicz A. Wallace M. Hupp T. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32603-32612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, mutation of Cys residues in the RING appears to specifically inactivate RING function during ligation of ubiquitin to target substrates while leaving other RING domain functions intact.The various MDM2 RING finger domain mutants were tested in a p53-dependent transcription assay to determine if inactivation of either its E3-ligase or ATP-binding activities affected the ability of MDM2 to repress p53-dependent transcription. The ability of p53 to activate transcription was determined using the p53-responsive region of the p21-promoter to drive luciferase expression. When human p53 was transfected into H1299 cells (human p53 null non-small cell lung carcinoma cells) along with the p21-reporter a characteristic activation of the promoter was detected (Fig. 1C), coexpression of wild-type MDM2 in a titrative manner led to a progressive decrease in reporter activity indicative of transrepression, with an I0.5 in the region of 300 ng of MDM2 plasmid (150 ng of p53 plasmid (Fig. 1C)). All the RING mutants were expressed to a similar level and were able to inhibit p53-dependent transcription, however, both the Cys mutants displayed a gain of transrepressor function with an I0.5 of <75 ng for MDM2C464A and <150 ng for MDM2C478S. In contrast, mutation of Lys454 did not enhance the repressor activity of MDM2, and like the wild-type protein, this mutant had an I0.5 of around 300 ng. Similarly, although a titration of p53 could overcome transrepression imposed by a fixed amount of wild-type MDM2 and the Lys454A mutant, there was a significant reduction in the ability of p53 to overcome the effects of the Cys464A and Cys478S mutants (Fig. 1D). To determine whether comparison of an Ala-substituted Cys to a Ser-substituted Cys underlined the apparent difference in potency of the MDM2C464A and MDM2C478S mutants we used a second mutant from within the C4 coordination (Fig. 1E; C461S) where we mutated Cys461 to Ser. Analysis of this mutant demonstrated that it was also more potent than the MDM2C478S mutant. These results suggest that the difference in activity of the RING mutants is unlikely to be due primarily to the choice of the substitution residue.To determine if endogenous p53-responsive promoters respond to the MDM2 RING domain mutant proteins in a similar way to that observed using p53-responsive reporter constructs we used BAX protein expression as a measure of its promoter activity, because BAX is a well characterized target for p53 (31.Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). For this assay we used MCF7 cells because they have a wild-type p53 pathway. Fig. 1F shows that BAX protein levels are unaffected by the expression of wt MDM2 at the concentrations used in the experiment (Fig. 1F, lanes 2-4), however under the same conditions the MDM2C464A mutant suppressed BAX protein expression even at the lowest amount used (lanes 8-10), and consistent with the reporter assays, the MDM2C478S mutant had intermediate activity, because it suppressed BAX protein expression when present at the highest amount (lane 7).Together the data presented above suggest that mutation of residues within the RING finger domain that directly affect MDM2 E3-ligase activity facilitate transrepression of p53 transcriptional activity. In contrast, loss of MDM2 molecular chaperone activity in the ATP-binding mutant (Lys454A) had no effect on transrepression of p53. Further, the data demonstrate that MDM2 E3-ligase activity can be completely uncoupled from its ability to repress p53 transcription.The MDM2 Hydrophobic Pocket but Not the Acid Domain Is Required for Efficient Transrepression of p53—Previous studies have suggested that the hydrophobic pocket of MDM2 is critical for its transrepressor activity (15.Lin J. Chen J. Elenbaas B. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 28.Liu W.L. Midgley C. Stephen C. Saville M. Lane D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 711-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), however these studies were carried out before the complexity of the interaction between MDM2 and p53 was fully appreciated. Because the acid domain of MDM2 is now known to bind to the BOX-V domain of p53 (16.Wallace M. Worrall E. Pettersson S. Hupp T.R. Ball K.L. Mol.

U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1227-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) we sought to use MDM2 deletion mutants to determine which interactions were salient for MDM2-mediated transrepression. To investigate the influence of MDM2 domain structure on p53 transrepression we used mutant forms of murine MDM2 where one or other of the two known p53 interacting domains had been deleted (Fig. 2A, MDM2ΔN and MDM2ΔAc). MDM2ΔN prevents the interaction between the transactivation domain of p53 (BOX-I) and the hydrophobic pocket in the N terminus of MDM2 (14.Kussie P.H. Gorina S. Marechal V. Elenbaas B. Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar), whereas the MDM2ΔAc precludes binding of the core domain of p53 (BOX-V) and the acid domain of MDM2 that is essential for MDM2-mediated ubiquitination of p53 (16.Wallace M.

https://openalex.org/W2021292851,"Amyloid fibril formation of mutant transthyretin (TTR) that causes familial amyloid polyneuropathy occurs in the extracellular space. Thus, secretion of TTR variants contributes to the pathogenesis of amyloidosis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit or retention and subsequent degradation of TTR variants remain unclear. Here, we demonstrated that the nonsecreted TTR variants, such as D18G TTR and amyloidogenic TTRs with introduced monomeric mutation (M-TTRs), stably interact with the ER chaperone BiP in mammalian cells. These proteins were co-secreted with the secreted form of BiP in which the KDEL signal was removed, indicating that BiP partially contributes to the ER retention of nonsecreted TTR variants. More interestingly, the degradation efficiency of nonsecreted TTRs was increased when BiP was down-regulated by small interfering RNA. Thus, BiP protects the TTR variants from immediate degradation. Additionally, we showed that the stability of nonsecreted TTR variants is not disturbed in the coat complex II-deficient conditions, which are enough to inhibit the ER export of secreted TTR variants, including wild-type TTR. Therefore, the post-ER retrieval mechanism might not contribute to the ER-associated degradation of nonsecreted TTR variants. These findings suggest that the affinity to the ER-resident protein BiP regulates the fate of TTR variants in the ER."
https://openalex.org/W2140038957,"The innate immune response constitutes the first line of defense against invading pathogens and consists of a variety of immune defense mechanisms including active endocytosis by macrophages and granulocytes. Endocytosis can be used as a reliable measure of selective and non-selective mechanisms of antigen uptake in the early phase of an immune response. Numerous assays have been developed to measure this response in a variety of mammalian and fish species. The small size of the zebrafish has prevented the large-scale collection of monocytes/macrophages and granulocytes for these endocytic assays.Pooled zebrafish kidney hematopoietic tissues were used as a source of phagocytic cells for flow-cytometry based endocytic assays. FITC-Dextran, Lucifer Yellow and FITC-Edwardsiella ictaluri were used to evaluate selective and non-selective mechanisms of uptake in zebrafish phagocytes.Zebrafish kidney phagocytes characterized as monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes utilize macropinocytosis and Ca(2+)-dependant endocytosis mechanisms of antigen uptake. These cells do not appear to utilize a mannose receptor. Heat-killed Edwardsiella ictaluri induces cytoskeletal interactions for internalization in zebrafish kidney monocytes/macrophages and granulocytes. The proposed method is easy to implement and should prove especially useful in immunological, toxicological and epidemiological research."
https://openalex.org/W2039290279,"Herein two genetic codes from which the primeval RNA code could have originated the standard genetic code (SGC) are derived. One of them, called extended RNA code type I, consists of all codons of the type RNY (purine-any base-pyrimidine) plus codons obtained by considering the RNA code but in the second (NYR type) and third (YRN type) reading frames. The extended RNA code type II, comprises all codons of the type RNY plus codons that arise from transversions of the RNA code in the first (YNY type) and third (RNR) nucleotide bases. In order to test if putative nucleotide sequences in the RNA World and in both extended RNA codes, share the same scaling and statistical properties to those encountered in current prokaryotes, we used the genomes of four Eubacteria and three Archaeas. For each prokaryote, we obtained their respective genomes obeying the RNA code or the extended RNA codes types I and II. In each case, we estimated the scaling properties of triplet sequences via a renormalization group approach, and we calculated the frequency distributions of distances for each codon. Remarkably, the scaling properties of the distance series of some codons from the RNA code and most codons from both extended RNA codes turned out to be identical or very close to the scaling properties of codons of the SGC. To test for the robustness of these results, we show, via computer simulation experiments, that random mutations of current genomes, at the rates of 10−10 per site per year during three billions of years, were not enough for destroying the observed patterns. Therefore, we conclude that most current prokaryotes may still contain relics of the primeval RNA World and that both extended RNA codes may well represent two plausible evolutionary paths between the RNA code and the current SGC."

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7240-7249Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). ARSs are present in all three domains of life and are responsible for catalyzing the aminoacylation of tRNA, which is a critical step in the translation of the genetic code. The core chemistry involves the covalent attachment of an amino acid onto the 3′-adenosine moiety of the cognate tRNA. ARSs consist of multiple domains (3Ibba M. Söll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 617-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The central catalytic domain (CCD) is responsible for the activation of an amino acid in the presence of ATP to form an enzyme-bound aminoacyl-adenylate (AA-AMP; Equation 1) followed by transfer of that activated amino acid to the 3′-end of its cognate tRNA (Equation 2). ARS+AA+ATP⇌ARS·(AA-AMP)+PPi ARS·(AA-AMP)+tRNA→AA-tRNA+ARS+AMP The anticodon binding domain (Fig. 1) is often responsible for selecting the correct tRNA. To maintain high accuracy in the aminoacylation of tRNA, some ARSs have evolved amino acid editing mechanisms, which employed additional domains for proofreading (3Ibba M. Söll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 617-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar, 4Jakubowski H. Goldman E. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 412-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mascarenhas A. Martinis S.A. An S. Rosen A.E. Musier-Forsyth K. RajBhandary U.L. Koehrer C. Protein Engineering. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2009: 153-200Google Scholar).Aminoacylation of tRNA involves a series of events that includes selection of the correct amino acid and its activation in the presence of ATP, binding of the cognate tRNA, transfer of the activated amino acid onto the cognate tRNA, release of the aminoacylated tRNA from the enzyme active site, and in some cases, proofreading (4Jakubowski H. Goldman E. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 412-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Mascarenhas A. Martinis S.A. An S. Rosen A.E. Musier-Forsyth K. RajBhandary U.L. Koehrer C. Protein Engineering. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2009: 153-200Google Scholar). Moreover, proofreading may require translocation of the misactivated amino acid and/or the mischarged tRNA from the aminoacylation active site to the editing active site. Therefore, to maintain high precision in the aminoacylation of tRNAs, these events need to be synchronized, requiring a high degree of coordination between the various ARS domains. Indeed, a number of structural and mutational studies have provided strong evidence for domain-domain communication in ARSs (1Alexander R.W. Schimmel P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 69: 317-349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Zhang C.M. Hou Y.M. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 7240-7249Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 6Uter N.T. Perona J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 14396-14401Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although molecular mechanism of signal propagation from one domain to another domain has remained poorly understood, recent studies suggest that domain dynamics might play an important role in long range communication (7Budiman M.E. Knaggs M.H. Fetrow J.S. Alexander R.W. Proteins. 2007; 68: 670-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 8Estabrook R.A. Luo J. Purdy M.M. Sharma V. Weakliem P. Bruice T.C. Reich N.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Structural studies demonstrated large domain displacements in Thermus thermophilus LeuRS (Tt LeuRS) during various steps of catalysis (9Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Fukunaga R. Yokoyama S. Cusack S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 10Mascarenhas A.P. Martinis S.A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 4808-4816Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Tt LeuRS possesses a complex modular architecture (9Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Fukunaga R. Yokoyama S. Cusack S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 11Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). It has three distinct flexible domains: the editing domain (ED; residues 224-417), zinc-1 binding domain (ZBD; residues 154-189), and leucine-specific domain (LSD; residues 577-634). These three domains are linked with the CCD by β-ribbon structures (Fig. 1) (11Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the Tt LeuRS-tRNALeu complex (in post-transfer editing conformation) demonstrated that the ED undergoes a 35° rotation compared with the tRNA unbound form (Fig. 1). The LSD, which is critical for aminoacylation, undergoes a rigid-body rotation of 19° (9Tukalo M. Yaremchuk A. Fukunaga R. Yokoyama S. Cusack S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 12Vu M.T. Martinis S.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5170-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These conformational changes of various structural elements suggest that large scale flexibility and domain motions play a critical role in the aminoacylation and editing reactions catalyzed by LeuRS. However, these structural studies failed to provide insight into the nature of these motions (correlated or anticorrelated) among various domains and functional sites. Moreover, from the existing structural and biochemical studies, little insight was obtained about the effect of mutation/deletion of distant structural elements on the function of LeuRS. Several questions remained unanswered regarding the interplay between domain dynamics and enzyme function.In a multidomain enzyme like an ARS, one possible way to accomplish these long range communications is through coupled domain dynamics. These coordinated domain movements are essential for the protein functions and are cooperative in nature. These cooperative motions mediating long range communications are believed to play a major role in enzyme functions including chemical catalysis (13Harte Jr., W.E. Swaminathan S. Mansuri M.M.

In fact, exploring the coupling between mechanical and chemical events in multidomain proteins, especially at the molecular level, has remained one of the challenging areas of contemporary biochemical research (7Budiman M.E. Knaggs M.H. Fetrow J.S. Alexander R.W. Proteins. 2007; 68: 670-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18Yu H. Ma L. Yang Y. Cui Q. PLOS Comput. Biol. 2007; 3: 214-230Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar).In this work we have investigated the motions of various domains of Tt LeuRS and examined the role of conserved and co-evolved residues on protein dynamics using bioinformatics and computational means. The collective motions were studied by computing their normal modes. The evolutionary basis for retaining specific residue pairs was examined by using statistical coupling analysis. By combining the results of these studies, we were able to extract clusters of residues that are coupled not only by thermal motions but also through evolution. We suggest that these clusters of residues, which are at the core of cooperative domain dynamics, are involved in mediating domain-domain communication in Tt LeuRS.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneral Strategy-To study the collective nature of these domain motions, we first performed normal mode analysis (NMA) (15Bu Z. Biehl R. Monkenbusch M. Richter D. Callaway D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 17646-17651Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 18Yu H. Ma L. Yang Y. Cui Q. PLOS Comput.

Biol. 2006; 356: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and identified the low frequency normal mode that adequately describes the domain displacements as observed in the tRNA-bound and unbound conformations of Tt LeuRS. After identifying the correct mode, we explored the collective dynamics among various domains and characterized them by analyzing their correlated and anticorrelated patterns. In parallel, a statistical coupling analysis (SCA) (29Lockless S.W. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar, 30Suel G.M. Lockless S.W. Wall M.A. Ranganathan R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) was performed to identify residues/clusters whose mutations are evolutionarily correlated. This analysis provided the coupling of two sites that may even be separated by large distances in a protein (30Suel G.M. Lockless S.W. Wall M.A. Ranganathan R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Finally, to understand how cooperative dynamics between two distant domains are accomplished, residues identified by combining these two studies were mapped onto protein surfaces and analyzed through visualizations using Visual Molecular Dynamics software (31Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (36896) Google Scholar). The NMA and SCA plots were generated by using MATLAB R2006b (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA).Starting Structure-Two crystal structures of Tt LeuRS were used in this study. The crystal structure of Tt LeuRS complexed with a leucyl-adenylate analogue (PDB code 1H3N; residues 1-814) represents the tRNA unbound enzyme conformation. In contrast, the post-transfer editing conformation of the enzyme was taken from the tRNALeu bound structure (PDB code 2BYT; residues 1-876). The various conformational changes of LeuRS structural elements are shown in Fig. 1.Normal Mode Calculations-Functionally important protein motions are often characterized by slow (low frequency) and large amplitude motions (19Brooks B. Karplus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6571-6575Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 25Ma J.

Biol. 1999; 9: 164-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). These motions in biomolecules can be studied by normal mode analysis, which is a fast and powerful method especially useful for studying the dynamics of large proteins like ARSs. The key premise of NMA is that the slower lowest frequency (large amplitude) normal modes describe the largest movements in a protein that are functionally relevant (35Brooks B. Karplus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4995-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). NMA has been successful in describing the domain motions and their collective nature in diverse set of proteins including hexokinase (33Harrison R.W. Biopolymers. 1984; 23: 2943-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), lysozyme (35Brooks B. Karplus M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4995-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), citrate synthetase (20Marques O. Sanejouand Y.H. Proteins. 1995; 23: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), adenylate kinase (22Tama F. Sanejouand Y.H. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), RNA polymerase (23Yildirim Y. Doruker P. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 2004; 22: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), icosahedral virus capsid (26Tama F. Brooks III, C.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 299-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and the Escherichia. coli 70 S ribosome (36Frank J. Agrawal R.K. Nature. 2000; 406: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Therefore, in an enzyme like ARS, where cooperative domain dynamics play a key role in maintaining high accuracy in the aminoacylation of the cognate tRNA, NMA is expected to provide significant information about these domain dynamics.Elastic Network Model-The normal mode calculation is based on the harmonic approximation of the potential energy function around a minimum energy conformation. The small displacements ri(t) of atomic coordinate i, close to a stationary point of the potential energy surface, is given byri(t)=1mi∑j3NCjaijcos(Ωjt+Φj)where mi is the mass of the corresponding atom, and aij is the ith coordinate of the normal mode j. The corresponding frequency vj equals to ωj/2π, where ω 2j is obtained as the jth eigenvalue of the 3N × 3N mass-weighted second derivatives of the potential energy matrix. Cj and φj are the amplitude and the phase of mode j. In this work NMA was carried out using the coarse-grained elastic network model (21Bahar I. Atilgan A.R. Erman B. Fold. Des. 1997; 2: 173-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar, 24Bahar I. Rader A.J. Curr. Opin. Struct.

In particular, we used the anisotropic network model (ANM), where the protein is simplified to a string of beads (37Atilgan A.R. Durell S.R. Jernigan R.L. Demirel M.C. Keskin O. Bahar I. Biophys.

In ANM, the fluctuations are anisotropic, and the overall potential of the system is expressed as the sum of harmonic potentials between the interacting Cα atoms.VANM=Γ2[∑qA=pΓpq[(rpq-rpqo)2]]In Equation 4, γ represents the uniform spring constant, rpqo and rpq are the original and instantaneous distance vectors between residues p and q, and Γpq is the pqth element of the binary connection matrix of inter-residue contacts. Based on an interaction cut-off distance of rc, Γpq is equal to 1 if rpqo and zero otherwise (21Bahar I. Atilgan A.R. Erman B. Fold. Des. 1997; 2: 173-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). The online Anisotropic Network Model web server was used to obtain the simulated functional motion from the Tt LeuRS structure (24Bahar I. Rader A.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 586-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 27Eyal E. Yang L.W. Bahar I. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 2619-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The optimal cut-off distance (rc) between Cα atoms was kept at 15 Å in this study (24Bahar I. Rader A.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 586-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). The correlated or anticorrelated motions between residue pairs of distant structural elements were analyzed from the cross-correlations of residue pairs (see below).Comparison with Experimentally Observed Conformational Transition-Results of the NMA are compared with the experimentally observed conformational changes. The direction of motions and their magnitude as well as the collectivity were compared in identifying the mode most involved.Overlap-The overlap, Oj, between the conformational change Δri observed by crystallographers and the jth normal mode was calculated according to Marques and Sanejouand (20Marques O. Sanejouand Y.H. Proteins. 1995; 23: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar),Oj=|∑i3NaijΔrj|[∑i3Naij2∑i3NΔri2]1/2where ΔrI = rib - riu, rib and riu are the ith atomic coordinates for the substrate bound and the unbound structures of the protein, respectively. aij is the same as defined in Equation 3. A value of 1.0 for the overlap means that the direction given by normal mode j is identical with Δri.Correlation Coefficient-To measure the similarity in the relative magnitude of the atomic displacements observed experimentally and in mode j, the correlation coefficient (Cj) was calculated byCj=N∑ΔriΔrij-∑Δri∑ΔrijN∑Δri2-(∑Δri)2N∑Δrij2-(∑Δrij)2where Δri is the observed displacement of the ith atom in the crystal structure (as discussed Equation 5), Δrij is the observed displacement of the same atom i but in the normal mode j, and N represents the number of residues in the protein. A correlation coefficient of 1.0 means that that the relative magnitudes of atomic displacements are identical.Collectivity of a Conformational Change-The collectivity of the movement of a protein in a given mode describes the extent by which various structural elements undergo a conformational change together. The higher degree of collectivity implies that a larger fraction of residues is affected by a given mode. In the case of least collective (localized) motion, normal mode movements involve only a few atoms.To quantitatively measure the extent of collectivity of the protein motion, a collectivity index, as proposed by Bruschweiler (38Bruschweiler R. J. Chem. Phys. 1995; 102: 3396-3403Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar), was calculated for all three modes. Accordingly, the collectivity (κ) is computed byΚ=1Nexp(-∑iNαΔri2lnαΔri2)where α is a chosen normalization factor, and Δri is defined previously, so that∑iNαΔri2=1The value of κ is confined between N-1 and 1; κ = 1 indicates the conformational change is maximally collective.Correlated and Anticorrelated Motions-The nature of the inter-residue motions, correlated or anticorrelated, in the protein were identified by computing the cross-correlations between residue fluctuations from the simulated motion trajectory. The cross-correlation coefficient between fluctuations of residues p and q (Cpq) was calculated byCpq=〈ΔrpĊΔrq〉〈Δrp2〉Ċ〈Δrq2〉where the atomic (Cα) displacements of residues p and q are represented by rp and rq, respectively, and the angular brackets represent an ensemble average calculated using the structures for a particular normal mode. The cross-correlation coefficients were obtained as a matrix and are represented as a two-dimensional cross-correlation map. A negative correlation value indicates anticorrelated motion, whereas a positive value identifies correlated pattern of dynamics between two compared residues.Statistical Coupling Analysis-SCA is based upon the assumption that “coupling of two sites in a protein, whether for structural or functional reasons, should cause those two sites to coevolve” (8Estabrook R.A.

Biol. 2003; 10: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). This method takes a MSA of a protein and calculates the change in the amino acid distribution at one position with respect to a perturbation at another position.Energetic Coupling of Amino Acid Positions in LeuRS-LeuRS sequences from multiple species were collected from PSI-BLAST (39Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59167) Google Scholar), and a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was constructed using ClustalW (40Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55203) Google Scholar). To measure the extent of coupling between two sites i and j of a protein sequence, calculation of statistical coupling energy ΔΔGi,jstat was carried out as described in the literature (29Lockless S.W. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). In this method a large scale perturbation experiment on the MSA of the LeuRS family was performed by introducing a change in the amino acid distribution at one position and examining the effect at another site (29Lockless S.W. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar, 30Suel G.M. Lockless S.W. Wall M.A. Ranganathan R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Briefly, the method consists of two steps. First, the parameter that represents the overall evolutionary conservation at a position i in the sequence of the chosen protein family (expressed as a statistical energy ΔGistat) is calculated using the principles of Boltzmann statistics as follows:ΔGistat=ki&macr;*∑x[ln(Pix/PMSAx)]2where kT* is an arbitrary energy unit, Pix is the probability of observing amino acid x at site i, and PxMSA is the probability of observing amino acid x in the overall MSA (29Lockless S.W. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar).In the second step a perturbation experiment was carried out on the MSA following the method described in Suel et al. (30Suel G.M. Lockless S.W. Wall M.A. Ranganathan R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Briefly, a perturbation at a specific position of a MSA refers to the creation of a subalignment, which is sufficiently large and diverse similar to the parent MSA. However, the probability of occurrence of a residue at a given position has changed considerably. For two coevolving positions on the sequence, the perturbation process, therefore, introduces a change in the amino acid distribution at one position and measures the change of the same at the other.The statistical coupling energy between sites i and j is calculated and expressed asΔΔGi,jstat=kT*∑x[ln(Pi|&jxPMSA|&jx)-ln(PixPMSAx)]where Pi|δjx is the probability of a particular amino acid x at site i dependent on a perturbation at site j. The sum over x indicates the combined effect of the perturbation on all amino acids at site i due to a perturbation at site j. Therefore, a large ΔGistat value represents a highly conserved residue at ith site in the MSA (29Lockless S.W. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar), whereas a large statistical coupling value, ΔΔGi,jstat, indicates strong energetic coupling between the residues at the two sites, i and j (29Lockless S.W. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar, 30Suel G.M. Lockless S.W. Wall M.A. Ranganathan R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar).Hierarchical clustering was carried out using the statistical toolbox utility of MATLAB. Using the clustering algorithm, the raw unclustered data were grouped into several clusters of residues that are strongly coupled. In the subsequent steps, these data are analyzed, truncated, and re-clustered into smaller datasets bearing strong coupling value ( ΔΔGi,jstat).Mapping and Visualization of the Evolutionarily and Thermally Coupled Residues on Three-dimensional Structures of the Enzyme-The thermal as well as statistical coupling of residues across the Tt LeuRS domains was further explored by visualization. The coevolved residue pairs were first mapped onto the three-dimensional structure of LeuRS and analyzed with the aid of the molecular surface generation tool of the Visual Molecular Dynamics program (31Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (36896) Google Scholar). Based on van der Waals contacts, these residues were grouped into five clusters, each of which represents a network of contiguous residues. Contribution of these coevolving residue clusters to the cooperative domain dynamics was further investigated by quantifying the amount of dynamic coupling between them from the NMA cross-correlation matrix.RESULTSAnalysis of the Domain Dynamics of Tt LeuRS-In the first step of this study, NMA was performed to characterize domain motions of Tt LeuRS. The computed low frequency normal modes were then evaluated by comparing them against structural transitions, observed in the x-ray crystal structures. These comparative studies were based on the direction, magnitude, and the collectivity of conformational changes.Conformational Flexibility-To explore protein flexibility, we used the tRNA unbound structure of Tt LeuRS (“open” form; PDB code 1H3N) (11Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The NMA for open-form structure 1H3N yielded a number of low frequency normal modes. Among t"
https://openalex.org/W2016400499,"The rat adrenal pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line is one of the traditional models for the study of neurite outgrowth and growth cone behavior. To clarify to what extent PC12 neurite terminals can be compared to neuronal growth cones, we have analyzed their morphology and protein distribution in fixed PC12 cells by immunocytochemistry. Our results show that that PC12 cells display a special kind of neurite terminal that includes a varicosity in close association with a growth cone. This hybrid terminal, or ""varicone"", is characterized by the expression of specific markers not typically present in neuronal growth cones. For example, we show that calpain-2 is a specific marker of varicones and can be detected even before the neurite develops. Our data also shows that a fraction of PC12 neurites end in regular growth cones, which we have compared to hippocampal neurites as a control. We also report the extraordinary incidence of varicones in the literature referred to as ""growth cones"". In summary, we provide evidence of two different kinds of neurite terminals in PC12 cells, including a PC12-specific terminal, which implies that care must be taken when using them as a model for neuronal growth cones or neurite outgrowth."
https://openalex.org/W2089399273,"Background We have shown earlier that inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) administered by oxygen hood reduces pulmonary hypertension in an animal model (J Perinatol 2002; 22:50-6). Our objective in this study was to determine feasibility of iNO by oxygen hood in neonates with elevated alveolar-arterial oxygen gradients (A-aDO2). Methods/Principal Findings Masked randomized controlled pilot trial. Inclusion criteria were: gestation≥34 weeks, age<7 days, with post-ductal arterial line, and A-aDO2 400–600. Infants were randomized to study gas (iNO 20 ppm or equivalent O2 flow) for 1 hr which was then weaned over the next 4 hours. Primary outcome was PaO2 one hour post-randomization. Four infants each were randomized to iNO or O2 (controls). Two of the four infants given iNO had an increase in PaO2 of >100 torr, while oxygenation was unchanged in the controls. Methemoglobinemia and other adverse effects were not noted in any infant. Environmental levels of NO and NO2 were minimal (<1 ppm) at >0.3 m from the hood. Conclusions Administration of iNO by oxygen hood is feasible. Larger randomized controlled trials are required to measure the efficacy and determine an appropriate target population for this technique. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00041548"
