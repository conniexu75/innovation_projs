https://openalex.org/W2025109766,"Background Osteosarcoma is the most common primary tumour of bone. Solid tumours are made of heterogeneous cell populations, which display different goals and roles in tumour economy. A rather small cell subset can hold or acquire stem potentials, gaining aggressiveness and increasing expectancy of recurrence. The CD133 antigen is a pentaspan membrane glycoprotein, which has been proposed as a cancer stem cell marker, since it has been previously demonstrated to be capable of identifying a cancer initiating subpopulation in brain, colon, melanoma and other solid tumours. Therefore, our aim was to observe the possible presence of cells expressing the CD133 antigen within solid tumour cell lines of osteosarcoma and, then, understand their biological characteristics and performances. Methodology and Principal Findings In this study, using SAOS2, MG63 and U2OS, three human sarcoma cell lines isolated from young Caucasian subjects, we were able to identify and characterize, among them, CD133+ cells showing the following features: high proliferation rate, cell cycle detection in a G2\M phase, positivity for Ki-67, and expression of ABCG2 transporters. In addition, at the FACS, we were able to observe the CD133+ cell fraction showing side population profile and forming sphere-clusters in serum-free medium with a high clonogenic efficiency. Conclusions Taken together, our findings lead to the thought that we can assume that we have identified, for the first time, CD133+ cells within osteosarcoma cell lines, showing many features of cancer stem cells. This can be of rather interest in order to design new therapies against the bone cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2171942713,"Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can serve as a potentially limitless source of cells that may enable regeneration of diseased tissue and organs. Here we investigate the use of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) in promoting recovery from cardiac ischemia reperfusion injury in a mouse model. Using microarrays, we have described the hESC-CM transcriptome within the spectrum of changes that occur between undifferentiated hESCs and fetal heart cells. The hESC-CMs expressed cardiomyocyte genes at levels similar to those found in 20-week fetal heart cells, making this population a good source of potential replacement cells in vivo. Echocardiographic studies showed significant improvement in heart function by 8 weeks after transplantation. Finally, we demonstrate long-term engraftment of hESC-CMs by using molecular imaging to track cellular localization, survival, and proliferation in vivo. Taken together, global gene expression profiling of hESC differentiation enables a systems-based analysis of the biological processes, networks, and genes that drive hESC fate decisions, and studies such as this will serve as the foundation for future clinical applications of stem cell therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2145444336,"Recent studies have associated the transcription factors, Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog as parts of a self-regulating network which is responsible for maintaining embryonic stem cell properties: self renewal and pluripotency. In addition, mutual antagonism between two of these and other master regulators have been shown to regulate lineage determination. In particular, an excess of Cdx2 over Oct4 determines the trophectoderm lineage whereas an excess of Gata-6 over Nanog determines differentiation into the endoderm lineage. Also, under/over-expression studies of the master regulator Oct4 have revealed that some self-renewal/pluripotency as well as differentiation genes are expressed in a biphasic manner with respect to the concentration of Oct4.We construct a dynamical model of a minimalistic network, extracted from ChIP-on-chip and microarray data as well as literature studies. The model is based upon differential equations and makes two plausible assumptions; activation of Gata-6 by Oct4 and repression of Nanog by an Oct4-Gata-6 heterodimer. With these assumptions, the results of simulations successfully describe the biphasic behavior as well as lineage commitment. The model also predicts that reprogramming the network from a differentiated state, in particular the endoderm state, into a stem cell state, is best achieved by over-expressing Nanog, rather than by suppression of differentiation genes such as Gata-6.The computational model provides a mechanistic understanding of how different lineages arise from the dynamics of the underlying regulatory network. It provides a framework to explore strategies of reprogramming a cell from a differentiated state to a stem cell state through directed perturbations. Such an approach is highly relevant to regenerative medicine since it allows for a rapid search over the host of possibilities for reprogramming to a stem cell state."
https://openalex.org/W2022317162,"Organization in hierarchical dominance structures is prevalent in animal societies, so a strong preference for higher positions in social ranking is likely to be an important motivation of human social and economic behavior. This preference is also likely to influence the way in which we evaluate our outcome and the outcome of others, and finally the way we choose. In our experiment participants choose among lotteries with different levels of risk, and can observe the choice that others have made. Results show that the relative weight of gains and losses is the opposite in the private and social domain. For private outcomes, experience and anticipation of losses loom larger than gains, whereas in the social domain, gains loom larger than losses, as indexed by subjective emotional evaluations and physiological responses. We propose a theoretical model (interdependent utilities), predicting the implication of this effect for choice behavior. The relatively larger weight assigned to social gains strongly affects choices, inducing complementary behavior: faced with a weaker competitor, participants adopt a more risky and dominant behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1975798253,"A dysfunction of retinoid hippocampal signaling pathway has been involved in the appearance of affective and cognitive disorders. However, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain unknown. Hippocampal granule neurons are generated throughout life and are involved in emotion and memory. Here, we investigated the effects of vitamin A deficiency (VAD) on neurogenesis and memory and the ability of retinoic acid (RA) treatment to prevent VAD-induced impairments. Adult retinoid-deficient rats were generated by a vitamin A-free diet from weaning in order to allow a normal development. The effects of VAD and/or RA administration were examined on hippocampal neurogenesis, retinoid target genes such as neurotrophin receptors and spatial reference memory measured in the water maze. Long-term VAD decreased neurogenesis and led to memory deficits. More importantly, these effects were reversed by 4 weeks of RA treatment. These beneficial effects may be in part related to an up-regulation of retinoid-mediated molecular events, such as the expression of the neurotrophin receptor TrkA. We have demonstrated for the first time that the effect of vitamin A deficient diet on the level of hippoccampal neurogenesis is reversible and that RA treatment is important for the maintenance of the hippocampal plasticity and function."
https://openalex.org/W2025923013,"Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses have caused dramatic economic losses to the poultry industry of Vietnam and continue to pose a serious threat to public health. As of June 2008, Vietnam had reported nearly one third of worldwide laboratory confirmed human H5N1 infections. To better understand the emergence, spread and evolution of H5N1 in Vietnam we studied over 300 H5N1 avian influenza viruses isolated from Vietnam since their first detection in 2001. Our phylogenetic analyses indicated that six genetically distinct H5N1 viruses were introduced into Vietnam during the past seven years. The H5N1 lineage that evolved following the introduction in 2003 of the A/duck/Hong Kong/821/2002-like viruses, with clade 1 hemagglutinin (HA), continued to predominate in southern Vietnam as of May 2007. A virus with a clade 2.3.4 HA newly introduced into northern Vietnam in 2007, reassorted with pre-existing clade 1 viruses, resulting in the emergence of novel genotypes with neuraminidase (NA) and/or internal gene segments from clade 1 viruses. A total of nine distinct genotypes have been present in Vietnam since 2001, including five that were circulating in 2007. At least four of these genotypes appear to have originated in Vietnam and represent novel H5N1 viruses not reported elsewhere. Geographic and temporal analyses of H5N1 infection dynamics in poultry suggest that the majority of viruses containing new genes were first detected in northern Vietnam and subsequently spread to southern Vietnam after reassorting with pre-existing local viruses in northern Vietnam. Although the routes of entry and spread of H5N1 in Vietnam remain speculative, enhanced poultry import controls and virologic surveillance efforts may help curb the entry and spread of new HPAI viral genes."
https://openalex.org/W2105655586,"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system with an important genetic component and strongest association driven by the HLA genes. We performed a pooling-based genome-wide association study of 500,000 SNPs in order to find new loci associated with the disease. After applying several criteria, 320 SNPs were selected from the microarrays and individually genotyped in a first and independent Spanish Caucasian replication cohort. The 8 most significant SNPs validated in this cohort were also genotyped in a second US Caucasian replication cohort for confirmation. The most significant association was obtained for SNP rs3129934, which neighbors the HLA-DRB/DQA loci and validates our pooling-based strategy. The second strongest association signal was found for SNP rs1327328, which resides in an unannotated region of chromosome 13 but is in linkage disequilibrium with nearby functional elements that may play important roles in disease susceptibility. This region of chromosome 13 has not been previously identified in MS linkage genome screens and represents a novel risk locus for the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2052867018,"Background Vocal learning is a rare and complex behavioral trait that serves as a basis for the acquisition of human spoken language. In songbirds, vocal learning and production depend on a set of specialized brain nuclei known as the song system. Methodology/Principal Findings Using high-throughput functional genomics we have identified ∼200 novel molecular markers of adult zebra finch HVC, a key node of the song system. These markers clearly differentiate HVC from the general pallial region to which HVC belongs, and thus represent molecular specializations of this song nucleus. Bioinformatics analysis reveals that several major neuronal cell functions and specific biochemical pathways are the targets of transcriptional regulation in HVC, including: 1) cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions (e.g., cadherin/catenin-mediated adherens junctions, collagen-mediated focal adhesions, and semaphorin-neuropilin/plexin axon guidance pathways); 2) cell excitability (e.g., potassium channel subfamilies, cholinergic and serotonergic receptors, neuropeptides and neuropeptide receptors); 3) signal transduction (e.g., calcium regulatory proteins, regulators of G-protein-related signaling); 4) cell proliferation/death, migration and differentiation (e.g., TGF-beta/BMP and p53 pathways); and 5) regulation of gene expression (candidate retinoid and steroid targets, modulators of chromatin/nucleolar organization). The overall direction of regulation suggest that processes related to cell stability are enhanced, whereas proliferation, growth and plasticity are largely suppressed in adult HVC, consistent with the observation that song in this songbird species is mostly stable in adulthood. Conclusions/Significance Our study represents one of the most comprehensive molecular genetic characterizations of a brain nucleus involved in a complex learned behavior in a vertebrate. The data indicate numerous targets for pharmacological and genetic manipulations of the song system, and provide novel insights into mechanisms that might play a role in the regulation of song behavior and/or vocal learning."
https://openalex.org/W2032292656,"Though fatigue and sleepiness at the wheel are well-known risk factors for traffic accidents, many drivers combine extended driving and sleep deprivation. Fatigue-related accidents occur mainly at night but there is no experimental data available to determine if the duration of prior driving affects driving performance at night. Participants drove in 3 nocturnal driving sessions (3–5am, 1–5am and 9pm–5am) on open highway. Fourteen young healthy men (mean age [±SD] = 23.4 [±1.7] years) participated Inappropriate line crossings (ILC) in the last hour of driving of each session, sleep variables, self-perceived fatigue and sleepiness were measured. Compared to the short (3–5am) driving session, the incidence rate ratio of inappropriate line crossings increased by 2.6 (95% CI, 1.1 to 6.0; P<.05) for the intermediate (1–5am) driving session and by 4.0 (CI, 1.7 to 9.4; P<.001) for the long (9pm–5am) driving session. Compared to the reference session (9–10pm), the incidence rate ratio of inappropriate line crossings were 6.0 (95% CI, 2.3 to 15.5; P<.001), 15.4 (CI, 4.6 to 51.5; P<.001) and 24.3 (CI, 7.4 to 79.5; P<.001), respectively, for the three different durations of driving. Self-rated fatigue and sleepiness scores were both positively correlated to driving impairment in the intermediate and long duration sessions (P<.05) and increased significantly during the nocturnal driving sessions compared to the reference session (P<.01). At night, extended driving impairs driving performances and therefore should be limited."
https://openalex.org/W2088448340,"Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is one of the most contagious viruses of animals and is recognised as the most important constraint to international trade in animals and animal products. Two fundamental problems remain to be understood before more effective control measures can be put in place. These problems are the FMDV ""carrier state"" and the short duration of immunity after vaccination which contrasts with prolonged immunity after natural infection. Here we show by laser capture microdissection in combination with quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemical analysis and corroborate by in situ hybridization that FMDV locates rapidly to, and is maintained in, the light zone of germinal centres following primary infection of naïve cattle. We propose that maintenance of non-replicating FMDV in these sites represents a source of persisting infectious virus and also contributes to the generation of long-lasting antibody responses against neutralising epitopes of the virus."
https://openalex.org/W1963872926,"RNA modalities are developing as a powerful means to re-direct pathogenic pre-mRNA splicing events. Improving the efficiency of these molecules in vivo is critical as they move towards clinical applications. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by loss of SMN1. A nearly identical copy gene called SMN2 produces low levels of functional protein due to alternative splicing. We previously reported a trans-splicing RNA (tsRNA) that re-directed SMN2 splicing. Now we show that reducing the competition between endogenous splices sites enhanced the efficiency of trans-splicing. A single vector system was developed that expressed the SMN tsRNA and a splice-site blocking antisense (ASO-tsRNA). The ASO-tsRNA vector significantly elevated SMN levels in primary SMA patient fibroblasts, within the central nervous system of SMA mice and increased SMN-dependent in vitro snRNP assembly. These results demonstrate that the ASO-tsRNA strategy provides insight into the trans-splicing mechanism and a means of significantly enhancing trans-splicing activity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2067043854,"Actin polymerization plays a critical role in activated T lymphocytes both in regulating T cell receptor (TCR)-induced immunological synapse (IS) formation and signaling. Using gene targeting, we demonstrate that the hematopoietic specific, actin- and Arp2/3 complex-binding protein coronin-1A contributes to both processes. Coronin-1A-deficient mice specifically showed alterations in terminal development and the survival of alpha beta T cells, together with defects in cell activation and cytokine production following TCR triggering. The mutant T cells further displayed excessive accumulation yet reduced dynamics of F-actin and the WASP-Arp2/3 machinery at the IS, correlating with extended cell-cell contact. Cell signaling was also affected with the basal activation of the stress kinases sAPK/JNK1/2; and deficits in TCR-induced Ca2+ influx and phosphorylation and degradation of the inhibitor of NF-kappaB (I kappa B). Coronin-1A therefore links cytoskeleton plasticity with the functioning of discrete TCR signaling components. This function may be required to adjust TCR responses to selecting ligands accounting in part for the homeostasis defect that impacts alpha beta T cells in coronin-1A deficient mice, with the exclusion of other lympho/hematopoietic lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2018252774,"The detrimental effects of chemical insecticides on the environment and human health have lead to the call for biological alternatives. Today, one of the most promising solutions is the use of spray formulations based on Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis (Bti) in insect control programs. As a result, the amounts of Bti spread in the environment are expected to increase worldwide, whilst the common belief that commercial Bti is easily cleared from the ecosystem has not yet been clearly established.In this study, we aimed to determine the nature and origin of the high toxicity toward mosquito larvae found in decaying leaf litter collected in several natural mosquito breeding sites in the Rhône-Alpes region. From the toxic fraction of the leaf litter, we isolated B. cereus-like bacteria that were further characterized as B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis using PCR amplification of specific toxin genes. Immunological analysis of these Bti strains showed that they belong to the H14 group. We finally used amplified length polymorphism (AFLP) markers to show that the strains isolated from the leaf litter were closely related to those present in the commercial insecticide used for field application, and differed from natural worldwide genotypes.Our results raise the issue of the persistence, potential proliferation and environmental accumulation of human-spread Bti in natural mosquito habitats. Such Bti environmental persistence may lengthen the exposure time of insects to this bio-insecticide, thereby increasing the risk of resistance acquisition in target insects, and of a negative impact on non-target insects."
https://openalex.org/W1966840911,"Group A streptococcus (GAS) causes variety of diseases ranging from common pharyngitis to life-threatening severe invasive diseases, including necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome. The characteristic of invasive GAS infections has been thought to attribute to genetic changes in bacteria, however, no clear evidence has shown due to lack of an intriguingly study using serotype-matched isolates from clinical severe invasive GAS infections. In addition, rare outbreaks of invasive infections and their distinctive pathology in which infectious foci without neutrophil infiltration hypothesized us invasive GAS could evade host defense, especially neutrophil functions. Herein we report that a panel of serotype-matched GAS, which were clinically isolated from severe invasive but not from non-invaive infections, could abrogate functions of human polymorphnuclear neutrophils (PMN) in at least two independent ways; due to inducing necrosis to PMN by enhanced production of a pore-forming toxin streptolysin O (SLO) and due to impairment of PMN migration via digesting interleukin-8, a PMN attracting chemokine, by increased production of a serine protease ScpC. Expression of genes was upregulated by a loss of repressive function with the mutation of csrS gene in the all emm49 severe invasive GAS isolates. The csrS mutants from clinical severe invasive GAS isolates exhibited high mortality and disseminated infection with paucity of neutrophils, a characteristic pathology seen in human invasive GAS infection, in a mouse model. However, GAS which lack either SLO or ScpC exhibit much less mortality than the csrS-mutated parent invasive GAS isolate to the infected mice. These results suggest that the abilities of GAS to abrogate PMN functions can determine the onset and severity of invasive GAS infection."
https://openalex.org/W1986981822,"The marine cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus have been considered photoautotrophic microorganisms, although the utilization of exogenous sugars has never been specifically addressed in them. We studied glucose uptake in different high irradiance- and low irradiance-adapted Prochlorococcus strains, as well as the effect of glucose addition on the expression of several glucose-related genes. Glucose uptake was measured by adding radiolabelled glucose to Prochlorococcus cultures, followed by flow cytometry coupled with cell sorting in order to separate Prochlorococcus cells from bacterial contaminants. Sorted cells were recovered by filtration and their radioactivity measured. The expression, after glucose addition, of several genes (involved in glucose metabolism, and in nitrogen assimilation and its regulation) was determined in the low irradiance-adapted Prochlorococcus SS120 strain by semi-quantitative real time RT-PCR, using the rnpB gene as internal control. Our results demonstrate for the first time that the Prochlorococcus strains studied in this work take up glucose at significant rates even at concentrations close to those found in the oceans, and also exclude the possibility of this uptake being carried out by eventual bacterial contaminants, since only Prochlorococcus cells were used for radioactivity measurements. Besides, we show that the expression of a number of genes involved in glucose utilization (namely zwf, gnd and dld, encoding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase, respectively) is strongly increased upon glucose addition to cultures of the SS120 strain. This fact, taken together with the magnitude of the glucose uptake, clearly indicates the physiological importance of the phenomenon. Given the significant contribution of Prochlorococcus to the global primary production, these findings have strong implications for the understanding of the phytoplankton role in the carbon cycle in nature. Besides, the ability of assimilating carbon molecules could provide additional hints to comprehend the ecological success of Prochlorococcus."
https://openalex.org/W2030472585,"Chronic use of cocaine is associated with a reduced density of dopaminergic D2 receptors in the striatum, with negative consequences for cognitive control processes. Increasing evidence suggests that cognitive control is also affected in recreational cocaine consumers. This study aimed at linking these observations to dopaminergic malfunction by studying the spontaneous eyeblink rate (EBR), a marker of striatal dopaminergic functioning, in adult recreational users and a cocaine-free sample that was matched on age, race, gender, and personality traits. Correlation analyses show that EBR is significantly reduced in recreational users compared to cocaine-free controls, suggesting that cocaine use induces hypoactivity in the subcortical dopamine system."
https://openalex.org/W2080474418,"Background We evaluated the effectiveness of the Ortho All-Flex Diaphragm, lubricant gel (Replens®) and condoms compared to condoms alone on the incidence of chlamydial and gonococcal infections in an open-label randomized controlled trial among women at risk of HIV/STI infections. Methods We randomized 5045 sexually-active women at three sites in Southern Africa. Participants who tested positive for curable STIs were treated prior to enrollment as per local guidelines. Women were followed quarterly and tested for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) or Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) infection by nucleic-acid amplification testing (Roche Amplicor®) using first-catch urine specimens. STIs detected at follow-up visits were treated. We compared the incidence of first infection after randomization between study arms in both intent-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol populations. Findings Baseline demographic, behavioral and clinical characteristics were balanced across study arms. Nearly 80% of participants were under 35 years of age. Median follow-up time was 21 months and the retention rate was over 93%. There were 471 first chlamydia infections, 247 in the intervention arm and 224 in the control arm with an overall incidence of 6.2/100 woman-years (wy) (relative hazard (RH) 1.11, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.93–1.33; p = 0.25) and 192 first gonococcal infections, 95 in the intervention arm and 97 in the control arm with an overall incidence of 2.4/100wy (RH 0.98, 95%CI: 0.74–1.30; p = 0.90). Per protocol results indicated that when diaphragm adherence was defined as “always use” since the last visit, there was a significant reduction in the incidence of GC infection among women randomized to the intervention arm (RH 0.61, 95%CI: 0.41–0.91, P = 0.02). Interpretation There was no difference by study arm in the rate of acquisition of CT or GC. However, our per-protocol results suggest that consistent use of the diaphragm may reduce acquisition of GC. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00121459 [NCT00121459]"

Aberrant activation of the Wnt pathway leads to cancer and degenerative diseases. beta-catenin is a key signaling molecule that is frequently used as a direct monitor of Wnt pathway activation. This paper describes a multi-parametric method for quantitative analysis of cellular beta-catenin protein levels in a rapid and high-throughput manner. The assay offers temporally resolved detection of Wnt-stimulated accumulation of beta-catenin, simultaneously detecting cell number, and it sheds light onto the kinetics of posttranslational stabilization of beta-catenin."
https://openalex.org/W1997322703,"To determine if there is a gender dimorphism in the expression of leptin receptors (OB-R170, OB-R128 and OB-R98) and the protein suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) in human skeletal muscle, the protein expression of OB-R, perilipin A, SOCS3 and alpha-tubulin was assessed by Western blot in muscle biopsies obtained from the m. vastus lateralis in thirty-four men (age = 27.1±6.8 yr) and thirty-three women (age = 26.7±6.7 yr). Basal serum insulin concentration and HOMA were similar in both genders. Serum leptin concentration was 3.4 times higher in women compared to men (P<0.05) and this difference remained significant after accounting for the differences in percentage of body fat or soluble leptin receptor. OB-R protein was 41% (OB-R170, P<0.05) and 163% (OB-R128, P<0.05) greater in women than men. There was no relationship between OB-R expression and the serum concentrations of leptin or 17β-estradiol. In men, muscle OB-R128 protein was inversely related to serum free testosterone. In women, OB-R98 and OB-R128 were inversely related to total serum testosterone concentration, and OB-R128 to serum free testosterone concentration. SOCS3 protein expression was similar in men and women and was not related to OB-R. In women, there was an inverse relationship between the logarithm of free testosterone and SCOS3 protein content in skeletal muscle (r = −0.46, P<0.05). In summary, there is a gender dimorphism in skeletal muscle leptin receptors expression, which can be partly explained by the influence of testosterone. SOCS3 expression in skeletal muscle is not up-regulated in women, despite very high serum leptin concentrations compared to men. The circulating form of the leptin receptor can not be used as a surrogate measure of the amount of leptin receptors expressed in skeletal muscles."
https://openalex.org/W2053579742,"Background Sexual cannibalism may be a form of extreme sexual conflict in which females benefit more from feeding on males than mating with them, and males avoid aggressive, cannibalistic females in order to increase net fitness. A thorough understanding of the adaptive significance of sexual cannibalism is hindered by our ignorance of its prevalence in nature. Furthermore, there are serious doubts about the food value of males, probably because most studies that attempt to document benefits of sexual cannibalism to the female have been conducted in the laboratory with non-natural alternative prey. Thus, to understand more fully the ecology and evolution of sexual cannibalism, field experiments are needed to document the prevalence of sexual cannibalism and its benefits to females. Methodology/Principal Findings We conducted field experiments with the Mediterranean tarantula (Lycosa tarantula), a burrowing wolf spider, to address these issues. At natural rates of encounter with males, approximately a third of L. tarantula females cannibalized the male. The rate of sexual cannibalism increased with male availability, and females were more likely to kill and consume an approaching male if they had previously mated with another male. We show that females benefit from feeding on a male by breeding earlier, producing 30% more offspring per egg sac, and producing progeny of higher body condition. Offspring of sexually cannibalistic females dispersed earlier and were larger later in the season than spiderlings of non-cannibalistic females. Conclusions/Significance In nature a substantial fraction of female L. tarantula kill and consume approaching males instead of mating with them. This behaviour is more likely to occur if the female has mated previously. Cannibalistic females have higher rates of reproduction, and produce higher-quality offspring, than non-cannibalistic females. Our findings further suggest that female L. tarantula are nutrient-limited in nature and that males are high-quality prey. The results of these field experiments support the hypothesis that sexual cannibalism is adaptive to females."
https://openalex.org/W1995343989,"Intensive cellular movements occur during gastrulation. These cellular movements rely heavily on dynamic actin assembly. Rho with its associated proteins, including the Rho-activated formin, Diaphanous, are key regulators of actin assembly in cellular protrusion and migration. However, the function of Diaphanous in gastrulation cell movements remains unclear. To study the role of Diaphanous in gastrulation, we isolated a partial zebrafish diaphanous-related formin 2 (zdia2) clone with its N-terminal regulatory domains. The GTPase binding domain of zDia2 is highly conserved compared to its mammalian homologues. Using a yeast two-hybrid assay, we showed that zDia2 interacts with constitutively-active RhoA and Cdc42. The zdia2 mRNAs were ubiquitously expressed during early embryonic development in zebrafish as determined by RT-PCR and whole-mount in situ hybridization analyses. Knockdown of zdia2 by antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) blocked epiboly formation and convergent extension in a dose-dependent manner, whereas ectopic expression of a human mdia gene partially rescued these defects. Time-lapse recording further showed that bleb-like cellular processes of blastoderm marginal deep marginal cells and pseudopod-/filopod-like processes of prechordal plate cells and lateral cells were abolished in the zdia2 morphants. Furthermore, zDia2 acts cell-autonomously since transplanted zdia2-knockdown cells exhibited low protrusive activity with aberrant migration in wild type host embryos. Lastly, co-injection of antisense MOs of zdia2 and zebrafish profilin I (zpfn 1), but not zebrafish profilin II, resulted in a synergistic inhibition of gastrulation cell movements. These results suggest that zDia2 in conjunction with zPfn 1 are required for gastrulation cell movements in zebrafish."
https://openalex.org/W2001971893,"MHC class I molecules present a comprehensive mixture of peptides on the cell surface for immune surveillance. The peptides represent the intracellular protein milieu produced by translation of endogenous mRNAs. Unexpectedly, the peptides are encoded not only in conventional AUG initiated translational reading frames but also in alternative cryptic reading frames. Here, we analyzed how ribosomes recognize and use cryptic initiation codons in the mRNA. We find that translation initiation complexes assemble at non-AUG codons but differ from canonical AUG initiation in response to specific inhibitors acting within the peptidyl transferase and decoding centers of the ribosome. Thus, cryptic translation at non-AUG start codons can utilize a distinct initiation mechanism which could be differentially regulated to provide peptides for immune surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W2133128968,"Invasions of natural communities by non-indigenous species are currently rated as one of the most important global-scale threats to biodiversity. Biodiversity itself is known to reduce invasions and increase stability. Disturbances by ecosystem engineers affect the distribution, establishment, and abundance of species but this has been ignored in studies on diversity-invasibility relationships.We determined natural plant invasion into 46 plots varying in the number of plant species (1, 4, and 16) and plant functional groups (1, 2, 3, and 4) for three years beginning two years after the establishment of the Jena Experiment. We sampled subplots where earthworms were artificially added and others where earthworm abundance was reduced. We also performed a seed-dummy experiment to investigate the role of earthworms as secondary seed dispersers along a plant diversity gradient. Horizontal dispersal and burial of seed dummies were significantly reduced in subplots where earthworms were reduced in abundance. Seed dispersal by earthworms decreased with increasing plant species richness and presence of grasses but increased in presence of small herbs. These results suggest that dense vegetation inhibits the surface activity of earthworms. Further, there was a positive relationship between the number of earthworms and the number and diversity of invasive plants. Hence, earthworms decreased the stability of grassland communities against plant invasion.Invasibility decreased and stability increased with increasing plant diversity and, most remarkably, earthworms modulated the diversity-invasibility relationship. While the impacts of earthworms were unimportant in low diverse (low earthworm densities) and high diverse (high floral structural complexity) plant communities, earthworms decreased the stability of intermediate diverse plant communities against plant invasion. Overall, the results document that fundamental processes in plant communities like plant seed burial and invader establishment are modulated by soil fauna calling for closer cooperation between soil animal and plant ecologists."
https://openalex.org/W1976803567,"The Fas pathway is a major regulator of T cell homeostasis, however, the T cell population that is controlled by the Fas pathway in vivo is poorly defined. Although CD4 and CD8 single positive (SP) T cells are the two major T cell subsets in the periphery of wild type mice, the repertoire of mice bearing loss-of-function mutation in either Fas (lpr mice) or Fas ligand (gld mice) is predominated by CD4(-)CD8(-) double negative alphabeta T cells that also express B220 and generally referred to as B220+DN T cells. Despite extensive analysis, the basis of B220+DN T cell lymphoproliferation remains poorly understood. In this study we re-examined the issue of why T cell lymphoproliferation caused by gld mutation is predominated by B220+DN T cells.We combined the following approaches to study this question: Gene transcript profiling, BrdU labeling, and apoptosis assays. Our results show that B220+DN T cells are proliferating and dying at exceptionally high rates than SP T cells in the steady state. The high proliferation rate is restricted to B220+DN T cells found in the gut epithelium whereas the high apoptosis rate occurred both in the gut epithelium and periphery. However, only in the periphery, apoptosis of B220+DN T cell is Fas-dependent. When the Fas pathway is genetically impaired, apoptosis of peripheral B220+DN T cells was reduced to a baseline level similar to that of SP T cells. Under these conditions of normalized apoptosis, B220+DN T cells progressively accumulate in the periphery, eventually resulting in B220+DN T cell lymphoproliferation.The Fas pathway plays a critical role in regulating the tissue distribution of DN T cells through targeting and elimination of DN T cells from the periphery in the steady state. The results provide new insight into pathogenesis of DN T cell lymphoproliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2114000842,"Ciguatoxins and brevetoxins are neurotoxic cyclic polyether compounds produced by dinoflagellates, which are responsible for ciguatera and neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP) respectively. Recently, brevenal, a natural compound was found to specifically inhibit brevetoxin action and to have a beneficial effect in NSP. Considering that brevetoxin and ciguatoxin specifically activate voltage-sensitive Na+ channels through the same binding site, brevenal has therefore a good potential for the treatment of ciguatera. Pacific ciguatoxin-1B (P-CTX-1B) activates voltage-sensitive Na+ channels and promotes an increase in neurotransmitter release believed to underpin the symptoms associated with ciguatera. However, the mechanism through which slow Na+ influx promotes neurosecretion is not fully understood. In the present study, we used chromaffin cells as a model to reconstitute the sequence of events culminating in ciguatoxin-evoked neurosecretion. We show that P-CTX-1B induces a tetrodotoxin-sensitive rise in intracellular Na+, closely followed by an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ responsible for promoting SNARE-dependent catecholamine secretion. Our results reveal that brevenal and β-naphtoyl-brevetoxin prevent P-CTX-1B secretagogue activity without affecting nicotine or barium-induced catecholamine secretion. Brevenal is therefore a potent inhibitor of ciguatoxin-induced neurotoxic effect and a potential treatment for ciguatera."
https://openalex.org/W1980032746,"The largest (up to 2 tons) and a globally distributed teleost—the ocean sunfish Mola mola—is commonly regarded as a planktonic fish because of its unusual shape including absence of caudal fin. This common view was recently questioned because the horizontal movements of the ocean sunfish tracked by acoustic telemetry were independent of ocean currents. However, direct information regarding their locomotor performance under natural conditions is still lacking. By using multi-sensor tags, we show that sunfish indeed swam continuously with frequent vertical movements at speeds of 0.4–0.7 m s–1, which is similar to the records of other large fishes such as salmons, marlins, and pelagic sharks. The acceleration data revealed that they stroked their dorsal and anal fins synchronously (dominant frequency, 0.3–0.6 Hz) to generate a lift-based thrust, as penguins do using two symmetrical flippers. Morphological studies of sunfish (mass, 2–959 kg) showed that the dorsal and anal fins had similar external (symmetrical shape and identical area) and internal (identical locomotory muscle mass) features; however, the muscle shape differed markedly. We conclude that ocean sunfish have functional dorsoventral symmetry with regards to the non-homologous dorsal and anal fins that act as a pair of vertical hydrofoils. Although sunfish lack a swimbladder, we found that they are neutrally buoyant independent of depth because of their subcutaneous gelatinous tissue that has low density and is incompressible. Efficient lift-based swimming in conjunction with neutral buoyancy enables sunfish to travel long distances both horizontally and vertically."
https://openalex.org/W2040364436,"Membrane depolarization controls long lasting adaptive neuronal changes in brain physiology and pathology. Such responses are believed to be gene expression-dependent. Notably, however, only a couple of gene repressors active in nondepolarized neurons have been described. In this study, we show that in the unstimulated rat hippocampus in vivo, as well as in the nondepolarized brain neurons in primary culture, the transcriptional regulator Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is bound to the proximal Mmp-9 promoter and strongly represses Mmp-9 transcription. Furthermore, we demonstrate that monoubiquitinated and CtBP1 (C-terminal binding protein 1)-bound YY1 regulates Mmp-9 mRNA synthesis in rat brain neurons controlling its transcription apparently via HDAC3-dependent histone deacetylation. In conclusion, our data suggest that YY1 exerts, via epigenetic mechanisms, a control over neuronal expression of MMP-9. Because MMP-9 has recently been shown to play a pivotal role in physiological and pathological neuronal plasticity, YY1 may be implicated in these phenomena as well.

Because MMP-9 has recently been shown to play a pivotal role in physiological and pathological neuronal plasticity, YY1 may be implicated in these phenomena as well. Neuronal depolarization is important not only for a transmission of information throughout the nervous system but also for an initiation of adaptive neuronal responses to incoming stimuli. Examples of the adaptive changes are long term potentiation and kindling-evoked epileptogenesis believed to underlie physiological (such as learning and memory) and pathological neuronal plasticity, respectively. These long lasting adaptive changes have been linked to an activation of gene expression. Indeed, a number of depolarization-driven gene responses were described over the last 20 years, and in almost all cases inducible transcription factors, like cAMP-response element-binding protein, Elk-1, AP-1, Egrs, etc. (for review see Ref. 1.Kaczmarek L. Robertson H. Immediate Early Genes and Inducible Transcription Factors in Mapping of the Central Nervous System Function and Dysfunction. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York2002Google Scholar), were found to be responsible for the increased gene expression. However, it is also conceivable to consider a repression of transcription, in addition to its activation, as a means to drive depolarization-evoked gene expression. So far only a very limited number of such repressive molecules has been discovered (2.Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R.

We focused on a regulation of Mmp-9 that codes for an extracellular matrix protease involved in physiological and pathological extracellular matrix remodeling. Aberrant, and usually excessive, Mmp-9 expression has been linked to numerous disorders of the central nervous system (5.Dzwonek J. Rylski M. Kaczmarek L.

Hence, detailed knowledge of its transcriptional repression is of great importance for an understanding of those pathologies and for a potential development of novel therapeutic approaches.

However, its expression levels in those cells are very low, which points toward a presence of an efficient mechanism(s) repressing its transcription in unstimulated neurons (10.Szklarczyk A. Lapinska J. Rylski M. McKay R.D. Kaczmarek L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 920-930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular mechanisms directly controlling MMP-9 transcription in physiology and pathology of neurons remain unknown. Data from other cell types clearly indicate that MMP-9 expression is regulated primarily at the level of transcription (6.van den Steen P.E. Dubois B. Nelissen I. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Opdenakker G. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 37: 375-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar).

Using the DNase I footprinting, a method for an identification of novel DNA regulatory proteins (17.Antoniv T.T. Tanaka S. Sudan B. De Val S. Liu K. Wang L. Wells D.J. Bou-Gharios G. Ramirez F. J.

As a result, we have identified YY1, a transcription factor belonging to a Polycomb group of proteins (PcGs), as a potential Mmp-9 gene repressor. We have confirmed this finding with a collection of different approaches, employing ex vivo brain mRNA, protein and chromatin extracts, as well as in vitro neuronal cultures. Animals—The experiments on animals were performed on adult male Wistar rats (weighing 210-300 g), according to the rules established by the Ethical Committee on Animal Research of the Nencki Institute, based on national laws that are in a full agreement with the European Union directive on animal experimentation. Pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) Stimulation—The animals were handled and injected with physiological saline daily for 3-4 days before the experimental treatment. Then pentylenetetrazole (50 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally. Animals were sacrificed 2 and 4 h after an onset of seizures. Only the animals displaying clear seizures were used for the experiments. Plasmids—Rat Mmp-9 gene promoter fragments -290/+18 bp and -557/-282 bp were cloned separately into the BamHI site of pUC 18 and used for DNase I footprinting. Rat Mmp-9 gene promoter fragment -1369/+35 bp was cloned into MluI/BglII sites of pGL3(R2.1) (Promega) for reporter assays. Point mutation in the core of the footprinted YY1-binding site of the Mmp-9 gene promoter was generated with the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Rat YY1 full-length coding sequence was amplified from cDNA library obtained from the unstimulated rat hippocampus and cloned into AscI/EcoRI site of GW1 vector (the vector was a generous gift from Dr. J. Jaworski, International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Warsaw, Poland). Construct expressing siRNA for YY1 was cloned by inserting at BglII/HindIII sites of pSUPER (19.Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar) the following double-stranded oligonucleotide directed for 994-1012-bp region of the rat YY1 mRNA: 994-1012 bp (sense), GATCCCCGTTGAGAGCTCAAAGCTAATTCAAGAGATTAGCTTTGAGCTCTCAACTTTTTGGAAA, and 994-1012 bp (antisense), AGCTTTTCCAAAAAGTTGAGAGCTCAAAGCTAATCTCTTGAATTAGCTTTGAGCTCTCAACGGG. For FISH probe production we used the pCRII plasmid containing the rat MMP-9 full-length coding sequence amplified from a rat visual cortex cDNA library (12.Konopacki F.A. Rylski M. Wilczek E. Amborska R. Detka D. Kaczmarek L. Wilczynski G.M. Neuroscience. 2007; 150: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Construct expressing cytomegalovirus promoter-driven GFP was a generous gift from Dr. K. Duniec (Nencki Institute, Warsaw, Poland). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Sigma. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (ABI377, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Antibodies—The following antibodies and suppliers were used: anti-YY1 (H-10 and C-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-CtBP1 (Pharmingen); anti-HDAC1 (H-51) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-HDAC2 (H-54) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-HDAC2 (3F3) (Abcam); anti-HDAC3 (H-99) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (MAB374) (Chemicon); histone H3 (07-690) (Upstate/Millipore); anti-ubiquitin (P4D1) (Cell Signaling); anti-acetylhistone H3 (06-599; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.); anti-acetylhistone H4 (06-866; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.); anti-RNA polymerase II CTD repeat YSPTSPS (phospho-Ser-5) antibody (ab5131; Abcam); and anti-RNA polymerase II CTD repeat YSPTSPS (phospho-Ser-2) antibody (ab5095; Abcam). RNA Extraction—Total RNA was extracted using TRI Reagent® (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's procedure. RT-PCR—1 μg of RNA samples was subjected to RT reaction using SuperScript first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) according to enclosed procedure. PCR was performed with TaqPCR core kit (Qiagen). Primers and PCR conditions for MMP-9 were the same as described previously (10.Szklarczyk A. Lapinska J. Rylski M. McKay R.D. Kaczmarek L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 920-930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) For YY1 cDNA amplification we used the following primers: ACCAAGAGGTGATTCTGGTG and CTGCTCTTCAACCACTGTTTC, which were annealed to the templates at 59 °C. Nuclear Protein Lysates—Rat hippocampal nuclear protein lysates were prepared using CelLytic™ NuCLEAR™ extraction kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lysis buffer additionally contained 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm sodium butyrate, and 100× diluted protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Protein concentration was calculated using Bradford method. DNase I Footprinting—The rat Mmp-9 gene promoter fragments were cut out of pUC 18. DNase I footprinting was conducted using Core Footprinting System (Promega) according to manufacturer's procedure. Products of the reaction were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), ethanol-precipitated, and dissolved in gel loading solution containing formamide and urea, and then resolved by electrophoresis in a DNA sequencing gel. Dried gels were exposed to BioMax system (Eastman Kodak Co.). MatInspector Analyses—We searched MatInspector's library (28.Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar) of weight matrices for transcription factor-binding sites. We analyzed matrix group of vertebrates. A matrix similarity higher than 0.85 was used as a cutoff for consideration of potential query sequence matches with known transcription factor recognition sequences. Electromobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—For EMSA probe we used the following double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the footprinted YY1 site from rat Mmp-9 gene promoter. Sequences of probes were as follows: for the wild-type region (YY1-binding site is underlined) GACCTAGGACTAGATGGCCCCTCCACCA, and for the mutated region (mutated nucleotides are underlined) GACCTAGGACTAGATAATCCCTCCACCA. We prepared double-stranded oligonucleotide probes by annealing equimolar amounts (10 μm) of complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides in an solution containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 m NaCl, 0.05 m EDTA. Oligonucleotides were placed at 65 °C for 10 min, slowly cooled down to room temperature, and then kept at 4 °C for overnight. 100 ng of double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and purified with NucTrap probe purification columns (Stratagene). Binding reactions were performed in a 20-μl volume. They contained 20 μg of rat hippocampal nuclear protein lysate diluted in buffer containing 5% glycerol, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml poly(dI·dC), 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm sodium butyrate, and 100× diluted protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Rat nuclear hippocampal protein lysates were extracted from six different control or PTZ-stimulated rats and then they were mixed together. Samples were incubated for 15 min on ice, and then 30,000 cpm of probe was added followed by final incubation for 30 min on ice. Immediately before loading of samples on the gel, we added ice-cold 5× gel loading buffer (2× Tris-glycine buffer, 50% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue). Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on nondenaturing 8% polyacrylamide gels in 1× Tris-glycine buffer and were visualized by autoradiography. EMSA Supershift—EMSA binding reaction was performed as described above, but 2 μg of antibody anti-YY1 (H-10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was additionally included. Samples were incubated for 90 min on ice, and then 30,000 cpm of probe was added followed by a final incubation for 30 min on ice. Immediately before a loading of samples on the gel, we added ice-cold 5× gel loading buffer (2× Tris-glycine buffer, 50% glycerol, 0.2% bromphenol blue). Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on nondenaturing 8% polyacrylamide gels in 1× Tris-glycine buffer and were visualized by autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (20.Rylski M. Welch J.J. Chen Y.Y. Letting D.L. Diehl J.A. Chodosh L.A. Blobel G.A. Weiss M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5031-5042Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Two micrograms of appropriate antibody was added into the samples. Western Blot Analysis—The samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE in Tris-glycine running buffer (25 mm Tris, 250 mm glycine (pH 8.3), 0.1% SDS) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) in transfer buffer (48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, 0.037% SDS, 20% methanol). Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk/TBST (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 125 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated with an appropriate primary antibody (YY1α (H10) 1:400; CtBP1α 1:5000; ubiquitin α 1:1000; HDAC1α 1:1000; HDAC2α 1:2000; HDAC3α 1:1000; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-α 1:5000; histone H3α 1:1000) at 4 °C for overnight, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody IgG (Vector Laboratories) was added at a dilution of 1:5000. Results were developed using ECL Plus™ reagent (Amersham Biosciences) on an x-ray film (Kodak). Rat Primary Neuronal Culture—Rat primary cortical neurons were prepared from newborn (P0) Wistar rats as described (21.Jaworski J. Mioduszewska B. Sanchez-Capelo A. Figiel I. Habas A. Gozdz A. Proszynski T. Hetman M. Mallet J. Kaczmarek L. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4519-4526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, dissociated cortical neurons were plated at a density of 106 cells/ml in the basal medium Eagle's supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated bovine calf serum, 35 mm glucose, 1 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and maintained in a humidified incubator with 6.5% CO2 at 37 °C. Plates were coated with poly-d-lysine. Cytosine-β-d-arabinofuranoside (2.5 mm; Sigma) was added to cultures on the 2nd day after seeding to inhibit the proliferation of non-neuronal cells. Previous studies demonstrated that >90% of the cells in this culture preparation are neurons (22.Hetman M. Kanning K. Cavanaugh J.E. Xia Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22569-22580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The cultures were lipofected at either 48 or 72 h after cytosine-β-d-arabinofuranoside introduction. Two days later, they were stimulated with 30 mm KCl. Lipofection—DNA constructs were introduced into rat primary cultures by a lipofection with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Lipofection efficiency ranged from 10 to 15% depending on an experiment. Luciferase Reporter Assay—Luciferase activity was evaluated using luciferase assay system with Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega) according to enclosed protocol. Results were recorded using luminometer model 2030-000 (Turner Biosystems) and presented in relative light units. Immunocytochemistry on Cultured Cells—The cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, incubated for antigen retrieval in 1× SSC for 30 min at 85 °C, and then permeabilized in 1× PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The cultures were stained with anti-YY1 antibody (H-10; diluted 1:200) purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The staining was detected using goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated antibody (Invitrogen; diluted 1:200). Finally, cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). The samples were examined by the fluorescent microscopy by an Olympus IX70. Brain Immunohistochemistry—Animals were deeply anesthetized and perfused intracardially with cold 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4). Brains were dissected from the skulls, fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C, and transferred to 30% sucrose for 3 days. Frozen brains were cut in 40-μm-thick sections on a cryostat (Cryocut 1800, Leica) and kept in 1 m PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide. The stainings were performed on free-floating sections. The sections were washed in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, incubated to retrieved antigens in 2× SSC buffer (sodium chloride/sodium citrate buffer, Sigma) for 30 min at 80 °C, and washed once in PBS/Triton X-100. Samples were blocked with 10% normal donkey serum for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times for 10 min with PBS/Triton X-100, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary anti-YY1 (H-10) or anti-CtBP1 antibody (both diluted 1:200). The sections were then washed three times in PBS/Triton X-100 for 10 min and incubated for 2 h with donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated IgG (1:200, Invitrogen). After the incubation samples were washed in PBS/Triton X-100 for 10 min, incubated with TO-PRO-3 (1:3000, Molecular Probes) for 5 min at room temperature to stain cell nuclei, and washed once in PBS/Triton X-100. The sections were mounted on slides, air-dried, and covered with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Images were captured using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica). Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization (FISH) for MMP-9 mRNA Combined with Immunocytochemical Staining for GFP—For MMP-9 mRNA detection, fluorescein-labeled cRNA probes were used. Probes were prepared using the in vitro transcription method. Probe labeling reactions were performed with fluorescein RNA labeling mix (Roche Applied Science) and catalyzed by T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase (both from Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. pCRII plasmid containing the full-length coding sequence of rat MMP-9 was linearized and used as a template to generate antisense (complementary to mRNA) and sense (identical to mRNA) probes. Sense probe was used as a negative control. In situ hybridization reaction was performed in 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed cultures that were permeabilized with 1× SSC containing 1% Triton X-100 and subjected to a prehybridization. The samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in prehybridization solution (Sigma) diluted 1:1 with formamide and then hybridized overnight at 60 °C in hybridization solution (Sigma) containing one of the denatured probes diluted 1:100. After hybridization the specimens were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in RNase A solution (20 μg/ml) prepared in 2× SSC. The post-hybridization washes (each for 15 min at 55 °C) were performed in the following solutions: 2× SSC, 2× SSC containing 50% formamide, 0.5× SSC, 50% formamide, 0.1× SSC, 50% formamide, and 0.1× SSC. Prior to probe detection the specimens were incubated with 3% H2O2 for 30 min at room temperature and blocked with blocking solution from cyanine 3-coupled tyramide signal amplification system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 h at room temperature. Then peroxidase-coupled anti-fluorescein antibody (Roche Applied Science) diluted 1:200 in blocking solution (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was applied to the samples for overnight at 4 °C. The hybridization signal was developed using the cyanine 3-coupled tyramide signal amplification system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to manufacturer's instructions. The FISH procedure quenched GFP capacity to fluoresce; thus, one had to detect GFP expression using immunocytochemical staining. To this end, the samples after FISH were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with anti-GFP antibody (sc-9996; diluted 1:100) purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and then detected with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen; diluted 1:200). Finally, cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (Vector Laboratories), and the resulting samples were examined by the fluorescent microscopy by an Olympus IX70. Co-immunostaining for YY1 and CtBP1—The brain sections were prepared as described above. The sections were stained for YY1 (1:200; anti-YY, H-10) overnight at 4 °C and then the signal was detected by 2 h of incubation with Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:200, Invitrogen). Next the samples were washed three times in PBS/Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature, blocked with 10% normal horse serum for 1 h, and incubated with CtBP1 (1:400) for overnight at 4 °C. After three washes in PBS/Triton X-100 for 10 min, the samples were incubated with a secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200, Invitrogen) in PBS/Triton X-100 for 2 h at room temperature. The sections were washed three times in PBS/Triton X-100 for 10 min, incubated with incubated with TO-PRO-3 (1:3000, Molecular Probes) in PBS/Triton X-100 for 5 min, and again washed once in PBS/Triton X-100 for 10 min. The sections were mounted on slides, air-dried, and covered with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Images were captured using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica). Co-immunostaining for YY1 and NeuN—The brain sections used for the stainings were prepared as described above. Samples were incubated with anti-YY1 H-10 antibody (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for overnight at 4 °C. After triple washes in PBS/Triton X-100 for 10 min, the sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200, Invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature, washed three times in PBS/Triton X-100 for 10 min, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After further washes, the sections were blocked in 10% normal mouse serum and incubated with mouse anti-NeuN biotin-conjugated antibody (1:100, Chemicon) for 2 h at room temperature. Then the samples were washed three times in PBS/Triton X-100 for 10 min, incubated with streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 647 (1:200, Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature, and washed again analogically. The sections were mounted on slides, air-dried, and covered with Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Images were captured using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—For ChIP both rat hippocampi were immediately isolated, fragmented with a blue pipette tip in 1% formaldehyde, and incubated at 37 °C with agitation. Total time for a contact of the tissue with the fixative was 15 min., samples were washed six times in ice-cold 1× PBS containing 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm sodium butyrate, and 100× diluted protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Pellets were resuspended in SDS Lysis Buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1) containing 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm sodium butyrate, and 100× diluted protease inhibitor mixture), homogenized, incubated on ice for 10 min with frequent vortexing, and subjected to sonication to get ∼1-kb chromatin fragments. Sonicated tissue was centrifuged (13,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C), and supernatants from six different rats of the same group (neuronally unstimulated rats versus PTZ-induced ones) were pooled together and diluted 10× in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 167 mm NaCl containing 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm sodium butyrate, and 100 times diluted protease inhibitor mixture). The polled samples were then separated equally into four study samples. For input sample, an additional equivalent of 1% of the pooled sample volume was saved. ChIP was carried out with chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Samples were precleared with agarose A beads. Next, 2 μg of anti-YY1α H-10 or C-20, 3 μg of CtBP1α and HDAC3α, 4 μg of RNA polymerase II antibodies were added into two of the study samples, and an equivalent amount of normal isotype control antibody to the others. Then, the procedure followed manufacturer's protocol. Each experiment was repeated in triplicate. Real Time PCR—Samples containing purified ChIPed DNA were subjected to the real time PCR analysis using 7500 real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). PCR was performed with TaqPCR core kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's procedure. PCR additionally contained 40 ppm of SYBR Green I (Sigma). Primer pairs amplifying two different rat Mmp-9 gene proximal promoter regions were as follows: for -157/-7-bp region M10 (CTTTGGGCTGCCCAACAC) as well as M20 (AGCAGAATTTGCGGAGGTTTT), and for -187/-13-bp region C1 (GCATAAAGGAGTGGGTAGTG) and C2 (GTGAAGCAGAATTTGCGGAG). Annealing temperatures were 57 °C for M10/M20 primer pair and 55 °C for C1/C2. For amplification of the distal Mmp-9 promoter fragment, we used primers U1 (ACTCACCCAGGGAACATTTG) and U2 (CCCCAAACGCTGAAGTATGT) and annealing temperature 60 °C. These primers amplified the -3631/-3516 region of the Mmp-9 promoter. For amplification of the region downstream to Mmp-9 gene promoter we used primers D1 (GGTGCTGGAGAGGTAGGTGA) and D2 (AGTGAAAATGGACCCCACAG) and annealing temperature of 60 °C. These primers amplified a region situated in the last Mmp-9 intron (∼7 kb downstream to the Mmp-9 promoter). Each PCR was repeated at least six times. The Ct value fo"
https://openalex.org/W2075302199,"There is a need for new vaccines for tuberculosis (TB) that protect against adult pulmonary disease in regions where BCG is not effective. However, BCG could remain integral to TB control programmes because neonatal BCG protects against disseminated forms of childhood TB and many new vaccines rely on BCG to prime immunity or are recombinant strains of BCG. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is required for immunity to mycobacteria and used as a marker of immunity when new vaccines are tested. Although BCG is widely given to neonates IFN-gamma responses to BCG in this age group are poorly described. Characterisation of IFN-gamma responses to BCG is required for interpretation of vaccine immunogenicity study data where BCG is part of the vaccination strategy.236 healthy Gambian babies were vaccinated with M. bovis BCG at birth. IFN-gamma, interleukin (IL)-5 and IL-13 responses to purified protein derivative (PPD), killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis (KMTB), M. tuberculosis short term culture filtrate (STCF) and M. bovis BCG antigen 85 complex (Ag85) were measured in a whole blood assay two months after vaccination. Cytokine responses varied up to 10 log-fold within this population. The majority of infants (89-98% depending on the antigen) made IFN-gamma responses and there was significant correlation between IFN-gamma responses to the different mycobacterial antigens (Spearman's coefficient ranged from 0.340 to 0.675, p = 10(-6)-10(-22)). IL-13 and IL-5 responses were generally low and there were more non-responders (33-75%) for these cytokines. Nonetheless, significant correlations were observed for IL-13 and IL-5 responses to different mycobacterial antigensCytokine responses to mycobacterial antigens in BCG-vaccinated infants are heterogeneous and there is significant inter-individual variation. Further studies in large populations of infants are required to identify the factors that determine variation in IFN-gamma responses."

We examined whether HIV-specific T-cells are identified in the liver of HCV/HIV co-infected individuals and promote liver inflammation through bystander immune responses.Ex-vivo intra-hepatic lymphocytes from HCV mono-infected and HCV/HIV co-infected individuals were assessed for immune responses to HIV and HCV antigens by polychromatic flow cytometry.HCV/HIV liver biopsies had similar frequencies of lymphocytes but lower percentages of CD4+ T-cells compared to HCV biopsies. In co-infection, intra-hepatic HIV-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells producing IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were detected and were comparable in frequency to those that were HCV-specific. In co-infected individuals, viral-specific CD8+ T-cells produced more of the fibrogenic cytokine, TNF-alpha. In both mono- and co-infected individuals, intra-hepatic HCV-specific T-cells were poorly functional compared to HIV-specific T-cells. In co-infection, HAART was not associated with a reconstitution of intra-hepatic CD4+ T-cells and was associated with reduction in both HIV and HCV-specific intra-hepatic cytokine responses.The accumulation of functional HIV-specific T-cells in the liver during HCV/HIV co-infection may represent a bystander role for HIV in inducing faster progression of liver disease."
https://openalex.org/W2025802647,"Intimal hyperplasia (IH) limits the patency of all cardiovascular vein bypass grafts. We previously found the myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS), a key protein kinase C (PKC) substrate, to be up-regulated in canine models of IH. Here, we further characterize the role of MARCKS in IH and examine the phenotypic consequences of MARCKS silencing by small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection in human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) in vitro and use a rapid 10-min nonviral siRNA transfection technique to determine the effects of MARCKS silencing in human saphenous vein cultured ex vivo. We demonstrate MARCKS silencing attenuates VSMC migration and arrests VSMC proliferation in part through the up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(kip1). Conversely, MARCKS silencing had little or no effect on EC migration or proliferation. These phenotypic changes culminated in reduced neointimal formation in cultured human saphenous vein. These data identify MARCKS as a pathogenic contributor to IH and indicate therapeutic MARCKS silencing could selectively suppress the ""atherogenic,"" proliferative phenotype of VSMCs without collateral harm to the endothelium. This approach could be readily translated to the clinic to silence MARCKS in vein bypass grafts prior to implantation."
https://openalex.org/W2153668050,"High-throughput short-read technologies have revolutionized DNA sequencing by drastically reducing the cost per base of sequencing information. Despite producing gigabases of sequence per run, these technologies still present obstacles in resequencing and de novo assembly applications due to biased or insufficient target sequence coverage. We present here a simple sample preparation method termed the ""long march"" that increases both contig lengths and target sequence coverage using high-throughput short-read technologies. By incorporating a Type IIS restriction enzyme recognition motif into the sequencing primer adapter, successive rounds of restriction enzyme cleavage and adapter ligation produce a set of nested sub-libraries from the initial amplicon library. Sequence reads from these sub-libraries are offset from each other with enough overlap to aid assembly and contig extension. We demonstrate the utility of the long march in resequencing of the Plasmodium falciparum transcriptome, where the number of genomic bases covered was increased by 39%, as well as in metagenomic analysis of a serum sample from a patient with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related acute liver failure, where the number of HBV bases covered was increased by 42%. We also offer a theoretical optimization of the long march for de novo sequence assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2030310377,"Inactivation of p27Kip1 is implicated in tumorigenesis and has both prognostic and treatment-predictive values for many types of human cancer. The transcription factor Stat1 is essential for innate immunity and tumor immunosurveillance through its ability to act downstream of interferons. Herein, we demonstrate that Stat1 functions as a suppressor of Ras transformation independently of an interferon response. Inhibition of Ras transformation and tumorigenesis requires the phosphorylation of Stat1 at tyrosine 701 but is independent of Stat1 phosphorylation at serine 727. Stat1 induces p27Kip1 expression in Ras transformed cells at the transcriptional level through mechanisms that depend on Stat1 phosphorylation at tyrosine 701 and activation of Stat3. The tumor suppressor properties of Stat1 in Ras transformation are reversed by the inactivation of p27Kip1. Our work reveals a novel functional link between Stat1 and p27Kip1, which act in coordination to suppress the oncogenic properties of activated Ras. It also supports the notion that evaluation of Stat1 phosphorylation in human tumors may prove a reliable prognostic factor for patient outcome and a predictor of treatment response to anticancer therapies aimed at activating Stat1 and its downstream effectors."
https://openalex.org/W2073239402,"Background Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte (CTL) response drives the evolution of HIV-1 at a host-level by selecting HLA-restricted escape mutations. Dissecting the dynamics of these escape mutations at a population-level would help to understand how HLA-mediated selection drives the evolution of HIV-1. Methodology/Principal Findings We undertook a study of the dynamics of HIV-1 CTL-escape mutations by analyzing through statistical approaches and phylogenetic methods the viral gene gag sequenced in plasma samples collected between the years 1987 and 2006 from 302 drug-naïve HIV-positive patients. By applying logistic regression models and after performing correction for multiple test, we identified 22 potential CTL-escape mutations (p-value<0.05; q-value<0.2); 10 of these associations were confirmed in samples biologically independent by a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte-Carlo method. Analyzing their prevalence back in time we found that escape mutations that are the consensus residue in samples collected after 2003 have actually significantly increased in time in one of either B or F subtype until becoming the most frequent residue, while dominating the other viral subtype. Their estimated prevalence in the viral subtype they did not dominate was lower than 30% for the majority of samples collected at the end of the 80's. In addition, when screening the entire viral region, we found that the 75% of positions significantly changing in time (p<0.05) were located within known CTL epitopes. Conclusions Across HIV Gag protein, the rise of polymorphisms from independent origin during the last twenty years of epidemic in our setting was related to an association with an HLA allele. The fact that these mutations accumulated in one of either B or F subtypes have also dominated the other subtype shows how this selection might be causing a convergence of viral subtypes to variants which are more likely to evade the immune response of the population where they circulate."
https://openalex.org/W2078592389,"Background Prolonged neonatal exposure to hyperoxia is associated with high mortality, leukocyte influx in airspaces, and impaired alveolarization. Inhibitors of type 4 phosphodiesterases are potent anti-inflammatory drugs now proposed for lung disorders. The current study was undertaken to determine the effects of the prototypal phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor rolipram on alveolar development and on hyperoxia-induced lung injury. Methodology/Findings Rat pups were placed under hyperoxia (FiO2>95%) or room air from birth, and received rolipram or its diluent daily until sacrifice. Mortality rate, weight gain and parameters of lung morphometry were recorded on day 10. Differential cell count and cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage and cytokine mRNA levels in whole lung were recorded on day 6. Rolipram diminished weight gain either under air or hyperoxia. Hyperoxia induced huge mortality rate reaching 70% at day 10, which was prevented by rolipram. Leukocyte influx in bronchoalveolar lavage under hyperoxia was significantly diminished by rolipram. Hyperoxia increased transcript and protein levels of IL-6, MCP1, and osteopontin; rolipram inhibited the increase of these proteins. Alveolarization was impaired by hyperoxia and was not restored by rolipram. Under room air, rolipram-treated pups had significant decrease of Radial Alveolar Count. Conclusions Although inhibition of phosphodiesterases 4 prevented mortality and lung inflammation induced by hyperoxia, it had no effect on alveolarization impairment, which might be accounted for by the aggressiveness of the model. The less complex structure of immature lungs of rolipram-treated pups as compared with diluent-treated pups under room air may be explained by the profound effect of PDE4 inhibition on weight gain that interfered with normal alveolarization."

However on a scale from 0 to 10, the intensity of NRL-related symptoms decreased from 8.5 before to 2.3 after implementation of regulations on powder-free NRL gloves. A higher number of subjects were able to avoid NRL in the private than in the work environment (85% vs. 61%). NRL-related symptoms decreased and WAI increased with successful avoidance of NRL at workplace (b = 0.23, p = 0.003). QOL was only little affected by NRL allergy (mean: MiniAQLQ = 6.0; DLQI = 4.1).Although there was improvement after implementation of powder-free NRL gloves, there is still a considerable number of HCW with NRL-related symptoms.

Typically, a sequential series of events are necessary for MAPK activation: phosphorylation, dimerization, and then subsequent translocation to the nucleus. Interestingly, a constitutively active JNK isoform, JNK2α2, possesses the ability to autophosphorylate and has been implicated in several human tumors, including glioblastoma multiforme. Because overexpression of JNK2α2 enhances several tumorigenic phenotypes, including cell growth and tumor formation in mice, we studied the mechanisms of JNK2α2 autophosphorylation and autoactivation. We find that JNK2α2 dimerization in vitro and in vivo occurs independently of its autophosphorylation but is dependent on nine amino acids, known as the α-region. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the α-region reveals that five specific mutants (L218A, K220A, G221A, I224A, and F225A) prevent JNK2α2 dimerization rendering JNK2α2 inactive and incapable of stimulating tumor formation. Previous studies coupled with additional mutagenesis of neighboring isoleucines and leucines (I208A, I214A, I231A, and I238A) suggest that a leucine zipper may play an important role in JNK2α2 homodimerization. We also show that a kinase-inactive JNK2α2 mutant can interact with and inhibit wild type JNK2α2 autophosphorylation, suggesting that JNK2α2 undergoes trans-autophosphorylation. Together, our results demonstrate that JNK2α2 differs from other MAPK proteins in two major ways; its autoactivation/autophosphorylation is dependent on dimerization, and dimerization most likely precedes autophosphorylation.

By regulating AP-1 complexes and other transcription factors, JNK can regulate apoptosis, cellular proliferation, and differentiation (1.Kyriakis J.M. Liu H. Chadee D.N. Methods Mol.

Members of the JNK family have emerged as having important and diverse functions, depending on the isoform. Three distinct genes encoding JNKs are known: JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3, and at least 10 different splicing isoforms exist in mammalian cells. JNK1 and JNK2 are expressed in all tissues, whereas JNK3 expression is restricted to the brain, heart, and testis (3.Bode A.M. Dong Z. Mol. Carcinog. 2007; 46: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). JNK1 and JNK2 were initially believed to possess redundant functions; however, it was found that JNK1 preferentially mediates apoptosis (4.Butterfield L. Storey B. Maas L. Heasley L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10110-10116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), whereas JNK2 is associated with cellular proliferation (5.Arbour N. Naniche D. Homann D. Davis R.J.

These findings suggest that individual JNK isoforms may play different roles in cellular transformation. Recently, JNK2 has been implicated in tumorigenesis because JNK2-deficient mice were more resistant to the induction of papillomas, and silencing of JNK2 through RNA interference was shown to hinder the growth of the human T98G glioblastoma cell line (6.Chen N.

JNK2α2 was also found to activate two crucial effectors of tumorigenesis: increased phosphorylation of AKT and increased eIF4E levels. AKT is a critical mediator for cell survival and proliferation, and eIF4E is a component of a cap-dependent translation initiation complex that is linked to breast, colon, and prostate tumors (9.Cui J.

Previous work argues that MAPK proteins, such as ERK1/2 and JNK, can dimerize and that dimerization may play an integral role in the activation of these MAPK proteins (11.Wilsbacher J.L. Juang Y.C.

Studies with ERK2 have shown that disruption of ERK homodimers reduces its ability to localize to the nucleus and that only homodimers are actively transported to the nucleus (12.Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5347-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 13.Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation by upstream MAPK kinases is necessary for and precedes ERK2 dimerization (12.Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5347-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Unlike ERK2, the JNK2α2 isoform is capable of phosphorylating itself and downstream substrates, such as c-Jun, without the presence of upstream kinases (14.Pimienta G. Ficarro S.B. Gutierrez G.J. Bhoumik A. Peters E.C. Ronai Z. Pascual J. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 1762-1771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This ability to autophosphorylate can occur in either a cis- (intra-) or trans- (inter-) molecular mechanism. Domain analysis has revealed that JNK2α2 autophosphorylation activity and its ability to translocate to the nucleus is dependent on the alternatively spliced region known as the α-region (15.Cui J. Holgado-Madruga M. Su W. Tsuiki H. Wedegaertner P. Wong A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9913-9920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This 9-amino acid domain (LVKGCVIFQ) is critical for activation, because swapping this domain into the analogous region of the nonconstitutively active isoform, JNK1α2, renders the isoform active (15.Cui J. Holgado-Madruga M. Su W. Tsuiki H. Wedegaertner P. Wong A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9913-9920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Conversely, substitution of the JNK2α2 α-region with the analogous region of JNK1α2 renders JNK2α2 inactive. Despite knowing that the α-region is critical for activation, little is understood about how this region participates in JNK2α2 dimerization and autoactivation. Because JNK2α2 activity enhances tumor formation, it is important to fully understand its mechanism of autophosphorylation and autoactivation. Our present findings demonstrate that JNK2α2 has a unique mechanism of autophosphorylation and autoactivation. We determined that dimerization is dependent on the α-region and occurs independently of phosphorylation. Also, disruption of JNK2α2 dimerization through specific mutations in the α-region resulted in loss of nuclear localization, loss of autophosphorylation, and decreased tumorigenicity. These results illustrate that JNK2α2 is unique from other MAPK proteins because its autophosphorylation/autoactivation is dependent on homodimerization and that this dimerization most likely precedes autophosphorylation. Characterization of the mechanism through which JNK2α2 is constitutively active will be of great value for designing and developing isoform specific inhibitors that could be used to help treat patients with glioblastoma multiforme. Plasmid Construction of JNK2α2 Mutants—The cDNA encoding wild type JNK2α2 was cloned into BamHI/XhoI restriction sites of pcDNA 6A (Invitrogen). Point mutations were created by site-directed mutagenesis according to the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit protocol (Stratagene).

Protein Expression and Purification—pET28 and pGEX constructs were expressed in the BL21(DE3)pLysS Escherichia coli strain (Novagen) and induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. The tagged proteins were purified according to the manufacturer's protocol using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen). Protein was concentrated to 1 mg/ml using Microcon Ultracel YM-10 (Millipore) and stored in 20% glycerol at -80 °C. Gel Filtration—2 mg of purified protein was applied to a 90-ml Sephacryl S-400 (GE Healthcare) gel filtration column equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline. 1-ml fractions were collected in the same buffer, and the protein concentrations were determined by measuring the A280 nm. Relevant fractions were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. A standard curve was generated using the molecular mass gel filtration markers (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—Protein extracts from total cells were harvested as previously described (16.Nitta R.T. Jameson S.A. Kudlow B.A. Conlan L.A. Kennedy B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5360-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). 50 μg of total protein was separated by denaturing electrophoresis. The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting: mouse anti-GFP (catalog number 11814460001; Roche Applied Science), rabbit anti-phosphorylated JNK that recognizes the phosphorylated T-P-Y motif (98F2; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-phosphorylated c-Jun (9261; Cell Signaling Technology), mouse anti-JNK2 (sc-7345; Santa Cruz), mouse anti-actin (MAB1501R; Chemicon), mouse ant-GST (sc-138; Santa Cruz), and mouse anti-FLAG (Sigma; F3165). Immunoprecipitations for 3×FLAG constructs were conducted in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer using 2 μg of mouse anti-FLAG antibody (F3165; Sigma) bound to Gammabind G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). The protein extracts were harvested and immunoblotted as described previously (16.Nitta R.T. Jameson S.A. Kudlow B.A. Conlan L.A. Kennedy B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5360-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The protein levels were quantitated using National Institutes of Health Image J. Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence was performed on formaldehyde-fixed cells as previously described (17.Kennedy B.K. Barbie D.A. Classon M. Dyson N. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2855-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The images were taken using a Leica SP2 AOBS confocal laser scanning microscope. Images that compared protein levels were collected using equal exposure times and processed in a similar fashion. In Vitro Kinase Assay—1 μg of the fusion protein was incubated in 25 μl of the kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm NaVO4, and 25 mm β-glycerophosphate) containing 30 μm ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. The reactions were terminated by adding protein loading buffer and boiling for 5 min (8.Tsuiki H. Tnani M. Okamoto I. Kenyon L.C. Emlet D.R. Holgado-Madruga M. Lanham I.S. Joynes C.J. Vo K.T. Wong A.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 250-255PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactive kinase assays were conducted in a similar manner except 2 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [32P]ATP was added. Western blots were analyzed using anti-phospho-JNK antibody previously described (98F2; Cell Signaling Technology). BS3 Cross-linking Assay—The experiments were carried out with 1 mg of protein (250 nm) in phosphate-buffered saline. A 50 mm stock solution of BS3 (Pierce) was serially diluted, added to each protein sample, and then incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The reactions were terminated by adding protein loading buffer and boiling the samples for 5 min (18.Oliver A.W. Paul A. Boxall K.J. Barrie S.E. Aherne G.W. Garrett M.D. Mittnacht S. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3179-3190Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by staining using Coomassie Blue. The final concentration of BS3 ranged between 30 μm and 5 mm. Retroviral Infections—The retrovirus pMXIH-YPet was generated by subcloning YPet from the pCEP4-YPet plasmid into the pMXIH backbone (19.Nitta R.T. Smith C.L. Kennedy B.K. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e963Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 20.Nguyen A.W. Daugherty P.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Retroviral infections were carried out as previously described except that the Phoenix-Ampho cell lines were used instead of HEK293 cells (16.Nitta R.T. Jameson S.A. Kudlow B.A. Conlan L.A. Kennedy B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5360-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). 36 h after infection of the U87-MG cells, the infected cells were selected by culturing in selective medium containing 500 μg/ml of hygromycin-B for 2 days. Cell Growth Analysis—U87-MG-infected cells were plated in 6-well plates (5.0 × 105 cells/well) and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. The numbers of live cells were counted daily by means of trypan blue exclusion assay. The experiments were done in triplicate, and the results were expressed as the means ± S.D. Soft Agar Assay—U87-MG-infected cells were plated in 6-well plates (3 × 105 cells/well), suspended in DMEM containing 0.3% of agarose and 1% fetal bovine serum, and overlaid onto a bottom layer of solidified 0.7% agarose in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. The presence of colonies was scored after 10 days using Genetools (Syngene). The experiments were done in triplicate, and the results were expressed as the means ± S.D. Bacterially Expressed JNK2α2 Can Autophosphorylate and Autoactivate—We previously have observed strong autophosphorylation and constitutive activation of the JNK2α2 isoform, which is unique from the JNK1 and JNK3 genes (8.Tsuiki H. Tnani M. Okamoto I. Kenyon L.C. Emlet D.R. Holgado-Madruga M. Lanham I.S. Joynes C.J. Vo K.T. Wong A.J. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 250-255PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanism by which JNK2α2 becomes activated would be of significant interest, because it would assist in the creation of inhibitors for the treatment of relevant diseases. Two hallmarks of JNK activity are the dual phosphorylation of the T-P-Y motif and the ability to phosphorylate downstream substrates such as c-Jun. To determine whether bacterially expressed JNK2α2 possesses these two hallmarks of activity, we conducted an in vitro kinase assay with bacterially expressed His-JNK2α2 with GST-c-Jun. We used an anti-active JNK antibody that only recognizes JNK when it is phosphorylated at both Thr183 and Tyr185. This reagent demonstrated that His-JNK2α2 could autophosphorylate itself, in the absence of an upstream kinase, on the T-P-Y motif (Fig. 1A). We verified that the antibody could only recognize a molecule phosphorylated at both sites by generating JNK2α2 mutants that blocked phosphorylation at each individual site (T183A and Y185F) or at both sites (APF). This showed that only the intact wild type (WT) JNK2 could be recognized by this antibody. Consistently, only the dually phosphorylated WT JNK2α2 protein can phosphorylate the GST-c-Jun substrate (Fig. 1A). Because our assay used bacterially expressed protein, we wished to determine its activity relative to JNK2α2 isolated from cells. To compare JNK2α2 activity, we conducted an in vitro kinase assay with GST-c-Jun and either immunoprecipitated 3×FLAG JNK2α2, which was transiently transfected in U87-MG cells, or the bacterially expressed His-JNK2α2. We used an antibody specific for phosphorylated c-Jun to measure the relative JNK2α2 activity. Although there was a greater amount of JNK2α2 in the immunoprecipitation than in 10 ng of fusion protein, Western analysis revealed that the bacterially expressed His-JNK2α2 had a ∼2–3-fold higher level of c-Jun phosphorylation compared with the cellular JNK2α2, suggesting that bacterially expressed JNK2α2 has a specific activity greater than cellular JNK2α2 (Fig. 1B). JNK2α2 Dimerization Is Dependent on the α-Region, but Not Phosphorylation—Some MAPK family members, such as ERK1/2, dimerize to achieve full activation, and typically phosphorylation occurs prior to dimerization (11.Wilsbacher J.L. Juang Y.C. Khokhlatchev A.V. Gallagher E. Binns D. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13175-13182Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 12.Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5347-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). We constructed a series of mutants to dissect the order in which JNK2α2 autoactivates. To determine whether phosphorylation is necessary for dimerization, we generated a kinase dead JNK2α2 mutant, K55R, in which the lysine that is critical for phosphotransfer in the ATP-binding motif was mutated to an arginine (Fig. 2A). In vitro kinase assays using purified recombinant protein confirmed that K55R does not autophosphorylate (Fig. 2B). To directly analyze the importance of the α-region, we used a JNK2α2 chimera (Chimera A) in which the JNK2α2 α-region was exchanged for the α-region from the JNK1α2 isoform, which was previously shown not to possess autophosphorylation activity (15.Cui J. Holgado-Madruga M. Su W. Tsuiki H. Wedegaertner P. Wong A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9913-9920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Consistently, Chimera A showed no autophosphorylation activity in these assays (Fig. 2B). JNK2α2 Dimerization in Vitro—To analyze JNK2α2 dimerization in its native state, we used size exclusion gel filtration chromatography. Previous research has shown that JNK2α2 exists both as a dimer and a monomer (11.Wilsbacher J.L. Juang Y.C. Khokhlatchev A.V. Gallagher E. Binns D. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13175-13182Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Gel filtration of recombinant wild type JNK2α2 resulted in two distinct peaks at 59 and 67 ml (Fig. 2C). To determine which peak contained dimeric or monomeric forms, a standard curve was generated using gel filtration protein markers (Fig. 2E). We determined that the 59-ml fraction contained proteins of ∼110–120 kDa in size, consistent with a JNK2α2 dimer, whereas the 67-ml fraction contained proteins of 50–60 kDa in size, consistent with a JNK2α2 monomer (Fig. 2, C and E). Interestingly, the kinase dead (K55R) mutant revealed two distinct peaks at 59 and 66 ml, and the column profile was similar to the wild type JNK2α2 (Fig. 2C). Application of the APF mutant also yielded a similar profile as WT JNK2α2 (supplemental Fig. S1). These findings suggested that JNK2α2 dimerization is not dependent upon autophosphorylation. Chromatography of Chimera A yielded only one single protein peak at 59 ml, indicating that the α-region is necessary for JNK2α2 to form dimers. To verify the importance of the α-region, we also conducted a cross-linking assay. We used a primary amine reactive cross-linking reagent (BS3) that has been shown to cross-link dimerized protein, allowing the identification of protein dimers (18.Oliver A.W. Paul A. Boxall K.J. Barrie S.E. Aherne G.W. Garrett M.D. Mittnacht S. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3179-3190Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Recombinant wild type JNK2α2 protein was incubated with increasing amounts of the BS3 cross-linker. We found that the lowest concentration of BS3 (30 μm) was sufficient to visualize a 120-kDa JNK2α2 dimer (Fig. 2D). When we extended our studies to Chimera A, we found that a 16-fold higher concentration of BS3 was necessary to visualize the 120-kDa JNK2α2 dimer. The Chimera A dimer is most likely an artifact because a 100-fold molar excess of BS3 was needed to visualize the dimer. In addition, the presence of the 200-kDa band is likely an artifact because of high BS3 concentration resulting in two dimers being cross-linked together. The kinase dead mutant behaved similarly to wild type JNK2α2, verifying that dimerization is phosphorylation-independent (Fig. 2D). Taken together, our findings suggest that the α-region, but not phosphorylation, is necessary for JNK2α2 dimerization. JNK2α2 Dimerization in Vivo—To determine whether the α-region is necessary for JNK2α2 dimerization in vivo, we co-transfected GFP-JNK2α2 and 3×FLAG JNK2α2 in HEK293 cells and performed co-immunoprecipitation assays. We discovered that the two tagged JNK2α2 proteins co-immunoprecipitated, suggesting that JNK2α2 does dimerize in vivo (Fig. 3A). When we extended our studies to 3×FLAG-JNK1α2, 3×FLAG Chimera A, and 3×FLAG Chimera B (a JNK1α2 mutant containing the α-region from JNK2α2; Fig. 2A), we found that only the 3×FLAG WT and 3×FLAG Chimera B could be immunoprecipitated with GFP-JNK2α2 (Fig. 3B; note Chimera B and JNK1α2 migrate similarly). These results suggest that the α-region from JNK2α2 is necessary for dimerization in vivo. The assays were then performed in a glioblastoma cell line, U87-MG. Consistently, we found that the wild type 3×FLAG JNK2α2 could interact with the GFP-JNK2α2, whereas Chimera A did not interact (Fig. 3C). Analysis with Chimera B revealed that 8-fold more GFP-JNK2α2 precipitated than JNK1α2, showing that it is the addition of the α-region from JNK2α2 that enhances the binding of JNK2α2 to JNK1α2. In addition, the 3×FLAG K55R mutant co-immunoprecipitated with GFP-JNK2α2, although it appeared that less 3×FLAG K55R co-immunoprecipitated compared with the 3×FLAG WT, suggesting that phosphorylation may contribute to JNK2α2 dimerization in vivo. However, this apparent decrease was likely due to variations in the immunoprecipitation technique because a duplicate assay revealed similar amounts of precipitated K55R mutant to the WT protein (Fig. 3D). To further show that dimerization does occur independently of phosphorylation, we also analyzed the GFP JNK2α2 APF mutant, which is incapable of being phosphorylated at the T-P-Y motif (Figs. 1A and 3D). We found that the JNK2α2 APF mutant was co-immunoprecipitated at levels similar to the GFP-WT protein, suggesting that phosphorylation does not affect JNK2α2 dimerization (Fig. 3D). Together these findings suggest that although JNK2α2 may form heterodimers with other JNK isoforms in vivo, it is the α-region, and not phosphorylation, which strongly promotes homodimers within cells. Inhibition of JNK2α2 Dimerization Prevents Autophosphorylation—To enhance our understanding of the role that the α-region plays in JNK2α2 activity, we conducted an alanine mutagenesis scan of the α-region (LVKGCVIFQ). Eight of the amino acids were individually mutated to an alanine residue to determine which amino acid(s) are necessary for JNK2α2 autophosphorylation and/or dimerization. We mutated only one valine (Val219) because valine and alanine are structurally very similar. In vitro kinase assays using radioactively labeled [32P]ATP demonstrated that five mutants (L218A, K220A, G221A, I224A, and F225A) could no longer autophosphorylate, whereas only three mutants (V219A, C222A, and Q226A) retained their autophosphorylation activity (Fig. 4A). To determine whether the loss of autophosphorylation activity correlated with an inability to dimerize, we analyzed each mutant using size exclusion chromatography and the aforementioned cross-linking assay. We observed that each autophosphorylation “inactive” mutant (L218A, K220A, G221A, I224A, and F225A) existed mainly as a monomer and required 16–32-fold more BS3 to form the 120-kDa dimer (Fig. 4, B and C). Consistently, the mutants that retained the ability to autophosphorylate (V219A, C222A, and Q226A) existed both as dimers and monomers and required only the lowest concentration of cross-linker to identify the JNK2α2 dimer (Fig. 4, B and C). These findings taken together with the K55R mutant data suggest that JNK2α2 autophosphorylation is dependent on dimerization and that the amino acids Leu218, Lys220, Gly221, Ile224, and Phe225 play an important role in dimerization. Dimerization Is Necessary for JNK2α2 Translocation to the Nucleus—If dimerization is necessary for JNK2α2 autophosphorylation, it may also be important for other components of JNK2α2 activity. One hallmark of JNK2α2 activity is the ability to translocate to the nucleus. To determine whether the autophosphorylation and dimer “inactive” mutants were also deficient in the ability to localize to the nucleus, we transfected GFP-tagged alanine mutants into U87-MG cells. GFP-JNK2α2 WT had a strong nuclear localization signal in which 80% of the GFP-positive cells had nuclear staining, consistent with previous reports (15.Cui J. Holgado-Madruga M. Su W. Tsuiki H. Wedegaertner P. Wong A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9913-9920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Analysis of the alanine mutants revealed that each autophosphorylation/dimerization “inactive” mutant (L218A, K220A, G221A, I224A, and F225A) showed only 20–30% of the GFP-positive cells with a clear nuclear localization, whereas the three autophosphorylation/dimer “active” mutants (V219A, C222A, and Q226A) had 60–70% cells with a strong nuclear staining (Fig. 5, A and B). In addition, analysis of the kinase dead mutant revealed that only 25% of the cells had a strong GFP nuclear localization, demonstrating that phosphorylate"
https://openalex.org/W2129257321,"Population level evolutionary processes can occur within a single organism when the germ line contains a mutation that confers a cost at the level of the cell. Here we describe how multiple compensatory mutations arose through a within-individual evolutionary process in two brothers with the immune deficiency Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS). As a result, both brothers have T lymphocyte populations that are highly polymorphic at the locus of the germ line defect, and no single allele achieves fixation. WASP, the gene product affected in this disease, is specific to white blood cells where it is responsible for regulating actin cytoskeleton dynamics in a wide range of cellular responses. The brothers inherited a rare allele predicted to result in truncated WASP lacking the carboxy-terminal VCA domains, the region that directly catalyzes actin filament generation. Although the brothers' T cell populations are highly polymorphic, all share a corrective effect relative to the inherited allele in that they restore the VCA domain. This indicates massive selection against the truncated germ line allele. No single somatic allele becomes fixed in the circulating T cell population of either brother, indicating that a regulated step in maturation of the affected cell lineage is severely compromised by the germ line allele. Based on the finding of multiple somatic mutations, the known maturation pathway for T-lineage cells and the known defects of T cells and precursor thymocytes in mice with truncated WASP, we hypothesize that the presence of truncated WASP (WASP Delta VCA) confers an extreme disadvantage in early developing thymocytes, above and beyond the known cost of absence of full-length WASP, and that the disadvantage likely occurs through dominant negative competition of WASP Delta VCA with N-WASP, a protein that otherwise partially compensates for WASP absence in developing thymocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2065973208,"Microsatellite instability promotes colonic tumorigenesis through generating frameshift mutations at coding microsatellites of tumor suppressor genes, such as TGFBR2 and ACVR2. As a consequence, signaling through these TGFbeta family receptors is abrogated in DNA Mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient tumors. How these mutations occur in real time and mutational rates of these human coding sequences have not previously been studied. We utilized cell lines with different MMR deficiencies (hMLH1-/-, hMSH6-/-, hMSH3-/-, and MMR-proficient) to determine mutation rates. Plasmids were constructed in which exon 3 of TGFBR2 and exon 10 of ACVR2 were cloned +1 bp out of frame, immediately after the translation initiation codon of an enhanced GFP (EGFP) gene, allowing a -1 bp frameshift mutation to drive EGFP expression. Mutation-resistant plasmids were constructed by interrupting the coding microsatellite sequences, preventing frameshift mutation. Stable cell lines were established containing portions of TGFBR2 and ACVR2, and nonfluorescent cells were sorted, cultured for 7-35 days, and harvested for flow cytometric mutation detection and DNA sequencing at specific time points. DNA sequencing revealed a -1 bp frameshift mutation (A9 in TGFBR2 and A7 in ACVR2) in the fluorescent cells. Two distinct fluorescent populations, M1 (dim, representing heteroduplexes) and M2 (bright, representing full mutants) were identified, with the M2 fraction accumulating over time. hMLH1 deficiency revealed 11 (5.91 x 10(-4)) and 15 (2.18 x 10(-4)) times higher mutation rates for the TGFBR2 and ACVR2 microsatellites compared to hMSH6 deficiency, respectively. The mutation rate of the TGFBR2 microsatellite was approximately 3 times higher in both hMLH1 and hMSH6 deficiencies than the ACVR2 microsatellite. The -1 bp frameshift mutation rates of TGFBR2 and ACVR2 microsatellite sequences are dependent upon the human MMR background."
https://openalex.org/W2094531784,"Human dendritic cells (DCs) are the main antigen presenting cells (APC) and can be divided into two main populations, myeloid and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), the latter being the main producers of Type I Interferon. The vast majority of pDCs can be found in lymphoid organs, where the main pool of all immune cells is located, but a minority of pDCs also circulate in peripheral blood. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) employs multiple mechanisms to evade the immune system. In this study, we could show that pDCs obtained from lymphoid organs (tonsils) (tpDCs) and from blood (bpDCs) are different subpopulations in humans. Interestingly, these populations react in opposite manner to HCMV-infection. TpDCs were fully permissive for HCMV. Their IFN-α production and the expression of costimulatory and adhesion molecules were altered after infection. In contrast, in bpDCs HCMV replication was abrogated and the cells were activated with increased IFN-α production and upregulation of MHC class I, costimulatory, and adhesion molecules. HCMV-infection of both, tpDCs and bpDCs, led to a decreased T cell stimulation, probably mediated through a soluble factor produced by HCMV-infected pDCs. We propose that the HCMV-mediated impairment of tpDCs is a newly discovered mechanism selectively targeting the host's major population of pDCs residing in lymphoid organs."
https://openalex.org/W1511217502,"This work clarifies the relation between network circuit (topology) and behavior (information transmission and synchronization) in active networks, e.g. neural networks. As an application, we show how to determine a network topology that is optimal for information transmission. By optimal, we mean that the network is able to transmit a large amount of information, it possesses a large number of communication channels, and it is robust under large variations of the network coupling configuration. This theoretical approach is general and does not depend on the particular dynamic of the elements forming the network, since the network topology can be determined by finding a Laplacian matrix (the matrix that describes the connections and the coupling strengths among the elements) whose eigenvalues satisfy some special conditions. To illustrate our ideas and theoretical approaches, we use neural networks of electrically connected chaotic Hindmarsh-Rose neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2080401298,"Myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) has been detected in Schwann cells prior to the onset of myelination, suggesting its functions in the initiation of myelination. However, transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of MAG remain to be elucidated. Here, we analyzed the promoter of the MAG gene by using luciferase reporter systems in the primary rat Schwann cells. We identified a novel cis-acting element located 160 bp upstream from the MAG transcription initiation site. Using the identified cis-element as a bait, we performed yeast one-hybrid screening and isolated a cDNA encoding a RNF10 as a putative trans-acting protein. When overexpressed in Schwann cells, RNF10 enhanced the activity of the MAG promoter. When RNF10 expression in Schwann cells was knocked down by siRNA, endogenous MAG mRNA and protein expression decreased. Furthermore, we evaluated myelin synthesis using Schwann cell-DRG neuron cocultures. When Schwann cells were infected with retrovirus expressing RNF10 siRNA, myelin formation was inhibited. These data suggest that RNF10 regulates MAG expression and is required for myelin formation."
https://openalex.org/W1999635042,"Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is associated with adverse cardiovascular prognosis. However, the risk associated with DM may vary between individuals according to their overall cardiovascular risk burden. Therefore, we aimed to determine whether DM is associated with poor outcome in patients presenting with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) according to the index episode being a first or recurrent cardiovascular event.We conducted a retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort study involving 2499 consecutively admitted patients with confirmed ACS in 11 UK hospitals during 2003. Usual care was provided for all participants. Demographic factors, co-morbidity and treatment (during admission and at discharge) factors were recorded. The primary outcome was all cause mortality (median 2 year follow up), compared for cohorts with and without DM according to their prior cardiovascular disease (CVD) disease status. Adjusted analyses were performed with Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Within the entire cohort, DM was associated with an unadjusted 45% increase in mortality. However, in patients free of a history of CVD, mortality of those with and without DM was similar (18.8% and 19.7% respectively; p = 0.74). In the group with CVD, mortality of patients with DM was significantly higher than those without DM (46.7% and 33.2% respectively; p<0.001). The age and sex adjusted interaction between DM and CVD in predicting mortality was highly significant (p = 0.002) and persisted after accounting for comorbidities and treatment factors (p = 0.006). Of patients free of CVD, DM was associated with smaller elevation of Troponin I (p<0.001). However in patients with pre-existing CVD Troponin I was similar (p = 0.992).DM is only associated with worse outcome after ACS in patients with a pre-existing history of CVD. Differences in the severity of myocyte necrosis may account for this. Further investigation is required, though our findings suggest that aggressive primary prevention of CVD in patients with DM may have beneficially modified their first presentation with (and mortality after) ACS."
https://openalex.org/W2042919980,"We consider the concerted evolution of viral genomes in four families of DNA viruses. Given the high rate of horizontal gene transfer among viruses and their hosts, it is an open question as to how representative particular genes are of the evolutionary history of the complete genome. To address the concerted evolution of viral genes, we compared genomic evolution across four distinct, extant viral families. For all four viral families we constructed DNA-dependent DNA polymerase-based (DdDp) phylogenies and in addition, whole genome sequence, as quantitative descriptions of inter-genome relationships. We found that the history of the polymerase gene was highly predictive of the history of the genome as a whole, which we explain in terms of repeated, co-divergence events of the core DdDp gene accompanied by a number of satellite, accessory genetic loci. We also found that the rate of gene gain in baculovirus and poxviruses proceeds significantly more quickly than the rate of gene loss and that there is convergent acquisition of satellite functions promoting contextual adaptation when distinct viral families infect related hosts. The congruence of the genome and polymerase trees suggests that a large set of viral genes, including polymerase, derive from a phylogenetically conserved core of genes of host origin, secondarily reinforced by gene acquisition from common hosts or co-infecting viruses within the host. A single viral genome can be thought of as a mutualistic network, with the core genes acting as an effective host and the satellite genes as effective symbionts. Larger virus genomes show a greater departure from linkage equilibrium between core and satellites functions."
https://openalex.org/W1997124600,"Background Research of RNA viability markers was previously studied for many bacterial species. Few and different targets of each species have been checked and motley results can be found in literature. No research has been done about Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this way. Methodology/Principal Findings Disappearance of 48 transcripts was analyzed by two-steps reverse transcription and real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) after heat-killing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa previously stored in mineral water or not. Differential results were obtained for each target. 16S rRNA, 23S rRNA, groEL, and rpmE were showed as the most persistent transcripts and rplP, rplV, rplE and rpsD were showed as the most labile transcripts after P. aeruginosa death. However, the labile targets appeared more persistent in bacteria previously stored in mineral water than freshly cultivated (non stored). These nine transcripts were also analyzed in Escherichia coli after heat-killing and different to opposite results were obtained, notably for groEL which was the most labile transcript of E. coli. Moreover, opposite results were obtained between mineral water stored and freshly cultivated E. coli. Conclusions and Significance This study highlights four potential viability markers for P. aeruginosa and four highly persistent transcripts. In a near future, these targets could be associated to develop an efficient viability kit. The present study also suggests that it would be difficult to determine universal RNA viability markers for environmental bacteria, since opposite results were obtained depending on the bacterial species and the physiological conditions."

However, the CTL response is highly adaptable and the long-term consequences of viral escape are not fully understood. The objective of this study was to address the question “to what extent does HIV-1 escape from CTL contribute to HLA-associated AIDS progression?” We combined an analysis of 21 escape events in longitudinally-studied HIV-1 infected people with a population-level analysis of the functional CTL response in 150 subjects (by IFNg ELISpot) and an analysis of the HIV-1 sequence database to quantify the contribution of escape to the HLA-associated rate of AIDS progression. We found that CTL responses restricted by protective HLA class I alleles, which are associated with slow progression to AIDS, recognised epitopes where escape variants had a weak evolutionary selective advantage (P = 0.008) and occurred infrequently (P = 0.017). Epitopes presented by protective HLA class I alleles were more likely to elicit a CTL response (P = 0.001) and less likely to contain sequence variation (P = 0.006). A third of between-individual variation in HLA-associated disease risk was predicted by the selective advantage of escape variants: a doubling in the evolutionary selective advantage was associated with a decrease in the AIDS-free period of 1.2 yrs. These results contribute to our understanding of what makes a CTL response protective and why some individuals progress to AIDS more rapidly than others."
https://openalex.org/W2009083108,"A simple statistical method is described to test whether data are consistent with minimum statistical variability expected in a biological experiment. The method is applied to data presented in data tables in a subset of 84 articles among more than 200 published by 3 investigators in a small medical biochemistry department at a major university in India and to 29 ""control"" articles selected by key word PubMed searches. Major conclusions include: 1) unusual clustering of coefficients of variation (CVs) was observed for data from the majority of articles analyzed that were published by the 3 investigators from 2000-2007; unusual clustering was not observed for data from any of their articles examined that were published between 1992 and 1999; and 2) among a group of 29 control articles retrieved by PubMed key word, title, or title/abstract searches, unusually clustered CVs were observed in 3 articles. Two of these articles were coauthored by 1 of the 3 investigators, and 1 was from the same university but a different department. We are unable to offer a statistical or biological explanation for the unusual clustering observed."
https://openalex.org/W2005518471,"It is well established that paracrine secretion of anti-viral CCR5 ligands by CD8+ and CD4+ T cells can block the infection of activated CD4+ T cells by R5 and dual-tropic isolates of HIV-1. By contrast, because CD4+ T cells can be infected by HIV-1 and at least some subsets secrete anti-viral CCR5 ligands, it is possible that these ligands protect against HIV-1 via autocrine as well as paracrine pathways. Here we use a model primary CD4+ T cell response in vitro to show that individual CD4+ T cells that secrete anti-viral CCR5 ligands are ‘self-protected’ against infection with R5 but not X4 strains of HIV-1. This protection is selective for CD4+ T cells that secrete anti-viral CCR5 ligands in that activated CD4+ T cells in the same cultures remain infectable with R5 HIV-1. These data are most consistent with an autocrine pathway of protection in this system and indicate a previously unappreciated selective pressure on the emergence of viral variants and CD4+ T cell phenotypes during HIV-1 infection."
https://openalex.org/W2069734209,"The mechanism by which protein-coding portions of eukaryotic genes came to be separated by long non-coding stretches of DNA, and the purpose for this perplexing arrangement, have remained unresolved fundamental biological problems for three decades. We report here a plausible solution to this problem based on analysis of open reading frame (ORF) length constraints in the genomes of nine diverse species. If primordial nucleic acid sequences were random in sequence, functional proteins that are innately long would not be encoded due to the frequent occurrence of stop codons. The best possible way that a long protein-coding sequence could have been derived was by evolving a split-structure from the random DNA (or RNA) sequence. Results of the systematic analyses of nine complete genome sequences presented here suggests that perhaps the major underlying structural features of split-genes have evolved due to the indigenous occurrence of split protein-coding genes in primordial random nucleotide sequence. The results also suggest that intron-rich genes containing short exons may have been the original form of genes intrinsically occurring in random DNA, and that intron-poor genes containing long exons were perhaps derived from the original intron-rich genes."
https://openalex.org/W1988836048,"To describe the changes in HIV services provided and the patient population utilizing voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) services at private testing laboratories in Chennai, India in 2001 and 2006.In 2001, a cross-sectional descriptive survey was conducted to assess the services provided and client population of 1,031 private laboratories. A subset of labs (9%) that had been surveyed in 2001 were also studied in 2006.In 2001, significantly more high volume labs (>10 HIV tests per month) offered HIV diagnostic tests than low volume labs (<10 HIV test per month) (p<0.001). More high volume labs (20.0%) provided pre-test counseling as part of HIV testing than low volume labs (11.1%) (p = 0.003). Between 2001 and 2006, the number of labs that provided HIV diagnostic tests significantly increased, including ELISA (87.8% vs. 40.0%), Western Blot (84.4% vs. 13.3%), and Tridot (98.9% vs. 72.2%) (p<0.001). Also the number of labs that reported greater than 10 women seeking HIV testing per month significantly increased from 14.5% to 79.0% (p = 0.006). More labs provided pre-test counseling in 2006 (34.4%) than in 2001 (21.1%) (p = 0.046).Though HIV diagnostic testing services have increasingly become available, counseling services have not expanded commensurately. Further outreach and education is necessary to expand comprehensive HIV VCT services in both urban and rural India."
