https://openalex.org/W2071849521,"The ability to sequence genomes has far outstripped approaches for deciphering the information they encode. Here we present a suite of techniques, based on ribosome profiling (the deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments), to provide genome-wide maps of protein synthesis as well as a pulse-chase strategy for determining rates of translation elongation. We exploit the propensity of harringtonine to cause ribosomes to accumulate at sites of translation initiation together with a machine learning algorithm to define protein products systematically. Analysis of translation in mouse embryonic stem cells reveals thousands of strong pause sites and unannotated translation products. These include amino-terminal extensions and truncations and upstream open reading frames with regulatory potential, initiated at both AUG and non-AUG codons, whose translation changes after differentiation. We also define a class of short, polycistronic ribosome-associated coding RNAs (sprcRNAs) that encode small proteins. Our studies reveal an unanticipated complexity to mammalian proteomes."
https://openalex.org/W2130128490,"Human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are a promising source of cells for applications in regenerative medicine. Directed differentiation of PSCs into specialized cells such as spinal motoneurons or midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons has been achieved. However, the effective use of PSCs for cell therapy has lagged behind. Whereas mouse PSC-derived DA neurons have shown efficacy in models of Parkinson's disease, DA neurons from human PSCs generally show poor in vivo performance. There are also considerable safety concerns for PSCs related to their potential for teratoma formation or neural overgrowth. Here we present a novel floor-plate-based strategy for the derivation of human DA neurons that efficiently engraft in vivo, suggesting that past failures were due to incomplete specification rather than a specific vulnerability of the cells. Midbrain floor-plate precursors are derived from PSCs 11 days after exposure to small molecule activators of sonic hedgehog (SHH) and canonical WNT signalling. Engraftable midbrain DA neurons are obtained by day 25 and can be maintained in vitro for several months. Extensive molecular profiling, biochemical and electrophysiological data define developmental progression and confirm identity of PSC-derived midbrain DA neurons. In vivo survival and function is demonstrated in Parkinson's disease models using three host species. Long-term engraftment in 6-hydroxy-dopamine-lesioned mice and rats demonstrates robust survival of midbrain DA neurons derived from human embryonic stem (ES) cells, complete restoration of amphetamine-induced rotation behaviour and improvements in tests of forelimb use and akinesia. Finally, scalability is demonstrated by transplantation into parkinsonian monkeys. Excellent DA neuron survival, function and lack of neural overgrowth in the three animal models indicate promise for the development of cell-based therapies in Parkinson's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2106204137,"The embryonic pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) isoform is highly expressed in human cancer. In contrast to the established role of PKM2 in aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect, its non-metabolic functions remain elusive. Here we demonstrate, in human cancer cells, that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation induces translocation of PKM2, but not PKM1, into the nucleus, where K433 of PKM2 binds to c-Src-phosphorylated Y333 of β-catenin. This interaction is required for both proteins to be recruited to the CCND1 promoter, leading to HDAC3 removal from the promoter, histone H3 acetylation and cyclin D1 expression. PKM2-dependent β-catenin transactivation is instrumental in EGFR-promoted tumour cell proliferation and brain tumour development. In addition, positive correlations have been identified between c-Src activity, β-catenin Y333 phosphorylation and PKM2 nuclear accumulation in human glioblastoma specimens. Furthermore, levels of β-catenin phosphorylation and nuclear PKM2 have been correlated with grades of glioma malignancy and prognosis. These findings reveal that EGF induces β-catenin transactivation via a mechanism distinct from that induced by Wnt/Wingless and highlight the essential non-metabolic functions of PKM2 in EGFR-promoted β-catenin transactivation, cell proliferation and tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2094334461,"Pigeonpea is an important protein source in many developing countries, but limited genetic resources have constrained its improvement. The draft genome sequence of pigeonpea, the first for a nonindustrial crop and for a grain legume, should facilitate molecular breeding efforts to improve yields for subsistence farmers. Pigeonpea is an important legume food crop grown primarily by smallholder farmers in many semi-arid tropical regions of the world. We used the Illumina next-generation sequencing platform to generate 237.2 Gb of sequence, which along with Sanger-based bacterial artificial chromosome end sequences and a genetic map, we assembled into scaffolds representing 72.7% (605.78 Mb) of the 833.07 Mb pigeonpea genome. Genome analysis predicted 48,680 genes for pigeonpea and also showed the potential role that certain gene families, for example, drought tolerance–related genes, have played throughout the domestication of pigeonpea and the evolution of its ancestors. Although we found a few segmental duplication events, we did not observe the recent genome-wide duplication events observed in soybean. This reference genome sequence will facilitate the identification of the genetic basis of agronomically important traits, and accelerate the development of improved pigeonpea varieties that could improve food security in many developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W1975705143,"David van Heel, Cisca Wijmenga and colleagues used a custom, high-density genotyping chip to examine 183 immune-related loci for their role in celiac disease. They report 13 new regions associated with celiac disease risk, identify multiple independent signals at several loci and refine the localization of many previously reported risk signals. Using variants from the 1000 Genomes Project pilot European CEU dataset and data from additional resequencing studies, we densely genotyped 183 non-HLA risk loci previously associated with immune-mediated diseases in 12,041 individuals with celiac disease (cases) and 12,228 controls. We identified 13 new celiac disease risk loci reaching genome-wide significance, bringing the number of known loci (including the HLA locus) to 40. We found multiple independent association signals at over one-third of these loci, a finding that is attributable to a combination of common, low-frequency and rare genetic variants. Compared to previously available data such as those from HapMap3, our dense genotyping in a large sample collection provided a higher resolution of the pattern of linkage disequilibrium and suggested localization of many signals to finer scale regions. In particular, 29 of the 54 fine-mapped signals seemed to be localized to single genes and, in some instances, to gene regulatory elements. Altogether, we define the complex genetic architecture of the risk regions of and refine the risk signals for celiac disease, providing the next step toward uncovering the causal mechanisms of the disease."

https://openalex.org/W2105989397,"A formidable challenge in neural repair in the adult central nervous system (CNS) is the long distances that regenerating axons often need to travel in order to reconnect with their targets. Thus, a sustained capacity for axon regeneration is critical for achieving functional restoration. Although deletion of either phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), a negative regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), or suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3), a negative regulator of Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway, in adult retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) individually promoted significant optic nerve regeneration, such regrowth tapered off around 2 weeks after the crush injury. Here we show that, remarkably, simultaneous deletion of both PTEN and SOCS3 enables robust and sustained axon regeneration. We further show that PTEN and SOCS3 regulate two independent pathways that act synergistically to promote enhanced axon regeneration. Gene expression analyses suggest that double deletion not only results in the induction of many growth-related genes, but also allows RGCs to maintain the expression of a repertoire of genes at the physiological level after injury. Our results reveal concurrent activation of mTOR and STAT3 pathways as key for sustaining long-distance axon regeneration in adult CNS, a crucial step towards functional recovery."
https://openalex.org/W2027496182,"Permafrost soil in the Arctic contains a huge reservoir of carbon. If the climate warms and the permafrost thaws, this carbon would become accessible to microbial degradation, releasing greenhouse gases in the process. The microbes responsible for this process are largely unknown. Metagenomic analysis of DNA isolated from two permafrost soils collected in Alaska reveals a rapid microbial response to thawing, with many functional gene abundances increasing. A draft genome of a novel methanogen was constructed from the sequence data. This study highlights the importance of rapid cycling of methane and nitrogen in thawing permafrost. Permafrost contains an estimated 1672 Pg carbon (C), an amount roughly equivalent to the total currently contained within land plants and the atmosphere1,2,3. This reservoir of C is vulnerable to decomposition as rising global temperatures cause the permafrost to thaw2. During thaw, trapped organic matter may become more accessible for microbial degradation and result in greenhouse gas emissions4,5. Despite recent advances in the use of molecular tools to study permafrost microbial communities6,7,8,9, their response to thaw remains unclear. Here we use deep metagenomic sequencing to determine the impact of thaw on microbial phylogenetic and functional genes, and relate these data to measurements of methane emissions. Metagenomics, the direct sequencing of DNA from the environment, allows the examination of whole biochemical pathways and associated processes, as opposed to individual pieces of the metabolic puzzle. Our metagenome analyses reveal that during transition from a frozen to a thawed state there are rapid shifts in many microbial, phylogenetic and functional gene abundances and pathways. After one week of incubation at 5 °C, permafrost metagenomes converge to be more similar to each other than while they are frozen. We find that multiple genes involved in cycling of C and nitrogen shift rapidly during thaw. We also construct the first draft genome from a complex soil metagenome, which corresponds to a novel methanogen. Methane previously accumulated in permafrost is released during thaw and subsequently consumed by methanotrophic bacteria. Together these data point towards the importance of rapid cycling of methane and nitrogen in thawing permafrost."

We report somatic heterozygous mutations in IDH1 (c.394C>T encoding an R132C substitution and c.395G>A encoding an R132H substitution) or IDH2 (c.516G>C encoding R172S) in 87% of enchondromas (benign cartilage tumors) and in 70% of spindle cell hemangiomas (benign vascular lesions). In total, 35 of 43 (81%) subjects with Ollier disease and 10 of 13 (77%) with Maffucci syndrome carried IDH1 (98%) or IDH2 (2%) mutations in their tumors. Fourteen of 16 subjects had identical mutations in separate lesions. Immunohistochemistry to detect mutant IDH1 R132H protein suggested intraneoplastic and somatic mosaicism. IDH1 mutations in cartilage tumors were associated with hypermethylation and downregulated expression of several genes. Mutations were also found in 40% of solitary central cartilaginous tumors and in four chondrosarcoma cell lines, which will enable functional studies to assess the role of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in tumor formation."
https://openalex.org/W1988783376,"Nodal and Activin belong to the TGF-β superfamily and are important regulators of embryonic stem cell fate. Here we investigated whether Nodal and Activin regulate self-renewal of pancreatic cancer stem cells. Nodal and Activin were hardly detectable in more differentiated pancreatic cancer cells, while cancer stem cells and stroma-derived pancreatic stellate cells markedly overexpressed Nodal and Activin, but not TGF-β. Knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of the Nodal/Activin receptor Alk4/7 in cancer stem cells virtually abrogated their self-renewal capacity and in vivo tumorigenicity, and reversed the resistance of orthotopically engrafted cancer stem cells to gemcitabine. However, engrafted primary human pancreatic cancer tissue with a substantial stroma showed no response due to limited drug delivery. The addition of a stroma-targeting hedgehog pathway inhibitor enhanced delivery of the Nodal/Activin inhibitor and translated into long-term, progression-free survival. Therefore, inhibition of the Alk4/7 pathway, if combined with hedgehog pathway inhibition and gemcitabine, provides a therapeutic strategy for targeting cancer stem cells."

https://openalex.org/W2044073319,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are believed to have fundamental roles in tumorigenesis and have great potential for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. However, the roles of miRNAs in hepatocellular carcinogenesis are still not fully elucidated. We investigated the aberrantly expressed miRNAs involved in hepatoma by comparison of miRNA expression profiles in cancerous hepatocytes with normal primary human hepatocytes, and 37 dysregulated miRNAs were screened out by twofold change with a significant difference (P<0.05). Clustering analysis based on 13 miRNAs with changes over 15-folds showed that the miRNA expression patterns between the cancerous and normal hepatocytes were clearly different. Among the 13 miRNAs, we found that miR-375 was significantly downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-375 in liver cancer cells decreased cell proliferation, clonogenicity, migration/invasion and also induced G1 arrest and apoptosis. To unveil the molecular mechanism of miR-375-mediated phenotype in hepatoma cells described above, we examined the putative targets using bioinformatics tools and found that astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) was a potential target of miR-375. Then we demonstrated that miR-375 bound directly to the 3′-untranslated region of AEG-1 and inhibited the expression of AEG-1. TaqMan quantitative reverse transcriptase–PCR and western blot analysis showed that miR-375 expression was inversely correlated with AEG-1 expression in HCC tissues. Knockdown of AEG-1 by RNAi in HCC cells, similar to miR-375 overexpression, suppressed tumor properties. Ectopic expression of AEG-1, conversely, could partially reverse the antitumor effects of miR-375. In a mouse model, therapeutic administration of cholesterol-conjugated 2′-O-methyl-modified miR-375 mimics (Chol-miR-375) could significantly suppress the growth of hepatoma xenografts in nude mice. In conclusion, our findings indicate that miR-375 targets AEG-1 in HCC and suppresses liver cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo, and highlight the therapeutic potential of miR-375 in HCC treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2070734183,"Cardiomyocyte remodeling, which includes partial dedifferentiation of cardiomyocytes, is a process that occurs during both acute and chronic disease processes. Here, we demonstrate that oncostatin M (OSM) is a major mediator of cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation and remodeling during acute myocardial infarction (MI) and in chronic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Patients suffering from DCM show a strong and lasting increase of OSM expression and signaling. OSM treatment induces dedifferentiation of cardiomyocytes and upregulation of stem cell markers and improves cardiac function after MI. Conversely, inhibition of OSM signaling suppresses cardiomyocyte remodeling after MI and in a mouse model of DCM, resulting in deterioration of heart function after MI but improvement of cardiac performance in DCM. We postulate that dedifferentiation of cardiomyocytes initially protects stressed hearts but fails to support cardiac structure and function upon continued activation. Manipulation of OSM signaling provides a means to control the differentiation state of cardiomyocytes and cellular plasticity."

By tracking a circuit's output in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in real time, we precisely control its behavior using an in silico feedback algorithm to compute regulatory inputs implemented through a genetically encoded light-responsive module. Moving control functions outside the cell should enable more sophisticated manipulation of cellular processes whenever real-time measurements of cellular variables are possible."
https://openalex.org/W2011217149,"Gene signatures derived from cancer stem cells (CSCs) predict tumor recurrence for many forms of cancer. Here, we derived a gene signature for colorectal CSCs defined by high Wnt signaling activity, which in agreement with previous observations predicts poor prognosis. Surprisingly, however, we found that elevated expression of Wnt targets was actually associated with good prognosis, while patient tumors with low expression of Wnt target genes segregated with immature stem cell signatures. We discovered that several Wnt target genes, including ASCL2 and LGR5, become silenced by CpG island methylation during progression of tumorigenesis, and that their re-expression was associated with reduced tumor growth. Taken together, our data show that promoter methylation of Wnt target genes is a strong predictor for recurrence of colorectal cancer, and suggest that CSC gene signatures, rather than reflecting CSC numbers, may reflect differentiation status of the malignant tissue.

Wnt target genes, including stem cell markers, inversely correlate with prognosis Progression of CRC is associated with methylation of Wnt target genes Adherence to CSC signatures reflects an immature clonal trait, not CSC numbers Wnt target methylation is a strong prognostic marker Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major contributor to cancer-related death. Although patients with local disease (stage I and II) have a favorable prognosis, a small fraction of these patients will inevitably develop a recurrence after intentionally curative surgery (Edge and Compton, 2010Edge S.B.

Oncol. 2010; 17: 1471-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (5589) Google Scholar). Identifying these poor-prognosis patients will allow optimized selection of individuals that would benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Exciting new insights in tumor biology might facilitate this selection; of particular interest in this respect is the recent discovery of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in CRC, a subset of cells that are defined by their capacity to transplant the human malignancy to immuno-compromised mice (O'Brien et al., 2007O'Brien C.A.

CSCs share many features with normal intestinal stem cells (ISCs) (Medema and Vermeulen, 2011Medema J.P. Vermeulen L. Microenvironmental regulation of stem cells in intestinal homeostasis and cancer.Nature. 2011; 474: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), and can be identified based on cell surface markers, such as CD133 (Todaro et al., 2007Todaro M.

De Sousa E Melo F. van der Heijden M. Cameron K. de Jong J.H. Borovski T. Tuynman J.B. Todaro M. Merz C. Rodermond H. et al.Wnt activity defines colon cancer stem cells and is regulated by the microenvironment.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). Importantly, CSCs are suggested to fuel tumor growth and as such are hypothesized to cause tumor recurrence and metastasis. Accordingly, recent reports address the relation between stem cells, CSCs, and patient prognosis in different malignancies, including CRC (Liu et al., 2007Liu R. Wang X. Chen G.Y. Dalerba P. Gurney A. Hoey T. Sherlock G. Lewicki J. Shedden K. Clarke M.F. The prognostic role of a gene signature from tumorigenic breast-cancer cells.N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 356: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). For example, in a recent study by Merlos-Suárez et al., 2011Merlos-Suárez A. Barriga F.M. Jung P. Iglesias M. Céspedes M.V. Rossell D. Sevillano M. Hernando-Momblona X. da Silva-Diz V. Muñoz P. et al.The intestinal stem cell signature identifies colorectal cancer stem cells and predicts disease relapse.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 511-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar a mouse ISC signature has been derived by identifying genes that are highly expressed in EphB2high ISCs compared with that of the more differentiated epithelial cells. This profile encompasses known ISC markers, such as the Wnt target gene LGR5, and is strongly associated with both CRC disease stage and the occurrence of tumor relapse and metastasis formation. This has led to the suggestion that an increased number of CSCs is predictive for prognosis. Here we show that CSC-derived gene signatures can indeed predict tumor recurrence. However, the positive association is not due to expression of specific CSC and CSC-associated Wnt target genes, which rather inversely correlate with prognosis. The subset of patients identified in this manner display decreased expression of a wide range of ISC/Wnt target genes. This is not due to decreased Wnt pathway activity, but is a result of selective promoter methylation. Moreover, Wnt target methylation levels, by themselves, can be used to effectively identify patients at risk of recurrence, and re-expression of these methylated genes lowers tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Previously we have shown that colon-CSCs can be identified in primary human CRC using Wnt signaling intensity levels and can be isolated by employing a Wnt reporter construct (TOP-GFP, Figure 1A ) (Vermeulen et al., 2010Vermeulen L. De Sousa E Melo F. van der Heijden M. Cameron K. de Jong J.H. Borovski T. Tuynman J.B. Todaro M. Merz C. Rodermond H. et al.Wnt activity defines colon cancer stem cells and is regulated by the microenvironment.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). Gene expression profiling of the TOP-GFPhigh human colon-CSCs indicated high expression of the stem cell marker LGR5, as well as several other Wnt targets (APCDD1, LEF1), while typical intestinal differentiation markers (e.g., MUC2 and FABP1) displayed low expression (Figure 1A). Based on two primary isolated spheroid cultures, we generated a colon-CSC signature comprising 187 genes most differentially expressed between the CSCs and the more differentiated cells (Table S1A, available online). This profile was subsequently validated in several independent freshly isolated CRCs (Figure S1A, available online). Crucially, by employing gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et al., 2005Subramanian A. Tamayo P. Mootha V.K. Mukherjee S. Ebert B.L. Gillette M.A. Paulovich A. Pomeroy S.L. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Mesirov J.P. Gene set enrichment analysis: a knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 15545-15550Crossref PubMed Scopus (21567) Google Scholar), we found that this colon-CSC gene expression signature was intimately associated with disease recurrence in a set of 90 stage II CRC patients that underwent intentionally curative surgery at our institute (AMC-AJCCII-90, see Table S1B for patient characteristics), a finding we confirmed in an unrelated, publically available data set (Figure 1B and Figure S1B). Similar results were obtained using two independent ISC profiles that have previously been shown to relate to disease recurrence, lending strength to the validity of both the CSC signature and our patient set (Figure 1B and Figure S1B) (Merlos-Suárez et al., 2011Merlos-Suárez A. Barriga F.M. Jung P. Iglesias M. Céspedes M.V. Rossell D. Sevillano M. Hernando-Momblona X. da Silva-Diz V. Muñoz P. et al.The intestinal stem cell signature identifies colorectal cancer stem cells and predicts disease relapse.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 511-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Using a simple rank-sum approach, we stratified the AMC-AJCCII-90 patients into two groups, which further established the prognostic power of the CSC profile because it revealed that especially early relapses in stage II CRC patients were characterized by a strong resemblance to the CSC signature (Figure 1C, see Experimental Procedures for details). Importantly, however, the nature and biological implication of this correlation remain unclear. In an attempt to analyze the biological mechanism behind the prognostic power of CSC profiles in more depth and to identify genes that are most predictive regarding tumor relapse and metastasis formation, we employed a cluster analysis. Unsupervised K-means clustering of the AMC-AJCCII-90 set using the TOP-GFPhigh/CSC-derived gene expression profile resulted in two distinct patient groups with a significant difference in relapse-free survival, as the Kaplan-Meier curve illustrates (Figure 1D). Gene tree analysis revealed that segregation of these two clusters is accompanied by generation of two major subgroups of genes. The majority of genes were upregulated in the patient cluster that was associated with poor prognosis (blue). However, a clearly distinct subset of genes, at the bottom region of the gene tree, inversely correlated with disease relapse (Figure 1D). To our surprise this gene cluster contained many well-known Wnt target genes of which the expression is intimately linked to ISCs and CSCs. (For a list of genes and their differential expression between the clusters, see Tables S1C and S1D). Similar results were obtained by employing different stem cell signatures, including the LGR5− and EphB2 ISC signatures that have been described previously (Figures S1C and S1D) (Merlos-Suárez et al., 2011Merlos-Suárez A. Barriga F.M. Jung P. Iglesias M. Céspedes M.V. Rossell D. Sevillano M. Hernando-Momblona X. da Silva-Diz V. Muñoz P. et al.The intestinal stem cell signature identifies colorectal cancer stem cells and predicts disease relapse.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 511-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). In all cases high expression of the Wnt-driven ISC marker genes present in the different signatures, like ASCL2, LGR5, AXIN2, and APCDD1, were associated with the favorable prognosis cluster (Figure 1D and Figure S1C and S1D). We confirmed the expression level differences between the two groups by qPCR (Figure S1E) and found that expression was not related to oncogenic mutations present within the different patients (Figure S2A). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated the profile to be an independent prognostic factor that was much more predictive than the presence of different mutations (Figure S2A). Strikingly, we also observed that the expression of Wnt target genes was not a simple reflection of patient-to-patient variation in Wnt signaling activity as measured by nuclear localized β-catenin levels (Figure 1F). Intrigued by this counterintuitive finding, which indicates that high Wnt target gene expression is linked to favorable rather than poor prognosis, we repeated this analysis with a more defined set of Wnt target genes, previously identified by overexpression of dominant-negative TCF4 (dnTCF4) in CRC cell lines (van de Wetering et al., 2002van de Wetering M. Sancho E. Verweij C. de Lau W. Oving I. Hurlstone A. van der Horn K. Batlle E. Coudreuse D.

The clear majority of genes in this dnTCF4 signature are also markedly lower expressed in the poor-prognosis patient cluster (Figure 1E). Even single Wnt target genes, including the validated ISC markers EPHB2 (Merlos-Suárez et al., 2011Merlos-Suárez A. Barriga F.M. Jung P. Iglesias M. Céspedes M.V. Rossell D. Sevillano M.

Muñoz P. et al.The intestinal stem cell signature identifies colorectal cancer stem cells and predicts disease relapse.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 511-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), LGR5 (Barker et al., 2007Barker N. van Es J.H. Kuipers J. Kujala P. van den Born M. Cozijnsen M. Haegebarth A. Korving J. Begthel H. Peters P.J. Clevers H. Identification of stem cells in small intestine and colon by marker gene Lgr5.Nature. 2007; 449: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (3601) Google Scholar), and ASCL2 (van der Flier et al., 2009van der Flier L.G. van Gijn M.E.

The finding that high expression of genes intimately associated with the CSC phenotype is associated with good prognosis in CRC immediately challenges the conventional interpretation as to why (cancer-) stem-cell-associated profiles define poor prognosis in cancer. Mostly it is believed that association with a CSC profile reflects the number of CSC-like cells in the malignancy. However, when we use FACS staining to define the fraction of cells positive for CD133 in several freshly isolated colon cancer specimens, which so far is the best studied and validated means to identify colon-CSCs, we could not correlate the number of CSCs to the overall expression of CSC-associated Wnt target genes within these tumors (Figure S2C). In addition, the fraction of CRC cells positive for nuclear β-catenin, which has been used before as a trait to identify colon-CSCs, also does not correlate significantly with Wnt target gene expression in our patient data set (Figure S2D). These findings both indicate that CSC numbers in CRC are not causal determinants in the patient stratification obtained with the CSC-associated expression signature. More importantly, the lack of correlation between nuclear β-catenin levels and Wnt target gene expression indicates that additional regulatory mechanisms are in place to regulate Wnt target gene expression. In order to better understand why CSC-associated Wnt targets are inversely correlated with prognosis, we determined the expression of five Wnt target genes at multiple stages during the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. As expected, comparison of normal tissue with adenoma tissue revealed a marked increase in expression of most Wnt target genes, in line with the notion that activation of the Wnt cascade is the initiating event in CRC development (Figure 2A ) (Morin et al., 1997Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Activation of beta-catenin-Tcf signaling in colon cancer by mutations in beta-catenin or APC.Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar). It is well accepted that further genetic and epigenetic alterations in the premalignant adenoma tissue mark the transition to an invasively growing CRC (Fearon and Vogelstein, 1990Fearon E.R. Vogelstein B. A genetic model for colorectal tumorigenesis.Cell. 1990; 61: 759-767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9676) Google Scholar). However, evaluation of Wnt target gene expression in CRC samples strikingly indicated a downregulation in the majority of patients compared with the adenoma stage (Figure 2A). This was also observed in an independent data set containing normal, adenoma, and carcinoma samples (Figures S3A and S3B). The relevance of this suppressed Wnt target gene expression was immediately evident: patients that developed a tumor relapse displayed the lowest expression levels (Figure 2A, red triangles). This confirms our findings that a low Wnt target gene expression profile is related to poor prognosis. In addition, we obtained evidence that CRC tissue characterized by a low Wnt target expression signature demonstrates other characteristics of advanced disease as well. In this respect we analyzed the association of the patients in the Wnt target-low cluster with immature stem cell signatures (based on SOX2, OCT4, and Nanog targets), which have been used previously to determine disease grade and prognosis in cancer patients (Figure S3C) (Ben-Porath et al., 2008Ben-Porath I. Thomson M.W. Carey V.J. Ge R. Bell G.W. Regev A. Weinberg R.A. An embryonic stem cell-like gene expression signature in poorly differentiated aggressive human tumors.Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1835) Google Scholar). GSEA showed a clear correlation between the Wnt target-low cluster and these signatures (Figure S3D). This correlation was not detected when a direct comparison was made between the expression of pluripotency genes in the Wnt target high clusters with that of low clusters (Figure S3D), but the association with immature stem cell signatures does suggest that segregation based on the CSC signature reflects a more immature trait of the malignant tissue in the poor-prognosis cluster. In agreement, the association of the Wnt target-low cluster with this molecular immature fingerprint is also reflected by a significant enrichment for tumors presenting with a poorly differentiated histology (Figure 2B). Although the above indicates that the tumors that cluster in the Wnt-low group have a more immature phenotype, this does not provide insight into the apparent discrepancy between the observed low Wnt target gene expression and the lack of reduction in nuclear β-catenin localization (Figure S2). To explain this conundrum we sought to determine whether epigenetic regulatory mechanisms might act to regulate Wnt target gene expression and thereby promote progression. Methylation is involved in many biological processes, including stem cell maintenance and cancer progression. In addition, CRC development is accompanied by global changes in methylation status of a plethora of genes (Morin et al., 1997Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W.

Toth R.K. et al.DNA demethylase activity maintains intestinal cells in an undifferentiated state following loss of APC.Cell. 2010; 142: 930-942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A subtype of CRC, the CpG Island Methylation Phenotype (CIMP), has even been identified that is characterized by extensive methylation (Toyota et al., 1999Toyota M. Ahuja N. Ohe-Toyota M. Herman J.G. Baylin S.B. Issa J.P. CpG island methylator phenotype in colorectal cancer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 8681-8686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2044) Google Scholar). Several natural Wnt inhibitors, such as AXIN2 and SFRP1, have previously been shown to be methylated in CRC (Koinuma et al., 2006Koinuma K. Yamashita Y. Liu W. Hatanaka H. Kurashina K. Wada T. Takada S. Kaneda R. Choi Y.L.

Watkins D.N. Jair K.W. Schuebel K.E. Markowitz S.D. Chen W.D. Pretlow T.P. Yang B. Akiyama Y. Van Engeland M. et al.Epigenetic inactivation of SFRP genes allows constitutive WNT signaling in colorectal cancer.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the DNA methylation status of Wnt target genes first in a series of CRC cell lines. Methylation-specific PCR analysis revealed that several Wnt target genes including LGR5, APCDD1, DKK1, and ASCL2 are, to a different extent, methylated in a panel of CRC cell lines, suggesting epigenetic silencing of these genes (Figure 2C). In agreement, treatment of CRC cells with the demethylating agent 5-Azacytidine (5-Aza) resulted in marked upregulation of these genes specifically in those cell lines where methylation was evident (Figure 2D). For instance, APCDD1 expression was enhanced by 5-Aza in the lines where APCDD1 promoter methylation was clearly detectable. These data enforce the notion that Wnt targets are regulated, at least in part, by a mechanism that involves promoter methylation in CRC cell lines. Next we determined the functional relevance of this methylation-dependent silencing of Wnt target genes. Treatment of CRC cell lines with a demethylating agent resulted in markedly decreased clonogenicity of these lines (Figure 3A ). Importantly, this was a general observation; primary isolated colon-CSC cultures treated with 5-Aza also demonstrated significantly lower clonogenicity as determined by limiting dilution analysis, suggesting that the fraction of CSCs in these cultures decreased (Figure 3B). Also, in an in vivo model system in which primary CSC-induced xenograft tumors were growing subcutaneously, we observed that 5-Aza treatment resulted in markedly suppressed tumor growth (Figure 3C). Importantly, analysis of these 5-Aza-treated xenografts confirmed the efficacy of 5-Aza on re-expression of the Wnt target genes in vivo (Figure 3D), validating the methylation-dependent regulation of Wnt target genes in this in vivo model as well. To strengthen our hypothesis that re-expression of Wnt target genes has important functional consequences, we analyzed the effect of 5-Aza on Wnt activity levels. In this light it is important to realize that several of these repressed target genes normally serve as feedback inhibitors of the same pathway and as such could repress the activity of the Wnt pathway. In agreement, in several CRC cell lines, 5-Aza-mediated expression of genes previously suppressed by methylation resulted in decreased Wnt activity (Figure 3E). Although these data are suggestive for a role of Wnt target gene methylation in CRC, the effects of 5-Aza are rather generic, affecting all methylated CpG islands, and can therefore not be considered specific for Wnt target genes. We therefore questioned whether growth inhibition could be achieved directly by specific re-expression of methylated Wnt target genes. Indeed, we observed that re-expression of either AXIN2 or APCDD1, both methylated in CRC, was sufficient to decrease Wnt signaling levels (Figure 3F). This is not only observed in CRC cell lines, but confirmed in a primary CSC culture as well (Figure 3F, right bars, Co100). This Wnt activity modulation directly suggests a potential functional explanation of why suppression of a large set of Wnt target genes occurs during the adenoma to carcinoma sequence and why Wnt target gene inactivation could be associated with poor prognosis. So far our data indicate that low expression of CSC-associated Wnt target genes is related to poor prognosis and that methylation-dependent downregulation of these genes has a functionally relevant impact on the clonogenicity of CRC cells. However, it is unclear whether in-patient material suppression of a stem-cell-associated Wnt expression program is also dependent on methylation. To this end we determined the relative methylation levels of the Wnt target genes in our AMC-AJCCII-90 patient set by either methylation-specific PCR or bisulphite sequencing (Figure 4). Intriguingly, also in the tumors from our patient cohort, low Wnt target gene expression was associated with increased methylation of the promoter regions of these genes (Figure 4A). That is, in the tumors that cluster in the Wnt-low group (Figure 4A, right black bars), the fraction of DNA methylation in the APCDD1, ASCL2, AXIN2, DKK1, and LGR5 promoter regions is much higher as compared with that of the tumors that cluster in the Wnt-high group. Moreover, tumors in the Wnt-high group that did show methylation were, in several cases, derived from patients that eventually developed recurrences or metastases, as indicated by the asterisks in Figure 4A, suggesting that methylation of Wnt target genes is an even better marker for recurrences. In agreement, we found that methylation levels of a small subset of these CSC-associated Wnt target genes resulted in a highly predictive association with disease recurrence and metastasis using unsupervised cluster analysis based on the relative methylation levels (Figures 4B and 4C). Indeed, all recurrences cluster within the Wnt target gene methylation high group. These findings lend further support to the idea that methylation-dependent tuning of the Wnt expression program is related to disease progression and increased risk for recurrent disease. Our findings have three major implications for the use and interpretation of (cancer-) stem-cell-associated profiles in risk stratification of CRC. First, we confirm previous observations that ISC signatures can predict recurrence of CRC (Merlos-Suárez et al., 2011Merlos-Suárez A. Barriga F.M. Jung P. Iglesias M. Céspedes M.V. Rossell D. Sevillano M. Hernando-Momblona X. da Silva-Diz V. Muñoz P. et al.The intestinal stem cell signature identifies colorectal cancer stem cells and predicts disease relapse.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 511-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) and extend these findings with a novel colon-CSC-derived signature that has similar predictive properties, as might be expected based on the partial overlap between the various stem cell signatures. In particular both ISC and CSC signatures were characterized by a clear enrichment in Wnt target genes, consistent with the major role of the Wnt cascade in both ISC and colon-CSC biology. Second, to our surprise, our data unequivocally show that expression of many well-defined canonical Wnt target genes, including prominent ISC markers, was inversely correlated with prognosis. This unexpected finding, which was verified in multiple patient sets, significantly changes the conclusions of earlier studies of stem-cell-derived predictive signatures (Merlos-Suárez et al., 2011Merlos-Suárez A. Barriga F.M. Jung P. Iglesias M. Céspedes M.V. Rossell D. Sevillano M. Hernando-Momblona X. da Silva-Diz V.

In previous reports the association of a (cancer) stem cell signature with poor prognosis is often attributed to a relative high number of CSCs present in the malignant tissue (Merlos-Suárez et al., 2011Merlos-Suárez A.

Hyperactivation of mTOR pathway by mutations in either the Tsc1 or Tsc2 gene underlies TSC pathogenesis, but involvement of specific neural cell populations in the formation of TSC-associated neurological lesions remains unclear. We deleted Tsc1 in Emx1-expressing embryonic telencephalic neural stem cells (NSCs) and found that mutant mice faithfully recapitulated TSC neuropathological lesions, such as cortical lamination defects and subependymal nodules (SENs). These alterations were caused by enhanced generation of SVZ neural progeny, followed by their premature differentiation and impaired maturation during both embryonic and postnatal development. Notably, mTORC1-dependent Akt inhibition and STAT3 activation were involved in the reduced self-renewal and earlier neuronal and astroglial differentiation of mutant NSCs. Thus, finely tuned mTOR activation in embryonic NSCs may be critical to prevent development of TSC-associated brain lesions."
https://openalex.org/W1988153625,"RNA interference (RNAi) pathways have evolved as important modulators of gene expression that operate in the cytoplasm by degrading RNA target molecules through the activity of short (21-30 nucleotide) RNAs. RNAi components have been reported to have a role in the nucleus, as they are involved in epigenetic regulation and heterochromatin formation. However, although RNAi-mediated post-transcriptional gene silencing is well documented, the mechanisms of RNAi-mediated transcriptional gene silencing and, in particular, the role of RNAi components in chromatin dynamics, especially in animal multicellular organisms, are elusive. Here we show that the key RNAi components Dicer 2 (DCR2) and Argonaute 2 (AGO2) associate with chromatin (with a strong preference for euchromatic, transcriptionally active, loci) and interact with the core transcription machinery. Notably, loss of function of DCR2 or AGO2 showed that transcriptional defects are accompanied by the perturbation of RNA polymerase II positioning on promoters. Furthermore, after heat shock, both Dcr2 and Ago2 null mutations, as well as missense mutations that compromise the RNAi activity, impaired the global dynamics of RNA polymerase II. Finally, the deep sequencing of the AGO2-associated small RNAs (AGO2 RIP-seq) revealed that AGO2 is strongly enriched in small RNAs that encompass the promoter regions and other regions of heat-shock and other genetic loci on both the sense and antisense DNA strands, but with a strong bias for the antisense strand, particularly after heat shock. Taken together, our results show that DCR2 and AGO2 are globally associated with transcriptionally active loci and may have a pivotal role in shaping the transcriptome by controlling the processivity of RNA polymerase II."

To identify new drivers of intestinal cancer, we performed insertional mutagenesis using the Sleeping Beauty transposon system in mice carrying germline or somatic Apc mutations. By analyzing common insertion sites (CISs) isolated from 446 tumors, we identified many hundreds of candidate cancer drivers. Comparison to human data sets suggested that 234 CIS-targeted genes are also dysregulated in human colorectal cancers. In addition, we found 183 CIS-containing genes that are candidate Wnt targets and showed that 20 CISs-containing genes are newly discovered modifiers of canonical Wnt signaling. We also identified mutations associated with a subset of tumors containing an expanded number of Paneth cells, a hallmark of deregulated Wnt signaling, and genes associated with more severe dysplasia included those encoding members of the FGF signaling cascade. Some 70 genes had co-occurrence of CIS pairs, clustering into 38 sub-networks that may regulate tumor development."

https://openalex.org/W2116609370,"Chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1), one of the mammalian members of the chitinase family, is expressed in several types of human cancer, and elevated serum level of CHI3L1 is suggested to be a biomarker of poor prognosis in advanced cancer patients. However, the overall biological function of CHI3L1 in human cancers still remains unknown. Studies were performed to characterize the role of CHI3L1 in cancer pathophysiology utilizing human colorectal cancer samples and human cell lines. Plasma protein and tissue mRNA expression levels of CHI3L1 in colorectal cancer were strongly upregulated. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that CHI3L1 was expressed in cancer cells, and CHI3L1 expression had a significant association with the number of infiltrated macrophages and microvessel density (MVD). By utilizing transwell migration and tube-formation assays, overexpression of CHI3L1 in SW480 cells (human colon cancer cells) enhanced the migration of THP-1 cells (human macrophage cells) and HUVECs (human endothelial cells), and the tube formation of HUVECs. The knockdown of CHI3L1 by RNA interference or the neutralization of CHI3L1 by anti-CHI3L1 antibody displayed strong suppression of CHI3L1-induced migration and tube formation. Cell proliferation assay showed that CHI3L1 overexpression significantly enhanced the proliferation of SW480 cells. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis showed that CHI3L1 increased the secretion of inflammatory chemokines, IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), from SW480 cells through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Both neutralization of IL-8 or MCP-1 and inhibition or knockdown of MAPK in SW480 cells significantly inhibited CHI3L1-induced migration and tube formation. In a xenograft mouse model, overexpression of CHI3L1 in HCT116 cells (human colon cancer cells) enhanced the tumor growth as well as macrophage infiltration and MVD. In conclusion, CHI3L1 expressed in colon cancer cells promotes cancer cell proliferation, macrophage recruitment and angiogenesis. Thus, the inhibition of CHI3L1 activity may be a novel therapeutic strategy for human colorectal cancer."

We found stable DUX4 mRNAs only derived from the most distal D4Z4 unit and unexpectedly extended to the flanking pLAM region that provided an intron and a polyadenylation signal. DUX4 encodes a transcription factor expressed in FSHD but not control primary myoblasts or muscle biopsies. The DUX4 protein initiates a large transcription deregulation cascade leading to muscle atrophy and oxidative stress, which are FSHD key features. Methodology/Principal Findings We now show that transfection of myoblasts with a DUX4 expression vector leads to atrophic myotube formation associated with the induction of E3 ubiquitin ligases (MuRF1 and Atrogin1/MAFbx) typical of muscle atrophy. DUX4 induces expression of downstream targets deregulated in FSHD such as mu-crystallin and TP53. We developed specific siRNAs and antisense oligonucleotides (AOs) targeting the DUX4 mRNA. Addition of these antisense agents to primary FSHD myoblast cultures suppressed DUX4 protein expression and affected expression of the above-mentioned markers. Conclusions/Significance These results constitute a proof of concept for the development of therapeutic approaches for FSHD targeting DUX4 expression."

https://openalex.org/W2017333359,"The role of estrogen receptor-α (ER) in breast cancer development, and as a primary clinical marker for breast cancer prognosis, has been well documented. In this study, we identified the oncogenic protein, TWIST1 (Twist), which is overexpressed in high-grade breast cancers, as a potential negative regulator of ER expression. Functional characterization of ER regulation by Twist was performed using Twist low (MCF-7, T-47D) and Twist high (Hs 578T, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7/Twist) expressing cell lines. All Twist high expressing cell lines exhibited low ER transcript and protein levels. By chromatin immunoprecipitation and promoter assays, we demonstrated that Twist could directly bind to E-boxes in the ER promoter and significantly downregulate ER promoter activity in vitro. Functionally, Twist overexpression caused estrogen-independent proliferation of breast cells, and promoted hormone resistance to the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen and selective estrogen receptor down-regulator fulvestrant. Importantly, this effect was reversible on downregulating Twist. In addition, orthotopic tumors generated in mice using MCF-7/Twist cells were resistant to tamoxifen. These tumors had high vascular volume and permeability surface area, as determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Mechanistically, Twist recruited DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) to the ER promoter, leading to a significantly higher degree of ER promoter methylation compared with parental cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation that Twist interacted with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) at the ER promoter, causing histone deacetylation and chromatin condensation, further reducing ER transcript levels. Functional re-expression of ER was achieved using the demethylating agent, 5-azacytidine, and the HDAC inhibitor, valproic acid. Finally, an inverse relationship was observed between Twist and ER expression in human breast tumors. In summary, the regulation of ER by Twist could be an underlying mechanism for the loss of ER activity observed in breast tumors, and may contribute to the generation of hormone-resistant, ER-negative breast cancer."

This sub-population of tumor cells has been intensively investigated and their role in therapy resistance as well as tumor recurrence has been demonstrated. In that respect, development of therapeutic strategies that target CSCs (and possibly also the tumor bulk) appears a promising approach in patients suffering from primary brain tumors. In the present study, we utilized RNA interference (RNAi) to screen the complete human kinome and phosphatome (682 and 180 targets, respectively) in order to identify genes and pathways relevant for the survival of brain CSCs and thereby potential therapeutical targets for glioblastoma. We report of 46 putative candidates including known survival-related kinases and phosphatases. Interestingly, a number of genes identified are involved in metabolism, especially glycolysis, such as PDK1 and PKM2 and, most prominently PFKFB4. In vitro studies confirmed an essential role of PFKFB4 in the maintenance of brain CSCs. Furthermore, high PFKFB4 expression was associated with shorter survival of primary glioblastoma patients. Our findings support the importance of the glycolytic pathway in the maintenance of malignant glioma cells and brain CSCs and imply tumor metabolism as a promising therapeutic target in glioblastoma."

Methods and Findings We estimated the prevalence of AD in 690 outpatients with MD with uni or bilateral SNHL from otoneurology clinics at six tertiary referral hospitals by using clinica criteria and an immune panel (lymphocyte populations, antinuclear antibodies, C3, C4 and proinflammatory cytokines TNFα, INFγ). The observed prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) was higher than expected for the general population (1.39 for RA, 0.87 for SLE and 0.70 for AS, respectively). Systemic AD were more frequently observed in patients with MD and diagnostic criteria for migraine than cases with MD and tension-type headache (p = 0.007). There were clinical differences between patients with uni or bilateral SNHL, but no differences were found in the immune profile. Multiple linear regression showed that changes in lymphocytes subpopulations were associated with hearing loss and persistence of vertigo, suggesting a role for the immune response in MD. Conclusions Despite some limitations, MD displays an elevated prevalence of systemic AD such as RA, SLE and AS. This finding, which suggests an autoimmune background in a subset of patients with MD, has important implications for the treatment of MD."

Sensory perception requires accurate encoding of stimulus information by sensory receptor cells. We identified NCKX4, a potassium-dependent Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, as being necessary for rapid response termination and proper adaptation of vertebrate olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). Nckx4−/− (also known as Slc24a4) mouse OSNs displayed substantially prolonged responses and stronger adaptation. Single-cell electrophysiological analyses revealed that the majority of Na+-dependent Ca2+ exchange in OSNs relevant to sensory transduction is a result of NCKX4 and that Nckx4−/− mouse OSNs are deficient in encoding action potentials on repeated stimulation. Olfactory-specific Nckx4−/− mice had lower body weights and a reduced ability to locate an odorous source. These results establish the role of NCKX4 in shaping olfactory responses and suggest that rapid response termination and proper adaptation of peripheral sensory receptor cells tune the sensory system for optimal perception."

The ligand, Sonic Hh (SHH), has an important role in vascular formation during development. However, SHH expression is upregulated on tumor cells and can impact the tumor microenvironment. We have investigated the effects of autocrine as well as paracrine Hh signaling on tumor cells as well as on endothelial cells, respectively. Upon constitutive expression of SHH, breast cancer cells showed aggressive behavior and rapid xenograft growth characterized by highly angiogenic tumors that were spontaneously metastatic. In these cells, SHH caused activation of the Hh transcription factor, GLI1, leading to upregulated expression of the potent pro-angiogenic secreted molecule, CYR61 (cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61). Silencing of CYR61 from these SHH-expressing Hh activated cells blunted the malignant behavior of the tumor cells and resulted in reduced tumor vasculature and limited hematogenous metastases. Thus, CYR61 is a critical downstream contributor to the Hh influenced pro-angiogenic tumor microenvironment. We also observed concomitant upregulation of SHH and CYR61 transcripts in tumors from patients with advanced breast cancer, further ratifying the clinical relevance of our findings. In summary, we have defined a novel, VEGF-independent, clinically relevant, pro-angiogenic factor, CYR61, that is a transcriptional target of Hh-GLI signaling."

We show that Bak is dispensable for apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli including ABT-737 but not for fluorouracil-induced apoptosis. In addition, Bax deficiency only provides partial protection against camptothecin and cisplatin-induced apoptosis and no protection against killing by Puma or ABT-737 plus Noxa overexpression. Moreover, Bak is activated normally in response to many chemotherapeutic drugs in the presence of Bax, but remains kept in check by Mcl-1 in the absence of Bax.

Furthermore, OGG1 binds to PARP-1 through its BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) domain. OGG1 stimulated the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity of PARP-1, whereas decreased poly(ADP-ribose) levels were observed in OGG1(-/-) cells compared with wild-type cells in response to DNA damage. Importantly, activated PARP-1 inhibits OGG1. Although the OGG1 polymorphic variant proteins R229Q and S326C bind to PARP-1, these proteins were defective in activating PARP-1. Furthermore, OGG1(-/-) cells were more sensitive to PARP inhibitors alone or in combination with a DNA-damaging agent. These findings indicate that OGG1 binding to PARP-1 plays a functional role in the repair of oxidative DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2055007053,"Retinoic acid (RA) regulates several gene programs by nuclear RA receptors (RARs) that are ligand-dependent transcriptional transregulators. The basic mechanism for switching on transcription of cognate-target genes involves RAR binding at specific response elements and a network of interactions with coregulatory protein complexes. In addition to these classical genomic effects, we recently demonstrated that RA also induces the rapid activation of the p38MAPK/MSK1 pathway, with characteristic downstream consequences on the phosphorylation of RARs and the expression of their target genes. Here, we aimed at deciphering the underlying mechanism of the rapid non-genomic effects of RA. We highlighted a novel paradigm in which a fraction of the cellular RARα pool is present in membrane lipid rafts, where it forms complexes with G protein alpha Q (Gαq) in response to RA. This rapid RA-induced formation of RARα/Gαq complexes in lipid rafts is required for the activation of p38MAPK that occurs in response to RA. Accordingly, in RA-resistant cancer cells, characterized by the absence of p38MAPK activation, RARα present in membrane lipid rafts does not associate with Gαq, pointing out the essential contribution of RARα/Gαq complexes in RA signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2080285527,"NMR and ITC are used to define essential features of a p38α phosphatase interface that extend beyond the classic KIM binding site, and SAXS analysis software, incorporating NMR chemical shift data, are developed and applied to build a model of the p38α-HePTP complex. MAP kinases regulate essential cellular events, including cell growth, differentiation and inflammation. The solution structure of a complete MAPK–MAPK-regulatory protein complex, p38α–HePTP, was determined, enabling a comprehensive investigation of the molecular basis of specificity and fidelity in MAPK regulation. Structure determination was achieved by combining NMR spectroscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering data with a new ensemble calculation–refinement procedure. We identified 25 residues outside of the HePTP kinase interaction motif necessary for p38α recognition. The complex adopts an extended conformation in solution and rarely samples the conformation necessary for kinase deactivation. Complex formation also does not affect the N-terminal lobe, the activation loop of p38α or the catalytic domain of HePTP. Together, these results show how the downstream tyrosine phosphatase HePTP regulates p38α and provide for fundamentally new insights into MAPK regulation and specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1971245158,"Pancreatic cancer remains as one of the most deadly cancers, and responds poorly to current therapies. The prognosis is extremely poor, with a 5-year survival of less than 5%. Therefore, search for new effective therapeutic drugs is of pivotal need and urgency to improve treatment of this incurable malignancy. Synthetic alkyl-lysophospholipid analogs (ALPs) constitute a heterogeneous group of unnatural lipids that promote apoptosis in a wide variety of tumor cells. In this study, we found that the anticancer drug edelfosine was the most potent ALP in killing human pancreatic cancer cells, targeting endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Edelfosine was taken up in significant amounts by pancreatic cancer cells and induced caspase- and mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. Pancreatic cancer cells show a prominent ER and edelfosine accumulated in this subcellular structure, inducing a potent ER stress response, with caspase-4, BAP31 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, CHOP/GADD153 upregulation and phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 α-subunit that eventually led to cell death. Oral administration of edelfosine in xenograft mouse models of pancreatic cancer induced a significant regression in tumor growth and an increase in apoptotic index, as assessed by TUNEL assay and caspase-3 activation in the tumor sections. The ER stress-associated marker CHOP/GADD153 was visualized in the pancreatic tumor isolated from edelfosine-treated mice, indicating a strong in vivo ER stress response. These results suggest that edelfosine exerts its pro-apoptotic action in pancreatic cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo, through its accumulation in the ER, which leads to ER stress and apoptosis. Thus, we propose that the ER could be a key target in pancreatic cancer, and edelfosine may constitute a prototype for the development of a new class of antitumor drugs targeting the ER."
https://openalex.org/W2006363605,"The homing ability of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) allows them to migrate into niches after being transplantated into infertile testes. Transplanted SSCs attach to Sertoli cells and transmigrate through the blood-testis barrier (BTB), formed by inter-Sertoli tight junctions, toward niches on the basement membrane. The most critical step is the passage through the BTB, which limits the homing efficiency to <10%. Here we demonstrated the involvement of Rac1 in SSC transmigration. Rac1-deficient SSCs did not colonize the adult testes, but they reinitiated spermatogenesis when transplanted into pup testes without a BTB. Moreover, a dominant-negative Rac1 construct not only reduced the expression of several claudin proteins, which comprise the BTB, but also increased SSC proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) -mediated suppression of claudin3, which was downregulated by Rac inhibition, reduced the SSC homing efficiency. Thus, Rac1 is a critical regulator of SSC homing and proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2040677781,"All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), the only clinically available cyto-differentiating agent, has potential for the therapy/chemoprevention of breast carcinoma. Given the heterogeneous nature of this tumor, a rational use of ATRA and derivatives (retinoids) in the clinic requires the identification of patients that would benefit from retinoid-based protocols. Here, we demonstrate that 23-32% of the human ERBB2(+) breast cancers show coamplification of retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA), encoding the retinoic acid receptor, RARα. This represents a novel subtype of breast cancer characterized by remarkable sensitivity to ATRA and RARα agonists, regardless of positivity to the estrogen receptor, a known modulator of retinoid sensitivity. In estrogen-receptor-negative cellular models showing coamplification of ERBB2 and RARA, simultaneous targeting of the corresponding gene products with combinations of lapatinib and ATRA causes synergistic growth inhibition, cyto-differentiation and apoptosis. This provides proof-of-principle that coamplification of ERBB2 and RARA can be exploited for the stratified and targeted therapy of a novel subtype of breast cancer patients, with an approach characterized by tumor cell selectivity and low predicted toxicity. The available cellular models were exploited to define the molecular mechanisms underlying the antitumor activity of combinations between lapatinib and ATRA. Global gene expression and functional approaches provide evidence for three components of the antiproliferative/apoptotic responses triggered by lapatinib+ATRA. Induction of the retinoid-dependent RARRES3 protein by ATRA stabilizes the effect of lapatinib inhibiting ERBB2 phosphorylation. Upregulation and activation of the transcription factor FOXO3A integrates ATRA-dependent transcriptional and lapatinib-dependent posttranscriptional signals, controlling the levels of effector proteins like the antiapoptotic factor, BIRC5. Stimulation of the TGFβ pathway by ATRA mediates other components of the apoptotic process set in motion by simultaneous targeting of ERBB2 and RARα."
https://openalex.org/W2068067948,"Mutations in the LGI1 gene predispose to a hereditary epilepsy syndrome and is the first gene associated with this disease which does not encode an ion channel protein. In zebrafish, there are two paralogs of the LGI1 gene, lgi1a and lgi1b. Knockdown of lgi1a results in a seizure-like hyperactivity phenotype with associated developmental abnormalities characterized by cellular loss in the eyes and brain. We have now generated knockdown morphants for the lgi1b gene which also show developmental abnormalities but do not show a seizure-like behavior. Instead, the most striking phenotype involves significant enlargement of the ventricles (hydrocephalus). As shown for the lgi1a morphants, however, lgi1b morphants are also sensitized to PTZ-induced hyperactivity. The different phenotypes between the two lgi1 morphants support a subfunctionalization model for the two paralogs."
https://openalex.org/W2064163449,"The 23-megabase genome of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of severe human malaria, contains ∼5300 genes, most of unknown function or lacking homologs in other organisms. Identification of these gene functions will help in the discovery of novel targets for the development of antimalarial drugs and vaccines. The P. falciparum genome is unusually A+T-rich, which hampers cloning and expressing these genes in heterologous systems for functional analysis. The large repertoire of genetic tools available for Saccharomyces cerevisiae makes this yeast an ideal system for large scale functional complementation analyses of parasite genes. Here, we report the construction of a cDNA library from P. knowlesi, which has a lower A+T content compared with P. falciparum. This library was applied in a yeast complementation assay to identify malaria genes involved in the decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine. Transformation of a psd1Δpsd2Δdpl1Δ yeast strain, defective in phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis, with the P. knowlesi library led to identification of a new parasite phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PkPSD). Unlike phosphatidylserine decarboxylase enzymes from other eukaryotes that are tightly associated with membranes, the PkPSD enzyme expressed in yeast was equally distributed between membrane and soluble fractions. In vitro studies reveal that truncated forms of PkPSD are soluble and undergo auto-endoproteolytic maturation in a phosphatidylserine-dependent reaction that is inhibited by other anionic phospholipids. This study defines a new system for probing the function of Plasmodium genes by library-based genetic complementation and its usefulness in revealing new biochemical properties of encoded proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2131817855,"Anti-mitotic chemotherapeutic agents such as taxanes activate the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) to arrest anaphase onset, but taxane-exposed cells eventually undergo slippage to exit mitosis. The therapeutic efficacy of taxanes depends on whether slippage after SAC arrest culminates in continued cell survival, or in death by apoptosis. However, the mechanisms that determine these outcomes remain unclear. Here, we identify a novel role for cyclin G1 (CCNG1), an atypical cyclin. Increased CCNG1 expression accompanies paclitaxel-induced, SAC-mediated mitotic arrest, independent of p53 integrity or signaling through the SAC component, BUBR1. CCNG1 overexpression promotes cell survival after paclitaxel exposure. Conversely, CCNG1 depletion by RNA interference delays slippage and enhances paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. Consistent with these observations, CCNG1 amplification is associated with significantly shorter post-surgical survival in patients with ovarian cancer who have received adjuvant chemotherapy with taxanes and platinum compounds. Collectively, our findings implicate CCNG1 in regulating slippage and the outcome of taxane-induced mitotic arrest, with potential implications for cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2131219751,"Patches in primary visual cortex (V1) rich in cytochrome oxidase were thought to contain unoriented, color-opponent neurons. Here the authors measure orientation tuning in V1 neurons using acutely implanted 100-electrode arrays. Patch cells were nearly as well tuned as those in interpatches, suggesting that processing of form and color is not strictly segregated in primate V1. Patch cells had higher mean discharge rates, consistent with their enhanced metabolism. The abundant concentration of cytochrome oxidase in patches or blobs of primate striate cortex has never been explained. Patches are thought to contain unoriented, color-opponent neurons. Lacking orientation selectivity, these cells might endow patches with high metabolic activity because they respond to all contours in visual scenes. To test this idea, we measured orientation tuning in layer 2/3 of macaque cortical area V1 using acutely implanted 100-electrode arrays. Each electrode recording site was identified and assigned to the patch or interpatch compartment. The mean orientation bandwidth of cells was 28.4° in patches and 25.8° in interpatches. Neurons in patches were indeed less orientation selective, but the difference was subtle, indicating that the processing of form and color is not strictly segregated in V1. The most conspicuous finding was that patch cells had a 49% greater overall firing rate. This global difference in neuronal responsiveness, rather than an absence of orientation tuning, may account for the rich mitochondrial enzyme activity that defines patches."

AFB1 is the most carcinogenic compound in food and foodstuffs amongst aflatoxins (AFs). AnAFB1 is AFB1 chemically modified as AFB1-1(O-carboxymethyl) oxime. In comparison to AFB1, AnAFB1 has proven to be non-toxic in vitro to human hepatocarcinoma cells and non mutagenic to Salmonella typhimurium strains. AnAFB1-KLH was used for immunization of cows proving to induce a long lasting titer of anti-AFB1 IgG antibodies (Abs) which were cross reactive with AFB1, AFG1, and AFG2. The elicited anti-AFB1 Abs were able to hinder the secretion of AFM1 into the milk of cows continuously fed with AFB1. Vaccination of lactating animals with conjugated AnAFB1 may represent a solution to the public hazard constituted by milk and cheese contaminated with AFs."
https://openalex.org/W2000276325,"Tissue-specific manipulation of known copper transport genes in Drosophila tissues results in phenotypes that are presumably due to an alteration in copper levels in the targeted cells. However direct confirmation of this has to date been technically challenging. Measures of cellular copper content such as expression levels of copper-responsive genes or cuproenzyme activity levels, while useful, are indirect. First-generation copper-sensitive fluorophores show promise but currently lack the sensitivity required to detect subtle changes in copper levels. Moreover such techniques do not provide information regarding other relevant biometals such as zinc or iron. Traditional techniques for measuring elemental composition such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy are not sensitive enough for use with the small tissue amounts available in Drosophila research. Here we present synchrotron x-ray fluorescence microscopy analysis of two different Drosophila tissues, the larval wing imaginal disc, and sectioned adult fly heads and show that this technique can be used to detect changes in tissue copper levels caused by targeted manipulation of known copper homeostasis genes."
https://openalex.org/W1965267520,"Leucine zipper tumor suppressor 2 (Lzts2) functions in the development and progression of various tumors, but its activities in vertebrate embryogenesis remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that lzts2 transcripts are of maternal origin in zebrafish embryos. Activation of BMP signaling up-regulates zygotic expression of lzts2, whereas canonical Wnt signaling acts upstream of BMP signaling to inhibit lzts2 expression. Abrogation of lzts2 expression by its specific morpholino-enhanced gastrula convergence and extension (CE) movements, dorsalized early embryos, and inhibited specification of midline progenitors for pancreas, liver, and heart. In contrast, ectopic expression of lzts2 led to the delay of CE movements and midline convergence of organ progenitors and resulted in a certain ratio of ventralized embryos. Mechanistically, Lzts2 regulates the migration of embryonic cells and dorsoventral patterning through its limitation of Wnt/β-catenin activity, because it physically interacts with β-catenin-1 and -2 and transports them out of the nucleus. In addition, both β-catenin-1 and -2 exhibit redundant functions in activation of Stat3 signaling and in induction of Wnt5/11 expression through inhibition of BMP signaling and stimulation of Cyclops and Squint expression. Thus, Lzts2 regulates gastrula CE movements, dorsoventral patterning, and midline convergence and specification of organ precursors through interaction with and the export of nuclear β-catenins in zebrafish."
https://openalex.org/W1972896356,"During mating, males and females of N. viridula (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) produce sex- and species-specific calling and courtship substrate-borne vibratory signals, grouped into songs. Recognition and localization of these signals are fundamental for successful mating. The recognition is mainly based on the temporal pattern, i.e. the amplitude modulation, while the frequency spectrum of the signals usually only plays a minor role. We examined the temporal selectivity for vibratory signals in four types of ascending vibratory interneurons in N. viridula. Using intracellular recording and labelling technique, we analyzed the neurons' responses to 30 pulse duration/interval duration (PD/ID) combinations. Two response arrays were created for each neuron type, showing the intensity of the responses either as time-averaged spike counts or as peak instantaneous spike rates. The mean spike rate response arrays showed preference of the neurons for short PDs (below 600 ms) and no selectivity towards interval duration; while the peak spike rate response arrays exhibited either short PD/long ID selectivity or no selectivity at all. The long PD/short ID combinations elicited the weakest responses in all neurons tested. No response arrays showed the receiver preference for either constant period or duty cycle. The vibratory song pattern selectivity matched the PD of N. viridula male vibratory signals, thus pointing to temporal filtering for the conspecific vibratory signals already at level of the ascending interneurons. In some neurons the responses elicited by the vibratory stimuli were followed by distinct, regular oscillations of the membrane potential. The distance between the oscillation peaks matched the temporal structure of the male calling song, indicating a possible resonance based mechanism for signal recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2017209271,"Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides containing unmethylated CpG motifs (CpG) stimulate innate immune responses. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) has been implicated in CpG-induced immune activation; however, its precise role has not yet been clarified. CpG-induced production of IL-10 was dramatically increased in macrophages deficient in PI3Kγ (p110γ(-/-)). By contrast, LPS-induced production of IL-10 was unchanged in the cells. CpG-induced, but not LPS-induced, IL-10 production was almost completely abolished in SCID mice having mutations in DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs). Furthermore, wortmannin, an inhibitor of DNA-PKcs, completely inhibited CpG-induced IL-10 production, both in wild type and p110γ(-/-) cells. Microscopic analyses revealed that CpG preferentially localized with DNA-PKcs in p110γ(-/-) cells than in wild type cells. In addition, CpG was preferentially co-localized with the acidic lysosomal marker, LysoTracker, in p110γ(-/-) cells, and with an early endosome marker, EEA1, in wild type cells. Over-expression of p110γ in Cos7 cells resulted in decreased acidification of CpG containing endosome. A similar effect was reproduced using kinase-dead mutants, but not with a ras-binding site mutant, of p110γ. Thus, it is likely that p110γ, in a manner independent of its kinase activity, inhibits the acidification of CpG-containing endosomes. It is considered that increased acidification of CpG-containing endosomes in p110γ(-/-) cells enforces endosomal escape of CpG, which results in increased association of CpG with DNA-PKcs to up-regulate IL-10 production in macrophages."
