https://openalex.org/W4224247759,"Further enhancing the performance and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is crucial for their commercialization. We report that the functionalization of multication and halide perovskite interfaces with an organometallic compound, ferrocenyl-bis-thiophene-2-carboxylate (FcTc2), simultaneously enhanced the efficiency and stability of inverted PSCs. The resultant devices achieved a power conversion efficiency of 25.0% and maintained >98% of their initial efficiency after continuously operating at the maximum power point for 1500 hours under simulated AM1.5 illumination. Moreover, the FcTc2-functionalized devices passed the international standards for mature photovoltaics (IEC61215:2016) and have exhibited high stability under the damp heat test (85°C and 85% relative humidity)."
https://openalex.org/W4225259930,"The ability to engineer parallel, programmable operations between desired qubits within a quantum processor is central for building scalable quantum information systems. In most state-of-the-art approaches, qubits interact locally, constrained by the connectivity associated with their fixed spatial layout. Here, we demonstrate a quantum processor with dynamic, nonlocal connectivity, in which entangled qubits are coherently transported in a highly parallel manner across two spatial dimensions, in between layers of single- and two-qubit operations. Our approach makes use of neutral atom arrays trapped and transported by optical tweezers; hyperfine states are used for robust quantum information storage, and excitation into Rydberg states is used for entanglement generation. We use this architecture to realize programmable generation of entangled graph states such as cluster states and a 7-qubit Steane code state. Furthermore, we shuttle entangled ancilla arrays to realize a surface code with 19 qubits and a toric code state on a torus with 24 qubits. Finally, we use this architecture to realize a hybrid analog-digital evolution and employ it for measuring entanglement entropy in quantum simulations, experimentally observing non-monotonic entanglement dynamics associated with quantum many-body scars. Realizing a long-standing goal, these results pave the way toward scalable quantum processing and enable new applications ranging from simulation to metrology."
https://openalex.org/W4224254118,"Gate-model quantum computers promise to solve currently intractable computational problems if they can be operated at scale with long coherence times and high-fidelity logic. Neutral-atom hyperfine qubits provide inherent scalability owing to their identical characteristics, long coherence times and ability to be trapped in dense, multidimensional arrays1. Combined with the strong entangling interactions provided by Rydberg states2-4, all the necessary characteristics for quantum computation are available. Here we demonstrate several quantum algorithms on a programmable gate-model neutral-atom quantum computer in an architecture based on individual addressing of single atoms with tightly focused optical beams scanned across a two-dimensional array of qubits. Preparation of entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states5 with up to six qubits, quantum phase estimation for a chemistry problem6 and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA)7 for the maximum cut (MaxCut) graph problem are demonstrated. These results highlight the emergent capability of neutral-atom qubit arrays for universal, programmable quantum computation, as well as preparation of non-classical states of use for quantum-enhanced sensing."

https://openalex.org/W3198784171,"Three-dimensional (3D) printing has exploded in interest as new technologies have opened up a multitude of applications1-6, with stereolithography a particularly successful approach4,7-9. However, owing to the linear absorption of light, this technique requires photopolymerization to occur at the surface of the printing volume, imparting fundamental limitations on resin choice and shape gamut. One promising way to circumvent this interfacial paradigm is to move beyond linear processes, with many groups using two-photon absorption to print in a truly volumetric fashion3,7-9. Using two-photon absorption, many groups and companies have been able to create remarkable nanoscale structures4,5, but the laser power required to drive this process has limited print size and speed, preventing widespread application beyond the nanoscale. Here we use triplet fusion upconversion10-13 to print volumetrically with less than 4 milliwatt continuous-wave excitation. Upconversion is introduced to the resin by means of encapsulation with a silica shell and solubilizing ligands. We further introduce an excitonic strategy to systematically control the upconversion threshold to support either monovoxel or parallelized printing schemes, printing at power densities several orders of magnitude lower than the power densities required for two-photon-based 3D printing."
https://openalex.org/W4224234680,"Dementia in Alzheimer’s disease progresses alongside neurodegeneration1–4, but the specific events that cause neuronal dysfunction and death remain poorly understood. During normal ageing, neurons progressively accumulate somatic mutations5 at rates similar to those of dividing cells6,7 which suggests that genetic factors, environmental exposures or disease states might influence this accumulation5. Here we analysed single-cell whole-genome sequencing data from 319 neurons from the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and neurotypical control individuals. We found that somatic DNA alterations increase in individuals with Alzheimer’s disease, with distinct molecular patterns. Normal neurons accumulate mutations primarily in an age-related pattern (signature A), which closely resembles ‘clock-like’ mutational signatures that have been previously described in healthy and cancerous cells6–10. In neurons affected by Alzheimer’s disease, additional DNA alterations are driven by distinct processes (signature C) that highlight C>A and other specific nucleotide changes. These changes potentially implicate nucleotide oxidation4,11, which we show is increased in Alzheimer’s-disease-affected neurons in situ. Expressed genes exhibit signature-specific damage, and mutations show a transcriptional strand bias, which suggests that transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair has a role in the generation of mutations. The alterations in Alzheimer’s disease affect coding exons and are predicted to create dysfunctional genetic knockout cells and proteostatic stress. Our results suggest that known pathogenic mechanisms in Alzheimer’s disease may lead to genomic damage to neurons that can progressively impair function. The aberrant accumulation of DNA alterations in neurodegeneration provides insight into the cascade of molecular and cellular events that occurs in the development of Alzheimer’s disease. Analyses of single-cell whole-genome sequencing data show that somatic mutations are increased in the brain of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease compared to neurotypical individuals, with a pattern of genomic damage distinct from that of normal ageing."
https://openalex.org/W4224244679,"Marine heatwaves (MHWs)-periods of exceptionally warm ocean temperature lasting weeks to years-are now widely recognized for their capacity to disrupt marine ecosystems1-3. The substantial ecological and socioeconomic impacts of these extreme events present significant challenges to marine resource managers4-7, who would benefit from forewarning of MHWs to facilitate proactive decision-making8-11. However, despite extensive research into the physical drivers of MHWs11,12, there has been no comprehensive global assessment of our ability to predict these events. Here we use a large multimodel ensemble of global climate forecasts13,14 to develop and assess MHW forecasts that cover the world's oceans with lead times of up to a year. Using 30 years of retrospective forecasts, we show that the onset, intensity and duration of MHWs are often predictable, with skilful forecasts possible from 1 to 12 months in advance depending on region, season and the state of large-scale climate modes, such as the El Niño/Southern Oscillation. We discuss considerations for setting decision thresholds based on the probability that a MHW will occur, empowering stakeholders to take appropriate actions based on their risk profile. These results highlight the potential for operational MHW forecasts, analogous to forecasts of extreme weather phenomena, to promote climate resilience in global marine ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W4224212244,"Cross-electrophile coupling (XEC) reactions of aryl and alkyl electrophiles are appealing but limited to specific substrate classes. Here, we report electroreductive XEC of previously incompatible electrophiles including tertiary alkyl bromides, aryl chlorides, and aryl/vinyl triflates. Reactions rely on the merger of an electrochemically active complex that selectively reacts with alkyl bromides through 1e- processes and an electrochemically inactive Ni0(phosphine) complex that selectively reacts with aryl electrophiles through 2e- processes. Accessing Ni0(phosphine) intermediates is critical to the strategy but is often challenging. We uncover a previously unknown pathway for electrochemically generating these key complexes at mild potentials through a choreographed series of ligand-exchange reactions. The mild methodology is applied to the alkylation of a range of substrates including natural products and pharmaceuticals."

Preserving this efficiency in scale-up from cell to stack level poses challenges to the distribution of heat and gas flows and electric current throughout a robust functional design. Here, we demonstrate a 36-cell well-balanced reactor stack enabled by a new interconnect that achieves complete conversion of methane with more than 99% recovery to pressurized hydrogen, leaving a concentrated stream of carbon dioxide. Comparable cell performance was also achieved with ammonia, and the operation was confirmed at pressures exceeding 140 bars. The stacking of proton ceramic reactors into practical thermo-electrochemical devices demonstrates their potential in efficient hydrogen production."
https://openalex.org/W4224254848,"Many-body interactions between carriers lie at the heart of correlated physics. The ability to tune such interactions would allow the possibility to access and control complex electronic phase diagrams. Recently, two-dimensional moiré superlattices have emerged as a promising platform for quantum engineering such phenomena1-3. The power of the moiré system lies in the high tunability of its physical parameters by adjusting the layer twist angle1-3, electrical field4-6, moiré carrier filling7-11 and interlayer coupling12. Here we report that optical excitation can highly tune the spin-spin interactions between moiré-trapped carriers, resulting in ferromagnetic order in WS2 /WSe2 moiré superlattices. Near the filling factor of -1/3 (that is, one hole per three moiré unit cells), as the excitation power at the exciton resonance increases, a well-developed hysteresis loop emerges in the reflective magnetic circular dichroism signal as a function of magnetic field, a hallmark of ferromagnetism. The hysteresis loop persists down to charge neutrality, and its shape evolves as the moiré superlattice is gradually filled, indicating changes of magnetic ground state properties. The observed phenomenon points to a mechanism in which itinerant photoexcited excitons mediate exchange coupling between moiré-trapped holes. This exciton-mediated interaction can be of longer range than direct coupling between moiré-trapped holes9, and thus magnetic order arises even in the dilute hole regime. This discovery adds a dynamic tuning knob to the rich many-body Hamiltonian of moiré quantum matter13-19."
https://openalex.org/W4224210237,"Relaxor-lead titanate (PbTiO3) crystals, which exhibit extremely high piezoelectricity, are believed to possess high electro-optic (EO) coefficients. However, the optical transparency of relaxor-PbTiO3 crystals is severely reduced as a result of light scattering and reflection by domain walls, limiting electro-optic applications. Through synergistic design of a ferroelectric phase, crystal orientation, and poling technique, we successfully removed all light-scattering domain walls and achieved an extremely high transmittance of 99.6% in antireflection film-coated crystals, with an ultrahigh EO coefficient r33 of 900 picometers per volt (pm V-1), >30 times as high as that of conventionally used EO crystals. Using these crystals, we fabricated ultracompact EO Q-switches that require very low driving voltages, with superior performance to that of commercial Q-switches. Development of these materials is important for the portability and low driving voltage of EO devices."
https://openalex.org/W4224268864,"Precisely engineered mechanical oscillators keep time, filter signals and sense motion, making them an indispensable part of the technological landscape of today. These unique capabilities motivate bringing mechanical devices into the quantum domain by interfacing them with engineered quantum circuits. Proposals to combine microwave-frequency mechanical resonators with superconducting devices suggest the possibility of powerful quantum acoustic processors1-3. Meanwhile, experiments in several mechanical systems have demonstrated quantum state control and readout4,5, phonon number resolution6,7 and phonon-mediated qubit-qubit interactions8,9. At present, these acoustic platforms lack processors capable of controlling the quantum states of several mechanical oscillators with a single qubit and the rapid quantum non-demolition measurements of mechanical states needed for error correction. Here we use a superconducting qubit to control and read out the quantum state of a pair of nanomechanical resonators. Our device is capable of fast qubit-mechanics swap operations, which we use to deterministically manipulate the mechanical states. By placing the qubit into the strong dispersive regime with both mechanical resonators simultaneously, we determine the phonon number distributions of the resonators by means of Ramsey measurements. Finally, we present quantum tomography of the prepared nonclassical and entangled mechanical states. Our result represents a concrete step towards feedback-based operation of a quantum acoustic processor."
https://openalex.org/W4224279491,"Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer cells kill virus-infected and tumor cells through the polarized release of perforin and granzymes. Perforin is a pore-forming toxin that creates a lesion in the plasma membrane of the target cell through which granzymes enter the cytosol and initiate apoptosis. Endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) proteins are involved in the repair of small membrane wounds. We found that ESCRT proteins were precisely recruited in target cells to sites of CTL engagement immediately after perforin release. Inhibition of ESCRT machinery in cancer-derived cells enhanced their susceptibility to CTL-mediated killing. Thus, repair of perforin pores by ESCRT machinery limits granzyme entry into the cytosol, potentially enabling target cells to resist cytolytic attack."
https://openalex.org/W4224212171,"Interlayer excitons, electron-hole pairs bound across two monolayer van der Waals semiconductors, offer promising electrical tunability and localizability. Because such excitons display weak electron-hole overlap, most studies have examined only the lowest-energy excitons through photoluminescence. We directly measured the dielectric response of interlayer excitons, which we accessed using their static electric dipole moment. We thereby determined an intrinsic radiative lifetime of 0.40 nanoseconds for the lowest direct-gap interlayer exciton in a tungsten diselenide/molybdenum diselenide heterostructure. We found that differences in electric field and twist angle induced trends in exciton transition strengths and energies, which could be related to wave function overlap, moiré confinement, and atomic reconstruction. Through comparison with photoluminescence spectra, this study identifies a momentum-indirect emission mechanism. Characterization of the absorption is key for applications relying on light-matter interactions."
https://openalex.org/W4224212981,"Natural molecular machines contain protein components that undergo motion relative to each other. Designing such mechanically constrained nanoscale protein architectures with internal degrees of freedom is an outstanding challenge for computational protein design. Here we explore the de novo construction of protein machinery from designed axle and rotor components with internal cyclic or dihedral symmetry. We find that the axle-rotor systems assemble in vitro and in vivo as designed. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we find that these systems populate conformationally variable relative orientations reflecting the symmetry of the coupled components and the computationally designed interface energy landscape. These mechanical systems with internal degrees of freedom are a step toward the design of genetically encodable nanomachines."
https://openalex.org/W4225624147,"As a way of minimising the devastating effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, scientists hastily developed a vaccine. However, the scale-up of the vaccine is likely to be hindered by the widespread social media misinformation. We therefore conducted a study to assess the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among Zimbabweans.We conducted a descriptive online cross-sectional survey using a self-administered questionnaire among adults. The questionnaire assessed willingness to be vaccinated; socio-demographic characteristics, individual attitudes and perceptions, effectiveness and safety of the vaccine. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was utilized to examine the independent factors associated with vaccine uptake.We analysed data for 1168 participants, age range of 19-89 years with the majority being females (57.5%). Half (49.9%) of the participants reported that they would accept the COVID-19 vaccine. Majority were uncertain about the effectiveness of the vaccine (76.0%) and its safety (55.0%). About half lacked trust in the government's ability to ensure availability of an effective vaccine and 61.0% mentioned that they would seek advice from a healthcare worker to vaccinate. Chronic disease [vs no chronic disease-Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 1.50, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)I: 1.10-2.03], males [vs females-AOR: 1.83, 95%CI: 1.37-2.44] and being a healthcare worker [vs not being a health worker-AOR: 1.59, 95%CI: 1.18-2.14] were associated with increased likelihood to vaccinate.We found half of the participants willing to vaccinate against COVID-19. The majority lacked trust in the government and were uncertain about vaccine effectiveness and safety. The policy makers should consider targeting geographical and demographic groups which were unlikely to vaccinate with vaccine information, education and communication to improve uptake."
https://openalex.org/W4224210499,"Translational symmetry breaking is antagonistic to static fluidity but can be realized in superconductors, which host a quantum-mechanical coherent fluid formed by electron pairs. A peculiar example of such a state is the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, induced by a time-reversal symmetry-breaking magnetic field applied to spin-singlet superconductors. This state is intrinsically accompanied by the superconducting spin smecticity, spin density-modulated fluidity with spontaneous translational-symmetry breaking. Detection of such spin smecticity provides unambiguous evidence for the FFLO state, but its observation has been challenging. Here, we report the characteristic ""double-horn"" nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum in the layered superconductor Sr2RuO4 near its upper critical field, indicating the spatial sinusoidal modulation of spin density that is consistent with superconducting spin smecticity. Our work reveals that Sr2RuO4 provides a versatile platform for studying FFLO physics."

Although migration through pores and tracks in the extracellular matrix (ECM) has been well studied, little is known about cellular traversal into confining cell-dense tissues. We find that embryonic tissue invasion by Drosophila macrophages requires division of an epithelial ectodermal cell at the site of entry. Dividing ectodermal cells disassemble ECM attachment formed by integrin-mediated focal adhesions next to mesodermal cells, allowing macrophages to move their nuclei ahead and invade between two immediately adjacent tissues. Invasion efficiency depends on division frequency, but reduction of adhesion strength allows macrophage entry independently of division. This work demonstrates that tissue dynamics can regulate cellular infiltration."

Atomic-scale spatial and femtosecond temporal resolutions were obtained from this quantum coherence. The H2 acts as a two-level system, with its coherent superposition exhibiting extreme sensitivity to the applied electric field and the underlying atomic composition of the copper nitride (Cu2N) monolayer islands grown on a Cu(100) surface.

https://openalex.org/W4224230398,"Nova explosions are caused by global thermonuclear runaways triggered in the surface layers of accreting white dwarfs1-3. It has been predicted4-6 that localized thermonuclear bursts on white dwarfs can also take place, similar to type-I X-ray bursts observed in accreting neutron stars. Unexplained rapid bursts from the binary system TV Columbae, in which mass is accreted onto a moderately strong magnetized white dwarf from a low-mass companion, have been observed on several occasions in the past 40 years7-11. During these bursts, the optical/ultraviolet luminosity increases by a factor of more than three in less than an hour and fades in around ten hours. Fast outflows have been observed in ultraviolet spectral lines7, with velocities of more than 3,500 kilometres per second, comparable to the escape velocity from the white dwarf surface. Here we report on optical bursts observed in TV Columbae and in two additional accreting systems, EI Ursae Majoris and ASASSN-19bh. The bursts have a total energy of approximately 10-6 times than those of classical nova explosions (micronovae) and bear a strong resemblance to type-I X-ray bursts12-14. We exclude accretion or stellar magnetic reconnection events as their origin and suggest thermonuclear runaway events in magnetically confined accretion columns as a viable explanation."

We estimated these costs in the context of a safety campaign that, to encourage safe driving, displays traffic fatality counts on highway dynamic message signs for 1 week each month. We found that crashes increase statewide during campaign weeks, which is inconsistent with any benefits. Furthermore, these effects do not persist beyond campaign weeks. Our results show that behavioral interventions, particularly negatively framed ones, can be too salient, crowding out more important considerations and causing interventions to backfire-with costly consequences."

https://openalex.org/W4224228835,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a positive-sense RNA flavivirus and can cause serious neurological disorders including microcephaly in infected fetuses. As a mosquito-borne arbovirus, it enters the bloodstream and replicates in various organs. During pregnancy, it can be transmitted from the blood of the viremic mother to the fetus by crossing the placental barrier. Monocytes and macrophages are considered the earliest blood cell types to be infected by ZIKV. As a first line defense, these cells are crucial components in innate immunity and host responses and may impact viral pathogenesis in humans. Previous studies have shown that ZIKV infection can activate inflammasomes and induce proinflammatory cytokines in monocytes. In this report, we showed that ZIKV could infect and induce cell death in human and murine macrophages. In addition to the presence of cleaved caspase-3, indicating that apoptosis was involved, we identified the cleaved caspase-1 and gasdermin D (GSDMD) as well as increased secretion of IL-1β and IL-18. This suggests that the inflammasome was activated and that may lead to pyroptosis in infected macrophages. The pyroptosis was NLRP3-dependent and could be suppressed in the macrophages treated with shRNA to target and knockdown caspase-1. It was also be inhibited by an inhibitor for caspase-1, indicating that the pyroptosis was triggered via a canonical approach. Our findings in this study demonstrate a concomitant occurrence of apoptosis and pyroptosis in ZIKV-infected macrophages, with two mechanisms involved in the cell death, which may have potentially significant impacts on viral pathogenesis in humans."
https://openalex.org/W4224256544,"Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the five most incident and lethal cancers in world and its burden varies between countries and sexes. We aimed to present a comprehensive measure called the quality of care index (QCI) to evaluate the inequity and healthcare quality of care regarding CRC by sex and location. Methods Data on the burden of CRC were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease study 2019. It was transformed to four ratios, including mortality-to-incidence, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)-to-prevalence, prevalence-to-incidence, and years of life lost (YLLs)-to-years lived with disability (YLDs). Principal component analysis was implemented on the four ratios and the most influential component was considered as QCI with a score ranging from zero to 100, for which higher scores represented better quality of care. Gender Disparity Ratio (GDR) was calculated by dividing QCI for females by males. Results The global incidence and death numbers of CRC were 2,166,168 (95% uncertainty interval: 1,996,298–2,342,842) and 1,085,797 (1,002,795–1,149,679) in 2019, respectively. Globally, QCI and GDR values were 77.6 and 1.0 respectively in 2019. There was a positive association between the level of quality of care and socio-demographic index (SDI) quintiles. Region of the Americas and African Region had the highest and lowest QCI values, respectively (84.4 vs. 23.6). The QCI values started decreasing beyond the age of 75 in 2019 worldwide. Conclusion There is heterogeneity in QCI between SDI quintiles. More attention should be paid to people aged more than 75 years old because of the lower quality of care in this group."
https://openalex.org/W4224263454,"The spiking probability of an electrically stimulated axon as a function of stimulus amplitude increases in a sigmoidal dependency from 0 to 1. However, most computer simulation studies for neuroprosthetic applications calculate thresholds for neural targets with a deterministic model and by reducing the sigmoid curve to a step function, they miss an important information about the control signal, namely how the spiking efficiency increases with stimulus intensity. Here, this spiking efficiency is taken into account in a compartment model of the Hodgkin Huxley type where a noise current is added in every compartment with an active membrane. A key parameter of the model is a common factor knoise which defines the ion current fluctuations across the cell membrane for every compartment by its maximum sodium ion conductance. In the standard model Gaussian signals are changed every 2.5 μs as a compromise of accuracy and computational costs. Additionally, a formula for other noise transmission times is presented and numerically tested. Spiking probability as a function of stimulus intensity can be approximated by the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution with RS = σ/μ. Relative spread RS, introduced by Verveen, is a measure for the spread (normalized by the threshold intensity μ), that decreases inversely with axon diameter. Dynamic range, a related measure used in neuroprosthetic studies, defines the intensity range between 10% and 90% spiking probability. We show that (i) the dynamic range normalized by threshold is 2.56 times RS, (ii) RS increases with electrode—axon distance and (iii) we present knoise values for myelinated and unmyelinated axon models in agreement with recoded RS data. The presented method is applicable for other membrane models and can be extended to whole neurons that are described by multi-compartment models."
https://openalex.org/W4224272967,"Looking and reaching are controlled by different brain regions and are coordinated during natural behaviour1. Understanding how flexible, natural behaviours such as coordinated looking and reaching are controlled depends on understanding how neurons in different regions of the brain communicate2. Neural coherence in a gamma-frequency (40-90 Hz) band has been implicated in excitatory multiregional communication3. Inhibitory control mechanisms are also required to flexibly control behaviour4, but little is known about how neurons in one region transiently suppress individual neurons in another to support behaviour. How neuronal firing in a sender region transiently suppresses firing in a receiver region remains poorly understood. Here we study inhibitory communication during a flexible, natural behaviour, termed gaze anchoring, in which saccades are transiently inhibited by coordinated reaches. During gaze anchoring, we found that neurons in the reach region of the posterior parietal cortex can inhibit neuronal firing in the parietal saccade region to suppress eye movements and improve reach accuracy. Suppression is transient, only present around the coordinated reach, and greatest when reach neurons fire spikes with respect to beta-frequency (15-25 Hz) activity, not gamma-frequency activity. Our work provides evidence in the activity of single neurons for a novel mechanism of inhibitory communication in which beta-frequency neural coherence transiently inhibits multiregional communication to flexibly coordinate natural behaviour."

In Egypt, GC has a low incidence but unfortunately, it is mostly diagnosed at an advanced stage with a poor prognosis. Assessment of novel markers that can be used in the early detection of GC is an urgent need. The present study was performed to assess the association of the Pleckstrin homology domain-containing S1 (PLEKHS1)، arylacetamide deacetylase (AADAC, and Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 3 (CDKN3) genes with GC and to correlate their gene expression levels with tumor stage, grade, and other clinicopathological features. The current work was performed on forty gastric tissue samples; twenty in Group 1 with GC tissues at different stages, and grades and twenty in Group 2 (control group) with non-tumorous tissue. PLEKHS1, AADAC, and CDKN3 gene expression were assessed by RT-qPCR. AADAC, CDKN3 genes were significantly (p<0.001) upregulated, while PLEKHS1 gene was significantly (p<0.001) downregulated in the GC group than the control group. AADAC gene expression exhibited a high significant (p<0.001) positive correlation with the tumor grades and the tumor stages. A high significant negative correlation between AADAC, and CDKN3 gene expression (r = -.760, p<0.001) was found. The three studied parameters showed high significant sensitivity and specificity in the prediction of the presence of GC. PLEKHS1, AADAC, and CDKN3 gene expressions were suggested to be used as diagnostic and predictive biomarkers of GC, additionally, AADAC may be used as a prognostic marker in these patients for further future confirming studies."
https://openalex.org/W4224264477,"Objective The coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19) increased the risk of shortage in intensive care devices, including fittings with intentional leaks. 3D-printing has been used worldwide to produce missing devices. Here we provide key elements towards better quality control of 3D-printed ventilation fittings in a context of sanitary crisis. Material and methods Five 3D-printed designs were assessed for non-intentional (junctional and parietal) and intentional leaks: 4 fittings 3D-printed in-house using FDeposition Modelling (FDM), 1 FDM 3D-printed fitting provided by an independent maker, and 2 fittings 3D-printed in-house using Polyjet technology. Five industrial models were included as controls. Two values of wall thickness and the use of coating were tested for in-house FDM-printed devices. Results Industrial and Polyjet-printed fittings had no parietal and junctional leaks, and satisfactory intentional leaks. In-house FDM-printed fittings had constant parietal leaks without coating, but this post-treatment method was efficient in controlling parietal sealing, even in devices with thinner walls (0.7 mm vs 2.3 mm). Nevertheless, the use of coating systematically induced absent or insufficient intentional leaks. Junctional leaks were constant with FDM-printed fittings but could be controlled using rubber junctions rather than usual rigid junctions. The properties of Polyjet-printed and FDM-printed fittings were stable over a period of 18 months. Conclusions 3D-printing is a valid technology to produce ventilation devices but requires care in the choice of printing methods, raw materials, and post-treatment procedures. Even in a context of sanitary crisis, devices produced outside hospitals should be used only after professional quality control, with precise data available on printing protocols. The mechanical properties of ventilation devices are crucial for efficient ventilation, avoiding rebreathing of CO 2, and preventing the dispersion of viral particles that can contaminate health professionals. Specific norms are still required to formalise quality control procedures for ventilation fittings, with the rise of 3D-printing initiatives and the perspective of new pandemics."
https://openalex.org/W4224210825,"During a medical surge, resource scarcity and other factors influence the performance of the healthcare systems. To enhance their performance, hospitals need to identify the critical indicators that affect their operations for better decision-making. This study aims to model a pertinent set of indicators for improving emergency departments' (ED) performance during a medical surge. The framework comprises a three-stage process to survey, evaluate, and rank such indicators in a systematic approach. The first stage consists of a survey based on the literature and interviews to extract quality indicators that impact the EDs' performance. The second stage consists of forming a panel of medical professionals to complete the survey questionnaire and applying our proposed consensus-based modified fuzzy Delphi method, which integrates text mining to address the fuzziness and obtain the sentiment scores in expert responses. The final stage ranks the indicators based on their stability and convergence. Here, twenty-nine potential indicators are extracted in the first stage, categorized into five healthcare performance factors, are reduced to twenty consentaneous indicators monitoring ED's efficacy. The Mann-Whitney test confirmed the stability of the group opinions (p < 0.05). The agreement percentage indicates that ED beds (77.8%), nurse staffing per patient seen (77.3%), and length of stay (75.0%) are among the most significant indicators affecting the ED's performance when responding to a surge. This research proposes a framework that helps hospital administrators determine essential indicators to monitor, manage, and improve the performance of EDs systematically during a surge event."
https://openalex.org/W4224229093,"Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is the most common biliary tract malignancy with a dismal prognosis. The development of new drugs may help to improve prognosis. This study found that fangchinoline, a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids, inhibited the proliferation and clone formation of GBC cells in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, Hoechst staining, TUNEL assays, and flow cytometry demonstrated that fangchinoline effectively induced apoptosis in GBC cells. Further studies found that an anti-apoptotic pathway, the PI3K/Akt/XIAP axis, was significantly inhibited in GBC cells after treating with fangchinoline. Finally, we confirmed that fangchinoline restrained xenograft tumor growth in vivo. Our findings indicate that fangchinoline can be considered a potential drug for GBC treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4224230567,"The object detection of remote sensing image often has low accuracy and high missed or false detection rate due to the large number of small objects, instance level noise and cloud occlusion. In this paper, a new object detection model based on SRGAN and YOLOV3 is proposed, which is called SR-YOLO. It solves the problems of SRGAN network sensitivity to hyper-parameters and modal collapse. Meanwhile, The FPN network in YOLOv3 is replaced by PANet, shortened the distance between the lowest and the highest layers, and the SR-YOLO model has strong robustness and high detection ability by using the enhanced path to enrich the characteristics of each layer. The experimental results on the UCAS-High Resolution Aerial Object Detection Dataset showed SR-YOLO has achieved excellent performance. Compared with YOLOv3, the average precision (AP) of SR-YOLO increased from 92.35% to 96.13%, the log-average miss rate (MR-2) decreased from 22% to 14%, and the Recall rate increased from 91.36% to 95.12%."

https://openalex.org/W4224237062,"The uncontrolled spread of (mis)information, news and propaganda related to COVID 19 created an 'infodemic' leading to panic and unscientific practices among the mass. With the largest number of internet users in the world, India has witnessed a steep rise in the number of people seeking information on social media related to COVID-19, which reached a staggering 22.3 million by March, 2020. This study aimed to evaluate the trend of COVID-19 associated food and nutrition news search by Indian internet users between 27th January 2020 to 30th June 2021 (time period between the first detected COVID-19 case and the end of the second wave in India) and its impact on their perceptions and practices. The association between the change in Relative Search Volume (RSV) on Google Trends (GT) of 34 popularly searched keywords classified by the researchers under 5 different categories-""Immunity"", ""Eating behavior"", ""Food safety"", ""Food scares and concerns"" and ""Covid scare"" showed a steep rise in search for immunity boosters, vitamin supplement brands ""ayush kadha (ayurvedic decoction) during the first wave (April- August 2020). With a brief period of decline in the search trend, it again hiked correspondingly with the growing number of positive cases during the second wave in India. An online survey conducted on adult Indian internet users (n = 572) reported high (71.9%) consumption of Vitamin C rich fruits as well as Vitamin C (68.2%) and Zinc (61.4%) supplements to boost immunity. Traditional Indian spices like ginger and garlic were used by 62.9% and 50.9% respondents respectively. Most respondents reported to rely on social media for gathering COVID-19 associated tips for boosting immunity, however those with history of COVID-19 infection reported to rely more on doctors and health professionals for information. This study highlights the need of media and health literacy to advocate for the use of health information cautiously."
https://openalex.org/W4224242354,"Identifying differentially expressed genes between experimental conditions is still the gold-standard approach to interpret transcriptomic profiles. Alternative approaches based on diversity measures have been proposed to complement the interpretation of such datasets but are only used marginally.Here, we reinvestigated diversity measures, which are commonly used in ecology, to characterize mice pregnancy microenvironments based on a public transcriptome dataset. Mainly, we evaluated the Tsallis entropy function to explore the potential of a collection of diversity measures for capturing relevant molecular event information.We demonstrate that the Tsallis entropy function provides additional information compared to the traditional diversity indices, such as the Shannon and Simpson indices. Depending on the relative importance given to the most abundant transcripts based on the Tsallis entropy function parameter, our approach allows appreciating the impact of biological stimulus on the inter-individual variability of groups of samples. Moreover, we propose a strategy for reducing the complexity of transcriptome datasets using a maximation of the beta diversity.We highlight that a diversity-based analysis is suitable for capturing complex molecular events occurring during physiological events. Therefore, we recommend their use through the Tsallis entropy function to analyze transcriptomics data in addition to differential expression analyses."
https://openalex.org/W4224248562,"The COVID-19 pandemic was a potent stressor, yielding unprecedented levels of mental distress. However, public health responses and personal reactions to the pandemic were politically polarized, with Democrats highlighting and Republicans downplaying its severity. Did Republicans subsequently experience as much mental distress as Democrats during the COVID-19 pandemic? This study examines partisan patterns in mental health outcomes at three time points throughout the pandemic. Results demonstrate a clear partisan distress gap, with Democrats consistently reporting worse mental health than Republicans. Trend data suggest that the 2020 pandemic patterns are a continuation and exacerbation of an existing partisan distress gap. Consideration of race, however, demonstrates a widening partisan distress gap, specific to white Americans. Among white Americans, therefore, Democrats experienced a substantially greater increase in distress in response to the pandemic than Republicans."
https://openalex.org/W4224255686,"The results of a simulation-based evaluation of several policies for vaccine rollout are reported, particularly focusing on the effects of delaying the second dose of two-dose vaccines. In the presence of limited vaccine supply, the specific policy choice is a pressing issue for several countries worldwide, and the adopted course of action will affect the extension or easing of non-pharmaceutical interventions in the next months. We employ a suitably generalised, age-structure, stochastic SEIR (Susceptible → Exposed → Infectious → Removed) epidemic model that can accommodate quantitative descriptions of the major effects resulting from distinct vaccination strategies. The different rates of social contacts among distinct age-groups (as well as some other model parameters) are informed by a recent survey conducted in Greece, but the conclusions are much more widely applicable. The results are summarised and evaluated in terms of the total number of deaths and infections as well as life years lost. The optimal strategy is found to be one based on fully vaccinating the elderly/at risk as quickly as possible, while extending the time-interval between the two vaccine doses to 12 weeks for all individuals below 75 years old, in agreement with epidemic theory which suggests targeting a combination of susceptibility and infectivity. This policy, which is similar to the approaches adopted in the UK and in Canada, is found to be effective in reducing deaths and life years lost in the period while vaccination is still being carried out."

https://openalex.org/W4225907467,"Background The correct estimation of fibre orientations is a crucial step for reconstructing human brain tracts. Bayesian Estimation of Diffusion Parameters Obtained using Sampling Techniques ( bedpostx ) is able to estimate several fibre orientations and their diffusion parameters per voxel using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in a whole brain diffusion MRI data, and it is capable of running on GPUs, achieving speed-up of over 100 times compared to CPUs. However, few studies have looked at whether the results from the CPU and GPU algorithms differ. In this study, we compared CPU and GPU bedpostx outputs by running multiple trials of both algorithms on the same whole brain diffusion data and compared each distribution of output using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. Results We show that distributions of fibre fraction parameters and principal diffusion direction angles from bedpostx and bedpostx_gpu display few statistically significant differences in shape and are localized sparsely throughout the whole brain. Average output differences are small in magnitude compared to underlying uncertainty. Conclusions Despite small amount of differences in output between CPU and GPU bedpostx algorithms, results are comparable given the difference in operation order and library usage between CPU and GPU bedpostx ."
https://openalex.org/W4224238915,"Purpose To devise a new body-habitus normalizer to be used in the calculation of an SUV that is specific to the PET tracer 18 F-FDG. Methods A cohort of 481-patients was selected for analysis of 18 F-FDG uptake into tissues unaffected by their disease. Among these, 65-patients had only brain concentrations measured and the remaining 416 were randomly divided into an 86-patient test set and a 330-patient training set. Within the test set, normal liver, spleen and blood measures were made. In the training set, only normal liver concentrations were measured. Using data from the training set, a simple polynomial function of height and weight was selected and optimized in a fitting procedure to predict each patient’s mean liver %ID/ml. This function, when used as a normalizer, defines a new SUV metric (SUV fdg ) which we compared to SUV metrics normalized by body weight (SUV bw ), lean-body mass (SUV lbm ) and body surface-area (SUV bsa ) in a five-fold cross-validation. SUV fdg was also evaluated in the independent brain-only and whole-body test sets. Results For patients of all sizes including pediatric patients, the normal range of liver 18 F-FDG uptake at 60 minutes post injection in units of SUV fdg is 1.0 ± 0.16. Liver, blood, and spleen SUV fdg in all comparisons had lower coefficients of variation compared to SUV bw SUV lbm and SUV bsa . Blood had a mean SUV fdg of 0.8 ± 0.11 and showed no correlation with age, height, or weight. Brain SUV fdg measures were significantly higher (P&lt;0.01) in pediatric patients (4.7 ± 0.9) compared to adults (3.1 ± 0.6). Conclusion A new SUV metric, SUV fdg , is proposed. It is hoped that SUV fdg will prove to be better at classifying tumor lesions compared to SUV metrics in current use. Other tracers may benefit from similarly tracer-specific body habitus normalizers."

https://openalex.org/W4224260489,"Researchers cannot keep up with the volume of articles being published each year. In order to develop adequate expertise in a given field of study, students and early career scientists must be strategic in what they decide to read. Here we propose using citation network analysis to characterize the literature topology of a given area. We used the human aggression literature as our example. Our citation network analysis identified 15 research communities on aggression. The five largest communities were: ""media and video games"", ""stress, traits and aggression"", ""rumination and displaced aggression"", ""role of testosterone"", and ""social aggression"". We examined the growth of these research communities over time, and we used graph theoretic approaches to identify the most influential papers within each community and the ""bridging"" articles that linked distinct communities to one another. Finally, we also examined whether our citation network analysis would help mitigate gender bias relative to focusing on total citation counts. The percentage of articles with women first authors doubled when identifying influential articles by community structure versus citation count. Our approach of characterizing literature topologies using citation network analysis may provide a valuable resource for psychological scientists by outlining research communities and their growth over time, identifying influential papers within each community (including bridging papers), and providing opportunities to increase gender equity in the field."
https://openalex.org/W4224262263,"We aimed to explore factors affecting family health management during home quarantine as well as the effects of variations in family health management (FHM) on individuals' health status.Using stratified random sampling, 618 families in Wuhan as well as cities within its surrounding provinces were recruited and surveyed online. Latent class variables were extracted from four modules: disinfection, space layout, physical exercise, and food reserves. The analysis was conducted using the poLCA package in R software (v.4.1.0). Chi-squared tests, Fisher's exact tests, and non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare groups as appropriate.We found an overall questionnaire reliability of 0.77 and a total omega of 0.92, indicating that the survey results were credible. The Bayesian information criterion and Akaike information criterion were used to identified four latent class variables, namely latent non-family health management (18.9%) and latent low, medium, and advanced FHM (30.93%, 29.49%, and 20.59%, respectively). Gender, household income level, body mass index, the presence of a nearby community hospital, and self-rated health status showed statistically significant differences with respect to latent FHM. Moreover, we found a statistically significant difference in emotional reactions when comparing latent advanced and low to mid-level latent FHM. Compared with latent non-family health managers, we detected statistically significant differences in individual energy levels between potential family health managers at latent low and medium levels. Additionally, we found statistically significant differences in individual energy levels between latent advanced and low level family health managers.We found that multiple factors, including gender, household income, and body mass index, were correlated with latent FHM during home quarantine. We conclude that FHM can meaningfully improve individuals' health. Thus, increasing social support for individuals can improve FHM as well as individuals' health during home quarantine."
https://openalex.org/W4224285004,"Glutamine binding protein (GlnBP) is an Escherichia Coli periplasmic binding protein, which binds and carries glutamine to the inner membrane ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. GlnBP binds the ligand with affinity around 0.1μM measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and ligand binding stabilizes protein structure shown by its increase in thermodynamic stability. However, the molecular determinant of GlnBP ligand binding is not known. Electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction between GlnBP and glutamine are critical factors. We propose that the freedome of closure movement is also vital for ligand binding. In order to approve this hypothesis, we generate a series of mutants with different linker length that has different magnitude of domain closure. Mutants show different ligand binding affinity, which indicates that the propensity of domain closure determines the ligand binding affinity. Ligand binding triggers gradual ensemble conformational change. Structural changes upon ligand binding are monitored by combination of small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and NMR spectroscopy. Detailed structure characterization of GlnBP contributes to a better understanding of ligand binding and provides the structural basis for biosensor design."
