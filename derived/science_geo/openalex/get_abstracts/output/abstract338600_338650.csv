https://openalex.org/W2147521920,"The oxidation of sulfide, generated by bacterial sulfate reduction, is a key process in the biogeochemistry of marine sediments, yet the pathways and oxidants are poorly known. By the use of (35)S-tracer studies of the S cycle in marine and freshwater sediments, a novel shunt function of thiosulfate (S(2)O(3)(2-)) was identified. The S(2)O(3)(2-) constituted 68 to 78 percent of the immediate HS(-)-oxidation products and was concurrently (i) reduced back to HS(-), (ii) oxidized to SO(4)(2-), and (iii) disproportionated to HS(-) + SO(4)(2-). The small thiosulfate pool is thus involved in a dynamic HS(-) - S(2)O(3)(2-) cycle in anoxic sediments. The disproportionation of thiosulfate may help account for the large difference in isotopic composition ((34)S/(32)S) of sulfate and sulfides in sediments and sedimentary rocks."
https://openalex.org/W2059155664,"The atomic force microscope (AFM) was used to image an electrode surface at atomic resolution while the electrode was under potential control in a fluid electrolyte. A new level of subtlety was observed for each step of a complete electrochemical cycle that started with an Au(111) surface onto which bulk Cu was electrodeposited. The Cu was stripped down to an underpotential-deposited monolayer and finally returned to a bare Au(111) surface. The images revealed that the underpotential-deposited monolayer has different structures in different electrolytes. Specifically, for a perchloric acid electrolyte the Cu atoms are in a close-packed lattice with a spacing of 0.29 +/- 0.02 nanometer (nm). For a sulfate electrolyte they are in a more open lattice with a spacing of 0.49 +/- 0.02 nm. As the deposited Cu layer grew thicker, the Cu atoms converged to a (111)-oriented layer with a lattice spacing of 0.26 +/- 0.02 nm for both electrolytes. A terrace pattern was observed during dissolution of bulk Cu. Images were obtained of an atomically resolved Cu monolayer in one region and an atomically resolved Au substrate in another in which a 30 degrees rotation of the Cu monolayer lattice from the Au lattice is clearly visible."

The validity of this view for reaction systems can be experimentally probed by examination of the chemistry of electronically excited states and, in particular, by comparison of the reactivities of states having different orbital occupations (electron configurations). Reactivity changes associated with electron configuration are instructive with regard to chemists' views of molecular orbital interactions, but electronic excitation can also influence the course of a chemical reaction by increasing the energy content of the system or by affecting access to different potential energy surfaces by changing spin, orbital symmetry, or spin-orbit level. These various effects are illustrated by studies of gasphase transition metal-mediated H-H and C-H bond-activation processes."

These are important in corroborating the intermediate evolutionary position of archaeocetes between generalized Paleocene land mammals that used hind limbs in locomotion and Oligocene-to- Recent whales that lack functional pelvic limbs. The foot is paraxonic, consistent with derivation from mesonychid Condylarthra. Hind limbs of Basilosaurus are interpreted as copulatory guides."
https://openalex.org/W2030085775,"It is becoming increasingly apparent that chemistry at surfaces, whether it be heterogeneous catalysis, semiconductors etching, or chemical vapor deposition, is controlled by much more than the nature and structure of the surface. Recent experiments that principally make use of molecular beam techniques have revealed that the energy at which an incident molecule collides with a surface can be the key factor in determining its reactivity with or on the surface. In addition, the collision energy of an incident particle has proven essential to the finding of new mechanisms for reaction or desorption of molecules at surfaces, collision-induced activation and collision-induced desorption. These phenomena are often responsible for the different surface chemistry observed under conditions of high reactant pressure, such as those present during a heterogeneous catalytic reaction, and of low pressure of reactants (< 10(-4) torr), such as those present in an ultrahigh vacuum surface science experiment. This knowledge of the microscopic origins of the effect of pressure on the chemistry at surfaces has allowed the development of a scheme to bypass the high-pressure requirement. Reactions that are normally observed only at high reactant pressures, and which are the ones most often of practical importance, can now be carried out in low-pressure, ultrahigh vacuum environments."
https://openalex.org/W2075435262,"The locations of surface ruptures and the main shock epicenter indicate that the disastrous Guatemala earthquake of 4 February 1976 was tectonic in origin and generated mainly by slip on the Motagua fault, which has an arcuate roughly east-west trend across central Guatemala. Fault breakage was observed for 230 km. Displacement is predominantly horizontal and sinistral with a maximum measured offset of 340 cm and an average of about 100 cm. Secondary fault breaks trending roughly north-northeast to south-southwest have been found in a zone about 20 km long and 8 km wide extending from the western suburbs of Guatemala City to near Mixco, and similar faults with more subtle surface expression probably occur elsewhere in the Guatemalan Highlands. Displacements on the secondary faults are predominantly extensional and dip-slip, with as much as 15 cm vertical offset on a single fracture. The primary fault that broke during the earthquake involved roughly 10 percent of the length of the great transform fault system that defines the boundary between the Caribbean and North American plates. The observed sinistral displacement is striking confirmation of deductions regarding the late Cenozoic relative motion between these two crustal plates that were based largely on indirect geologic and geophysical evidence. The earthquake-related secondary faulting, together with the complex pattern of geologically young normal faults that occur in the Guatemalan Highlands and elsewhere in western Central America, suggest that the eastern wedge-shaped part of the Caribbean plate, roughly between the Motagua fault system and the volcanic arc, is being pulled apart in tension and left behind as the main mass of the plate moves relatively eastward. Because of their proximity to areas of high population density, shallow-focus earthquakes that originate on the Motagua fault system, on the system of predominantly extensional faults within the western part of the Caribbean plate, and in association with volcanism may pose a more serious seismic hazard than the more numerous (but generally more distant) earthquakes that are generated in the eastward-dipping subduction zone beneath Middle America."

However, they also possess almost unique attributes for use in biomedicine as reconstructive plastics or as drug-carrier molecules. Moreover, their possible value as ""pseudo-protein"" model polymers is an exciting prospect."

https://openalex.org/W2026650065,"Arecibo high-resolution radar images of the southern hemisphere of Venus extending to 78 degrees S show that the surface of the Themis-Alpha-Lada region is characterized by linear deformation zones with volcanoes and corona-like features and by regional volcanic deposits (primarily plains, small shields, and large edifices). Large-scale areal deformation is limited to the tessera of Alpha Regio. Lada Terra, in the southern high latitudes, contains several large coronae, in contrast to Ishtar Terra in the northern high latitudes. The density of craters of possible impact origin is somewhat lower than that observed in the Venera 15 and 16 coverage; these data extend to 43 percent of the areas of the surface of Venus with ages of less than about 1 billion years."
https://openalex.org/W2018765460,"Widespread proposals to benefit from lessons of the 17 October 1989 (Loma Prieta) earthquake dramatize the difficulties associated with reducing seismic risk. There are three main problems. First, the understanding of earthquake generation is far from complete. For example, the unanticipated source style of this earthquake raises vital questions; claims of predicting its occurrence are weak, and, for practical reasons, the detailed pattern of damaging strong ground shaking was not predicted. Second, although their interactions are not well understood, competing social forces continue to prevent the optimum growth and application of knowledge for earthquake hazard mitigation. Third, the recent use of the probabilities of seismic risk has had mixed results. Because of indecision between minimizing loss of life and maximizing broader benefits, general agreement on acceptable earthquake risk remains confused."
https://openalex.org/W1995985643,"The automobile industry's unwillingness to put passive restraint systems into all their cars, safety standards making air bags coupled with the retaining lap belt standard equipment on all new cars, and the alternatives regarding this issue which face the Transportation Secretary are discussed. Auto manufacturers who want the secretary to allow them to provide only the active restraint system argue that with improved and more comfortable belts, usage will increase. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) however estimates that voluntary usage will never exceed about 40 percent. The requirement that passive restraint systems be offered as options could lead to discouragingly high costs. It is noted that no statistically significant comparison between the effectiveness of air bags and that of belts can be drawn from the present limited experience. Comments are also made on the relation between automobile safety regulation and health welfare services, and insurance."

https://openalex.org/W1974532504,"PASCHEN (Ann. d. Phy. 71, p. 152, 1923), in his investigation of the spectrum of doubly ionised aluminum (Al. III.), and Fowler (“Series in Line Spectra,” p. 120), in his study of ionised magnesium (Mg. II.), have pointed out the type of series relations which exist in these substances, and have arranged many lines to conform to them. In a study 01 the spectra of both aluminum and magnesium in the extreme ultra-violet, under various forms of excitation, I have recently observed certain lines which appear to be higher members of some of the series discovered by Paschen and by Fowler ; Millikan has already identified the two strongest, but the remainder seem to have escaped observation. The wave-lengths and the series to which these lines belong are given in the following tables."
