https://openalex.org/W2000777523,"Measurements of the attachment of the PAM 212 line of mouse epithelial cells to various collagen substrates show that these cells adhere preferentially to type IV, basement membrane collagen. Neither serum nor fibronectin stimulated the attachment of these cells (unlike fibroblasts) to type IV collagen. Preincubation of the PAM 212 cells with cycloheximide prevented attachment. Thus these cells do not attach by means of a macromolecule present inserum, but instead synthesize an attachment factor. Extracts of the EHS tumor, which produces an extracellular matrix containing basement membrane components, were tested for their ability to promote attachment to cycloheximide-treated PAM 212 cells. Saline extracts of the tumor stimulated the attachment of the PAM 212 cells to type IV collagen in the presence of cycloheximide. Laminin, a high molecular weight glycoprotein constituent of basement membrane, was purified from the salt extract and was found to be the active species at concentrations as low as 1-5 microgram/ml. When laminin was preincubated on plates coated with either type I, II, III, IV, or V collagen and the plates subsequently washed, high levels of attachment were seen only on type IV collagen-coated plates. Affinity purified antibody directed against laminin inhibited the attachment of PAM 212 cells to a type IV collagen substrate. Laminin appears to be a specific attachment protein for epithelial cells since it did not stimulate the attachment of fibroblasts to type I or to type IV collagen substrates. These data suggest that lamin is produced and utilized by these epithelial cells to attach to basement membrane collagen."

One of these analogs, 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP), influences human learning and memory. Cognitively unimpaired, as well as cognitively impaired adults, treated with DDAVP for a period of several days, learn information more effectively, as measured by the completeness, organization, and consistency (reliability) of recall. DDAVP also appears to reverse partially the retrograde amnesia that follows electroconvulsive treatment."

Successful development of th parasitoid egg within the host depends on the presence of th virus, which acts to suppress the host's immune response (encapsulation) toward the egg. This is an example of obligatory mutualism between a virus and a eukaryotic organism."
https://openalex.org/W2090631455,"We have determined the size and sequence of 8 exons in the gene that specifies chick type 1 alpha 2 collagen. These 8 exons represent three different segments of the gene, but all encode information for the helical portion of the protein. Seven exons have a length of 54 bp, and the 8th has a size of 99 bp. The sequences within these exons vary except for th glycine codons, which occur every third triplet. Each exon begins with a glycine codon and ends with a triplet that precedes a glycine codon. The size and the sequences of the introns do not show any homology except at their ends. Of 7 introns examined the first six bases at the 5' end of 5 of these are identical. The sequences at the 3' end of the introns also show homologies. Our results imply that the ancestral gene for collagen arose by multiple duplications of a single genetic unit containing a 54 bp condig segment. The sequences within these exons drifted by successive point mutations and in some cases by additions or deletions of 9 bp or multiples of 9 bp."
https://openalex.org/W2121349955,"We have isolated the hamster gene coding for the enzyme adenine phosphoribosyl transferase (aprt) using gene transfer and molecular cloning of transforming DNA. Mouse aprt- cells were transformed to the aprt+ phenotype with the product of ligation of Hind III-cleaved hamster genomic DNA and pBR322 DNA. In this manner, the aprt gene was linked to a marked plasmid sequence and segregated from other hamster sequences. A lambda-recombinant phage containing pBR322 DNA sequences was isolated from a library of aprt+ transformed cell DNA. The phage DNA transfers hamster aprt+ activity at a frequency expected of a pure gene. Furthermore, sequences homologous to this clone are present in all hamster aprt+ transformants examined. This experimental design should in theory permit the isolation of any gene coding for selectable or identifiable functions for which DNA-mediated gene transfer can be effected."

Orthodox molecular models often bear a tenuous relationship to the coordinate data. In contrast, computer graphics requires that the display directly and accurately represent the data, and storage of modified configurations and recovery of original structures are simple. Software has been developed that allows real-time display of color line and surface displays of several interacting molecules, while quantitatively monitoring the stereochemistry."
https://openalex.org/W1577498935,"Significant increases in lysophosphatidylcholine from a basal level of 4.2 +/- 0.36 nmol/mg of platelet protein to 6.4 +/- 0.46 nmol/mg of protein occur within 20 s after the addition of thrombin (5 units/ml) to washed human platelets. The increases are essentially complete by 1 min, at which time levels of 8.5 +/- 0.53 nmol of lysophosphatidylcholine/mg of platelet protein are reached. Decreases in phosphatidylcholine and also phosphatidylethanolamine occur within 20 s after stimulation of platelets by thrombin. These changes were detected by quantitative measurements of endogenous phospholipid phosphorus after extraction and thin layer chromatography of the platelet lipids. The concomitant increases in lysophosphatidylcholine and decreases in phosphatidylcholine, as well as the decreases in phosphatidylethanolamine, can only be explained by the stimulation of phospholipase A2 activity in platelets by thrombin."

Compared to apolipoprotein E from normal subjects, apolipoprotein E isolated from subjects with type III HLP had a decreased fractional catabolic rate in vivo in both type III HLP patients and normal individuals. The delayed catabolism of apolipoprotein E in type III HLP patients may be responsible for the lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities characteristic of these patients."

https://openalex.org/W1991757154,"The electrical membrane properties of axotomized and regenerating giant axons from the nerve cord of the cockroach Periplaneta americana were studied. Immediately after axotomy there was a decrease in resting potential, input resistance, and action potential amplitude near the cut end. This decrease was followed by the disappearance of the sodium-dependent action potential; an increase in the resting membrane conductance to K+, Na+, and Ca2+; and the appearance of a calcium-dependent action potential."
https://openalex.org/W2021069133,"RNA metabolism during amphibian oogenesis has been investigated by the analysis of individual cDNA cloned sequences. Two cDNA clone libraries were constructed from the pA+ RNA of Xenopus ovary and of tadpole. The accumulation of RNAs complementary to individual clones was examined during oogenesis by isolating RNA from oocytes of different stages. There are only two patterns of accumulation during oogenesis. Mitochondrial mRNA sequences accumulate throughout all the stages of oogenesis, whereas all other sequences detected cease accumulation early in oogenesis and remain at a constant steady state level for the remainder of oocyte development. In the earliest stages examined, the individual RNAs are already present at approximately their final level, and the subsequent increase of all sequences appears to be coordinant. These basic observations were confirmed by colony screening approximately 500 clones. The pattern of RNA accumulation observed is significant, because it had been determined that the total steady state pA+ RNA levels in the oocyte also ceased to increase at the same stage in oogenesis in which each individual sequenced reached a plateau level. In addition, lampbrush chromosomes, which have traditionally been thought to be the site of oocyte pA+ RNA synthesis, are maximally active after the stage in which all pA+ RNAs seem to have reached their final level of accumulation."

This downturn represents a new nonsmoking ethos, which is also reflected in the legislative successes of the nonsmokers' rights movement. Time series regression analysis of cigarette demand suggests that, in the absence of the antismoking campaign, consumption would have exceeded its 1978 level by more than a third."
https://openalex.org/W1520194152,"S-Adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (EC 3.3.1.1) from rat liver was purified to homogeneity. The enzyme had a molecular weight of 188,000 and was composed of 4 subunits with a molecular weight of 47,000. The isoelectric pH of the enzyme was at 5.7. The Km values for S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine, adenosine, and DL-homocysteine were 15.2 microM, 1.05 microM, and 155 microM, respectively, at pH 7.2 and 25 degrees C. The enzyme showed a fluorescence with an emission maximum at 350 nm when excited at 280 nm. The protein fluorescence was partially quenched on addition of adenosine. The fluorescence quenching as a function of adenosine concentration indicated that the enzyme contained four binding sites for adenosine per molecule. The same data provided a value of 0.63 microM for the dissociation constant of adenosine. The enzyme possessed 4 mol of tightly bound NAD+/mol. The addition of adenosine to the enzyme caused the appearance of a peak at 327 nm in a concentration-dependent manner. The enzyme-bound NAD+ readily formed an adduct with bisulfite with the concomitant loss of enzyme activity. These data suggest that the bound NAD+ is involved in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1488653535,A simplified procedure for isolation of specific mRNA using Staphylococcus aureus protein A immunoadsorbent chromatography has been developed. This procedure has been applied to the mRNA encoding Trypanosoma brucei variable surface antigen. Trypanosome polyribosomes were reacted with antibodies isolated from an anti-variable antigen-specific serum by protein A-Sepharose column chromatography. Antibody-bound variable antigen-synthesizing polyribosomes were then separated from unbound polyribosomes also by protein A-Sepharose column chromatography. This simple protocol gave a greater than 50% yield of variable antigen-specific mRNA which appeared to be very highly purified as determined by translation in an mRNA-dependent reticulocyte lysate assay. The mRNAs encoding three different T. brucei surface antigens have been purified. The procedure described here should be useful in purification of other mRNAs.
https://openalex.org/W2050701315,"Abstract Hybrids between two mouse lymphoma cell lines, the glucocorticoid sensitive S49.1 and the resistant EL4 line, are sensitive to the cytolytic steroid effect as long as they retain the S49.1 specific glucocorticoid receptor and the complete chromosome complements contributed by both parental lines. With the use of the semisynthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone, resistant segregants (dex R ) have been isolated which have lost the S49.1 specific receptor but retain the EL4 type of receptor. On the average these segregants have also lost one chromosome. We have carried out a detailed karyotype analysis of both parental cell lines and their hybrids using trypsin-Giemsa banding for chromosome identification. S49.1 cells contain 40 apparently normal chromosomes with monosomy X and trisomy 1. EL4 cells have 39 chromosomes, half of which are structurally abnormal. In addition to low levels of random karyotypic variability in S49.1 × EL4 hybrids we have observed one consistent difference between sensitive (dex s ) and dex R sublines: sensitive hybrids contained three chromosomes 18 while resistant segregants only had two. We were able to distinguish both chromosomes 18 contributed by the S49.1 parent and the one from the EL4 cell line by structural variations involving the centromeric heterochromatin and the nucleolar organizer regions. A specific chromosome 18 derived from S49.1 was consistently absent in 3 dex R segregant lines derived from different dex s hybrid clones. Since the dex R segregant hybrids have lost the S49.1 specific glucocorticoid receptor we conclude that the gene for the receptor is located on that chromosome 18 which is consistently lost. The other S49.1 derived 18 presumably carries a mutant or silent receptor gene, as S49.1 has previously been shown to have hemizygous levels of the receptor. This study demonstrates the usefulness of intraspecies somatic cell hybrids for mapping purposes. The overall karyotypic stability of such hybrids allows the identification of specific chromosomes eliminated by selection pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2081667354,"Ribosomal genes of Physarum polycephalum are located on multiple copies of an extrachromosomal, 61 kb rDNA palindrome. Each terminus of the palindrome consists of a nontranscribed spacer, averaging 5.4 kb in length, which includes a region of multiple inverted repeat sequences. Electron microscopy of denatured and reannealed termini reveals foldback segments that are multiples of a unit length of 50 bp, a length confirmed by sizing of restriction fragments from labeled termini. The total length of this inverted repeat region averages 600 bp per terminus, and the region is centered approximately 4 kb from the 3′ end of the 26S gene. Restriction fragments containing the termini are heterogeneous, varying in length by ± 400 bp. This heterogeneity is due to variability in both the number of 100 bp inverted repeats and the length of additional terminal spacer sequences. The inverted repeat region contains selectively located single-strand discontinuities as revealed by brief incubation with deoxynucleoside α-32P-triphosphates and E. coli DNA polymerase I (nick translation). Labeling at the discontinuities begins specifically with the sequence CCCTA. Discontinuities are nonligatable and are most likely gaps one nucleotide long. Each terminus contains 3 to 5 such gaps spaced approximately 200 bp apart. As measured by hybridization with selectively labeled foldback DNA, sequences homologous to the inverted repeats are widely distributed throughout chromosomal DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1541530534,"Pulse-chase experiments using liver explants incubated in modified Eagle's medium showed that newly synthesized precursor for carbamyl phosphate synthetase (pCPS) passes very rapidly through the cytosolic compartment en route to mitochondria (t 1/2 is approximately 2 min). Since even a small pool of precursor could not be detected in association with mitochondria, processing of pCPS must occur either coincident with or immediately following its transmembrane uptake by the organelle. Treatment of explants with the protease inhibitor, p-aminobenzamidine, however, inhibited normal processing of the precursor. But, rather than accumulate in the cell, newly synthesized pCPS was nonspecifically degraded with kinetics (t 1/2 of 2-3 min) which are consistent with the idea that the precursor was almost instantly degraded upon reaching the blocked processing enzyme in a mitochondrion. The protease inhibitor had little or no effect on synthesis of pCPS. This was determined by isolating polysomes aminobenzamidine; the two polysome preparations were about equally active in synthesizing pCPS in vitro in the presence of an inhibitor of polypeptide chain initiation, aurin tricarboxylic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1986932375,"The Xenopus laevis histone genes have been isolated from a bacteriophage λ library using a cloned cDNA probe to X. laevis H4 mRNA (pX1ch4). Their structural organization has been determined by restriction mapping, blot hybridization and hybridization selection and translation of Xenopus histone mRNAs. They are clustered and probably tandemly arranged but, in contrast to invertebrate histone genes ( Kedes, 1979 Kedes L.H. Histone genes and histone messengers. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 837-870 Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar ), there has been extensive sequence divergence in the spacer regions of the clusters. Also, the order of the genes within individual clusters is not conserved. We report the isolation of two variant histone H1 genes and find that the order of the nucleosomal core histone genes within a cluster containing an H1B gene is different from that found in two clusters containing the H1A gene."
https://openalex.org/W1543009581,"The steady state kinetics of phenazine methosulfate-catalyzed, photosystem I-driven photophosphorylation with spinach thylakoid membranes has been measured. The Km for ADP is 85 +/- 20 microM and the Km for phosphate is 0.58 +/- 0.11 mM. Adenosine-5'-O-(thiodiphosphate) (beta-ThioADP) is a competitive inhibitor with respect to ADP at high phosphate concentrations (Kis = 105 +/- 14 microM), but is a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to phosphate (at all ADP concentrations) and ADP at low phosphate concentrations. Thiophosphate is a competitive inhibitor with respect to phosphate (Kis = 95 +/- 9 microM), but an uncompetitive inhibitor with respect to ADP. ADP also inhibits the rate of phosphorylation at high ADP to phosphate ratios. An ordered Bi Uni mechanism with ADP preceding the binding of phosphate is proposed to explain the kinetic data."
https://openalex.org/W2113130514,"Both the catalytic protein (C) and the guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G/F) of rabbit hepatic adenylate cyclase were solubilized in active form in sodium cholate at high ionic strength. Upon precipitation by (NH4)SO4, C was selectively aggregated such that it was largely excluded from Ultrogel AcA 34 when chromatographed in cholate solution at high ionic strength. G/F eluted with KD congruent to 0.5. Thus C can be completely resolved from G/F by this procedure. Rabbit hepatic C prepared in this way resembles the C activity previously described by us in the cyc- mutant of S49 lymphoma cells (Ross, E. M., Howlett, A. C., Ferguson, K. M., and Gilman, A. G. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 6401-6412). Similarities include 7- to 10-fold stimulation by Mn2+ relative to Mg2+ and a complete lack of sensitivity to fluoride or guanine nucleotides. Reconstitution of hepatic C with hepatic G/F causes restoration of stimulation up to 25-fold by either of these activators in the presence of Mg2+. While C is relatively unstable in cholate under these conditions, especially at temperatures over 4 degrees C, it is stabilized by removal of cholate and by addition of phospholipid. These procedures allow the study of the catalytic protein of adenylate cyclase from a hormone-responsive tissue in the absence of endogenous regulatory protein or membrane lipid and also provide a starting point for the purification of the catalyst."
https://openalex.org/W1507352331,"Abstract Fully liganded hemoglobin carbonyls in solution exhibit infrared and 13C NMR spectra that indicate the normal presence of discrete, rapidly interconverting conformers at the carbon monoxide binding sites. The CO ligands bound to Hb A give infrared bands with vCO = 1968 and 1951 cm-1. With Hb Zurich [beta 63 His leads to Arg], vCO values of 1968, 1958, and 1951 cm-1 are observed. Changing either the temperature (3-32 degrees C) or the pH (4 to 11.9) produces reversible redistributions of individual infrared band intensities without a significant change in the total integrated intensity for all bands; only small shifts in frequency occur. In 13C NMR spectra for 13C16O ligands only one resonance is observed for each type of subunit: alpha A and alpha Zh at approximately 206.4 ppm, beta A at approximately 206.0 ppm, beta Zh at approximately 205.5 ppm, each from tetramethylsilane. Since the multiple conformers observed in infrared spectra are not evident in the 13C NMR spectra, the interconversions among the conformers are considered to be too rapid for the individual conformers to be detected by NMR spectroscopy. Estimated differences in enthalpy and in entropy between the separate conformers range from 1.5 to 5.2 kcal/mol and 6.6 to 11.5 entropy units, respectively. The structural differences between carbonyl conformers are sufficiently great that iron (II)--CO bonding and the reactivity of the individual conformers are expected to vary significantly. These findings demonstrate a dynamic aspect of structure due to the flexibility of the protein at the ligand binding site that is important in any consideration of structure-function or structure-property relationships."
https://openalex.org/W1579348799,"The oxy and carbonmonoxy forms of Hb A and Hb S formed aggregates or gels when dissolved in phosphate buffers at concentrations above their solubility and warmed rapidly to 30 degrees C from 0 degrees C. Kinetic studies showed that although deoxy-Hb A and deoxy-Hb S aggregated with a clear exhibition of a delay time, the oxy and carbonmonoxy forms of Hb A and Hb S did not show a delay time. These results suggest that the deoxy forms of Hb A and Hb S aggregate according to the nucleation-controlled mechanism, while oxy- and carbonmonoxyhemoglobins aggregate by the simple linear aggregation mechanism. It was also found that the gels or aggregates of deoxy-Hb A and carbonmonoxy-Hb S could be converted to crystals by further incubation. The rate of crystallization depended upon the concentration of hemoglobin in the supernatant, with faster crystallization at higher concentrations. Similar experiments with deoxy-Hb C (beta 6 Glu leads to Lys) showed that this hemoglobin also crystallized after aggregation, with both reactions accompanied by a delay time. The activation energy for the crystallization reaction of deoxy-Hb C (100 approximately 150 kcal/mol) was much higher than that for the aggregation reaction (20 kcal/mol). These results suggest that deoxy-Hb A, deoxy-Hb S, and deoxy-Hb C form two types of nuclei that are specific to the formation of gels (or aggregates) or crystals. The concentration of hemoglobin measured after completion of crystallization was much lower than that measured after gelation (or aggregation) and was independent of the initial hemoglobin concentration. This concentration is assumed to be the real solubility of hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1481527895,"The reaction catalyzed by rabbit muscle creatine kinase ATP + creatine in equilibrium ADP + P-creatine has been investigated by 31P NMR. At pH 8.0 and 4 degrees C, the equilibrium constant of the overall reaction [P1][P2]/[S1] [S2] is found to be 0.08, while that for the interconversion step between enzyme-bound substrates and products [E.P1. P2]/[E.S1.S2] is estimated to be approximately 1; the latter value is the same for all other kinases investigated. The rate of interconversion of enzyme-bound substrates and products is approximately 90 s-1 and is not the rate-limiting step of the overall reaction. Of the phosphate groups in enzyme complexes of reactants or products, the 31P chemical shifts of beta-P(ADP) and beta-P[MgADP) change by approximately 2 ppm downfield while all others change by less than 0.8 ppm. In the transition state analog complexes E.MgADP.NO3-.creatine and E.MgADP.HCOO-.creatine, the beta-P(MgADP) signal shows a substantial upfield shift in the direction of the beta-P(MgATP) resonance. The pattern of chemical shifts and line shapes of nucleotide complexes of creatine kinase parallel those for the corresponding complexes of arginine kinase, indicating structural and/or conformational similarity of the phosphate chains of nucleotides bound to the two enzymes. However, a difference in active sites is indicated by the pH independence (pH 6.0 to 9.0) of the chemical shift of the beta-P of MgADP bound to creatine kinase, whereas with arginine kinase this resonance showed a pKa approximately 7.5."
https://openalex.org/W2005186392,"Intravenous infusion of tyrosine (1, 2, or 4 milligrams per kilogram) for 20 to 30 minutes caused dose-dependent increases in the ventricular fibrillation threshold in normal dogs. Administration of valine, a neutral amino acid that competes with tyrosine for uptake at the blood-brain barrier, in a dose equimolar to the most effective dose of tyrosine, slightly decreased the ventricular fibrillation threshold when given alone and significantly blocked elevation of the ventricular fibrillation threshold after tyrosine infusion. Hence, tyrosine, presumably acting in the central nervous system, can protect against certain ventricular arrhythmias."
https://openalex.org/W2069681703,"When cysteine labeled with sulfur-35 is injected into the third ventricle of the rat brain, it is first incorporated into only one of the two populations of neurosecretory granules that can be isolated on an isosmotic gradient. The second population of granules is labeled much later. Stimulation of hormone release from isolated labeled neural lobes and subsequent isolation of neurosecretory granules at different times after the injection of labeled cysteine shows that the radioactivity decreases in only one population of granules. One of the fractions of the gradient represents the granules found near the release site; the second population is probably located deeper in the nerve endings or in the nerve swellings. Whereas neurophysins are found in both populations, smaller proteins can only be detected in one. Thus it appears that neurosecretory granules undergo an aging process and that isosmotic gradients can separate the aged granules from those newly formed."

https://openalex.org/W1573192566,"Manganese (Mn2+) does not significantly increase gluconeogenesis from lactate (10 mM) plus pyruvate (1 mM) in hepatocytes from fasted rats. In hepatocytes not treated with Mn2+, glucagon (1 microM) and epinephrine (10 microM) at these optimal concentrations both stimulate gluconeogenesis from lactate/pyruvate (10:1), but the hormonal effects are not additive. In the presence of Mn2+ the hormonal effects are slightly larger, and the effects of glucagon (1 microM) and epinephrine (10 microM) become nearly completely additive. Mn2+ increases the specific activity of glucose formed from lactate plus NaH14CO3 by nearly 20%. The increase may be attributed to an increased exchange reaction of either pyruvate carboxylase or phosphoenolypyruvate carboxykinase, suggesting that one of these may be markedly stimulated by Mn2+, the increased exchange reaction possibly signifying an approach toward near equilibrium status."

https://openalex.org/W2091845301,"The detection of objects by the electrosensory system of weakly electric fish is subject to electrical interference such as that produced by the electric organ discharges emitted by neighboring electric fish. Most electric fish species have a behavioral reflex, the jamming avoidance response, which protects their electrolocation system against jamming. Sternopygus is unique in that it has no jamming avoidance response, yet can electrolocate even in the presence of jamming. It appears that Sternopygus protects electrolocation not by a behavioral strategy but by first-order central processing mechanisms that can distinguish between localized changes in the amplitudes of electric organ discharges caused by objects and large-field amplitude modulations caused by jamming. This mechanism acts as a local contrast detector and is functionally similar to the one used by retinal cells to respond to local contrast in light but not to overall changes in illumination."
https://openalex.org/W1600211517,"Abstract The COOH-terminal, anionic residues of the membrane binding segment of cytochrome b5 were examined to determine their possible significance in stabilizing the tight binding of the cytochrome to phospholipid vesicles. The removal of the 6 COOH-terminal residues, which include the carboxyl groups of Glu 132 and Asn 133, by carboxypeptidase digestion resulted in the loss of the characteristic tight binding to either synthetic phospholipid vesicles or isolated microsomes. Chemical modification of the four carboxyl groups of the nonpolar peptide of cytochrome b5 with carbodiimide and methylamine to produce a derivative with no anionic charged residues also resulted in a loss of this type of stable membrane interaction. These results suggest that the short polar COOH-terminal segment, containing two of the four carboxyl groups of the membrane binding domain of cytochrome b5, plays a crucial role in lipid-protein interactions that lead to the normal tight binding both in situ and in reconstituted phospholipid bilayer systems."
https://openalex.org/W1538584303,"The hypothesis was tested that chain elongation/translocation during protein synthesis forces the growing polypeptide chain through the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum into its luminal compartment for secretion. Estrogen-induced chick liver cells which synthesize and secrete the 350,000-dalton apoprotein B of very low density lipoprotein were employed to address this issue. Treatment of [3H]leucine pulse-labeled cells with cycloheximide arrested apoprotein B nascent chains on membrane-bound polysomes without affecting the secretion of completed chains. Puromycin added immediately following the washout of cycloheximide discharged these nascent chains which were subsequently translocated through the membrane and quantitatively secreted into the medium. The size distribution of the secreted apoprotein B nascent chains approximated that of the polysome-bound apoprotein B nascent chains prior to discharge with puromycin. These findings indicate that the translocation of polysome-associated nascent chains through the membrane into the luminal space of the endoplasmic reticulum requires neither protein synthesis nor the attachment of the polypeptide to the ribosome. Since puromycin-discharged nascent chains are readily secreted by these cells, this approach may be used to study the structural requirements for the co- and post-translational events of apoprotein B processing, e.g. glycosylation and assembly of the lipid components of very low density lipoprotein."

https://openalex.org/W1511844878,"Kinetic investigation of the activation of alpha- and beta-trypsins by tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester, in the presence of benzamidine at concentrations higher than 1 mM, indicates that each could exist as a two-state hybrid allosteric system, based on at least two enzyme forms, E and E* (or E and F). Form E* shows much higher affinity for ligands, thus giving rise to ternary complexes of the types SE*S, ME*S, ME*M, SE*M, where the right position identifies binding at the active site, whereas the left position represents binding to the allosteric site. Using a large number of experimental points, measured at different combinations of substrate and modifier concentrations, it was possible to evaluate quantitatively the parameters needed for the description of the model with considerable precision. At high concentrations, benzamidine competes with tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester for an allosteric site, blocking substrate activation of beta-trypsin, but allowing activation of alpha-trypsin. These results imply the participation of an induced fit step during ternary complex formation that gives rise to complexes of the form E*S2 or E*SI, where E* stands for the conformationally changed E* in the complex. The overall picture is that of a two-state model combined with induced-fit. Negative cooperativity (nH = 0.80) was found for the binding of benzamidine (over 1 mM) to trypsin in the presence of substrate. The proposed model is allowing the design of experiments that should lead to an understanding of the mechanism of trypsin activation by modifiers."
https://openalex.org/W1666989999,"The equilibria and kinetics of the reaction of heme-hemopexin with CO were studied. A stoichiometry of one CO/heme was determined, and the affinity of heme-hemopexin for CO was found to be pH-dependent. At pH 8.0, the affinity constant was 4.5 X 10(5) M-1 compared with 4 X 10(6) M-1 at pH 6.1. The kinetics of CO binding were also pH-dependent. A biphasic reaction at neutral pH could be resolved into a faster phase (kon = 2.2 X 10(3) M-1 s-1) solely found at pH 6.0, and a slower phase (kon = 2.0 X 10(2) M-1 s-1) solely found at pH 8.0. The dissociation reaction on the other hand was found to be independent of pH in the range examined (koff = 5 X 10(-4) s-1)."
https://openalex.org/W1530167438,"Application of conventional methods not previously used for preparing lamprey fibrinogen has yielded preparations of very high purity and stability. These preparations made possible a detailed evaluation of molecular weights in normal and chaotropic buffers. The native molecule repeatedly gave a molecular weight of 352,000 to 358,000 via sedimentation equilibrium in citrate buffer; a molecular weight of 354,500 was obtained in guanidine buffer. An anomalous increase of the value of the measured apparent partial specific volume was observed in guanidine buffer. Molecular weight data of the reduced and alkylated subunits of lamprey fibrinogen, obtained by four different methods, have led us to assign molecular weights of 110,000 for (A)alpha, 72,000 for (B) beta, and 50,000 for gamma. Based upon these molecular weights obtained for the subunits, as well as that of the native fibrinogen molecule, the subunit composition can best be fitted to the formulation [(A)n alpha, (B) beta 2, gamma 2] rather than the conventional[(A) alpha 2, (B) beta 2, gamma 2] which would yield a molecular weight of 464,000. Analysis of a stabilized clot induced by Ca2+ showed only gamma dimers; alpha subunit polymerization was undetectable. Cross-linking of lamprey fibrin in the presence of dansylcadaverine and Ca2+ results in fluorescent labeling of the gamma chains and to a lesser extent the gamma dimer. Differing from other reported vertebrate cross-linking systems, the lamprey fibrin alpha subunit appears essentially unreactive in both polymer formation and dansylcadaverine incorporation. These distinct molecular properties may be reasonably attributed to the existence of the single (A)n alpha subunit in the molecular structure of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1511102928,"Abstract The in vivo incorporation of deuterated amino acids into egg white proteins of Japanese quail is described. Using a synthetic diet, the level of incorporation of selectively deuterated tyrosine, tryptophan, histidine, and phenylalanine into lysozyme was greater than 80% as demonstrated by proton NMR. Load and load-chase experiments using [3H]phenylalanine or [3H]leucine monitored the fast uptake time (t 1/2 = 2 days) and confirmed the high levels of incorporation. The potential of this system for preparation of other proteins for NMR spectroscopy is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1605295350,"N-(3-Pyrene)maleimide is known to form fluorescent adducts when reacted with sulfhydryl groups of proteins. Fluorescence properties of the probe, free or conjugated with N-acetylcysteine, were investigated. When conjugated with bovine serum albumin, pyrenemaleimide displayed several lifetime values and heterogeneous quenching effects. This appears to be due to the fact that it can be either covalently attached to -SH groups or adsorbed on hydrophobic areas of proteins. The product (bovine serum albumin labeled with N-(3-pyrene)maleimide) exhibited time-dependent spectral changes related to hydrolysis of the probe; this reaction occurred mainly with adsorbed probe. These results show that several spectroscopically different products, namely, covalently bound probe, adsorbed probe (2 to 8 mol/mol of protein), and hydrolyzed probe contribute collectively to the emission of the labeled protein. It is concluded that the lack of specificity limits the use of pyrenemaleimide as a fluorescent probe of proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1533059109,"Malate thiokinase catalyzes the reversible formation of malyl-CoA or succinyl-CoA from ATP, CoA, and malate or succinate, respectively. Incubation of the enzyme with succinyl-CoA results in the formation of a tight complex in which 4 succinyl-CoA molecules are bound/alpha 4 beta 4 tetramer. Denaturation of the enzyme with urea or sodium dodecyl sulfate releases succinyl-CoA from the enzyme. Enzyme-bound succinyl-CoA is also released by reaction with ADP + Pi (reverse reaction) or by reaction with arsenate (arsenolysis reaction). Addition of ATP to enzyme containing 4 mol of bound succinyl-CoA/mol of enzyme leads to the loss of 2 of the molecules of bound succinyl-CoA with the concomitant incorporation of 2 molecules of phosphate into the enzyme. In a single turnover experiment in which enzyme containing 2 mol of bound succinyl-CoA and 2 mol of phosphate/mol of alpha 4 beta 4 tetramer was incubated with succinate plus CoA, only phosphate was released from the enzyme. Isolation of the enzyme from a reaction mixture undergoing catalysis showed 2 mol of succinyl-CoA bound/enzyme tetramer. These results suggest that, during steady state catalysis, approximately 2 molecules of succinyl-CoA are bound/tetramer, and that malate thiokinase exhibits half-of-the-sites reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W2152279097,"Decreasing the length of grant awards for biomedical research has been suggested as a means of ensuring greater accountability. An analysis of grant programs of the National Institutes of Health and, in particular, at the National Cancer Institute, revealed that the length recommended for grants is closely related to their perceived scientific merit. A principal conclusion is that selectively increasing the length of grants for only the most outstanding applications competing for renewal might improve research productivity while reducing research costs and easing the growing burden on the peer review process."
