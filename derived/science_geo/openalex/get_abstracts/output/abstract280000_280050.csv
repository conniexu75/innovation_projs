https://openalex.org/W2005421356,Plants were regenerated from cultured leaf explants of an inbred variety of Lycopersicon esculentum. Seeds were collected from the regenerated plants and sown in the greenhouse. The resultant plants were then evaluated in the field. Several monogenic mutations segregated in the progeny of regenerated plants. The recovery of single gene mutations is evidence that plant tissue culture can be mutagenic. Complementation tests revealed that one mutation was located on the long arm of chromosome 10.

The sodium ion conductor beta""- alumina is used to form a high-temperature regenerative concentration cell for elemental sodium. An AMTEC of mature design should have an efficiency of 20 to 40 percent, a power density of 0.5 kilowatt per kilogram or more, no moving parts, low maintenance requirements, high durability, and efficiency independent of size. It should be usable with high-temperature combustion, nuclear, or solar heat sources. Experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of the AMTEC and confirmed the theoretical analysis of the device. A wide range of applications from aerospace power to utility power plants appears possible."

https://openalex.org/W2004340152,"Three diagnostic analyses are described which strongly suggest the importance of local net surface heating in the life history of the large-scale, air-sea phenomenon centered in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, commonly called El Ni単o. These analyses rely upon monthly marine weather summaries for the period 1957 to 1976. In the first, correlations and coherence spectra were calculated which show a strong link between the net surface heat flux and sea-surface temperature variations over the eastern equatorial Pacific. The second analysis, also based upon the use of coherence spectra, indicates a sea temperature precursor in the eastern ocean near 25 degrees S which precedes sea temperature changes near the El Ni単o focus near 5 degrees S. Since the link between the two regions would require ocean advective velocities that appear to be unreasonably large, this analysis also suggests the importance of atmospheric forcing through the surface heat flux. In the third analysis a proxy variable is described that seems to be a reasonable indicator of the overall effect of ocean dynamics on the temperature of the El Ni単o core region. A composite analysis of the four El Ni単o events of 1957, 1965, 1972, and 1976 suggests that local surface heating is important during the early part of an event, whereas dynamical factors dominate later."

(12 August, p. 656), the last sentence of the abstract should read: ""Since the H. volcanii sequence is closer to both the eubacterial and eukaryotic sequences than these two are to one another, it follows that the archaebacterial sequence is more like the common ancestral sequence than at least one of the other two versions."" Also, the sentence beginning on line 6, column 3, page 658, should read: ""Although the root of this tree cannot be determined, the data demand that the archaebacterial version be closer to the ancestral version common to all than are one or both of the other two versions."""
