https://openalex.org/W2101889783,"The pervasive influence of secreted Wnt signaling proteins in tissue homeostasis and tumorigenesis has galvanized efforts to identify small molecules that target Wnt-mediated cellular responses. By screening a diverse synthetic chemical library, we have discovered two new classes of small molecules that disrupt Wnt pathway responses; whereas one class inhibits the activity of Porcupine, a membrane-bound acyltransferase that is essential to the production of Wnt proteins, the other abrogates destruction of Axin proteins, which are suppressors of Wnt/β-catenin pathway activity. With these small molecules, we establish a chemical genetic approach for studying Wnt pathway responses and stem cell function in adult tissue. We achieve transient, reversible suppression of Wnt/β-catenin pathway response in vivo, and we establish a mechanism-based approach to target cancerous cell growth. The signal transduction mechanisms shown here to be chemically tractable additionally contribute to Wnt-independent signal transduction pathways and thus could be broadly exploited for chemical genetics and therapeutic goals."

Using two deeply sequenced data sets for human RNA polymerase II and STAT1, each with matching input-DNA controls, we describe a general scoring approach to address unique challenges in ChIP-seq data analysis. Our approach is based on the observation that sites of potential binding are strongly correlated with signal peaks in the control, likely revealing features of open chromatin. We develop a two-pass strategy called PeakSeq to compensate for this. A two-pass strategy compensates for signal caused by open chromatin, as revealed by inclusion of the controls. The first pass identifies putative binding sites and compensates for genomic variation in the 'mappability' of sequences. The second pass filters out sites not significantly enriched compared to the normalized control, computing precise enrichments and significances. Our scoring procedure enables us to optimize experimental design by estimating the depth of sequencing required for a desired level of coverage and demonstrating that more than two replicates provides only a marginal gain in information."

Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon that presents as diarrhea and gastrointestinal bleeding. We performed a genome-wide association study using DNA samples from 1,052 individuals with ulcerative colitis and preexisting data from 2,571 controls, all of European ancestry. In an analysis that controlled for gender and population structure, ulcerative colitis loci attaining genome-wide significance and subsequent replication in two independent populations were identified on chromosomes 1p36 (rs6426833, combined P = 5.1 × 10−13, combined odds ratio OR = 0.73) and 12q15 (rs1558744, combined P = 2.5 × 10−12, combined OR = 1.35). In addition, combined genome-wide significant evidence for association was found in a region spanning BTNL2 to HLA-DQB1 on chromosome 6p21 (rs2395185, combined P = 1.0 × 10−16, combined OR = 0.66) and at the IL23R locus on chromosome 1p31 (rs11209026, combined P = 1.3 × 10−8, combined OR = 0.56; rs10889677, combined P = 1.3 × 10−8, combined OR = 1.29)."

https://openalex.org/W2037044453,"There is a need for mouse tumor models that more closely recapitulate the pathophysiology of human cancers. Here, a mouse model of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is generated with Cre-loxP controlled, lentiviral-mediated delivery of the oncogenes H-Ras and AKT. Transduction of the oncogenes in a small number of cells in adult immunocompetent mice led to the formation of GBM-like tumors, particularly when combined with loss of p53. We report the development of a new method to induce glioblastoma multiforme in adult immunocompetent mice by injecting Cre-loxP–controlled lentiviral vectors expressing oncogenes. Cell type- or region-specific expression of activated forms of the oncoproteins Harvey-Ras and AKT in fewer than 60 glial fibrillary acidic protein–positive cells in the hippocampus, subventricular zone or cortex of mice heterozygous for the gene encoding the tumor suppressor Tp53 were tested. Mice developed glioblastoma multiforme when transduced either in the subventricular zone or the hippocampus. However, tumors were rarely detected when the mice were transduced in the cortex. Transplantation of brain tumor cells into naive recipient mouse brain resulted in the formation of glioblastoma multiforme–like tumors, which contained CD133+ cells, formed tumorspheres and could differentiate into neurons and astrocytes. We suggest that the use of Cre-loxP–controlled lentiviral vectors is a novel way to generate a mouse glioblastoma multiforme model in a region- and cell type-specific manner in adult mice."

https://openalex.org/W2063089997,"The formation of cysteine-sulfinic acid has recently become appreciated as a modification that links protein function to cellular oxidative status. Human DJ-1, a protein associated with inherited parkinsonism, readily forms cysteine-sulfinic acid at a conserved cysteine residue (Cys106 in human DJ-1). Mutation of Cys106 causes the protein to lose its normal protective function in cell culture and model organisms. However, it is unknown whether the loss of DJ-1 protective function in these mutants is due to the absence of Cys106 oxidation or the absence of the cysteine residue itself. To address this question, we designed a series of substitutions at a proximal glutamic acid residue (Glu18) in human DJ-1 that alter the oxidative propensity of Cys106 through changes in hydrogen bonding. We show that two mutations, E18N and E18Q, allow Cys106 to be oxidized to Cys106-sulfinic acid under mild conditions. In contrast, the E18D mutation stabilizes a cysteine-sulfenic acid that is readily reduced to the thiol in solution and in vivo. We show that E18N and E18Q can both partially substitute for wild-type DJ-1 using mitochondrial fission and cell viability assays. In contrast, the oxidatively impaired E18D mutant behaves as an inactive C106A mutant and fails to protect cells. We therefore conclude that formation of Cys106-sulfinic acid is a key modification that regulates the protective function of DJ-1.

Reactive cysteine residues are susceptible to a variety of covalent modifications that are increasingly recognized as a major means of regulating the activities of many proteins (1Reddie K.G. Carroll K.S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2008; 12: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Cysteine forms three different species by the direct addition of oxygen; cysteine-sulfenic (-SOH), -sulfinic (-SO2H), and -sulfonic (-SO3H) acid. Because cysteine can be oxidized to three distinct species, each with different structural and chemical properties, cysteine oxidation is a versatile way for reactive oxygen species (ROS) 4The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; ANOVA, analysis of variance; DTT, dithiothreitol; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; VDAC1, voltage-dependent anion channel 1; WT, wild type. to alter the activity of a protein. Of the three oxidation products of cysteine, only cysteine-sulfenic acid is readily reduced to the thiol under physiological conditions. However, enzymes that catalyze the ATP-dependent reduction of overoxidized peroxiredoxins containing cysteine-sulfinic acid to cysteine have been discovered and characterized (2Biteau B. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 3Jonsson T.J. Murray M.S. Johnson L.C. Poole L.B. Lowther W.T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8634-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). With reversibility comes the potential for cysteine-sulfinic acid modifications to modulate the function of various target proteins in a redox-dependent manner. Therefore, at least in some proteins, cysteine-sulfinic acid should be regarded as a post-translational modification rather than simply a type of protein damage.As expected, many of the proteins that are modified by cysteine oxidation are involved in the oxidative stress response or in the maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis. Of these proteins, DJ-1 has special importance in understanding the role of regulatory cysteine oxidation in neuronal survival. Loss of function mutations in DJ-1 are a rare cause of early onset recessive parkinsonism (4Annesi G. Savettieri G. Pugliese P. D’Amelio M. Tarantino P. Ragonese P. La Bella V. Piccoli T.

DJ-1 is modified under oxidative stress both in vitro and in vivo by oxidation of a very highly conserved cysteine residue (Cys106 in human DJ-1) to form a cysteine-sulfinic acid (Cys106-SO2-) (15Canet-Avilés R.M. Wilson M.A. Miller D.W. Ahmad R. McLendon C. Bandyopadhyay S. Baptista M.J. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Cookson M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9103-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that of the three cysteine residues in human DJ-1, Cys106 is the most prone to oxidative modification (8Andres-Mateos E. Perier C. Zhang L. Blanchard-Fillion B. Greco T.M. Thomas B. Ko H.S. Sasaki M. Ischiropoulos H. Przedborski S. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 14807-14812Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 16Ito G.

Commun. 2004; 317: 722-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In addition, Cys106 has a low pKa value of 5.4 and therefore exists almost exclusively as the highly reactive cysteine thiolate anion at physiological pH (18Witt A.C. Lakshminarasimhan M. Remington B.C. Hasim S. Pozharski E. Wilson M.A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7430-7440Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Replacement of Cys106 with other amino acids in DJ-1 results in a loss of protective activity against oxidative stressors in a number of systems (15Canet-Avilés R.M. Wilson M.A. Miller D.W. Ahmad R. McLendon C. Bandyopadhyay S. Baptista M.J. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Cookson M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9103-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 19Aleyasin H.

Biol. 2005; 15: 1572-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar).We have therefore previously suggested that formation of cysteine-sulfinic acid is required for DJ-1 to exert its protective effects (15Canet-Avilés R.M. Wilson M.A. Miller D.W. Ahmad R. McLendon C. Bandyopadhyay S. Baptista M.J. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Cookson M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9103-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). However, the substitution of the equivalent cysteine residue in Drosophila melanogaster DJ-1 with aspartic acid (C104D in Drosophila) inactivates DJ-1, suggesting that the simple addition of a negatively charged residue at this position is insufficient to support DJ-1 function (21Meulener M.C. Xu K. Thomson L. Thompson L. Ischiropoulos H. Bonini N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 12517-12522Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). As a consequence of the need for direct mutation of Cys106 in these studies, it is unclear whether the cysteine residue itself or its oxidation to a sulfinic acid is critical for the protective activity of DJ-1.We have previously shown using x-ray crystallography that Cys106-SO2- interacts with nearby residues, most notably the highly conserved Glu18 residue (15Canet-Avilés R.M. Wilson M.A. Miller D.W. Ahmad R. McLendon C. Bandyopadhyay S. Baptista M.J. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Cookson M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9103-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). In reduced DJ-1, the carboxylic acid side chain of Glu18 is protonated and donates a hydrogen bond to Cys106, which depresses the thiol pKa value (18Witt A.C. Lakshminarasimhan M. Remington B.C. Hasim S. Pozharski E. Wilson M.A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7430-7440Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized that modifying the environment around the side chain of Cys106 could decouple the oxidation propensity and pKa of Cys106 without changing the cysteine residue itself. In the present study, we have tested this approach by characterizing the effect of Glu18 mutations on the oxidative propensity and cytoprotective activity of Cys106. Our results show that the formation of Cys106-SO2- is critical for DJ-1 to protect cells against mitochondrial damage. In addition, this targeted mutagenesis strategy could be used to manipulate the oxidation state of other cysteine redox-regulated proteins of known structure.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification-Wild-type and mutant DJ-1 variants were cloned between the NdeI and XhoI sites of the bacterial expression vector pET21a and expressed in BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli (Novagen). All proteins were expressed with a noncleavable C-terminal His6 tag (vector-derived sequence LEHHHHHH) for purification by metal affinity Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography. Bacteria were grown in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C with shaking. Once the A600 of the culture reached 0.5-0.7, it was equilibrated at 20 °C for 3 h prior to induction of protein expression by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. The induced culture was incubated at 20 °C with shaking overnight and harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were stored at -80 °C until needed.Recombinant His6-tagged proteins were purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid His-Select resin (Sigma). Eluted DJ-1 protein was dialyzed against storage buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)), loaded onto an equilibrated High Q anion exchange column, and collected in the flow-through, since contaminants bind to the anion exchange resin under these conditions. Purified DJ-1 was concentrated to 1 mm (∈280 = 4000 m-1 cm-1) and ran as a single band on overloaded Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE. The purified protein was supplemented with 2 mm DTT, snap-frozen on liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C.Hydrogen Peroxide Titration of DJ-1-The in vitro oxidative susceptibility of Cys106 in DJ-1 was assayed by titration with several molar ratios of H2O2 to protein monomer. Thawed DJ-1 was rapidly exchanged into extensively degassed nanopure water using a centrifugal spin column containing P6-DG desalting resin (Bio-Rad). Control experiments using degassed buffered solutions (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4) instead of water showed similar oxidative behavior of DJ-1 but gave noisier mass spectrometry data due to the presence of buffer salts. Freshly diluted H2O2 was added to DJ-1 in molar ratios of 0:1, 0.5:1, 1:1, 2.5:1, 5:1, 7.5:1, and 10:1 H2O2/protein monomer and incubated on ice for 30 min. Excess H2O2 was removed using a P6-DG centrifugal desalting column, and the protein samples were immediately supplemented with 5 mm DTT, frozen on liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. DTT, which cannot reduce cysteine-sulfinic acid, was added to ensure that the sample did not further oxidize during sample handling for mass spectrometric analysis. Previous results have indicated that only Cys106 is oxidized by these conditions in vitro (10Zhou W. Zhu M. Wilson M.A. Petsko G.A. Fink A.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 356: 1036-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar).Mass Spectrometry of Oxidized DJ-1-Intact DJ-1 protein was analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with a 4000 Q-trap mass spectrometer (ABS) using a turbo ion spray source probe at the University of Nebraska Redox Biology Center Mass Spectrometry Core Facility. Protein samples (20 μl) were loaded onto a C18 reverse phase column using a PE 200 Autosampler. A SCL-10A high performance liquid chromatography system (Shimadzu) was used for room temperature gradient elution at a flow rate of 100 ml/min in 5 min by using a linear gradient from 0.3% formic acid in water (Solvent A) to 0.3% formic acid in acetonitrile (Solvent B). The elution time for DJ-1 was about 4 min. Data were acquired and processed using Analyst 1.4.1 software in Q1 (quadrupole one)-positive ion mode, and the m/z range of 880-1120 atomic mass units was scanned in 4 s. The total run time for each sample was 10 min. The molecular mass of protein was generated from several multiply charged peaks using the Bayesian Protein Reconstruct option in BioAnalyst 1.4 software. For all experiments, only two species were observed: the reduced protein and an adduct at +32 atomic mass units, corresponding to the Cys106-SO2- form of DJ-1.Crystallization, Data Collection, and Processing-For all crystallization experiments, DJ-1 at 1 mm (20 mg/ml) in storage buffer was crystallized using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method with drops containing 2 μl of protein and 2 μl of reservoir solution. Crystals of E18Q DJ-1 in space group P3121 were grown in 2-5 days at room temperature using a reservoir solution of 30% polyethylene glycol 400, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 125 mm sodium citrate. Crystals of E18D DJ-1 in space group P3121 were grown from 1.3-1.5 m sodium citrate, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. For crystals of E18Q DJ-1, the 30% polyethylene glycol 400 in the mother liquor was sufficient for cryoprotection. E18D DJ-1 crystals were cryoprotected in 2.4 m sodium malonate, pH 7.0 (22Holyoak T.

All crystals were transferred to nylon loops and cryocooled by direct immersion into liquid nitrogen.Diffraction data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source, BioCARS beamline 14BM-C using 13.776 keV (0.9 Å) incident x-rays and an ADSC Q315 detector. Single crystals maintained at 100 K were used for the collection of each data set, and both data sets were collected in separate high and a low resolution passes with differing exposure times, oscillation ranges, and detector distances to record the full dynamic range of the diffraction data. To avoid radiation-induced damage to Cys106, the x-ray beam was attenuated, and the crystal was exposed to x-rays for 5 s or less per 1° oscillation. Diffraction data were integrated and scaled using HKL2000 (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Manual adjustments to the model were made by inspection of 2mFo - DFc and mFo - DFc electron density maps using the program COOT (27Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Additional cycles of conjugate gradient refinement were performed after inclusion of all data to the full resolution limit of each data set. In the later stages of refinement, anisotropic atomic displacement parameters were introduced, resulting in a 3-5% decrease in both R and Rfree. The final cycles of refinement were performed with riding hydrogen atoms (excluding the hydrogen atoms on Oγ of serine, O of tyrosine, Oγ1 of threonine, and Nδ1 of histidine), followed by inclusion of the test set data into the refinement.

Additional mutations (E18N/Q/D and post-V5 stop codon) were generated using QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene). Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).Immunocytochemistry and Western Blotting-Mitochondrial fractions were prepared using a commercially available mitochondrial isolation kit (Pierce) as directed. Mitochondrial fractions were then stripped of all loosely associated proteins using 20 μm sodium carbonate in HEPES buffer for 30 min on ice, followed by ultracentrifugation at 60,000 × g for 30 min. Subcellular fractions were Western blotted and probed with a V5-specific antibody (Invitrogen) to visualize transfected DJ-1. Enrichment of mitochondria was confirmed by simultaneously reprobing the same blots with monoclonal antibodies to the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC1; Calbiochem clone 31HL, 1:4000) and to cytosolic β-actin (clone AC-15, 1:5000; Sigma). Immunostaining for tagged DJ-1 was performed as described (30Blackinton J. Ahmad R. Miller D.W. van der Brug M.P. Canet-Avilés R.M. Hague S.M. Kaleem M. Cookson M.R. Brain Res. Mol.

Paraquat and rotenone were purchased from Sigma.Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis-Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed as previously described (15Canet-Avilés R.M.

For all DJ-1 constructs, stop codons introduced immediately following the V5 tag were used to avoid changes in pI due to the His6 tag. Immobiline DryStrips (11 cm) with linear separation in the pH range 4-7 (GE Healthcare) were used for isoelectric focusing.Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP) Measurement of Mitochondrial Fragmentation-FRAP was performed as previously described (31Karbowski M.

Rizzuto R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1763: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Cells were transiently transfected with 0.5 mg of mitochondrial matrix-localized yellow fluorescent protein using Fugene and seeded into Lab-Tek borosilicate chambers in phenol red-free Opti-MEM. Circular 25-pixel diameter regions of mitochondria were imaged using an LSM 510 confocal microscope with a Plan-Apochromat ×100/1.4 objective (Zeiss) before and after photobleaching at 100% power with 488- and 514-nm wavelength lasers. Scans were taken in 300-ms intervals, for a total of 40 images over 12 s, and the fluorescence intensity was observed over time. Fluorescence recovery was represented as a fraction of initial fluorescence after normalization to both nonspecific photobleaching and background. Each FRAP curve represented the average of ≥60 measurements over at least two independent experiments. Mobile fractions were calculated as ((FRAPt - background)/FRAPt) × ((NSPBi - background)/NSPBt), where NSPB is the nonspecific photobleaching, the subscript t refers to the signal at time = t and the subscript i refers to the initial signal before photobleaching.Cell Viability-M17 cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and transiently transfected with V5-tagged DJ-1 variants using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 48 h and then either left untreated or exposed to rotenone (200 nm) for 24 h. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained using monoclonal antibody to V5 (1:500; Invitrogen), followed by anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa-Fluor488 (Molecular Probes). Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Roche Applied Science), and coverslips were mounted using ProLong gold (Molecular Probes). For each experiment, three randomly selected microscope fields (between 26 and 75 cells/field) were counted by an observer blind to the DJ-1 transfection status of the cells. Each experiment was then repeated three times, and statistical analysis was performed on the combined results. Cell viability was expressed as the percentage of transfected (V5-positive) cells that had intact nuclei compared with all transfected cells. For base line viability in the same cultures, we counted three fields of untransfected cells in the same way, where viability was expressed as percentage of visible nuclei per field.RESULTSSubstitutions at Residue 18 Alter the Oxidation Propensity of Cys106-Three substitutions were made at residue 18 in human DJ-1 for this study; E18Q, E18D, and E18N. The 1.15 Å resolution crystal structure of oxidized E18Q DJ-1 superimposes nearly perfectly (Cα root mean square deviation = 0.08 Å) with wild-type DJ-1 (Protein Data Bank code 1SOA). In addition, like the wild-type protein (15Canet-Avilés R.M. Wilson M.A. Miller D.W. Ahmad R. McLendon C. Bandyopadhyay S. Baptista M.J. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Cookson M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9103-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar), E18Q DJ-1 oxidizes during crystal growth to form Cys106-SO2- (Fig. 1B). There are a few small structural differences between E18Q and wild-type DJ-1 near the site of mutation, the most notable being the lengthening of the hydrogen bond between residue 18 and Cys106-SO2- to 2.71 Å (Fig. 1C). In wild-type DJ-1, the 2.47-Å hydrogen bond between the protonated Glu18 carboxylic acid side chain and Cys106-SO2- is an unusually short and presumably a very strong interaction (15Canet-Avilés R.M. Wilson M.A. Miller D.W. Ahmad R. McLendon C. Bandyopadhyay S. Baptista M.J. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Cookson M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9103-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). The 0.24-Å increase in hydrogen bond length in E18Q Cys106-SO2- DJ-1 is accommodated by the correlated displacements of Cys106-SO2- and Gln18 away from each other (Fig. 1C). Because the E18Q substitution is very structurally conservative, altered oxidation for Cys106 in E18Q (see below) can be attributed solely to the changes in the hydrogen bond between residue 18 and Cys106.The crystal structure of oxidized E18N was determined in a previous study and showed that Cys106 is robustly oxidized to"

https://openalex.org/W2158416613,"Excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) after cerebral ischemia and reperfusion is implicated in brain damage through different cellular and molecular mechanisms, and it is further aggravated by impaired cellular antioxidant defense systems under ischemic conditions. Therapeutic strategies based on exogenous delivery of the native form of superoxide dismutase (SOD), a free radical scavenger, are limited because of its short half-life (approximately 6 min) in vivo and poor permeability across the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). We encapsulated SOD in biodegradable poly(D,L-lactide co-glycolide) nanoparticles (SOD-NPs) and tested their efficacy in a rat focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury model. We hypothesized that localized brain delivery of SOD-NPs would sustain the protective effect of SOD by neutralizing the deleterious effects of ROS formed following ischemia-reperfusion. SOD-NPs were administered at the time of reperfusion via the intracarotid route to maximize their localization in the brain. Animals receiving SOD-NPs (10,000 U of SOD/kg) demonstrated a 65% reduction in infarct volume, whereas an equivalent dose of SOD in solution (SOD-Sol) increased it by 25% over saline control (P<0.001; data at 6 h following reperfusion). Control NPs alone or mixed with SOD-Sol were ineffective in reducing infract volume, with results similar to saline control, indicating the protective effect of the encapsulated enzyme. SOD-NPs maintained BBB integrity, thereby preventing edema, reduced the level of ROS formed following reperfusion, and protected neurons from undergoing apoptosis. Animals treated with SOD-NPs demonstrated greater survival than those with saline control (75% vs. 0% at 28 days) and later regained most vital neurological functions. SOD-NPs may be an effective treatment option in conjunction with a thrombolytic agent for stroke patients."
https://openalex.org/W2002671660,"Autophagy is a regulated process of intracellular catabolism required for normal cellular maintenance, as well as serving as an adaptive response under various stress conditions, including starvation. The molecular regulation of autophagy in mammalian cells remains incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate a role for protein acetylation in the execution and regulation of autophagy. In particular, we demonstrate that the p300 acetyltransferase can regulate the acetylation of various known components of the autophagy machinery. Knockdown of p300 reduces acetylation of Atg5, Atg7, Atg8, and Atg12, although overexpressed p300 increases the acetylation of these same proteins. Furthermore, p300 and Atg7 colocalize within cells, and the two proteins physically interact. The interaction between p300 and Atg7 is dependent on nutrient availability. Finally, we demonstrate that knockdown of p300 can stimulate autophagy, whereas overexpression of p300 inhibits starvation-induced autophagy. These results demonstrate a role for protein acetylation and particularly p300 in the regulation of autophagy under conditions of limited nutrient availability."

https://openalex.org/W2144952712,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) is an important target in anticancer therapy. Here we report how a novel EGF-R peptide ligand (D4: Leu-Ala-Arg-Leu-Leu-Thr) is identified using a computer-aided design approach from a virtual peptide library of putative EGF-R binding peptides by screening against the EGF-R X-ray crystal structure in silico and in vitro. The selected peptide is conjugated with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipid, and the lipid moiety of the peptide-PEG-lipid conjugate is inserted into liposome membranes by a postmodification process. D4 peptide-conjugated liposomes are found to bind to and enter cells by endocytosis specifically and efficiently in vitro in a process apparently mediated by EGF-R high-expressing cancer cells (H1299). In vivo, the D4 peptide-conjugated liposomes are found to accumulate in EGF-R-expressing xenograft tumor tissues up to 80 h after intravenous delivery, in marked contrast to controls. These results demonstrate how structure-based peptide design can be an efficient approach to identify highly novel binding ligands against important receptors. These data could have important consequences for the development of peptide-directed drug delivery systems with engineered specificities and prolonged times of action."
https://openalex.org/W1981498390,"Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) has been proposed to play a central role in the early recognition of viruses by sensing double stranded RNA, a common intermediate of viral replication. However, several reports have demonstrated that TLR3 signaling is either dispensable or even harmful following infection with certain viruses. Here, we asked whether TLR3 plays a role in the response to coxsackievirus B4 (CB4), a prevalent human pathogen that has been associated with pancreatitis, myocarditis and diabetes. We demonstrate that TLR3 signaling on macrophages is critical to establish protective immunity to CB4. TLR3 deficient mice produced reduced pro-inflammatory mediators and are unable to control viral replication at the early stages of infection resulting in severe cardiac damage. Intriguingly, the absence of TLR3 did not affect the activation of several key innate and adaptive cellular effectors. This suggests that in the absence of TLR3 signaling on macrophages, viral replication outpaces the developing adaptive immune response. We further demonstrate that the MyD88-dependent signaling pathways are not only unable to compensate for the loss of TLR3, they are also dispensable in the response to this RNA virus. Our results demonstrate that TLR3 is not simply part of a redundant system of viral recognition, but rather TLR3 plays an essential role in recognizing the molecular signatures associated with specific viruses including CB4."

They show that Aβ1–42 induces expression of collagen VI and that collagen VI protects against Aβ toxicity in cultured neurons. Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, widely presumed to cause Alzheimer's disease, increased mouse neuronal expression of collagen VI through a mechanism involving transforming growth factor signaling. Reduction of collagen VI augmented Aβ neurotoxicity, whereas treatment of neurons with soluble collagen VI blocked the association of Aβ oligomers with neurons, enhanced Aβ aggregation and prevented neurotoxicity. These results identify collagen VI as an important component of the neuronal injury response and demonstrate its neuroprotective potential."
https://openalex.org/W1983979356,"Senescence of endothelial cells increases with systemic aging and is thought to contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. Cell therapy with highly proliferative endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) is an emerging therapeutic option to promote endothelial regeneration, but little is known about their senescence and their vulnerability to inflammatory stressors. We therefore studied the senescence of proliferative human EPCs and investigated the effects of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on their senescence. Human EPCs had a significantly lower rate of senescence at baseline, compared with that of mature endothelial cells. However, EPCs up-regulated the expression of the senescence-associated cell cycle arrest protein p16(INK4a) and markedly increased measured senescence levels when exposed to chronic TNF-alpha treatment. Analysis of telomere length showed that the increases in senescence were not related to changes in telomere length. Inhibition of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway blocked the induction of p16(INK4a) and cellular senescence. In conclusion, highly proliferative EPCs have a low rate of intrinsic senescence but are vulnerable to premature senescence induction by chronic proinflammatory stimulation. These findings will lead to a better understanding of physiological endothelial regeneration as well as to targeted therapies with the aim of promoting endothelial regeneration through endothelial progenitor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1998469703,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), an N-glycosylated transmembrane protein with an intracellular kinase domain, undergoes dimerization by ligand binding resulting in activation of the kinase domain and phosphorylation. Ganglioside GM3 containing sialyllactose inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR through carbohydrate to carbohydrate interactions (CCI) between N-glycans with GlcNAc termini on EGFR and oligosaccharides on GM3. In this study, we provide further evidence for CCI between EGFR and GM3. (i) In vitro and in situ, the inhibitory effect of GM3 on EGFR tyrosine kinase was much higher in A431 cells upon exposure of the GlcNAc termini of the N-glycans to glycosidase treatment (neuraminidase and beta-galactosidase) than in untreated A431 cells. Furthermore, the GM3-mediated inhibition was abrogated by co-incubation with N-glycan containing terminal GlcNAc. (ii) In situ, inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation by GM3 was not observed in alpha-mannosidase IB (ManIB)-knocked down A431 cells that accumulate high mannose-type N-glycans. (iii) EGFR binding to GM3 was enhanced in glycosidase-treated cells that accumulated GlcNAc termini, whereas GM3 did not bind to EGFR from ManIB-knocked down cells that accumulated high mannose-type N-glycans. These results indicate that GM3-mediated inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation is caused by interaction of GM3 with GlcNAc-terminated N-glycan on EGFR."
https://openalex.org/W2095014009,"YoeB is a toxin encoded by the yefM-yoeB antitoxin-toxin operon in the Escherichia coli genome. Here we show that YoeB, a highly potent protein synthesis inhibitor, specifically blocks translation initiation. In in vivo primer extension experiments using two different mRNAs, a major band was detected after YoeB induction at three bases downstream of the initiation codon at 2.5 min. An identical band was also detected in in vitro toeprinting experiments after the addition of YoeB to the reaction mixtures containing 70 S ribosomes and the same mRNAs, even in the absence of tRNA(f)(Met). Notably, this band was not detected in the presence of YoeB alone, indicating that YoeB by itself does not have endoribonuclease activity under the conditions used. The 70 S ribosomes increased upon YoeB induction, and YoeB was found to be specifically associated with 50 S subunits. Using tetracycline and hygromycin B, we demonstrated that YoeB binds to the 50 S ribosomal subunit in 70 S ribosomes and interacts with the A site leading to mRNA cleavage at this site. As a result, the 3'-end portion of the mRNA was released from ribosomes, and translation initiation was effectively inhibited. These results demonstrate that YoeB primarily inhibits translation initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1972505318,"In Escherichia coli the chaperonins GroEL and GroES form a double-ring complex that binds and folds nascent or unfolded proteins. The T4 bacteriophage has its own version of GroES, gp31, that forms a taller folding chamber to fold the major virus capsid protein, gp23. Clare et al. present the structure of gp23–chaperonin complexes showing gp23 encapsulated in the folding chamber. The folding chamber is distorted in order to enclose a large substrate. This is the first study to present an image of a newly folded protein just before its release from the GroEL folding chamber. This study presents the structure of gp23-chaperonin complexes showing gp23 encapsulated in the folding chamber. The folding chamber is distorted to enclose a large substrate, and this is the first study that visualizes of a newly folded physiological substrate trapped inside the folding chamber of GroEL. A subset of essential cellular proteins requires the assistance of chaperonins (in Escherichia coli, GroEL and GroES), double-ring complexes in which the two rings act alternately to bind, encapsulate and fold a wide range of nascent or stress-denatured proteins1,2,3,4,5. This process starts by the trapping of a substrate protein on hydrophobic surfaces in the central cavity of a GroEL ring6,7,8,9,10. Then, binding of ATP and co-chaperonin GroES to that ring ejects the non-native protein from its binding sites, through forced unfolding or other major conformational changes, and encloses it in a hydrophilic chamber for folding11,12,13,14,15. ATP hydrolysis and subsequent ATP binding to the opposite ring trigger dissociation of the chamber and release of the substrate protein3. The bacteriophage T4 requires its own version of GroES, gp31, which forms a taller folding chamber, to fold the major viral capsid protein gp23 (refs 16–20). Polypeptides are known to fold inside the chaperonin complex, but the conformation of an encapsulated protein has not previously been visualized. Here we present structures of gp23–chaperonin complexes, showing both the initial captured state and the final, close-to-native state with gp23 encapsulated in the folding chamber. Although the chamber is expanded, it is still barely large enough to contain the elongated gp23 monomer, explaining why the GroEL–GroES complex is not able to fold gp23 and showing how the chaperonin structure distorts to enclose a large, physiological substrate protein."
https://openalex.org/W2155814762,"Glucocorticoid (GC) immunosuppression and anti-inflammatory action involve the regulation of several transcription factors (TFs). GCs inhibit the acute production of T-helper (Th) 1 and Th2 cytokines but ultimately favor a shift toward Th2 phenotype. GCs inhibit the transcriptional activity of T-bet Th1 TF by a transrepression mechanism. Here we analyze GC regulation of GATA-3, the master driver of Th2 differentiation. We found that GCs inhibit GATA-3 transcriptional activity. We demonstrate that this mechanism does not involve physical interaction between the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and GATA-3 or reduction of GATA-3 binding to DNA, as described previously for T-bet. Instead, GCs inhibit GATA-3 activity by inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase induced GATA-3 phosphorylation. GCs also inhibit GATA-3 mRNA and protein expression. Finally, GATA-3 inhibition affects the interleukin-5 gene, a central Th2 cytokine. The IC(50) of dexamethasone is 10 nM with a maximum effect at 100 nM. All inhibitory actions were blocked by the GR antagonist RU38486 (1 uM), proving the specificity of GR action. In view of the crucial role of GATA-3 in T-cell differentiation and inflammation, we propose that the mechanism of GATA-3 inhibition compared with that in T-bet may have relevant implications in understanding and modulating the anti-inflammatory and Th-regulatory properties of GCs."
https://openalex.org/W2095001078,"Genomic stability in eukaryotic cells is maintained by the coordination of multiple cellular events including cell cycle checkpoint, DNA repair, transcription, and apoptosis after DNA damage. Pax2 transactivation domain interaction protein (PTIP), a protein that contains six BRCT domains, has been implicated in DNA damage response. In this study we showed that recruitment of PTIP to damaged chromatin depends on DNA damage signaling proteins gammaH2AX.MDC1.RNF8, which in turn facilitates sustained localization of PA1 (PTIP-associated protein 1) to sites of DNA break. Similar to PTIP, depletion of PA1 increases cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the N-terminal PA1 binding domain and the C-terminal focus-localization domain of PTIP are critical for PTIP function in DNA damage repair. Interestingly, although PTIP and PA1 associate with MLL (mixed lineage leukemia) complexes and participate in transcriptional regulation, this function of PTIP.PA1 in DNA damage response is likely to be independent of the MLL complexes. Taken together, we propose that a subset of PTIP.PA1 complex is recruited to DNA damage sites via the RNF8-dependent pathway and is required for cell survival in response to DNA damage."

Physiol. 2008; 586: 2961-2973Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Because the NO-dependent IKs activation was inhibited by an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase, 1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazolo(4,3-a)quinoxlin-1-1 (ODQ), with only a limited magnitude but was robustly inhibited by a thiol-alkylating reagent, N-ethylmaleimide, and reversed by a reducing reagent, dithiothreitol, soluble guanylate cyclase-independent, the protein S-nitrosylation mechanism is posited to be mainly involved (14Bai C.-X. Takahashi K. Masumiya H. Sawanobori T. Furukawa T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 142: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, the following issues remain to be addressed: (i) Is the IKs channel S-nitrosylated? (ii) If so, then what is the target of S-nitrosylation between the α-subunit KCNQ1 and the β-subunit KCNE1? (iii) Among multiple Cys residues, which Cys is a target of S-nitrosylation? and (iv) How does NO specifically recognize the target Cys? In the present study, we used the biotin-switch assay and functional patch clamp experiment to answer these questions. Our data show that KCNQ1 is a target of S-nitrosylation, and the presence of a redox motif contributes to making the Cys at 445 in the C terminus of KCNQ1 a preferential target of S-nitrosylation. Plasmid Construction—To create GST fusion protein containing Cys34 and Cys122, Cys180, Cys381, and Cys445, or Cys642 of human KCNQ1, the partial cDNA fragments containing Cys34 and Cys122 (Met1-Tyr125), Cys180 (Thr167-Pro197), Cys381 and Cys445 (Val355-Leu619), or Cys642 (His620-Ser676) were amplified by PCR using the full-length human KCNQ1 as a template and were subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). BamHI-EcoRI-digested fragments were then subcloned into BamHI-EcoRI site of pGEX4T1 (Amersham Biosciences). The pairs of primers used were as follows: Met1-Tyr125 of KCNQ1: a sense strand, 5′-ggatccCCGCCCAGGGCCGAG; an antisense strand, 5′-tcaGTGGTAAACGAAGCATTT; Thr167-Pro197 of KCNQ1: a sense strand, 5′-ggatccACGGAGTACGTGGTCCGC; an antisense strand, 5′-tcaGGGCTTCCGGGCAAAGCG; Val355-Leu619 of KCNQ1: a sense strand, 5′-ggatccGCGGCAGCCTCACTC; an antisense strand, 5′-tcaAATGGTGGCCCGATGGTGTTC; and His620-Ser676 of KCNQ1: a sense strand, 5′-ggatccCACGGTGGCAGCACCCCC; an antisense strand, 5′-tcaGGACCCCTCATCGGG. Lowercase characters in the sense primers indicate the BamHI recognition site, and those in the antisense primers indicate the stop codon. Replacements of His442 with Ala (H442A), Cys445 with Ala (C445A), Asp446 with Asn (D446N), and Asp446 with Glu (D446E) were made by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To introduce a V5 epitope (-GLPIPNPLLGLDST-), the C-terminal KCNQ1 fragment with V5-epitope tag sequence was made by PCR using a full-length human KCNQ1 as a template, digested with MroI and BamHI, and subcloned into MroI-BamHI-digested KCNQ1/pcDNA3.1(-) (KCNQ1-V5). The pair of primers used was as follows: a sense strand, 5′-CATCGCCTCCTGCTTCTC; and an antisense strand, 5′-ggattctcaCGTAGAATCGAGACCGAGGAGAGGGTTAGGGATAGGCTTACCGGACCCCTCATCGGGGCCCCT. Lowercase characters in the antisense primer indicate the BamHI recognition site, and those in italics indicate the stop codon. Underlined uppercase characters indicate the sequence encoding the V5 epitope. To facilitate identification of cells in which CaM had been transfected in patch clamp experiments, we subcloned either CaM or CaM1234 with EGFP in the pIRES vector (Clontech) (EGFP-CaM/pIRES, EGFP-CaM1234/pIRES). Preparation of GST Fusion Protein and Biotin-Switch Assay—GST fusion proteins were purified as described previously (15Dilly K.W. Kurokawa J. Terrenoire C. Reiken S. Lederer W.J. Marks A.R. Kass R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, expression of GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Takara) was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight at 18-20 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and were re-suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA). Cell lysis was achieved by treating the cells with lysozyme (1 mg/ml) for 1 h on ice, sonicating them with 1.5% Sarkosyl, and them subjecting them to a freeze-thaw cycle. Soluble fractions from a 10-min centrifugation at 24,000 × g (4 °C) were rotated for 1 h in the presence of GST-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. Beads containing bound fusion proteins in HEN buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 400 μm EDTA, 40 μm neocuproine) were incubated with 1 mm S-nitroso-N-acetyl penicillamine (SNAP, DOJINDO) for 1 h at a room temperature, and SNAP was removed by washing with HEN buffer five times. The biotin-switch assay was performed as described previously by Jaffrey et al. (16Jaffrey S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Briefly, after GST fusion proteins immobilized to GST-Sepharose beads were washed with HEN buffer containing 0.05% Triton X-100, and free thiol (R-SH) residues were blocked (R-S-S-CH3) with 20 mm methylmethanethiol sulfonate (MMTS, Sigma-Aldrich) in HEN buffer containing 2.5% SDS for 30 min at 53 °C. After a 1-min centrifugation at 2500 rpm (at room temperature), the supernatant was incubated for 30 min at -20 °C with two volumes of pre-chilled acetone to remove MMTS. Only S-nitrosylated thiol (R-S-NO) residues were then reduced to free thiol (R-SH) with 1 mm sodium ascorbate in HEN buffer and were biotinylated (R-S-S-biotin) with 4 mm biotin-HPDP (Pierce). Biotinylated samples were electrophoresed in SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and immunoblotted with a 1:4000-diluted monoclonal anti-biotin antibody (BN-34, Sigma-Aldrich). The proteins were detected with an advanced enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) using a lumino-image analyzer, LAS-3000 mini (Fujifilm). Densitometric analysis was performed with a software MultiGauge (Ver3.0, Fujifilm). Biotin-Switch Assay for Culture Cell Lysates and Cardiomyocyte Homogenates—For the S-nitrosylation assay in living cells, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (ATCC) were transfected with one of KCNQ1WT/pcDNA3.1, KCNEQ1(C445A)/pcDNA3.1, KCNQ1(D446N)/pcDNA3.1, or KCNE1/pcDNA3.1 alone or with either of CaM/pcDNA3.1 or CaM1234/pcDNA3.1 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. After 24-36 h post transfection, cells were collected and lysed in HEN buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Cells were treated with 0.5 mm SNAP for 15 min, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, collected, and lysed in HEK 293 cells with 0.5% Triton X-100. For S-nitrosylation assay in cardiac myocytes, guinea pig left ventricle was washed with HEN buffer, minced, and homogenized in HEN buffer. After cell debris was removed by centrifugation, cell lysates were treated with 0.5 mm SNAP, 3-(2-hydroxy-1-methyl-2-nitrosohydrazino)-N-methyl-1-propanamide, or S-nitrosoglutathine for 30 min at room temperature, and NO donors were removed using a microcon YM column (Millipore Corp.). After treatment with each NO donor, lysates from culture cells and from guinea pig ventricles were incubated with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and either polyclonal anti-KCNQ1 (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-KCNE1 (N-16, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody overnight at 4 °C. The biotin-switch assay for immune complexes was performed as described above for GST fusion proteins with minor modifications. Samples were blocked with 20 mm MMTS and biotinylated with 1 mm sodium ascorbate and 4 mm biotin-HPDP. After precipitation with pre-chilled acetone, streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) were added, and samples were incubated for 1 h at a room temperature. The beads were washed with HEN buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and proteins were eluted by incubation with HEN buffer containing 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C for 20 min. Eluted samples were electrophoresed in SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunoblotted with a 1:4000-diluted polyclonal anti-KCNQ1 antibody (C-20) or a 1:2000-diluted polyclonal anti-KCNE1 antibody (N-16). Patch Clamp Experiments—HEK 293 cells were transfected with one of EGFP/pIRES, EGFP-CaM/pIRES, or EGFP-CaM1234/pIRES, either of KCNQ1WT/pcDNA3.1 or KCNQ1 (C445)/pcDNA3.1, and KCNE1/pcDNA3.1 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Expressed KCNQ1/KCNE1 currents were recorded with a whole cell patch clamp technique using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments) as described previously (10Bai C.-X. Namekata I. Kurokawa J. Tanaka H. Shigenobu K. Furukawa T. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The pCLAMP software (version 8.0, Axon) was used to generate voltage-pulse protocols and to acquire and analyze data. KCNQ1/KCNE1 currents were elicited by 2-s test pulses (Vt) to +60 mV followed by 2-s repolarization pulses to -40 mV from a holding potential (Vh) of -65 mV at 0.1 Hz. Peaks of tail current amplitude was measured during the repolarization pulse. All experiments were performed at a room temperature of 22 ± 2 °C. Pipette solution contained (in mm); 110 aspartic acid, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 ATP potassium salt, 10 HEPES, 11 EGTA (pH 7.3 adjusted with KOH): in some experiments, 11 mm EGTA was replaced with equimolar BAPTA to maintain intracellular Ca2+ at low concentrations. External (bath) solution was the Tyrode's solution containing (in mm); 135 NaCl, 4.8 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 5 glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH). Statistics—All numerical values are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was evaluated by an analysis of variance followed by a Bonferroni multiple comparison test. p < 0.05 was taken as the significance level. S-Nitrosylation of KCNQ1 but Not KCNE1—We first examined if either or both of KCNQ1 or/and KCNE1 is S-nitrosylated in culture cells. Human V5-tagged KCNQ1 or KCNE1 was expressed in HEK293 cells, immunoprecipitated with an anti-V5 antibody or an anti-KCNE1 antibody, and treated with an NO donor SNAP at a concentration of 0.5 mm. In the pilot experiments, we confirmed that transfection of HEK293 cells with V5-tagged KCNQ1 and KCNE1 yielded similar currents to those obtained by transfection with KCNQ1 and KCNE1. An immunopositive band was detected after avidin purification for KCNQ1 (lane 3, Fig. 2A). For KCNE1, although an immunopositive band was detected without application of a thiol-reacting reagent MMTS to block free thiol (R-SH) (lane 1, Fig. 2B), no such band was detected after blocking free thiol with MMTS (lane 2, Fig. 2B). We also found that exogenously applied SNAP induced S-nitrosylation of KCNQ1 of guinea pig ventricular myocytes (supplemental Fig. S1), which indicates that KCNQ1 is the target of S-nitrosylation also under a physiological condition. Specific S-Nitrosylation of Cys445 of KCNQ1—We next attempted to pinpoint the target Cys residue for S-nitrosylation among nine Cys residues present in KCNQ1. Because Cys residues that are subject to S-nitrosylation have been shown in a number of studies to reside in a juxtamembrane zone (6Choi Y.B. Tenneti L. Le D.A. Ortiz J. Bai G. Chen H.S. Lipton S.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 17Broillet M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15135-15141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we focused on six such Cys residues (Cys34, Cys122, Cys180, Cys381, Cys445, and Cys642) (closed circles in Fig. 3A). We attempted to create GST fusion proteins containing each Cys residue. In E. coli, although the GST fusion protein containing Cys180 (Thr167-Pro197) or Cys642 (His620-Ser670) became soluble, the GST fusion protein containing Cys34, Cys122, Cys381,orCys445 alone was hardly soluble. Alternatively, we created and examined the GST fusion protein with Cys34 and Cys122 (Met1-Tyr125 of KCNQ1), and that with Cys381 and Cys445 (Val355-Leu619 of KCNQ1). Each of four GST fusion proteins was purified from E. coli, incubated with an NO donor, and subjected to the biotin-switch assay. S-Nitrosylation was detected only in the GST fusion protein with Cys381 and Cys445 (Val355-Leu619 of KCNQ1) (lane 3, Fig. 3B). To examine if Cys381 or/and Cys445 were S-nitrosylated by an NO donor, we replaced Cys381 with Ala (C381A) or Cys445 with Ala (C445A) and carried out the biotin-switch assay. S-Nitrosylation remained detected for C381A mutant, but was completely eliminated for the C445A mutant (Fig. 3C). To further corroborate that Cys445 is the main target of S-nitrosylation, we expressed V5-tagged full-length KCNQ1 in which Cys445 had been replaced with Ala leaving remaining eight cysteines intact (KCNQ1(C445A)) in HEK293 cells. Cell lysates were treated with 0.5 mm SNAP and subjected to the biotin-switch assay. Application of an NO donor barely induced S-nitrosylation of KCNQ1(C445A) (lane 3, Fig. 3D), which verifies that Cys445 is the main target of S-nitrosylation. Role of Redox Motif for Specific Cys445 S-Nitrosylation—Several mechanisms have previously been implicated for the site-specific S-nitrosylation in several proteins, which include the presence of Cys residue in the hydrophobic milieu (18Nedospasov A.

A. 2000; 97: 13543-13548Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), flanking of the Cys residue by a redox (acid-base) motif (19Stamler J.S. Toone E.J. Lipton S.A. Suchler N.J.

Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar). The Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy profiling indicates that Cys445 does not reside in the hydrophobic milieu. Cys445, but none of the other eight cysteines in KCNQ1, is immediately followed by an acidic amino acid. Such a sequence is partially matched to the proposed consensus sequence for S-nitrosylation, (Lys/Arg/His)-Cys-(Asp/Glu), in which the presence of an acidic amino acid immediately after Cys is proposed to be especially critical (19Stamler J.S. Toone E.J. Lipton S.A. Suchler N.J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 691-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). To explore if an acidic amino acid, Asp446, has some integral roles for S-nitrosylation of Cys445, we made a mutant GST fusion protein of the KCNQ1 C terminus (Val355-Leu619) with replacement of Asp446 with Asn (D446N) leaving Cys445 intact, and performed in vitro biotin-switch assay. An S-nitrosylated band was not detected (lane 3 in Fig. 4, A and B). When Asp446 was replaced with another acidic amino acid Glu (D446E), S-nitrosylation was clearly detected (lane 5 in Fig. 4A and column 2 in Fig. 4B), suggesting that S-nitrosylation of Cys445 requires a negative charge at KCNQ1 residue 446. Because the basic amino acid closest to Cys445 is His442, we replaced His442 with Ala (H442A). We could still observe S-nitrosylation in the H442A mutant (lane 2 in Fig. 4A and column 4 in Fig. 4B). Collectively, the acidic amino acid Asp446, but not the basic amino acid His442, appears to be required for site-specific S-nitrosylation of Cys445. CaM Is Required for S-Nitrosylation in Living Cells—To assess whether Cys445 also is the S-nitrosylation target and whether redox-motif is critical for S-nitrosylation of Cys445 also in living cells, biotin-switch assays were performed in lysates obtained after application of an NO donor to HEK293 cells expressing full-length KCNQ1WT, KCNQ1(C445A), or KCNQ1(D446N) (Fig. 5A). To our surprise, not only KCNQ1 mutants but also KCNQ1WT were not S-nitrosylated (lane 2, Fig. 5A), suggesting that an additional factor for S-nitrosylation of the KCNQ1 channel is required in living cells. Skeletal muscle type ryanodine receptor type 1 requires interaction with CaM to be S-nitrosylated (4Eu J.P. Sun J. Xu L. Stamler J.S. Meissneer G. Cell. 2000; 102: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 5Sun J. Xin C. Eu J.P. Stamler J.S. Meissner G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11158-11162Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). KCNQ1 possesses two CaM binding domains in the C terminus (23Yus-Najera E. Santana-Castro I. Villarroel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28545-28553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and its gating kinetics is regulated by CaM binding (24Shamgar L. Ma L. Schmitt N. Haitin Y. Peretz A. Wiener R. Hirsch J. Pongs O. Attali B. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 25Ghosh S. Nunziato A. Pitt G.S. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Cys445, an S-nitrosylation target, locates between these two CaM binding sites (26Gamper N. Li Y. Shapiro M.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3538-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). IKs values are responsive to intracellular Ca2+ (27Tohse N. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: H1200-H1207PubMed Google Scholar), and we have previously demonstrated in separate experiments that IKs regulation by Ca2+ is mediated by NO (10Bai C.-X. Namekata I. Kurokawa J. Tanaka H. Shigenobu K. Furukawa T. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and that the presence of CaM is essential for Ca2+ regulation (28Nitta J. Furukawa T. Marumo F. Sawanobori T. Hiraoka M. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the latter study, we suggest a role of an allosteric effect of CaM, but not activation of CaM-dependent protein kinase in IKs regulation by intracellular Ca2+ (28Nitta J. Furukawa T. Marumo F. Sawanobori T. Hiraoka M. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Taken together, these pre-existing conditions led us to speculate that CaM might be required for S-nitrosylation of KCNQ1 and that the amount of CaM endogenously present in HEK293 cells is not sufficient for KCNQ1 S-nitrosylation. We co-transfected CaM with KCNQ1 into HEK293 cells and performed biotin-switch experiments. Western blot analysis indicates that CaM level is ∼8 times higher in CaM-transfected cells than in CaM non-transfected cells (supplemental Fig. S2). In the presence of CaM, KCNQ1WT was clearly S-nitrosylated (lane 2 in Fig. 5B), whereas KCNQ1(C445A) or KCNQ1(D446N) was not (lanes 3 and 4 in Fig. 5B). When we co-transfected CaM1234 mutant with KCNQ1WT, in which four Ca2+ binding motifs are disrupted (29DeMaria C.D. Soong T.W. Alseikhan B.A. Alvania R.S. Yue D.T. Nature. 2001; 411: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), S-nitrosylation was not observed even in KCNQ1WT (lane 2 in Fig. 5C). Thus, interaction with CaM in the Ca2+-bound form is critical for S-nitrosylation of KCNQ1 in living cells. We found using co-immunoprecipitation experiments that the interaction with CaM was intact for KCNQ1(D446N) (supplemental Fig. S3), indicating that the failure of an NO donor to S-nitrosylate KCNQ1(D446N) is due to the disruption of a redox motif but not to the disturbed interaction with CaM. S-Nitrosylation on KCNQ1 Channel Function—We employed a patch clamp experiment to investigate functional consequences of S-nitrosylation of Cys445 of the KCNQ1 channel. HEK 293 cells expressing KCNQ1 and KCNE1 conduct slowly activating outward currents with very similar kinetics to those of IKs in cardiac myocytes (Fig. 6A). Without co-transfection of CaM, the amplitude of outward currents increased monotonically during the depolarization pulse (upper panel in Fig. 6A), whereas, with co-transfection of CaM, outward currents appeared to saturate at the later phase of the depolarization pulse (lower panel in Fig. 6A), in agreement with the previous reports that CaM induces inactivation of the KCNQ1/KCNE1 current (24Shamgar L. Ma L. Schmitt N. Haitin Y. Peretz A. Wiener R. Hirsch J. Pongs O. Attali B. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 25Ghosh S. Nunziato A. Pitt G.S. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). With co-transfection of CaM, application of SNAP increased KCNQ1/KCNE1 current amplitudes in a dose-dependent manner (red traces in Fig. 6, A and B, second bar in Fig. 6C), whereas SNAP at 100 nm did not significantly enhance KCNQ1(C445A)/KCNE1 currents (third bar in Fig. 6C). S-nitrosoglutathione, a different class of NO donor, also enhanced KCNQ1/KCNE1 currents (data not shown). Even without application of SNAP (0 nm), IK tail amplitude was slightly increased (first bar in Fig. 6B): this slight increase appeared to be due to the nonspecific effect of DMSO used as a vehicle, because in the time control experiment application of DMSO slightly enhanced KCNQ1/KCNE1 currents (data not shown). Without co-transfection of CaM (fourth bar in Fig. 6C) or with co-transfection of CaM1234 mutant (fifth bar in Fig. 6C), SNAP at 100 nm failed to enhance KCNQ1/KCNE1 currents. To examine the effects of intracellular Ca2+, we replaced 11 mm EGTA with equimolar BAPTA. In the presence of BAPTA, IKs amplitude suffered from significant rundown, which agrees with the finding that injection of BAPTA into oocytes (estimated intracellular concentration of 5-10 mm) reduced KCNQ1/KCNE1 currents by >50% (25Ghosh S. Nunziato A. Pitt G.S. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Although the BAPTA-induced rundown made the effects of SNAP difficult to assess, we could at least conclude that SNAP did not enhance IKs tail amplitude in the presence of BAPTA (sixth bar in Fig. 6C). With co-transfection with wild-type CaM, SNAP slightly enhanced KCNQ1(C445A)/KCNE1 currents, although not significantly (third bar in Fig. 6C). We had previously reported that, although NO donor-induced enhancement of IKs was mostly inhibited by an alkylating reagent, N-ethylmaleimide, and reversed by a reducing reagent, dithiothreitol, some fraction was inhibited by an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase, ODQ (14Bai C.-X. Takahashi K. Masumiya H. Sawanobori T. Furukawa T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 142: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We tested the hypothesis if small SNAP-induced enhancement for KCNQ1(C445A)/KCNE1 currents is due to a minor contribution of soluble guanylate cyclase-dependent mechanism. In the presence of ODQ, SNAP failed to enhance KCNQ1(C445A)/KCNE1 currents (seventh bar in Fig. 6C), indicating that the SNAP-induced enhancement of KCNQ1(C445A)/KCNE1 currents is likely due to the cGC-dependent mechanism, but not due to the effects on redox-sensitive Cys other than Cys445. Emerging evidence demonstrates that protein S-nitrosylation is an important NO-mediated regulatory mechanism of various classes of proteins (1Hess D.T. Matsumoto A. Nudelman R. Stamler J.S. Nat.

Furthermore, the mechanism underlying preferential S-nitrosylation of the target Cys is not fully understood. In the present study, we demonstrate that an NO donor induces S-nitrosylation at Cys445 in the C terminus of the pore-forming α-subunit KCNQ1. We provide convincing evidence to show that the redox motif flanking Cys445 is required for the site-specific S-nitrosylation of Cys445. S-Nitrosylation at Cys445 of the KCNQ1 channel functionally regulates the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex channel. Among nine Cys in KCNQ1, only Cys445 is immediately followed by the acidic amino residue, and the in vitro biotin-switch assay indicates that the presence of acidic amino acid at the 446th residue is required for S-nitrosylation of Cys445. His442 is the closest basic amino acid, but the replacement of His442 to a neutral amino acid Ala does not disrupt S-nitrosylation of Cys445. We are not sure if the presence of basic amino acids is not required or if other distal basic amino acids possibly located close to Cys445 in the three-dimensional structure are required. In living cells, an NO donor failed to S-nitrosylate WT KCNQ1 in the absence of CaM, and even in the presence of CaM, an NO donor failed to S-nitrosylate KCNQ1(D446N), implying that both of the redox motif flanking Cys445 and the presence of CaM are required. We have previously demonstrated that endothelial NO synthase and KCNQ1 co-localize in the caveolae fraction of guinea pig hearts (12Nakamura H. Kurokawa J. Bai C.-X. Asada K. Xu J. Oren R.V. Zhu Z.I. Clancy C.E. Isobe M. Furukawa T. Circulation. 2007; 116: 2913-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), indicating the close proximity of the NO donor and the target protein. Thus, multiple factors orchestrate to make Cys445 of KCNQ1 a target of molecule-specific and site-specific S-nitrosylation. The presence of CaM is also a pre-requisite for S-nitrosylation of the skeletal muscle type ryanodine receptor type 1 (4Eu J.P. Sun J. Xu L. Stamler J.S. Meissneer G. Cell. 2000; 102: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 5Sun J. Xin C. Eu J.P. Stamler J.S. Meissner G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11158-11162Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). It is suggested that the binding of Ca2+-bound CaM, but not apo-CaM, unmasks the target Cys residue or provide hydrophobic milieu (4Eu J.P. Sun J. Xu L. Stamler J.S. Meissneer G. Cell. 2000; 102: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 5Sun J. Xin C. Eu J.P. Stamler J.S. Meissner G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11158-11162Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). CaM frequently acts at the level of electron transfer, such as that between the FAD reductase and heme domains to regulate NOS activity (30Li H. Poulos T.L. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 293-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Thus, it might be an alternative possibility that CaM acts as an electron transfer cofactor between an NO donor and Cys445 surrounded by the redox motif. Co-transfection of CaM is required for S-nitrosylation of KCNQ1 in living cells, but not in cell lysates, for which we have currently no clear explanation. It might be a potential explanation that to induce S-nitrosylation in the reducing intracellular milieu, the presence of CaM would be required. However, more work will clearly be needed to clarify the role of CaM for S-nitrosylation of KCNQ1. An exogenously applied NO donor increased the amplitude of KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel currents. An NO donor failed to enhance KCNQ1(C445A)/KCNE1 currents or KCNQ1/KCNE1 currents without co-transfection of CaM or with co-transfection of CaM1234. Because each of the three experimental conditions dislocates S-nitrosylation of the KCNQ1 channel in the biotin-switch assay, these data serve as evidence for the direct link between S-nitrosylation of Cys445 and the activation of the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel. We used a high concentration of SNAP (0.5 mm) to assess S-nitrosylation of KCNQ1, because a similar concentration (1 mm) of SNAP was used in the original biotin-switch assay report (16Jaffrey S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). However, this concentration was much higher than that (1-100 nm) used for patch clamp experiments, which would certainly raise a question on the causative linkage between S-nitrosylation and KCNQ1 current enhancement. We, therefore, examined the concentration dependence for KCNQ1 S-nitrosylation by SNAP: SNAP induced S-nitrosylation of KCNQ1 above 10 nm in a concentration-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. S3), suggesting that S-nitrosylation of the KCNQ1 channel and its activation occur within a similar dosage of SNAP. The underlying mechanism for S-nitrosylation-induced activation of the KCNQ1 channel remains to be addressed. Biochemical, spectroscopic, and crystallographic analyses have recently provided the structure model for the C terminus of KCNQ1, which consists of four α-helices, helices A, B, C, and D, and an unstructured loop between helices A and B (31Wiener R. Haitin Y. Shamger L. Fernández-Alonso M.C. Martos A. Chomsky-Hecht O. Rivas G. Attali B. Hirsch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5815-5830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Helices A and B provide binding sites for CaM, and the Cys445, the target of S-nitrosylation resides in the midst of the unstructured loop between helix A and B. Because CaM constitutively binds to both helix A and helix B (31Wiener R. Haitin Y. Shamger L. Fernández-Alonso M.C. Martos A. Chomsky-Hecht O. Rivas G. Attali B. Hirsch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 5815-5830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), bridging of two helices by CaM might create a milieu for S-nitrosylation of Cys445 in the midst of the loop. Although functional assembly of KCNQ1 channels has been shown to require its interaction with CaM (24Shamgar L. Ma L. Schmitt N. Haitin Y. Peretz A. Wiener R. Hirsch J. Pongs O. Attali B. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 25Ghosh S. Nunziato A. Pitt G.S. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), similar KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel currents were recorded in the absence and presence of CaM co-expression. Endogenous levels of CaM in HEK293 cells was about one-eighth of those in CaM-transfected cells (supplemental Fig. S2), which might be sufficient for functional assembly of KCNQ1 but not for KCNQ1 S-nitrosylation. Certainly, more work will be needed to decipher the role of CaM for S-nitrosylation and the mechanism linking S-nitrosylation of the KCNQ1 channel to its activation. The S-nitrosylation of the KCNQ1 channel is the novel regulatory mechanism of this channel that may have a great impact on physiological regulation of cardiac electrical activity, because the IKs channel composed of KCNQ1 and KCNE1 has a crucial regulatory role in cardiac electrophysiology, including response to autonomic nervous stimulation (32Marx S.O.

Because the majority of GR binding sites (glucocorticoid-responsive elements (GREs)) are distant from promoters, it is likely that interactions at a distance play an important role in GR action. To determine whether long range chromosomal associations play a role in transcription regulation by GR, we utilized a chromosome conformation capture-based technique (associated chromosome trap) to identify unknown, remote sequences that interact with the GR-induced Lipocalin2 (Lcn2) gene. Our screen revealed that the Lcn2 GRE interacts with the Ciz1 gene, nearly 30 kb upstream. Ciz1 was subsequently found to be a novel GR-responsive gene. The GRE proximal to the Lcn2 promoter apparently functions to regulate both the Lcn2 gene and the distal Ciz1 gene. Using quantitative chromosome conformation capture, we find that a loop structure is organized between these two genes. This structure is hormone-independent and present only in cell types where the genes are active. The strong correlation between gene expression and loop structure in different cell lines suggests that high order interactions play a role in determining tissue-specific gene regulation.

Science. 2002; 295: 1306-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (2460) Google Scholar) has been valuable in constructing a picture of the regulatory architecture, stressing the spatial organization of gene enhancer interactions and other interactions.Although 3C has proved to be invaluable in deciphering complex interacting partners located on one chromosome (in cis) or on different chromosomes (in trans) (8Spilianakis C.G. Lalioti M.D. Town T. Lee G.R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2005; 435: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar), this method is limited by the need for prior identification of candidate partners.

Ciz1 was subsequently found to be a GR-regulated gene. To characterize this interaction, we carried out a detailed 3C analysis and found that the loop structure between Lcn2 and Ciz1 is hormone-independent, suggesting that GR binding itself is not the determinative event in formation of the long range interaction. Moreover, loop formation is evident only in cell types where the two loci are active. Our data suggest that active GREs loop to their target sites prior to hormone induction. It is possible that such an organization allows a rapid transcriptional response to hormone stimulation at responsive loci.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture-Mouse mammary epithelial adenocarcinoma cells (3134) (15Walker D.

ACT is a variation of the 3C technique. Unlike the 3C technique, which requires prior identification of both elements of the interacting DNA segments, the ACT assay permits a search for putative interacting DNA elements using a known sequence as bait.Lipocalin2 (Lcn2) was selected to serve as a bait for the ACT screen for several reasons; Lcn2 transcription increases rapidly in response to Dex hormone treatment in mammary cells (3134 cell line), peaks at 2 h after induction, and then plateaus up to 24 h from induction (Fig. 1D). The Lcn2 promoter was carefully characterized and found to harbor a GRE by tiled ChIP-on-chip as well as by conventional ChIP and was found to become hypersensitive to DNase I in response to Dex treatment (14John S. Sabo P.J. Johnson T.A. Sung M.H. Biddie S.C. Lightman S.L. Voss T.C. Davis S.R. Meltzer P.S. Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 611-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Using Lcn2 as bait, we identified several non-continuous, interacting DNA sequences throughout the genome. One of these events represented a putative interaction between the Lcn2 promoter and a region located 300 bp downstream of Ciz1 ATG, which is located 24,881 bp from the Lcn2 bait (Fig. 1, A–C). This interaction was chosen for future characterization.Ciz1 Is a GR-regulated Gene-We asked whether Ciz1, a putative Lcn2-associated partner, is also regulated by hormone (Dex). Analysis of Ciz1 transcription showed that Ciz1 is up-regulated following Dex stimulation. Moreover, the kinetics of Ciz1 induction is similar to that of Lcn2, with a rapid induction followed by persistently elevated transcript production (Fig. 1E). Because there could be local GR-mediated expression of multiple genes in the Lcn2 neighborhood, we asked whether Ptges2 expression, which is proximal to Lcn2 in the opposite direction from Ciz1 (Fig. 1C), is also up-regulated by Dex and found that it is not a glucocorticoid-responsive gene (Fig. 1F). Interestingly, Ciz1 was not previously known to be a hormone-responsive gene and was not identified as such by a screen using genomic tools (14John S. Sabo P.J. Johnson T.A. Sung M.H. Biddie S.C.

Elbi C. Parekh B.S. Hager G.L. John S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 3308-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In summary, we took an unbiased approach to search for loci interacting with Lcn2 and identified Ciz1, which was then observed to be a GR-regulated gene.Lcn2-Ciz1 Interact in Vivo-Loci along a chromatin fiber might be in physical proximity despite the linear distance between them, and they will randomly interact as the result of the intrinsic flexibility of chromatin (7Dekker J. Rippe K. Dekker M. Kleckner N. Science. 2002; 295: 1306-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (2460) Google Scholar). This trait is usually reflected in the 3C assay and in the 3C-based screens (22Simonis M. Klous P. Splinter E. Moshkin Y. Willemsen R. de W.E. van S.B. de L.W. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 1348-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar, 23Wurtele H. Chartrand P.

Tiwari V. Kurukuti S. Ohlsson R. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 1341-1347Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), resulting in amplification of a 3C DNA product, which may not indicate a functional loop between the bait and the nearby sequences. Nevertheless it is essential to test whether there is a loop between Lcn2 and Ciz1 by using quantitative 3C. We applied 3C using one primer proximal to the HindIII restriction site within the Lcn2 promoter together with HindIII sites across the locus, comparing the non-induced and the hormone-induced states. Our 3C results show that there is a decrease followed by elevation in the interaction frequency 30–35 kb from the Lcn2 GRE, indicating that there is a loop between the Lcn2 GRE and the Ciz1 upstream region. In the absence of a loop, the interaction frequency would be expected to stay low after the drop in the interaction frequency at 26 kb from Lcn2 GRE. As all the primer pairs amplify the Bac control template with similar efficiencies, we confirmed the validity of the sharp drop-off and rise in the interaction frequency with alternative primers and found that the pattern remains (supplemental Fig. 1). Interestingly, the interaction frequency between the two loci is not dependent on the presence of hormone (Fig. 2A). The interaction frequency in the Ciz1 direction decreased 26 kb away from Lcn2 GRE, whereas in the Ptges2 direction, it dropped after 19 kb, which may suggest that there is an interaction between the lcn2 GRE and elements within the 26-kb domain.FIGURE 2Long range interactions between Lcn2 GRE and Ciz1. A, 3C analysis shows high interaction frequencies between Lcn2 GRE and Ciz1 upstream region in the presence (diamond points) or absence (square points) of hormone. The Lcn2 GRE primer was used as an anchor and paired with primers across and surrounding the Ciz1 gene. The graph presents relative cross-linking frequency on the vertical axis.

Genet. 2006; 38: 1278-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). In the ChIP loop assay, immunoprecipitation following cross-linking and restriction enzyme processing enriches the sample for fragments bound to a specific protein complex. Following ligation, the chimeric DNA fragments are then subjected to quantitative PCR, determining the interaction frequency. We took advantage of the fact that GR is bound to the promoter region of Lcn2 in the presence of hormone (14John S. Sabo P.J. Johnson T.A. Sung M.H. Biddie S.C. Lightman S.L. Voss T.C. Davis S.R. Meltzer P.S. Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 611-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and carried out a ChIP loop assay with GR antibodies. We found that Lcn2 and Ciz1 form a loop and that GR interacts with the loop (Fig. 2B). The peak of interaction with Lcn2 over the Ciz1 locus is 30 kb apart, in agreement with the 3C results (Fig. 2A). We could not detect interactions between Lcn2 and loci at the Ptges2 locus ∼20 kb from Lcn2 in the opposite direction to Ciz1 and also at regions surrounding the peak (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the interaction detected between Lcn2 and Ciz1 upstream regions represents a loop rather than merely a trait of the chromatin structure, allowing interactions within proximal promoter regions.A time course ChIP analysis shows that equilibrium GR binding at the Lcn2 GRE is unchanged over a 24-h period, as long as Dex is continuously applied to the cells. 3S. John et al., unpublished results. We then determined the frequency of GR binding to the loop using a time course ChIP loop assay. We found that the frequency of GR binding in the loop is stable up to 8 h after induction (Fig. 2C). In contrast to the robust binding of GR at the Lcn2 promoter, ChIP experiments with GR antibodies did not reveal any significant enrichment for GR over a 12-kb region spanning the Ciz1 transcription start site, suggesting that Lcn2 and Ciz1 might both be regulated by a common GR site located proximal to Lcn2 (supplemental Fig. 2).Cell Type-specific Loop Structure Is Associated with Transcription-If the loop structure plays a role in transcription regulation in a tissue-specific manner, we would expect to find a correlation between the two. To explore this possibility, we first characterized the hormone-dependent response of Ciz1 and Lcn2 in different cell lines. We found that both Lcn2 and Ciz1 are induced by Dex in the hepatocyte cell line, Hepa1C1C7 (17Hankinson O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), but not in the AtT20 pituitary cell (16Richardson U.I. Schonbrunn A. Endocrinology. 1981; 108: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, C–F). Furthermore, 3C analysis across the Lcn2-Ciz1 locus with one fixed primer at the Lcn2 GRE together with primers spanning the entire Lcn2-Ciz1 region shows that the loop topology in Hepa1C1C7 cells is similar to 3134 cells (Fig. 3B). However, the loop structure is completely absent in AtT20 cells where Lcn2 and Ciz1 are not expressed (Fig. 3A). The correlation between expression and loop structure in different cell lines suggests that loop formation plays a role in transcriptional regulation of both genes (Fig. 4).FIGURE 3Cell-specific expression of Lcn2 and Ciz1 is correlated with loop formation. A and B, 3C analysis over the Lcn2-Ciz1 locus shows interaction frequencies between the Lcn2 GRE and the Ciz1 upstream region in the presence (diamond) or absence (square) of hormone in AtT20 cells (A) and in Hepa1 cells (B). Controls and symbols are described in the legend for Fig. 2. C–F, mRNA analysis shows that Lcn2 and Ciz1 transcription is strongly up-regulated in response to Dex treatment in Hepa1 liver cells but not in AtT20 pituitary cells. Results shown are the average of three independent experiments.

A long range interaction is detected between the immediate upstream regions of the Lcn2 and Ciz1 promoters, both in the presence and in the absence of hormone (Dex). This interaction is likely to result from dynamic and transient pairing between the regions occurring on a rapid time scale. The glucocorticoid receptor, although not a critical component of the loop interaction, stimulates transcriptional activity of both promoters by mechanisms related to the loop-induced proximity of the promoters. Other long range interactions between the Lcn2 GRE and intermediate regions of the Ciz1 domain are possible (– – –).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe observation that distant regulatory elements can associate with, and activate, core promoter elements has been well established in several genetic systems. In other cases, long range interactions have been associated with transcriptional repression (25Fraser P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2006; 16: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 26Ling J.Q. Hoffman A.R. Pediatr. Res. 2007; 61: 11R-16RCrossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The majority of nuclear receptor binding sites are located distant (greater than 10 kb) from transcription start sites, as exemplified by EREs in human breast cancer (10Carroll J.S. Liu X.S.

Endocrinol. 2007; 22: 10-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and by GREs in human lung cells (2So A.Y. Chaivorapol C. Bolton E.C. Li H. Yamamoto K.R. PLoS. Genet. 2007; 3: e94Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This suggests that GREs and EREs loop to their target genes. In this respect, we wanted to probe the nuclear environment of the GRE of the strongly hormone-induced gene, Lcn2. We took advantage of the newly developed ACT assay (9Ling J.Q. Li T. Hu J.F. Vu T.H. Chen H.L. Qiu X.W. Cherry A.M. Hoffman A.R. Science. 2006; 312: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) and performed an unbiased search for physical association of genome regions with the Lcn2 GRE. Our screen revealed Ciz1 as an associated partner of Lcn2. Quantitative 3C and ChIP loop assays demonstrated an interaction between the Lcn2 GRE and the upstream region of Ciz1, with GR participating in this preformed 30-kb loop after hormone induction. Ciz1 transcription analysis revealed that Ciz1, like Lcn2, is up-regulated by GR; moreover, the two genes share the same time-dependent expression kinetics.The frequency of interaction between the Lcn2 GRE and Ciz1 upstream regions is not affected by hormone or the transcriptional status of the two genes. Our 3C studies extend the understanding of GREs and gene-looping phenomenon in higher eukaryotes and show that two elements can be organized in a higher order structure prior to hormone induction. This preorganized environment may facilitate a rapid transcriptional response to hormone stimulus.Different cell types vary in their response to GR. We hypothesized that if loop structure plays a role in transcription, we would expect a correlation between the two. We observed that Lcn2 and Ciz1 are co-regulated by GR in mammary cell lines and liver cell lines. Furthermore, 3C analysis of the locus showed that the two loci form long range interactions in both cell types. In contrast, in pituitary AtT20 cells, neither of these genes are GR-regulated, and neither are found in the 30-kb loop structure. These findings indicate that specific long range interactions play a role in cell type-specific GR function.The kinetics of GR-stimulated transcriptional output is quite complex, often with alternate activation and repression phases (27John S. Johnson T.A. Sung M.H. Biddie S.C. Trump s. koch-Paiz C.A. Davis S.R. Walker R. Meltzer P.S. Hager G.L. Endocrinology. 2009; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The common transcription profile of Lcn2 and Ciz1 suggests that the two genes are regulated by a common mechanism. It is possible that genes sharing the same kinetic behavior are also co-localized in the nucleus in specialized microenvironments and that these microenvironments contain a set of factors governing a common transcriptional response (22Simonis M.

Cell. 2007; 128: 787-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). An examination of multiple sets of GR-regulated genes will be required to explore the validity of this concept.The molecular basis of looping is not yet clear, although interactions between structural proteins and transcription factors are all candidates (25Fraser P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2006; 16: 490-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 26Ling J.Q. Hoffman A.R. Pediatr. Res. 2007; 61: 11R-16RCrossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 31de L.W.

To understand the role of the GR protein in the loop, we performed a GR ChIP loop assay and found that GR participates in the loop between Lcn2 and Ciz1. The fact that GR participates in the loop may suggest that GR binding sites would be found at the two ends of the loop by ChIP. However, a detailed GR ChIP across a 12-kb region upstream of the Ciz1 gene did not reveal any direct GR binding events. Moreover a high throughput sequencing of GR binding sites (ChIP-seq) shows that the Lcn2 GRE is the only one within 200 kb around the locus,3 suggesting that the Ciz1 response is mediated through the Lcn2 GRE. GR binding to a given GRE has been uniformly associated with chromatin transitions, as reflected by increased hypersensitivity to DNase I (DHS) (14John S. Sabo P.J. Johnson T.A. Sung M.H. Biddie S.C.

In agreement with the ChIP data, the only induced DHS site found in the Lcn2-Ciz1 locus is at the Lcn2 GRE (14John S. Sabo P.J. Johnson T.A. Sung M.H. Biddie S.C. Lightman S.L. Voss T.C. Davis S.R. Meltzer P.S. Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 611-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), further suggesting that the Lcn2 GRE is the only GRE present in this large chromatin domain. These findings support a hypothesis by which a single GRE at the Lcn2 gene regulates the expression of both genes.Given the dynamic nature of transcription factor movement in living cells (33McNally J.G.

Among fusogenic lipids, phosphatidic acid and phosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) have been proposed to act at various steps of neurotransmitter and hormone exocytosis. Using real time FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) measurements, we show here that the GTPase ARF6, potentially involved in the synthesis of these lipids, is activated at the exocytotic sites in PC12 cells stimulated for secretion. Depletion of endogenous ARF6 by siRNA dramatically inhibited secretagogue-evoked exocytosis. ARF6-siRNA greatly reduced secretagogue-evoked phospholipase D (PLD) activation and phosphatidic acid formation at the plasma membrane and moderately reduced constitutive levels of PIP2 present at the plasma membrane in resting cells. Expression of an ARF6 insensitive to short interference RNA (siRNA) fully rescued secretion in ARF6-depleted cells. However, a mutated ARF6 protein specifically impaired in its ability to stimulate PLD had no effect. Finally, we show that the ARF6-siRNA-mediated inhibition of exocytosis could be rescued by an exogenous addition of lysophosphatidylcholine, a lipid that favors negative curvature on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Altogether these data indicate that ARF6 is a critical upstream signaling element in the activation of PLD necessary to produce the fusogenic lipids required for exocytosis.

Release of neurotransmitters and hormones occurs through exocytosis, a highly regulated process that culminates with the fusion of secretory vesicles/granules and the plasma membrane.

The role of lipids is less well understood, but recent findings indicate that the shape of the lipids (determined by the size of their head group) and their charge might also be important for the fusion process. In vitro cone-shaped lipids that spontaneously form negative membrane curvatures favor the formation of hemifusion intermediates and fusion when present in the contacting leaflets of apposed membranes (2Chernomordik L.

Interestingly, recent reconstitution in vitro experiments reveal that PA, located on the acceptor membrane (inner leaflet of the plasma membrane), and PIP2, located on the donor membrane (outer leaflet of the vesicle), increase the fusion rate.

We demonstrate that ARF6 is an essential element of the calcium-regulated exocytotic machinery and show that its prime function is to activate PLD1, thereby providing the exocytotic machinery with the fusogenic PA required for the late fusion reaction.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents, Antibodies, Plasmid, and Short Interference RNA—Palmitoyllysophosphatidylcholine was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL).

Cells were also transfected with a pXS plasmid tagged with HA containing mutated rescue ARF6 constructs resistant to siRNA degradation by the mutagenesis of the codon CTC encoding Leu-118 to TTG. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as described previously (31Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol.

Briefly, PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with glucose (4500 mg/liter) and containing 30 mm NaHCO3, 5% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml kanamycin.For immunofluorescent and FRET experiments, expression vector were introduced into PC12 cells (1 × 105 cells) using GenePorter (Gene Therapy System; 0.5 μg ADN/well) on adherent cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Western blot, pulldown, and PLD assays, 20 μg of each plasmid was electroporated into PC12 cells (107 cell/reaction) at 290 V and 1200 microfarads and plated (12Zeniou-Meyer M. Zabari N.

Under these conditions, the transfection efficiency ranged from 60 to 75%, and the co-transfection rate was greater than 90%.Pulldown Assay for ARF6-GTP—PC12 cells were co-transfected by electroporation (107 cell/reaction) with pXS ARF6-HA in combination with various siRNA vectors. 72 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with Locke's solution (140 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 11 mm glucose, and 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) and then incubated for 5 min in Locke's solution or stimulated with an elevated K+ solution (Locke's solution containing 59 mm KCl and 85 mm NaCl). After stimulation, PC12 cells were immediately lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and mammalian protease inhibitor mixture (1:500 dilution; Sigma). GTP-bound ARF6 was pulled down by incubating lysate containing equal amounts of proteins (500 μg) with the GST-MT2 fusion protein conjugated with glutathione beads for 2 h at 4°C. The precipitate expressing HA-tagged ARF6-GTP was resolved on an SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted with specific antibodies.Growth Hormone Release—PC12 cells (24-well plates, 80% confluent) were transfected with the various constructs (0.5 μg of each plasmid/well) using GenePorter (Gene Therapy Systems). 72 h after transfection, cells were washed four times with Locke's solution and then incubated for 10 min in Locke's solution (basal release) or stimulated for 10 min with a depolarizing concentration of K+. Where indicated, 1 μm lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) was added during the last wash and during the 10-min incubation under resting conditions (Locke's solution) or stimulated conditions (elevated K+ solution). Supernatants were collected, and the cells were harvested by scraping in 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline and broken by three freeze-and-thaw cycles. The amounts of GH secreted into the medium or retained within the cells were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Roche Applied Science). GH secretion was expressed as a percentage of total GH present in the cells before stimulation. We measured secretion from permeabilized cells as described previously (32de Barry J. Janoshazi A.

First cells were washed twice with Locke's solution and twice with Ca2+-free Locke's solution and then permeabilized for 10 min in potassium glutamate buffer containing 10 μm digitonin without (resting) or with 20 μm free calcium (stimulated).Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Measurement—For FRET experiments, we used ARF6 fused at its C-terminal end with ECFP as a donor and the probe for active ARF6, MT2 fused with EYFP, as an acceptor. PC12 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding either ARF6-ECFP or MT2-EYFP or co-transfected with both plasmids. For FRET recording, cells were placed on an inverted fluorescence microscope (Axiovert 35M, Zeiss; dichroic mirror 470 nm), which was connected by optical fibers with the excitation and emission monochromators of an Alphascan PTI spectrofluorometer. The cells were superfused with Locke's solution (1 ml/min) and stimulated by superfusion of elevated K+ solution for the indicated times. The cells were illuminated at 430 nm (excitation wavelength of ECFP), and emission spectra between 480 and 600 nm were recorded at the indicated times. For FRET measurements, the emission spectra were deconvoluted after base-line subtraction to distinguish donor and acceptor fluorescence intensities as described previously (32de Barry J.

Medium was then replaced by 100 μl of ice-cold 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and the cells were broken by three freeze/thaw cycles. Samples were collected and mixed with an equal amount of Amplex Red reaction buffer (Amplex Red phospholipase D assay kit, Molecular Probes), and the PLD activity was estimated after a 1-h incubation at 37 °C with a Mithras fluorometer (Berthold). A standard curve was established with purified PLD from Streptomyces chromofuscus (Sigma).Immunofluorescence, Confocal Microscopy, and Image Analysis—Transfected PC12 were washed four times with Locke's solution and then incubated for 10 min either in Locke's solution (resting conditions) or in Locke's solution containing a depolarizing concentration of potassium (stimulation) before the fixation step and further processed for immunofluorescence as described previously (33Vitale N.

Briefly, for PIP2 staining cells were fixed on ice for 3 h in 4% paraformaldehyde-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2 mm EGTA, washed three times in 50 mm NH4Cl-phosphate-buffered saline, and permeabilized for 4 h at 4°C in permeabilization buffer (1 mm MgCl2, 0.2% saponin, 1% fetal calf serum, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 50 mm glycine, 0.05% NaN3 in phosphate-buffered saline). Incubation with anti-PIP2 antibody (1/50) in permeabilization buffer was performed overnight at 4 °C and then with the secondary antibody for 2 h at 4°C. Stained cells were visualized using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Quantification was performed using Zeiss CLSM instrument software, version 3.2. The percentage of the EGFP-PABD binding probe co-localizing at the plasma membrane with SNAP25 was measured by determining the double-labeled pixels, expressed as average fluorescence intensity, and then converted to a percentage of the total fluorescence obtained from the two labels in each cell.The amount of PIP2 staining was measured and expressed as the average fluorescence intensity (mean pixel intensity multiplied by the pixel number) normalized to the corresponding surface area by dividing by the total plasma membrane surface of each cell. We performed a quantitative cell-to-cell comparison in the same field (fluorescence from nontransfected cells compared with that of transfected cells expressing GFP). The PIP2 level in the nontransfected cells was fixed at 100%. To validate the specificity of the anti-PIP2 antibody and our analysis, we used the recently described drug-inducible type IV 5-phosphatase to reduce PIP2 levels in PC12 cells (35Varnai P. Thyagarajan B. Rohacs T. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Quantification revealed that PIP2 staining was almost completely eliminated (supplemental Fig. 1). On the other hand, overexpression of PIP5K induced an increase in PIP2 staining of up to 6-fold (supplemental Fig. 1). In conclusion, these data confirm that we were able to detect variation in PIP2 staining over a large scale and that the PIP2 antibody used was highly specific.Data Analysis—In all figures, data are given as the mean values ± S.E. obtained from at least three independent experiments performed on different cell cultures, where n represents the number of experiments. Data were analyzed with Minitab® statistical software. Statistical significance was established using Student's test, and data were considered significantly different when the p value was less than 0.05. Gaussian distributions of the data were verified.RESULTSEndogenous ARF6 Is Activated during Calcium-regulated Exocytosis—To visualize the activated form of ARF6 in cells, we adapted a recently described probe shown to interact specifically with GTP-bound ARF6 in vitro and in a yeast two-hybrid assay (36Schweitzer J.K. D'Souza-Schorey C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27210-27216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). MT2 (metallothionein-2), a ubiquitous 6–7-kDa metal-containing protein, was cloned from PC12 cells and expressed as MT2-GFP fusion protein. In resting PC12 cells, this ARF6-GTP sensor accumulated in the nucleus and also moderately in the cytosol (Fig. 1A). Stimulation with a depolarizing concentration of potassium led to a reduction of cytosolic MT2-GFP and a concomitant recruitment of the probe to the cell periphery where it co-localized with the plasma membrane marker SNAP25 (Fig. 1A). Quantification revealed that more than 10 ± 1.2% of the MT2-GFP signal co-localized with SNAP25 in stimulated PC12 cells, compared with less than 1% under resting conditions. Accumulation of the ARF6-GTP sensor at the cell periphery was transient and rapidly became undetectable when the cells were placed in a resting condition (data not shown). Similar observations were made in chromaffin and PC12 cells stimulated with various secretagogues, such as nicotine, ATP, or barium (data not shown). These data suggest that endogenous ARF6 is activated transiently at the plasma membrane in cells stimulated for exocytosis.To assess the dynamics of ARF6 activation in living cells, next we decided to use FRET measurements. For this purpose the fluorophore pair ECFP-EYFP, which has been shown previously in several applications to act as a donor/acceptor pair with a Förster radius of ∼50 Å, was chosen. PC12 cells were cotransfected to express ARF6-ECFP and MT2-EYFP as donor and acceptor fluorophores. In resting cells, excitation at 430 nm (the excitation wavelength of ECFP) induced an emission spectrum displaying two fluorescence intensity peaks at 495 and 525 nm characteristic of ARF6-ECFP and MT2-EYFP, respectively (Fig. 1B). Bleaching of each fluorophore was estimated in monotransfected cells, and these values were used to correct for bleaching in cotransfected cells. Following cell stimulation with high potassium, ARF6-ECFP fluorescence decreased and MT2-EYFP increased concomitantly (Fig. 1B). We quantified this effect after spectral deconvolution in cells stimulated for different periods of time. As illustrated in Fig. 1C, FRET occurred between ARF6-ECFP and MT2-EYFP in stimulated PC12 cells. Accordingly, immunofluorescence images confirmed that ARF6-ECFP and MT2-EYFP co-localized at the cell periphery in stimulated cells (data not shown). An optimal FRET signal was detected between 45 s and 2 min of stimulation, which correlates well with the time course of GH secretion elicited by high potassium stimulation (compare Figs. 1C and 3A). Taken together, these data indicate that MT2 interacts with ARF6 in the cell periphery of secretagogue-stimulated cells and reveal that activation of ARF6 occurs at the plasma membrane prior to exocytosis and hormone secretion.FIGURE 3Knockdown of endogenous ARF6 inhibits exocytosis from PC12 cells. A, PC12 cells were transfected with pGHsuper and either ARF6-siRNA#1 or mutated (Mut) siRNA#1 plasmids for 72 h. Cells were then washed and subsequently incubated with 1 ml of Locke's solution (basal release) or 59 mm K+. 200-μl aliquots were collected at the indicated periods of time. Basal GH release was unchanged and was subtracted from the GH release evoked by 59 mm K+ to obtain the net secretory response. Data are given as the mean values ± S.E. (n = 6). B, PC12 cells were transfected with pGHsuper (Control), a mutated siRNA#1, or one of the pGHsuper-ARF6-siRNA vectors (siRNA#1–3). 72 h after transfection, cells were washed twice in calcium-free Locke's solution and incubated for 10 min in potassium glutamate medium containing 10 μm digitonin and either 0 (resting) or 20 μm free Ca2+ (stimulated). Extracellular fluids were then collected, and the quantity of GH present in solutions and cells was estimated with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. GH release is expressed as the percentage of total GH present in the cells before the 10-min incubation period with digitonin. Data are given as the mean values ± S.E. obtained in three experiments performed on three different cell cultures. *, p ≤ 0.001 (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Characterization of ARF6-siRNA and Effect on Exocytosis in PC12 Cells—To probe the functional importance of ARF6 in regulated exocytosis, we used a siRNA approach to knock down endogenous ARF6 expression in PC12 cells. To accomplish this and simultaneously enable a quantitative assessment of exocytosis, we engineered plasmids that express both full-length human GH and various siRNA targeted against the sequence of ARF6. Because GH is stored in secretory granules and released by exocytosis, they allow a direct measurement of the secretory activity of siRNA-expressing cells (28Meyer M.Z. Deliot N. Chasserot-Golaz S.

https://openalex.org/W1974408803,"Background The objective of this work was to investigate the hypothesis that eukaryotic Internal Ribosome Entry Sites (IRES) lack secondary structure and to examine the generality of the hypothesis. Methodology/Principal Findings IRESs of the yeast and the fruit fly are located in the 5′UTR immediately upstream of the initiation codon. The minimum folding energy (MFE) of 60 nt RNA segments immediately upstream of the initiation codons was calculated as a proxy of secondary structure stability. MFE of the reverse complements of these 60 nt segments was also calculated. The relationship between MFE and empirically determined IRES activity was investigated to test the hypothesis that strong IRES activity is associated with weak secondary structure. We show that IRES activity in the yeast and the fruit fly correlates strongly with the structural stability, with highest IRES activity found in RNA segments that exhibit the weakest secondary structure. Conclusions We found that a subset of eukaryotic IRESs exhibits very low secondary structure in the 5′-UTR sequences immediately upstream of the initiation codon. The consistency in results between the yeast and the fruit fly suggests a possible shared mechanism of cap-independent translation initiation that relies on an unstructured RNA segment."
https://openalex.org/W2075665232,"The unusual adhesion G-protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) contain large extracellular N-terminal domains, which resemble cell-adhesion receptors, and C-terminal heptahelical domains, which may couple to G-proteins. These receptors are cleaved post-translationally between these domains into two fragments (NTF and CTF). Using the aGPCR latrophilin 1, we previously demonstrated that the fragments behave as independent cell-surface proteins. Upon binding the agonist, alpha-latrotoxin (LTX), latrophilin fragments reassemble and induce intracellular signaling. Our observations raised important questions: is the aGPCR signaling mediated by reassembled fragments or by any non-cleaved receptors? Also, can the fragments originating from distinct aGPCRs form hybrid complexes? To answer these questions, we created two types of chimerical constructs. One contained the CTF of latrophilin joined to the NTF of another aGPCR, EMR2; the resulting protein did not bind LTX but, similar to latrophilin, could couple to G-proteins. In another construct, the NTF of latrophilin was fused with the C terminus of neurexin; this chimera bound LTX but could not signal via G-proteins. Both constructs were efficiently cleaved in cells. When the two constructs were co-expressed, their fragments could cross-interact, as shown by immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, LTX(N4C) induced intracellular Ca2+ signaling only in cells expressing both constructs but not each individual construct. Finally, we demonstrated that fragments of unrelated aGPCRs can be cross-immunoprecipitated from live tissues. Thus, (i) aGPCR fragments behave as independent proteins, (ii) the complementary fragments from distinct aGPCRs can cross-interact, and (iii) these cross-complexes are functionally active. This unusual cross-assembly of aGPCR fragments could couple cell-surface interactions to multiple signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2160984730,"Valproate is a standard treatment for bipolar disorder and a first-line mood stabilizer. The molecular mechanisms underlying its actions in bipolar disorder are unclear. It has been suggested that the action of valproate is linked to changes in gene expression and induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-response proteins.Here we show that valproate modulates the ER stress response through the regulation of WFS1, an important component for mitigating ER stress. Therapeutic concentrations of valproate induce expression of WFS1 mRNA and activate the WFS1 promoter. In addition, WFS1 forms a complex with GRP94, an ER stress-response protein, in which valproate dose-dependently enhances its dissociation from GRP94.These results suggest that the therapeutic effects of valproate in bipolar disorder may be mediated by WFS1 expression and its dissociation from GRP94."
https://openalex.org/W2139208917,"We explored the mechanistic involvement of the growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene GADD45a in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and ventilator-induced inflammatory lung injury (VILI). Multiple biochemical and genomic parameters of inflammatory lung injury indicated that GADD45a(-/-) mice are modestly susceptible to intratracheal LPS-induced lung injury and profoundly susceptible to high tidal volume VILI, with increases in microvascular permeability and bronchoalveolar lavage levels of inflammatory cytokines. Expression profiling of lung tissues from VILI-challenged GADD45a(-/-) mice revealed strong dysregulation in the B-cell receptor signaling pathway compared with wild-type mice and suggested the involvement of PI3 kinase/Akt signaling components. Western blot analyses of lung homogenates confirmed approximately 50% reduction in Akt protein levels in GADD45a(-/-) mice accompanied by marked increases in Akt ubiquitination. Electrical resistance measurements across human lung endothelial cell monolayers with either reduced GADD45a or Akt expression (siRNAs) revealed significant potentiation of LPS-induced human lung endothelial barrier dysfunction, which was attenuated by overexpression of a constitutively active Akt1 transgene. These studies validate GADD45a as a novel candidate gene in inflammatory lung injury and a significant participant in vascular barrier regulation via effects on Akt-mediated endothelial signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2066486669,"The thyroid hormone and retinol transporter protein known as transthyretin (TTR) is in the origin of one of the 20 or so known amyloid diseases. TTR self assembles as a homotetramer leaving a central hydrophobic channel with two symmetrical binding sites. The aggregation pathway of TTR into amiloid fibrils is not yet well characterized but in vitro binding of thyroid hormones and other small organic molecules to TTR binding channel results in tetramer stabilization which prevents amyloid formation in an extent which is proportional to the binding constant. Up to now, TTR aggregation inhibitors have been designed looking at various structural features of this binding channel others than its ability to host iodine atoms. In the present work, greatly improved inhibitors have been designed and tested by taking into account that thyroid hormones are unique in human biochemistry owing to the presence of multiple iodine atoms in their molecules which are probed to interact with specific halogen binding domains sitting at the TTR binding channel. The new TTR fibrillogenesis inhibitors are based on the diflunisal core structure because diflunisal is a registered salicylate drug with NSAID activity now undergoing clinical trials for TTR amyloid diseases. Biochemical and biophysical evidence confirms that iodine atoms can be an important design feature in the search for candidate drugs for TTR related amyloidosis."

Of the two GS isoforms found in mammals, the muscle enzyme (muscle glycogen synthase) has received more attention and the relative importance of every known phosphorylation site in the control of its activity and intracellular distribution has been previously addressed. We have analyzed the impact of the dephosphorylation at the homologous sites of the glycogen synthase liver (LGS) isoform. Serine residues at these sites were replaced by non-phosphorylatable alanine residues, singly or in pairs, and the resultant LGS variants were expressed in cultured cells using adenoviral vectors. The sole mutation at site 2 (Ser7) yielded an enzyme that was almost fully active and able to induce glycogen deposition in primary hepatocytes incubated in the absence of glucose and in FTO2B cells, a cell line that does not normally synthesize glycogen. Mutation at site 2 was also sufficient to trigger the aggregation and translocation of LGS from the cytoplasm to the hepatocyte cell cortex in the absence of glucose. However, this redistribution was not observed in hepatocytes incubated without glucose when an additional mutation (E509A), which renders the enzyme inactive, was introduced. This result suggests that LGS translocation is strictly dependent on glycogen synthesis. Eukaryotic glycogen synthase activity is regulated by reversible phosphorylation at multiple sites.

The rate-limiting enzyme for glycogen synthesis is glycogen synthase (GS), 3The abbreviations used are: GS, glycogen synthase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; LGS, liver glycogen synthase; MGS, muscle glycogen synthase; GSK-3, glycogen synthase kinase 3 GSK-3; PTG, protein targeting to glycogen; FBS, fetal bovine serum; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. which catalyzes the addition of α1,4-linked glucose units from UDP-glucose to a growing glycogen chain. The activity of the enzyme is tightly regulated by phosphorylation at multiple sites and by allosteric effectors, such that phosphorylation tends to inactivate the enzyme, but even the most phosphorylated forms become fully active in the presence of glucose-6-P (Glc-6-P). In mammals there are two GS isoforms, liver glycogen synthase (LGS), whose expression is tissue-specific, and muscle glycogen synthase (MGS), which is expressed in almost all tissues (1Roach P.J.

Only one mutant form of LGS, which contains six Ser to Ala substitutions at sites 2, 3a, 3b, 3c, 4, and 5, has been studied. This mutant is constitutively active and causes a large increase in glycogen accumulation when expressed in rat primary hepatocytes (7Kadotani A. Fujimura M. Nakamura T. Ohyama S. Harada N. Maruki H.

J. 1997; 321: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Garcia-Rocha M. Roca A. De La Iglesia N. Baba O. Fernandez-Novell J.M. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Consequently, in hepatocytes, glycogen synthesis is initiated at the periphery and progresses toward the cellular interior (17Fernandez-Novell J.M. Lopez-Iglesias C. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Here we evaluated the relative potency of each of the LGS phosphorylation sites in the regulation of its activity. We also analyzed how the phosphorylation status of these sites affects the intracellular distribution of the liver enzyme. Our results indicate that, in contrast to what occurs with MGS, whose activation requires dephosphorylation of site 2, at the NH2 terminus, and site 3a or 3b, at the COOH terminus (4Skurat A.V. Wang Y. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25534-25542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a single Ser to Ala mutation at site 2 of LGS is sufficient to render an essentially fully active form of the liver enzyme. Construction of Recombinant Adenoviruses-Recombinant adenovirus coding for wild-type liver GS (LGS WT) has been described (18Gomis R.R. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Ser to Ala mutations were introduced into pACCMV-RnLGS plasmid at sites 2, 2a, 3a, 3b, 3c, 4, and 5 by site-directed mutagenesis using the following primers: site 2 forward primer, CTCAGGGGCCGCTCCTTGGCTGTGAC and reverse primer, GTCACAGCCAAGGAGCGGCCCCTGAG; site 2a forward primer, CTGTGACGGCCCTTGGTGGG and reverse primer, CCCACCAAGGGCCGTCACAG; site 3a forward primer, CTTTAAGTATCCCAGGCCCTCCGCAGTACCA and reverse primer, TGGTACTGCGGAGGGCCTGGGATACTTAAAG; site 3b forward primer, 5′-CAGTACCACCTGCCCCATCAGG and reverse primer, 5′-CCTGATGGGGCAGGTGGTACTG; site 3c forward primer, CCCCATCAGGAGCCCAGACTTC and reverse primer, GAAGTCTGGGCTCCTGATGGGG; site 4 forward primer, CCATCAGGATCCCAGACTTCAGCTCCTCAGAGC and reverse primer, GCTCTGAGGAGCTGAAGTCTGGGATCCTGATGG; and site 5 forward primer, CTCAGAGCGCCGATGTGGAAAACGAAG and reverse primer, CTTCGTTTTCCACATCGGCGCTCTGA. The adenoviruses coding for mutated LGS in these sites or in combinations of two were constructed as described (19Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The E509A mutation was introduced into pACCMV-RnLGS and pACCMV-RnLGS 2 + 3b plasmids using the forward primer (ccatcatactatgcgccctggggttacacg) and reverse primer (CGTGTAACCCCAGGGCGCATAGTATGATGG). A virus coding for the bacterial enzyme β-galactosidase, was used as a negative control in the metabolic impact studies. The DNAs encoding the recombinant proteins were sequenced using the ABI-PRISM DNA sequencing kit and an ABI-PRISM 377 automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Hepatocyte Isolation, Culture, and Treatment with Recombinant Adenoviruses-Collagenase perfusion was used to isolate hepatocytes from male Wistar rats (180–225 g) fasted for 24 h, as described previously (20Massague J. Guinovart J.J. FEBS Lett. 1977; 82: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10 mm glucose, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 nm insulin (Sigma), and 100 nm dexamethasone (Sigma), and then seeded onto plastic plates of 60-mm diameter treated with 0.001% (w/v) collagen solution (Sigma) at a final density of 8 × 104 cells/cm2. Media were replaced with fresh DMEM containing 25 mm glucose and 1% (v/v) FBS, and cells were treated for 2 h with adenoviruses, at a similar multiplicity of infection. Media were then replaced by DMEM without glucose or FBS, and another incubation of 12–14 h was carried out. Cells were then incubated in DMEM in the absence or presence of 25 mm glucose, as described in the text and figure legends. At the end of each manipulation, cell monolayers were flash-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C until analysis. FTO2B Culture and Treatment with Recombinant Adenoviruses- FTO2B rat hepatoma cells (21Zvibel I. Fiorino A.S. Brill S. Reid L.M. Differentiation. 1998; 63: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) were cultured in 60-mm plates and kept in DMEM supplemented with 25 mm glucose and 10% (v/v) FBS. Media were replaced with fresh DMEM containing 25 mm glucose and 1% (v/v) FBS, and cells were treated for 2 h with adenoviruses at the same multiplicity of infection. After this time, media containing adenoviruses were replaced with fresh media containing 25 mm glucose and 1% (v/v) FBS, and cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Media were then replaced by DMEM without glucose or FBS, and another incubation of 12–14 h was performed. Cells were incubated in DMEM plus 25 mm glucose, as described in the text and figure legends. At the end of each manipulation, cell monolayers were frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C until analysis. Metabolite Determinations and Enzyme Activity Assays-To measure GS activity in cell culture assays, cell culture plates frozen in liquid nitrogen were scrapped using 100 μl of ice-cold homogenization buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm potassium fluoride, 15 mm EDTA, 15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.6 m sucrose, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 nm okadaic acid, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml pepsatin. The extracts were passed 10 times through a 25-gauge needle. Protein concentration was measured following the method of Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad assay reagent. GS activity was measured in homogenates or in the supernatant and pellet fraction of hepatocyte extracts centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, in the presence or absence of 6.6 mm Glc-6-P (23Thomas J.A. Schlender K.K. Larner J. Anal. Biochem. 1968; 25: 486-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). GS activity measured in the presence of Glc-6-P informs on the total amount of enzyme, whereas measurement in the absence of Glc-6-P is an indication of the active GS form(s). The -/+ Glc-6-P activity ratio is an estimation of the activation state of the enzyme. Glycogen content was determined using an amyloglucosidase-based assay, as described elsewhere (24Newgard C.B. Hirsch L.J. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8046-8052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting-15 μg of protein of the GS activity homogenates was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with the following antibodies: a rabbit antibody against rat LGS (16Garcia-Rocha M. Roca A. De La Iglesia N. Baba O. Fernandez-Novell J.M. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), a rabbit antibody against GS phosphorylated on Ser640 (PGS Ser640, Cell Signaling), or a mouse antibody against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Sigma). We also used a polyclonal affinity purified antibody generated against GS phosphorylated on site 2. The antibody was raised in rabbit against the peptide LRGRSLpS-VTSLGGL, which resembles residues 1–14 of rat LGS (PGS Ser7, Davids Biotechnologie). Secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase against rabbit (GE Healthcare) or mouse (Dako Cytomation) immunoglobulins were used. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using an ECL Plus kit (GE Healthcare), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Signals were quantified using Image J Software (NIH). Immunocytochemistry-Hepatocytes seeded on collagen-coated coverslips (Sigma) were fixed for 30 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. After fixation, cells were incubated with 1 mg/ml NaBH4 for 10 min and permeabilized for 20 min with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100. After 10 min of blocking with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin (w/v), incubation with the primary and secondary antibodies was carried out. Coverslips were washed, air-dried, and mounted onto glass slides using Mowiol (Sigma). We used primary antibodies against rat total LGS (16Garcia-Rocha M. Roca A. De La Iglesia N. Baba O. Fernandez-Novell J.M. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and a monoclonal antibody against glycogen (25Baba O. Kokubyo Gakkai Zasshi. 1993; 60: 264-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (a gift from O. Baba, Tokyo Medical and Dental University). The secondary antibodies used were red dye-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Anti-rabbit Texas Red, Jackson) and tetramethylrhodamine (TRITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (Chemicon). Statistical Analysis-Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by the unpaired Student’s t test using Microsoft Excel (version XP; Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA). Statistical significance was assumed at p ≤ 0.05. Effect of the Mutation of the Regulatory Sites on LGS Activity- To identify the key phosphorylation sites that regulate LGS activity, we generated seven adenoviral constructs coding for mutant forms of rat LGS. In each mutant one of the seven Ser residues homologous to the MGS phosphorylation sites (Fig. 1) was replaced by an Ala residue, thereby mimicking dephosphorylation. The mutated residues were Ser7 (site 2), Ser10 (site 2a), Ser640 (site 3a), Ser644 (site 3b), Ser648 (site 3c), Ser652 (site 4), and Ser656 (site 5) and the corresponding mutant forms are referred to as LGS 2, 2a, 3a, 3b, 3c, 4, or 5, respectively, and combinations thereof, when appropriate. Rat primary hepatocytes were infected with these adenoviruses or with control adenoviruses encoding β-galactosidase from Escherichia coli (β-galactosidase) or wild-type rat LGS (LGS WT). Because glucose induces the dephosphorylation and activation of LGS (26De Wulf H. Hers H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 2: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 27De Wulf H. Stalmans W. Hers H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 15: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 28Katz J. Golden S. Wals P.A. Biochem. J. 1979; 180: 389-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), all assays were performed in the absence of the monosaccharide to prevent dephosphorylation of the Ser residues that were not mutated. By analyzing total GS activity in cell homogenates, we first checked that similar amounts of the LGS WT and mutant forms were expressed in all cases (Fig. 2A). We then measured the GS activity ratio in the supernatant and pellet fractions of the hepatocyte extracts expressing the various constructs (Fig. 2B). The endogenous total GS activity of the hepatocytes, as determined in the control cells that overexpress β-galactosidase (Fig. 2A), is negligible compared with the total activity found in the hepatocyte extracts overexpressing LGS WT or the phosphorylation mutants. Therefore, the activity ratios measured can be directly assigned to each mutant without any further correction. Although mutations at sites 2a, 3c, 4, and 5 did not cause a significant change in the activation state of the enzyme, the LGS 3a and LGS 3b variants showed a moderate increase of the activity ratio (around 0.4), and the mutation at site 2 resulted in a large increase of this ratio up to 0.6, both in the supernatant and pellet fractions. We examined whether the activation induced by constitutive dephosphorylation of site 2 could be increased by the simultaneous dephosphorylation of a second site. The LGS variants that combine Ser to Ala substitutions at site 2 plus an additional site showed somewhat higher activity ratios, although the differences were not statistically significant when compared with LGS 2. Expression of LGS Phosphorylation Mutants in FTO2B Cells-Among hepatoma cell lines, FTO2B cells show the most consistent hepatocyte-like phenotype (21Zvibel I. Fiorino A.S. Brill S. Reid L.M. Differentiation. 1998; 63: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although this cell line expresses LGS, the enzyme is maintained in a highly phosphorylated inactive form, and these cells are unable to synthesize glycogen when incubated with glucose. Glycogen deposition can be restored through the expression of glucokinase (29Valera A. Bosch F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 30Gomis R.R. Cid E. Garcia-Rocha M. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23246-23252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The increased intracellular levels of Glc-6-P promote LGS allosteric activation but also its dephosphorylation by endogenous phosphatases (31Villar-Palasi C. Guinovart J.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 544-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Given its lack of glucokinase, the FTO2B cell line is an adequate model to study the activation status of the LGS phosphorylation mutants and their capacity to drive glycogen deposition in the presence of glucose, without promoting the dephosphorylation of other LGS sites. FTO2B cells were infected with adenoviruses encoding LGS WT or the mutant forms and were incubated in the presence of glucose. Determination of total GS activity showed that LGS WT and the mutant forms were expressed to similar levels (Fig. 3A). The activity ratios determined in the homogenates of FTO2B cells expressing endogenous LGS (cells infected with the β-galactosidase adenovirus), LGS WT, or the LGS 3a, 3b, or 3c variants were about 0.1 or below, whereas the extracts of cells expressing LGS 2, or the double mutants at this site plus one additional site, showed activity ratios above 0.5 (Fig. 3B). As in the experiments performed with hepatocytes, the differences between the activity ratios of the single LGS 2 mutant and the double mutants were not statistically significant. It must be noted that, because endogenous GS activity of the FTO2B cells was not negligible compared with the activity of the cells overexpressing LGS WT or the mutant forms (it represented from ∼1/5 to 1/3 of the total GS activity; Fig. 3A), the activity ratios determined in the FTO2B homogenates are an underestimation of the true values of the mutant forms with activity ratios higher than 0.1. Assuming that the activity ratio of 0.1, determined for endogenous LGS in control FTO2B cells infected with the β-galactosidase adenovirus (Fig. 3B), does not change in cells expressing LGS 2, the corrected figure for this mutant is 0.6. These ratios nicely correlated with the capacity of the corresponding LGS phosphorylation mutants to trigger glycogen deposition in FTO2B cells: LGS WT and the 3a, 3b, and 3c variants produced very low levels of glycogen, similar to those found in control cells overexpressing β-galactosidase, whereas the single and double mutants containing the Ser to Ala mutation at site 2 yielded significantly higher levels of the polysaccharide (Fig. 3C). Analysis of the Interaction between Phosphorylation Sites- We analyzed whether the Ser to Ala mutations of the other regulatory sites had any influence on the phosphorylation status of sites 2 and 3a of LGS expressed in hepatocytes. Using antibodies that recognize total LGS or LGS phosphorylated site 2 (Ser(P)7), we performed Western blot analysis of hepatocytes expressing LGS WT or the LGS single point mutants. Constitutive dephosphorylation of any of the other sites did not cause a significant reduction in the phosphate content of site 2 (Fig. 4A). A similar analysis was performed using an antibody that recognizes LGS only when site 3a is phosphorylated (Ser(P)640). In this case, for the LGS 3b variant there was a measurable decrease in phosphorylation at site 3a, whereas the remaining LGS mutants were all effectively phosphorylated at this site (Fig. 4B). Obviously, LGS 2 and LGS 3a were not detected by the antibodies that recognize the corresponding phosphoserines 7 and 640, respectively. As also observed for MGS (4Skurat A.V. Wang Y. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25534-25542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the LGS electrophoretic mobility in SDS-PAGE gels increased when sites 3a and/or 3b were dephosphorylated. Only the bands of LGS variants in which sites 3a or 3b were mutated presented larger mobility (Fig. 4). This observation corroborates the previous finding that Ser to Ala mutations at the other NH2- or COOH-terminal regulatory sites of LGS do not prevent phosphorylation of sites 3a and 3b. Effect of the Mutation of the Regulatory Sites on the Intracellular Distribution of LGS-Incubation of isolated hepatocytes with glucose activates LGS and also causes its translocation from a homogeneous cytoplasmic distribution to the cell periphery (15Fernandez-Novell J.M. Bellido D. Vilaro S. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Garcia-Rocha M. Roca A. De La Iglesia N. Baba O. Fernandez-Novell J.M. Ferrer J.C.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To evaluate the impact of the phosphorylation status of the regulatory sites on LGS subcellular distribution, we performed immunofluorescence analyses on hepatocytes expressing the LGS variants. Using the control hepatocytes infected with the β-galactosidase adenovirus, confocal laser intensity was adjusted so that endogenous LGS signal was not observable. Hepatocytes overexpressing LGS WT showed an enzyme uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm in the absence of glucose, as described for endogenous LGS (15Fernandez-Novell J.M. Bellido D. Vilaro S. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Garcia-Rocha M. Roca A. De La Iglesia N. Baba O. Fernandez-Novell J.M. Ferrer J.C. Guinovart J.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, LGS 2 presented the characteristic speckled pattern of a translocated enzyme at the initial stages of glycogen deposition, even when the hepatocytes were incubated in the absence of glucose. The remaining single-site LGS mutants behaved like LGS WT (Fig. 5). The double Ser to Ala mutations at site 2 plus one of the other six regulatory sites also produced enzymes that, in the absence of glucose, concentrated in the form of speckles near the hepatocyte cortex (data not shown). Because the pattern shown by the LGS 2 mutant was characteristic of hepatocytes synthesizing glycogen, we checked whether this mutant was able to drive the deposition of the polysaccharide in hepatocytes incubated without glucose. Immunofluorescence analysis with an antiglycogen antibody (25Baba O. Kokubyo Gakkai Zasshi. 1993; 60: 264-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) showed that whereas hepatocytes expressing LGS WT or any of the other mutants did not accumulate glycogen in the absence of glucose, cells overexpressing LGS 2 (Fig. 6) or LGS double mutants (site 2 plus another site; data not shown) did synthesize glycogen, even in these conditions.FIGURE 6Glycogen immunocytochemistry of primary rat hepatocytes expressing single site phosphorylation mutants of LGS.

The scale bar represents 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Finally, we examined whether translocation could be disassociated from glycogen synthesis. To this end, we generated adenovirus coding for the catalytically inactive variants LGS E509A and LGS 2 + 3b E509A. We have previously shown that in MGS the replacement of Glu509 by an Ala residue yields an inactive enzyme (13Cid E. Gomis R.R. Geremia R.A. Guinovart J.J. Ferrer J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33614-33621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes infected with these adenoviruses expressed similar amounts of the corresponding mutant enzymes, as revealed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 7A). The extracts of control hepatocytes infected with the β-galactosidase adenovirus and those of cells overexpressing LGS E509A and LGS 2 + 3b E509A showed identical total GS activity (Fig. 7B), thereby confirming that the catalytic mechanism of LGS was impaired by the mutation. Accordingly, no changes were found in the glycogen content of LGS E509A, LGS 2 + 3b E509A, and β-galactosidase overexpressing cells (Fig. 7C). Confocal microscopy analysis of the intracellular distribution of LGS E509A and LGS 2 + 3b E509A in cultured hepatocytes revealed that, in both the presence and absence of glucose, the two catalytically inactive mutants exhibited a distribution identical to the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 8). In the absence of glucose they uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm, but concentrated in the cell cortex when the monosaccharide was added, probably binding to glycogen produced by the endogenous enzyme.FIGURE 8Immunofluorescence analysis of catalytically inactive mutants of LGS expressed in hepatocytes expressing.

A key intracellular enzyme in the GNB/LNB pathway is a β-1,3-galactosyl-N-acetylhexosamine phosphorylase (Gal-HexNAcP; EC 2.4.1.211). GalHexNAcP catalyzes the phosphorolysis of GNB and LNB into α-d-galactose 1-phosphate (Gal1P) and corresponding N-acetylhexosamines with anomeric inversion (Fig. 1) (1Kitaoka M. Tian J. Nishimoto M.

Microbiol. 2008; 74: 6333-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Interestingly, most of the members of GH112 (GLNBP gene homologues) are found in human commensal or pathogenic bacteria as hypothetical proteins through genome projects. GNB and LNB structures are often found in biologically functional glycoconjugates of animals. GNB exists in O-glycans of mucin glycoproteins as core 1 or T-antigen disaccharide and also in glycosphingolipids (11van den Steen P. Rudd P.M. Dwek R.A. Opdenakker G. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

These two similar disaccharides are important oligosaccharides in cell surface glycoconjugates, and cancer-associated antigens have structures related to them (17Magnani J.L. Steplewski Z.

The presence of the genes in commensal and pathogenic bacteria suggests that the enzymes play an important role in their growth in human tissues by utilizing GNB and/or LNB as nutrients.Bifidobacteria naturally colonize the human intestinal tract and have health-promoting effects, such as prevention of diarrhea (20Saavedra J.M.

Katayama T. Fushinobu S. Wakagi T. Shoun H. Sugimoto H. Tanaka A. Kumagai H. Ashida H. Kitaoka M. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13165-13173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition, the pathway includes a set of intracellular enzymes to send the entire molecules of the reaction product of GLNBP (Gal1P, GalNAc, and GlcNAc) into the glycolytic and amino sugar metabolic pathways (28Nishimoto M. Kitaoka M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2007; 73: 6444-6449Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Before the cellular uptake, GNB and LNB are liberated from their natural substrates by the bifidobacterial extracellular enzymes, endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (29Fujita K. Oura F. Nagamine N.

Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2008; 74: 3996-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We have hypothesized that a key role of this pathway is to metabolize LNB in human milk oligosaccharides (1Kitaoka M. Tian J. Nishimoto M. Appl. Environ.

In contrast to the gut contents of formula-fed infants, the guts of breast-fed infants generally contain microflora dominated by bifidobacteria (32Penders J. Thijs C. Vink C. Stelma F.F. Snijders B.

Therefore, the selective growth of bifidobacteria observed in breast-fed infants has been attributed to human milk oligosaccharides (32Penders J. Thijs C. Vink C. Stelma F.F. Snijders B.

For example, pyridoxal phosphate-dependent glycogen phosphorylase shares structural and mechanistic similarities with typical NDP-dependent glycosyltransferases (GTs) (39Withers S.G. Wakarchuk W.W. Strynadka N.C. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1270-1273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and is classified in the GT35 family. In contrast, some phosphorylases are very similar to standard GHs in their structures and reaction mechanisms (40Fushinobu S. Hidaka M. Miyanaga A. Imamura H. J. Appl. Glycosci. 2007; 54: 95-102Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, sugar phosphorylases are classified in both the GH and GT classes in the CAZy Database. Another important aspect of phosphorylases is their ability to produce oligosaccharides due to the reversible nature of their reactions (41Kitaoka M. Hayashi K. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 2002; 14: 35-50Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). GLNBP is actually used to prepare kilogram quantities of LNB (42Nishimoto M. Kitaoka M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2007; 71: 2101-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). As a candidate for the bona fide bifidus factor, LNB attracts considerable interest in applications to improve infant health. In this study, we determined the crystal structures of GLNBP from B. longum JCM1217 in several ligand-binding forms and elucidated the molecular mechanism of the reaction and structural basis for substrate specificity of GalHexNAcPs. This is the first three-dimensional structure of a GH112 enzyme.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESEnzyme Preparation-The nonlabeled GLNBP protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) and purified as described previously (2Nishimoto M. Kitaoka M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2007; 71: 1587-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The selenomethionine-labeled enzyme was expressed in the methionine auxotroph E. coli strain B834 (DE3) (Novagen). The purification procedures for the selenomethionine-labeled enzyme were the same as those for the nonlabeled enzyme. The point mutations of R32E, N166A, R210E, R358E, Y362F, Y362N, and F364N were made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The oligonucleotide primers are listed in Table S1. Preparation, purification, and activity measurements of the mutant enzymes were done as described previously (2Nishimoto M. Kitaoka M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2007; 71: 1587-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Crystallization and Data Collection-Ligand-free and selenomethionine-labeled GLNBP crystals were obtained at 4 °C using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method by mixing 2 μl of a protein solution with 2 μl of a reservoir solution composed of 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5), 0.2 m Mg(NO3)2, and 15% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 4000. Rodlike crystals (0.1 × 0.1 × 0.2 mm) grew within 3-7 days. The GalNAc complex form crystals were obtained by co-crystallization using a reservoir solution containing 100 mm GalNAc. The GlcNAc complex and GlcNAc-NO3-ethylene glycol (EG) complex form crystals were obtained by co-crystallization using a reservoir solution containing 100 mm GlcNAc. Crystals of the GlcNAc-SO4 complex were obtained by co-crystallization using a reservoir solution containing 100 mm GlcNAc and 50 mm MgSO4. The crystals were transferred to a reservoir solution containing 15% (v/v) glycerol (selenomethionine, ligand-free, GalNAc or GlcNAc complex, and GlcNAc-SO4) or 15% (v/v) EG (GlcNAc-NO3-EG) and then flash-cooled in a stream of cold nitrogen gas at 95 K. The data set for the selenomethionine-labeled crystal was collected at wavelengths of 0.9645 Å (remote), 0.9793 Å (peak), and 0.9797 Å (edge). X-ray diffraction data sets were collected using synchrotron radiation (beamline BL-5A, BL-17A, and NW12A; Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan). The data sets were processed and scaled using HKL2000 (43Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar).

The LNB, GNB, and Gal1P ligand models were prepared with the PCModel program (Serena Software, Bloomington, IN) and optimized using the MMX force field. Rotatable ligand bonds (13 in LNB and GNB and five in Gal1P) were defined using the AutoDockTools interface. The closed state subunit of the GlcNAc-NO3-EG form was prepared for docking by removing the water molecules except for those included in the GlcNAc/GalNAc interactions. Retaining these water molecules (shown in Fig. 3) was essential for GlcNAc docking into the subsite (+1). EG and GlcNAc were removed for LNB/GNB docking, and EG andNO3- were removed for Gal1P docking, respectively. One of the two alternative conformations of the Arg-32 side chain in the closed state subunit of the GlcNAc-NO3-EG form was selected based on its conformation in the GlcNAc-SO4 form. After adding polar hydrogens, Gasteiger charges were calculated for the ligand and protein. Grid maps were prepared with 40 × 40 × 40 points for LNB and GNB covering subsites -1 and +1 and ranges at 40 × 30 × 30 points for Gal1P covering subsite -1 and the anion binding site with a point spacing of 0.375 Å. The Lamarckian genetic algorithm of the AutoDock 4.0 package performed 200 iterations with a maximum of 27,000 generations per iteration, a population size of 50 individuals, and a maximum of 2.5 × 106 energy evaluations per generation. The results of the iterations were clustered so that no cluster member deviated >1.0 Å from other cluster members. After docking, all structures generated for a single compound were assigned to clusters based on a tolerance of 1.0 Å for all atom root mean square (r.m.s.) deviations from the lowest-energy structure. The results of cluster analyses are shown in Table S2. The best docking results with the lowest Einter values are shown in Fig. 3C and Fig. S2C.FIGURE 3Stereoviews of the interactions with the crystallographic (A and B) and docked (C) ligand molecules.

These structures also contain crystallization reagents (Mg2+ andNO3-) and cryoprotectants (glycerol or EG) at their molecular surfaces. Ligand-free, GalNAc complex, GlcNAc complex, and GlcNAc-SO4 crystals belong to space group P1 and contain four subunits per ASU, whereas GlcNAc-NO3-EG belongs to space group C2 and contains two subunits per ASU. The ASU contents in these crystal structures are summarized in Table 2. In all crystal forms, each of the two molecules forms a dimer, as shown in Fig. 2A. This should correspond to the dimeric form of this enzyme in solution (1Kitaoka M. Tian J. Nishimoto M. Appl. Environ.

The second domain, the Ig-like fold domain (residues 71-180; green), is inserted between β-3 and α-3 of a TIM barrel (Fig. S1). The remaining two regions form the α/β fold (residues 438-695; yellow) and the C-terminal β-sheet (residues 696-750; red) domains. The dimer interface is mainly formed by Ig-like and α/β fold domains (Fig. 2A), and the buried molecular surface area is about 2,060 Å2/subunit. Structures of the four subunits in the ASU are almost identical; the r.m.s. deviations for Cα atoms between all pairs are within 0.5 Å, except for the relatively flexible half-barrel unit and the C-terminal domain (for discussion, see below).GalNAc and GlcNAc Complex-In the GalNAc complex form, each subunit in the ASU holds a GalNAc molecule (Table 2). It is bound at the center of the C-terminal loop side of the TIM barrel domain. All of the four GalNAc molecules in the ASU are in an α-anomeric state and take a standard 4C1 conformation (Fig. 3A). In addition to the hydrophobic interactions that recognize the pyranose moiety of GalNAc, two direct and several water-mediated hydrogen bonds are present. One direct hydrogen bond is formed between the O3 atom of GalNAc and the side chain of Asp-313. This residue has been proposed to be the catalytic proton donor residue based on a mutational analysis (2Nishimoto M. Kitaoka M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2007; 71: 1587-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Another direct hydrogen bond is formed between the carbonyl oxygen atom of the N-acetyl group and the N∈ atom of the Trp-233 side chain. Most of the water-mediated hydrogen bonds are formed at one side of the GalNAc molecule (O1, O5, and O6). The water molecules are held by the side chains of Tyr-165, Glu-228, and Ser-612 (from the other subunit), and by the main chain carbonyl oxygen atom of His-460.The overall structure of the GalNAc complex is very similar to that of the ligand-free form (Fig. S2B). In the complex form, however, an α-helix region in the Ig-like domain (residues 160-170) shifts toward the ligand (Fig. 4C, green), and the Cα displacement is 1.5 Å at Val-162 (Fig. 4A). This regi"
https://openalex.org/W2053631465,"The cytochrome P-450 PikC from Streptomyces venezuelae exhibits significant substrate tolerance and performs multiple hydroxylation reactions on structurally variant macrolides bearing the deoxyamino sugar desosamine. In previously determined co-crystal structures (Sherman, D. H., Li, S., Yermalitskaya, L. V., Kim, Y., Smith, J. A., Waterman, M. R., and Podust, L. M. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 26289–26297), the desosamine moiety of the native substrates YC-17 and narbomycin is bound in two distinct buried and surface-exposed binding pockets, mediated by specific interactions between the protonated dimethylamino group and the acidic amino acid residues Asp50, Glu85, and Glu94. Although the Glu85 and Glu94 negative charges are essential for maximal catalytic activity of native enzyme, elimination of the surface-exposed negative charge at Asp50 results in significantly enhanced catalytic activity. Nevertheless, the D50N substitution could not rescue catalytic activity of PikCE94Q based on lack of activity in the corresponding double mutant PikCD50N/E94Q. To address the specific role for each desosamine-binding pocket, we analyzed the x-ray structures of the PikCD50N mutant co-crystallized with narbomycin (1.85Å resolution) and YC-17 (3.2Å resolution). In PikCD50N, the desosamine moiety of both YC-17 and narbomycin was bound in a catalytically productive “buried site.” This finding suggested a two-step substrate binding mechanism, whereby desosamine is recognized in the two subsites to allow the macrolide substrate to sequentially progress toward a catalytically favorable orientation. Collectively, the binding, mutagenesis, kinetic, and x-ray structural data suggest that enhancement of the catalytic activity of PikCD50N is due to the facilitated relocation of substrate to the buried site, which has higher binding affinity, as opposed to dissociation in solution from the transient “surface-exposed site.” The cytochrome P-450 PikC from Streptomyces venezuelae exhibits significant substrate tolerance and performs multiple hydroxylation reactions on structurally variant macrolides bearing the deoxyamino sugar desosamine.

The large macrolactone ring systems are derived from polymerization of simple carboxylic acid precursors catalyzed by modular polyketide synthases and often require further modification by specific tailoring enzymes (1Rix U. Fischer C. Remsing L.L. Rohr J. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 542-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) to acquire or enhance biological activity. The modular architecture of polyketide synthase gene clusters has led to the development of combinatorial biosynthetic approaches that aim to generate novel secondary metabolites through rational engineering of new combinations of polyketide synthase modules (2Hutchinson C.R. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 3Walsh C.T. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 4Sherman D.H. Nat.

Tailoring enzymes, including cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases (P-450), 2The abbreviations used are: P-450, cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. are usually encoded within macrolide biosynthetic pathways (5Podust L.M. Bach H. Kim Y. Lamb D.C. Arase M. Sherman D.H. Kelly S.L. Waterman M.R. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 255-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). P-450 enzymes mainly serve to introduce hydroxyl or epoxide functional groups to nascent macrolactone structures or their glycosylated products (1Rix U. Fischer C. Remsing L.L. Rohr J. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 542-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 3Walsh C.T. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To date, only three macrolide P-450 monooxygenases including EryF, EpoK, and PikC have been studied at both enzymatic and structural levels. Therefore, the principles of substrate recognition and regio- and stereochemical selectivity are just beginning to emerge for this intriguing group of biosynthetic enzymes. Streptomyces venezuelae P-450 PikC displays a relatively broad substrate and regiospecificity compared with EryF (6Andersen J.F. Tatsuta K. Gunji H. Ishiyama T. Hutchinson C.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1905-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and EpoK (7Ogura H. Nishida C.R. Hoch U.R. Perera R. Dawson J.H. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14712-14721Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This characteristic combined with robust catalytic efficiency as a single component engineered biocatalyst (8Li S. Podust L.M. Sherman D.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 12940-12941Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) has motivated us to further its development as a prototype P-450 monooxygenase directed toward metabolic engineering and synthetic chemical applications. 3S. Li, M. R. Chaulagain, L. M. Podust, J. Montgomery, and D. H. Sherman, unpublished data. Thus, PikC performs multiple hydroxylations of structurally variant macrolides including the 12-membered ring YC-17 and 14-membered ring narbomycin, leading to methymycin/neomethymycin and the natural ketolide antibiotic pikromycin, respectively (10Xue Y. Wilson D. Zhao L. Liu H.-w. Sherman D.H. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 661-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) (Scheme 1). Ketolides are macrolide derivatives characterized by a C-3 keto group that have received significant attention recently because of their enhanced activity against drug-resistant microbial pathogens (11Ma Z. Nemoto P.A. Curr. Med. Chem. 2002; 1: 15-34Google Scholar). Both endogenous PikC substrates are glycosylated with the 3-(dimethylamino)-3,4,6-trideoxy sugar desosamine that confers antibiotic activity to a number of macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin, troleandomycin, mycinamicin, megalomicin (desosamine), tylosin, carbomycin, spiramycin (mycaminose, having an additional hydroxyl group at the C-4 position of the sugar ring), and a highly potent semisynthetic ketolide telithromycin (11Ma Z.

PikC has also been shown to function effectively when immobilized on a microfluidic biochip (21Srinivasan A. Bach H. Sherman D.H. Dordick J.S. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2004; 88: 528-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and when fused to a heterologous electron donor (8Li S. Podust L.M. Sherman D.H. J. Am. Chem.

Chem. 2006; 281: 26289-26297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) revealed that YC-17 and narbomycin bind in the PikC active site via overlapping modes sharing the macrolactone-binding site and utilizing distinct desosamine binding regions, including buried and surface-exposed pockets, respectively. In both modes, the protonated dimethylamino group of desosamine binds between two negatively charged carboxyl groups of amino acid residues forming a salt bridge with the proximal (relative to the dimethyamino moiety) carboxyl and an ionic contact with the distal one. The triad of carboxylate residues Asp50, Glu85, and Glu94 located in the BC loop provides this set of interactions. Elimination of the negative charge at Glu85 or Glu94 by site-directed mutagenesis virtually inactivates (Glu94) or substantially reduces (Glu85) conversion of both substrates (23Sherman D.H. Li S. Yermalitskaya L.V. Kim Y. Smith J.A. Waterman M.R. Podust L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26289-26297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In contrast, elimination of the surface-exposed negative charge at Asp50 via substitution of this residue with asparagine significantly enhances catalytic activity of PikC. To address the specific role for each desosamine-binding pocket, we analyzed the x-ray structures of the catalytically superior PikCD50N mutant co-crystallized with narbomycin or YC-17. In PikCD50N, YC-17 adopts the same binding mode as observed previously in the wild type, with desosamine bound in the buried pocket. In contrast to the previously observed binding mode in wild type PikC, narbomycin was also found predominantly in the buried pocket in the corresponding D50N mutant form, suggesting the possibility of initial substrate recognition in the “surface-exposed site,” with subsequent relocation to the catalytic “buried site.” We herein report PikC substrate binding, enzyme mutagenesis, and kinetic data to support this hypothesis and provide evidence for kinetic control over substrate dissociation versus relocation to the PikC catalytic pocket. Preparation of Protein Samples—Expression vectors for PikC wild type and mutants were used to transform Escherichia coli strain HMS174(DE3) to express and subsequently purify proteins according to the protocol described elsewhere (23Sherman D.H. Li S. Yermalitskaya L.V. Kim Y. Smith J.A. Waterman M.R. Podust L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26289-26297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The double mutants PikCD50N/E94Q and PikCD50N/E85Q represent new constructs prepared in this study. The quality of the purified proteins was assessed by the SDS-PAGE and UV-visible spectroscopy, and the concentration was determined at 450 nm from the difference spectra between the carbon monoxide-bound ferrous and water-bound ferric forms using the extinction coefficient of 91,000 m–1 cm–1 (24Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2379-2385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of Substrates—Substrates YC-17 and narbomycin were obtained from the pikC knock-out strain S. venezuelae AX-906 (10Xue Y. Wilson D. Zhao L. Liu H.-w. Sherman D.H. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 661-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Alternatively, narbomycin was harvested from fermentation culture of Streptomyces narbonensis NRRL B-1680 in soluble complete medium, containing 15 g of soluble starch, 20 g of soytone, 1.5 g of yeast extract, 10.5 g of MOPS, 0.1 g of CaCl2 at pH 7.2, per 1 liter of deionized water. Equilibrium Binding Assay—Spectroscopic substrate binding assay was carried out at room temperature using a UV-visible spectrophotometer 300 Bio (Cary). Protein dissolved in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithioerythritol, and 10% glycerol at concentrations ranging from 1 to 2 μm was titrated with the substrate dissolved in Me2SO (20 mm) in 1-μl aliquots. The same amounts of Me2SO alone were added to the protein in the reference cuvette followed by recording of the difference spectra. Absorbance differences ΔA (Apeak 389 nm – Atrough 422 nm) were plotted versus substrate concentration, and data from duplicated experiments were fitted to the hyperbolic function ΔA = (Amax(S/KD + S), where S is the total ligand concentration, Amax is the maximal absorption shift at saturation, and KD is the apparent dissociation constant for the enzyme-ligand complex. Catalytic Activity Assay—Enzymatic conversion of YC-17 or narbomycin in vitro were performed using a previously developed assay (10Xue Y. Wilson D. Zhao L. Liu H.-w. Sherman D.H. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 661-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The standard reaction contained 1 μm PikC (wild type or mutant form), 0.5 mm YC-17 or narbomycin, 3.5 μm spinach ferredoxin, 0.01 units of spinach ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase, and 1 mm NADPH in 100 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithioerythritol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. The reaction was terminated after 40 min of incubation at 30 °C by the addition of 3 × 300 μl of chloroform. The extractions were subsequently combined, dried, and dissolved in 120 μl of methanol and subjected to the reverse phase HPLC using a X-Bridge C18, 5 μm, 250-mm column (Waters Corporation) in a linear gradient (30–60%) of acetonitrile in 10 mm ammonium acetate, pH 8.1, at the flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Detection was at 238 nm. Pre-steady State Binding Assay—Stopped flow kinetic analysis experiments were conducted at 23 °C using a Hi-Tech Scientific instrument equipped with a photodiode array detector and controlled by the KinetAsyst software (Bradford on Avon, UK). Protein and narbomycin solutions were prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.5 mm EDTA. Narbomycin stock solution was in Me2SO; therefore, solvent concentration was adjusted in both syringes and maintained constant (0.5%) throughout the experiments. Protein concentration after mixing was 10 μm. To maintain pseudo first order reaction conditions, all of the measurements were carried out in 10-fold excess of narbomycin over the protein. Kinetic transients were recorded for 0.5 s at 390 nm corresponding to the peak of the difference spectra between the high spin substrate-bound and the low spin substrate-free PikC forms. Multiple kinetic traces for each sample were measured and averaged prior to data analysis. The data points from 2 to 500 ms were fitted to a standard double exponential function using SPECFIT software. Crystallization and Data Collection—PikCD50N from the 1 mm frozen stock stored at –80 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA was mixed with either YC-17 or narbomycin, both dissolved in Me2SO at 50 mm stock concentration, to final concentrations of 0.2 mm for protein and 2 mm for the ligand. The mixtures were subjected to the automated screening of crystallization conditions (hanging drop crystallization protocol) using a nanoliter drop setter Mosquito (TTP LabTech) and commercial high throughput screening kits purchased from Hampton Research and Qiagen. Crystallization conditions generating crystals were identified and optimized further in 24-well crystallization plates. The crystals used for x-ray data collection were obtained at 23 °C for the PikCD50N-YC-17 complex from 20% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m Bis-Tris, pH 6.5, and 0.2 m Li2SO4, and for the PikCD50N-narbomycin complex from 16% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 m sodium cacodilate, pH 6.5, and 0.15 m Li2SO4. Prior to data collection, the crystals were cryo-protected by plunging into a drop of reservoir solution supplemented with 20% glycerol and flash frozen in the liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at 100–110 K at beamline 8.3.1, Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The images were integrated, and the intensities were merged by using the HKL2000 software suite (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Open table in a new tab Substrate Binding—Binding affinities of PikC wild type and the mutants for the native substrates, YC-17 and narbomycin, and their aglycone precursors, 10-deoxymethynolide and narbonolide, were deduced from a low to high spin iron spectral shift, known as type I binding (32Schenkman J.B. Remmer H. Estabrook R.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1967; 3: 113-123PubMed Google Scholar). Both narbonolide and 10-deoxymethynolide bound PikC with the significantly reduced affinities compared with the corresponding glycosylated substrates (Table 2), which may explain, at least in part, lack of hydroxylation by PikC. Binding affinity for YC-17 (KD = 98.9 μm) was 2.3 times higher than narbomycin (234.5 μm) (Fig. 1, panels A1 and B1). Compared with wild type enzyme, binding affinities of the catalytically more active PikCD50N increased about 4-fold for YC-17 (27.2 μm) and 1.3-fold for narbomycin (171.9 μm)(panels A2/B2). PikCE85Q had reduced binding affinities for both substrates compared with wild type enzyme (panels A3/B3). Binding affinities for PikCE94Q were even further reduced (panels A4/B4), although the KD values could not be determined for YC-17 because saturation of enzyme could not be approached because of both low binding affinity and limited substrate solubility. Additionally, D50N substitution did not significantly affect binding in the double mutants (Table 2 and Fig. 1, panels 5 and 6).TABLE 2The values of dissociation constants (KD) for natural PikC substrates and their aglyconesEnzymeKDKDYC-17Narbomycin10-DeoxymethynolideNarbononolideμmmmPikCwild type98.9 ± 1.9234.5 ± 15.02.1 ± 0.821.1 ± 12.2PikCD50N27.2 ± 0.6171.9 ± 14.70.9 ± 0.32.1 ± 1.5PikCE85Q340.3 ± 31.5351.6 ± 54.1NDbND, not determined.NDPikCE94Q–aBinding curves (Fig. 1, panels A4 and A6) could not be fitted.1056.8 ± 212.4NDNDPikCD50N/E85Q289.6 ± 28.8459.0 ± 64.7NDNDPikCD50N/E94Q–aBinding curves (Fig. 1, panels A4 and A6) could not be fitted.861.0 ± 567.4NDNDa Binding curves (Fig. 1, panels A4 and A6) could not be fitted.b ND, not determined.

The kinetic rate of the first binding step (accounting for ∼50% of the reaction amplitude) was fast and protein-dependent (Table 3). The rate of the second step was slow, 13 s–1, and virtually identical between the wild type and both mutant forms (D50N and E85Q) of PikC. The first binding rate of the catalytically superior PikCD50N was twice as fast as that of the low activity mutant PikCE85Q: 822.8 ± 21.8 s–1 versus 421.4 ± 18.4 s–1, respectively, with the wild type determined to be more similar to the D50N mutant at 703.0 ± 29.1 s–1. We assume that the first binding step represents a pseudo first order reaction of the bimolecular encounter between PikC and narbomycin, whereas the second slow step may reflect monomolecular conformational adjustments of substrate position in the active site assisted by PikC dynamics (23Sherman D.H.

Because of small changes in the absolute spectra used to monitor the reaction and the limited solubility of narbomycin, we were unable to accurately estimate the kon from the concentration dependence of the observed rates. Also, the pseudo first order rate for PikCD50N may be underestimated because of instrument limitations for monitoring fast reactions.TABLE 3Pre-steady state kinetic parameters of narbomycin bindingEnzymek1k2s-1s-1PikCwild type703.0 ± 29.113.5 ± 0.08PikCD50N822.0 ± 21.813.2 ± 0.07PikCE85Q421.4 ± 18.413.7 ± 0.10 Open table in a new tab X-ray Structure of the PikCD50N-YC-17 Complex—The crystal structure of the PikCD50N-YC-17 complex was determined to a resolution of 3.2 Å (Table 1). Although determined at relatively low resolution, the electron density for YC-17 in both protein monomers in an asymmetric unit was well defined, showing no ambiguity for macrolide binding (Fig. 3). In both monomers (superimposable with the root mean square deviation of 0.43 Å), YC-17 was bound in the active site with desosamine positioned in the buried pocket anchored via the dimethylamino group to the side chain of Glu94 and Glu85, similar to what has been observed for wild type PikC (23Sherman D.H.

X-ray Structure of the PikCD50N-Narbomycin Complex—Although they share the same space group and the unit cell dimensions as the PikCD50N-YC-17 (Table 1), PikCD50N-narbomycin crystals diffracted to a higher resolution (1.85 Å), revealing new details of the protein-substrate interactions. Although two protein monomers in the asymmetric unit had virtually identical overall conformations (root mean square deviation of 0.34 Å), the desosamine moiety of narbomycin was found in both alternative pockets. In the chain B form, desosamine was unambiguously bound in the buried pocket with the dimethylamino group positioned between the Glu94 and Glu85 side chains (Fig. 4A). This binding mode has been previously characterized for YC-17 but not for narbomycin (23Sherman D.H. Li S. Yermalitskaya L.V. Kim Y. Smith J.A. Waterman M.R. Podust L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26289-26297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the chain A form, electron density for the macrolactone ring of narbomycin was clearly defined, whereas electron density for desosamine was split between both buried and surface-exposed pockets, suggesting two alternative conformations (Fig. 4B), each refined with the occupancy of 0.5. The buried conformation (cyan in Fig. 4B) superimposed well between the A and B monomer, whereas the surface-exposed conformation in monomer A(pink) superimposed with the position observed for narbomycin in the wild type enzyme (23Sherman D.H.

Interestingly, in the surface-exposed pocket of PikCD50N, the dimethylamino group of desosamine was located between the carboxyl group of Glu85 and the carboxamide group of Asn50 substituting for Asp50. In addition, subtle differences were observed for the macrolactone portion of narbomycin between the two binding modes (Fig. 4B). Catalytic Activity of PikC Mutants—The catalytic activity of the double mutants PikCD50N/E94Q and PikCD50N/E85Q was addressed simultaneously with the panel of single PikC mutants characterized previously (23Sherman D.H.

Enhanced catalytic activity for PikCD50N and attenuated catalytic activity for PikCE94Q were confirmed (Fig. 5 and Table 4). As before, residual catalytic conversion by PikCE94Q was observed for narbomycin, 5.4% versus 35.0% for the wild type, but not for YC-17 (Fig. 5, panels A5 and B5 and Table 4). In accord with previous results (23Sherman D.H. Li S. Yermalitskaya L.V. Kim Y. Smith J.A. Waterman M.R. Podust L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26289-26297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), E85Q substitution notably reduced but did not entirely eliminate both catalytic activities (Fig. 5, panels A4/B4, and Table 4). Significantly, introduction of the D50N substitution failed to rescue catalytic activity of the double mutants (Fig. 5, compare panels 4 and 5 with panels 6 and 7, respectively), revealing the dominant impact of the E94 interaction for PikC function.TABLE 4Conversion of YC-17 and narbomycin by different PikC forms represented in Fig. 5EnzymePanel in Fig. 5Conversion of YC-17Conversion of narbomycin (% of total)% of totalProduct 2:3 ratioPikC-wtA2/B240.00.8135.0D50NA3/B360.01.1544.4E85QA4/B418.00.268.1E94QA5/B505.4D50N/E85QA6/B618.40.383.5D50N/E94QA7/B705.3 Open table in a new tab Desosamine plays a fascinating parallel role both in targeting macrolide molecules to the 50 S bacterial ribosomal subunit (33Hansen J.L.

In each case, the N,N-dimethylamino group of the sugar provides a key interaction for anchoring the macrolactone in its specific binding site. Antibiotic action is achieved through blockage of the peptide exit site resulting from precise macrolide interactions (35Jenni S. Ban N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Sugar anchoring also provides the basis for hydroxylation in the active site of P-450 monooxygenases PikC (23Sherman D.H. Li S.

Sherman D.H. Chem. Biol. 2008; 15: 950-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As shown previously for PikC, the specific interactions between the protonated dimethylamino group of desosamine and the carboxyl-containing residues in the binding site are required for the catalytic activity. Nonglycosylated substrate precursors narbonolide and 10-deoxymethynolide, are very weakly bound with KD values in the millimolar range (Table 2) and do not serve as substrates for PikC. Thus, given the importance of negative charges associated with Glu85 and Glu94, the enhancement of catalytic activity in PikCD50N was surprising. In a search for determinants of improved catalytic function of PikCD50N, we have determined the x-ray structures for this mutant complexed with the native substrates YC-17 and narbomycin. Although YC-17 showed no binding ambiguity (Fig. 3), narbomycin adopted two alternative conformations in the active site of the mutant enzyme (Figs. 4 and 6). Moreover, for the 14-membered ring macrolide, 25% of protein molecules in the PikCD50N-narbomycin crystals had desosamine bound in the surface-exposed pocket, whereas the remaining molecules revealed desosamine associated with the buried pocket. The latter binding mode has not been observed for narbomycin previously. In the surface-exposed pocket of PikCD50N, the dimethylamino group of desosamine formed a salt bridge to the proximal Glu85 residue as it does in the wild type. However, the original ionic contact with the distal Asp50 was no longer available because of removal of the negative charge through asparagine substitution. We surmised that the loss of an electrostatic component might weaken protein-desosamine interactions in the surface-exposed pocket and facilitate desosamine relocation to the buried position, suggesting a catalytic role for this site. If so, the PikCD50N/E94Q double mutant should remain sensitive to the E94Q substitution. Alternatively, if D50N substitution favors hydroxylation from the surface-exposed pocket (given that the macrolactone is positioned similarly in respect to the iron center in both binding modes (Fig. 4B)), PikCD50N/E94Q should be insensitive to the E94Q mutation. To test both hypotheses, the catalytic activities of two double mutants, PikCD50N/E94Q and PikCD50N/E85Q, were analyzed. The D50N substitution could not rescue or even affect the functional activity of the double mutants (Fig. 5 and Table 4), supporting the facilitated relocation to the buried pocket as a factor that favors catalysis. Both the PikC mutagenesis studies and the crystal structure analysis suggest a two-step substrate binding mechanism whereby desosamine of the macrolide substrate initially binds to the surface-exposed pocket (Fig. 6A) and then relocates to the catalytic buried site (Fig. 6B). Because narbomycin is comprised of a 14-membered macrolactone ring, it could have a higher energetic barrier for conversion from one site to another and therefore was trapped entirely in the surface-exposed pocket in the crystals of the wild type enzyme (23Sherman D.H. Li S. Yermalitskaya L.V. Kim Y. Smith J.A. Waterman M.R. Podust L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26289-26297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and partially in the crystals of the PikCD50N mutant. The hampered relocation to the buried pocket might explain the reduced binding affinity of narbomycin compared with YC-17: 234.5 ± 15.0 μm versus 98.9 ± 1.9 μm (Table 2), because the substrate is presumed to be more easily released from the surface-exposed pocket than the buried one. Accordingly, the affinity of PikCD50N is higher toward both substrates because of facilitated access for desosamine to the buried pocket, which reduces dissociation of substrate from the surface-exposed site. Thus, the residual level of the PikCE94Q catalytic activity toward narbomycin (Fig. 5, panel B5, and Table 4) is readily explained by marginal hydroxylation from the surface-exposed pocket. In contrast, YC-17 is not hydroxylated by this mutant (Fig. 5, panel A5) because of rapid relocation to the buried pocket, where catalytic activity depends entirely on the interactions with Glu94. The residual level of hydroxylation demonstrated by PikCE85Q toward both substrates (Fig. 5, panels A4 and B4, and Table 4) suggests that relocation of each macrolide is affected in this mutant. Glu85 is centered between the two pockets (Fig. 6) and therefore may serve as a pivot in the transition of desosamine, because the latter may remain electrostatically “tethered” to the Glu85 carboxylate group during the relocation. Because introduction of the D50N substitution could not rescue catalysis (Fig. 5, panels A6 and B6, and Table 4), the residual hydroxylation by PikCE85Q is likely to occur from the surface-exposed pocket as well. Because of the dynamic constraints imposed upon narbomycin, we were able to assess kinetic binding rates between the PikC mutants by UV-visible spectroscopy combined with stopped flow kinetic studies. The kinetic trends were consistent with the equilibrium binding and functional data, because the catalytically superior PikCD50N bound narbomycin twice as fast as the poorly active PikCE85Q mutant enzyme under the same experimental conditions (Table 3). This observation suggests that the first kinetic rate likely reflects formation of the final buried complex rather than a transient one, and hence, transition from the surface-exposed to the buried site is the rate-limiting step of the substrate binding reaction. The regiospecificity of PikC is a particularly interesting characteristic of this enzyme. In all PikC/substrate co-crystal structures reported to date, the allylic carbon hydroxylation center in YC-17 (C-10) and narbomycin (C-12) is >7 Å away from the iron. The allylic C-H bond is the predominant hydroxylation site in narbomycin and one of two equally hydroxylated sites in YC-17, the second (methylene at C-12) positioned within 5 Å from the iron. Differences in the ratio of the YC-17 hydroxylation products between PikCD50N, PikCE85Q, and the wild type (Fig. 5 and Table 4) may be explained by dynamic variations in substrate binding making one site more favorably positioned for hydroxylation. At the same time, despite its 5 Å proximity to the iron reaction center, we have not observed hydroxylation of the methylene C-14 site in narbomycin by any PikC form in vitro, suggesting the possibility of additional steric or electronic factors that shift hydroxylation to the allylic C-12 site exclusively. Collectively, our data indicate that each of the triad carboxylic acid residues interacting with the positive charge of desosamine plays a particular role in PikC catalysis; surface-exposed Asp50 appears to function as a gate for substrate access to the active site through kinetic control over substrate dissociation in solution from the transient site versus transition to the catalytic buried site. Glu85 centered between two desosamine-binding pockets may serve as a pivot in desosamine relocation. Finally, Glu94 evidently plays a major role in tuning substrate orientation for effective catalysis.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the ability of AjA to limit the progress of inflammation might relate to an increase in LXA(4), a known anti-inflammatory and proresolving mediator. Addition of AjA (0-30 microM) in vitro to human blood and synovial cells increased production of LXA(4) (ELISA) 2- to 5-fold. Administration of AjA to mice with peritonitis resulted in a 25-75% reduction of cells invading the peritoneum, and a 7-fold increase in LXA(4) identified by mass spectrometry. Blockade of 12/15 LOX, which leads to LXA(4) synthesis via 15-HETE production, reduced (>90%) the ability of AjA to enhance production of LXA(4) in vitro. These results suggest that AjA and other agents that increase endogenous compounds that facilitate resolution of inflammation may be useful for conditions characterized by inflammation and tissue injury."

To further evaluate its role in cell fate determination, we investigated INSM1 effects on cell cycle function. The cyclin box of cyclin D1 is essential for INSM1 binding. Competitive pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation revealed that INSM1 binding to cyclin D1 interrupts its association with CDK4 and induces hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein. An inducible Tet-on system was established in Cos-7 and Panc-1 cells. Using serum starvation, we synchronized the cell cycle and subsequently induced cell cycle progression by serum stimulation. Comparison of the INSM1 induction group with the noninduced control group, INSM1 ectopic expression causes cell cycle arrest, whereas the INSM1-mediated cell cycle arrest could be reversed by cyclin D1 and CDK4 overexpression. The proline-rich N-terminal portion of INSM1 is required for cyclin D1 binding. Mutation of proline residues abolished cyclin D1 binding and also diminished its ability to induce cell cycle arrest. Cellular proliferation of Panc-1 cells was inhibited by INSM1 overexpression demonstrated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, soft agar colony formation, as well as tumor growth in a nude mouse model. Taken together, we provide evidence to support that INSM1 binds to cyclin D1, interrupts cell cycle signaling, and inhibits cellular proliferation."

Sialic acids are a family of carbohydrates with a nine-carbon backbone and are typically located at the distal end of glycan chains. There are over 50 natural derivatives within this family, and structural diversity is achieved through modifications such as acetylation, glycosylation, lactonization, and methylation at C4, C5, C7, C8, and C9, the most common molecule being N-acetylneuraminic acid (1Angata T.

Such is their structural diversity that they are a fundamental component of many biological processes such as cell recognition, adhesion, defense, activation of cellular pathways, sialylation and desialylation events, and cell surface modification. Furthermore, the presence of sialic acids at the termini of glycoconjugates can be exploited by pathogens to allow entry into host cells (2Lehmann F. Tiralongo E. Tiralongo J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 1331-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Sialic acid recognition is mediated via lectins or lectin-like molecules and their corresponding receptors (3Lis H. Sharon N. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 637-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar). In most cases, sialic acid binding lectins, which also include several viral glycoproteins and bacterial toxins (2Lehmann F. Tiralongo E. Tiralongo J. Cell Mol.

Rev. 2004; 56: 527-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), bind to their receptor with relatively high affinity due to the multivalent nature of these molecules, thus alleviating the low intrinsic affinity that most protein-carbohydrate interactions are associated with (7Lee R.T.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3009-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Generally, association constants (Ka) for the binding of monovalent and divalent sialosides by such lectins can reach 104 m-1. However, by virtue of their multivalency, some sialic acid binding lectins can interact with multivalent cell surface glycans to achieve affinities reaching 109 m-1 by an avidity effect. These enhanced affinities have been shown in part to be due to improved structural packing of proteins promoted by ligand binding, associated with favorable binding energetics (9Williams D.H.

One of the best studied multivalent lectin-sialic acid interactions is the influenza virus trimeric hemagglutinin, which can achieve affinities up to 108 m-1 compared with around 4 × 102 m-1 when one or both of the entities are not in a multivalent state (12Mammen M. Choi S.-K. Whitesides G.M. Angew Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1998; 37: 2754-2794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sialidases, or neuraminidases, catalyze the hydrolysis of sialic acids from a variety of glycoconjugates and are often modular enzymes, containing accessory modules attached to the catalytic core of the protein. Some of these modules have been identified as carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs). 3The abbreviations used are: CBM, carbohydrate-binding module; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TEV, tobacco etch virus; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; SL, sialyllactose; DSLNT, disialyllacto-N-tetraose; DSL, disialyllactose; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting. CBMs are found widely in glycoside hydrolases and are discrete, non-catalytic modules that primarily exist to target the parent enzyme to its substrate for efficient hydrolysis by increasing the concentration of the enzyme at the substrate surface (13Boraston A.B. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). The modules can be single, tandem, or in multiples within the glycosyl hydrolase architecture. Studies have shown that they can bind to their specific glycans independently when isolated from the parent molecule and can behave in a cooperative manner when isolated in tandem (14Boraston A.B. McLean B.W. Chen G. Li A. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Crennell S. Garman E. Laver G. Vimr E. Taylor G. Structure. 1994; 2: 535-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Currently, CBMs are grouped into 52 families based upon primary sequence similarity. Subtle differences in the structures of CBMs can lead to diverse ligand specificity, which make CBMs an attractive system for elucidating protein-carbohydrate mechanisms. The sialidase from Vibrio cholerae possesses two CBMs that flank the central catalytic domain (15Crennell S. Garman E. Laver G. Vimr E. Taylor G. Structure. 1994; 2: 535-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1a). One CBM, whose ligand is unknown, is inserted into the catalytic β-pro-peller domain. We previously reported from a structural study on the complete V. cholerae sialidase that the N-terminal CBM (classified as a family 40 CBM) recognizes sialic acid with a relatively high affinity, Kd ∼ 30 μm, the highest reported affinity for a sialic acid-binding protein that recognizes a single sialic acid moiety (16Moustafa I. Connaris H. Taylor M. Zaitsev V. Wilson J.C. Kiefel M.J. von Itzstein M. Taylor G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40819-40826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The N-terminal CBM from Clostridium perfringens NanJ sialidase has also been characterized structurally as a CBM40-recognizing sialic acid, but in contrast to the V. cholerae CBM40, displays high millimolar affinity toward its glycan (17Boraston A.B. Ficko-Blean E. Healey M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 11352-11360Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Inspired by Nature’s multivalency approach to gaining increased binding affinity through avidity, we have engineered polypeptides containing tandem repeats of the V. cholerae CBM40. Here we report the subcloning of the V. cholerae CBM40 and the determination of its crystal structure in complex with 3′-sialyllactose (SL). Calorimetry was used to monitor the binding of a variety of sialic acid-containing substrates to the single isolated CBM40. Constructs containing two, three, or four CBM40 modules were then made with varying linker lengths between the modules (Fig. 1b). Calorimetry was used to measure the binding of 3′-sialyllactose to the engineered two, three, and four CBM40 polypeptides to show that the affinity was unaffected by the tandem repeat of the CBM40 unit. Also, using surface plasmon resonance, we demonstrate that a large gain in affinity is achieved through an avidity effect, with the four CBM40 polypeptide gaining up to three orders of increased binding compared with the single CBM40. We also show that, by adding a GFP molecule to one of the multidomain CBM40 constructs, the binding to human leukocytes can be assessed for cell surface sialylation, as well as employing it in a glycan microarray screen. These multivalent polymers could be further developed as tools to deliver other proteins to sialic acid-rich cell surfaces. Other CBMs could be repeated in a similar way to create other tools for use in glycobiology. Recombinant DNA Techniques-The DNA fragment encoding the family 40 CBM of V. cholerae sialidase/neuraminidase, residues 25-216, was amplified by PCR from the construct pET30b+ containing the nanH gene (16Moustafa I. Connaris H. Taylor M. Zaitsev V. Wilson J.C. Kiefel M.J. von Itzstein M. Taylor G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40819-40826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) using oligonucleotide primer pair 1F and 1R based on the sequence outline in Table 1. The amplified DNA fragment of 573 bp was digested with NcoI and XhoI and cloned into the pEHISTEV vector (an engineered variant of pET30 with an N-terminal His6 tag that is cleaved by tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease) (18Liu H. Naismith J.H. Protein Expression Purif. 2009; 63: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), digested with the same enzymes and used to transform Escherichia coli DH5a. The construct, p1CBM, was verified by DNA sequencing (University of Dundee Sequencing Service, UK).TABLE 1Oligonucleotide primers used to amplify DNA fragmentsPrimerOligonucleotide sequenceFCGTCCCATGGCACTTTTTGACTATAACGC (NcoI)1RCCGGCTCGAGCTAGTCGCCTTGAATTTCAAAC (XhoI)2F(5)CGTCGGATCCATGGCACTTTTTGAC (BamHI)2R(5)GCACGGATCCGTTCAGGGCGTCGCCTTGAATTT (BamHI)2F(10)GCCTGGATCCGGTATGGCACTTTTTGACTATAAC (BamHI)2R(10)GACCGGATCCACCTCCTGATCCGTTCAGGGCGTCGCC (BamHI)2R(15)GACCGGATCCACCTCCACCTGATCCACCTCCTGATCC (BamHI)3F(5)CTGCAAGCTTTGGGAATGGCACTTTTTGAC (HindIII)3R(5)GCACTTCCAAAGCTTGCAGGTCGCCTTGAATTTC (HindIII)3F(10)GGTGGAAGCTTGATGGCACTTTTTGACTATAAC (HindIII)3R(10)GTCCAAGCTTCCACCTCCTCCCAATGCTTGCAGGTCGCC (HindIII)4F(5)GGTAGGGAATTCGGGAATGGCACTTTTTGACTATAAC (EcoRI)4R(5)GCACTCCCGAATTCCCTCCGTCGCCTTGAATTTC (EcoRI) Open table in a new tab The DNA fragment, encoding the V. cholerae CBM40, was modified at the 5′- and 3′-termini to incorporate different restriction endonuclease sites through the use of different primer pairs. This was performed to allow ligation of individual copies of the DNA fragment to generate 2, 3, and 4 copies in tandem (Fig. 1b). Moreover, the primer pairs allowed the insertion of 5, 10, or 15 codons, to represent the length of amino acids linking the individual modules. All these modifications were achieved by PCR amplification using different primer pairs outlined in Table 1 and p1CBM as template. The resulting fragments were cloned into an appropriately digested pEHISTEV vector until the desired number of modules was achieved. These were labeled p2CBM(5Crocker P.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), p2CBM(10), p2CBM(15), p3CBM(5), and p3CBM(10), representing 2 and 3 repeating sialic acid-binding domains with the number of amino acids in the linker in parenthesis, respectively. For p4CBM(5), HindIII-EcoRI-modified and EcoRI-XhoI-modified DNA fragments were initially cloned into pET17b digested with the appropriate enzymes before assembling the final gene in pEHISTEV. For the construction of a GFP-fused 3CBM fragment (GFP-3CBM), the 3CBM fragment was digested with NcoI-XhoI from p3CBM(5) and inserted into a similarly digested pEHISTEV vector containing the gene encoding the enhanced GFP downstream of the N-terminal histidine tag (18Liu H. Naismith J.H. Protein Expression Purif. 2009; 63: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). All constructs were propagated in E. coli DH5a. Positive clones were verified by DNA sequencing before transforming expression hosts E. coli BL21(DE3) (1CBM, 2CBM(5), 3CBM(5), 3CBM(10), and 4CBM(5)) and E. coli BL21(DE3) Gold (2CBM(10) and 2CBM(15)) for protein production. Protein Production and Purification-All constructs were grown and expressed as described for V. cholerae sialidase/neuraminidase (16Moustafa I. Connaris H. Taylor M. Zaitsev V. Wilson J.C. Kiefel M.J. von Itzstein M. Taylor G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40819-40826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1-liter aliquots of Luria-Bertani broth media containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin were inoculated with single colonies and grown at 37 °C until the optical density of the culture reached 0.4-0.6 at 600 nm. Cells were subjected to heat shock for 20 min in a 42 °C water bath before being cooled down to 25 °C and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and left to shake overnight at the same temperature. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (8000 × g, 4 °C), and pellets were frozen at -20 °C, until required. All polypeptides were purified by nickel affinity chromatography as previously described (16Moustafa I. Connaris H. Taylor M. Zaitsev V. Wilson J.C. Kiefel M.J. von Itzstein M. Taylor G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40819-40826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and partially purified polypeptides, with the exception of the GFP-3CBM, were dialyzed into TEV protease cleavage buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm imidazole) and digested overnight with TEV protease. Each polypeptide was then further dialyzed with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole buffer before a second round of purification on a nickel-charged column to remove undigested His-tagged polypeptides. All polypeptide samples were dialyzed extensively in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl and further purified using size-exclusion chromatography, which was performed in the same buffer on a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S200HR column. Peak fractions containing purified CBM40 polypeptides were pooled and concentrated before use. Crystallization and Structure Determination-Crystals of the single V. cholerae CBM40 were obtained in 0.1 m MOPS, pH 6.5, 1.1 m lithium sulfate, 0.6 m ammonium sulfate as precipitant, using the sitting drop method. Crystals were cryoprotected by transferring crystals first into 10% (v/v) glycerol-precipitant mix before leaving in 20% (v/v) glycerol precipitant. Diffraction data extending to 2.5 Å were collected on beamline BM-14 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The structure was solved using the molecular replacement program PHASER (19McCoy A. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P. Winn M. Storoni L. Read R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14771) Google Scholar), which found three CBM40 monomers in the asymmetric unit. Refinement was carried out using REF-MAC (20Murshudov G. Vagin A. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) with COOT being used for model building (21Emsley P. Cowtan K.

Open table in a new tab Isothermal Titration Calorimetry-ITC experiments were performed on a VP-ITC microcalorimeter from MicroCal Inc. (Northampton, MA) with a cell volume of 1.4 ml. Unless stated otherwise, all ITC titrations were performed at 25 °C in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl. For the characterization of the isolated CBM40 (1CBM), the following ligands were used: 3′-sialyllactose (3′SL), 6′sialyllactose, (6′SL), and disialyllacto-N-tetraose (DSLNT), purchased from Dextra Labs (Reading, UK) and disialyllactose (DSL) from Sigma-Aldrich (Fig. 2). The lyophilized sialoside ligands were resuspended in degassed, filtered buffer that was used for the dialysis of the peptide construct. For all other polypeptide constructs, 3′SL was used as the ligand throughout. Protein concentrations were determined at A280, using calculated molar extinction coefficients for 1CBM (38410 m-1 cm-1), 2CBM constructs (75860 m -1 cm-1), 3CBM constructs (113790 m-1 cm-1), and 4CBM(5) (151720 m-1 cm-1), respectively. The concentrations of CBM40 polypeptides were 0.007-0.084 mm, and the sialosides were 0.45-2.14 mm. Aliquots of sialosides (10 μl, unless stated otherwise) were titrated into each polypeptide solution. The heats of dilution were subtracted from binding isotherm data before data were fitted by means of a nonlinear regression analysis using a one-binding site model from MicroCal Origin software. Surface Plasmon Resonance-Binding kinetics were determined by SPR using a BIACORE 3000 biosensor instrument (GE Biosystems). Prior to use, a streptavidin-coated biosensor chip was docked into the instrument and preconditioned with three consecutive 1-min injections of 1 m NaCl in 50 mm NaOH. Multivalent, biotinylated 3′SL-PAA (Glycotech) was diluted to 1 μg/ml in HBS-P (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.005% surfactant P20) before being injected over three of the four flow cells in the chip. Typical immobilization levels of the ligand for each cell were ∼500 response units. A reference surface was also prepared for subtraction of bulk effects and nonspecific interactions with streptavidin. The running buffer consisted of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 100 μl/min. Interaction analysis for each peptide construct with immobilized 3′SL was performed in running buffer at 15, 25, and 35 °C. Purified peptide constructs were diluted into HBS-P to give a series of concentrations for 1CBM constructs, 0.625 μm, 1.25 μm, 2.5 μm, 5 μm, and 10 μm; 2CBM constructs, 20 nm, 125 nm 250 nm, 500 nm, and 1000 nm; 3CBM constructs, 1 nm, 5 nm, 20 nm, 62.5 nm, and 125 nm; and for 4CBM constructs, 0.18 nm, 0.5 nm, 1.6 nm, 5 nm, and 15 nm. All analytes were injected over the flow cell surface at 30 μl/min. The dissociation of analyte from the surface was achieved in running buffer at the same flow rate for 3-5 min. Surfaces were regenerated with two consecutive 30-s injections of 10 mm glycine-HCl, pH 2.5, at 30 μl/min. The affinity, as described by the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was determined globally by fitting to the kinetic simultaneous ka/kd model, assuming Langmuir (1:1) binding, using BIAevaluation software (BIAcore). The free energy change of the interaction of the different CBM polypeptide constructs with biotinylated 3′SL-PAA was determined by using the equilibrium dissociation constants provided by the ratios of the kinetic rate constants for each temperature. van’t Hoff plots of lnKD versus 1/T yielded values for ΔH°/R from the slope and -ΔS°/R from the y intercept. Flow Cytometry (FACS) of GFP-3CBM Binding to Human Leukocytes-Whole human blood leukocytes were collected from healthy adult volunteer donors and prepared as described from standard protocols (22Biddison W.E. Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 2001; (Chap. 2, Unit 2.4)Google Scholar). Leukocytes were then resuspended in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, 10 mm CaCl2, where one-half of cells was incubated with 0.05 unit/ml of V. cholerae sialidase (Sigma), and the other half with buffer alone, for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with RPMI buffer (10% fetal bovine serum, 250 units·ml-1 of penicillin and 250 μg·ml-1 streptomycin), before being aliquoted into a 96-well plate. Cells were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin buffer and then incubated on ice with dilutions of GFP-3CBM in the same buffer for 30-45 min. Unbound probe was removed by extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin. Cells were then analyzed using a FACS LSR flow cytometer with CellQuest software to determine binding of probe to subset populations of leukocytes (BD Biosciences). A minimum of 1 × 104 cells was counted in all analyses. For the exclusion of non-viable cells during FACS analysis, 7-amino-actinomycin D was added to each sample. Glycan Array-The sugar binding specificity of GFP-3CBM was analyzed by the Consortium for Functional Glycomics using Glycan array v3.1. The GFP-3CBM was assayed on the slide array at 200 μg/ml. The dilution was made in a standard binding buffer (TSM, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20). Protein (70 μl) was incubated on the printed array under a coverslip in a dark humidified chamber for 1 h, before images were read in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Microscanarray XL4000 scanner. Structure of the Isolated CBM40 Module-The gene fragment encoding the sialic acid binding module CBM40 from the V. cholerae sialidase was subcloned into pEHISTEV and expressed in E. coli to generate 1CBM, which was subsequently purified for binding and structural studies. Initially, 1CBM was expressed insolubly albeit at very high levels, but a heat shock of cultures at 42 °C during log phase of growth improved the solubility of this CBM such that up to 50-70 milligram quantities per liter were produced consistently. Crystals of V. cholerae CBM40 were grown in the presence of 3′SL. The asymmetric unit contained three CBM40 monomers, and each had clear electron density for all three sugar moieties of the ligand (Fig. 3a). Only sialic acid makes interactions with the protein, and these are the same as those made by sialic acid alone in complex with the whole V. cholerae sialidase (16Moustafa I. Connaris H. Taylor M. Zaitsev V. Wilson J.C. Kiefel M.J. von Itzstein M. Taylor G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40819-40826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). There are three CBM40 modules in the asymmetric unit of the crystal, with monomers A and B burying an interface of ∼750Å2 (Fig. 3b). Determination of Sialoside and Linkage Specificity of V. cholerae CBM40-Studies were performed with 1CBM to determine its specificity toward different monovalent and divalent sialosides. Using ITC, the binding constant Ka and changes in enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS) were measured directly for each interaction, and stoichiometries (n, number of binding sites) were determined from non-linear least squares fit of the data to the one-site binding model as described above. Data obtained from heat of dilution-corrected binding isotherms demonstrate the preference of 1CBM for α-sialic acids (Fig. 4), exhibiting broad binding specificity to α(2Lehmann F. Tiralongo E.

https://openalex.org/W2067225621,"Osteoporosis is one of the most common diseases and can be treated by either anti-resorption drugs, anabolic drugs, or both. To search for anabolic drug targets for osteoporosis therapy, it is crucial to understand the biology of bone forming cells, osteoblasts, in terms of their proliferation, differentiation, and function. Here we found that protein palmitoylation participates in signaling pathways that control osterix expression and osteoblast differentiation. Mouse calvarial osteoblasts express most of the 24 palmitoyl transferases, with some being up-regulated during differentiation. Inhibition of protein palmitoylation, with a substrate-analog inhibitor, diminished osteoblast differentiation and mineralization, but not proliferation or survival. The decrease in differentiation capacity is associated with a reduction in osterix, but not Runx2 or Atf4. Inhibition of palmitoyl transferases had little effect in p53−/− osteoblasts that show accelerated differentiation due to overexpression of osterix, suggesting that osterix, at least partially, mediated the effect of inhibition of palmitoyl transferases on osteoblast differentiation. BMPs are the major driving force of osteoblast differentiation in the differentiation assays. We found that inhibition of palmitoyl transferases also compromised BMP2-induced osteoblast differentiation through down-regulating osterix induction. However, palmitoyl transferases inhibitor did not inhibit Smad1/5/8 activation. Instead, it compromised the activation of p38 MAPK, which are known positive regulators of osterix expression and differentiation. These results indicate that protein palmitoylation plays an important role in BMP-induced MAPK activation, osterix expression, and osteoblast differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2095337884,"The cardiovascular system of bilaterians developed from a common ancestor. However, no endothelial cells exist in invertebrates demonstrating that primitive cardiovascular tubes do not require this vertebrate-specific cell type in order to form. This raises the question of how cardiovascular tubes form in invertebrates? Here we discovered that in the invertebrate cephalochordate amphioxus, the basement membranes of endoderm and mesoderm line the lumen of the major vessels, namely aorta and heart. During amphioxus development a laminin-containing extracellular matrix (ECM) was found to fill the space between the basal cell surfaces of endoderm and mesoderm along their anterior-posterior (A-P) axes. Blood cells appear in this ECM-filled tubular space, coincident with the development of a vascular lumen. To get insight into the underlying cellular mechanism, we induced vessels in vitro with a cell polarity similar to the vessels of amphioxus. We show that basal cell surfaces can form a vascular lumen filled with ECM, and that phagocytotic blood cells can clear this luminal ECM to generate a patent vascular lumen. Therefore, our experiments suggest a mechanism of blood vessel formation via basal cell surfaces in amphioxus and possibly in other invertebrates that do not have any endothelial cells. In addition, a comparison between amphioxus and mouse shows that endothelial cells physically separate the basement membranes from the vascular lumen, suggesting that endothelial cells create cardiovascular tubes with a cell polarity of epithelial tubes in vertebrates and mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1994121680,"1-nitropyrene, the most abundant nitro polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon in diesel emissions, has been found to react with DNA to form predominantly N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-1-aminopyrene (dGAP). This bulky adduct has been shown to induce genetic mutations, which may implicate Y-family DNA polymerases in its bypass in vivo. To establish a kinetic mechanism for the bypass of such a prototype single-base lesion, we employed pre-steady-state kinetic methods to investigate individual nucleotide incorporations upstream, opposite, and downstream from a site-specifically placed dGAP lesion catalyzed by Sulfolobus solfataricus DNA polymerase IV (Dpo4), a model Y-family DNA polymerase. Dpo4 was able to bypass dGAP but paused strongly at two sites: opposite the lesion and immediately downstream from the lesion. Both nucleotide incorporation efficiency and fidelity decreased significantly at the pause sites, especially during extension of the bypass product. Interestingly, a 4-fold tighter binding affinity of damaged DNA to Dpo4 promoted catalysis through putative interactions between the active site residues of Dpo4 and 1-aminopyrene moiety at the first pause site. In the presence of a DNA trap, the kinetics of nucleotide incorporation at these sites was biphasic in which a small, fast phase preceded a larger, slow phase. In contrast, only a large, fast phase was observed during nucleotide incorporation at non-pause sites. Our kinetic studies support a general kinetic mechanism for lesion bypass catalyzed by numerous DNA polymerases."
https://openalex.org/W2066890678,"Changes in reflex spinal pathways after stroke have been shown to affect motor activity in agonist and antagonist muscles acting at the same joint. However, only a few studies have evaluated the heteronymous reflex pathways modulating motoneuronal activity at different joints. This study investigates whether there are changes in the spinal facilitatory and inhibitory pathways linking knee to ankle extensors and if such changes may be related to motor deficits after stroke. The early facilitation and later inhibition of soleus H reflex evoked by the stimulation of femoral nerve at 2 times the motor threshold of the quadriceps were assessed in 15 healthy participants and on the paretic and the non-paretic sides of 15 stroke participants. The relationships between this reflex modulation and the levels of motor recovery, coordination and spasticity were then studied. Results show a significant (Mann-Whitney U; P<0.05) increase in both the peak amplitude (mean+/-SEM: 80+/-22% enhancement of the control H reflex) and duration (4.2+/-0.5 ms) of the facilitation on the paretic side of the stroke individuals compared to their non-paretic side (36+/-6% and 2.9+/-0.4 ms) and to the values of the control subjects (33+/-4% and 2.8+/-0.4 ms, respectively). Moreover, the later strong inhibition observed in all control subjects was decreased in the stroke subjects. Both the peak amplitude and the duration of the increased facilitation were inversely correlated (Spearman r = -0.65; P = 0.009 and r = -0.67; P = 0.007, respectively) with the level of coordination (LEMOCOT) of the paretic leg. Duration of this facilitation was also correlated (r = -0.58, P = 0.024) with the level of motor recovery (CMSA). These results confirm changes in transmission in heteronymous spinal pathways that are related to motor deficits after stroke."

The virus is a significant equine pathogen, but current EHV-1 vaccines are only partially protective and effective metaphylactic and therapeutic agents are not available. Small interfering RNAs (siRNA's), delivered intranasally, could prove a valuable alternative for infection control. siRNA's against two essential EHV-1 genes, encoding the viral helicase (Ori) and glycoprotein B, were evaluated for their potential to decrease EHV-1 infection in a mouse model. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FNDINGS: siRNA therapy in vitro significantly reduced virus production and plaque size. Viral titers were reduced 80-fold with 37.5 pmol of a single siRNA or with as little as 6.25 pmol of each siRNA when used in combination. siRNA therapy in vivo significantly reduced viral replication and clinical signs. Intranasal treatment did not require a transport vehicle and proved effective when given up to 12 h before or after infection.siRNA treatment has potential for both prevention and early treatment of EHV-1 infections."
https://openalex.org/W1982182462,"Spliced leader (SL) trans-splicing has recently been shown to be a common mRNA processing mechanism in dinoflagellates, in which a short (22-nt) sequence, DCCGUAGCCAUUUUGGCUCAAG (D = U, A, or G), is transplanted from the 5'-end of a small non-coding RNA (SL RNA) to the 5' end of mRNA molecules. The widespread existence of the mechanism in dinoflagellates has been demonstrated by detection of this SL (DinoSL) in a wide phylogenetic range of dinoflagellates. Furthermore, the presence of DinoSL in the transcripts of highly diverse groups of nuclear-encoded genes has led us to postulate that SL trans-splicing is universal in dinoflagellate nuclear genome. However, some observations inconsistent to this postulation have been reported, exemplified by a recent article reporting apparent absence of DinoSL in the transcripts of some nuclear-encoded genes in Amphidinium carterae. Absence of SL in these gene transcripts would have important implication on gene regulation in dinoflagellates and utility of DinoSL as a universal dinoflagellate-specific primer to study dinoflagellate transcriptomics. In this study, we re-examined transcripts of these genes and found that all of them actually contained DinoSL. Therefore, results to date are consistent to our initial postulation that DinoSL occurs in all dinoflagellate nuclear-encoded mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2014425133,"Different complex systems behave in a similar way near their critical points of phase transitions which leads to an emergence of a universal scaling behaviour. Universality indirectly implies a long-range correlation between constituent subsystems. As the distributed correlated processing is a hallmark of higher complex cognition, I investigated a measure of universality in human brain during perception and mental imagery of complex real-life visual object like visual art.A new method was presented to estimate the strength of hidden universal structure in a multivariate data set. In this study, I investigated this method in the electrical activities (electroencephalogram signals) of human brain during complex cognition. Two broad groups--artists and non-artists--were studied during the encoding (perception) and retrieval (mental imagery) phases of actual paintings. Universal structure was found to be stronger in visual imagery than in visual perception, and this difference was stronger in artists than in non-artists. Further, this effect was found to be largest in the theta band oscillations and over the prefrontal regions bilaterally.Phase transition like dynamics was observed in the electrical activities of human brain during complex cognitive processing, and closeness to phase transition was higher in mental imagery than in real perception. Further, the effect of long-term training on the universal scaling was also demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W2038716991,"Mice over-expressing the α1−subunit (pore) of the L-type Ca2+ channel (α1CTG) by 4months (mo) of age exhibit an enlarged heart, hypertrophied myocytes, increased Ca2+ current and Ca2+ transient amplitude, but a normal SR Ca2+ load. With advancing age (8–11 mo), some mice demonstrate advanced hypertrophy but are not in congestive heart failure (NFTG), while others evolve to frank dilated congestive heart failure (FTG). We demonstrate that older NFTG myocytes exhibit a hypercontractile state over a wide range of stimulation frequencies, but maintain a normal SR Ca2+ load compared to age matched non-transgenic (NTG) myocytes. However, at high stimulation rates (2–4 Hz) signs of diastolic contractile failure appear in NFTG cells. The evolution of frank congestive failure in FTG is accompanied by a further increase in heart mass and myocyte size, and phospholamban and ryanodine receptor protein levels and phosphorylation become reduced. In FTG, the SR Ca2+ load increases and Ca2+ release following excitation, increases further. An enhanced NCX function in FTG, as reflected by an accelerated relaxation of the caffeine-induced Ca2+ transient, is insufficient to maintain a normal diastolic Ca2+ during high rates of stimulation. Although a high SR Ca2+ release following excitation is maintained, the hypercontractile state is not maintained at high rates of stimulation, and signs of both systolic and diastolic contractile failure appear. Thus, the dilated cardiomyopathy that evolves in this mouse model exhibits signs of both systolic and diastolic failure, but not a deficient SR Ca2+ loading or release, as occurs in some other cardiomyopathic models."
https://openalex.org/W2124587915,"Keratin 7 is expressed in simple epithelia but is expressed at low or undetectable levels in gastrointestinal epithelial cells. In the pancreas, it is present in ductal but not in acinar cells. K7 mRNA is overexpressed in pancreatic cancers. Here we use luciferase reporter assays to analyze the tissue-specific regulatory elements of murine keratin 7 (Krt7) promoter in vitro and in vivo. All elements required for appropriate cell and tissue specificity in reporter assays are present within the Krt7 -234 bp sequence. This fragment appears more selective to pancreatic ductal cells than the Krt19 promoter. GC-rich sequences corresponding to putative Sp1, AP-2 binding sites are essential for in vitro activity. Krt7-LacZ transgenic mice were generated to analyze in vivo activity. Sequences located 1.5 or 0.25 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site drive reporter expression to ductal, but not acinar, cells in transgenic mice. LacZ mRNA was detected in the pancreas as well as in additional epithelial tissues--such as the intestine and the lung--using both promoter constructs. An AdK7Luc adenovirus was generated to assess targeting selectivity in vivo by intravenous injection to immunocompetent mice and in a xenograft model of pancreatic cancer. The -0.25 kb region showed pancreatic selectivity, high activity in pancreatic cancers, and sustained transgene expression in xenografts. In conclusion, the krt7 promoter is useful to target pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2133558591,"CD8 T cells play an important role in controlling viral infections. We investigated the in situ localization of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-specific T cells in lymph and genital tissues from SIV-infected macaques using MHC-class I tetramers. The majority of tetramer-binding cells localized in T cell zones and were CD8+. Curiously, small subpopulations of tetramer-binding cells that had little to no surface CD8 were detected in situ both early and late post-infection, and in both vaginally and rectally inoculated macaques. These tetramer+CD8low/− cells were more often localized in apparent B cell follicles relative to T cell zones and more often found near or within the genital epithelium than the submucosa. Cells analyzed by flow cytometry showed similar populations of cells. Further immunohistological characterization revealed small populations of tetramer+CD20− cells inside B cell follicles and that tetramer+ cells did not stain with γδ-TCR nor CD4 antibodies. Negative control tetramer staining indicated that tetramer+CD8low/− cells were not likely NK cells non-specifically binding to MHC tetramers. These findings have important implications for SIV-specific and other antigen-specific T cell function in these specific tissue locations, and suggest a model in which antigen-specific CD8+ T cells down modulate CD8 upon entering B cell follicles or the epithelial layer of tissues, or alternatively a model in which only antigen-specific CD8 T cells that down-modulate CD8 can enter B cell follicles or the epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W2081412175,"Multiple genetic disorders caused by mutations that affect the proteins lamin A and C show strong skin phenotypes. These disorders include the premature aging disorders Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome and mandibuloacral dysplasia, as well as restrictive dermopathy. Prior studies have shown that the lamin A/C and B proteins are expressed in skin, but little is known about their normal expression in the different skin cell-types and during the hair cycle. Our immunohistochemical staining for lamins A/C and B in wild-type mice revealed strong expression in the basal cell layer of the epidermis, the outer root sheath, and the dermal papilla during all stages of the hair cycle. Lower expression of both lamins A/C and B was seen in suprabasal cells of the epidermis, in the hypodermis, and in the bulb of catagen follicles. In addition, we have utilized a previously described mouse model of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome and show here that the expression of progerin does not result in pronounced effects on hair cycling or the expression of lamin B."
https://openalex.org/W2147702158,"The negative sensory properties of casein hydrolysates (HC) often limit their usage in products intended for human consumption, despite HC being nutritious and having many functional benefits. Recent, but taxonomically limited, evidence suggests that other animals also avoid consuming HC when alternatives exist.We evaluated ingestive responses of five herbivorous species (guinea pig, mountain beaver, gopher, vole, and rabbit) and five omnivorous species (rat, coyote, house mouse, white-footed mouse, and deer mouse; N = 16-18/species) using solid foods containing 20% HC in a series of two-choice preference tests that used a non-protein, cellulose-based alternative. Individuals were also tested with collagen hydrolysate (gelatin; GE) to determine whether it would induce similar ingestive responses to those induced by HC. Despite HC and GE having very different nutritional and sensory qualities, both hydrolysates produced similar preference score patterns. We found that the herbivores generally avoided the hydrolysates while the omnivores consumed them at similar levels to the cellulose diet or, more rarely, preferred them (HC by the white-footed mouse; GE by the rat). Follow-up preference tests pairing HC and the nutritionally equivalent intact casein (C) were performed on the three mouse species and the guinea pigs. For the mice, mean HC preference scores were lower in the HC v C compared to the HC v Cel tests, indicating that HC's sensory qualities negatively affected its consumption. However, responses were species-specific. For the guinea pigs, repeated exposure to HC or C (4.7-h sessions; N = 10) were found to increase subsequent HC preference scores in an HC v C preference test, which was interpreted in the light of conservative foraging strategies thought to typify herbivores.This is the first empirical study of dietary niche-related taxonomic differences in ingestive responses to protein hydrolysates using multiple species under comparable conditions. Our results provide a basis for future work in sensory, physiological, and behavioral mechanisms of hydrolysate avoidance and on the potential use of hydrolysates for pest management."
