https://openalex.org/W4280617578,"Highly transmissible Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 currently dominate globally. Here, we compare neutralization of Omicron BA.1, BA.1.1, and BA.2. BA.2 RBD has slightly higher ACE2 affinity than BA.1 and slightly reduced neutralization by vaccine serum, possibly associated with its increased transmissibility. Neutralization differences between sub-lineages for mAbs (including therapeutics) mostly arise from variation in residues bordering the ACE2 binding site; however, more distant mutations S371F (BA.2) and R346K (BA.1.1) markedly reduce neutralization by therapeutic antibody Vir-S309. In-depth structure-and-function analyses of 27 potent RBD-binding mAbs isolated from vaccinated volunteers following breakthrough Omicron-BA.1 infection reveals that they are focused in two main clusters within the RBD, with potent right-shoulder antibodies showing increased prevalence. Selection and somatic maturation have optimized antibody potency in less-mutated epitopes and recovered potency in highly mutated epitopes. All 27 mAbs potently neutralize early pandemic strains, and many show broad reactivity with variants of concern."
https://openalex.org/W4282037063,"Abstract Chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy has improved the treatment of certain solid tumors, but effective regimens remain elusive for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We conducted a randomized phase 2 trial evaluating the efficacy of nivolumab (nivo; anti-PD-1) and/or sotigalimab (sotiga; CD40 agonistic antibody) with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel (chemotherapy) in patients with first-line metastatic PDAC ( NCT03214250 ). In 105 patients analyzed for efficacy, the primary endpoint of 1-year overall survival (OS) was met for nivo/chemo (57.7%, P = 0.006 compared to historical 1-year OS of 35%, n = 34) but was not met for sotiga/chemo (48.1%, P = 0.062, n = 36) or sotiga/nivo/chemo (41.3%, P = 0.223, n = 35). Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, objective response rate, disease control rate, duration of response and safety. Treatment-related adverse event rates were similar across arms. Multi-omic circulating and tumor biomarker analyses identified distinct immune signatures associated with survival for nivo/chemo and sotiga/chemo. Survival after nivo/chemo correlated with a less suppressive tumor microenvironment and higher numbers of activated, antigen-experienced circulating T cells at baseline. Survival after sotiga/chemo correlated with greater intratumoral CD4 T cell infiltration and circulating differentiated CD4 T cells and antigen-presenting cells. A patient subset benefitting from sotiga/nivo/chemo was not identified. Collectively, these analyses suggest potential treatment-specific correlates of efficacy and may enable biomarker-selected patient populations in subsequent PDAC chemoimmunotherapy trials."
https://openalex.org/W4281663412,"Neural computations are currently investigated using two separate approaches: sorting neurons into functional subpopulations or examining the low-dimensional dynamics of collective activity. Whether and how these two aspects interact to shape computations is currently unclear. Using a novel approach to extract computational mechanisms from networks trained on neuroscience tasks, here we show that the dimensionality of the dynamics and subpopulation structure play fundamentally complementary roles. Although various tasks can be implemented by increasing the dimensionality in networks with fully random population structure, flexible input-output mappings instead require a non-random population structure that can be described in terms of multiple subpopulations. Our analyses revealed that such a subpopulation structure enables flexible computations through a mechanism based on gain-controlled modulations that flexibly shape the collective dynamics. Our results lead to task-specific predictions for the structure of neural selectivity, for inactivation experiments and for the implication of different neurons in multi-tasking."
https://openalex.org/W4282915079,"Disease-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) generally do not implicate target genes, as most disease SNPs are regulatory. Many SNP-to-gene (S2G) linking strategies have been developed to link regulatory SNPs to the genes that they regulate in cis. Here, we developed a heritability-based framework for evaluating and combining different S2G strategies to optimize their informativeness for common disease risk. Our optimal combined S2G strategy (cS2G) included seven constituent S2G strategies and achieved a precision of 0.75 and a recall of 0.33, more than doubling the recall of any individual strategy. We applied cS2G to fine-mapping results for 49 UK Biobank diseases/traits to predict 5,095 causal SNP–gene-disease triplets (with S2G-derived functional interpretation) with high confidence. We further applied cS2G to provide an empirical assessment of disease omnigenicity; we determined that the top 1% of genes explained roughly half of the SNP heritability linked to all genes and that gene-level architectures vary with variant allele frequency. A heritability-based framework for evaluation of SNP-to-gene linking methods is used to construct an optimal, combined approach and applied to 49 traits. Analysis of trait omnigenicity suggests gene-level architecture varies depending on variant frequency."
https://openalex.org/W4281780442,"Hijacking the cellular protein degradation system offers unique opportunities for drug discovery, as exemplified by proteolysis-targeting chimeras. Despite their great promise for medical chemistry, so far, it has not been possible to reprogram the bacterial degradation machinery to interfere with microbial infections. Here, we develop small-molecule degraders, so-called BacPROTACs, that bind to the substrate receptor of the ClpC:ClpP protease, priming neo-substrates for degradation. In addition to their targeting function, BacPROTACs activate ClpC, transforming the resting unfoldase into its functional state. The induced higher-order oligomer was visualized by cryo-EM analysis, providing a structural snapshot of activated ClpC unfolding a protein substrate. Finally, drug susceptibility and degradation assays performed in mycobacteria demonstrate in vivo activity of BacPROTACs, allowing selective targeting of endogenous proteins via fusion to an established degron. In addition to guiding antibiotic discovery, the BacPROTAC technology presents a versatile research tool enabling the inducible degradation of bacterial proteins."

https://openalex.org/W4282944305,"RNA-guided RNA-targeting nucleases, such as CRISPR-Cas13 proteins, have therapeutic potential for gene editing. Among Cas13d enzymes, Cas13d from the bacteria Ruminococcus flavefaciens (RfxCas13d) is of particular interest owing to its small size and high specificity. However, the existence of pre-existing immunity against RfxCas13d is unclear. In this study, we evaluated antibody and T cell responses to RfxCas13d in healthy donors using ELISA and T cell culture assays. We found RfxCas13d-reactive antibodies and CD4 and CD8 T cell responses in most donors, comparable to responses against Cas9 proteins from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9) and Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9). RfxCas13d-responding T cells could produce the inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-17. These findings should be taken into consideration in the development of RfxCas13d for therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4281749813,"Abstract Mitochondrial metabolites regulate leukaemic and normal stem cells by affecting epigenetic marks. How mitochondrial enzymes localize to the nucleus to control stem cell function is less understood. We discovered that the mitochondrial metabolic enzyme hexokinase 2 (HK2) localizes to the nucleus in leukaemic and normal haematopoietic stem cells. Overexpression of nuclear HK2 increases leukaemic stem cell properties and decreases differentiation, whereas selective nuclear HK2 knockdown promotes differentiation and decreases stem cell function. Nuclear HK2 localization is phosphorylation-dependent, requires active import and export, and regulates differentiation independently of its enzymatic activity. HK2 interacts with nuclear proteins regulating chromatin openness, increasing chromatin accessibilities at leukaemic stem cell-positive signature and DNA-repair sites. Nuclear HK2 overexpression decreases double-strand breaks and confers chemoresistance, which may contribute to the mechanism by which leukaemic stem cells resist DNA-damaging agents. Thus, we describe a non-canonical mechanism by which mitochondrial enzymes influence stem cell function independently of their metabolic function."
https://openalex.org/W4282938612,"Mucins are large gel-forming polymers inside the mucus barrier that inhibit the yeast-to-hyphal transition of Candida albicans, a key virulence trait of this important human fungal pathogen. However, the molecular motifs in mucins that inhibit filamentation remain unclear despite their potential for therapeutic interventions. Here, we determined that mucins display an abundance of virulence-attenuating molecules in the form of mucin O-glycans. We isolated and cataloged >100 mucin O-glycans from three major mucosal surfaces and established that they suppress filamentation and related phenotypes relevant to infection, including surface adhesion, biofilm formation and cross-kingdom competition between C. albicans and the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Using synthetic O-glycans, we identified three structures (core 1, core 1 + fucose and core 2 + galactose) that are sufficient to inhibit filamentation with potency comparable to the complex O-glycan pool. Overall, this work identifies mucin O-glycans as host molecules with untapped therapeutic potential to manage fungal pathogens."

https://openalex.org/W4281699857,"Abstract Mirror-image aptamers made from chirally inverted nucleic acids are nuclease-resistant and exceptionally biostable, opening up opportunities for unique applications. However, the directed evolution and selection of mirror-image aptamers directly from large randomized l -DNA libraries has,﻿ to our knowledge, not been demonstrated previously. Here, we developed a ‘mirror-image selection’ scheme for the directed evolution and selection of biostable l -DNA aptamers with a mirror-image DNA polymerase. We performed iterative rounds of enrichment and mirror-image polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of l -DNA sequences that bind native human thrombin, in conjunction with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to isolate individual aptamers and l -DNA sequencing-by-synthesis to determine their sequences. Based on the selected l -DNA aptamers, we designed biostable thrombin sensors and inhibitors, which remained functional in physiologically relevant nuclease-rich environments, even in the presence of human serum that rapidly degraded d -DNA aptamers. Mirror-image selection of biostable l -DNA aptamers directly from large randomized l -DNA libraries greatly expands the range of biomolecules that can be targeted, broadening their applications as biostable sensors, therapeutics and basic research tools."
https://openalex.org/W4282938106,"Genome-wide association studies in combination with single-cell genomic atlases can provide insights into the mechanisms of disease-causal genetic variation. However, identification of disease-relevant or trait-relevant cell types, states and trajectories is often hampered by sparsity and noise, particularly in the analysis of single-cell epigenomic data. To overcome these challenges, we present SCAVENGE, a computational algorithm that uses network propagation to map causal variants to their relevant cellular context at single-cell resolution. We demonstrate how SCAVENGE can help identify key biological mechanisms underlying human genetic variation, applying the method to blood traits at distinct stages of human hematopoiesis, to monocyte subsets that increase the risk for severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to intermediate lymphocyte developmental states that predispose to acute leukemia. Our approach not only provides a framework for enabling variant-to-function insights at single-cell resolution but also suggests a more general strategy for maximizing the inferences that can be made using single-cell genomic data."
https://openalex.org/W4281995370,"The mitochondrial genome encodes 13 components of the oxidative phosphorylation system, and altered mitochondrial transcription drives various human pathologies. A polyadenylated, non-coding RNA molecule known as 7S RNA is transcribed from a region immediately downstream of the light strand promoter in mammalian cells, and its levels change rapidly in response to physiological conditions. Here, we report that 7S RNA has a regulatory function, as it controls levels of mitochondrial transcription both in vitro and in cultured human cells. Using cryo-EM, we show that POLRMT dimerization is induced by interactions with 7S RNA. The resulting POLRMT dimer interface sequesters domains necessary for promoter recognition and unwinding, thereby preventing transcription initiation. We propose that the non-coding 7S RNA molecule is a component of a negative feedback loop that regulates mitochondrial transcription in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W4281868010,"Recent studies indicate that vitamin D supplementation may decrease respiratory tract infections, but the association between vitamin D and COVID-19 is still unclear.To explore the association between vitamin D status and infections, hospitalisation, and mortality due to COVID-19.We used UK Biobank, a nationwide cohort of 500,000 individuals aged between 40 and 69 years at recruitment between 2006 and 2010. We included people with at least one serum vitamin D test, living in England with linked primary care and inpatient records. The primary exposure was serum vitamin D status measured at recruitment, defined as deficiency at <25 nmol/L, insufficiency at 25-49 nmol/L and sufficiency at ≥ 50 nmol/L. Secondary exposures were self-reported or prescribed vitamin D supplements. The primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed or clinically diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infections. The secondary outcomes included hospitalisation and mortality due to COVID-19. We used multivariable Cox regression models stratified by summertime months and non-summertime months, adjusting for demographic factors and underlying comorbidities.We included 307,512 participants (54.9% female, 55.9% over 70 years old) in our analysis. During summertime months, weak evidence existed that the vitamin D deficiency group had a lower hazard of being diagnosed with COVID-19 (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.77-0.95). During non-summertime, the vitamin D deficiency group had a higher hazard of COVID-19 compared with the vitamin D sufficient group (HR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.01-1.30). No evidence was found that vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency was associated with either hospitalisation or mortality due to COVID-19 in any time strata.We found no evidence of an association between historical vitamin D status and hospitalisation or mortality due to COVID-19, along with inconsistent results for any association between vitamin D and diagnosis of COVID-19. However, studies using more recent vitamin D measurements and systematic COVID-19 testing are needed."

https://openalex.org/W4281907881,"This study aimed to examine the unique factors of loneliness and social isolation within the ex-military population from discharge, through transition, to the present day.A qualitative, Phenomenological approach was adopted.In-depth semi-structured interviews were carried out with 11 participants who had all served in the British Armed Forces and represented all three military services (Royal Navy; Army; Royal Air Force). Reflexive Thematic Analysis was used to analyse the data.Three themes were generated-a sense of loss; difficulty in connecting in civilian life; and seeking out familiarity. The findings of this study were examined through the lenses of the Social Needs Approach and the Cognitive Discrepancy Model.Individuals developed close bonds in the military through meaningful and prolonged contact, reducing feelings of loneliness and social isolation during their time in service. The sense of belonging was key to social connection, but transition out of the military severed existing relationships, and a lack of belonging hindered the development of relationships within the civilian community. This study has implications for service provision relating to ex-military personnel and future service leavers."
https://openalex.org/W4285685583,"We aimed to determine the risk of perinatal complications during delivery in mothers with non-normal glucose tolerance in a large Japanese birth cohort. We analysed data of 24,295 neonate-mother pairs in the Japan Environment and Children's Study cohort between 2011 and 2014. We included 67 mothers with type 1 diabetes, 102 with type 2 diabetes (determined by questionnaire), 2,045 with gestational diabetes (determined by diagnosis), and 2,949 with plasma glucose levels ≥140 mg/dL (shown by a screening test for gestational diabetes). Gestational age, birth weight, placental weight, and proportions of preterm birth, and labour and neonatal complications at delivery in mothers with diabetes were compared with those in mothers with normal glucose tolerance. Mean gestational age was shorter in mothers with any type of diabetes than in mothers without diabetes. Birth weight tended to be heavier in mothers with type 1 diabetes, and placental weight was significantly heavier in mothers with type 1 and gestational diabetes and elevated plasma glucose levels (all p<0.05). The relative risks of any labour complication and any neonatal complication were 1.49 and 2.28 in type 2 diabetes, 1.59 and 1.95 in gestational diabetes, and 1.22 and 1.30 in a positive screening test result (all p<0.05). The relative risks of preterm birth, gestational hypertension, and neonatal jaundice were significantly higher in mothers with types 1 (2.77; 4.07; 2.04) and 2 diabetes (2.65; 5.84; 1.99) and a positive screening test result (1.29; 1.63; 1.12) than in those without diabetes (all p<0.05). In conclusion, placental weight is heavier in mothers with non-normal glucose tolerance. Preterm birth, gestational hypertension, and jaundice are more frequent in mothers with types 1 and 2 diabetes. A positive result in a screening test for gestational diabetes suggests not only a non-normal glucose tolerance, but also a medium (middle-level) risk of perinatal complications."
https://openalex.org/W4281766396,"Introduction Despite numerous studies on airway management in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients, the choice of prehospital airway management technique remains controversial. Our study aimed to investigate the association between prehospital advanced airway management and survival outcomes according to a transport time interval (TTI) using nationwide OHCA registry database in Korea. Methods The inclusion criteria were patients with OHCA aged over 18 years old with a presumed cardiac etiology between January 2015 and December 2018. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge. The main exposure was the prehospital airway management technique performed by the emergency medical technicians (EMTs), classified as bag-valve mask (BVM), supraglottic airway (SGA), or endotracheal intubation (ETI).We performed multivariable logistic regression analysis and interaction analysis between the type of airway management and TTI for adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results Of a total of 70,530 eligible OHCA patients, 26,547 (37.6%), 38,391 (54.4%), and 5,592 (7.9%) were managed with BVM, SGA, ETI, respectively. Patients in the SGA and ETI groups had a higher odds of survival to discharge than BVM groups (aOR, 1.11 (1.05–1.16) and 1.13 (1.05–1.23)). And the rates of survival to discharge with SGA and ETI were significantly higher in groups with TTI more than 8 minutes (1.17 (1.08–1.27) and 1.38 (1.20–1.59)). Conclusion The survival to discharge was significantly higher among patients who received ETI and SGA than in those who received BVM. The transport time interval influenced the effect of prehospital airway management on the clinical outcomes after OHCA."
https://openalex.org/W4281953278,"Natural silks crafted by spiders comprise some of the most versatile materials known. Artificial silks-based on the sequences of their natural brethren-replicate some desirable biophysical properties and are increasingly utilized in commercial and medical applications today. To characterize the repertoire of protein sequences giving silks their biophysical properties and to determine the set of expressed genes across each unique silk gland contributing to the formation of natural silks, we report here draft genomic and transcriptomic assemblies of Darwin's bark spider, Caerostris darwini, an orb-weaving spider whose dragline is one of the toughest known biomaterials on Earth. We identify at least 31 putative spidroin genes, with expansion of multiple spidroin gene classes relative to the golden orb-weaver, Trichonephila clavipes. We observed substantial sharing of spidroin repetitive sequence motifs between species as well as new motifs unique to C. darwini. Comparative gene expression analyses across six silk gland isolates in females plus a composite isolate of all silk glands in males demonstrated gland and sex-specific expression of spidroins, facilitating putative assignment of novel spidroin genes to classes. Broad expression of spidroins across silk gland types suggests that silks emanating from a given gland represent composite materials to a greater extent than previously appreciated. We hypothesize that the extraordinary toughness of C. darwini major ampullate dragline silk may relate to the unique protein composition of major ampullate spidroins, combined with the relatively high expression of stretchy flagelliform spidroins whose union into a single fiber may be aided by novel motifs and cassettes that act as molecule-binding helices. Our assemblies extend the catalog of sequences and sets of expressed genes that confer the unique biophysical properties observed in natural silks."
https://openalex.org/W4281671888,"Background Strokes are common in people with atrial fibrillation (AF), and can have devastating consequences, especially in the elderly and if AF is untreated. However, community-based studies on screening for untreated AF have not been conducted in Japan, and there has been no evaluation of the effectiveness of early screening for AF in the elderly (≥65 years). Methods The Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine (KPUM) Education Initiative has conducted an AF awareness campaign consisted of screening tests using a blood pressure (BP) monitor with electrocardiogram (ECG) (the Complete, Omron Healthcare Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) and educational lectures for the elderly (≥65 years) from 2019 to 2020. A modeled effectiveness analysis was performed comparing the life-years and QALYs (quality-adjusted life-years) between direct-acting oral anticoagulation (DOAC)-treated AF and untreated AF in a Japanese setting. The basic description of the Markov model was used for the analysis. Results A total of 1648 participants were screened, and after excluding those with missing information or data (n = 41), 1607 were finally enrolled. The mean (± standard deviation) age of participants was 72.4±5.8 years, 827 (51.5%) were female, 628 (39.1%) had hypertension, and 1368 (85.1%) had CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥2. After cardiologists’ evaluation of all ECG recordings of the Complete, 15 (0.93%) AF were newly detected. For each AF treated with DOAC, 0.859 QALYs gained over the lifetime for 65 years-old men, and 0.856 QALYs for 65 years-old women compared to non-treatment. Conclusion A moderate number of untreated AF were identified in the community-based study. Identification of an increased number of patients with AF, if properly treated with DOAC, ultimately leads to a reduction in the number of strokes occurred over subjects’ lifetime."

The prevalence of BHD syndrome was 5.67 per 107 population, with no peak age. Among incidence cases, the median age of diagnosis was 51 years, with slightly more females than males (n = 15, 57.7%). Over half of the patients (n = 14, 53.8%) experienced pneumothorax, and 10 (38.5%) developed malignant neoplasm within the clinical course.The prevalence of BHD syndrome in Korea is extremely low. However, affected patients manifest several comorbidities, including malignant neoplasm and repetitive pneumothorax."
https://openalex.org/W4282003018,"As information about COVID-19 safety behavior changed, people had to judge how likely others were to protect themselves through mask-wearing and vaccination seeking. In a large, campus-wide survey, we assessed whether University of Kansas students viewed others' protective behaviors as different from their own, how much students assumed others shared their beliefs and behaviors, and which individual differences were associated with those estimations. Participants in our survey (N = 1, 704; 81.04% white, 64.08% female) estimated how likely they and others were to have worn masks on the University of Kansas campus, have worn masks off-campus, and to seek a vaccine. They also completed measures of political preference, numeracy, and preferences for risk in various contexts. We found that participants estimated that others were less likely to engage in health safety behaviors than themselves, but that their estimations of others were widely shared. While, in general, participants saw themselves as more unique in terms of practicing COVID-19 preventative behaviors, more liberal participants saw themselves as more unique, while those that were more conservative saw their own behavior as more similar to others. At least for masking, this uniqueness was false-estimates of others' health behavior were lower than their actual rates. Understanding this relationship could allow for more accurate norm-setting and normalization of mask-wearing and vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W4281686845,"The heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone central to client protein folding and maturation in eukaryotic cells. During its chaperone cycle, Hsp90 undergoes ATPase-coupled large-scale conformational changes between open and closed states, where the N-terminal and middle domains of the protein form a compact dimerized conformation. However, the molecular principles of the switching motion between the open and closed states remain poorly understood. Here we show by integrating atomistic and coarse-grained molecular simulations with small-angle X-ray scattering experiments and NMR spectroscopy data that Hsp90 exhibits rich conformational dynamics modulated by the charged linker, which connects the N-terminal with the middle domain of the protein. We show that the dissociation of these domains is crucial for the conformational flexibility of the open state, with the separation distance controlled by a β-sheet motif next to the linker region. Taken together, our results suggest that the conformational ensemble of Hsp90 comprises highly extended states, which could be functionally crucial for client processing."

On February 28, the WHO raised the COVID-19 threat assessment to its highest level. The COVID-19 outbreak became a significant challenge for world health. Around 30 million people got infected with COVID-19 since the beginning of this year. More than 900.000 decease. Thus, examining the incidence of COVID-19 and various aspects of its clinical course in a group of adult professional soccer players would be of great practical interest. The incidence, clinical practice, and severity of COVID-19 infection, as well as the duration of treatment and return to play was studied based on a survey of team physicians and medical records assessment in the group of adult professional soccer players representing the clubs of the Russian Premier-League (RPL) during the period of championship resumption from 01.04.2020 until 20.09.2020. COVID-19 infection was detected in 103 soccer players during COVID-19 screening. This number comprises 14.5% of all soccer players on the rosters of RPL soccer teams and is subjected to regular COVID-19 testing. The asymptomatic course was observed in 43.7% of cases (n = 45). These players were isolated, and their clinical condition was monitored closely. In 56.3% of patients (n = 58), fatigue, headache, fever, and anosmia were the most common symptoms. COVID-19 infection was commonly diagnosed among adult professional soccer players in Russia. However, most cases had a mild course and did not impair return to regular exercise.

During robotic lower abdominal surgery, the patient's abdominal cavity is filled with CO2, and the patient's head is steeply positioned toward the floor (Trendelenburg position). Pneumoperitoneum and the Trendelenburg position together with physiological alterations during anesthesia, interfere with predicting BP changes. Recently, deep learning using recurrent neural networks (RNN) was shown to be effective in predicting intraoperative BP. A model for predicting BP rise was designed using RNN under special scenarios during robotic laparoscopic surgery and its accuracy was tested.Databases that included adult patients (over 19 years old) undergoing low abdominal da Vinci robotic surgery (ovarian cystectomy, hysterectomy, myomectomy, prostatectomy, and salpingo-oophorectomy) at Soonchunhyang University Bucheon Hospital from October 2018 to March 2021 were used. An RNN-based model was designed using Python3 language with the PyTorch packages. The model was trained to predict whether hypertension (20% increase in the mean BP from baseline) would develop within 10 minutes after pneumoperitoneum.Eight distinct datasets were generated and the predictive power was compared. The macro-average F1 scores of the datasets ranged from 68.18% to 72.33%. It took only 3.472 milliseconds to obtain 39 prediction outputs.A prediction model using the RNN may predict BP rises during robotic laparoscopic surgery."

https://openalex.org/W4285413712,"Since December 2019, COVID-19 began to spread throughout the world for nearly two years. During the epidemic, the travel intensity of most urban residents has dropped significantly, and they can only complete inflexible travel such as ""home to designated hospital"" and ""home to supermarket"" and some special commuting trips. While ensuring basic travel of residents under major public health emergency, there is also a problem of high risk of infection caused by exposure of the population to the public transport network. For the discipline of urban transport, how to use planning methods to promote public health and reduce the potential spread of diseases has become a common problem faced by the government, academia and industry.Based on the mobility perspective of travel agents, the spatial analysis methods such as topological model of bus network structure, centrality model of public transport network and nuclear density analysis are used to obtain the exposure risk and spatial distribution characteristics of public transport from two aspects of bus stops and epidemic sites.The overall spatial exposure risk of Wuhan city presents an obvious ""multi center circle"" structure at the level of bus stops. The high and relatively high risk stops are mainly transport hubs, shopping malls and other sites, accounting for 35.63%. The medium and low-risk stops are mainly the villages and communities outside the core areas of each administrative region, accounting for 64.37%. On the other hand, at the scale of epidemic sites, the coverage covers 4018 bus stops in Wuhan, accounting for 36.5% of all bus stops, and 169 bus lines, accounting for 39.9% of all routes. High risk epidemic sites are mainly concentrated in the core areas within the jurisdiction of Wuhan City, and in the direction of urban outer circle diffusion, they are mainly distributed in the low and medium risk epidemic sites. According to the difference of the risk level of public transport exposure, the hierarchical public transport control measures are formulated.This paper proposes differentiated prevention and control countermeasures according to the difference of risk levels, and provides theoretical basis and decision-making reference for urban traffic management departments in emergency management and formulation of prevention and control countermeasures."

The research results show that the opening of high-speed rail can effectively alleviate the financing constraints faced by enterprises. Through the analysis of its influence mechanism, it is found that the opening of high-speed rail can reduce the degree of information asymmetry and agency conflicts between enterprises and their stakeholders, and thereby ease corporate financing constraints. At the same time, the opening of the high-speed rail has a more significant effect on alleviating the financing constraints of non-state-controlled enterprises, technology-intensive enterprises, and enterprises in inland areas. This research is not only a supplement to the economic consequences related to the opening of the high-speed rail, but also a further expansion of the research on the factors affecting corporate financing constraints."

The study examines and explores opinion on the optimal contents and format for an occupational therapy intervention to improve poor sleep in this population. Views of clinical and academic topic experts (n = 56), were elicited, examined and explored in three rounds, views from previous rounds being presented back to participants in subsequent rounds. Participants with relevant personal experience (n = 26) then rated and commented on suggestions, with a focus on acceptability. Descriptive statistics and graphs of ratings were triangulated with qualitative content analysis of free-text. Results Participants emphasised the central importance of intervention personalisation, although the manner and extent of personalisation suggested varied. Many components and domains were acknowledged as important, with the challenge being how to keep such an intervention simple, brief, and feasible for end-users, for sustainable implementation. The strongest consensus was to address evening routine, daytime activity, and environmental interventions. Relaxation, mindfulness, thermoregulation, sensory factors, and cognitive or psychological approaches were rated as less important. There was disagreement on whether to include time in bed restriction, and how to address napping, as well as how far to address medication timing. Clinicians and researchers advocated some version of stimulus control, but participants with personal experience reported low levels of acceptability for this, describing entirely negative experiences using ‘the 15-minute rule’ (part of stimulus control). Conclusion These results are informative for clinicians treating sleep problems in people with schizophrenia and related conditions, as well as for decision makers considering the potential contribution of the profession of occupational therapy toward sleep treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4281667368,"Introduction Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are still a major public health problem in Indonesia. Studies have shown that risk factors of NCDs are associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity and mortality. However, it is unclear whether NCD risk factors are also risks for new COVID-19 cases. This study aimed to obtain an NCD risk profile among university employees and its associations with contracting COVID-19. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in October 2021. Participants were administrative employees of Universitas Indonesia (UI), Depok City, West Java. Assessment of NCD risk factors was based on the World Health Organization STEPwise approach to NCD risk factor surveillance (WHO STEPS). Demographic, working, and medical-history data were obtained electronically by using a Google Form. Physical and laboratory examinations were done in the Integrated Post for NCDs. Risks were expressed as adjusted odds ratio (OR adj ) and 95% confidence interval (CI) in multivariate analyses. Results A total of 613 employees were enrolled. Men were predominant (54.8%), and about 36% of them work in shift as security personnel. About 66.7% were overweight or obese and 77.8% had hypertension. There were 138 (22.8%) employees who had COVID-19. Nearly all (95.6%) had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. At-risk waist circumference (OR adj 1.72, 95% CI 1.15–2.56, p = 0.008) and total cholesterol level of 200–239 mg/dL (OR adj 2.30, 95% CI 1.19–4.44, p = 0.013) were independent risk factors, but shift work (OR adj 0.52, 95% CI 0.34–0.80, p = 0.003) was protective against COVID-19. Conclusion The prevalence of NCD risk factors among university administrative employees was high, increasing the risk of contracting COVID-19. A behavioral intervention program to manage NCD risk factors at the university level is urgently needed according to the Health Promoting University framework."
https://openalex.org/W4281672572,"Oxidative DNA damage contributes to aging and the pathogenesis of numerous human diseases including cancer. 8-hydroxyguanine (8-oxoG) is the major product of oxidative DNA lesions. Although OGG1-mediated base excision repair is the primary mechanism for 8-oxoG removal, DNA mismatch repair has also been implicated in processing oxidative DNA damage. However, the mechanism of the latter is not fully understood. Here, we treated human cells defective in various 8-oxoG repair factors with H2O2 and performed biochemical, live cell imaging, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analyses to determine their response to the treatment. We show that the mismatch repair processing of oxidative DNA damage involves cohesive interactions between mismatch recognition protein MutSα, histone mark H3K36me3, and H3K36 trimethyltransferase SETD2, which activates the ATM DNA damage signaling pathway. We found that cells depleted of MutSα or SETD2 accumulate 8-oxoG adducts and fail to trigger H2O2-induced ATM activation. Furthermore, we show that SETD2 physically interacts with both MutSα and ATM, which suggests a role for SETD2 in transducing DNA damage signals from lesion-bound MutSα to ATM. Consistently, MutSα and SETD2 are highly coenriched at oxidative damage sites. The data presented here support a model wherein MutSα, SETD2, ATM, and H3K36me3 constitute a positive feedback loop to help cells cope with oxidative DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W4281679431,"The integration of family planning (FP) with childhood immunisations is considered a promising approach to addressing postpartum women's unmet need for FP in resource limited settings. This study set out to examine client and health provider perceptions of the quality of FP services that were integrated with childhood immunisations in Kenya and Uganda. Semi-structured interviews with clients (n = 30) and health providers (n = 27) were conducted in 16 rural health facilities. Interviews centred on the respondents' experiences receiving/delivering FP services, their interactions with providers/clients, and their views on the quality of FP services. Client and provider perceptions of quality were compared through a thematic analysis of interview transcripts, and findings were synthesised using Jain and Hardee's revised FP Quality of Care Framework. Using audit data, health facility characteristics and resources were also summarised through descriptive statistics to contextualise the qualitative findings. The dignity and respect experienced by clients was central to the respondents' perceptions of quality. These two dimensions were not conceptualised as distinct facets of quality, but were instead perceived to be a product of the 1) access to needed services, 2) choice of contraceptives, 3) interpersonal communication, 4) information, and 5) confidentiality afforded to clients. Additionally, clients and providers alike believed that the integration of FP services with childhood immunisations had a positive effect on clients' access to needed services and on the confidentiality they experienced in a context where modern contraceptive use was stigmatised and where a lack of support from some husbands impeded access to FP services. Understanding clients' and providers' conceptualisation of quality is critical to the design of high quality and client-centred integrated FP services."
https://openalex.org/W4281704052,"Since the discovery of klotho as an anti-aging gene, its association with tumors has been studied. Several previous studies have reported the down-expression of klotho in various human cancers, and much of its mechanism has been revealed. Nonetheless, the significance of klotho in canine mammary gland tumors is not yet known. This study aimed to determine whether klotho is expressed within normal canine mammary glands and whether the expression changes in benign and malignant tumors. Using immunohistochemistry, the experiment was conducted on eight normal canine mammary gland tissues and 55 mammary gland tumor samples. Additionally, the correlation between the Ki-67 proliferation index and clinicopathological features, such as age, tumor size, tumor grade, histologic type, and metastasis, was evaluated. All eight normal mammary gland tissues showed immunohistochemistry expression of klotho, and the expression significantly decreased as malignancy increased. Among the samples, 11% (3/28) of benign tumors and 26% (7/27) of malignant tumors showed negative klotho expression. Furthermore, higher Ki-67 expression, higher grades, and metastasis were confirmed to be associated with the negative klotho expression. Analysis of the survival curve for dogs with malignant tumors revealed that negative klotho expression was significantly associated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival. These results indicate that klotho is expressed in normal canine mammary glands and that negative klotho expression in canine mammary gland tumors is positively correlated with poor prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W4281707513,"Leishmaniasis is a public health issue. It is among the top five parasitic illnesses worldwide and is one of the most neglected diseases. The current treatment disease includes limitations of toxicity, variable efficacy, high costs and inconvenient doses and treatment schedules. LASSBio-1736 was described as antileishmanial drug-candidate to cutaneous leishmaniasis, displaying plasma stability and with no preliminary signals of hepatic or renal toxicity. In this paper, we described the in vitro pharmacokinetic study of LASSBio-1491 (a less lipophilic isostere of LASSBio-1736) and it is in vitro and in vivo leishmanicidal activities. Our results demonstrated that LASSBio-1491 has high permeability, satisfactory aqueous solubility, long plasma and microsomal half-lives and low in vitro systemic clearance, suggesting a pharmacokinetic profile suitable for its use in a single daily dose. The antileishmanial effect of LASSBio-1491 was confirmed in vitro and in vivo . It exhibited no cytotoxic effect to mammalian cells and displayed good in –vivo effect against BALB/c mice infected with Leishmania major LV39 substrain, being 3 times more efficient than glucantime."
https://openalex.org/W4281715466,"Rhesus monkeys have evolved MHC-encoded class I allomorphs such as Mamu-B∗098 that are capable of binding N-myristoylated short lipopeptides rather than conventional long peptides; however, it remains unknown whether such antigen-binding molecules exist in other species, including humans. We herein demonstrate that human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A∗24:02 and HLA-C∗14:02 proteins, which are known to bind conventional long peptides, also have the potential to bind N-myristoylated short lipopeptides. These HLA class I molecules shared a serine at position 9 (Ser9) with Mamu-B∗098, in contrast to most MHC class I molecules that harbor a larger amino acid residue, such as tyrosine, at this position. High resolution X-ray crystallographic analyses of lipopeptide-bound HLA-A∗24:02 and HLA-C∗14:02 complexes indicated that Ser9 was at the bottom of the B pocket with its small hydroxymethyl side chain directed away from the B-pocket cavity, thereby contributing to the formation of a deep hydrophobic cavity suitable for accommodating the long-chain fatty acid moiety of lipopeptide ligands. Upon peptide binding, however, we found the hydrogen-bond network involving Ser9 was reorganized, and the remodeled B pocket was able to capture the second amino acid residue (P2) of peptide ligands. Apart from the B pocket, virtually no marked alterations were observed for the A and F pockets upon peptide and lipopeptide binding. Thus, we concluded that the structural flexibility of the large B pocket of HLA-A∗2402 and HLA-C∗1402 primarily accounted for their previously unrecognized capacity to bind such chemically distinct ligands as conventional peptides and N-myristoylated lipopeptides.

MHC class I molecules bind peptide antigens and present them to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) (1Garcia K.C. Scott C.A. Brunmark A. Carbone F.R. Peterson P.A.

In virus-infected cells, peptide fragments derived from cytosolic viral proteins are transported into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, in which unstable MHC class I heavy chain–β2-microglobulin (β2m) heterodimer complexes are stabilized by binding peptides of 8 to 11 aa in length (2Peaper D.R. Cresswell P. Regulation of MHC class I assembly and peptide binding.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2008; 24: 343-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 3Sugita M. Brenner M.B.

Med. 1994; 180: 2163-2171Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The peptide-bound MHC class I trimer complexes exit the endoplasmic reticulum and reach the cell surface to display viral peptides in the context of MHC class I molecules, thereby helping CTLs to detect virus-infected cells and eliminate them (4Lechner F. Wong D.K. Dunbar P.R. Chapman R. Chung R.T. Dohrenwend P. et al.Analysis of successful immune responses in persons infected with hepatitis C virus.J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1499-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). The basic principle of MHC class I–mediated peptide antigen presentation is recognized as one of the major paradigms that modern immunology has established; however, there may be some scope for further consideration because a distinct subset of MHC class I molecules has recently been identified in rhesus monkeys that bind lipidated short peptides (lipopeptides) rather than conventional long peptides (5Morita D. Yamamoto Y. Mizutani T. Ishikawa T. Suzuki J. Igarashi T. et al.Crystal structure of the N-myristoylated lipopeptide-bound MHC class I complex.Nat.

Some viral proteins with the N-terminal Gly-X-X-X-Ser/Thr motif undergo N-myristoylation, a lipid modification of proteins in which the exposed Gly residue is conjugated covalently with a 14-carbon fatty acid (myristic acid) (7Boutin J.A. Myristoylation.Cell Signal. 1997; 9: 15-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The simian immunodeficiency virus Nef protein, for example, contains the Gly-Gly-Ala-Ile-Ser sequence, and N-myristoylation serves to dictate its pathological function (8Aldrovandi G.M. Gao L.

On the other hand, simian immunodeficiency virus–infected monkeys mount CTL responses directed against N-terminal lipopeptide fragments of the N-myristoylated Nef protein (10Morita D. Igarashi T.

Ishikawa T. Suzuki J. Igarashi T. et al.Crystal structure of the N-myristoylated lipopeptide-bound MHC class I complex.Nat. Commun. 2016; 710356Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and Mamu-B∗05,104 (6Yamamoto Y. Morita D. Shima Y. Midorikawa A. Mizutani T. Suzuki J. et al.Identification and structure of an MHC class I-encoded protein with the potential to present N-myristoylated 4-mer peptides to T cells.J. Immunol. 2019; 202: 3349-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), respectively, and recognized by specific CTLs. Similar to other MHC class I molecules, the basic six-pocket structure (A through F pockets) is constructed in the antigen-binding groove of Mamu-B∗098 and Mamu-B∗05104, and the B and F pockets function critically in capturing anchor components of ligands. The large B pockets of Mamu-B∗098 and Mamu-B∗05104 are capable of accommodating the long-chain fatty acid moiety of lipopeptide ligands by establishing numerous Van der Waals (VDW) interactions between the pocket surface and bound acyl chain, contrasting sharply with those of other MHC class I molecules that accommodate the P2 amino acid residue of peptide ligands (5Morita D. Yamamoto Y. Mizutani T. Ishikawa T. Suzuki J. Igarashi T. et al.Crystal structure of the N-myristoylated lipopeptide-bound MHC class I complex.Nat. Commun. 2016; 710356Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 6Yamamoto Y. Morita D. Shima Y. Midorikawa A. Mizutani T.

Immunol. 2019; 202: 3349-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). On the other hand, F pockets that bind the C-terminal amino acid residue of either peptide or lipopeptide ligands are virtually identical in structure and function. These lines of evidence suggest that the architecture of B pockets may be critical to peptide and lipopeptide binding. MHC class I allomorphs that bind lipopeptides have been identified so far only in rhesus monkeys, and it remains to be determined whether such molecules exist in other species, including humans. In the present study, we focused on a particular amino acid residue at position 9, which may function as a critical element for determining the size and chemical properties of the B pocket, and found that human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A∗24:02 and HLA-C∗14:02 molecules have the potential to bind N-myristoylated lipopeptides besides conventional peptides. The X-ray crystallographic structures of peptide- and lipopeptide-bound HLA-A∗24:02 and HLA-C∗14:02 complexes detected B-pocket remodeling mechanisms, which explained how these molecules could bind chemically distinct ligands. Among members of the classical MHC class I family, the two rhesus lipopeptide-presenting MHC class I allomorphs, Mamu-B∗098 and Mamu-B∗05104, are marked by their exceptionally large B pockets. The depth of the B pocket is determined critically by the amino acid residue at position 9, which is located on the β-sheet floor with its side chain protruding upward into the lumen of the B pocket (12Bjorkman P.J. Saper M.A. Samraoui B. Bennett W.S. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Structure of the human class I histocompatibility antigen, HLA-A2.Nature. 1987; 329: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (2721) Google Scholar). Mamu-B∗098 and Mamu-B∗05104 have serine (Ser9) and glycine (Gly9) at this position, respectively, and their crystallographic structures point to a critical role for these small amino acid residues in sustaining the structure of the B pocket cavity suitable for accommodating the long-chain fatty acid moiety of lipopeptide ligands (5Morita D. Yamamoto Y. Mizutani T. Ishikawa T. Suzuki J. Igarashi T. et al.Crystal structure of the N-myristoylated lipopeptide-bound MHC class I complex.Nat. Commun. 2016; 710356Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 6Yamamoto Y. Morita D. Shima Y. Midorikawa A. Mizutani T. Suzuki J. et al.Identification and structure of an MHC class I-encoded protein with the potential to present N-myristoylated 4-mer peptides to T cells.J. Immunol. 2019; 202: 3349-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In humans, tyrosine (Tyr9) is regarded as the consensus residue for this position (13Sercinoglu O. Ozbek P. Sequence-structure-function relationships in class I MHC: a local frustration perspective.PLoS One. 2020; 15e0232849Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar); however, a fraction of HLA class I allomorphs expresses Ser9 as is the case with Mamu-B∗098, leading us to the hypothesis that Ser9-containing HLA class I allomorphs may include those with the ability to bind lipopeptides. In this respect, we directed our attention to a pair of mutually related allomorphs, HLA-A∗24:02 and HLA-A∗24:50, which possess Ser9 and Tyr9, respectively, while all the other amino acid residues are identical. We performed side-by-side analyses of these allomorphs to assess the impact of Ser9/Tyr9 exchange on ligand binding. We first employed an in vitro refolding assay in which the soluble form of MHC class I heavy chains was induced to assemble with β2m in a buffer containing appropriate ligands (5Morita D. Yamamoto Y. Mizutani T. Ishikawa T. Suzuki J. Igarashi T. et al.Crystal structure of the N-myristoylated lipopeptide-bound MHC class I complex.Nat. Commun. 2016; 710356Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). When HLA-A∗24:02 heavy chains and β2m were incubated in the presence of the synthetic peptide, RAGFVANF, stable trimer complexes of the heavy chain, β2m, and ligands were formed, which was monitored by a sharp increase in the absorbance value of A280 at an elution volume of 15 ml (Fig. 1, upper middle panel, indicated with an arrow), whereas the corresponding signal was virtually undetectable when the incubation was performed in its absence (upper left panel). Peptide-induced complex formation was also induced for HLA-A∗24:50 heavy chains (lower middle panel, indicated with an arrow), confirming that the refolding capacity per se was comparable between HLA-A∗24:02 and HLA-A∗24:50. The synthetic lipopeptide, N-myristoylated Gly-Ala-Asn-Phe (Myr-GANF; note that the C-terminal 3 amino acid residues were identical to the peptide used above), was also able to promote HLA-A∗24:02 complex formation, as evidenced by the increased signal at an elution volume of 15 ml (upper right panel, indicated with an arrow), which raised the possibility that the Myr-GANF lipopeptide may function as a potent ligand for HLA-A∗24:02. In sharp contrast, Myr-GANF lipopeptide–induced complex formation was reduced markedly for HLA-A∗24:50 (lower right panel, indicated with an arrowhead) as compared with HLA-A∗24:02 (upper right panel). Taken together, these results suggest that the Ser9-containing HLA-A∗24:02 allomorph may have evolved a previously unrecognized ability to bind not only conventional peptides but also N-myristoylated lipopeptides. To establish the molecular basis underlying the potential of HLA-A∗24:02 to bind lipopeptides and determine how the amino acid residue at position 9 may impact ligand binding, the soluble form of HLA-A∗24:02 complexed with the Myr-GANF lipopeptide was prepared, and its crystal structure was determined (Table 1). The overall structure of the Myr-GANF–bound HLA-A∗24:02 complex was almost indistinguishable from those of other HLA class I molecules, characterized by semisymmetrical α1 and α2 domains forming an antiparallel β-sheet topped by semiparallel α-helices (Fig. 2A). Electron density corresponding to the Myr-GANF lipopeptide was observed in the antigen-binding groove, located between α1 and α2 helices on top of the β-sheet (Fig. 2, B and C), which provided structural evidence that the lipopeptide served as an authentic ligand for HLA-A∗24:02. We found that molecular elements located at either end of the Myr-GANF lipopeptide, namely the myristoyl group and C-terminal Phe4 residue, interacted with the B and F pockets, respectively, to function as primary anchors, whereas the A pocket was left unoccupied (Fig. 2C; also see Fig. 3A). These structural features of the Myr-GANF–bound HLA-A∗24:02 complex coincided with the basic principle of lipopeptide binding noted previously for rhesus Mamu-B∗098 and Mamu-B∗05104 (5Morita D.

The myristoyl group of each lipopeptide ligand is displayed in yellow as a space-filling model with the semitransparent B pocket of HLA-A∗24:02 (D) and Mamu-B∗098 (E) with an emphasis on the spatial orientation of the side chain of Ser9 (displayed in green as a space-filling model) and its hydrogen-bond interactions (dashed lines) with side chains of neighboring amino acid residues (green sticks). For comparison, the RAGFVANF peptide (yellow sticks) captured in the antigen-binding groove of HLA-A∗24:50 (C) and the P2 alanine residue (displayed in yellow as a space-filling model) accommodated in its B pocket (F) are also shown. Note that, unlike Ser9 of HLA-A∗24:02 (D) and Mamu-B∗098 (E), the side chain of Tyr9 (depicted in green as a pace-filling model) of HLA-A∗24:50 was directed toward the B-pocket cavity (F).

The myristoyl group of Myr-GANF fitted in the B pocket of HLA-A∗24:02 in a sigmoid-shaped configuration (Fig. 3, A and D), which contrasted with the U-shaped packing pattern observed for Mamu-B∗098 (Fig. 3, B and E). Nevertheless, the spatial orientation of the side chain of Ser9 as well as the role of its β carbon atom (Cβ) in producing VDW forces appeared to be shared between the two molecules. In both cases, Ser9 was located at the bottom of the B pocket, and the hydroxyl group of its side chain was positioned away from the ligand by establishing hydrogen-bond interactions with neighboring amino acid residues (His70 and Asp74 for HLA-A∗24:02 and Thr97 for Mamu-B∗098) (Fig. 3, D and E), which enabled the Cβ atom of Ser9 to interact with the myristoyl group via VDW forces. Therefore, the spatial orientation of the side chain of Ser9 contributed not only to the space expansion of the B pocket cavity but also to the creation of the hydrophobic surface suitable for accommodating the acyl chain of lipopeptide ligands. We considered that this organized structure may not be achieved efficiently in Tyr9-containing MHC class I molecules due to space constraints. Indeed, a crystallographic analysis of HLA-A∗24:50 complexed with the RAGFVANF peptide (Table 1) indicated that the aromatic phenol side chain of Tyr9 protruded into the cavity of the B pocket, which may cause steric hindrance if the myristoyl group of lipopeptide ligands penetrates deeply into the B pocket (Fig. 3, C and F). These lines of structural evidence support the initial hypothesis that Ser9, rather than the Tyr9 residue, is more favorable for lipopeptide binding. The results obtained previously pointed to the marked ability of HLA-A∗24:02 to bind both peptide and lipopeptide ligands. To gain structural insight into this dual binding potential, the crystal structure of HLA-A∗24:02 that was complexed with the RYGFVANF (RF8) peptide (14Liu J. Zhang S. Tan S. Yi Y. Wu B. Cao B. et al.Cross-allele cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses against 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus among HLA-A24 and HLA-A3 supertype-positive individuals.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 13281-13294Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was also determined and compared with that of the lipopeptide-bound form (Table 1). We found that, in the peptide-bound complex, the A pocket accommodated the N-terminal Arg residue by establishing a hydrogen-bond network involving a conserved set of tyrosine residues (Tyr7, Tyr59, Tyr159, and Tyr171) with the amide group and peptide bond of the N-terminal residue (Fig. 4A, right panel). In the lipopeptide-bound complex, the A pocket was ligand-free, but the hydrogen-bond network was still maintained by the use of intervening water molecules (Fig. 4A, left panel). We also noted that the C-terminal Phe residue of the RF8 peptide was accommodated in the F pocket in a manner that was virtually identical to that for the C-terminal Phe residue of the Myr-GANF lipopeptide. In both cases, the peptide bond and carboxyl group of the C-terminal residue were stabilized by interacting with surrounding amino acid residues, Asn77, Tyr84, Thr143, Lys146, and Trp147, while the side chain anchored deeply at the F pocket (Fig. 4B). The B pocket of HLA-A∗24:02 was able to accommodate either the long-chain fatty acid of the Myr-GANF lipopeptide or P2 amino acid residue (Tyr) of the RF8 peptide; therefore, we predicted that its pocket structure may be adaptively reorganizable in order to capture these chemically distinct anchors. In the peptide-bound complex, the hydrogen bond between Ser9 and His70 was maintained but modified in a way that supported a clockwise rotation of the χ2 dihedral angle of His70 at approximately 130 degrees (Fig. 5). This rotary shift of the imidazole ring allowed exposure of its δ nitrogen atom (Nδ1), rather than Cδ2, to the B pocket surface, leading to the establishment of a hydrogen bond with the hydroxy group of the side chain of the P2 Tyr residue (Fig. 5, right panel). Taken together, these observations indicate that the unique capacity of HLA-A∗24:02 to bind peptides and lipopeptides is supported primarily by a reorganized B-pocket structure upon ligand binding. Ser9-containing allomorphs comprise a small subset of HLA class I molecules, and no allomorphs that belong to the HLA-B family have been reported to express Ser9; however, some of the HLA-C family, including HLA-C∗14:02, contain Ser9; therefore, we examined whether the unique features observed previously for HLA-A∗24:02 may be shared with HLA-C∗14:02. Peptide-induced and lipopeptide-induced complex formation in a buffer system was observed for HLA-C∗14:02 (Fig. 6A, upper panels), whereas lipopeptide-induced, but not peptide-induced, complex formation was affected by the Ser to Tyr (S9Y) mutation at position 9 (lower panels). An X-ray crystallographic analysis of the lipopeptide-bound HLA-C∗14:02 complex (Table 1) revealed that the myristoyl group and C-terminal amino acid residue (Leu) of the lipopeptide ligand were accommodated in the B and F pockets, respectively (Fig. 6B). The hydroxyl group of the side chain of Ser9 was positioned away from the B pocket cavity by establishing a hydrogen bond with Asp74, thereby contributing to the creation of an ample cavity with a hydrophobic surface, suitable for accommodating the myristoyl group (Fig. 6D). These observations confirmed that the basic structural principle for lipopeptide binding was shared between HLA-A∗24:02 and HLA-C∗14:02. We also elucidated the crystal structure of HLA-C∗14:02 complexed with the LYNTVATL (LL8) peptide (15Horton H. Havenar-Daughton C. Lee D. Moore E. Cao J. McNevin J. et al.Induction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-specific T-cell responses in HIV vaccine trial participants who subsequently acquire HIV-1 infection.J. Virol. 2006; 80: 9779-9788Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) to address whether B-pocket remodeling may occur in order to capture the P2 amino acid residue, Tyr (Table 1). We found that the hydroxymethyl side chain of Ser9 switched its spatial orientation and protruded into the B pocket cavity by disconnecting the hydrogen bond with Asp74. Alternatively, the side chain of Ser9 formed a hydrogen bond with the phenolic hydroxyl group of the P2 Tyr residue, allowing its anchoring at the B pocket (Fig. 6, C and E). Thus, we concluded that the remodeled hydrogen network involving Ser9 was fundamental for HLA-A∗24:02 and HLA-C∗14:02 to bind peptides and lipopeptides. Crystal structures of peptide-bound MHC class I complexes have been studied extensively over the past 3 decades, advancing our understanding of how peptide ligands interact with the antigen-binding groove. Because the B pocket structure at which the P2 amino acid residue anchors is highly variable among MHC class I molecules, it critically regulates the repertoire of ligands that each MHC class I protein binds, as exemplified by HLA-B27 and HLA-B44 with strong preferences for arginine and glutamic acid, respectively, at the P2 position of peptide ligands (16Jardetzky T.S. Lane W.S. Robinson R.A. Madden D.R. Wiley D.C. Identification of self peptides bound to purified HLA-B27.Nature. 1991; 353: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, 17Sidney J. Southwood S. Pasquetto V. Sette A. Simultaneous prediction of binding capacity for multiple molecules of the HLA B44 supertype.J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 5964-5974Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the capacity of the B pocket of HLA class I molecules to accommodate nonamino acid anchors has never been explored. The present study provided structural evidence to show for the first time that B pockets of HLA-A∗24:02 and HLA-C∗14:02 are capable of binding the long-chain fatty acid component of lipopeptide ligands. As illustrated in the left panels of Figure 7, both allomorphs expressed Ser9 with its side chain oriented away from the B pocket cavity. This spatial arrangement of the hydroxymethyl group contributed not only to maximizing the depth of the B pocket but also to making the Cβ atom available for VDW interactions (indicated with red arcs). Given that these structural features are also shared with the prototypic Mamu-B∗098 (Fig. 3), we propose that the expression of Ser9 and its side-chain orientation may serve as a key element for accommodation of the long-chain fatty acid. On the other hand, this unique B pocket structure that was optimized for lipopeptide binding, was slightly but efficiently remodeled upon peptide binding in order to accommodate the P2 amino acid residue. In the case of HLA-C∗14:02, a direct strategy was adopted in which the hydroxymethyl side chain of Ser9 was redirected toward the B-pocket cavity. This resulted in raising the bottom of the B pocket and increasing the surface hydrophilicity, thereby successfully creating a hydrogen bond with the P2 amino acid residue (Fig. 7, lower panels). Thus, the hinged switch-like movement of the hydroxymethyl group of Ser9 appeared to control peptide and lipopeptide binding. Alternatively, HLA-A∗24:02 adopted a rather indirect strategy in which spatial shifts were induced not for Ser9 itself but for its hydrogen bond partner, His70. Upon lipopeptide binding, the Cδ2 atom of the imidazole ring of His70, as well as the Cβ atom of Ser9, is exposed to the pocket cavity to achieve VDW interactions with the myristoyl group (Fig. 7, upper left panel, indicated with red arcs). In contrast, rotation of the imidazole ring was induced upon peptide binding, resulting in exposure of the Nδ1 atom to the pocket surface to hydrogen bond with the P2 amino acid residue (upper right panel). Therefore, specific amino acid residues other than Ser9 also control lipopeptide binding, suggesting that some but not all Ser9-containing HLA class I allomorphs may have evolved lipopeptide-binding ability. Viruses utilize host-derived N-myristoyltransferase and myristoyl-CoA to achieve N-myristoylation of their own proteins, and N-myristoylated viral proteins often dictate their pathogenesis (18Bryant M. Ratner L. Myristoylation-dependent replication and assembly of human immunodeficiency virus 1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Therefore, the expansion of the repertoire of MHC class I–bound ligands that includes lipopeptides besides conventional peptides may confer advantages in evolutionary terms. As stated previously, none of the HLA-B molecules expresses Ser9 while Ser9-containing allomorphs comprise 19% and 14% in the HLA-A and HLA-C families, respectively. In rhesus monkeys, 43% of Mamu-B alleles encode Ser9-containing allomorphs, comprising a major subset in this family, while only 7% of Mamu-A1 allomorphs express Ser9. Thus, it is interesting to consider that each vertebrate is still undergoing evolutionary processes to create allomorphs that have evolved the ability to bind both peptides and lipopeptides and that efficiencies in this task vary significantly among MHC class I loci of individual species (19Fukami-Kobayashi K. Shiina T. Anzai T. Sano K. Yamazaki M. Inoko H. et al.Genomic evolution of MHC class I region in primates.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9230-9234Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this respect, Mamu-B∗098 may be regarded as an extreme example in that it has lost the ability to bind peptides by occluding the channel connecting between the A and B pockets while maintaining the ability to bind lipopeptides (5Morita D. Yamamoto Y. Mizutani T. Ishikawa T. Suzuki J. Igarashi T. et al.Crystal structure of the N-myristoylated lipopeptide-bound MHC class I complex.Nat. Commun. 2016; 710356Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 20Shima Y. Morita D. Mizutani T. Mori N. Mikami B. Sugita M. Crystal structures of lysophospholipid-bound MHC class I molecules.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 6983-6991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In uninfected, healthy cells, only a tiny fraction of cellular proteins is N-myristoylated (7Boutin J.A. Myristoylation.Cell Signal. 1997; 9: 15-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Accordingly, cellular peptides are likely to predominate over lipopeptides as endogenous ligands for HLA-A∗24:02 and HLA-C∗14:02. Shortly after virus invasion into the cells, however, dysregulated production of N-myristoylated viral proteins may occur, which is associated with the accumulation of N-terminal lipopeptide fragments derived from defective ribosomal products or DRiPs (21Yewdell J.W. DRiPs solidify: progress in understanding endogenous MHC class I antigen processing.Trends Immunol. 2011; 32: 548-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Under such pathological conditions, the transient and rapid increase in the cellular pool of viral lipopeptides may allow HLA-A∗24:02 and HLA-C∗14:02 to sample lipopeptide ligands efficiently and activate lipopeptide-specific CTLs. The ability of these HLA class I molecules to present lipopeptides to T cells remains to be addressed, which depends on whether potential T-cell epitopes are exposed for T-cell recognition and whether the repertoire of functional T-cell receptors (TCRs) are prepared. An X-ray crystallographic analysis of lipopeptide-bound Mamu-B∗05104 in a form that is cocrystallized with specific TCRs indicates that the amide group of the N-myristoylated glycine residue (Myr-Gly1) hydrogen bonds with the TCR CDR3β loop, thus offering a primary T-cell epitope (22Morita D. Iwashita C. Mizutani T. Mori N. Mikami B. Sugita M. Crystal structure of the ternary complex of TCR, MHC class I and lipopeptides.Int. Immunol. 2020; 32: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). On the other hand, TCRs are positioned remotely from the peptide portion of lipopeptide ligands, and no direct interactions are observed, suggesting that lipopeptides are recognized in a way distinct from the well-established mechanism for peptide recognition. Because the spatial orientation of the amide group of Myr-Gly1 differs significantly among N-myristoylated lipopeptides, we hypothesize that the peptide portion of lipopeptide may control antigenicity indirectly rather than offering primary T-cell epitopes. The lipopeptide-binding capacity of HLA class I molecules demonstrated in the present study sheds light on a new aspect of the MHC class I system that has evolutionary and medical implications. N-myristoylated 4-mer lipopeptides, Myr-GANF and Myr-GAAL, as well as 8-mer peptides, LANTVATL and LYNTVATL (LL8), were synthesized by manual Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis using Wang resin preloaded with either phenylalanine (for Myr-GANF) or leucine (for the other compounds) (Watanabe Chemical Industries). Acylation was carried out by reacting the N-terminal amide group with myristic acid anhydrides, as described previously (10Morita D. Igarashi T. Horiike M. Mori N. Sugita M. Cutting edge: t cells monitor N-myristoylation of the nef protein in simian immunodeficiency virus-infected monkeys.J. Immunol. 2011; 187: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The synthesized products were released in 95% TFA and prepared as a form of acetate salts. The 8-mer peptides RAGFVANF and RYGFVANF (RF8) were purchased from GenScript Japan Inc. Complementary DNA sequences encoding the ectodomains (from Gly-1 to Pro-276) of HLA-A∗24:02 and HLA-C∗14:02 were synthesized (IDT Inc) and cloned into pET21c(+) (Addgene). Complementary DNA constructs encoding HLA-A∗24:50 and the S9Y mutant of HLA-C∗14:02 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. The expression plasmids were introduced into the Escherichia coli Rosetta 2 (DE3) pLysS strain (Novagen), and recombinant proteins were expressed as inclusion bodies. To obtain HLA-A∗24:02 and HLA-C∗14:02 complexes, purified heavy chains (1 mmol/L) and β2m (1 mmol/L) were assembled by rapid dilution in a refolding buffer in the presence of a 20-fold molar excess of specific ligands, as described previously (5Morita D.

Commun. 2016; 710356Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Each sample was then dialyzed against 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, and subjected to size-exclusion chromatography using the Superdex 200 Increase column (10 × 300 mm, GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The formation of the heavy chain–β2m–ligand trimer complexes was monitored by an increase of A280 values at an elution volume of 15 ml. The ligand-bound HLA class I complexes were purified sequentially by size-exclusion chromatography, followed by monoQ (GE Healthcare) anion exchange chromatography, and crystals were formed by a sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method. For the HLA-A∗24:02:Myr-GANF complex, 1 μl of protein solution (7 mg/ml in 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0) was mixed with 1 μl of a mother liquid containing 2 mM ZnCl2, 100 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and 20% PEG 6000 and incubated at 4 °C. For the HLA-A∗24:02:RF8 complex, 1 μl of protein solution (10 mg/ml in 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM ZnCl2, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0) was mixed with 1 μl of a mother liquid containing 100 mM Tris, pH 7.8, and 20% PEG 6000 and incubated at 20 °C. For the HLA-A∗24:50–RAGFVANF complex, 1 μl of protein solution (10 mg/ml in 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM ZnCl2, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0) was mixed with 1 μl of a mother liquid containing 100 mM Tris, pH 7.8, and 20% PEG 8000 and incubated at 4 °C. For the HLA-C∗14:02–Myr-GAAL complex, 1 μl of protein solution (10 mg/ml in 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0) was mixed with 1 μl of a mother liquid containing 200 mM ammonium acetate, 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.7, 25% PEG Smear Low (Molecular Dimensions), and 5% ethylene glycol and incubated at 4 °C. For the HLA-C∗14:02–LL8 complex, 1 μl of protein solution (10 mg/ml in 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0) was mixed with 1 μl of a mother liquid containing 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5, and 20% PEG Smear Low and incubated at 20 °C. The crystals were cryoprotected in 20% ethylene glycol, and diffraction data were collected at 100 K (in a cold nitrogen gas stream) either on an MX-225HE detector (Rayonix) or on an EIGER X 4M detector (DECTRIS) with a wavelength of 1.0 Å. The resulting datasets were processed, merged, and scaled using XDS (Max Planck Institute for Medical Research) for HLA-A∗24:02 and HKL-2000 (HKL Research) for HLA-C∗14:02. Structures of the ligand-bound HLA-A∗24:02 and HLA-A∗24:50 complexes were clarified by molecular replacement with the HLA-A∗24:02 complex (Protein Data Bank ID: 4F7T) as a search model, by MOLREP as implemented in CCP4i software (http://legacy.ccp4.ac.uk/index.php), whereas those of the ligand-bound HLA-C∗14:02 complexes were resolved by MOLREP with the HLA-C∗06:02 complex (Protein Data Bank ID: 5W6A) as a search model. The models were refined using REFMAC5 and PHENIX1.9/1.10 software (http://www.phenix-online.org).

https://openalex.org/W4281727676,"Background Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis using direct infusion of biological fluids is often problematic due to high salts/buffers. Iodinated contrast media (ICM) are frequently used for diagnostic imaging purposes, sometimes inducing acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with reduced kidney function. Therefore, detection of ICM in spent hemodialysates is important for AKI patients who require urgent continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF) because it allows noninvasive assessment of the patient’s treatment. In this study, we used a novel desalination tube before MS to inject the sample directly and detect ICM. Methods Firstly, spent hemodialysates of one patient were injected directly into the electrospray ionization (ESI) source equipped with a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Q-TOF MS) coupled to an online desalination tube for the detection of ICM and other metabolites. Thereafter, spent hemodialysates of two patients were injected directly into the ESI source equipped with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (TQ-MS) connected to that online desalination tube to confirm the detection of ICM. Results We detected iohexol (an ICM) from untreated spent hemodialysates of the patient-administered iohexol for computed tomography using Q-TOF MS. Using MRM profile analysis, we have confirmed the detection of ICM in the untreated spent hemodialysates of the patients administered for coronary angiography before starting CHDF. Using the desalination tube, we observed approximately 178 times higher signal intensity and 8 times improved signal-to-noise ratio for ioversol (an ICM) compared to data obtained without the desalination tube. This system was capable of tracking the changes of ioversol in spent hemodialysates of AKI patients by measuring spent hemodialysates. Conclusion The online desalination tube coupled with MS showed the capability of detecting iohexol and ioversol in spent hemodialysates without additional sample preparation or chromatographic separation. This approach also demonstrated the capacity to monitor the ioversol changes in patients’ spent hemodialysates."
https://openalex.org/W4285614635,"This study seeks answers to questions such as: what is fiscal adjustment? Which fiscal strategy will result in a reduction in public debt liabilities? In the pursuit of answers to these questions, the study has defined two objectives. Firstly, the fiscal adjustment episodes must be identified in order to detach the discretionary fiscal stance; secondly, the success of these adjustment episodes in reducing public debt liabilities must be assessed. As a result, attempts will be made to undertake analyses that would simplify the issues underlying Pakistan’s practical policy options. A total of eleven adjustment episodes have been observed in a sample, ranging from 1976 to 2017, following Alesina and Ardagna’s definition. The descriptive analysis reveals that five episodes succeeded in reducing the public debt, while six episodes failed to reduce the ratio. Out of the five successful episodes, four are found to be spending-based and one is tax-based. To quantify the success of fiscal adjustment, the empirical model has been calibrated on Leibrecht and Scharler’s model and estimation is done via both the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Robust Least Squares (RLS) methods. The RLS method produces better outcomes than the OLS method. Under RLS, all variables are significant except GDP growth, whereas in the OLS model, the election year and regime shift, together with GDP growth, are statistically insignificant. The fiscal adjustment’s composition reveals that spending-based consolidation boosts the chances of the fiscal adjustment’s success. Fiscal authorities should, therefore, adopt spending-based austerity measures to ensure the sustainability of public finances and prevent the negative macroeconomic consequences of unsustainable public debt."

In the present study, we have measured the adhesion between single cancer cells and two types of ECs at various growth states and their mechanical properties (elasticity) using atomic force microscopy single cell force spectroscopy. We demonstrated that the EC stiffness increased and adhesion with cancer cells decreased, as ECs grew from a single cell to a confluent state and developed cell-cell contacts, but this was reversed when confluent cells returned to a single state in a scratch assay. Our results suggest that the integrity of the endothelial barrier is an important factor in reducing the ability of the metastatic tumor cells to adhere to the vascular endothelium, extravasate and lodge in the vasculature of a distant organ where secondary metastatic tumors would develop."

We also tested hAEC ciliary beat frequency (CBF). Next, we assessed alterations to hAEC gene expression using RNA sequencing, and based on results, we measured neutrophil migration across hAECs.Calcitriol supplementation enhanced ASL bacterial killing of Staphylococcus aureus (p = 0.02) but did not enhance its antiviral activity against 229E-CoV. It had no effect on ASL pH or viscosity at three timepoints. Lastly, it did not affect hAEC CBF or neutrophil migration, although there was a trend of enhanced migration in the presence of a neutrophil chemokine (p = 0.09). Supplementation significantly altered hAEC gene expression, primarily of AMP-related genes including CAMP and TREM1.While vitamin D supplementation did not have effects on many airway innate immune mechanisms, it may provide a useful tool to resolve respiratory bacterial infections."

The aim of our study was to investigate whether this variation might be explained by preferences of surgeons, organisational factors or the influence of patients preferences. Methods A cross-sectional web survey was conducted among 260 Dutch oncological/breast surgeons. Preferences of surgeons and the influence of the patients’ preferences were determined by means of best-worst scaling (BWS) of profile case scenarios and by ranking risk factors. The survey also explored organisational questions, the reported use of diagnostic techniques and influences on the decision. Results The BWS scenarios were completed by 57 surgeons. The most important reasons for performing SLNB were a suspected invasive component and DCIS grade 3. In the ranking, these were also the first and second most important factor, followed by the size of the lesion and a mass on mammogram. In 58% to 70% of the scenarios, the surgeons would not change their decisions on the use of SLNB if the patient’s chose differed. No organisational factor was significantly associated with the reported use of SLNB. Conclusion The inter-hospital variation in the use of SLNB could not be attributed to organisational factors or surgeons’ preferences for risk factors. The risk factors that most surgeons reported as reasons for performing SLNB are consistent with the factors described in the Dutch treatment guideline for the use of SLNB."
https://openalex.org/W4281722518,"The evolution of the remarkably complex primate brain has been a topic of great interest for decades. Multiple factors have been proposed to explain the comparatively larger primate brain (relative to body mass), with recent studies indicating diet has the greatest explanatory power. Dietary specialisations also correlate with dental adaptations, providing a potential evolutionary link between brain and dental morphological evolution. However, unambiguous evidence of association between brain and dental phenotypes in primates remains elusive. Here we investigate the effect of diet on variation in primate brain and dental morphology and test whether the two anatomical systems coevolved. We focused on the primate suborder Strepsirrhini, a living primate group that occupies a very wide range of dietary niches. By making use of both geometric morphometrics and dental topographic analysis, we extend the study of brain-dental ecomorphological evolution beyond measures of size. After controlling for allometry and evolutionary relatedness, differences in brain and dental morphology were found between dietary groups, and brain and dental morphologies were found to covary. Historical trajectories of morphological diversification revealed a strong integration in the rates of brain and dental evolution and similarities in their modes of evolution. Combined, our results reveal an interplay between brain and dental ecomorphological adaptations throughout strepsirrhine evolution that can be linked to diet."

Thus, the more informed farmers may not work hard in the process of planting crops. This opportunistic behavior of farmers caused by asymmetric information has seriously affected the sustainability of contract farming. An enterprise with reciprocity preference tends to make a contract both improves farmers' welfare and brings enough profit to sustain its own operations, while a farmer with reciprocity will work hard in return for the enterprise's reward. In this paper, we develop a non-profit index principal-agent model between enterprises and farmers, assuming both have reciprocity preference, to investigate how to design an incentive mechanism in contract farming. We begin our analysis by establishing a non-profit index evaluation system to evaluate farmers' effort degree in contract fulfillment. Then we solve principal-agent problem with the assumption that farmers' expected certainty income premium (ECIP) is constant. We find that in the perfect Bayesian equilibrium, farmers with higher degree of reciprocity preference require less ECIP, and will improve efforts to complete contract tasks, even actively sacrifice their own interests to repay extra rewards from enterprises. Furthermore, we explore our model to the scenario in which farmers' ECIP is a function of enterprise payment difference (EPD). We find that the higher the degree of reciprocity preference of farmers, the greater the probability of enterprises to increase income. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the validity of the conclusions. Our study shows that the reciprocity preference behavior of enterprises and farmers improves the fulfillment rate of contract farming, which contributes to the realization of the incentive mechanism of contract farming."
https://openalex.org/W4281731202,"The daylight and color vision of diurnal vertebrates depends on cone photoreceptors. The capability of cones to operate and respond to changes in light brightness even under high illumination is attributed to their fast rate of recovery to the ground photosensitive state. This process requires the rapid replenishing of photoisomerized visual chromophore (11-cis-retinal) to regenerate cone visual pigments. Recently, several gene candidates have been proposed to contribute to the cone-specific retinoid metabolism, including acyl-CoA wax alcohol acyltransferase 2 (AWAT2, aka MFAT). Here, we evaluated the role of AWAT2 in the regeneration of visual chromophore by the phenotypic characterization of Awat2−/− mice. The global absence of AWAT2 enzymatic activity did not affect gross retinal morphology or the rate of visual chromophore regeneration by the canonical RPE65-dependent visual cycle. Analysis of Awat2 expression indicated the presence of the enzyme throughout the murine retina, including the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and Müller cells. Electrophysiological recordings revealed reduced maximal rod and cone dark-adapted responses in AWAT2-deficient mice compared to control mice. While rod dark adaptation was not affected by the lack of AWAT2, M-cone dark adaptation both in isolated retina and in vivo was significantly suppressed. Altogether, these results indicate that while AWAT2 is not required for the normal operation of the canonical visual cycle, it is a functional component of the cone-specific visual chromophore regenerative pathway."
https://openalex.org/W4281784243,"In the past few decades, constitution-making processes have shifted from being undertakings performed by elites and closed off from the public to ones incorporating democratic mechanisms. Little is known, however, about the determinants of voluntary public participation and how they affect the outcomes of the deliberative process in terms of content and quality. Here, we study the process of constituent involvement in the rewriting of Chile’s constitution in 2016. A total of 106, 412 citizens in 8, 113 different local encounters voluntarily congregated in groups of ten or more to collectively determine what social rights should be considered for inclusion in the new constitution, deliberating and then articulating in the written word why should be included. We brought our data to statistical regression models at the municipality level, the results show that the main determinants associated with increasing citizen participation are educational level, engagement in politics, support for the government, and Internet access. In contrast, population density and the share of Evangelical Christians in the general population decrease citizen participation. Then, we further analyze the written arguments for each collectively-selected constitutional rights. The findings suggest that groups from socioeconomically developed municipalities (with higher educational levels and where the main economic activities are more distant from natural resources), on average, deliberate consistently more about themes, concepts, and ideas compared to groups from less developed municipalities. These results provide an empirical ground on the driver factors of voluntary citizen participation and on the benefits and disadvantages of deliberative democracy. Hence, results can inform the organization of new deliberative processes."
https://openalex.org/W4281792331,"Introduction Chewing well is essential for successful diet therapy and control of blood glucose level in patients with diabetes. In addition, long-term hyperglycemia is a risk factor for microvascular complications, which are the main cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Hence, it is plausible that masticatory disorder may be relevant to diabetic microvascular complications which is caused by long-term hyperglycemia. The aim of this study was to investigate whether masticatory disorders are relevant to diabetic microvascular complications. Methods This cross-sectional study included 172 patients with type 2 diabetes who underwent educational hospitalization in the Department of Endocrinology and Diabetic Medicine, Hiroshima University Hospital, from April 2016 to March 2020. Masticatory efficiency was determined quantitatively by using the GLUCO SENSOR GS-Ⅱ. Multivariable linear regression models were constructed to examine which factors were related to masticatory efficiency. Statistical significance was defined as a two-sided p value of &lt; 0.05. Results According to the bivariable analysis, masticatory efficiency was significantly correlated with duration of diabetes ( p = 0. 049), number of remaining teeth ( p &lt; 0.0001), the number of moving teeth ( p = 0.007) and condition of diabetic neuropathy ( p &lt; 0.0001). Moreover, the number of remaining teeth ( p &lt; 0.0001) and diabetic neuropathy ( p = 0.007) remained significantly correlated with masticatory efficiency in the multivariable analysis. Conclusions For the first time, we demonstrated that patients with type 2 diabetes who developed diabetic neuropathy had significantly reduced masticatory efficiency. Effective mastication is an important factor in successful diet therapy for diabetes. To prevent the progression of diabetic complications, especially in patients with diabetic neuropathy, it may be necessary to combine individualized therapies from dentists and nutritionists with consideration for the level of masticatory dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W4281842530,"Bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) coordinates transcription with DNA repair and replication. Many RNAP mutations have pleiotropic phenotypes with profound effects on transcription-coupled processes. One class of RNAP mutations (rpo∗) has been shown to suppress mutations in regulatory factors responsible for changes in gene expression during stationary phase or starvation, as well as in factors involved in the restoration of replication forks after DNA damage. These mutations were suggested to affect the ability of RNAP to transcribe damaged DNA and to decrease the stability of transcription complexes, thus facilitating their dislodging during DNA replication and repair, although this was not explicitly demonstrated. Here, we obtained nine mutations of this class located around the DNA/RNA binding cleft of Escherichia coli RNAP and analyzed their transcription properties in vitro. We found that these mutations decreased promoter complex stability to varying degrees, and all decreased the activity of rRNA promoters. However, they did not have strong effects on elongation complex stability. Some mutations were shown to stimulate transcriptional pauses or decrease intrinsic RNA cleavage by RNAP, but none altered the ability of RNAP to transcribe DNA templates containing damaged nucleotides. Thus, we conclude that the suppressor phenotypes of the mutations are unlikely to result from direct effects on DNA lesion recognition by RNAP but may be primarily explained by changes in transcription initiation. Further analysis of the effects of these mutations on the genomic distribution of RNAP and its interactions with regulatory factors will be essential for understanding their diverse phenotypes in vivo.

Transcription—the process of RNA synthesis on the genomic DNA template by RNA polymerase (RNAP)—is a pivotal step in gene expression. However, transcribing RNAP poses a major obstacle for other cellular machineries acting on the genomic DNA, first of all, during DNA replication (1Lang K.S. Merrikh H.

One of proposed consequences of head-on collisions is replication fork reversal, during which the newly synthesized DNA strands anneal behind stalled forks. Reversed forks can be processed by the action of the Holliday junction resolvase RuvABC and the helicase-nuclease RecBCD, which likely remove the reversed double-stranded DNA end and restore the active fork geometry (1Lang K.S.

Various types of DNA lesions can also lead to RNAP stalling both in vitro and in vivo, and transcription complexes stalled on damaged DNA are a major threat to DNA replication. At the same time, transcribing RNAP acts as a sensor of DNA damage in the template strand, and stalled TECs recruit repair factors to DNA lesions during transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR) (26Oh J.

Screening of suppressors of the UV-sensitive phenotype of Escherichia coli strains with defects in DNA repair and stringent response revealed a class of rpo∗ mutations in the β and β′ subunits of RNAP that restored the viability of these strains under DNA damaging conditions and could also suppress mutations in the RuvABC resolvase (29McGlynn P.

Lloyd R.G. Modulation of DNA repair by mutations flanking the DNA channel through RNA polymerase.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6944-6953Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Most of these mutations also suppressed defects in RecBCD involved in double-strand break processing, although with a lower efficiency (29McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G.

It was therefore proposed that the suppressor RNAP mutations may decrease conflicts with replication and prevent replication fork collapse and formation of Holliday junction intermediates, which require processing by RuvABC and RecBCD (15Michel B.

Notably, rpo∗ mutations could also suppress defects in the stringent response system and allow cell survival under stress conditions in the absence of the stringent alarmone ppGpp (29McGlynn P.

Destabilization of promoter complexes by the suppressor mutations was proposed to explain their stringent phenotype, by mimicking the effects of ppGpp/DksA. It was also suggested that rpo∗ mutations may possibly change RNAP properties during transcription elongation (30Trautinger B.W. Lloyd R.G.

In particular, it was hypothesized that the rpo∗ mutations may destabilize the TEC and/or help the replication and repair factors to disassemble transcription complexes in highly transcribed or damaged DNA loci (30Trautinger B.W. Lloyd R.G. Modulation of DNA repair by mutations flanking the DNA channel through RNA polymerase.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6944-6953Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 31Trautinger B.W. Jaktaji R.P.

In support of this, some rpo∗ mutations were shown to suppress deletions of the Rep and UvrD helicases that play an accessory role in replication by removing roadblocks to the replisome (23Guy C.P. Atkinson J. Gupta M.K. Mahdi A.A. Gwynn E.J. Rudolph C.J. et al.Rep provides a second motor at the replisome to promote duplication of protein-bound DNA.Mol.

Modulation of DNA repair by mutations flanking the DNA channel through RNA polymerase.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6944-6953Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, no detailed analysis of the transcriptional properties of various suppressor mutations has been performed to date, and their actual effects on the activity of RNAP have largely remained unknown. To get better insight into the nature of the phenotypes of the suppressor rpo∗ mutations, we obtained nine of these mutations in E. coli RNAP: Q148P, H447P, T563P, H1244Q, and G1260D substitutions in the β subunit and K215 E, Δ312-314, K789Q, and R1148H variants in the β′ subunit of E. coli RNAP (Fig. 1). All selected substitutions face either the downstream DNA binding channel (H447P, K215E, Δ312–314, and R1148H) or the RNA-DNA hybrid (Q148P, T563P, H1244Q, and G1260D); K789Q is located in the bridge helix contacting the template DNA strand and the RNA 3′-end at the active site (30Trautinger B.W. Lloyd R.G. Modulation of DNA repair by mutations flanking the DNA channel through RNA polymerase.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6944-6953Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).We purified the mutant enzyme variants, tested their properties in vitro, and showed that some of them moderately affect RNA elongation, by changing the efficiency of transcriptional pausing or intrinsic RNA cleavage, but none has significant effects on transcription of damaged DNA in vitro. At the same time, all the mutants decrease the activity of rRNA promoters in vitro and decrease the stability of promoter complexes to varying degrees. The results suggest that the suppressor effects of the RNAP mutations are unlikely to result from their direct influence on DNA lesion recognition or bypass but might be explained by changes in RNAP interactions with regulatory factors during RNA elongation or by their effects on transcription initiation and genomic distribution of RNAP. Previously, several suppressor mutations in RNAP, including T563P analyzed here, were shown to decrease stability of promoter complexes, possibly explaining their stringent phenotype (34Zhou Y.N.

We therefore compared the effects of the nine RNAP mutations on promoter complex stability in vitro. We challenged promoter complexes formed by the WT or mutant RNAPs on the T7A1 promoter with heparin and measured RNAP activities after increasing time intervals (see Materials and Methods and Fig. S1 for all experimental details). Under the conditions of our experiments, about half of promoter complexes of WT RNAP dissociated within 5 min (the half-life time t1/2 = 4.2 ± 1.8 min; Figs. 2A and S3). The previously studied T563P substitution, as well as Q148P and H447P substitutions in the β subunit, greatly destabilized promoter complexes, with most complexes inactivated within 1 min or less (t1/2 was decreased 4–10-fold in comparison with WT RNAP) (Fig. 2A). The R1148H, H1244Q, and G1260D substitutions in the β subunit decreased t1/2 of promoter complexes 2- to 2.5-fold, while the remaining three RNAPs, K215E, Δ312-314, and K789Q in the β′ subunit had only minor effects on promoter complex stability (Figs. 2A and S3). We further tested the activity of the mutant RNAPs on rRNA promoters, which form highly unstable promoter complexes (36Paul B.J. Ross W. Gaal T. Gourse R.L. rRNA transcription in Escherichia coli.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2004; 38: 749-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), using a supercoiled plasmid containing the rrnB P1 promoter. The plasmid also contained a second promoter responsible for synthesis of RNA I from the replication origin, which forms stable complexes with RNAP (37Pupov D. Petushkov I. Esyunina D. Murakami K.S. Kulbachinskiy A. Region 3.2 of the sigma factor controls the stability of rRNA promoter complexes and potentiates their repression by DksA.Nucl. Acids Res. 2018; 46: 11477-11487Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It was found that the activity of the rrnB P1 promoter relative to the RNA I promoter was significantly decreased for all mutant RNAPs in comparison with the WT enzyme (4–18-fold, p-value < 0.05 in all cases) (Fig. 2B). It can therefore be concluded that various suppressor mutations decrease the stability of promoter complexes to varying degrees, but all have a common effect on the activity of rRNA promoters and possibly of other promoters that form unstable complexes with RNAP. Previous studies of suppressor mutations in E. coli RNAP proposed that they might destabilize TECs formed by the mutant RNAPs thus helping the replisome and repair factors to displace them from the DNA template (see Introduction). To reveal possible effects of these mutations on transcription elongation, we compared the TEC stabilities, the rates of RNA synthesis, and the efficiency of intrinsic transcription termination by the WT and mutant RNAP variants. We first tested the stabilities of TECs formed by the mutant RNAPs obtained after transcription initiation and stalled at the +20 template position by nucleotide deprivation. The TECs were bound to affinity resin and incubated at high ionic strength conditions to induce RNA dissociation, and the fraction of stably bound–labeled RNA transcripts was measured over time (Fig. 2C). It was found that the majority of the complexes formed by WT E. coli RNAP remained bound to the sorbent during the course of experiment. Similarly, the analyzed RNAP substitutions did not result in dramatic changes in the TEC stability, with the major fraction of RNA remaining bound to the TEC within 30 min. Therefore, the mutations do not have great destabilizing effects on the TEC, at least in the absence of additional factors. To determine the average rate of RNA elongation, we analyzed the kinetics of RNA extension in transcription complexes formed on a DNA template containing a 500 bp long fragment of the rpoB gene lacking strong pause-inducing signals (Fig. 3) (38Esyunina D. Agapov A. Kulbachinskiy A. Regulation of transcriptional pausing through the secondary channel of RNA polymerase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2016; 113: 8699-8704Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For the WT RNAP, the synthesis of the full-length run-off RNA product was detected starting from the first minute of the reaction. A similar kinetics of RNA synthesis and a similar pattern of shorter RNA bands likely corresponding to transient transcriptional pauses were observed for the mutant RNAP variants (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the addition of DksA and ppGpp did not have major effects on the kinetics of RNA synthesis on this template for both WT and mutant RNAP variants (Fig. S4). An exception was the H447P RNAP that showed a delayed kinetics of full-length RNA synthesis both in the absence and in the presence of DksA/ppGpp, apparently by stimulating some transcriptional pauses (Figs. 3 and S4). Therefore, most suppressor mutations do not strongly affect the rate of undisturbed RNA elongation by bacterial RNAP. If the suppressor mutations destabilized the TEC, it could be expected that they would increase the efficiency of intrinsic transcription termination, by stimulating RNAP dissociation. To determine whether this was the case, we compared the efficiency of intrinsic transcription termination by the WT and mutant RNAPs on the λ tR2 terminator (Fig. 4). It was found that all RNAP variants had comparable levels of termination. Therefore, the analyzed mutations are unlikely to have a general destabilizing effect on transcription complexes. The observed effects of one of the analyzed substitutions on transcriptional pausing (H447P, see above) prompted us to investigate the effects of the suppressor mutations on the recognition of site-specific pausing signals by RNAP. We first tested whether any of the mutations can change the duration of the elemental transcriptional pause revealed in genome-wide studies of RNAP pausing (39Larson M.H. Mooney R.A. Peters J.M.

The present study aimed to empirically define the conditions for the optimal scatter correction of quantitative bone SPECT/CT images. Scatter correction was performed by applying dual and triple energy windows (DEW and TEW) with different sub-energy window widths, and effective scatter source estimation (ESSE) to CT-based scatter correction. Scattered radiation was corrected on images acquired using a triple line source (TLSP) phantom and an uniform cylinder phantom. The TLSP consisted of a line source containing 74.0 MBq of 99m Tc in the middle, and a background component containing air, water or a K 2 HPO 4 solution with a density equivalent to that of bone. The sum of all pixels in air, water and the K 2 HPO 4 solution was measured on SPECT images. Scatter fraction (SF) and normalized mean square error (NMSE) based on counts from the air background as a reference were then calculated to assess quantitative errors due to scatter correction. The uniform cylinder phantom contained the same K 2 HPO 4 solution and 222.0 MBq of 99m Tc. The coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated from the count profile of this phantom to assess the uniformity of SPECT images across scatter correction under various conditions. Both SF and NMSE in SPECT images of phantoms containing water in the background were lower at a TEW sub-window of 3% (TEW3%), than in other scatter corrections, whereas those in K 2 HPO 4 were lower at a DEW sub-window of 20% (DEW20%). Larger DEW and smaller TEW sub-energy windows allowed more effective correction. The CV of the uniform cylinder phantom, DEW20%, was inferior to all other tested scatter corrections. The quantitative accuracy of bone SPECT images substantially differed according to the method of scatter correction. The optimal scatter correction for quantitative bone SPECT was DEW20% (k = 1), but at the cost of slightly decreased image uniformity."
