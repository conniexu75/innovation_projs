https://openalex.org/W2051918534,"SELECTIVE antagonism of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) and noradrenaline transport by antidepressants is a key element in the 'amine' hypothesis of affective disorders1. Uptake2,3 and/or transport sites4,5 of 5HT have been reported to be reduced in platelets of patients suffering from depression and in post-mortem brain samples of depressed patients6 and suicide victims7. To date there has been little molecular information available on the structure and regulation of 5HT transporters. Using the polymerase chain reaction8with degenerate oligonucleotides9 derived from two highly conserved regions of the transporters for noradrenaline10 and Î³-aminobutyric acid11(GABA), we have identified a large family of related gene products expressed in rodent brain. One of these products hybridizes to a single 3.7-kilobase RNA restricted to rat midbrain and brainstem, where it is highly enriched within the serotonergic raphe complex. Transfection with a single 2.3-kilobase brainstem complementary DNA clone is sufficient to confer expression of a Na+-dependent 5HT transporter upon non-neural cells, with transport selectively and potently antagonized by 5HT uptake-specific antidepressants, including paroxetine, citalopram and fluoxetine."

https://openalex.org/W2056003065,"Mammalian cells express many ras-like low molecular mass GTP-binding proteins (rab proteins) that are highly homologous to the Ypt1 and Sec4 proteins involved in controlling secretion in yeast. Owing to their structural similarity and to their variety, rab proteins have been postulated to act as specific regulators of membrane traffic in exocytosis and endocytosis, and rab5 has been shown to be involved in early endosome fusion in vitro. In agreement with their postulated functions, all rab proteins studied so far have been found in distinct subcompartments along the exocytic or endocytic pathways. To define the region mediating their specific localization, we transiently expressed rab2, rab5 and rab7 hybrid proteins in BHK cells, and determined their intracellular localization by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation. Here we present evidence that the highly variable C-terminal domain contains structural elements necessary for the association of rab proteins with their specific target membranes in the endocytic pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1670428831,"The beta-cardiac myosin heavy chain is the major contractile protein expressed in two sarcomeric muscles of distinct embryologic origins, the ventricular myocardium and slow twitch skeletal muscle. Characterization of the cis-acting regulatory sequences of the human and the rat beta-MHC genes established that their expression in these two muscle types is controlled, at least in part, by common mechanisms involving a muscle-specific enhancer. This enhancer consists of distinct but cooperative subelements that interact with muscle-specific nuclear proteins. In contrast to other muscle-specific enhancers, the beta-MHC gene enhancer is unresponsive, directly or indirectly, to the muscle lineage-determining and muscle gene-transactivating helix-loop-helix factors MyoD and myogenin. A MyoD-binding site in the rat beta-MHC promoter is not required for transcriptional activity in skeletal and cardiac cells, but is necessary for activation in 10T1/2 and CV1 cells transfected with MyoD. In addition, this element is absent from the human beta-MHC promoter. Thus, MyoD and MyoD-related processes are neither required nor sufficient for the expression of the beta-MHC gene either in cardiac or skeletal muscle cells. These observations provide evidence for the existence of myogenic regulatory programs that precede and/or differ from those governed by known myogenic helix-loop-helix transactivators."
https://openalex.org/W1516389463,"Recently we purified and cloned the mitogen/oncogene-activated Mr 70,000 (70K) S6 kinase from the livers of rats treated with cycloheximide (Kozma, S. C., Lane, H. A., Ferrari, S., Luther, H., Siegmann, M., and Thomas, G. (1989) EMBO J. 8, 4125-4132; Kozma, S. C., Ferrari, S., Bassand, P., Siegmann, M., Totty, N., and Thomas, G. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 87, 7365-7369). Prior to determining the ability of this kinase to phosphorylate the same sites observed in S6 in vivo, we established the effects of different cations and autophosphorylation on kinase activity. The results show that the 70K S6 kinase is dependent on Mg2+ for activity and that this requirement cannot be substituted for by Mn2+. Furthermore, 50-fold lower concentrations of Mn2+ block the effect of Mg2+ on the kinase. This effect is not limited to Mn2+ but can be substituted for by a number of cations, with Zn2+ being the most potent inhibitor, IC50 approximately 2 microM. In the presence of optimum Mg2+ concentrations the enzyme incorporates an average of 1.2 mol of phosphate/mol of kinase and an average of 3.7 mol of phosphate/mol of S6. The autophosphorylation reaction appears to be intramolecular and leads to a 25% reduction in kinase activity toward S6. In the case of S6 all of the sites of phosphorylation are found to reside in a 19-amino acid peptide at the carboxyl end of the protein. Four of these sites have been identified as Ser235, Ser236, Ser240, and Ser244, equivalent to four of the five sites previously observed in vivo (Krieg, J., Hofsteenge, J., and Thomas, G. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 11473-11477). A fifth mole of phosphate is incorporated at low stoichiometry into the peptide, but the amino acid which is phosphorylated cannot be unequivocally assigned. The low level of phosphorylation of the fifth site in vitro is discussed with regard to known results and to a potential three-dimensional model for the carboxyl terminus of S6."

https://openalex.org/W1494070440,"A1 adenosine receptors and associated guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) were purified from bovine cerebral cortex by affinity chromatography (Munshi, R., and Linden, J. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 14853-14859). In this study we have identified the pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein subunits that co-purify with A1 adenosine receptors by immunoblotting with specific antipeptide antisera. Gi alpha 1, Gi alpha 2, Go alpha, G beta 35, and G beta 36 were detected. Of the total [35S]guanosine 5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate [( 35S]GTP gamma S) binding sites, Gi alpha 1 and Go alpha each accounted for greater than 37% whereas Gi alpha 2 comprised less than 13%. G beta 35 was found in excess over G beta 36. Low molecular mass (21-25 kDa) GTP-binding proteins were not detected. We also examined the characteristics of purified receptors and various purified bovine brain G proteins reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles. All three alpha-subunits restored GTP gamma S-sensitive high affinity binding of the agonist 125I-aminobenzyladenosine to a fraction (25%) of reconstituted receptors with a selectivity order of Gi2 greater than Go greater than or equal to Gi1 (ED50 values of G proteins measured as fold excess over the receptor concentration were 4.7 +/- 1.2, 24 +/- 5, and 34 +/- 7, respectively). Furthermore, receptors occupied with the agonist R-phenylisopropyladenosine catalytically increased the rate of binding of [35S]GTP gamma S to reconstituted G proteins by 6.5-8.5-fold. These results suggest that A1 adenosine receptors couple indiscriminately to pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1547637556,"An enzyme complex containing carbon monoxide dehydrogenase and a corrinoid protein has been isolated from Methanosarcina barkeri. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis revealed five polypeptides of molecular masses alpha = 19,700, beta = 84,500, gamma = 63,200, delta = 53,000, and epsilon = 51,400 Da in equimolar amounts. One mol of cobamide cofactor was found per minimal alpha beta gamma delta epsilon unit. The molecular mass of the native complex was 1,600,000 Da by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) gel filtration, which suggested an alpha 6 beta 6 gamma 6 delta 6 epsilon 6 oligomeric structure. Catalysis of a reaction involving cleavage of acetyl-CoA and methylation of tetrahydrosarcinapterin was indicated by spectrophotometric analyses; a time-dependent absorption decrease in the 300-320 nm region was observed in the complete reaction mixture which contained acetyl-CoA, tetrahydrosarcinapterin, and the enzyme complex. In control samples lacking any one of the these components the absorption spectrum remained virtually unaltered. Reversed-phase HPLC analysis confirmed that tetrahydrosarcinapterin was converted to a product that co-eluted with authentic methyltetrahydrosarcinapterin. The product also exhibited the UV-visible absorption spectrum expected for methyltetrahydrosarcinapterin. Free CoA was identified as an additional product of the reaction. The carbonyl group of acetyl-CoA was oxidized to carbon dioxide. Spectral changes indicated concomitant Fe/S center reduction. Production of CoA was essentially stoichiometric with methyltetrahydrosarcinapterin formation and tetrahydrosarcinapterin consumption. Analyses during purification showed that catalytic activity was restricted exclusively to the fractions that contained the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase-corrinoid enzyme complex."
https://openalex.org/W1569256715,"Nucleotide excision repair is a complex biochemical process that corrects DNA damage caused by a broad spectrum of physical and chemical agents. We examined the effect of the assembly of ultraviolet-irradiated plasmid DNA into nucleosomes on nucleotide excision repair supported by human cell extracts. Repair synthesis in unassembled UV-irradiated plasmid DNA was readily detected in extracts from repair-proficient human cells. In contrast, repair synthesis was markedly suppressed in UV-irradiated DNA assembled into nucleosomes (minichromosomes). This suppression occurred at a step(s) which precedes repair synthesis during nucleotide excision repair. Human cell extracts were unable to effectively assemble plasmid DNA into nucleosomes under repair synthesis conditions. The addition of purified histones to the extracts restored their capacity for nucleosome assembly and simultaneously led to the suppression of repair synthesis. We propose that the preferential repair of actively transcribed genes relative to transcriptionally silent genes may reflect altered nucleosome conformation during transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1516084644,"Because of the low hepatic activity of gamma-glutamyl-transferase in the rat, the liver is generally considered to play only a minor role in the degradation of glutathione conjugates, a limiting step in mercapturic acid formation. Recent findings indicate, however, that the liver has a prominent role in glutathione catabolism, particularly in species other than rat. To examine the contributions of liver to mercapturic acid biosynthesis, mercapturate formation was compared in isolated perfused livers from rats and guinea pigs dosed with either 0.3 or 3.0 mumol of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB). Chemically synthesized glutathione conjugate, mercapturic acid, and intermediary metabolites of CDNB were used as standards in the high performance liquid chromatography analysis of bile and perfusate samples. Biliary excretion accounted for almost all of the recovered metabolites. A marked species difference was observed in the pattern of CDNB metabolism. Rat livers dosed with 0.3 mumol of CDNB excreted 55% of total biliary metabolites as the glutathione conjugate and 8.2% as the mercapturic acid, whereas guinea pig livers excreted only 4.8% as the glutathione conjugate and 47% as the mercapturate. Mercapturic formation was also dose-dependent, with a larger fraction formed at the 0.3- versus the 3.0-mumol dose (8.2 versus 3.7% in the rat; 47 versus 19% in the guinea pig). Hepatic conversion of the glutathione conjugate to the mercapturic acid was markedly inhibited in both species after retrograde intrabiliary infusion of acivicin, an inhibitor of gamma-glutamyltransferase activity. These findings provide direct evidence for intrahepatic biosynthesis of mercapturic acids. Thus, glutathione conjugates synthesized within hepatocytes are secreted into bile and broken down to cysteine conjugates; the latter are then presumably reabsorbed by the liver, N-acetylated to form the mercapturic acid and re-excreted into bile."
https://openalex.org/W1492651983,"Long chain fatty acid uptake was investigated in 3T3-L1 cells. Differentiation of these cells from fibroblasts to adipocytes was accompanied by an 8.5-fold increase in the rate of oleate uptake. This was saturable in adipocytes with apparent Kt and Vmax values of 78 nM and 16 nmol/min/mg cell protein, respectively. A number of proteins in various subcellular fractions of differentiated cells were labeled with the photoreactive fatty acid 11-m-diazirinophenoxy[11-3H]undecanoate. A 15-kDa cytoplasmic protein was induced upon differentiation to adipocytes. This protein was labeled with the photoreactive fatty acid in cytoplasm isolated from differentiated adipocytes, but not in cytoplasm from undifferentiated, fibroblastic cells. Furthermore, a high affinity fatty acid binding protein of 22 kDa was identified in plasma membranes of undifferentiated cells, and its level of labeling increased 2-fold upon differentiation. These results indicate the usefulness of the photoreactive fatty acid in identifying cellular fatty acid binding proteins, and its potential to elucidate the spatial and temporal distribution of fatty acids in intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W1593852870,"The maize gene RAB-17, which is responsive to abscisic acid, encodes a basic glycine-rich protein containing, in the middle part of its sequence, a cluster of 8 serine residues followed by a putative casein kinase 2-type substrate consensus sequence. This protein was found to be highly phosphorylated in vivo. Here, we show that RAB-17 protein is a real substrate for casein kinase 2. RAB-17 protein is phosphorylated in vitro by casein kinase 2 isolated from rat liver cytosol and from maize embryos. A maximum of 4 mol of phosphate were incorporated per mol of RAB-17 protein following incubation with casein kinase 2. Phosphopeptide mapping experiments show that the peptide phosphorylated by casein kinase 2 in vitro is identical to that derived from the protein phosphorylated in vivo. Purification by high performance liquid chromatography and partial sequencing of the phosphopeptide indicate that it corresponds to the region of the protein (residues 56-89) containing the cluster of serine residues. Our results indicate that RAB-17 is phosphorylated by casein kinase 2 or a kinase with a similar specificity and that phosphorylation takes place in the serine cluster region of the protein both in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1505014554,"Apo-cellular retinol-binding protein (apoCRBP) activated the hydrolysis of endogenous retinyl esters in rat liver microsomes by a cholate independent retinyl ester hydrolase. A Michaelis-Menten relationship was observed between the apoCRBP concentration and the rate of retinol formation, with half-maximum stimulation at 2.6 +/- 0.6 microM (mean +/- S.D., n = 5). Two other retinol-binding proteins, bovine serum albumin and beta-lactoglobulin, acceptors for the rapid and spontaneous hydration of retinol from membranes, had no effect up to 90 microM. These data suggest activation of the hydrolase by apoCRBP directly, rather than by facilitating removal of retinol from membranes. The hydrolase responding was the cholate-independent/cholate-inhibited retinyl ester hydrolase as shown by: 60% inhibition of the apoCRBP effect by 3 mM cholate; apoCRBP enhancement of retinyl ester hydrolysis in liver microsomes that had no detectable cholate-enhanced activity; inhibition of cholate-dependent, but not apoCRBP-stimulated retinyl ester hydrolysis by rabbit anti-rat cholesteryl esterase. Compared to the rate (mean +/- S.D. of [n] different preparations) supported by 5 microM apoCRBP in liver microsomes of 6.7 +/- 3.7 pmol/min/mg protein [10], microsomes from rat lung, kidney, and testes had endogenous retinyl ester hydrolysis rates of 1.8 +/- 0.3 [5], 0.5 +/- 0.2 [3], and 0.3 +/- 0.2 [5] pmol/min/mg protein, respectively. N-Ethylmaleimide and N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone were potent inhibitors of apoCRBP-stimulated hydrolysis with IC50 values of 0.25 and 0.15 mM, respectively, but phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and diisopropyl-fluorophosphate were less effective with IC50 values of 1 mM, indicating the importance of imidazole and sulfhydryl groups to the activity. These data provide evidence of a physiological role for the cholate-independent hydrolase in retinoid metabolism and suggest that apoCRBP is a signal for retinyl ester mobilization."
https://openalex.org/W1559153735,"The positively charged quaternary ammonium group of agonists of the nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor binds to a negative subsite at most about 1 nm from a readily reducible disulfide. This disulfide is formed by alpha Cys192 and Cys193 (Kao and Karlin, 1986). In order to identify Asp or Glu residues that may contribute to the negative subsite, we synthesized S-(2-[3H]glycylamidoethyl)dithio-2-pyridine. Purified ACh receptor from Torpedo californica was mildly reduced and reacted with S-(2-[3H]glycylamidoethyl)dithio-2-pyridine. The predominant product was a mixed disulfide between the 3H-N-glycylcysteamine moiety and alpha Cys192 or Cys193. In the extended conformation of [3H] N-glycylcysteamine, the distance from the glycyl amino group to the cysteamine thio group is 0.9 nm. Thus, the amino group of disulfide-linked [3H]N-glycylcysteamine could react with carboxyls within 0.9 nm of Cys192/Cys193. To promote amide bond formation between the tethered amino group and receptor carboxyls, we added 1-ethyl-3-(3'-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide. The predominant sites of amide coupling were on the delta subunit, in CNBr fragment 4 (delta 164-257). This reaction was inhibited by ACh. Only the first 61 residues of delta CNBr 4 are predicted to be extracellular, and there are 11 Asp or Gly residues in this region. One or more of these residues is likely to contribute to the binding of ACh."
https://openalex.org/W1535282352,"The human DNA polymerase alpha catalytic polypeptide has been functionally overexpressed by a recombinant baculovirus in insect cells at greater than 1000-fold higher levels than that found in cultured normal human cells. The recombinant polymerase alpha protein is translated from its natural translation start codon under the control of the baculovirus polyhedron promoter producing a protein of 180 kDa, identical in size to that isolated from cultured human cells. This recombinant polymerase alpha is phosphorylated and reactive to a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed against the native polymerase alpha-primase complex and to polyclonal antisera against N- and C-terminal peptides of the polymerase alpha catalytic polypeptide. The recombinant enzyme was immunopurified from insect cells as a single polypeptide. The single subunit recombinant polymerase alpha has no detectable 3'-5' exonuclease activity. The Km for primer-template and dNTP, reactivity to inhibitors, N2-(p-n-butylphenyl)-dGTP (BuPdGTP) and aphidicolin, thermosensitivity, and DNA synthetic processivity and fidelity of the recombinant polymerase alpha are identical to that observed with the four-subunit polymerase alpha-primase complex immunopurified from cultured human cells. These results strongly suggest that the presence of the other subunits, (the p70 and the two primase subunits, p48 and p58), does not influence kinetic parameters of polymerase alpha catalysis, sensitivity to inhibitors, or DNA synthetic fidelity and processivity."
https://openalex.org/W1493635770,"The mechanisms involved in transcriptional regulation by growth hormone (GH) remain unknown. We report here that GH receptor immunoreactivity can be demonstrated in the nuclei of GH-responsive rat and rabbit tissues at both the light and electron micrograph level using monoclonal antibodies to the receptor extracellular domain. Nuclear staining is heterogeneous and associated with both chromatin and the nuclear membrane. To confirm these observations, nuclei were isolated from rabbit liver by two methods, one involving extensive nonionic detergent washes. Scatchard analysis of nuclear fractions revealed high affinity somatogenic receptor in nuclear membranes, nucleoplasm, and chromatin fractions. A panel of GH receptor monoclonal antibodies was used to further define these nuclear binding sites as being antigenically identical to microsomal receptor in all but one case. In addition, affinity cross-linking experiments showed the somatogenic binding subunit to have a reduced Mr of 67,000, similar to the Mr of the GH binding protein. We propose that the association of a GH binding protein with the nucleus may provide a means whereby GH can regulate the transcription of specific genes either directly or indirectly through nuclear kinase C activation. This speculation is congruent with the recent demonstration of a GH response element by Yoon et al. (Yoon, J. B., Berry, S. A., Seelig, S., and Towle, H. C. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 19947-19954)."
https://openalex.org/W1507703636,"We have prepared antisera to deglycosylated rat intestinal mucin and used it to obtain immunoreactive clones from a rat jejunum cDNA library. Four of these clones were sequenced, and all were found to be partial cDNAs that contained 18-base pair tandem repeats characteristic of a mucin. These cDNAs encoded a repetitive peptide with a consensus sequence of TTTPDV. Thus, they bear little resemblance to either of the two human intestinal mucin cDNAs isolated previously (Gum, J. R., Byrd, J. C., Hicks, J. W., Toribara, N. W., Lamport, D. T. A., and Kim, Y. S. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 6480-6487 and Gum, J. R., Hicks, J. W., Swallow, D. M., Lagace, R. E., Byrd, J. C., Lamport, D. T. A., Siddiki, B., and Kim, Y. S. (1990) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 171, 407-415). One of these rat mucin clones, designated RMUC 176, was chosen for further analysis. This clone recognized a band of approximately 9 kilobases when used to probe RNA blots. A strong hybridization band was present using rat small intestine and colon RNA but was not detectable when RNA isolated from heart, liver, or kidney was tested. The RMUC 176 clone and the two previously isolated human intestinal mucin cDNA clones were used to probe blots prepared from BamHI-digested DNA of various species. Here, the human probes detected fragments present only in human and chimpanzee DNA, whereas the RMUC 176 clone recognized fragments only in rat and mouse DNA. Thus, the repetitive portions of intestinal mucin genes are apparently not well conserved between phylogenetically distant species."
https://openalex.org/W1563637753,"A partially purified protein fraction from the phycocyanin-containing unicellular rhodophyte, Cyanidium caldarium, reductively transforms biliverdin IX alpha to a violet colored bilin in the presence of NADPH, ferredoxin, and ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase. This bilin has a violin-like absorption spectrum with maxima at 335 and 560 nm in methanolic HCl and at 337, 567, and 603-604 nm in CHCl3. The bilin has been determined to be 15,16-dihydrobiliverdin IX alpha by comparative spectrophotometry and 1H NMR spectroscopy. This product of biliverdin IX alpha reduction is converted enzymatically to phycobilins by further reduction. A general biosynthetic pathway is proposed which accounts for the formation of the phycobilins from biliverdin IX alpha by a two-step reduction process followed by isomerization."
https://openalex.org/W1562483682,"Abstract Glucocorticoids are potent anti-inflammatory agents which affect cell growth and migration in a wide variety of systems and have profound effects on monocytes, decreasing their circulating number as well as inhibiting their accumulation at sites of inflammation and injury. Although the mechanisms by which glucocorticoids regulate gene induction have been established, the mechanisms by which they inhibit inflammation or cell growth and migration have yet to been determined. JE is one of the most abundant genes induced by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in vitro and is also induced in vivo in response to ischemia or injury. JE encodes a low molecular weight glycoprotein that functions in part as a monocyte chemotactic factor and thus may be important in recruiting monocytes to sites of tissue injury and/or inflammation. We report that glucocorticoids block the induction of JE mRNA by serum or PDGF in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. The effect of glucocorticoids appears largely due to destabilization of JE mRNA and has specificity for JE, in that other early PDGF-inducible genes are not inhibited by glucocorticoids. The effect of glucocorticoids also occurs in vivo: methyl prednisolone blocks the constitutive expression and inhibits the ischemia-induced elevation of JE mRNA levels in rat kidneys. The inhibition of JE mRNA accumulation by glucocorticoids may be related to the anti-inflammatory effects of these agents and defines JE as a member of what may be a group of PDGF-inducible genes that are responsive to corticosteroids."
https://openalex.org/W1564140172,"Abstract The interaction of pardaxin, a shark-repellent neurotoxin, and its charge-modified analogues with vesicles and human erythrocytes is described. The following six analogues and derivatives were synthesized by a solid phase method: [Glu8, Glu16]pardaxin, [N1-succinamido,Glu8,Glu16]pardaxin, [N1,Lys8,Lys16-triacetyl]pardaxin, des-[1----9]pardaxin (Shai, Y., Bach, D., and Yanovsky, A. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 20202-20209), and des-[1----9] [Glu16]pardaxin. The relative hydrophobic characteristics of the analogues were examined using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The pH-dependent spectroscopic and functional characteristics of the analogues were also investigated at either neutral or acidic pH. Spectroscopic characterization was achieved by measuring circular dichroism both before and after binding to vesicles, at either neutral or acidic pH. The ability of the peptides to dissipate a diffusion potential, to cause calcein release or the pH-dependent release of 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid disodium salt/p-xylene-bis[pyridinium bromide] from sonicated unilamellar liposomes, as well as measurements of cytolytic activity on human erythrocytes, served to functionally characterize the peptides. We show a direct correlation between alpha-helical content, the analogues' hydrophobicity, and their pore-forming properties at the different pH values tested. We also demonstrate that the charge of the N terminus and of the peptide backbone, but not of the C terminus, affects the secondary structure as well as the activities of the analogues. Finally, we show that the cytolytic activity of pardaxin at neutral pH is not retained by any of the analogues."
https://openalex.org/W1555617925,"It has been shown previously that glucose-induced insulin release is completely absent in rat pancreatic islets that had been cultured for 1 day at low glucose (1 mM) and that it is restored by culturing islets for a 2nd day at high (20 mM) glucose (MacDonald, M. J., Fahien, L. A., McKenzie, D. I., and Moran, S. M. (1991) Am. J. Physiol. 259, E548-E554). It has been suggested that the incapacitation of glucose's insulinotropism is due to down-regulation of the synthesis of enzymes that process glucose's metabolic signal for insulin release. In the current study, results of metabolic, enzymic, and molecular biologic experiments were each consistent with (an) intramitochondrial site(s) of down-regulation in islets cultured at low glucose. Glucose metabolism was inhibited 80% in islets cultured at 1 mM glucose. The suppression of release of 14CO2 from [6-14C]glucose greater than from [U-14C]glucose greater than [3,4-14C]glucose greater than from [1-14C]glucose in islets cultured at low glucose indicated a mitochondrial site of down-regulation because C-6 of glucose can only be converted to CO2 in the citric acid cycle, whereas C-1 can be released as CO2 in the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase [corrected] reaction, and C-6 of glucose dwells in the citric acid cycle longer than carbons 2-5 of glucose. Since carbons 3 and 4 of glucose can be decarboxylated in the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction, incomplete suppression of CO2 formation from these carbons is consistent with suppression of pyruvate carboxylation as well as decarboxylation. Formation of 3HOH from [5-3H]glucose was equal in the two groups of islets, indicating that glycolysis as far as phosphoenolpyruvate was intact. This idea was supported by assays which showed that activities of enzymes of the glycolytic pathway between glucokinase/hexokinase and pyruvate kinase were equal in both types of islets. Additional studies indicated that regulation by glucose was at transcription of genes coding for some mitochondrial enzymes. Glucokinase, malic enzyme, and fumarase mRNAs were not affected by glucose, whereas the pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 alpha subunit and pyruvate carboxylase mRNAs were decreased 85-90% in islets cultured at 1 mM glucose. Pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme activity was decreased to a similar extent in these islets. About 24 h was required for maximal (de)induction of pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 alpha and pyruvate carboxylase mRNAs, and the amounts of transcripts were proportional to the concentrations of glucose between 1 and 20 mM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1489921559,"Utilizing an in vitro coupled assay system, we show that isolated plastids from cucumber cotyledons convert the linear tetrapyrrole biliverdin IX alpha to the free phytochrome chromophore, phytochromobilin, which assembles with oat apophytochrome to yield photoactive holoprotein. The spectral properties of this synthetic phytochrome are indistinguishable from those of the natural photoreceptor. The plastid-dependent biliverdin conversion activity is strongly stimulated by both NADPH and ATP. Substitution of the nonnatural XIII alpha isomer of biliverdin for the IX alpha isomer affords a synthetic holophytochrome adduct with blue-shifted difference spectra. These results, together with experiments using boiled plastids, indicate that phytochromobilin synthesis from biliverdin is enzyme-mediated. Experiments where NADPH (and ATP) levels in intact developing chloroplasts are manipulated by feeding the metabolites 3-phosphoglycerate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and glucose 6-phosphate or by illumination with white light, support the hypothesis that the enzyme that accomplishes this conversion, phytochromobilin synthase, is plastid-localized. It is therefore likely that all of the enzymes of the phytochrome chromophore biosynthetic pathway reside in the plastid."
https://openalex.org/W1576465448,"A series of mutant lac repressor proteins at positions 281 or 282 was isolated for detailed characterization. Although Cys281 modification by sulfhydryl reagents abrogates pH effects on inducer binding and diminishes operator binding (Daly, T. J., Olson, J. S., and Matthews, K. S. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 5468-5474), substitution at this site by alanine, serine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, or methionine did not abolish completely the pH shift nor affect operator affinity. Thus, ionization of the sulfhydryl residue does not account fully for the alterations in inducer affinity and cooperativity of binding observed with elevated pH. Substitution for Cys281 did, however, alter the kinetic parameters for inducer association with the protein. The polarity of the side chain at 281 influenced the rates of sugar binding, presumably by altering the rate of opening/closing of the binding site. Furthermore, the presence of the branched side chain of isoleucine at position 281 disrupted oligomerization of the repressor. In contrast to the tolerance for substitution at 281, the only amino acid side chain exchanges for Tyr282 which yielded tetrameric protein with near normal operator binding characteristics were phenylalanine and leucine; this result is consistent with studies of suppressed nonsense mutations at position 282 which indicated repression occurred only for the corresponding substitutions (Kleina, L. G., and Miller, J. H. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 221, 295-318). Despite the tetrameric character of the Y282F mutant protein, the pH dependence and cooperativity of inducer binding for this mutant protein were altered. All amino acid substitutions other than phenylalanine and leucine at this position resulted in either monomeric protein or no detectable repressor in the cell. Thus, the hydrophobic character of the side chain at position 282 is essential for tetramer formation, and the phenyl ring alone alters inducer binding parameters. The monomeric mutant proteins with substitutions for Tyr282 exhibited lower stability than their tetrameric counterparts, and the absence of dimer formation suggests alterations at this site affect both dimer and tetramer interfaces. Based on previous genetic studies and our detailed mutant characterization, the region encompassing 281 and 282, indicated by secondary structure prediction to be a turn or coil, is essential for oligomer formation and additionally exerts a strong influence on the dynamic properties of the protein, presumably mediated by interactions at the subunit interface which regulate the rate of opening and closing of the inducer binding cleft."
https://openalex.org/W1900726947,"An enzyme extract from the phycocyanin-containing unicellular rhodophyte, Cyanidium caldarium, reductively transforms biliverdin IX alpha to phycocyanobilin, the chromophore of phycocyanin, in the presence of NADPH. Unpurified cell extract forms both 3(E)-phycocyanobilin, which is identical to the major pigment that is released from phycocyanin by methanolysis, and 3(Z)-phycocyanobilin, which is obtained as a minor methanolysis product. After removal of low molecular weight material from the cell extract, only 3(Z)-phycocyanobilin is formed. 3(E)-Phycocyanobilin formation from biliverdin IX alpha, and the ability to isomerize 3(Z)-phycocyanobilin to 3(E)-phycocyanobilin, are reconstituted by the addition of glutathione to the incubation mixture. Partially purified protein fractions derived from the initial enzyme extract form 3(Z)-phycocyanobilin plus two additional, violet colored bilins, upon incubation with NADPH and biliverdin IX alpha. Further purified protein fractions produce only the violet colored bilins from biliverdin IX alpha. One of these bilins was identified as 3(Z)-phycoerythrobilin by comparative spectrophotometry, reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and 1H NMR spectroscopy. A C. caldarium protein fraction catalyzes the conversion of 3(Z)-phycoerythrobilin to 3(Z)-phycocyanobilin. This fraction also catalyzes the conversion of 3(E)-phycoerythrobilin to 3(E)-phycocyanobilin. The conversion of phycoerythrobilins to phycocyanobilins requires neither biliverdin nor NADPH. The synthesis of phycoerythrobilin and its conversion to phycocyanobilin by extracts of C. caldarium, a species that does not contain phycoerythrin, indicates that phycoerythrobilin is a biosynthetic precursor to phycocyanobilin. The enzymatic conversion of the ethylidine group from the Z to the E configuration suggests that the E-isomer is the precursor to the protein-bound chromophore."
https://openalex.org/W1592886905,"Structural and functional properties of alpha-protease nexin I (alpha-PNI) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells were studied. All three cysteines were in the reduced form, showing that the potential disulfide bridge between residues Cys117 and Cys131 was not formed. Heparin association rate enhancements were from ka = 8.3 x 10(5) to 0.7-1.6 x 10(9) M-1 s-1 for the interaction of PNI with thrombin, from ka = 5.1 x 10(3) to 3.5 x 10(5) M-1 s-1 for interaction with Factor Xa, and from ka = 2.2 x 10(6) to 1.0 x 10(7) M-1 s-1 for interaction with trypsin; there was no rate enhancement of the plasmin interaction (ka = 1.0 x 10(5) M-1 s-1). The minimal heparin pentasaccharide had no effect on these interactions. Cleavage of the reactive center loop of PNI by three different proteases gave the typical stressed to relaxed change in thermal stability, but unlike with antithrombin III, there was no loss of heparin affinity. A similar difference from antithrombin was that PNI-thrombin complexes retained normal heparin affinity. These results are compatible with a role for protease nexin I as a cell-associated thrombin inhibitor that remains bound to the cell surface even after complexing with the protease, as compared with the role of antithrombin III as a circulating inhibitor of thrombin that becomes activated on binding to the microvasculature and is released on complex formation."
https://openalex.org/W1559417307,"Creatine kinase enzymes are present in tissues such as muscle and brain to interconvert creatine phosphate and ADP, thus providing a system to interconnect energy production and utilization (Bessman, S. P., and Carpenter, C. L. (1985) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 54, 831-862). Creatine kinase isoenzymes in kidney have received little attention since kidney contains relatively low creatine kinase activity compared with muscle and brain and because there is disagreement regarding the identity of the specific isoforms expressed in kidney. Using a combination of chromatographic and immunological techniques, we have identified two isoforms of creatine kinase in rat kidney supernatants, B creatine kinase, and the non-sarcomeric form of the mitochondrial creatine kinase, which represent 82 and 15%, respectively, of the total creatine kinase activity in this tissue. The identity of the non-muscle form of the mitochondrial creatine kinase was confirmed by N-terminal sequence analysis and compared with recently published cDNA sequences (Haas, R. C., and Strauss, A. W. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 6921-6927). We prepared multiple antisera specific for each isoform using synthetic peptide immunogens based upon nonhomologous regions from the primary sequence of each creatine kinase isoform. Immunocytochemical results demonstrate that both creatine kinase isoforms are colocalized in the inner stripe of the outer medulla in tubules of the distal nephron. A similar distribution of creatine kinase isoforms was obtained when different layers of the renal cortex and medulla were examined for creatine kinase activity and isozyme content using nondenaturing electrophoresis. In general, the distribution of creatine kinase enzymes in kidney corresponds to the regions of greatest ATP utilization, oxygen consumption, and sodium transport. These results suggest a role for creatine kinase enzymes in the coupling of ion transport and oxidative phosphorylation in the distal nephron of the mammalian kidney."
https://openalex.org/W1600062048,"Rap1A is a Ras-related GTP binding protein which has an amino acid sequence identical to that of Ras in the putative domain (amino acids 32-40). The binding of Rap1A to Ras-GTPase activating protein (GAP) through this domain is a potential mechanism for explaining the observation that Rap1A can antagonize the ability of oncogenic Ras to transform cells. It was recently shown (Yatani, A., Okabe, K., Polakis, P., Halenbeck, R., McCormick, F., and Brown, A. M. (1990) Cell 61, 769-776) that the activation of M2-muscarinic receptor-coupled K+ channels in heart is inhibited by the addition of exogenous Ras and Ras-GAP. We have made use of this system in the present paper to show that Rap1A is able to effectively block this inhibitory action of Ras-GAP. We observed that both Rap1A-GDP and Rap1A-guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) were able to block the inhibitory effect of Ras-GAP upon channel activation. This effect occurred at picomolar concentrations of Rap1A, and the GTP gamma S-bound form of the protein was consistently found to be more potent than the GDP form. A Rap1A Thr35----Ala mutation which bound GTP gamma S did not prevent K+ channel inhibition by Ras-GAP, suggesting that the antagonism by wild type Rap1A involves an interaction with GAP in the effector domain. The effectiveness of Rap1A to inhibit Ras-GAP is dependent upon the amount of Ras-GAP present in the assay and can also be overcome by the addition of GTP-bound N-Ras (GC-43), suggesting a competitive mechanism is operative. Finally, a truncated form of Ras-GAP (GAP32) which is no longer dependent upon Ras for inhibition of the M2-activated K+ channel is also no longer sensitive to blockade by added Rap1A. These data support the concept of GAP as an effector of Ras action and indicate that Rap1A can serve as an inhibitor of Ras action in a system distinct from cell transformation by a competitive mechanism involving the GAP binding domain of Rap1A."
https://openalex.org/W2120223121,"An incubation of rat adipocytes with phenylarsine oxide (PAO) and then with insulin caused an inhibition of 3-O-methylglucose equilibrium exchange flux and a parallel reduction in cellular GLUT4 content detected by Western blots. Both the transport inhibition and the GLUT4 reduction were saturable with an increasing concentration of PAO showing essentially an identical Ki value of 35 microM. Both effects were not observed in the absence of insulin or if cells were incubated with insulin first. The reduction was specific to GLUT4; the immunoreactivities of GLUT1, insulin receptor, and clathrin were not affected in these experiments. The GLUT4 reduction occurred only in intact cells and was not observed in homogenized cells or fractionated membranes. GLUT4 in both the microsomal storage pool and the plasma membrane pool were affected with no indication of insulin-induced recruitment impairment. GLUT4 reduction was not observed in the presence of chloroquine or at 18 degrees C suggesting involvement of the lysosomal pathway. Based on these results, we propose that there is a PAO-sensitive protein mechanism that controls an insulin-dependent GLUT4 degradation pathway in adipocytes. This protein mechanism and the GLUT4 degradation pathway may play an important role in determining the steady-state GLUT4 level in the insulin-sensitive peripheral tissues in normal and diseased states."
https://openalex.org/W203815947,"Two receptor proteins that specifically bind interleukin-2 (IL-2) have been identified previously. The L (Tac or alpha) chain can bind IL-2 with a Kd value of 10 nM (low affinity). Although the H (beta) chain expressed on lymphocytes can bind IL-2 with a Kd value of 1 nM (intermediate affinity), transfected fibroblasts expressing the H chain cannot bind IL-2, suggesting the involvement of other lymphocyte-specific factors for the function of the H chain. To obtain direct evidence for the presence of a third component of the IL-2 receptor, we examined the IL-2 binding activity of detergent-solubilized cell membrane preparations. We found that lysates of transfected Cos7 cells expressing H chains can bind IL-2 when mixed with lysates from lymphocytes that cannot bind IL-2. Chemical cross-linking of 125I-IL-2-bound lysate mixture and subsequent immunoprecipitation with a noncompetitive anti-H chain antibody gave rise to two 125I-IL-2-bound proteins, a 56-kDa protein (p56) and the H chain, although neither the H chain nor p56 alone is able to bind IL-2. These results indicate that p56 is the IL-2 receptor third chain that is required for IL-2 binding to the H chain. A similar lysate mixing experiment also showed that p56 is involved in IL-2 binding to the high affinity IL-2 receptor by forming the quaternary complex of IL-2, p56, L chain, and H chain."
https://openalex.org/W2105386815,"We have investigated the role that proteolytic enzymes in Aplysia hemolymph play in the inactivation of the neurotransmitter alpha-bag cell peptide (alpha-BCP(1-9), Ala-Pro-Arg-Leu-Arg-Phe-Tyr-Ser-Leu). alpha-BCP fragments containing Pro in positions 1 or 2, or Tyr in position 1, were degraded relatively slowly (half-life, t1/2 = 10-64 min), whereas fragments lacking these residues were degraded relatively rapidly (t1/2 = 0.5-2.7 min). Of 12 peptidase inhibitors tested, only bestatin, amastatin, and phenanthroline significantly inhibited alpha-BCP(3-9) degradation. alpha-BCP(3-9) yielded only four observable cleavage products (in order of decreasing abundance at early time points): alpha-BCP(4-9), alpha-BCP(5-9), alpha-BCP(6-9), and alpha-BCP(7-9). Degradation of alpha-BCP(3-9), alpha-BCP(4-9), alpha-BCP(5-9), alpha-BCP(6-9), or alpha-BCP(7-9) was strongly inhibited by bestatin, moderately inhibited by amastatin, and not inhibited by arphramenine B. The rates of degradation of eight alpha-BCP fragments and three other peptides in plasma were well correlated with their rates of degradation in mammalian leucine aminopeptidase (LAP, EC 3.4.11.1). Collectively our data support the following ideas. 1) In hemolymph one or more LAP-like enzymes rapidly and sequentially cleave alpha-BCP(3-9) or other small peptides lacking Pro at positions 1 or 2 or Tyr at position 1. 2) LAP-like peptidases in hemolymph may act in concert with previously described ganglionic peptidases to degrade neurally released alpha-BCP(1-9) and alpha-BCP(1-8) into inactive fragments."
https://openalex.org/W1527065904,"Abstract We have shown that accurate initiation of productive RNA synthesis in vitro at the adenovirus 2 major late promoter is accompanied by abortive initiation of very short transcripts (Luse, D. S., and Jacob, G. A. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 14990-14997). We made a set of sequence variants of this promoter, using every possible base at position -28 (in the TATA box) in the context of either the normal base (A) or a T at position +1 on the nontemplate strand. All changes from wild type reduced promoter strength. The two weakest promoters were 10- and 30-fold less active than wild type in productive RNA synthesis. We tested the possibility that the down mutations also caused an increase in the proportion of in vitro initiations which are abortive. This effect was seen only with the two weakest members of the promoter set. For these promoters, which share an A----C change at the -28 position of the TATA box, the ratio of abortive to productive initiations was 3-4-fold higher than for the other promoters. Interestingly, the sequence change at +1, although a down mutation, did not lead to an increase in abortive initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1579655667,"Two regulatory regions in the murine collagen IV enhancer were identified. Transient transfection assays delimited a 210-base pair fragment within the first intron of the alpha 1(IV) collagen gene that had significant transcriptional enhancer activity. DNase I protection and gel mobility shift confirmed that two regions, designated footprints A and B, within this fragment bound nuclear factors. Gel shift studies suggested that the CCTTATCTCTGATGG motif (A-34) in the footprint A region was important for specific nuclear factor binding. Mutations in the A-34 motif abolished factor binding as detected by gel shift and resulted in a significant decrease in enhancer activity in transient transfection assays of F9 teratocarcinoma cells. Two putative transcription factors of Mr = 37,000 and Mr = 94,000, which interact with the A-34 motif, were purified from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor tissue using DEAE-Sephacel, heparin-Sepharose, salmon sperm DNA-Sepharose, and specific A-34 oligonucleotide affinity chromatography. Southwestern analysis revealed that both of these factors were capable of binding the A-34 oligonucleotide directly and did not require additional subunits for binding. These data suggest that positively acting transcription factor(s) interact with the A-34 site in the enhancer and are required for efficient transcription of the alpha 1 and alpha 2(IV) collagen chain genes."
https://openalex.org/W1548899875,"A proband with lethal osteogenesis imperfecta has been investigated for the causative defect at the levels of collagen protein, mRNA, and DNA. Analysis of type I collagen synthesized by the proband's fibroblasts showed excessive post-translational modification of alpha 1(I) chains along the entire length of the helix. Oververmodification of alpha chains could be prevented by incubation of the cells at 30 rather than 37 degrees C, and the thermal stability of the triple helix, as determined by protease digestion, was normal. RNase A cleavage of RNA:RNA hybrids formed between the proband's mRNA and antisense RNA derived from normal pro-alpha 1(I) chain cDNA clones was used to locate an abnormality to exon 43 of the proband's pro-alpha 1(I) collagen gene (COL1A1). The nucleotide sequence of the corresponding gene region showed, in one allele, the deletion of 9 base pairs, not present in either parent, within a repeating sequence of exon 43. The mutation causes the loss of one of three consecutive Gly-Ala-Pro triplets at positions 868-876, but does not otherwise disrupt the Gly-X-Y sequence. Procollagen processing in fibroblast cultures and susceptibility of the mutant collagen I to cleavage with vertebrate collagenase were normal, indicating that the slippage of collagen chains by one Gly-X-Y triplet does not abolish amino-propeptidase and collagenase cleavage sites. How the mutation produces the lethal osteogenesis imperfecta phenotype is not entirely clear; the data suggest that the interaction of alpha chains immediately prior to helix formation may be affected."
https://openalex.org/W1929834130,"The clostridial glycine reductase complex catalyzes the reductive deamination of glycine in an energy-conserving process that results in the esterification of orthophosphate. The complex consists of three protein components: selenoprotein A; protein B, a carbonyl group protein; and protein C, a sulfhydryl protein. The protein C component also catalyzes the arsenate-dependent decomposition of acetyl phosphate. Reaction of protein C with iodoacetate inhibits its ability to decompose acetyl phosphate, but this inactivation of the enzyme by alkylation is prevented in the presence of the substrate indicating the formation of an unreactive enzyme-bound acetylthiol ester. The Se-carboxy-methylselenocysteine residue of the selenoprotein A component of glycine reductase was generated by selective alkylation of the ionized selenol group at pH 6 with [14C]bromoacetate. Using this pure alkylated selenoprotein A as substrate, it was shown that protein C catalyzes the conversion of the [14C]carboxymethyl group, in selenoether linkage to protein A, to [14C]acetate in the presence of arsenate, dithiothreitol, and Mg2+. A procedure using hydrophobic chromatographic matrices was developed for the large scale isolation of protein C, and a number of the properties of the enzyme were determined."
https://openalex.org/W1505094749,"Brain pyridoxine-5-P oxidase is activated by the tryptophan metabolites 3-hydroxyanthranilate and 3-hydroxykynurenine. 3-Hydroxyanthranilate at concentrations of 0.03 mM relieves the inhibition elicited by accumulation of the substrate pyridoxine-5-P (Ki = 60 microM). The results of fluorometric measurements indicate that four molecules of 3-hydroxyanthranilate bind to the dimeric enzyme (56 kDa) with an association constant of 5.5 x 10(4) M-1. Differential spectral measurements failed to detect any direct interaction between the cofactor FMN and the effector 3-hydroxyanthranilate. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the effector molecules bind to sites of the dimeric protein distinct from the cofactor site. Limited chymotrypsin digestion of pyridoxine-5-P oxidase yields catalytically active species that are no longer susceptible to activation by 3-hydroxykynurenine. A polypeptide of 16 kDa containing FMN and endowed with full catalytic activity was isolated by ion-exchange chromatography. It is postulated that the structural domain associated with catalytic activity composes approximately one-half of the molecular mass of pyridoxine-5-P oxidase (28 kDa), whereas the remaining portion of the macromolecule contains regulatory binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W185828536,"Monoclonal antibodies against Escherichia coli ribosomal proteins L9 and L10 were obtained and their specificity confirmed by Western blot analysis of total ribosomal protein. This was particularly important for the L9 antibody, since the immunizing antigen mixture contained predominantly L11. Each antibody recognized both 70 S ribosomes and 50 S subunits. Affinity-purified antibodies were tested for their effect on in vitro assays of ribosome function. Anti-L10 and anti-L9 inhibited poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis almost completely. The antibodies had no effect on subunit association or dissociation and neither antibody inhibited peptidyltransferase activity. Both antibodies inhibited the binding of the ternary complex that consisted of aminoacyl-tRNA, guanylyl beta, gamma-methylenediphosphonate, and elongation factor Tu, and the binding of elongation factor G to the ribosome. The intact antibodies were more potent inhibitors than the Fab fragments. In contrast to the previously established location of L10 at the base of the L7/L12 stalk near the factor-binding site, the site of anti-L9 binding to 50 S subunits was shown by immune electron microscopy to be on the L1 lateral protuberance opposite the L7/L12 stalk as viewed in the quasisymmetric projection. The inhibition of factor binding by both antibodies, although consistent with established properties of L10 in the ribosome, suggests a long range effect on subunit structure that is triggered by the binding of anti-L9."
https://openalex.org/W1537491690,"Although alveolar surfactant is rapidly catabolized in adult rabbit lungs, the pathways have not been characterized. Pathways of surfactant secretion and recycling involve lamellar bodies and multivesicular bodies, organelles shown to be related to lysosomes by cytochemistry and autoradiography. Since lysosomes are central to intracellular catabolic events, it is possible that lysosomes are involved in intrapulmonary surfactant catabolism. Lysosomes relatively free of contaminating organelles (as determined morphologically and by marker enzymes for mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes, and plasma membranes) were obtained from post-lavage lung homogenates of 1-kg rabbits by differential centrifugation in buffered sucrose and gradient separation in percoll (density, 1.075-1.165). The role of lung lysosomes in catabolism of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPC) was then studied in rabbits killed 4, 12, and 24 h following intratracheal injection of [3H]DPC and [14C] dihexadecyl phosphatidylcholine (DPC-ether). While equal amounts of label were in the lamellar body containing fractions at 4 h, nearly 6-fold more DPC-ether label than DPC label was recovered in the lysosomal fractions. By 24 h, there was 15-fold more DPC-ether in the lysosomes. This is the first report of successful isolation of lysosomes relatively free of other organelles from rabbit lungs. The tracer studies indicate DPC and DPC-ether follow similar intracellular processing after alveolar uptake. The subsequent accumulation of the ether analog in the lysosomal fractions supports a role for these organelles in surfactant DPC catabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1555994564,"Cell cytosol preparations from mitotic HeLa cells exhibit a kinase activity that phosphorylates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). This MLCK kinase activity is apparently distinct from the known MLCK kinases, including cAMP-dependent protein kinase, cGMP-dependent protein kinase, Ca(2+)-activated phospholipid-dependent protein kinase, or Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, based on the following criteria. First, the MLCK kinase activity of mitotic cells does not respond to a variety of characteristic activators or inhibitors of these known kinases. Second, one- and two-dimensional peptide maps have revealed that the site of phosphorylation by the MLCK kinase of mitotic cells differs from those by these known kinases. The mitotic MLCK kinase phosphorylates MLCK at a threonine residue at a ratio of up to 1 mol of phosphate/mol of chicken gizzard MLCK. The MLCK kinase is mitosis-specific because mitotic cell extracts show much higher phosphorylation activity than nonmitotic cell extracts."
https://openalex.org/W1560735166,"Effects of dantrolene, a blocker of intracellular Ca2+ release, on the oscillation of the intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) induced by caffeine were studied in bullfrog sympathetic ganglion cells, using a Fura-2 fluorescence technique. Dantrolene blocked the Ca2+ oscillation only in the cell illuminated by ultraviolet light (335-385 nm). Likewise, the blocking effects on rhythmic Ca(2+)-dependent hyperpolarizations, representing Ca2+ oscillations via activation of Ca(2+)-dependent K+ channel, occurred only under the illumination with ultraviolet light (335-385 nm), but not with visible light (404-417 nm). This wavelength dependence differs from the absorbance spectrum of dantrolene. On the other hand, dantrolene preirradiated with ultraviolet light under dark condition or ultraviolet light itself did not affect the [Ca2+]i oscillation. The blocking action was not prevented by the pretreatment of the cells with reducing agents. These results indicate that illumination of the Ca2+ release channel or dantrolene itself with ultraviolet light (possibly the former) is necessary for the drug to exert its blocking effect. Furthermore, dantrolene was found to decrease Fura-2 fluorescence and to increase cell autofluorescence, leading sometimes to a false decrease in the basal [Ca2+]i."
https://openalex.org/W1562382413,"Neoplastic mouse lung epithelial cells express greatly diminished activity, protein, and mRNA for the type I isozyme of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA I). To address the mechanism of this decrease, the turnover rate of PKA subunit mRNA was examined. Northern blot analysis of PKA mRNAs from transcriptionally inhibited cells indicated that these messages exhibit different stabilities and that they are more stable in neoplastic E9 cells than in normal C10 cells. This suggests that the mechanism of decreased PKA I mRNA in E9 cells resides at the level of transcription. To examine whether this was due to an altered responsiveness to agents which regulate PKA transcription, PKA levels were experimentally manipulated in C10 and E9 cells by long-term treatment with forskolin or 8-chloro-cAMP. PKA activity and the concentration of RI (regulatory subunit of PKA I) and C (catalytic subunit) are coordinately regulated in both cell lines, but this does not reflect the changes in PKA I subunit mRNAs. RI alpha mRNA is specifically induced by forskolin in normal C10 cells, but not in E9 cells. C alpha mRNA is forskolin-inducible in E9 cells, but this enhanced level of expression does not approach that found constitutively in C10 cells. Thus, while C10 and E9 undergo similar changes in PKA I protein subunits following these treatments, a differential modulation of their PKA I mRNA occurs. These cell-specific mRNA responses to cAMP-mediated induction suggest that the mechanism of the decreased constitutive concentration of PKA I in E9 cells involves altered regulation of PKA I mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1492240879,"A nuclear receptor likely involved in nuclear protein import is described. Purified ATP-depleted yeast nuclei show saturable high-affinity binding of the yeast nuclear protein Mcm1. The dissociation constant for the binding is 0.5 microM, and the number of binding sites is approximately 3,500 per nucleus, equivalent to 10-30 binding sites per nuclear pore. Mcm1 competes with other yeast nuclear proteins Ste12 and Swi5, but not with Rap1 or Nop1, indicating that there may be different types of import receptors. Bound Mcm1 is resistant to extraction by nucleases, salt, and non-ionic detergent, but can be released by 5 M urea, suggesting that Mcm1 binds to a yeast equivalent of the nuclear pore complex-lamina fraction of higher eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1531225659,"The phenacylimidazolium compound LY177507 was shown by Harris et al. (Harris, R. A., Yamanuchi, K., Roach, P. J., Yen, T. T., Dominiani, S. J., and Stephens, T. W. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 14674-14680) to stimulate glycogen synthesis greatly in isolated rat hepatocytes. We extended studies with this compound, designated proglycosyn (Yamaguchi, K., Stephens, T. W., Chikadar, K., Depaoli-Roach, A., And Harris, R. A. (1991) Diabetes 40, (Suppl. 1) 102 (abstr.] employing hepatocytes from normal and streptozotocin diabetic rats. Proglycosyn is more effective than amino acids in stimulating glycogen synthesis. In cells incubated with glucose, lactate, or dihydroxyacetone the effect of glutamine and proglycosyn was synergistic. In cells incubated with glucose plus lactate, or glucose plus dihydroxyacetone, the stimulation by the two agonists was additive. Proglycosyn diverted the gluconeogenic flux from glucose to glycogen. The maximal rates of glycogen deposition attained in the presence of glutamine and proglycosyn from cells incubated with glucose plus lactate, or glucose plus dihydroxyacetone, where about 80 and 110 mumols/h/g of liver, respectively. Proglycosyn depressed glycogenolysis in hepatocytes of fed rats and stimulated glycogen synthesis from lactate and dihydroxyacetone. The incorporation of [U-14C]glucose and [U-14C]lactate in these cells occurred in the presence of glycogen breakdown or exceeded net production, indicating the occurrence of recycling of glycogen in hepatocytes of fed rats. Hepatocytes from fasted streptozotocin diabetic rats contained high levels of glycogen. Glycogenolysis was markedly depressed by proglycosyn. Glycogen synthesis from lactate and dihydroxyacetone in these cells was stimulated by glutamine and proglycosyn in a fashion similar to that in cells from fasted control rats, and the rates of glycogen synthesis were similar in cells of control and diabetic rats. With glucose as sole substrate, glutamine did not stimulate glycogen synthesis. When both agonists were present, there was a marked synergism and substantial glycogen formation. Streptozotocin diabetic rats prior to the onset of cachexia have a normal capacity for glycogen synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1571855865,"lambda Cro repressor protein is titrated with two half-operator DNA duplexes comprising the right and left halves of the major binding site on phage lambda DNA, the OR3 operator. The comparison of binding strengths and the conformation of Cro repressor in the two protein-DNA complexes shows that base pair differences between the two halves of the OR3 operator affect the binding of Cro repressor protein. Some 1H NMR resonances are assigned for both protein and DNA in the Cro-operator DNA complexes which are then used to highlight differences between Cro right half and Cro left half protein-operator DNA interactions. These differences are compared to the asymmetry found in the lambda C1 repressor-operator DNA complex. Mechanisms for the recognition of the Cro transcriptional regulatory protein have considered only interactions between a single Cro monomer and a consensus half-operator site with the assumption that the interactions in the remaining half-site are related by the 2-fold symmetry of the complex. A revised model is suggested that allows asymmetry in the two halves of the protein-DNA complex. Methods are proposed to avoid problems in the general use of 1H NMR spectroscopy to study protein-DNA interaction such as intermediate exchange behavior and sample aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W1530200482,"Previous studies on the chlorination reaction catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase using chlorite as the source of chlorine detected the formation of a chlorinating intermediate that was termed Compound X (Shahangian, S., and Hager, L.P. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 11529-11533). These studies indicated that at pH 10.7, the optical absorption spectrum of Compound X was similar to the spectrum of horseradish peroxidase Compound II. Compound X was shown to be quite stable at alkaline pH values. This study was undertaken to examine the relationship between the oxidation state of the iron protoporphyrin IX heme prosthetic group in Compound X and the chemistry of the halogenating intermediate. The experimental results show that the optical absorption properties and the oxidation state of the heme prosthetic group in horseradish peroxidase are not directly related to the presence of the activated chlorine atom in the intermediate. The oxyferryl porphyrin heme group in alkaline Compound X can be reduced to a ferric heme species that still retains the activated chlorine atom. Furthermore, the reaction of chlorite with horseradish peroxidase at acidic pH leads to the secondary formation of a green intermediate that has the spectral properties of horseradish peroxidase Compound I (Theorell, H. (1941) Enzymologia 10, 250-252). The green intermediate also retains the activated chlorine atom. By analogy to peroxidase Compound I chemistry, the heme prosthetic group in the green chlorinating intermediate must be an oxyferryl porphyrin pi-cation radical species (Roberts, J. E., Hoffman, B. M., Rutter, R. J., and Hager, L. P. (1981) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 103, 7654-7656). To be consistent with traditional peroxidase nomenclature, the red alkaline form of Compound X has been renamed Compound XII, and the green acidic form has been named Compound XI. The transfer of chlorine from the chlorinating intermediate to an acceptor molecule follows an electrophilic (rather than a free radical) path. A mechanism for the reaction is proposed in which the activated chlorine atom is bonded to a heteroatom on an active-site amino acid side chain. Transient state kinetic studies show that the initial intermediate, Compound XII, is formed in a very fast reaction. The second-order rate constant for the formation of Compound XII is approximately 1.1 x 10(7) M-1 s-1. The rate of formation of Compound XII is strongly pH-dependent. At pH 9, the second-order rate constant for the formation of Compound XII drops to 1.5 M-1 s-1. At acidic pH values, Compound XII undergoes a spontaneous first-order decay to yield Compound XI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
