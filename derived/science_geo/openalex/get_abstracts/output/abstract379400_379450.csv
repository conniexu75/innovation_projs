https://openalex.org/W2089584121,"Human crowd motion is mainly driven by self-organized processes based on local interactions among pedestrians. While most studies of crowd behaviour consider only interactions among isolated individuals, it turns out that up to 70% of people in a crowd are actually moving in groups, such as friends, couples, or families walking together. These groups constitute medium-scale aggregated structures and their impact on crowd dynamics is still largely unknown. In this work, we analyze the motion of approximately 1500 pedestrian groups under natural condition, and show that social interactions among group members generate typical group walking patterns that influence crowd dynamics. At low density, group members tend to walk side by side, forming a line perpendicular to the walking direction. As the density increases, however, the linear walking formation is bent forward, turning it into a V-like pattern. These spatial patterns can be well described by a model based on social communication between group members. We show that the V-like walking pattern facilitates social interactions within the group, but reduces the flow because of its ""non-aerodynamic"" shape. Therefore, when crowd density increases, the group organization results from a trade-off between walking faster and facilitating social exchange. These insights demonstrate that crowd dynamics is not only determined by physical constraints induced by other pedestrians and the environment, but also significantly by communicative, social interactions among individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2165019590,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant public health problem, and recent genetic studies have identified common CKD susceptibility variants. The CKDGen consortium performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association data in 67,093 individuals of European ancestry from 20 predominantly population-based studies in order to identify new susceptibility loci for reduced renal function as estimated by serum creatinine (eGFRcrea), serum cystatin c (eGFRcys) and CKD (eGFRcrea < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2); n = 5,807 individuals with CKD (cases)). Follow-up of the 23 new genome-wide-significant loci (P < 5 x 10(-8)) in 22,982 replication samples identified 13 new loci affecting renal function and CKD (in or near LASS2, GCKR, ALMS1, TFDP2, DAB2, SLC34A1, VEGFA, PRKAG2, PIP5K1B, ATXN2, DACH1, UBE2Q2 and SLC7A9) and 7 loci suspected to affect creatinine production and secretion (CPS1, SLC22A2, TMEM60, WDR37, SLC6A13, WDR72 and BCAS3). These results further our understanding of the biologic mechanisms of kidney function by identifying loci that potentially influence nephrogenesis, podocyte function, angiogenesis, solute transport and metabolic functions of the kidney."
https://openalex.org/W2160161568,"Outbreaks of hospital infections caused by multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strains are of increasing concern worldwide. Although it has been reported that particular outbreak strains are geographically widespread, little is known about the diversity and phylogenetic relatedness of A. baumannii clonal groups. Sequencing of internal portions of seven housekeeping genes (total 2,976 nt) was performed in 154 A. baumannii strains covering the breadth of known diversity and including representatives of previously recognized international clones, and in 19 representatives of other Acinetobacter species. Restricted amounts of diversity and a star-like phylogeny reveal that A. baumannii is a genetically compact species that suffered a severe bottleneck in the recent past, possibly linked to a restricted ecological niche. A. baumannii is neatly demarcated from its closest relative (genomic species 13TU) and other Acinetobacter species. Multilocus sequence typing analysis demonstrated that the previously recognized international clones I to III correspond to three clonal complexes, each made of a central, predominant genotype and few single locus variants, a hallmark of recent clonal expansion. Whereas antimicrobial resistance was almost universal among isolates of these and a novel international clone (ST15), isolates of the other genotypes were mostly susceptible. This dichotomy indicates that antimicrobial resistance is a major selective advantage that drives the ongoing rapid clonal expansion of these highly problematic agents of nosocomial infections."
https://openalex.org/W2067637071,"Inflammatory pain, such as arthritis pain, is a growing health problem. Inflammatory pain is generally treated with opioids and cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, but both are limited by side effects. Recently, resolvins, a unique family of lipid mediators, including RvE1 and RvD1 derived from omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, have shown marked potency in treating disease conditions associated with inflammation. Here we report that peripheral (intraplantar) or spinal (intrathecal) administration of RvE1 or RvD1 in mice potently reduces inflammatory pain behaviors induced by intraplantar injection of formalin, carrageenan or complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), without affecting basal pain perception. Intrathecal RvE1 injection also inhibits spontaneous pain and heat and mechanical hypersensitivity evoked by intrathecal capsaicin and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). RvE1 has anti-inflammatory activity by reducing neutrophil infiltration, paw edema and proinflammatory cytokine expression. RvE1 also abolishes transient receptor potential vanilloid subtype-1 (TRPV1)- and TNF-alpha-induced excitatory postsynaptic current increases and TNF-alpha-evoked N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor hyperactivity in spinal dorsal horn neurons via inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. Thus, we show a previously unknown role for resolvins in normalizing the spinal synaptic plasticity that has been implicated in generating pain hypersensitivity. Given the potency of resolvins and the well-known side effects of opioids and COX inhibitors, resolvins may represent new analgesics for treating inflammatory pain."
https://openalex.org/W2018443796,"The hypothesis of a Hierarchy of the Sciences with physical sciences at the top, social sciences at the bottom, and biological sciences in-between is nearly 200 years old. This order is intuitive and reflected in many features of academic life, but whether it reflects the ""hardness"" of scientific research--i.e., the extent to which research questions and results are determined by data and theories as opposed to non-cognitive factors--is controversial. This study analysed 2434 papers published in all disciplines and that declared to have tested a hypothesis. It was determined how many papers reported a ""positive"" (full or partial) or ""negative"" support for the tested hypothesis. If the hierarchy hypothesis is correct, then researchers in ""softer"" sciences should have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases, and therefore report more positive outcomes. Results confirmed the predictions at all levels considered: discipline, domain and methodology broadly defined. Controlling for observed differences between pure and applied disciplines, and between papers testing one or several hypotheses, the odds of reporting a positive result were around 5 times higher among papers in the disciplines of Psychology and Psychiatry and Economics and Business compared to Space Science, 2.3 times higher in the domain of social sciences compared to the physical sciences, and 3.4 times higher in studies applying behavioural and social methodologies on people compared to physical and chemical studies on non-biological material. In all comparisons, biological studies had intermediate values. These results suggest that the nature of hypotheses tested and the logical and methodological rigour employed to test them vary systematically across disciplines and fields, depending on the complexity of the subject matter and possibly other factors (e.g., a field's level of historical and/or intellectual development). On the other hand, these results support the scientific status of the social sciences against claims that they are completely subjective, by showing that, when they adopt a scientific approach to discovery, they differ from the natural sciences only by a matter of degree."
https://openalex.org/W2054556550,"Loss-of-function mutations in the PINK1 or parkin genes result in recessive heritable forms of parkinsonism. Genetic studies of Drosophila orthologs of PINK1 and parkin indicate that PINK1, a mitochondrially targeted serine/threonine kinase, acts upstream of Parkin, a cytosolic ubiquitin-protein ligase, to promote mitochondrial fragmentation, although the molecular mechanisms by which the PINK1/Parkin pathway promotes mitochondrial fragmentation are unknown. We tested the hypothesis that PINK1 and Parkin promote mitochondrial fragmentation by targeting core components of the mitochondrial morphogenesis machinery for ubiquitination. We report that the steady-state abundance of the mitochondrial fusion-promoting factor Mitofusin (dMfn) is inversely correlated with the activity of PINK1 and Parkin in Drosophila. We further report that dMfn is ubiquitinated in a PINK1- and Parkin-dependent fashion and that dMfn co-immunoprecipitates with Parkin. By contrast, perturbations of PINK1 or Parkin did not influence the steady-state abundance of the mitochondrial fission-promoting factor Drp1 or the mitochondrial fusion-promoting factor Opa1, or the subcellular distribution of Drp1. Our findings suggest that dMfn is a direct substrate of the PINK1/Parkin pathway and that the mitochondrial morphological alterations and tissue degeneration phenotypes that derive from mutations in PINK1 and parkin result at least in part from reduced ubiquitin-mediated turnover of dMfn."
https://openalex.org/W2116107710,"Timothy Radstake and Maureen Mayes and colleagues report results of a genome-wide association study of systemic sclerosis. They identify a new susceptibility locus at CD247. Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis of the skin and internal organs that leads to profound disability and premature death. To identify new SSc susceptibility loci, we conducted the first genome-wide association study in a population of European ancestry including a total of 2,296 individuals with SSc and 5,171 controls. Analysis of 279,621 autosomal SNPs followed by replication testing in an independent case-control set of European ancestry (2,753 individuals with SSc (cases) and 4,569 controls) identified a new susceptibility locus for systemic sclerosis at CD247 (1q22–23, rs2056626, P = 2.09 × 10−7 in the discovery samples, P = 3.39 × 10−9 in the combined analysis). Additionally, we confirm and firmly establish the role of the MHC (P = 2.31 × 10−18), IRF5 (P = 1.86 × 10−13) and STAT4 (P = 3.37 × 10−9) gene regions as SSc genetic risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2117362890,"John Chambers and colleagues identify common variants at four loci associated with serum creatinine levels, a marker of kidney function. Their findings provide insight into the pathways underlying susceptibility to chronic kidney disease. Using genome-wide association, we identify common variants at 2p12–p13, 6q26, 17q23 and 19q13 associated with serum creatinine, a marker of kidney function (P = 10−10 to 10−15). Of these, rs10206899 (near NAT8, 2p12–p13) and rs4805834 (near SLC7A9, 19q13) were also associated with chronic kidney disease (P = 5.0 × 10−5 and P = 3.6 × 10−4, respectively). Our findings provide insight into metabolic, solute and drug-transport pathways underlying susceptibility to chronic kidney disease."
https://openalex.org/W2097985410,"NMR-measured order parameters of methyl groups can be used to quantitate the entropy of protein conformational change associated with calmodulin-peptide ligand interactions. This conformational entropy is a major contributor to the affinity of calmodulin interactions. The physical basis for high-affinity interactions involving proteins is complex and potentially involves a range of energetic contributions. Among these are changes in protein conformational entropy, which cannot yet be reliably computed from molecular structures. We have recently used changes in conformational dynamics as a proxy for changes in conformational entropy of calmodulin upon association with domains from regulated proteins. The apparent change in conformational entropy was linearly related to the overall binding entropy. This view warrants a more quantitative foundation. Here we calibrate an 'entropy meter' using an experimental dynamical proxy based on NMR relaxation and show that changes in the conformational entropy of calmodulin are a significant component of the energetics of binding. Furthermore, the distribution of motion at the interface between the target domain and calmodulin is surprisingly noncomplementary. These observations promote modification of our understanding of the energetics of protein-ligand interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1978308161,"Mps1, a dual-specificity kinase, is required for the proper functioning of the spindle assembly checkpoint and for the maintenance of chromosomal stability. As Mps1 function has been implicated in numerous phases of the cell cycle, the development of a potent, selective small-molecule inhibitor of Mps1 should facilitate dissection of Mps1-related biology. We describe the cellular effects and Mps1 cocrystal structures of new, selective small-molecule inhibitors of Mps1. Consistent with RNAi studies, chemical inhibition of Mps1 leads to defects in Mad1 and Mad2 establishment at unattached kinetochores, decreased Aurora B kinase activity, premature mitotic exit and gross aneuploidy, without any evidence of centrosome duplication defects. However, in U2OS cells having extra centrosomes (an abnormality found in some cancers), Mps1 inhibition increases the frequency of multipolar mitoses. Lastly, Mps1 inhibitor treatment resulted in a decrease in cancer cell viability."
https://openalex.org/W2025519885,"The RhoA GTPase is crucial in numerous biological functions and is linked to cancer metastasis. However, the understanding of the molecular mechanism responsible for RhoA transcription is still very limited. Here we show that RhoA transcription is orchestrated by the Myc-Skp2-Miz1-p300 transcriptional complex. Skp2 cooperates with Myc to induce RhoA transcription by recruiting Miz1 and p300 to the RhoA promoter independently of Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein containing complex (SCF)-Skp2 E3 ligase activity. Deficiency of this complex results in impairment in RhoA expression, cell migration, invasion, and breast cancer metastasis, recapitulating the phenotypes observed in RhoA knockdown, and RhoA restoration rescues the defect in cell invasion. Overexpression of the Myc-Skp2-Miz1 complex is found in metastatic human cancers and is correlated with RhoA expression. Our study provides insight into how oncogenic Skp2 and Myc coordinate to induce RhoA transcription and establishes a novel SCF-Skp2 E3-ligase-independent function for oncogenic Skp2 in transcription and cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2097820499,"Esophageal cancer is increasing in frequency in the United States faster than any other cancer. Barrett's esophagus, an otherwise benign complication of esophageal reflux, affects approximately three million Americans and precedes almost all cases of esophageal cancer. If detected as high-grade dysplasia (HGD), most esophageal cancers can be prevented. Standard-of-care screening for dysplasia uses visual endoscopy and a prescribed pattern of biopsy. This procedure, in which a tiny fraction of the affected tissue is selected for pathological examination, has a low probability of detection because dysplasia is highly focal and visually indistinguishable. We developed a system called endoscopic polarized scanning spectroscopy (EPSS), which performs rapid optical scanning and multispectral imaging of the entire esophageal surface and provides diagnoses in near real time. By detecting and mapping suspicious sites, guided biopsy of invisible, precancerous dysplasia becomes practicable. Here we report the development of EPSS and its application in several clinical cases, one of which merits special consideration."
https://openalex.org/W2009300653,"Different classes of non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs, have recently been implicated in the process of tumourigenesis. In this study, we examined the expression and putative functions of a novel class of non-coding RNAs known as transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) in neuroblastoma. Genome-wide expression profiling revealed correlations between specific T-UCR expression levels and important clinicogenetic parameters such as MYCN amplification status. A functional genomics approach based on the integration of multi-level transcriptome data was adapted to gain insights into T-UCR functions. Assignments of T-UCRs to cellular processes such as TP53 response, differentiation and proliferation were verified using various cellular model systems. For the first time, our results define a T-UCR expression landscape in neuroblastoma and suggest widespread T-UCR involvement in diverse cellular processes that are deregulated in the process of tumourigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1987681675,"Cells from individuals with Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) show reduced activities of antioxidant enzymes and cannot up-regulate their expression when exposed to oxidative stress. This blunted antioxidant response may play a central role in the pathogenesis. We previously reported that Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Gamma (PPARgamma) Coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1alpha), a transcriptional master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant responses, is down-regulated in most cell types from FRDA patients and animal models.We used primary fibroblasts from FRDA patients and the knock in-knock out animal model for the disease (KIKO mouse) to determine basal superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) levels and the response to oxidative stress induced by the addition of hydrogen peroxide. We measured the same parameters after pharmacological stimulation of PGC-1alpha. Compared to control cells, PGC-1alpha and SOD2 levels were decreased in FRDA cells and did not change after addition of hydrogen peroxide. PGC-1alpha direct silencing with siRNA in control fibroblasts led to a similar loss of SOD2 response to oxidative stress as observed in FRDA fibroblasts. PGC-1alpha activation with the PPARgamma agonist (Pioglitazone) or with a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) agonist (AICAR) restored normal SOD2 induction. Treatment of the KIKO mice with Pioglitazone significantly up-regulates SOD2 in cerebellum and spinal cord.PGC-1alpha down-regulation is likely to contribute to the blunted antioxidant response observed in cells from FRDA patients. This response can be restored by AMPK and PPARgamma agonists, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for FRDA."

https://openalex.org/W2054332795,"Rac1 has a role in proliferation and survival of tumor cells in vitro. The exact effects of Rac1 on growth, apoptosis and corresponding signaling pathways during tumorigenesis in vivo, however, have not been explored yet. Using mice with a keratinocyte-restricted deletion of the Rac1 gene, we found that Rac1 is essential for DMBA/TPA-induced skin tumor formation. This corresponded to a decreased keratinocyte hyperproliferation, although apoptosis was not detectably altered. Activated Rac1 promoted Erk-dependent hyperproliferation by Pak1-mediated Mek activation independent of Mek1 phosporylation at serine 298. Rac1 was furthermore required for Pak2-dependent hyperactivation of Akt, which under in vivo condition was restricted to the suprabasal cell layers corresponding to a suprabasal-specific expression of Pak2. It is surprising that none of these signaling pathways was altered in untreated Rac1-deficient skin, indicating a hyperproliferation-specific function of Rac1 in vivo. These data suggest that blocking of Rac1 function might allow tumor-specific growth repression, as Rac1 is not required for normal growth and growth signaling controlling pathways in skin in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2004037338,"Activation of androgen receptor (AR) may have a role in the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer. Two intracellular tyrosine kinases, Ack1 (activated cdc42-associated kinase) and Src, phosphorylate and enhance AR activity and promote prostate xenograft tumor growth in castrated animals. However, the upstream signals that activate these kinases and lead to AR activation are incompletely characterized. In this study, we investigated AR phosphorylation in response to non-androgen ligand stimulation using phospho-specific antibodies. Treatment of LNCaP and LAPC-4 cells with epidermal growth factor (EGF), heregulin, Gas6 (ligand binding to the Mer receptor tyrosine kinase and activating Ack1 downstream), interleukin (IL)-6 or bombesin stimulated cell proliferation in the absence of androgen. Treatment of LNCaP and LAPC-4 cells with EGF, heregulin or Gas6 induced AR phosphorylation at Tyr-267, whereas IL-6 or bombesin treatment did not. AR phosphorylation at Tyr-534 was induced by treatment with EGF, IL-6 or bombesin, but not by heregulin or Gas6. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Ack1 or Src showed that Ack1 mediates heregulin- and Gas6-induced AR Tyr-267 phosphorylation, whereas Src mediates Tyr-534 phosphorylation induced by EGF, IL-6 and bombesin. Dasatinib, a Src inhibitor, blocked EGF-induced Tyr-534 phosphorylation. In addition, we showed that dasatinib also inhibited Ack1 kinase. Dasatinib inhibited heregulin-induced Ack1 kinase activity and AR Tyr-267 phosphorylation. In addition, dasatinib inhibited heregulin-induced AR-dependent reporter activity. Dasatinib also inhibited heregulin-induced expression of endogenous AR target genes. Dasatinib inhibited Ack1-dependent colony formation and prostate xenograft tumor growth in castrated mice. Interestingly, Ack1 or Src knockdown or dasatinib did not inhibit EGF-induced AR Tyr-267 phosphorylation or EGF-stimulated AR activity, suggesting the existence of an additional tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates AR at Tyr-267. These data suggest that specific tyrosine kinases phosphorylate AR at distinct sites and that dasatinib may exert antitumor activity in prostate cancer through inhibition of Ack1."
https://openalex.org/W1995767984,"GEMC1 is a newly discovered protein required for initiation of DNA replication in Xenopus. xGEMC1 interacts with the replication factors TopBP1 and Cdk2 and promotes TopBP1- and Cdk2-dependent loading of Cdc45 onto replication origins. Many of the factors required for chromosomal DNA replication have been identified in unicellular eukaryotes. However, DNA replication is poorly understood in multicellular organisms. Here, we report the identification of GEMC1 (geminin coiled-coil containing protein 1), a novel vertebrate protein required for chromosomal DNA replication. GEMC1 is highly conserved in vertebrates and is preferentially expressed in proliferating cells. Using Xenopus laevis egg extract we show that Xenopus GEMC1 (xGEMC1) binds to the checkpoint and replication factor TopBP1, which promotes binding of xGEMC1 to chromatin during pre-replication complex (pre-RC) formation. We demonstrate that xGEMC1 interacts directly with replication factors such as Cdc45 and the kinase Cdk2–CyclinE, through which it is heavily phosphorylated. Phosphorylated xGEMC1 stimulates initiation of DNA replication, whereas depletion of xGEMC1 prevents the onset of DNA replication owing to the impairment of Cdc45 loading onto chromatin. Similarly, inhibition of GEMC1 expression with morpholino and siRNA oligos prevents DNA replication in embryonic and somatic vertebrate cells. These data suggest that GEMC1 promotes initiation of chromosomal DNA replication in multicellular organisms by mediating TopBP1- and Cdk2-dependent recruitment of Cdc45 onto replication origins."
https://openalex.org/W1986792117,"Uncontrolled growth and diffused invasion are major causes of mortality in patients with malignant gliomas. Nodal has been shown to have a central role in the tumorigenic signaling pathways of malignant melanoma. In this study, we show that grade IV human glioma cell lines expressed different levels of Nodal, paralleled to the potential for cell invasiveness. Treatment of glioma cell lines with recombinant Nodal (rNodal) increased matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) secretion and cell invasiveness. The ectopic expression of Nodal in GBM glioma cells that expressed Nodal at low level resulted in increased MMP-2 secretion, enhanced cell invasiveness, raised cell proliferation rates in vitro, increased tumor growth in vivo, and was associated with poor survival in a mice xenograft model. In contrast, the knockdown of Nodal expression in U87MG glioma cells with high Nodal expression level had reduced MMP-2 secretion, less cell invasiveness, lower tumor growth in vivo and longer lifespan in mice with U87MG/shNodal cell xenografts. In addition, Nodal knockdown promoted the reversion of malignant glioma cells toward a differentiated astrocytic phenotype. Furthermore, our data support the notion that Nodal may regulate glioma progression through the induction of the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and Cripto-1 through activated Smad."
https://openalex.org/W1953094574,"An important event in cholesterol metabolism is the efflux of cellular cholesterol by apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the major protein of high density lipoproteins (HDL). Lipid-free apoA-I is the preferred substrate for ATP-binding cassette A1, which promotes cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam cells in the arterial wall. However, the vast majority of apoA-I in plasma is associated with HDL, and the mechanisms for the generation of lipid-free apoA-I remain poorly understood. In the current study, we used fluorescently labeled apoA-I that exhibits a distinct fluorescence emission spectrum when in different states of lipid association to establish the kinetics of apoA-I transition between the lipid-associated and lipid-free states. This approach characterized the spontaneous and rapid exchange of apoA-I between the lipid-associated and lipid-free states. In contrast, the kinetics of apoA-I exchange were significantly reduced when apoA-I on HDL was cross-linked with a bi-functional reagent or oxidized by myeloperoxidase. Our observations support the hypothesis that oxidative damage to apoA-I by myeloperoxidase limits the ability of apoA-I to be liberated in a lipid-free form from HDL. This impairment of apoA-I exchange reaction may be a trait of dysfunctional HDL contributing to reduced ATP-binding cassette A1-mediated cholesterol efflux and atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2055834849,"Background The two forms of white rhinoceros; northern and southern, have had contrasting conservation histories. The Northern form, once fairly numerous is now critically endangered, while the southern form has recovered from a few individuals to a population of a few thousand. Since their last taxonomic assessment over three decades ago, new material and analytical techniques have become available, necessitating a review of available information and re-assessment of the taxonomy. Results Dental morphology and cranial anatomy clearly diagnosed the southern and northern forms. The differentiation was well supported by dental metrics, cranial growth and craniometry, and corresponded with differences in post-cranial skeleton, external measurements and external features. No distinctive differences were found in the limited descriptions of their behavior and ecology. Fossil history indicated the antiquity of the genus, dating back at least to early Pliocene and evolution into a number of diagnosable forms. The fossil skulls examined fell outside the two extant forms in the craniometric analysis. Genetic divergence between the two forms was consistent across both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, and indicated a separation of over a million years. Conclusions On re-assessing the taxonomy of the two forms we find them to be morphologically and genetically distinct, warranting the recognition of the taxa formerly designated as subspecies; Ceratotherium simum simum the southern form and Ceratotherium simum cottoni the northern form, as two distinct species Ceratotherium simum and Ceratotherium cottoni respectively. The recognition of the northern form as a distinct species has profound implications for its conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2067743529,"Background Small Heat Shock Proteins (sHSPs) are chaperone-like proteins involved in the prevention of the irreversible aggregation of misfolded proteins. Although many studies have already been conducted on sHSPs, the molecular mechanisms and structural properties of these proteins remain unclear. Here, we propose a better understanding of the architecture, organization and properties of the sHSP family through structural and functional annotations. We focused on the Alpha Crystallin Domain (ACD), a sandwich fold that is the hallmark of the sHSP family. Methodology/Principal Findings We developed a new approach for detecting sHSPs and delineating ACDs based on an iterative Hidden Markov Model algorithm using a multiple alignment profile generated from structural data on ACD. Using this procedure on the UniProt databank, we found 4478 sequences identified as sHSPs, showing a very good coverage with the corresponding PROSITE and Pfam profiles. ACD was then delimited and structurally annotated. We showed that taxonomic-based groups of sHSPs (animals, plants, bacteria) have unique features regarding the length of their ACD and, more specifically, the length of a large loop within ACD. We detailed highly conserved residues and patterns specific to the whole family or to some groups of sHSPs. For 96% of studied sHSPs, we identified in the C-terminal region a conserved I/V/L-X-I/V/L motif that acts as an anchor in the oligomerization process. The fragment defined from the end of ACD to the end of this motif has a mean length of 14 residues and was named the C-terminal Anchoring Module (CAM). Conclusions/Significance This work annotates structural components of ACD and quantifies properties of several thousand sHSPs. It gives a more accurate overview of the architecture of sHSP monomers."
https://openalex.org/W2100069305,"The long-term cellular response to DNA damage is controlled by the tumor suppressor p53. It results in cell-cycle arrest followed by DNA repair and, depending on the degree of damage inflicted, premature senescence or apoptotic cell death. Here we show that in normal diploid fibroblasts the ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C)–Cdh1 becomes prematurely activated in G2 as part of the sustained long-term but not the rapid short-term response to genotoxic stress and results in the degradation of numerous APC/C substrates. Using HCT116 somatic knockout cells we show that mechanistically premature APC/C activation depends on p53 and its transcriptional target p21 that mediates the signal through downregulation of the APC/C inhibitor Emi1. Cdc14B is dispensable in this setting but might function redundantly. Our data suggest an unexpected role for the APC/C in executing a part of the p53-dependent DNA damage response that leads to premature senescence."
https://openalex.org/W1988998787,"Angiotensin II (Ang II) plays a major role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and diabetes by inhibiting insulin's metabolic and potentiating its trophic effects. Whereas the precise mechanisms involved remain ill-defined, they appear to be associated with and dependent upon increased oxidative stress. We found Ang II to block insulin-dependent GLUT4 translocation in L6 myotubes in an NO- and O2.−-dependent fashion suggesting the involvement of peroxynitrite. This hypothesis was confirmed by the ability of Ang II to induce tyrosine nitration of the MAP kinases ERK1/2 and of protein kinase B/Akt (Akt). Tyrosine nitration of ERK1/2 was required for their phosphorylation on Thr and Tyr and their subsequent activation, whereas it completely inhibited Akt phosphorylation on Ser473 and Thr308 as well as its activity. The inhibitory effect of nitration on Akt activity was confirmed by the ability of SIN-1 to completely block GSK3α phosphorylation in vitro. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase and NAD(P)Hoxidase and scavenging of free radicals with myricetin restored insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation and GLUT4 translocation in the presence of Ang II. Similar restoration was obtained by inhibiting the ERK activating kinase MEK, indicating that these kinases regulate Akt activation. We found a conserved nitration site of ERK1/2 to be located in their kinase domain on Tyr156/139, close to their active site Asp166/149, in agreement with a permissive function of nitration for their activation. Taken together, our data show that Ang II inhibits insulin-mediated GLUT4 translocation in this skeletal muscle model through at least two pathways: first through the transient activation of ERK1/2 which inhibit IRS-1/2 and second through a direct inhibitory nitration of Akt. These observations indicate that not only oxidative but also nitrative stress play a key role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. They underline the role of protein nitration as a major mechanism in the regulation of Ang II and insulin signaling pathways and more particularly as a key regulator of protein kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2030436082,"Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs), especially type 16 has been undeniably linked to cervical cancer. The Asian-American (AA) variant of HPV16 is more common in the Americas than the prototype in cervical cancer. The different prevalence is based on three amino acid changes within the E6 protein denoted Q14H/H78Y/L83V. To investigate the mechanism(s) behind this observation, both E6 proteins, in the presence of E7, were evaluated for their ability to extend the life span of and transform primary human foreskin keratinocytes (PHFKs). Long-term cell culture studies resulted in death at passage 9 of vector-transduced PHFKs (negative control), but survival of both E6 PHFKs to passage 65 (and beyond). Compared with E6/E7 PHFKs, AA/E7 PHFKs were significantly faster dividing, developed larger cells in monolayer cultures, showed double the epithelial thickness and expressed cytokeratin 10 when grown as organotypic raft cultures. Telomerase activation and p53 inactivation, two hallmarks of immortalization, were not significantly different between the two populations. Both were resistant to anoikis at later passages, but only AA/E7 PHFKs acquired the capacity for in vitro transformation. Proteomic analysis revealed markedly different protein patterns between E6/E7 and AA/E7, particularly with respect to key cellular metabolic enzymes. Our results provide new insights into the reasons underlying the greater prevalence of the AA variant in cervical cancer as evidenced by characteristics associated with higher oncogenic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2093877553,"Infected airway epithelial cells up-regulate the expression of chemokines, chiefly IL-8, and antimicrobial molecules including β-defensins (BD). Acinetobacter baumannii is a cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia. We examined whether A. baumannii induced the expressions of IL-8 and BD2 by airway epithelial cells and the receptors implicated in bacterial detection. A549 and human primary airway cells released IL-8 upon infection. A. baumannii-infected cells also increased the expression of BD2 which killed A. baummannii strains. IL-8 induction was via NF-κB and mitogen-activated kinases p38 and p44/42-dependent pathways. A. baumannii engaged Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4 pathways and A549 cells could use soluble CD14 as TLRs co-receptor. A. baumannii lipopolysaccharide stimulated IL-8 release by A549 cells and sCD14 facilitated the recognition of the lipopolysaccharide. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that A. baumannii lipid A structure matches those with endotoxic potential. These results demonstrate that airway epithelial cells produce mediators important for A. baumannii clearance."
https://openalex.org/W2086447005,"The type III secretion system (T3SS) is a complex nanomachine employed by many Gram-negative pathogens, including the nosocomial agent Pseudomonas aeruginosa, to inject toxins directly into the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. A key component of all T3SS is the translocon, a proteinaceous channel that is inserted into the target membrane, which allows passage of toxins into target cells. In most bacterial species, two distinct membrane proteins (the ""translocators"") are involved in translocon formation, whereas in the bacterial cytoplasm, however, they remain associated to a common chaperone. To date, the strategy employed by a single chaperone to recognize two distinct translocators is unknown. Here, we report the crystal structure of a complex between the Pseudomonas translocator chaperone PcrH and a short region from the minor translocator PopD. PcrH displays a 7-helical tetratricopeptide repeat fold that harbors the PopD peptide within its concave region, originally believed to be involved in recognition of the major translocator, PopB. Point mutations introduced into the PcrH-interacting region of PopD impede translocator-chaperone recognition in vitro and lead to impairment of bacterial cytotoxicity toward macrophages in vivo. These results indicate that T3SS translocator chaperones form binary complexes with their partner molecules, and the stability of their interaction regions must be strictly maintained to guarantee bacterial infectivity. The PcrH-PopD complex displays homologs among a number of pathogenic strains and could represent a novel, potential target for antibiotic development."
https://openalex.org/W2146062936,"Background The parasitoid Jewel Wasp hunts cockroaches to serve as a live food supply for its offspring. The wasp stings the cockroach in the head and delivers a cocktail of neurotoxins directly inside the prey's cerebral ganglia. Although not paralyzed, the stung cockroach becomes a living yet docile ‘zombie’, incapable of self-initiating spontaneous or evoked walking. We show here that such neuro-chemical manipulation can be attributed to decreased neuronal activity in a small region of the cockroach cerebral nervous system, the sub-esophageal ganglion (SEG). A decrease in descending permissive inputs from this ganglion to thoracic central pattern generators decreases the propensity for walking-related behaviors. Methodology and Principal Findings We have used behavioral, neuro-pharmacological and electrophysiological methods to show that: (1) Surgically removing the cockroach SEG prior to wasp stinging prolongs the duration of the sting 5-fold, suggesting that the wasp actively targets the SEG during the stinging sequence; (2) injecting a sodium channel blocker, procaine, into the SEG of non-stung cockroaches reversibly decreases spontaneous and evoked walking, suggesting that the SEG plays an important role in the up-regulation of locomotion; (3) artificial focal injection of crude milked venom into the SEG of non-stung cockroaches decreases spontaneous and evoked walking, as seen with naturally-stung cockroaches; and (4) spontaneous and evoked neuronal spiking activity in the SEG, recorded with an extracellular bipolar microelectrode, is markedly decreased in stung cockroaches versus non-stung controls. Conclusions and Significance We have identified the neuronal substrate responsible for the venom-induced manipulation of the cockroach's drive for walking. Our data strongly support previous findings suggesting a critical and permissive role for the SEG in the regulation of locomotion in insects. By injecting a venom cocktail directly into the SEG, the parasitoid Jewel Wasp selectively manipulates the cockroach's motivation to initiate walking without interfering with other non-related behaviors."

Little is known about the molecular function of SNM1A, in terms of its recruitment to ICL lesions or its DNA damage processing activity. Here we show that SNM1A contains a functional PIP box (PCNA-interacting protein box) and a UBZ (ubiquitin binding zinc finger), required for assembly of SNM1A into nuclear focus. Moreover, RAD18-dependent monoubiquitination of PCNA is required for Mitomycin C and Ultraviolet Light inducible SNM1A nuclear focus assembly. Taken together, our results identify a novel RAD18-PCNA(Ub)-SNM1A pathway required for nuclear focus formation and ICL resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2087784335,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a well-described proinflammatory mediator. MIF overexpression has been observed in many tumors and is implicated in oncogenic transformation and tumor progression. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for regulating MIF expression remain poorly understood. In this study, we showed that the transcriptional repressor HBP1 (HMG box-containing protein 1) negatively regulates MIF expression. We first identified a large high-affinity HBP1 DNA-binding element at positions −811 to −792 from the transcriptional start site within the MIF promoter by computer analysis. Reporter analyses showed that this element was required for HBP1-mediated transcriptional repression. Furthermore, HBP1 associated with the MIF promoter in vivo and repressed endogenous MIF gene expression. Consistent with HBP1-mediated repression of MIF, low levels of HBP1 expression were associated with high levels of MIF expression in prostate cancer samples. Importantly, HBP1-mediated repression of MIF inhibited tumorigenic growth and invasion, and the repressive effect of HBP1 on tumorigenic growth and invasion could be partially rescued by the addition of recombinant MIF to the culture medium. Finally, prostate tumor samples with low HBP1 and high MIF expression were associated with a significant decrease in relapse-free survival. Taken together, these results indicated that HBP1 directly inhibited MIF gene transcription, and suggested that the loss of HBP1 expression or activity may contribute to the upregulation of MIF expression in prostate tumor tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1972212024,"Aberrant Wnt signaling has been implicated in a wide variety of cancers and many components of the Wnt signaling network have now been identified. Much less is known, however, about how these proteins are coordinately regulated. Here, a broad, quantitative, and dynamic study of Wnt3a-mediated stimulation of HEK 293 cells revealed two phases of transcriptional regulation: an early phase in which signaling antagonists were downregulated, providing positive feedback, and a later phase in which many of these same antagonists were upregulated, attenuating signaling. The dynamic expression profiles of several response genes, including MYC and CTBP1, correlated significantly with proliferation and migration (P<0.05). Additionally, their levels tracked with the tumorigenicity of colon cancer cell lines and they were significantly overexpressed in colorectal adenocarcinomas (P<0.05). Our data highlight CtBP1 as a transcription factor that contributes to positive feedback during the early phases of Wnt signaling and serves as a novel marker for colorectal cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2020228459,"Activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of HER2 (ErbB2) have been identified in human cancers. Compared with wild-type HER2, mutant HER2 shows constitutively activate kinase activity and increased oncogenicity. Cells transformed by mutant HER2 are resistant to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors and exhibit an attenuated response to the HER2 antibody trastuzumab. We investigated herein pathways through which mutant HER2 alters the extracellular environment, potentially leading to drug resistance and the effect of simultaneously targeting HER2 and the tumor cell microenvironment with a therapeutic intent. Expression of mutant HER2 in mammary epithelial cells activated autocrine transforming growth factor (TGF) β1 signaling through a mechanism involving Rac1 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase-activating protein 1-dependent transcription. Cells transformed by an activating mutant of H-Ras (G12V) also expressed higher TGF-β1 level through Rac1 activation. In addition, mutant HER2 induced the EGFR ligands TGF-α and amphiregulin at the mRNA and protein levels. Vascular endothelial growth factor, a target of the TGF-β-Smad transcriptional regulation, was also induced as a result of expression of mutant HER2. Inhibition of TGF-β signaling with the Alk5 small molecule inhibitor LY2109761 reduced growth and invasiveness of cells expressing mutant HER2. Combined inhibition of intracellular and paracrine effects of mutant HER2 by trastuzumab and the EGFR antibody cetuximab were more efficient than single-agent therapies. These data suggest that mutations in oncogenes such as HER2 and Ras not only alter intracellular signaling but also influence on other components of the tumor microenvironment by inducing several pro-invasive growth factors. In turn, these serve as extracellular targets of novel therapeutic strategies directed at both cancer-driving oncogenes and the modified tumor microenvironment."

For several reasons, ASIC channels are ideally positioned to sense changes in brain interstitium. First, the structure of ASICs is unique for ion channels in that ∼70% of the entire protein consists of a single large extracellular loop. Second, ASIC1a homomeric channels are profoundly sensitive to subtle pH changes; the threshold of activation is ∼7.0, and half-maximal activation occurs at pH ∼6.8 (11Benson C.J. Xie J. Wemmie J.A.

In fact, loss of ASIC1a abolishes currents in central nervous system neurons evoked by extracellular pH changes in the range between 7.2 and 6.0 (6Wemmie J.A. Chen J. Askwith C.C. Hruska-Hageman A.M.

Third, multiple other chemicals that are released by metabolically stressed brain cells can potentiate ASICs. For example, ASIC currents are increased by physiological concentrations of lactate, ATP, or arachidonic acid (14Allen N.J. Attwell D. J.

These sites are coordinated by two nearby residues (Arg-310 and Glu-314) on an α-helix of one subunit, a residue (Lys-212) from an adjacent subunit, and are almost completely conserved between all H+-gated ASIC isoforms. Extracellular anions are known to modulate a wide variety of ion channels, including the ASIC-related epithelial sodium channel ENaC (20Collier D.M. Snyder P.M. J. Biol.

Here, we investigated the effect of extracellular Cl− and other anions on heterologously expressed ASIC1a as well as native ASICs in mammalian central nervous system neurons. Mouse ASIC1a was cloned as described previously (11Benson C.J. Xie J. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P. Henss J.M. Welsh M.J. Snyder P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 2338-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The mutations ASIC1aK211A, ASIC1aR309A, and ASIC1aE313A (the residues are numbered per the mouse ASIC1a sequence) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced at the University of Iowa DNA core. Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells plated at ∼10% confluence were transfected with ASIC cDNAs (0.36 μg/1.5 ml) using Transfast transfection reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) in 35-mm dishes according to the manufacturer's recommendations. DsRed (Express-C1, Clontech) cDNA (1.64 μg/1.5 ml) and green fluorescent protein (pGreen Lantern, Invitrogen) cDNA (0.33 μg/1.5 ml) were cotransfected to facilitate detection of expressing cells by epifluorescence. Cells were cultured in F12 nutrient medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and were studied 48–72 h after transfection. Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons from E18 rat embryos were prepared as described previously (24Chen Y. Stevens B. Chang J. Milbrandt J. Barres B.A. Hell J.W. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2008; 171: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Briefly, neurons were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips at a density of 30,000/cm2 and were maintained in serum-free NS21 media in a humidified incubator (5% CO2 at 37 °C). Experiments were performed on neurons at 10–15 days in vitro. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings (at −70 mV) from CHO cells and hippocampal neurons were performed at room temperature with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and were acquired and analyzed with PULSE/PULSEFIT 8.70 (HEKA Electronics, Lambrecht, Germany) and IGOR Pro 6.01 (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) software. Currents were filtered at 5 kHz and sampled at 2 or 0.2 kHz. Micropipettes (2–4 megohms) were filled with internal solution (in mm) as follows: 100 KCl, 10 EGTA, 40 HEPES, and 5 MgCl2, pH 7.4, with KOH. Standard external solutions contained (in mm) the following: 120 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 MES; pH was adjusted with tetramethylammonium hydroxide, and osmolarity was adjusted with tetramethylammonium chloride. The total Cl− in each pH solution was (in mm) as follows: 148 pH 5.0, 143 pH 6.0, 140 pH 6.5, 138 pH 6.8, 137 pH 7.0, 135 pH 7.2, 134 pH 7.4, and 131 pH 8.0. In other anion solutions, we substituted NaCH3SO3, NaSCN, NaBr, or NaI for NaCl and omitted tetramethylammonium chloride for a total Cl− concentration of 11 mm. In some experiments, as stated we used Cl−-free external solutions (in mm) as follows: 120 NaCH3SO3, 5 KOH, 2 Ca(OH)2, 10 HEPES, 10 MES; pH was adjusted with methanesulfonic acid or tetramethylammonium hydroxide. Extracellular solutions were changed within 20 ms by using a computer-driven solenoid valve system (25Benson C.J. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To compensate for ASIC1a current tachyphylaxis in pH dose response and recovery from desensitization experiments, we bracketed each test pH application with maximal stimulating pulses (pH 8 to 5), and we then used the following formula to normalize the data: Itest/(Imax, 1 + Imax, 2)/2. Kinetics of desensitization were fit to single exponential equations and time constants (τ) as reported. pH-dependent steady-state desensitization and the curves plotting the effect of anion concentration substitution on the desensitization kinetics were fit to the Hill equation with IGOR Pro 6.01. Data are means ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed using unpaired Student's t test. Rat hippocampal neurons were exposed to pH 7.4 or 5.0 solutions consisting of NaCl, NaCH3SO3, or NaSCN (see external solutions described above) for 15 min at room temperature, followed by two washes with PBS+ (1 mm phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). Cells were then incubated in 1 mm phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 μm ethidium homodimer-1 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at room temperature to label dead cells and then fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 30 min. Samples were washed three times with PBS+, mounted on slides, and imaged using a Zeiss AXIO ImagerA1 fluorescent microscope. Two to three frames per coverslip were imaged using an AxioCam MRc5 camera under phase or fluorescence (Zeiss filter set 43) at ×10 magnification. Total and dead cells from three different neuronal preparations were counted in phase and fluorescent images, respectively, by a blinded individual, and summed data were reported as the percentage of dead cells in each experimental condition. Statistical difference was assessed using unpaired Student's t test. To begin to test the functional effect of extracellular Cl−, we first studied currents recorded in CHO cells expressing ASIC1a. Fig. 1A demonstrates that rapid extracellular solution changes from pH 8 to more acidic pH values evoked rapidly activating and desensitizing inward currents. Replacement of Cl− with the generally impermeable and inert anion, methanesulfonate (MeSO3−), had no effect on peak current amplitude (Fig. 1A). Cl− substitution also had no effect on the pH dose response of activation (Fig. 1B) or steady-state desensitization (Fig. 1C). Additionally, replacement of extracellular NaCl with NaMeSO3 did not alter the reversal potential of the current-voltage relationship, indicating it did not affect the relative Na+ selectivity of the channel (Fig. 1, D and E). However, closer inspection of the currents revealed that those evoked in MeSO3− desensitized at a faster rate than those in Cl− (Fig. 2A). Fitting the desensitizing phase of the currents to a single exponential equation and plotting the time constants revealed that the currents desensitized faster in MeSO3− at all pH solutions tested (Fig. 2B). The rate of recovery from desensitization was not different in the two different anion solutions (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2Extracellular Cl− dose-dependently modulates the desensitization kinetics of ASIC1a.A, superimposed pH 6-evoked currents in Cl− or MeSO3− solutions.

Cells were then exposed to pH 8 solution for the indicated times before they were stimulated again with pH 6.

Fig. 2, D and E, shows that as the Cl− concentration is increased, the rate of desensitization slows. A plot of this relationship reveals that at higher doses of Cl− the curve begins to plateau (Fig. 2E), suggesting that Cl− binding is saturating. The half-maximal concentration of Cl that modulated the desensitization rate was 49 mm, and the Hill coefficient was 0.95. These data suggest that extracellular Cl− is binding to the channel (or other associated protein or lipid) at a low affinity site and show that Cl− can modulate ASIC1a through a broad concentration range, including those associated with pathological conditions in the brain. As others have shown (26Chen X. Gründer S. J. Physiol. 2007; 579: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), ASIC1a homomeric channels displayed significant rundown (tachyphylaxis) to repeated applications of acidic solution. Sequential activation of the channels with pH 5 solutions in 1-min intervals caused current amplitudes to progressively decrease (Fig. 3). However, the rate of tachyphylaxis was significantly attenuated when currents were recorded in MeSO3− compared with Cl−. The changes in the rate of tachyphylaxis and in desensitization kinetics were both dependent upon the anion in the test solution and not the conditioning solution and were immediately reversible upon switching anions (data not shown). To summarize, these results show that extracellular Cl− modulates the kinetics of both desensitization and tachyphylaxis of ASIC1a in a concentration-dependent manner, but it does not affect the pH sensitivity of activation or steady-state desensitization nor Na+ selectivity. We asked if other anions can modulate ASIC1a or is this a unique property of Cl−? Interestingly, currents evoked in extracellular thiocyanate (SCN−) displayed very fast desensitization and, in fact, were faster than those evoked in MeSO3− (τ = 355 ± 15 ms versus 450 ± 15 ms) (Fig. 4, A and B). Currents evoked in Br− and I− desensitized slower than those in MeSO3− but faster than those in Cl− (Fig. 4B). We also noted that currents evoked in I− and SCN− tended to be of smaller amplitude than those evoked in Cl− (Fig. 4C). Moreover, I− and SCN− attenuated tachyphylaxis of ASIC1a to a greater extent than MeSO3−, whereas tachyphylaxis in Br− was similar to that in Cl− (Fig. 4D). The pH activation dose response was similar in all anions tested (data not shown). Because SCN− is a large anion with weak hydration, it often binds to proteins and modulates ion channels more potently than smaller, more hydrophilic anions such as Cl− (21Dani J.A. Sanchez J.A. Hille B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 81: 255-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, we were surprised that currents evoked in SCN− desensitized even faster and had even less tachyphylaxis than those evoked in MeSO3−. To test the binding capacity of SCN− relative to Cl−, we measured current desensitization rates in various mixtures of SCN− and Cl− solutions. Fig. 4, E and F, shows that currents desensitized faster with increasing SCN−:Cl− concentration ratios. Moreover, the nonlinear shape of the dose-response relationship shows that small concentrations of SCN− generate large changes in the desensitization kinetics, suggesting that SCN− binds more avidly than Cl−. Thus, it appears that other anions, besides Cl−, can bind to ASIC1a; however, binding does not appear to be sufficient to reproduce the functional effects seen with Cl−. To directly test the hypothesis that Cl− modulates ASIC1a by binding to the extracellular domain, we mutated the amino acids involved in Cl− binding in the cASIC1a crystal structure (Fig. 5A) (3Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). The mutant channels K211A, R309A, and E313A each generated functional channels with large currents, and their pH activation dose responses were similar to those of wild type ASIC1a (data not shown). However, each of the mutations markedly increased the rate of desensitization (Fig. 5, B and C) and slowed the rate of tachyphylaxis (Fig. 5D). These results mimicked the effect of replacing extracellular Cl− with MeSO3− on wild type ASIC1a, suggesting that mutation of any one of these amino acids abolished the effect of Cl−. To directly test this possibility, we compared the desensitization rate of the mutant channels in Cl− and MeSO3−. Fig. 5E demonstrates that anion substitution had minimal effect on the mutations (compare with wild type channels in Fig. 2B) and suggests that Cl− modulation of ASIC1a is dependent upon the coordinated binding of Cl− to these three amino acids. We tested if anions can also modulate native ASIC channels. We studied hippocampal neurons because it is well characterized that ASIC1a is the major ASIC subunit that underlies H+-gated currents in these cells (27Askwith C.C. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P.

Physiol. 2002; 539: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Compared with SCN−, Cl− markedly slowed the rate of desensitization (Fig. 6, A and B), increased the current amplitude (Fig. 6C), had no effect on pH activation dose response (Fig. 6D), and increased the rate of tachyphylaxis of H+-gated currents in dissociated hippocampal neurons (Fig. 6E). The results mirror the effect of anion substitution on heterologously expressed ASIC1a and show that extracellular Cl− can modulate ASIC channels in the brain. Activation of ASICs during cerebral ischemia contributes to cell death in an in vivo stroke model (8Xiong Z.G. Zhu X.M. Chu X.P. Minami M. Hey J. Wei W.L. MacDonald J.F. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P.

Cell. 2004; 118: 687-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar), and prolonged exposure of cultured cortical neurons to extracellular acidosis induces ASIC1a-dependent cell death (8Xiong Z.G. Zhu X.M. Chu X.P. Minami M. Hey J. Wei W.L. MacDonald J.F. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. Simon R.P.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 14371-14380Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To begin to understand the physiological/pathophysiological implications of anion substitution on neuronal function, we tested if anions could affect acid-induced neuronal death. Following incubation in various pH solutions, dead neurons were labeled with ethidium homodimer-1 (Fig. 7). Compared with pH 7.4, exposure of hippocampal neurons to pH 5.0 NaCl solution caused a significant percentage of neurons to die. Exposure to NaMeSO3 or NaSCN did not increase cell death compared with NaCl at neutral pH; however, acidic NaMeSO3 and NaSCN solutions both induced a greater percentage of cell death than the respective NaCl solution. This finding suggests that anion modulation of native neuronal ASIC channels can have pathological implications in brain disease states associated with acidosis. Extracellular anions, via their propensity to bind to various proteins and lipids, have been shown to affect a multitude of biological functions, including modulation of ion channel properties (21Dani J.A. Sanchez J.A. Hille B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 81: 255-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We tested the effect of extracellular anions on ASIC1a function both in heterologous cells and in rat hippocampal neurons and found that anion substitution altered a subset of channel biophysical properties. Cl− markedly slowed the rate of desensitization and increased tachyphylaxis in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, anions had no effect on the pH sensitivity of activation or steady-state desensitization and did not alter Na+ selectivity. These effects were dependent upon three extracellular residues that are purported to form a Cl−-binding site. The recent resolution of the ASIC1a crystal structure revealed that the channels consist of three subunits and the trimeric extracellular domain contains three anion-binding sites (3Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). These sites are located ∼10 Å below one of the residues (Asp-350) suggested to be involved in proton binding and pH activation. Thus, it would be reasonable to predict that anions might alter H+ binding and pH-dependent gating (31Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992: 261-290Google Scholar). However, we found that the pH sensitivity of both activation and steady-state desensitization was not altered with anion substitution or mutation of the anion-binding sites. In addition, mutation of these sites resulted in channels that generated robust currents, indicating that these sites are not required for channel assembly and trafficking. Instead, we found that anions modulated the kinetics of desensitization. Upon a rapid drop in pH, ASIC channels quickly open and then close in the continued presence of acidic pH. Desensitization rates are dependent upon the extracellular pH, the subunit composition of the channels, and involve a conformational change in the extracellular domain (11Benson C.J. Xie J. Wemmie J.A. Price M.P. Henss J.M. Welsh M.J. Snyder P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 2338-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 32Cushman K.A. Marsh-Haffner J. Adelman J.P.

Chem. 2004; 279: 11006-11015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that binding of anions to the extracellular domain has no effect on the stability of either the open or desensitized states (because steady-state desensitization was not changed), but rather anions alter the transition energy barrier between the open and desensitized states. In addition to affecting the kinetics of desensitization, anion substitution and mutations of the anion-binding sites produced significant changes in the tachyphylaxis of ASIC1a. This characteristic of diminishing responses to repeated acid stimulations is unique for ASIC1a homomers and seems to be dependent on H+ permeating through the channel (26Chen X. Gründer S. J. Physiol. 2007; 579: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It also depends upon the time that the channels remain in the open state. For example, shortening the time of acid applications or mutations that speed the rate of desensitization have both been shown to attenuate tachyphylaxis (26Chen X. Gründer S. J. Physiol. 2007; 579: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 34Gitterman D.P. Wilson J. Randall A.D. J. Physiol. 2005; 562: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Similarly, our data show a strong correlation between the rate of desensitization and the degree of tachyphylaxis. ASIC1a currents generated in Cl− displayed the slowest desensitization and the most tachyphylaxis. Conversely, currents in SCN− desensitized the fastest and displayed very little tachyphylaxis. Likewise, mutation of the anion-binding sites sped up desensitization and attenuated tachyphylaxis. Interestingly, currents recorded in SCN− and those from the mutant channels also tended to have smaller amplitudes. This could also be due to the increase in desensitization rate; some channels might desensitize faster than others can open or perhaps channels can directly desensitize without opening. Thus, we speculate that alterations of tachyphylaxis and current amplitude generated in different anions both resulted from changes in the desensitization rate and highlight the importance of desensitization rate to overall ASIC current properties. Our data support that anions modulate ASIC1a by binding to extracellular residues (K211A, R309A, and E313A) as defined by the cASIC1a crystal structure (3Jasti J. Furukawa H. Gonzales E.B. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 449: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Mutation of any one of the three residues disrupted anion modulation, suggesting that all three residues are necessary to coordinate Cl− binding. Although our studies do not directly measure anion binding to the channel, our Cl−:MeSO3− concentration substitution studies show dose dependence and are consistent with saturable Cl− binding (Fig. 2E). Based upon our desensitization rate data, the potency of different anions to modulate ASIC1a is SCN− < MeSO3− < I− < Br− < Cl−. On the other hand, our data also suggest that binding alone is not sufficient to impart the modulatory effects of anions on ASIC gating. The effect of SCN− is particularly interesting. Because SCN− is a relatively hydrophobic anion, it generally binds relatively well to proteins and lipids, and it has been shown to have pronounced effects upon the properties of several ion channels (21Dani J.A. Sanchez J.A. Hille B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 81: 255-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23Rychkov G.Y. Pusch M. Roberts M.L. Jentsch T.J. Bretag A.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 35Smith S.S. Steinle E.D. Meyerhoff M.E. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 799-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). For example, SCN− generates a greater shift in voltage dependence of sodium channel activation and inactivation than Cl− (21Dani J.A. Sanchez J.A. Hille B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 81: 255-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were surprised that results in SCN− mimicked those in MeSO3−, suggesting it did not bind to ASIC1a. However, our Cl−:SCN− concentration substitution data reveal that SCN− actually binds to ASIC1a with greater potency than Cl− (Fig. 4F). This suggests that SCN− might be functioning as a competitive antagonist of Cl−. It is also interesting that the rate of ASIC1a desensitization in MeSO3− (450 ± 15 ms at pH 6) was not as fast as in SCN− (355 ± 15 ms) or currents generated from the ASICK211A mutation (173 ± 8 ms). As a commonly used impermeant anion, we anticipated that MeSO3− would not interfere with Cl− binding, and thus MeSO3− substitution would mimic the effect of lack of anion binding. However, studies in the chloride channel, ClC-1, suggest that MeSO3−, although impermeant, can bind to a site outside the pore and modify the gating of the channel (23Rychkov G.Y. Pusch M. Roberts M.L. Jentsch T.J. Bretag A.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Perhaps MeSO3− can also bind and modulate ASIC1a, although it does so less potently than Cl−. Our data suggest that various anions can modulate ASIC1a; however, their capacity to do so is not entirely dependent upon their binding affinity to the channel and that Cl− appears particularly suited to modulate ASIC1a. Cl− could play two potential physiological and/or pathophysiological roles in ASIC function. First, in addition to sensing H+ and other metabolites, our data suggest that Cl− fluxes in the brain might modulate ASICs. Ischemia and injury are associated with major shifts of Na+ and Cl− ions into cells, which can generate significant changes in the concentration of these ions. During anoxia or spreading depression, the extracellular Cl− concentration in the brain can drop from a normal of ∼140 mm to the 50–90 mm range (36Hansen A.J. Zeuthen T. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1981; 113: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 37Jiang C. Agulian S. Haddad G.G. J. Physiol. 1992; 448: 697-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We found that changes in Cl− concentration within this range modulated ASIC1a. A reduction in extracellular Cl− associated with ischemia or hyperexcited states would increase the rate of desensitization of ASIC1a, thereby decreasing net charge conducted through the channel and decrease tachyphylaxis, both of which could have profound effects upon neuronal activity. In support of this, we found that anion substitution altered acid-induced neuronal death. We speculate that the increased death in MeSO3− and SCN− compared with Cl− was due to a decrease in ASIC1a tachyphylaxis. Alternatively, it is possible that ASICs do not sense changes in Cl− concentration, but rather Cl− serves as a necessary “cofactor” that is constitutively bound and is required for normal channel function. In a similar manner, Ca2+ functions as a cofactor for the normal gating of voltage-gated Na+ channels (38Armstrong C.M. Cota G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 6528-6531Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and, interestingly, ASICs (39Immke D.C. McCleskey E.W.

https://openalex.org/W2018028886,"Background The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene family is a highly conserved group of membrane receptors with diverse functions in developmental processes, lipoprotein trafficking, and cell signaling. The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein 1b (LRP1B) was reported to be deleted in several types of human malignancies, including non-small cell lung cancer. Our group has previously reported that a distal extracellular truncation of murine Lrp1b that is predicted to secrete the entire intact extracellular domain (ECD) is fully viable with no apparent phenotype. Methods and Principal Findings Here, we have used a gene targeting approach to create two mouse lines carrying internally rearranged exons of Lrp1b that are predicted to truncate the protein closer to the N-terminus and to prevent normal trafficking through the secretary pathway. Both mutations result in early embryonic lethality, but, as expected from the restricted expression pattern of LRP1b in vivo, loss of Lrp1b does not cause cellular lethality as homozygous Lrp1b-deficient blastocysts can be propagated normally in culture. This is similar to findings for another LDL receptor family member, Lrp4. We provide in vitro evidence that Lrp4 undergoes regulated intramembraneous processing through metalloproteases and γ-secretase cleavage. We further demonstrate negative regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway by the soluble extracellular domain. Conclusions and Significance Our results underline a crucial role for Lrp1b in development. The expression in mice of truncated alleles of Lrp1b and Lrp4 with deletions of the transmembrane and intracellular domains leads to release of the extracellular domain into the extracellular space, which is sufficient to confer viability. In contrast, null mutations are embryonically (Lrp1b) or perinatally (Lrp4) lethal. These findings suggest that the extracellular domains of both proteins may function as a scavenger for signaling ligands or signal modulators in the extracellular space, thereby preserving signaling thresholds that are critical for embryonic development, as well as for the clear, but poorly understood role of LRP1b in cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2076008898,"Cdr2 is a tumor antigen expressed in a high percentage of breast and ovarian tumors and is the target of a naturally occurring tumor immune response in patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, but little is known of its regulation or function in cancer cells. Here we find that cdr2 is cell cycle regulated in tumor cells with protein levels peaking in mitosis. As cells exit mitosis, cdr2 is ubiquitinated by the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and rapidly degraded by the proteasome. Previously we showed that cdr2 binds to the oncogene c-myc, and here we extend this observation to show that cdr2 and c-myc interact to synergistically regulate c-myc-dependent transcription during passage through mitosis. Loss of cdr2 leads to functional consequences for dividing cells, as they show aberrant mitotic spindle formation and impaired proliferation. Conversely, cdr2 overexpression is able to drive cell proliferation in tumors. Together, these data indicate that the onconeural antigen cdr2 acts during mitosis in cycling cells, at least in part through interactions with c-myc, to regulate a cascade of actions that may present new targeting opportunities in gynecologic cancer."

IntroductionCaenorhabditis elegans is a genetically and developmentally well characterized organism that has been used as a model to study host-pathogen interactions. The major habitat for C. elegans is soil, where it feeds on bacteria and may also come into contact with commensal or pathogenic bacteria. More than 40 pathogens are known to cause disease in C. elegans, and many of these (or their close relatives) are human pathogens. These pathogenic interactions have recently been reviewed (1Sifri C.D. Begun J. Ausubel F.M. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 119-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar).Host-pathogen interactions require bidirectional recognition factors, and often at least one of these components is a glycoconjugate (2O'Quinn A.L. Wiegand E.M. Jeddeloh J.A. Cell Microbiol. 2001; 3: 381-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Examples are recognition factors for bacterial toxins such as aerolysin from Aeromonas hydrophila, cholera from Vibrio cholerae, hemolysin from Escherichia coli, and the crystal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (3Rajamohan F. Lee M.K. Dean D.H. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 60: 1-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The last bacterium can kill C. elegans by means of a crystal toxin that causes destruction of the intestine. The effect is directly analogous to the effect of this and other Bt toxins on Lepidoptera, Diptera, and Coleoptera species, many of which are agricultural pests (4Chungjatupornchai W. Höfte H. Seurinck J. Angsuthanasombat C. Vaeck M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). C. elegans mutants that are resistant to crystal toxin are defective in the bre gene family (5Griffitts J.S. Whitacre J.L. Stevens D.E. Aroian R.V. Science. 2001; 293: 860-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 6Griffitts J.S. Huffman D.L. Whitacre J.L. Barrows B.D. Marroquin L.D. Müller R. Brown J.R. Hennet T. Esko J.D. Aroian R.V. J.

Identification of the BRE activities in C. elegans provides striking evidence of the utility of this nematode as a model organism to study the role of glycoconjugates in pathogenesis.C. elegans possesses many attributes that make it an attractive model for the study of carbohydrate-dependent host-pathogen interactions. These include 1) a sequenced genome, 2) the complete mapping of all somatic cells through development, 3) a transparent body, which confers the possibility for visualization of microbial pathogens in situ and the capacity for direct monitoring of the distribution of glycoconjugates in tissues using lectins and antibodies, 4) the existence of many glycoconjugate-deficient strains, 5) sensitivity to more than 40 bacterial pathogens, many of which also infect humans or are their close relatives, and 6) an increasingly well characterized innate immune system. These properties, when combined with the increasing capability of modern mass spectrometry to determine glycan patterns and fine structural detail and the availability of highly sophisticated genetic and molecular techniques, now make it likely that the infection can be placed in the context of its glycoconjugate requirements at the nematode's “bedside.” From that point, the distribution and identity of the required carbohydrate entities can be revealed in a tissue-specific fashion and in fine structural detail. Genetic requirements needed to facilitate the infection and the innate immune components required to combat it can also be determined.There are more than 35 members of the genus Microbacterium, some of which are human pathogens (7Gneiding K. Frodl R. Funke G. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2008; 46: 3646-3652Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The C. elegans pathogen M. nematophilum adheres to the rectal and anal region of the nematode, causing a distinct swelling in the region and surrounding tissues (8Hodgkin J. Kuwabara P.E. Corneliussen B. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1615-1618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The infection is usually non-lethal in wild type C. elegans but causes extensive larval mortality in related Caenorhabditis species or in immunocompromised C. elegans mutants (9Partridge F.A.

Genetic screens for altered susceptibility to M. nematophilum infection yielded 19 complementation groups characterized by a loss of swelling in the tail region that led to a bacterially unswollen phenotype (bus) (11Gravato-Nobre M.J.

Among these were mutants of srf-2, srf-3, and srf-5, which have previously been isolated on the basis of their altered cuticle properties, as characterized by ectopic lectin binding (13Link C.D. Silverman M.A. Breen M. Watt K.E. Dames S.A. Genetics. 1992; 131: 867-881Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although srf-2 and srf-5 have not been cloned, srf-3 encodes a UDP-Gal/UDP-GlcNAc transporter (14Hoeflich J. Berninsone P. Goebel C. Gravato-Nobre M.J. Libby B.J. Darby C. Politz S.M. Hodgkin J.

The bus-2, bus-4, bus-8, bus-12, and bus-17 mutants each harbor a genetic lesion in a different component required for glycoconjugate biosynthesis (9Partridge F.A. Tearle A.W. Gravato-Nobre M.J.

Genetics. 2007; 176: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The bus-2, bus-4, and bus-17 genes encode homologs of galactosyltransferases predicted to act in O-glycan biosynthesis. The bus-12 gene encodes a nucleotide sugar transporter homolog, and bus-8 encodes a mannosyltransferase homolog possibly active in N-glycan biosynthesis. In our previous study srf-3 strains were found to be deficient in both N- and -O-glycans (15Cipollo J.F. Awad A.M. Costello C.E. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52893-52903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The most dramatic differences were seen in O-glycans, as they were reduced 65% in overall abundance compared with the parental strain. Five genes identified in the bus screen are likely to be involved in O-glycoconjugate synthesis, including three encoding core-1 galactosyltransferases homologs and two nucleotide encoding sugar transporters. Therefore, it is hypothesized that core-1 O-glycans are required for M. nematophilum infection. Here we further investigate this possibility and the molecular basis for the carbohydrate dependence of the C. elegans–M. nematophilum pathogenic relationship by the analysis of the bus-2 mutant in comparison to its parental strain N2 Bristol.RESULTSTo summarize results the nucleic acid stain SYTO Green 13 was used to visually confirm that the bus-2 mutant had no detectable bacterial colonization in the rectal region compared with its parent strain N2 Bristol, as shown previously (11Gravato-Nobre M.J.

The bus-2 coding region was cloned and sequenced, thereby revealing an error in the earlier sequence prediction. The NCBI Conserved Domain Data base (26Marchler-Bauer A. Bryant S.H.

The improved alignment provided a score of 80.7 bits and an E value of 2e-16. Permethylation profiling by MALDI-TOF MS was used to provide robust and reproducible semiquantitative glycan data to compare abundances of these compounds in the bus-2 and parental strains (Fig. 3). Although the profiles of the N-glycans were nearly identical, those from O-glycans showed reduced abundances in Ce core-1-like O-glycans in the mutant. Additionally, a novel series of highly fucosylated O-glycans that contain an internal GlcA were discovered; in the following sections these will be referred to as Ce core-2 O-glycans. However, it must be noted that the linkages within these glycans have not been determined, and this designation is used to refer to C. elegans O-glycans containing a HexA that is proximal to the core reducing-end HexNAc. They are present at only low levels in the wild type nematode, but their abundances are increased substantially in the bus-2 strain. Tandem MS was used to determine the sequences and compositions of the new subclass of O-glycans (Table 1, Fig. 4 and supplemental Figs. S1–S3). Monosaccharide analyses of the bus-2 and parental N2 Bristol strains O-glycan pools yielded similar results; the oligosaccharide samples contained Gal, Glc, Man, GlcNAc, Fuc, and Rib, consistent with C. elegans glycoconjugates (data not shown). The GlcA and reducing end GalNAc-ol are less stable than other monosaccharide components under the conditions of analysis and were detected only in trace amounts. Rib was likely to be a contaminant from residual RNA. The amount of HexA could not be specifically determined due to the limited sample quantities, but it should be noted that C. elegans has been reported to use GlcA as its charged monosaccharide (15Cipollo J.F.

Localized glycoconjugate expression was analyzed using lectin staining experiments performed on whole mounted delipidated nematodes (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6 and supplemental Figs. S4–S6). These data indicated that, in comparison to N2 parent, the bus-2 strain was decreased in the abundance of core-1 glycans in the anus and tail region and increased in fucosylated glycans along the alimentary tract including the anal region. These alterations are significant as the tail, rectum, and anal region are normally infected. Expression analysis of bus-2 revealed that it is normally expressed in the posterior intestine as well as the hypodermal seam cells in the cuticle, both tissues that are close to and can affect the region normally infected (Fig. 7). A detailed discussion of these results appears in the following sections.FIGURE 2The bus-2 sequence and alignment with Pfam 01762.A, underlined is a cDNA segment from the bus-2 gene that was incorrectly predicted as an intron by GeneFinder.

This stain permeates cells in proportion to their surface areas and, therefore, under the conditions used here, stains the bacterial DNA preferentially. The bus-2 and wild type strains were incubated with a mixed bacterial lawn of M. nematophilum (0.1%) and OP50 for 72 h at room temperature. Nematodes were then extensively washed, incubated for an additional 60 min to assure complete digestion of microbes in the digestive tract, and extensively washed again before being stained. Fluorescent staining showed colonization of M. nematophilum in the anal region of the N2 Bristol strain but not in the bus-2 mutant, confirming that this bacterial infection cannot be detected in the bus-2 mutant.Bus-2 Contains Conserved Domains of Core Type 1 GalactosyltransferasesThe bus-2 gene, one of three bus genes to contain pfam01762 core type-1 galactosyltransferase conserved domains, is located on chromosome IV of the C. elegans genome (8Hodgkin J. Kuwabara P.E. Corneliussen B. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1615-1618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). bus-2 is absent from the open reading frame library and was, therefore, cloned from a random-primed cDNA library (29Reboul J. Vaglio P. Tzellas N. Thierry-Mieg N. Moore T. Jackson C. Shin-i T. Kohara Y. Thierry-Mieg D. Thierry-Mieg J. Lee H. Hitti J. Doucette-Stamm L. Hartley J.L. Temple G.F. Brasch M.A. Vandenhaute J.

Hodgkin, manuscript in preparation. ; it was found to have an open reading frame different from that predicted by GeneFinder. After correction of the sequence the bus-2 alignment with the galactosyltransferase domain, pfam01762 was found to be 98.0% of domain models (rather than the earlier calculated value of 63.8%), as determined by the NCBI Conserved Domain Data base (see Fig. 2) (26Marchler-Bauer A. Bryant S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W327-W331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). The score in the improved alignment was 80.7 Bits, and the expect value was 2e-16. The nucleotide and corrected protein sequence of bus-2 is deposited in GenBank™ (accession nos. Banklt 1331141; HM012823). In addition, BUS-2 contains a DXD motif (Fig. 2B), which is a hallmark of glycosyltransferases. It is conserved in 13 glycosyltransferase families (31Breton C. Mucha J. Jeanneau C. Biochimie. 2001; 83: 713-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and is required for nucleotide sugar substrate binding through metal-coordinated binding of phosphate groups (32Liu J. Mushegian A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1418-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar).The bus-2 O-Glycosylation Profile Is AlteredCe core-1 glycans have been previously described (15Cipollo J.F.

Mass Spectrom. 2007; 18: 1799-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Permethylation renders the response of glycomers in a related series to be nearly identical with respect to detection by mass spectrometry and, thus, enables reproducible and semiquantitative comparison of biologically related samples (19Ciucanu I. Costello C.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 16213-16219Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Permethylated glycan samples were analyzed in triplicate using MALDI-TOF MS, and the observed ion abundances were used to determine glycoform distribution. Analysis of peptide N-glycosidase F-released N-glycans did not reveal any significant differences between the two strains (data not shown). Through this analysis the presence of two O-glycan subfamilies was discovered. In addition to Ce core-1 compounds, the O-glycan profiles revealed the presence of a series of higher molecular weight O-glycans that were more abundant in the mutant than in the parent strain. In terms of total O-glycoform distribution, the bus-2 mutant had a significantly lower percentage of the Ce core-1 O-glycans as compared with the wild type and a greater content of the novel higher molecular weight glycans (see Fig. 3). As noted above, we refer to the new glycan series as Ce type-2 glycans. Total Ce core-1 glycans in N2 Bristol were found to constitute 73.5 ± 2.3% of the glycan pool and those from bus-2 represented 61.9 ± 1.4% of its pool, thus indicating that the latter had nearly a 12% lower content of these glycans. The level of Ce type-2 glycans increased in the bus-2 mutant from 26 ± 1.6 to 38 ± 1.5% of total ion abundance compared with the parent (see Fig. 3, inset), demonstrating a 12% higher content of this class. Individual compositions of Ce core-2 glycans were up to three times more abundant in the mutant. It should also be noted that acidic Ce core-1 glycans, which elute under higher salt conditions from the anion exchange resin used here, also had lower abundances in the bus-2 strain, indicating that all core-1 glycans were diminished in the mutant (data not shown).Structural Detail of Novel Ce Type-2 O-GlycansPermethylation renders a 14-atomic mass unit tag on all terminal residues, as all hydroxyls are replaced with O-methyl groups. At least one hydroxyl of internal residues (dependent on the number of its substituents) is involved in a glycosidic linkage and does not contain this mass tag. Because of this mass difference, it is possible to differentiate between terminal and internal substituents; this is an advantage and often key to structural assignment using permethylated oligosaccharide derivatives in contrast to derivatives that are modified only at the reducing end.Tandem MS analysis revealed the presence of a series of related highly fucosylated glycomers whose presence has not been previously described (see Table 1). Although neutral fucosylated O-glycans have been reported in C. elegans (33Barrows B.D. Haslam S.M. Bischof L.J. Morris H.R. Dell A. Aroian R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3302-3311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), tandem MS analysis of the samples examined here revealed the presence of a series of related acidic highly fucosylated glycomers that have not been previously reported. Oligosaccharide sequence information was determined using MS2 and MS3 analyses when ion abundances were sufficient. The dHex1Hex2HexNAc1HexA1, [M+Na]+m/z 1130.55, ion was analyzed, and the spectra are shown in Fig. 4. Assignment of the Hex2 branch was based on the C2α ion at m/z 463.213 and the Y3α and Y2α ions at m/z 912.437 and 708.339, respectively. These ions underwent sequential losses of two Hex residues from a linear sequence (see Table 1 and Fig. 4). The above assignments limit the position of the HexA and dHex to the core proximal HexNAc. To further define the position of these residues, MS3 experiments were performed on the Z2α fragment seen at m/z 690.328 (Fig. 4, inset). The HexA residue was thereby found to be internal and directly linked to the reducing end HexNAc on the basis of the C1β and Z1α fragments at m/z 229.175 and 472.211, respectively. The C1β fragment mass indicates that it is generated from a terminal dHex (since it contains the 14-atomic mass unit terminal tag). The Z1α fragment indicates loss of an internally linked HexA (loss of HexA not containing the 14-atomic mass unit tag) but retention of the terminal dHex linked to the core HexNAc. Together these assignments localize the HexA as internal.The dHex4Hex3HexNAc2HexA1 [M+2Na]2+m/z 1062.52 was analyzed, and the resulting spectrum is shown in supplemental Fig. S1. The presence of a dHex2Hex1HexNAc1 branch was confirmed by the loss of terminal dHex-HexNAc from the Z4α′ fragment at m/z 1272.615 and the Y3α′, B2α′/Z5α′, and Z3α′ fragments at m/z 1290.625, 628.292, and 1272.615, respectively. Assignment of the dHex-Hex branch is substantiated by the C2α″ ion at m/z 433.203. Fragmentation patterns of all the Ce type-2 saccharides studied (Table 1) were consistent with the presence of a conserved dHex1HexNAc1HexA1 core structure, as previously described herein as an internal component in the assignment of the dHex1Hex2HexNAc1HexA1 sequence above and in Fig. 4. The ion corresponding to dHex4Hex4HexNAc2HexA1, [M+2Na]2+m/z 1164.870 (supplemental Fig. S2) was also subjected to CID, and the presence of a dHex1Hex1HexNAc1 branch was supported by observation of the product ions Z3α′, Y3α′, Z4α′, Y4α′, and Z5α′, Y5α′, which indicate the positions of dHex residues. The assignment of the terminal position of the dHexHex motif was further supported by the presence of C2α′ ion at m/z 433.203. The Y3α″ fragment at m/z 1055.508 (2+) indicated the presence of a terminal Hex. The dHex5Hex4HexNAc2HexA1, [M+2Na]2+m/z 1251.61, had a mass shift corresponding to the addition of one fucose and no longer showed the loss of the non-fucosylated terminal Hex (Table 1). This supported the addition of a dHex residue to the Hex as reported here (compare the results obtained for compounds 3 and 4, Table 1). The ion at m/z 1353.67, corresponding to dHex5Hex5HexNAc2HexA1, [M+2Na]2+, was analyzed and found to have the same structure as the dHex5Hex4HexNAc2HexA1 with the addition of a terminal hexose on the HexNAc-containing branch, as supported by the reducing end fragments Y6α′ and Z6α′ and by the terminal fragments B1α′ and C1α′ (supplemental Fig. S3). A summary of the fragmentation data assignments for the above series of the fucosyl Ce type-2 O-glycans is presented in Table 1 and supplemental Figs. S1–S3. Data from all glycomers were consistent with the presence of an internal HexA and excluded the possibility of a terminal HexA indicating that these compounds are members of a biosynthetically related series and that HexA serves as a linkage point for further branch extension. C. elegans has been reported to use GlcA as its charged group (15Cipollo J.F. Awad A.M. Costello C.E. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1983424368,"Spider venoms provide a highly valuable source of peptide toxins that act on a wide diversity of membrane-bound receptors and ion channels. In this work, we report isolation, biochemical analysis, and pharmacological characterization of a novel family of spider peptide toxins, designated beta/delta-agatoxins. These toxins consist of 36-38 amino acid residues and originate from the venom of the agelenid funnel-web spider Agelena orientalis. The presented toxins show considerable amino acid sequence similarity to other known toxins such as mu-agatoxins, curtatoxins, and delta-palutoxins-IT from the related spiders Agelenopsis aperta, Hololena curta, and Paracoelotes luctuosus. beta/delta-Agatoxins modulate the insect Na(V) channel (DmNa(V)1/tipE) in a unique manner, with both the activation and inactivation processes being affected. The voltage dependence of activation is shifted toward more hyperpolarized potentials (analogous to site 4 toxins) and a non-inactivating persistent Na(+) current is induced (site 3-like action). Interestingly, both effects take place in a voltage-dependent manner, producing a bell-shaped curve between -80 and 0 mV, and they are absent in mammalian Na(V) channels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detailed report of peptide toxins with such a peculiar pharmacological behavior, clearly indicating that traditional classification of toxins according to their binding sites may not be as exclusive as previously assumed."

We investigated the potential application of the Epstein-Barr virus trans-activator ZEBRA as a transporter protein to facilitate transduction of cargo proteins. Analysis of different truncated forms of ZEBRA revealed that the minimal domain (MD) required for internalization spans residues 170–220. MD efficiently transported reporter proteins such as enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and β-galactosidase in several normal and tumor cell lines. Functionality of internalized cargo proteins was confirmed by β-galactosidase activity in transduced cells, and no MD-associated cell toxicity was detected. Translocation of MD through the cell membrane required binding to cell surface-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycans as shown by strong inhibition of protein uptake in the presence of heparin. We found that internalization was blocked at 4 °C, whereas no ATP was required as shown by an only 25% decreased uptake efficiency in energy-depleted cells. Common endocytotic inhibitors such as nystatin, chlorpromazine, and wortmannin had no significant impact on MD-EGFP uptake. Only methyl-β-cyclodextrin inhibited MD-EGFP uptake by 40%, implicating the lipid raft-mediated endocytotic pathway. These data suggest that MD-reporter protein transduction occurs mostly via direct translocation through the lipid bilayer and not by endocytosis. This mechanism of MD-mediated internalization is suitable for the efficient delivery of biologically active proteins and renders ZEBRA-MD a promising candidate for therapeutic protein delivery applications.

Dowdy S.F. Expert Opin. Drug Deliv. 2006; 3: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Coupling of CPPs to molecules such as small interfering RNA, peptide nucleic acids, and bioactive proteins facilitates delivery of therapeutic agents into live cells (2Endoh T. Sisido M. Ohtsuki T. Bioconjug. Chem. 2008; 19: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 3Abes S. Turner J.J. Ivanova G.D. Owen D. Williams D. Arzumanov A. Clair P. Gait M.J. Lebleu B.

The most intensively studied CPPs include the Tat peptide, which is derived from human immunodeficiency virus protein-1 (6Fawell S. Seery J. Daikh Y. Moore C. Chen L.L. Pepinsky B. Barsoum J. Proc.

Handbook of Cell-penetrating Peptides. 2nd Ed. Taylor and Francis Group, Boca Raton, FL2007Google Scholar). Consequently, extensive research was directed to elucidate pathways underlying protein transduction. Because of its apparent temperature and ATP dependence, it is widely assumed that cell entry occurs via endocytosis after binding of the CPP to negatively charged heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) located on the cell surface (12Richard J.P.

In addition, an alternative route of direct translocation of the small CPPs such as the SSHR-based peptide was reported (18Veach R.A. Liu D. Yao S. Chen Y. Liu X.Y. Downs S. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11425-11431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Currently, one of the major challenges for the application of CPPs is to increase endosomal escape of CPP cargoes to provide sufficient biologically active molecules at their intracellular destinations. Fusion of the CPP to pH-sensitive fusogenic peptides or co-administration of endosome-disrupting agents such as chloroquine, Ca2+, sucrose, and photosensitizers results in an enhanced release of the CPP cargoes from the endosomal compartments (19Oliveira S. Høgset A. Storm G. Schiffelers R.M. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2008; 14: 3686-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Oliveira S. van Rooy I. Kranenburg O. Storm G. Schiffelers R.M. Int. J.

Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). However, these strategies come along with considerable medical and technical disadvantages, including the cytotoxicity of the disrupting agents such as chloroquine and the problematic application of photosensitizers for in vivo protein delivery. Therefore, there is a strong need for the identification of alternative CPPs that ideally bypass the endocytotic uptake route, thereby facilitating efficient delivery of therapeutic molecules to their intracellular destinations.This study focuses on the characterization of the cell-penetrating properties of the major Epstein-Barr virus trans-activator, the ZEBRA protein (also referred to as Zta, Z, EB1, or BZLF1) (23Miller G.

The ZEBRA protein belongs to the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family of transcription factors and is responsible for the initiation of the Epstein-Barr virus lytic cycle (24Sinclair A.J. J. Gen.

Furthermore, this multifunctional protein controls its own expression, virus replication, cell cycle arrest, and DNA damage response in the host cells (24Sinclair A.J. J. Gen.

The structure of the 245-amino acid ZEBRA protein has been resolved recently in its DNA-bound form: the protein is divided into an N-terminal transactivation region and a basic DNA-binding domain flanked by a coiled-coil dimerization region (zipper). The C-terminal domain interacts with the zipper region by forming intra- and intermolecular interactions, resulting in a hydrophobic pocket (31Petosa C. Morand P. Baudin F. Moulin M. Artero J.B. Müller C.W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 565-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These complex interactions are unique among the bZIP members and result in the stabilization of the ZEBRA dimer when bound to DNA.In this work, we investigated the transduction properties of ZEBRA. We designed different truncated forms of ZEBRA to identify the minimal domain (MD) required for the delivery of different reporter proteins, including enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) and β-galactosidase, in various cell lines. The 48-amino acid bZIP region of ZEBRA (ZEBRA-MD) was shown to be sufficient to facilitate reporter protein internalization. In addition, we demonstrate that ZEBRA-MD fused to EGFP requires interaction with cell-surface HSPGs and crosses the cell membrane in a pathway largely independent of endocytosis. Taken together, our results reveal the powerful transduction properties of ZEBRA-MD, rendering it a promising candidate for the development an efficient protein delivery vector.DISCUSSIONWith the prospect of developing ZEBRA as a protein delivery tool, it was of interest to identify the minimal transduction domain required for internalization. For this reason, we engineered numerous protein truncations and characterized their transduction capacities when fused to the reporter protein EGFP. We identified three truncations of ZEBRA, namely Z4, Z6, and Z9 (MD), that had the ability to transfer EGFP into live cells. All truncations with protein translocation ability contained the basic positively charged DBD as well as the hydrophobic leucine-rich DIM domain of ZEBRA (26Sinclair A.J. Trends Microbiol. 2006; 14: 289-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 31Petosa C. Morand P. Baudin F. Moulin M. Artero J.B. Müller C.W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 565-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), whereas truncated proteins missing either of the two domains failed to translocate EGFP into cells. The 48-amino acid peptide Z9 was the smallest ZEBRA truncation with transduction abilities. It was therefore denoted the MD and further characterized regarding its uptake mechanism, functionality of delivered proteins, and cell toxicity.The uptake of MD-EGFP was temperature-dependent, presumably due to the fluidity loss of the lipid bilayer at low temperatures (18Veach R.A. Liu D. Yao S. Chen Y. Liu X.Y. Downs S. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11425-11431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because the uptake of MD-EGFP into ATP-depleted cells decreased by only 20%, we concluded that the MD fusion protein is internalized by a largely ATP-independent process. Furthermore, several endocytotic inhibitors such as nystatin, wortmannin, and chlorpromazine did not interfere with MD-EGFP uptake, indicating no participation of receptor-mediated endocytosis (12Richard J.P. Melikov K. Brooks H. Prevot P. Lebleu B. Chernomordik L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15300-15306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 15Kaplan I.M. Wadia J.S. Dowdy S.F. J. Control Release. 2005; 102: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 22Wadia J.S. Stan R.V. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar, 38Fuchs S.M. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 41Watson P. Jones A.T. Stephens D.J. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2005; 57: 43-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This finding was further supported by the lack of co-localization of MD-EGFP with caveolin-1 and clathrin. Furthermore, neither the early endosomal marker EEA1 nor the late endosomal marker Rab7, involved in the transport of cargo from early to late endosomes, showed a complete co-localization in microscopic images. Only incubation with methyl-β-cyclodextrin, a drug that inhibits lipid raft-mediated endocytosis (22Wadia J.S. Stan R.V. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar), caused a 40% decreased uptake of MD-EGFP. Thus, the endocytotic pathway may have contributed in part to the cellular uptake of MD-EGFP under the applied conditions but did not account for the majority of the internalized fusion protein. In addition, uptake of MD-EGFP required the availability of cell-surface HSPGs because its internalization was clearly impaired in the presence of heparin. Similar to other CPPs that are taken up in a HSPG-dependent manner, the cell-surface binding of MD appears to be facilitated by the interaction of the highly positively charged DBD and the negatively charged HSPGs (14Ziegler A. Seelig J. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 254-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 42Fuchs S.M. Raines R.T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 1819-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 43Zorko M. Langel U. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2005; 57: 529-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). However, as shown by the failure of the DBD-containing Z5 truncation to enable protein uptake, the presence of a positively charged domain alone is not sufficient for protein internalization. Only when the DBD was present together with the hydrophobic DIM domain was efficient protein uptake observed. It was established previously that the DBD and the DIM domain together form a continuous stretch of an α-helix (31Petosa C. Morand P. Baudin F. Moulin M. Artero J.B. Müller C.W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 565-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), which is similar to other amphipathic CPPs, including MAP and transportan (43Zorko M. Langel U. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2005; 57: 529-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 44Lindgren M. Gallet X. Soomets U. Hällbrink M. Bråkenhielm E. Pooga M. Brasseur R. Langel U. Bioconjug. Chem. 2000; 11: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For those peptides, an increase in membrane permeability that correlates with the presence of amphiphilic α-helical structures has been observed (45Dietz G.P. Bähr M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 85-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Accordingly, internalization of MD may require the α-helix formed by the DBD and the DIM domain. Furthermore, the DBD might mediate surface binding of the MD while the DIM domain subsequently facilitates translocation through the lipid bilayer by hydrophobic interactions in a similar way as reported for Penetratin (46Joliot A. Prochiantz A. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2008; 60: 608-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This CPP is internalized via a non-endocytotic and receptor- and transporter-independent pathway. Penetratin requires the hydrophobic tryptophan residues and crosses lipid bilayers without pore formation (47Thorén P.E. Persson D. Karlsson M. Nordén B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 48Terrone D. Sang S.L. Roudaia L. Silvius J.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13787-13799Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In line with these arguments, also the MD-mediated protein translocation did not cause disruption or pore formation in the plasma membrane as shown by the absence of both 7-aminoactinomycin D uptake and leakage of lactate dehydrogenase in transduced cells. Finally, we observed a direct translocation of MD-EGFP into synthetic liposomes (data not shown). Taken together, the energy-independent uptake of MD-EGFP, the decreased uptake of MD-EGFP into cells at low temperatures, the lack of exclusive co-localization with endosomal markers, and the incomplete inhibition of MD-EGFP uptake by endocytotic inhibitors suggest that MD-EGFP is translocated, at least in part, directly across the lipid bilayer. This energy-independent internalization property of ZEBRA-MD-EGFP is highly favorable because endosomal trapping can be circumvented, which seems to be the major bottleneck for most CPP, as, for example, TAT, which enters cell by macropinocytosis (15Kaplan I.M. Wadia J.S. Dowdy S.F. J. Control Release. 2005; 102: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) and fails to enter into liposomes (43Zorko M. Langel U. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2005; 57: 529-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 49Krämer S.D. Wunderli-Allenspach H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1609: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Further study to determine the amino acids from the MD responsible for the translocation properties will permit a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of ZEBRA cellular uptake.In addition, we tested the ability of the truncated ZEBRA proteins to bind DNA. As we expected, constructs encompassing both the basic DBD and the DIM domain recognized and bound the AP-1 site in vitro. Interestingly, this specific binding was lost when these proteins were fused at the C terminus with either EGFP or β-galactosidase. As was shown in the crystal structure of ZEBRA bound to the AP-1 promoter element, DNA binding of the protein requires complex conformation of its C-terminal part, and mutations in the latter were suggested to inactivate the transcription factor activity of ZEBRA (31Petosa C. Morand P. Baudin F. Moulin M. Artero J.B. Müller C.W. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 565-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, the C-terminal fusion of proteins to truncated forms of ZEBRA may have compromised its ability to form DNA-protein complexes. The loss of its DNA binding activity when fused to proteins is certainly a tremendous advantage for the development of a new potential protein delivery system. However, a possible interaction between ZEBRA-MD and cellular proteins after its cellular uptake cannot be completely ruled out because it was not examined in this study. As the full-length ZEBRA protein can induce growth arrest independently of its ability to bind DNA in host cells through direct interplay with cellular proteins and its basic region (27Rodriguez A. Armstrong M. Dwyer D. Flemington E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9029-9038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Rodriguez A. Jung E.J. Yin Q. Cayrol C. Flemington E.K. Virology. 2001; 284: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), possible interaction with cellular proteins and control of their activities need to be further analyzed.In addition to the previously reported lymphocyte-specific uptake of ZEBRA (25Mahot S. Fender P. Vivès R.R. Caron C. Perrissin M. Gruffat H. Sergeant A. Drouet E. Virus Res. 2005; 110: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we observed a rapid internalization of MD-EGFP into a wide range of different cells. MD-delivered proteins remained functional when transduced into cells, as demonstrated by the enzymatic activity of internalized MD-β-galactosidase. In conclusion, the MD is a new carrier suitable for the efficient transport of proteins into live mammalian cells. Because its uptake is largely independent of known endocytotic pathways, ZEBRA-MD can carry proteins into cells without being trapped in endosomal compartments. Additionally, it does not show any toxic side effects and transduces a wide range of mammalian cells with 100% efficiency. Taken all together, these favorable biochemical properties of ZEBRA-MD indicate that ZEBRA represents a novel and powerful delivery system for therapeutic proteins. IntroductionRecently, cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) 2The abbreviations used are: CPPcell-penetrating peptideHSPGheparan sulfate proteoglycanbZIPbasic leucine zipperMDminimal domainEGFPenhanced green fluorescence proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salineEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayX-gal5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranosideDBDDNA-binding domainDIMdimerization. were discovered that have the ability to cross lipid bilayers of mammalian cells, which naturally constitute a tight biological barrier allowing only the uptake of non-polar molecules <500 Da into the cell (1Murriel C.L. Dowdy S.F. Expert Opin. Drug Deliv. 2006; 3: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Coupling of CPPs to molecules such as small interfering RNA, peptide nucleic acids, and bioactive proteins facilitates delivery of therapeutic agents into live cells (2Endoh T. Sisido M. Ohtsuki T.

The most intensively studied CPPs include the Tat peptide, which is derived from human immunodeficiency virus protein-1 (6Fawell S. Seery J. Daikh Y. Moore C. Chen L.L. Pepinsky B. Barsoum J. Proc.

Joliot A.H. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and the VP22 peptide of the herpes simplex virus (9Elliott G. O'Hare P.

Chem. 2007; 282: 27503-27517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).The activity of therapeutic molecules depends on their availability and functionality after their delivery into cells, both of which are determined by the transduction mechanism of the particular CPP (11Langel Ü. Handbook of Cell-penetrating Peptides. 2nd Ed. Taylor and Francis Group, Boca Raton, FL2007Google Scholar). Consequently, extensive research was directed to elucidate pathways underlying protein transduction. Because of its apparent temperature and ATP dependence, it is widely assumed that cell entry occurs via endocytosis after binding of the CPP to negatively charged heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) located on the cell surface (12Richard J.P. Melikov K. Brooks H. Prevot P. Lebleu B. Chernomordik L.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15300-15306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 13Lundberg P. Langel U. J. Mol.

Tat fusion proteins were shown to be internalized via macropinocytosis, whereas different endocytotic pathways such as clathrin-dependent or caveolin-dependent endocytosis were shown to be implicated in the transport of other CPPs (10Nishi K. Saigo K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27503-27517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 12Richard J.P. Melikov K. Brooks H. Prevot P. Lebleu B. Chernomordik L.V. J. Biol.

In addition, an alternative route of direct translocation of the small CPPs such as the SSHR-based peptide was reported (18Veach R.A. Liu D. Yao S. Chen Y. Liu X.Y. Downs S. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11425-11431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Currently, one of the major challenges for the application of CPPs is to increase endosomal escape of CPP cargoes to provide sufficient biologically active molecules at their intracellular destinations. Fusion of the CPP to pH-sensitive fusogenic peptides or co-administration of endosome-disrupting agents such as chloroquine, Ca2+, sucrose, and photosensitizers results in an enhanced release of the CPP cargoes from the endosomal compartments (19Oliveira S. Høgset A. Storm G. Schiffelers R.M. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2008; 14: 3686-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Oliveira S. van Rooy I. Kranenburg O. Storm G. Schiffelers R.M. Int. J.

Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). However, these strategies come along with considerable medical and technical disadvantages, including the cytotoxicity of the disrupting agents such as chloroquine and the problematic application of photosensitizers for in vivo protein delivery. Therefore, there is a strong need for the identification of alternative CPPs that ideally bypass the endocytotic uptake route, thereby facilitating efficient delivery of therapeutic molecules to their intracellular destinations.This study focuses on the characterization of the cell-penetrating properties of the major Epstein-Barr virus trans-activator, the ZEBRA protein (also referred to as Zta, Z, EB1, or BZLF1) (23Miller G.

https://openalex.org/W2050717486,"The scaffold proteins connector enhancer of KSR (CNK) participate in Raf-, Rho- and NF-kappaB-dependent signalling and promote cell differentiation and invasion. In this study, we demonstrate that CNK1 downregulation inhibits, whereas CNK1 overexpression stimulates the proliferation of breast cancer cells and human embryonic kidney cells, respectively. This stimulatory effect depends on a functional phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway because treatment of cells with the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, abrogates CNK1-induced proliferation. CNK1 interacts with the PI3K effector Akt and knockdown of CNK1 decreases Akt activity in breast cancer cells. CNK1 controls Akt-dependent phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of FoxO, which is a negative regulator of proliferation. Consistent with this, CNK1-induced cell proliferation is blocked by FoxO overexpression. Moreover, CNK1 regulates anchorage-independent proliferation and focus formation of breast cancer cells. CNK1 is predominantly localized at the plasma membrane of breast cancer cells, whereas in non-transformed mammary epithelial cells, CNK1 is cytoplasmatic. Accordingly, CNK1 is found preferentially at the plasma membrane in carcinoma in situ and invasive breast cancer tumours compared with normal breast tissue sections. Analysis of multiple breast cancer samples reveals that CNK1-negative tumours show less Akt activity. Thus, CNK1 promotes oncogenic signalling through Akt in breast cancer cell lines and tumours."

A greater prevalence is reported in Africans and African descendent groups than in Caucasians and Hispanics. We first fine mapped the interval 1q24.2 to 1q31.3 suggested as containing an aggressive periodontitis locus. Three hundred and eighty-nine subjects from 55 pedigrees were studied. Saliva samples were collected from all subjects, and DNA was extracted. Twenty-one single nucleotide polymorphisms were selected and analyzed by standard polymerase chain reaction using TaqMan chemistry. Non-parametric linkage and transmission distortion analyses were performed. Although linkage results were negative, statistically significant association between two markers, rs1935881 and rs1342913, in the FAM5C gene and aggressive periodontitis (p = 0.03) was found. Haplotype analysis showed an association between aggressive periodontitis and the haplotype A-G (rs1935881-rs1342913; p = 0.009). Sequence analysis of FAM5C coding regions did not disclose any mutations, but two variants in conserved intronic regions of FAM5C, rs57694932 and rs10494634, were found. However, these two variants are not associated with aggressive periodontitis. Secondly, we investigated the pattern of FAM5C expression in aggressive periodontitis lesions and its possible correlations with inflammatory/immunological factors and pathogens commonly associated with periodontal diseases. FAM5C mRNA expression was significantly higher in diseased versus healthy sites, and was found to be correlated to the IL-1beta, IL-17A, IL-4 and RANKL mRNA levels. No correlations were found between FAM5C levels and the presence and load of red complex periodontopathogens or Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. This study provides evidence that FAM5C contributes to aggressive periodontitis."
https://openalex.org/W1985312405,"HIBM (Hereditary Inclusion Body Myopathy) is a recessive hereditary disease characterized by adult-onset, slowly progressive muscle weakness sparing the quadriceps. It is caused by a single missense mutation of each allele of the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) gene, a bifunctional enzyme catalyzing the first two steps of sialic acid synthesis in mammals. However, the mechanisms and cellular pathways affected by the GNE mutation and causing the muscle weakness could not be identified so far. Based on recent evidence in literature, we investigated a new hypothesis, i.e. the involvement in the disease of the GM3 ganglioside, a specific glycolipid implicated in muscle cell proliferation and differentiation.qRT-PCR analysis of St3gal5 (GM3 synthase) gene expression and HPLC quantification of GM3 ganglioside were conducted on muscle tissue from a mouse model of HIBM harboring the M712T mutation of GNE (Gne(M712T/M712T) mouse) vs control mice (Gne(+/+) mouse).St3gal5 mRNA levels were significantly lower in Gne(M712T/M712T) mouse muscles vs Gne(+/+) mouse muscles (64.41%+/-10% of Gne(+/+) levels). GM3 ganglioside levels showed also a significant decrease in Gne(M712T/M712T) mouse muscle compared to Gne(+/+) mouse muscle (18.09%+/-5.33% of Gne(+/+) levels). Although these Gne(M712T/M712T) mice were described to suffer severe glomerular proteinuria, no GM3 alterations were noted in kidneys, highlighting a tissue specific alteration of gangliosides.The M712T mutation of GNE hampers the muscle ability to synthesize normal levels of GM3.

https://openalex.org/W2091507191,"Cohesins appear to have critical functions beyond mitotic cohesion. Our data on a cohesin-associated Pds5-paralog, APRIN, indicate a novel cohesin role in stem cell differentiation. APRIN/Pds5B is lost in many cancers and it is a putative tumor suppressor. Its mutations in the germ line, however, generate birth defects. We reasoned that as both cancer and birth defects share disrupted stem cell differentiation, the data suggest an APRIN/Pds5B cohesin function in stem cells. We used an embryonal carcinoma stem cell model and show here that (i) APRIN expression is precisely coordinated with stem cell differentiation; (ii) this coordination involves surface-contact and endocrine pathways; and (iii) APRIN/Pds5b coordination is critical in stem/progenitor exit decisions. APRIN knockdown disrupted Oct4, Nanog and SOX2 patterns, differentiation failed and the resulting immature proliferative cells did not progress beyond proneural progenitor phase. Furthermore, the phenotype—blocked progenitor exit (Mash-1+); failed E-cadherin exit (E-Cadhlow+); incomplete N-cadherin transition (N-Cadhlow+); retained proliferative capacity (c-myc+); irregular stemness (SOX2late++) and lost response to contact and hormonal cues—shares similarities with cancer-initiating cells. The data suggest novel APRIN/Pds5B-linked cohesin roles in stem/progenitor programs and a new mechanism in tumor suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2159842467,"Female African elephants signal oestrus via chemicals in their urine, but they also exhibit characteristic changes to their posture, gait and behaviour when sexually receptive. Free-ranging females visually signal receptivity by holding their heads and tails high, walking with an exaggerated gait, and displaying increased tactile behaviour towards males. Parous females occasionally exhibit these visual signals at times when they are thought not to be cycling and without attracting interest from musth males. Using demographic and behavioural records spanning a continuous 28-year period, we investigated the occurrence of this ""simulated"" oestrus behaviour. We show that parous females in the Amboseli elephant population do simulate receptive oestrus behaviours, and this false oestrus occurs disproportionately in the presence of naïve female kin who are observed coming into oestrus for the first time. We compare several alternative hypotheses for the occurrence of this simulation: 1) false oestrus has no functional purpose (e.g., it merely results from abnormal hormonal changes); 2) false oestrus increases the reproductive success of the simulating female, by inducing sexual receptivity; and 3) false oestrus increases the inclusive fitness of the simulating female, either by increasing the access of related females to suitable males, or by encouraging appropriate oestrus behaviours from female relatives who are not responding correctly to males. Although the observed data do not fully conform to the predictions of any of these hypotheses, we rule out the first two, and tentatively suggest that parous females most likely exhibit false oestrus behaviours in order to demonstrate to naïve relatives at whom to direct their behaviour."

The timing and amount of exposure cannot fully explain the substantial variability among affected individuals, pointing to genetic influences that mediate fetal vulnerability. However, the aspects of vulnerability that depend on the mother, the father, or both, are not known. Methodology/Principal Findings Using the outbred Sprague-Dawley (SD) and inbred Brown Norway (BN) rat strains as well as their reciprocal crosses, we administered ethanol (E), pair-fed (PF), or control (C) diets to the pregnant dams. The dams' plasma levels of free thyroxine (fT4), triiodothyronine (T3), free T3 (fT3), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were measured to elucidate potential differences in maternal thyroid hormonal environment, which affects specific aspects of FASD. We then compared alcohol-exposed, pair fed, and control offspring of each fetal strain on gestational day 21 (G21) to identify maternal and paternal genetic effects on bodyweight and placental weight of male and female fetuses. Conclusions SD and BN dams exhibited different baseline hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid function. Moreover, the thyroid function of SD dams was more severely affected by alcohol consumption while that of BN dams was relatively resistant. This novel finding suggests that genetic differences in maternal thyroid function are one source of maternal genetic effects on fetal vulnerability to FASD. The fetal vulnerability to decreased bodyweight after alcohol exposure depended on the genetic contribution of both parents, not only maternal contribution as previously thought. In contrast, the effect of maternal alcohol consumption on placental weight was consistent and not strain-dependent. Interestingly, placental weight in fetuses with different paternal genetic contributions exhibited opposite responses to caloric restriction (pair feeding). In summary, these novel findings demonstrate both maternal and paternal genetic contributions to in utero vulnerability to alcohol, refining our understanding of the genetically-based heterogeneity seen in human FASD."
https://openalex.org/W2003092924,"Nonenveloped virus must penetrate the cellular membrane to access the cytoplasm without the benefit of membrane fusion. For birnavirus, one of the peptides present in the virus capsid, pep46 for infectious bursal disease virus, is able to induce pores into membranes as an intermediate step of the birnavirus-penetration pathway. Using osmotic protection experiments, we demonstrate here that pep46 and its pore-forming N-terminal moiety (pep22) form pores of different diameters, 5-8 and 2-4 nm, respectively, showing that both pep46 moieties participate to pore formation. The solution structures of pep46, pep22, and pep24 (the pep46 C-terminal moiety) in different hydrophobic environments and micelles determined by (1)H NMR studies provide structural insights of the pep46 domain interaction. In CDCl(3)/CD(3)OH mixture and in dodecylphosphocholine micelles, the N-terminal domain of pep46 is structured in a long kinked helix, although the C terminus is structured in one or two helices depending upon the solvents used. We also show that the folding and the proline isomerization status of pep46 depend on the type of hydrophobic environment. NMR spectroscopy with labeled phospholipid micelles, differential scanning calorimetry, and plasmon waveguide resonance studies show the peptides lie parallel to the lipid-water interface, perturbing the fatty acid chain packing. All these data lead to a model in which the two domains of pep46 interact with the membrane to form pores."
https://openalex.org/W1963958670,"Background The 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic has generated thousands of articles and news items. However, finding relevant scientific articles in such rapidly developing health crises is a major challenge which, in turn, can affect decision-makers' ability to utilise up-to-date findings and ultimately shape public health interventions. This study set out to show the impact that the inconsistent naming of the pandemic can have on retrieving relevant scientific articles in PubMed/MEDLINE. Methodology We first formulated a PubMed search algorithm covering different names of the influenza pandemic and simulated the results that it would have retrieved from weekly searches for relevant new records during the first 10 weeks of the pandemic. To assess the impact of failing to include every term in this search, we then conducted the same searches but omitted in turn “h1n1,” “swine,” “influenza” and “flu” from the search string, and compared the results to those for the full string. Principal Findings On average, our core search string identified 44.3 potentially relevant new records at the end of each week. Of these, we determined that an average of 27.8 records were relevant. When we excluded one term from the string, the percentage of records missed out of the total number of relevant records averaged 18.7% for omitting “h1n1,” 13.6% for “swine,” 17.5% for “influenza,” and 20.6% for “flu.” Conclusions Due to inconsistent naming, while searching for scientific material about rapidly evolving situations such as the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, there is a risk that one will miss relevant articles. To address this problem, the international scientific community should agree on nomenclature and the specific name to be used earlier, and the National Library of Medicine in the US could index potentially relevant materials faster and allow publishers to add alert tags to such materials."
https://openalex.org/W2027402144,"The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) prevents anaphase onset until all the chromosomes have successfully attached to the spindle microtubules. The MAP kinase (MAPK) is an important player in this pathway, however its exact role is not fully understood. One major target of MAPK is the p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RSKs) family. In this study, we analyse whether Rsk2 could participate in the activation of the SAC. Our data indicate that this protein is localized at the kinetochores under checkpoint conditions. Moreover, it is essential for the SAC activity in Xenopus egg extracts as its depletion prevents metaphase arrest as well as the kinetochore localization of the other SAC components. We also show that this kinase might also participate in the maintenance of the SAC in mammalian cells as Rsk2 knockdown in these cells prevents the kinetochore localization of Mad1, Mad2 and CENP-E under checkpoint conditions."

Like several other members of the ADP-ribosyl cyclase superfamily, SpARC4 is a glycoprotein targeted to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. However, unlike most other members, SpARC4 shows a remarkable preference for producing cyclic ADP-ribose over nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate. Mutation of a single residue (tyrosine 142) within a noncanonical active site reversed this striking preference. Our data highlight further diversification of this unusual enzyme family, provide mechanistic insight into multifunctionality, and suggest that different ADP-ribosyl cyclases are fine-tuned to produce specific calcium-mobilizing messengers.

IntroductionChanges in cytosolic calcium levels govern a multitude of cellular processes. Many extracellular stimuli mediate complex changes in calcium through production of second messengers (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4361) Google Scholar). These molecules effect release of calcium from intracellular stores. In addition to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, both cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) 3The abbreviations used are: cADPRcyclic ADP-riboseNAADPnicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphateHEKhuman embryonic kidneyPBSphosphate-buffered salineRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsGPIglycosylphosphatidylinositolHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolPI-PLCphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase CPNGase-Fpeptide:N-glycosidase-FRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsNACENAD(P)+-catabolizing enzyme. and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) play critical roles in the generation of agonist-evoked calcium signals (2Lee H.C.

The mechanism of action of NAADP is less certain (5Guse A.H. Curr.

Remarkably, both cADPR and NAADP are synthesized by the same family of enzymes, the ADP-ribosyl cyclases (13Lee H.C. Munshi C. Graeff R. Mol. Cell.

Somewhat paradoxically, many members of the ADP-ribosyl cyclase family, including CD38, the most extensively studied, are located predominantly on the cell surface and therefore away from their cytosolic substrates (13Lee H.C.

This topological barrier, however, is circumvented through identified transporter molecules that mediate both substrate efflux and product influx across the plasma membrane (26De Flora A. Zocchi E. Guida L. Franco L. Bruzzone S. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1028: 176-191PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have also shown that members of the sea urchin ADP-ribosyl cyclase family are present within intracellular organelles where again they are able to access cytosolic substrates through presumed transporters (25Churamani D. Boulware M.J. Geach T.J. Martin A.C. Moy G.W. Su Y.H. Vacquier V.D. Marchant J.S. Dale L. Patel S. PLoS. ONE. 2007; 2: e797Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 27Davis L.C. Morgan A.J. Ruas M.

It therefore appears that not all ADP-ribosyl cyclases have been described yet at the molecular level.ADP-ribosyl cyclases show only modest sequence similarity (30–40%). However, their overall three-dimensional structures, where known, are almost identical (45Prasad G.S. McRee D.E. Stura E.A. Levitt D.G. Lee H.C. Stout C.D. Nat. Struct.

Despite this conservation in three-dimensional structures, ADP-ribosyl cyclases show remarkable differences in their catalytic properties. For example, Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase produces primarily cADPR from NAD (18Hellmich M.R. Strumwasser F. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 20Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), and in contrast, CD38 possesses robust NAD glycohydrolase activity (22Howard M. Grimaldi J.C. Bazan J.F. Lund F.E. Santos-Argumedo L. Parkhouse R.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. Science. 1993; 262: 1056-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) thereby producing predominantly ADP-ribose and only modest amounts of cADPR (2–3% of reaction products). Additionally, CD38 is capable of hydrolyzing cADPR directly to ADP-ribose, whereas Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase is comparatively a very poor cADPR hydrolase (13Lee H.C. Munshi C. Graeff R. Mol. Cell.

Notably, ADP-ribose also modulates calcium fluxes through regulation of the transient receptor potential channel and TRPM2 present in the plasma membrane (51Perraud A.L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A.

Intriguingly, although glycohydrolase activity is very low for Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase using the natural substrate, NAD, this activity is unmasked by the introduction into its structure of an additional cystine pair, as found in CD38 (56Tohgo A. Takasawa S. Noguchi N. Koguma T. Nata K. Sugimoto T. Furuya Y. Yonekura H. Okamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28555-28557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and also by using a fluorinated analogue of NAD that cannot be cyclized (57Zhang B. Muller-Steffner H. Schuber F. Potter B.V. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 4100-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). NAD glycohydrolase activity can also be readily detected in Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase upon mutation of phenylalanine 174, which together with the associated reduction in cyclase activity results in a mutant enzyme displaying properties reminiscent of CD38 (58Graeff R.

Conversely, mutation of the corresponding residue (threonine 221) in CD38 increases cyclase activity at the expense of NAD glycohydrolase activity. Indeed, the concomitant mutation of this residue and of glutamate 146, a residue previously implicated in determining the cyclase/NAD glycohydrolase ratio (59Graeff R. Munshi C. Aarhus R. Johns M. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12169-12173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), results in a catalytic profile very similar to that of Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase, including poor cADPR hydrolase activity (58Graeff R.

Mutagenesis of the SmNACE has also resulted in the identification of a single residue that increases ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity (60Kuhn I. Kellenberger E. Rognan D. Lund F.E. Muller-Steffner H. Schuber F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 11867-11878Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Although ADP-ribosyl cyclases are capable of synthesis of both cADPR and NAADP, how messenger production is controlled in vivo is not clear. It is possible that the activities of the same enzyme may be differentially regulated. Alternatively, different homologues may be endowed with different relative activities. Here, we report the molecular cloning of SpARC4, a novel member of the ADP-ribosyl cyclase family from the sea urchin, and we show that this protein is a GPI-anchored plasma membrane glycoprotein capable of synthesizing both cADPR and NAADP. In contrast to other ADP-ribosyl cyclases, and in analogy with the Aplysia enzyme, SpARC4 preferentially produces cADPR. We identify a unique acidic-basic cluster of amino acids within the N terminus and a nonconserved tyrosine residue within the active site. Whereas manipulation of the former had little impact on catalysis, tyrosine 142 was found to control the relative production of cADPR and NAADP such that its mutation was sufficient to convert SpARC4 into an enzyme that preferentially produces NAADP.RESULTSOur original BLAST queries of the S. purpuratus genome with known ADP-ribosyl cyclase sequences led to the isolation of SpARC1–3 (25Churamani D. Boulware M.J. Geach T.J. Martin A.C. Moy G.W. Su Y.H. Vacquier V.D. Marchant J.S. Dale L. Patel S. PLoS. ONE. 2007; 2: e797Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here, we report the molecular cloning of a new ADP-ribosyl cyclase herein named SpARC4. The full-length coding sequence was determined using a combination of 5′- and 3′-RACE (see “Materials and Methods”). SpARC4 is predicted to encode a polypeptide comprising 343 amino acids. An alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of SpARC4 with those of SpARC1–3 is shown in Fig. 1A. Sequence identity between SpARC4 and other family members was ∼25% and sequence similarity was ∼40% (Fig. 1B). We also identified three expressed sequence tags from the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus that were 65–66% identical and 74% similar to SpARC4 (supplemental Fig. S1). The 10 “core” cysteine residues found in Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase are conserved in SpARC4 (Fig. 1A, asterisks). These data further highlight expansion of the ADP-ribosyl cyclase family.SpARC4 is predicted to have an N-terminal signal peptide of 34 residues, three N-linked glycosylation sites (one within the putative signal peptide), and a C-terminal GPI anchor (Fig. 1A). The predicted structure of SpARC4 is schematically depicted in Fig. 2A. To define the properties of SpARC4, the series of expression constructs represented in Fig. 2B were generated. We first expressed the full-length Myc-tagged SpARC4 (SpARC4 Myc) in Xenopus embryos and HEK cells (Fig. 2C). Western blot analysis using an anti-Myc antibody revealed the presence of a major polypeptide of ∼55 kDa in embryos expressing SpARC4 Myc (Fig. 2C). The apparent molecular mass of SpARC4 Myc was modestly reduced following treatment of homogenates with PNGase-F, which releases N-linked glycans (Fig. 2C). The size of the PNGase-F-treated protein was in reasonable agreement with the predicted molecular mass of mature SpARC4 Myc (44 kDa). In HEK cells expressing SpARC4 Myc, two major bands of ∼55 and 45 kDa were observed (Fig. 2C). Treatment with PNGase-F reduced the apparent molecular mass of the larger band, but the migration of the lower band was not affected. The identity of the latter remains to be established but may correspond to unprocessed SpARC4. These data indicate that SpARC4 is N-glycosylated, consistent with the presence of consensus N-glycosylation sites.To determine the subcellular localization of SpARC4, we performed immunocytochemical analysis in conjunction with confocal microscopy. Fig. 2D shows the distribution of SpARC4 Myc expressed in Xenopus embryos. Two patterns were observed as follows: clear cell surface staining (Fig. 2D, top left) or a punctate intracellular distribution often concentrated at the periphery (Fig. 2F, top right). In these experiments, only a single blastomere of a 2–4-cell embryo was injected to effect mosaic expression. Indeed, cells that did not express the protein were clearly evident in embryos (Fig. 2D, asterisks), thereby defining background staining and thus attesting to the specificity of the labeling. In HEK cells, SpARC4 localized mainly to the plasma membrane, although diffuse intracellular staining was also evident (Fig. 2D, bottom left). Localizations were also performed using intact (nonpermeabilized) cells (Fig. 2D, bottom right). Surface staining was readily detectable indicating that the epitope is extracellular, further confirming plasma membrane residence of this protein.Given the consensus sequence for GPI anchoring, we next examined the effect of bacterial PI-PLC, which releases GPI-anchored proteins from the plasma membrane. We first treated cells expressing SpARC4 Myc with PI-PLC and analyzed the media for SpARC immunoreactivity by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3A, this treatment resulted in the appearance of released SpARC4 Myc in the medium. These data suggest that SpARC4 is attached to the plasma membrane by a GPI anchor. In parallel experiments, we examined cell surface expression of SpARC4 Myc by immunocytochemistry. As shown in Fig. 3B, PI-PLC treatment caused a reduction in expression of SpARC4, again consistent with the presence of a GPI anchor. Finally, we deleted the C terminus harboring the putative GPI-anchoring site and compared secretion of the full-length and truncated SpARC4 Myc. As shown in Fig. 3C, SpARC4 ΔC Myc was present in the medium at higher levels than the full-length construct. Both constructs were expressed at comparable levels within cells (data not shown). These data suggest that SpARC4 is attached to the plasma membrane at its C terminus via a GPI anchor.FIGURE 3SpARC4 is a GPI-anchored protein. HEK cells expressing SpARC4 Myc were treated with (+) or without (−) PI-PLC, and the presence of SpARC4 was determined in media samples by Western blot analysis (A) and on the cell surface by immunocytochemistry (B).

Boulware M.J. Geach T.J. Martin A.C. Moy G.W. Su Y.H. Vacquier V.D. Marchant J.S. Dale L. Patel S. PLoS. ONE. 2007; 2: e797Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here, we use the same approach to characterize SpARC4. In the first set of experiments, homogenates expressing SpARC4 Myc were incubated with NAD. As shown in the HPLC in Fig. 4A, NAD, after a 3-h incubation, was converted to a product with retention time of 17.7 ± 0.14 min corresponding to that of cADPR (17.3 ± 0.1 min). ADP-ribose production was not routinely detected (retention time = 26 min) under these experimental conditions. We next tested whether SpARC4 could generate NAADP. For these experiments, homogenates were incubated with NADP and nicotinic acid under acidic conditions to favor the base-exchange reaction. As shown in Fig. 4B, NADP, after a 3-h incubation, was converted to a product (retention time = 31.4 ± 0.04 min) that co-eluted with NAADP (retention time = 31.3 ± 0.03 min). Thus, SpARC4 was capable of both the cyclization and base-exchange reactions indicating that it is a bona fide multifunctional ADP-ribosyl cyclase.FIGURE 4SpARC4 is a multifunctional ADP-ribosyl cyclase.
