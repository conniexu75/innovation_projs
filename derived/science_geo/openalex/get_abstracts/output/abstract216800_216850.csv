 the transformation of amphetamine in rabbits to rats, dogs, and guinea pigs. The subject of the article originated in Axelrod's
 curiosity as to why when amphetamine was administered to rabbits it disappeared entirely. Axelrod found in this article that
 one or several enzymes in a rabbit's liver deaminated amphetamine, leading to the formation of phenylacetone and ammonia.
 He also determined that ephedrine was similarly demethylated to norephedrine and formaldehyde by the microsomal drug metabolizing
 enzymes."

That the fungus produces certain phytotoxins in vitro and that one of them, namely, fusaric acid, possesses antibacterial properties also, has been reported earlier2. The present investigation has revealed a further relationship between zinc concentrations in a purified medium and antibiotic production."

This method does not require an organic cooling liquid, such as monochlorobenzene1. It may be useful for the separation of enzyme mixtures, where contact with organic liquid may inactivate the enzymes."
