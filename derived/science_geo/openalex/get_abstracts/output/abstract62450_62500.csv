https://openalex.org/W1561167748,"Abstract N-(Phosphonacetyl)-l-aspartate (PALA) is a stable analogue of the transition state in the reaction catalyzed by aspartate transcarbamylase from Escherichia coli; it combines in 1 molecule most of the structural features of the two natural substrates, carbamyl phosphate and l-aspartate. The inhibition constant (Ki) for PALA with the catalytic subunit is 2.7 x 10-8m at 28° and pH 7.0 in 0.2 m imidazole acetate; the value of Ki is approximately the same with the native enzyme. PALA binds to aspartate transcarbamylase about 1000 times more tightly than carbamyl phosphate, the substrate bound most tightly. In addition to tight binding, other data indicate that PALA interacts with the enzyme at both the carbamyl phosphate and l-aspartate sites simultaneously and puts the enzyme into the same contracted conformation as do carbamyl phosphate and succinate (an analogue of l-aspartate) acting together. PALA alone or carbamyl phosphate and succinate together produce the same ultraviolet difference spectrum with the catalytic subunit; the binding of PALA alone or carbamyl phosphate and succinate together at some of the catalytic sites in the native enzyme activates the remaining catalytic sites to the same extent. PALA gives competitive inhibition with carbamyl phosphate but not with l-aspartate, indicating an obligatory binding order for the substrates: carbamyl phosphate must bind before l-aspartate for catalysis to occur. Titration of the catalytic subunit with PALA, monitored by ultraviolet difference spectroscopy, indicates that there are 3.07 active sites per 100,000 daltons. The interaction of PALA with the enzyme is consistent with the compression model for aspartate transcarbamylase previously proposed (Collins, K.D., and Stark, G.R., J. Biol. Chem., 244, 1869 (1969))."

https://openalex.org/W1554882129,"Abstract A new procedure is described for the isolation on a preparative scale of a hypothalamic decapeptide which stimulates the release of both luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary. The isolation was achieved mainly by countercurrent distribution. The yield from 240,000 porcine hypothalami was 11.4 mg. Thin layer chromatography and electrophoresis showed the material to be homogeneous. The amino acid analyses showed the presence of 2 residues of glycine and 1 residue each of histidine, arginine, tryptophan, serine, glutamic acid, proline, leucine, and tyrosine. This decapeptide stimulates release of both LH and FSH in vivo as well as in vitro in doses smaller than 1 ng. It is thought to be the hypothalamic hormone which controls secretion of both LH and FSH from the pituitary gland."

https://openalex.org/W1564639022,"The enzymic synthesis of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate (ES-3-P) from enolpyruvate phosphate (labeled with 18O in the C-O-P oxygen) and shikimate 3-phosphate occurred with C-O cleavage of the pyruvate ester. ES-3-P formed in a D2O reaction medium showed incorporation of approximately 1.3 atoms of deuterium, and consisted of 39% d2 molecules, 53% d1, and 8% d0. Enolpyruvate phosphate isolated from the same reaction mixture had 0.72 atom of deuterium with a similar d2:d1 ratio. In both compounds, the nuclear magnetic resonances of the vinyl methylene protons were diminished equally in intensity. ES-3-P formed in a tritiated medium contained 0.42 atom of 3H in the vinyl methylene hydrogens. A reversible addition-elimination mechanism is proposed in which protonation of carbon 3 of enolpyruvate phosphate is associated with a nucleophilic attack on carbon 2 by the 5-hydroxyl group of shikimate 3-phosphate. A methyl group of unrestricted rotation is formed in the resulting postulated intermediate. Elimination of orthophosphate then yields ES-3-P, and elimination of shikimate 3-phosphate yields enolpyruvate phosphate. A procedure was developed for preparing enolpyruvate phosphate with 18O in the C-O-P oxygen. The isolation of shikimate 3-phosphate was improved. ES-3-P synthetase from Salmonella was purified 80-fold by a simple procedure."

The Edman dansyl procedure was used on the intact peptide and on fragments isolated from tryptic and papain digests. The sequence found was confirmed by the results of digestion with aminopeptidase M, leucine aminopeptidase, and carboxypeptidase A and B. On the basis of these studies the sequence of the decapeptide was established to be [see PDF for sequence]."

https://openalex.org/W1588694300,"Abstract Protein 315, a mouse myeloma IgA protein which binds nitrophenyl ligands, and its pepsin-produced Fab' fragment have been purified by affinity chromatography. The Fab' fragments were found to be homogeneous by polyacrylamide electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing, and to possess a uniform binding constant. These fragments were readily crystallizable at low salt concentration near their isoelectric point (pH 4.7). Similarly crystals can be obtained of the Fab'-hapten complex. Such crystals have a 1:1 molar ratio of hapten (e, N-dinitrophenyl lysine) to protein."
https://openalex.org/W1572204851,"A highly purified DNA-polymerase has been isolated from normal and regenerating rat liver by differential ultracentrifugation, acid precipitation, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and chromatography on phosphocellulose and on DNA-cellulose. The molecular weight of the enzyme is estimated to be 49,000. Enzyme purified in this manner has no detectable terminal transferase, exonuclease, and endonuclease activities. Polymerase activity is absolutely dependent upon the addition of DNA and is maximal in the presence of all four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. The pH optimum of the enzyme is 7.7 in Tris-HCl buffer, and the optimum Mg2+ concentration is 10 m m . Enzyme activity is inhibited 50% by 0.03 m ammonium sulfate and 94% by 3 x 10-4 m p-chloromercuribenzoate, and is not inhibited by 10 µ m ethidium bromide. Synthesis proceeds for a longer period of time in the presence of 0.2 m KCl. Neither native DNA nor denatured DNA serves effectively as a template for the enzyme. Native DNA which has been partially digested with pancreatic DNase, poly[d(A-T)] and crab d(A-T) are effective templates. With crab d(A-T) or poly[d(A-T)] under template-limiting conditions synthesis is autocatalytic and continues until complete exhaustion of the input deoxyribonucleotides occurs. The size of the product after an 8-fold net synthesis is approximately the same as that of the original template."

These pyridoxyl peptides differ by only a single arginyl residue. As expected, tryptic digests of normal protein contain two peptides that together make up the pyridoxyl peptide region.

https://openalex.org/W1527245254,"Abstract Homogeneous bovine pituitary glycoproteins with both thyrotropic and exophthalmogenic activity have been subjected to limited proteolysis by pepsin. One fraction lost 90% of its thyrotropin action, but only 15% of its exophthalmogenic activity, when incubated with a 1% weight ratio of pepsin at pH 2.2 and at 37°. Analytical disc gel analyses showed that the decrease in thyrotropin activity could be correlated with the destruction of the glycoprotein originally in this fraction and with the appearance of several new protein-staining bands. One of the digestion products was an oligosaccharide-containing derivative with terminal galactose on at least one of its carbohydrate moieties. After isolation by electrofocusing, this derivative was shown to have exophthalmogenic activity but to be without significant thyrotropin action; the residual thyrotropin activity of limited digests remained associated with nondigested glycoproteins containing both activities. The exophthalmogenic derivative had an isoelectric point at pH 6.9 and exhibited a single component on analytical disc gels. It had a molecular weight of 20,000 to 22,000 when evaluated by electrophoresis on gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate, but appeared to be composed of two polypeptide units, one with a molecular weight of approximately 14,000 and the other with a molecular weight of approximately 6,000. The results indicate that limited proteolysis of a homogeneous pituitary glycoprotein with both thyrotropic and exophthalmogenic activity can yield a derivative uniquely active as an exophthalmos-producing substance."

https://openalex.org/W1567046584,"Abstract 1. Galactokinase from normal human red blood cells was purified 3300- to 3900-fold by ion exchange chromatography, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and dextran gel filtration with a yield of 14 to 19%. Analytical disc electrophoresis of the purified enzyme revealed a single protein band. 2. The Km of purified galactokinase for galactose is 100 to 150 µm; for ATP, 200 to 500 µm. The pH optimum for enzymic phosphorylation of galactose is in the range of pH 7.7 to 7.9. In electrofocusing experiments the isoelectric point of galactokinase was found to be 5.7. The molecular weight of galactokinase was determined to be 53,000 to 57,000 by means of dextran gel chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide electrophoresis. The enzyme seems to have a dimeric structure consisting of monomers with a molecular weight of 25,000 to 27,000. 3. The biochemical properties of galactokinase from human red blood cells are similar to the characteristics of galactokinase from other mammalian tissues, but differ considerably from galactokinase of yeast and Escherichia coli."

https://openalex.org/W1604947515,"Abstract Phage P22 induces a lysozyme in Salmonella typhimurium cells toward the later stage of its multiplication. P22 lysozyme has been purified about 1000-fold starting from the lysate of C1 (clear plaque-forming mutant of phage P22)-infected cells. The enzyme has an optimum pH between 7 and 8 and its activity is dependent on the ionic strength of the assay medium. Salts like MgCl2, NaCl, and KCl are inhibitory to the lysozyme. Gram-negative cells act as better substrates for the lysozyme than do gram-positive cells. The enzyme has a molecular weight of about 2 x 104 and rapidly looses its activity at temperatures higher than 40°. The properties of P22 lysozyme have been compared with those of λ and T4 lysozymes. All three lysozymes have more or less the same molecular weight and have similar properties although P22 and T4 lysozymes seem to be closer than P22 and λ lysozymes."
https://openalex.org/W2037090596,"IT is generally agreed that the light flashes observed by astronauts on Apollo missions 11–141 were produced by the passage of heavy cosmic ray nuclei through the eye. The exact mechanism has been a subject of some controversy, however, most workers leaning towards either Čerenkov radiation2–4 or direct ionization and excitation of molecules at the retina1,5,6. Light flashes similar to the Apollo observations have been reported to result from irradiations of the eyes by X-rays5,7, neutrons5,6,9,10 and slow alpha particles8, all of which are more likely to involve ionization and excitation than Čerenkov radiation. Early indications that the human eye might be sensitive to individual relativistic singly charged particles11 have not been borne out by calculations3 or by recent observations5."

https://openalex.org/W2002276691,"THE anomers α- and β-D-mannose differ structurally only in that H and OH at the C1 atom of the pyranose ring are interchanged. In spite of this apparently minor difference in structure, it has been suggested that the ambiguity of taste perception of D-mannose is due to actual differences in taste between the two anomers of this substance; the evidence presented in support of this view, however, was indirect because insufficient pure β-D-mannose was available for direct taste tests on that anomer1. Sufficient pure β-D-mannose was therefore prepared for a direct and statistically reliable comparison. It was found that the subjects reliably reported the α-anomer as sweet and the β-anomer as bitter. As before, the equilibrium mixture was found to be an ambiguous stimulator."
https://openalex.org/W1606875651,"Abstract Chromatographically purified S-carboxymethyl (179, 203) trypsinogen was activated with trypsin and with enterokinase at pH 5 to functional enzyme molecules as judged by active site titrations. The activation with trypsin was pseudo first order, and its calculated second order rate constant was identical with the corresponding rate constant for the autocatalytic activation of trypsinogen. We interpret these results to signify that the modified zymogen followed the usual reaction pathway on activation, and end group analyses and the composition of purified carboxymethyl trypsin add further support to this proposal. The carboxymethyl, carboxyamidomethyl, and aminoethyl trypsinogens were activated with enterokinase and gave similar yields of active molecules. Carboxymethyl trypsin showed a pH rate profile in accord with the requirement of an un-ionized histidine in the catalytic mechanism. The specificity of catalysis was directed toward lysyl and argininyl residues, and a substrate activation effect was observed at high concentrations of ester substrates. Substrate binding (Km values) of benzoylarginamide was almost identical with that of trypsin and within an order of magnitude with ester substrates. However, the catalytic efficiency of the modified trypsin was low in its proteinase, amidase, and esterase activities. Thus, keat was 0.015 sec-1 with benzoylargininamide (instead of 0.7 sec-1) and 1.2 sec-1 with benzoylarginine ethyl ester (instead of 28 sec-1). The similar decrease in the acylation and deacylation rate constants, namely to 2 and 4%, respectively, was interpreted as arising from a small change in the geometry of the active site from its normal charge-relay configuration."

https://openalex.org/W1597386456,"Abstract In the presence of hydroxylamine, anthranilate synthetase catalyzes the formation of γ-glutamylhydroxamate. This activity requires enzyme, glutamine, and hydroxylamine and is stimulated by chorismate and inhibited by tryptophan. Measurement of the absorption at 500 nm of the red-violet γ-glutamylhydroxamate-Fe3+ chelate provides a convenient assay for the glutaminase activity of this enzyme. When N-methylhydroxylamine is present in the anthranilate synthetase reaction mixture, N-methylhydroxylamine derivatives of pyruvate are formed. One of these derivatives reacts with Fe3+ in acid to form a chromophore which absorbs at 500 nm. The production of these derivatives from pyruvate is nonenzymatic. Their appearance in the anthranilate synthetase reaction mixture is the result of the formation of pyruvate as a product of the enzymatic conversion of chorismate to anthranilate. Anthranilate synthetase is partially inhibited by N-methylhydroxylamine. This inhibition is largely attributable to contaminating Zn2+, a potent inactivator of this enzyme. These results cast doubt on earlier conclusions concerning the mechanism of action of anthranilate synthetase based on studies with N-methylhydroxylamine."
