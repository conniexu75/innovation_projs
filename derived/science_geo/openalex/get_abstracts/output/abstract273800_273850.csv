https://openalex.org/W2060663841,"The combustion of the fossil fuels coal, oil, and lignite potentially can mobilize many elements into the atmosphere at rates, in general, less than but comparable to their rates of flow through natural waters during the weathering cycle. Since the principal sites of fossil fuel combustion are in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, changes in the composition of natural waters and air, as a consequence of this activity, will be most evident at these latitudes."

https://openalex.org/W1966898478,"Data from the Voyager II spacecraft showed that Uranus has a large magnetic field with geometry similar to an offset tilted dipole. To interpret the origin of the magnetic field, measurements were made of electrical conductivity and equation-of-state data of the planetary ""ices"" ammonia, methane, and ""synthetic Uranus"" at shock pressures and temperatures up to 75 gigapascals and 5000 K. These pressures and temperatures correspond to conditions at the depths at which the surface magnetic field is generated. Above 40 gigapascals the conductivities of synthetic Uranus, water, and ammonia plateau at about 20 (ohm-cm)-1, providing an upper limit for the electrical conductivity used in kinematic or dynamo calculations. The nature of materials at the extreme conditions in the interior is discussed."

Although located 160,000 light years away in a satellite galaxy of our own known as the Large Magellanic Cloud, this supernova's relative proximity compared to all others that have been observed in modern times has allowed observations, which were never possible before, to be made from space, from detectors on the ground and carried by balloons and airplanes, and from neutrino detectors deep underground. What emerges is a greater understanding of one of the most violent events in the universe, the death of a massive star. For the most part, theoretical expectations have been borne out, but some major surprises have made the event all the more fascinating."

https://openalex.org/W2037980442,"A comprehensive soil-plant-atmosphere computer simulation model (SPAM) predicted up to a 45 percent increase in carbon dioxide uptake by a crop enriched with carbon dioxide at ground level. Enrichment rates of 225 and 450 kilograms of carbon dioxide per hectare per hour were used. Simulations covered a wide range of wind speed, crop height, and leaf area display."

Using an atmosphere of 100 percent oxygen, we stimulated peripheral blood leukocytes to divide at 19Â°C. Cultured cells were used for a karyological study; they had a modal chromosome number of 60 and a constant arm number of 104, a value previously reported for other tissues in these fish."

The proportionally great amount of energy released in certain events suggests the possible uses for, as well as the hazards of, underground testing."
https://openalex.org/W1990446178,"The addition of certain sugars to the food consumed during larval development increases the taste sensitivity of adult blowflies to some sugars, decreases it to others, and is without effect on the sensitivity to still others. No correlation with metabolic phenomena is apparent. The hypothesis that repression of inductible enzyme synthesis by glucose is a relevant model is not supported."
https://openalex.org/W1979007619,"The Middle Mississippian blastoid (Phylum Echinodermata) extinction event (about 340 million years ago) was a rapid, habitat-specific extinction. Blastoids became rare or absent in shallow-water environments after the extinction, and this change was probably synchronous worldwide. Onshore-offshore habitat shifts have been recognized as an important historical trend among marine benthos. Unlike trends exhibited by other groups, blastoids appear to have repopulated shallow-water habitats after a period of diminished diversity and abundance."

https://openalex.org/W2013665718,"Our review has emphasized that AI tools are programming languages inspired by some problem-solving paradigm. We want to underscore their status as programming languages; even if an AI tool seems to fit a problem perfectly, its proficient use still requires the training and practice associated with any programming language. The programming manuals for PC-Plus, Smalltalk/ V, and Nexpert Object are all tutorial in nature, and the corresponding software packages come with sample applications. We find the manuals to be uniformly good introductions that try to anticipate the problems of a user who is new to the technology. All three vendors offer free technical support by telephone to licensed users. AI tools are sometimes oversold as a way to make programming easy or to avoid it altogether. The truth is that AI tools demand programming-but programming that allows you to concentrate on the essentials of the problem. If we had to implement a diagnostic system, we would look first to a product such as PC-Plus rather than BASIC or C, because PC-Plus is designed specifically for such a problem, whereas these conventional languages are not. If we had to implement a system that required graphical interfaces and could benefit from inheritance, we would look first to an object-oriented system such as Smalltalk/V that provides built-in mechanisms for both. If we had to implement an expert system that called for some mix of AI and conventional techniques, we would look first to a product such as Nexpert Object that integrates various problem-solving technologies. Finally, we might use FORTRAN if we were concerned primarily with programming a well-defined numerical algorithm. AI tools are a valuable complement to traditional languages."

https://openalex.org/W2043447551,"Electrical stimulation of the hypothalamus in prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) produced a readiness to gnaw which decreased over time, exhibited spontaneous recovery, and could be dishabituated by foot shock. The response decrement was in part habituatory and could modify the interaction between a stimulation-induced readiness to gnaw and a physiologically induced hunger. Functional plasticity of stimulation-induced behavior might be accounted for, in part, by habituation."

https://openalex.org/W2142906672,Individuals of the diatom Coscinodiscus have been treated hydrothermally in the presence of lime and carbon dioxide with the result that they have been pseudomorphed by calcite. The silica of the original diatoms has been replaced while the intricate reticulations of the alveoli have been preserved down to submicroscopic detail.

https://openalex.org/W2046323750,A revamping of the program administered by the National Acid Precipitation Program (NAPAP) and a rearrangement of the management form for the program is briefly surveyed. The interim status report for the NAPAP for 1985 was released in mid 1987 and was followed by the resignation of the executive director of the interagency program. The new director will issue a new summary of the interim status report. The agency has been ordered to issue a state of the science of acid rain in summer 1989 that will evaluate the costs and benefits of a few plausible control scenarios. Five new scientists are being added to the program staff to specifically direct the assessment effort.
