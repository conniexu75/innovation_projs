https://openalex.org/W4310439068,"The microbial cell wall is essential for maintenance of cell shape and resistance to external stressors1. The primary structural component of the cell wall is peptidoglycan, a glycopolymer with peptide crosslinks located outside of the cell membrane1. Peptidoglycan biosynthesis and structure are responsive to shifting environmental conditions such as pH and salinity2-6, but the mechanisms underlying such adaptations are incompletely understood. Precursors of peptidoglycan and other cell surface glycopolymers are synthesized in the cytoplasm and then delivered across the cell membrane bound to the recyclable lipid carrier undecaprenyl phosphate7 (C55-P, also known as UndP). Here we identify the DUF368-containing and DedA transmembrane protein families as candidate C55-P translocases, filling a critical gap in knowledge of the proteins required for the biogenesis of microbial cell surface polymers. Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria lacking their cognate DUF368-containing protein exhibited alkaline-dependent cell wall and viability defects, along with increased cell surface C55-P levels. pH-dependent synthetic genetic interactions between DUF368-containing proteins and DedA family members suggest that C55-P transporter usage is dynamic and modulated by environmental inputs. C55-P transporter activity was required by the cholera pathogen for growth and cell shape maintenance in the intestine. We propose that conditional transporter reliance provides resilience in lipid carrier recycling, bolstering microbial fitness both inside and outside the host."
https://openalex.org/W4310570350,"Peptidoglycan and almost all surface glycopolymers in bacteria are built in the cytoplasm on the lipid carrier undecaprenyl phosphate (UndP)1-4. These UndP-linked precursors are transported across the membrane and polymerized or directly transferred to surface polymers, lipids or proteins. UndP is then flipped to regenerate the pool of cytoplasmic-facing UndP. The identity of the flippase that catalyses transport has remained unknown. Here, using the antibiotic amphomycin that targets UndP5-7, we identified two broadly conserved protein families that affect UndP recycling. One (UptA) is a member of the DedA superfamily8; the other (PopT) contains the domain DUF368. Genetic, cytological and syntenic analyses indicate that these proteins are UndP transporters. Notably, homologues from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria promote UndP transport in Bacillus subtilis, indicating that recycling activity is broadly conserved among family members. Inhibitors of these flippases could potentiate the activity of antibiotics targeting the cell envelope."

https://openalex.org/W4310483852,"The bony palate diagnoses the two deepest clades of extant birds: Neognathae and Palaeognathae1,2,3,4,5. Neognaths exhibit unfused palate bones and generally kinetic skulls, whereas palaeognaths possess comparatively rigid skulls with the pterygoid and palatine fused into a single element, a condition long considered ancestral for crown birds (Neornithes)3,5,6,7,8. However, fossil evidence of palatal remains from taxa close to the origin of Neornithes is scarce, hindering strong inferences regarding the ancestral condition of the neornithine palate. Here we report a new taxon of toothed Late Cretaceous ornithurine bearing a pterygoid that is remarkably similar to those of the extant neognath clade Galloanserae (waterfowl + landfowl). Janavis finalidens, gen. et sp. nov., is generally similar to the well-known Mesozoic ornithurine Ichthyornis in its overall morphology, although Janavis is much larger and exhibits a substantially greater degree of postcranial pneumaticity. We recovered Janavis as the first-known well-represented member of Ichthyornithes other than Ichthyornis, clearly substantiating the persistence of the clade into the latest Cretaceous9. Janavis confirms the presence of an anatomically neognathous palate in at least some Mesozoic non-crown ornithurines10,11,12, suggesting that pterygoids similar to those of extant Galloanserae may be plesiomorphic for crown birds. Our results, combined with recent evidence on the ichthyornithine palatine12, overturn longstanding assumptions about the ancestral crown bird palate, and should prompt reevaluation of the purported galloanseran affinities of several bizarre early Cenozoic groups such as the ‘pseudotoothed birds’ (Pelagornithidae)13,14,15."
https://openalex.org/W4310437836,"The ability to amplify optical signals is of pivotal importance across science and technology typically using rare-earth-doped fibres or gain media based on III-V semiconductors. A different physical process to amplify optical signals is to use the Kerr nonlinearity of optical fibres through parametric interactions1,2. Pioneering work demonstrated continuous-wave net-gain travelling-wave parametric amplification in fibres3, enabling, for example, phase-sensitive (that is, noiseless) amplification4, link span increase5, signal regeneration and nonlinear phase noise mitigation6. Despite great progress7-15, all photonic integrated circuit-based demonstrations of net parametric gain have necessitated pulsed lasers, limiting their practical use. Until now, only bulk micromachined periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide chips have achieved continuous-wave gain16,17, yet their integration with silicon-wafer-based photonic circuits has not been shown. Here we demonstrate a photonic-integrated-circuit-based travelling-wave optical parametric amplifier with net signal gain in the continuous-wave regime. Using ultralow-loss, dispersion-engineered, metre-long, Si3N4 photonic integrated circuits18 on a silicon chip of dimensions 5 × 5 mm2, we achieve a continuous parametric gain of 12 dB that exceeds both the on-chip optical propagation loss and fibre-chip-fibre coupling losses in the telecommunication C band. Our work demonstrates the potential of photonic-integrated-circuit-based parametric amplifiers that have lithographically controlled gain spectrum, compact footprint, resilience to optical feedback and quantum-limited performance, and can operate in the wavelength ranges from visible to mid-infrared and outside conventional rare-earth amplification bands."
https://openalex.org/W4310477355,"Microfibers, whether synthetic or natural, have increased dramatically in the environment, becoming the most common type of particles in the ocean, and exposing aquatic organisms to multiple negative impacts. Using an approach combining morphology (scanning electron microscopy-SEM) and molecular taxonomy (High-Throughput DNA Sequencing- HTS), we investigated the bacterial composition from floating microfibers (MFs) collected in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. The average number of bacteria in 100 μm2 on the surface of a fiber is 8 ± 5.9 cells; by extrapolating it to a whole fiber, this represents 2663 ± 1981 bacteria/fiber. Attached bacterial communities were dominated by Alteromonadales, Rhodobacterales, and Vibrionales, including the potentially human/animal pathogen Vibrio parahaemolyticus. This study reveals a high rate of bacterial colonization on MFs, and shows that these particles can host numerous bacterial species, including putative pathogens. Even if we cannot confirm its pathogenicity based only on the taxonomy, this is the first description of such pathogenic Vibrio living attached to MFs in the Mediterranean Sea. The identification of MFs colonizers is valuable in assessing health risks, as their presence can be a threat to bathing and seafood consumption. Considering that MFs can serve as vector for potentially pathogenic microorganisms and other pollutants throughout the ocean, this type of pollution can have both ecological and economic consequences."
https://openalex.org/W4310433931,"Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data have become an integral component of public health investigations and clinical diagnostics. Still, many veterinary diagnostic laboratories cannot afford to implement next generation sequencing (NGS) due to its high cost and the lack of bioinformatic knowledge of the personnel to analyze NGS data. Trying to overcome these problems, and make NGS accessible to every diagnostic laboratory, thirteen veterinary diagnostic laboratories across the United States (US) initiated the assessment of Illumina iSeq100 sequencing platform for whole genome sequencing of important zoonotic foodborne pathogens Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella enterica. The work presented in this manuscript is a continuation of this multi-laboratory effort. Here, seven AAVLD accredited diagnostic laboratories explored a further reduction in sequencing costs and the usage of user-friendly platforms for genomic data analysis. Our investigation showed that the same genomic library quality could be achieved by using a quarter of the recommended reagent volume and, therefore a fraction of the actual price, and confirmed that Illumina iSeq100 is the most affordable sequencing technology for laboratories with low WGS demand. Furthermore, we prepared step-by-step protocols for genomic data analysis in three popular user-friendly software (BaseSpace, Geneious, and GalaxyTrakr), and we compared the outcomes in terms of genome assembly quality, and species and antimicrobial resistance gene (AMR) identification. No significant differences were found in assembly quality, and the three analysis methods could identify the target bacteria species. However, antimicrobial resistance genes were only identified using BaseSpace and GalaxyTrakr; and GalaxyTrakr was the best tool for this task."
https://openalex.org/W4310433869,"While the adult human heart is primarily composed of cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial and smooth muscle cells, the cellular composition during early development remains largely unknown. Reliable identification of fetal cardiac cell types using protein markers is critical to understand cardiac development and delineate the cellular composition of the developing human heart. This is the first study to use immunohistochemistry (IHC), flow cytometry and RT-PCR analyses to investigate the expression and specificity of commonly used cardiac cell markers in the early human fetal heart (8-12 post-conception weeks). The expression of previously reported protein markers for the detection of cardiomyocytes (Myosin Heavy Chain (MHC) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI), fibroblasts (DDR2, THY1, Vimentin), endothelial cells (CD31) and smooth muscle cells (α-SMA) were assessed. Two distinct populations of cTnI positive cells were identified through flow cytometry, with MHC positive cardiomyocytes showing high cTnI expression (cTnIHigh) while MHC negative non-myocytes showed lower cTnI expression (cTnILow). cTnI expression in non-myocytes was further confirmed by IHC and RT-PCR analyses, suggesting troponins are not cardiomyocyte-specific and may play distinct roles in non-muscle cells during early development. Vimentin (VIM) was expressed in cultured ventricular fibroblast populations and flow cytometry revealed VIMHigh and VIMLow cell populations in the fetal heart. MHC positive cardiomyocytes were VIMLow whilst CD31 positive endothelial cells were VIMHigh. Using markers investigated within this study, we characterised fetal human cardiac populations and estimate that 75-80% of fetal cardiac cells are cardiomyocytes and are MHC+/cTnIHigh/VIMLow, whilst non-myocytes comprise 20-25% of total cells and are MHC-/cTnILow/VIMHigh, with CD31+ endothelial cells comprising ~9% of this population. These findings show distinct differences from those reported for adult heart."
https://openalex.org/W4310434115,"Background The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) of the pregnant population during the COVID-19 pandemic in a tertiary care hospital. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan. KAP towards COVID-19 was assessed using 21-item questionnaires. A score for each category was calculated and points were summed. The outcome variables of KAP were compared with demographic characteristics. Data were analyzed by using SPSS 19. Results A total of 377 patients participated in the study. The majority of the patients were multiparous (36.8%) in the age group of 30-40years (42.4%). More than 90% of patients were aware of COVID-19 symptoms and mode of transmission. They were aware of no cure for disease and optimum social distance. Although &lt; 50% of patients truly answered the questions regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the risk of congenital malformation, vertical transmission, and the effect of infection on the mode of delivery. Regarding attitude and practices,&gt; 90% of patients were anxious about fetal and personal safety, they are using a facemask, sanitizing their hands regularly, and avoiding social gatherings. Univariate and multivariable linear regression analysis showed statistically significant results among demographic variables (age, parity, family members, occupational status, and source of information). Conclusion Pregnant patients demonstrated inadequate knowledge regarding the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy. However positive attitude and practices on preventive measures were good. This highlights the need for health education for pregnant women for COVID-19 to improve knowledge on a constant basis."
https://openalex.org/W4310437951,"Early detection of lung cancer is a crucial factor for increasing its survival rates among the detected patients. The presence of carbonyl volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath can play a vital role in early detection of lung cancer. Identifying these VOC markers in breath samples through innovative statistical and machine learning techniques is an important task in lung cancer research. Therefore, we proposed an experimental approach for generation of VOC molecular concentration data using unique silicon microreactor technology and further identification and characterization of key relevant VOCs important for lung cancer detection through statistical and machine learning algorithms. We reported several informative VOCs and tested their effectiveness in multi-group classification of patients. Our analytical results indicated that seven key VOCs, including C4H8O2, C13H22O, C11H22O, C2H4O2, C7H14O, C6H12O, and C5H8O, are sufficient to detect the lung cancer patients with higher mean classification accuracy (92%) and lower standard error (0.03) compared to other combinations. In other words, the molecular concentrations of these VOCs in exhaled breath samples were able to discriminate the patients with lung cancer (n = 156) from the healthy smoker and nonsmoker controls (n = 193) and patients with benign pulmonary nodules (n = 65). The quantification of carbonyl VOC profiles from breath samples and identification of crucial VOCs through our experimental approach paves the way forward for non-invasive lung cancer detection. Further, our experimental and analytical approach of VOC quantitative analysis in breath samples may be extended to other diseases, including COVID-19 detection."
https://openalex.org/W4310477285,"This study aims to estimate induced abortion incidence and safety in Burkina Faso using direct and indirect methods, overall and by women’s background characteristics. Data come from a nationally representative survey of reproductive aged women (n = 6,388). To address social desirability bias in abortion reporting, we asked about respondents’ closest female friends’ experience with abortion. The one-year abortion incidence in 2020 for respondents was 4.0 (95% CI 2.2–5.9) per 1,000 women aged 15–49 while the adjusted friend incidence was 22.9 (95% CI 15.8–30.0). Although not significant, abortion incidence was higher for adolescents, unmarried women, those with higher education, and those in urban areas among both respondents and their friends. Approximately nine out of ten abortions were unsafe (90% respondents, 95% friends), with respondent and friend findings suggesting higher risk of unsafe abortion among older women, less educated women, and women residing in rural areas. Despite recent increases in contraceptive use and continued legal restrictions, abortion remains common in Burkina Faso and is largely unsafe, with evidence of potential disparities."
https://openalex.org/W4310433876,"COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) hit Europe in January 2020. By March, Europe was the active centre of the pandemic. As a result, widespread ""lockdown"" measures were enforced across the various European countries, even if to a different extent. Such actions caused a dramatic reduction, especially in road traffic. This event can be considered the most significant experiment ever conducted in Europe to assess the impact of a massive switch-off of atmospheric pollutant sources. In this study, we focus on in situ concentration data of the main atmospheric pollutants measured in twelve European cities, characterized by different climatology, emission sources, and strengths. We propose a methodology for the fair comparison of the impact of lockdown measures considering the non-stationarity of meteorological conditions and emissions, which are progressively declining due to the adoption of stricter air quality measures. The analysis of these unmatched circumstances allowed us to estimate the impact of a nearly zero-emission urban transport scenario on air quality in 12 European cities. The clearest result, common to all the cities, is that a dramatic traffic reduction effectively reduces NO 2 concentrations. In contrast, each city’s PM and ozone concentrations can respond differently to the same type of emission reduction measure. From the policy point of view, these findings suggest that measures targeting urban traffic alone may not be the only effective option for improving air quality in cities."
https://openalex.org/W4310434147,"Potent broad-spectrum antiviral agents are urgently needed to combat existing and emerging viral infections. This is particularly important considering that vaccine development is a costly and time consuming process and that viruses constantly mutate and render the vaccine ineffective. Antimicrobial peptides (AMP), such as bacteriocins, are attractive candidates as antiviral agents against enveloped viruses. One of these bacteriocins is PLNC8 αβ, which consists of amphipathic peptides with positive net charges that display high affinity for negatively charged pathogen membrane structures, including phosphatidylserine rich lipid membranes of viral envelopes. Due to the morphological and physiological differences between viral envelopes and host cell plasma membranes, PLNC8 αβ is thought to have high safety profile by specifically targeting viral envelopes without effecting host cell membranes. In this study, we have tested the antiviral effects of PLNC8 αβ against the flaviviruses Langat and Kunjin, coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, influenza A virus (IAV), and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1). The concentration of PLNC8 αβ that is required to eliminate all the infective virus particles is in the range of nanomolar (nM) to micromolar (μM), which is surprisingly efficient considering the high content of cholesterol (8-35%) in their lipid envelopes. We found that viruses replicating in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi complex, e.g. SARS-CoV-2 and flaviviruses, are considerably more susceptible to PLNC8 αβ, compared to viruses that acquire their lipid envelope from the plasma membrane, such as IAV and HIV-1. Development of novel broad-spectrum antiviral agents can significantly benefit human health by rapidly and efficiently eliminating infectious virions and thereby limit virus dissemination and spreading between individuals. PLNC8 αβ can potentially be developed into an effective and safe antiviral agent that targets the lipid compartments of viral envelopes of extracellular virions, more or less independent of virus antigenic mutations, which faces many antiviral drugs and vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W4310434272,"Background and purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of incorporating chitosan (Ch) and chitosan oligosaccharides (ChO) into the commercially premixed antibiotic-loaded bone cement (ALBC). We compare antibiotic release profiles, antibacterial activity, and mechanical properties among different ALBC formulations. The hypothesis was that increasing the amount of Ch and ChO in the cement mixture would increase the antibiotics released and bacterial control. ALBC mixed with Ch or ChO may create a greater effect due to its superior dissolving property. Materials and methods The bone cement samples used in this project were made from Copal ® G+V composed of vancomycin and gentamicin. To prepare the Ch and the ChO mixed bone cement samples, different amounts of Ch and ChO were added to the polymethylmethacrylate matrix with three concentrations (1%, 5%, and 10%). Drug elution assay, antimicrobial assay, in vitro cytotoxicity, and mechanical properties were conducted. Results Bone cement samples made from Copal ® G+V alone or combined with Ch or ChO can release vancomycin and gentamicin into the phosphate-buffered saline. Mixing ChO into the bone cements can increase the amount of drug released more than Ch. ChO 10% gave the highest amount of antibiotics released. All samples showed good antibacterial properties with good biocompatibility in vitro . The microhardness values of the Ch and ChO groups increased significantly compared to the control group. In all groups tested, the microhardness of bone cements was reduced after the drug eluted out. However, this reduction of the Ch and ChO groups was in line with the control. Interpretation Various attempts have been made to improve the ALBC efficacy. In our study, the best bone cement formulation was bone cement mixed with ChO (10%), which had the highest drug release profiles, was biocompatible, and contained antibacterial properties with acceptable mechanical properties. This phenomenon could result from the superior water solubility of the ChO. When ChO leaves the bone cement specimens, it generates pores that could act as a path that exposes the bone cement matrix to the surrounding medium, increasing antibiotic elution. From all above, ChO is a promising substance that could be added to ALBC in order to increase the drug elution rate. However, more in vitro and in vivo experiments are needed before being used in the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W4310434320,"Daily injections of recombinant human growth hormone are the standard of care to treat growth failure due to pediatric growth hormone deficiency (GHD). While effective, daily injections are burdensome and can compromise adherence. In recent years, novel injection treatments requiring less frequent administration for growth hormone deficiency (GHD) have been developed. A targeted, pragmatic literature review was conducted to summarize and document the patient experience of moving from daily to less frequent injections, with a specific focus on changing from daily to weekly injection treatments in pediatric GHD (pGHD).Explore and describe the patient experience when switching from a daily to a less frequent injection schedule for GHD.Targeted literature searches were conducted to identify literature describing the patient experience of moving from a daily to weekly injection in GHD. Supplementary searches were conducted to identify literature describing the patient experience of moving from daily to less frequent injection regimens in other medical conditions.Across searches, 1,691 abstracts were reviewed and 13 articles were included in the final analysis. These publications reported that patients moving to less frequent injections across a variety of conditions, including GHD, experienced increased convenience and satisfaction, higher adherence rates, fewer adverse events, and improved quality of life. Less frequent injections were also reported to be at least as efficacious as daily treatments.Less frequent injections in GHD and as other conditions are less burdensome, positively benefit patients, and result in improved adherence that may lead to improved clinical outcomes. Clinicians may consider weekly regimens as an effective alternative for patients, in particular in pGHD, especially when missed injections can negatively impact treatment outcomes. More research is needed to better understand the real-world benefits of injectable therapies that require less frequent administration (e.g., weekly versus daily)."
https://openalex.org/W4310434629,"In recent years, the interest on baby-leaf lettuce has grown steadily, because it is richer in bioactive compounds than other traditional vegetables. However, the quality of lettuce is being increasingly affected by climate change. It is very rare for a climatic effect to occur in isolation. Even then, a large body of work has only focused on the effect of isolated heat stress, fertilization, and elevated CO 2 , on morphological, physiological and biochemical parameters. Thus, very few works have focused on how the combination of several of these factors can affect these parameters. For first time, the present work studied the combined effect derived from the application of two different levels of CO 2 (400 and 1000 ppm of CO 2 ), four different NO 3 - / NH 4 + ratios (100/0 (T-I), 100/0 before the short-term heat stress and finally without NO 3 - (T-II), 80/20 (T-III) and 50/50 (T-IV)), and a short-term heat stress (25 and 43°C), on some physiological and quality parameters (dry biomass, photosynthetic parameters, pigments content, lipid peroxidation and total soluble proteins content) of baby-leaf lettuce cv Derbi. Additionally, a comparison of that combined effect of all these parameters between inner and outer leaves was also performed. The results obtained indicated that the interaction between the nutrient solution containing a 50/50 NO 3 - / NH 4 + ratio and a high concentration of CO 2 (1000 ppm) improved the biomass, photosynthesis, intercellular/external CO 2 concentration ratio (ci/ca), stomatal conductance (gs), evapotranspiration (E) and lipid peroxidation, and protein content in this baby-leaf lettuce. The results obtained in this work lead us to conclude that this existing interaction between the NO 3 - / NH 4 + ratio and the elevated CO 2 concentration may be considered as a new strategy for making baby-leaf lettuce more resistant to heat stress, in other words, stronger against the ever more frequent heat waves."
https://openalex.org/W4310436569,"Susceptibility to schizophrenia is mediated by genetic and environmental risk factors. Infection driven maternal immune activation (MIA) during pregnancy is a key environmental risk factor. However, little is known about how MIA during pregnancy could contribute to adult-onset schizophrenia. In this study, we investigated if maternal immune activation induces changes in methylation of genes linked to schizophrenia. We found that differentially expressed genes in schizophrenia brain were significantly enriched among MIA induced differentially methylated genes in the foetal brain in a cell-type-specific manner. Upregulated genes in layer V pyramidal neurons were enriched among hypomethylated genes at gestational day 9 (fold change = 1.57, FDR = 0.049) and gestational day 17 (fold change = 1.97, FDR = 0.0006). A linear regression analysis, which showed a decrease in gene expression with an increase in methylation in gestational day 17, supported findings from our enrichment analysis. Collectively, our results highlight a connection between MIA driven methylation changes during gestation and schizophrenia gene expression signatures in the adult brain. These findings carry important implications for early preventative strategies in schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W4310437252,"Identification of peptides by analysis of data acquired by the two established methods for bottom-up proteomics, DDA and DIA, relies heavily on the fragment spectra. In DDA, peptide features detected in mass spectrometry data are identified by matching their fragment spectra with a peptide database. In DIA, a peptide’s fragment spectra are targeted for extraction and matched with observed spectra. Although fragment ion matching is a central aspect in most peptide identification strategies, the precursor ion in the MS1 data reveals important characteristics as well, including charge state, intensity, monoisotopic m/z, and apex in retention time. Most importantly, the precursor’s mass is essential in determining the potential chemical modification state of the underlying peptide sequence. In the timsTOF, with its additional dimension of collisional cross-section, the data representing the precursor ion also reveals the peptide’s peak in ion mobility. However, the availability of tools to survey precursor ions with a wide range of abundance in timsTOF data across the full mass range is very limited. Here we present a de novo feature detector called three-dimensional intensity descent (3DID). 3DID can detect and extract peptide features down to a configurable intensity level, and finds many more features than several existing tools. 3DID is written in Python and is freely available with an open-source MIT license to facilitate experimentation and further improvement (DOI 10.5281/zenodo.6513126 ). The dataset used for validation of the algorithm is publicly available (ProteomeXchange identifier PXD030706)."
https://openalex.org/W4310437656,"The COVID-19 pandemic had a severe impact on women's birth experiences. To date, there are no studies that use both quantitative and qualitative data to compare women's birth experiences before and during the pandemic, across more than one country.To examine women's birth experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare the experiences of women who gave birth in the United Kingdom (UK) or the Netherlands (NL) either before or during the pandemic.This study is based on analyses of quantitative and qualitative data from the online Babies Born Better survey. Responses recorded by women giving birth in the UK and the NL between June and December 2020 have been used, encompassing women who gave birth between 2017 and 2020. Quantitative data were analysed descriptively, and chi-squared tests were performed to compare women who gave birth pre- versus during pandemic and separately by country. Qualitative data was analysed by inductive thematic analysis.Respondents in both the UK and the NL who gave birth during the pandemic were as likely, or, if they had a self-reported above average standard of life, more likely to rate their labour and birth experience positively when compared to women who gave birth pre-pandemic. This was despite the fact that those labouring in the pandemic reported a lack of support and limits placed on freedom of choice. Two potential explanatory themes were identified in the qualitative data: respondents had lower expectations of care during the pandemic, and they appreciated the efforts of staff to give individualised care, despite the rules.Our study implies that many women labouring during the COVID-19 pandemic experienced restrictions, but their experience was mitigated by staff actions. However, personalised care should not be maintained by the good will of care providers, but should be a priority in maternity care policy to benefit all service users equitably."
https://openalex.org/W4310477225,"Anemia is a continuing global public health concern and a priority for international action. The prevalence of anemia is estimated from the hemoglobin (Hb) levels within target populations, yet the procedures for measuring Hb are not standardized and different approaches may result in discrepancies. Several analytical variables have been proposed to influence Hb measurements, but it is difficult to understand the impact on specific variables from large population or field studies. Therefore, we designed a highly controlled protocol that minimized most technical parameters to specifically investigate the impact of blood draw site and analytic device on Hb measurements. A diverse cohort of sixty healthy adults each provided a sequential capillary and venous blood sample that were measured for Hb using an automated hematology analyzer (ADVIA-2120) and two point-of-care devices (HemoCue 201+ and HemoCue 301). Comparing blood draw sites, the mean Hb content was 0.32–0.47 g/dL (2–4%) higher in capillary compared to venous blood from the same donors. Comparing different Hb measuring instruments, the mean Hb content was 0.19–0.46 g/dL (1–4%) higher measured with HemoCue devices compared to ADVIA-2120 in both capillary and venous blood from the same donors. The maximum variance in measurement was also higher with HemoCue devices using blood from venous (5–6% CV) and capillary (21–25% CV) sites compared to ADVIA-2120 (0.6–2% CV). Other variables including blood collection tube manufacturer did not affect mean Hb content. These results demonstrate that even when most technical variables are minimized, the blood draw site and the analytical device can have a small but statistically significant effect on the mean and dispersion of Hb measurements. Even in this study, the few participants identified as mildly anemic using venous blood measured by ADVIA-2120 would not have been classified as anemic using their capillary blood samples or point-of-care analyzers. Thus, caution is warranted when comparing Hb values between studies having differences in blood draw site and Hb measuring device. Future anemia testing should maintain consistency in these analytical variables."
https://openalex.org/W4310433933,"Background Urinary incontinence (UI), defined as the involuntary loss of urine, is a common, multifactorial condition. It is unclear whether physical activities, their intensity or frequency, may affect the potential for UI in addition to known risk factors in the general population. Higher prevalence of UI has been observed when engaging in high-impact sports, but research is sparse regarding UI in strength sports. Since the Olympic-style weightlifting has seen an unprecedented increase in women’s participation in recent years, this study provides much-needed data to investigate whether weightlifting predisposes women to UI. Objectives The aim was to conduct a survey of female Master athletes in countries that are members of the International Weightlifting Federation using a validated incontinence severity index and to study (1) whether known risk factors in the general population increase the odds of UI in female competitive weightlifters and (2) whether sport-related factors are associated with UI after adjusting for known risk factors. The outcomes of interest were moderate or more severe UI and incontinence during lifts specific to weightlifting competitions. Results Respondents consisted of 824 female competitive weightlifters from 29 countries, ages 30 to 79, median 41 years. Prevalence of moderate or more severe incontinence was 32%. Higher BMI, prior pregnancies, and depressive mood increased the odds, but age was not associated. Athletes who had engaged in high-impact sports prior to starting weightlifting training were at a higher risk of UI, but participation in prior strength sports was not associated with UI. The predictive probability of moderate or more severe UI increased with more hours per week of weightlifting training. Conclusions Our findings indicate that while female weightlifters had a higher prevalence of moderate or severe UI than in a general population according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and that athletes who had engaged in high-impact sports prior to starting weightlifting were at a higher risk of UI."
https://openalex.org/W4310434111,"At least one in five people who recovered from acute COVID-19 have persistent clinical symptoms, however little is known about the impact on quality-of-life (QOL), socio-economic characteristics, fatigue, work and productivity. We present a cross-sectional descriptive characterization of the clinical symptoms, QOL, socioeconomic characteristics, fatigue, work and productivity of a cohort of patients enrolled in the MedStar COVID Recovery Program (MSCRP). Our participants include people with mental and physical symptoms following recovery from acute COVID-19 and enrolled in MSCRP, which is designed to provide comprehensive multidisciplinary care and aid in recovery. Participants completed medical questionnaires and the PROMIS-29, Fatigue Severity Scale, Work and Productivity Impairment Questionnaire, and Social Determinants of Health surveys. Participants (n = 267, mean age 47.6 years, 23.2% hospitalized for COVID-19) showed impaired QOL across all domains assessed with greatest impairment in physical functioning (mean 39.1 ± 7.4) and fatigue (mean 60.6 ±. 9.7). Housing or “the basics” were not afforded by 19% and food insecurity was reported in 14% of the cohort. Participants reported elevated fatigue (mean 4.7 ± 1.1) and impairment with activity, work productivity, and on the job effectiveness was reported in 63%, 61%, and 56% of participants, respectively. Patients with persistent mental and physical symptoms following initial illness report impairment in QOL, socioeconomic hardships, increased fatigue and decreased work and productivity. Our cohort highlights that even those who are not hospitalized and recover from less severe COVID-19 can have long-term impairment, therefore designing, implementing, and scaling programs to focus on mitigating impairment and restoring function are greatly needed."
https://openalex.org/W4310434539,"Tax audits are a crucial process adopted in all tax departments to ensure tax compliance and fairness. Traditionally, tax audit leads have been selected based on empirical rules and randomization methods, which are not adaptive, may miss major cases and can introduce bias. Here, we present an audit lead tool based on artificial neural networks that have been trained and evaluated on an integrated dataset of 93,413 unique tax records from 8,647 restaurant businesses over 10 years in the Northern California, provided by the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA). The tool achieved a 40.1% precision and 58.7% recall (F1-score of 0.42) on classifying positive audit leads, and the corresponding regressor provided estimated audit gains (MAE of $155,490). Finally, we evaluated the statistical significance of various empirical rules for use in lead selection, with two out of five being supported by the data. This work demonstrates how data can be leveraged for creating evidence-based models of audit selection and validating empirical hypotheses, resulting in higher audit yields and more fair audit selection processes."
https://openalex.org/W4310434804,"Purpose To investigate the positive predictive value of ultrasound classification of non-mass breast lesions (NMLs) following breast imaging reporting and data system (BI-RADS), and enhance understanding of NMLs. Materials and methods Fifty-nine women with 59 ultrasound-detected breast NMLs were finally enrolled. The ultrasound (US) features of breast NMLs were analyzed; the incidence of malignant NMLs was calculated; the malignancy risk stratification of US for breast NMLs was established using BI-RADS. Results The incidence of malignant NMLs was 4.59% of all breast carcinoma. Non-ductal hypoechoic area, microcalcifications and posterior shadowing are the main US features of malignant NMLs, and there were significant differences between malignant and benign NMLs for microcalcifications and posterior shadowing. Taking BI-RADS 4B as a cutoff value, the sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), positive and negative predictive values, and odds ratio of the BI-RADS category were 82.98%,41.67%,0.62,84.78%,38.46% and 3.48, respectively. Conclusions Stratifying the malignancy risk of breast NMLs using the BI-RADS the sensitivity and positive and predictive value are promising, but the likelihood of malignancy of malignant NMLs is underestimated, and that of benign NMLs is overestimated. The solution may be that to separate NMLs from breast masses and use different malignancy risk stratification protocols."

Starfish sampling in the 150-m coral reef zone was undertaken at a depth of 8 m through scuba diving. For each type of potential macrosymbiont, both the dorsal and ventral sides were carefully examined. The prevalence of macrosymbionts on the starfish E. luzonicus was recorded. The most common symbiotic organism on E. luzonicus was the ectoparasitic snail Melanella martinii (A. Adams in Sowerby, 1854), followed by the pontoniine shrimp Zenopontonia soror (Nobili, 1904) and the rare polychaete scaleworm Asterophilia carlae Hanley, 1989. The prevalence ratio with host E. luzonicus was low and varied by 8.62% and 4.35%, 6.03% and 0%, and 0.86% and 0.72% in July and September 2020 for M. martinii, Z. soror, and A. carlae, respectively. The present study is the first to discover the scaleworm A. carlae as a macrosymbiont of the tropical starfish E. luzonicus, with a widespread distribution, off Taiwan's northeastern coast, an area influenced by the Kuroshio Current."
https://openalex.org/W4310436947,"Background Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been associated with incidence of cardiovascular disease and with nocturnal angina, but evidence of a link with coronary atherosclerosis and myocardial ischemia is limited and previous studies may have been affected by selection bias or unmeasured confounding factors. Methods We performed overnight polysomnography in 178 older male twins. The Apnea/Hypopnea Index (AHI) was calculated to assess OSA from the overnight sleep evaluation. AHI ≥15 was used as indicator of moderate/severe OSA. The following day, twins underwent myocardial perfusion imaging with [ 82 Rb]-chloride positron emission tomography. Quantitative and semiquantitative measures of myocardial perfusion and absolute myocardial blood flow were obtained. Results The mean age was 68 years and 40% of the sample had an AHI≥15, which indicates moderate to severe OSA. Abnormal myocardial perfusion, both with stress and at rest, was more common in twins with elevated AHI. After adjusting for clinical, lifestyle and behavioral factors, and previous history of cardiovascular disease, twins with AHI ≥15 had 3.6 higher odds (95% CI, 1.5–8.9) of an abnormal total severity score, defined as a score ≥100, and for each 5-point increment in AHI, the odds of abnormality increased by 20% (95% CI, 7%-34%). Twin pairs where both twins had OSA exhibited the greatest risk. There were no differences in measures of ischemia and absolute myocardial blood flow and flow reserve by AHI status. Conclusions OSA is associated with myocardial perfusion abnormalities that suggest prior subclinical myocardial scarring or infarction. Early environmental factors that affect both twins equally may play a role and should be further explored."
https://openalex.org/W4310437716,"There is substantial evidence confirming that children who begin school with strong developmental skills tend to maintain positive academic trajectories across the elementary school years. Much less is known about children who begin school with poorer developmental competencies yet go on to achieve academically on par with, or above, their initially more competent peers, demonstrating academic resilience. This study used a large population dataset, the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (n = 2,118) to identify children who demonstrated academic resilience between school entry and third grade, and the child, parenting, and school characteristics associated with this resilience. Findings show that two in five children who were initially identified as academically vulnerable on a school entry measure of language and cognitive skills were classified as academically resilient by Grade 3. In multivariate analysis, higher attentional regulation and receptive vocabulary skills were key factors associated with academic resilience in reading and numeracy, along with paternal consistency (for reading resilience) and fewer sleep problems (for numeracy resilience). Bivariate relations (ANOVAs) showed that resilient children, when compared to children who remained vulnerable, also showed fewer peer problems, fewer behavioral sleep problems, higher levels of parenting consistency and lower levels of parenting anger by mothers and fathers, higher levels of parental engagement in children’s school, and higher levels of teacher self-efficacy. Supporting resilient pathways for children who are identified as vulnerable at school entry should include a particular focus on vocabulary development and attentional regulation, along with social skills and peer relationships, school-based parental engagement, and positive parenting support."
https://openalex.org/W4310437752,"Aim Covert hepatic encephalopathy (CHE) adversely affects clinical outcomes in patients with liver cirrhosis, although its diagnosis is difficult. This study aimed to establish a simple CHE screening model based on blood-related biochemical parameters. Methods This retrospective study enrolled 439 patients who were assessed for CHE using a neuropsychiatric test between January 2011 and June 2019. A simple CHE (sCHE) score was calculated with hypoalbuminemia (≤ 3.5 g/dL) and hyperammonemia (≥ 80 μg/dL) as 1 point each. The association between sCHE score and CHE or overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) was assessed using logistic regression and Fine-Gray competing risk regression models. Results Of 381 eligible patients, 79 (21%) were diagnosed with CHE. The distribution of sCHE scores was 48% with 0 point, 33% with 1 point, and 19% with 2 points. Patients with sCHE score ≥ 1 point had a higher prevalence of CHE than those with sCHE score of 0 (27% vs. 14%, P = 0.002). A cut-off value of 1 point showed high discriminative ability for identifying CHE, with a sensitivity of 0.67, specificity of 0.56, positive predictive value of 0.27, and negative predictive value of 0.86. During the median follow-up period of 2.2 years, 58 (15%) patients developed OHE. Multivariate analysis showed that sCHE score ≥ 1 (sub-distribution hazard ratio [SHR], 2.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.41–5.15) and CHE (SHR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.26–3.73) independently predicted OHE. Conclusions The sCHE score is a useful screening model for identifying patients with CHE and for predicting OHE occurrence."
https://openalex.org/W4310477221,"Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal, highly infectious prion disease that affects captive and wild cervids. Chronic wasting disease is the only known transmissible spongiform encephalopathy affecting free-ranging wildlife. In CWD-positive deer, some haplotypes of the prion protein gene PRNP are detected at lower frequencies as compared to CWD-negative deer, as are some variants of the prion protein PrP. Here, we examined wild, hunter-harvested CWD-negative white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) to determine whether there were geographical or temporal differences in the PRNP haplotypes, PRNP diplotypes, PrP proteoforms, and in the proportion of deer with at least one protective haplotype. We sampled 96-100 hunter-harvested deer per county at two time points in the Illinois counties of Jo Daviess, LaSalle, and Winnebago, chosen based on their geographic locations and known occurrence of CWD. The entire coding region of PRNP was sequenced, with haplotypes, diplotypes, and PrP proteoforms inferred. Across time, in Winnebago there was a significant increase in PrP proteoform F (p = 0.034), which is associated with a lower vulnerability to CWD. In every county, there was an increase over time in the frequency of deer carrying at least one protective haplotype to CWD, with a significant increase (p = 0.02) in the Jo Daviess County CWD infected region. We also found that primer combination was important as there was an 18.7% difference in the number of the deer identified as homozygous depending on primer usage. Current Illinois state management practices continue to remove CWD infected deer from locally infected areas helping to keep CWD prevalence low. Nonetheless, continued research on spatial and temporal changes in PRNP haplotypes, PrP proteoforms, and levels of deer vulnerability among Illinois deer will be important for the management of CWD within the state of Illinois and beyond."
https://openalex.org/W4310477280,"Microorganisms produce costly cooperative goods whose benefit is partially shared with nonproducers, called ‘mixed’ goods. The Black Queen Hypothesis predicts that partial privatization has two major evolutionary implications. First, to favor strains producing several types of mixed goods over nonproducing strains. Second, to favor the maintenance of cooperative traits through different strains instead of having all cooperative traits present in a single strain (metabolic specialization). Despite the importance of quorum sensing regulation of mixed goods, it is unclear how partial privatization affects quorum sensing evolution. Here, we studied the influence of partial privatization on the evolution of quorum sensing. We developed a mathematical population genetics model of an unstructured microbial population considering four strains that differ in their ability to produce an autoinducer (quorum sensing signaling molecule) and a mixed good. Our model assumes that the production of the autoinducers and the mixed goods is constitutive and/or depends on quorum sensing. Our results suggest that, unless autoinducers are costless, partial privatization cannot favor quorum sensing. This result occurs because with costly autoinducers: (1) a strain that produces both autoinducer and goods (fully producing strain) cannot persist in the population; (2) the strain only producing the autoinducer and the strain producing mixed goods in response to the autoinducers cannot coexist, i.e., metabolic specialization cannot be favored. Together, partial privatization might have been crucial to favor a primordial form of quorum sensing—where autoinducers were thought to be a metabolic byproduct (costless)—but not the transition to nowadays costly autoinducers."
https://openalex.org/W4310433591,"Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is a severe inflammatory disease in children related to SARS-CoV-2 with multisystem involvement including marked cardiac dysfunction and clinical symptoms that can resemble Kawasaki Disease (KD). We hypothesized that MIS-C and KD might have commonalities as well as unique inflammatory responses and studied these responses in both diseases. In total, fourteen children with MIS-C (n=8) and KD (n=6) were included in the period of March-June 2020. Clinical and routine blood parameters, cardiac follow-up, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and CD4+ T-cell responses, and cytokine-profiles were determined in both groups. In contrast to KD patients, all MIS-C patients had positive Spike protein-specific CD3 + CD4 + T-cell responses. MIS-C and KD patients displayed marked hyper-inflammation with high expression of serum cytokines, including the drug-targetable interleukin (IL)-6 and IFN-γ associated chemokines CXCL9, 10 and 11, which decreased at follow-up. No statistical differences were observed between groups. Clinical outcomes were all favourable without cardiac sequelae at 6 months follow-up. In conclusion, MIS-C and KD-patients both displayed cytokine-associated hyper-inflammation with several high levels of drug-targetable cytokines."
https://openalex.org/W4310434262,"To identify the barriers and facilitators that people with severe mental illness and people with learning disabilities may encounter when accessing cancer screening and make recommendations for implementing reasonable adjustments throughout cancer screening services.An 18-month sequential, mixed-methods study comprising of two phases of work and underpinned by Normalisation Process Theory, recruiting from across the North-East and North Cumbria. The first phase aims to identify the barriers and facilitators for people with severe mental illness in accessing cervical, breast and colorectal cancer screening. A systematic review of eight databases (Part 1a; PROSPERO registration number: CRD42022331781) alongside semi-structured interviews of up to 36 people with severe mental illness (Part 1b) will occur. Additional characteristics indicating populations whose perspectives may not have been accounted for in the systematic review will be targeted in the interviews. Potential participants will be identified from a range of settings across the North-East and North Cumbria, including through social media and gatekeepers within National Health Service Trusts and charities. Interviews will be analysed using framework analysis, which will be in line with the Normalisation Process Theory. The second phase of the project (part 2a) involves triangulating the results of the systematic review and interviews with existing research previously completed with people with learning disabilities accessing cancer screening. This will be to identify population specific barriers and facilitators across people with learning disabilities and people with severe mental illness to access cancer screening services. Following triangulation, part 2b will include designing and planning a future study involving stakeholders in cancer screening to explore the feasibility, practicality, and priority for implementing the recommendations to improve person centred cancer screening services (PECCS).This study has received Teesside University ethical approval, Health Research Authority approval (IRAS: 310622) and favourable opinion (REF: 22/PR/0793).

https://openalex.org/W4310434291,"The oxidized high-density lipoprotein (oxHDL) is a possible marker for cardiovascular diseases. This study investigated the effects of smoking cessation with varenicline (a partial agonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors) on the levels of oxHDL in the serum of subjects compared with those of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C).Data of 99 nicotine-dependent adult subjects who visited the smoking cessation outpatient services at International University of Health and Welfare Shioya Hospital were reviewed. Each subject was treated with varenicline titrated up to 1.0 mg twice daily for 12 weeks. Serum levels of oxHDL and HDL-C were repeatedly measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and enzymatic method, respectively.The serum levels of oxHDL were significantly decreased from 163.2 ± 96.6 to 148.3 ± 80.7 U/mL (p = 0.034, n = 99). This effect was more prominent when the data of subjects in whom the treatment was objectively unsuccessful (exhaled carbon monoxide at 3 months ≥ 10 ppm) were omitted (from 166.6 ± 98.4 to 147.4 ± 80.6 U/mL; p = 0.0063, n = 93). In contrast, the serum levels of HDL-C were significantly increased (p = 0.0044, n = 99). There was a close relationship between the baseline levels of oxHDL and HDL-C (R = 0.45, p < 0.0001, n = 99). Changes in the levels of oxHDL were closely associated with changes in the levels of exhaled carbon monoxide in subjects in whom smoking cessation with varenicline was very effective (decrease in exhaled carbon monoxide by ≥ 15 ppm after treatment with varenicline; R = 0.42, p = 0.0052, n = 43).Although there was a close relationship between the baseline serum concentrations of oxHDL and HDL-C, smoking cessation decreased oxHDL and increased HDL-C. This effect on oxHDL may be associated with the effectiveness of smoking cessation."
https://openalex.org/W4310434294,"The aim of organized breast cancer screening is early detection and reduction in mortality. Organized screening should promote equal access and reduce socio-economic inequalities. In Slovenia, organized breast cancer screening achieved complete coverage in 11-years' time. We explored whether step-wise implementation reflects in prognostic factors (earlier diagnosis and treatment) and survival of breast cancer patients in our population.Using population-based cancer registry and screening registry data on breast cancer cases from 2008-2018, we compared stage distribution and mean time to surgical treatment in (A) women who underwent at least one mammography in the organized screening programme, women who received at least one invitation but did not undergo mammography and women who did not receive any screening invitation, and in (B) women who were invited to organized screening and those who were not. We also compared net survival by stage in different groups of women according to their screening programme status.Women who underwent at least one mammography in organized screening had lower disease stage at diagnosis. Time-to-treatment analysis showed mean time to surgery was shortest in women not included in organized screening (all stages = 36.0 days vs. 40.3 days in women included in organized screening). This could be due to quality assurance protocols with an obligatory multidisciplinary approach within the organized screening vs. standard treatment pathways which can vary in different (smaller) hospitals. Higher standard of care in screening is reflected in better survival in women included in organized screening (5-years net survival for regional stage: at least one mammography in the screening programme- 96%; invitation, but no mammography- 87.4%; no invitation or mammography in the screening programme- 82.6%).Our study, which is one of the first in central European countries, shows that introduction of organized screening has temporary effects on population cancer burden indicators already during roll-out period, which should therefore be as short as possible."
https://openalex.org/W4310434318,"International evidence shows that people approaching end of life (EOL) have high prevalence of polypharmacy, including overprescribing. Overprescribing may have adverse side effects for mental and physical health and represents wasteful spending. Little is known about prescribing near EOL in Ireland. We aimed to describe the prevalence of two undesirable outcomes, and to identify factors associated with these outcomes: potentially questionable prescribing, and potentially inadequate prescribing, in the last year of life (LYOL). We used The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, a biennial nationally representative dataset on people aged 50+ in Ireland. We analysed a sub-sample of participants with high mortality risk and categorised their self-reported medication use as potentially questionable or potentially inadequate based on previous research. We identified mortality through the national death registry (died in <365 days versus not). We used descriptive statistics to quantify prevalence of our outcomes, and we used multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with these outcomes. Of 525 observations, 401 (76%) had potentially inadequate and 294 (56%) potentially questionable medications. Of the 401 participants with potentially inadequate medications, 42 were in their LYOL. OF the 294 participants with potentially questionable medications, 26 were in their LYOL. One factor was significantly associated with potentially inadequate medications in LYOL: male (odds ratio (OR) 4.40, p = .004) Three factors were associated with potentially questionable medications in LYOL: male (OR 3.37, p = .002); three or more activities of daily living (ADLs) (OR 3.97, p = .003); and outpatient hospital visits (OR 1.03, p = .02). Thousands of older people die annually in Ireland with potentially inappropriate or questionable prescribing patterns. Gender differences for these outcomes are very large. Further work is needed to identify and reduce overprescribing near EOL in Ireland, particularly among men."
https://openalex.org/W4310434322,"Introduction Efficient utilisation of surgical resources is essential when providing surgical care in low-resources settings. Countries are developing plans to scale up surgery, though insufficiently based on empirical evidence. This paper investigates the determinants of hospital efficiency in district hospitals in three African countries. Methods Three-month data, comprising surgical capacity indicators and volumes of major surgical procedures collected from 61 district-level hospitals in Malawi, Tanzania, and Zambia, were analysed. Data envelopment analysis was used to calculate average hospital efficiency scores (max. = 1) for each country. Quantile regression analysis was selected to estimate the relationship between surgical volume and production factors. Two-stage bootstrap regression analysis was used to estimate the determinants of hospital efficiency. Results Average hospital efficiency scores were 0.77 in Tanzania, 0.70 in Malawi and 0.41 in Zambia. Hospitals with high efficiency scores had significantly more surgical staff compared with low efficiency hospitals (DEA score&lt;1). Hospitals that scored high on the most commonly utilised surgical capacity index were not the ones with high surgical volumes or high efficiency. The number of surgical team members, which was lowest in Zambia, was strongly, positively correlated with surgical productivity and efficiency. Conclusion Hospital efficiency, combining capacity measures and surgical outputs, is a better indicator of surgical performance than capacity measures, which could be misleading if used alone for surgical planning. Investment in the surgical workforce, in particular, is critical to improving district hospital surgical productivity and efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W4310434440,"Left atrial appendage (LAA) size is crucial for determining the indication of transcatheter LAA closure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the differences in LAA morphology according to the types of atrial fibrillation (AF). A total of 299 patients (mean age: 67 ± 13 years) who underwent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) were included. Patients were classified into non-AF (n = 64), paroxysmal AF (n = 86), persistent AF (n = 87), or long-standing persistent AF (n = 62). LAA morphology, including LAA ostial diameter and depth, was assessed using TEE. Patients with long-standing persistent AF had larger LAA ostial diameter and depth and lower LAA flow velocity. The maximum LAA ostial diameter was 19 ± 4 mm in patients with non-AF, 21 ± 4 mm in patients with paroxysmal AF, 23 ± 5 mm in patients with persistent AF, and 26 ± 5 mm in patients with long-standing persistent AF. LAA ostial diameter was increased by 2 or 3 mm with the progression of AF. LAA ostial diameter was correlated with LA volume index (R = 0.37, P < 0.01) and the duration of continuous AF (R = 0.30, P < 0.01), but not with age or the period from the onset of AF. In conclusion, LAA size was increased with the progression of AF."

Twenty-one Dunkin Hartley Guinea pigs received an intraarticular injection of ECM-B in each knee and were split into sub-groups for gait assessment and post-harvest knee evaluations at 1 week (n = 5), 2 weeks (n = 5), 4 weeks (n = 5), or 8 weeks (n = 6). The results were compared with a control group (n = 5), which underwent bilateral injections of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), gait measurements at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks, and post-mortem knee evaluation at 8 weeks post-injection. Hind limbs and popliteal lymph nodes were collected at the Week 8 endpoint and underwent histological analysis by a veterinary pathologist. Significant improvement in hind limb base of support was observed in the ECM-B group compared to the control group at Week 4 but was no longer significant by Week 8. No significant differences were observed between control and ECM-B groups in hind limb cartilage, synovium, or popliteal lymph node histology at Week 8. In conclusion, administration of an ECM-B material may improve gait for a limited time without significant adverse effects on the cartilage, synovium, or local lymph nodes."
https://openalex.org/W4310436520,"Many people living around the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (CNPP) have been exposed to 137 Cs for several decades after the CNPP accident. Although half-life of 137 Cs is about 30 years, some wild forest foodstuffs are contaminated by 137 Cs even now. We pointed out in a previous report that low-dose internal radiation has been occasionally detected in people’s body. Moreover, some doctors in local hospitals have claimed that internal exposure from contaminated foodstuffs may affect the digestive organs and possibly cause gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. Thus, we attempt to assess whether internal radiation exposure affects digestive organs or not, and the possible factors that influence digestive organs. Overall, 1,612 residents were assessed for internal 137 Cs concentration using Whole-Body Counter and their digestive organs were screened with upper GI endoscopy from 2016–2018 in the Zhytomyr region, Ukraine. All participants answered to the questionnaire including their background, intake of wild forest foodstuff, intake frequency, smoking habits, and alcohol consumption. We checked the number of upper GI endoscopic diagnosis per person to assess the extent of damage to the upper digestive organs. Next, we statistically analyzed associations between this number and age, sex, level of internal exposure dose, alcohol consumption, wild forest foodstuff intake, and smoking. Consequently, we revealed that the number of GI diagnosis is significantly increased by factors such as sex, intake of wild forest foodstuff, and alcohol consumption. However, the average level of internal exposure of 137 Cs and smoking did not relate to the number of GI diagnosis. Thus, the results of multiple regression revealed that alcohol consumption is independently related to the number of GI diagnosis that is most likely accompanied by the intake of wild forest foodstuff. In conclusion, the low-dose internal exposure may not affect the digestive organs of residents living around CNPP."

Methods We assessed the psychometric properties of the GTS-QOL-French-Ado in 84 adolescents (mean age 13.6 years, standard deviation 1.2) in terms of factor structure, internal consistency, reliability and convergent validity with the Child Depression Inventory (CDI), the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC), the Motor tic, Obsessions and compulsions, Vocal tic Evaluation Survey (MOVES) and the French “Vécu et Santé Perçue de l’Adolescent” (VSP-A), a generic self-administered measure of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in adolescents. Results Exploratory factor analysis of the GTS-QOL-French-Ado resulted in a 5-factor solution. The GTS-QOL-French-Ado demonstrated good acceptability with missing values per subscale ranging from 0% to 1.2%, good internal consistency for four of the five subscales with Cronbach’s alpha ranging from 0.56 to 0.87 and good test–retest reliability with intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.74 (95% CI: 0.52–0.86) to 0.82 (95% CI: 0.66–0.91). Convergent validity was supported by correlations with CDI, MASC, MOVES, VSP-A and clinical variables. Discussion The GTS-QOL-French-Ado is the first disease-specific HRQoL tool for French-speaking adolescents with GTS aged 12–16 years, and shows good psychometric properties. Further psychometric testing on responsiveness to change would be of great interest."

We also assessed U.S. Census regional differences in insurance coverage post-ACA using modified Poisson regression models with robust variance and calculated the risk ratio (RR) of being uninsured by region, with the Northeast as the reference category. Within each region, we then examined changes in insurance coverage by income level among non-elderly individuals with any chronic condition.2010-2017 household component of the nationally representative Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS).All members of surveyed households during five interviews over a two-year period.Start of insurance coverage expansion under the ACA.Health insurance status.On average nationwide, non-elderly adults with self-reported chronic conditions experienced increased insurance coverage associated with the ACA (diabetes: +6.41%, high-blood pressure: +6.09%, heart disease: +6.50%, asthma: +6.37%, arthritis: +6.77%, and ≥ 2 chronic conditions: +6.39%). Individuals in the West region reported the largest increases (diabetes +9.71%, high blood pressure +8.10%, and heart disease/stroke +8.83 %, asthma +9.10%, arthritis +8.39%, and ≥ 2 chronic conditions +8.58). In contrast, individuals in the South region reported smaller increases in insurance coverage post-ACA among those with diabetes, heart disease/stroke, and asthma compared to the Midwest and West. The Northeast region, which had the highest levels of insurance coverage pre-ACA, exhibited the smallest increase in reported coverage post-ACA. Reported insurance coverage improved across all regions for adults with any chronic condition across income levels, most notably for very low- and low-income individuals. A further cross-sectional comparison after the ACA demonstrated important residual differences in insurance coverage, despite the gains in all regions. When compared to the Northeast, adults with any self-reported chronic conditions living in the South were more likely to report no insurance coverage (diabetes: RR 1.99, p-value <0.001, high blood pressure: RR 2.02, p-value <0.001, heart diseases/stroke: RR 2.55, p-value <0.001, asthma RR 2.21, p-value <0.001, arthritis: RR 2.25, p-value <0.001), and ≥ 2 chronic condition (RR 2.29, p-value <0.001).The ACA was associated with meaningful increases in insurance coverage for adults with any self-reported chronic condition in all US regions, most notably in the West region and among those with lower incomes, suggesting a nation-wide trend to improved access to health insurance following implementation. However, intra-regional comparisons after ACA implementation showed important differences. Individuals with ≥2 chronic conditions in the South were 2.29 times less likely to have insurance coverage in comparison to their peers in the Northeast. Though the post-ACA improvements in reported access to health insurance coverage affected all US regions, the reported experience of those with multiple chronic conditions in the South point to continued barriers for those most likely to benefit from access to health insurance coverage. Medicaid expansion in the South would likely result in increased insurance coverage for individuals with chronic conditions and improve health care outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4310437255,"Over the first half of March 2021, the majority of European governments suspended Astrazeneca's Vaxzevria vaccine as a precaution following media reports of rare blood clots. We analyse the impact of the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) March 18th statement assuring the public of the safety of Vaxzevria and the immediate reinstatement of the vaccine by most countries on respondents' intention to get vaccinated. By relying on survey data collected in Luxembourg and neighbouring areas between early March and mid-April, we observe that the willingness to be vaccinated was severely declining in the days preceding the EMA statement. We implement a regression discontinuity design exploiting the time at which respondents completed the survey and find that the vaccine reinstatement substantially restored vaccination intentions."
https://openalex.org/W4310437260,"For the nervous system to develop properly, neurons must connect in a precise way to form functional networks. This requires that outgrowing neuronal processes (axons) navigate to their target areas, where they establish proper synaptic connections. The molecular basis of this navigation process is not firmly understood. A candidate family containing putative receptors acting in various aspects of neuronal development including axon navigation are transmembrane proteins of the extracellular Leucine-Rich Repeat family (eLRRs). We systematically tested members of this family in C . elegans for a role in axon navigation in the ventral nerve cord (VNC). We found that lron-11 mutants showed VNC navigation defects in several classes of neurons, including a pioneer neuron and various classes of interneurons and motoneurons. This suggests that while most members of the lron -family do not seem to have a role in axon navigation in the VNC, lron-11 is likely to be a receptor required for correct navigation of axons in the VNC of C . elegans ."
https://openalex.org/W4310437748,"The outbreak of COVID-19 caused high psychological burden for many people. Some people tend to excessive social media use (SMU) to escape the negative emotions which can foster addictive tendencies. The present study investigated positive mental health (PMH) and mindfulness as protective factors that could reduce the risk for addictive SMU. Data of 1,049 participants from Germany were assessed via online surveys in autumn 2021. The current results reveal a positive relationship between COVID-19 burden and addictive SMU. Both were negatively linked to PMH and mindfulness. In a moderated mediation analysis, the relationship between COVID-19 burden and addictive SMU was mediated by PMH. Mindfulness moderated the association between PMH and addictive SMU. The COVID-19 situation can be burdensome and contribute to dysfunctional coping strategies such as addictive SMU. However, PMH and mindfulness serve as protective factors. The protective effect of mindfulness could be especially important for persons with low PMH."
https://openalex.org/W4310437824,"As the most favoured animal companion of humans, dogs occupy a unique place in society. Understanding the senses of the dog can bring benefits to both the dogs themselves and their owners. In the case of bitter taste, research may provide useful information on sensitivity to, and acceptance of, diets containing bitter tasting materials. It may also help to protect dogs from the accidental ingestion of toxic substances, as in some instances bitter tasting additives are used as deterrents to ingestion. In this study we examined the receptive range of dog bitter taste receptors (Tas2rs). We found that orthologous dog and human receptors do not always share the same receptive ranges using in vitro assays. One bitter chemical often used as a deterrent, denatonium benzoate, is only moderately active against dTas2r4, and is almost completely inactive against other dog Tas2rs, including dTas2r10, a highly sensitive receptor in humans. We substituted amino acids to create chimeric dog-human versions of the Tas2r10 receptor and found the ECL2 region partly determined denatonium sensitivity. We further confirmed the reduced sensitivity of dogs to this compound in vivo . A concentration of 100μM (44.7ppm) denatonium benzoate was effective as a deterrent to dog ingestion in a two-bottle choice test indicating higher concentrations may increase efficacy for dogs. These data can inform the choice and concentration of bitter deterrents added to toxic substances to help reduce the occurrence of accidental dog poisonings."
https://openalex.org/W4310477218,"Non-neutral wrist postures have been reported to cause decreased carpal tunnel volume (CTV) contributing to impingement of the median nerve and development of carpal tunnel syndrome. Recent analysis found CTV did not change with ±20° flexion-extension (FE), however, CTV decreased with ulnar deviation over the range of -5° to 15° radial-ulnar deviation (RUD). These findings suggest CTV may be too coarse of a measure to reflect the effects of slight non-neutral postures, or that volume is conserved and redistributed due to changes in tunnel morphology with posture. The objective of this study was to assess volume distribution along the length of the carpal tunnel and to quantify regional morphology changes with deviated wrist postures in both FE and RUD. Analysis was performed on a dataset of computed tomography scans collected on ten cadaveric specimens (5 male, 5 female, mean age = 80.7 ± 10.9 years) over a range of FE and RUD postures. The carpal tunnel of each scan was divided into four quartiles of equal length along the tunnel to quantify volume distribution. Volume within the carpal tunnel was seen to redistribute with both FE and RUD. Decreased volume in the distal aspect of the tunnel with flexion and proximal aspect of the tunnel with ulnar deviation may contribute to localized compression of the medial nerve. Measures of mean cross-sectional area, width and depth by quartile provided an indication of the morphology changes associated volume redistribution. Morphology analysis also revealed twisting between the proximal and distal aspects of the tunnel which increased with flexion and ulnar deviation and may further contribute to strain on the median nerve."
https://openalex.org/W4310477227,"Muscle injury can be caused by strenuous exercise, repetitive tasks or external forces. Populations that have experienced selection for high locomotor activity may have evolutionary adaptations that resist exercise-induced injury and/or enhance the ability to cope with injury. We tested this hypothesis with an experiment in which mice are bred for high voluntary wheel running. Mice from four high runner lines run ~three times more daily distance than those from four non-selected control lines. To test recovery from injury by external forces, mice experienced contusion via weight drop on the calf. After injury, running distance and speed were reduced in high runner but not control lines, suggesting that the ability of control mice to run exceeds their motivation. To test effects of injury from exercise, mice were housed with/without wheels for six days, then trunk blood was collected and muscles evaluated for injury and regeneration. Both high runner and control mice with wheels had increased histological indicators of injury in the soleus, and increased indicators of regeneration in the plantaris. High runner mice had relatively more central nuclei (regeneration indicator) than control in the soleus, regardless of wheel access. The subset of high runner mice with the mini-muscle phenotype (characterized by greatly reduced muscle mass and type IIb fibers) had lower plasma creatine kinase (indicator of muscle injury), more markers of injury in the deep gastrocnemius, and more markers of regeneration in the deep and superficial gastrocnemius than normal-muscled individuals. Contrary to our expectations, high runner mice were not more resistant to either type of injury."
https://openalex.org/W4310477252,"Background and objectives Reference ranges are widely used to locate the major range of the target probability distribution. When future measurements fall outside the reference range, they are classified as atypical and require further investigation. The fundamental principles and statistical properties of reference ranges are closely related to those of tolerance interval procedures. Existing investigations of reference ranges and tolerance intervals mainly devoted to the primitive cases of one- and paired-sample designs. Although reference ranges hold considerable promise for parallel group designs, the corresponding methodological and computational issues for determining reference limits and sample sizes have not been adequately addressed. Methods This paper describes a complete collection of one- and two-sided reference ranges for assessing measurement differences in parallel-group studies that assume variance homogeneity. Results The problem of sample size determination for precise reference ranges is also examined under the expected half-width and assurance probability considerations. Unlike the current methods, the suggested sample size criteria explicitly accommodate desired interval width in precise interval estimation. Conclusions Theoretical examinations and empirical assessments are presented to validate the usefulness of the proposed reference range and sample size procedures. To enhance the usages of the recommended techniques in practical applications, computer programs are developed for efficient calculation and exact analysis. A real data example regarding tablet absorption rate and extent is presented to illustrate the suggested assessments between two drug formulations."
https://openalex.org/W4310477284,"In order to understand the features of sport schools and their impacts on the holistic development of student-athletes, it is important to take into account the voice of multiple stakeholders central to the programmes (student-athletes, coaches, teachers). Through a case-study approach, using five focus groups, with 19 student-athletes, and six semi-structured interviews with three coaches and three dual coach and teachers, this study explored the perceived impacts of one sport-friendly school (pseudonym–“Salkeld High”) on holistic athlete development and the features that drove these impacts. Using a critical realist approach to thematic analysis, findings indicated a multitude of immediate, intermediate and long-term positive and negative impacts associated with academic/vocational (e.g., academic security vs. second/third choice university), athletic/physical (e.g., performance development vs. injuries), psychosocial (e.g., social skills vs. social scarifies) and psychological (e.g., sport confidence vs. performance pressure) development of “Salkeld High” student-athletes. Overall, “Salkeld High” was viewed as an integrated school environment for sport, academics, and boarding, where academic (e.g., extra-tutoring), athletic (e.g., high volume/frequency of training), and psychosocial/psychological (e.g., pastoral services) features are all in one location. The student-athletes tended to get a well-rounded, balanced holistic experience. However, the intensified and challenging nature of involvement did present some negative impacts that stakeholders should be aware of when designing, implementing, and evaluating sport-friendly school programmes. Furthermore, although “Salkeld High” was seen as an integrated environment within the school, it could do better at collaborating with wider sporting structures."
