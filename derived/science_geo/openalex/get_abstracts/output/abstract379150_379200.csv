https://openalex.org/W2036154117,"Information of subcellular locations of proteins is important for in-depth studies of cell biology. It is very useful for proteomics, system biology and drug development as well. However, most existing methods for predicting protein subcellular location can only cover 5 to 12 location sites. Also, they are limited to deal with single-location proteins and hence failed to work for multiplex proteins, which can simultaneously exist at, or move between, two or more location sites. Actually, multiplex proteins of this kind usually posses some important biological functions worthy of our special notice. A new predictor called “Euk-mPLoc 2.0” is developed by hybridizing the gene ontology information, functional domain information, and sequential evolutionary information through three different modes of pseudo amino acid composition. It can be used to identify eukaryotic proteins among the following 22 locations: (1) acrosome, (2) cell wall, (3) centriole, (4) chloroplast, (5) cyanelle, (6) cytoplasm, (7) cytoskeleton, (8) endoplasmic reticulum, (9) endosome, (10) extracell, (11) Golgi apparatus, (12) hydrogenosome, (13) lysosome, (14) melanosome, (15) microsome (16) mitochondria, (17) nucleus, (18) peroxisome, (19) plasma membrane, (20) plastid, (21) spindle pole body, and (22) vacuole. Compared with the existing methods for predicting eukaryotic protein subcellular localization, the new predictor is much more powerful and flexible, particularly in dealing with proteins with multiple locations and proteins without available accession numbers. For a newly-constructed stringent benchmark dataset which contains both single- and multiple-location proteins and in which none of proteins has pairwise sequence identity to any other in a same location, the overall jackknife success rate achieved by Euk-mPLoc 2.0 is more than 24% higher than those by any of the existing predictors. As a user-friendly web-server, Euk-mPLoc 2.0 is freely accessible at http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/euk-multi-2/. For a query protein sequence of 400 amino acids, it will take about 15 seconds for the web-server to yield the predicted result; the longer the sequence is, the more time it may usually need. It is anticipated that the novel approach and the powerful predictor as presented in this paper will have a significant impact to Molecular Cell Biology, System Biology, Proteomics, Bioinformatics, and Drug Development."
https://openalex.org/W2001160691,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a life-threatening disease that occurs in immunodepressed patients when infected with Aspergillus fumigatus. This fungus is the second most-common causative agent of fungal disease after Candida albicans. Nevertheless, much remains to be learned about the mechanisms by which A. fulmigatus activates the innate immune system. We investigated the inflammatory response to conidia and hyphae of A. fumigatus and specifically, their capacity to trigger activation of an inflammasome. Our results show that in contrast to conidia, hyphal fragments induce NLRP3 inflammasome assembly, caspase-1 activation and IL-1β release from a human monocyte cell line. The ability of Aspergillus hyphae to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in the monocytes requires K+ efflux and ROS production. In addition, our data show that NLRP3 inflammasome activation as well as pro-IL-1β expression relies on the Syk tyrosine kinase, which is downstream from the pathogen recognition receptor Dectin-1, reinforcing the importance of Dectin-1 in the innate immune response against fungal infection. Furthermore, we show that treatment of monocytes with corticosteroids inhibits transcription of the gene encoding IL-1β. Thus, our data demonstrate that the innate immune response against A. fumigatus infection involves a two step activation process, with a first signal promoting expression and synthesis of pro-IL-1β; and a second signal, involving Syk-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1, allowing processing and secretion of the mature cytokine."
https://openalex.org/W1975898493,"Most P300-based brain-computer interface (BCI) approaches use the visual modality for stimulation. For use with patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) this might not be the preferable choice because of sight deterioration. Moreover, using a modality different from the visual one minimizes interference with possible visual feedback. Therefore, a multi-class BCI paradigm is proposed that uses spatially distributed, auditory cues. Ten healthy subjects participated in an offline oddball task with the spatial location of the stimuli being a discriminating cue. Experiments were done in free field, with an individual speaker for each location. Different inter-stimulus intervals of 1000 ms, 300 ms and 175 ms were tested. With averaging over multiple repetitions, selection scores went over 90% for most conditions, i.e., in over 90% of the trials the correct location was selected. One subject reached a 100% correct score. Corresponding information transfer rates were high, up to an average score of 17.39 bits/minute for the 175 ms condition (best subject 25.20 bits/minute). When presenting the stimuli through a single speaker, thus effectively canceling the spatial properties of the cue, selection scores went down below 70% for most subjects. We conclude that the proposed spatial auditory paradigm is successful for healthy subjects and shows promising results that may lead to a fast BCI that solely relies on the auditory sense."
https://openalex.org/W1985042306,"Odors, via the olfactory AWC neurons, trigger food searching in C. elegans. This study shows that the peptide NLP-1, co-released with glutamate from AWC neurons, acts to limit searching locomotion through a feedback loop that involves activation of the receptor NPR-11 on AIA interneurons and release of another peptide, INS-1, from the AIA neurons. Many neurons release classical transmitters together with neuropeptide co-transmitters whose functions are incompletely understood. Here we define the relationship between two transmitters in the olfactory system of C. elegans, showing that a neuropeptide-to-neuropeptide feedback loop alters sensory dynamics in primary olfactory neurons. The AWC olfactory neuron is glutamatergic and also expresses the peptide NLP-1. Worms with nlp-1 mutations show increased AWC-dependent behaviors, suggesting that NLP-1 limits the normal response. The receptor for NLP-1 is the G protein-coupled receptor NPR-11, which acts in postsynaptic AIA interneurons. Feedback from AIA interneurons modulates odor-evoked calcium dynamics in AWC olfactory neurons and requires INS-1, a neuropeptide released from AIA. The neuropeptide feedback loop dampens behavioral responses to odors on short and long timescales. Our results point to neuronal dynamics as a site of behavioral regulation and reveal the ability of neuropeptide feedback to remodel sensory networks on multiple timescales."
https://openalex.org/W2006085234,"Jeong-Sun Seo and colleagues report a catalog of common CNVs in Asians. The authors integrated high-resolution array CGH data with next-generation DNA sequencing data to discover 3,568 putative Asian-specific CNVs. Copy number variants (CNVs) account for the majority of human genomic diversity in terms of base coverage. Here, we have developed and applied a new method to combine high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) data with whole-genome DNA sequencing data to obtain a comprehensive catalog of common CNVs in Asian individuals. The genomes of 30 individuals from three Asian populations (Korean, Chinese and Japanese) were interrogated with an ultra-high-resolution array CGH platform containing 24 million probes. Whole-genome sequencing data from a reference genome (NA10851, with 28.3× coverage) and two Asian genomes (AK1, with 27.8× coverage and AK2, with 32.0× coverage) were used to transform the relative copy number information obtained from array CGH experiments into absolute copy number values. We discovered 5,177 CNVs, of which 3,547 were putative Asian-specific CNVs. These common CNVs in Asian populations will be a useful resource for subsequent genetic studies in these populations, and the new method of calling absolute CNVs will be essential for applying CNV data to personalized medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2133810562,"Brain structure and size require precise division of neural stem cells (NSCs), which self-renew and generate intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) and neurons. The factors that regulate NSCs remain poorly understood, and mechanistic explanations of how aberrant NSC division causes the reduced brain size seen in microcephaly are lacking. Here we show that Magoh, a component of the exon junction complex (EJC) that binds RNA, controls mouse cerebral cortical size by regulating NSC division. Magoh haploinsufficiency causes microcephaly because of INP depletion and neuronal apoptosis. Defective mitosis underlies these phenotypes, as depletion of EJC components disrupts mitotic spindle orientation and integrity, chromosome number and genomic stability. In utero rescue experiments showed that a key function of Magoh is to control levels of the microcephaly-associated protein Lis1 during neurogenesis. Our results uncover requirements for the EJC in brain development, NSC maintenance and mitosis, thereby implicating this complex in the pathogenesis of microcephaly."
https://openalex.org/W2082472298,"Dendritic distortion is problematic for neurons using temporal coding strategies, such as medial superior olivary neurons, which encode microsecond differences in binaural auditory input. Mathews et al. find that both the specific activation properties and spatial distribution of Kv1 channels compensate for passive cable filtering, helping to preserve binaural synaptic timing. Neurons in the medial superior olive process sound-localization cues via binaural coincidence detection, in which excitatory synaptic inputs from each ear are segregated onto different branches of a bipolar dendritic structure and summed at the soma and axon with submillisecond time resolution. Although synaptic timing and dynamics critically shape this computation, synaptic interactions with intrinsic ion channels have received less attention. Using paired somatic and dendritic patch-clamp recordings in gerbil brainstem slices together with compartmental modeling, we found that activation of Kv1 channels by dendritic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) accelerated membrane repolarization in a voltage-dependent manner and actively improved the time resolution of synaptic integration. We found that a somatically biased gradient of Kv1 channels underlies the degree of compensation for passive cable filtering during propagation of EPSPs in dendrites. Thus, both the spatial distribution and properties of Kv1 channels are important for preserving binaural synaptic timing."
https://openalex.org/W2046544919,"The photoprotective processes of photosynthetic organisms involve the dissipation of excess absorbed light energy as heat. Photoprotection in cyanobacteria is mechanistically distinct from that in plants; it involves the orange carotenoid protein (OCP), a water-soluble protein containing a single carotenoid. The OCP is a new member of the family of blue light-photoactive proteins; blue-green light triggers the OCP-mediated photoprotective response. Here we report structural and functional characterization of the wild type and two mutant forms of the OCP, from the model organism Synechocystis PCC6803. The structural analysis provides high resolution detail of the carotenoid-protein interactions that underlie the optical properties of the OCP, unique among carotenoid-proteins in binding a single pigment per polypeptide chain. Collectively, these data implicate several key amino acids in the function of the OCP and reveal that the photoconversion and photoprotective responses of the OCP to blue-green light can be decoupled."

https://openalex.org/W1991645570,"Notch and transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) play pivotal roles during vascular development and the pathogenesis of vascular disease. The interaction of these two pathways is not fully understood. The present study utilized primary human smooth muscle cells (SMC) to examine molecular cross-talk between TGFbeta1 and Notch signaling on contractile gene expression. Activation of Notch signaling using Notch intracellular domain or Jagged1 ligand induced smooth muscle alpha-actin (SM actin), smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, and calponin1, and the expression of Notch downstream effectors hairy-related transcription factors. Similarly, TGFbeta1 treatment of human aortic smooth muscle cells induced SM actin, calponin1, and smooth muscle protein 22-alpha (SM22alpha) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Hairy-related transcription factor proteins, which antagonize Notch activity, also suppressed the TGFbeta1-induced increase in SMC markers, suggesting a general mechanism of inhibition. We found that Notch and TGFbeta1 cooperatively activate SMC marker transcripts and protein through parallel signaling axes. Although the intracellular domain of Notch4 interacted with phosphoSmad2/3 in SMC, this interaction was not observed with Notch1 or Notch2. However, we found that CBF1 co-immunoprecipitated with phosphoSmad2/3, suggesting a mechanism to link canonical Notch signaling to phosphoSmad activity. Indeed, the combination of Notch activation and TGFbeta1 treatment led to synergistic activation of a TGFbeta-responsive promoter. This increase corresponded to increased levels of phosphoSmad2/3 interaction at Smad consensus binding sites within the SM actin, calponin1, and SM22alpha promoters. Thus, Notch and TGFbeta coordinately induce a molecular and functional contractile phenotype by co-regulation of Smad activity at SMC promoters."
https://openalex.org/W2043438785,"The regulation of translation and mRNA degradation in eukaryotic cells involves the formation of cytoplasmic mRNP granules referred to as P-bodies and stress granules. The yeast Pbp1 protein and its mammalian ortholog, Ataxin-2, localize to stress granules and promote their formation. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pbp1 also interacts with the Pab1, Lsm12, Pbp4, and Dhh1 proteins. In this work, we determined whether these Pbp1 interacting proteins also accumulated in stress granules and/or could affect their formation. These experiments revealed the following observations. First, the Lsm12, Pbp4, and Dhh1 proteins all accumulate in stress granules, whereas only the Dhh1 protein is a constitutive P-body component. Second, deletion or over-expression of the Pbp4 and Lsm12 proteins did not dramatically affect the formation of stress granules or P-bodies. In contrast, Pbp1 and Dhh1 over-expression inhibits cell growth, and for Dhh1, leads to the accumulation of stress granules. Finally, a strain lacking the Pab1 protein was reduced at forming stress granules, although they could still be detected. This indicates that Pab1 affects, but is not absolutely required for, stress granule formation. These observations offer new insight into the function of stress granule components with roles in stress granule assembly and mRNP regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2080041858,"This study focuses on the differential hydrologic response of individual watersheds to climate warming within the Sierra Nevada mountain region of California. We describe climate warming models for 15 west-slope Sierra Nevada watersheds in California under unimpaired conditions using WEAP21, a weekly one-dimensional rainfall-runoff model. Incremental climate warming alternatives increase air temperature uniformly by 2 degrees, 4 degrees, and 6 degrees C, but leave other climatic variables unchanged from observed values. Results are analyzed for changes in mean annual flow, peak runoff timing, and duration of low flow conditions to highlight which watersheds are most resilient to climate warming within a region, and how individual watersheds may be affected by changes to runoff quantity and timing. Results are compared with current water resources development and ecosystem services in each watershed to gain insight into how regional climate warming may affect water supply, hydropower generation, and montane ecosystems. Overall, watersheds in the northern Sierra Nevada are most vulnerable to decreased mean annual flow, southern-central watersheds are most susceptible to runoff timing changes, and the central portion of the range is most affected by longer periods with low flow conditions. Modeling results suggest the American and Mokelumne Rivers are most vulnerable to all three metrics, and the Kern River is the most resilient, in part from the high elevations of the watershed. Our research seeks to bridge information gaps between climate change modeling and regional management planning, helping to incorporate climate change into the development of regional adaptation strategies for Sierra Nevada watersheds."
https://openalex.org/W2079853060,"The DNA double-strand break (DSB) is the most toxic form of DNA damage. Studies aimed at characterizing DNA repair during development suggest that homologous recombination repair (HRR) is more critical in pluripotent cells compared to differentiated somatic cells in which nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) is dominant. We have characterized the DNA damage response (DDR) and quality of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and in vitro-derived neural cells. Resolution of ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF) was used as a surrogate for DSB repair. The resolution of gamma-H2AX foci occurred at a slower rate in hESCs compared to neural progenitors (NPs) and astrocytes perhaps reflective of more complex DSB repair in hESCs. In addition, the resolution of RAD51 foci, indicative of active homologous recombination repair (HRR), showed that hESCs as well as NPs have high capacity for HRR, whereas astrocytes do not. Importantly, the ATM kinase was shown to be critical for foci formation in astrocytes, but not in hESCs, suggesting that the DDR is different in these cells. Blocking the ATM kinase in astrocytes not only prevented the formation but also completely disassembled preformed repair foci. The ability of hESCs to form IRIF was abrogated with caffeine and siRNAs targeted against ATR, implicating that hESCs rely on ATR, rather than ATM for regulating DSB repair. This relationship dynamically changed as cells differentiated. Interestingly, while the inhibition of the DNA-PKcs kinase (and presumably non-homologous endjoining [NHEJ]) in astrocytes slowed IRIF resolution it did not in hESCs, suggesting that repair in hESCs does not utilize DNA-PKcs. Altogether, our results show that hESCs have efficient DSB repair that is largely ATR-dependent HRR, whereas astrocytes critically depend on ATM for NHEJ, which, in part, is DNA-PKcs-independent."
https://openalex.org/W2085994848,"The main lesion in Parkinson disease (PD) is loss of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons. Levodopa (L-DOPA) is the most widely used therapy, but it does not arrest disease progression. Some possible contributing factors to the continuing neuronal loss are oxidative stress, including oxidation of L-DOPA, and neurotoxins generated by locally activated microglia and astrocytes. A possible method of reducing these factors is to produce L-DOPA hybrid compounds that have antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties. Here we demonstrate the properties of four such L-DOPA hybrids based on coupling L-DOPA to four different hydrogen sulfide-donating compounds. The donors themselves were shown to be capable of conversion by isolated mitochondria to H(2)S or equivalent SH(-) ions. This capability was confirmed by in vivo results, showing a large increase in intracerebral dopamine and glutathione after iv administration in rats. When human microglia, astrocytes, and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were treated with these donating agents, they all accumulated H(2)S intracellularly as did their derivatives coupled to L-DOPA. The donating agents and the L-DOPA hybrids reduced the release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and nitric oxide from stimulated microglia, astrocytes as well as the THP-1 and U373 cell lines. They also demonstrated a neuroprotective effect by reducing the toxicity of supernatants from these stimulated cells to SH-SY5Y cells. L-DOPA itself was without effect in any of these assays. The H(2)S-releasing L-DOPA hybrid molecules also inhibited MAO B activity. They may be useful for the treatment of PD because of their significant antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective properties."

Circadian clock gene polymorphisms have been linked to sleep, mood and metabolic disorders. Our study aimed to examine polymorphisms in four key circadian clock genes in relation to seasonal variation, reproduction and well-being in a sample that was representative of the general population, aged 30 and over, living in Finland.Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the ARNTL, ARNTL2, CLOCK and NPAS2 genes were genotyped in 511 individuals. 19 variants were analyzed in relation to 31 phenotypes that were assessed in a health interview and examination study. With respect to reproduction, women with ARNTL rs2278749 TT genotype had more miscarriages and pregnancies, while NPAS2 rs11673746 T carriers had fewer miscarriages. NPAS2 rs2305160 A allele carriers had lower Global Seasonality Scores, a sum score of six items i.e. seasonal variation of sleep length, social activity, mood, weight, appetite and energy level. Furthermore, carriers of A allele at NPAS2 rs6725296 had greater loadings on the metabolic factor (weight and appetite) of the global seasonality score, whereas individuals with ARNTL rs6290035 TT genotype experienced less seasonal variation of energy level.ARNTL and NPAS2 gene variants were associated with reproduction and with seasonal variation. Earlier findings have linked ARNTL to infertility in mice, but this is the first time when any polymorphism of these genes is linked to fertility in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2140936706,"Histone modifications are critical in regulating gene expression, cell cycle, cell proliferation, and development. Relatively few studies have investigated whether Helicobacter pylori, the major cause of human gastric diseases, affects histone modification. We therefore investigated the effects of H. pylori infection on histone modifications in a global and promoter-specific manner in gastric epithelial cells. Infection of gastric epithelial cells by wild-type H. pylori induced time- and dose-dependent dephosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10 (H3 Ser10) and decreased acetylation of H3 lysine 23, but had no effects on seven other specific modifications. Different cag pathogenicity island (PAI)-containing-clinical isolates showed similar abilities to induce H3 Ser10 dephosphorylation. Mutation of cagA, vacA, nonphosphorylateable CagA mutant cagA(EPISA), or disruption of the flagella showed no effects, while deletion of the entire cagPAI restored the H3 Ser10 phosphorylation to control levels. Analysis of 27 cagPAI mutants indicated that the genes that caused H3 Ser10 dephosphorylation were similar to those that were previously found to induce interleukin-8, irrespective of CagA translocation. This effect was independent of ERK or p38 pathways and type I interferon signaling. Additionally, c-Jun and hsp70 gene expression was associated with this histone modification. These results demonstrate that H. pylori alters histone modification and host response via a cagA-, vacA-independent, but cagPAI-dependent mechanisms, which contribute to its persistent infection and pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1978535726,"Although endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis has been associated with pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, the cellular components involved have not been well delineated. The present study shows that matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 plays a role in the ER stress-induced apoptosis. ER stress induced by brefeldin A (BFA) or tunicamycin (TM) increases gene expression of MMP-3, selectively among various MMP subtypes, and the active form of MMP-3 (actMMP-3) in the brain-derived CATH.a cells. Pharmacological inhibition of enzyme activity, small interference RNA-mediated gene knockdown, and gene knock-out of MMP-3 all provide protection against ER stress. MMP-3 acts downstream of caspase-12, because both pharmacological inhibition and gene knockdown of caspase-12 attenuate the actMMP-3 increase, but inhibition and knock-out of MMP-3 do not alter caspase-12. Furthermore, independently of the increase in the protein level, the catalytic activity of MMP-3 enzyme can be increased via lowering of its endogenous inhibitor protein TIMP-1. Caspase-12 causes liberation of MMP-3 enzyme activity by degrading TIMP-1 that is already bound to actMMP-3. TIMP-1 is decreased in response to ER stress, and TIMP-1 overexpression leads to cell protection and a decrease in MMP-3 activity. Taken together, actMMP-3 protein level and catalytic activity are increased following caspase-12 activation during ER stress, and this in turn plays a role in the downstream apoptotic signaling in neuronal cells. MMP-3 and TIMP-1 may therefore serve as cellular targets for therapy against neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2049670606,"The seven-transmembrane receptor PalH and its coupled, positive-acting arrestin-like protein PalF are key components of a molecular sensor that in Aspergillus nidulans and other ascomycete fungi mediates activation of an intracellular signaling cascade by alkaline ambient pH. PalF is ubiquitinated in an alkaline pH- and PalH-dependent manner. We show here that PalF assists the plasma membrane localization of PalH and that PalF overexpression slightly hypersensitizes the pathway to alkaline pH but does not bypass the need for the ambient pH signal receptor in signaling. In contrast, covalent attachment of Ub to PalF activates the signaling pathway under acidic pH conditions in which the pathway is normally inactive, demonstrating a positive role for ubiquitination. We further show that PalF acts upstream of, or in concert with, the Bro1 domain-containing pH signaling protein PalC, which is normally recruited to cortical structures likely to represent active pH signaling foci under neutral/alkaline pH conditions. In agreement with its pathway-activating consequences, expression of PalF-Ub also promotes PalC cortical recruitment under acidic conditions. Notably, our data establish that expression of PalF-Ub, at approximately physiological levels, in a null palH background leads to a considerable degree of signaling even in the complete absence of the receptor. Thus PalF ubiquitination is a key, perhaps the sole, molecular trigger required for transmitting the alkaline pH signal to the downstream elements of the pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1988848774,"Protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) contains five N-linked glycosylation consensus sites as follows: three residing in the N terminus and two localized on the surface of the second extracellular loop (ECL2). To study the effect of N-linked glycosylation in the regulation of PAR1 signaling and trafficking, we generated mutants in which the critical asparagines of the consensus sites were mutated. Here, we report that both the PAR1 N terminus and ECL2 serve as sites for N-linked glycosylation but have different functions in the regulation of receptor signaling and trafficking. N-Linked glycosylation of the PAR1 N terminus is important for transport to the cell surface, whereas the PAR1 mutant lacking glycosylation at ECL2 (NA ECL2) trafficked to the cell surface like the wild-type receptor. However, activated PAR1 NA ECL2 mutant internalization was impaired compared with wild-type receptor, whereas constitutive internalization of unactivated receptor remained intact. Remarkably, thrombin-activated PAR1 NA ECL2 mutant displayed an enhanced maximal signaling response compared with wild-type receptor. The increased PAR1 NA ECL2 mutant signaling was not due to defects in the ability of thrombin to cleave the receptor or signal termination mechanisms. Rather, the PAR1 NA ECL2 mutant displayed a greater efficacy in thrombin-stimulated G protein signaling. Thus, N-linked glycosylation of the PAR1 extracellular surface likely influences ligand docking interactions and the stability of the active receptor conformation.

Protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) is the prototype PAR and the principal effector of thrombin signaling in most cell types. PAR1 is activated when the N terminus is cleaved by thrombin, which creates a new N terminus that acts as a tethered ligand that binds intramolecularly to the receptor to initiate transmembrane signaling (4Vu T.K.

The mechanism by which PAR1 selectively couples to specific G protein subtypes is not known. The current model for activation of GPCR signaling posits that agonist binding within the receptor helical core triggers rearrangements of transmembrane helices that expose cytoplasmic domains to initiate G protein activation (9Lagerström M.C.

An interesting feature of the ECL2 of PAR1 is the inclusion of two N-linked glycosylation consensus sites in the human receptor, which are absent in the Xenopus receptor. Although many mammalian GPCRs are post-translationally modified with N-linked glycosylation at the N terminus, it is less common for the extracellular loops to contain glycosylation modifications (14Landolt-Marticorena C. Reithmeier R.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Human PAR2 contains a single N-linked glycosylation consensus site within its ECL2 domain that may serve as a site for glycosylation, but its function is unknown (15Compton S.J. Drug Dev. Res. 2003; 59: 350-354Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 16Compton S.J. Sandhu S. Wijesuriya S.J. Hollenberg M.D. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 495-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Moreover, whether PAR1 is glycosylated at ECL2 and whether this affects ligand-induced receptor activation are not known. protease-activated receptor second extracellular loop early endosomal antigen-1 epidermal growth factor lithium chloride G protein coupled receptor inositol phosphates phosphoinositides peptide N-glycosidase F trans-Golgi network 230 thrombin Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium bovine serum albumin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis of variance wild type. Human PAR1 contains five potential N-linked glycosylation consensus sites as follows: three reside within the N terminus and two are localized in ECL2. Interestingly, several studies have suggested that PAR1 is highly glycosylated in different cell types based on a shift in its apparent molecular weight following glycosidase treatment (17Vouret-Craviari V.

Purif. 2008; 57: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In a yeast strain unable to glycosylate the receptor, PAR1 migrates as a single band close to its predicted molecular weight rather than a broad high molecular weight species typically observed in mammalian cells (18Kuliopulos A. Covic L. Seeley S.K. Sheridan P.J. Helin J. Costello C.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4572-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Moreover, global disruption of glycoprotein synthesis with the drug tunicamycin greatly diminished surface expression of PAR1 in Jurkat T lymphocyte cells (20Tordai A. Brass L.F. Gelfand E.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), suggesting that N-linked glycosylation of PAR1 is important for proper trafficking to the cell surface. However, the actual sites of PAR1 N-linked glycosylation and the importance of such site(s) in the regulation of receptor signaling and trafficking have not been determined. In this study, we examine for the first time the function of N-linked glycosylation of the PAR1 N terminus and ECL2 in the regulation of receptor signaling and trafficking. Our studies reveal that both the N terminus and ECL2 of PAR1 are targeted for N-linked glycosylation. N-Linked glycosylation of the N terminus of PAR1 contributes less to the overall glycosylation status of the receptor and appears to function in export of the receptor to the cell surface. However, a PAR1 mutant lacking ECL2 N-linked glycosylation displays impaired agonist-induced internalization, whereas constitutive internalization remained intact. Strikingly, we also show that ligand activation of PAR1 NA ECL2 mutant exhibits a marked increase in signaling that is not due to the altered ability of thrombin to cleave the receptor or to defects in signal termination. Rather, the PAR1 NA ECL2 mutant exhibits a greater efficacy in activation of G protein-mediated signaling responses. These findings suggest that glycosylation of PAR1 at the surface of ECL2 influences ligand docking interactions that enhance the stabilization of the active receptor conformation. Taken together, this study reveals for the first time distinct functions for PAR1 N-linked glycosylation at the N terminus versus ECL2 that are critical for the regulation of PAR1 signaling and trafficking.

HeLa cells were transiently transfected with a total plasmid amount of 0.4 μg per 24 wells or 2 μg per 6 wells using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and were assayed 48 h after transfection. A sequence alignment was performed using the EMBL-EBI ClustalW2 program. The following were used: Rattus norvegicus (NCBI reference sequence NM_012950.2); Mus musculus (NCBI reference sequence NM_010169.3); Cricetulus longicaudatus (GenBankTM accession number X61958.1); Homo sapiens (NCBI reference sequence NM_001992.3); Papio hamadryus (GenBankTM accession number AF028727.1); Equuas caballus (NCBI reference sequence XM_001503957.2); Canis lupis familiaris (NCBI reference sequence XM_546059.2), and Xenopus laevis (NCBI reference sequence NM_001085783.1). HeLa cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged PAR1 wild type or mutants were plated at 5 × 105 cells per well in 6-well culture dishes and grown overnight at 37 °C. Cells were washed and incubated with or without agonists diluted in DMEM containing 1 mg/ml BSA and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, for various times at 37 °C.

Cell lysates were solubilized for 1.5 h at 4 °C and clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The total amount of protein in cell lysates was quantified using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent (Thermo Scientific), and equivalent amounts of lysates were used for immunoprecipitation with the M2 anti-FLAG antibody or goat anti-mouse IgG control. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred to membranes, and PAR1 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-PAR1 antibody. Immunoblots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare), imaged by autoradiography, and quantitated with ImageJ software. To assess PAR1 degradation, cells were pretreated with 10 μm cycloheximide for 30 min at 37 °C and then incubated with or without agonists in serum-free media containing 10 μm cycloheximide for various times at 37 °C.

The amount of secondary antibody bound was determined by incubation with one-step 2,2′-azinobis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (Thermo Scientific) substrate for 10–20 min at 25 °C. An aliquot was removed, and the absorbance (A) was determined at 405 nm using a Molecular Devices SpectraMax Plus microplate reader (Sunnyvale, CA). HeLa cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged PAR1 or PAR2 wild type were plated at 5 × 105 cells per well for 6-well dishes or 1.0 × 105 cells per well for a 24-well culture dish coated with fibronectin and grown overnight at 37 °C. Cells were washed and then treated with 0.5 μg/ml tunicamycin (diluted in DMSO) or vehicle control in serum-free DMEM for 16 h at 37 °C. After incubation, cells were either lysed with Triton lysis buffer and immunoblotted for PAR1 expression or fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for cell surface ELISA as described above. For PNGase F treatments, cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged PAR1 or endogenous PAR1 were plated at 5 × 105 cells per well in a 6-well culture dish and grown overnight at 37 °C. Cells were lysed with Triton lysis buffer, processed, and then immunoprecipitated with M2 anti-FLAG antibody, anti-PAR1 WEDEE antibody, or goat anti-mouse IgG as described above. PAR1 immunoprecipitates were then resuspended in 100 μl of 1× glycoprotein denaturing buffer (0.5% SDS, 40 mm dithiothreitol), heated at 100 °C for 10 min, vortexed, and then centrifuged for 30 s at 25 °C. Beads were resuspended, and 20-μl aliquots were added to each reaction tube. PNGase F reaction mixture was prepared using 2 μl of enzyme per 20 μl of sample volume and added to reaction tubes. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for various times, then an equal volume of 2× sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, 5% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue) was added, and the analysis of PAR1 was determined by immunoblot. HeLa cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged PAR1 wild type or mutant were prepared as described for the PNGase F assay.

After incubation, cells were washed and then incubated for 1 h on ice with the Ca2+-dependent M1 anti-FLAG antibody diluted in DMEM containing 1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Under these conditions, only cell surface PAR1 is labeled with antibody. The remaining unbound antibody was washed away, and then pre-warmed DMEM was added to the cells for various times at 37 °C. The remaining bound antibody was then stripped from the cell surface by washing four times with Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA. Cells were lysed with Triton lysis buffer (3% BSA, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), and the accumulated intracellular antibody was measured by ELISA as described previously (24Paing M.M.

HeLa cells stably expressing FLAG-PAR1 wild type and mutants were plated at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells per well on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips in 12-well dishes. Cells were fixed and either left alone or permeabilized and immunostained for PAR1 using an anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (Rockland, MD) and processed for microscopy as described previously (22Trejo J.

Images were collected using an Olympus DSU spinning disk confocal microscope configured with a PlanApo 60× oil objective and a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER digital camera. Fluorescent images of X-Y sections at 0.28 μm were collected using Intelligent Imaging Innovations Slidebook 4.2 software, and the composite was configured using Adobe Photoshop CS3. We determined the rate at which thrombin cleaves FLAG-tagged PAR1 wild type and mutants essentially as described previously (25Ishii K. Hein L. Kobilka B. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9780-9786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells per well in a fibronectin-coated 24-well culture dish and grown overnight. Cells were washed and then incubated in the presence or absence of 1 or 10 nm thrombin for various times at 37 °C. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and the amount of uncleaved PAR1 was detected with the polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody and cell surface ELISA. HeLa cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged PAR1 wild type or mutants were plated at 1 × 105 cells per well in a fibronectin-coated 24-well culture dish and grown overnight at 37 °C. Cells were then labeled with 1 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis) diluted in serum- and inositol-free DMEM containing 1 mg/ml BSA overnight. Cells were washed and treated with or without agonists in DMEM containing 20 mm lithium chloride (LiCl) for various times at 37 °C, and accumulated [3H]inositol phosphates (IPs) were measured as described previously (24Paing M.M.

To determine whether recycling of activated PAR1 continued to signal, cells labeled with myo-[3H]inositol were treated with DMEM with or without 10 nm thrombin for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed, and medium was replaced with new media containing 20 mm LiCl. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and accumulated [3H]IPs were measured as described (24Paing M.M. Stutts A.B.

Data were analyzed using Prism software, and statistical analysis was determined using the Prism data analysis tool as noted. Statistical analysis was determined by performing Student's t test, one-way ANOVA, and Dunnett multiple comparison test, or two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post tests. The post-translational modification of nascent proteins by N-linked glycosylation occurs via covalent attachment of saccharides to asparagine residues of the consensus site NX(S/T) (where X is any amino acid except proline) (26Jones J. Krag S.S. Betenbaugh M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1726: 121-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Human PAR1 contains five potential consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation as follows: three are localized in the N terminus and two reside in the second extracellular loop (Fig. 1). We first determined whether the five putative N-linked glycosylation sites of PAR1 were conserved between species using Clustal W2 alignment. We found that among eight different species, the second N-terminal and fourth second extracellular loop N-linked glycosylation consensus sites were the most conserved (Fig. 1). Interestingly, X. laevis (frog) was the species with the least conservation compared with H. sapiens (human) PAR1 N-linked glycosylation sites, although the species P. hamadryas (baboon) and C. lupis familiaris (dog) sites were completely conserved. Whether the putative N-linked glycosylation sites of PAR1 are each modified by glycosylation or have specific functions important for regulation of PAR1 signaling and trafficking is not known. Next, we examined the glycosylation status of human PAR1 ectopically expressed in HeLa cells by examining its susceptibility to cleavage by PNGase F, an enzyme that cleaves all N-linked glycosylation except for those with an α-(1,3)-linked core fucose modification. HeLa cells expressing FLAG-tagged PAR1 were lysed and immunoprecipitated with M2 anti-FLAG antibody or IgG control and then incubated with PNGase F for various times at 37 °C. In untreated control cells, PAR1 migrated as a broad band between ∼64 and 98 kDa (Fig. 2A, lane 3), consistent with that observed previously (22Trejo J. Altschuler Y. Fu H.W. Mostov K.E. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31255-31265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), but significantly greater than the predicted molecular mass of ∼40 kDa. In contrast, after incubation with PNGase F, PAR1 migrated comparable with its predicted molecular mass of ∼40 kDa (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–6), suggesting that PAR1 is modified extensively by N-linked glycosylation. Endogenous PAR1 immunoprecipitated from human EA.hy926 endothelial cells also migrated as a high molecular broad band that was reduced to its predicted molecular weight after PNGase F treatment (Fig. 2B, lanes 2–4). To further confirm that PAR1 is modified by N-linked glycosylation, we examined the mobility of PAR1 following treatment with tunicamycin, a drug that blocks the first step of glycoprotein synthesis and functions as a global inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation. In cells treated with tunicamycin, PAR1 migrated at ∼40 kDa (Fig. 2C, lane 4) similar to that observed with PNGase F treatment (Fig. 2A) and distinct from the broad high molecular weight band observed with untreated PAR1. These findings strongly suggest that PAR1 is extensively glycosylated and is consistent with that reported previously (17Vouret-Craviari V. Grall D. Chambard J.C. Rasmussen U.B. Pouysségur J.

Purif. 2008; 57: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). N-Linked glycosylation of many transmembrane proteins, including GPCRs, is important for proper folding during translation and export to the cell surface (27Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 28Dennis J.W. Lau K.S. Demetriou M. Nabi I.R. Traffic. 2009; 10: 1569-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Thus, we first determined whether global disruption of PAR1 N-linked glycosylation affected receptor export to the cell surface using tunicamycin. PAR1 cell surface expression was substantially reduced in tunicamycin-treated cells compared with untreated control cells (Fig. 3), suggesting that global disruption of PAR1 N-linked glycosylation affects transport of the receptor to the cell surface as reported previously (20Tordai A. Brass L.F. Gelfand E.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To control for pleiotropic effects of tunicamycin on protein transport, we examined cell surface expression of PAR2. In contrast to PAR1, PAR2 surface expression was surprisingly unaffected in tunicamycin-treated HeLa cells (Fig. 3), although immunoblot analysis confirmed efficient deglycosylation of the receptor after tunicamycin treatment (Fig. 3, inset). These findings suggest that glycosylation of PAR1, but not PAR2, is important for export to the cell surface in HeLa cells. However, whether N-linked glycosylation of PAR1 occurs largely at the N terminus, second extracellular loop, or both is not known. Moreover, whether N-linked glycosylation serves specific functions in the regulation of PAR1 signaling and trafficking has not previously been investigated. To begin to delineate the function of potential N-linked glycosylation of the PAR1 N terminus versus ECL2, we generated PAR1 mutants lacking N-linked glycosylation"
https://openalex.org/W1988820070,"E1 ubiquitin-activating enzymes (UBAs) are large multidomain proteins that catalyze formation of a thioester bond between the terminal carboxylate of a ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like modifier (UBL) and a conserved cysteine in an E2 protein, producing reactive ubiquityl units for subsequent ligation to substrate lysines. Two important E1 reaction intermediates have been identified: a ubiquityl-adenylate phosphoester and a ubiquityl-enzyme thioester. However, the mechanism of thioester bond formation and its subsequent transfer to an E2 enzyme remains poorly understood. We have determined the crystal structure of the human UFM1 (ubiquitin-fold modifier 1) E1-activating enzyme UBA5, bound to ATP, revealing a structure that shares similarities with both large canonical E1 enzymes and smaller ancestral E1-like enzymes. In contrast to other E1 active site cysteines, which are in a variably sized domain that is separate and flexible relative to the adenylation domain, the catalytic cysteine of UBA5 (Cys250) is part of the adenylation domain in an α-helical motif. The novel position of the UBA5 catalytic cysteine and conformational changes associated with ATP binding provides insight into the possible mechanisms through which the ubiquityl-enzyme thioester is formed. These studies reveal structural features that further our understanding of the UBA5 enzyme reaction mechanism and provide insight into the evolution of ubiquitin activation."
https://openalex.org/W2100784533,"Recent association studies in multiple sclerosis (MS) have identified and replicated several single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) susceptibility loci including CLEC16A, IL2RA, IL7R, RPL5, CD58, CD40 and chromosome 12q13–14 in addition to the well established allele HLA-DR15. There is potential that these genetic susceptibility factors could also modulate MS disease severity, as demonstrated previously for the MS risk allele HLA-DR15. We investigated this hypothesis in a cohort of 1006 well characterised MS patients from South-Eastern Australia. We tested the MS-associated SNPs for association with five measures of disease severity incorporating disability, age of onset, cognition and brain atrophy. We observed trends towards association between the RPL5 risk SNP and time between first demyelinating event and relapse, and between the CD40 risk SNP and symbol digit test score. No associations were significant after correction for multiple testing. We found no evidence for the hypothesis that these new MS disease risk-associated SNPs influence disease severity."
https://openalex.org/W2063836788,"It is often claimed that genes affecting health in old age, such as cardiovascular and Alzheimer diseases, are beyond the reach of natural selection. We show in a simulation study based on known genetic (apolipoprotein E) and non-genetic risk factors (gender, diet, smoking, alcohol, exercise) that, because there is a statistical distribution of ages at which these genes exert their influence on morbidity and mortality, the effects of selection are in fact non-negligible. A gradual increase with each generation of the epsilon2 and epsilon3 alleles of the gene at the expense of the epsilon4 allele was predicted from the model. The epsilon2 allele frequency was found to increase slightly more rapidly than that for epsilon3, although there was no statistically significant difference between the two. Our result may explain the recent evolutionary history of the epsilon 2, 3 and 4 alleles of the apolipoprotein E gene and has wider relevance for genes affecting human longevity."
https://openalex.org/W2051945158,"Background Despite enormous environmental variability linked to glacial/interglacial climates of the Pleistocene, we have recently shown that marine diatom communities evolved slowly through gradual changes over the past 1.5 million years. Identifying the causes of this ecological stability is key for understanding the mechanisms that control the tempo and mode of community evolution. Methodology/Principal Findings If community assembly were controlled by local environmental selection rather than dispersal, environmental perturbations would change community composition, yet, this could revert once environmental conditions returned to previous-like states. We analyzed phytoplankton community composition across >104 km latitudinal transects in the Atlantic Ocean and show that local environmental selection of broadly dispersed species primarily controls community structure. Consistent with these results, three independent fossil records of marine diatoms over the past 250,000 years show cycles of community departure and recovery tightly synchronized with the temporal variations in Earth's climate. Conclusions/Significance Changes in habitat conditions dramatically alter community structure, yet, we conclude that the high dispersal of marine planktonic microbes erases the legacy of past environmental conditions, thereby decreasing the tempo of community evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2050578324,"Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a heterodimeric transcription factor that activates the cellular response to hypoxia. The HIF1α subunit is constantly synthesized and degraded under normoxia, but degradation is rapidly inhibited when oxygen levels drop. Oxygen-dependent hydroxylation by prolyl-4-hydroxylases (PHD) mediates HIF1α proteasome degradation. Brain ischemia limits the availability not only of oxygen but also of glucose. We hypothesized that this circumstance could have a modulating effect on HIF. We assessed the separate involvement of oxygen and glucose in HIF1α regulation in differentiated neuroblastoma cells subjected to ischemia. We report higher transcriptional activity and HIF1α expression under oxygen deprivation in the presence of glucose (OD), than in its absence (oxygen and glucose deprivation, OGD). Unexpectedly, HIF1α was not degraded at reoxygenation after an episode of OGD. This was not due to impairment of proteasome function, but was associated with lower HIF1α hydroxylation. Krebs cycle metabolites fumarate and succinate are known inhibitors of PHD, while α-ketoglutarate is a co-substrate of the reaction. Lack of HIF1α degradation in the presence of oxygen was accompanied by a very low α-ketoglutarate/fumarate ratio. Furthermore, treatment with a fumarate analogue prevented HIF1α degradation under normoxia. In all, our data suggest that postischemic metabolic alterations in Krebs cycle metabolites impair HIF1α degradation in the presence of oxygen by decreasing its hydroxylation, and highlight the involvement of metabolic pathways in HIF1α regulation besides the well known effects of oxygen.

Lack of HIF1α degradation in the presence of oxygen was accompanied by a very low α-ketoglutarate/fumarate ratio. Furthermore, treatment with a fumarate analogue prevented HIF1α degradation under normoxia. In all, our data suggest that postischemic metabolic alterations in Krebs cycle metabolites impair HIF1α degradation in the presence of oxygen by decreasing its hydroxylation, and highlight the involvement of metabolic pathways in HIF1α regulation besides the well known effects of oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W2087006939,"Background Aggregation and misfolded α-synuclein is thought to be central in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Heat-shock proteins (HSPs) that are involved in refolding and degradation processes could lower the aggregate load of α-synuclein and thus be beneficial in α-synucleinopathies. Methodology/Principal Findings We co-overexpressed human A53T point-mutated α-synuclein and human HSP70 in mice, both under the control of Thy1 regulatory sequences. Behavior read-outs showed no beneficial effect of HSP70 expression in mice. In contrast, motor coordination, grip strength and weight were even worse in the α-synucleinopathy model in the presence of HSP70 overexpression. Biochemical analyses revealed no differences in α-synuclein oligomers/aggregates, truncations and phosphorylation levels and α-synuclein localization was unchanged in immunostainings. Conclusion/Significance Overexpressing HSP70 in a mouse model of α-synucleinopathy did not lower the toxic load of α-synuclein species and had no beneficial effect on α-synuclein-related motor deficits."
https://openalex.org/W2062212003,"Background Hypoxia-inducible expression of the erythropoietin (EPO) gene is mediated principally by hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF-2α) in Hep3B cells under physiologic conditions. How/whether p300/CBP and the members of p160 coactivator family potentiate hypoxic induction of endogenous EPO and other HIF-2α and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) target genes remains unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings We demonstrate, using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis, that the histone acetyl transferase (HAT) coactivators p300, SRC-1 and SRC-3 are recruited to the 3′ enhancer of the EPO gene upon hypoxic stimulation, and that each associates with the enhancer in a periodic fashion. Hypoxia induced acetylation of the EPO gene 5′ promoter at histone 4 and lysine 23 of histone 3. Knocking down SRC-3, but not SRC-1 or SRC-2, using short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), reduced EPO transcriptional activity. Knocking down p300 resulted in dramatic down-regulation of hypoxic stimulation of EPO gene transcription, negated recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the gene's promoter, and eliminated hypoxia-stimulated acetylation at the promoter and recruitments of SRC-1 and SRC-3 to the enhancer. The inhibitory effects of knocking down p300 and the chromatin remodeling coactivator, Brm/Brg-1, on EPO transcription were additive, suggesting that p300 and Brm/Brg-1 act independently. p300 was also required for hypoxia induced transcription of the HIF-1α target gene, VEGF, but was dispensable for induction of two other HIF-1α target genes, PGK and LDHA. Knocking down CBP, a homolog of p300, augmented hypoxic induction of VEGF, LDHA and PGK. Different HIF target genes also exhibited different requirements for members of the p160 coactivator family. Conclusions/Significance p300 plays a central coactivator role in hypoxic induction of EPO. The coactivators exhibit different specificities for different HIF target genes and each can behave differently in transcriptional regulation of different target genes mediated by the same transcription factor."
https://openalex.org/W2041237746,"Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is associated with changes in gene expression. Extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) and RhoA [activated by hypertrophic agonists (e.g. endothelin-1)] regulate gene expression and are implicated in the response, but their relative significance in regulating the cardiomyocyte transcriptome is unknown. Our aim was to establish the significance of ERK1/2 and/or RhoA in the early cardiomyocyte transcriptomic response to endothelin-1.Cardiomyocytes were exposed to endothelin-1 (1 h) with/without PD184352 (to inhibit ERK1/2) or C3 transferase (C3T, to inhibit RhoA). RNA expression was analyzed using microarrays and qPCR. ERK1/2 signaling positively regulated approximately 65% of the early gene expression response to ET-1 with a small (approximately 2%) negative effect, whereas RhoA signaling positively regulated approximately 10% of the early gene expression response to ET-1 with a greater (approximately 14%) negative contribution. Of RNAs non-responsive to endothelin-1, 66 or 448 were regulated by PD184352 or C3T, respectively, indicating that RhoA had a more significant effect on baseline RNA expression. mRNAs upregulated by endothelin-1 encoded a number of receptor ligands (e.g. Ereg, Areg, Hbegf) and transcription factors (e.g. Abra/Srf) that potentially propagate the response.ERK1/2 dominates over RhoA in the early transcriptomic response to endothelin-1. RhoA plays a major role in maintaining baseline RNA expression but, with upregulation of Abra/Srf by endothelin-1, RhoA may regulate changes in RNA expression over longer times. Our data identify ERK1/2 as a more significant node than RhoA in regulating the early stages of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy."
https://openalex.org/W1980210721,"S-nitrosation is a post-translational protein modification and is one of the most important mechanisms of NO signaling. Endogenous S-nitrosothiol (SNO) quantification is a challenge for detailed functional studies. Here we developed an ESNOQ (Endogenous SNO Quantification) method which combines the stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) technique with the detergent-free biotin-switch assay and LC-MS/MS. After confirming the accuracy of quantification in this method, we obtained an endogenous S-nitrosation proteome for LPS/IFN-γ induced RAW264.7 cells. 27 S-nitrosated protein targets were confirmed and using our method we were able to obtain quantitative information on the level of S-nitrosation on each modified Cys. With this quantitative information, over 15 more S-nitrosated targets were identified than in previous studies. Based on the quantification results, we found that the S-nitrosation levels of different cysteines varied within one protein, providing direct evidence for differences in the sensitivity of cysteine residues to reactive nitrosative stress and that S-nitrosation is a site-specific modification. Gene ontology clustering shows that S-nitrosation targets in the LPS/IFN-γ induced RAW264.7 cell model were functionally enriched in protein translation and glycolysis, suggesting that S-nitrosation may function by regulating multiple pathways. The ESNOQ method described here thus provides a solution for quantification of multiple endogenous S-nitrosation events, and makes it possible to elucidate the network of relationships between endogenous S-nitrosation targets involved in different cellular processes."
https://openalex.org/W2025539135,"Background Intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi) with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) for the prevention of malaria has shown promising results in six trials. However, resistance to SP is rising and alternative drug combinations need to be evaluated to better understand the role of treatment versus prophylactic effects. Methods Between March 2004 and March 2008, in an area of western Kenya with year round malaria transmission with high seasonal intensity and high usage of insecticide-treated nets, we conducted a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial with SP plus 3 days of artesunate (SP-AS3), 3 days of amodiaquine-artesunate (AQ3-AS3), or 3 days of short-acting chlorproguanil-dapsone (CD3) administered at routine expanded programme of immunization visits (10 weeks, 14 weeks and 9 months). Principal Findings 1,365 subjects were included in the analysis. The incidence of first or only episode of clinical malaria during the first year of life (primary endpoint) was 0.98 episodes/person-year in the placebo group, 0.74 in the SP-AS3 group, 0.76 in the AQ3-AS3 group, and 0.82 in the CD3 group. The protective efficacy (PE) and 95% confidence intervals against the primary endpoint were: 25.7% (6.3, 41.1); 25.9% (6.8, 41.0); and 16.3% (−5.2, 33.5) in the SP-AS3, AQ3-AS3, and CD3 groups, respectively. The PEs for moderate-to-severe anaemia were: 27.5% (−6.9, 50.8); 23.1% (−11.9, 47.2); and 11.4% (−28.6, 39.0). The duration of the protective effect remained significant for up to 5 to 8 weeks for SP-AS3 and AQ3-AS3. There was no evidence for a sustained beneficial or rebound effect in the second year of life. All regimens were well tolerated. Conclusions These results support the view that IPTi with long-acting regimens provide protection against clinical malaria for up to 8 weeks even in the presence of high ITN coverage, and that the prophylactic rather than the treatment effect of IPTi appears central to its protective efficacy.

https://openalex.org/W2129274013,"Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a severe chronic hepatic parasitic disease currently emerging in central and eastern Europe. Untreated AE presents a high mortality (>90%) due to a severe hepatic destruction as a result of parasitic metacestode proliferation which behaves like a malignant tumor. Despite this severe course and outcome of disease, the genetic program that regulates the host response leading to organ damage as a consequence of hepatic alveolar echinococcosis is largely unknown.We used a mouse model of AE to assess gene expression profiles in the liver after establishment of a chronic disease status as a result of a primary peroral infection with eggs of the fox tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis. Among 38 genes differentially regulated (false discovery rate adjusted p</=0.05), 35 genes were assigned to the functional gene ontology group <immune response>, while 3 associated with the functional group <intermediary metabolism>. Upregulated genes associated with <immune response> could be clustered into functional subgroups including <macrophages>, <APCs>, <lymphocytes, chemokines and regulation>, <B-cells> and <eosinophils>. Two downregulated genes related to <lymphocytes, chemokines and regulation> and <intermediary metabolism>, respectively. The <immune response> genes either associated with an <immunosupression> or an <immunostimulation> pathway. From the overexpressed genes, 18 genes were subsequently processed with a Custom Array microfluidic card system in order to assess respective expression status at the mRNA level relative to 5 reference genes (Gapdh, Est1, Rlp3, Mdh-1, Rpl37) selected upon a constitutive and stable expression level. The results generated by the two independent tools used for the assessment of gene expression, i.e., microarray and microfluidic card system, exhibited a high level of congruency (Spearman correlation rho = 0.81, p = 7.87e-5) and thus validated the applied methods.Based on this set of biomarkers, new diagnostic targets have been made available to predict disease status and progression. These biomarkers may also offer new targets for immuno-therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2112506691,"Background The development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms depends on sheets of epithelial cells. Bazooka (Baz; PAR-3) localizes to the apical circumference of epithelial cells and is a key hub in the protein interaction network regulating epithelial structure. We sought to identify additional proteins that function with Baz to regulate epithelial structure in the Drosophila embryo. Methodology/Principal Findings The baz zygotic mutant cuticle phenotype could be dominantly enhanced by loss of known interaction partners. To identify additional enhancers, we screened molecularly defined chromosome 2 and 3 deficiencies. 37 deficiencies acted as strong dominant enhancers. Using deficiency mapping, bioinformatics, and available single gene mutations, we identified 17 interacting genes encoding known and predicted polarity, cytoskeletal, transmembrane, trafficking and signaling proteins. For each gene, their loss of function enhanced adherens junction defects in zygotic baz mutants during early embryogenesis. To further evaluate involvement in epithelial polarity, we generated GFP fusion proteins for 15 of the genes which had not been found to localize to the apical domain previously. We found that GFP fusion proteins for Drosophila ASAP, Arf79F, CG11210, Septin 5 and Sds22 could be recruited to the apical circumference of epithelial cells. Nine of the other proteins showed various intracellular distributions, and one was not detected. Conclusions/Significance Our enhancer screen identified 17 genes that function with Baz to regulate epithelial structure in the Drosophila embryo. Our secondary localization screen indicated that some of the proteins may affect epithelial cell polarity by acting at the apical cell cortex while others may act through intracellular processes. For 13 of the 17 genes, this is the first report of a link to baz or the regulation of epithelial structure."
https://openalex.org/W2151985965,"Background Retinoids regulate key developmental pathways throughout life, and have potential uses for differentiation therapy. It should be possible to identify novel retinoids by coupling new chemical reactions with screens using the zebrafish embryonic model. Principal Findings We synthesized novel retinoid analogues and derivatives by amide coupling, obtaining 80–92% yields. A small library of these compounds was screened for bioactivity in living zebrafish embryos. We found that several structurally related compounds significantly affect development. Distinct phenotypes are generated depending on time of exposure, and we characterize one compound (BT10) that produces specific cardiovascular defects when added 1 day post fertilization. When compared to retinoic acid (ATRA), BT10 shows similar but not identical changes in the expression pattern of embryonic genes that are known targets of the retinoid pathway. Reporter assays determined that BT10 interacts with all three RAR receptor sub-types, but has no activity for RXR receptors, at all concentrations tested. Conclusions Our screen has identified a novel retinoid with specificity for retinoid receptors. This lead compound may be useful for manipulating components of retinoid signaling networks, and may be further derivatized for enhanced activity."
https://openalex.org/W2063187320,"Background Francisella tularensis subspecies tularensis is the causative agent of a spectrum of diseases collectively known as tularemia. An attenuated live vaccine strain (LVS) has been shown to be efficacious in humans, but safety concerns have prevented its licensure by the FDA. Recently, F. tularensis LVS has been produced under Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP guidelines). Little is known about the immunogenicity of this new vaccine preparation in comparison with extensive studies conducted with laboratory passaged strains of LVS. Thus, the aim of the current work was to evaluate the repertoire of antibodies produced in mouse strains vaccinated with the new LVS vaccine preparation. Methodology/Principal Findings In the current study, we used an immunoproteomics approach to examine the repertoire of antibodies induced following successful immunization of BALB/c versus unsuccessful vaccination of C57BL/6 mice with the new preparation of F. tularensis LVS. Successful vaccination of BALB/c mice elicited antibodies to nine identified proteins that were not recognized by antisera from vaccinated but unprotected C57BL/6 mice. In addition, the CGMP formulation of LVS stimulated a greater repertoire of antibodies following vaccination compared to vaccination with laboratory passaged ATCC LVS strain. A total of 15 immunoreactive proteins were identified in both studies, however, 16 immunoreactive proteins were uniquely reactive with sera from the new formulation of LVS. Conclusions/Significance This is the first report characterising the antibody based immune response of the new formulation of LVS in the widely used murine model of tularemia. Using two mouse strains, we show that successfully vaccinated mice can be distinguished from unsuccessfully vaccinated mice based upon the repertoire of antibodies generated. This opens the door towards downselection of antigens for incorporation into tularemia subunit vaccines. In addition, this work also highlights differences in the humoral immune response to vaccination with the commonly used laboratory LVS strain and the new vaccine formulation of LVS."
https://openalex.org/W2076338142,"Carbazole is a recalcitrant compound with a dioxin-like structure and possesses mutagenic and toxic activities. Bacteria respond to a xenobiotic by recruiting exogenous genes to establish a pathway to degrade the xenobiotic, which is necessary for their adaptation and survival. Usually, this process is mediated by mobile genetic elements such as plasmids, transposons, and insertion sequences.The genes encoding the enzymes responsible for the degradation of carbazole to catechol via anthranilate were cloned, sequenced, and characterized from a carbazole-degrading Sphingomonas sp. strain XLDN2-5. The car gene cluster (carRAaBaBbCAc) and fdr gene were accompanied on both sides by two copies of IS6100 elements, and organized as IS6100::ISSsp1-ORF1-carRAaBaBbCAc-ORF8-IS6100-fdr-IS6100. Carbazole was converted by carbazole 1,9a-dioxygenase (CARDO, CarAaAcFdr), meta-cleavage enzyme (CarBaBb), and hydrolase (CarC) to anthranilate and 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate. The fdr gene encoded a novel ferredoxin reductase whose absence resulted in lower transformation activity of carbazole by CarAa and CarAc. The ant gene cluster (antRAcAdAbAa) which was involved in the conversion of anthranilate to catechol was also sandwiched between two IS6100 elements as IS6100-antRAcAdAbAa-IS6100. Anthranilate 1,2-dioxygenase (ANTDO) was composed of a reductase (AntAa), a ferredoxin (AntAb), and a two-subunit terminal oxygenase (AntAcAd). Reverse transcription-PCR results suggested that carAaBaBbCAc gene cluster, fdr, and antRAcAdAbAa gene cluster were induced when strain XLDN2-5 was exposed to carbazole. Expression of both CARDO and ANTDO in Escherichia coli required the presence of the natural reductases for full enzymatic activity.We predict that IS6100 might play an important role in the establishment of carbazole-degrading pathway, which endows the host to adapt to novel compounds in the environment. The organization of the car and ant genes in strain XLDN2-5 was unique, which showed strong evolutionary trail of gene recruitment mediated by IS6100 and presented a remarkable example of rearrangements and pathway establishments."
https://openalex.org/W2092520234,"Background The removal of introns from pre-mRNA is carried out by a large macromolecular machine called the spliceosome. The peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase PPIL1 is a component of the human spliceosome and binds to the spliceosomal SKIP protein via a binding site distinct from its active site. Principal Findings Here, we have studied the PPIL1 protein and its interaction with SKIP biochemically and by X-ray crystallography. A minimal linear binding epitope derived from the SKIP protein could be determined using a peptide array. A 36-residue region of SKIP centred on an eight-residue epitope suffices to bind PPIL1 in pull-down experiments. The crystal structure of PPIL1 in complex with the inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA) was obtained at a resolution of 1.15 Å and exhibited two bound Cd2+ ions that enabled SAD phasing. PPIL1 residues that have previously been implicated in binding of SKIP are involved in the coordination of Cd2+ ions in the present crystal structure. Employing the present crystal structure, the determined minimal binding epitope and previously published NMR data [1], a molecular docking study was performed. In the docked model of the PPIL1·SKIP interaction, a proline residue of SKIP is buried in a hydrophobic pocket of PPIL1. This hydrophobic contact is encircled by several hydrogen bonds between the SKIP peptide and PPIL1. Conclusion We characterized a short, linear epitope of SKIP that is sufficient to bind the PPIL1 protein. Our data indicate that this SKIP peptide could function in recruiting PPIL1 into the core of the spliceosome. We present a molecular model for the binding mode of SKIP to PPIL1 which emphasizes the versatility of cyclophilin-type PPIases to engage in additional interactions with other proteins apart from active site contacts despite their limited surface area."
https://openalex.org/W2049036219,"Ultrasonic motors (USM) are based on the concept of driving the rotor by a mechanical vibration excited on the stator via piezoelectric effect. USM exhibit merits such as simple structure, quick response, quiet operation, self-locking when power off, nonelectromagnetic radiation and higher position accuracy.A cylindrical type traveling wave ultrasonic motor using cantilever type composite transducer was proposed in this paper. There are two cantilevers on the outside surface of cylinder, four longitudinal PZT ceramics are set between the cantilevers, and four bending PZT ceramics are set on each outside surface of cantilevers. Two degenerate flexural vibration modes spatially and temporally orthogonal to each other in the cylinder are excited by the composite transducer. In this new design, a single transducer can excite a flexural traveling wave in the cylinder. Thus, elliptical motions are achieved on the teeth. The actuating mechanism of proposed motor was analyzed. The stator was designed with FEM. The two vibration modes of stator were degenerated. Transient analysis was developed to gain the vibration characteristic of stator, and results indicate the motion trajectories of nodes on the teeth are nearly ellipses.The study results verify the feasibility of the proposed design. The wave excited in the cylinder isn't an ideal traveling wave, and the vibration amplitudes are inconsistent. The distortion of traveling wave is generated by the deformation of bending vibration mode of cylinder, which is caused by the coupling effect between the cylinder and transducer. Analysis results also prove that the objective motions of nodes on the teeth are three-dimensional vibrations. But, the vibration in axial direction is minute compared with the vibrations in circumferential and radial direction. The results of this paper can guide the development of this new type of motor."
https://openalex.org/W1970535739,"Robustness is an essential feature of biological systems, and any mathematical model that describes such a system should reflect this feature. Especially, persistence of oscillatory behavior is an important issue. A benchmark model for this phenomenon is the Laub-Loomis model, a nonlinear model for cAMP oscillations in Dictyostelium discoideum. This model captures the most important features of biomolecular networks oscillating at constant frequencies. Nevertheless, the robustness of its oscillatory behavior is not yet fully understood. Given a system that exhibits oscillating behavior for some set of parameters, the central question of robustness is how far the parameters may be changed, such that the qualitative behavior does not change. The determination of such a ""robustness region"" in parameter space is an intricate task. If the number of parameters is high, it may be also time consuming. In the literature, several methods are proposed that partially tackle this problem. For example, some methods only detect particular bifurcations, or only find a relatively small box-shaped estimate for an irregularly shaped robustness region. Here, we present an approach that is much more general, and is especially designed to be efficient for systems with a large number of parameters. As an illustration, we apply the method first to a well understood low-dimensional system, the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model. This is a predator-prey model featuring satiation of the predator. It has only two parameters and its bifurcation diagram is available in the literature. We find a good agreement with the existing knowledge about this model. When we apply the new method to the high dimensional Laub-Loomis model, we obtain a much larger robustness region than reported earlier in the literature. This clearly demonstrates the power of our method. From the results, we conclude that the biological system underlying is much more robust than was realized until now."
https://openalex.org/W2051022221,"Previous attempts to isolate pluripotent cell lines from rat preimplantation embryo in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell culture conditions (serum and LIF) were unsuccessful, however the resulting cells exhibited the expression of such traditional pluripotency markers as SSEA-1 and alkaline phosphatase. We addressed the question, which kind of cell lineages are produced from rat preimplantation embryo under ""classical"" mouse ES conditions.We characterized two cell lines (C5 and B10) which were obtained from rat blastocysts in medium with serum and LIF. In the B10 cell line we found the expression of genes known to be expressed in trophoblast, Cdx-2, cytokeratin-7, and Hand-1. Also, B10 cells invaded the trophectodermal layer upon injection into rat blastocysts. In contrast to mouse Trophoblast Stem (TS) cells proliferation of B10 cells occurred independently of FGF4. Cells of the C5 line expressed traditional markers of extraembryonic-endoderm (XEN) cells, in particular, GATA-4, but also the pluripotency markers SSEA-1 and Oct-4. C5 cell proliferation exhibited dependence on LIF, which is not known to be required by mouse XEN cells.Our results confirm and extend previous findings about differences between blastocyst-derived cell lines of rat and mice. Our data show, that the B10 cell line represents a population of FGF4-independent rat TS-like cells. C5 cells show features that have recently become known as characteristic of rat XEN cells. Early passages of C5 and B10 cells contained both, TS and XEN cells. We speculate, that mechanisms maintaining self-renewal of cell lineages in rat preimplantation embryo and their in vitro counterparts, including ES, TS and XEN cells are different than in respective mouse lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2074091009,"Network analysis has been performed on large-scale medical data, capturing the global topology of drugs, targets, and disease relationships. A smaller-scale network is amenable to a more detailed and focused analysis of the individual members and their interactions in a network, which can complement the global topological descriptions of a network system. Analysis of these smaller networks can help address questions, i.e., what governs the pairing of the different cancers and drugs, is it driven by molecular findings or other factors, such as death statistics.We defined global and local lethality values representing death rates relative to other cancers vs. within a cancer. We generated two cancer networks, one of cancer types that share Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs (FDA cancer network), and another of cancer types that share clinical trials of FDA approved drugs (clinical trial cancer network). Breast cancer is the only cancer type with significant weighted degree values in both cancer networks. Lung cancer is significantly connected in the FDA cancer network, whereas ovarian cancer and lymphoma are significantly connected in the clinical trial cancer network. Correlation and linear regression analyses showed that global lethality impacts the drug approval and trial numbers, whereas, local lethality impacts the amount of drug sharing in trials and approvals. However, this effect does not apply to pancreatic, liver, and esophagus cancers as the sharing of drugs for these cancers is very low. We also collected mutation target information to generate cancer type associations which were compared with the cancer type associations derived from the drug target information. The analysis showed a weak overlap between the mutation and drug target based networks.The clinical and FDA cancer networks are differentially connected, with only breast cancer significantly connected in both networks. The networks of cancer-drug associations are moderately affected by the death statistics. A strong overlap does not exist between the cancer-drug associations and the molecular information. Overall, this analysis provides a systems level view of cancer drugs and suggests that death statistics (i.e. global vs. local lethality) have a differential impact on the number of approvals, trials and drug sharing."
https://openalex.org/W1998912372,"Background Diagnosis of soft tissue sarcomas (STS) is challenging. Many remain unclassified (not-otherwise-specified, NOS) or grouped in controversial categories such as malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), with unclear therapeutic value. We analyzed several independent microarray datasets, to identify a predictor, use it to classify unclassifiable sarcomas, and assess oncogenic pathway activation and chemotherapy response. Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed 5 independent datasets (325 tumor arrays). We developed and validated a predictor, which was used to reclassify MFH and NOS sarcomas. The molecular “match” between MFH and their predicted subtypes was assessed using genome-wide hierarchical clustering and Subclass-Mapping. Findings were validated in 15 paraffin samples profiled on the DASL platform. Bayesian models of oncogenic pathway activation and chemotherapy response were applied to individual STS samples. A 170-gene predictor was developed and independently validated (80-85% accuracy in all datasets). Most MFH and NOS tumors were reclassified as leiomyosarcomas, liposarcomas and fibrosarcomas. “Molecular match” between MFH and their predicted STS subtypes was confirmed both within and across datasets. This classification revealed previously unrecognized tissue differentiation lines (adipocyte, fibroblastic, smooth-muscle) and was reproduced in paraffin specimens. Different sarcoma subtypes demonstrated distinct oncogenic pathway activation patterns, and reclassified MFH tumors shared oncogenic pathway activation patterns with their predicted subtypes. These patterns were associated with predicted resistance to chemotherapeutic agents commonly used in sarcomas. Conclusions/Significance STS profiling can aid in diagnosis through a predictor tracking distinct tissue differentiation in unclassified tumors, and in therapeutic management via oncogenic pathway activation and chemotherapy response assessment."

Upon staurosporine treatment, a Cdc25A C-terminal 37-kDa fragment, designated C37, was generated by caspase cleavage at Asp-223. Thr-507 in C37 became dephosphorylated, which prevented 14-3-3 binding, as shown previously. C37 exhibited higher phosphatase activity than full-length Cdc25A.

The stability of Cdc25A is regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Rapid Cdc25A degradation in response to DNA damage is a part of the DNA damage checkpoint mechanism that protects genomic integrity by arresting the cell cycle progression and allowing cells to repair damaged DNA. Although Cdc25A plays a clear role in both cell cycle regulation and cell cycle checkpoint control, it is unknown how Cdc25A promotes apoptosis. It has been reported that the ectopic expression of Cdc25A induces apoptosis in 3T3 LI cells depleted of growth factors (20Galaktionov K. Chen X. Beach D. Nature. 1996; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), but this mechanism remains unclear. Cdc25A activates Cdc2 or Cdk2 by removing inhibitory phosphates from Cdks. Cdc2 and Cdk2 are activated in a caspase-dependent manner during Fas- or staurosporine-induced apoptosis (21Zhou B.B. Li H. Yuan J. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 6785-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Moreover, the activation of Cdc2 is required for apoptosis induced by fragmentin-2 or staurosporine (26Shi L. Nishioka W.K. Th'ng J. Bradbury E.M. Litchfield D.W. Greenberg A.H. Science. 1994; 263: 1143-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). The activation mechanism for Cdc2 or Cdk2 during apoptosis remains unclear. After examining the amino acid sequence of Cdc25A, we discovered several possible caspase consensus motifs. Based on this information, we hypothesize that Cdc25A is a substrate for caspase, and the Cdc25A fragment generated by caspase cleavage activates Cdc2 and/or Cdk2, resulting in apoptosis. Thus, we used staurosporine, a typical inducer for apoptosis, to elucidate the possible role of Cdc25A in promoting apoptosis in Jurkat cells. This study reports a novel molecular mechanism in which Cdc25A, a pro-apoptotic protein, promotes apoptosis. Upon staurosporine treatment, a Cdc25A C-terminal 37-kDa fragment, designated C37, was generated by caspase cleavage at Asp-223, and its Thr-507 became dephosphorylated. C37 with alanine substitution for Thr-507 (C37/T507A) interacted with Cdc2, Cdk2, cyclin A, and cyclin B1 and significantly activated cyclin B1 and Cdc2-associated kinase activities. The dephosphorylation of Thr-507 might expose the Cdc2/Cdk2-docking site in C37. In the absence of staurosporine, C37/T507A induced apoptosis, resulting from activating cyclin B1/Cdc2 but not Cdk2. In summary, staurosporine causes caspase to cleave Cdc25A and promotes the dephosphorylation of Thr-507. As a result, the cyclin B1-Cdc2 complex is activated but not through the activation of Cdk2, which leads to apoptosis. Therefore, this study presents a novel pathway of staurosporine induced-apoptosis. Jurkat and K562 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 2 mm GlutaMAX (Invitrogen). HeLa and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with the same supplements. Staurosporine and caspase inhibitor I were purchased from Calbiochem, and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was acquired from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Cdc25A (F-6), cyclin A, cyclin B1, Cdc2, and Cdk2 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, α-tubulin, and M2 monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Cleaved caspase 3 (Asp-175) (5A1) rabbit monoclonal antibody (only against activated caspase3) and phospho-Cdc2 (Tyr-15) antibody were acquired from Cell Signaling. Anti-Fas (7C11), anti-His (RGS-His), CD20, anti-TurboGFP(d) (against copepod green fluorescence protein (copGFP)), and phospho-Cdc25A-Thr-507 antibodies were purchased from Beckman Coulter, Qiagen, NeoMarkers, Evrogen, and Abgent, respectively. Anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 546 or 647 was obtained from Invitrogen. Plasmids, pcDNA3-Myc-Cdc25A, pGEX2T′-Cdc25A, pGEX2T′-Cdc25A/C431S, and pCD20, were gifts from Dr. Helen Piwnica-Worms (Washington University). pcDNA3-His was constructed by subcloning the adaptor (supplemental Table S1) to pcDNA3 through HindIII and BamHI. The Cdc25A BamHI/EcoRI fragment from pcDNA3-Myc-Cdc25A and the first 223 amino acids amplified by PCR using two primers (supplemental Table S2) were subcloned to pcDNA3-His, labeled as pcDNA3-His-Cdc25A and pcDNA3-His-Cdc25A/1–223. The DNA fragment encoding three copies of FLAG epitope was amplified by PCR using p3×FLAG CMV10 (Sigma) as a template and two primers (supplemental Table S2) and subsequently subcloned to pcDNA3 through HindIII and BamHI, designated as pcDNA3–3×FLAG. pcDNA3–3×FLAG Cdc25A/224–524 was made by subcloning the Cdc25A/224–524 BamHI/EcoRI fragment amplified by PCR using two primers (supplemental Table S2) into pcDNA3–3×FLAG. Using the primers listed in supplemental Table S2, Cdc25A-His and Cdc25A/224–524-His BamHI/EcoRI fragments were amplified by PCR and subsequently subcloned to pcDNA3, called pcDNA3-Cdc25A-His and pcDNA3-Cdc25A/224–524-His. To generate pGEX2T′-Cdc25A/1–223 or Cdc25A/224–524, the Cdc25A fragment in pGEX2T′-Cdc25A was replaced with the Cdc25A/1–223 or Cdc25A/224–524 BamHI/EcoRI fragment from pcDNA3-His-Cdc25A/1–223 or pcDNA3–3× FLAG Cdc25A/224–524. To transiently co-express copGFP and any of Cdc25A and its mutants, pCDF1-MCS2-EF1-copGFP (System Biosciences), only with a poly(A) signal downstream of the copGFP-coding sequence, was modified by adding a NotI/PvuII fragment containing a poly(A) signal from pcDNA3 between the cytomegalovirus and EF1 promoters through a NotI site, labeled as pCDF1-MCS2-poly(A)-EF1-copGFP. The His-Cdc25A HindIII/EcoRI fragment from pcDNA3-His-Cdc25A was subcloned to pCDF1-MCS2-poly(A)-EF1-copGFP through BamHI and EcoRI, named pCDF1-MCS2-poly(A)-EF1-copGFP-His-Cdc25A. A Cdc25A/1–223 or Cdc25A/224–524 BamHI/EcoRI fragment replaced the Cdc25A fragment in pCDF1-MCS2-poly(A)-EF1-copGFP-His-Cdc25A to create pCDF1-MCS2-poly(A)-EF1-copGFP-His-Cdc25A/1–223 or His-Cdc25A/224–524, respectively. Plasmid pcDNA3-CD20 was used to construct serial plasmids expressing fusion proteins with a presumed caspase consensus motif from Cdc25A between N-terminally tagged His6 and CD20. CD20 cDNA was amplified by PCR using pCD20 as a template and two primers (supplemental Table S2) and subsequently subcloned to pcDNA3 through XhoI. pcDNA3- His-CD20 was prepared by subcloning a CD20 BamHI/XbaI fragment from pcDNA3-CD20 to pcDNA3-His. CD20 in pcDNA3-His-CD20 is not in the reading frame until the adaptor (supplemental Table S3) encoding a presumed caspase consensus motif containing eight amino acids from Cdc25A was subcloned to pcDNA3-His-CD20 through BamHI and NotI. All of the mutation sites were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and primers listed in supplemental Table S4. Each mutation site was verified by sequencing. To transfect Jurkat or K562 cells, 2 × 105 cells were first suspended in 10 μl of buffer R containing different amounts of plasmid DNA. Jurkat cells were then electroporated with MicroPorator MP-100 (Digital Bio) at a pulse voltage of 1240, pulse width of 30, and pulse number of 1. Alternatively, K562 cells were electroporated at a pulse voltage of 1000, pulse width of 50, and pulse number of 1. The cells were then seeded to a well containing 500 μl of prewarmed RPMI complete medium. Depending on the experiments, cells were harvested at different time periods after electroporation. HeLa or 293T cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 following the steps recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Knockdown of Cdc25A, Cdc2, Cdk2, or cyclin B1 in Jurkat cells was achieved through delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) (supplemental Table S5) by electroporation. 2 × 105 Jurkat cells were suspended in 10 μl of buffer R containing either 8.4 μm Cdc25A, Cdc2, or Cdk2 siRNA or 7.4 μm cyclin B1 siRNA. Depending on the experiments, cells were harvested at different time periods after electroporation. Green fluorescent protein and luciferase siRNAs (supplemental Table S5) were used as controls. Small interfering RNAs were synthesized by Ambion. 0.5–1 × 106 cells were fixed with 1.5% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 8.0) at room temperature for 10 min, immunostained for Cdc2/Cdk2-Tyr-15 phosphorylation with a phospho-Cdc2-Tyr-15 antibody, and analyzed with a FACSCalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences). This method was described in detail by Krutzik and Nolan (35Krutzik P.O. Nolan G.P. Cytometry. 2003; 55: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Because of low transfection efficiency, copGFP-positive cells were gated with a FACSCalibur cytometer after electroporation with various pCDF1-MCS2-poly(A)-EF1-copGFP constructs. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazolyl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium assay was performed using the CellTiter96 Aqueous One Solution cell proliferation assay kit (Promega). Apoptotic cells were detected by the annexin V-Cy3 apoptosis detection kit (BioVision), the phycoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal active caspase-3 antibody apoptosis kit (Pharmingen), or the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick end-labeling assay using the apo-BrdUrd-Red in situ DNA fragmentation assay kit (BioVision). To detect sub-G1 cells, cells were fixed with 0.5% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 8.0) at room temperature for 10 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with ice-cold 70% ethanol, stained by 30 μg/ml propidium iodide, and analyzed with a FACSCalibur cytometer. Cell lysates for immunoblotting were made in MCLB buffer (2Chen M.S. Ryan C.E. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7488-7497Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, a 1:100-diluted protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and a 1:100-diluted serine/threonine protein phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). To examine phosphorylation status of Thr-507 in Cdc25A, Jurkat cells were electroporated with pcDNA3–3×FLAG Cdc25A/224–524, treated with vehicle or 300 nm staurosporine at a 37 °C incubator for 2 h, and lysed in MCLB buffer with the described supplements. Each cell lysate was incubated overnight with M2 antibody-agarose beads at 4 °C, and each bead pellet was washed with MCLB buffer six times. Proteins immobilized in the beads were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies as indicated in the figures. To determine whether there is a Cdc2/Cdk2-docking site in Cdc25A/224–524/T507A, 293T cells were transfected with either pcDNA3–3×FLAG Cdc25A/224–524/T507A or Cdc25A/224–524/R446L/R450L/Y455A/T507A, suspended in buffer A (2Chen M.S. Ryan C.E. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7488-7497Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) with the supplements, and lysed by passage through a 27-gauge needle 30 times. Each cell lysate was precleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h followed by incubation with 10 μl of protein A-agarose beads at 4 °C for 2 h. Each precleared cell lysate was incubated with 10 μl of M2 antibody-agarose beads at 4 °C for 2 h. The resulting immunoprecipitates were washed with buffer A six times or buffer A three times plus buffer A with 30 mm NaCl three times (for immunoprecipitation using Cdc2 antibody) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies as indicated in figures. DH5α cells were transformed with various pGEX2T′ constructs encoding GST-tagged Cdc25A or its mutants. GST-tagged Cdc25A and mutants were purified following the method described previously (2Chen M.S. Ryan C.E. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7488-7497Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Proteins immobilized in glutathione beads (GE Healthcare) were eluted with 40 mm glutathione reduced form in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. Purified proteins were concentrated with a YM-30 Centricon (Armicorn) and stored at −80 °C. The phosphatase activity of 5 or 10 μg of GST-tagged Cdc25A or its mutants was assayed using 3-O-methylfluorescein phosphate (Sigma) as substrates. The detailed steps of this process have been described previously (2Chen M.S. Ryan C.E. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7488-7497Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The absorbance values at 477 nm were normalized with the number of moles of GST-tagged Cdc25A or its mutants. The absorbance value at 477 nm of 59 pmol of GST-Cdc25A was set at 1. 293T cells were transfected with empty vector (pcDNA3–3×FLAG) or vector expressing 3×FLAG-tagged Cdc25A/224–524/T507A, and lysed with MCLB with the supplements 24 h after transfection. Cell lysates were precleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h and then incubated with protein A-agarose beads at 4 °C for 2 h. Each cell lysate containing 150 μg of protein was immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of cyclin A or Cdk2 antibody immobilized on 10 μl of protein A-agarose beads or 5 μl of anti-cyclin B1-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Alternatively, 300 μg of protein was immunoprecipitated overnight with 10 μl of anti-Cdc2-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C. Each bead pellet was washed with MCLB buffer four times and then subjected to kinase assay using a Cdk1/Cdc2 kinase assay kit (Upstate). The kinase reaction incubation time was 10 min for cyclin A, cyclin B1, or Cdk2 immunoprecipitates, and 30 min for Cdc2 immunoprecipitates. To understand how Cdc25A promotes apoptosis, Jurkat cells were treated with staurosporine or anti-Fas antibody, functioning as a ligand for Fas, to induce apoptosis. At 2 h after staurosporine treatment, a 37-kDa Cdc25A C-terminal fragment was generated (Fig. 1A). This Cdc25A C-terminal fragment also appeared during 500 or 750 ng/ml anti-Fas antibody treatment (Fig. 1B). Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, a known caspase substrate, was proteolyzed concomitantly with the generation of the Cdc25A C-terminal fragment (Fig. 1, A and B). These results suggest that caspase mediates the generation of the Cdc25A C-terminal fragment. Cdc25A is an activator for Cdc2 and Cdk2. Cdc2 and Cdk2 were activated in a caspase-dependent manner during staurosporine-induced apoptosis, as reported by Zhou et al. (21Zhou B.B. Li H. Yuan J. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 6785-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Tyr-15 in Cdc2 and Cdk2 was gradually dephosphorylated 1 h after staurosporine treatment, as shown in immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1C) and phospho-specific flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 1D). The extent of Cdc2 and Cdk2 dephosphorylation was consistent with an increase in caspase 3 activity and apoptotic cells during staurosporine treatment (Fig. 1, C–E). These results agree with the report of Zhou et al. (21Zhou B.B. Li H. Yuan J. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 6785-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and show that staurosporine treatment induces apoptosis in Jurkat cells, activates caspases and Cdc2/Cdk2, and promotes the generation of a 37-kDa Cdc25A C-terminal fragment. To determine whether the Cdc25A C-terminal fragment is generated by caspase cleavage and plays a role in staurosporine-induced apoptosis, Jurkat cells were pretreated with vehicle or caspase inhibitor I in the presence or absence of staurosporine. Caspase inhibitor I pretreatment blocked the generation of the Cdc25A C-terminal fragment (Fig. 2A) and inhibited staurosporine-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the knockdown of endogenous Cdc25A using siRNA against Cdc25A suppressed staurosporine-induced apoptosis, as indicated by immunoblotting (Fig. 2C, left panel) and a decrease in annexin V-positive cells after staurosporine treatment (Fig. 2C, right panel). These results suggest that Cdc25A is a pro-apoptotic protein and is involved in staurosporine-induced apoptosis through the Cdc25A C-terminal fragment generated by caspase cleavage. C-terminal His-tagged Cdc25A was similarly cleaved as endogenous Cdc25A to generate the Cdc25A C-terminal fragment during staurosporine treatment (Fig. 3A). The Cdc25A C-terminal fragments accumulated abundantly at 1 h after staurosporine treatment (Fig. 3A, lane 3) and decreased thereafter (lane 4). The accumulation and decline of the ectopic Cdc25A C-terminal fragment levels were faster than that of endogenous Cdc25A (Fig. 1A). This phenomenon may be due to a slight activation of caspase by the ectopic expression of Cdc25A and/or electroporation. To identify the caspase cleavage site to generate the Cdc25A C- terminal fragment, site-directed mutagenesis was performed. Mutation at Asp-223 to alanine blocked the generation of the Cdc25A C-terminal fragment after staurosporine treatment (Fig. 3B, lane 5) as compared with the C-terminal His-tagged Cdc25A (lane 3). Moreover, the C-terminal His-tagged Cdc25A/224–524 migrated in the gel at the same position as that of the Cdc25A C-terminal fragment generated after staurosporine treatment (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 7). The migration of the C-terminal His-tagged Cdc25A/224–524 without staurosporine treatment was slightly slower than that with treatment (Fig. 3B, lanes 6 and 7), which was due to the protein kinase inhibition effect of staurosporine (22Jackson J.R. Gilmartin A. Imburgia C. Winkler J.D. Marshall L.A. Roshak A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 566-572PubMed Google Scholar). The levels of the C-terminal His-tagged Cdc25A/224–524 with and without staurosporine treatment were very similar (Fig. 3B, lanes 6 and 7), whereas the level of the N-terminal His-tagged Cdc25A/1–223 after staurosporine treatment decreased dramatically (lanes 8 and 9). Furthermore, the Cdc25A C-terminal fragment generated during Fas-dependent apoptosis was the same as that generated during staurosporine-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3C). These results show that Asp-223 is the cleavage site to generate the Cdc25A C-terminal domain, and there are other possible caspase cleavage site(s) in Cdc25A/1–223. To further identify the caspase cleavage site(s) in Cdc25A/1–223, serial constructs were made. These constructs encoded fusion proteins with a presumed caspase consensus motif consisting of eight amino acids from Cdc25A between the N-terminal His6 tag and C-terminal CD20 (Fig. 3D, top). The mobility of these fusion proteins in gel with or without staurosporine treatment was examined using CD20 antibody. In addition to using the Asp-223 caspase cleavage motif as a positive control, 16 possible caspase cleavage sites in the first 223 amino acids of Cdc25A were tested (Fig. 3D). Results show that Asp-223 is the most frequent cleavage site, followed by aspartates 128, 130, and 215, while aspartates 81, 87, 136, 190, and 216 are less cleaved. Furthermore, compared with wild type Cdc25A, the substitution of aspartates 81, 87, 128, 130, 136, 190, 215, 216, and 223 with alanines inhibited the Cdc25A cleavage induced by staurosporine treatment (Fig. 3E). Thus, in addition to aspartate 223, there are eight caspase cleavage sites in Cdc25A/1–223. The Cdc25A C-terminal fragment generated by caspase cleavage at Asp-223 contains a phosphatase catalytic domain from residues 336 to 497. To compare the phosphatase activity of wild type Cdc25A with its mutants, bacterially produced GST-tagged Cdc25A, Cdc25A/C431S (phosphatase dead mutant), Cdc25A/1–223,and Cdc25A/224–524 were purified by pulldown using glutathione beads. These proteins were purified to 95% homogeneous, as indicated by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 4A). Phosphatase activity was assayed using 3-O-methylfluorescence phosphate, an artificial substrate. The phosphatase activity of GST-Cdc25A/224–524 was 3-fold higher than that of GST-Cdc25A, whereas that of GST-tagged Cdc25A/C431S and Cdc25A/1–223 was nondetectable (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that the conformation of the active site in Cdc25A/224–524 was quite unlike that in the full-length Cdc25A, resulting in an increase of Cdc25A/224–524 phosphatase activity. In an unperturbed cell division cycle, Thr-507 is phosphorylated by Chk1 at the G1/S boundary until the G2 phase. The phosphorylation of Thr-507 recruits 14-3-3 binding, which shields the cyclin B1-docking site. In the G2 phase, Thr-507 is dephosphorylated, and Cdc25A can then access and activate cyclin B1/Cdc2, promoting the G2/M transition (2Chen M.S. Ryan C.E. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 7488-7497Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Because staurosporine inhibits Chk1 activity (22Jackson J.R. Gilmartin A. Imburgia C. Winkler J.D. Marshall L.A. Roshak A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 566-572PubMed Google Scholar), the phosphorylation status of Thr-507 was examined using phospho-Cdc25A-Thr-507 antibody. Thr-507 was indeed dephosphorylated at 2 h after staurosporine treatment (Fig. 4C), and in turn 14-3-3 binding could not be recruited. The phosphatase activity of Cdc25A/224–524 was higher than that of full-length Cdc25A, and staurosporine treatment induced dephosphorylation of Thr-507. To determine the function of Cdc25A/224–524 with the dephosphorylated Thr-507 generated during staurosporine treatment, Jurkat cells were electroporated with the expression plasmid with two promoters to drive any of the His-tagged Cdc25A/1–223, Cdc25A/224–524, and Cdc25A/224–524/T507A and copepod green fluorescence protein (copGFP) expression. At 10 h after electroporation, the protein levels of these Cdc25A truncated mutants and copGFP were determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 5A, top panel), and some cells were treated with staurosporine for another 12 h. The percentage of apoptotic cells in the cells expressing copGFP before (black columns) or after (gray columns) staurosporine treatment was represented by the sub-G1 cell population (Fig. 5A, bottom panel). Compared with the expression of copGFP alone, the ectopic expression of either His-tagged Cdc25A/224–524 or Cdc25A/224–524/T507A amplified staurosporine-induced apoptosis but not His-tagged Cdc25A/1–223. The ectopic expression of either His-tagged Cdc25A/224–524 or Cdc25A/224–524/T507A for 24 h also promoted the dephosphorylation of Tyr-15 in Cdc2/Cdk2 (Fig. 5B) and apoptosis, as indicated by the activation of caspase-3 (Fig. 5C, top panel) or an increase in terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick end labeling-pos"
https://openalex.org/W2150906811,"Truncating mutations in the tumor suppressor gene APC (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli) are thought to initiate the majority of colorectal cancers. The 15- and 20-amino acid repeat regions of APC bind beta-catenin and have been widely studied for their role in the negative regulation of canonical Wnt signaling. However, functions of APC in other important cellular processes, such as cell cycle control or aneuploidy, are only beginning to be studied. Our previous investigation implicated the 15-amino acid repeat region of APC (M2-APC) in the regulation of the G2/M cell cycle transition through interaction with topoisomerase IIalpha (topo IIalpha).We now demonstrate that the 20-amino acid repeat region of APC (M3-APC) also interacts with topo IIalpha in colonic epithelial cells. Expression of M3-APC in cells with full-length endogenous APC causes cell accumulation in G2. However, cells with a mutated topo IIalpha isoform and lacking topo IIbeta did not arrest, suggesting that the cellular consequence of M2- or M3-APC expression depends on functional topoisomerase II. Both purified recombinant M2- and M3-APC significantly enhanced the activity of topo IIalpha. Of note, although M3-APC can bind beta-catenin, the G2 arrest did not correlate with beta-catenin expression or activity, similar to what was seen with M2-APC. More importantly, expression of either M2- or M3-APC also led to increased aneuploidy in cells with full-length endogenous APC but not in cells with truncated endogenous APC that includes the M2-APC region.Together, our data establish that the 20-amino acid repeat region of APC interacts with topo IIalpha to enhance its activity in vitro, and leads to G2 cell cycle accumulation and aneuploidy when expressed in cells containing full-length APC. These findings provide an additional explanation for the aneuploidy associated with many colon cancers that possess truncated APC."

To characterize critical signals associated with CD28 that regulate HIV-1 transcription, we generated a library of chimeric CD28 receptors that harbored different combinations of key tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail, Tyr-173, Tyr-188, Tyr-191, and Tyr-200. We found that Tyr-191 and Tyr-200 induce HIV-1 transcription via the activation of NF-κB and its recruitment to the HIV-long terminal repeat. Tyr-188 modifies positive and negative signals associated with CD28. Importantly, signaling through Tyr-188, Tyr-191, and Tyr-200 is required to overcome the inhibition posed by Tyr-173. CD28 also regulates P-TEFb activity, which is necessary for HIV-1 transcription processivity, by limiting the release of P-TEFb from the HEXIM1–7SK inhibitory complex in response to T-cell receptor signaling. Our studies reveal that CD28 regulates HIV-1 provirus transcription through a complex interplay of positive and negative signals that may be manipulated to control HIV-1 transcription and replication.

Furthermore, the LTR forms an RNA stem loop structure, TAR, which the HIV transactivator, Tat, binds. Tat enhances RNA polymerase II (pol II) processivity by recruiting P-TEFb to the HIV-LTR (17Zhang J. Tamilarasu N. Hwang S. Garber M.E. Huq I. Jones K.A. Rana T.M. J. Biol.

Therefore, it may be possible to manipulate specific signaling cascades to control HIV transcription and improve the efficacy of current anti-viral regimens. Efficient T-cell activation requires signals from the TCR as well costimulatory molecules, including CD28, which enhances TCR activation, promotes cell survival and increases cytokine production (21Ward S.G.

CD28 possesses no enzymatic activity and mediates signaling by recruiting other proteins to tyrosines and proline-rich motifs within its cytoplasmic domain. CD28 has four signaling tyrosine residues (Y) in the cytoplasmic tail of CD28 at positions Tyr-173, Tyr-188, Tyr-191, and Tyr-200, which are required for appropriate T-cell activation, induction of cytokine gene expression, cytoskeleton reorganization, and immunological synapse formation (25Teng J.M.

We have previously shown that signaling associated with CD28 positively and negatively regulates HIV-1 provirus transcription. Specifically, we demonstrated that Tyr-200 positively regulated HIV transcription by initiating Vav-1 and NF-κB signaling, whereas recruitment of PI3K to the Tyr-173 residue inhibited the ability of Tat to bind P-TEFb and HIV-1 transcription (30Cook J.A.

How these apparently opposing signals are coordinated to lead to induction of HIV-1 transcription, as well as the role of the other tyrosines in modulating HIV-1 transcription in response to CD28, has not been extensively investigated. Using chimeric CD28 receptors harboring mutations in different key tyrosines in the cytoplasmic domain, we show that CD28 induces HIV transcription through distinct but cooperative activities associated with the individual tyrosines. Jurkat E6.1 T cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.2 ml-glutamine. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were also obtained from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from whole blood by Ficoll/histopaque gradient (Sigma-Aldrich), and CD4+ T cells were positively selected using the Dynal isolation kit (Invitrogen, 113.21D).

To generate receptors, FYYF and YFFY, the plasmids corresponding to pMHneo FFFY and pMHneo YFFF were digested with ApaI and HindIII (New England Biolabs). Two fragments were generated, a 400-bp fragment containing CD8α and the nucleotide sequence coding for tyrosine 173 of the cytoplasmic tail of CD28, and a 6.8-kb fragment containing the rest of CD28 and the pMHneo backbone. The 400-bp fragment from pMHneo FFFY and 6.8-kb fragment from pMHneo YFFF were gel-purified and ligated to generate pMHneo FYYF using T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen). The pMHneo YFFY was generated similarly by ligating the 400-bp fragment isolated from pMHneo YYYF and the 6.8-kb fragment from pMHneo FFFY vectors. Additional mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Primers were designed (Table 1) to mutate key tyrosines to phenylalanines. Primers are listed in Table 1. For PCR reactions template plasmid DNA and appropriate primers were amplified using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) following standard protocols. The PCR products were digested with DpnI to eliminate donor plasmid and transformed into competent Escherichia coli DH5α cells.

Cells were given 1 pulse for 65 ms at 215 V in a 4-mm cuvette and then recovered in complete RPMI. 48 h post-transfections cells were put on selection by including 1 mg/ml G418 in the growth media. After 3 weeks cells expressing the chimeric receptors were positively selected for CD8 using the Dynal isolation kit (Invitrogen) to generate a polyclonal pool of cells. Several independent pools for each receptor were generated to assure that there was no bias from an individual transfection and selection protocol. We also generated clonal cell lines and these behaved identically to the CD8/CD28 pooled cell lines (Refs. 30Cook J.A. Albacker L. August A. Henderson A.J. J. Biol.

For flow cytometry 2 × 106 cells were washed and resuspended in 100 μl of staining media (phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% serum). Cells were incubated with 2 μl of anti-CD8α-phycoerythrin (BD 555635) and anti-CD28-FITC (BD 555728) for 45 min on ice. Cells were washed three times with staining media and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. Fluorescence was measured using a BD Biosciences FACScan at the Flow Core Facility at Boston Medical Center. 0.5 × 106 293T cells were plated in a 6-well plate 24 h prior to calcium phosphate transfections, which were performed using 15 μg of pNL4-3-Luc(+) Env(−) Nef(−) (35Henderson A.J. Zou X. Calame K.L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5337-5344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or pHXB-PLAP-Env Nef(+) (36Chen B.K. Gandhi R.T. Baltimore D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6044-6053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program) and 3 μg of RSV-Rev, 3 μg of LTR VSV-G. 293T transfection efficiency for pNL4-3-Luc was assessed by determining luciferase activity using a luciferase kit (Promega Madison, WI), whereas p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed for the pHXB-PLAP virus. Supernatants were collected and filtered through a 0.45-μm disc prior to infection. Jurkat cells were infected with this virus for 12–16 h. Cells were then recovered and cultured in complete RPMI. Jurkat T cells were washed and resuspended in 5% fetal calf serum RPMI. 1 × 106 cells were plated in each well of a 24-well plate. Cells were either left unactivated, or activated with 0.1 μg/ml anti-human CD3 alone (BD 555336), anti-CD3, and 1.0 μg/ml anti-human CD28 (BD 555725) or 1.0 μg/ml anti-human CD8α antibodies (BD 555630) for 30 min. 5 μg/ml of goat anti-mouse antibody (Sigma M 4280) was added to cross-link the receptors. Following 8 h of stimulation, Jurkat cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was measured. In experiments using cyclosporin A (CsA), infected Jurkat T cells were recovered and activated in the presence of 500 ng/ml CsA or vehicle control. Jurkat T cells were serum-starved for 12–16 h, activated with antibodies as described above for 5 min prior to preparing protein extracts with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 2.0 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture III (Calbiochem). Lysates were precleared by incubating with protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2003) for 30 min at 4 °C before incubating with primary anti-Vav (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-132). Protein A/G beads were added to the antibody-lysate mix for 1 h at 4 °C, and beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and then suspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The samples were heated for 5 min at 100 °C before being loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) by electroblotting. Western blot analysis was carried out using a phosphotyrosine antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories, 610024). The blot was stripped and reprobed with a Vav antibody. CyclinT1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-8127) and HEXIM1 (Abcam, ab28016) immunoprecipitations were also carried out with the same protocol; however, nuclear extracts (described in the next section) instead of total protein extracts were used. In the immunoprecipitation experiments done with the PI3K inhibitor, 50 μm LY294002 (Promega) was introduced 30 min before activation to the culture. Western blots were quantified by densitometry. The ratio of CyclinT1 over HEXIM was calculated for all samples in Fig. 3A, and the ratio of HEXIM over CyclinT1 was calculated for Fig. 3 (B–D). The numbers depicted in the figures represent ratio of immunoprecipitation in each lane versus immunoprecipitation from the unactivated lane. Jurkat cells were activated for 8 h, and nuclear extracts were isolated by resuspending 1 × 106 cells in low salt buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min. 10% Nonidet P-40 was added to rupture the cell membranes, and the nuclei were pelleted and incubated in a high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) to isolate the nuclear extract. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out by incubating 5 μg of protein from nuclear extracts with 4 μg of poly(dIdC) (Amersham Biosciences), 0.25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.6 m KCl, 9.0% glycerol, 1.0 mm EDTA, 7.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm MgCl2. Reaction mixtures were preincubated with 100-fold excess of specific or nonspecific competitors, or 0.5 μg of polyclonal antibodies against NF-κB subunits p50 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-7178) and p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-109). Samples were loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 120 V in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA. Probes for electrophoretic mobility shift assay were generated by annealing oligonucleotides representing the HIV-1 NF-κB sites (5′-AGCTCCTGGAAAGTCCCCAGCGGAAAGTCCCTT-3′ and 5′-AGCTAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGG-3′). Sp1 probe was used as nonspecific competitor (sense sequence 5′-GATCATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′ and antisense sequence 5′-GATCGCTCGCCCCGCCCCGATCGAAT-3′). Probes were generated by end filling with the Klenow fragment of E. coli polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP.

Virol. 1999; 73: 5422-5430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) were electroporated into 20 × 106 Jurkat E6.1 cells using the T280 BTX electroporator. The cells were recovered in 5% fetal calf serum RPMI for 16 h. 1 × 106 cells were either left untreated or activated with 0.1 μg/ml anti-human CD3 or 0.1 μg/ml anti-human CD28 and 1.0 μg/ml anti-human CD28, and luciferase assays were performed 6 h post activation as described above. 1 × 108 cells were infected with pHXB-PLAP virus for 5 days. Cells were then activated with 0.1 μg/ml anti-CD3 and 1.0 μg/ml anti-CD8 or anti-CD28 antibodies for 30 min. 5.0 μg/ml of goat anti-mouse was then added, and cells were activated for 6 h. Cells were cross-linked using 11% formaldehyde solution (prepared from 37% formaldehyde, 10% methanol) in 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) to the final concentration of 1% for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction is quenched by adding 2 m glycine to a final concentration of 240 mm. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 1 ml of sonication buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sonicated on ice for 30 cycles, 10 s on, 30 s off. 100 μl of sonicated chromatin was diluted 10-fold with dilution buffer and incubated with 1 μg of antibody pol II (sc-899) p65 (sc-109) for 16 h at 4 °C. Protein A/G beads were then added for 2 h. The beads were then washed twice each with low salt (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl), high salt (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 0.1, 500 mm NaCl), and LiCl wash buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and 10 mm Tris and 1 mm EDTA. Complexes were eluted with 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3. The complexes were reverse cross-linked at 65 °C for 4 h, followed by addition of proteinase K for 1 h at 45 °C. The DNA was extracted using phenol chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was carried out using SYBR green reagents and the primers 5′-TGCATCCGGAGTACTTCAAGA-3′ and 5′-GAGGCTTAAGCAGTGGGTTC-3′, which amplify the −150 to +76 region of HIV-LTR, and 5′-GACTAGAGCCCTGGAAGCA-3′ and 5′-GCTTCTTCCTGCCATAGGAG-3′, which amplify the +5396 to +5531 region of HIV. Statistical analysis was carried out using Student t test. A two-tailed distribution was performed on paired samples, comparing CD3 responses to CD3 plus CD8 responses. Values of <0.01 were considered significant. To study the role of CD28 in regulating HIV transcription, we employed a strategy that was previously described (25Teng J.M. King P.D. Sadra A. Liu X.

Immunol. 2002; 169: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), in which we generated CD8/28 chimeric receptors with mutations in key tyrosine residues. The chimeric receptors were designed such that the cytoplasmic domain of CD28 was fused to the transmembrane and extracellular domain of CD8α, which we refer to henceforth as CD8/CD28. This chimeric receptor forms a dimer similar to CD28 and functions identical to endogenous CD28 (25Teng J.M. King P.D. Sadra A. Liu X. Han A. Selvakumar A. August A. Dupont B. Tissue Antigens. 1996; 48: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition, the generation and expression of these CD8/CD28 chimeras allow their expression in cells along with endogenous CD28, and the direct comparison of mutant and WT CD28 signals in the same cells (25Teng J.M. King P.D. Sadra A. Liu X. Han A. Selvakumar A. August A. Dupont B. Tissue Antigens. 1996; 48: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 30Cook J.A. Albacker L. August A. Henderson A.J. J.

Immunol. 2002; 169: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, we changed individual or different combinations of tyrosines in the cytoplasmic tail of CD28 to phenylalanine (F). Polyclonal populations of the Jurkat E6.1 T cell line expressing these chimeric receptors were generated, and stable expression of CD8/CD28, as well as endogenous CD28 receptors, was evaluated by flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 1B). This panel of Jurkat T cells expressing CD8/CD28 chimeras was infected with NL4-3 luciferase virus to evaluate the function of different tyrosines in HIV-1 transcription. Using the HIV-luciferase clone, which lacks envelope and supports only a single round of infection, allowed us to focus on CD28 signaling and HIV-1 transcription, rather than potential effects CD28 signaling has on virus replication and spread. Infected Jurkat T cells were stimulated through the TCR using anti-CD3 antibodies and either the chimeric CD8/CD28 receptor (using anti-CD8α antibodies) or the endogenous CD28 receptor (using anti-CD28 antibodies), which served as a control to ensure that the different T cell lines were capable of being activated. Controls included stimulating cells through the CD28, CD8/CD28, and CD3 receptors alone. Consistent with our previous studies the chimeric receptor CD8/CD28 WT, which retains all functional tyrosines, leads to transcriptional activation similar to that mediated by the endogenous CD28 receptor (25Teng J.M.

Receptors lacking the cytoplasmic domain, del167, and the All F mutant, where all four tyrosines in the cytoplasmic tail of CD28 were mutated to phenylalanines, did not induce HIV-1 transcription confirming an indispensable role for these tyrosines in the cytoplasmic tail of CD28 (Fig. 2) (25Teng J.M.

Immunol. 2002; 169: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the Tyr-173 residue negatively regulates HIV-1 transcription, whereas signaling through Tyr-200 was necessary for HIV-1 transcription (30Cook J.A. Albacker L. August A. Henderson A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35812-35818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 33Cook J.A. August A. Henderson A.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We were interested in determining the functional interplay between these two apparently opposite activities mediated through Tyr-200 and Tyr-173, as well as the integration of signals downstream of other tyrosines within the CD28 cytoplasmic domain. We initially examined the ability of CD28 receptors with one functional tyrosine, Tyr-173 (YFFF), Tyr-188 (FYFF), Tyr-191 (FFYF), or Tyr-200 (FFFY), to support HIV-1 transcription. As expected, the YFFF receptor was unable to activate HIV transcription, consistent with our previous report that implicated Tyr-173 signaling as inhibitory (33Cook J.A. August A. Henderson A.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the FYFF receptor did not support HIV-1 transcription indicating that signals downstream of Tyr-188 were not sufficient to induce HIV-1 transcription. However, the FFYF and FFFY receptors activated HIV-1 transcription to levels comparable to the wild-type CD8/CD28 or the endogenous CD28 receptors, indicating that Tyr-191 and Tyr-200 positively regulate HIV transcription in the absence of other tyrosine residues in the signaling domain of CD28.

https://openalex.org/W2072033255,"Background Shortly after eye opening, initially disorganized visual cortex circuitry is rapidly refined to form smooth retinotopic maps. This process asymptotes long before adulthood, but it is unknown whether further refinement is possible. Prior work from our lab has shown that the retinotopic map of the non-dominant ipsilateral eye develops faster when the dominant contralateral eye is removed. We examined whether input from the contralateral eye might also limit the ultimate refinement of the ipsilateral eye retinotopic map in adults. In addition, we examined whether the increased refinement involved the recruitment of adjacent cortical area. Methodology/Principal Findings By surgically implanting a chronic optical window over visual cortex in mice, we repeatedly measured the degree of retinotopic map refinement using quantitative intrinsic signal optical imaging over four weeks. We removed the contralateral eye and observed that the retinotopic map for the ipsilateral eye was further refined and the maximum magnitude of response increased. However, these changes were not accompanied by an increase in the area of responsive cortex. Conclusions/Significance Since the retinotopic map was functionally refined to a greater degree without taking over adjacent cortical area, we conclude that input from the contralateral eye limits the normal refinement of visual cortical circuitry in mice. These findings suggest that the refinement capacity of cortical circuitry is normally saturated."

Nowadays, massive parallel sequencing technology allows the development of studies unaffordable a few years ago. However, analysis protocols are not yet sufficiently developed to extract all information from the huge amount of data obtained.In this study, we performed high throughput sequencing in two regions located on chromosomes 3 and 6, recently identified by linkage studies by our group as candidate regions for harbouring breast cancer susceptibility genes. In order to enrich for the coding regions of all described genes located in both candidate regions, a hybrid-selection method on tiling microarrays was performed.We developed an analysis pipeline based on SOAP aligner to identify candidate variants with a high real positive confirmation rate (0.89), with which we identified eight variants considered candidates for functional studies. The results suggest that the present strategy might be a valid second step for identifying high penetrance genes."
https://openalex.org/W1984217528,"In general, immune effector molecules are induced by infection.However, strong constitutive expression of the cell-autonomous resistance GTPase, Irga6 (IIGP1), was found in mouse liver, contrasting with previous evidence that expression of this protein is exclusively dependent on induction by IFNgamma. Constitutive and IFNgamma-inducible expression of Irga6 in the liver were shown to be dependent on transcription initiated from two independent untranslated 5' exons, which splice alternatively into the long exon encoding the full-length protein sequence. Irga6 is expressed constitutively in freshly isolated hepatocytes and is competent in these cells to accumulate on the parasitophorous vacuole membrane of infecting Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites.The role of constitutive hepatocyte expression of Irga6 in resistance to parasites invading from the gut via the hepatic portal system is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2031758503,"Basic games, where each individual chooses between two strategies, illustrate several issues that immediately emerge from the standard approach that applies strategic reasoning, based on rational decisions, to predict population behavior where no rationality is assumed. These include how mutual cooperation (which corresponds to the best outcome from the population perspective) can evolve when the only individually rational choice is to defect, illustrated by the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game, and how individuals can randomize between two strategies when neither is individually rational, illustrated by the Battle of the Sexes (BS) game that models male-female conflict over parental investment in offspring. We examine these questions from an evolutionary perspective where the evolutionary dynamics includes an impulsive effect that models sudden changes in collective population behavior. For the PD game, we show analytically that cooperation can either coexist with defection or completely take over the population, depending on the strength of the impulse. By extending these results for the PD game, we also show that males and females each evolve to a single strategy in the BS game when the impulsive effect is strong and that weak impulses stabilize the randomized strategies of this game."
