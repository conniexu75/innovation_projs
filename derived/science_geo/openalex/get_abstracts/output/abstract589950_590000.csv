Yang et al. show that introducing additional triiodide ions during the formation of layers of formamidinium lead iodide, which also contain small amounts of methylammonium lead bromide, suppresses the formation of deep-level defects. This process boosts the certified efficiency of 1-cm 2 solar cells to almost 20%. Science , this issue p. 1376"
https://openalex.org/W2724299548,"Estimates of climate change damage are central to the design of climate policies. Here, we develop a flexible architecture for computing damages that integrates climate science, econometric analyses, and process models. We use this approach to construct spatially explicit, probabilistic, and empirically derived estimates of economic damage in the United States from climate change. The combined value of market and nonmarket damage across analyzed sectors-agriculture, crime, coastal storms, energy, human mortality, and labor-increases quadratically in global mean temperature, costing roughly 1.2% of gross domestic product per +1°C on average. Importantly, risk is distributed unequally across locations, generating a large transfer of value northward and westward that increases economic inequality. By the late 21st century, the poorest third of counties are projected to experience damages between 2 and 20% of county income (90% chance) under business-as-usual emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5)."

Andela et al. use satellite data to show that, unexpectedly, global burned area declined by ∼25% over the past 18 years, despite the influence of climate. The decrease has been largest in savannas and grasslands because of agricultural expansion and intensification. The decline of burned area has consequences for predictions of future changes to the atmosphere, vegetation, and the terrestrial carbon sink. Science , this issue p. 1356"

This ecological pattern is thought to maintain higher species diversity in the tropics. LaManna et al. tested this hypothesis by comparing how tree species diversity changes with the intensity of local biotic interactions in tropical and temperate latitudes (see the Perspective by Comita). Stronger local specialized biotic interactions seem to prevent erosion of biodiversity in tropical forests, not only by limiting populations of common species, but also by strongly stabilizing populations of rare species, which tend to show higher CNDD in the tropics.

https://openalex.org/W2725924882,"Like many developing tissues, the vertebrate neural tube is patterned by antiparallel morphogen gradients. To understand how these inputs are interpreted, we measured morphogen signaling and target gene expression in mouse embryos and chick ex vivo assays. From these data, we derived and validated a characteristic decoding map that relates morphogen input to the positional identity of neural progenitors. Analysis of the observed responses indicates that the underlying interpretation strategy minimizes patterning errors in response to the joint input of noisy opposing gradients. We reverse-engineered a transcriptional network that provides a mechanistic basis for the observed cell fate decisions and accounts for the precision and dynamics of pattern formation. Together, our data link opposing gradient dynamics in a growing tissue to precise pattern formation."

https://openalex.org/W2728683192,"Background & Aims Currently most liver fibrosis research is performed in vivo, since suitable alternative in vitro systems which are able to recapitulate the cellular events leading to liver fibrosis are lacking. Here we aimed at generating a system containing cells representing the three key players of liver fibrosis (hepatocyte, Kupffer cells and stellate cells) and assess their response to pro-fibrotic compounds such as TGF-β1, methotrexate (MTX) and thioacetamide (TAA). Methods Human cell lines representing hepatocytes (HepaRG), Kupffer cell (THP-1 macrophages) and stellate cells (hTERT-HSC) were co-cultured using the InSphero hanging drop technology to generate scaffold-free 3D microtissues, that were treated with pro-fibrotic compounds (TGF-β1, MTX, TAA) for up to 14 days. The response of the microtissues was evaluated by determining the expression of cytokines (TNF-α, TGF-β1 and IL6), the deposition and secretion of ECM proteins and induction of gene expression of fibrosis biomarkers (e.g. αSMA). Induction of Nrf2 and Keap1, as key player of defence mechanism, was also evaluated. Results We could demonstrate that the multicellular 3D microtissue cultures could be maintained in a non-activated status, based on the low expression levels of activation markers. Macrophages were activated by stimulation with LPS and hTERT-HSC showed activation by TGF-β1. In addition, MTX and TAA elicited a fibrotic phenotype, as assessed by gene-expression and protein-deposition of ECM proteins such as collagens and fibronectin. An involvement of the antioxidant pathway upon stimulation with pro-fibrotic compounds was also observed. Conclusion Here, for the first time, we demonstrate the in vitro recapitulation of key molecular and cellular events leading to liver fibrosis: hepatocellular injury, antioxidant defence response, activation of Kupffer cells and activation of HSC leading to deposition of ECM."
https://openalex.org/W2724387076,"Canagliflozin, an inhibitor of sodium glucose co-transporter (SGLT) 2, has been shown to reduce body weight during the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this study, we sought to determine the role of canagliflozin in body weight loss and liver injury in obesity. C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet to simulate diet-induced obesity (DIO). Canagliflozin (15 and 60 mg/kg) was administered to DIO mice for 4 weeks. Orlistat (10 mg/kg) was used as a positive control. The body weight, liver weight, liver morphology, total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels were examined. Signaling molecules, including diacylgycero1 acyltransferase-2 (DGAT2), peroxisome proliferation receptor alpha-1 (PPARα1), PPARγ1, PPARγ2 mRNA levels and the protein expression of SGLT2 were evaluated. Canagliflozin reduced body weight, especially the high-dose canagliflozin, and resulted in increased body weight loss compared with orlistat. Moreover, canagliflozin reduced the liver weight and the ratio of liver weight to body weight, lowered the serum levels of TC and TG, and ameliorated liver steatosis. During the canagliflozin treatment, SGLT2, DGAT2, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 were inhibited, and PPARα1 was elevated in the liver tissues. This finding may explain why body weight was reduced and secondary liver injury was ameliorated in response to canagliflozin. Together, the results suggest that canagliflozin may be a potential anti-obesity strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2724822719,"Bacterial adhesion to collagen, the most abundant protein in humans, is a critical step in the initiation and persistence of numerous bacterial infections. In this study, we explore the collagen binding mechanism of the multi-modular cell wall anchored collagen adhesin (CNA) in Staphylococcus aureus and examine how applied mechanical forces can modulate adhesion ability. The common structural-functional elements and domain organization of CNA are present across over 50 genera of bacteria. Through the use of molecular dynamics models and normal mode analysis, we shed light on the CNA’s structural and conformational dynamics and its interactions with collagen that lead to collagen binding. Our results suggest that the linker region, CNA165-173, acts as a hinge exhibiting bending, extensional, and torsional modes of structural flexibility and its residues are key in the interaction of the CNA-collagen complex. Steered molecular dynamics simulations were conducted with umbrella sampling. During the course of these simulations, the ‘locking’ latch from the CNA N2 domain was dissociated from its groove in the CNA N1 domain, implying the importance of the latch for effective ligand binding. Finally, we observed that the binding efficiency of the CNA N1-N2 domains to collagen decreases greatly with increasing tensile force application to the collagen peptides. Thus, CNA and similar adhesins might preferentially bind to sites in which collagen fibers are cleaved, such as in wounded, injured, or inflamed tissues, or in which the collagenous tissue is less mature. As alternative techniques for control of bacterial infection are in-demand due to the rise of bacterial antibiotic resistance, results from our computational studies with respect to the mechanoregulation of the collagen binding site may inspire new therapeutics and engineering solutions by mechanically preventing colonization and/or further pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2731554127,"Pedestrians regularly engage with their mobile phone whilst walking. The current study investigated how mobile phone use affects where people look (visual search behaviour) and how they negotiate a floor based hazard placed along the walking path. Whilst wearing a mobile eye tracker and motion analysis sensors, participants walked up to and negotiated a surface height change whilst writing a text, reading a text, talking on the phone, or without a phone. Differences in gait and visual search behaviour were found when using a mobile phone compared to when not using a phone. Using a phone resulted in looking less frequently and for less time at the surface height change, which led to adaptations in gait by negotiating it in a manner consistent with adopting an increasingly cautious stepping strategy. When using a mobile phone, writing a text whilst walking resulted in the greatest adaptions in gait and visual search behaviour compared to reading a text and talking on a mobile phone. Findings indicate that mobile phone users were able to adapt their visual search behaviour and gait to incorporate mobile phone use in a safe manner when negotiating floor based obstacles."

However, whether vitamin D repletion modulates inflammatory responses in lymphocytes from dialysis patients is unclear. In the clinical trial, thirty-two (32) dialysis patients with 25 vitamin D ≤ 20ng/mL were randomized to receive either supplementation of cholecalciferol 100,000 UI/week/3 months (16 patients) or placebo (16 patients). In the in vitro study, B and T lymphocytes from 12 healthy volunteers (HV) were incubated with or without uremic serum in the presence or absence of 25 or 1,25 vitamin D. We evaluated the intracellular expression of IL-6, IFN-γ TLR7, TLR9, VDR, CYP27b1 and CYP24a1 by flow cytometry. We observed a reduction in the expression of TLR7, TLR9, INF-γ and CYP24a1 and an increase in VDR and CYP27b1 expression in patients which were supplemented with cholecalciferol, whereas no differences were found in the placebo group. Uremic serum increased the intracellular expression of IL-6, IFN-γ, TLR7, TLR9, VDR, CYP27b1 and CYP24a1. Treatment with 25 or 1,25 vitamin D decreased IL-6 and TLR9. CYP24a1 silencing plus treatment with 25 and/or 1,25 vitamin D had an additional reduction effect on IL-6, IFN-γ, TLR7 and TLR9 expression. This is the first study showing that cholecalciferol repletion has an anti-inflammatory effect and improves vitamin D intracellular regulatory enzymes on lymphocytes from dialysis patients."

https://openalex.org/W2728883653,"The international and national HIV treatment guidelines in 2016 have focused on scaling up access to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). We aimed to assess the trends and treatment outcomes of late cART initiation in Taiwan.Between June 2012 and May 2016, we retrospectively included antiretroviral-naive HIV-positive adults who initiated cART. Late initiation was defined as when cART was initiated in patients with a CD4 count <200 cells/mm3 or having experienced AIDS-defining illnesses. The treatment outcomes were assessed up to 6 months after starting cART.We included 3655 HIV-positive patients, and the majority of the patients were male (95.4%) with a median age of 31 years and initiated non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor-containing regimens (87.0%). The median CD4 count at cART initiation increased from 207 cells/mm3 in 2012 to 298 cells/mm3 in 2016, and the overall proportion of late cART initiation decreased from 49.1% in 2012 to 29.0% in 2016 (P for trend <0.001). Late cART initiation mainly resulted from late presentation for HIV care and was associated with older age (per 1-year increase, adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.05; 95% CI, 1.04-1.06), HBsAg seropositivity (AOR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.04-1.64), HIV care in central and southern Taiwan, initiating cART in earlier year, non-intravenous drug users (AOR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.33-2.86), and negative hepatitis C serostatus (AOR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.04-2.08). Compared with non-late initiators, late initiators had a higher rate of all-cause mortality (1.7% vs. 0.3%) and regimen modification due to virological failure (7.1% vs. 2.6%). The predicting factors of all-cause mortality were late cART initiation (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 5.40; 95% CI, 2.14-13.65) and older age (AHR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03-1.10).While the proportion of late cART initiation decreased over time in Taiwan, late initiation remained in a substantial proportion of HIV-positive patients. The late initiators had higher risk for poor outcomes. The need for strategies to earlier detection of HIV infection and expediting cART initiation should be highlighted, especially among the older population."
https://openalex.org/W2728188585,"Natural cytokine-specific autoantibodies (c-aAb) have been measured in healthy and diseased individuals, and have been considered as both endogenous immune-regulators and pathogenic factors. Overall, the etiology and potential pathology of c-aAb are still undefined. To further characterize the sero-prevalence, predictors and consequences of high c-aAb levels, we performed the largest population-based study of c-aAb to date, using participants and epidemiological data from the Danish Blood Donor Study. Using a validated bead-based multiplex assay we assessed plasma levels of IL-1α, IL-6, IL-10, IFNα and GM-CSF-specific c-aAb in 8,972 healthy blood donors. Trace levels of at least one of the investigated c-aAb could be measured in 86% of the participants. The presence of high levels of potentially inhibitory c-aAb was generally associated with increasing age and male or female sex, depending on the c-aAb in question. A negative correlation between high levels of IL-6-specific c-aAb and plasma levels of C-reactive protein was observed, indicating cytokine-neutralizing levels of c-aAb in healthy blood donors. There was no substantial correlation between high levels of the five individual c-aAb investigated in this study. These data suggest that autoimmunity against endogenous cytokines is a relatively common phenomenon in healthy individuals, and that predictive factors for high, potentially neutralizing c-aAb levels vary depending on the cytokine in question, and may differ from predictors of general c-aAb presence."

Recent computational studies have adopted a distinctly different view, where plausible mechanisms are proposed to describe a wide range of social phenomena, including the onset and evolution of organizational culture. In this spirit, this work introduces an empirically-grounded, agent-based model which relaxes a set of assumptions that describes past work–(a) omittance of an individual’s strive for achieving cognitive coherence; (b) limited integration of important contextual factors—by utilizing networks of beliefs and incorporating social rank into the dynamics. As a result, we illustrate that: (i) an organization may appear to be increasingly coherent in terms of its organizational culture, yet be composed of individuals with reduced levels of coherence; (ii) the components of social conformity—peer-pressure and social rank—are influential at different aggregation levels."

DAH7PS from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtuDAH7PS) is a homotetramer, with the allosteric sites in close proximity to the interfaces. Here we examine the importance of the quaternary structure on catalysis and regulation, by amino acid substitution targeting the tetramer interface of MtuDAH7PS. Using only single amino acid substitutions either in, or remote from the interface, two dimeric variants of MtuDAH7PS (MtuDAH7PSF227D and MtuDAH7PSG232P) were successfully generated. Both dimeric variants maintained activity due to the distance between the sites of amino acid substitution and the active sites, but attenuated catalytic efficiency was observed. Both dimeric variants showed significantly disrupted allosteric regulation with greatly impaired binding affinity for one of the allosteric ligands. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed changes in protein dynamics and average conformations in the dimeric variant caused by amino acid substitution remote to the tetramer interface (MtuDAH7PSG232P), which are consistent with the observed reduction in catalytic efficiency and loss of allosteric response."
https://openalex.org/W2728697954,"SLC19A3 deficiency, also called thiamine metabolism dysfunction syndrome-2 (THMD2; OMIM 607483), is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in SLC19A3, the gene encoding thiamine transporter 2. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration in SLC19A3 deficiency and whether administration of high-dose thiamine prevents neurodegeneration, we generated homozygous Slc19a3 E314Q knock-in (KI) mice harboring the mutation corresponding to the human SLC19A3 E320Q, which is associated with the severe form of THMD2. Homozygous KI mice and previously reported homozygous Slc19a3 knock-out (KO) mice fed a thiamine-restricted diet (thiamine: 0.60 mg/100 g food) died within 30 and 12 days, respectively, with dramatically decreased thiamine concentration in the blood and brain, acute neurodegeneration, and astrogliosis in the submedial nucleus of the thalamus and ventral anterior-lateral complex of the thalamus. These findings may bear some features of thiamine-deficient mice generated by pyrithiamine injection and a thiamine-deficient diet, suggesting that the primary cause of THMD2 could be thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) deficiency. Next, we analyzed the therapeutic effects of high-dose thiamine treatment. When the diet was reverted to a conventional diet (thiamine: 1.71 mg/100 g food) after thiamine restriction, all homozygous KO mice died. In contrast, when the diet was changed to a high-thiamine diet (thiamine: 8.50 mg/100 g food) after thiamine restriction, more than half of homozygous KO mice survived, without progression of brain lesions. Unexpectedly, when the high-thiamine diet of recovered mice was reverted to a conventional diet, some homozygous KO mice died. These results showed that acute neurodegeneration caused by thiamine deficiency is preventable in most parts, and prompt high-dose thiamine administration is critical for the treatment of THMD2. However, reduction of thiamine should be performed carefully to prevent recurrence after recovery of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2730204581,"Approximately one-third of our food globally comes from insect-pollinated crops. The dependence on pollinators has been linked to yield instability, which could potentially become worse in a changing climate. Insect-pollinated crops produced via hybrid breeding (20% of fruit and vegetable production globally) are especially at risk as they are even more reliant on pollinators than open-pollinated plants. We already observe a wide range of fruit and seed yields between different cultivars of the same crop species, and it is unknown how existing variation will be affected in a changing climate. In this study, we examined how three hybrid carrot varieties with differential performance in the field responded to three temperature regimes (cooler than the historical average, average, and warmer that the historical average). We tested how temperature affected the plants' ability to set seed (seed set, pollen viability) as well as attract pollinators (nectar composition, floral volatiles). We found that there were significant intrinsic differences in nectar phenolics, pollen viability, and seed set between the carrot varieties, and that higher temperatures did not exaggerate those differences. However, elevated temperature did negatively affect several characteristics relating to the attraction and reward of pollinators (lower volatile production and higher nectar sugar concentration) across all varieties, which may decrease the attractiveness of this already pollinator-limited crop. Given existing predictions of lower pollinator populations in a warmer climate, reduced attractiveness would add yet another challenge to future food production."
https://openalex.org/W2733408710,"Background Creatine kinase (CK) is a pivotal regulatory enzyme in energy metabolism linked to both blood pressure and cardio-metabolic components. However, data is lacking in a large population of asymptomatic Asians. Methods and results Cardio-metabolic assessment including anthropometric measures and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) were evaluated by abdominal echo in 4,562 consecutive subjects who underwent an annual health survey. Serum CK levels were related to blood pressure components [systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and pulse pressure (PP)], anthropometric measures, and excessive adiposity in liver as indicated by NAFLD. Circulating CK levels ranged from 4 to 1842 IU/L (mean [SE]: 108.7 [1.1] IU/L) in the study population which consisted of 2522 males (mean age: 48.7 ± 11.2) and 2040 females (mean age: 49.4±11.5). In general, male subjects presented with higher circulating CK levels than females (mean ± SE: 127.3 ± 1.5 vs. 85.5 ± 1.3 IU/L, respectively, p < .001). Gender-differences in circulating CK levels were also observed with increasing age, which showed a more pronounced positive relationship with age in female subjects (gender interaction: p < .05). Furthermore, an elevated circulating CK level was independently associated with higher blood pressure, waist circumference and fat mass (FM), greater body mass index (BMI), increased lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and presence of NAFLD in multivariate analysis (all p < .05), with CK elevation more pronounced with greater BMI and FM in males compared with females (sex interaction: p < .05). Conclusion In a large asymptomatic Asian population, circulating CK levels were increased with more advanced age, higher blood pressure, and greater body mass with gender differences. Our findings may be useful in interpreting elevated CK from subjects free of ongoing myocardial damage."
https://openalex.org/W2728153976,"Cosmc is an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone necessary for normal protein O-GalNAc glycosylation through regulation of T-synthase, its single client. Loss-of-function of Cosmc results in expression of the Tn antigen, which is associated with multiple human diseases including cancer. Despite intense interest in dysregulated expression of the Tn antigen, little is known about the structure and function of Cosmc, including domain organization, secondary structure, oligomerization, and co-factors. Limited proteolysis experiments show that Cosmc contains a structured N-terminal domain (CosmcΔ256), and biochemical characterization of CosmcΔ256 reveals wild type chaperone activity. Interestingly, CosmcE152K, which shows loss of function in vivo, exhibits wild type-like activity in vitro. Cosmc and CosmcE152K heterogeneously oligomerize and form monomeric, dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric species, while CosmcΔ256 is predominantly monomeric as characterized by chemical crosslinking and blue native page electrophoresis. Additionally, Cosmc selectively binds divalent cations in thermal shift assays and metal binding is abrogated by the CosmcΔ256 truncation, and perturbed by the E152K mutation. Therefore, the N-terminal domain of Cosmc mediates T-synthase binding and chaperone function, whereas the C-terminal domain is necessary for oligomerization and metal binding. Our results provide new structure-function insight to Cosmc, indicate that Cosmc behaves as a modular protein and suggests points of modulation or regulation of in vivo chaperone function."
https://openalex.org/W2725144244,"Background Chronic renal transplant dysfunction is characterized by loss of renal function and tissue remodeling, including chronic inflammation and lymph vessel formation. Proteoglycans are known for their chemokine presenting capacity. We hypothesize that interruption of the lymphatic chemokine–proteoglycan interaction interferes with the lymphatic outflow of leukocytes from the renal graft and might decrease the anti-graft allo-immune response. Methods In a rat renal chronic transplant dysfunction model (female Dark-Agouti to male Wistar Furth), chemokines were profiled by qRT-PCR in microdissected tubulo-interstitial tissue. Disruption of lymphatic chemokine–proteoglycan interaction was studied by (non-anticoagulant) heparin-derived polysaccharides in vitro and in renal allografts. The renal allograft function was assessed by rise in plasma creatinine and urea. Results Within newly-formed lymph vessels of transplanted kidneys, numerous CD45+ leukocytes were found, mainly MHCII+, ED-1-, IDO-, HIS14-, CD103- antigen presenting cells, most likely representing a subset of dendritic cells. Treatment of transplanted rats with regular heparin and two different (non-)anticoagulant heparin derivatives revealed worsening of kidney function only in the glycol-split heparin treated group despite a two-fold reduction of tubulo-interstitial leukocytes (p<0.02). Quantitative digital image analysis however revealed increased numbers of intra-lymphatic antigen-presenting cells only in the glycol-split heparin group (p<0.01). The number of intra-lymphatic leukocytes significantly correlates with plasma creatinine and urea, and inversely with creatinine clearance. Conclusions Treatment of transplanted rats with glycol-split heparin significantly increases the number of intra-lymphatic antigen presenting cells, by increased renal diffusion of lymphatic chemokines, thereby increasing the activation and recruitment of antigen presenting cells towards the lymph vessel. This effect is unwanted in the transplantation setting, but might be advantageous in e.g., dendritic cell vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2727110642,"Alveolar macrophages orchestrate pulmonary innate immunity and are essential for early immune surveillance and clearance of microorganisms in the airways. Inflammatory signaling must be sufficiently robust to promote host defense but limited enough to prevent excessive tissue injury. Macrophages in the lungs utilize multiple transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms of inflammatory gene expression to delicately balance the elaboration of immune mediators. RNA terminal uridyltransferases (TUTs), including the closely homologous family members Zcchc6 (TUT7) and Zcchc11 (TUT4), have been implicated in the post-transcriptional regulation of inflammation from studies conducted in vitro. In vivo, we observed that Zcchc6 is expressed in mouse and human primary macrophages. Zcchc6-deficient mice are viable and born in Mendelian ratios and do not exhibit an observable spontaneous phenotype under basal conditions. Following an intratracheal challenge with S. pneumoniae, Zcchc6 deficiency led to a modest but significant increase in the expression of select cytokines including IL-6, CXCL1, and CXCL5. These findings were recapitulated in vitro whereby Zcchc6-deficient macrophages exhibited similar increases in cytokine expression due to bacterial stimulation. Although loss of Zcchc6 also led to increased neutrophil emigration to the airways during pneumonia, these responses were not sufficient to impact host defense against infection."

To perform the study Longissimus thoracis (LT), Semitendinosus (SM), Masseter (MS), Sternomandibularis (ST) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) samples of Pirenaica young bulls (n = 4) were collected for IMF, collagen and protein quantification, analysis of adipocyte size distribution and gene expression (PPARG, CEBPA, FAPB4 and WNT10B). A greater IMF content was observed in MS and SM muscles, which had a bimodal adipocyte size distribution while it was unimodal in the muscles LT and ST. This suggest that the different IMF accretion in the muscles studied might be related to different rates of hyperplasia and hypertrophy and that IMF might develop later in LT and ST muscles. The former differences were not mirrored by the expression of the genes analyzed, which might be related to the different contribution of mature and non-mature adipocytes to the total gene expression. When comparing IMF and SAT gene expression, late and early developing tissues respectively, expression of PPARG, CEBPA and FABP4 was higher in the SAT, in agreement with bigger cell size and numbers. The variability study indicates that the analytical factors that add higher variability to the gene expression are the sampling and RT and therefore, it would be appropriate to include those replicates in the design of future experiments. Based on the results, the use of MS and SM muscles could allow less expensive experimental designs and bigger sample size that could permit the detection of lower relevant differences in gene expression."

One candidate instrument is the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), a measure of child psychological adjustment that is increasingly being employed by Child Protection services. The aim of the current study was to examine the structural validity of the foster parent completed SDQ in a sample of 237 school aged foster children. Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated an excellent fit of the foster parent completed SDQ data to a five-factor model (CFI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.05, 90% CI [0.04, 0.06]), thus confirming the structural validity of the five-factor model for the parent-version of the SDQ in Norwegian foster children. Measurement invariance analyses indicated that boys had lower thresholds for fighting with or bullying other children than girls. Girls were on their side more likely to be rated as less popular than boys with a similar level of peer problems."
https://openalex.org/W2726800033,"Understanding tumor heterogeneity is an urgent and unmet need in cancer research. In this study, we used a morphology-based optical cell separation process to classify a heterogeneous cancer cell population into characteristic subpopulations. To classify the cell subpopulations, we assessed their morphology in hydrogel, a three-dimensional culture environment that induces morphological changes according to the characteristics of the cells (i.e., growth, migration, and invasion). We encapsulated the murine breast cancer cell line 4T1E, as a heterogeneous population that includes highly metastatic cells, in click-crosslinkable and photodegradable gelatin hydrogels, which we developed previously. We observed morphological changes within 3 days of encapsulating the cells in the hydrogel. We separated the 4T1E cell population into colony- and granular-type cells by optical separation, in which local UV-induced degradation of the photodegradable hydrogel around the target cells enabled us to collect those cells. The obtained colony- and granular-type cells were evaluated in vitro by using a spheroid assay and in vivo by means of a tumor growth and metastasis assay. The spheroid assay showed that the colony-type cells formed compact spheroids in 2 days, whereas the granular-type cells did not form spheroids. The tumor growth assay in mice revealed that the granular-type cells exhibited lower tumor growth and a different metastasis behavior compared with the colony-type cells. These results suggest that morphology-based optical cell separation is a useful technique to classify a heterogeneous cancer cell population according to its cellular characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2731836232,"In boreal forests, fire is an important part of the ecosystem that greatly influences soil respiration, which in turn affects the carbon balance. Wildfire can have a significant effect on soil respiration and it depends on the fire severity and environmental factors (soil temperature and snow water equivalent) after fire disturbance. In this study, we quantified post-fire soil respiration during the non-growing season (from November to April) in a Larix gmelinii forest in Daxing'an Mountains of China. Soil respiration was measured in the snow-covered and snow-free conditions with varying degrees of natural burn severity forests. We found that soil respiration decreases as burn severity increases. The estimated annual C efflux also decreased with increased burn severity. Soil respiration during the non-growing season approximately accounted for 4%–5% of the annual C efflux in all site types. Soil temperature (at 5 cm depth) was the predominant determinant of non-growing season soil respiration change in this area. Soil temperature and snow water equivalent could explain 73%–79% of the soil respiration variability in winter snow-covering period (November to March). Mean spring freeze–thaw cycle (FTC) period (April) soil respiration contributed 63% of the non-growing season C efflux. Our finding is key for understanding and predicting the potential change in the response of boreal forest ecosystems to fire disturbance under future climate change."

However, the related literature is rather specific and no complete comparison between theory and typical small scale experiments is currently available. This work provides, in a self-consistent framework, a detailed presentation of the relevant theoretical equations for small MHD ships and experimental measurements for future benchmarks. Theoretical results of the literature are adapted to these simple battery/magnets powered ships moving on salt water. Comparison between theory and experiments are performed to validate each theoretical step such as the Tafel and the Kohlrausch laws, or the predicted ship speed. A successful agreement is obtained without any adjustable parameter. Finally, based on these results, an optimal design is then deduced from the theory. Therefore this work provides a solid theoretical and experimental ground for small scale MHD ships, by presenting in detail several approximations and how they affect the boat efficiency. Moreover, the theory is general enough to be adapted to other contexts, such as large scale ships or industrial flow measurement techniques."

This study aimed to evaluate the association between the intraplaque localization of CCs and plaque vulnerability.We investigated 55 acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and 80 stable angina pectoris (stable AP) lesions using optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) prior to percutaneous coronary intervention. The distance between CCs and the luminal surface of coronary plaques was defined as CC depth.Although the incidence of CCs had similar frequencies in the ACS and stable AP groups (95% vs. 89%, p = 0.25), CC depth was significantly less in patients with ACS than in those with stable AP (median [25th to 75th percentile]: 68 μm [58 to 92 μm] vs. 152 μm [115 to 218 μm]; p < 0.001). The incidences of plaque rupture, thrombus, lipid-rich plaques, and thin-cap fibroatheroma were significantly greater in patients with ACS than in those with stable AP (62% vs. 18%, p < 0.001; 67% vs. 16%, p < 0.001; 84% vs. 57%, p < 0.01; and 56% vs. 19%, p < 0.001, respectively).OFDI analysis revealed that CCs were found in the more superficial layers within the coronary atherosclerotic plaques in patients with ACS than in those with stable AP, suggesting that CC depth is associated with plaque vulnerability. CC depth, a novel OFDI-derived parameter, could be potentially used as an alternative means of evaluating plaque vulnerability in coronary arteries."

The overall satisfaction level of the study participants was 39.3%. Poor cleanliness of the facility, fewer service access provision, lack of prescribed drugs within the facility and longer waiting time to get the health care service wasreported by 73.2%, 67.8%, 65.6% and 59.2% of the clients respectively. Paying service users (AOR: 2.03, 95% CI: 1.22-3.39, P: 0.007), divorced clients (AOR: 4.26, 95% CI: 1.11-16.26, P: 0.034) and hospital users (AOR: 2.18, 95% CI: 1.29-3.69, P: 0.004) were more dissatisfied.Client satisfaction was lowin the health provision in West Amhara region. Expansion of health facilities in remote areas, maintaining continuous availability of prescribed drugs, improving cleanliness of health facilities, and fast health service provision are recommended to satisfy clients in the setting."

Aim of this cohort study was to analyse two different treatment strategies for DSWI: titanium sternal plating system (TSFS) and muscle flap coverage (MFC).Between January 2007 and December 2011, from 3122 patients undergoing cardiac surgery 42 were identified with DSWI and treated with one of the above mentioned strategies. In-hospital data were collected, follow-up performed by telephone and assessment of Quality of Life (QoL) using the SF-12 Health Survey Questionnaire.20 patients with deep sternal wound infection were stabilized with TSFS and 22 patients treated with MFC. Preoperative demographics and risk factors did not reveal any significant differences. Patients treated with TSFS had a significantly shorter operation time (p<0.05) and shorter hospitalization (p<0.05). A tendency towards lower mortality rate (p = n.s.) and less re-interventions were also noted (plating 0.6 vs. flap 1.17 per patient, n.s.). Quality of Life in the TSFS group for the physical-summary-score was significantly elevated compared to the MFC group (p<0.05). Relating to chest stability and cosmetic result the treatment with TSFS showed superior results, but the usage of MFC gave the patients more freedom in breathing and less chest pain.Our results demonstrate that the use of TSFS is a feasible and safe alternative in DSWI. However, MFC remains an absolutely essential option for complicated DSWI since the amount of perfused tissue can be the key for infection control."

Admitting non-cases to an ETC prompts concerns on case- and workload in the ETC, risk for nosocomial EVD infection, and delays in diagnosis and disease-specific treatment. We retrospectively analysed characteristics, outcomes and determinants of death of EVD cases and non-cases admitted to the Conakry ETC in Guinea between 03/2014 and 09/2015. Of the 2362 admitted suspects who underwent full confirmatory PCR testing, 1540 (65.2%) were non-cases; among them 727 needed repeated confirmatory PCR testing resulting in 2.5 days (average) in the ETC isolation ward. Twenty-one patients tested positive on the repeat test, most in a period of flawed sampling for the initial test and none after introduction of PCR confirmation with geneXpert. No readmissions following nosocomial EVD infection were recorded. No combination of symptoms yielded acceptable sensitivity and specificity to allow differentiating confirmed from non-cases. Symptoms as ocular bleeding/redness have high specificity, but limited usefulness as not common. Admission delay and age distribution were not different for both groups. In total, 98 (20.6%) of 475 deaths in the ETC were non-cases. Most died within 24 hours after admission. Living in Conakry (aOR 1.78 (1.08-2.96)) was the strongest risk factor for death. Weeks with higher admission load had lower case fatality among non-cases, probably because more acute (and treatable) illnesses of contacts of known cases were admitted. These findings show high numbers of potentially critically ill non-cases need to be considered when setting up triage and referral of EVD suspect cases. Symptoms and risk factors alone do not allow differentiating the non-cases. Integration of highly-sensitive EVD diagnostic methods with short turnaround time in the triage of peripheral hospitals and dropping the systematic 2nd PCR for symptomatic early presenters could limit delays in access to adapted care of cases and seriously ill non-cases. Whether feasible without compromising outbreak control, and under which conditions, should be further assessed."

The objective of such trials is to accelerate the development process for a drug and shorten the drug's approval time in key markets. Several statistical methods have been purposed for the design and evaluation of MRCTs, as well as for assessing the consistency of treatment effects across all regions with one primary endpoint. However, in some therapeutic areas (e.g., Alzheimer's disease), the clinical efficacy of a new treatment may be characterized by a set of possibly correlated endpoints, known as multiple co-primary endpoints. In this paper, we focus on a specific region and establish three statistical criteria for evaluating consistency between the specific region and overall results in MRCTs with multiple co-primary endpoints. More specifically, two of those criteria are used to assess whether the treatment effect in the region of interest is as large as that of the other regions or of the regions overall, while the other criterion is used to assess the consistency of the treatment effect of the specific region achieving a pre-specified threshold. The sample size required for the region of interest can also be evaluated based on these three criteria."

In this study, considering the effect of periodic teaching activities on the learning process, we propose a periodic impulsive knowledge dissemination system to regenerate the knowledge dissemination process. Meanwhile, we put forward learning effectiveness which is an outcome of a trade-off between the benefits and costs raised by knowledge dissemination as objective function. Further, we investigate the optimal teaching strategy which can maximize learning effectiveness, to obtain the optimal effect of knowledge dissemination affected by the teaching activities. We solve this dynamic optimization problem by optimal control theory and get the optimization system. At last we numerically solve this system in several practical examples to make the conclusions intuitive and specific. The optimal teaching strategy proposed in this paper can be applied widely in the optimization problem of personal education and beneficial for enhancing the effect of knowledge dissemination."

The switch between seed dormancy and germination in Arabidopsis thaliana is regulated by the balance between the hormones abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellin (GA). Low temperatures are known to cause an increase in GA synthesis and receptor abundance, thereby increasing the probability of germination. Topham et al. studied the integration of temperature signals and determined that the embryo radicle is enriched for factors involved in hormone signaling, synthesis, and degradation. A clear spatial pattern emerged whereby ABA and GA pathway components were broadly separated into different cell types. This spatial separation and control over transport of hormones between cells facilitates processing of fluctuating temperature inputs and increases their propensity to break seed dormancy, compared with signals from continuous cold exposure. This is hypothesized to ensure accurate timing of seedling establishment through recognition of environmental temperature oscillations.

Copper could be a cost-effective catalyst for solar-powered reduction of CO2 to fuels and chemicals, but it tends to produce a variety of different products. Building on recent observations, Schreier et al. now show that coating copper oxide nanowires with tin oxide by atomic layer deposition confers high selectivity for CO production in CO2 electrolysis. Moreover, these nanowires proved effective in catalyzing the anodic oxidation of water to oxygen as well. The authors took advantage of a bipolar membrane to carry out the cathodic and anodic reactions at neutral and basic pH, respectively, reaching a solar-to-CO2 conversion efficiency of 13.4% with a three-junction solar cell to power the process.

MADS-box genes have essential functions in plant development and morphology. However, in plants, as a result of multiple rounds of whole-genome duplications combined with specific gene gains and losses, the relationships and evolution of this gene family have been difficult to trace. Zhao et al. applied a network-based phylogenetic analysis examining synteny—the location of genes and their relative position within the genome—across all identified MADS-box genes from 51 plant species. Through this analysis, the relationships, approximate timing, gains and losses, and specific movements of these genes within the genome could be traced. This allows for a better understanding of how evolution has acted on a key regulatory gene family in the plant kingdom.

As active learning continues to replace traditional lectures, a new dimension of learning needs to be measured: social activity. Specifically, how are students interacting with and learning from their peers? Wiggins et al. developed and validated a 16-item survey to measure multiple facets of student experience in active-learning classrooms. The Assessing Student Perspective of Engagement in Class Tool (ASPECT) was designed to be widely applicable for different types of active learning and allows for the comparison of relative student engagement levels across various active-learning strategies. As researchers begin to investigate what makes active learning effective, tools such as ASPECT will provide insight into potential barriers presented by active learning, as well as strategies that increase engagement of all students.

The central United States is a region particularly vulnerable to stratospheric ozone loss in summer, in part because of the severe storms that occur over the Great Plains. Anderson et al. present measurements of the convective penetration of water into the stratosphere over the United States in summer caused by these storms, along with relevant accompanying physical and chemical effects, to better understand the mechanisms of stratospheric ozone loss and to facilitate decadal forecasting in our changing environment. Their findings imply that there exists an increased risk of ozone loss over the Great Plains in summer as the climate warms.

A mathematical analysis of changes in gene expression in mouse liver, designed to detect oscillations of various frequencies, showed more than 3500 genes whose expression cycled with a 12-hour period. This is distinct from circadian gene expression, which is coupled to the 24-hour light cycle, and has been noted before in marine animals, perhaps because of a need to synch with 12-hour tidal changes. Zhu et al. found that gene products associated with 12-hour cycles are particularly related to metabolic function, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and the unfolded protein response. The 12-hour clock appears to be distinct from the well-known circadian oscillator and was evident in nematodes and crustaceans, as well as mammals.
