https://openalex.org/W2891349406,"Spatially resolved single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) is a powerful approach for inferring connections between a cell's identity and its position in a tissue. We recently combined scRNAseq with spatially mapped landmark genes to infer the expression zonation of hepatocytes. However, determining zonation of small cells with low mRNA content, or without highly expressed landmark genes, remains challenging. Here we used paired-cell sequencing, in which mRNA from pairs of attached mouse cells were sequenced and gene expression from one cell type was used to infer the pairs' tissue coordinates. We applied this method to pairs of hepatocytes and liver endothelial cells (LECs). Using the spatial information from hepatocytes, we reconstructed LEC zonation and extracted a landmark gene panel that we used to spatially map LEC scRNAseq data. Our approach revealed the expression of both Wnt ligands and the Dkk3 Wnt antagonist in distinct pericentral LEC sub-populations. This approach can be used to reconstruct spatial expression maps of non-parenchymal cells in other tissues."

IDH1 and IDH2 mutations occur in various cancers, including gliomas and leukemias (Losman and Kaelin, 2013Losman J.A. Kaelin Jr., W.G. What a difference a hydroxyl makes: mutant IDH, (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate, and cancer.Genes Dev. 2013; 27: 836-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Tumor-associated IDH mutants convert 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) to the (R) enantiomer of 2-hydroxyglutarate, (R)-2HG, which accumulates to millimolar levels in tumors (Losman and Kaelin, 2013Losman J.A. Kaelin Jr., W.G. What a difference a hydroxyl makes: mutant IDH, (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate, and cancer.Genes Dev. 2013; 27: 836-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). (R)-2HG structurally resembles 2OG and competitively inhibits many 2OG-dependent dioxygenases, including JmjC histone demethylases and TET DNA hydroxylases (Losman and Kaelin, 2013Losman J.A. Kaelin Jr., W.G. What a difference a hydroxyl makes: mutant IDH, (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate, and cancer.Genes Dev. 2013; 27: 836-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The challenge has been to determine which dioxygenases play causal roles in transformation by (R)-2HG in a given tumor type and which are bystanders. In this regard, inhibition of TET2 promotes leukemic transformation and is also suspected of playing a role in IDH mutant gliomas (Flavahan et al., 2016Flavahan W.A. Drier Y. Liau B.B. Gillespie S.M. Venteicher A.S. Stemmer-Rachamimov A.O. Suvà M.L. Bernstein B.E.

Although studies of (R)-2HG targets have focused on 2OG-dependent dioxygenases, cells have other 2OG-dependent enzymes, including various transaminases that reversibly couple nitrogen transfer from their specific amino acid substrates to the interconversion of 2OG and glutamate. In this regard, Reitman et al., 2011Reitman Z.J. Jin G. Karoly E.D. Spasojevic I. Yang J. Kinzler K.W. He Y. Bigner D.D. Vogelstein B. Yan H. Profiling the effects of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 mutations on the cellular metabolome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 3270-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar reported that the conditioned media of IDH mutant cells had decreased levels of branched chain α-ketoacids (BCKAs) compared to control cells. BCKAs are made from the branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine, and valine by the BCAA transaminases BCAT1 and BCAT2 (Figure 1A). Based on these findings and the 2OG dependence of BCAT1 and BCAT2, we hypothesized that the BCKA depletion observed by Reitman et al., 2011Reitman Z.J. Jin G. Karoly E.D. Spasojevic I. Yang J. Kinzler K.W. He Y. Bigner D.D. Vogelstein B. Yan H. Profiling the effects of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 mutations on the cellular metabolome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 3270-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar was due to direct, competitive inhibition of BCAT activity by (R)-2HG and that this would create metabolic vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically. We infected IDH1/2 wild-type HOG human glioma cells (Reitman et al., 2011Reitman Z.J. Jin G. Karoly E.D. Spasojevic I. Yang J. Kinzler K.W. He Y. Bigner D.D. Vogelstein B. Yan H.

We then performed gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomic profiling of the resultant stable cell lines and of parental HOG cells that were treated with BCAT inhibitors (Compound 2 or gabapentin) (Hu et al., 2006Hu L.Y. Boxer P.A. Kesten S.R. Lei H.J. Wustrow D.J. Moreland D.W. Zhang L. Ahn K. Ryder T.R. Liu X. et al.The design and synthesis of human branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase inhibitors for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2006; 16: 2337-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or were infected to produce one of two BCAT1 small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) or a control shRNA (Figures 1C and 1D). IDH1 R132H increased the abundance of the BCAAs and depleted glutamate and the BCKAs α-keto-β-methylvalerate (KMV) and α-ketoisocaproate (KIC), as did pharmacologically or genetically inhibiting BCAT1 (Figure 1D). Similarly, glioma stem-like cell (GSC) lines derived from IDH1 mutant gliomas had elevated BCAAs and lower levels of KIC and glutamate compared to IDH1 wild-type GSC lines (Figures S1A–S1C). Therefore, both engineered and patient-derived IDH1 mutant cells exhibit metabolic changes consistent with impaired BCAT activity. We next developed and validated a recombinant BCAT1 activity assay (Figures S1D–S1G). (R)-2HG competitively inhibited BCAT1, which is a cytosolic enzyme, with respect to 2OG over a physiologically relevant range of 2OG concentrations (Figures 1E–1H) (Koivunen et al., 2012Koivunen P. Lee S. Duncan C.G. Lopez G. Lu G. Ramkissoon S. Losman J.A. Joensuu P. Bergmann U. Gross S. et al.Transformation by the (R)-enantiomer of 2-hydroxyglutarate linked to EGLN activation.Nature. 2012; 483: 484-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). (R)-2HG also inhibited the mitochondrial BCAT1 paralog, BCAT2 (Figure 1I), but minimally affected the GOT1 and GOT2 aspartate transaminases (Figures 1J and 1K). The alternative enantiomer, (S)-2HG, was a less effective BCAT inhibitor (Figure 1G), consistent with molecular docking studies that predict more extensive hydrogen bonding between (R)-2HG and BCAT2 (Figures 1L–1N, S1H, and S1I) relative to (S)-2HG. To ask if mutant IDH inhibits BCAT in cells, we assayed the conversion of 15N-leucine to 15N-glutamate in immortalized human astrocytes (NHA) and HOG cells infected to produce the IDH1 R132H mutant, wild-type IDH1, or with the EV (Figures 2A and 2C ). BCAT1 protein levels were lowered in late passage IDH1 mutant NHA cells (Figure S2C), consistent with a prior study (Tönjes et al., 2013Tönjes M. Barbus S. Park Y.J. Wang W. Schlotter M. Lindroth A.M. Pleier S.V. Bai A.H.C. Karra D. Piro R.M. et al.BCAT1 promotes cell proliferation through amino acid catabolism in gliomas carrying wild-type IDH1.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) and with reduced BCAT1 mRNA levels in IDH1 mutant gliomas (Figure S2D), but were not downregulated in late passage HOG cells (Figures S2A and S2B). We therefore studied early passage NHA and HOG cells to avoid potential confounding effects in late passage NHA cells caused by decreased BCAT1 protein levels. Both the IDH1 mutant NHA and HOG cells had tumor-relevant (R)-2HG concentrations (Figure 2B) (Dang et al., 2009Dang L. White D.W. Gross S. Bennett B.D. Bittinger M.A. Driggers E.M. Fantin V.R.

Leucine transamination was impaired in IDH1 mutant NHA and HOG cells (Figures 2D, 2E, and S2F), mirroring the effects of Compound 2 (Figure S2E).Figure S2(R)-2HG Inhibits BCAA Catabolism in Multiple Cellular Contexts, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A and B) Immunoblot analysis (n = 3) (A) and fraction of sites methylated (Beta) as determined by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (n = 2) (B) of early and late passage HOG stable cell lines.

A cell-permeable version of (R)-2HG, (R)-2HG-TFMB (Losman et al., 2013Losman J.A. Looper R.E. Koivunen P. Lee S. Schneider R.K. McMahon C. Cowley G.S. Root D.E. Ebert B.L. Kaelin Jr., W.G. (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate is sufficient to promote leukemogenesis and its effects are reversible.Science. 2013; 339: 1621-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar), but not (S)-2HG-TFMB, inhibited leucine transamination in parental HOG cells (Figure 2F). Conversely, leucine transamination in IDH1 mutant cells was rescued by AGI-5198, which blocks (R)-2HG production (Losman et al., 2013Losman J.A. Looper R.E. Koivunen P. Lee S. Schneider R.K. McMahon C. Cowley G.S. Root D.E. Ebert B.L. Kaelin Jr., W.G. (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate is sufficient to promote leukemogenesis and its effects are reversible.Science. 2013; 339: 1621-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) (Figure 2G). Metabolic evidence of suppressed BCAT activity was also observed in HCT116 colorectal cancer cells treated with (R)-2HG or engineered to have heterozygous IDH1 or IDH2 mutations (Figure S2G), while BCAT activity was restored in HT1080 IDH1 +/R132C fibrosarcoma cells treated with AGI-5198 (Figure S2H). Therefore, loss of BCAT activity in IDH mutant cells is caused by (R)-2HG. Mutant IDH2, like mutant IDH1, also potently repressed BCAT activity when introduced into NHA and HOG cells (Figures S2I–S2K). BCAA catabolism yields glutamate and BCKAs. We found that HOG cells avidly consume BCAAs from culture media (Figure S2L) and that the resultant BCKAs KMV and KIC are secreted by these cells rather than being further metabolized (Figures S2M and S2N). We therefore focused on glutamate, which is used to make many nitrogenous metabolites and acts as a neurotransmitter. Glutamate does not efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and brain interstitial glutamate concentrations are ∼100-fold lower than in serum (Espey et al., 1998Espey M.G. Kustova Y. Sei Y. Basile A.S. Extracellular glutamate levels are chronically elevated in the brains of LP-BM5-infected mice: a mechanism of retrovirus-induced encephalopathy.J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2079-2087Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, Smith, 2000Smith Q.R. Transport of glutamate and other amino acids at the blood-brain barrier.J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1016S-1022SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neural cells heavily rely on transaminases, particularly BCATs, to sustain intracellular glutamate levels (Cooper and Jeitner, 2016Cooper A.J. Jeitner T.M. Central role of glutamate metabolism in the maintenance of nitrogen homeostasis in normal and hyperammonemic brain.Biomolecules. 2016; 6 (pii: E16)Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Moreover, we found that imported glutamate makes a negligible contribution to intracellular glutamate levels in HOG cells grown ex vivo, reaffirming the importance of glutamate synthesis to maintain the relatively large intracellular glutamate pool (Figure S2O). To ask whether glutamate suppression by mutant IDH (Figures 1D and S1C) can be linked to loss of BCAT activity, we quantified steady-state 2HG, glutamate, and KIC levels in IDH1 mutant and wild-type HOG cell lines that were treated with AGI-5198 or DMSO (Figure 2H), while grown in cell culture media that contained glucose, glutamate, pyruvate, and amino acid levels based on physiological concentrations in the brain (Espey et al., 1998Espey M.G.

AGI-5198 lowered (R)-2HG and normalized intracellular glutamate and KIC levels in IDH1 mutant cells, with the latter change indicative of restored BCAT activity (Figure 2H). Overexpressing an (R)-2HG-insensitive transaminase, ornithine aminotransferase (OAT), and supplementing media with the OAT substrates 2OG (in a cell-permeable form) and L-ornithine partially reversed mutant IDH-induced glutamate depletion (Figures 2I–2K). IDH1 mutant GSC lines, like our engineered cell lines, also displayed reduced glutamate levels and BCAA catabolism relative to IDH1 wild-type lines despite comparable BCAT1 and BCAT2 protein levels (Figures 2L–2N). Lowering (R)-2HG in MGG152 and BT054 cell lines with AGI-5198 potently stimulated BCAT activity and restored glutamate levels without affecting BCAT1 or BCAT2 protein levels (Figures 2O, 2P, S2P, and S2Q). Cells can also make glutamate from glutamine using glutaminase (GLS). Interestingly, GLS is highly expressed in the brain compared to most normal tissues (Figures S3A and S3B) and low-grade gliomas upregulate a more active GLS splice isoform (Cassago et al., 2012Cassago A. Ferreira A.P. Ferreira I.M. Fornezari C. Gomes E.R. Greene K.S. Pereira H.M. Garratt R.C. Dias S.M. Ambrosio A.L.

Cell Biol. 2015; 17: 1556-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that decreased BCAT function in IDH mutant cells would increase their reliance on GLS activity for glutamate production. Indeed, the conversion of glutamine to glutamate was increased in IDH1 mutant NHA and HOG cells compared to their wild-type counterparts (Figures 3A–3C and 3E ). This was not due to increased protein levels of GLS or c-Myc, which regulates GLS expression (Figures 3D and S3E) (Gao et al., 2009Gao P. Tchernyshyov I. Chang T.C. Lee Y.S. Kita K. Ochi T.

https://openalex.org/W2890819762,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progresses to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in response to elevated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Whereas the onset of simple steatosis requires elevated de novo lipogenesis, progression to NASH is triggered by accumulation of hepatocyte-free cholesterol. We now show that caspase-2, whose expression is ER-stress inducible and elevated in human and mouse NASH, controls the buildup of hepatic-free cholesterol and triglycerides by activating sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP) in a manner refractory to feedback inhibition. Caspase-2 colocalizes with site 1 protease (S1P) and cleaves it to generate a soluble active fragment that initiates SCAP-independent SREBP1/2 activation in the ER. Caspase-2 ablation or pharmacological inhibition prevents diet-induced steatosis and NASH progression in ER-stress-prone mice. Caspase-2 inhibition offers a specific and effective strategy for preventing or treating stress-driven fatty liver diseases, whereas caspase-2-generated S1P proteolytic fragments, which enter the secretory pathway, are potential NASH biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W2891007226,"The mechanisms underlying sterol transport in mammalian cells are poorly understood. In particular, how cholesterol internalized from HDL is made available to the cell for storage or modification is unknown. Here, we describe three ER-resident proteins (Aster-A, -B, -C) that bind cholesterol and facilitate its removal from the plasma membrane. The crystal structure of the central domain of Aster-A broadly resembles the sterol-binding fold of mammalian StARD proteins, but sequence differences in the Aster pocket result in a distinct mode of ligand binding. The Aster N-terminal GRAM domain binds phosphatidylserine and mediates Aster recruitment to plasma membrane-ER contact sites in response to cholesterol accumulation in the plasma membrane. Mice lacking Aster-B are deficient in adrenal cholesterol ester storage and steroidogenesis because of an inability to transport cholesterol from SR-BI to the ER. These findings identify a nonvesicular pathway for plasma membrane to ER sterol trafficking in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2892042921,"Mutations or aberrant upregulation of EZH2 occur frequently in human cancers, yet clinical benefits of EZH2 inhibitor (EZH2i) remain unsatisfactory and limited to certain hematological malignancies. We profile global posttranslational histone modification changes across a large panel of cancer cell lines with various sensitivities to EZH2i. We report here oncogenic transcriptional reprogramming mediated by MLL1's interaction with the p300/CBP complex, which directs H3K27me loss to reciprocal H3K27ac gain and restricts EZH2i response. Concurrent inhibition of H3K27me and H3K27ac results in transcriptional repression and MAPK pathway dependency in cancer subsets. In preclinical models encompassing a broad spectrum of EZH2-aberrant solid tumors, a combination of EZH2 and BRD4 inhibitors, or a triple-combination including MAPK inhibition display robust efficacy with very tolerable toxicity. Our results suggest an attractive precision treatment strategy for EZH2-aberrant tumors on the basis of tumor-intrinsic MLL1 expression and concurrent inhibition of epigenetic crosstalk and feedback MAPK activation."
https://openalex.org/W2890430536,"Astrocyte dysfunction and inflammation are associated with the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain largely unknown. Here, we found that multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (Men1; protein: menin) expression is attenuated in the brain of mice exposed to CUMS (chronic unpredictable mild stress) or lipopolysaccharide. Astrocyte-specific reduction of Men1 (GcKO) led to depressive-like behaviors in mice. We observed enhanced NF-κB activation and IL-1β production with menin deficiency in astrocytes, where depressive-like behaviors in GcKO mice were restored by NF-κB inhibitor or IL-1β receptor antagonist. Importantly, we identified a SNP, rs375804228, in human MEN1, where G503D substitution is associated with a higher risk of MDD onset. G503D substitution abolished menin-p65 interactions, thereby enhancing NF-κB activation and IL-1β production. Our results reveal a distinct astroglial role for menin in regulating neuroinflammation in depression, indicating that menin may be an attractive therapeutic target in MDD."
https://openalex.org/W2891950607,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane contact sites (MCSs) mark positions where endosomes undergo fission for cargo sorting. To define the role of ER at this unique MCS, we targeted a promiscuous biotin ligase to cargo-sorting domains on endosome buds. This strategy identified the ER membrane protein TMCC1, a member of a conserved protein family. TMCC1 concentrates at the ER-endosome MCSs that are spatially and temporally linked to endosome fission. When TMCC1 is depleted, endosome morphology is normal, buds still form, but ER-associated bud fission and subsequent cargo sorting to the Golgi are impaired. We find that the endosome-localized actin regulator Coronin 1C is required for ER-associated fission of actin-dependent cargo-sorting domains. Coronin 1C is recruited to endosome buds independently of TMCC1, while TMCC1/ER recruitment requires Coronin 1C. This link between TMCC1 and Coronin 1C suggests that the timing of TMCC1-dependent ER recruitment is tightly regulated to occur after cargo has been properly sequestered into the bud."
https://openalex.org/W2891640176,"Cannabis sativa contains many related compounds known as phytocannabinoids. The main psychoactive and nonpsychoactive compounds are Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), respectively. Much of the evidence for clinical efficacy of CBD-mediated antiepileptic effects has been from case reports or smaller surveys. The mechanisms for CBD's anticonvulsant effects are unclear and likely involve noncannabinoid receptor pathways. CBD is reported to modulate several ion channels, including sodium channels (Nav). Evaluating the therapeutic mechanisms and safety of CBD demands a richer understanding of its interactions with central nervous system targets. Here, we used voltage-clamp electrophysiology of HEK-293 cells and iPSC neurons to characterize the effects of CBD on Nav channels. Our results show that CBD inhibits hNav1.1–1.7 currents, with an IC50 of 1.9–3.8 μm, suggesting that this inhibition could occur at therapeutically relevant concentrations. A steep Hill slope of ∼3 suggested multiple interactions of CBD with Nav channels. CBD exhibited resting-state blockade, became more potent at depolarized potentials, and also slowed recovery from inactivation, supporting the idea that CBD binding preferentially stabilizes inactivated Nav channel states. We also found that CBD inhibits other voltage-dependent currents from diverse channels, including bacterial homomeric Nav channel (NaChBac) and voltage-gated potassium channel subunit Kv2.1. Lastly, the CBD block of Nav was temperature-dependent, with potency increasing at lower temperatures. We conclude that CBD's mode of action likely involves 1) compound partitioning in lipid membranes, which alters membrane fluidity affecting gating, and 2) undetermined direct interactions with sodium and potassium channels, whose combined effects are loss of channel excitability.

Whereas the THC activity is mostly on the CB1 receptor, the anticonvulsant effects of CBD are not. These findings have inspired the growth of CB1- and CB2-independent focused research.

Other studies have used dissociated hippocampal cultures derived from embryonic day 18 rats to measure toxicity and neuroprotective responses to CBD.

Compounds that inhibit Nav current have been used extensively for clinical treatment of all of the above hyperexcitability disorders (26George A.L.

In this study, we sought to characterize, in detail, the biophysical effects of CBD on peripheral and central nervous system sodium channel isoforms. Previous reports suggested that Nav currents are inhibited by micromolar concentrations of CBD but lacked detailed concentration-response data and defined potencies. We sought to determine whether CBD has any selectivity across the sodium-channel superfamily. Thus, we measured the concentration dependence of inhibition of inactivated-state sodium channels by CBD. Our results demonstrate that CBD inhibits hNav1.1–1.7 with low micromolar potency (Fig. 1, A and D). To construct the concentration response, individual cells were exposed to single concentrations of CBD; then normalized inhibition at each concentration was pooled and fit with a Hill Langmuir equation, providing IC50 and Hill slopes (Fig. 1A). Representative current traces at approximately IC50 concentrations for each subtype tested are shown in (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, the sodium-current inhibition has very steep Hill slopes of >2 across all subtypes (Fig. 1, A and D). This indicates that CBD does not likely inhibit the channel currents through a 1:1 binding mechanism but instead suggests multiple interactions contribute to this inhibition. Although there is some variation in the IC50 values obtained on each subtype, the steep Hill slopes make IC50 values extremely sensitive to small changes in concentration, which could account in part for this variation of ∼2-fold in IC50. Similar to the hNav channels, CBD also inhibited the mouse Nav1.6 (mNav1.6) current, suggesting that these human IC50 values hold in rodent isoforms (Fig. 1, A and D). The chemical structures of CBD and THC are very similar, with the sole difference being the closure of a ring on THC as opposed to a free hydroxyl group in CBD. Given that this difference is the structural basis for the functional differences between CBD and THC, we tested THC against hNav1.2. Our results suggest that although the potency of the sodium-current inhibition between THC and CBD is similar, the Hill slope associated with THC is less steep (Fig. 1, B and D). This may indicate that THC has some differences in the mechanism of sodium-current inhibition than CBD. We next examined the effects of CBD on Nav channel activation by measuring peak channel conductance at membrane potentials between −120 and +30 mV. We show the effects of 3.3 μm CBD on peak sodium-current densities (Fig. 2A) and a plot of conductance (Fig. 2B). Approximately 90% of the sodium conductance was inhibited. The normalized conductance is plotted against membrane potential, showing that CBD does not induce large changes in either the midpoint (V½) or apparent valence (slope, k) of activation of the available sodium channels (p > 0.05) (Fig. 2C). Therefore, exposure to CBD at this concentration prevents channels from conducting; however, this exposure does not alter the voltage dependence of activation. We next measured the voltage dependence of fast inactivation. The normalized current amplitudes at the test pulse is shown as a function of prepulse voltages (Fig. 2D). The current at the test pulse was inhibited by more than 90%; however, unlike activation, the voltage dependence of steady-state fast inactivation of the remaining current was hyperpolarized by 8.1 mV (p = 0.0002). This indicates CBD increased the propensity for channels to inactivate over the 500-ms prepulse in channels that were not inhibited from opening from rest, suggesting that CBD stabilizes the inactivated state of sodium channels. It was previously shown that 1 μm CBD inhibits the persistent and resurgent sodium currents in form of epilepsy caused by hNav1.6 GOF mutation, N1768D, which displays a noninactivating component (12Patel R.R. Barbosa C. Brustovetsky T. Brustovetsky N. Cummins T.R. Aberrant epilepsy-associated mutant Nav1.6 sodium channel activity can be targeted with cannabidiol.Brain. 2016; 139 (27267376): 2164-218110.1093/brain/aww129Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We also found that CBD inhibits the resurgent current induced by including 200 μm β4-peptide to the intracellular solution. Fig. 2E shows that 5 μm CBD inhibits the majority of resurgent currents, which is consistent with CBD preventing channels from opening (Fig. 2A). Next, we sought to establish the concentration dependence of CBD inhibition of the persistent current of the inactivation-deficient N1768D mutant. We found that persistent currents were inhibited at slightly lower concentrations than the peak currents, suggesting there may be interactions between CBD and the open or inactivated states over the course of a 100-ms depolarization (Fig. 2F). We used a protocol to examine state-dependent inhibition across a range of holding potentials where channel inactivation varies (27Kuo C.C. Bean B.P. Slow binding of phenytoin to inactivated sodium channels in rat hippocampal neurons.Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46 (7969051): 716-725PubMed Google Scholar). We first held channels at a holding potential of −100 mV where channels are almost all in the resting state, whereas pulsing the channels 180 times at 1 Hz to allow CBD to reach equilibrium. Then we depolarized the holding potential by 10 mV three more times and repeated the pulse train at each voltage (Fig. 3A). We show the fractional block of sodium currents from the last pulse (180th) from each holding potential (Fig. 3B). Fig. 3C shows a plot of the inverse of the apparent IC50 fit with a four-state binding model that used parameters obtained from the Boltzmann fit of the voltage dependence of steady-state fast inactivation. This established that the apparent potency is directly related to the proportion of inactivated channels at different holding potentials. Our results demonstrate that CBD inhibits the sodium current from both rest and inactivated states; however, the potency of CBD is ∼10-fold greater for inhibiting inactivated compared with resting states (Fig. 3C). To assess the time dependence and degree of stabilization of the inactivated state, we then measured the recovery from inactivation of hNav1.6 in the presence of 3.7 μm CBD (Fig. 1A). This was done after depolarizing prepulse durations of 300 ms and 10 s, from a holding potential of −120 mV. These prepulse durations correspond to inactivation recovery from fast and slow inactivated states, respectively. The mean normalized recovery following the prepulse in CBD and control conditions were plotted and fit with a biexponential function (Fig. 3, D and E). The τSlow and fraction of the recovery fit with τSlow are plotted in Fig. 3F, which shows that CBD increases the fraction of recovery that is slow and the time constant of the slow component of recovery from inactivation from 300 ms to 10 s. This indicates that CBD slows the recovery from inactivation, supporting the hypothesis that CBD stabilizes the inactivated states (Fig. 3, D–F). Binding kinetics are typically responsive to changes in temperature, with higher temperatures increasing the rates of compound equilibration. To further investigate the mode of CBD interaction with sodium channels, we measured the observed rates of equilibration (time constant observed, τobs) of inhibition by fitting single exponential decays to inhibition of currents at three different temperatures. We examined the kinetics at concentrations above the IC50 to ensure a clear inhibition signal window to define the τobs (Fig. 4, A–C). Channels were held at −45 mV and pulsed at 1 Hz following a recovery pulse to −150 mV for 60 ms, and CBD was rapidly applied to the cells at different concentrations (Fig. 4A). The fraction of inhibition was normalized against the response in vehicle and plotted against the time elapsed after CBD addition, which was set at t = 0. The inhibition was then fit with a single exponential function to obtain τ and plotted against concentration. We show that τobs saturated at a minimum with increasing concentrations, counter to the prediction of a single two-state ligand-binding reaction, which predicts a continually increasing τobs with increasing compound concentrations (Fig. 4D). This suggests a rate-limiting step in the inhibitory pathway that is not dependent on the concentration of CBD in bulk solution as would be expected for binding to a specific inhibitory site on the channel. Interestingly, the kinetics of CBD inhibition were also found to be more rapid at cooler temperatures (Fig. 4D). This is the opposite of what is expected for a classic inhibitor in a two-state binding model, where the binding and unbinding rate constants, kon and koff, are intrinsically temperature-dependent. These results further suggest that CBD does not inhibit conductance through a direct interaction with a single specific binding site on the channel. We also found that the potency of CBD is increased at the lower temperatures (Fig. 4, E and F). Because CBD inhibition shares a characteristic of classic pore blockers (preference for the inactivated state), we created a pore mutation in the local-anesthetic receptor site in hNav1.1 (F1763A) to determine whether the CBD potency was affected. The Phe1763 residue is part of a well established binding site for many of the most common local anesthetics, including tetracaine (TTC) (28Ragsdale D.S. McPhee J.C. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Molecular determinants of state-dependent block of Na+ channels by local anesthetics.Science. 1994; 265 (8085162): 1724-172810.1126/science.8085162Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). To avoid any impacts on potency being caused by the shifts in stability of inactivation in this mutant (WT-hNav1.1 inactivation V½ = −62.0 ± 0.4 mV, slope = 7.2 ± 0.4, n = 3; F1763A inactivation V½ = −49.3 ± 0.1 mV, slope = 6.4 ± 0.1, n = 17), we measured inhibition from a holding potential of −45 mV where both channels were >50% inactivated. To validate the F1763A-mutant channels, we also measured the potency of TTC and compared the results against WT-hNav1.1, which showed a drop in potency (Fig. 5A). For CBD, the F1763A-mutant channels only caused a slight drop in potency of ∼2-fold (Fig. 5B). Molecular docking using a homology model of hNav1.1 based on the eukaryotic cockroach cryo-EM structure (Navpas) (Fig. S1A) suggested that CBD may in fact bind close to Phe1763. This suggests that Phe1763 is not a primary determinant of CBD inhibition but does not rule out the possibility that CBD may interact with other pore residues. To determine whether CBD could also inhibit other nonhuman Nav channels, we tested it on the bacterial homomeric Nav channel (NaChBac) (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, we found that NaChBac is also blocked by CBD, although with a slightly greater potency (Fig. 5C). Unlike mammalian Nav channels, NaChBac does not inactivate quickly (29Ren D. Navarro B. Xu H. Yue L. Shi Q. Clapham D.E. A prokaryotic voltage-gated sodium channel.Science. 2001; 294 (11743207): 2372-237510.1126/science.1065635Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that if the previously observed state dependence of CBD block in hNav channels depends upon the fast-inactivation process, then NaChBac should not show such a state dependence. The potency measured at −100 and −55 mV suggests that state dependence also exists in NaChBac; moreover, this effect may be even more pronounced than in hNav channels (Fig. 5D). This may implicate that CBD is not dependent upon, or selective among, different modes of Nav inactivation. Our findings in the homotetrameric NaChBac raise the question of whether CBD might also inhibit voltage-gated potassium channels, which are also homotetrameric. Our results indicate that CBD also inhibits the Kv2.1 current. Current traces are shown (Fig. 5E). These findings, along with the previous reports of CBD modulation of calcium-channel currents, support the idea that CBD is a polypharmacological inhibitor of voltage-dependent ionic currents (10Ross H.R. Napier I. Connor M. Inhibition of recombinant human T-type calcium channels by Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283 (18390906): 16124-1613410.1074/jbc.M707104200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Because CBD nonspecifically inhibits voltage-dependent currents, we sought to establish whether incubation of CBD could affect the channel trafficking to the cell surface over the time scale of our voltage-clamp experiments. To address this question, we assessed membrane-channel distribution in cells incubated overnight with CBD. The results indicate that overnight incubation in 5 μm CBD does not alter sodium channel trafficking and therefore would not affect trafficking on time scales of the voltage-clamp experiments (<20 min of exposure) (Fig. S1, B–D). To determine whether our observations in HEK cells translate to native neuronal voltage-dependent currents, we measured the effects of CBD on human iPSC neurons. First, we established that potency established with manual patch-clamp methodology, using continuous perfusion of compound, correlated with Qube data by measuring the potency of sodium-current inhibition of HEK cells expressing hNav1.2. Fig. 6A shows the mean normalized concentration response plot, which gave an IC50 value similar to the Qube value for hNav1.2. The slightly increased potency in the manual assay can be explained by the temperature dependence data (Fig. 4), because manual voltage clamp was performed at ∼20 °C (room temperature), and the Qube IC50 values were established at 28 °C (Fig. 1A). Consistent with our previous results in HEK cells, both the neuronal sodium and potassium currents were blocked ∼50% by 1 μm CBD as shown by the representative families of current traces in Fig. 6 (D and E). CBD also caused a hyperpolarization of ∼16 mV in the steady-state inactivation in the remaining available Nav channels in iPSCs (p = 0.0031), which was similar to the shifts observed in hNav1.1 in HEK cells (Figs. 2D and 6B). We also measured the rate time constant of open-state fast inactivation at −20 mV, which did not differ significantly before and after CBD perfusion (p > 0.05) (Fig. 6C). To test the effect of IC50 concentrations of CBD on neuronal excitability, we used a modified version of the Hodgkin–Huxley model to simulate a cortical neuron's excitability (30Hodgkin A.L. Huxley A.F. Currents carried by sodium and potassium ions through the membrane of the giant axon of Loligo.J.

The condition is more severe in immunodeficient animals, suggesting an infectious cause. Using metagenomics, we identify the causative agent as an atypical virus, termed ""mouse kidney parvovirus"" (MKPV), belonging to a divergent genus of Parvoviridae. MKPV was identified in animal facilities in Australia and North America, is transmitted via a fecal-oral or urinary-oral route, and is controlled by the adaptive immune system. Detailed analysis of the clinical course and histopathological features demonstrated a stepwise progression of pathology ranging from sporadic tubular inclusions to tubular degeneration and interstitial fibrosis and culminating in renal failure. In summary, we identify a widely distributed pathogen in laboratory mice and establish MKPV-induced nephropathy as a new tool for elucidating mechanisms of tubulointerstitial fibrosis that shares molecular features with chronic kidney disease in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2810616246,"Neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans and other nematodes have been thought to lack classical action potentials. Unexpectedly, we observe membrane potential spikes with defining characteristics of action potentials in C. elegans AWA olfactory neurons recorded under current-clamp conditions. Ion substitution experiments, mutant analysis, pharmacology, and modeling indicate that AWA fires calcium spikes, which are initiated by EGL-19 voltage-gated CaV1 calcium channels and terminated by SHK-1 Shaker-type potassium channels. AWA action potentials result in characteristic signals in calcium imaging experiments. These calcium signals are also observed when intact animals are exposed to odors, suggesting that natural odor stimuli induce AWA spiking. The stimuli that elicit action potentials match AWA's specialized function in climbing odor gradients. Our results provide evidence that C. elegans neurons can encode information through regenerative all-or-none action potentials, expand the computational repertoire of its nervous system, and inform future modeling of its neural coding and network dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2890629946,"Copper (Cu) is a necessary trace element participated in many physiological processes in plants. But excessive Cu2+ is toxic, which can activate intracellular signals that lead to cellular damage. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is at the center of cell signal transduction and has been reported to be involved in stress-related signaling pathways. ZmMPK3, a kind of MAPKs in maize cells, can be activated by diverse abiotic stresses. In the present study, we investigated the effects of Cu2+ on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) level, ZmMPK3 activity as well as the activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbic acid peroxidase (APX) using maize leaf as an experimental model. The results demonstrated that acute Cu2+ exposure for 24 hours led to rapid increases of H2O2 level and the increase in ZmMPK3 activity as well as the total activities of antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT and APX. H2O2 scavenger, dimethylthiourea (DMTU), effectively inhibited the Cu2+-increased H2O2 level and the activity of ZmMPK3 as well as the activities of the antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT and APX. Pre-treatment with the MAPK inhibitor, PD98059, significantly blocked the Cu2+-increased activities of ZmMPK3, CAT, APX and SOD, but didn't affect the accumulation of H2O2. Our results suggest that Cu2+ causes oxidative stress to the maize leaves which then activates defense antioxidant enzymes via MAPK pathway. Thus, the signaling pathway is Cu2+-H2O2-ZmMPK3-antioxidant enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2889687061,"Musculoskeletal models represent a powerful tool to gain knowledge on the internal forces acting at the joint level in a non-invasive way. However, these models can present some errors associated with the level of detail in their geometrical representation. For this reason, a thorough validation is necessary to prove the reliability of their predictions. This study documents the development of a generic musculoskeletal model and proposes a working logic and simulation techniques for identifying specific model features in need of refinement; as well as providing a quantitative validation for the prediction of hip contact forces (HCF). The model, implemented in the AnyBody Modeling System and based on the cadaveric dataset TLEM 2.0, was scaled to match the anthropometry of a patient fitted with an instrumented hip implant and to reproduce gait kinematics based on motion capture data. The relative contribution of individual muscle elements to the HCF and joint moments was analyzed to identify critical geometries, which were then compared to muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and, in case of inconsistencies, were modified to better match the volumetric scans. The predicted HCF showed good agreement with the overall trend and timing of the measured HCF from the instrumented prosthesis. The average root mean square error (RMSE), calculated for the total HCF was found to be 0.298*BW. Refining the geometries of the muscles thus identified reduced RMSE on HCF magnitudes by 17% (from 0.359*BW to 0.298*BW) over the whole gait cycle. The detailed study of individual muscle contributions to the HCF succeeded in identifying muscles with incorrect anatomy, which would have been difficult to intuitively identify otherwise. Despite a certain residual over-prediction of the final hip contact forces in the stance phase, a satisfactory level of geometrical accuracy of muscle paths has been achieved with the refinement of this model."
https://openalex.org/W2891754900,"When DNA is unwound during replication, it becomes overtwisted and forms positive supercoils in front of the translocating DNA polymerase. Unless removed or dissipated, this superhelical tension can impede replication elongation. Topoisomerases, including gyrase and topoisomerase IV in bacteria, are required to relax positive supercoils ahead of DNA polymerase but may not be sufficient for replication. Here, we find that GapR, a chromosome structuring protein in Caulobacter crescentus, is required to complete DNA replication. GapR associates in vivo with positively supercoiled chromosomal DNA, and our biochemical and structural studies demonstrate that GapR forms a dimer-of-dimers that fully encircles overtwisted DNA. Further, we show that GapR stimulates gyrase and topo IV to relax positive supercoils, thereby enabling DNA replication. Analogous chromosome structuring proteins that locate to the overtwisted DNA in front of replication forks may be present in other organisms, similarly helping to recruit and stimulate topoisomerases during DNA replication."

Furthermore, this adaptation strategy is beneficial for balancing motion detection and direction estimation at the lower signal-to-noise ratio encountered at night. These results provide insights into how light adaptation impacts motion encoding in the retina. Parallel processing and light adaptation are two salient aspects of retinal function. The encoding of visual scenes is partitioned across 30-40 distinct types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs); each type tiles space with its receptive fields (RFs) and responds to distinct visual features (Baden et al., 2016Baden T.

Concurrent with parallel processing, the retina must maintain sensitivity while avoiding saturation across the ten-billion-fold change in light intensity that separates a moonless night from a sunny day. This adaptation cannot be summarized by a simple gain change because the spatiotemporal structure of RGC RFs depends on light level. For example, center-surround antagonism (Kuffler, 1953Kuffler S.W. Discharge patterns and functional organization of mammalian retina.J. Neurophysiol. 1953; 16: 37-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar), temporal integration (Field et al., 2009Field G.D.

The synaptic and circuit mechanisms underlying a change in spatial encoding in the retina.Neuron. 2014; 82: 460-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) all change between rod- and cone-mediated vision. Furthermore, adaptation appears to be RGC-type specific (Tikidji-Hamburyan et al., 2015Tikidji-Hamburyan A. Reinhard K. Seitter H. Hovhannisyan A. Procyk C.A. Allen A.E. Schenk M. Lucas R.J. Munch T.A. Retinal output changes qualitatively with every change in ambient illuminance.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and thus it might alter how visual features produce responses across parallel pathways. The fact that the visual features encoded by RGCs depend on light level yokes light adaptation with parallel processing; this makes a complete understanding of one dependent on understanding the other. One instance of this potential dependence is illustrated by direction-selective RGCs (DSGCs), which exhibit strong firing when visual stimuli move in a particular “preferred” direction but weak firing to the opposite “null” direction (Taylor and Vaney, 2002Taylor W.R. Vaney D.I. Diverse synaptic mechanisms generate direction selectivity in the rabbit retina.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7712-7720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DSGCs come in several types, including four types of ON-OFF DSGCs and at least three types of ON DSGCs (Elstrott et al., 2008Elstrott J. Anishchenko A. Greschner M. Sher A. Litke A.M.

Furthermore, although ON-OFF DSGCs are frequently viewed as a single population, it is clear that they exhibit functional differences beyond their preferred directions. For example, superior-preferring ON-OFF DSGCs are electrically coupled by gap junctions, whereas cells preferring the other three directions are not coupled (Trenholm et al., 2013Trenholm S. McLaughlin A.J. Schwab D.J. Awatramani G.B. Dynamic tuning of electrical and chemical synaptic transmission in a network of motion coding retinal neurons.J.

Direct evidence for daily plasticity of electrical coupling between rod photoreceptors in the mammalian retina.J. Neurosci. 2016; 36: 178-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that superior-preferring ON-OFF DSGCs might adapt to light differently from other DSGC types. Determining the extent to which light adaptation is heterogeneous across DSGCs is necessary for understanding how the retina encodes motion across day and night. Here we use large-scale multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings from mouse retina to examine how the direction tuning of multiple subtypes of DSGCs depends on light level. We find that among ON-OFF DSGCs, superior-preferring cells broadened their direction tuning at low light levels, whereas this broadening was not present in other DSGC types. We show that this functional asymmetry in light adaptation is largely caused by two mechanisms: gap-junction-mediated electrical coupling and a reduction in effectual GABA-mediated inhibition. We further show that this asymmetry in direction tuning at low light levels strikes a balance between improving the detection of motion in dimly lit conditions against a cost to the accuracy of direction estimation. These results reveal how motion-sensitive neurons adapt to changes in the ambient light level and highlight how adaptation can tune parallel processing in neural populations to meet challenges imposed by changes in signal and noise. To measure changes in DSGC function across light levels from extracellular MEA recordings, one must reliably distinguish DSGCs from other simultaneously recorded cells and functionally classify them into distinct ON and ON-OFF subtypes (Elstrott et al., 2008Elstrott J.

A retinal code for motion along the gravitational and body axes.Nature. 2017; 22: 492-497Google Scholar). To identify the DSGCs, we presented square wave gratings moving in different directions while recording spike responses from the ganglion-cell layer of dorsal retina (Elstrott et al., 2008Elstrott J. Anishchenko A. Greschner M. Sher A. Litke A.M. Chichilnisky E.J. Feller M.B. Direction selectivity in the retina is established independent of visual experience and cholinergic retinal waves.Neuron. 2008; 58: 499-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). When moving in the “preferred” direction, the gratings elicited strong responses in DSGCs, whereas they elicited weak responses when movement was in the “null” direction (Figure 1A). In contrast, responses of non-DSGCs were not dependent on motion direction (Figure 1B). We distinguished DSGCs from other RGCs by fitting a two-Gaussian mixture model to the vector sum of responses to gratings moving at two speeds under photopic conditions (Figure 1C, see STAR Methods). One Gaussian model captured DSGCs (Figure 1C and 1D, magenta), while the second Gaussian model captured all other RGCs. This procedure avoided drawing an arbitrary threshold to distinguish these populations. To distinguish ON from ON-OFF DSGCs, we leveraged their distinct speed tuning: ON DSGCs preferred relatively slow speeds (Figure 1E), whereas ON-OFF DSGCs responded to a broader range of speeds (Figure 1F) (Oyster, 1968Oyster C.W.

The speed tuning curves were analyzed by principal-component analysis (PCA), which allowed a low-dimensional representation of the differences in speed tuning between ON and ON-OFF DSGCs (Figure 1G; see STAR Methods). A two-Gaussian mixture model distinguished the two cell classes (Figure 1G, red versus blue). The group of cells preferring higher speeds exhibited an organization along four cardinal directions (Figure 1G, red), whereas the group of cells that preferred lower speeds exhibited an organization along three cardinal directions (Figure 1G, blue). This result is consistent with previous work examining the preferred directions of ON and ON-OFF DSGCs ([Oyster and Barlow, 1967Oyster C.W. Barlow H.B.

Note that the coordinates for direction preferences are in visual space (e.g., “superior” corresponds to ventral motion on the retina and upward motion in the environment; see STAR Methods). Analyzing the spatial locations of the DSGCs from their electrical images (EIs; see STAR Methods) suggested that each population exhibited a mosaic-like organization (Figure 1H). Furthermore, an analysis of the distance to the nearest neighbor revealed an exclusion zone around each cell within a mosaic (Figure S1E). These results suggest that each group comprised an irreducible cell type (Devries and Baylor, 1997Devries S.H. Baylor D.A. Mosaic arrangement of ganglion cell receptive fields in rabbit retina.J.

Peichl L. Boycott B.B. Dendritic territories of cat retinal ganglion cells.Nature. 1981; 292: 344-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). To further validate the identification and classification of DSGCs, we used the HB9::GFP mouse line, which exhibits GFP expression in superior-preferring ON-OFF DSGCs (Trenholm et al., 2011Trenholm S. Johnson K. Li X. Smith R.G. Awatramani G.B. Parallel mechanisms encode direction in the retina.Neuron. 2011; 71: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We tested for a spatial match between the GFP-positive cells and functionally identified superior-preferring ON-OFF DSGCs (Figure 1I and Figure S1) (Li et al., 2015Li P.H. Gauthier J.L. Schiff M. Sher A. Ahn D. Field G.D. Greschner M. Callaway E.M. Anatomical identification of extracellularly recorded cells in large-scale multielectrode recordings.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 4663-4675Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). By comparing the locations of recorded RGCs to the location of GFP-positive cells (see STAR Methods), we found that functionally identified superior-preferring ON-OFF DSGCs exhibited a high degree of alignment with GFP-positive cells (Figure 1I), whereas other types of functionally identified DSGCs were located randomly with respect to GFP-positive cells (Figures S1C and S1D). These results validate the functional classification of DSGCs by matching a functionally defined type to a genetically defined type. Having developed an approach to identify and record simultaneously from seven DSGC types, we next examined the extent to which the response properties of these cells depended on light level. We measured direction tuning curves of DSGCs by using drifting gratings at light levels ranging from 1 to 10,000 photoisomerizations (R∗) per rod per second (8500 R∗/M-cone/s); this spans rod and cone-mediated vision. We quantified the direction tuning of each type by calculating their direction selectivity indices (DSIs) and direction tuning widths (see STAR Methods). Whereas anterior, inferior, and posterior ON-OFF DSGCs exhibited relatively stable tuning across light levels (Figures 2B–2D and 2F–2H ) (ANOVA on the DSIs: anterior, p = 0.13; inferior, p = 0.57; posterior, p = 0.50) (ANOVA on the tuning width: anterior, p = 0.07; inferior, p = 0.21; posterior, p = 0.002), the direction tuning of superior-preferring ON-OFF DSGCs broadened as light levels decreased below cone threshold (Figures 2A and 2E) (p < 1.1 × 10−7, ANOVA on DSI and tuning widths). We also found that the DSI of superior-preferring DSGCs was lower than those of the other three types under scotopic conditions (Figure 2I and Figure S2F; p < 0.001 for comparisons with each of the three other DSGC types). Their tuning widths were also broader than those of the other three types under scotopic conditions (Figure 2J, p < 0.001 for comparisons with each of the three other DSGC types). Note that spontaneous activity (Figure S2E) was subtracted, so responses to stimuli in the null direction represent a change in spike rate above baseline. All calculations of DSI and tuning width include this subtraction. These results reveal the impact of adaptation across the population of ON-OFF DSGCs: as light level decreases, DSGC population tuning switches from homogeneous (all narrow) to heterogeneous (three narrow, one wide; Figures 2J and 2K). We also analyzed direction tuning of simultaneously recorded ON DSGCs (Figures S2A–S2D). These cells exhibited consistent and stable direction tuning across subtypes and light levels. Thus, we focus on ON-OFF DSGCs for the remaining analyses. What mechanisms cause superior-preferring ON-OFF DSGCs to light-adapt distinctly from other DSGC types? One likely mechanism is the Cx36-mediated homotypic gap-junction coupling that only these DSGCs exhibit (Trenholm et al., 2013Trenholm S. McLaughlin A.J. Schwab D.J. Awatramani G.B. Dynamic tuning of electrical and chemical synaptic transmission in a network of motion coding retinal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 14927-14938Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, Vaney, 1994Vaney D.I. Territorial organization of direction-selective ganglion cells in rabbit retina.J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6301-6316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This coupling could enable excitation to more effectively drive spikes in superior-preferring ON-OFF DSGCs (Trenholm et al., 2014Trenholm S. McLaughlin A.J. Schwab D.J. Turner M.H. Smith R.G. Rieke F. Awatramani G.B. Nonlinear dendritic integration of electrical and chemical synaptic inputs drives fine-scale correlations.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1759-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To test for a role of gap junctions in the broadening of DS tuning at low light levels, we developed a conditional knockout mouse in which gap-junction coupling is selectively disrupted among superior-preferring ON-OFF DSGCs. The mouse line contains a homozygous floxed Cx36 allele (see STAR Methods and Figures S3I–S3K), a Fstl4-Cre allele for tamoxifen-dependent Cre expression in ON-OFF superior-preferring DSGCs (Kim et al., 2010Kim I.J. Zhang Y. Meister M. Sanes J.R. Laminar restriction of retinal ganglion cell dendrites and axons: subtype-specific developmental patterns revealed with transgenic markers.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 1452-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and a floxed tdTomato transgene to report functional Cre-mediated recombination (Figure 3A)(Madisen et al., 2010Madisen L. Zwingman T.A. Sunkin S.M. Oh S.W. Zariwala H.A. Gu H. Ng L.L. Palmiter R.D. Hawrylycz M.J. Jones A.R. et al.A robust and high-throughput Cre reporting and characterization system for the whole mouse brain.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (3847) Google Scholar). Developing a conditional knockout mouse was critical because transmission of rod signals through both the primary and secondary rod pathways is dependent on Cx36 (Figure 3B)(Bloomfield and Dacheux, 2001Bloomfield S.A. Dacheux R.F. Rod vision: Pathways and processing in the mammalian retina.Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2001; 20: 351-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). We refer to these animals as FACx mice. To determine the extent to which coupling was reduced among superior-preferring ON-OFF DSGCs in FACx mice, we compared the spread of neurobiotin between tdTomato-positive RGCs in these mice and GFP-positive RGCs in Hb9::GFP mice. Hb9::GFP mice were used as the control group because they express GFP exclusively in superior-preferring ON-OFF DSGCs (and are thus easily targeted) but exhibit normal levels of homotypic gap-junction coupling, as judged by neurobiotin diffusion (Figure 3C) (Trenholm et al., 2011Trenholm S. Johnson K. Li X. Smith R.G. Awatramani G.B. Parallel mechanisms encode direction in the retina.Neuron. 2011; 71: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In FACx mice, neurobiotin diffusion indicated an attenuation in tracer coupling relative to that in Hb9::GFP animals (Figure 3C and Figures S3A–S3H). Note, even constitutive Cx36 KO animals exhibited some residual tracer coupling between superior-preferring ON-OFF DSGCs (Figure S3G), probably because these cells also express Cx45 (Schubert et al., 2005Schubert T. Maxeiner S. Kruger O. Willecke K. Weiler R. Connexin45 mediates gap junctional coupling of bistratified ganglion cells in the mouse retina.J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 490: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, FACx animals exhibited reduced homotypic tracer coupling among superior-preferring ON-OFF DSGCs. Functional electrical coupling between superior-preferring ON-OFF DSGCs was strongly attenuated in FACx mice. To assess electrical coupling, we analyzed the cross-correlation of spike trains between pairs of superior-preferring ON-OFF DSGCs. Direct electrical coupling manifests as temporally precise, bimodal peaks in the cross-correlation between two spike trains (Brivanlou et al., 1998Brivanlou I.H. Warland D.K. Meister M. Mechanisms of concerted firing among retinal ganglion cells.Neuron. 1998; 20: 527-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, DeVries, 1999DeVries S.H. Correlated firing in rabbit retinal ganglion cells.J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 81: 908-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, Trenholm et al., 2014Trenholm S. McLaughlin A.J. Schwab D.J. Turner M.H. Smith R.G. Rieke F. Awatramani G.B. Nonlinear dendritic integration of electrical and chemical synaptic inputs drives fine-scale correlations.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1759-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In control mice (C57/bl6), cross-correlograms of spike trains from neighboring superior-preferring ON-OFF DSGCs exhibited sharp bimodal peaks in response to checkerboard noise (Figure 3D). This structure indicates that when one cell generates an action potential, the neighboring cell is significantly more likely to generate a spike ∼2 ms later. These bimodal peaks were detected between most neighboring pairs of superior-preferring ON-OFF DSGCs in C57/bl6 mice (Figure 3G; 35 of 49 neighbors; see STAR Methods). Bimodal peaks were almost entirely absent from the cross-correlograms of ON-OFF DSGCs that preferred other directions (Figure 3F; only 1 of 95 neighboring pairs met the threshold for a bimodal peak). These results show that ON-OFF superior-preferring DSGCs form a strongly coupled network in control retinas. In FACx animals, electrical coupling between neighboring ON-OFF superior-preferring DSGCs was strongly attenuated (Figure 3E). Across the population, many fewer neighboring cell pairs exhibited bimodal peaks (Figure 3H). Control analyses indicated that this change in coupling could not be explained by differences in the number of spikes observed in superior-preferring ON-OFF DSGCs between WT and FACx mice (see STAR Methods). We interpret the residual coupling in some pairs of FACx mice as cells in which tamoxifen administration failed to drive Cre-mediated recombination and excision of the floxed Cx36 gene (Figure 3H; 15 of 36 neighbors). Thus, these experiments indicate that strong reciprocal electrical coupling that synchronizes spiking across the population of superior-preferring DSGCs is dependent upon Cx36 expression and that the frequency of this coupling is appreciably reduced in FACx animals. We next tested the impact of attenuated electrical coupling between superior-preferring ON-OFF DSGCs on their direction tuning. At low light levels (1 R∗/rod/s), direction tuning of superior-preferring ON-OFF DSGCs was substantially narrower in FACx mice than in wild-type mice (p < 0.001), but it was still broader than that of DSGCs preferring other directions (Figure 4A and 4B , p < 0.001). In fact, DSIs did not converge until the brightest tested light levels (Figure 4B). This change in tuning width was restricted to the superior-preferring ON-OFF DSGCs; cells preferring other directions exhibited normal tuning widths across light levels in FACx mice (Figures 4A and 4B). To test the possibility that residual coupling among some superior-preferring ON-OFF DSGCs produced a partial narrowing of tuning curves at low light levels, we compared tuning widths among superior-preferring ON-OFF DSGCs from putative knockout cells to those from putative normal cells (those that continued to express Cx36) in FACx mice (see STAR Methods). No significant difference in DSI was observed between these two populations (Figure S5A, p = 0.26), indicating that the incomplete narrowing wa"

This system has been adopted for numerous genome engineering applications in research and recently, therapeutics. The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been largely implemented by delivery of Cas9 as protein, RNA, or plasmid along with a chimeric crRNA-tracrRNA guide RNA (gRNA) under the expression of a pol III promoter, such as U6. Using this approach, multiplex genome engineering has been achieved by delivering several U6-gRNA plasmids targeting multiple loci. However, this approach is limited due to the efficiently of delivering multiple plasmids to a single cell at one time. To augment the capability and accessibility of multiplexed genome engineering, we developed an efficient golden gate based method to assemble gRNAs linked by optimal Csy4 ribonuclease sequences to deliver up to 10 gRNAs as a single gRNA array transcript. Here we report the optimal expression of our guide RNA array under a strong pol II promoter. This system can be implemented alongside the myriad of CRISPR applications, allowing users to model complex biological processes requiring numerous gRNAs."

Immortalised human and murine myoblast lines, and primary murine satellite cells showed varying degrees of myogenic differentiation when cultured in these biomaterials, with C2 myoblasts in particular forming large multinucleated myotubes in collagen I or Fibrin.

However, in vivo terminally differentiated podocytes are difficult to be maintained in in vitro culture. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer the unique possibility for directed differentiation into mature podocytes. The current differentiation protocol to generate iPSC-derived podocyte-like cells provides a robust and reproducible method to obtain podocyte-like cells after 10 days that can be employed in in vitro research and biomedical engineering. Previous published protocols were improved by testing varying differentiation media, growth factors, seeding densities, and time course conditions. Modifications were made to optimize and simplify the one-step differentiation procedure. In contrast to earlier protocols, adherent cells for differentiation were used, the use of fetal bovine serum (FBS) was reduced to a minimum, and thus ß-mercaptoethanol could be omitted. The plating densities of iPSC stocks as well as the seeding densities for differentiation cultures turned out to be a crucial parameter for differentiation results. Conditionally immortalized human podocytes served as reference controls. iPSC-derived podocyte-like cells showed a typical podocyte-specific morphology and distinct expression of podocyte markers synaptopodin, podocin, nephrin and WT-1 after 10 days of differentiation as assessed by immunofluorescence staining or Western blot analysis. qPCR results showed a downregulation of pluripotency markers Oct4 and Sox-2 and a 9-fold upregulation of the podocyte marker synaptopodin during the time course of differentiation. Cultured podocytes exhibited endocytotic uptake of albumin. In toxicological assays, matured podocytes clearly responded to doxorubicin (Adriamycin™) with morphological alterations and a reduction in cell viability after 48 h of incubation."

In visual cortex, neuronal responses to stimuli inside the receptive field (RF) are suppressed by stimuli in the RF surround. To understand the circuits and cortical layers processing spatial context, we simultaneously recorded across all layers of macaque primary visual cortex while presenting stimuli at increasing distances from the recorded cells’ RF. We find that near versus far-surround stimuli activate distinct layers, thus revealing unique laminar contributions to the processing of local and global spatial context. Stimuli in the near-surround evoke the earliest subthreshold responses in superficial and upper-deep layers, and earliest suppression of spiking responses in superficial layers. Conversely, far-surround stimuli evoke the earliest subthreshold responses in feedback-recipient layer 1 and lower-deep layers, and earliest suppression of spiking responses almost simultaneously in all layers, except 4C, where suppression emerges last.

The evaluation of postural control can contribute to the early detection of balance deficits and help health professionals to manage this problem to prevent falls in older adults. The aim of this study was to identify center of pressure cut-offs to differentiate between older adults with and without falls in the past 12 months. The participants were 170 older adults (mean age 67 years, 50 fallers and 120 non-fallers). Center of pressure area and sway velocity in the anterior-posterior and medio-lateral directions were assessed using a force platform during three 30s one-legged stance trials with eyes open. The mean across trials was used for analysis. The time-limit (how long the participant was able to stay in one-legged stance, up to 30s) was also assessed. Fallers had poorer postural control than non-fallers (effect size ≥ 0.52, P <0.05). The cut-offs identified were 10.3 cm2 for Center of pressure area, 2.9 cm/s for velocity in the anterior-posterior, and 3.4 cm/s for medio-lateral velocity. The force platform parameters obtained an area under the curve of 0.72, with sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 68%. There were no significant differences between non-fallers and fallers for time-limit variable (17 seconds vs. 18 seconds). Force platform parameters during one-legged stance were associated with history of falls in older adults. The cut-offs obtained acceptable area under curve, sensitivity and specificity, with center of pressure area presenting the best performance to differentiate between fallers and non-fallers."
https://openalex.org/W2890229598,"C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein 13 (CTRP13) is a secreted adipokine that can ameliorate abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism. However, the functional role of CTRP13 in the development of atherosclerotic plaques has yet to be described. In this study, we collected blood samples from patients of coronary artery diseases and apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-/- mice that were fed a Western diet for 12 wk to induce atherosclerosis and found that serum CTRP13 level was decreased. En face staining of aortas and aortic sinus in ApoE-/- mice showed that ectopic CTRP13 infusion in vivo dramatically decreased lesion areas, as well as reduced inflammatory responses with less macrophage content. In primary peritoneal macrophages in vitro, CTRP13 supplement reduced oxidized LDL uptake, foam-cell formation, and trapping, together with the suppressed cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) protein levels. Reduced CD36 protein level was attributed to the autophagy-lysosome-dependent degradation of CD36 at the post-transcriptional level. The blocking of autophagy-lysosome induction could increase CD36 protein level, foam-cell formation, and migration, thus abolishing the protective effects of CTRP13 on atherosclerosis. In summary, these findings define CTRP13 as a novel approach for preventing atherosclerotic plaque formation via modulation of lipid uptake and foam-cell migration.—Wang, C., Xu, W., Liang, M., Huang, D., Huang, K.

https://openalex.org/W2889563239,"Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the nutritional status and its risk factors among children under 5 years, with special focus on the coexistence of under and over nutrition in population level. Methods We enrolled 6,570 children under 5 years among 26 counties in poor areas of China. Prevalences of malnutrition (stunting, underweight, wasting, overweight) were calculated. Overweight was evaluated using two indicators–weight for height Z score (WHZ) and body mass index for age Z score (BAZ), and results were compared. Results The total prevalence of malnutrition was 19.2%. The prevalence of stunting and overweight were as high as 8.4% and 8.8%, respectively. The BAZ-estimated prevalence of overweight was 9.9%, which was higher than the WHZ-estimated prevalence (p<0.001). Children older than 12 months age, within a minority group, with a caregiver of illiteracy/primary education level were significantly associated with stunting in multilevel regression models (p<0.05). Children younger than 24 months age and boys were significantly associated with overweight (p<0.05). Conclusions Stunting and overweight were coexisted in surveyed areas. In conclusion, BAZ tended to overestimate the overweight prevalence compared with WHZ. While with the raising problem of childhood overweight, stunting should still be on the agenda for the poor areas in China. To improve children’s nutritional status in poor areas of China, caregivers with children at high risk of malnutrition should be guided for healthy feeding practices."
https://openalex.org/W2889808501,"It has been reported that CD63, an exosome marker, is expressed in solid cancer tissues. However, its significance in patients with gastric cancer has not been clarified. Exosomes derived from cancer cells and stromal cells might play an important role in the intracellular communications involved in the development of carcinoma. This study aimed to clarify the relationship between CD63 expression in cancer cells and stromal cells and clinical-pathologic factors.A total of 595 gastric cancer patients were enrolled in this study. CD63 expression in cancer cells and stromal cells was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The correlations between CD63 expression and several clinicopathological factors were investigated.CD63 expression was mainly observed on the cell membranes of cancer cells, and in the cytoplasm of stromal cells. Of 595 patients, 247 cases had CD63-positive cancer cells, and 107 cases had CD63-positive stromal cells. Cases with CD63-positive cancer cells were significantly correlated with scirrhous-type gastric cancer, tumor depth, lymph node metastasis, lymphatic invasion, and tumor size. Cases with CD63-positive stromal cells were significantly correlated with age (≥65), tumor depth (T3-4), lymphatic invasion, and tumor size (≥ 5 cm). The 5-year survival rate was significantly lower (p<0.001) in patients with CD63-positive than CD63-negative tumors. Multivariate analysis showed that CD63 expression in cancer cells was a significant independent prognostic factor in patients with gastric cancer.CD63 might be a prognostic marker for patients with gastric cancer. CD63-positive exosomes might be associated with the interaction between stromal cells and cancer cells."

Thus, we investigated the involvement of ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) in vitamin D intestinal efflux. Both cholecalciferol (D3) and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol [25(OH)D3] apical effluxes were decreased by chemical inhibition of ABCB1 in Caco-2 cells and increased by ABCB1 overexpression in Griptites or Madin-Darby canine kidney type II cells. Mice deficient for the 2 murine ABCB1s encoded by Abcb1a and Abcb1b genes (Abcb1−/−) displayed an accumulation of 25(OH)D3 in plasma, intestine, brain, liver, and kidneys, together with an increased D3 postprandial response after gavage compared with controls. 25(OH)D3 efflux through Abcb1−/− intestinal expiants was markedly decreased compared with controls. This reduction of 25(OH)D3 transfer from plasma to lumen was further confirmed in vivo in intestine-perfused mice. Docking experiments established that both D3 and 25(OH)D3 could bind with high affinity to Caenorhabditis elegans P-glycoprotein, used as an ABCB1 model. Finally, in a group of 39 healthy male adults, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in ABCB1 (rs17064) was significantly associated with the fasting plasma 25(OH)D3 concentration. Thus, we showed here for the first time that ABCB1 is involved in neo-absorbed vitamin D efflux by the enterocytes and that it also contributes to vitamin D transintestinal excretion and likely impacts vitamin D status.—Margier, M., Collet, X., leMay, C., Desmarchelier, C., André, F., Lebrun, C., Defoort, C., Bluteau, A., Borel, P., Lespine, A., Reboul, E.

https://openalex.org/W2891854272,"Low temperature stress is one of the major abiotic stresses limiting the productivity of Geng (japonica) rice grown the temperate regions as well as in tropical high lands worldwide. To develop rice varieties with improved cold tolerance (CT) at the reproductive stage, 84 BC2 CT introgression lines (ILs) were developed from five populations through backcross breeding. These CT ILs plus 310 random ILs from the same BC populations were used for dissecting genetic networks underlying CT in rice by detecting QTLs and functional genetic units (FGUs) contributing to CT. Seventeen major QTLs for CT were identified using five selective introgression populations and the method of segregation distortion. Of them, three QTLs were confirmed using the random populations and seven others locate in the regions with previously reported CT QTLs/genes. Using multi-locus probability tests and linkage disequilibrium (LD) analyses, 46 functional genetic units (FGUs) (37 single loci and 9 association groups or AGs) distributed in 37 bins (~20%) across the rice genome for CT were detected. Together, each of the CT loci (bins) was detected in 1.7 populations, including 18 loci detected in two or more populations. Putative genetic networks (multi-locus structures) underlying CT were constructed based on strong non-random associations between or among donor alleles at the unlinked CT loci/FGUs identified in the CT ILs, suggesting the presence of strong epistasis among the detected CT loci. Our results demonstrated the power and usefulness of using selective introgression for simultaneous improvement and genetic dissection of complex traits such as CT in rice."
https://openalex.org/W2891061922,"ASXL1 (additional sex combs like 1) is a gene that is mutated in a number of hematological neoplasms. The most common genetic alteration is c.1934dupG p.Gly646fs. Previous publications have shown that ASXL1 mutations have a negative prognostic impact in patients with MDS and AML, however, controversy exists regarding the molecular testing of ASXL1 c.1934dupG as polymerase splippage over the adjacent homopolymer could lead to a false-positive result. Here, we report the first study to systematically test different targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) approaches for this mutation in patients with hematologic neoplasms. In addition, we investigated the impact of proofreading capabilities of different DNA polymerases on ASXL1 c.1934dupG somatic mutation using conventional Sanger sequencing, another common method for ASXL1 genotyping. Our results confirm that ASXL1 c.1934dupG can be detected as a technical artifact, which can be overcome by the use of appropriate enzymes and library preparation methods. A systematic study of serial samples from 30 patients show that ASXL1 c.1934dupG is a somatic mutation in haematological neoplasms including MDS, AML, MPN and MDS/MPN and often is associated with somatic mutations of TET2, EZH2, IDH2, RUNX1, NRAS and DNMT3A. The pattern of clonal evolution suggests that this ASXL1 mutation might be an early mutational event that occurs in the principal clonal population and can serve as a clonal marker for persistent/relapsing disease."

Skin infections have been shown to be common in remote Aboriginal communities, particularly in the Northern Territory, Australia. However, primary care data on skin and other infectious diseases among Aboriginal children living in remote areas of Western Australia are limited. We conducted a retrospective review of clinic presentations of all children aged 0 to 5 years presenting to four clinics located in the Western Desert region of Western Australia between 2007 and 2012 to determine this burden at a local level. Infectious diseases accounted for almost 50% of all clinic presentations. Skin infections (sores, scabies and fungal infections) were the largest proportion (16%), with ear infections (15%) and upper respiratory infections (13%) also high. Skin infections remained high in all age groups; 72% of children presented at least once with skin infections. Scabies accounted for only 2% of all presentations, although one-quarter of children presented during the study for management of scabies. Skin sores accounted for 75% of the overall burden of skin infections. Improved public health measures targeting bacterial skin infections are needed to reduce this high burden of skin infections in Western Australia."
https://openalex.org/W2890219147,"Background Human Papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines for adolescents are pivotal in the control of cervical cancer, the commonest women specific malignancy in sub-Saharan Africa. Knowledge about cervical cancer have been reported to be low in Africa but expressed acceptability for HPV vaccines have been high. The reason for this mismatch is not clear. An understanding of the interpretation of cervical cancer and views about HPV vaccine are important as they can affect actual decision making regarding adolescents’ uptake of HPV vaccine. This study explored contextual interpretations of stakeholders regarding cervical cancer and HPV vaccines for adolescents in five selected communities in Ibadan, Nigeria. Methods Qualitative data were collected through twenty focus group discussions among parents of adolescents, religious and traditional leaders, school teachers and adolescents; and four key informant interviews with the identified traditional healers in the selected communities. Constant comparison analysis was done after transcription. Results Almost every group had at least one person who had seen a cervical cancer patient. Cervical cancer was widely viewed as being caused by promiscuity of women while older participants believed that the alteration of lifestyle by civilization was a major contributory factor. There was also a general notion that it was due to a curse. The role of HPV was generally not known. Most participants were favourable towards HPV immunization for adolescents but traditional healers and some religious leaders were not. The high cost of the vaccines and possibility of side effects where the main concerns about the introduction of HPV vaccine. Decision to take the vaccine rest with the fathers whose views were heavily influenced by traditional and religious leaders. Conclusions Awareness about cervical cancer may not be as low as earlier reported and there were many misconceptions about cervical cancer in the study communities. It is important to address these misconceptions to ensure successful introduction of HPV vaccine for adolescents in future."
https://openalex.org/W2891548658,"Many animals guide their movements using optic flow, the displacement of stationary objects across the retina caused by self-motion. How do animals selectively synthesize a global motion pattern from its local motion components? To what extent does this feature selectivity rely on circuit mechanisms versus dendritic processing? Here we used in vivo calcium imaging to identify pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms for processing local motion signals in global motion detection circuits in Drosophila. Lobula plate tangential cells (LPTCs) detect global motion by pooling input from local motion detectors, T4/T5 neurons. We show that T4/T5 neurons suppress responses to adjacent local motion signals whereas LPTC dendrites selectively amplify spatiotemporal sequences of local motion signals consistent with preferred global patterns. We propose that sequential nonlinear suppression and amplification operations allow optic flow circuitry to simultaneously prevent saturating responses to local signals while creating selectivity for global motion patterns critical to behavior."

The crystal structure of Lhr-(1–856) in complex with AMPPNP·Mg2+ and a “loading/tracking” 3′ DNA single strand revealed that the enzyme consists of two N-terminal RecA-like domains that bind the AMPPNP·Mg2+, a central winged helix domain, and a C-terminal domain of novel tertiary structure (2Ejaz A.

All four domains make contributions to Lhr’s unique DNA interface. Homologs of Lhr-(1–856), all of similar size (∼800–900 aa), are present in the proteomes of scores of diverse bacterial and archaeal taxa. We will henceforth refer to this shorter Lhr-like protein as Lhr-Core. The striking feature of the bacterial Lhr-Core clade is its genetic organization. Most commonly, Lhr-Core is encoded in a co-oriented four-gene cluster comprising a putative exonuclease (Exo) of the metallo-β-lactamase enzyme family, an ATP-dependent DNA ligase, Lhr-Core, and a member of the binuclear metallo-phosphoesterase (MPE) enzyme family. We refer to this operon-like arrangement of the four genes as a “class I” cluster (Fig. 1). Variations on this theme include cases where one or more additional co-oriented ORFs, encoding proteins unrelated to nucleic acid enzymology, are inserted between the DNA ligase and Lhr-Core genes (class Ia cluster) (Fig. 1). For example, in the class Ia cluster of Pseudomonas putida, the intervening ORF encodes a member of the succinyl glutamate desuccinylase/aspartoacylase enzyme family. In another variation, the nuclease and ligase proteins are fused and encoded by a single continuous ORF upstream of Lhr-Core (class Ib cluster) (Fig. 1). A distinctive arrangement of the four genes is found in other bacteria in which the Exo-ligase cassette has been inverted en bloc so that they are transcribed divergently from the Lhr-Core and MPE genes; these are designated class II and IIa clusters (Fig. 1). Finally, other bacteria and archaea have a two-gene Lhr-Core·MPE cassette (dubbed a class III cluster) that is not linked to Exo or ligase genes (Fig. 1). The wide prevalence of a heretofore uncharacterized gene cluster specifying putative helicase, nuclease, and ligase enzymes suggests to us the existence of a new bacterial nucleic acid repair pathway centered around Lhr-Core. To understand whether and how these enzymes might contribute to nucleic acid repair, we undertook here to purify and characterize biochemically the Lhr-Core and MPE proteins specified by the class Ia cluster of P. putida. We report that the P. putida Lhr-Core is a bona fide ATP-driven 3′-to-5′ translocase and DNA helicase and that the MPE is a manganese-dependent phosphodiesterase/DNA endonuclease with structural and functional similarity to Mre11. The 816-aa P. putida KT2440 Lhr-Core polypeptide is homologous to the 856-aa ATPase/helicase domain of the 1507-amino acid M. smegmatis Lhr protein (Fig. 2). A primary structure alignment of P. putida Lhr-Core and M. smegmatis Lhr highlights 325 positions of amino acid side chain identity/similarity (Fig. 2). The conserved positions include eight side chains that make atomic contacts to AMPPNP·Mg2+ in the M. smegmatis Lhr crystal structure (shaded gold in Fig. 2) and seven side chains that contact the ssDNA loading strand (shaded green in Fig. 2) (2Ejaz A. Ordonez H. Jacewicz A. Ferrao R. Shuman S. Structure of mycobacterial 3′-to-5′ RNA:DNA helicase Lhr bound to a ssDNA tracking strand highlights distinctive features of a novel family of bacterial helicases.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46 (29165676): 442-45510.1093/nar/gkx1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In particular, the four amino acids found to be essential in M. smegmatis Lhr for the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to duplex unwinding (Thr-145, Arg-279, Ile-528, and Trp-597; denoted by triangles in Fig. 2) are conserved in P. putida Lhr-Core. A gap in the sequence alignment at residue 280 of P. putida Lhr-Core corresponds to a disordered surface loop in the second RecA domain of the M. smegmatis Lhr structure (in red font in Fig. 2) that is not conserved in the P. putida protein. To evaluate the enzymatic and physical properties of P. putida Lhr-Core, we produced the protein in Escherichia coli as a His10Smt3 fusion and purified it from a soluble extract by serial nickel affinity, tag removal, and gel filtration steps. Lhr-Core eluted as a monomer during gel filtration. SDS-PAGE affirmed the purity of the Lhr-Core preparation (Fig. 3A). Reaction of Lhr-Core with 1 mm [α-32P]ATP in the presence of 5 mm magnesium and 5 μm 24-mer ssDNA oligonucleotide cofactor resulted in the hydrolysis of [α-32P]ATP to [α-32P]ADP, as monitored by polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC. The extent of ATP hydrolysis increased in proportion to the amount of input Lhr-Core, and 60% of the available ATP was hydrolyzed at 1 μm enzyme (Fig. 3A). The ATPase specific activity, calculated from the slope of the titration curve in the linear range of enzyme dependence, was 2.56 nmol ATP hydrolyzed per 1 pmol Lhr-Core in 15 min, which translates into an estimated turnover number of 2.8 s−1. ATPase activity depended on addition of a divalent cation. Divalent cation cofactor specificity was assessed at 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 mm magnesium, manganese, calcium, cobalt, copper, nickel, and zinc (Fig. 3B). Magnesium and calcium were the superior cofactors, supporting vigorous ATP hydrolysis across the full range of concentrations tested. Manganese was effective at 0.5 to 2.5 mm and slightly less so at 5 and 10 mm. Cobalt and nickel functioned best at 0.5 and 1 mm and became progressively less active at 2.5, 5, and 10 mm. Zinc supported activity narrowly at 0.5 to 1 mm but was ineffective at a concentration of 2.5 mm or higher. By contrast, copper was ineffective at 0.5 and 1 mm but supported activity at 5 and 10 mm. All subsequent assays of Lhr-Core activity employed magnesium as the metal cofactor. Nucleotide specificity was examined by colorimetric assay of the release of Pi from unlabeled ribonucleotides ATP, GTP, CTP, or UTP and the deoxynucleotides dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP, each at 1 mm concentration. Lhr-Core specifically hydrolyzed ATP and dATP; the other rNTPs and dNTPs were hydrolyzed poorly or not at all (Fig. 3C). We determined steady-state kinetic parameters by measuring the velocity of ATP hydrolysis as a function of ATP concentration in the presence of 5 mm magnesium and 5 μm 24-mer ssDNA cofactor (Fig. 3D). From a nonlinear regression curve fit of the data to the Michaelis–Menten equation, we calculated that Lhr-Core has a Km of 0.37 ± 0.038 mm ATP and a kcat of 3.33 ± 0.12 s−1. We tested the ability of ssDNAs of varying length to activate ATP hydrolysis by Lhr-Core. Titration of the oligonucleotides revealed a hyperbolic dependence of ATP hydrolysis on the amount of 24-mer, 18-mer, or 12-mer strands with similar extents of hydrolysis at saturating DNA concentrations (Fig. 4). Nonlinear regression fitting of the data to a one-site binding model in Prism yielded apparent Kd values as follows: 44 nm 24-mer, 65 nm 18-mer, and 113 nm 12-mer. Shortening the DNA cofactor to a 6-mer caused a marked shift to the right in the titration curve, with an apparent Kd value of 725 nm 6-mer. NTP hydrolysis by nucleic acid–dependent NTP phosphohydrolases is often coupled to mechanical work, either duplex unwinding or displacement of protein–nucleic acid complexes, as a consequence of translocation of the phosphohydrolase enzyme along the nucleic acid. To address whether Lhr-Core has translocase activity, we employed a streptavidin (SA) displacement assay (1Ordonez H. Shuman S.

The translocation assay scores the motor-dependent displacement of SA from DNA in the presence of ATP and excess free biotin, which instantly binds to free SA and precludes SA rebinding to the labeled DNA. The rationale of the assay is that directional tracking of the motor along the DNA single strand will displace SA from one DNA end but not the other. As depicted in Fig. 5A, the enzyme acts as a “cow catcher” on a locomotive engine. When moving 3′ to 5′, it can displace SA as it collides with the 5′ biotin–SA. In contrast, a 3′ biotin–SA complex is not expected to be displaced by a 3′-to-5′ translocase because the motor moves away from the SA and simply falls off the free 5′ end. The converse outcomes apply to a 5′-to-3′ translocase, whereby it displaces a 3′ biotin–SA complex but not a 5′ biotin–SA adduct. The instructive finding was that Lhr-Core displaced the SA from a 5′ biotin–SA complex on the 34-mer ssDNA to yield the free 32P-labeled 34-mer strand but was unable to displace SA from the 3′ biotin–SA complex tested in parallel. Stripping of the 5′ biotin–SA complex by Lhr-Core to liberate free DNA depended on ATP and magnesium (Fig. 5A). Enzyme titration experiments with 0.1 μm 5′ biotinylated 34-mer substrate in the presence of 1 mm ATP and 5 mm magnesium revealed that the extent of SA displacement was proportional to the amount of input enzyme and that 90% of the biotin–SA complex was dissociated at saturating enzyme. In the linear range of enzyme dependence, Lhr-Core displaced 0.99 ± 0.05 pmol of 5′ biotin-SA per 1 pmol of Lhr-Core (Fig. 5B). The kinetic profile of SA displacement by 0.5 μm Lhr-Core during a 10-min reaction with 0.1 μm of 5′ biotinylated substrate is shown in Fig. 5C. The data fit well by nonlinear regression to a two-phase association with apparent rates constants of 3.35 ± 0.87 min−1 (percent fast 53 ± 11) and 0.49 ± 0.17 min−1 (Fig. 5C). In light of the translocase activity demonstrated above, we tested Lhr-Core for helicase activity with a series of 3′-tailed duplex substrates consisting of a 24-bp duplex with a 15-mer 3′ single-strand tail to serve as a loading strand (Fig. 6). The 39-mer loading/tracking strand was a synthetic DNA or RNA oligonucleotide of identical nucleobase sequence (excepting U for T in RNA). The 5′ 32P-labeled 24-mer displaced strand was a DNA or RNA oligonucleotide of identical nucleobase sequence complementary to that of the 39-mer strand. The helicase assay format entailed preincubation of Lhr-Core and labeled nucleic acid substrate, followed by initiation of unwinding by addition of ATP, with simultaneous addition of a “trap” of excess unlabeled 24-mer displaced strand. The trap strand minimizes reannealing of any radiolabeled 24-mer that was unwound by Lhr-Core, and it competes with the loading strand for binding to any free Lhr-Core or Lhr-Core that dissociated from the labeled 3′-tailed duplex without unwinding it. Consequently, the assay predominantly gauges a single round of strand displacement by Lhr-Core bound to the labeled 3′-tailed duplex prior to the onset of ATP hydrolysis. The salient findings from the assay were as follows. Lhr-Core unwound 3′-tailed RNA–DNA and DNA–DNA substrates to yield a radiolabeled free single-strand RNA and DNA, respectively, that migrated faster than the input tailed duplex during native PAGE and comigrated with free 24-mer generated by thermal denaturation of the substrates (Fig. 6, lanes Δ). Lhr-Core failed to unwind an RNA–RNA duplex, and Lhr-Core did not unwind a DNA–RNA hybrid with a 39-mer RNA loading strand (Fig. 6). These results establish that Lhr-Core is a unidirectional motor, powered by ATP hydrolysis, that tracks 3′ to 5′ along a DNA loading strand and unwinds duplexes en route. P. putida gene PP_1102 encodes a 216-aa protein (Fig. 7, top panel) that is a member of the binuclear MPE enzyme superfamily. MPE enzymes characteristically utilize a binuclear transition metal ion center to catalyze phosphomonoester or phosphodiester hydrolysis (7Matange N. Podobnik M. Visweswariah S.S.

The modeled active site of P. putida MPE is shown in Fig. 7, bottom panel, with two manganese ions (superimposed from the M. jannaschii Mre11 structure) coordinated by conserved MPE side chains Asp-33, His-35, Asp-78, Asn-112, His-113, His-142, His-156, and His-158. MPE His-113 is predicted to interact with the scissile phosphate of the substrate. These eight active site residues are highlighted in green shading in the amino acid sequence in Fig. 7. To gain insight into the catalytic activities of P. putida MPE, we produced the protein in E. coli as a His10Smt3 fusion and purified it from a soluble extract by serial nickel affinity, tag removal, and gel filtration steps. MPE eluted as a monomer during gel filtration. The protein was tested for its ability to hydrolyze the generic non-nucleotide phosphoester substrates p-nitrophenyl phosphate (a phosphomonoester) and bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate (a phosphodiester). Hydrolysis of these compounds liberates a chromogenic product, p-nitrophenol, that is easily quantified by its absorbance at 410 nm. MPE readily converted 10 mm bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate into p-nitrophenol in the presence of a divalent cation. When various metals were tested at 2 mm concentration, the divalent cation requirement for bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolysis was satisfied best by manganese (Fig. 8A). Cobalt and cadmium were 69% and 50% as effective as manganese; nickel was 6% as effective. Other divalent cations added at the same concentration (calcium, magnesium, copper, and zinc) were ineffective. No p-nitrophenol release was detected when 1 μg of MPE was reacted with 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate and any of the divalent metals tested. We conclude that MPE is a manganese-dependent phosphodiesterase. The extent of hydrolysis of 10 mm bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate during a 30-min reaction with MPE in the presence of 2 mm manganese was proportional to the amount of input enzyme (Fig. 8B). The amount of product formed by 1 μg of MPE in 30 min represented hydrolysis of 87% of the input bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate. From the slope of the titration curve in the linear range of enzyme dependence, we calculated that 46.2 ± 1.6 nmol of bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate were hydrolyzed per 1 pmol of MPE during a 30-min reaction. The kinetic profiles of p-nitrophenol release by 3.125, 6.25, and 25 pmol MPE during a 30-min reaction with 10 mm bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate revealed that the rates and extents of product formation were proportional to the input enzyme (Fig. 8C). Formation of p-nitrophenol by MPE displayed a hyperbolic dependence on the concentration of bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Fig. 8D). From a nonlinear regression fit of the data to the Michaelis–Menten equation, we calculated a Km of 4.85 mm and a kcat of 212 s−1. To further query the substrate specificity of MPE, we assayed the enzyme for activity with p-nitrophenyl-5′-thymidylate (pNP-TMP), a phosphodiesterase-nuclease substrate (Fig. 9). MPE catalyzed the hydrolysis of 10 mm pNP-TMP to yield p-nitrophenol. pNP-TMP hydrolysis was even more strictly dependent on manganese compared with bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolysis under the same experimental conditions. Other divalent metals added at the same concentration were largely ineffective as cofactors for pNP-TMP hydrolysis, with cadmium, cobalt, and nickel supporting 4–10% the level of activity seen with manganese (Fig. 8A). We determined steady-state kinetic parameters for Mn2+-dependent hydrolysis of pNP-TMP as a function of pNP-TMP concentration. From a nonlinear regression fit of the data to the Michaelis–Menten equation, we calculated a Km of 11.3 mm and a kcat of 34 s−1. These results indicate that MPE has vigorous phosphodiesterase activity and does not hydrolyze phosphomonoesters. In light of the predicted homology of P. putida MPE to Mre11 and its ability of hydrolyze p-nitrophenyl-5′-thymidylate to p-nitrophenol and TMP (Fig. 9), we tested MPE for deoxynuclease activity by reacting the protein with pUC19 plasmid DNA in the presence of 2 mm manganese. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were withdrawn at 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 45 min and analyzed by native agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of ethidium bromide to stain the DNA (Fig. 10A). The input pUC19 DNA substrate comprised a mixture of closed circle (the major species), nicked circle, and dimer circle forms (Fig. 10A, time 0). Reaction with MPE converted the closed-circle DNA into nicked-circle DNA within 1 to 2 min, and the nicked-circle DNA was in turn converted to 2.7-kb linear DNA between 2 and 10 min (Fig. 10A). Between 5 and 45 min, the linear DNAs were progressively shortened (Fig. 10A). The order of events in the time course of the MPE reaction with pUC19 was echoed when we analyzed the products of a 30-min reaction at varying levels of input MPE (Fig. 10B). At limiting MPE (0.5 μg), the closed-circle DNA was converted to nicked-circle DNA. Increasing MPE to 1 and 2 μg prompted the appearance of linear DNA, and a further increase to 4 μg MPE resulted in digestion to DNA fragments of less than 1 kb (Fig. 10B). No digestion of the pUC19 DNA substrate was observed when 2 mm magnesium was added as the divalent cation (Fig. 10B). We conclude that P. putida MPE is a manganese-dependent DNA endonuclease. To check that the observed phosphodiesterase and nuclease activities are inherent to P. putida MPE, we produced and purified a mutated version of MPE in which the putative active site residue Asp-78 (Fig. 7) was changed to alanine. SDS-PAGE showed comparable purity of the WT and D78A proteins (Fig. 11A). The D78A mutation reduced manganese-dependent bis-p-nitrophenylphosphatase activity to 6% of the WT (Fig. 11B) and similarly attenuated the DNA endonuclease activity (Fig. 11C).

SOD activity is a marker that can be used to comprehensively evaluate the enzymatic capacities of SOD1, SOD2, and SOD3; however, the trend of SOD activity in end-stage osteoarthritic tissues remains unknown. In the present study, we found that SOD activity in end-stage osteoarthritic synovium of the knee was significantly lower than that in control synovium without the influence of age. The SOD activity was significantly lower in the end-stage knee osteoarthritic cartilage than in the control, but a weak negative correlation was observed between aging and SOD activity. However, SOD activity in end-stage hip osteoarthritic cartilage was significantly lower than that in control cartilage without the influence of aging. The relationship between osteoarthritis and SOD activity was stronger than the relationship between aging and SOD activity. These results indicate that direct regulation of SOD activity in joint tissues may lead to suppression of osteoarthritis progression."

The intervention was based on theoretical implications from the field of second language acquisition and evidence for positive effects of physical activity on cognitive outcomes (e.g. language acquisition). The aim of this study was to analyze short term effects on second language acquisition. Methods Sixty-one young refugees were included in the study (age: 8.5 ± 1.4 years). The intervention group participated in language-enriched PE lessons based on an elaborated approach to second language learning acquisition. The control group did not receive any treatment. Both groups were pre-and post-tested in domain specific vocabulary, listening comprehension and use of local prepositions within the context of primary PE games. Results Results from linear mixed-effect modelling suggest that the intervention group significantly improved domain specific vocabulary and listening comprehension in comparison to the control group. Conclusions The intervention was successful since the PE lessons contributed to the second language acquisition of young refugees. Therefore, this learning approach might also be useful for physical activity based second language learning activities in other PE contexts for early second language learners in primary school."
https://openalex.org/W2890351375,"Background Tooth loss has been reported to be associated with the risk of liver cancer in several prior studies in economically advantaged countries. Whether this relationship is also evident in economically disadvantaged populations is not known. Methods We analyzed data from the Nutrition Intervention Trials, two randomized placebo-controlled trials of vitamin/mineral supplementation in Linxian, China. Participants who reported having lost permanent teeth were examined to determine the number of teeth remaining. In the 30-year follow-up period, 329 liver cancers were diagnosed and 368 chronic liver disease deaths occurred. Tooth loss was categorized based on loess smoothed age-specific predicted quartiles. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the two outcomes. Results Overall, persons in the highest quartile of age-specific tooth loss had an increased risk of liver cancer (HR = 1.27, 95%CI: 0.96, 1.67) which was not statistically significant. Results varied by sex and body mass index (BMI), however. Women in the highest quartile of age-specific tooth loss had a significantly increased risk (HR = 1.64, 95%CI: 1.04, 2.59), while men did not (HR = 1.08, 95%CI = 0.75, 1.57), and persons with a BMI > 23.0 kg/m2 (HR = 1.71, 95%CI: 1.00, 2.92) had a significantly increased risk, while persons with a BMI <23.0 kg/m2 did not (HR = 1.14, 95%CI: 0.82, 1.5). No relationships with chronic liver disease mortality were observed. Conclusions In a rural, economically disadvantaged population, persons with the highest levels of age-specific tooth loss had an increased risk of liver cancer. The results, which were stronger among women and persons with greater BMI, suggest that periodontal disease may increase risk of liver cancer."

The increasing numbers of geese are causing problems in tourism and agriculture. The number of resident greylag geese visiting the Altmuehlsee lake, a recreational area in the south of Germany, has also increased, especially in June and July. However, the geese leave the lake again at the beginning of August. 30 adult greylag geese were banded with telemetry transmitters during molting at the Altmuehlsee lake to determine when the geese leave the lake in August and what structures they need in their winter habitat. The distances the greylag geese flew from their resting sites to foraging sites were calculated, as well as the size of their home ranges and the proportions of each habitat type in the home range. It was found that the greylag geese used small home ranges while rearing their young, and fed close to the water. After molting, the size of their home ranges increased. They fed on fields and meadows around the lake. In the winter habitat, the geese also had a small home range, and they preferred eating grain and corn and the availability of an open body of water. In addition, one group of geese remained in the city of Munich during the winter, benefiting from supplementary food from people. This information helps us to understand the different requirements of resident greylag geese. It can be used to inform management decisions aimed at preventing agricultural damage.

The analyses on the tribological performance of ring/liner system under the CDA mainly focus on the ideal circular cylinder liner and fixed fully flooded lubrication condition. In this study, a numerical investigation on the tribological performance of a compression ring-cylinder liner system is presented under the CDA with consideration of the cylinder liner deformation and the transition between the fully flooded and starved lubrication conditions. A mixed lubrication model coupled with oil transport model and JFO (Jacobson-Floberg-Olsson) conservative cavitation algorithm is proposed to evaluate the frictional properties. Based on the model, the tribological performance is investigated under the standard operation condition and the CDA. Meanwhile, the influence of cylinder liner deformation and oil supply on the tribological performance is also evaluated. Results show that the tribological performance of the compression ring-cylinder liner system is greatly changed when the CDA is adopted. In particular, under the CDA, the overall power loss and FMEP (friction mean effective pressure) value are increased about 27.29% and 53.51%. The study also demonstrates the necessity to consider the cylinder liner deformation and oil supply in the simulation of compression ring-cylinder liner system under the CDA."
https://openalex.org/W2892045502,"Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the first retrovirus that has conclusively been shown to cause human diseases. In HIV-1, specific interactions between the nucleocapsid (NC) domain of the Gag protein and genomic RNA (gRNA) mediate gRNA dimerization and selective packaging; however, the mechanism for gRNA packaging in HTLV-1, a deltaretrovirus, is unclear. In other deltaretroviruses, the matrix (MA) and NC domains of Gag are both involved in gRNA packaging, but MA binds nucleic acids with higher affinity and has more robust chaperone activity, suggesting that this domain may play a primary role. Here, we show that the MA domain of HTLV-1, but not the NC domain, binds short hairpin RNAs derived from the putative gRNA packaging signal. RNA probing of the HTLV-1 5′ leader and cross-linking studies revealed that the primer-binding site and a region within the putative packaging signal form stable hairpins that interact with MA. In addition to a previously identified palindromic dimerization initiation site (DIS), we identified a new DIS in HTLV-1 gRNA and found that both palindromic sequences bind specifically the NC domain. Surprisingly, a mutant partially defective in dimer formation in vitro exhibited a significant increase in RNA packaging into HTLV-1–like particles, suggesting that efficient RNA dimerization may not be strictly required for RNA packaging in HTLV-1. Moreover, the lifecycle of HTLV-1 and other deltaretroviruses may be characterized by NC and MA functions that are distinct from those of the corresponding HIV-1 proteins, but together provide the functions required for viral replication."

However, little is known about the transmission dynamics of PTB among students and members of the communities surrounding university campuses in Eastern Ethiopia.A cross sectional study was conducted in Eastern Ethiopia among prevalent culture-confirmed PTB cases from university students (n = 36) and community members diagnosed at one of four hospitals (n = 152) serving the surrounding area. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) was performed on Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) isolates using BD Bactec MGIT 960 and molecular genotyping was performed using spoligotyping and 24-loci MIRU-VNTR. MTBC strains with Identical genotyping patterns were assigned to molecular clusters as surrogate marker for recent transmission and further contact tracing was initiated among clustered patients.Among all study participants, four MTBC lineages and 11 sub-lineages were identified, with Ethiopia_3 (Euro-American lineage) being most common sub-lineage (29.4%) in both cohorts and associated with strain clustering (P = 0.016). We further identified 13 (8.1%) strains phylogenetically closely related to Ethiopia_3 but with a distinct Spoligotyping pattern and designated as Ethiopia_4. The clustering rate of MTBC strains was 52.9% for university students and 66.7% for community members with a Recent Transmission Index (RTI) of 17.6% and 48.4%, respectively. Female gender, urban residence, and new TB cases were significantly associated with strain clustering (P<0.05). Forty-eight (30%) of the study participants were resistant to one or more first line anti TB drugs, three patients were classified as multidrug resistant (MDR).We found evidence for recent transmission of PTB among Ethiopian university students and the local community in Eastern Ethiopia, mainly linked to strains classified as Ethiopia_3 sub lineage. Drug resistance didn't have a major impact on recent transmission but comprehensive molecular surveillance in combination with drug resistance profiling of MTBC strains is desirable to better characterize TB transmission dynamics in high risk congregate living environments such as university campuses and guide regional TB control programs."

https://openalex.org/W2890207367,"The protein von Willebrand factor (VWF) is key for the adhesion of blood platelets to sites of vascular injury. Recent studies have shown that the release of oxidative agents during inflammation increases the platelet-tethering activity of VWF contributing to a pro-thrombotic state. This has been linked to the oxidation of methionine residues in the A1, A2 and A3 domains of VWF. The A1 domain binds to platelet surface receptors glycoprotein Ib α (GpIbα). This interaction has been shown to be inhibited under static conditions by the neighboring A2 domain. Tensile force exerted by blood flow unfolds the A2 domain normally leading to its cleavage by the metalloprotease ADAMTS13 preventing pathological thrombus formation. However, oxidizing conditions inhibit proteolysis through ADAMTS13. Here, molecular dynamics simulations tested the hypothesis whether methionine oxidation induced by inflammatory conditions favors unfolding of the A2 domain contributing to the experimentally observed activation of VWF. The results indicate that oxidation of methionine residues located near the C-terminal helix of the A2 domain reduce the force necessary to initiate unfolding. Furthermore, oxidation of methionine residues shifts the thermodynamic equilibrium of the A2 domain fold towards the denatured state. This work suggests a mechanism whereby oxidation reduces the kinetic and thermodynamic stability of the A2 domain removing its inhibitory function on the binding of the A1 domain to GpIbα."
https://openalex.org/W2890273302,"Lower extremity powered exoskeletons (LEPE) are an emerging technology that assists people with lower-limb paralysis. LEPE for people with complete spinal cord injury walk at very slow speeds, below 0.5m/s.

Speed dependent kinetic and kinematic regression equations in the literature could be used for very slow walking LEPE trajectory scaling; however, kinematic and kinetic information at walking speeds below 0.5 m/s is lacking. Scaling LEPE trajectories using current reference equations may be inaccurate because these equations were produced from faster than real-world LEPE walking speeds. An improved understanding of how able-bodied people biomechanically adapt to very slow walking will provide LEPE developers with more accurate models to predict and scale LEPE gait trajectories.

Kinematic and kinetic data were collected for 0.2 m/s—0.8 m/s, and self-selected walking speed. Thirty-three common sagittal kinematic and kinetic gait parameters were identified from motion capture data and inverse dynamics. Gait parameter relationships to walking speed, cadence, and stride length were determined with linear and quadratic (second and third order) regression. For parameters with a non-linear relationship with speed, cadence, or stride-length, linear regressions were used to determine if a consistent inflection occurred for faster and slower walking speeds. Group mean equations were applied to each participant’s data to determine the best performing equations for calculating important peak sagittal kinematic and kinetic gait parameters. Quadratic models based on walking speed had the strongest correlations with sagittal kinematic and kinetic gait parameters, with kinetic parameters having the better results. The lack of a consistent inflection point indicated that the kinematic and kinetic gait strategies did not change at very slow gait speeds. This research showed stronger associations with speed and gait parameters then previous studies, and provided more accurate regression equations for gait parameters at very slow walking speeds that can be used for LEPE joint trajectory development."

A new study reveals that an unlikely protein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), is a heme chaperone that binds and transfers labile heme to downstream target proteins. These results provide a new framework for understanding heme homeostasis and raise intriguing questions regarding the intersection of heme transport, carbohydrate metabolism, and intracellular signaling.

Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is a chaperone that allocates labile heme in cellsJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 293Issue 37PreviewCellular heme is thought to be distributed between a pool of sequestered heme that is tightly bound within hemeproteins and a labile heme pool required for signaling and transfer into proteins. A heme chaperone that can hold and allocate labile heme within cells has long been proposed but never been identified. Here, we show that the glycolytic protein glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) fulfills this role by acting as an essential repository and allocator of bioavailable heme to downstream protein targets.

https://openalex.org/W2890393871,"Cumulative estrogen concentration is an important determinant of the risk of developing breast cancer. Estrogen carcinogenesis is attributed to the combination of receptor-driven mitogenesis and DNA damage induced by quinonoid metabolites of estrogen. The present study was focused on developing an improved breast cancer prediction model using estrogen quinone-protein adduct concentrations. Blood samples from 152 breast cancer patients and 71 healthy women were collected, and albumin (Alb) and hemoglobin (Hb) adducts of estrogen-3,4-quinone and estrogen-2,3-quinone were extracted and evaluated as potential biomarkers of breast cancer. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) was used as the predictor model and the resultant prediction of breast cancer was more accurate than other existing detection methods. A MLP using the logarithm of the concentrations of the estrogen quinone-derived adducts (four input nodes, 10 hidden nodes, and one output node) was used to predict breast cancer risk with accuracy close to 100% and area under curve (AUC) close to one. The AUC value of one showed that both data sets were separable. We conclude that Alb and Hb adducts of estrogen quinones are promising biomarkers for the early detection of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2890694171,"Objectives We investigated whether chronological changes in portal flow and clinical factors play a role in the liver regeneration (LR) process after right donor-hepatectomy. Materials and methods Participants in this prospective study comprised 58 donors who underwent right donor-hepatectomy during the period February 2014 to February 2015 at a single medical institution. LR was estimated using two equations: remnant left liver (RLL) growth (%) and liver volumetric recovery (LVR) (%). Donors were classified into an excellent regeneration (ER) group or a moderate regeneration (MR) group based on how their LR on postoperative day 7 compared to the median value. Results Multivariate analysis revealed that low residual liver volume (OR = .569, 95% CI: .367– .882) and high portal venous velocity in the immediate postoperative period (OR = 1.220, 95% CI: 1.001–1.488) were significant predictors of LR using the RLL growth equation; high portal venous velocity in the immediate postoperative period (OR = 1.325, 95% CI: 1.081–1.622) was a significant predictor of LR using the LVR equation. Based on the two equations, long-term LR was significantly greater in the ER group than in the MR group (p < .001). Conclusion Portal venous velocity in the immediate postoperative period was an important factor in LR. The critical time for short-term LR is postoperative day 7; it is associated with long-term LR in donor-hepatectomy."
https://openalex.org/W2891970241,"Introduction Link4Health, a cluster-RCT, demonstrated the effectiveness of a combination strategy targeting barriers at various HIV continuum steps on linkage to and retention in care; showing effectiveness in achieving linkage to HIV care within 1 month plus retention in care at 12 months after HIV testing for people living with HIV (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.19–1.96, p = 0.002). In addition to standard of care, Link4Health included: 1) Point-of-care CD4+ count testing; 2) Accelerated ART initiation; 3) Mobile phone appointment reminders; 4) Care and prevention package including commodities and informational materials; and 5) Non-cash financial incentive. Our objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a scale-up of the Link4Health strategy in Swaziland. Methods and findings We incorporated the effects and costs of the Link4Health strategy into a computer simulation of the HIV epidemic in Swaziland, comparing a scenario where the strategy was scaled up to a scenario with no implementation. The simulation combined a deterministic compartmental model of HIV transmission with a stochastic microsimulation of HIV progression calibrated to Swaziland epidemiological data. It incorporated downstream health costs potentially saved and infections potentially prevented by improved linkage and treatment adherence. We assessed the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of Link4Health compared to standard care from a health sector perspective reported in US$2015, a time horizon of 20 years, and a discount rate of 3% in accordance with WHO guidelines.[1] Our results suggest that scale-up of the Link4Health strategy would reduce new HIV infections over 20 years by 11,059 infections, a 7% reduction from the projected 169,019 cases and prevent 5,313 deaths, an 11% reduction from the projected 49,582 deaths. Link4Health resulted in an incremental cost per infection prevented of $13,310 and an incremental cost per QALY gained of $3,560/QALY from the health sector perspective. Conclusions Using a threshold of <3 x per capita GDP, the Link4Health strategy is likely to be a cost-effective strategy for responding to the HIV epidemic in Swaziland."
https://openalex.org/W2892123851,"Purpose Chronic disease is often associated with a reduced energy level, which limits the capacity to work full-time. This study aims to investigate whether the construct work endurance is part of disability assessment in European countries and what assessment procedures are used. We defined work endurance as the ability to sustain working activities for a number of hours per day and per week. Materials and methods We conducted a survey using two self-constructed questionnaires. We addressed 35 experts from 19 countries through the European Union of Medicine in Assurance and Social Security (EUMASS). We gathered descriptive data on various aspects of (the assessment of) work endurance. Results Experts from 16 countries responded. In most countries work endurance is assessed. We found few professional guidelines specific for the assessment of work endurance. Both somatic and mental diseases may cause limited work endurance. Methods to assess work endurance vary, objective methods rating as most suitable. Almost half of the countries report controversies on the assessment of work endurance. Conclusions Work endurance is recognised and assessed as an aspect of work disability assessment in Europe. However, controversies exist and evidence based guidelines, including reliable and valid methods to assess work endurance, are lacking."
https://openalex.org/W2891362501,"An in vitro method based on 15N-labelled forage nitrogen (N) was developed to study ruminal N metabolism of soluble N (SN), insoluble N (ISN) and neutral detergent insoluble N (NDIN) fractions of timothy forage. Timothy grass was grown on replicated experimental plots with one plot receiving 15N-labelled and the other unlabelled N fertilizer. Harvested grass was preserved as dried grass or as formic acid treated or untreated silage. The intact forages and their corresponding N fractions were incubated in buffered rumen fluid in vitro to determine degradation parameters based on the 15N fluxes between labelled feed N and ammonia N pools. A high percentage (25-38%) of 15N-labelled ammonia disappeared from ammonia N pool during the first 15 min of incubation. Microbial uptake of dried grass SN fraction was higher than of silage SN fractions. Fractional degradation rates of SN from formic acid treated silage, untreated silage and dried grass during the first 6 hours of incubation were 0.145, 0.125 and 0.115 /h, respectively. By the end of the incubation period (28 h), 69, 66 and 43%, of the SN fraction of formic acid treated silage, untreated silage and dried grass, respectively were recovered as ammonia. The percentage of ISN fractions degraded to ammonia N were 9, 34 and 27%, respectively. Based on the changes in 15N-labelled ammonia N pool in blank incubation and appearance of 15N to ammonia N pool from 15N-labelled NDIN fractions, it was estimated that a significant portion of microbial lysis occurred when incubations were carried out for longer than 20 hours. With dried grass the contribution of ammonia N for microbial N synthesis was greater than with silages. Use of 15N-labelled forages together with this in vitro method is a promising technique for determining soluble N degradation parameters, but it requires further development to be used for determining degradation parameters of insoluble N fractions and work with whole feeds."
https://openalex.org/W2890406032,"The world's annual output of rabbits is over 1.2 billion, therefore this sector is also one of the sources of greenhouse gases in livestock production. One hundred-twenty New Zealand rabbits were allocated into four treatments, five replicates in each treatment and six rabbits in each replicate to examine the effect of grinding alfalfa hay to different sizes on growth performance, methane production and cecal archaeal populations. The particle sizes of the alfalfa meal in the four treatment diets were 2500, 1000, 100 and 10 μm, while the other ingredients were ground through a 2.5 mm sieve. The average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) increased (P<0.001) as the particle size decreased, but the feed conversion ratio (FCR) was not affected (P = 0.305). The digestibility of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) (P = 0.006) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) (P<0.006) increased while the greatest digestibility of crude protein (CP) was obtained in 1000 um group (P = 0.015). The rabbits produced more methane (CH4, L/kgBM0.75/d) with decreasing alfalfa particle size (P<0.001). The molar proportion of acetic acid and propionic acid decreased (P<0.001) at the cost of butyric acid (P<0.001). The greatest villus height:crypt depth ratio were obtained in 1000 μm group, and the decrease in the alfalfa hay particle size decreased the jejunum and ilem villus height:crypt depth ratio (P<0.05). The gastric muscular and mucosal thickness decreased with decreasing alfalfa particle size (P<0.05). Archaea diversity decreased with decreasing alfalfa particle size, and the relative abundance of genus Methanobrevibacter increased (P<0.001) while the genus Methanosphaera decreased (P<0.001). It is concluded that a finer particle size favors the growth of genus Methanobrevibacter, which produces more methane but promotes the growth performance of rabbits."
https://openalex.org/W3123957307,"In a competitive model where agents are subject to endogenous trading constraints, we make the access to financial trade dependent on prices and consumption decisions. Our framework is compatible with the existence of both credit market segmentation and market exclusion. In this context, we show equilibrium existence in two scenarios. In the first one, individuals can fully hedge the payments of segmented financial contracts by trading unsegmented assets. In the second one, it is assumed that agents may compensate with increments in present demand the losses of well-being generated by reductions of future consumption."
