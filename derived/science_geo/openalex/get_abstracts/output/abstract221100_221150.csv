https://openalex.org/W2088658333,"Mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I and III have been shown to produce superoxide but the exact contribution and localization of individual sites have remained unclear. We approached this question investigating the effects of oxygen, substrates, inhibitors, and of the NAD+/NADH redox couple on H2O2 and superoxide production of isolated mitochondria from rat and human brain. Although rat brain mitochondria in the presence of glutamate+malate alone do generate only small amounts of H2O2 (0.04 ± 0.02 nmol H2O2/min/mg), a substantial production is observed after the addition of the complex I inhibitor rotenone (0.68 ± 0.25 nmol H2O2/min/mg) or in the presence of the respiratory substrate succinate alone (0.80 ± 0.27 nmol H2O2/min/mg). The maximal rate of H2O2 generation by respiratory chain complex III observed in the presence of antimycin A was considerably lower (0.14 ± 0.07 nmol H2O2/min/mg). Similar observations were made for mitochondria isolated from human parahippocampal gyrus. This is an indication that most of the superoxide radicals are produced at complex I and that high rates of production of reactive oxygen species are features of respiratory chain-inhibited mitochondria and of reversed electron flow, respectively. We determined the redox potential of the superoxide production site at complex I to be equal to –295 mV. This and the sensitivity to inhibitors suggest that the site of superoxide generation at complex I is most likely the flavine mononucleotide moiety. Because short-term incubation of rat brain mitochondria with H2O2 induced increased H2O2 production at this site we propose that reactive oxygen species can activate a self-accelerating vicious cycle causing mitochondrial damage and neuronal cell death.

Superoxide anion, a product of one-electron reduction of oxygen, is the by-product of normal functioning of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (1Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (4829) Google Scholar). It has been reported, that this radical is generated by complexes I and III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and readily converted to H2O2 by mitochondrial Mn-superoxide dismutase (2Boveris A.

There is substantial evidence that superoxide and H2O2 contribute to the pathogenesis of certain neurodegenerative diseases (7Halliwell B. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1609-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2658) Google Scholar, 8Beal M.F. Howell N. Bodis-Wollner I. Mitochondria and Free Radicals in Neurodegenerative Disease. Wiley-Liss, New York1997Google Scholar). However, there is considerable disagreement in recent literature concerning generated amounts and sites of superoxide production by isolated mitochondria. In contrast to the well documented production of superoxide at center “o” of antimycin A-inhibited complex III (2Boveris A. Cadenas E. Stoppani A.O.M. Biochem.

Although certain investigators (11Genova M.L. Ventura B. Giuliano G. Bovina C. Formiggini G. Castelli G.P. Lenaz G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 12Kushnareva Y. Murphy A.N. Andreyev A. Biochem.

Neurochem. 2002; 80: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar) proposed flavine mononucleotide (FMN) to be the producer of superoxide being responsible for the H2O2 generation by brain mitochondria. In addition, there are substantial controversies regarding the exact amounts of ROS production at the different sites of respiratory chain. Although some reports document the highest rates of H2O2 production at a site at respiratory chain complex I (5Votyakova T.V. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 12Kushnareva Y. Murphy A.N. Andreyev A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) others point to complex III as the main contributor (6Liu Y. Fiskum G. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 10Chen Q. Vazquez E.J. Moghaddas S. Hoppel C.L. Lesnefsky E.J. J. Biol.

Therefore, we extensively characterized ROS production at the different generation sites in respect to oxygen consumption of well coupled isolated rat and human brain mitochondria. Our results indicate that most of the superoxide radicals are produced at complex I and that a high production of reactive oxygen species is a feature of respiratory chain-inhibited mitochondria and of reversed electron flow, respectively. Because the redox potential of the superoxide production at complex I was determined to be –295 mV, this suggests that the generation site is most likely the FMN moiety. Moreover, short-term incubation of rat brain mitochondria with H2O2 in the lower mm range was observed to induce increased H2O2 production at this site, creating a self-accelerating vicious cycle. This mechanism is proposed to be important in brain pathology associated with mitochondrial damage and neuronal cell death. reactive oxygen species flavine mononucleotide reduced glutathione p-chloromercuriobenzoate respiratory control ratio. Materials—Isocitrate dehydrogenase was purchased from Boehringer (Mannhein, Germany); l-adrenaline and bacterial protease (nagarse) from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland); superoxide dismutase and digitonin from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany); and monochlorobimane from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Solutions—Solutions include the following: MSE solution (225 mm mannitol, 75 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES, 1 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.4); MSE-nagarse solution (0.05% nagarse in MSE solution); MSE-digitonin solution (0.02% digitonin in MSE solution); and MTP medium (10 mm KH2PO4,60mm KCl, 60 mm Tris-HCl, 110 mm mannitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Isolation of Rat Brain Mitochondria—Mitochondria from one rat brain were isolated according to the protocol described by Rosental et al. (13Rosental R.E. Hamud F. Fiskum G. Varghese P.J. Sharpe S. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1987; 7: 752-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) with small modification that allowed to obtain mitochondria with much better functional characteristics. In brief, the isolation protocol was the following. Before mitochondrial isolation all solutions were cooled down until the slight appearance of ice. One Wistar rat (60–90 days old) was anesthetized by chloroform and killed by decapitation. Its brain was immediately transferred into the ice-cold MSE solution and shaken to wash out blood. Then we minced the brain, added 10 ml of ice-cold MSE-nagarse solution, and homogenized it at 600 units/s using a potter homogenizer. Thereafter, we added 20 ml of ice-cold MSE solution and centrifuged the homogenate at 2000 × g for 4 min. After centrifugation we passed the supernatant through a cheesecloth and centrifuged it at 12,000 × g for 9 min. To permeabilize synaptosomes we dissolved the resulting pellet with 10 ml of ice-cold MSE-digitonin solution, transferred the solution to a small glass homogenizator, and homogenized it 8–10 times manually to obtain a homogenous suspension. Finally, we centrifuged the suspension at 12,000 × g for 11 min and dissolved the resulting pellet in about 300 μl of MSE solution to obtain about 20 mg protein/ml. Isolation of Human Brain Mitochondria—Tissue samples from human parahippocampal gyrus were obtained from 9 patients (7 female and 2 male) with therapy-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy, who underwent epileptic surgery. White matter was rapidly removed and the remaining gray matter sample (about 150–200 mg wet weight) was immediately transferred into ice-cold MSE solution. The remaining isolation procedure of mitochondria was identical to the protocol described above. All patients gave written informed consent, and the study was approved by the University of Bonn Ethical Committee. Preparation of Submitochondrial Particles—Frozen rat brain mitochondria (protein concentration of about 20 mg/ml) were thawed and sonicated three times for 15 s by the ultrasonic processor GEX-600. The further preparation was performed as described in Ref. 14Cino M. Del Maestro R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar. Respiration—The oxygen consumption of mitochondria was determined at 30 °C in MTP medium with a PC-supported Oroboros high resolution oxygraph (15Kunz W.S. Kudin A. Vielhaber S. Elger C.E. Attardi G. Villani G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27741-27745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Measurement of H2O2 Production—Mitochondrial H2O2 generation was measured by monitoring the change in fluorescence of 200 μmp-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (λex = 317 nm, λem = 414 nm) catalyzed by 20 units/ml horseradish peroxidase (6Liu Y. Fiskum G. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Different O2 concentrations were achieved by mixing argonand oxygen-saturated buffers. Oxygen concentrations were calculated from the O2 solubility in air and oxygen-saturated MSE solution at 30 °C and 101 kPa (0.23 and 1.15 mm, respectively), and from mixing ratios of the argon and oxygen-saturated solutions. Measurement of Superoxide Production—The O2·¯-dependent oxidation of 1 mm epinephrine to adrenochrome in the presence of 7800 units/ml catalase was followed spectrophotometrically at 486–575 nm with a dual wavelength spectrophotometer (Aminco DW 2000, SLM Instruments). In control experiments we monitored the change in fluorescence of p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (λex = 317 nm, λem = 414 nm) catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase (conditions of measurement as described above) in the additional presence of 22 units/ml Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase. Determination of Enzymatic Activities—Aconitase activity was measured according to Ref. 16Gardner P.R. Nguyen D.-D.H. White C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12248-12252Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar with small modifications. The mitochondrial suspension was diluted 10 times in a solution, containing 50 mm Tris-Cl and 0.6 mm MnCl2, pH 7.4, just before the activity measurement. Then mitochondria were sonicated for 15 s with the ultrasonic processor GEX-600. Aconitase activity was determined at 30 °C using a dual-wavelength spectrophotometer (Aminco DW 2000, SLM Instruments) following the absorbance change at 340–380 nm (ϵred-ox = 5.5 mm–1 cm–1). The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 5 mm sodium citrate, 0.6 mm MnCl2, 0.2 mm NADP+, 0.1 mg/ml isocitrate dehydrogenase, 0.2% laurylmaltoside, and 40–70 μg/ml of protein. The activity of citrate synthase was determined by a standard method and the activity of NADH:coenzyme Q1-reductase was measured at 340 nm-380 nm (ϵred-ox = 5.5 mm–1 cm–1); in a buffer containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, in the presence of 150 μm NADH, 100 μm coenzyme Q1, and 2 mm KCN with a dual-wavelength spectrophotometer (Aminco DW 2000, SLM Instruments) (17Wiedemann F.R. Vielhaber S. Schröder R. Elger C.E. Kunz W.S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The protein content of mitochondria was determined using a protein assay kit based on Peterson's modification of the micro-Lowry method according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Sigma). Determination of GSH Content—GSH content was determined using the method described in Ref. 18Kamencic H. Lyon A. Paterson P.G. Juurlink B.H.J. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 35-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar with small modifications. The mitochondrial suspension was dissolved in MTP medium at a final concentration of ∼0.8 mg/ml. After addition of monochlorobimane (100 μm) and glutathione S-transferase (1 units/ml) the reaction mixture was sonicated for 15 s with the ultrasonic processor GEX-600. After 30 min development of reaction the mitochondrial suspension was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 7 min. Thereafter, the fluorescence of each supernatant was measured (λex = 380 nm, λem = 470 nm) using a fluorescence reader (Spectra MAX Gemini, Molecular Devices). As standard we used GSH dissolved in MTP medium in a range of 0 to 100 μm. Statistics—All data are presented as means ± S.D. and p values smaller than 0.05 (according to two-sided t test) were considered to be statistically significant. Oxygen Dependence of H2O2 Generation by Mitochondria Isolated from Brain Tissue—Fig. 1 shows the measurement of generation of hydrogen peroxide by isolated rat brain mitochondria using the fluorescent probe p-hydroxyphenylacetate. Addition of mitochondria (BM) led to transient increase in fluorescence, which returned to a stable stationary level. The addition of the respiratory substrates glutamate+malate resulted in a low rate of fluorescence increase indicating the generation of only small amounts of hydrogen peroxide (GLU+MAL, upper trace; 1.6 pmol H2O2/min or 0.02 nmol H2O2/min/mg protein). An about 20-fold higher slope of the fluorescence trace was observed after the addition of the complex I inhibitor rotenone (ROT, upper trace; 37 pmol H2O2/min or 0.53 nmol H2O2/min/mg protein) or in the presence of the respiratory substrate succinate alone (SUCC, lower trace; 46 pmol H2O2/min or 0.66 nmol H2O2/min/mg protein). The addition of the inhibitor of bc1 complex antimycin A in the presence of succinate led to an inhibition of H2O2 production (ANTI-A, lower trace; 7.6 pmol H2O2/min or 0.11 nmol H2O2/min/mg protein). This is an indication that in rat brain mitochondria most of the superoxide radicals are produced at complex I and that a high production of reactive oxygen species is a feature of respiratory chain-inhibited mitochondria and of reversed electron flow, respectively. Because it is well documented that mitochondrial superoxide production is strongly dependent on oxygen concentration (19Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar, 20Alvarez S. Valdez L.B. Zaobornyj T. Boveris A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 771-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) we determined the oxygen concentration dependence of H2O2 production of rat brain mitochondria in the presence of the respiratory substrates glutamate+malate (Fig. 2A, filled circles), glutamate+ malate+rotenone (Fig. 2A, open circles), and succinate (Fig. 2B, filled circles). We detected hyperbolic concentration dependences from which we calculated a Km value for oxygen of 0.92 ± 0.01 mm. A similar dependence was also observed for the production of H2O2 by complex III determined in the presence of succinate+antimycin A (data not shown).Fig. 2O2 dependence of H2O2 generation by rat brain mitochondria.A and B, about 0.2 mg protein/ml in the presence of glutamate (10 mm) and malate (5 mm) (A, filled circles, dotted curve) and plus rotenone (6.7 μm) (A, open circles, solid curve) and in the presence of succinate alone (10 mm) (B). Different values of O2 saturation were obtained by mixing of MTP medium gassed with pure oxygen (100% saturation) and gassed with argon (0% saturation). The individual data points were obtained in experiments with four independent mitochondrial preparations.

As shown in Fig. 2C, this enzymatic reaction is much less rotenone sensitive (75–80% inhibition, traces 2 and 3) at 100% oxygen saturation than at 20% oxygen tension (about 90% inhibition, trace 1), indicating the existence of an oxygen-dependent NADH oxidation pathway bypassing the site of action of rotenone. Very clearly, most of the rotenone-insensitive part of the reaction at oxygen saturation can be inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium, a flavin-modifying agent with certain specificity toward FMN of complex I (trace 2), but not by the thiol reagent p-chloromercuriobenzoate, that blocks FeS-clusters at complex I (trace 3). This result is an indication that the site of superoxide production is located upstream of both the rotenone inhibition site and FeS clusters, and therefore presumably the FMN moiety. The Maximal Rates of H2O2 Generation of Mitochondria Isolated from Human and Rat Brain Tissue Depend on Specific Electron Transport Activity—A possible reason for the discrepant results reported about ROS production of isolated brain mitochondria (5Votyakova T.V. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 6Liu Y. Fiskum G. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 12Kushnareva Y. Murphy A.N. Andreyev A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) could be variable mitochondria quality. Therefore, we checked the isolated mitochondria in the present investigation with regard to basic characteristics: respiration rates in different functional states and respiratory control values. In Fig. 3, typical oxygraph traces of mitochondria isolated from rat brain (A) and human parahippocampal cortex (B) are given. Using glutamate and malate as respiratory substrates, active state respiration rates of 231 ± 40 nmol O2/min/mg protein (n = 21) at an average respiratory control ratio (RCR) = 5.4 ± 0.8 were obtained for rat brain mitochondria and 88 ± 25 nmol O2/min/mg protein (n = 9) at RCR = 3.2 ± 0.6 for mitochondria of human parahippocampal cortex, respectively. With succinate (+rotenone) as substrate we obtained active state respiration rates of 210 ± 25 nmol O2/min/mg protein (n = 13) for rat brain mitochondria and 76 ± 22 nmol O2/min/mg protein (n = 8) for mitochondria of human parahippocampal cortex. These values indicate that both brain mitochondria preparations are tightly coupled, but human parahippocampal mitochondria appear to be less pure in respect to respiratory chain activity. Comparing the maximal H2O2 production rates (cf. Table I and Fig. 4A) rat brain mitochondria (Fig. 4A, white bars) seem to produce much higher quantities of H2O2 in the presence of succinate and in the presence of glutamate+malate+rotenone than human parahippocampal mitochondria (black bars). An explanation for this phenomenon is the mentioned higher specific electron transport activity of rat brain mitochondria in respect to human parahippocampal mitochondria (Fig. 4B). Really, as shown in detail in Table I, the electron transport chain of both types of brain mitochondria produces the by-product H2O2 at approximately similar percentage per consumed O2 (with similar substrates), about 0.2% with glutamate+malate and about 1.5% with succinate.Table IMaximal rates of H2O2 generation of rat brain and human parahippocampal cortex mitochondriaRat brain mitochondriaHuman parahippocampal cortex mitochondriaResting respiration rate with glutamate+malate24.4 ± 7.69.6 ± 5.3(nmol O2/min/mg)(n = 21)(n = 9)H2O2 generation with glutamate+malate0.04 ± 0.020.03 ± 0.03(nmol H2O2/min/mg)(n = 9)(n = 8)In % of respiration rate0.19 ± 0.13%0.20 ± 0.15%H2O2 generation with glutamate+malate+rotenone0.68 ± 0.250.27 ± 0.1(nmol H2O2/min/mg)(n = 10)(n = 8)Resting respiration rate with succinate48.3 ± 7.816.7 ± 5.2(nmol O2/min/mg)(n = 16)(n = 8)H2O2 generation with succinate0.80 ± 0.270.13 ± 0.08(nmol H2O2/min/mg)(n = 10)(n = 6)In % of respiration rate1.68 ± 0.56%1.13 ± 0.47%H2O2 generation with succinate+antimycin A0.14 ± 0.070.04 ± 0.03(nmol H2O2/min/mg)(n = 6)(n = 6) Open table in a new tab Fig. 4Comparison of H2O2 production rate and maximal O2 consumption rate of rat and human brain mitochondria.A, H2O2 production rates: white bars, rat brain mitochondria (average protein concentration 0.17 mg protein/ml, n = 10); SUCC, 10 mm succinate; GLU+MAL+ROT, 10 mm glutamate + 5 mm malate + 6.7 μm rotenone; black bars, human brain mitochondria (average protein concentration 0.1 mg protein/ml, n = 8).

For this, we altered the ratio of concentration of added NADH and NAD+ and determined the rate of superoxide production using the oxidation of adrenaline to adrenochrome (Fig. 5, open circles) or the oxidation of p-hydroxyphenylacetate in the presence of peroxidase and externally added Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (Fig. 5, filled circles). With both detection methods a midpoint potential of the superoxide producing site of rat brain mitochondria equal to –295 mV was determined (5 independent experiments). The fact that this value of midpoint potential clearly differs from the values reported for FeS clusters (–370mV for N1a; –250mV for N1b and N3-N5; –100mV for N2) but evidently resembles the value reported for FMN, 2Complex I web site: www.scripps.edu/mem/biochem//CI/index.html. also points to the FMN moiety as potential site of superoxide generation. Treatment of Rat Brain Mitochondria with H2O2 Increases the Rate of H2O2 Generation by Direct Electron Flow through Complex I Creating a Vicious Cycle—Because H2O2 has been reported to accumulate in the injured brain (22Hyslop P.A. Zhang Z. Pearson D.V. Phebus L.A. Brain Res. 1995; 671: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), which has been postulated to cause further injury accompanied by neuronal cell death, we investigated in further experiments how treatment of isolated rat brain mitochondria with H2O2 would affect the generation of H2O2. In these experiments isolated brain mitochondria were incubated for 10 min with H2O2 in a concentration range of 1 to 100 mm. After removal of H2O2 by re-sedimentation of mitochondria, we determined the rates of H2O2 production in the presence of the respiratory substrates glutamate+malate (Fig. 6A, filled circles), succinate (Fig. 6A, open circles), and in the presence of glutamate+malate+ rotenone (Fig. 6B, filled circles). As shown in Fig. 6A, 10 min incubation of rat brain mitochondria with concentrations of H2O2 in the range of 1–10 mm increased the generation of H2O2 with glutamate+malate as substrates (filled circles) but decreased succinate-dependent H2O2 production (open circles). The generation of H2O2 in the presence of glutamate+malate+ rotenone (Fig. 6B, filled circles) remained in this concentration range within experimental error nearly constant. To elucidate the potential cause for the increase of H2O2 generation by direct electron flow but the inhibition of H2O2 generation by reverse electron flow we determined the maximal oxygen consumption rates of H2O2-treated mitochondria in the presence of glutamate+malate (Fig. 6C, filled circles) and succinate+ rotenone (Fig. 6C, open circles). Very clearly, small amounts of H2O2 effectively inhibited maximal respiration with the complex I-dependent substrates glutamate+malate leaving the succinate+rotenone-dependent oxidation rate nearly unaffected. The almost negligible effect of H2O2 treatment in the 1–10 mm concentration range on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation with succinate (+rotenone) as substrate is further corroborated by the observation that the respiratory control ratio of mitochondria (RCR, defined as ratio between rates in active state (respiration rate in the presence of ADP) and resting state (respiration rate in the presence of ATP)) with this particular substrate changed from 2.7 ± 0.3 (control incubation) to 2.2 ± 0.2 (at 1 mm H2O2), to 2.1 ± 0.1 (at 5 mm H2O2) and to 2.1 ± 0.3 (at 20 mm H2O2). Only the incubation of mitochondria with concentrations of H2O2 above 50 mm seriously affected the coupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation: at 50 mm H2O2 the RCR declined to 1.7 ± 0.3, at 80 mm H2O2 to 1.2 ± 0.2, and at 100 mm the RCR was equal to 1 (fully uncoupled condition, four independent experiments).Fig. 6Influence of H2O2 treatment on H2O2 production (A and B), O2 consumption in active state (C), reduced glutathione content (D), and aconitase activity (E) of rat brain mitochondria. Mitochondria (four independent preparations) were suspended at about 3.5 mg protein/ml in MTP medium and treated with the indicated concentrations of hydrogen peroxide for 10 min. Thereafter, we centrifuged the suspension at 16,000 × g for 5 min. The resulting pellet was dissolved in MSE solution. In control experiments mitochondria were treated with equal quantities of water. A, H2O2 production (0.17 mg protein/ml) in oxygen saturated MTP medium in the presence of glutamate (10 mm) and malate (5 mm) (filled circles, solid curve) and succinate (10 mm) (open circles, dashed curve). B, H2O2 production in the presence of glutamate (10 mm) and malate (5 mm) and rotenone (6.7 μm). C, O2 consumption rate (0.2 mg protein/ml) in state 3 (after addition of 250 μm ADP) in the presence of glutamate (10 mm) and malate (5 mm) (filled circles, solid curve) or succinate (10 mm) and rotenone (6.7 μm) (open circles, dashed curve). D, GSH content; E, aconitase (filled circles, left ordinate axis) and citrate synthase (open circles, right ordinate axis) activities, assay conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures”. The total GSH content (100%) of control mitochondria was determined to be 3.5 ± 1.5 nmol/mg protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Taken together, the results of our incubation experiments with H2O2 concentrations below 20 mm can be only explained assuming a selective partial block of complex I between the sites of superoxide production and the rotenone-sensitive ubiquinone reduction site. To determine possible targets of H2O2 in complex I (sulphydryl-groups, iron-sulfur clusters), we additionally determined the glutathione content (Fig. 6D) and aconitase and citrate synthase activities (Fig. 6E) in H2O2-treated rat brain mitochondria. Although the glutathione level was decreased by the short-term H2O2-treatment by about 30%, citrate synthase activity remained completely unaffected (Fig. 6E, open circles). On the other hand, aconitase activity (Fig. 6E, filled circles) was nearly completely lost after incubation of mitochondria with the lowest dose of H2O2 (1 mm). Because aconitase activity is inhibited by the oxidation of its ROS-sensitive FeS cluster (23Flint D.H. Tuminello J.F. Emptage M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22369-22376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a similar ROS-sensitive iron-sulfur cluster within complex I could be the direct target of the observed action of H2O2. In the present study we have characterized the H2O2 generation of mitochondria isolated from rat brain and human parahippocampal cortex. In accordance with several previous reports (5Votyakova T.V. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 12Kushnareva Y. Murphy A.N. Andreyev A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), but in clear contrast to others (6Liu Y. Fiskum G. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 10Chen Q. Vazquez E.J. Moghaddas S. Hoppel C.L. Lesnefsky E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36027-36031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar), we observed that the main quantity of H2O2 is produced at a site within complex I of the respiratory chain whereas only rather small quantities (10–20% of maximal H2O2 generation) are produced at the bc1 complex in the presence of antimycin A. One potential reason for the discrepant results could be the different quality of mitochondrial preparations (the specific rates of active state respiration of rat brain mitochondria with succinate as substrate reported in Ref. 6Liu Y. Fiskum G. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar are ∼10-fold lower than our rates). In accordance with previous work (19Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar, 20Alvarez S. Valdez L.B. Zaobornyj T. Boveris A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 771-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) we detected a clear oxygen dependence of H2O2 generation with the rather high Km value of 0.92 ± 0.01 mm oxygen (equal to ∼85% of maximal oxygen saturation at 30 °C) for all conditions studied. In line with these results, at 100% oxygen saturation the superoxide production of brain mitochondria leads to a diminished rotenone sensitivity of NADH/coenzyme Q1 oxidoreductase. As shown for mitochondria from rat and human brain, under resting state conditions between 0.2% (with glutamate+malate) and 1.5% (with succinate) of respiratory chain electron transport is redirected to superoxide formation. The different total H2O2 generation rates observed for isolated rat and human brain mitochondria are most likely related to the different purity of the individual mitochondrial preparations. Applying two different methods for superoxide detection we determined the redox potential of the superoxide producing site to be –295 mV. This result can explain the strict dependence of superoxide production on the functional state of mitochondria reported in previous work (5Votyakova T.V. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 6Liu Y. Fiskum G. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 12Kushnareva Y.

Chem. 2002; 277: 44784-44790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). Conditions leading to high NAD-reduction (resting succinate respiration, inhibition of complex I by rotenone) stimulate superoxide production, whereas conditions that cause rapid oxidation of NADH (active state respiration or uncoupling) lead to very low superoxide production rates. Our result seems to be in contrast to the redox potential of –360 mV given in Ref. 12Kushnareva Y. Murphy A.N. Andreyev A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar for rat heart mitochondria. But for determination of the redox potential, these authors used the β-hydroxybutyrate/acetoacetate redox couple in rat heart mitochondria, which contain only minor amounts of β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase not allowing an efficient substrate couple equilibration. The following findings point to FMN as the potential site for superoxide generation. (i) The determined redox potential of –295 mV, which is in agreement with the midpoint potential of FMN but not with that of iron sulfur clusters.2 (ii) The strong diphenyleneiodonium sensitivity (in agreement with Ref. 6Liu Y. Fiskum G. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar) and the rather low p-chloromercuriobenzoate sensitivity (in contrast to Ref. 11Genova M.L. Ventura B. Giuliano G. Bovina C. Formiggini G. Castelli G.P. Lenaz G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) of this reaction. It is therefore very likely that the semireduced form of FMN-FMNH· (in close similarity to the bound semiquinone QH· of center i of bc1 complex) is the competent one-electron donor for the one-electron reduction of oxygen to superoxide. The following experimental problems can explain the controversial quantitative data for H2O2 and superoxide production of isolated mitochondria reported so far. (i) The rates of H2O2 generation are very low at 20% oxygen saturation used in the previous reports (5Votyakova T.V. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 6Liu Y. Fiskum G. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar, 10Chen Q.

Chem. 2002; 277: 44784-44790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar), which does not allow accurate determinations. (ii) Some of the fluorescent dyes (especially Amplex Red) tend to show high endogenous fluorescence changes for which considerable corrections have to be made (see discussion in Ref. 24St-Pierre J. Buckingham J.A. Roebuck S.J. Brand M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44784-44790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). (iii) And finally, ketoacids, like pyruvate or oxoglutarate, tend to cause artificial fluorescence changes in the presence of p-hydroxyphenylacetate or Amplex Red, which can obscure accurate measurement of superoxide and H2O2 production. In the present study we therefore avoided the use of ketoacids as mitochondrial substrates and used p-hydroxyphenylacetate, which did not show considerable endogenous fluorescence changes as obtained with the more sensitive dye Amplex Red (data not shown). To obtain reliable data for maximal H2O2 and superoxide generation rates we also used oxygen saturated media. Furthermore, we were able to show that incubation of rat brain mitochondria with H2O2 can initiate a vicious cycle of H2O2 generation, which might be of importance for certain pathological conditions of the brain. In vivo, during the ischemia-reperfusion period, the rather stable membrane-permeable H2O2 can reach stationary concentrations of about 100 μm (22Hyslop P.A. Zhang Z. Pearson D.V. Phebus L.A. Brain Res. 1995; 671: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In our in vitro experiments, we applied a short-term incubation (10 min) of rat brain mitochondria with H2O2 in a concentration range of 1–10 mm, which is ∼10–100-fold higher than the maximal concentrations observed in vivo (however, the in vivo challenge of mitochondria with the lower H2O2 concentrations might be of much longer duration). We observed increased H2O2 generation by direct electron transport and diminished H2O2 generation by reversed electron flow. On the other hand, the maximal oxygen consumption of these mitochondria was normal with succinate+rotenone but inhibited with glutamate+malate to about 50%, pointing to a selective inhibition of complex I activity. The H2O2 treatment in this concentration range did not affect the mitochondrial citrate synthase activity and only small alterations of respiratory control ratios with succinate (+rotenone) were observed. These findings exclude a possible unspecific disruption of mitochondrial function by the H2O2 treatment. Furthermore, it is improbable that this complex I inhibition is related to the recently reported glutathinylation of complex I (25Taylor E.R. Hurrell F. Shannon R.J. Lin T.-K. Hirst J. Murphy M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19603-19610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), because under our conditions, the GSH levels were decreased only by about 30%. However, aconitase, which harbors a highly ROS-sensitive FeS cluster (23Flint D.H. Tuminello J.F. Emptage M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22369-22376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was completely inhibited. Consequently, our findings allow the supposition of the scenario depicted in Fig. 7. H2O2 inactivates a ROS-sensitive FeS cluster within complex I localized between the coenzyme Q-reduction site and FMN (dotted line). This would initiate a vicious cycle leading to a self-accelerating inhibition of complex I with the result of further elevated H2O2 generation. This scenario might explain the following findings relevant to human disease: (i) the rather selective inhibition of complex I in combination with accumulation of markers for oxidative stress which has been reported for Substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease (26Beal M.F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), and (ii) the detected inhibition of complex I in the epileptic focus of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (27Kunz W.S. Kudin A.P. Vielhaber S. Blümcke I. Zuschratter W. Schramm J. Beck H. Elger C.E. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 48: 766-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar)."

Apoptosis, programmed cell death, via numerous triggers including death receptor ligand binding is antagonized by NFκB activation and potentiated by its inhibition. In the present study, we found that caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), known to inhibit NFκB, induced apoptosis via Fas signal activation in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. CAPE activated Fas by a Fas ligand (Fas-L)-independent mechanism, induced p53-regulated Bax protein, and activated caspases. CAPE also activated MAPK family proteins p38 and JNK. SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, partially suppressed CAPE-induced p53 activation, Bax expression, and apoptosis, consistent with a mechanism by which CAPE leads to Bax activation, known to be regulated by p38 and p53. The expression of dominant negative c-Jun, which inhibits the JNK signal, also suppresses CAPE-induced apoptosis, suggesting MAPKs are involved in CAPE-induced apoptosis. The expression of Fas antisense oligomers significantly suppressed the CAPE-induced activations of JNK and p38 and apoptosis as compared with Fas sense oligomers. To ascertain whether these phenomena are attributable to the inhibition of NFκB by CAPE, we examined the effect of a truncated form of IκBα (IκBΔN) lacking the phosphorylation sites essential for NFκB activation. IκBΔN expression not only inhibited NFκB activity but also induced Fas activation, Bax expression, and apoptosis. Our findings demonstrate that NFκB inhibition is sufficient to induce apoptosis and that Fas activation plays a role in NFκB inhibition-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells.

Our findings demonstrate that NFκB inhibition is sufficient to induce apoptosis and that Fas activation plays a role in NFκB inhibition-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. Programmed cell death can occur in all cells by highly efficient mechanisms, leading to the quiet disposal of millions of cells in the adult human. This efficient removal of unnecessary cells is regulated not only by cell death signals but also by those of cell survival. Any imbalance between these signals can be lethal in the development of higher organisms and likely plays a major role in pathophysiological processes as diverse as atherosclerosis, heart failure, and inflammation. Originally defined as a nuclear factor that binds to the B site of the immunoglobulin κ light chain gene enhancer in B lymphocytes (1Bellas R.E. FitzGerald M.J. Fausto N. Sonenshein G.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 891-896PubMed Google Scholar), transcription factor NFκB is crucial for the inducible expression of many genes involved in immunity and inflammation (2Hishikawa K. Nakaki T. Heart Drug. 2002; 2: 303-311Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). NFκB is a member of the rel multigene family and comprises five major proteins: p50, p65 (RelA), c-rel, p52, and RelB (3Akira S. Kishimoto T. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 1-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most abundant form of NFκB is the heterodimer of p50 and p65 that is retained in the cytosol by specific inhibitory proteins termed IκB (2Hishikawa K. Nakaki T. Heart Drug. 2002; 2: 303-311Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). IκB kinases are central to NFκB activation (4Maniatis T. Science. 1997; 278: 818-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 5Stancovski I. Baltimore D.

Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). The IκB kinases trigger the phosphorylation of IκB on amino-terminal serine residues 32 and 36, upon which the conjugation of ubiquitin occurs, and then targets the phosphorylated IκB for degradation by proteasomes (6Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). The released nucleophilic heterodimer then moves to the nucleus, where both p50 and p65 contribute to NFκB DNA binding (3Akira S. Kishimoto T. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 1-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The p65 subunit is responsible for transcriptional activity, resulting in the expression of NFκB-responsive target genes.

In this study we found that CAPE, which is known to inhibit NFκB, activates the Fas death receptor in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. We demonstrate herein that CAPE not only inhibits NFκB activity but also activates Fas in a Fas-L-independent manner. Moreover, CAPE induces Bax expression, caspase activation, DNA fragmentation, and apoptosis. We used a truncated form of IκBα (IκBΔN) lacking the phosphorylation sites essential for NFκB activation as an alternative method of inhibiting this activation. IκBΔN expression caused phenomena qualitatively identical to those observed with CAPE treatment. Taken together, these findings suggest that NFκB inhibition is sufficient to activate Fas death receptors and to induce apoptosis in human breast cancer cells. Materials—Anti-actin antibody, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe) fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-FMK), Z-Leu-Glu(OMe)-Thr-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-IETD-FMK), Z-Leu-Glu(OME)-His-Asp(OMe) fluoromethyl ketone (Z-LEHD-FMK), and recombinant Fas-L (soluble) were purchased from Sigma. Anti-active JNK antibody and anti-active p38 antibody were from Promega. Polyclonal anti-Fas, Fas-L, Bax, and Fas-associated death domain (FADD) antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. 3,3′-Dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) was from Pierce. Fas ligand inhibitor was from Kamiya Biomedical Company. Cell Culture—MCF-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air. DNA Fragmentation—DNA fragmentation was measured using a cell death detection ELISAPLUS kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nuclear Morphology—Morphological study was performed as described previously (8Watabe M. Kakeya H. Osada H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5211-5220Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). After CAPE treatment, the cells were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min, and incubated in 2 μg/ml Hoechst33258 (Sigma) for 5 min. Nuclear morphology was examined using fluorescence microscopy. Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (9Watabe M. Masuda Y. Nakajo S. Yoshida T. Kuroiwa Y. Nakaya K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14067-14072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in buffer containing SDS and mercaptoethanol, and the cell lysate was then boiled. Denatured proteins were separated on a polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was incubated with a blocking solution (2% skim milk (Invitrogen) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20 (TPBS) for 1 h at room temperature, washed with TPBS, and incubated for 1 h with a primary antibody dissolved in the blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the membrane was incubated for 1 h with the respective horseradish-linked secondary antibody. Immunoreactive proteins were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed with image analysis software NIH-Image 1.62 for the Macintosh. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immunocytochemical study was performed as described previously (10Watabe M. Nakajo S. Yoshida T. Kuroiwa Y. Nakaya K. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 871-879PubMed Google Scholar, 11Watabe M. Machida K. Osada H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5214-5222PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min. Cells were permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min and then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Incubation with primary antibody was carried out for 1 h at room temperature. Excess antibody was washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. This was followed by incubation with an appropriate fluorophore-labeled secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature in an area protected against light. After washing out the excess antibody three times with phosphate-buffered saline, we performed a mounting operation with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 μg/ml Hoechst33258 (Sigma). Images were collected by fluorescence microscopy. Reporter Assay—Reporter assays were performed as described previously (12Watabe M. Ito K. Masuda Y. Nakajo S. Nakaya K. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after co-transfection with p3xκB-Luc or p53-Luc (Stratagene) and pRL-TK (Promega) using SuperFect™ (Qiagen), the cells were treated with CAPE. Transcriptional activity in CAPE-treated cells was measured as the enzyme activity of luciferase, which is a product of the reporter gene, using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Fas Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (13Rehemtulla A. Hamilton C.A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25783-25786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 14Luo J. Sun Y. Lin H. Qian Y. Li Z. Leonard S.S. Huang C. Shi X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 278: 4542-4551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After treatment with CAPE, the cells were pelleted, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and treated with 2 mm cross-linker 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) for 15 min on ice. The reaction was quenched with 10 mm ammonium acetate for 10 min. The cells were pelleted, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and 2 mm EDTA) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cell lysates were then used for immunoprecipitation in the presence of an anti-Fas antibody at 0.5 μg/ml (antibody limiting) or 10 μg/ml (antibody excess). Immune complexes were precipitated using protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and washed four times in lysis buffer. The precipitate was resuspended in buffer containing SDS and mercaptoethanol, boiled, and then immunoblot analysis was performed. Detection of Fas-FADD Complex—Using an immunoprecipitation method, the Fas-FADD complex was detected as described previously (13Rehemtulla A. Hamilton C.A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25783-25786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 14Luo J. Sun Y. Lin H. Qian Y. Li Z. Leonard S.S. Huang C. Shi X. J. Biol.

After treatment with CAPE, the cells were pelleted, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and treated with 2 mm cross-linker 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) for 15 min on ice. The reaction was quenched with 10 mm ammonium acetate for 10 min. The cells were pelleted, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and 2 mm EDTA) containing a protease inhibitor mixture. The cell lysates were then used for immunoprecipitations in the presence of an anti-Fas antibody. Immune complexes were precipitated using protein A/G PLUS-agarose and washed four times in lysis buffer. The precipitate was resuspended in buffer containing SDS and mercaptoethanol, boiled, and then immunoblotted. Half the immunoprecipitate was used for immunoblot analysis to detect the presence of FADD, and the other half was used to detect the presence of Fas. Blockage of Fas Signaling with Fas Antisense Oligonucleotides—For antisense experiments, MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with sense or antisense Fas oligonucleotides using SuperFect™ (Qiagen) in accordance with the manufacturer's manual. After 24 h of transfection, the cells were treated with CAPE. Oligomer sequences for Fas sense (ATG CTG GGC ATC TGG ACC CTC) and antisense (GAG GGT CCA GAT GCC CAG CAT) oligonucleotides were directed against the ATG translation start site in Fas mRNA and were modified with phosphorothioate (Invitrogen). Recombinant Adenovirus Vector and Transfection Efficiency—We constructed a recombinant adenovirus vector expressing the non-degraded form of the NFκB inhibitor IκBα as described previously (15Hirahashi J. Takayanagi A. Hishikawa K. Takase O. Chikaraishi A. Hayashi M. Shimizu N. Saruta T. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 959-968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This nondegraded IκBα (IκBΔN) lacks the NH2-terminal 54 amino acids of wild type human IκBα. IκBΔN is reportedly not phosphorylated or proteolyzed in response to signal induction but does fully inhibit NFκB (16Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). To evaluate the efficiency of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer, cells were incubated with AdexlacZ at 37 °C using different multiplicities of infection (m.o.i., 1, 10, 50, and 100). β-galactosidase expression was evaluated by X-gal staining. After 48 h of incubation, AdexlacZ-infected cells were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and 1 mm MgCl2 for 15 min. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and assayed for lacZ expression by the X-gal staining method (15Hirahashi J. Takayanagi A. Hishikawa K. Takase O. Chikaraishi A. Hayashi M. Shimizu N. Saruta T. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 959-968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was increased in an m.o.i.-dependent manner and reached ∼70% at an m.o.i. of 100 (data not shown). We therefore employed an m.o.i. of 100 in all of the experiments. CAPE-induced Apoptosis—We first examined the effect of CAPE on cell viability in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. CAPE treatment for 48 h decreased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). To investigate whether or not this decrease in cell viability was caused by apoptosis, we analyzed DNA fragmentation. An increase in histone-associated DNA fragmentation caused by 10 μm CAPE was detected at 12 h and thereafter (Fig. 1B). CAPE treatment induced nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 1C). These results show that NFκB inhibition by CAPE does induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, we examined the effects of CAPE on DNA fragmentation in various cell types other than MCF-7. As shown in Fig. 1D, CAPE induced apoptosis in adherent cancer cell lines derived from different species such as human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells and rat myoblastic H9c2 cells but failed to do so in normal human fibroblast WI-38 cells. CAPE-induced Bax Expression—To investigate the mechanisms underlying CAPE-induced apoptosis, we examined the effect of CAPE on the expressions of apoptosis-related proteins. CAPE treatment markedly decreased the expression of X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, one of the NFκB target genes, after 24 h (Fig. 2A), whereas Bax was induced after 12 h of CAPE treatment (Fig. 2A). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed CAPE treatment increased the amount of Bax protein in cells, the size of which was reduced by CAPE treatment (Fig. 2B, arrow). p38-regulated Bax Induction—Bax is one of the p53 target genes. Because CAPE increased the amount of Bax, we examined the effect of CAPE on p53 transcriptional activity. As shown in Fig. 3A, CAPE activated p53 transcription 12 h after CAPE treatment. Because p53 phosphorylation is required for its activation and p53 is directly phosphorylated by certain protein kinases, including p38 which belongs to the MAP kinase superfamily (17Bulavin D.V. Saito S. Hollander M.C. Sakaguchi K. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Fornace Jr., A.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6845-6854Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 18Sanchez-Prieto R. Rojas J.M. Taya Y. Gutkind J.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2464-2472PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the effect of CAPE on p38 activity by detecting its phosphorylation. CAPE treatment induced p38 activation as early as 6 h; interestingly, this activation preceded the p53 activation (Fig. 3B). Moreover, SB203580, a specific p38 inhibitor, partially suppressed CAPE-induced p53 transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). To investigate whether or not p38 inhibition suppressed the expression of Bax, we examined the effect of SB203580 on Bax expression. SB203580 inhibited CAPE-induced Bax expression (Fig. 3D) and CAPE-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3E) in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of Fas-L-induced apoptosis by SB203580 was also observed in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3F). JNK Activation by CAPE—JNK, a member of the MAP kinase superfamily, is involved in apoptosis. Because Bax is essential for JNK-dependent apoptosis and JNK is necessary for Bax activation (19Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar, 20Lei K. Nimnual A. Zong W.X. Kennedy N.J. Flavell R.A. Thompson C.B. Bar-Sagi D. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 4929-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of CAPE on JNK activity. CAPE treatment induced JNK activation in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). Because the mutant (Δc-Jun) lacks the transactivation domain of c-Jun, acts as a dominant negative mutant, and inhibits the JNK-mediated pathway (12Watabe M. Ito K. Masuda Y. Nakajo S. Nakaya K. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of Δc-Jun transfection on CAPE-induced apoptosis. Δc-Jun expression partially but significantly suppressed CAPE-induced DNA fragmentation (Fig. 4B). Moreover, we also performed morphological observations. Nuclear fragmentation was detected in control vector-transfected cells (Fig. 4C, GFP-positive cells in the control group). On the other hand, nuclear fragmentation was also detected in Δc-Jun-nonexpressing cells (Fig. 4C, GFP-negative cells in the dominant negative group, arrow). However, no nuclear fragmentation was detected in Δc-Jun-expressed cells (GFP-positive cells in the dominant negative group) despite CAPE exposure (Fig. 4C). The same observation was made in MCF-7 cells undergoing recombinant Fas-L-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4D). Induction of Fas Aggregation by CAPE—We examined the effects of CAPE on Fas, which is a member of the death receptor family and functions upstream from Bax, because death receptor family members cluster, thereby inducing a death signal (21Nagata S. Golstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3980) Google Scholar, 22Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar). Using anti-Fas antibody, CAPE caused Fas aggregation in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5A). Because Fas aggregates, which have a high molecular mass and are SDS- and β-mercapto-ethanol-resistant, are immediately formed following receptor cross-linking (23Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22307-22314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we estimated the apparent molecular mass of Fas aggregates by immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 5B, top panel). High molecular mass aggregates formed at 24 h and thereafter when NFκB activity was almost completely inhibited. It was previously reported that maintaining cells at a low temperature blocks Fas receptor clustering by >90% (24Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Wilkes G. Poppelmann B. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 25Kulms D. Poppelmann B. Yarosh D. Luger T.A. Krutmann J. Schwarz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7974-7979Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism underlying the low temperature effect is not clear, changes in membrane fluidity have been suggested. It should be noted that keeping cells at a low temperature does not interfere with transcription in general (25Kulms D. Poppelmann B. Yarosh D. Luger T.A. Krutmann J. Schwarz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7974-7979Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To clarify the role of Fas aggregation in CAPE-induced apoptosis, we preincubated cells at 4 °C and then measured DNA fragmentation. As shown in Fig. 5C, short exposure to a low temperature (4 °C) for 1 h with CAPE treatment after preincubation for 30 min at 4 °C slightly suppressed CAPE-induced DNA fragmentation, whereas prolonged exposure at 4 °C for 24 h significantly suppressed CAPE-induced DNA fragmentation (Fig. 5D). Because lowering the temperature may affect numerous other processes besides clustering, we confirmed Fas aggregation utilizing other techniques, such as an immunoprecipitation protocol. The basic principle is that a less than stoichiometric amount of antibody will be able to immunoprecipitate more Fas molecules if aggregation occurs after CAPE treatment. In contrast, a sufficient amount of antibody will immunoprecipitate the same amount of Fas molecules regardless of aggregation. At limited antibody concentrations, the amount of immunoprecipitated Fas was increased by CAPE treatment (Fig. 6A). As expected, equal amounts of Fas were immunoprecipitated under conditions of antibody excess (Fig. 6A). To determine whether this Fas aggregation functions as a Fas death system in NFκB inhibition-induced apoptosis, our attention was drawn to an adapter molecule, FADD, which couples the Fas death receptor to procaspase-8. As shown in Fig. 5B (bottom panel), there was no change in FADD amount with CAPE treatment. To investigate whether CAPE-mediated Fas aggregation resulted in FADD recruitment, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed (Fig. 6B). Immunoprecipitation of Fas followed by immunoblotting using FADD-specific antibody revealed an increase in the association of FADD with Fas. On the other hand, Fas-L expression in MCF-7 cells remained low, and no change was detectable with CAPE treatment (Fig. 6C). To investigate whether or not the multimerization of Fas and Fas-FADD complex formation required Fas-L, we examined the effect of a Fas-L inhibitor on CAPE-induced apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 6D, the Fas-L inhibitor effectively inhibited recombinant Fas-L-induced apoptosis. However, the Fas-L inhibitor did not change CAPE-induced apoptosis despite treatment with a concentration higher than that that inhibited Fas-L-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6D). We also investigated whether or not Fas really was required for CAPE-induced apoptosis. An alternate approach to knocking out Fas signaling involves transient transfections with Fas antisense oligomers. As shown in Fig. 7A, the expression of Fas antisense oligomers significantly decreased Fas compared with Fas sense oligomers. Under these conditions, we investigated the effects of expressing Fas antisense oligomers on CAPE-induced apoptosis. As a result, the expression of Fas antisense oligomers significantly suppressed CAPE-induced apoptosis compared with Fas sense oligomers (Fig. 7B). Furthermore, the activation of JNK or p38 induced by CAPE was also inhibited by the expression of Fas antisense oligomers compared with Fas sense oligomers (Fig. 7, C and D). Consequently, CAPE produces clustering of death receptors, suggesting Fas activation via a Fas-L-independent mechanism. This in turn causes apoptosis via Bax, which is regulated by MAPKs (p38/JNK) and p53.Fig. 6Fas-L-independent activation of Fas system by CAPE.A, MCF-7 cells were treated with 10 μm CAPE for 24 h. The cells were treated with a cross-linker, lysed for immunoprecipitation using a Fas-specific antibody under antibody (Ab)-limiting conditions (top panel) or antibody excess conditions (bottom panel) as described under “Materials and Methods.” Immunoblot analyses of immunoprecipitates were performed using specific antibodies. B, MCF-7 cells were treated with 10 μm CAPE for 24 h. The cells were treated with a cross-linker and lysed, and the extract was used for immunoprecipitation (IP). Half of the immunoprecipitate was used for immunoblot analysis to detect the presence of FADD (top panel); the other half was used to detect the presence of Fas (bottom panel).

As expected, CAPE inhibited the transcriptional activity of NFκB in a dose- and time-dependent manner in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 8, A and B). We confirmed that IκBΔN expression inhibited the transcriptional activity of NFκB in a time-dependent manner, and no NFκB activity was detected at 48 h after AdexIκBΔN infection (Fig. 8C). IκBΔN expression in MCF-7 cells significantly increased DNA fragmentation as compared with the lacZ gene (Fig. 9A). Under these conditions, Fas aggregation was detected in cells with shrunken nuclei (Fig. 9B, arrow) and high molecular mass proteins reacted with anti-Fas antibody (Fig. 9C). These changes did not occur in LacZ-expressing cells. To determine whether IκBΔN-induced apoptosis requires Fas aggregation, we preincubated cells at 4 °C and then measured DNA fragmentation. Blockade of death receptor clustering at 4 °C significantly inhibited IκBΔN-induced DNA fragmentation (Fig. 9D). Moreover, the expression of IκBΔN inhibited X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis and induced Bax protein (Fig. 10A). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the amount of Bax protein to be increased by IκBΔN expression (Fig. 10B). Thus, IκBΔN expression induced apoptosis by the same mechanism as CAPE.Fig. 9IκBΔN-induced apoptosis and Fas aggregation. MCF-7 cells were infected with AdexlacZ (m.o.i. = 100) and AdexIκBΔN (m.o.i. = 100).

Z-VAD-FMK is an irreversible caspase inhibitor with a broad specificity against various caspases, Z-IETD-FMK is an irreversible specific inhibitor of caspase-8, and Z-LEHD-FMK is an irreversible specific inhibitor of caspase-9. When the cells were pretreated with each caspase inhibitor, DNA fragmentation caused by either CAPE treatment or IκBΔN expression was suppressed in the presence of each caspase inhibitor (Fig. 11). Because treatment with Z-IETD-FMK or Z-LEHD-FMK alone suppressed NFκB inhibition-induced apoptosis, caspase-8 and -9 are considered to be involved in an apoptotic pathway transmitted via NFκB inhibition. Taken together, these results suggest NFκB inhibition in MCF-7 cells induces Fas activation, activates Bax by a JNK/p38-dependent mechanism, activates caspases, and induces apoptosis. In this study, we clarified for the first time that CAPE, known to inhibit NFκB, leads to the clustering of Fas death receptors by a Fas-L-independent mechanism and induces apoptosis. UV is known to cause Fas death receptor clustering by a Fas-L-independent mechanism (24Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Wilkes G. Poppelmann B. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated herein a new Fas-L-independent mechanism by which inhibition of NFκB, which controls cell survival, is sufficient to induce Fas aggregation, using IκBΔN. As a ubiquitous multifunctional signaling system, members of the NFκB family play prominent roles in the cell death/survival balance (26Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). CAPE, a flavonoid derivative, is a biologically active ingredient of honeybee propolis and strongly inhibits NFκB activation. We have demonstrated that apoptosis is induced by CAPE in various cancer cell lines. However, it is noteworthy that CAPE failed to induce apoptosis in WI-38 cells, not a cancer cell line. We investigated NFκB activities in various cell lines, including those described in this report, and found apoptosis induction by NFκB inhibition to parallel basal NFκB activities (data not shown). Namely, cancer cells with high basal NFκB activity are more sensitive to NFκB inhibition by CAPE than normal cells. This raises the possibility that cancer cell-specific drugs could be developed if NFκB-specific inhibitors were available for humans. In Fas-mediated cell death, it is well known that Fas binds to its ligand, Fas-L (28Nunez G. Benedict M.A. Hu Y. Inohara N. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3237-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 29Enari M. Talanian R.V. Wong W.W. Nagata S. Nature. 1996; 380: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). On the other hand, CAPE induced Fas aggregation and activated Fas independently of Fas-L in MCF-7 cells. It is also known that death receptor aggregation results in the activation of two independent signaling pathways. One well characterized pathway involves the death adaptor molecule FADD. The other pathway is mediated through Daxx, which enhances Fas-induced apoptosis by activating the JNK/p38 kinase cascade via apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (30Yang X. Khosravi-Far R.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 540: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), culminating in activation of the Bax subfamily of Bcl2-related proteins (20Lei K. Nimnual A. Zong W.X. Kennedy N.J. Flavell R.A. Thompson C.B. Bar-Sagi D. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 4929-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) or in the phosphorylation and activation of transcription factors such as p53 (17Bulavin D.V. Saito S. Hollander M.C.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2464-2472PubMed Google Scholar). To clarify the role of these two pathways in CAPE-induced apoptosis, we examined each step. First, treatment with Fas antisense oligonucleotides significantly inhibited CAPE-induced cell death. Second, immunoblotting using FADD-specific antibody clarified the association of FADD with Fas, and caspase-8 inhibitor also inhibited CAPE-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that CAPE promotes Fas aggregation and the association of Fas with FADD and subsequently activates caspase-8. Next, we examined the role of a second pathway using Fas antisense oligonucleotides, a p38-specific inhibitor (SB203580), and dominant negative c-Jun. Treatment with Fas antisense oligonucleotides suppressed CAPE-induced cell death and JNK/p38 activation. SB203580 and dominant negative c-Jun partially but significantly suppressed CAPE-induced p53 activation, Bax expression, and apoptosis. Although we could not exclude the involvement of some pathway other than the Fas system, our results show both FADD/caspase-8 and JNK/p38 play important roles in CAPE-induced cell death in MCF-7 cells. In general, an apoptotic signal can be transmitted through either the death receptors (28Nunez G. Benedict M.A. Hu Y. Inohara N. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3237-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 29Enari M. Talanian R.V. Wong W.W. Nagata S. Nature. 1996; 380: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar) or mitochondria (33Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar, 34Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondria-mediated cell death is distinguished from Fas-mediated apoptosis. Mitochondria sense the apoptotic signal and activate caspase-9 via the release of cytochrome c and Apaf-1, ultimately triggering apoptosis. In this study, CAPE induced Fas aggregation and a caspase-8 inhibitor suppressed CAPE-induced apoptosis. However, a caspase-9 inhibitor alone suppressed CAPE-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that both signals are necessary for CAPE-induced apoptosis. As for MCF-7 cells, we speculate that the death signal of caspase-8 activated by the association of Fas with FADD is transmitted to mitochondria via a second messenger such as Bid. Then, p38 activated by Fas aggregation acts on p53, followed by the expression of Bax, which is in turn activated by JNK that is activated by Fas aggregation. Subsequently, cytochrome c is released, caspase-9 is activated, and apoptosis is induced via caspases other than caspase-3. Because a truncated form of IκBα (IκBΔN) lacking the phosphorylation sites essential for NFκB activation is a specific inhibitor of NFκB, we used this approach in addition to CAPE to obtain a line of convincing evidence that NFκB inhibition activates Fas and thereby leads to apoptosis. IκBΔN expression caused a phenomenon qualitatively identical to that observed with CAPE treatment. These results demonstrate that NFκB inhibition accounts for CAPE-induced Fas activation and apoptosis. However, it is still unclear how NFκB inhibition increases Fas aggregation/activation. As Anderson (36Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1993; 90: 10909-10913Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) as well as Rosette and Karin (37Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar) reported, it is possible that physical perturbation of the plasma membrane or conformational change through expression changes in some proteins via the inhibition of NFκB may cause receptor clustering. From the clinical perspective, it is interesting that CAPE, a natural flavonoid, exerted a stronger effect than IκBΔN in apoptosis induction. In summary, we have demonstrated that the inhibition of NFκB is pro-apoptotic in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells and that this effect is attributable to Fas death receptor clustering.

https://openalex.org/W1990779663,"The serine-threonine kinase Akt has been established as an important signaling intermediate in regulating cell survival, cell cycle progression, as well as agonist-induced platelet activation. Stimulation of platelets with various agonists including thrombin results in Akt activation. As thrombin can stimulate multiple G protein signaling pathways, we investigated the mechanism of thrombin-induced activation of Akt. Stimulation of platelets with a PAR1-activating peptide (SFLLRN), PAR4-activating peptide (AYPGKF), and thrombin resulted in Thr308 and Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt, which results in its activation. This phosphorylation and activation of Akt were dramatically inhibited in the presence of AR-C69931MX, a P2Y12 receptor-selective antagonist, or GF 109203X, a protein kinase C inhibitor, but Akt phosphorylation was restored by supplemental Gi or Gz signaling. Unlike wild-type mouse platelets, platelets from Gαq-deficient mice failed to trigger Akt phosphorylation by thrombin and AYPGKF, whereas Akt phosphorylation was not affected by these agonists in platelets from mice that lack P2Y1 receptor. However, ADP caused Akt phosphorylation in Gαq- and P2Y1-deficient platelets, which was completely blocked by AR-C69931MX. In contrast, ADP failed to cause Akt phosphorylation in platelets from mice treated with clopidogrel, and thrombin and AYPGKF induced minimal phosphorylation of Akt, which was not affected by AR-C69931MX in these platelets. These data demonstrate that Gi, but not Gq or G12/13, signaling pathways are required for activation of Akt in platelets, and Gi signaling pathways, stimulated by secreted ADP, play an essential role in the activation of Akt in platelets.

Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar). There are at least three different Akt isoforms identified in humans, which display more than 80% sequence homology and are named Akt1 (PKBα), Akt2 (PKBβ), and Akt3 (PKBγ) (5Jones P.F. Jakubowicz T. Pitossi F.J. Maurer F. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4171-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Akt1 (PKBα) and Akt2 (PKBβ) are expressed in human platelets, whereas Akt3 (PKBγ) is not present in human platelets (6Kroner C. Eybrechts K. Akkerman J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27790-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Both translocation of Akt to cell membranes and phosphorylation of both Thr308 and Ser473 are required for full enzyme activity. Akt is activated by various agonists including platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, insulin, nerve growth factor, U46619 (a thromboxane A2 analogue), convulxin (a glycoprotein VI agonist), and thrombin (6Kroner C.

Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar), indicating that PI 3-kinase is an upstream regulator of Akt. PI 3-kinase products PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 trigger the simultaneous phosphorylation of Akt by phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinases (PDK) 1 and 2. Membrane attachment of Akt is a prerequisite for phosphorylation by PDK1 and 2. PDK1 has been shown to phosphorylate Thr308 of Akt1, and the phosphorylation of Ser473 is independent of Thr308 (10Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. McCormick F. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1997; 277: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Ser473 is phosphorylated by a kinase whose identity is still obscure but has been proposed as PDK2. Some researchers propose that autophosphorylation at the Ser473 site is the mechanism by which this serine residue is phosphorylated (11Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8271-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Recently, the integrin-linked kinase has been shown to be an important regulator of Ser473 phosphorylation (12Troussard A.A. Mawji N.N. Ong C. Mui A. St. Arnaud R. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22374-22378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In addition to the PI 3-kinase-mediated activation of Akt, a phospholipase β2-dependent pathway via a calcium-dependent PKC subtype has been known to increase activity of Akt1 by thrombin (6Kroner C. Eybrechts K. Akkerman J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27790-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Activation of PKC results in the PI 3-kinase-independent increase in Akt1 activity by selective phosphorylation of Ser473, but selective phosphorylation of Ser473 is insufficient for full PKB activation. Yano et al. (13Yano S. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. Nature. 1998; 396: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) have also identified Ca2+-dependent regulation of Akt in which Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase can activate Akt in vitro through phosphorylation of Thr308. protein kinase B heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein which stimulates phospholipase C heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein which inhibits adenylyl cyclase heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins 12 and 13 platelet ADP receptor coupled to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase platelet ADP receptor coupled to stimulation of phospholipase C protease-activated receptor protein kinase C phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3 phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase plateletrich plasma 5,5′-dimethyl-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid room temperature bovine serum albumin phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate phosphatidylinositol 2-methylthio-ADP. protein kinase B heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein which stimulates phospholipase C heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein which inhibits adenylyl cyclase heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins 12 and 13 platelet ADP receptor coupled to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase platelet ADP receptor coupled to stimulation of phospholipase C protease-activated receptor protein kinase C phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3 phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase plateletrich plasma 5,5′-dimethyl-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid room temperature bovine serum albumin phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate phosphatidylinositol 2-methylthio-ADP. It is well established that ADP-induced platelet aggregation requires concomitant signaling from both the P2Y1 and P2Y12 receptors that couple to Gq and Gi, respectively (14Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8070-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Thrombin mediates its cellular effects primarily through a family of Gq-coupled protease-activated receptors (PARs), and we have shown that thrombin and thrombin receptor-activating peptides cause Gi stimulation through P2Y12 receptor activation by secreted ADP (15Kim S. Foster C. Lecchi A. Quinton T.M. Prosser D.M. Jin J. Cattaneo M. Kunapuli S.P. Blood. 2002; 99: 3629-3636Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It has been shown that stimulation of platelets with thrombin results in Akt activation (6Kroner C. Eybrechts K. Akkerman J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27790-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and Akt functions as a downstream effector of PI 3-kinase. However, the signal transduction mechanisms of Akt activation are less clear, and it is not well established whether Akt activation in platelets is stimulated by Gq- or Gi-coupled pathways. In this study, we have investigated the signaling events involved in Akt activation mediated by thrombin and thrombin receptor-activating peptides in platelets, giving special emphasis to the role of secretion and Gi-coupled receptors in regulation of Akt. In human and mouse platelets, we have found that thrombin- and thrombin receptor-activating peptide-mediated Akt activation is largely dependent on signaling through the P2Y12 receptor and PI 3-kinase. We also show that thrombin- and AYPGKF-induced Akt phosphorylation is eliminated in Gαq-deficient mouse platelets. Using platelets from mice lacking Gαq, lacking P2Y1 receptor, and clopidogrel-dosed mice, we demonstrate that Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptor is required for agonist-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. Materials—Thrombin, MRS-2179, apyrase (type V), PMA, epinephrine, fibrinogen (type I), and bovine serum albumin (fraction V) were purchased from Sigma. Hexapeptides SFLLRN and AYPGKF were custom-synthesized at Research Genetics Inc. (Huntsville, AL). Anti-Akt and anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473 and Thr308) antibodies and Akt kinase assay kit were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Alkaline phosphatase-labeled secondary antibody was from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD). CDP-Star® chemiluminescent substrates were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). LY294002 was from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). 5,5′-Dimethyl-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (dimethyl-BAPTA) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). AR-C69931MX was a gift from Astra-Zeneca (Loughborough, UK). Bisindolylmaleimide I (GF 109203X) was from Calbiochem. Clopidogrel was from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. All other reagents were reagent-grade, and deionized water was used throughout. Animals—Gαq-deficient mice were obtained from T. Kent Gartner (16Cho M.J. Liu J. Pestina T.I. Steward S.A. Thomas D.W.

P2Y1-deficient mice were generated by subcontract with Lexicon Genetics Inc. (Woodlands, TX) through knockout constructs as described previously (17Fabre J.E. Nguyen M. Latour A. Keifer J.A.

The phenotype of P2Y1 receptor-deficient mouse platelets was confirmed by platelet function studies. Preparation of Human Platelets—Human blood was obtained from a pool of healthy volunteers in a one-sixth volume of ACD (2.5 g of sodium citrate, 1.5 g of citric acid, and 2.0 g of glucose in 100 ml of H2O). Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was prepared by centrifugation of citrated blood at 230 × g for 20 min at room temperature (RT). Acetylsalicylic acid was added to PRP to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the preparation was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C followed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min at RT. The platelet pellet was resuspended in Tyrode's buffer (pH 7.4) containing 138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.42 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.05 units/ml apyrase. This low concentration of apyrase is not enough to block responses to ADP but will prolong the responsiveness of platelets to ADP by preventing desensitization of the P2Y receptors. These conditions have been standardized in the laboratory, with a platelet count adjusted to 2 × 108 cells/ml. Preparation of Mouse Platelets—Blood was collected from the vena cava of anesthetized mice into syringes containing 1/10th blood volume of 3.8% sodium citrate as anticoagulant. For clopidogrel treatment, mice were orally dosed with clopidogrel (30 mg/kg/day) for 2 days, and blood was collected 1 h after the final dose. Red blood cells were removed by centrifugation at 100 × g for 10 min. Platelet-rich plasma was recovered, and platelets were pelleted at 400 × g for 10 min. The platelet pellet was resuspended in Tyrode's buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.05 units/ml apyrase. Aggregometry—Aggregation of 0.5 ml washed platelets was analyzed using a P.I.C.A. lumiaggregometer (Chrono-log Corp., Havertown, PA). Aggregation was measured using light transmission under stirring conditions (900 rpm) at 37 °C. Each sample was allowed to aggregate for at least 3 min. The chart recorder (Kipp and Zonen, Bohemia, NY) was set for 0.2 mm/s. Measurement of Akt Phosphorylation—Platelets were stimulated with agonists under non-stirring conditions for the appropriate time, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 3× SDS sample buffer. In some experiments, GF 109203X (10 μm), a PKC inhibitor, and dimethyl-BAPTA (10 μm), a calcium chelator, were added and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C without stirring before agonist stimulation. Platelet samples were boiled for 5 min, and proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation in Tris-buffered saline/Tween (TBST; 20 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) containing 0.5% (w/v) milk protein and 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min at RT, and membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody (1:1000 in TBST, 2% BSA) with gentle agitation. After three washes for 5 min each with TBST, the membranes were probed with the alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000 in TBST, 2% BSA) for 1 h at RT. After additional washing steps, membranes were then incubated with a CDP-Star® chemiluminescent substrates for 10 min at RT, and immunoreactivity was detected using Fujifilm Luminescent Image Analyzer (model LAS-1000 CH, Japan). In Vitro Kinase Assay for Akt—Akt kinase activity was measured using a modification of the Akt kinase assay kit from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Briefly, platelets were stimulated with agonists under non-stirring conditions for 3 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 5× ice-cold cell lysis buffer (100 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 750 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 5% Triton X-100, 12.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm Na3VO4, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Resuspended immobilized Akt antibody slurry (20 μl) was added to 200 μl of platelet lysates to selectively immunoprecipitate Akt from the lysate with gentle rocking 3 h at 4 °C. The pellet was washed twice with 500 μl of 1× lysis buffer and twice with 500 μl of 1× kinase buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm MgCl2). The immunoprecipitated pellet was then incubated with 40 μl of 1× kinase buffer supplemented with 200 μm ATP and 1 μg of GSK-3 fusion protein for 30 min at 30 °C allowing immunoprecipitated Akt to phosphorylate GSK-3. The reaction was terminated with 20 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min and loaded on 14% SDS-PAGE gel. Akt-induced phosphorylation of GSK-3 was detected by Western blotting using phospho-GSK-3α/β (Ser21/9) antibody. SFLLRN, AYPGKF, and Thrombin Induce Akt Phosphorylation in a Dose- and Time-dependent Manner—It has been shown that thrombin induces phosphorylation of Akt in platelets (6Kroner C. Eybrechts K. Akkerman J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27790-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 19Banfic H. Downes C.P. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11630-11637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To determine the kinetics of Akt phosphorylation, Ser473 phosphorylation was monitored over a time range of 0.5–20 min. Fig. 1A illustrates that a rapid increase in Akt phosphorylation in response to thrombin was detectable as early as 30 s after stimulation. The level of phosphorylation peaked at around 3 min and remained stable after 20 min of stimulation. Because thrombin signals via PAR1 and PAR4 receptors in human platelets, we examined Akt phosphorylation in response to SFLLRN, a PAR1-activating peptide, AYPGKF, a PAR4-activating peptide, and thrombin. We exposed platelets to different concentrations of the agonists, and Ser473 phosphorylation was measured at 3 min after the addition of agonist. Fig. 1B shows that all three agonists induced a concentration-dependent increase in Akt phosphorylation. An increase in Ser473 phosphorylation was detectable at concentrations above 3 μm SFLLRN, 200 μm AYPGKF, or 0.1 unit/ml thrombin; furthermore, higher concentrations revealed further phosphorylation that peaked at concentrations above 5 μm SFLLRN, 500 μm AYPGKF, or 0.5 unit/ml thrombin. A similar pattern of concentration-dependent phosphorylation of Thr308 in response to SFLLRN, AYPGKF, and thrombin was also detected (data not shown). Effect of Secretion and Gi Signaling Pathways in Akt Phosphorylation and Activation by SFLLRN, AYPGKF, and Thrombin in Human Platelets—Immunoblot analysis revealed that Akt is phosphorylated on Ser473 and Thr308 in response to SFLLRN, AYPGKF, and thrombin in human platelets (Fig. 2). SFLLRN induced a lower extent of Ser473 and Thr308 phosphorylation, whereas AYPGKF induced a similar extent of Akt phosphorylation as thrombin. These results are consistent with a previous study in which phosphorylation of Thr308 and Ser473 induced by SFLLRN in human platelets is 50% of the response induced by thrombin (6Kroner C. Eybrechts K. Akkerman J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27790-27798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, they failed to activate Akt completely in response to the PAR4-activating peptide GYPGKF, which is in contrast with our data, wherein dual phosphorylation and activation of Akt occur in response to AYPGKF. These results indicate that both PAR1 and PAR4 receptors can induce concurrent phosphorylation of Ser473 and Thr308, and AYPGKF and thrombin are more potent activators of Akt phosphorylation than SFLLRN. Activation of PAR1 or PAR4 causes release of dense granule contents, and the released ADP activates the Gi pathways through stimulation of the P2Y12 receptor (15Kim S. Foster C. Lecchi A. Quinton T.M. Prosser D.M. Jin J. Cattaneo M. Kunapuli S.P. Blood. 2002; 99: 3629-3636Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To determine whether PAR1 and PAR4 receptors can activate Akt independently of secreted ADP and Gi signaling pathways, we utilized several complementary approaches to evaluate the role of Gi signaling in Akt phosphorylation. The first approach was to block secretion, thereby eliminating the contribution of secreted ADP to Gi stimulation. PKC has been shown to play a major role in the induction of platelet secretion (20Sano K. Takai Y. Yamanishi J. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2010-2013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Walker T.R. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To assess the role of secreted ADP to the Akt activation upon stimulation of platelets with SFLLRN, AYPGKF, and thrombin, we used GF 109203X (22Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a selective inhibitor of PKC isoforms, and AR-C69931MX, an antagonist at the Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptor (23Ingall A.H. Dixon J. Bailey A. Coombs M.E. Cox D. McInally J.I. Hunt S.F. Kindon N.D. Teobald B.J. Willis P.A. Humphries R.G. Leff P. Clegg J.A. Smith J.A. Tomlinson W. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In the presence of AR-C69931MX or GF 109203X, we found that both Ser473 and Thr308 phosphorylations were dramatically inhibited suggesting the important role of secretion and Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptor in Akt phosphorylation. It has been shown that intracellular calcium increases also have a role in platelet secretion (24Quinton T.M. Ozdener F. Dangelmaier C. Daniel J.L. Kunapuli S.P. Blood. 2002; 99: 3228-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of calcium in Akt phosphorylation, the high affinity calcium chelator dimethyl-BAPTA was used to block intracellular calcium increases. The presence of dimethyl-BAPTA significantly, but not completely, inhibited both Ser473 and Thr308 phosphorylation in response to all agonists. As dimethyl-BAPTA interferes with platelet secretion, inhibition of Akt phosphorylation in dimethyl-BAPTA-treated platelets might be due to the loss of Gi stimulation by secreted ADP. It is known that PI 3-kinase is the main upstream regulator of Akt, and PI 3-kinase plays an important role in the Gi-dependent potentiation of platelet aggregation. SFLLRN-, AYPGKF-, and thrombin-induced Akt phosphorylation were inhibited in the presence of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, suggesting that phosphorylation of Akt is PI 3-kinase dependent. These results indicate that secreted ADP and Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptors are important in SFLLRN-, AYPGKF-, and thrombin-induced phosphorylation of Akt, and PI 3-kinase is a key element in the Gi-coupled pathway for Akt phosphorylation. It has been known that phosphorylation of both Thr308 and Ser473 is required for full activation of Akt (4Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar). Akt activity was measured by in vitro kinase assay that detects phosphorylation of GSK-3 induced by immunoprecipitated Akt. Phosphorylation of GSK-3 was measured by Western blotting using a phospho-GSK-3α/β (Ser21/9) antibody, and GSK-3α/β kinase activity has been shown to be negatively regulated by Akt via phosphorylation at Ser21/9. Our results of Akt kinase activity in human platelets (Fig. 3) correspond to Akt phosphorylation shown in Fig. 2. In the presence of dimethyl-BAPTA, activation of Akt in response to SFLLRN, AYPGKF, and thrombin was diminished but not completely abolished. Furthermore, Akt activation was nearly abolished in the presence of AR-C69931MX and GF 109203X confirming that Gi stimulation by secretion is essential for thrombin- and thrombin receptor-activating peptide-induced Akt activation. Effect of Secretion and Gi Pathways in Akt Phosphorylation by AYPGKF and Thrombin in Mouse Platelets—To determine whether Akt can be phosphorylated in a Gi-dependent manner in mouse as well as human platelets, a similar approach was applied to mouse platelets and Akt phosphorylation in response to AYPGKF, and thrombin was measured. Mouse platelets do not express PAR1, and hence we did not use SFLLRN. Akt phosphorylation by AYPGKF and thrombin was nearly abolished in the presence of AR-C69931MX, LY294002, GF 109203X, and dimethyl-BAPTA (Fig. 4) with the inhibition being more severe with LY294002. Therefore, it appears that AYPGKF and thrombin phosphorylate Akt predominantly via Gi pathways in both human and mouse platelets. Akt Phosphorylation in Platelets from Gαq- and P2Y1-deficient Mice—Pharmacological inhibitors may not completely block the pathways and might have non-selective effects on other signaling molecules. Hence, as a complementary approach to better understand which G protein-coupled pathways mediate Akt activation, we used knockout mice. We compared Akt phosphorylation in response to ADP, AYPGKF, and thrombin in platelets from mice lacking Gαq, lacking P2Y1, or wild-type mice. In wild-type littermates, AYPGKF and thrombin caused phosphorylation of Ser473, which was significantly inhibited in the presence of AR-C69931MX. However, AYPGKF- and thrombin failed to phosphorylate Akt at Ser473 in platelets from Gαq knockout mice (Fig. 5A). It has been shown that platelets from Gαq knockout mice fail to release their granule contents in response to thrombin (25Offermanns S. Toombs C.F. Hu Y.H. Simon M.I. Nature. 1997; 389: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), and we have shown that PAR1 and PAR4 fail to directly couple to Gi in platelets and depend on secreted ADP for Gi stimulation (15Kim S. Foster C. Lecchi A. Quinton T.M. Prosser D.M. Jin J. Cattaneo M. Kunapuli S.P. Blood. 2002; 99: 3629-3636Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To determine whether absence of Akt phosphorylation in Gαq-deficient platelets is due to direct effect of Gαq on Akt or indirectly through the absence of Gi stimulation by secretion, Akt phosphorylation in response to ADP was compared in Gαq-deficient mice and their wild-type littermates (Fig. 5B). In both wild-type and Gαq-deficient mouse platelets, ADP caused Akt phosphorylation in the presence or absence of MRS-2179, a P2Y1 receptor antagonist (26Baurand A. Raboisson P. Freund M. Leon C. Cazenave J.P. Bourguignon J.J. Gachet C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 412: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), whereas ADP-induced Akt phosphorylation was abolished by AR-C69931MX suggesting the essential role of Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptor in Akt activation in platelets. This provides further evidence that the absence of Akt phosphorylation in Gαq-deficient platel"

Histologic evaluation of the lungs of these animals demonstrates epithelial apoptosis and necrosis. Although the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is widely thought to be responsible for the cell death observed following exposure to hyperoxia, it is not clear whether they act upstream of activation of the cell death pathway or whether they are generated as a result of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and caspase activation. We hypothesized that the generation of ROS was required for hyperoxia-induced cell death upstream of Bax activation. In primary rat alveolar epithelial cells, we found that exposure to hyperoxia resulted in the generation of ROS that was completely prevented by the administration of the combined superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetic EUK-134 (Eukarion, Inc., Bedford, MA). Exposure to hyperoxia resulted in the activation of Bax at the mitochondrial membrane, cytochrome c release, and cell death.

Stimuli that cause mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis utilize a variety of pathways that converge on the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bax or Bak (8Puthalakath H. Strasser A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Activation of Bax or Bak results in their oligomerization at the outer mitochondrial membrane and causes the release of a variety of pro-apoptotic molecules, including cytochrome c, from the intermitochondrial membrane space into the cytosol (9Korsmeyer S.J. Wei M.C. Saito M. Weiler S. Oh K.J. Schlesinger P.H. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1166-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that hyperoxia-induced cell death requires the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins Bax or Bak and results in the release of cytochrome c, suggesting that hyperoxia acts as a mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic stimulus (10Budinger G.R.

Several groups of investigators have observed ROS generation during exposure to hyperoxia and have hypothesized that these ROS act as upstream signaling molecules that initiate cell death (5Freeman B.A. Crapo J.D.

In support of this hypothesis, the generation of ROS has been demonstrated following the administration of many mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic stimuli including growth factor withdrawal, UV radiation, and the administration of some chemotherapeutic agents (13Kirkland R.A. Windelborn J.A. Kasprzak J.M. Franklin J.L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6480-6490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Chen Q. Chai Y.C. Mazumder S. Jiang C. Macklis R.M. Chisolm G.M. Almasan A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 47266-47276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Antioxidants have been shown to prevent or delay death in all of these models. In many models, however, investigators have reported that the generation of ROS during mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis occurs downstream of the release of cytochrome c from the intermembrane space (16Cai J. Jones D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11401-11404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 17Gottlieb E. Vander Heiden M.G. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5680-5689Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both mitochondrial membrane proteins and components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain have been reported to be caspase substrates (14Chen Q. Chai Y.C. Mazumder S. Jiang C. Macklis R.M. Chisolm G.M. Almasan A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 18Ricci J.E. Gottlieb R.A. Green D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). If oxidant generation occurs downstream of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, then antioxidants are likely to delay rather than prevent cell death. In this study, we sought to determine whether the generation of ROS acted upstream or downstream of Bax activation and cytochrome c release in primary cultures of alveolar epithelial cells. As both the superoxide anion and H2O2 may be required for hyperoxia-induced cell death, we chose to use the combined superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetic EUK-134. This compound has been shown to correct the mev1 genetic defect caused by a deficiency in antioxidant enzymes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (19Melov S. Ravenscroft J. Malik S. Gill M.S. Walker D.W. Clayton P.E. Wallace D.C. Malfroy B. Doctrow S.R. Lithgow G.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1567-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). The administration of EUK-134 concomitant with hyperoxic exposure completely prevented hyperoxia-induced depletion of reduced glutathione levels, Bax activation at the mitochondrial membrane, cytochrome c release, and cell death. In a mouse lung epithelial cell line, the overexpression of Bcl-XL prevented both Bax activation and cell death, demonstrating the requirement for Bcl-2 proteins in the apoptotic pathway initiated by hyperoxia. Cell Culture and Oxygen Environment of the Cells—Rat alveolar epithelial cells were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200-225 g. This procedure is described in detail elsewhere (20Ridge K.M. Rutschman D.H. Factor P. Katz A.I. Bertorello A.M. Sznajder J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L246-L255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in serum-free Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with penicillin (200 units/ml), streptomycin (200 μg/ml), kanamycin (100 μg/ml), amphotericin B (80 μg/ml), 20 mm HEPES, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (37 °C, 5% CO2). Medium was changed on Day + 2 of isolation (Day 0 = day of isolation). The cells were washed twice with 2-3 ml of PBS when the medium was changed. Cells were exposed to hyperoxia (95% O2, 5% CO2) in Oxycycler (Bio-Sperix, Ltd., Redfield, NY) chambers or normoxia (room air) at 37 °C. Glucose concentrations were measured at the end of the hyperoxic exposure and were always in excess of 200 mg/dl. Measurement of Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) Release—LDH release was measured using a commercially available assay (cytotoxicity detection kit; Roche Applied Science). After gentle agitation, 500 μl of medium was removed, and the remaining cells were lysed by adding 500 μl of 5% Triton X-100 solution. After 30 min at room temperature, each plate was gently scraped with a cell scraper, and 500 μl of the lysate was removed. The samples were incubated in the dark (30 min) with buffer containing NAD+, lactate, and tetrazolium. LDH converts lactate to pyruvate, generating NADH. The NADH then reduces tetrazolium (yellow) to formazan (red), which was detected by fluorescence (490 nm). LDH release, a marker for cell death, was expressed as a percentage of the LDH in the medium over the total LDH (lysate). Reduced Glutathione Assay—Reduced glutathione was measured using a commercially available assay (ApoGSH™ glutathione detection kit, BioVision, Inc., Mountain View, CA) (21Kamencic H. Lyon A. Paterson P.G. Juurlink B.H. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 35-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Plates were removed from experimental conditions and placed immediately on ice. Medium was aspirated, and cells were washed with ice-cold PBS. Each plate was incubated on ice with cell lysis buffer (10 min). Cells were scraped using a cell scraper. The lysate was collected, homogenized (30 s), and centrifuged (10 min). Monochlorobimane (2 μl) and glutathione S-transferase (2 μl) reagent were added to 100 μl of cell lysate (37 °C, 30 min). Monochlorobimane is a dye that binds exclusively to reduced glutathione in a reaction catalyzed by glutathione S-transferase. Monochlorobimane fluoresces blue when bound to glutathione (380-μm excitation and 460-μm emission). The glutathione level was expressed as OD per microgram of protein (Bradford (42Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar)). DAPI Staining for Nuclear Morphology (Apoptosis)—Nuclear morphology was assessed with DAPI staining as described previously (22McClintock D.S. Santore M.T. Lee V.Y. Brunelle J. Budinger G.R. Zong W.X. Thompson C.B. Hay N. Chandel N.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 94-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, floating cells were aspirated, and adherent cells were removed from the plate using EDTA (25 mm) in trypsin. Floating and adherent cells were combined and fixed with 50 μl of 0.25% glutaraldehyde solution. The cells were centrifuged, resuspended in 80 μl of DAPI (1 μg/μl), and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The cells were then centrifuged, resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, and placed on a slide for fluorescence microscopy. Nuclei were scored as apoptotic if they demonstrated nuclear fragmentation or condensation. Results are expressed as cells demonstrating apoptotic nuclei as the percentage of total cells counted (∼100 cells). Measurement of Cytochrome c Release—Cytochrome c release was measured using a modification of a previously described method (23Kennedy S.G. Kandel E.S. Cross T.K. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5800-5810Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Floating cells were aspirated, and adherent cells were removed from the plate using EDTA (25 mm) in trypsin. Floating and adherent cells were combined, washed in PBS, and spun (Cytospin 3, Thermo Shandon, 1200 rpm, 5 min) onto glass coverslips (Curtin Matheson Scientific, Inc., Baltimore, MD, 24 × 40 mm). The cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde (5 min, 20 °C), washed in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS (20 °C), and incubated with anti-cytochrome c antibody (0.5 mg/ml) (PharMingen) diluted 1:100 in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS (16 h, 4 °C). The cells were washed four times in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS (15 min each), incubated with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1.5 mg/ml) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) diluted 1:50 in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS (60 min, 37 °C), and washed again as above. The slides were mounted with 1,4-diazabicyclo (2,2,2)-octane (1 mg/ml) (Sigma) in gelvatol. Cytochrome c release was assessed with confocal laser microscopy. Photos were obtained with an LSM 510 argon/helium laser confocal microscope using a ×100 Plan-Neofluar® objective (Zeiss). The excitation wavelength for rhodamine was 543 nm. A long pass filter (585 nm) was used to measure rhodamine emission. Cells were counted as having released cytochrome c if there was a loss of punctate staining. Results are expressed as cells releasing cytochrome c as the percentage of total cells counted (∼100 cells). Immunohistochemistry for the Examination of Bax Activation and Localization—Measurement of Bax activation was performed using a modification of a previously described method (24Karbowski M. Lee Y.J. Gaume B. Jeong S.Y. Frank S. Nechushtan A. Santel A. Fuller M. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Alveolar epithelial cells were cultured onto microscope slides (Fisher Scientific, product number 12-540 22 × 22 mm) in 35-mm tissue culture plates and placed into experimental conditions. When the cell plates were removed from experimental conditions, the medium was aspirated from each plate and replaced with MitoTracker Red CMXRos (1 μm) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in medium (30 min, 37 °C). The cells were fixed with cold acetone:methanol (1:1) (4 min, -20 °C), permeabilized with a 0.1% Triton, 0.05% deoxycholate solution in PBS (20 min, 20 °C), and then blocked with a 0.1% Triton, 3% bovine serum albumin solution in PBS (45 min, 20 °C). The cells were then incubated with mouse anti-Bax antibody (0.5 mg/ml) (PharMingen) diluted 1:100 in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS (16 h, 4 °C). The cells were then washed four times in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS (15 min each), incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (2 mg/ml) (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:50 in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS (1 h, 37 °C) and washed again as above. The coverslips were mounted with 1,4-diazabicyclo (2,2,2)-octane (1 mg/ml) (Sigma) in gelvatol. Measurement of Bax Activation and Localization with the Mitochondrial Membrane—Bax activation was assessed with confocal laser microscopy. Photos were obtained with an LSM 510 argon/helium laser confocal microscope using a ×100 Plan-Neofluar® objective (Zeiss) with a pinhole of 1.0 Airy units. The excitation wavelengths for MitoTracker Red CMXRos and Alexa Fluor 488 were 543 and 488 nm, respectively. A long pass filter (585 nm) was used to measure MitoTracker emission, and a band pass filter (505-530 nm) was used to measure Alexa Fluor 488 emission. Gains for both fluorophores were set using the untreated normoxic cells. Images in all other conditions were obtained using the identical microscope settings. To determine whether activated Bax staining localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane, the gains for both fluorophores were adjusted in each experimental condition to allow detection of activated Bax in weakly staining cells and to prevent saturation in intensely staining cells. Single dimension confocal images (line plots) were obtained from these images by selecting arbitrary 20-μm lines in the cytoplasm of multiple cells using the Zeiss LSM Image Examiner software (24Karbowski M. Lee Y.J. Gaume B. Jeong S.Y. Frank S. Nechushtan A. Santel A. Fuller M. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Retroviral Transformation of MLE-12 Cells—The high capacity retroviral packaging cell line PA67 (Clontech) at 60-70% confluence was transfected in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), 20 mm HEPES, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum) with plasmid DNA encoding puromycin resistance or puromycin resistance and Bcl-XL according to the manufacturer's instructions (10 μg of DNA, 5 μl of Miris transfection reagent in 500 μl of serum-free medium per plate with choloroquine (25 μm) × 24 h). The cells were then washed with PBS, and medium containing serum was added for 24 h. The medium was then harvested and filtered (0.45 μm filter), polybrene (8 μg/ml) was added, and the medium was transferred to the MLE-12 cells (ATCC). After 48 h, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified essential medium (supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), 20 mm HEPES, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum) with puromycin (1 μg/ml). Overexpression of Bcl-XL was confirmed by immunoblotting. Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (10Budinger G.R. Tso M. McClintock D.S. Dean D.A. Sznajder J.I. Chandel N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15654-15660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Cell lysates (20 μg) were mixed with sample loading buffer (125 mm Tris base (pH 6.8), 4% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue). After heating, the protein was resolved on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-15% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). After transfer, the gel was stained with Ponceau S to verify uniform loading and transfer. Membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat milk in TBS-T (100 mm Tris base (pH 7.5), 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) for 2 h at room temperature and subsequently incubated with anti-Bcl-XL antibody (0.2 mg/ml) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) diluted 1:1000 overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed three times with TBS-T and incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (0.5 mg/ml) (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA) diluted 1:1000 in 5% (w/v) nonfat milk in TBS-T. The membrane was washed three times with TBS-T and analyzed by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Statistical Analysis—One-way analysis of variance was used to test for significant differences in measured variables between groups. Where the F statistic indicated a significant difference, individual differences were explored using the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Statistical significance was determined at the 0.05 level. ROS Are Required for Hyperoxia-induced Cell Death in Primary Alveolar Epithelial Cells—We and others have demonstrated that exposure to hyperoxia results in the generation of reactive oxygen species (5Freeman B.A. Crapo J.D.

We sought to determine whether the generation of ROS was required for hyperoxia-induced cell death. Primary rat alveolar epithelial cells were exposed to hyperoxia or normoxia for 24 h in the presence or absence of EUK-134 (20 μm). After 24 h, the administration of EUK-134 completely abolished the depletion of reduced glutathione observed in untreated cells during exposure to hyperoxia (Fig. 1A). We then sought to determine whether the generation of ROS was required for cell death in primary rat alveolar epithelial cells following exposure to hyperoxia. After 48 h, over 80% of control cells had died as determined by LDH release, whereas cells treated with EUK-134 (20 μm) had levels of death similar to normoxic controls (Fig. 1B). In cells that are susceptible to hyperoxia, the morphology of the dead cells has been reported to be either apoptotic or necrotic depending on the cell type examined (12Kazzaz J.A. Horowitz S. Li Y. Mantell L.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 887 (164-170): 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26Barazzone C. White C.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Sci. 1999; 887: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To determine whether hyperoxia-induced apoptosis required the generation of ROS, cellular morphology following exposure to hyperoxia was examined using DAPI staining. Alveolar epithelial cells exposed to hyperoxia demonstrated typical morphological changes of apoptosis with small, intensely fluorescent nuclei on DAPI staining (Fig. 1, C and D). These changes were completely prevented by treatment with EUK-134 (20 μm). Collectively, these results show that ROS are required for hyperoxia-induced cell death in primary alveolar epithelial cells. ROS Are Required for Bax Activation following Exposure to Hyperoxia in Primary Alveolar Epithelial Cells—Previously, we have shown that cells lacking Bax and Bak are resistant to hyperoxia-induced cell death (10Budinger G.R.

These results suggest that hyperoxic cell death occurs through a mitochondrial-dependent pathway. In many models of mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis (e.g. growth factor withdrawal, the administration of some chemotherapeutic agents), the generation of ROS occurs following mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (14Chen Q. Chai Y.C. Mazumder S. Jiang C. Macklis R.M. Chisolm G.M. Almasan A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 16Cai J. Jones D.P. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 5680-5689Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In these models, antioxidants delay cell death but fail to prevent it. In other models of mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis, for example, exposure to ionizing radiation, ROS act upstream to cause the activation of Bax or Bak (13Kirkland R.A. Windelborn J.A. Kasprzak J.M. Franklin J.L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6480-6490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Chen Q. Chai Y.C. Mazumder S. Jiang C. Macklis R.M. Chisolm G.M. Almasan A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether ROS acted upstream of Bax activation in hyperoxia-induced cell death. Primary rat alveolar epithelial cells were exposed to hyperoxia (32 h) or staurosporine (10 μm) (6 h) in the presence or absence of EUK-134 (20 μm) and then stained with an antibody that recognizes an epitope on the N terminus of the Bax molecule, which is exposed only when Bax is activated. Exposure of primary alveolar epithelial cells to hyperoxia or staurosporine resulted in Bax activation. The administration of EUK-134 prevented Bax activation in response to hyperoxia but not in response to staurosporine (Fig. 2). These results suggest that EUK-134 prevents hyperoxia but not staurosporine-induced cell death upstream of the activation of Bax. Activated Bax Localizes to the Mitochondrial Membrane— During mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis, activated Bax forms oligomers that permeabilize the outer mitochondrial membrane (8Puthalakath H. Strasser A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). To determine whether Bax activation occurred at the mitochondrial membrane, we co-stained the cells with MitoTracker Red following 32 h of exposure to normoxia or hyperoxia or exposure to staurosporine (10 μm) for 6 h. Line plots of activated Bax and MitoTracker Red were made through random sections of the cytoplasm, and representative plots are displayed in Fig. 3. In all conditions where Bax was activated, staining for activated Bax colocalized with MitoTracker Red staining. ROS Are Required for Cytochrome c Release following Exposure to Hyperoxia in Primary Alveolar Epithelial Cells—The activation of Bax or Bak triggers apoptosis by causing the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytosol (28Kuwana T. Mackey M.R. Perkins G. Ellisman M.H. Latterich M. Schneiter R. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 331-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). If ROS are acting upstream of Bax activation to induce cell death in alveolar epithelial cells, EUK-134 would be expected to prevent mitochondrial cytochrome c release. To test this hypothesis, we examined cytochrome c staining in primary cultures of rat alveolar epithelial cells following exposure to normoxia, hyperoxia (32 h), or staurosporine (10 μm, 6 h) in the presence or absence of EUK-134 (20 μm). The administration of Euk-134 prevented hyperoxia but not staurosporine-induced cytochrome c release (Fig. 4). These results are consistent with ROS acting upstream of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization following exposure to hyperoxia. The Overexpression of Bcl-XL Prevents Hyperoxia-induced Cell Death in Mouse Lung Epithelial Cells—Cell death in response to stimuli that require the activation of Bax or Bak to induce mitochondrial membrane permeabilization can be prevented upstream of Bax activation by the overexpression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins Bcl-XL or Bcl-2 (29Letai A. Bassik M.C. Walensky L.D. Sorcinelli M.D. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S.J. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). To determine whether Bax activation was required for cell death following exposure to hyperoxia, we generated mouse lung epithelial cells (MLE-12) stably expressing puromycin resistance and Bcl-XL or a control plasmid encoding puromycin resistance using retroviral constructs (Fig. 5A). These cells were then exposed to hyperoxia for 48 h, after which cell death (LDH release) was measured (Fig. 5B). Following exposure to hyperoxia, cell death was observed in control transfected cells but not in cells overexpressing Bcl-XL. These results indicate that hyperoxia induces cell death through the mitochondrial-dependent pathway. The Overexpression of Bcl-XL Prevents Bax Activation at the Mitochondrial Membrane—A major mechanism by which anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins exert their protective effect is by sequestering Bax or Bak and preventing their activation in response to an apoptotic stimulus (30Cheng E.H. Wei M.C. Weiler S. Flavell R.A. Mak T.W. Lindsten T. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 705-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). To determine the mechanism by which the overexpression of Bcl-XL prevented hyperoxia-induced cell death in lung epithelial cells, we measured Bax activation following exposure to hyperoxia in mouse lung epithelial cells overexpressing puromycin resistance and Bcl-XL or puromycin resistance alone. Following exposure to hyperoxia, Bax activation was observed in control transfected cells but not in cells overexpressing Bcl-XL (Fig. 6). These results confirm the importance of Bax activation in the pathway leading to hyperoxic cell death. The effects of hyperoxia on cellular function and survival have been widely held to be secondary to the generation of ROS. Nevertheless, previous attempts to prevent hyperoxic cell death in vitro using antioxidants have only been partially effective (31Ward N.S. Waxman A.B. Homer R.J. Mantell L.L. Einarsson O. Du Y.

Cells exposed to mitochondrial-dependent death stimuli generate a burst of ROS that occurs near the time of cytochrome c release from the intermembrane space (14Chen Q. Chai Y.C. Mazumder S. Jiang C. Macklis R.M. Chisolm G.M. Almasan A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 16Cai J. Jones D.P. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). This oxidative burst is large and can be attenuated by the administration of caspase inhibitors (14Chen Q. Chai Y.C. Mazumder S. Jiang C. Macklis R.M. Chisolm G.M. Almasan A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 18Ricci J.E. Gottlieb R.A. Green D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Recently, Ricci et al. (18Ricci J.E. Gottlieb R.A. Green D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) reported that the oxidative burst occurring with the release of cytochrome c resulted from caspase-mediated cleavage of complexes I and II of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. We questioned whether ROS acted upstream in the cell death pathway following exposure to hyperoxia or whether they were generated later as a result of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. We found that EUK-134 prevented hyperoxia-induced cell death upstream of cytochrome c release, indicating that ROS act upstream of the mitochondria in this pathway. For the cell to eliminate superoxide anions and other radicals, two sequential reactions are required. Superoxide anions are converted to H2O2 through one of the cellular superoxide dismutases, Mn-superoxide dismutase in the mitochondria and CuZn-superoxide dismutase in the cytosol. H2O2 itself is an important pro-apoptotic molecule and must be metabolized to molecular oxygen and water by catalase (37Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 88: 1880-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 38Tobiume K. Matsuzawa A. Takahashi T. Nishitoh H. Morita K. Takeda K. Minowa O. Miyazono K. Noda T. Ichijo H. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). EUK-134 is both a superoxide dismutase and a catalase mimetic and can therefore detoxify hydroxyl radicals completely. EUK-134 did not act as a nonspecific inhibitor of apoptosis as the administration of EUK-134 did not prevent Bax activation or cytochrome c release in response to staurosporine. Our results are consistent with those of Ilizarov et al. (32Ilizarov A.M. Koo H.C. Kazzaz J.A. Mantell L.L. Li Y. Bhapat R. Pollack S. Horowitz S. Davis J.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 24: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), who recently reported that the overexpression of catalase or superoxide dismutase alone was not as effective as the combination of the two in preventing hyperoxic cell death in a mouse lung epithelial cell line. We reported previously that the combination of a glutathione peroxidase mimetic and a superoxide dismutase mimetic failed to prevent hyperoxia-induced death in fibroblasts. Our findings are similar to those of other investigators who have demonstrated improved protection against oxidant stress with the use of EUK-134 as compared with other antioxidants (19Melov S. Ravenscroft J. Malik S. Gill M.S. Walker D.W. Clayton P.E. Wallace D.C. Malfroy B. Doctrow S.R. Lithgow G.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1567-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis is regulated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins. Members of this family are either pro- or anti-apoptotic and share homology in up to four conserved regions termed BCL-2 holmology (BH) domains (1Olivera W.G. Ridge K.M. Sznajder J.I. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1995; 152: 1229-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 2Crapo J.D. Barry B.E. Foscue H.A. Shelburne J. Am. Rev. Respir.

J. 1972; 128: 617-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar). The anti-apoptotic proteins, which include Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, are all multidomain proteins that share homology throughout all four BH domains. The pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins are divided into those sharing multiple BH3 domains (1Olivera W.G. Ridge K.M. Sznajder J.I. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1995; 152: 1229-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 2Crapo J.D. Barry B.E. Foscue H.A. Shelburne J. Am. Rev. Respir.

Lancet. 1967; 2: 319-323Abstract PubMed Google Scholar), for example, Bax and Bak, and those sharing only the BH3 domain (8Puthalakath H. Strasser A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Studies from cells derived from mice lacking the genes for Bax and Bak demonstrate that all BH3 proteins require the presence of Bax or Bak to induce apoptosis. In response to a mitochondrial-dependent stimulus, Bax or Bak become activated and translocate to the mitochondrial outer membrane. There, they oligomerize, allowing for the release of cytochrome c and other pro-apoptotic molecules into the cytosol. The activation of Bax and release of cytochrome c have been reported to occur nearly simultaneously (28Kuwana T. Mackey M.R. Perkins G. Ellisman M.H. Latterich M. Schneiter R. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 331-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). Previously, we have reported that embryonic fibroblasts from bax-/-/bak-/- mice were protected against hyperoxia-induced cell death and that fibroblasts stably overexpressing Bcl-XL were protected against hyperoxia-induced mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and cell death (10Budinger G.R.

In this report, we extend those observations by demonstrating the activation of Bax in response to hyperoxia at the mitochondrial membrane in primary alveolar epithelial cells and demonstrating that ROS act upstream of Bax activation in this pathway. In accord with our previous report, we found that mouse lung epithelial cells stably overexpressing high levels of Bcl-XL were protected against hyperoxia-induced Bax activation at the mitochondrial membrane and subsequent cell death. Collectively, these findings establish the importance of the Bcl-2 family of proteins as regulators of hyperoxia-induced cell death. Our results indicate that ROS act upstream of Bax activation in the cell death pathway initiated by hyperoxia; however, they do not allow us to draw conclusions about where in the cell ROS are generated. In whole lung homogenates and in endothelial cells, investigators have demonstrated that the mitochondrial generation of ROS increases during exposure to hyperoxia (5Freeman B.A. Crapo J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10986-10992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Sanders S.P. Zweier J.L. Kuppusamy P. Harrison S.J. Bassett D.J. Gabrielson E.W. Sylvester J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It is possible, however, that the ROS generation they observed was occurring after mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. We reported previously that cells lacking mitochondrial DNA (ρ0 cells) had marked attenuation of ROS generation in response to hyperoxia; however, they were not protected against hyperoxia-induced cell death (10Budinger G.R.

These results suggested that the mitochondrial generation of ROS was not required for cell death following exposure to hyperoxia. Using electron spin trapping to measure ROS, Natarajan and coworkers (25Parinandi N.L. Kleinberg M.A. Usatyuk P.V. Cummings R.J. Pennathur A. Cardounel A.J. Zweier J.L. Garcia J.G. Natarajan V. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: L26-L38Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) reported that ROS generation following exposure to hyperoxia in endothelial cells was mediated primarily by the NAD(P)H oxidase system. These results are consistent with results from transgenic animals, which demonstrate only modest protection against hyperoxia-induced lung injury in animals expressing the manganese-superoxide dismutase (localized primarily at the mitochondrial membrane) but more marked protection in animals overexpressing the CuZn-superoxide dismutase (which localizes to the cytosol) (35Wispe J.R. Warner B.B. Clark J.C. Dey C.R. Neuman J. Glasser S.W. Crapo J.D. Chang L.Y. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23937-23941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36White C.W. Avraham K.B. Shanley P.F. Groner Y. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 87: 2162-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Our results do not address the mechanism(s) by which the generation of ROS causes the activation of Bax. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are activated in response to changes in the extracellular or intracellular environment and have been shown to be important in the activation of Bax in response to oxidant stress in neurons (39Putcha G.V. Le S. Frank S. Besirli C.G. Clark K. Chu B. Alix S. Youle R.J. LaMarche A. Maroney A.C. Johnson Jr., E.M. Neuron. 2003; 38: 899-914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Recently, two groups of investigators have demonstrated that cell death in MLE-12 cells required activation of the JNK pathway, suggesting a possible link between ROS generation and Bax activation (40Romashko 3rd, J.

Davis J.M. Kazzaz J.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2003; 29: 779-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we demonstrate that alveolar epithelial cells undergo cell death in response to hyperoxia through a mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway that requires the generation of ROS upstream of Bax activation at the mitochondrial membrane (Fig. 7). The combined superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetic EUK-134 prevents hyperoxia-induced Bax activation, cytochrome c release, and cell death. Overexpression of Bcl-XL protects cells from hyperoxia-induced cell death by preventing the activation of Bax."

It is composed of a self-compartmentalized core protease (CP) that houses the peptidase active sites appended on either or both ends by a regulatory particle (RP) that identifies appropriate substrates and translocates them into the lumen of the CP for breakdown. Here, we describe the molecular and biochemical properties of the 26 S proteasome from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Like the CP and the ATPase ring of the RP, the RP non-ATPase subunits are often encoded by two transcriptionally active genes with some pairs displaying sufficient sequence divergence to suggest functional differences. Most RPN subunits could functionally replace their yeast counterparts, implying that they have retained their positions and activities within the complex. A method was developed to purify the 26 S proteasome intact from whole Arabidopsis seedlings. These preparations are biochemically indistinguishable from those from yeast and mammals, including the need for ATP to maintain integrity and a strong sensitivity to the inhibitors MG115, MG132, lactacystin, and epoxomicin. Mass spectrometric analysis of the complex detected the presence of almost all CP and RP subunits. In many cases, both products of paralogous genes were detected, demonstrating that each isoform assembles into the mature particle. As with the yeast and animal 26 S proteasomes, attenuation of individual RP genes induces a coordinated up-regulation of many of the other 26 S proteasome genes, suggesting that plants contain a negative feedback mechanism to regulate the 26 S proteasome levels. The incorporation of paralogous subunits into the Arabidopsis holoprotease raises the intriguing possibility that plants synthesize multiple 26 S proteasome types with unique properties and/or target specificities.

Vierstra R.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2004; 54 (in press)Google Scholar). In this pathway, proteins targeted for degradation are modified with polymers of Ub by an E1 → E2 → E3 enzymatic cascade; these polyubiquitinated proteins are then recognized and degraded by the 26 S proteasome with the release of the Ubs undigested. Through this conjugation/degradation cycle, the pathway controls much of cell physiology, growth, and development by degrading a multitude of short lived regulators and abnormal polypeptides. Plant responses under its control include the perception of most, if not all, hormones, photomorphogenesis, trichome development, floral homeosis, environmental adaptation, entrainment of circadian rhythms, disease resistance, and senescence, to name a few (3Smalle J. Vierstra R.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2004; 54 (in press)Google Scholar, 4Hellmann H. Estelle M. Science. 2002; 297: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The 26 S proteasome is a ∼2.4-MDa proteolytic complex consisting of a 20 S core protease (CP) capped at one or both ends by a 19 S regulatory particle (RP) (5Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). The CP is a broad spectrum, ATP- and Ub-independent protease. Its cylindrical shape is created by the assembly of the four heptameric rings made from 28 polypeptides. The two peripheral rings are composed of seven related α subunits, and the two central rings are composed of seven related β subunits arranged in a C2-symmetric α1-7β1-7β1-7α1-7 configuration. X-ray crystallographic analyses of the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and bovine CPs revealed that the two β rings form a central chamber that houses the protease active sites provided by the β1, β2, and β5 subunits (6Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar, 7Unno M. Mizushima T. Morimoto Y. Tomisugi Y. Tanaka K. Yasuoka N. Tsukihara T. Structure. 2002; 10: 609-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). These sites have peptidylglutamyl peptidehydrolyzing, trypsin-like, and chymotrypsin-like activities, respectively, that can collectively digest most targets to short peptides. A small channel is formed by each α ring, which restricts access to this chamber such that only the unfolded polypeptides may enter. Flexible N-terminal extensions in several α subunits gate the channel to control substrate entry and presumably product exit (8Groll M. Bajorek M. Kohler A. Moroder L. Rubin D.M. Huber R.

Cell. 2001; 7: 1143-1152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In this way, the CP physically restricts proteolysis to those proteins that are deliberately unfolded and imported. The RP binds to one or both ends of the CP and sits directly over the α-ring channel of the CP (5Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). It contains at least 17 core subunits. More subunits may be present that are either loosely associated or present at substoichiometric levels (10Verma R. Chen S. Feldman R. Schieltz D. Yates J. Dohmen T. Deshaies R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3425-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 11Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Ploegh H. Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The core RP can be further dissociated into lid and base subcomplexes. The base contains a ring of six AAA-ATPases (designated RP triple-A ATPase (RPT) 1-6) that contacts the CP and the RP non-ATPase (RPN) subunits 1, 2, and 10. The remaining RPN subunits (RPN3 and 5-12) assemble to create the lid. The lid shows similarity to the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 and COP9-signalosome (CSN) complexes, suggesting an evolutionary relatedness (12Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Pfeifer G.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7096-7107Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To date, little is known about the three-dimensional structure of the RP except for low resolution microscopic images (14Walz J. Erdmann A. Kania M. Typke D. Koster A.J. Baumeister W. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and a protein interaction map that identifies a number of intermolecular contacts (13Fu H. Reis N. Lee Y. Glickman M.H. Vierstra R.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7096-7107Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Collectively, the RP assists in recognizing appropriate substrates, especially those containing the poly(Ub) tag, unfolding them, removing the attached Ubs, opening the α-ring gate, and then directing the unfolded polypeptides into the lumen of the CP for breakdown (5Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). At present, the function(s) of only a portion of the core RP subunits are known or proposed. All but two of the RP subunits (RPN9 and -10) are essential in yeast (15Takeuchi J. Fujimuro M. Yokosawa H. Tanaka K. Toh-e A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6575-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16van Nocker S. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. Fu H. Coux O. Wefes I. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6020-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The RPT ring presumably uses ATP hydrolysis to facilitate channel opening and target unfolding (9Kohler A. Cascio P. Leggett D.S. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1143-1152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Additional functions are likely, considering that specific RPT subunits interact with poly(Ub) chains (17Lam Y.A. Lawson T.G. Velayutham M. Zweier J.L. Pickart C.M. Nature. 2002; 416: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) and a variety of other non-RP proteins, including E3s (18Xie Y. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2497-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). RPN11 is a metalloprotease capable of disassembling poly(Ub) chains from the proximal end and thus appears to encourage Ub recycling (19Yao T. Cohen R.E. Nature. 2002; 419: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 20Verma R. Aravind L. Oania R. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. Koonin E.V. Deshaies R.J. Science. 2002; 298: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). RPN1 can bind Ub-like sequences that might help shuttle substrates to the 26 S proteasome (21Elsasser S. Gali R.R. Schwickart M. Larsen C.N. Leggett D.S. Muller B. Feng M.T. Tubing F. Dittmar G.A. Finley D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). RPN10 helps tether the lid to the base using an N-terminal von Willebrand factor A-like domain as the interaction site (13Fu H. Reis N. Lee Y. Glickman M.H. Vierstra R.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7096-7107Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). It also contains a C-terminal Ub interaction motif (UIM) that binds poly(Ub) chains and thus may function as a Ub receptor (22Fu H. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. van Nocker S. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1970-1981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The function(s) of the remaining RPN subunits are unknown. Some appear to target specific functions, possibly by recruiting specific E3s or carrier proteins that deliver ubiquitinated cargoes or by interacting directly with targets (23Bailly E. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6872-6890Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 24Smalle J. Kurepa J. Yang P. Babiychuk E. Kushnir S. Durski A. Vierstra R.D. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 17-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Whereas yeast assembles a single 26 S proteasome complex from a unigene set of RP and CP genes (12Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M.

Cell. 1998; 94: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar), metazoans can assemble multiple types of proteasomes by integrating distinct isoforms for one or more subunits or by differential post-translational modifications. For example, at least five CP types have been detected in mammalian cells (25Haass C. Kloetzel P.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 180: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 26Dahlmann B. Ruppert T. Kuehn L. Merforth S. Kloetzel P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 643-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The most distinct is the immunoproteasome, which is created in major histocompatibility complex class I antigen-presenting cells, by substituting the three active site subunits, β1, β2, and β5, of the CP with homologs (27DeMartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22123-22126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 28Kloetzel P.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Integration of the alternative β subunits changes the catalytic specificity of the CP to release peptides more suitable for antigen presentation. Changes in CP subunit composition have also been observed during Drosophila embryogenesis (25Haass C. Kloetzel P.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 180: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Whereas some differences reflect posttranslation modification by phosphorylation (29Satoh K. Sasajima H. Nyoumura K. Yokosawa K. Sawada H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 30Rivett A.J. Bose S. Brooks P. Broadfoot K.I. Biochimie. 2001; 83: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), others may reflect the incorporation of new subunit isoforms (31Yuan X.Q. Miller M. Belote J.M. Genetics. 1996; 144: 147-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar situation may exist in plants. The genomes of both Arabidopsis and rice contain gene pairs for many CP and RP subunits (24Smalle J. Kurepa J. Yang P. Babiychuk E. Kushnir S. Durski A. Vierstra R.D. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 17-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 32Fu H. Doelling J.H. Arendt C.S. Hochstrasser M. Vierstra R.D.

Kawasaki H. Hirano H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1474-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For example, all but PAG (α7), PBA (β1), PBF (β6), and PBG (β7) of the CP and RPT3 of the AAA-ATPase ring are encoded by two Arabidopsis genes. Whereas some of these pairs are nearly identical, others display enough structural divergence (e.g. RPN12a and -b (24Smalle J. Kurepa J. Yang P. Babiychuk E. Kushnir S. Durski A. Vierstra R.D. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 17-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar)) to suggest that different activities are possible. In previous studies, we defined the subunit organization of the CP and the RPT ring of the RP from the Arabidopsis 26 S proteasome (32Fu H. Doelling J.H. Arendt C.S. Hochstrasser M. Vierstra R.D. Genetics. 1998; 149: 677-692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Fu H. Doelling J.H. Rubin D.M. Vierstra R.D. Plant J. 1999; 18: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Many of these subunits could functionally replace their yeast counterparts, indicating that they are structurally and probably functionally analogous. Here, we completed an analysis of the remaining subunits of the Arabidopsis core RP with a molecular characterization of the RPN genes and proteins. Like the CP and RPT subunits, most RPN subunits are encoded by two genes that are each transcriptionally active. The expression of these genes, as well as those for the CP and RPT subunits, is up-regulated in mutants that attenuate the activity of other 26 S proteasome subunits, indicating that Arabidopsis, like yeast (35Xie Y. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3056-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) and animals (36Meiners S. Heyken D. Weller A. Ludwig A. Stangl K. Kloetzel P.M. Kruger E.

Chem. 2002; 277: 6188-6197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), contains a mechanism to increase 26 S proteasome levels to meet demand. We developed a method to purify the 26 S proteasome intact from Arabidopsis seedlings. Mass spectrometric (MS) analysis of its composition revealed that the Arabidopsis 26 S proteasome is not a single particle but actually a heterogeneous collection assembled using both paralogs for duplicated CP and RP subunits. Such diversity raises an intriguing possibility that plants synthesize multiple 26 S proteasome types that each may have unique properties and/or targets. Identification and Isolation of Arabidopsis RPN Genes—The RPN nucleotide sequences, including genomic, full-length, and partial cDNA and EST sequences, were identified by BLAST searches (38Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) of the A. thaliana (ecotype Columbia Col-0) DNA data base (available on the World Wide Web at www.arabidopsis.org) using the peptide sequences of the yeast RPN subunits as queries. For RPN1a, -1b, -6, -7, -11, and -12a, full-length cDNAs were obtained from the EST collection at the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Ohio State University). For RPN2a, -2b, -3a, -5a, -5b, -8a, -8b, -9a, -9b, and -12b, full-length cDNAs were isolated by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) from the Kieber and Ecker size-selected cDNA libraries (Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center stock number CD4-13, CD4-14, or CD4-15). The coding region for RPN3b was derived from comparison of the genomic sequence with a previously available cDNA (accession number AY057508). The gene organizations of RPN10 and RPN12a were described previously (24Smalle J. Kurepa J. Yang P. Babiychuk E. Kushnir S. Durski A. Vierstra R.D.

Protein domains were identified using SMART version 3.5, InterPro version 6.0, and Pfam version 8.0 (European Bioinformatics Institute; www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/index.html) and ScanProsite (ExPASy Molecular Biology Server; tw.expasy.org). Yeast Complementation—Yeast RPN genes, including promoter and termination sequences, were amplified from DF5 (MATa) genomic DNA by PCR using PfuTurbo (Stratagene) and primers designed to add appropriate restriction sites to the 5′ and 3′ ends. After digestion with the corresponding restriction enzymes, the products were inserted into pRS316 (40Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that was digested similarly. For RPN2a, -5a, -6, and -12a, the restricted fragments were subsequently inserted into pRS425 (41Christianson A.M. King D.L. Hatzivassiliou E. Casas J.E. Hallenbeck P.L. Nikodem V.M. Mitsialis S.A.

For RPN3a, -7, -8a, -9a, and -11, the coding regions and the 3′ untranslated sequences were reamplified by PCR and inserted into pRS425-v downstream of the yeast RPN10 promoter. The pRS425-v was engineered from pRS425 to contain a 570-bp proximal fragment of the yeast Rpn10 promoter separated by a NdeI site from a partial yeast Rpn10 coding region, all of which is bracketed by SacII restriction sites (22Fu H.

All Arabidopsis RPN genes (except RPN3a), including coding and 3′ untranslated sequences, were amplified from appropriate cDNAs or cDNA libraries by PCR using PfuTurbo and primers designed to add NdeI and another appropriate site to the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The fragments were inserted into pRS425-v to allow expression of the cDNA from the yeast Rpn10 promoter. Arabidopsis RPN3a was PCR-amplified from its cDNA and inserted into pADCT (13Fu H. Reis N.

(Huntsville, AL) or the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The strains were transformed with pRS316-derived plasmids (Ura3/Cen6) harboring wild-type yeast RPN genes and sporulated to establish a set of haploid yeast chromosomal deletions harboring the corresponding wild-type RPN genes in pRS316. The Arabidopsis or yeast RPN genes in the 2-μm LEU2-based plasmid (pRS425, pRS425-v, or pADCT) were tested for complementation using a 5-fluoroortic acid-plasmid-shuffling procedure as described previously (33Fu H. Doelling J.H. Rubin D.M. Vierstra R.D. Plant J. 1999; 18: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Because yeast rpn9Δ strains are viable (15Takeuchi J. Fujimuro M. Yokosawa H. Tanaka K. Toh-e A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 6575-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the heterozygous deletion mutant was sporulated before transformation to obtain isogenic haploid wild-type and deletion strains. Yeast-rich (YPD) and selection synthetic media (SD) were prepared as described (33Fu H. Doelling J.H. Rubin D.M. Vierstra R.D. Plant J. 1999; 18: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 26 S Proteasome Purification—A. thaliana (ecotype Columbia, Col-0) was grown in liquid GM (Invitrogen) at 20 °C under continuous light. After 10 days of growth, whole seedlings were washed, frozen to liquid nitrogen temperature, pulverized with a mortar and pestle, and stored at -80 °C. The powder was homogenized in 1.25 ml/g fresh weight of extraction buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6), 2 mm MgCl2, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 10 mm ATP, 5% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.6% sodium metabisulfite, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.8% plant protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) just before use. All subsequent steps were performed at 0-4 °C. The extract was filtered through four layers of cheesecloth and two layers of Miracloth and clarified at 30,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was made 2% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 (Sigma), additional 1 mm ATP was added, and the mixture was stirred for 30 min and reclarified at 30,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was made 10% (w/v) PEG 8000 and stirred for 30 min, and the 26 S proteasome-containing precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in extraction buffer supplemented with 2 mm ATP, clarified, and fractionated on a 6-ml Uno Q6 (Bio-Rad) anion exchange column using a 240-ml 0-1 m KCl gradient in extraction buffer with 2 mm ATP. Fractions (3 ml) containing the 26 S proteasome activity eluted between 260 and 280 mm KCl were pooled and reprecipitated with 10% (w/v) PEG 8000. The pellet was resuspended in the extraction buffer containing 20% glycerol and 2 mm ATP and further resolved by size exclusion FPLC using a 24-ml Superose HR6 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) with a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. Peak fractions (0.5 ml) of 26 S proteasome activity were pooled and stored at -80 °C. 26 S Proteasome Peptidase Assay—Fractions (10 μl) were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min with 90 μl of 50 μm succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Suc-LLVY-AMC; Sigma) in 80 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). The reaction was quenched by adding 1 ml of 80 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.3). Released AMC was monitored by fluorescence using excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 440 nm, respectively. Data were plotted in arbitrary fluorescence units per 10 μl of fraction, using free AMC (Sigma) as a standard. MG115 (Ac-Leu-Leu-Nle-al), MG132 (benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Leu-al), epoxomicin (Ac(Me)-Ile-Ile-Thr-Leu-EX) (A.G. Scientific, San Diego, CA), and clastolactacystin β-lactone (lactacystin) (Sigma) were dissolved in Me2SO before use. Antibody Production—The RPN1a coding region was PCR-amplified from the full-length cDNA clone H9G1 (www.arabidopsis.org) using primers GTTACTGTACATATGGCTCCAACTCAGGAT and AGCTCT-CTCCTCGAGCTCCTCTCTGTAGTCTGG designed to contain 5′- and 3′-flanking NdeI and XhoI sites, respectively. Upon NdeI/XhoI digestion, this product was cloned into pET28b (Novagen, Madison, WI). The RPN11 coding region was amplified from the full-length cDNA clone AY091329 and inserted into EcoRI/NcoI sites of pET30c. Both proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) following induction with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and collected from the insoluble fraction by centrifugation. The pellet was dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and purified by preparative SDS-PAGE. The portions of the gel containing RPN1a or RPN11 (visualized by Coomassie Blue staining) were excised, emulsified, and injected directly into rabbits (Polyclonal Antibody Service, Madison, WI).

It facilitates uptake of low density lipoproteins by macrophages, resulting in foam cell formation. However, it is not known whether ASMC express CXCR6, the receptor for CXCL16, or whether CXCL16 affects ASMC biology. To dissect the biological and signal transduction pathways elicited by CXCL16, human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) were treated with pharmacological inhibitors or transiently transfected with pathway-specific dominant-negative or kinase-dead expression vectors prior to the addition of CXCL16. HASMC expressed CXCR6 at basal conditions. Exposure of HASMC to CXCL16 increased NF-κB DNA binding activity, induced κB-driven luciferase activity, and up-regulated tumor necrosis factor-α expression in an NF-κB-dependent manner. However, treatment with pertussis toxin (Gi inhibitor), wortmannin or LY294002 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K inhibitors)), or Akt inhibitor or overexpression of dominant-negative (dn) PI3Kγ, dnPDK-1, kinase-dead (kd) Akt, kdIKK-β, dnIKK-γ, dnIκB-α, or dnIκB-β significantly attenuated CXCL16-induced NF-κB activation. Furthermore, CXCL16 increased cell-cell adhesion and induced cellular proliferation in an NF-κB-dependent manner. In conclusion, CXCL16 is a potent and direct activator of NF-κB and induces κB-dependent proinflammatory gene transcription. CXCL16-mediated NF-κB activation occurred via heterotrimeric G proteins, PI3K, PDK-1, Akt, and IκB kinase (IKK). CXCL16 induced IκB phosphorylation and degradation. Most importantly, CXCL16 increased cell-cell adhesion and induced κB-dependent ASMC proliferation, indicating that CXCL16 may play an important role in the development and progression of atherosclerotic vascular disease.

CXCL16 is a member of the CXC chemokine subfamily. Unlike other members of this subgroup, CXCL16 is structurally different and has four distinct domains: a chemokine domain tethered to the cell surface via a mucin-like stack, which in turn is attached to transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (1Wilbanks A.

Treatment with CXCL16 (up to 500 ng/ml) for up to 48 h did not induce cell death, as evidenced by trypan blue dye exclusion. To determine the role of heterotrimeric G proteins, PI3K, PDK-1, and Akt, in CXCL16 signal transduction, ASMCs were transiently transfected with dnPI3Kγ, kdPDK-1, or kdAkt or pretreated for 1 h with pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml in PBS), wortmannin (a specific PI3K inhibitor; 50 nm in Me2SO), LY294002 (a specific PI3K inhibitor; 20 μm in Me2SO), Akt inhibitor (1 μm in Me2SO), PBS, or Me2SO prior to the addition of CXCL16. To determine whether CXCL16 mediates NF-κB activation via free radical generation, ASMCs were pretreated for 1 h with pyrrolidinecarbodithioc acid ammonium salt (PDTC; 100 μm in PBS; Sigma), a free radical scavenger, or MG-132 (5 μm in Me2SO; Calbiochem-Novabiochem), a proteasome inhibitor, prior to CXCL16 addition. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—NF-κB DNA binding activity was measured by EMSA as described previously (14Chandrasekar B. Mummidi S. Perla R.P. Bysani S. Dulin N.O. Liu F. Melby P.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 547-558Google Scholar, 15Chandrasekar B. Melby P.C. Sarau H.M. Raveendran M. Perla R.P. Marelli-Berg F.M. Dulin N.O. Singh I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4675-4686Google Scholar). Transient Cell Transfections and Reporter Assays—ASMCs were transfected with dominant-negative (dn) or kinase-dead (kd) expression vectors using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) essentially as described previously (14Chandrasekar B. Mummidi S. Perla R.P. Bysani S. Dulin N.O. Liu F. Melby P.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 547-558Google Scholar, 15Chandrasekar B. Melby P.C. Sarau H.M. Raveendran M. Perla R.P. Marelli-Berg F.M. Dulin N.O. Singh I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4675-4686Google Scholar). The phosphorylation-deficient mutant of IκB-α (pCMX-IκB-α (S32A/S36A)), dnIκB-β (pCMV-Tag3B-IκB-β (S19A/S32A)-Myc), dnIKK-γ (pcDNA3-IKK-γ-HA), kdPDK-1 (pcDNA3.1-PDK-1-(K114G)-Myc-HisA+), kdIKK-β (pRK5-IKK-β-FLAG), and dnIKK-γ (pcDNA3-IKK-γ-HA) have been described previously (14Chandrasekar B. Mummidi S. Perla R.P. Bysani S. Dulin N.O. Liu F. Melby P.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 547-558Google Scholar, 15Chandrasekar B. Melby P.C. Sarau H.M. Raveendran M. Perla R.P. Marelli-Berg F.M. Dulin N.O. Singh I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4675-4686Google Scholar). dnPI3Kγ (pcDNA3-p110γ-K833R) was a gift from Dr. M. P. Wymann (University of Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland). kdAkt (pcDNA.A+-Akt-K179A, T308A, S473A) was obtained from Dr. Lester Liu (University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX). Corresponding empty vectors were used as controls. To compensate for variations in transfection, the cells were co-transfected with pRL-Renilla luciferase vector (pRL-TK vector; Promega, Madison, WI). Transfection efficiency of ASMCs was determined using pEGFP-N1 and found to be 34.8%±2.13. siRNA for TACE (sense, 5′-AGUUUGCUUGGCACACCUUdTdT-3′, 5′-AGUAAGGCCCAGGAGUGUUdTdT-3′, 5′-CAUAGAGCCACUUUGGAGAdTdTTACE-3′; used at a ratio of 1:1:1) and ADAM12 (sense, 5′-CCUCGCUGCAAAGAAUGUGdTdT-3′) was described previously (16Gschwind A. Hart S. Fischer O.M. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2411-2421Google Scholar). Analysis of mRNA Expression—RT-PCR was performed using DNase (RQ1 RNase-free DNase, Promega)-treated total RNA and the following gene-specific primers: CXCR6 (GenBank™ accession number AF007545, 763 bp); sense, 5′-CTGGTGGTGTTTGTCTGTGG-3′ (bases 196–215), antisense, 5′-GGCTGACAAAGGCATAGAGC-3′ (bases 939–958); ADAM12 (GenBank™ accession number NM_021641.1, 479 bp), sense, 5′-GGCAAAGTCTCGAAGAGTTC-3′ (bases 1993–2012), antisense, 5′-AGCAAGAAGACACAGGATGGT-3′ (bases 2472–2452); and GAPDH (GenBank™ accession number BT006893.1, 442 bp), sense, 5′-ATCACTGCCACCCAGAAGAC-3′ (bases 541–560), antisense, 5′-ATGAGGTCCACCACCCTGTT-3′ (bases 983–964). No amplification was observed when reverse transcriptase was replaced with water during cDNA synthesis or when cDNA was replaced with water during PCR. TNF-α mRNA expression was analyzed by RNase protection assay using RiboQuant RNase protection assay kit (PharMingen) (17Troyer D.A. Chandrasekar B. Barnes J.L. Fernandes G. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1997; 108: 58-62Google Scholar). The template antisense 32P-labeled cRNA probes were specific for hTNF-α (unprotected 436 nucleotides, protected 407 nucleotides; Pharmingen). hGAPDH (124 unprotected and 96 protected nucleotides) served as an internal control, with results expressed as a ratio of the specific gene to the corresponding hGAPDH mRNA. Western Blotting, ELISA, and FACS Analysis—Extraction of protein homogenates, Western blotting, autoradiography, and densitometry were performed as described previously (14Chandrasekar B. Mummidi S. Perla R.P. Bysani S. Dulin N.O. Liu F. Melby P.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 547-558Google Scholar, 15Chandrasekar B. Melby P.C. Sarau H.M. Raveendran M. Perla R.P. Marelli-Berg F.M. Dulin N.O. Singh I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4675-4686Google Scholar). β-Actin was used as an internal control. TNF-α levels in culture supernatants were determined using human Quantikine colorimetric sandwich ELISA (R&D Systems). Surface expression of CXCR6 was analyzed by FACS analysis. Measurement of PI 3-Kinase and Akt Kinase Activities—PI 3-kinase lipid kinase assays were performed in p110γ immunoprecipitates essentially as described previously (14Chandrasekar B. Mummidi S. Perla R.P. Bysani S. Dulin N.O. Liu F. Melby P.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 547-558Google Scholar). Akt kinase activity in ASMCs was performed using a commercially available kit (Cell Signaling Technology); this assay is based on Akt-induced phosphorylation of glycogen synthase-3 (GSK-3) (14Chandrasekar B. Mummidi S. Perla R.P. Bysani S. Dulin N.O. Liu F. Melby P.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 547-558Google Scholar). Cell Proliferation, Cell Adhesion, and Cell Death Detection—Cell proliferation was assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation as well as MTT reduction assay (cell proliferation kit; Roche Applied Science) (14Chandrasekar B. Mummidi S. Perla R.P. Bysani S. Dulin N.O. Liu F. Melby P.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 547-558Google Scholar). Cell death was analyzed by Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS kit (Roche Applied Science). S-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine (SNAP; 500 μm in ethanol), a nitric oxide donor, was used as a positive control (14Chandrasekar B. Mummidi S. Perla R.P. Bysani S. Dulin N.O. Liu F. Melby P.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 547-558Google Scholar). To determine the role of NF-κB in CXCL16-mediated cellular proliferation, HASMC were transfected with expression vectors for human p65 or IKK-α siRNA (Imgenex, San Diego, CA). Vector containing scrambled siRNA (IMG-800–6) was used as a control. Cells were transfected with 3 μg of plasmid using LipofectAMINEPLUS. 3 days later, cells were treated with CXCL16 for 5 days. Knockdown of p65 and IKK-α was confirmed by Western blotting using primary antibodies supplied by the manufacturer. Cell adhesion assays were performed using a commercially available kit (Vybrant cell adhesion assay kit; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (14Chandrasekar B. Mummidi S. Perla R.P. Bysani S. Dulin N.O. Liu F. Melby P.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 547-558Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Comparisons between controls and various treatments were performed for measures of NF-κB DNA binding activity, NF-κB-driven luciferase activity, mRNA and protein levels, cell proliferation, cell death, and cell adhesion by analysis of variance with post hoc Dunnett's t tests. All assays were performed at least three times, and the error bars in the figures indicate the S.E. Human ASMC Express CXCR6 —It is not known whether HASMC express CXCR6. Using gene-specific primers, we have analyzed total RNA isolated from ASMC by RT-PCR. Our results indicate that ASMC express CXCR6 at basal conditions (Fig. 1A). These results were further confirmed by FACS analysis that revealed surface expression of CXCR6 on ASMC (Fig. 1B). CXCL16 Activates NF-κB DNA Binding Activity and Induces κB-driven Luciferase Activity—CXCL16 and fractalkine are the two known transmembrane chemokines described so far. We have demonstrated previously that fractalkine is a potent inducer of NF-κB activation in ASMC (14Chandrasekar B. Mummidi S. Perla R.P. Bysani S. Dulin N.O. Liu F. Melby P.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 547-558Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether CXCL16 exerts similar biological effects in HASMC. Fig. 1C shows an EMSA and indicates that HASMC express low levels of NF-κB at basal conditions, and treatment with rhCXCL16 (50 ng/ml) increases its activation. An increase in NF-κB DNA binding activity was detected at 30 min. Its levels peaked at 1 h, persisted at high levels up to 4 h, and decreased gradually by 48 h (Fig. 1C). Fig. 1D is a dose-response study and shows peak levels of NF-κB activation at 50 ng/ml. No further increase in NF-κB activation was detected when CXCL16 concentrations were increased to 100 ng/ml. Therefore, in all subsequent EMSAs, CXCL16 was used at 50 ng/ml for 1 h. We further confirmed our EMSA results in transient cell transfection assays using pNF-κB-Luc that contained five tandem repeats of NF-κB binding elements upstream of firefly luciferase. When compared with pEGFP-Luc-transfected controls, treatment with CXCL16 significantly increased κB-driven luciferase activity (6.8-fold, p < 0.001; Fig. 1E). CXCL16 Signals via Heterotrimeric G Proteins, PI3K, Akt, and IKK—In the next series of experiments, we investigated possible signal transduction pathways involved in CXCL16-mediated NF-κB activation. At first, we verified whether CXCL16 transduces signals via heterotrimeric G proteins. In fact, treatment with pertussis toxin significantly attenuated CXCL16-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 2D) and κB-driven luciferase activity (Fig. 2E). Because G-protein-coupled receptors transduce signals via diverse signaling pathways including activation of PI3K and Akt (see Ref. 23Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Google Scholar), we explored the role of PI3K and Akt in CXCL16-mediated NF-κB activation. Although treatment with CXCL16 increased PI3K activity in p110γ immunoprecipitates (5.1-fold; p < 0.001 versus untreated controls), both pertussis toxin (p < 0.01) and wortmannin (p < 0.005) inhibited its activation (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained when LY294002 was used (data not shown), indicating that CXCL16 signals via heterotrimeric G proteins/PI3K. We next studied the effects of CXCL16 on activation of Akt, a downstream signaling molecule to PI3K. Fig. 2B shows that CXCL16 indeed induced Akt activation as evidenced by increased p-Akt (Thr308) levels. In addition, CXCL16 increased Akt kinase activity, as seen by increased phospho-GSK-3α/β (Ser21/Ser9) levels (Fig. 2C), and both wortmannin and Akt inhibitor attenuated Akt activation (Fig. 2B) and Akt kinase activity (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, treatment with wortmannin, Akt inhibitor, or overexpression of dnPI3Kγ, kdPDK-1, kdAkt attenuated CXCL16-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 2D) and κB-driven luciferase activity (Fig. 2E), indicating that CXCL16 signals via heterotrimeric G proteins/PI3K/PDK-1/Akt. One of the downstream signaling molecules of Akt is IKK (18Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Google Scholar). In addition to direct interaction, Akt has been shown to activate IKK and IKK-mediated IκB phosphorylation and degradation (19Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Google Scholar). Therefore, we carried out transient transfections with kdIKK-β or dnIKK-γ (expression of recombinant proteins was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 2F)). Our results indicate that overexpression of kdIKK-β or dnIKK-γ significantly attenuated CXCL16-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 2G) and κB-driven luciferase activity (Fig. 2H). Activation of NF-κB occurs following IκB phosphorylation and degradation. Fig. 2I shows that CXCL16 induces IκB-α phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner with increased phosphorylated-IκB-α (Ser32) levels detected at 20 min. Furthermore, overexpression of phosphorylation-deficient mutants of IκB-α (S32A/S36A) or IκB-β (S19A/S32A) or pretreatment with the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132 attenuated CXCL16-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 2, D and G) and κB-driven luciferase activity (Fig. 2, E and H). However, PDTC, a free radical scavenger, failed to modulate CXCL16-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 2, D and E), suggesting that free radicals may not play a role in CXCL16-mediated NF-κB activation in ASMC. CXCL16 Induces TNF-α Expression via NF-κB Activation—TNF-α is a κB-responsive proinflammatory cytokine and plays a role in atherosclerotic vascular disease by inducing the expression of adhesion molecules and chemokines involved in monocyte-ASMC/endothelial cell interactions. As CXCL16 is a strong inducer of NF-κB in ASMC, we determined whether CXCL16-induced NF-κB activation leads to TNF-α induction in ASMC. ASMC expressed low basal levels of TNF-α mRNA (Fig. 3A) and protein (Fig. 3B), and treatment with CXCL16 significantly increased its mRNA (9-fold, p < 0.01 versus untreated control; Fig. 3A), protein (11-fold, p < 0.001, Fig. 3B), and secretion (8-fold, p < 0.0.01, Fig. 3C). Furthermore, increased transcription (Fig. 3E), but not mRNA stability (Fig. 3F), contributed to CXCL16-induced TNF-α mRNA expression. We next determined whether TNF-α induction by CXCL16 is in fact mediated via NF-κB activation. ASMC were either transfected with p65 siRNA expression vector or treated with MG-132 prior to CXCL16 addition. Transfection with siRNA for NF-κBp65 (knockdown of p65 protein was confirmed by Western blotting; Fig. 3D) or pretreatment with MG-132 significantly attenuated CXCL16-induced TNF-α expression (mRNA, Fig. 3A; protein, Fig. 3B; and secretion, Fig. 3C), indicating that CXCL16 is an inflammatory chemokine, and induces TNF-α expression via activation of NF-κB. Effects of CXCL16 on NF-κB Activation Are Direct and Are Not Mediated by TNF-α—In addition to being a κB-responsive cytokine, TNF-α is a potent inducer of NF-κB activation. Therefore, we investigated whether CXCL16-induced NF-κB activation is mediated by TNF-α. TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM17) cleaves the transmembrane form of TNF-α at its physiological processing site (20Black R.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 1-5Google Scholar). Therefore, we pretreated ASMC with siRNA for TACE to prevent TNF-α cleavage or incubated ASMC with TNF-α neutralizing antibodies to prevent release of preformed membrane-bound TNF-α. Fig. 4 shows TACE mRNA expression in ASMC by RT-PCR (Fig. 3G) and its protein levels by immunoblotting (Fig. 3H). Transfection with TACE siRNA, but not ADAM12 siRNA, inhibited TACE mRNA (Fig. 3G) and protein levels (Fig. 3H) and attenuated CXCL16-mediated TNF-α secretion (Fig. 3I). However, TACE inhibition or TNF-α neutralization failed to modulate CXCL16-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 3J), indicating that the effects of CXCL16 on NF-κB activation are direct and are not mediated by TNF-α as has been reported previously for SDF-1 (21Han Y. He T. Huang D.R. Pardo C.A. Ransohoff R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 425-435Google Scholar). CXCL16 Induces Cell-Cell Adhesion and Cellular Proliferation—From the aforementioned studies, it is clear that CXCL16 is a strong inducer of NF-κB in HASMC, and this induction of NF-κB is mediated through Akt. Activation of Akt regulates survival signals induced by cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors (18Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Google Scholar). Upon activation, Akt phosphorylates downstream pro-apoptotic signaling molecules such as Bad, rendering them inactive (18Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Google Scholar). Furthermore, Akt activates NF-κB (22Kane L.P. Shapiro V.S. Stokoe D. Weiss A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 601-604Google Scholar), and activation of NF-κB plays a role in growth factor-induced cell proliferation (23Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Google Scholar). Because CXCL16 activated Akt and induced Akt-dependent NF-κB activation, we hypothesized that CXCL16 may promote ASMC survival and proliferation. Fig. 4A shows low levels of oligonucleosomal fragmented DNA in untreated controls, and unlike SNAP, a nitric oxide donor, CXCL16, failed to induce cell death. In addition, MTT reduction and [3H]thymidine incorporation assays indicated that CXCL16 is in fact mitogenic to ASMC (Fig. 4, B and C). However, CXCL16 increased ASMC proliferation was more pronounced at days 5 and 7 after treatment. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB was used as a positive control and induced HASMC proliferation. Our results also demonstrated that CXCL16 induced phosphorylation of Bad at Ser112 (Fig. 4D), indicating that CXCL16 is pro-mitogenic and not a pro-apoptotic chemokine. To verify whether CXCL16 induces HASMC proliferation via NF-κB activation, we performed transient transfection assays using NF-κBp65 or IKK-α siRNA expression vectors. Fig. 4E shows that transfection with p65siRNA or IKK-α siRNA significantly inhibited CXCL16-mediated κB-driven luciferase activity and significantly increased oligonucleosomal fragmented DNA (Fig. 4F). Inhibition of NF-κB also significantly reduced HASMC numbers following CXCL16 addition, indicating that CXCL16 induces cell proliferation via NF-κB activation (Fig. 4G). Because cell-cell signaling plays a role in cellular proliferation, we investigated whether CXCL16 increases cell-cell adhesion. Fig. 4H shows that treatment with CXCL16 significantly increased cell-cell adhesion as seen by increased calcein acetoxymethyl ester fluorescence. Together, these results indicate that CXCL16 increases cell-cell adhesion and ASMC proliferation. Results from the present study indicate for the first time that human aortic smooth muscle cells express CXCR6. Treatment with CXCL16 activates NF-κB via heterotrimeric G proteins/PI3K/PDK-1/Akt/IKK/IκB and induces TNF-α expression in an NF-κB-dependent manner. Furthermore, CXCL16 increases cell-cell adhesion and ASMC proliferation, indicating that CXCL16 may play a role in the development and progression of human atherosclerotic vascular disease. CXCL16 belongs to the α chemokine subfamily due to the presence of an N-terminal CXC motif (1Wilbanks A. Zondlo S.C. Murphy K. Mak S. Soler D. Langdon P. Andrew D.P. Wu L. Briskin M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5145-5154Google Scholar). However, phylogenetically, it is more closely related to β-chemokines (1Wilbanks A. Zondlo S.C. Murphy K. Mak S. Soler D. Langdon P. Andrew D.P. Wu L. Briskin M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5145-5154Google Scholar). It has structural similarities with fractalkine, a transmembrane protein that belongs to the CX3C subfamily, suggesting that, unlike other chemokines described to date, CXCL16 has similarities with a broad range of chemokines from the CC, CXC, and CXC3C subfamilies (1Wilbanks A. Zondlo S.C. Murphy K. Mak S. Soler D. Langdon P. Andrew D.P. Wu L. Briskin M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5145-5154Google Scholar). It exclusively binds CXCR6, a seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor, known previously as STRL33/BONZO/TYMSTR. However, to date, no reports are available describing the signal transduction pathways elicited by CXCL16 and its effects on ASMC biology. Using pharmacological inhibitors and pathway-specific dominant-negative, kinase-dead, and siRNA expression vectors, we demonstrate that in human aortic smooth muscle cells, CXCL16 activates NF-κB via heterotrimeric G proteins/PI3K/PDK-1/Akt/IKK/IκB. Our results clearly demonstrate that CXCL16 is a potent activator of NF-κB, a property also shared by the other transmembrane chemokine, fractalkine (14Chandrasekar B. Mummidi S. Perla R.P. Bysani S. Dulin N.O. Liu F. Melby P.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 547-558Google Scholar). Although fractalkine activates NF-κB and induces its own expression, CXCL16 failed to regulate its own expression, 2B. Chandrasekar, unpublished observations. indicating that CXCL16 is not a κB-responsive chemokine. In fact, it has been recently demonstrated that both IL-1β (interleukin-1β) and TNF-α, two potent activators of NF-κB, failed to modulate CXCL16 expression in human aortic smooth muscle cells and umbilical vein endothelial cells (13Hofnagel O. Luechtenborg B. Plenz G. Robenek H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 710-711Google Scholar), indicating that CXCL16 expression is not NF-κB dependent and may be regulated by other transcription factors. On the other hand, CXCL16 induced TNF-α expression in an NF-κB-dependent manner. However, TNF-α, a potent inducer of NF-κB activation, did not mediate CXCL16-induced NF-κB activation. Both neutralizing antibodies and inhibition of TACE failed to modulate CXCL16-induced NF-κB activation, indicating that CXCL16 is a direct and potent activator of NF-κB. In addition to TNF-α, TACE has also been shown to shed fractalkine (24Tsou C.L. Haskell C.A. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44622-44626Google Scholar, 25Garton K.J. Gough P.J. Blobel C.P. Murphy G. Greaves D.R. Dempsey P.J. Raines E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37993-38001Google Scholar). Because inducible fractalkine release is TACE-dependent (24Tsou C.L. Haskell C.A. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44622-44626Google Scholar) and fractalkine induces NF-κB activation and ASMC proliferation (14Chandrasekar B. Mummidi S. Perla R.P. Bysani S. Dulin N.O. Liu F. Melby P.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 547-558Google Scholar), our TACE knockdown studies further suggest that neither TNF-α nor fractalkine mediated CXCL16-induced NF-κB activation. CXCL16 mediates NF-κB activation via Akt/PKB. Activation of Akt generally transmits survival signals. Akt directly phosphorylates and inactivates proteins involved in cell death such as Bad, procaspase 9, and members of the Forkhead transcription factor family (18Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Google Scholar). In the present study, we have demonstrated that treatment with CXCL16 failed to induce cell death, and in fact, promotes cell survival and proliferation. In addition, it induced phosphorylation of Bad (Ser112), providing further evidence that CXCL16 is an anti-apoptotic chemokine. Upon phosphorylation, Bad is sequestered in the cytoplasm due to its interaction with 14-3-3 protein (24Tsou C.L. Haskell C.A. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44622-44626Google Scholar) and becomes unavailable to the pro-apoptotic machinery. Akt has also been shown to induce phosphorylation of procaspase 9 at Ser196 (18Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Google Scholar). Furthermore, phosphorylation and inactivation of FKHRL1, a member of the Forkhead transcription factor family, promotes cell survival (26Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Google Scholar). Although we have shown phosphorylation of Bad by CXCL16, its effects on procaspase 9 and the members of the Forkhead transcription factor family are not known and are under investigation. In addition to inactivating pro-apoptotic mediators, Akt has also been shown to promote survival signals by inducing IKK-mediated NF-κB activation and κB-dependent gene transcription (18Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB promotes cell survival in a cell- and stimulus-specific manner. For example, platelet-derived growth factor-induced cell survival is mediated by Akt-dependent NF-κB activation (23Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Google Scholar). In ASMC, fractalkine activated NF-κB via Akt and induced ASMC proliferation (14Chandrasekar B. Mummidi S. Perla R.P. Bysani S. Dulin N.O. Liu F. Melby P.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 547-558Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrated that CXCL16 induces HASMC proliferation via NF-κB activation as inhibition of NF-κB led to a significant increase in cell death as evidenced by increased oligonucleosomal fragmented DNA and reduced cell numbers, indicating that in addition to chemoattraction, chemokines also play a role in cell survival, proliferation, angiogenesis, and malignancy (27Onuffer J.J.

Taken together, our results clearly demonstrate that CXCL16 is a potent and direct inducer of NF-κB activation, signals via heterotrimeric G proteins, PI3K, PDK-1, Akt, IKK, and IκB phosphorylation, and induces the expression of TNF-α, a proinflammatory and pro-atherogenic cytokine. Most importantly, CXCL16 induces cell-cell adhesion and HASMC proliferation, indicating that CXCL16 may play an important role in atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W1992983911,"The degenerin/epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) superfamily is a group of structurally related ion channels that are involved in diverse biological processes, including responses to mechanical stimuli. In renal cortical collecting ducts, changes in rates of perfusion affect Na+ reabsorption through an amiloride-sensitive pathway, suggesting that ENaC may be a mechanosensitive channel. In this study, we examined whether ENaC expressed in oocytes is regulated by laminar shear stress (LSS). A 1.8-mm (internal diameter) perfusion pipette was placed within 0.5–1.0 mm of the oocyte to provide laminar flow across the oocyte surface. LSS induced a dose-dependent and reversible increase in benzamil-sensitive whole cell Na+ currents in oocytes expressing αβγ ENaC. The half-time for activation by LSS was ∼5 s. Repetitive stimulation by LSS of oocytes expressing ENaC was associated with a reduction in the response to LSS. Oocytes expressing αβS518Kγ, a pore region mutant with a high open probability, were insensitive to LSS. We demonstrated previously that channels with a Cys residue introduced at position αSer-580 had a low open probability, but, following modification by [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET), channels exhibited a high open probability. Oocytes expressing αS580Cβγ ENaC respond to LSS similar to wild type; however, covalent modification by MTSET largely eliminated the response to LSS.

DEG/ENaC family members are similar in structure, with intracellular N- and C-termini, two membrane-spanning domains, and a large extracellular region containing cysteine-rich domains. ENaC is formed by three subunits, α, β, and γ, arranged with a subunit stoichiometry of 2α:1β:1γ (3Kosari F. Sheng S. Li J. Mak D.O. Foskett J.K. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar).Genetic and molecular analyses of Caenorhabditis elegans with a touch-insensitive phenotype led to the identification of several genes whose products were postulated to be part of a touch-transducing complex. Dominant mutations in MEC-4, MEC-10, UNC-8, UNC-105, and DEG-1 result in the deaths of specific mechanosensory neurons where these proteins are expressed, which is thought to result from an increase in cation channel activity (2Mano I. Driscoll M. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 568-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 6Ernstrom G.G. Chalfie M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 411-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Mutations within three distinct regions appear to generate hyperactive channels, including a region following the first transmembrane domain, a tract of 22 amino acids within the extracellular loop present only in degenerins that could be part of a gating domain, and a single amino acid substitution in the pre-second membrane-spanning (M2) domain that appears to be within a conserved gating domain (degenerin site) (2Mano I. Driscoll M. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 568-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Functional channels were observed when gain-of-function mutations in selected members of the putative touch-transducing complex were expressed in Xenopus oocytes or human embryonic kidney 293 cells, although a functional response to a mechanical stimulus has not been demonstrated (7Garcia-Anoveros J. Garcia J.A. Liu J.D. Corey D.P. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1231-1241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).Cells are potentially exposed to variety of mechanical stimuli, including indentations, high frequency vibrations, osmotic pressure gradients, hydrodynamic pressure, and fluid shear stress. In the specific case of ion channels, modifications in channel kinetics could result from changes in membrane tension, thickness, local curvature, and extension or by direct tugging on the protein by cytoskeletal or extracellular tethers (8Hamill O.P. Martinac B. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 685-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Based on its structure homology with other members of the DEG/ENaC family that are presumed to be activated by mechanical stimuli (as postulated for degenerins in C. elegans), it was suggested that ENaC could be a mechanosensitive channel (9Awayda M.S. Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1450-C1459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Shlyonsky V.G. Benos D.J. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1182-1192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Various studies have examined this hypothesis with conflicting results. Awayda et al. (9Awayda M.S. Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1450-C1459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that in vitro translated bovine α-ENaC, reconstituted in lipid bilayers, is activated by membrane distension produced by a hydrostatic pressure gradient. Later studies showed that rat αβγ ENaC is mechanosensitive when it is reconstituted in lipid bilayers (10Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Shlyonsky V.G. Benos D.J. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1182-1192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); however conflicting results were reported when oocytes expressing rat ENaC were subjected to an osmotic stimulus (11Awayda M.S. Subramanyam M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 97-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12Ji H.L. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1182-C1190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When channels were examined in principal cells using a cell attached patch configuration, application of negative pressure led to an increase in single channel activity in >30% of patches (13Palmer L.G. Frindt G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A recent study suggested that a lack of reproducibility of stretch-mediated ENaC activation may reflect stretch-induced ATP release from cells that inhibits ENaC by activating purinergic receptors, thus masking stretch-induced ENaC activation (14Ma H.P. Li L. Zhou Z.H. Eaton D.C. Warnock D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F501-F505Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar).We recently reported that increasing rates of perfusion of isolated rabbit cortical collecting ducts increase the rates of tubular Na+ reabsorption via an amiloride-sensitive pathway, suggesting that ENaC is activated in response to increases in tubular flow rates (15Satlin L.M. Sheng S. Woda C.B. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F1010-F1018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this study did not address the question of whether mechanical forces, such as shear stress, directly modulate gating of the Na+ channel. In this report, we used a submerged jet to expose oocytes expressing ENaC to laminar shear stress (LSS). We observed that wild type ENaC activity increased in response to LSS, whereas mutant or chemically modified Na+ channels that exhibit a high intrinsic open probability did not respond to laminar flow. These data suggest that mechanical forces directly modulate ENaC gating.MATERIALS AND METHODSDNA Constructs—Point mutations and truncations of mouse ENaC (mENaC) subunits were generated by site-directed mutagenesis with the sequential polymerase chain reaction method using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (16Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Avery D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8572-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The PCR-amplified fragments containing the desired mutations were ligated into wild type mENaC cDNA. PCR-amplified fragments were sequenced by automated DNA sequencing at the University of Pittsburgh's sequencing facility to confirm the desired mutation.Oocyte Expression—cRNAs for α, β, and γ mENaC subunits were synthesized with T3 mMessage mMachine™ (Ambion, Austin, TX). Stage V-VI Xenopus laevis oocytes were pretreated with 1.5 mg/ml type IV collagenase and injected with 0.5–2 ng/subunit mENaC cRNAs. Injected oocytes were maintained at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 15 mm HEPES, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, and 0.82 mm MgSO4, pH 7.4) supplemented with 10 μg/ml sodium penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate.Two-electrode Voltage Clamp (TEV)—Two-electrode voltage clamp was performed at room temperature (20–25 °C) using a GeneClamp 500B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Data were acquired through Clampex 8.0 using a DigiData 1200 interface and stored on the hard disk of a 233 MHz Pentium II personal computer. Pipettes filled with 3 m KCl had resistances of 0.5–5 megaohms. The extracellular solution (TEV solution) was 110 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.54 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Oocytes were maintained in a recording chamber (20-mm diameter and 6-mm-deep Petri dish) with a constant volume of ∼1.5 ml of TEV solution. The recording chamber was perfused at a rate of 3.5 ml/min. Shear stress was applied by perfusing TEV solution through a vertical pipette (1.8-mm internal diameter) that was placed near the surface of the oocyte at a distance of <1 mm as described previously (17Hoger J.H. Ilyin V.I. Forsyth S. Hoger A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7780-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Bath perfusion was either maintained (Fig. 2A) or stopped (Figs. 1, 2B, 3, and 4) during the application of LSS. A response to LSS was observed in oocytes when bath perfusion was either maintained or stopped during the application of LSS (see “Results”).Fig. 1ENaC is activated by LSS.A, current-voltage relationship of oocytes expressing αβγ ENaC prior to fluid jet perfusion to generate LSS (closed circle), 1 min following initiation of fluid jet perfusion (open circle), 1 min following discontinuation of fluid jet perfusion (closed triangle), and following the application of 5 μm benzamil in the bath (open triangle) (n = 15).

Benzamil-sensitive currents recorded at –100 mV prior to initiation of LSS (before LSS), during stimulation by LSS (+LSS), and following recuperation (after LSS) were plotted as response relative to the mean of the currents recorded before stimulation (Ibasal) (n = 15, p < 0.05; +LSS versus before and after LSS, Kruskal-Wallis non parametric analysis of variance test).

Currents were recorded under control conditions (–LSS) and following 1 min of stimulation by LSS (+LSS). Oocytes were subsequently perfused in the bath with TEV solution containing MTSET (1 mm) for 4 min. The thiol-reactive reagent was washed out by bath perfusion with TEV solution for 8 min. Currents were again recorded before and following 1 min of fluid jet perfusion. The benzamil-insensitive component of the whole cell current was then determined by bath perfusion with TEV solution containing benzamil (5 μm). B, relative responses to LSS of oocytes expressing αS580Cβγ and the degenerin mutant (αβS518Kγ). Currents recorded after 1 min of stimulation by LSS relative to currents recorded before stimulation are shown (I+LSS/I–LSS). Experiments using oocytes expressing αS580Cβγ were performed as described above. The relative response of oocytes expressing αS580Cβγ was not significantly different from that observed with oocytes expressing wild type ENaC (n = 7, p = not significant). However, following covalent modification by MTEST, the relative response to LSS was practically abolished (n = 7, p < 0.05; αS580Cβγ – MTEST (I+LSS/I–LSS) versus αS580Cβγ + MTSET (I+LSS/I-LSS); unpaired t test). In oocytes expressing αβS518Kγ (n = 8), the relative response to LSS was also significantly reduced in comparison with wild type ENaC-expressing oocytes (n = 19, p < 0.01; wild type versus αβS518Kγ, unpaired t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Adaptive response to repetitive mechanical stimulation.A, representative tracing of an experiment performed in an oocyte expressing wild type ENaC and subjected to repetitive stimulation by LSS.

Currents recorded at –100 mV after 1 min of stimulation by LSS relative to currents recorded before stimulation are shown (I+LSS/I–LSS) (n = 10–15, p = not significant). D, relative response of oocytes expressing wild type ENaC (n = 16) or αTβTγT (n = 13) to four repetitive periods of fluid jet perfusion and recuperation. The ratio of the whole cell current measured just prior to and 1 min following the initiation of fluid jet perfusion at a holding potential of –60 mV was determined for each stimulation. Data were normalized to the I+LSS/I–LSS value obtained with the initial fluid jet perfusion. The relative response for oocytes expressing wild type channels (open circles; n = 16) at the second, third, and fourth stimulation were 68 ± 4, 53 ± 5, and 40 ± 5%, respectively. The relative response for oocytes expressing αTβTγT channels (closed squares; n = 13) were 98 ± 7, 82 ± 9, and 80 ± 12%, respectively. Significant differences in the relative response of oocytes expressing wild type ENaC were observed with the second, third, and fourth stimulation, compared with the response of oocytes expressing αTβTγT(p < 0.01; Mann-Whitney test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The approximate average shear stress on the oocyte surface was estimated as the relation of the drag force and the oocyte surface area (Fdrag/surface area of the oocytes) (17Hoger J.H. Ilyin V.I. Forsyth S. Hoger A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7780-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The magnitude of the drag force was determined according to Fdrag = 0.5 × ρAω2Cd (where ρ = water density, A = cross-sectional area of the sphere, ω = average free stream velocity, and Cd = drag coefficient (∼1 for spheres with a Reynolds number within the range of ∼3 to ∼25)). The Reynolds number was determined as previously described (17Hoger J.H. Ilyin V.I. Forsyth S. Hoger A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7780-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To determine a dose-response relationship, vertical pipette perfusion rates were varied between 0.5 and 3.7 ml/min, corresponding to a shear stress of between 0.013 and 0.753 dynes/cm2. For most studies, the vertical pipette perfusion rate was 1.6 ml/min, corresponding to 0.137 dynes/cm2 of shear stress.Whole cell currents were determined using a series of voltage steps (500 ms) from –140 to 60 mV in 20-mV increments in the absence or presence of benzamil (5 μm) in the bath solution. ENaC-mediated whole cell Na+ currents were defined as the benzamil-sensitive component of the current. Benzamil-sensitive currents measured in the absence of LSS were referred to as I–LSS, whereas currents recorded in the presence of LSS were referred to as I+LSS. To determine mean times of activation, oocytes were clamped at a holding potential of –60 mV, and the vertical pipette perfusion was controlled through the computer using a protocol generated in pClamp 8.0.Data and Statistical Analyses—Data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. (n), unless otherwise indicated, where n equals the number of independent experiments analyzed. Experiments were repeated with a minimum of two batches of oocytes obtained from different frogs. Electrophysiological data were analyzed with Clampfit 8.1 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA), SigmaPlot 8.02 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL), and GraphPad 3.02 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Statistical comparisons were performed using GraphPad Instant (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Mean time of activation was determined by fitting experimental data with an exponential function y = y0 + a × e–bx, where y0 is the plateau, a is the difference between the signal at time zero and the plateau, and b is the time constant. The mean time of activation was calculated as 0.69302/time constant. The dose-response curve was fit with the following equation y = 1/(1 + 10logEC50–X)), where logEC50 is the logarithm of the dose (shear stress) that elicited 50% of the maximal response.RESULTSLaminar Flow Increases Benzamil-sensitive Na+Currents in Oocytes Expressing αβγ mENaC—We reported previously that the rates of Na+ reabsorption in renal cortical collecting tubules perfused in vitro increase in response to increases in the rates of tubular perfusion (15Satlin L.M. Sheng S. Woda C.B. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F1010-F1018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also observed increases in whole cell Na+ currents measured in oocytes expressing αβγ mENaC that were centered in a Petri dish in response to a change in the rate of bath perfusion from 0 to 5–6 ml/min, although the increases in currents were highly variable and, on occasion, no increase was observed. To explore whether Na+ channels are activated in response to increases in LSS, we employed a perfusion system similar to the fluid jet used to stimulate sensory hair cells (19Holt J.R. Corey D.P. Eatock R.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8739-8748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oocytes expressing αβγ were positioned in the chamber and exposed to laminar fluid flow from a vertical pipette, as described previously by Hoger et al. (17Hoger J.H. Ilyin V.I. Forsyth S. Hoger A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7780-7785Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Whole cell Na+ currents were determined before changing from perfusion of the Petri dish to perfusion via a vertical pipette that was placed in close proximity to the oocyte surface. ENaC-mediated Na+ currents, defined as currents sensitive to 5 μm benzamil, were increased significantly following the switch to fluid jet perfusion (Fig. 1, A–C; I/Ibasal = 1.53 ± 0.19, n = 15, p < 0.05; +LSS versus before and after LSS). Channel activation was reversible, as currents fell to baseline levels when perfusion was changed from the vertical pipette back to the bath perfusion (Fig. 1, A–C). Increases in current induced by LSS were not associated with changes in reversal potential, suggesting that LSS did not alter the chemical driving force for Na+ transport (Fig. 1A). Increases in whole cell currents were not observed in non-injected oocytes in response to switching to fluid jet perfusion (Fig. 1D, upper trace). The inclusion of benzamil in the bath solution and vertical pipette abolished the response to LSS in ENaC-expressing oocytes (Fig. 1D, lower trace). Increases in whole cell Na+ currents were also observed if bath perfusion was maintained following initiation of fluid jet perfusion (I+LSS/I–LSS = 1.28 ± 0.08, n = 33). We observed variability in the LSS response (I+LSS/I–LSS) between different batches of oocytes. For that reason, statistical comparisons were made with experiments performed with oocytes from the same batch.A software-controlled perfusion system was utilized to initiate fluid jet perfusion in the setting of constant bath perfusion in order to characterize the kinetics of channel activation. To define the time course of activation by shear stress, whole cell currents were monitored at a clamp potential of –60 mV. Currents were measured with constant bath perfusion for 20 s prior to initiation of fluid jet perfusion. Oocytes expressing αβγ mENaC responded to shear stress with an increase in whole cell currents (Fig. 2A). The time required to achieve half-maximal activation (t½) was obtained from fitting experimental data with a single exponential function. The t½ for activation in response to LSS was 5.3 ± 0.3 s (n = 8). Following channel activation, currents were fairly stable while LSS was maintained for period of 60 s. We did not observe adaptive behavior while LSS was maintained, as was described previously for other mechanosensitive channels (20Hamill O.P. McBride Jr., D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7462-7466Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In some experiments, we observed current rundown that was present before and during stimulation by LSS. Oocytes expressing wild type ENaC were subjected to different amounts of shear stress to determine whether channels responded to increases in shear stress in a dose-dependent manner. Increasing rates of fluid jet perfusion (0 ml/min to 3.7 ml/min, corresponding to a LSS of between ∼0 and 0.733 dynes/cm2) were associated with increases in whole cell Na+ currents in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B).LSS Regulates ENaC by Altering Gating Properties of the Channel—Mechanical stimuli may affect the trafficking of membrane proteins as well as the gating properties of ion channels (8Hamill O.P. Martinac B. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 685-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). To determine whether increases on whole cell Na+ currents in response to LSS occurred in association with increases in channel open probability, we expressed ENaCs with mutations within a gating domain localized to a region preceding the second membrane-spanning (pre-M2) domain of the channel that were previously shown to either increase or decrease channel open probability. αS580Cβγ channels have a low open probability. However, following covalent modification by the sulfhydryl reactive reagent [2-(trimethylammonium)-ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET), the open probability of this mutant approached a value of 1 (21Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Kieber-Emmons T. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1326-1334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Oocytes expressing αS580Cβγ were subjected to stimulation by LSS. Increases in whole cell currents in response to shear stress (I+LSS/I–LSS = 1.44 ± 0.12, n = 7 were similar in magnitude to that observed in oocytes expressing wild type ENaC (I+LSS/ I–LSS = 1.46 ± 0.08, n = 19, p = not significant). Following treatment of oocytes expressing αS580Cβγ channels with MTSET (1 mm) to increase channel open probability, the modified channels were insensitive to the shear stress stimulus (Fig. 3, A and B, I+LSS/I–LSS = 1.04 ± 0.08, n = 7, p < 0.05; –MTSET versus +MTSET). A loss of response to shear stress was also observed in oocytes expressing αS580Cβγ that were treated with MTSET (1 mm) prior to their initial exposure to shear stress (I+LSS/I–LSS = 1.01 ± 0.04, n = 5). Previous studies identified a key site (degenerin site) in the pre-M2 domains of ENaC subunits, degenerins, and acid-sensing ion channels where the introduction of bulky residues or the introduction of a Cys residue and subsequent modification by MTS reagents results in channel activation (2Mano I. Driscoll M. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 568-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 22Snyder P.M. Bucher D.B. Olson D.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23Adams C.M. Snyder P.M. Price M.P. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30204-30207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). ENaCs with a Lys residue substitution at the degenerin site in the β-subunit (corresponding to mouse βS518K) were reported to have a high open probability (22Snyder P.M. Bucher D.B. Olson D.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 781-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). αβS518Kγ channels were insensitive to LSS (Fig. 3B; I+LSS/I–LSS = 1.07 ± 0.06, n = 8). These data demonstrate that gain-of-function mutations or covalent modifications within a region that dramatically affect channel gating alters the channel's response to mechanical stimulation.To corroborate the proposition that increases in whole cell Na+ currents in response to LSS reflected increases in channel open probability rather than the insertion of channels from an intracellular pool into the plasma membrane, we expressed αS583Cβγ ENaC in oocytes. Covalent modification of this mutant by MTSET (1 mm) reduced whole cell benzamil-sensitive Na+ currents by >90% (I–MTSET = –5.13 ± 0.60 μA and I+MTSET = –0.36 ± 0.09 μA, n = 6). If ENaC stimulation by LSS is due to insertion of channels from an intracellular pool, the increase in benzamil-sensitive Na+ currents in response to LSS in oocytes expressing this mutant before and following covalent modification by MTEST should be similar in magnitude. Oocytes expressing αS583Cβγ responded to LSS with an increase in benzamil-sensitive currents of 0.44 ± 0.04 μA (n = 6). In contrast, the absolute magnitude of the current response to LSS in oocytes modified by MTSET (1 mm) was dramatically reduced to 0.07 ± 0.10 μA(n = 6, p < 0.005) (see Table I). These data suggest that activation of ENaC by LSS is not due to the insertion of channels from an intracellular pool.Table ICovalent modification of α S583Cβ γ abrogated the response to laminar shear stress-LSS IbenzaWhole cell benzamil-sensitive Na+ current.+LSS IbenzaWhole cell benzamil-sensitive Na+ current.ΔIbenzaWhole cell benzamil-sensitive Na+ current.μAμAμA-MTSET (n = 6)bp < 0.005; Mann-Whitney test.-5.13 ± 0.60-5.58 ± 0.61-0.45 ± 0.04+MTSET (n = 6)bp < 0.005; Mann-Whitney test.-0.36 ± 0.09-0.42 ± 0.09-0.06 ± 0.10a Whole cell benzamil-sensitive Na+ current.b p < 0.005; Mann-Whitney test.

We reported previously that hyaluronan oligosaccharides induce CD44 cleavage from tumor cells. Here we show that engagement of CD44 promotes CD44 cleavage and tumor cell migration, both of which were suppressed by a metalloproteinase inhibitor KB-R7785 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) but not by TIMP-2. We also present evidence that blockade of metalloproteinase-disintegrin ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10) by RNA interference suppresses CD44 cleavage induced by its ligation. Engagement of CD44 concurrently induced activation of the small GTPase Rac1 and led to drastic changes in cell morphology and actin cytoskeleton with redistribution of CD44 to newly generated membrane ruffling areas. A fluorescence resonance energy transfer approach to visualize GTP-bound Rac1 in living cells revealed the localization of the active Rac1 in the leading edge of the membrane ruffling areas upon ligation of CD44. Taken together, our results indicate that the cleavage of CD44 catalyzed by ADAM10 is augmented by the intracellular signaling elicited by engagement of CD44, through Rac-mediated cytoskeletal rearrangement, and suggest that CD44 cleavage contributes to the migration and invasion of tumor cells.

Krammer P.H. Moller P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1089-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that CD44 expressed in tumor cells is proteolytically cleaved at the extracellular domain by metalloproteinases and that CD44 cleavage plays a critical role in CD44-mediated tumor cell migration (5Okamoto I.

Okada A. Kinoh H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). CD44 cleavage on the tumor cell surface is enhanced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or ionomycin treatment, indicating that the cleavage is under the regulation of the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) or the extracellular calcium influx (7Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Matsumoto M. Suga M. Kaibuchi K. Ando M. Saya H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25525-25534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). CD44 cleavage is also induced by introducing dominant active mutant of Ha-Ras small GTPase (8Kawano Y. Okamoto I. Murakami D. Itoh H. Yoshida M. Ueda S. Saya H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29628-29635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition to these CD44 cleavage inducers acting on intracellular signaling molecules, we have shown recently (9Sugahara K.N. Murai T. Nishinakamura H. Kawashima H. Saya H. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32259-32265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) that HA fragments also enhance CD44 cleavage from tumor cells. HA fragments probably bind and cross-link CD44 and then induce certain intracellular signals to cause CD44 cleavage. However, almost no information is available regarding the intracellular signals transmitted upon stimulation of CD44 to the induction of CD44 cleavage. The relationship between CD44 cleavage and the enhanced cell migration also remains largely unknown.Tumor cells migrate by regulating adhesion to and detachment from extracellular matrix, dynamically changing their cytoskeleton (10Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3254) Google Scholar). Rho family small GTPases are the key regulators of actin organization in cytoskeleton, and the changes of their activation state influence cell morphology (11Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5185) Google Scholar). The mammalian Rho GTPase family consists of three subfamilies, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, whose activation leads to form stress fibers, lamellipodia, and filopodia, respectively (12Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar). Upstream events leading to exchange of GDP for GTP binding to Rho family small GTPases activate these proteins, which then interact with downstream target molecules to produce different biological responses (13Mackay D.J. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). CD44 functions as one of the major adhesion molecules of tumor cells and also functions as a signaling molecule to induce cell migration and invasion through actin reorganization (14Turley E.A. Noble P.W. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4589-4592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that CD44 signaling may enhance cleavage of CD44 itself by inducing such cellular changes.In the present study, we show that engagement of CD44 with an anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody (mAb) induces cleavage of CD44 and enhances tumor cell migration through CD44 cleavage. We also observed that engagement of CD44 induces cytoskeletal rearrangement and activation of the small GTPase Rac at the leading edge of the membrane ruffling areas. These raise the possibility that intracellular signals elicited by ligation of CD44 induce CD44 cleavage and enhance tumor cell migration and invasion, through activation of Rac.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagentsAnti-CD44 antibodies were obtained as follows: rat B cell hybridoma producing mAb IM7 (IM7.8.1) (15Trowbridge I.S.

(Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Hydroxamate-based metalloproteinase inhibitor KB-R7785 ([4-(N-hydroxyamino)-2R-isobutyl-3S-methylsuccinyl]-l-phenylglycine-N-methylamide) was provided by Organon Japan (Osaka, Japan). Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) and TIMP-2 were obtained from Fuji Chemical Industries (Takaoka, Japan). GF109203X was from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). Ionomycin was from Calbiochem. PMA and cytochalasin D were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinal (MG132) was obtained from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan).Cell Culture and TransfectionThe human glioblastoma cell line U251MG, kindly provided by Dr. H. Saya, was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Transfection of U251MG cells with the plasmid pEF-BOS-myc-N17Rac1, kindly provided by Dr. Yoshimi Takai (Osaka University, Suita, Japan), was performed as follows. The cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 2.5 × 104 cells/well and transfected with 0.8 μg of plasmid using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Western Blot AnalysisFor detection of CD44 cleavage products in cell lysates, U251MG cells were seeded in a 24-well plate at 5 × 104 cells per well and cultured overnight. After preincubation with 10 μm MG132 for 30 min, the cells were incubated with IM7 mAb for 1 h or with 100 ng/ml PMA for 30 min. Then the cells were directly lysed with SDS sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.02% bromphenol blue). Samples extracted from equal numbers of cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride filter. After blocked in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA), the blot was probed with anti-CD44cyto pAb (5Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Tsuiki H. Sasaki J. Nakao M. Matsumoto M. Suga M. Ando M. Nakajima M. Saya H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1435-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (American Qualex, San Clemente, CA) and developed with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences).For detection of soluble CD44 (sCD44) in culture supernatants, the culture supernatants of U251MG cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filters. The blot was then probed with rabbit anti-human CD44 pAb and horseradish peroxidaseconjugated anti-rabbit IgG and developed with ECL Western blotting detection reagents.Migration AssayCell migration was assayed in 24-well Costar Transwell chambers (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) with 6.5-mm-diameter polycarbonate filters of 8-μm pore size. The filters were coated with 100 μg/ml HA (human umbilical cord) (Sigma-Aldrich), and 100 μg/ml IM7 mAb or a control antibody (normal rat IgG; Sigma-Aldrich) at 4 °C overnight. The lower compartments of the chambers were filled with 0.6 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium containing 0.1% BSA, and the filters were placed into the chamber. U251MG cells grown logarithmically were detached by brief exposure to 0.02% EDTA/PBS and re-suspended at 2 × 105 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium containing 0.1% BSA. 100-μl aliquot of the cell suspension (2 × 104 cells) was added to the upper compartments and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. After incubation, the cells on the upper surface of the filters were wiped off with cotton swab, and the cells on the lower surface were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and counted under a light microscope in five defined high power fields (×200).RNA InterferenceTransfection of 21-nucleotide small-interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes (Japan Bio Services, Saitama, Japan) for targeting endogenous genes was carried out using LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, U251MG cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 2.5 × 104 cells/well and transfected with 20 pmol of siRNA. Sequences of siRNA used were AGACAUUAUGAAGGAUUAUdTdT (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10; ADAM10) and GAGAAGCUUGAUUCUUUGCdTdT (ADAM17). Specific silencing of targeted genes by RNA interference (RNAi) was monitored by semi-quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR 2 days after transfection. In brief, total RNA isolated from U251MG cells was reverse transcribed with an oligo(dT)18 primer. Primers for specific amplification by PCR were listed as follows: 5′-TCACATTACTTTTGCTCACGA-3′ and 5′-TTCTACCATTCCATTTCCACA-3′ for ADAM10, 5′-GCATTCTCAAGTCTCCACAAG-3′ and 5′-CCTCATTCGGGGCACATTCTG-3′ for ADAM17, and 5′-TGGTATCGTGGAAGGACTCAT-3′ and 5′-GTGGGTGTCGCTGTTGAAGTC-3′ for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The efficiency of ADAM10-specific RNAi was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-ADAM10 pAb (Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG.Immunofluorescence MicroscopyU251MG cells were seeded on a 4-well Lab-teck chamber plate (Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL) at a density of 2 × 103 cells/ml and incubated overnight at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min followed by treatment with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min and blocked in PBS containing 1% BSA for 30 min at room temperature. After being washed with PBS, the cells were incubated with anti-CD44cyto pAb for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) and rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h at room temperature. After being washed with PBS, samples were mounted in Prolong Antifade (Molecular Probes) and visualized with an LSM 410 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).Pull-down AssayU251MG cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells per 10-cm dish. After treatment with 1 μg/ml IM7 mAb for different time periods, the cells were lysed, and the pull-down assay for detection of active form of Rac1 was performed as described previously (17Tsuji T. Ishizaki T. Okamoto M. Higashida C. Kimura K. Furuyashiki T. Arakawa Y. Birge R.B. Nakamoto T. Hirai H. Narumiya S. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23363-23367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), were individually inserted into the plasmid pEYFP-C1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) at the corresponding cloning sites. The resulting plasmids were named pEYFP-Rac1 and pEYFP-Cdc42.In Situ Rac Activity AssayMicroinjection and Imaging—U251MG cells were seeded on a 25-mm diameter glass-base dish at a density of 5 × 103 cells/ml and transfected with the plasmid pEYFP-Rac1 or pEYFP-Cdc42 using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation for 24 h followed by serum starvation for 2 h, the cells were microinjected into the cytoplasm with 1mm BODIPY TR-GTP (Molecular Probes). After 10 min, the cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml IM7 mAb and then observed with an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope equipped with a confocal laser scanner unit CSU10 (Yokogawa Electronic, Tokyo, Japan). Images were acquired by a MicroMAX 512BFT back-illuminated charge-coupled device camera (Princeton Scientific Instruments), through 515-550-nm and 630DF30 filters (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT) for yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) channels, respectively, under excitation of YFP through a 480/10-nm filter.FRET Measurements—The background was subtracted from the raw images prior to the calculation of FRET signals. The FRET was calculated using “corrected FRET” method (19Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.H. Levine B. Herman B. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2702-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 20Youvan D.C. Coleman W.J. Silva C.M. Petersen J. Bylina E.J. Yang M.M. Biotechnology et alia. 1997; 1: 1-16Google Scholar). The formula for the calculation of FRET is shown in the equation, [FRET] = Ff - Df(Fd/Dd) - Af(Fa/Aa), where, in notation of Gordon et al. (19Gordon G.W. Berry G. Liang X.H. Levine B. Herman B. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2702-2713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), the first letters in each symbols represent the filter set (F for the FRET filter set, D for the donor filter set, A for the acceptor filter set), and the second letters indicate the fluorochromes present in a cell (f for both donor and acceptor present in a cell, d for donor only, a for acceptor only). Although BODIPY TR-GTP was slightly excited without FRET, its fluorescence could not be detected through either filters used. Thus Ad and Da are effectively zero.RESULTSEngagement of CD44 with mAb Induces Cleavage of CD44 Itself—We reported previously (9Sugahara K.N. Murai T. Nishinakamura H. Kawashima H. Saya H. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32259-32265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) that HA oligosaccharides can enhance CD44 cleavage from tumor cells. We thus determined whether ligation of CD44 induces its cleavage, using a highly invasive human glioma cell line U251MG, which was shown previously (5Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Tsuiki H. Sasaki J. Nakao M. Matsumoto M. Suga M. Ando M. Nakajima M. Saya H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1435-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 7Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Matsumoto M. Suga M. Kaibuchi K. Ando M. Saya H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25525-25534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) to have high CD44 cleavage activity. When U251MG cells were incubated with a mAb to CD44, IM7, membrane-tethered CD44 cleavage products of ∼20- to 25-kDa, were clearly detected in the lysate of U251MG cells by Western blotting using a pAb against cytoplasmic domain of CD44, anti-CD44cyto pAb (Fig. 1). The induction of CD44 cleavage by IM7 mAb was dose-dependent and reached a plateau at 1 μg/ml. The cleavage was not observed when rat IgG was used as a control antibody to IM7 (data not shown). The bands of CD44 full-length (∼90 kDa) were still detected after IM7 mAb treatment, showing that more than 90% of CD44 remains uncleaved on the cell surface, estimated by densitometric analysis. Basically identical results were obtained using the human pancreatic carcinoma cell line MIA PaCa-2 (data not shown).Next we tried to detect sCD44 released into the culture supernatants. When the culture supernatants of U251MG cells were immunoblotted with anti-human CD44 pAb, which recognizes the ectodomain of CD44, a band of ∼70 kDa was observed (Fig. 2A, right panel). When the cells were treated with IM7 mAb, the intensity of the band increased to almost the same level when CD44 cleavage was induced by PMA (Fig. 2A, columns 2 and 4). The effects of both IM7 mAb and PMA on CD44 cleavage were markedly abrogated by a hydroxamate-type metalloproteinase inhibitor KB-R7785 (Fig. 2A, columns 3 and 5), indicating that the induction of CD44 cleavage by mAb is mediated by metalloproteinases. KB-R7785 is an inhibitor acting on matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), including MMP-1 and MMP-9, with a broad spectrum (21Hirayama R. Yamamoto M. Tsukida T. Konomi M. Obata Y. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 765-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To further investigate the involvement of metalloproteinases in CD44 cleavage, we used TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, the natural inhibitors of MMPs. TIMP-2, which inhibits the activity of most membrane-type MMPs (MT-MMPs) (22Will H. Atkinson S.J. Butler G.S. Smith B. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17119-17123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 23Butler G.S. Will H. Atkinson S.J. Murphy G. Eur. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3852) Google Scholar), did not inhibit IM7 mAb-induced CD44 cleavage (Fig. 2C, left panel), whereas TIMP-1, whose inhibitory effect on MT-MMP activities is much less than TIMP-2, effectively inhibited the mAb-induced CD44 cleavage dose-dependently (Fig. 2B, left panel). These results were similar to those of PMA-induced CD44 cleavage (Fig. 2, B and C, right panels). These findings imply that the enzyme responsible for mAb-induced CD44 cleavage is a metalloproteinase(s) other than MT-MMPs.Fig. 2Effect of metalloproteinase inhibitors on mAb-induced CD44 cleavage.A, effect of a hydroxamate-type metalloproteinase inhibitor on CD44 cleavage. U251MG cells were incubated for 1 h in the presence (lanes 3 and 5) or absence (lanes 1, 2, and 4) of KB-R7785 (10 μm) and left untreated (lane 1) or further incubated with 1 μg/ml IM7 mAb for 1 h (lanes 2 and 3) or with 100 ng/ml PMA for 30 min (lanes 4 and 5). To detect sCD44, the culture supernatants were subjected to Western blot analysis using rabbit anti-human CD44 pAb (right panel). The intensity of the 70-kDa bands that appeared in the blot (lanes 1-5) was quantified by densitometric analysis and expressed in an arbitrary unit (A.U.) (left, columns 1-5, respectively). B and C, effect of TIMPs on CD44 cleavage. After preincubation of U251MG cells for 1 h in the presence of TIMP-1 (B) or TIMP-2 (C) at the indicated concentration, the cells were incubated in the absence (lanes 1 and 6) or presence of 1 μg/ml IM7 mAb for 1 h (lanes 2-5) or 100 ng/ml PMA for 30 min (lanes 7-10). To detect CD44 cleavage product, the cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-CD44cyto pAb as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)mAb-induced CD44 Cleavage Is Independent on PKC and Extracellular Calcium Influx—Hitherto, mAb-induced CD44 cleavage exhibits similar pattern as in the case of PMA, a known activator of PKC. Thus to determine whether mAb-induced CD44 cleavage requires activity of PKC, like PMA-induced cleavage, we tested the effects of a specific PKC inhibitor GF109203X (25Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on CD44 cleavage. PMA-induced CD44 cleavage was inhibited dose-dependently by GF109203X as expected, whereas mAb-induced CD44 cleavage was not affected (Fig. 3A). These results imply that the signaling mechanisms involved in mAb-induced cleavage may be different from those that operate in PMA-induced cleavage. In addition to IM7 mAb and PMA, CD44 cleavage is also induced by influx of extracellular calcium ion into the cytosol by the ionophore ionomycin (7Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Matsumoto M. Suga M. Kaibuchi K. Ando M. Saya H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25525-25534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus we tested whether extracellular calcium ion is required for mAb-induced CD44 cleavage. Although ionomycin did not induce CD44 cleavage in the absence of extracellular calcium ion (Fig. 3B, lane 8), IM7 mAb yet induced CD44 cleavage in the same condition (Fig. 3B, lane 6). These results indicate that the extracellular calcium ion is not required for CD44 cleavage induced by IM7 mAb. Hitherto basically identical results were obtained using another anti-CD44 mAb 5F12 (26Liao H.-X. Levesque M.C. Patton K. Bergamo B. Jones D. Moody M.A. Telen M.J. Haynes B.F. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6490-6499PubMed Google Scholar) instead of IM7 mAb (data not shown), indicating that CD44 cleavage induced by ligation of CD44 with mAb is mediated by a distinct pathway from those by PMA or ionomycin.Fig. 3Dependence of mAb-induced CD44 cleavage on PKC and extracellular calcium ion.A, effect of a PKC inhibitor GF109203X on CD44 cleavage. U251MG cells were preincubated in the presence of GF109203X at the indicated concentration for 1 h and left untreated (lanes 1 and 6) or treated with IM7 mAb (1 μg/ml, 1 h; lanes 2-5) or PMA (100 ng/ml, 30 min; lanes 7-10). The cells were directly lysed and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-CD44cyto pAb as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, dependence of CD44 cleavage on extracellular calcium ion. U251MG cells were left untreated (lanes 1 and 5)or treated with IM7 mAb (1 μg/ml, 1 h; lanes 2 and 6), PMA (100 ng/ml, 30 min; lanes 3 and 7), or ionomycin (5 μm, 30 min; lanes 4 and 8) in PBS in the presence (lanes 1-4) or absence (lanes 5-8) of 1 mm calcium chloride.

To determine whether the ligation of CD44 promotes CD44-dependent cell migration through metalloproteinase-mediated CD44 cleavage, we performed modified Boyden chamber-type migration assays. As shown in Fig. 4A, IM7 mAb treatment enhanced the migration of U251MG cells on HA. The enhanced migration was inhibited by pretreatment with an anti-CD44 blocking mAb BRIC235 but not by a non-blocking mAb Hermes-3. These mAbs did not inhibit the basal level cell migration (data not shown). These results indicate that the migration enhanced by IM7 mAb treatment was dependent on the CD44-HA interaction.Fig. 4Engagement of CD44 promotes tumor cell migration on HA through the metalloproteinase-mediated CD44 cleavage.A, the effect of IM7 mAb on the migration of U251MG cells.

The structures of Rac1b in the GDP- and the GppNHp-bound forms, determined at a resolution of 1.75 Å, reveal that the insertion induces an open switch I conformation and a highly mobile switch II. As a consequence, Rac1b has an accelerated GEF-independent GDP/GTP exchange and an impaired GTP hydrolysis, which is restored partially by GTPase-activating proteins. Interestingly, Rac1b is able to bind the GTPase-binding domain of PAK but not full-length PAK in a GTP-dependent manner, suggesting that the insertion does not completely abolish effector interaction. The presented study provides insights into the structural and biochemical mechanism of a self-activating GTPase.

The presented study provides insights into the structural and biochemical mechanism of a self-activating GTPase. The small GTPase Rac acts as a binary molecular switch that cycles between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli. The interconversion between both states is controlled by nucleotide exchange and GTP hydrolysis. The structures of several GTPases in either state revealed that the switching mechanism depends on the conformational change of two regions, termed switch I and switch II (1Vetter I.R.

After GTP hydrolysis, release of the cleaved γ-phosphate allows the switch regions to relax into the GDP conformation. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), stimulating the GDP/GTP exchange, bind independently of the nucleotide-bound state (1Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A.

Rac1b was discovered in human tumors as an alternative splice variant of Rac1 containing a 19-amino acid insertion (between codons 75 and 76) at the end of the switch II region (9Jordan P. Brazao R. Boavida M.G. Gespach C. Chastre E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6835-6839Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 10Schnelzer A. Prechtel D. Knaus U. Dehne K. Gerhard M. Graeff H. Harbeck N. Schmitt M. Lengyel E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3013-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the insertion may create a novel effector-binding site in Rac1b and thus participate in signaling pathways related to the neoplastic growth of the intestinal mucosa (9Jordan P. Brazao R. Boavida M.G. Gespach C. Chastre E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6835-6839Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Most recently, it has been shown that Rac1b does not interact with Rho-GDI and PAK1 and is not involved in lamellipodia formation but able to activate the transcription factor NF-κB (11Matos P. Collard J.G. Jordan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50442-50448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We tried to address what influence this insertion might have on the structure and the biochemical properties of Rac1b in comparison with Rac1. Therefore, we solved the crystal structures of Rac1b in the GDP- and GppNHp-bound conformations at 1.75 Å resolution. Furthermore we investigated nucleotide binding and hydrolysis of Rac1b and studied its regulation by the RacGEF Tiam1 and p50GAP and its interaction with the downstream effector PAK. The Rac1b structures explain the drastic changes of the biochemical properties of Rac1b, namely a dramatic decrease in nucleotide affinity and GTP hydrolysis. The presented data identify Rac1b as a predominantly GTP-bound form of Rac1. Plasmids—The pcDNA3-FLAG constructs of human Rac1b, Rac1, and the respective constitutive active Rac1(G12V) mutant were generated by PCR and cloned via BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. Rac1, Rac1ΔC (1-184), Rac1b, and Rac1bΔC (1-201) were cloned in pGEX4T1, using BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. The DH-PH domain of Tiam1 (1033-1404) was cloned into pGEX4T1 using BamHI and XhoI restriction sites. The coding region of Tiam1 contains an internal BamHI site that was removed for the cloning procedure. pGEX-PAK1-GBD was kindly provided by J. Collard (12Reid T. Bathoorn A. Ahmadian M.R.

Preparation of Recombinant Proteins—Rac1, Rac1ΔC, Rac1b, and Rac1bΔC, the catalytic domain of p50GAP (amino acids 198-439), the Cdc42/Rac-interacting binding domain of PAK (amino acids 57-141), full-length PAK, and the DH-PH domain of Tiam1 were produced as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. All of the proteins were purified as described previously for Rnd3 (14Fiegen D. Blumenstein L. Stege P. Vetter I.R. Ahmadian M.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 525: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Nucleotide-free GTPases as well as fluorescent nucleotide-bound GTPases were prepared, and concentration and quality were determined as described (15Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Herrmann C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 189: 45-63PubMed Google Scholar). Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of truncated Rac1bΔC (1-184) in complex with GDP and GppNHp (nonhydrolyzable GTP analog) were grown at 20 °C using the hanging drop method by mixing 2 μl of a 0.5 mm solution of the Rac1b G domain in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithioerythritol, 100 μm GDP or GppNHp with 2 μl of reservoir solution consisting of 100 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, 18-30% polyethylene glycol 3350, and 2-6% isopropanol. The crystals of both complexes belonged to space group P212121 (a = 51.55 Å, b = 78.67 Å, c = 96.88 Å). For data collection at 100 K, the crystals were transferred to a solution containing reservoir solution and 10% glycerol. A cryo-protected crystal was then suspended in a rayon loop (Hampton Research) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected on an ADSC Q4 CCD detector at the beam line ID14-1 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility and were processed using XDS (16Kabsch W. J. Appl.

Stockley R.W. Dodson G. Webb M.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1mh1). After initial rigid body refinement, 20 cycles of simulated annealing and model building were performed. For the last refinement steps REFMAC5 was used (19Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). For the detection of crystallographic water molecules, ARP/wARP (20Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) and REFMAC5 were used. The residue ranges that were included in the final model as well as the corresponding R-factors are listed in Table I. For all four molecules the two additional N-terminal Gly-Ser residues caused by the thrombin cleavage site could be observed and were included in the model. Fluorescence Measurements—Long time fluorescence measurements were monitored on a LS50B PerkinElmer Life Sciences spectrofluorometer, and rapid kinetics were measured with a stopped flow apparatus (Applied Photophysics SX16MV) as described (15Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Herrmann C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 189: 45-63PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleotide association was performed with 0.1 μm fluorescent nucleotide and varying concentrations of nucleotide-free Rac proteins at 20 °C as described (15Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Herrmann C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 189: 45-63PubMed Google Scholar). The dissociation of the fluorescent nucleotide from Rac proteins (0.1 μm) was measured by the addition of 200-fold excess of nonfluorescent nucleotide in the absence and the presence of 5 μm Tiam1 DH-PH at 20 °C. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) for the PAK-GBD interaction with Rac1b was determined as previously described for the Ras-Raf kinase interaction (21Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The measurements were carried out using 0.2 μm mantGppNHp-bound GTPase, 40 μm GppNHp, and increasing concentrations of PAK-GBD at 25 °C for Rac1 and at 10 °C in the case of Rac1b because of its fast nucleotide dissociation rate. All of the measurements were carried out in 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 pH 7.5, 5 mm dithioerythritol. The observed rate constants were evaluated using Grafit (Erithacus software). GTPase Assay—The intrinsic and GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis reactions were measured by HPLC on a C18 reversed phase column using a mixture of 80 μm nucleotide-free GTPase and 70 μm GTP in the presence and the absence of 8 μm GAP at 25 °C in 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm dithioerythritol, 10 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 5 mm MgCl2 as described (15Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Herrmann C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 189: 45-63PubMed Google Scholar). The relative GTP content was calculated by the ratio of [GTP]/([GTP]+[GDP]). For exponential fitting of the data, the program Grafit (Erithacus software) was used. Transfection and GTPase Pull-down Assay—COS-7 cells were transfected using DEAE-dextran as described (12Reid T. Bathoorn A. Ahmadian M.R. Collard J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33587-33593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Pull-down assay for the active GTP-bound Rac proteins was carried out using GST-PAK-GBD (glutathione S-transferase-fused Rac-binding domain of PAK) conjugated with glutathione beads as described (12Reid T. Bathoorn A. Ahmadian M.R. Collard J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33587-33593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The interaction of full-length GST-PAK with the Rac proteins was examined under the same conditions using purified proteins. The beads were washed four times and subjected to SDS-PAGE (15% polyacrylamide). Bound Rac proteins were detected by Western blot using a monoclonal antibody against Rac (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc.). Rapid GEF-independent Nucleotide Dissociation Reaction of Rac1b—To investigate the influence of the 19-amino acid insertion on the nucleotide binding affinity, we first determined kinetic constants for the association of fluorescently (methylanthraniloyl- or mant-) labeled nucleotides to nucleotide-free Rac1b protein. This allowed us to monitor nucleotide association kinetics at increasing protein concentrations. As shown in Fig. 1A, the formation of the binary complex is not affected by the 19-amino acid insertion. The association rate constants (kon) for the binding of mantGDP and mantGTP to Rac1b were obtained by linear fitting of the observed rate constants at the given protein concentrations. They are only marginally slower than those of Rac1 (Table II).Table IIBiochemical properties of Rac1 and Rac1bRac1Rac1bmantGDPkon (S−1 M−1)2.47 × 1061.12 × 106koff (S−1)7.0 × 10−51.8 × 10−3Tiam 1-catalyzed koff(S−1)a5 μM Tiam 1 was applied in the reaction of 0.1 μM GTPase.3.6 × 10−31.9 × 10−3Kd (nM)0.0281.6mantGppNHpkon (S−1 M−1)1.05 × 106koff (S−1)1.1 × 10−42.9 × 10−2Kd (nM)27.6mantGTPkon (S−1 M−1)1.49 × 1061.05 × 106koff (S−1)1.0 × 10−42.7 × 10−3Kd (nM)0.0672.6GTP hydrolysisIntrinsic (min−1)0.110.0035GAP-stimulated (min−1)bThe GAP concentration (8 μM) was 10-fold below the GTPase concentration (80 μM).2.360.194PAK bindingKd (μM)0.493.55a 5 μM Tiam 1 was applied in the reaction of 0.1 μM GTPase.b The GAP concentration (8 μM) was 10-fold below the GTPase concentration (80 μM). Open table in a new tab To determine the intrinsic and GEF-accelerated nucleotide dissociation rates, Rac1b and Rac1 were loaded with the respective fluorescently labeled guanine nucleotides. The displacement of the fluorescent nucleotides was initiated by the addition of excess amounts of nonfluorescent nucleotides in the presence and absence of the DH-PH domain of Tiam1 (a Rac-specific GEF). Drastic increases in the intrinsic dissociation of mantGDP (26-fold), mantGTP (27-fold), and mantGppNHp (250-fold) from Rac1b compared with the very slow dissociation rates of the respective nucleotides from Rac1 were observed (Fig. 1B and Table II). Accordingly, the calculated Kd for nucleotide binding revealed that the 19-residue insertion dramatically affects the overall affinity for GDP, GTP, and particularly the GTP analog GppNHp (Table II). The reason for the reduced affinity of GppNHp compared with that of GTP is the disrupted hydrogen bond of the GTP-β,γ-bridging imino group to the main chain NH group of the P-loop residue Ala13. A similar observation has been reported for Ras·mantGppNHp (22Schmidt G. Lenzen C. Simon I. Deuter R. Cool R.H. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 87-96PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, in contrast to the slow nucleotide dissociation of Rac1, which could be 50-fold accelerated in the presence of the DH-PH domain of Tiam1, the fast intrinsic mantGDP dissociation of Rac1b could not be further increased by the DH-PH domain of Tiam1 (Fig. 1C and Table II). These in vitro results show that Rac1b does not require any GEF to get activated. It rather activates itself by a very fast nucleotide dissociation and by the subsequent binding of the cellular abundant GTP. Despite the drastically increased nucleotide dissociation, Rac1b exhibits a nucleotide binding affinity in the low nanomolar range, which is still high enough to act as a GTP-binding protein in cells. However, because the DH-PH domain of Tiam1 is a weak exchange factor in vitro (51Haeusler L.C. Blumenstein L. Stege P. Dvorsky R. Ahmadian M.R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and displays a 10 times higher activity on prenylated Rac1 bound to liposomes than on soluble unprenylated Rac1 (23Robbe K. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Antonny B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4756-4762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we cannot exclude the possibility that Rac1b can in principle interact with Tiam1 under cellular conditions as shown with constitutive active Tiam1, overexpressed in NIH3T3 cells (11Matos P. Collard J.G. Jordan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50442-50448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Impaired Intrinsic GTP Hydrolysis Reaction of Rac1b—A second crucial function of small GTPases is their slow intrinsic GTP hydrolysis reaction, which needs to be stimulated by GAPs to switch off downstream signaling. Therefore, we measured the GTP hydrolysis reaction of Rac1b in direct comparison with that of Rac1 using a HPLC-based technique. Interestingly, we found that the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis reaction of Rac1b (0.0035 min-1) was about 30-fold reduced compared with that of Rac1 (0.11 min-1) (Fig. 1D and Table II). In contrast to our results it has been previously published that Rac1 and Rac1b show the same GTPase activity (10Schnelzer A. Prechtel D. Knaus U. Dehne K. Gerhard M. Graeff H. Harbeck N. Schmitt M. Lengyel E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3013-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). This discrepancy can be explained by the method this group employed. The filter binding assay seems to be inappropriate for a protein with a fast nucleotide dissociation such as Rac1b. Unlike the constitutive active mutants of Rac1 (G12V in the P-loop and Q61L in the switch II region) that also have an impaired intrinsic GTP hydrolysis (24Xu X. Wang Y. Barry D.C. Chanock S.J. Bokoch G.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the defective GTPase reaction of Rac1b can be restored by GAP proteins. As shown in Fig. 1D, the catalytic domain of p50GAP stimulated the GTPase reaction of Rac1b up to 55-fold (21-fold for Rac1), showing that GAP is able to stabilize the catalytic elements of Rac1b and thus accelerate the GTPase reaction. High Level of Rac1b·GTP in COS-7 Cells—Considering the increased nucleotide dissociation and the decreased GTP hydrolysis, it was tempting to assume that Rac1b is GTP-bound in cells. To prove this assumption, Rac1, its constitutive active mutant Rac1(G12V) and Rac1b were overexpressed in COS-7 cells under serum-starved conditions for 48 h. The fact that wild-type Rac1b could be pulled down with GST-PAK-GBD verifies our hypothesis that Rac1b exists in an active conformation in serum-starved cells. Thereby it resembles the constitutive active Rac1(G12V) mutant (Fig. 2A). As expected wild-type Rac1 could not be detected under these conditions and obviously needs GEF proteins to be activated. A GTP-dependent Rac1b-PAK interaction was demonstrated by performing the pull-down assay with purified GDP- and GppNHp-bound Rac1b. As shown in Fig. 2B, GST-PAK-GBD selectively binds Rac1b·GppNHp but not Rac1b·GDP, similar to the Rac1 control experiment. These results reveal that Rac1b is, independent of external stimuli, GTP-bound in cells and can selectively interact with Rac effector proteins. Rac1 involvement in transcription and growth control and its requirement for Ras-induced malignant transformation is widely known (25Qiu R.G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 26Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar, 27Zohn I.E.

Nature. 2002; 417: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). This knowledge is based on experiments using the expression of a constitutively active Rac1(G12V) mutant. A fast cycling mutant of Cdc42, Cdc42(F28L), has been shown to undergo spontaneous nucleotide exchange in the absence of a GEF while maintaining full GTPase activity (30Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). This mutant has an even greater cell-transforming potential in fibroblasts compared with the constitutively active Cdc42(G12V) mutant. However, our biochemical data clearly shows that Rac1b behaves as a self-activating GTPase that is predominantly GTP-bound in cells. Low Affinity Binding of Rac1b to PAK-GBD—To characterize the effect of the insertion on effector interaction, we determined equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) of PAK-GBD binding to GppNHp-bound Rac1b and Rac1 using the GDI assay (31Herrmann C. Horn G. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6794-6800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, increasing concentrations of PAK-GBD resulted in incremental inhibition of the mantGppNHp dissociation from Rac1b and Rac1. We obtained a Kd value of 0.49 μm for the PAK-GBD interaction with Rac1, which nicely corresponds to previous reports (32Thompson G. Owen D. Chalk P.A. Lowe P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7885-7891Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). For Rac1b we observed a 7-fold reduced binding affinity of PAK-GBD. The lower Kd of 3.55 μm can be most likely attributed to the 19-amino acid insertion. MantGDP dissociation from Rac1b was not inhibited under these conditions (data not shown), confirming the GTP-dependent interaction of Rac1b with PAK-GBD. Furthermore, we examined the interaction of Rac1 and Rac1b with full-length PAK using a GST pull-down assay. Fig. 2B shows that we could not detect binding of Rac1b to full-length PAK, and hence Rac1b stands in contrast to Rac1. Compared with the high affinity binding of the isolated PAK-GBD domains to Cdc42, it has been recently shown that full-length PAK has a much lower binding affinity for Cdc42 (13Buchwald G. Hostinova E. Rudolph M.G. Kraemer A. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Scheffzek K. Wittinghofer A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5179-5189Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 32Thompson G. Owen D.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Assuming that this is also true for Rac1, our biochemical data suggest an extremely low affinity of full-length PAK for Rac1b. Conserved Overall Structure of Rac1b·GDP and Rac1b· GppNHp—To gain insight into the structural impact of the 19-amino acid insertion of Rac1b, we determined the crystal structures of Rac1b in the GDP- and GppNHp-bound states. The crystals diffracted to 1.75 Å resolution (Table I). Size exclusion chromatography showed that Rac1b is monomeric in solution (data not shown), but it crystallized as a dimer with two molecules/asymmetric unit in a head to head fashion. The contact surface has a size of 1347 Å2 and is build up by β1 to β3, α1, and the switch I of both molecules. Both molecules in the asymmetric unit are very similar as can be derived from the low root mean square deviation of 0.45 Å for 165 common Cα atoms. The ribbon representation in Fig. 4 shows the secondary structure elements of Rac1b·GDP and Rac1b·GppNHp superimposed on the GppNHp-bound Rac1 (18Hirshberg M. Stockley R.W. Dodson G. Webb M.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The overall structures of both nucleotide-bound forms of Rac1b are remarkably similar to each other and conserved as compared with the structures of Rac1·GppNHp (18Hirshberg M. Stockley R.W. Dodson G. Webb M.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), RhoA·GTPγS (34Ihara K. Muraguchi S. Kato M. Shimizu T. Shirakawa M. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K.

https://openalex.org/W2129762934,"Cellular ATP depletion in diverse cell types results in the net conversion of monomeric G-actin to polymeric F-actin and is an important aspect of cellular injury in tissue ischemia. We propose that this conversion results from altering the ratio of ATP-G-actin and ADP-G-actin, causing a net decrease in the concentration of thymosinactin complexes as a consequence of the differential affinity of thymosin β4 for ATP- and ADP-G-actin. To test this hypothesis we examined the effect of ATP depletion induced by antimycin A and substrate depletion on actin polymerization, the nucleotide state of the monomer pool, and the association of actin monomers with thymosin and profilin in the kidney epithelial cell line LLC-PK1. ATP depletion for 30 min increased F-actin content to 145% of the levels under physiological conditions, accompanied by a corresponding decrease in G-actin content. Cytochalasin D treatment did not reduce F-actin formation during ATP depletion, indicating that it was predominantly not because of barbed end monomer addition. ATP-G-actin levels decreased rapidly during depletion, but there was no change in the concentration of ADP-G-actin monomers. The decrease in ATP-G-actin levels could be accounted for by dissociation of the thymosin-G-actin binary complex, resulting in a rise in the concentration of free thymosin β4 from 4 to 11 μm. Increased detection of profilin-actin complexes during depletion indicated that profilin may participate in catalyzing nucleotide exchange during depletion.

This mechanism provides a biochemical basis for the accumulation of F-actin aggregates in ischemic cells. Recent progress in understanding the function of actin-binding proteins has clarified their role in a number of processes in normal cells, including motility and the establishment of cell polarity (1Nelson W.J. Nature. 2003; 422: 766-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 2Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3303) Google Scholar). However, our understanding of actin dynamics and the roles of actin-binding proteins under conditions of cellular stress pertinent to pathophysiology is currently limited (3Atkinson S.J. Molitoris B.A. Molitoris B.A. Finn W.F. Acute Renal Failure: A Companion to Brenner and Rector's The Kidney. 1st Ed. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia2001Google Scholar). For example, in tissue ischemia the lack of oxygen and nutrients is known to rapidly result in decreased intracellular ATP levels and increased ADP levels, varying in degree with the severity and duration of ischemic time (4Gerlach E. Deuticke B. Dreisbach R. Rosarious C. Pflügers Arch. 1963; 278: 296-315Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 5Weinberg J.M. Kidney Int. 1991; 39: 476-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). These results have been associated with a concomitant decrease in cellular G-actin and a corresponding increase in the fraction of polymerized actin observed both in vivo and in vitro (6Sutton T.A.

Physiol. 2001; 281: C1858-C1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells maintain a high potential energy for actin polymerization by maintaining a high total actin concentration and reserving a large fraction of this actin in a pool of monomers available for polymerization. This is of considerable functional importance for the cell, because the rate of actin polymerization is directly proportional to the local free monomer concentration (17Cooper J.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 585-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, this high concentration requires the deployment of actin-binding proteins to maintain the monomer pool because, in the absence of other factors, all actin in excess of the dissociation equilibrium constant for subunit binding (commonly termed the critical concentration) polymerizes. The high concentration of actin monomer is maintained by the activity of actin monomer-binding proteins (18Sun H.Q. Kwiatkowska K. Yin H.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In most metazoan cells a large fraction of the monomer pool is probably associated with thymosins (T) 1The abbreviations used are: TthymosinTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. (19Nachmias V.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These low molecular weight (∼5,000) proteins act as monomer-sequestering factors in which thymosin-bound ATP-G-actin is unable to associate with filament ends or other monomers. The predominant forms of thymosin are thymosin β4 and, to a much lesser extent, thymosin β10. In contrast, profilin-bound monomers are able to associate with actin filament barbed ends (fast growing ends; the predominant site for actin polymerization in the cell), but association with filament pointed ends and spontaneous nucleation, or de novo polymerization, is blocked (20Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6631-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 21Vinson V.K. De La Cruz E.M. Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10871-10880Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In most vertebrate cell types the concentration of the various forms of thymosin far exceeds that of profilin so that under normal physiological conditions the bulk of the monomer pool is associated with thymosin (22Cassimeris L. Safer D. Nachmias V.T. Zigmond S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1261-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The association and dissociation rates for the interaction between thymosin and actin are rapid and result in a very small pool of free G-actin (concentration <1 μm) and rapid flux of monomers between the thymosin-bound pool and F-actin (23Carlier M.F. Jean C. Rieger K.J. Lenfant M. Pantaloni D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5034-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). thymosin tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. Actin monomers bind either ATP or ADP, and both forms of G-actin are competent for polymerization. However, the nature of the bound nucleotide modulates the kinetics of association and dissociation, with distinct effects at the barbed and pointed ends of the filament (24Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Moreover, the affinities of ATP- and ADP-G-actin monomers for thymosin and profilin differ considerably. Both profilin and thymosin β4 bind ATP monomers with higher affinity than ADP monomers (21Vinson V.K. De La Cruz E.M. Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10871-10880Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 23Carlier M.F. Jean C. Rieger K.J. Lenfant M. Pantaloni D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5034-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), but the difference in affinity is greater by far for thymosin (KD(ADP) 100 μm, KD(ATP) 0.6 μm) (23Carlier M.F. Jean C. Rieger K.J. Lenfant M. Pantaloni D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5034-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In normal cells this preference for ATP monomers ensures that the pool of unpolymerized actin consists almost entirely of ATP-G-actin with no significant amount of ADP-G-actin in the thymosin-sequestered pool (25Safer D. Nachmias V.T. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 26De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Brundage R.A. Reddy K.S. Sweeney H.L. Safer D. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2516-2527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Conceivably, conditions such as ischemia that result in the depletion of ATP-G-actin and accumulation of ADP-G-actin would result in decreased levels of thymosin-bound actin as a direct result of the differential affinity of thymosin for ATP- and ADP-actin (Fig. 1B). The actin monomers thus released would increase the free monomer concentration to levels that exceed the critical concentration for polymerization, resulting in rapid polymerization at available nuclei or even, perhaps, initiation of new filament growth. To directly test this hypothesis, which predicts that ATP depletion will result in decreased concentrations of ATP-actin monomers and increased free thymosin β4, we measured the concentrations of ATP, ADP, ATP-monomer, ADP-monomer, and thymosin-monomer using the mitochondrial poison antimycin A and substrate depletion to induce ATP depletion and mimic ischemia in LLC-PK1 cells. Cell Culture—A clonal line of LLC-PK1 cells was grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum containing penicillin/streptomycin, passaged once per week with 0.5% trypsin/EDTA, and seeded at a 1:8 dilution. Cultures typically reached confluence 2 or 3 days after seeding, and experiments were performed 48 h after confluence in 60- or 100-mm plates. Chemicals and culture media were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. ATP Depletion—Cells were ATP-depleted by incubating in depleted media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without glucose, pyruvate, or amino acids) containing 0.1 μm antimycin A for up to 30 min as previously described (27Molitoris B.A. Dahl R. Hosford M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F790-F798PubMed Google Scholar). For experiments measuring the effect of variable cellular levels of ATP on actin polymerization, cells were depleted in depletion media containing 0–1000 mg/liter glucose. In some experiments, cells were incubated in 0.1 μm cytochalasin D for 30 min before depletion and during cellular ATP depletion. Cellular G-actin Isolation in Triton X-100-soluble Protein Extracts— Cells were extracted with 200 μl of Triton extraction buffer (0.1% Triton X-100 in PHEM (60 mm 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid, 25 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, and 2 mm MgSO4) with CLAP (10 μg/ml each chymostatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin), and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with 20 μm latrunculin A (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and 0.1 mg/ml phalloidin. Two 100-μl aliquots per plate of supernatant were spun through PHEM buffer-equilibrated P-6 spin columns (Bio-Rad) to remove free nucleotides at 2000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. To isolate actin with its bound nucleotide, we used immobilized DNase I (28Rosenblatt J. Peluso P. Mitchison T.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Adenine Nucleotide Measurements—Nucleotide content was normalized to the protein present in each sample. Cellular ATP and ADP were determined by high performance liquid chromatography as previously described (29Dagher P.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1270-C1277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular F-actin Measurement—F-actin content was measured by an adaptation of the method of Cano et al. (30Cano M.L. Lauffenburger D.A. Zigmond S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) for cells grown in a 96-well plate. Following treatment, cells were aspirated, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature, and stained for 1 h with a solution containing 2.3 μm TRITC-phalloidin, 14.3 μm 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole, 0.5% Triton X-100 in PHEM buffer. Fluorescence was measured on a CytoFluor II fluorescent plate reader (PerSeptive Biosystems; Framingham, MA) at 530 × 620 nm for actin phalloidin staining and 360 × 460 nm for nuclear 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. Total and Free Cellular Thymosin β4 Measurement—Cells were extracted with Triton extraction buffer as described above. Free and actin-bound Tβ4 were separated by centrifuging extracts through a Microcon spin filter (10-kDa molecular mass) (Amicon, Beverly, MA) for 60 s at 14,000 × g. Free thymosin was collected in the filtrate, and thymosin bound to G-actin remained in the retentate. Total Tβ4 was isolated based on its stability against heat denaturation. Tβ4 was measured by densitometry methods against platelet Tβ4 standards. Detection of Tβ4 and Profilin by Immunoblotting—Native or denaturing gels were incubated in 0.4% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (15 min for denaturing gels or 5 min for native gels) prior to transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Rabbit anti-Tβ4 IgG (1:200 in blocking solution) (generously provided by Dr. Vivian Nachmias, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) or rabbit anti-human platelet profilin (gift of Don Kaiser and Tom Pollard, Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) was used for immunodetection. Detection of Tβ4-Actin and Profilin-Actin Complexes by Native Gel Electrophoresis—Triton extracts were subjected to native gel electrophoresis according to the method of Safer (31Safer D. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 178: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Tβ4-actin complexes were detected by the shift in migration of actin detected on immunoblots probed with the anti-actin monoclonal antibody JLA20 (Sigma). Profilin-actin complexes were detected by immunoblotting for actin (JLA20) and profilin (see under “Detection of Tβ4 and Profilin by Immunoblotting”). Rat Renal Proximal Tubule Isolation Procedure—Rat renal proximal tubules were isolated using an adaptation of the method of Weinberg (32Weinberg J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1193-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Kidney cortex was sliced in 100-μm sections, incubated in a 5% CO2, 95% O2 gassed Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer with collagenase at 37 °C for 30 min, and passed through a wire mesh strainer. The tubules were separated from glomeruli by 48% Percoll gradient. Intracellular Protein Concentrations—Cell volume was estimated by subtracting the dilution ratio of mannitol from tritiated water after a 30-min incubation with 0.2 μCi/ml [14C]mannitol and 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]-labeled water (ICN Biomedicals, Irvine CA). Intracellular soluble protein concentration (μg of soluble protein/μl of intracellular volume) was calculated by dividing the supernatant protein per plate by the intracellular volume per plate. ATP Depletion Results in Net Conversion of G- to F-Actin—We used ATP depletion in a clonal line of LLC-PK1 cells as a model of ischemic injury (33Canfield P.E. Geerdes A.M. Molitoris B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F1038-F1045PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were treated with the mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 inhibitor antimycin A (0.1 μm) and with substrate-depleted medium to eliminate both oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis as sources of ATP. The intracellular ATP concentration fell rapidly in response to this treatment (Fig. 2A), from control levels of 1.7 to 0.03 mm after 15 min of depletion. The concentration of ADP rose to a peak of 0.55 mm at 5 min of depletion, decreasing to 0.2 mm at 30 min. The ratio of ATP:(ATP+ADP) fell from 93 to 25% by 15 min (Fig. 2A) and decreased further to 15% by 30 min of ATP depletion. To quantitatively assess the effect of depleting intracellular ATP on the actin cytoskeleton, we measured the fraction of filamentous and monomeric actin as a function of the duration of ATP depletion (Fig. 2B). Total cellular F-actin was determined by quantifying the binding of fluorescent phalloidin (a fungal alkaloid that specifically binds filamentous but not monomeric actin) to fixed, permeabilized cells, and G-actin was quantified based on its ability to inhibit the hydrolytic activity of DNase I. With ATP depletion times of up to 30 min there was a roughly linear increase in the filamentous fraction of actin, to a maximum level 45% higher than that observed under physiological conditions (Fig. 2B). Independent measurements documented a decrease in the monomeric fraction of actin, to 50% below the level under physiological conditions, consistent with the increase in F-actin. The total intracellular actin concentration measured by immunoblotting was 27 μm, whereas the base-line G-actin concentration was 16 μm (Table I). Therefore, the alterations observed in G- and F-actin levels represent a decrease in monomeric actin from 16 to 8 μm, with a corresponding increase in F-actin from ∼11 to 19 μm; values that are consistent within the error in the data. Continued ATP depletion beyond 30 min did not result in further significant increases in the F-actin content, which remained at 30–40% above base line after 60 min of ATP depletion. We also measured the extent of F-actin incorporation in a Triton X-100-insoluble fraction using high speed centrifugation (48,000 × g) to pellet large filaments or filaments cross-linked into the bulk cytoskeleton (Fig. 2C). The additional F-actin formed after 30 and 60 min of depletion was incorporated into the Triton-insoluble material that was recovered in the high speed pellet. No significant additional incorporation into small oligomeric filaments (437,000 × g) was observed (data not shown). Actin polymerization triggered by ATP depletion was not the result of additional synthesis of actin monomers, as cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) treatment had no effect on F-actin levels during depletion or recovery (data not shown). As previously shown in our studies and by other investigators (7Molitoris B.A. Geerdes A. McIntosh J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), ATP-depleted cells lost microvillar actin bundles and stress fibers and, instead, accumulated phalloidin-staining aggregates throughout the cytoplasm, particularly in the perinuclear area (not shown).Table IBase-line intracellular concentrations of actin and actin-binding proteinsLLC-PK1 cellsIsolated rat cortical tubules, percent soluble proteinIntracellular concentrationPercent soluble proteinμmTotal actin27.9 ± 6.8NDNDG-actin15.8 ± 7.27.6 ± 1.311.9 ± 0.6Thymosin β411.1 ± 3.81.24 ± 0.11.24 ± 0.01Profilin2.0 ± 0.40.38 ± 0.070.86 ± 0.05 Open table in a new tab To further explore the nature of the process leading to F-actin formation in ATP-depleted cells, we incubated cells with the fungal toxin cytochalasin D (0.1 μm) to inhibit actin filament elongation by monomer addition onto filament barbed ends (Fig. 2D) (34Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1473-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, cytochalasin D had little effect on F-actin accumulation during ATP depletion and, in fact, resulted in significantly increased F-actin accumulation after 15 min of ATP depletion (p < 0.01). We next sought to determine the energy level below which actin polymerization was initiated. To accomplish this we added back a range of glucose concentrations to the medium during 30 min of antimycin A treatment (Fig. 3). In the presence of antimycin A the intracellular ATP:ADP ratio varied linearly as a function of the glucose concentration over a range of glucose concentrations from 0 to 60 mg/liter. At glucose concentrations greater than 40 mg/ml, in which the ATP:ADP ratio was greater than 0.31, there was no effect on F-actin levels, but at lower glucose concentrations, in which the ATP: ADP ratio fell below 0.3 (intracellular ATP and ADP concentrations of 22 μm and 72 μm, respectively), a progressive increase in F-actin content was observed. The F-actin content was a linear function of the decrease in the ATP:ADP ratio below 0.3 as the glucose concentration was decreased from 40 to 1 mg/liter (ATP concentrations are 22–15 μm, with ADP concentrations remaining roughly constant in the range of 65–75 μm). Effect of ATP Depletion on the Nucleotide Bound to the Monomer Pool—To determine the effect of ATP depletion on the nucleotide state of G-actin, we isolated unpolymerized G-actin monomers by binding them to DNase I immobilized on beads and measured the fraction of ATP and ADP associated with the monomers (Fig. 4). We included latrunculin B and phalloidin in the isolation buffer to inhibit nucleotide exchange (35Ayscough K.R. Stryker J. Pokala N. Sanders M. Crews P. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) and polymerization or depolymerization during the isolation procedure. As previously noted, the cellular concentration of G-actin declined with ATP depletion, from 16 to 5 μm in control cells after 15 min of ATP depletion (Fig. 4). There was a corresponding decrease in the concentration of ATP G-actin. However, the concentration of ADP G-actin remained essentially constant at approximately 0.5 μm throughout the time course. Role of Monomer-binding Proteins—To evaluate the potential importance of different classes of actin monomer-binding proteins, we measured their concentrations in the LLC-PK1 cells used for these experiments (Table I). Thymosin β4 was present at high concentrations (26 ± 8.8 μm), approaching the concentration of G-actin in the cells under normal growth conditions (31 ± 7.2 μm). The concentration of profilin was much lower (2.0 ± 0.4 μm). As a comparison we measured the levels of these proteins as a fraction of the total soluble protein in LLC-PK1 cells and in cortical tissue (primarily proximal tubule epithelial cells) isolated from rat kidney. Levels in isolated tubules were very similar to those found in the LLC-PK1 cells (Table I), confirming the physiological significance of our results for ischemic injury in the kidney. To quantitatively analyze the effect of ATP depletion on G-actin association with sequestering proteins, we used filters with a molecular weight cutoff of 10,000 to separate the free fraction of thymosin β4 from the fraction associated with G-actin (Fig. 5A). In cells under normal growth conditions the concentration of free thymosin β4 was ∼4 μm, rising to 11 μm after 15 min of ATP depletion (Fig. 5B). This corresponds to a release of all thymosin-bound actin monomers in the first 15 min of ATP depletion. We next compared the relative abundance of thymosin-actin complexes by native gel electrophoresis, using immunoblotting with anti-actin antibodies to confirm the identity of the complexes observed (Fig. 5C). On native gels, thymosin-actin complexes migrate slightly ahead of free actin monomers, probably because thymosin binding restricts the repertoire of conformations available to actin (Fig. 5C, arrow) (26De La Cruz E.M. Ostap E.M. Brundage R.A. Reddy K.S. Sweeney H.L. Safer D. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 2516-2527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 36Safer D. Golla R. Nachmias V.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2536-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). On native gels of control cell extracts G-actin migrated predominantly in the fast migrating, thymosin-bound fraction (Fig. 5C, lane 1, arrow), whereas in extracts from cells subjected to 15 min of ATP depletion less G-actin was detected, and the electrophoretic mobility profile was characteristic of free actin monomers (Fig. 5C, lane 2). We also used native gel electrophoresis (31Safer D. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 178: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) to analyze the extent of actin monomer association with profilin (Fig. 5D). Immunoblotting showed increased levels of profilin co-migrating with actin monomer in extracts from cells depleted for 15 min (compare Fig. 5D, lanes 4 and 5) that was reversed by the addition of an ATP regenerating system to the extract (lane 6). In this report we show evidence for a direct causal mechanism for unregulated actin polymerization based on the differential affinity of ATP- and ADP-actin monomers for the highly abundant monomer sequestering protein thymosin β4. We confirmed that ATP depletion induced by substrate depletion and antimycin A resulted in net conversion of G-actin to F-actin. The increase in the fraction of cellular actin recovered by centrifugation or labeled as polymer by phalloidin binding was essentially complete in the first 15 min of depletion. Experiments in which we manipulated the ATP:ADP ratio by incubating the cells in limiting concentrations of glucose point to a mechanism that directly involves the ATP concentration or the ATP:ADP ratio because they showed a critical threshold ATP: ADP ratio below which there was an inverse linear relationship between ATP:ADP ratio and net F-actin formation, suggestive of a direct biochemical mechanism. Prolonged treatment with antimycin A and substrate depletion resulted in the loss of adenine nucleotides as shown previously in models of renal ischemia, both in vivo and in vivo (29Dagher P.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1270-C1277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Venkatachalam M.A. Patel Y.J. Kreisberg J.I. Weinberg J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 81: 745-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), because myokinase converts ADP to AMP, and AMP is further catabolized to IMP or adenosine, which is lost from cells by leakage and secretion (5Weinberg J.M. Kidney Int. 1991; 39: 476-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). F-actin formation during ATP depletion was not inhibited by treatment with cytochalasin D, and in fact, we observed that cytochalasin-treated cells accumulated significantly more F-actin than in the absence of the drug. At the concentration used here (0.1 μm) cytochalasin D binds actin monomers and incompletely inhibits the addition of monomers onto the barbed ends of actin filaments (34Cooper J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1473-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar), with more potent inhibition of the addition of ATP-actin than of ADP-actin. Our results using cytochalasin imply that much of the F-actin formed during ATP depletion does not arise by barbed end polymerization (the mechanism that accounts for the bulk of actin polymerization induced by normal stimuli) but rather by pointed end addition, which is inhibited to a much lesser degree by cytochalasin treatment. As pointed out by Sampath and Pollard (38Sampath P. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1973-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), the conversion of ATP- to ADP-actin may be accelerated by cytochalasin treatment, which could account for the significantly higher levels of F-actin in depleted cells treated with cytochalasin compared with those in the absence of the drug. The dissipation of this effect at later time points supports a kinetic interpretation of this effect. These results suggest that the mechanism of F-actin formation in ATP-depleted cells is markedly differently than that which prevails when ATP predominates over ADP as it does in normal healthy cells, in which case pointed end polymerization is insignificant for several reasons: 1) the critical concentration for polymerization of ATP monomers is 20-fold lower at the barbed end than at the pointed end; 2) monomers bound to profilin are able to add onto filament barbed ends but not onto pointed ends or to participate in de novo filament formation; and 3) the pointed ends of most actin filaments in the cytoskeleton of normal cells are inaccessible for monomer addition because most are capped (2Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3303) Google Scholar). However, in the conditions that prevail during ischemia or in model ATP depletion, assuming that most actin monomers are in the ADP-bound form, the critical concentrations do not differ appreciably between the pointed and barbed ends (24Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), and monomers will more readily dissociate from profilin because of the 5–8-fold lower affinity of profilin for ADP monomers (21Vinson V.K. De La Cruz E.M. Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10871-10880Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and thus be available for pointed end addition. Our model (Fig. 1) makes the following predictions. 1) The concentration of thymosin β4 is high enough in these cells to sequester a substantial fraction of the unpolymerized ATP-G-actin. We measured a concentration of thymosin β4 in LLC-PK1 cells of 11 μm, a value that lies within the error for the measured concentration of G-actin in these cells at base line. 2) ATP depletion results in a decrease in the concentration of ATP monomers but not ADP monomers. We measured a steep decline in ATP-G-actin concentration but little alteration in ADP-G-actin concentration during depletion. Indeed, the ratio of ATP:ADP monomers after 30 min of depletion (Fig. 4, roughly 5:1) is much higher than would be expected from the 1:7 ratio of ATP:ADP in the cytosol at this time point (which, with the 3-fold higher affinity of monomer for ATP, would predict a 1:2 ratio of ATP:ADP monomer), consistent with flux of ADP monomers from the unpolymerized to the polymerized state. 3) The concentration of free (unbound) thymosin increases in proportion to the decrease in the concentration of the G-actin pool. 4) Increased levels of profilin-actin complexes could increase the rate of exchange of ADP for ATP on actin monomers. The data presented here support all aspects of this model. ADF/cofilin proteins bind actin monomers (in addition to their effects on actin filaments) and are dephosphorylated and thereby activated during ATP depletion. The concentration of ADF in these LLC-PK1 cells is low (0.2 μm; Ref. 39Ashworth S.L. Southgate E.L. Sandoval R.M. Meberg P.J. Bamburg J.R. Molitoris B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F852-F862Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)) but there are higher levels of cofilin present that we estimate to be equivalent to the levels of profilin. Although ADF/cofilin binds tightly to ADP monomers, profilin effectively competes for binding (21Vinson V.K. De La Cruz E.M. Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10871-10880Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 40Mockrin S.C. Korn E.D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5359-5362Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and would prevent sequestration of a significant fraction of these monomers in ATP-depleted cells. ADF/cofilin can also markedly increases the rate of polymerization of ADP-actin at both ends of actin filaments (41Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25106-25111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and so could accelerate the rate of F-actin formation during depletion. Release of ATP-actin monomers from thymosin β4 occurs as part of the mechanism that drives rapid actin polymerization in the normal function of the cytoskeleton in cell morphology and cell motility (42Pantaloni D. Carlier M.F. Cell. 1993; 75: 1007-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Thymosin maintains the bulk of the monomer pool in the cells of metazoans, thanks to its abundance and relatively high affinity for ATP monomers (22Cassimeris L. Safer D. Nachmias V.T. Zigmond S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1261-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Maintenance of a high concentration of available monomers at nuclei or filament barbed ends is necessary for rapid actin polymerization. The low affinity of the interaction between ADP monomers and thymosin is necessary to allow monomers to be handed on so that catalysis of nucleotide exchange by profilin regenerates ATP monomers for rapid addition onto filament barbed ends. Not all eukaryotic cell types express high concentrations of thymosin β4 or equivalent sequestering proteins. In amoeba, for example, the concentration of profilin is sufficient, based on its affinity for actin, to account for the entire monomer pool, and thymosin-like factors do not seem to play a significant role (21Vinson V.K. De La Cruz E.M. Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10871-10880Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 43Kaiser D.A. Vinson V.K. Murphy D.B. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3779-3790PubMed Google Scholar). It would perhaps be instructive to compare the effect of ATP depletion in cells such as these that operate in the absence of thymosin. It is interesting to note that in cell types that normally express significant quantities of thymosin its loss is associated with changes, including formation of actin clumps, that are remarkably congruent with the consequences of ischemia or ATP depletion (44Iguchi K. Usami Y. Hirano K. Hamatake M. Shibata M. Ishida R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1105-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is tempting to rationalize the cytoskeletal changes we describe into some protective mechanism that has evolved to respond to an energy crisis in the cell. Indeed, it has been shown that inhibition of actin dynamics in neurons subjected to ATP depletion can result in reduced levels of cell death (44Iguchi K. Usami Y. Hirano K. Hamatake M. Shibata M. Ishida R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1105-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, because our mechanism seems to result directly from the fundamental properties of the system of actin and monomer-binding proteins this may not be the case. It is notable that cells such as the free living protozoa and fungi that are exposed to direct selection in favor of surviving episodes of energy depletion are the very cell types that do not use thymosin as part of their actin regulation (2Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3303) Google Scholar, 21Vinson V.K. De La Cruz E.M. Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D.

Whatever advantage is conferred by the additional monomer buffering provided by thymosin may be outweighed by the disadvantageous effects of the release of a large fraction of the pool when the cell is stressed energetically. Further studies will be necessary to determine whether polymerization of monomers by the mechanism described here is directly toxic to cells. We thank Vivian Nachmias, Tom Pollard, and Don Kaiser for antibodies. We are grateful to Vivian Nachmias for valuable insight and help with methods for analysis of thymosin and to John Cooper for important comments and criticism."

The mouse NCKX6 protein is 585 amino acids long and shares about 62% sequence similarity with previously identified exchangers in the α-repeat regions but has little primary sequence similarity outside these regions. NCKX6 transcripts of 4 kb are abundantly expressed in all tissues examined and are thus more broadly distributed than previously described NC(K)X family members. Two alternatively spliced products of this novel gene were identified that encode proteins of different length. The short isoform differs from the full-length isoform at the C-terminal hydrophobic domain as a result of a shift in the reading frame caused by the deletion of two exons. Both NCKX6 isoforms were expressed in HEK-293 cells. Functional analysis by digital imaging of fura-2 loaded transfected HEK-293 cells demonstrated that the short isoform exhibited K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity whereas the full-length isoform did not. The latter was retained within the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas the short isoform was present at the plasma membrane in transfected cells. Immunofluorescence studies examining NCKX6 expression in native tissue using an NCKX6-specific antibody showed intense labeling of the cardiac sarcolemmal membrane. The discovery of NCKX6 therefore reveals a novel member of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger superfamily whose ubiquitous expression in all tissues suggests an important role for K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+ exchange in maintaining cellular Ca2+ homeostasis in diverse tissues and cell types.

Calcium signaling plays an important role in mediating numerous cellular processes in virtually all types of animal cells (1Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4116) Google Scholar). In order to maintain long term cellular Ca2+ homeostasis, Ca2+ entering the cytoplasm to initiate a signal must be removed once the signal has been terminated. Plasma membrane Na+/Ca2+ exchangers are a major pathway for transmembrane Ca2+ efflux and have been extensively investigated in a wide range of tissues, particularly in the heart and brain (2Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar, 3Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Detailed functional and molecular studies have revealed the existence of two families of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger genes encoding proteins that share sequence similarity in two internally homologous domains known as α-repeats (4Schwarz E.M. Benzer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10249-10254Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).

The NCX family is composed of three distinct gene products: NCX1 (SLC8A1) (8Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), NCX2 (SLC8A2) (9Li Z. Matsuoka S. Hryshko L.V. Nicoll D.A. Bersohn M.M. Burke E.P. Lifton R.P. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17434-17439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and NCX3 (SLC8A3) (10Nicoll D.A. Quednau B.D. Qui Z. Xia Y.R. Lusis A.J. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24914-24921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). NCX1 is expressed at high levels in cardiac muscle, brain, and kidney and is also present to a lesser extent in many other tissues (11Lee S.L. Yu A.S. Lytton J. J. Biol.

NCX2 and NCX3, in contrast, are expressed primarily in only two tissues, brain and skeletal muscle (9Li Z. Matsuoka S. Hryshko L.V. Nicoll D.A. Bersohn M.M. Burke E.P. Lifton R.P. Philipson K.D. J.

All three exchangers share about 70% overall amino acid identity that rises to more than 80% within the predicted transmembrane segments (TMS) (10Nicoll D.A. Quednau B.D. Qui Z. Xia Y.R. Lusis A.J. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24914-24921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). NCX1 and NCX3, but not NCX2, undergo tissue-specific alternative splicing, which occurs in a small region of the large intracellular loop of the exchanger (12Quednau B.D. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1250-C1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second family, K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+ exchangers (NCKX), catalyzes the electrogenic countertransport of 4 Na+ for 1 Ca2+ and 1 K+ (13Cervetto L. Lagnado L. Perry R.J. Robinson D.W. McNaughton P.A.

NCKX exchangers differ from NCX proteins in their absolute requirement for K+, lower Ca2+ transport rates, and primary amino acid sequence outside the α-repeats (2Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1443) Google Scholar). NCKX1 (SLC24A1) was initially cloned from bovine rod photoreceptors where it was believed to play a central and unique role in the mammalian phototransduction pathway because its ionic stoichiometry allowed the maintenance of Ca2+ extrusion despite the unusual ionic environment of the vertebrate photoreceptors (15Reilander H.

Evidence from functional measurements, however, suggested the existence of K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+ exchange processes in tissues other than eye, for instance, brain synaptic plasma membrane (17Dahan D. Spanier R. Rahamimoff H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2067-2075Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and platelets (18Kimura M. Aviv A. Reeves J.P. J. Biol.

Those observations led to the search for other members of the K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+ exchanger gene family.Consequently, NCKX2 (SLC24A2) was cloned, first from rat brain (19Tsoi M. Rhee K.H.

Pfluegers Arch. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was employed to compare the distribution pattern of individual NCKX exchangers among different tissues (24Lytton J. Li X.-F. Dong H. Kraev A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 976: 382-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). NCKX1 expression is restricted to a 6-kb transcript present only in eye. The NCKX2 transcript of 11 kb is expressed at high levels only in brain. NCKX3 transcripts of 5 kb, and NCKX4 transcripts of 10 and 4.5 kb, are broadly expressed with particular abundance in various brain regions, aorta, lung, and intestine. The tissue-specific expression patterns of these known NCKX members may reflect the different Ca2+ handling properties of different tissues or cells. Expansion of the NCKX family suggests a wider role for K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+ exchange in maintaining cellular Ca2+ homeostasis than previously anticipated. The functional significance of K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+ exchange has been demonstrated recently (25Lee S.H. Kim M.H. Park K.H. Earm Y.E. Ho W.K. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6891-6899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in axon terminals of the rat neurohypophysis where more than 60% of Ca2+ efflux is mediated by Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity, of which in excess of 90% is due to NCKX.Analysis of NCKX mRNA expression using probes encoding the C-terminal hydrophobic portion conserved between NCKX paralogs has revealed evidence for further, as yet uncharacterized, mammalian members of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger family, i.e. a 3.5-kb band in stomach (26Poon S. Leach S. Li X.F. Tucker J.E. Schnetkamp P.P. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C651-C660Crossref Google Scholar). In this study, starting from a bioinformatics-based search of the GenBank™ data base, we have identified a novel member of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger gene superfamily, NCKX6, that has various unique properties distinguishing it from previously identified members. We demonstrate that expression of NCKX6 transcripts is ubiquitous in all tissues examined and that HEK-293 cells expressing NCKX6 indeed display K+-dependent Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAll molecular procedures were performed according to standard protocols (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2003Google Scholar, 28Sambrook J. Russell D.W.

Common chemical reagents were obtained from Fisher, Sigma, or BDH and were of analytical grade or better, unless indicated otherwise. Fluorescent dye terminator cycle sequencing was done at the University of Calgary Core DNA Service facility. Nucleic acid sequence, protein amino acid sequence, and phylogenetic analyses were done in MacVector (Accelrys Inc., Madison, WI). BLAST (29Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59166) Google Scholar) searches of the sequence data bases were run at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) web site (Bethesda) or at the Ensembl Genome Server of the European Bioinformatics Institute (Hinxton, UK).Identification and Cloning of the Mouse and Human NCKX6 cDNAs—The draft human genome sequence protein data base was searched with the conserved amino acids of the rat NCKX2 α-repeats (19Tsoi M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4155-4162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) using the BLASTP program (29Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59166) Google Scholar). 23 hits were found in seven proteins: six of them belonged to previously cloned NCX/NCKX members, whereas one hypothetic protein FLJ22233 (GenBank™ accession number NP_079235) was novel. Multiple sequence alignment demonstrated that the FLJ22233 protein aligned with the C-terminal half of known human NCX/NCKX proteins including the α-repeat domain (data not shown).The FLJ22233 protein sequence was then used to screen the NCBI data bases more extensively. This analysis resulted in the identification of a novel mouse cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AF261233) encoding a homologous protein. The deduced novel mouse protein, which had not been characterized functionally (30Perelygin A.A. Scherbik S.V. Zhulin I.B. Stockman B.M. Li Y. Brinton M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9322-9327Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), showed a pattern of hydrophobicity analogous to other known mammalian NCKX molecules. In addition, AF261233 had a stop codon upstream from the first possible translational start site (GGCCCATGG) which is similar to the Kozak consensus initiation sequence (31Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4151) Google Scholar). Two pairs of primers based on the AF261233 sequence were used to amplify the coding region in two parts by RT-PCR using Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase followed by Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Invitrogen and Roche Applied Science, respectively): 1) the 5′ end, A1 (CAT CCG GCT AGA GGA AGA CTC) to A4 (GAT GAC CAG CTG CAG ACA GTT G); 2) the 3′ end, A3 (GAG ACC ACT GTC CAG ATC CTG) to A2 (AGG ACC TTC TCA CCC TGC AGA). Total RNA samples isolated from mouse brain, kidney, heart, lung, and thymus were used. Amplification with A1 and A4 produced a single band of 1201 bp, and amplification using A3 and A2 resulted in two fragments of 1005 and 856 bp. Full-length coding fragments were generated by combining the A14 fragments with either the long or short A32 fragments, amplifying with A1 and A2 primers, and cloning into the EcoRV site of pBluescript II SK(-) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The resulting “long” and “short” clones were sequenced entirely. The longer clone, encoding the full-length NCKX6 protein, was identical to the novel mouse homolog previously identified in GenBank™ (accession number AF261233). While this manuscript was being prepared, the sequence data for the short clone was deposited in GenBank™ with accession number BC043689 by the Mammalian Gene Collection group at the National Institutes of Health.To compare the relative expression level between the full-length and the short transcripts of NCKX6 in various mouse tissues, a pair of primers was designed based on sequences flanking exons 13 and 14: E12F (CCT GGG GAA ACA GCA TTG GAG) and E15R (CAG TAA TCC GTC TGG CTC CAG). Amplification by RT-PCR using E12F and E15R was carried out for 15, 20, 25, or 30 cycles. To investigate if alternative splicing occurred in the central cytoplasmic loop, as observed in NCX1 and NCX3 (12Quednau B.D. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1250-C1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), NCKX1 (26Poon S. Leach S. Li X.F. Tucker J.E. Schnetkamp P.P. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C651-C660Crossref Google Scholar), NCKX2 (19Tsoi M. Rhee K.H. Bungard D. Li X.F. Lee S.L. Auer R.N. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4155-4162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and NCKX4 (22Li X.-F. Kraev A.S. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48410-48417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), a pair of primers was designed based on sequences encoding the transmembrane segments flanking the large cytoplasmic loop of NCKX6: E6F (TTC ACT GCA CTC TAT CTT GGC) and E11R (ACA GGA AGG AGA CCG CCA AT). The PCR products were then analyzed in 5% polyacrylamide gels, purified, and sequenced.The complete mouse NCKX6 coding sequence was used to perform a BLAST search of the human genome sequence, and a region sharing about 80% sequence similarity to the second exon in the mouse NCKX6-coding sequence was identified. BLAST searches of human EST data bases using 96 nucleotides from this region revealed six sequences (GenBank™ accession numbers BQ229748, BM560555, BI918586, BI753221, H46908, and H20230) with various lengths and 100% identity to the query nucleotides. Two sequence contigs, assembled from these six clones and the original partial human cDNA (AK025886), had distinct 5′ end sequences extending to 84 nucleotides upstream from the start codon but were otherwise identical. Human NCKX6 was amplified by PCR from Marathon-Ready human thymus cDNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using High Fidelity Taq polymerase (Roche Applied Science), and the following two primers designed based on the common human sequence: 1) starting from the start codon, H1 (ATG GCC GGC AGA AGG CTG AAT C), and 2) just downstream from the C terminus of the deduced coding region, H2 (AGT GAG GCC ACA GCA CT AAG). A single PCR product was obtained, subsequently cloned into pBluescript II SK (-), and sequenced. During preparation of this manuscript, a clone identical in sequence to the human NCKX6 cDNA we isolated, and corresponding to the full-length mouse NCKX6 clone, was deposited in GenBank™ with accession number AX537505.Northern Blot Analysis—Tissue distribution of the NCKX6 transcripts in rodent tissues was studied on Northern blots of total RNA samples using a digoxigenin-UTP-labeled antisense riboprobe from the full-length mouse NCKX6 cDNA sequence, according to instructions of the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (32Wu K.D. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C333-C341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of total RNA isolated by guanidine isothiocyanate extraction and CsCl centrifugation from various rat or mouse tissues was separated on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to nylon membranes by capillary diffusion overnight. The UV cross-linked membranes were then hybridized at high stringency using the labeled riboprobe.Antibody Preparation—Affinity-purified antibody to mouse NCKX6 was prepared at Affinity Bioreagents, Inc. (Golden, CO), by immunizing rabbits with a carrier-conjugated synthetic peptide corresponding to the sequence VDPDKDDRNWKRPLN (amino acids residues 345-359; located in the large cytoplasmic loop of the mouse NCKX6 protein), followed by purification using the immunogenic peptide coupled to a solid support.Expression in HEK-293 Cells—Expression constructs encoding the different NCKX6 proteins were obtained by digesting corresponding constructs in pBluescript II SK (-) with convenient unique restriction endonucleases and ligating into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) or -(-) (Invitrogen). In order to detect protein expression, a FLAG epitope (amino acids DYKDDDDK) was inserted at the predicted extracellular sequence between Arg-70 and Asn-71 of the mouse full-length and short NCKX6 proteins using two chimeric primers and two external primers that flanked convenient unique restriction enzyme digestion sites in a two-step process essentially as described previously (19Tsoi M.

Two days following transfection, postnuclear extracts were prepared by solubilizing transfected cells for 20 min in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.14 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)) followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 16,000 × g. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay using the reagent from Bio-Rad, with bovine γ-globulin as a standard. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (19Tsoi M. Rhee K.H.

In brief, 2 days after transfection, HEK-293 cells on poly-d-lysine-precoated coverslips were loaded with 5 μm fura-2 AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and mounted in a perfusion chamber on a microscope stage. The ratio of fura-2 fluorescence with excitation at 340 or 380 nm was followed with time and captured using an intensified CCD camera (ICCD200) and the Image Master System (Photon Technology International, Lawrenceville, NJ). Cells were initially perfused with Na+-containing K+-free solution (145 mm NaCl, 10 mm d-glucose, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES-trimethylamine, pH 7.4) for 2 min, followed by alternating changes to solutions in which the NaCl was replaced with either 140 mm LiCl and 5 mm KCl or 145 mm LiCl.Indirect Immunofluorescence—Subcellular location of the FLAG epitope was determined using immunofluorescence essentially as described previously (34Cai X. Zhang K. Lytton J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48923-48930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with some modifications. In brief, HEK-293 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged mouse full-length NCKX6 clone, FLAG-tagged mouse short NCKX6 clone, FLAG-tagged rat NCKX2 (as a positive control) (19Tsoi M. Rhee K.H. Bungard D.

Transfected HEK-293 cells were rinsed in PBSCM (phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBSCM, and blocked with 0.2% fish gelatin/PBSCM for 30 min. The cells were incubated with the monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (1:500) in PBSCM containing 0.2% fish gelatin for 1 h at room temperature, rinsed three times for 5 min each in PBSCM, and then stained by an FITC-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:500) in 0.2% fish gelatin/PBSCM for 30 min. Double labeling experiments were performed as follows. HEK-293 cells were first fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBSCM for 5 min. After staining for the FLAG epitope, cells were stained with the rabbit anti-SERCA antibody N1 (1:400) to visualize the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), followed by a rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody.Mitochondria were stained using MitoTracker Red essentially according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) with some modifications. Briefly, transfected HEK-293 cells on glass coverslips were washed three times with 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 10 ml of pre-warmed (37 °C) growth medium containing 100 nm MitoTracker Red. Cells were washed again with 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and treated for 15 min at 37 °C with 10 ml of pre-warmed growth medium containing freshly prepared 3.7% formaldehyde. After rinsing twice with 10 ml of PBSCM, the cells were permeabilized and stained for the FLAG epitope as described above.Golgi were identified using pEGFP-g67 (C113) (generous gift from Dr. D. J. Fujita, University of Calgary), which is an expression construct that encodes a fusion protein between EGFP and the C-terminal 113 amino acids of a recently identified Golgi protein Golgin-67 (35Jakymiw A.

This construct was co-transfected into HEK-293 cells with the FLAG-tagged mouse full-length NCKX6 clone. The EGFP fusion protein was visualized using the FITC channel of the immunofluorescence microscope. The cells were then permeabilized and incubated with monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody followed by rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse antibody as described above.In all cases, coverslips were mounted in an anti-fade solution containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed using standard epifluorescent optics on a Zeiss Axioscop II through a Fluar 63× objective. Images were captured using a Spot digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI) and processed with Adobe Photoshop 6.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA).Detection of Endogenous NCKX6 Protein in Rat Ventricular Myocytes—A sarcolemmal membrane fraction was prepared from adult rat ventricles following a modified protocol as described previously (36Slaughter R. Sutko J. Reeves J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3183-3190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All steps were performed at 4 °C. In brief, the ventricles were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, minced by scissors, and homogenized in mannitol buffer (250 mm mannitol, 70 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 units/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 mm PMSF) in a volume equal to three times the weight of starting material, with three 5-s bursts using a Polytron homogenizer T-3000 (Brinkmann Instruments) at a dial setting of 13 K. The homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g (max) for 20 min, and the pellet was re-homogenized with the Polytron three times for 30 s, each burst separated by an interval of 30 s. After centrifugation again as described above, the supernatant was kept and the pellet was resuspended, homogenized, and centrifuged once again as described above. The collected supernatants were combined and centrifuged at 48,000 × g (max) for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in ∼0.55 ml of mannitol buffer per 1 g of original weighed ventricle, layered over 0.64 m sucrose solution containing 20 mm imidazole HCl, pH 7.4, 100 units/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 mm PMSF, and centrifuged for 90 min at 161,000 × g (max). The turbid fraction at the interface between the sucrose and mannitol layers was collected, diluted with 3 volumes of mannitol buffer, and sedimented at 161,000 × g (max) for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended at 200 μl per ventricle in 160 mm NaCl, 20 mm MOPS/Tris, pH 7.4, 100 units/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 mm PMSF.

https://openalex.org/W2111113741,"Elastin is a key protein in soft tissue function and pathology. Establishing a structural basis for understanding its reversible elasticity has proven to be difficult. Complementary to structure is the important aspect of flexibility and disorder in elastin. We have used solid-state NMR methods to examine polypeptide and hydrate ordering in both elastic (hydrated) and brittle (dry) elastin fibers and conclude (i) that tightly bound waters are absent in both dry and hydrated elastin and (ii) that the backbone in the hydrated protein is highly disordered with large amplitude motions. The hydrate was studied by 2H and 17O NMR, and the polypeptide by 13C and 2H NMR. Using a two-dimensional 13C MAS method, an upper limit of S < 0.1 was determined for the backbone carbonyl group order parameter in hydrated elastin. For comparison, S ∼∼ 0.9 in most proteins. The former result is substantiated by two additional observations: the absence of the characteristic 2H spectrum for stationary amides and “solution-like” 13C magic angle spinning spectra at 75 °C, at which the material retains elasticity. Comparison of the observed shifts with accepted values for α-helices, β-sheets, or random coils indicates a random coil structure at all carbons. These conclusions are discussed in the context of known thermodynamic properties of elastin and, more generally, protein folding. Because coacervation is an entropy-driven process, it is enhanced by the observed backbone disorder, which, we suggest, is the result of high proline content.

This view is supported by recent studies of recombinant elastin polypeptides with systematic proline substitutions. Elastin, nature's elastomer, is a primary component in determining the mechanical properties of soft tissues. For example, deletion of the elastin gene is responsible for severe pathologies associated with Williams syndrome, and point mutations of the elastin gene are associated with obstructive vascular disease (1Brooke B.S. Bayes-Genis A. Li D.Y. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2003; 13: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 2Li D.Y. Toland A.E. Boak B.B. Atkinson D.L. Ensing G.J. Morris C.A. Keating M.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Recently, a variety of uses for elastin-like polypeptides containing a major elastin repeat (VPGVG) have been described. They include fusion proteins for rapid protein purification (3Meyer D.E. Chilkoti A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1112-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar), artificial vascular tissues (4Welsh E.R. Tirrell D.A. Biomacromolecules. 2000; 1: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), biomolecular machines (5Urry D.W. Sci. Am. 1995; 272: 64-69Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and thermally targeted drugs (6Meyer D.E. Shin B.C. Kong G.A. Dewhirst M.W. Chilkoti A. J. Controlled Release. 2001; 74: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In these examples, a key property is an inverse transition that, like the coacervation of tropoelastin, occurs between 20 and 30 °C. A molecular basis for understanding elastin has been elusive, and difficulties arise from its inherent properties. It is, to some degree, disordered, active only when swollen in water, insoluble, opaque and lacks long-range order. Thus, studies using solution NMR and optical spectroscopy are difficult and typically applied to either model compounds or non-native material. For example, circular dichroism of soluble (VPGVG)n and solid-state NMR of ((VPGVG)4(VPGKG))39 indicate the presence of β-turns (7Urry D.W. Trapane T.L. Prasad K.U. Biopolymers. 1985; 24: 2345-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 8Hong M. Isailovic D. McMillan R.A. Conticello V.P. Biopolymers. 2003; 70: 158-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A model for elastin based on β-turns, a β-spiral, has been proposed (9Urry D.W. J. Protein Chem. 1988; 7: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), and supporting evidence was reviewed recently (10Urry D.W. Hugel T. Seitz M. Gaub H.E. Sheiba L. Dea J. Xu J. Parker T. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 2002; 357: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Structures containing β-sheets have also been proposed. 13C NMR chemical shifts of lyophilized α-elastin (oxalic acid-extracted material), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of KBr pellets, and circular dichroism of KOH-solubilized elastin all indicate that sheets are a major structural element present in such material (11Kumashiro K.K.

Finally, solid-state NMR studies of poly(LGGVG) indicate conformational heterogeneity (13Kumashiro K.K. Kurano T.L. Niemczura W.P. Martino M. Tamburro A.M. Biopolymers. 2003; 70: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Elastin's essential functional property, the ability to contract reversibly after stretching, is driven, at least in part, by an increase in entropy (10Urry D.W. Hugel T. Seitz M. Gaub H.E. Sheiba L.

It is thus an example of a protein for which the interplay between structure and dynamics is crucial to function (16Wand A.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 926-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 17Lee A.L. Wand A.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Long ago, Hoeve and Flory (14Hoeve C.A.J. Flory P.J. Biopolymers. 1974; 13: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) proposed that elastin is analogous to natural rubbers, i.e. polypeptide chains are completely disordered with a gaussian distribution of end-to-end distances. Backbone motions were confirmed by dielectric (18Urry D.W. Peng S.Q. Xu J. McPherson D.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 1161-1162Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and NMR (19Torchia D.A. Piez K.A.

Sullivan C.E. Torchia D.A. Biophys. J. 1978; 21: A39Google Scholar) relaxation studies that focused on the time scale of the dynamics. In addition, from the absence of intrinsic birefringence, it was concluded that elastin is isotropic and devoid of structure at the molecular level (22Aaron B.B. Gosline J.M. Nature. 1980; 287: 865-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 23Aaron B.B. Gosline J.M. Biopolymers. 1981; 20: 1247-1260Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A qualitatively different mechanism based on librational entropy of a β-spiral structure was proposed by Urry (24Urry D.W. J. Protein Chem. 1988; 7: 81-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Support for this picture includes the observation of a slow, thermally induced decrease in thermoelasticity that was attributed to unfolding of the β-spiral (24Urry D.W. J. Protein Chem. 1988; 7: 81-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This model is not, however, supported by recent molecular dynamics (MD) 1The abbreviations used are: MD, molecular dynamics; MAS, magic angle spinning; T, tesla(s). simulations of hydrated (VPGVG)18 (25Li B. Alonso D.O.V. Daggett V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 26Li B. Daggett V. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2002; 23: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 27Li B. Daggett V. Biopolymers. 2003; 68: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Starting with a β-spiral structure, a high degree of disorder inconsistent with a well defined 2° structure develops on a time scale of ∼10 ns. The experimentally observed inverse transition is predicted and shown to be a hydrophobic collapse to a dynamic globular structure containing distorted β-turns and β-sheets. Testable predictions of these calculations include a backbone order parameter with a value of S ∼ 0.51 (25Li B. Alonso D.O.V. Daggett V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), which is small, for example, compared with S = 0.9 determined by solid-state NMR for the well ordered backbone amides in crystalline lysozyme (28Mack J.W. Usha M.G. Long J. Griffin R.G. Wittebort R.J. Biopolymers. 2000; 53: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A key aspect of this study is the determination of polypeptide and hydrate order parameters in both elastic (hydrated) and brittle (dry) elastin based on measurements of residual anisotropic couplings by solid-state 13C, 2H, and 17O NMR. From 17O and 2H NMR, we conclude that tightly bound waters are absent and that the elastin hydrate reorients isotropically. Similarly, the absence of any solid-like 2H signal, which is readily observed for stationary amides in dry elastin, suggests the possibility of large amplitude motions in the backbone of the hydrated protein. This disorder was directly observed using a two-dimensional 13C magic angle spinning (MAS) method that separates anisotropic and isotropic chemical shielding. In contrast to dry material, near-zero anisotropic chemical shielding at all carbon sites was observed for hydrated material, substantiating that the protein is highly disordered on a time scale of 50 μs. 13C spectra of stretched fibers show an increase in chain ordering and/or a slowing of molecular dynamics. Finally, we found that well resolved “solution-like” 13C MAS spectra were obtained at high field (18.8 T) and 75 °C. At this temperature, the material retains its characteristic elasticity, and comparison of the observed shifts with reference values for α-helices, β-sheets, or random coils (29Zhang H.Y. Neal S. Wishart D.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2003; 25: 173-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) indicates a random coil structure. Elastin fibers from bovine neck ligament, prepared by the neutral extraction method (30Partridge S.M. Davis H.F. Adair G.S. Biochem. J. 1955; 61: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), were purchased from Elastin Products Co., Inc. (Owensville, MO). 2H2O and H217O were obtained from ISOTEC (Miamisburg, OH). Stationary 13C, 2H, and 17O spectra were recorded on a lab-built 11.7-T (500 MHz for 1H) spectrometer with double-resonance probes. The 13C 2D-PASS experiment (31Antzutkin O.N. Shekar S.C. Levitt M.H. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. A. 1995; 115: 7-19Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar) was implemented with 16 increments in t1 on the same instrument using a lab-built 4-mm MAS probe. To obtain more easily interpretable two-dimensional contour plots, data tables were sheared and interpolated in f1 (31Antzutkin O.N. Shekar S.C. Levitt M.H. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. A. 1995; 115: 7-19Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Variable temperature 13C MAS spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova 800 instrument with a 3.2-mm triple-resonance MAS probe. Dehydration of the sample while in the MAS rotor was eliminated by the use of tightly fitting caps. Cross-polarization spectra of dry fibers were obtained with contact times from 1.2 to 1.6 ms and matched Hartman-Hahn field strengths of 50–80 kHz. Direct polarization spectra of hydrated fibers were obtained with 13C pulse widths of 5 μs (11.7 T) or 3.5 μs (18.8 T). The 1H decoupling field strengths were 100 kHz (11.7 T) or 60 kHz (18.8 T). 13C MAS spectra were externally referenced to DSS (32Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar) and processed using the manufacturer's software (Varian). A resolution enhancement protocol was used that decreased line widths by ∼25% and that introduced little phase distortion (gaussian broadening with gf = 0.012 s, sine bell with sb = 0.012 s, and the sine bell offset with sbs = 0.0056 s). Transverse relaxation rates (1/T2) were determined with a Hahn spin echo (33Hahn E.L. Phys. Rev. 1950; 80: 580-594Crossref Scopus (4011) Google Scholar) and compared with line widths from spectra processed without digital filtering. The upper limit for the backbone order parameters was determined by simulating the side band intensities for the 13C MAS spectrum at the spinning frequency (3.6 kHz) with the approximation that the residual shielding tensor is axially symmetric, a reasonable assumption because the residual anisotropy is quite small. The residual anisotropy (tensor span), Δσ, was systematically decreased to the point at which the ratio of the center band to the larger of the ±1 side bands equaled the signal-to-noise ratio (57:1) observed in the experimental spectrum for the carbonyl carbons. Finally, using the anisotropy of Δσ = (σ11 - σ33) ppm observed in dry elastin, which is in good accord with known static anisotropies for peptide carbonyls (34Duncan T.M. Principal Components of Chemical Shift Tensors. 2nd Ed. Farragut Press, Madison, WI1997: 40-42Google Scholar), the order parameter is calculated as S=Δσ/Δσ (35Seelig J. Seelig A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1980; 13: 19-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). 2H, 17O, and 13C Solid-state NMR and Dynamics—In the NMR experiments used here, the effect of dynamics on the observed spectrum depends on the rate or reciprocal correlation time (1/τc) in comparison with the anisotropy of the spin coupling (νaniso). Approximately speaking, νaniso is the breadth of the NMR spectrum observed in a randomly oriented sample in the static or slow exchange limit, 1/τc << νaniso (36Wittebort R.J. Olejniczak E.T. Griffin R.G. J. Chem. Phys. 1987; 86: 5411-5420Crossref Scopus (324) Google Scholar). For the 2H and 17O experiments, νaniso ∼ 200 and 50 kHz and arises from first- and second-order quadrupole interactions, respectively. For 13C at a magnetic field of 11.7 T, the relevant interaction is chemical shielding with νaniso ∼ 20 kHz for C′ or νaniso ∼ 5 kHz for aliphatics such as Cα. Importantly, when the dynamical rate is fast compared with the anisotropy (1/τc >> νaniso), analysis of the solid-state NMR spectrum depends only on the distribution of orientations, i.e. the motional amplitudes. Consequently, fast motions average the anisotropic coupling to some residual or averaged value (νaniso) determined by the distribution of orientations sampled. In the special case where both the static coupling and dynamical process have axial symmetry, the usual order parameter is readily calculated as S=νaniso/νaniso (35Seelig J. Seelig A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1980; 13: 19-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). For example, when fast motions are isotropic (S = 0), narrow spectroscopic lines are observed (νaniso=0). In a randomly oriented solid, spectral patterns rather than narrow lines are typically observed as a consequence of spatially anisotropic spin interactions. Because νaniso varies from 5 to 200 kHz in the NMR experiments used here, we have some flexibility to choose an experiment to avoid the more complicated intermediate exchange regime (1/τc ∼ νaniso), in which spectra depend on both motional rates and amplitudes. Bound Waters Are Absent, and Amides Are Dynamic—2H and 17O NMR are complementary for examining ordering of both hydrate and amide groups (37Pometun M.S. Gundusharma U.M. Richardson J.F. Wittebort R.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 2345-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). When the solid protein is exhaustively exchanged with isotopically enriched water, 2H2O labels both hydrate and exchangeable hydrogens (primarily amides), whereas H217O labels exclusively the hydrate. In Fig. 1, 2H NMR spectra of 2H-labeled elastin fibers equilibrated to several hydration levels are shown. The spectrum from fully hydrated and elastic material (×25 vertical expansion) is dominated by a sharp signal indicative of isotropically reorienting deuterons and shows no evidence of a solid-like 2H signal (Fig. 1A). In contrast, after extensive drying over P2O5, a prominent solid-like pattern with well defined quadrupole coupling (χzz = 200 kHz) and asymmetry (η = 0.13) was obtained from inelastic fibers (Fig. 1D). Although the solid-like 2H signal is potentially from bound hydrate and amide deuterons, the asymmetry is more nearly that of H-bonded amides (η ∼ 0.14) (38Usha M.G. Peticolas W.L. Wittebort R.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3955-3962Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) than H-bonded water (η ∼ 0.10) (39Wittebort R.J. Usha M.G. Ruben D.J. Wemmer D.E. Pines A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 5668-5671Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and assignment to amides was confirmed by 17O NMR and thermal gravimetry. Whereas 17O cross-polarization spectra of peptide hydrates show characteristic 17O spectra (χzz ∼ 6 MHz and η ∼ 1) (37Pometun M.S. Gundusharma U.M. Richardson J.F. Wittebort R.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 2345-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), no solid-like or isotropic 17O signal was observed in fibers swollen in H217O and subsequently dried over P2O5 (data not shown). Moreover, weight loss determined by thermal gravimetry analysis was negligible (<1.5%) from 30 to 80 °C and not measurable from 80 to 130 °C. Together, these experiments demonstrate that elastin lacks strongly bound hydrate when fully hydrated or dried over P2O5 and that the characteristic “solid” 2H signal from stationary amides, readily observed in dry elastin, is absent in fully elastic material. By establishing more precise control over the level of hydration, we show a direct correlation between the loss of the 2H amide signal and the onset of elasticity. The thermodynamic activity of water is varied either by equilibrating fibers against an atmosphere of known relative humidity (40Preis I.R. Skhirtladze G.I. Zh. Fiz. Khimii. 1976; 50: 736-737Google Scholar) or by swelling fibers in a mixed solvent. Elasticity is judged qualitatively by the extensibility compared with fibers in excess water. When equilibrated to a relative humidity of 85%, marginally elastic material was obtained wherein fibers could be stretched to ∼120% of their relaxed length and did not readily retract (Fig. 1C). The spectrum shows an ∼10-fold reduction in intensity compared with the solid-like spectrum of dry material (Fig. 1D). Increasing the relative humidity to 100% gave elasticity approaching the fully hydrated state (reversibly extensible to ∼150% of the relaxed length) and largely eliminated the solid-like 2H spectrum (Fig. 1C). Better control of the thermodynamic activity of water is obtained with a mixed solvent system, and we found that elastin fibers were fully extensible in water/acetone solutions containing a small percentage of water (>8%). In these experiments, fibers were exhaustively exchanged against either H2O or 2H2O, dried under vacuum, and then equilibrated in acetone/2H2O (overnight) for 2H spectroscopy. In Fig. 2, the intensity of the solid-like 2H signal is correlated with the percent 2H2O in the mixed solvent. Fibers initially exchanged against 2H2O and equilibrated in solvent with less than ∼5% 2H2O were not elastic and yielded substantial solid 2H signals, whereas the spectra of fully elastic fibers (greater than ∼8% 2H2O) are comparable with those of fibers at 100% relative humidity or in excess water and have no solid signal. Moreover, the signal decreased monotonically with increasing percent 2H2O. A different pattern was observed for elastin initially exchanged in unlabeled H2O. Here, the solid 2H signal initially increased and subsequently decreased, indicating that amide sites in dry fibers are not readily accessible, but that, with the onset of elasticity, amide exchange labeling occurs. Thus, with the onset of elasticity, amide groups are not protected by strong N–H···O=C hydrogen bonding; and in fully elastic material (in excess water at 100% relative humidity and in the mixed solvent with >8% water), the absence of the solid 2H signal indicates that the backbone is dynamic. If the reorientational rate is comparable with the quadrupole coupling (1/τc ∼ 200 kHz), then the 2H signal would be difficult to observe (36Wittebort R.J. Olejniczak E.T. Griffin R.G. J. Chem. Phys. 1987; 86: 5411-5420Crossref Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 37Pometun M.S. Gundusharma U.M. Richardson J.F. Wittebort R.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 2345-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and no quantitative conclusion can be drawn about the amplitude of the motion. Alternatively, if the motion is fast, then the 2H amide signal overlaps with the sharp solvent signal, indicating that backbone reorientation is essentially isotropic. This ambiguity is resolved by 13C experiments described below. 13C Shielding Anisotropy in Hydrated Elastin Is Negligible, Indicating Large Amplitude Motions—A high degree of conformational flexibility in the polypeptide backbone is quantitatively assessed based on the degree of motional averaging of 13C shielding anisotropies. In this experiment, the spectrum arises only from non-labile sites on the protein, and a two-dimensional approach, 2D-PASS (31Antzutkin O.N. Shekar S.C. Levitt M.H. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. A. 1995; 115: 7-19Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar), that places isotropic shifts and shielding anisotropy on orthogonal axes was used. In Fig. 3, different carbon types are separated along the horizontal axis by their characteristic isotropic chemical shifts, whereas the number and intensities of spinning side bands along the vertical axis are directly related to the shielding anisotropy. Because the side bands are spaced at the spinning frequency, a slow spinning speed of 3.6 kHz was used, which is sufficient to observe shielding anisotropies of 10 ppm or larger. The spectrum from dry elastin was obtained with cross-polarization, whereas direct polarization is required to obtain adequate signal from fully swollen material (41Perry A. Stypa M.P. Tenn B.K. Kumashiro K.K. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1086-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Dry fibers exhibited relatively broad lines and isotropic shifts for the major carbon types: carbonyls (∼170 ppm), aromatic side chains (131 ppm), and aliphatic carbons (10–70 ppm). In dry material, a shielding span (σ11 - σ33) of 150 ppm was deduced from the C′ side band pattern using standard analysis (31Antzutkin O.N. Shekar S.C. Levitt M.H. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. A. 1995; 115: 7-19Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This is the expected value for a typical stationary peptide carbonyl (34Duncan T.M. Principal Components of Chemical Shift Tensors. 2nd Ed. Farragut Press, Madison, WI1997: 40-42Google Scholar), and a similar anisotropy is seen for the aromatic carbons. Also, the expected and smaller static anisotropies (30–50 ppm) are indicated for aliphatic carbons that show fewer side bands. A striking result is seen in the spectra of hydrated material at 20 °C (Fig. 3) and 37 °C (data not shown). At both temperatures, there was a complete absence of spinning side bands, indicating very small residual anisotropies at all carbons and thus confirming the presence of large amplitude motions in the protein backbone. Based on the signal-to-noise ratio (57:1) of the C′ center band and the absence of observable side bands, we estimate an upper limit to the C′ residual shielding in hydrated elastin at 37 °C of 14 ppm, corresponding to a backbone carbonyl order parameter of S < 0.1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). We note that a model elastin polypeptide, ((VPGVG)4(VPGKG))39, shows static shielding anisotropies. However, as hydration was increased, cross-polarization NMR signals were reported to decrease due to molecular motions (8Hong M. Isailovic D. McMillan R.A. Conticello V.P. Biopolymers. 2003; 70: 158-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Insofar as direct polarization rather than cross-polarization is required to obtain good spectra of fully hydrated elastin, comparison of the two systems would require spectra of fully swollen (cross-linked) proteins in both cases. 13C Shifts Are Comparable with Random Coil Values—With increasing temperature, resolution of the 13C MAS spectrum of hydrated elastin increased substantially, and a well resolved spectrum was reproducibly obtained in an 18.8-T instrument at 75 °C (Fig. 4). Although many proteins are denatured at this temperature, samples studied at 75 °C showed reversible elasticity before and after the NMR experiments, which was expected based on previous observations. Thermoelastic studies show that the force generated by elastin fibers increases somewhat between 60 and 75 °C (9Urry D.W. J. Protein Chem. 1988; 7: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), and the irreversible decrease in the thermoelasticity of elastin at 80 °C occurs with a half-life of 10 days (24Urry D.W. J. Protein Chem. 1988; 7: 81-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The spectrum in Fig. 4A was accumulated in a comparatively short time (22 h), and a spectrum accumulated in even less time (10 min) had a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio to confirm the observed spectral features (Fig. 4B). At 37 °C, many of the spectral features seen at 75 °C were still evident, but resolution had decreased due to increased line widths (Fig. 4C). The origin of increased line widths (Δν) at lower temperature is due either to an increased range of isotropic shifts corresponding to different conformations or to efficient transverse relaxation. The contribution of the latter (1/πT2) to the observed line widths can be measured directly with a Hahn spin echo experiment at 75 °C (33Hahn E.L. Phys. Rev. 1950; 80: 580-594Crossref Scopus (4011) Google Scholar). The result for a representative peak (the resolved line at 45.4 ppm assigned to Gly Cα) is shown in Fig. 4 (inset). At 75 °C, the transverse relaxation contribution to the line width (1/πT2 = 155 ± 30 Hz) accounts for the observed line width (Δν ≈ 140 Hz), indicating that chemical shift dispersion within a given line is comparatively small. Note that the transverse relaxation rate (1/T2 ∼ 500 s-1) is fast compared with the longitudinal rate (1/T1 > 1 s-1) and thus indicates the presence of slow motions in elastin (1/τc < 109 s-1). The excellent resolution of the MAS spectra (0.7 ppm line widths) provides chemical shifts, which are reliable probes for distinguishing among α-helix, β-sheet, and random coil structures (29Zhang H.Y. Neal S. Wishart D.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2003; 25: 173-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The spectral assignments in Fig. 4 are based on the chemical shift index (29Zhang H.Y. Neal S. Wishart D.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2003; 25: 173-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and the known composition of bovine elastin (NCBI accession number NP_786966). For example, the intensities of all resolved Cα signals are in excellent agreement with their respective abundance, except for alanine. The low alanine intensity is expected because most occur in cross-linking regions that have previously been shown to be more motionally restricted than hydrophobic domains (19Torchia D.A. Piez K.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 76: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In proteins, Cα helix values are ∼4 ppm downfield of sheet values, whereas Cβ helix values are upfield by ∼3 ppm, and random coil shifts are intermediate as a consequence of averaging over accessible conformations. As shown in Table I, the five most abundant amino acids in elastin (∼84% of the total sequence) all have Cα isotropic chemical shifts within 0.5 ppm of random coil values, with an average deviation of 0.1 ppm. In contrast, data base values for helices and sheets are, on average, 2.5 ppm downfield and 0.8 ppm upfield, respectively, of the observed values. Similarly, for Cβ, the average deviation from"

Therapeutic agents against Her-2/neu have been intensively sought over the past decade. Here we show that small interfering RNA (siRNA) can silence the expression of Her-2/neu in models of human breast or ovarian cancer through retrovirus-mediated transfer of an siRNA against Her-2/neu. Cells infected with retrovirus expressing anti-Her-2/neu siRNA exhibit slower proliferation, increased apoptosis, increased G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> arrest, and decreased tumor growth. Changes in cell cycle-associated factors included decreased levels of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, pAkt, and cyclin D1 and increased levels of p27 and phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein. Knockdown of Her-2/neu expression by siRNA is also associated with increased expression of the anti-angiogenic factor thrombospondin-1 and decreased expression of the pro-angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor, suggesting that Her-2/neu stimulates tumor growth at least in part by regulating angiogenesis. siRNA-mediated gene silencing of Her-2/neu and increasing the expression of thrombospondin-1 may be a useful therapeutic strategy for Her-2/neu-over-expressing breast or ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2021592976,"Co-contamination with complex mixtures of carcinogenic metals, such as chromium, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is a common environmental problem with multiple biological consequences. Chromium exposure alters inducible gene expression, forms chromium-DNA adducts and chromium-DNA cross-links, and disrupts transcriptional activator-co-activator complexes. We have shown previously that exposure of mouse hepatoma Hepa-1 cells to chromate inhibits the induction of the Cyp1a1 and Nqo1 genes by dioxin. Here we have tested the hypothesis that chromium blocks gene expression by interfering with the assembly of productive transcriptional complexes at the promoter of inducible genes. To this end, we have studied the effects of chromium on the expression of genes induced by benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), another aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist, and characterized the disruption of Cyp1a1 transcriptional induction by chromium. Gene expression profiling by using high density microarray analysis revealed that the inhibitory effect of chromium on B[a]P-dependent gene induction was generalized, affecting the induction of over 50 different genes involved in a variety of signaling transduction pathways. The inhibitory effect of chromium on Cyp1a1 transcription was found to depend on the presence of promoter-proximal sequences and not on the cis-acting enhancer sequences that bind the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator complex. By using transient reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses, we found that chromium prevented the B[a]P-dependent release of HDAC-1 from Cyp1a1 chromatin and blocked p300 recruitment. These results provide a mechanistic explanation for the observation that chromium inhibits inducible but not constitutive gene expression.

Environmental exposures to toxic or carcinogenic compounds rarely result from the presence of single, isolated toxicants. More often, the toxic agent is a complex mixture of chemical entities in numbers ranging from a few, such as may occur in occupational exposures, to several hundred, such as in cigarette smoke. Often, these mixtures include a combination of carcinogenic metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, as for example those co-released from sources such as fossil fuel combustion or municipal waste incineration. Of these, chromium and B[a]P 1The abbreviations used are: B[a]Pbenzo[a]pyreneAHRaryl hydrocarbon receptorAHaryl hydrocarbonPBSphosphate-buffered salinePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidARNTAh receptor nuclear translocatorCBPCREB-binding proteinCREBcAMP-response element-binding proteinChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationHAThistone acetyltransferaseHDAChistone deacetylaseHDACICP-MS, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometrySRCsteroid receptor co-activatorTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineCy3cytidine-3Cy5cytidine-5HSV-1herpes simplex virus, type 1TCDD2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. are among the top 20 hazardous substances in the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry/Environmental Protection Agency priority list (1Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Report (2002) CERCLA Priority List of Hazardous Substances, http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/clist.htmlGoogle Scholar) and are found as co-contaminants in more than 25% of the National Priority List of Superfund sites (2United States Environmental Protection Agency (2003) National Priorities List, http://oaspub.epa.gov/oerrpage/basicqryGoogle Scholar). benzo[a]pyrene aryl hydrocarbon receptor aryl hydrocarbon phosphate-buffered saline 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid Ah receptor nuclear translocator CREB-binding protein cAMP-response element-binding protein chromatin immunoprecipitation histone acetyltransferase histone deacetylase ICP-MS, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry steroid receptor co-activator N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine cytidine-3 cytidine-5 herpes simplex virus, type 1 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. Chromium has been known for over 100 years to be a human carcinogen (3Klein C.B. Chang L.W. Toxicology of Metals. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1996: 205-219Google Scholar). Epidemiologically, the greatest risk of cancer from chromium exposure is associated with Cr(VI). Cr(VI) enters cells via the sulfate anion transporter system and is reduced to intermediate oxidation states, such as Cr(V) and Cr(IV), in the process of forming stable Cr(III) forms (4Wetterhahn K.E. Hamilton J.W. Aiyar J. Borges K.M. Floyd R. Biol. Trace Elem. Res. 1989; 21: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 5Bagchi D. Stohs S.J. Downs B.W. Bagchi M. Preuss H.G. Toxicology. 2002; 180: 5-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Cr(III) is the most prevalent form of chromium in the environment and in biological tissues, but the vast majority of the evidence indicates that exposure to trivalent chromium does not induce tumors in animals (6International Agency for Research on Cancer Evaluation of the Carcinogenic Risk to Humans,49. IARC Press, Vol. , pp. , Lyon, France1990: 120-139Google Scholar). The available experimental evidence indicates that chromium exposure has little or no effect on constitutive gene expression but alters inducible gene expression, possibly due to the formation of chromium-DNA adducts, chromium-DNA cross-links, or to the disruption of transcriptional activator-coactivator complexes (3Klein C.B. Chang L.W. Toxicology of Metals. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1996: 205-219Google Scholar, 7Alcedo J.A. Misra M. Hamilton J.W. Wetterhahn K.E.

Broderick R.J. Wang Y. Barchowsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36207-36212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For example, chromium was found to block the expression of metal-inducible metallothionein or hormone-inducible phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase without affecting the expression of housekeeping genes, such as β-actin or albumin (4Wetterhahn K.E. Hamilton J.W. Aiyar J. Borges K.M. Floyd R. Biol. Trace Elem. Res. 1989; 21: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 7Alcedo J.A. Misra M. Hamilton J.W. Wetterhahn K.E.

Wolf C.M. Hamilton J.W. Mol. Carcinog. 1994; 10: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These observations have led to the hypothesis that the chromatin structure of inducible promoters, perhaps by virtue of being more open, may offer a better target for chromium binding than the more closed chromatin of constitutive promoters (12Manning F.C. Xu J. Patierno S.R. Mol. Carcinog. 1992; 6: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Chromium-induced DNA-protein cross-links are found preferentially in nuclear matrix DNA (13Xu J. Manning F.C. Patierno S.R. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 1443-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), where many replication, repair, and transcription proteins associate, suggesting that cross-links between DNA and any or several of these proteins may be responsible for effectively blocking their function. Generation of free radicals from the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(V) and Cr(IV) induces an increase of NFκB DNA binding activity but do not cause a concomitant increase in NFκB-dependent gene expression (14Chen F. Ye J. Zhang X. Rojanasakul Y. Shi X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 338: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Kaltreider R.C. Pesce C.A. Ihnat M.A. Lariviere J.P. Hamilton J.W. Mol. Carcinog. 1999; 25: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 16Ye J. Zhang X. Young H.A. Mao Y. Shi X. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 2401-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), possibly because chromium blocks the binding of the p65 subunit to CBP/p300, whose association with p65 is essential for NFκB-enhanced transcriptional activity (9Shumilla J.A. Broderick R.J. Wang Y. Barchowsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36207-36212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the intermediate oxidation states of chromium may be critical for its effect on gene expression. The molecular mechanism responsible for this effect is likely to involve the reduction process in the persistent stimulation of regulatory pathways affecting interactions of transcription factors with transcriptional co-regulators and chromatin remodeling factors, more so than the binding of the factors themselves to their cognate recognition sites. Earlier studies from this laboratory have shown that exposure of mouse hepatoma Hepa-1 cells to chromate inhibits the induction of the Cyp1a1 and Nqo1 genes by dioxin, an AHR ligand (17Maier A. Dalton T.P. Puga A. Mol. Carcinog. 2000; 28: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The AHR is a ligand-activated basic region helix-loop-helix/Per-AHR-ARNT-Sim transcription factor that forms heterodimers with ARNT and binds to cis-acting AHR-response enhancer elements in the regulatory domains of target genes, such as Cyp1a1 and Nqo1, leading to changes in chromatin structure and activation of gene transcription (18Whitlock Jr., J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 103-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). These changes also include the recruitment to the transcription machinery of associated co-regulator proteins. In recent years several transcriptional co-regulators, including the co-activators CBP/p300, SRC-1, RIP140, ERAP140, the chromatin remodeling factor BRG-1, and the co-repressor SMRT, have been shown to interact with AHR·ARNT complexes and play a role in transactivation (19Kobayashi A.

We have studied the effects of chromium on the expression of genes induced by B[a]P, another AHR agonist. We have tested the hypothesis that blocking of AHR-dependent gene expression by chromium was not limited to Cyp1a1 or Nqo1 but that it affected globally a large number of genes induced by B[a]P. We have further tested the hypothesis that chromium blocked gene expression by interfering with the assembly of productive transcriptional complexes in the promoters of inducible genes. We find that chromium prevents the B[a]P-dependent release of HDAC-1 from chromatin, preventing the association of p300 with the Cyp1a1 transcriptional complex and hence blocking gene transcription. Cell Culture and Chemical Treatments—Mouse hepatoma Hepa-1 (27Bernard H.P. Darlington G.J. Ruddle F.H. Dev. Biol. 1973; 35: 83-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) cells were grown in α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were treated when grown at 80–90% confluence. Hepa-AhRDTKLUC cells have been described previously (28Chang C.Y. Puga A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar); they were derived by stable integration into Hepa-1 cells of a pAhRDT-KLuc3 luciferase reporter plasmid containing the AHR-responsive domain of the mouse Cyp1a1 gene promoter (from –1100 to –869), harboring five AHR-responsive elements, fused to the HSV-1 thymidine kinase minimal promoter from –79 to +53 (29McKnight S.L. Gavis E.R. Kingsbury R. Axel R. Cell. 1981; 25: 385-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) from which the Sp1-binding site had been removed (Fig. 1). Potassium chromate and dichromate (K2CrO4 and K2Cr2O7, referred to here simply as chromium) were freshly dissolved in sterile deionized water prior to use. Sodium butyrate was dissolved in serum-free α-minimal essential medium just prior to use. B[a]P was added to the cells in a final Me2SO volume of 0.1%. Detailed treatment procedures are given in the text and the figure legends. Plasmid Constructs and Transfections—To assess AHR-dependent gene expression, we used the luciferase reporter plasmid p-1646Luc2 (28Chang C.Y. Puga A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), containing the mouse Cyp1a1 gene promoter region from nucleotide -1646 to + 57. Plasmids expressing the co-activator p300 were from Upstate Biotechnologies Inc.; human BRG-1 expression plasmid and co-regulator plasmids pCR3.1-hSRC-1A and pSG5-Tif 2 (SRC-2) were kindly provided by Dr. Erik Knudsen and Dr. Sohaib Khan (University of Cincinnati Medical Center), respectively. For transfection experiments, cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 4 × 104 cells/well and transfected at 70–80% confluence using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). Briefly, 50 ng of reporter plasmid, 200 ng of pBluescript or co-regulator plasmids, and 25 ng of pCMVβ-gal plasmid were incubated with Plus reagent for 15 min in serum- and antibiotic-free medium. LipofectAMINE was added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 15 min. The transfection was carried out for 3 h, and thereafter the medium was changed to normal culture medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, and transfected cells were allowed to grow overnight before treatment. After treatment, cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with 100 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Aliquots of 50 μl of cell lysate were used to measure luciferase activity. Light units were determined immediately upon addition of 150 μl of luciferase assay buffer (20 mm Tricine, 1.07 mm MgCO2, 2.67 mm MgSO4, 33.3 mm dithiothreitol, 14.8 mg coenzyme A, 530 μm ATP, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10 mg of luciferin), using a Wallac 1420 Victor plate reader. Luciferase measurements were normalized for transfection efficiency in transient transfections using β-galactosidase activity. RNA Isolation and Real Time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using TriReagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions with additional purification steps applied to RNA samples used for microarray analysis. To verify RNA quality prior to labeling for microarray analyses, samples were analyzed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription of 20 μg of total RNA in a total volume of 30 μl containing 1× reverse transcriptase buffer, 2.5 μm random hexamers, 0.25 mm dNTP, 0.01 m dithiothreitol, 20 units of RNasin and 200 units of SuperScript™ II RNase H– reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Samples were incubated at 42 °C for 1 h, and the reverse transcriptase was inactivated by heating to 99 °C for 5 min. For real time PCR amplification, 3 μl of cDNA were amplified with mouse Cyp1a1 primers (forward primer, 5′-GCCTTCATTCTGGAGACCTTCC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CAATGGTCTCTCCGATGC-3′), giving a product of 280 bp between exon 5 and 7 of the mouse Cyp1a1 gene. Amplification of luciferase cDNA was with primers 5′-CCAACACCCCAACATCTTC-3′ and 5′-CCACAAACACAACTCCTCC-3′, giving a product of 182 bp. β-Actin amplification of the same cDNA samples was used as an internal standard. Amplification was conducted in the Smart Cycler (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) in a total volume of 25 μl consisting of 1× Brilliant™ SYBR® Green QPCR Master Mix (Stratagene) and 0.4 μm mouse Cyp1a1 primers. The reaction mixtures were heated to 95 °C for 10 min and immediately cycled 40 times through a 24-s denaturing step at 95 °C, a 60-s annealing step at 55 °C, and a 46-s elongation step at 72 °C. Cycle threshold (CT) of each sample was automatically determined to be the first cycle at which a significant increase in optical signal above an arbitrary base line set at 30 fluorescence units was detected. All determinations were done in triplicate. The values shown represent the CT ratios of experimental to control cells treated with Me2SO, normalized to the β-actin mRNA level in the same sample. Fluorescent Labeling of Target cDNAs and High Density Microarray Hybridization—Labeling of cDNAs, preparation of microarrays, and hybridization reactions were performed by the University of Cincinnati Functional Genomics Core and are briefly described here. Fluorescence-labeled cDNAs were synthesized from 20 μg of total RNA using an indirect amino allyl labeling method (30DeRisi J. Penland L. Brown P.O. Bittner M.L. Meltzer P.S. Ray M. Chen Y. Su Y.A. Trent J.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 457-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). The cDNA was synthesized by an oligo(dT)-primed, reverse transcriptase reaction, and the cDNA was labeled with monofunctional reactive cytidine-3 and cytidine-5 dyes (Cy3 and Cy5; Amersham Biosciences). Specific details of the labeling protocols may be found at microarray.uc.edu. The hybridization probes were from arrayed mouse oligonucleotide microarrays derived from the Operon/Qiagen Verified Libraries currently containing 13,433 sequences from annotated mouse genes, affixed each in a 100-μm diameter spot to polylysine-treated microscope slides. The hybridization targets were the paired Cy-3- and Cy-5-labeled control and test cDNAs, which were mixed in approximately equal proportions and applied to the microarray for hybridization under high stringency conditions. After hybridization and washing unhybridized targets, Cy3 (green) and Cy5 (red) fluorescent channels were simultaneously scanned with independent lasers at 10 μm resolution. Each comparison was done in triplicate with flipped dye arrays to allow for the removal of gene-specific dye effects. Each comparison consisted of three microarray slides; in two slides, the cDNA was labeled with one fluorescent dye and in one it was labeled with the other dye. Overall, to eliminate labeling bias, cDNA from any one preparation was labeled an equal number of times with Cy3 as with Cy5. Data Analysis and Normalization—Microarray hybridization data representing raw spot intensities generated by the GenePix software were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes under different experimental conditions. Data normalization was performed in three steps for each microarray separately. First, channel-specific local background intensities were subtracted from the median intensity of each channel (Cy3 and Cy5). Second, background-adjusted intensities were log-transformed, and the differences (R) and averages (A) of log-transformed values were calculated as R = log2(X1) – log2(X2) and A = (log2(X1) + log2(X2))/2, where X1 and X2 denote the Cy5 and Cy3 intensities after subtracting local backgrounds, respectively. Third, data centering was performed by fitting the array-specific local regression model of R as a function of A (31Dudoit S. Yang Y.H. Callow M.J. Speed T.P. Statist. Sinica. 2001; 12: 111-139Google Scholar). The difference between the observed log ratio and the corresponding fitted value represented the normalized log-transformed gene expression ratio. Normalized log intensities for the two channels were then calculated by adding a half of the normalized ratio to A for the Cy5 channel and subtracting half of the normalized ratio from A for the Cy3 channel. Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes—The statistical analysis was performed for each gene separately by fitting the following mixed effects linear model (32Wolfinger R.D. Gibson G. Wolfinger E.D. Bennett L. Hamadeh H. Bushel P. Afshari C. Paules R.S. J. Comput. Biol. 2001; 8: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar): Yijk = μ + Ai + Sj + Ck+ ϵijk, where Yijk corresponds to the normalized log intensity on the ith array (i = 1,..., 15), with the jth treatment combination (j = 1,...,5), and labeled with the kth dye (k = 1 for Cy5, and k = 2 for Cy3). μ is the overall mean log intensity; Ai is the effect of the ith array; Sj is the effect of the jth treatment combination, and Ck is the effect of the kth dye. Assumptions about model parameters were the same as described elsewhere (32Wolfinger R.D. Gibson G. Wolfinger E.D. Bennett L. Hamadeh H. Bushel P. Afshari C. Paules R.S. J. Comput. Biol. 2001; 8: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar), with array effects assumed to be random, and treatment and dye effects assumed to be fixed. Statistical significance of the differential expression between different treatment combinations, after adjusting for the array and dye effects, was assessed by calculating p values for corresponding linear contrasts. Multiple hypothesis testing adjustment was performed by calculating false discovery rate values (33Reiner A. Yekutieli D. Benjamini Y. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar, 34Benjamini Y. Hochberg Y. J. R. Stat. Soc. B. 1995; 57: 289-300Google Scholar). Data normalization and statistical analyses were performed using SAS statistical software package (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Chromium Speciation—Hepa-1 cells were treated with 25 μm K2Cr2O7 and isolated immediately or after 1 h of incubation. Cells were rinsed twice with cold PBS and collected by scraping in deionized water. Collected cells were sonicated with four 15-s bursts and mixed with an equal volume of 100% ethanol. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm, and the supernatant was flash-frozen on dry ice. Samples were thawed at 37 °C and immediately chromatographed by high pressure liquid chromatography using modifications of methods developed by others (35Byrdy F.A. Olson L.K. Vela N.P. Caruso J.A. J. Chromatogr. A. 1995; 712: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 25-cm Dionex CarboPac PA-100 anion exchange column was eluted with a mobile phase containing 50 mm (NH4)2SO4, pH 9.2, at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. The effluent was monitored for chromium at m/z = 53, using an Agilent 7500c ICP-MS (Agilent Technologies, Tokyo, Japan). Retention times for different chromium species were 10.8 min for Cr(VI), 2.1 min for Cr(III) complexed with EDTA, and <2 min for a broad peak of uncomplexed Cr(III). Total Chromium Measurements—Hepa-1 cells were treated with 25 μm chromate (K2CrO4) or dichromate (K2Cr2O7) for 4 h. Plates were rinsed twice with cold PBS, and cells were scraped from the plates in cold PBS and collected by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 2 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 2 volumes of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2) and Dounce-homogenized after addition of Nonidet P-40 to a final concentration of 0.2%. All procedures were carried out on ice. Cell lysates were centrifuged in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 3,000 rpm for 2 min. The supernatant and the pellet were frozen at –80 °C and saved as the cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts, respectively. For analysis, samples were thawed, mixed with HNO3 to a final concentration of 1%, and digested for 30 s in a Parr Microwave Digestion Bomb. Acid digests were analyzed for chromium concentration by monitoring m/z 53 using the Agilent 7500c ICP-MS and comparing to a chromium standard curve. Experiments were carried out in triplicate. For measurements of 51Cr incorporation, 51Cr as Na2CrO4 (specific activity 425 Ci/mg; 15715 MBq/mg) was used (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The final chromate concentration of carrier Na2CrO4 was 40 μm with 10% 51Cr. Cells were incubated for 4 h and rinsed with cold PBS. Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared as described above and then counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Nuclear Run-off Experiments—Nuclear preparations were made from cells treated with Me2SO or 5 μm B[a]P for 2 h or treated with 50 μm chromium for 30 min prior to B[a]P addition. Nuclear run-offs were also done with nuclei from B[a]P-treated cells further treated with 50 μm chromium during the run-off reaction. Nuclear preparations and run-off assays were conducted essentially as described (17Maier A. Dalton T.P. Puga A. Mol. Carcinog. 2000; 28: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with the exception that 2 × 107 nuclei and 0.2 mCi of [32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were used for each reaction. Incubations were carried out for 30 min at room temperature. For those reactions in which chromium was added to the nuclei in vitro, K2Cr2O7 was added before addition of [32P]UTP to a final concentration of 1 mm. At the end of the run-off incubation, nuclei were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 s, and the supernatant was discarded. Purification of the labeled RNA and hybridization was carried out as described previously (17Maier A. Dalton T.P. Puga A. Mol. Carcinog. 2000; 28: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Incorporation was quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Storm 860, Amersham Biosciences). ChIP Assays—Protocols were based on procedures published by others (36Wells J. Farnham P.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 37Weinmann A.S. Farnham P.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Hepa-1 cells were grown to 90–100% confluence (∼2–3 × 107 cells) in 150-cm plates. Cells were treated with Me2SO vehicle or 5 μm B[a]P for 1 h or pretreated with 50 μm chromium for 0.5 h followed by either no other treatment or with 5 μm B[a]P for an additional hour. Cross-linking was accomplished by a 10-min incubation at room temperature with formaldehyde added directly to the culture media to a final concentration of 1%. The reaction was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. After rinsing twice with ice-cold PBS, cells were scraped from the dishes, pelleted, and washed again with PBS plus 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell pellets were resuspended in cell lysis buffer (5 mm PIPES, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, plus the protease inhibitors 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cells were homogenized on ice in a Dounce homogenizer using the B-type pestle 20 times to aid in nuclei release. The nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in nuclei lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS plus protease inhibitors) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Chromatin was sonicated on ice with four 10-s bursts of 30 watts with a 30-s interval between bursts. Average length of the DNA was 600 bp. For immunoprecipitation, chromatin was first precleared for 15 min at 4 °C with protein A-agarose saturated with bovine serum albumin and salmon sperm DNA (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). The supernatant was divided equally among all samples and incubated overnight on a rotating platform at 4 °C with antibodies (1 μg/2 × 107 cells) against AHR (Biomol), ARNT (a gift of Dr. Oliver Hankinson), p300 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and HDAC-1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), respectively. Protein A-agarose slurry (20 μl) was added and incubated for 15 min at room temperature to allow it to bind to the antibody. The agarose beads were pelleted and washed twice with"
https://openalex.org/W2014406863,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a secreted protein that regulates proliferation, differentiation, and death in various cell types, including thyroid cells, although few details are known about its mechanisms of action in this cell type. Here, we studied the role of TGF-β on the regulation of sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) gene expression in PC Cl3 thyroid cells. TGF-β inhibits thyroid-stimulated hormone (TSH)-induced NIS mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. This effect takes place at the transcriptional level, as TGF-β inhibits TSH-induced transcription of a luciferase reporter construct containing a 2.8-kb DNA fragment of the rat NIS promoter. The inhibitory effect of TGF-β was partially overcome by inhibitory Smad7 and mimicked by overexpression of either Smad3 or a constitutively activated mutant of TGF-β receptor I (acALK-5). Using internal deletions of the promoter, we defined a region between –2,841 to –1,941, which includes the NIS upstream enhancer (NUE), as responsible for the TGF-β/Smad inhibitory effect. NUE contains two binding sites for the paired domain transcription factor Pax8, the main factor controlling NIS transcription. The physical interaction observed between Pax8 and Smad3 appears to be responsible for the decrease in Pax8 binding to DNA. Expression of Pax8 mRNA and protein was also decreased by TGF-β treatment. The results suggest that, through activation of Smad3, TGF-β decreases Pax8 DNA binding activity as well as Pax8 mRNA and protein levels, which are at least partially involved in TGF-β-induced down-regulation of NIS gene expression in thyroid follicular cells. Our results thus demonstrate a novel mechanism of Smad3 function in regulating thyroid cell differentiation by functionally antagonizing the action of the paired domain transcription factor Pax8. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a secreted protein that regulates proliferation, differentiation, and death in various cell types, including thyroid cells, although few details are known about its mechanisms of action in this cell type. Here, we studied the role of TGF-β on the regulation of sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) gene expression in PC Cl3 thyroid cells. TGF-β inhibits thyroid-stimulated hormone (TSH)-induced NIS mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. This effect takes place at the transcriptional level, as TGF-β inhibits TSH-induced transcription of a luciferase reporter construct containing a 2.8-kb DNA fragment of the rat NIS promoter. The inhibitory effect of TGF-β was partially overcome by inhibitory Smad7 and mimicked by overexpression of either Smad3 or a constitutively activated mutant of TGF-β receptor I (acALK-5). Using internal deletions of the promoter, we defined a region between –2,841 to –1,941, which includes the NIS upstream enhancer (NUE), as responsible for the TGF-β/Smad inhibitory effect. NUE contains two binding sites for the paired domain transcription factor Pax8, the main factor controlling NIS transcription. The physical interaction observed between Pax8 and Smad3 appears to be responsible for the decrease in Pax8 binding to DNA. Expression of Pax8 mRNA and protein was also decreased by TGF-β treatment. The results suggest that, through activation of Smad3, TGF-β decreases Pax8 DNA binding activity as well as Pax8 mRNA and protein levels, which are at least partially involved in TGF-β-induced down-regulation of NIS gene expression in thyroid follicular cells. Our results thus demonstrate a novel mechanism of Smad3 function in regulating thyroid cell differentiation by functionally antagonizing the action of the paired domain transcription factor Pax8. Iodide is an essential element in thyroid physiology as a critical component of thyroxine and triiodothyronine molecules and a key regulator of thyroid gland function. The first step in iodide metabolism is represented by thyroid trapping, which is achieved by an active, energy-dependent transport process across the basolateral plasma membrane of the thyrocytes.

The NUE stimulates transcription in a thyroid-specific, cAMP-dependent manner and involves the most relevant aspect of NIS regulation. NUE contains thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1)-binding sites that have no effect on NIS transcription, Pax8 binding sites, and a degenerate cAMP responsive element sequence. Full TSH-cAMP-dependent transcription requires Pax8 binding and the integrity of the cAMP responsive element-like sequence in the rat and human NIS promoters (3Riedel C. Dohan O. De la Vieja A.

I– uptake is stimulated by TSH, the master hormone for thyroid gland regulation. TSH stimulation results, at least in part, from the cAMP-mediated increase in NIS biosynthesis. TSH not only stimulates NIS transcription and biosynthesis but is also required for modulating the NIS phosphorylation pattern, maintaining its half-life, and retaining NIS at the thyrocyte plasma membrane (4Dohan O.

The main factor regulating NIS activity in the thyroid, other than TSH, has long been considered to be iodide itself. In addition to TSH and I–, cytokines, estrogen, growth factors, thyroglobulin, and dexamethasone also play a role in NIS modulation (3Riedel C. Dohan O. De la Vieja A. Ginter C.S. Carrasco N.

Both infiltrating inflammatory cells and thyroid follicular cells themselves produce cytokines, which affect thyroid function and growth and cause immunological changes in the gland. The cytokines studied include transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), tumor necrosis factor-α and -β (TNF-α and -β), interferon γ (INF-γ), and interleukins (ILs), all of which exert an inhibitory effect on thyroid function, including decreased NIS expression and I– uptake (4Dohan O.

Thyroid. 1997; 7: 647-654Google Scholar). The TGF-β family of cytokines regulates cell proliferation, survival, adhesion, migration, differentiation, and specification of developmental fate. TGF-β is also a potent immunosuppressor, and perturbation of its signaling is linked to autoimmunity, inflammation, and cancer (23Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Google Scholar, 24Hill C.S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1249-1254Google Scholar, 25Moustakas A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3355-3356Google Scholar, 26Moustakas A.

The Smads are the family of intracellular transducers that act downstream of receptors for TGF-β family members, and they are the only TGF-β-receptor substrates with a demonstrated ability to propagate signals (23Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Google Scholar, 24Hill C.S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1249-1254Google Scholar, 25Moustakas A. J.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4359-4369Google Scholar). TGF-β binds to a specific serine/threonine kinase type II receptor on the cell surface, resulting in activation of the dormant kinase activity of the type I receptor. The activated receptor then phosphorylates members of the Smad family termed R-Smads (Smad2 and Smad3). The phosphorylated R-Smads form oligomers with the unique Co-Smad (Smad4) and rapidly translocate to the nucleus, where the Smad complex participates in transcriptional regulation. A third class of Smads, inhibitory Smads (Smad7), antagonize R-Smad activity. Smads thus signal transiently in the nucleus by controlling the expression of specific genes (23Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Google Scholar, 24Hill C.S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1249-1254Google Scholar, 25Moustakas A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3355-3356Google Scholar, 28Massague J.

TGF-β production and secretion, as well as the expression of TGF-β-specific receptors, have been demonstrated in normal and diseased thyroid follicular cells (30Grubeck-Loebenstein B. Buchan G. Chantry D. Turner M. Londei M. Feldmann M. J. Autoimmun. 1989; 2: 171-176Google Scholar, 31Franzen A. Piek E. Westermark B. ten Dijke P. Heldin N.E. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4300-4310Google Scholar), and several TGF-β family members have been implicated in the regulation of thyroid growth and function. Although several reports have shown that TGF-β regulates thyroid-specific genes (4Dohan O. De La Vieja A. Paroder V. Riedel C. Artani M. Reed M. Ginter C.S. Carrasco N. Endocr.

Thyroid. 2001; 11: 3-14Google Scholar), the mechanism by which TGF-β modulates thyroid function remains unknown. Here, we studied NIS gene regulation by TGF-β and further explored the mechanism of TGF-β action by examining the involvement of the Smad pathway in the thyroid. We show that TGF-β decreases NIS gene expression in PC Cl3 cells by reducing TSH transcriptional activation. A responsive region within the NIS promoter (–2841 to –1941), containing two Pax8-binding sites, is necessary for the TGF-β response. In addition, we provide evidence of a novel repression mechanism involving a physical and functional interaction between Pax8 and Smad3. This interaction may explain the mechanism of TGF-β down-regulation of NIS gene expression in thyroid follicular cells and might be extended to other genes transactivated by Pax8. Cell Culture—PC Cl3 cells were cultured in Coon's modified Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% donor calf serum and a six-hormone mixture (1 nm TSH, 10 μg/ml insulin, 10 ng/ml somatostatin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 10 nm hydrocortisone, and 10 ng/ml glycyl-l-histidyl-l-lysine acetate; complete medium). The effect of hormones and growth factors was studied by starving near confluent cells for TSH and insulin in the presence of 0.2% serum (starvation medium) for 72 h. Because of the exceptionally long half-life of NIS (4Dohan O. De La Vieja A. Paroder V. Riedel C. Artani M. Reed M. Ginter C.S. Carrasco N. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 48-77Google Scholar), to analyze this protein the cells were starved for 7 days. After starvation, TSH (1 nm) and TGF-β (10 ng/ml) were added to culture medium (24 h unless otherwise indicated). Hormones were obtained from Sigma and TGF-β from PeproTech. RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated by the guanidinium-thiocyanate-phenol procedure (37Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar) from PC Cl3 cells after treatments. Total RNA (20 μg) was separated in 1% agarose gels containing 0.44 m formaldehyde. RNA was blotted onto Nytran filters (Schleicher & Schuell). Hybridization was carried out with specific and 18 S rRNA probes labeled by random oligo priming. Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysis—Membranes from PC Cl3 cells were prepared by collecting cells in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. Cells homogenates were centrifuged (100,000 × g, 60 min, 4 °C), and the pellet was resuspended in buffer as above. For subcellular fractionation, PC Cl3 cells were collected in buffer A (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and sedimented at low centrifugal force to pellet nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant (cytoplasmic extract) was collected, and the nuclear pellet was resuspended in buffer C (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (38Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Google Scholar). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant fraction was collected. Nuclear, cytoplasmic, and membrane protein concentration were determined according to Bradford (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Ponceau S staining of the blots for NIS detection showed equal protein loading. Membranes were blocked and incubated with the antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with Luminol Western blot detection reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Plasmids—The 2,854-bp DNA fragment (pNIS-2.8) of the rat NIS promoter was cloned in our laboratory (21Garcia B. Santisteban P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 342-352Google Scholar). The 5′-deletion constructs with (pNIS-NUE-1.2 and pNIS-NUE-0.5) or without NUE (pNIS-2, pNIS-1.2, and pNIS-0.5) were described previously (21Garcia B. Santisteban P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 342-352Google Scholar). pRL-TK, which contains a cDNA encoding Renilla (Promega), was used to monitor transfection efficiency. The expression vectors pCMV5-FLAG-Smad3, pCMV5-Smad4-HA, and pcDNA3-FLAG-Smad7, encoding FLAG or hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged human Smad members, and pCMV5-TβRI (ALK-5), harboring a constitutively activated form of the TGF-β receptor type I (TβRI), have been described previously (40Sanchez-Elsner T.

Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Google Scholar). Full-length Pax8 and the carboxyl-terminal deletion ΔPax8 were subcloned in our laboratory in the pcDNA3.1+ vector. Transfection—PC Cl3 cells were plated at 6 × 105 cells per 60-mm diameter tissue culture dish 48 h before transfection. Transfections were performed by calcium phosphate coprecipitation. To study the effect of TSH and TGF-β, transfected cells were cultured in starvation medium (72 h) and treated with TSH or TSH plus TGF-β. After 24 h, cells were collected for a LUC and Renilla activity assay using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). In cotransfection experiments, the amount of DNA was normalized using the corresponding insertless expression vector as the carrier. GST Pull-down Analysis—For GST pull-downs, GST fusion constructs of Smad3 or Pax8 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). Equal amounts of GST or GST-Smad3 bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with in vitro transcribed and translated (TnT translation kit, Promega) full-length Pax8 or ΔPax8 labeled with [35S]methionine on ice for 2 h. Beads were washed five times in wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors), and specifically bound proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. In GST pull-down assays with nuclear cell extracts, PC Cl3 cell extracts were incubated with GST or GST fusion proteins (GST-Smad3 and GST-Pax8) bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads on ice for 2 h. Beads were washed in wash buffer, and specifically bound proteins were detected by Western blot analysis. Specific immunodetection was carried out by incubation with anti-Pax8 or anti-Smad3 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Band Shift Assay—A band shift probe corresponding to an oligonucleotide of Pax8-binding sites in rNIS promoter (site PB within the NUE) (9Ohno M. Zannini M. Levy O. Carrasco N. di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2051-2060Google Scholar) was labeled with 32P by polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear extracts from PC Cl3 cells (7 μg), recombinant Pax8 (TnT-Pax8), or bacterially expressed GST and GST-Smad3 proteins were incubated with the labeled probe. Binding reactions were performed in a buffer containing 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 75 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 150 ng/μl poly(dI-dC), and 5% Ficoll at room temperature for 30 min. When required, samples were supplemented with an anti-Pax8 antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (F-19) or provided by Dr. R. Di Lauro (9Ohno M. Zannini M. Levy O. Carrasco N. di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2051-2060Google Scholar). Samples were electrophoresed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA. For competition, an excess of cold oligonucleotide was added to the reaction mixture. TGF-β Inhibits TSH-induced NIS mRNA and Protein Levels—Starved PC Cl3 cells were treated with TSH or TSH plus TGF-β, and NIS mRNA and protein levels were analyzed by Northern (Fig. 1A) and Western blot (Fig. 1B) assays. As described (9Ohno M. Zannini M. Levy O. Carrasco N. di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2051-2060Google Scholar), TSH stimulated NIS mRNA (Fig. 1A) and protein (Fig. 1B) levels, and TGF-β repressed the stimulatory effect of TSH in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B). The maximum inhibitory effect was reached at 10 ng/ml TGF-β. These data demonstrated that TGF-β interferes with TSH induction of NIS gene expression. TGF-β Down-regulates TSH-dependent Transcriptional Activation of the NIS Gene—To study whether TGF-β regulates transcription of the NIS gene, we used a 2.8-kb fragment of the rat NIS promoter (pNIS-2.8) (21Garcia B. Santisteban P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 342-352Google Scholar). The pNIS-2.8 contains the NUE, a regulatory element necessary for a full TSH response (9Ohno M. Zannini M. Levy O. Carrasco N. di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2051-2060Google Scholar). Luciferase reporter constructs containing the full-length DNA fragment or 5′-deletion derivatives were transiently transfected into PC Cl3 cells and assayed for transcriptional activity in response to TSH and TGF-β. TSH induced a significant stimulation of pNIS-2.8 activity, whereas TGF-β decreased the TSH-mediated transactivation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). The NIS promoter activity was not affected by TGF-β in the absence of TSH (not shown). To identify the promoter region responsible for TGF-β regulation, we analyzed the transcriptional activity of the NUE-less 5′-deletion constructs pNIS-2, pNIS-1.2, and pNIS-0.5 (Fig. 2B). As described previously, the NUE is required for full TSH stimulation of the NIS gene, and TGF-β had no effect on the transcriptional activity of any 5′-deletion constructs (Fig. 2B). TGF-β inhibition was thus abolished in chimeras that do not bear the NUE enhancer. The transfection of the constructs pNIS-2.8, pNIS-NUE-1.2, and pNIS-NUE-0.5 showed a significant activity in response to TSH as well as a reduction in luciferase activity when TGF-β was added together with TSH for 24 h (Fig. 2C). In summary, the results indicate that TGF-β interferes with TSH-dependent transcriptional activation of the NIS gene and that TGF-β requires elements within or adjacent to the NUE for this regulation. NIS Gene Repression by TGF-β Is Signaled by the Smad Proteins—To analyze the mechanism by which TGF-β down-regulates TSH-induced NIS gene transcription, we studied the intracellular mediators of the TGF-β pathway. A signaling cascade is initiated after TGF-β binding, resulting in R-Smad activation, oligomerization with Smad4, and the subsequent translocation of the Smad complex to the nucleus, where it participates in regulation of gene transcription (23Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Google Scholar, 28Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Google Scholar). To assess Smad involvement in the TGF-β effect, we cotransfected the rNIS promoter construct (pNIS-2.8) with expression vectors harboring Smad3 or Smad4 (Fig. 3A). TSH-stimulated NIS promoter activity was decreased by overexpression of Smad3 and Smad4. As predicted, the strongest inhibition was observed when both Smads were expressed (Fig. 3A). The inhibition induced by Smad4 might be caused by interaction with endogenous Smad3. Overexpression of Smad proteins thus mimicked the inhibitory effect of TGF-β on the NIS gene transcription shown above, supporting a role for the Smad pathway in TGF-β action. As Smad2 overexpression did not reproduce the TGF-β effect on NIS promoter activity (not shown), we discarded its mediation in TGF-β transcriptional repression. To confirm the participation of Smad signaling in TGF-β regulation of NIS, we transfected PC Cl3 cells with pNIS-2.8 in the presence of the constitutively activated TβRI (acALK-5) that phosphorylates and activates TGF-β-dependent R-Smads (24Hill C.S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1249-1254Google Scholar, 29Moustakas A. Souchelnytskyi S. Heldin C.H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4359-4369Google Scholar). Through activation of endogenous Smads, acALK-5 overexpression reduced TSH-stimulated NIS gene transcription, mimicking the effect of TGF-β (Fig. 3B). acALK-5-mediated inhibition was dependent on the amount of vector expressed in the cell and was similar to that exerted by TGF-β. We also analyzed the transcriptional activity of the NIS promoter (pNIS-2.8) in the presence of an inhibitory Smad (Smad7). Smad7 forms a stable association with the activated type I receptors, preventing phosphorylation of R-Smads and blocking downstream TGF-β signaling (42Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Google Scholar). Transient overexpression of Smad7 in PC Cl3 cells partially abrogated repression of NIS promoter activity by TGF-β (Fig. 3C). At the same concentrations, Smad7 partially prevented inhibition of the NIS promoter construct by acALK-5 (Fig. 3D), indicating the specificity of Smad7 in blocking Smad-mediated transcriptional repression. Altogether, the results firmly establish the functional requirement for Smad3 in mediating TGF-β transcriptional repression. Nuclear Accumulation of Smad3 and Smad4 by TGF-β— Smad3 and Smad4 normally reside in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells and are imported to the nucleus as complexes in response to TGF-β signaling to regulate target gene transcription (23Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Google Scholar, 24Hill C.S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1249-1254Google Scholar, 25Moustakas A. J.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4359-4369Google Scholar). Because the nuclear entry of the Smads is a key step in signal transduction, we analyzed the accumulation of Smad3 and Smad4 in the nucleus of PC Cl3 cells after TGF-β treatment. We observed a rapid and a striking increase in both proteins in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 4A) with a parallel decrease in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 4B). This effect is TGF-β-specific, because TSH alone did not induce Smad translocation to the nucleus (compare first and second lanes of Fig. 4, A and B). After prolonged TGF-β treatment (4 and 24 h), Smad3 and Smad4 levels in nuclear extracts fall, although a corresponding increase was not detected in the cytoplasmic fraction. This effect could be explained by the previously described degradation of Smads induced after long treatment with TGF-β (23Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Google Scholar). Our results showed accumulation of both Smads in the PC Cl3 cell nucleus, confirming activation of the Smad signaling pathway by TGF-β and supporting Smad participation as intracellular effectors of TGF-β action in thyroid follicular cells. TGF-β Decreases the Binding of Pax8 to Its Response Element in the NIS Promoter—The NUE has two Pax8-binding sites, which are required to obtain the full TSH/cAMP-dependent transcription (4Dohan O.

https://openalex.org/W2029022814,"The PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten) tumor suppressor gene affects multiple cellular processes including cell growth, proliferation, and cell migration by antagonizing phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). However, mechanisms by which PTEN expression is regulated have not been studied extensively. Similar to PTEN, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) affects a wide spectrum of diseases including inflammatory processes and cancer by acting as a mediator of apoptosis, inflammation, and immunity. In this study, we show that treatment of cancer cell lines with TNF-α decreases PTEN expression. In addition, overexpression of TNF-α downstream signaling targets, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-inducing kinase (NIK) and p65 nuclear factor NF-κB, lowers PTEN expression, suggesting that TNF-α-induced down-regulation of PTEN is mediated through a TNF-α/NIK/NF-κB pathway. Down-regulation of PTEN by NIK/NF-κB results in activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and augmentation of TNF-α-induced PI3K/Akt stimulation. Importantly, we demonstrate that this effect is associated with a lack of an inhibitor of κB (IκB)-α autoregulatory loop. Moreover, these findings suggest the interaction between PI3K/Akt and NF-κB via transcriptional regulation of PTEN and offer one possible explanation for increased tumorigenesis in systems in which NF-κB is chronically activated. In such a tumor system, these findings suggest a positive feedback loop whereby Akt activation of NF-κB further stimulates Akt via down-regulation of the PI3K inhibitor PTEN.

Yet, despite the important role played by PTEN in cellular processes and the extensive characterization of mutations in human cancers, only a few reports have evaluated the regulation of PTEN expression. A p53-dependent regulation of the PTEN gene has been described (14Stambolic V. MacPherson D. Sas D. Lin Y. Snow B. Jang Y. Benchimol S. Mak T.W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 317-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar); however, another study has suggested that p53 plays only a minor role in PTEN gene expression (15Sheng X. Koul D. Liu J.L. Liu T.J. Yung W.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The ligand-activated nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ has also been shown to up-regulate PTEN expression (16Patel L. Pass I. Coxon P. Downes C.P. Smith S.A. Macphee C.H.

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is a secreted molecule that is involved in the control of tissue homeostasis and also in the progression of pathological conditions (20Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). It regulates many cellular processes including apoptosis, abnormal cell growth, inflammation, and angiogenesis (20Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). TNF-α binding to the subtype of receptors containing a death domain (TNFR1) recruits TRADD (TNFR1-associated death domain protein), FADD (Fas-associated-death domain protein) and FLICE (FADD-like ICE; also known as caspase 8) to induce apoptosis (19Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar, 20Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). Alternatively, TNFR1 recruits RIP (receptor-interacting protein) to activate NF-κB signaling (19Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar), whereas TRADD can interact with TRAF2 (TNFR-associated factor 2) and activate the NF-κB pathway through NIK (NF-κB-inducing kinase) as well as AP-1 through c-Jun N-terminal kinase (21Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar). On the other hand, TNF-α binding to the subtype of receptors without a death domain (TNFR2) recruits TRAF1 and TRAF2 and thus activates NF-κB and AP-1 without influence on TRADD-dependent apoptosis (22Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Finally, it is worth noting that TNF-α can also activate the PI3K/Akt pathway, which in turn facilitates NF-κB activation by Akt (23Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar). Importantly, the activation of NF-κB inhibits the apoptosis induced by TNF-α through FADD and by other stimuli (24Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar, 25Liu Z.G. Hsu H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M.

Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2445) Google Scholar). In addition to its antiapoptotic effect, pivotal roles of NF-κB have been described in immune and inflammatory responses through the regulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes (27Lawrence T. Gilroy D.W. Colville-Nash P.R. Willoughby D.A. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1291-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) as well as in oncogenesis (28Mayo M.W. Wang C.Y. Cogswell P.C. Rogers-Graham K.S. Lowe S.W. Der C.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1997; 278: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). NF-κB is also implicated in growth control by regulating cyclin D1 (29Hinz M. Krappmann D. Eichten A. Heder A. Scheidereit C. Strauss M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2690-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) and c-Myc (30Kessler D.J. Duyao M.P. Spicer D.B. Sonenshein G.E. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) expression. NF-κB is a dimeric transcription factor formed by Rel family of proteins (RelA/p65, RelB, cRel, p50, p52) (for review, see Ref. 31Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4058) Google Scholar). The predominant dimer in many cell types is the p65:p50 heterodimer. Its activity is regulated by IκB (inhibitor of NF-κB) isoforms, IκB-α being the most prominent member, by complexing with NF-κB in the cytoplasm and preventing nuclear translocation. To understand better the role of PTEN in cellular processes and to formulate potential therapeutic management of diseases involving PTEN alteration, it is important to obtain insight into the regulation of PTEN expression. The role of TNF-α in activating NF-κB has been well established. Although the PI3K/Akt pathway facilitates NF-κB activation, whether NF-κB, in turn, can affect the PI3K/Akt pathway antagonized by PTEN has not been examined. In this study, we show that treatment of cancer cell lines with TNF-α and subsequent activation of NIK and p65 NF-κB decrease the expression of PTEN, thereby augmenting TNF-α activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. This effect is associated with the absence of an IκB-α autoregulatory loop. Materials—TNF-α was purchased from Sigma.

Briefly, attached cells were collected and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. Whole-cell lysates were prepared using Cell Lysis Buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Proteins (50–100 μg/lane) were separated by NuPAGE 4–12% BisTris gel and transferred electrophoretically to Immuno-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C or 1 h at room temperature with blocking solution (Tris-buffered saline solution containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20). Blots were then incubated for 2–3 h at room temperature or at 4 °C overnight with primary antibodies in 1% buffer solution (Tris-buffered saline solution containing 1% nonfat dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20), washed twice with 1% buffer solution, and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After two washes with Tris-buffered saline solution containing 0.05% Tween 20 followed by a final wash with Tris-buffered saline without Tween 20, the immune complexes were visualized using the ECL system or the SuperSignal West Dura system. RNA Isolation and Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using TriZol reagent. Applied Biosystem Assays-by-Design (P/N 4331348) 20× assay mixture (Foster City, CA) of primers and TaqMan® MGB probes (FAM™ dye-labeled) for the target gene, human PTEN (NCBI accession no. NM_000314), and predeveloped 18 S rRNA (VIC™-dye-labeled probe) TaqMan® assay reagent (P/N 4319413E) for internal control were utilized. Human PTEN primers were designed to span the exon 6-exon 7 junction so as not to detect genomic DNA. Primer and probe sequences were searched against the Celera Genomic data base (www.celeradiscoverysystem.com) to confirm specificity. The probe and primer sequences of human PTEN were as follows: probe, TGAGGATTGCAAGTTC; forward, CAAGATGATGTTTGAAACTATTCCAATG; reverse, CCTTTAGCTGGCAGACCACAA. A validation experiment was performed to test the efficiency of the target amplification and the efficiency of the reference amplification. The absolute value of the slope of log input amount versus ΔCT was <0.1. Singleplex one-step RT-PCR was performed with 20 ng of RNA for both target gene (PTEN) and endogenous control. The reagent used was TaqMan® one-step RT-PCR master mix reagent kit (P/N 4309169). The cycling parameters for one-step RT-PCR were as follows: RT, 48 °C for 30 min; AmpliTaq activation, 95 °C for 10 min; denaturation, 95 °C for 15 s; and annealing/extension, 60 °C for 1 min (repeat 40 times). Triplicate CT values were analyzed using Microsoft Excel using the comparative CT (ΔΔCT) method as described by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). The amount of target (2-ΔΔCT) was obtained after normalization with an endogenous reference (18 S). ELISA-based Transcription Factor Activity Assay—Nuclear protein from HT29 cells was extracted using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents and quantified using the protein assay dye reagent. ELISA-based transcription factor activity assay was performed following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 10 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated within 96-well format chamber coated with oligonucleotides containing consensus binding sequences for either p50 or p65 NF-κB. Bound transcription factors were then detected by a specific anti-p50 or -p65 antibodies followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, which was used to detect the bound primary antibody. For competition assays, excess competitor oligonucleotides were coincubated with nuclear protein. For p50 and p65 transcription factor activity assays, 500-ng and 1,000-ng competitor oligonucleotides were used, respectively. Samples were run in triplicates, and all experiments were performed on at least two separate occasions. Transient Transfection, Luciferase Assays—A PCR fragment encompassing the human PTEN promoter was amplified with the primers PTENa 5′-GGTAACCTCAGACTCGAGTCAGTGA-3′ and PTENb 5′-TGGCTGCCATGGCTGGGAGCCTGTG-3′ using Platinum Taq DNA polymerase and the PCRx enhancer system following the instructions of the supplier. The PCR fragment was cut with the restriction enzymes XhoI and NcoI and inserted in the corresponding sites of the pGL3-Basic reporter vector. Cell transfections were conducted as described previously (33Kim S. Domon-Dell C. Wang Q. Chung D.H. Di Cristofano A. Pandolfi P.P. Freund J.N. Evers B.M. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 1163-1178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, HT29 cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells into 24-well plates in triplicate 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were then transiently transfected with 0.4 μg of the PTEN-promoter firefly luciferase reporter plasmid and 0.05 μg of Renilla reporter pRL-null to normalize for variation in transfection efficiency, using LipofectAMINE Plus transfection agent following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Cells were harvested for measurement of firefly and Renilla luciferase activities using the dual luciferase assay system. Firefly luciferase activity was determined by subtracting background signal and normalized to the Renilla activity. Fold inhibition was calculated by dividing treatment values by control values. Statistical Analysis—All data presented with statistical analysis were analyzed using a two-sample t test. All tests were assessed at the 0.05 level of significance. TNF-α Treatment Decreases PTEN Expression—To examine the effect of TNF-α on PTEN expression, we used the human colon cancer cell line HT29, a cell line without mutation in the endogenous PTEN gene sequence. 2S.

Cells growing in serum-containing medium were treated with increasing concentrations of TNF-α (0.01–1.0 nm) for 24 h and extracted for protein expression. Western blotting demonstrated a TNF-α-mediated dose-dependent decrease in PTEN (Fig. 1A). Concomitant with PTEN decrease, a similar reduction in IκB-α was also observed, demonstrating TNF-α-induced IκB-α degradation. To examine whether the reduction of PTEN protein was linked to a modification in gene expression, HT29 cells were treated with 1 nm TNF-α over a time course, and total cellular mRNA was extracted for analysis of PTEN expression by real time RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1B, TNF-α caused a significant reduction in PTEN mRNA, which was apparent after 9 h of treatment and continued over 24 h. In addition, we constructed a reporter plasmid containing 1,365 bp of the human PTEN promoter (NCBI accession no. NM_000314) inserted upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. This plasmid was transfected into HT29 cells, and luciferase assay was performed 24 h after 1 nm TNF-α treatment; luciferase activity was reduced in TNF-α-treated cells as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1C). Together, these data indicate that TNF-α down-regulates PTEN expression at the level of gene transcription. To assess whether the TNF-α effect on PTEN is limited to certain cell types, we examined other human-derived cell lines. Similar to results obtained in HT29 cells, decreased PTEN protein expression was noted in the colon cancer cell line SW480 and in the cervical cancer cell line SiHa (Fig. 1D). However, a reduction in PTEN expression was not observed in the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293, suggesting that the TNF-α-mediated reduction in PTEN expression is cell line-dependent. NF-κB Activation Is Sustained in HT29 Cells Treated with TNF-α—Because the NF-κB pathway is an important target of TNF-α signaling, we analyzed key elements of this pathway after TNF-α treatment in HT29 cells. For this purpose, cells were treated with a single dose of TNF-α (1 nm) and analyzed over a 72-h time course. As expected from the above results, PTEN protein expression was decreased 24, 48, and 72 h after TNF-α treatment (Fig. 2A). Concomitant with PTEN reduction, this treatment produced a sustained reduction in IκB-α throughout the 72-h time course. To confirm that NF-κB activation accompanied the TNF-α-induced reduction of IκB-α, nuclear protein was extracted from treated and untreated HT29 cells and analyzed by ELISA-based DNA binding activity of NF-κB using a consensus double-stranded oligonucleotide (35Shen Z. Peedikayil J. Olson G.K. Siebert P.D. Fang Y. BioTechniques. 2002; 32 (1170-1172, 1174): 1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Analysis for p50 NF-κB showed maximal p50 binding activity at 8 h of TNF-α treatment (Fig. 2B), whereas maximal activity for p65 NF-κB was observed within 1 h of TNF-α treatment (Fig. 2C). The specificity of DNA binding was confirmed by competition assays, where free floating excess oligonucleotide blocked both p50 and p65 NF-κB binding activities. These data corroborate the finding that TNF-α treatment increases NF-κB binding activity and correlates with reduction in IκB-α expression. In addition, these data show that NF-κB activity is sustained without signs of inhibition as might be expected because of an IκB autoregulatory inhibition. NIK and Activation of p65 NF-κB Decrease PTEN Expression—TNF-α binding to TNFR1 activates NF-κB through recruitment of the TRAF2 adaptor protein and the serine/threonine kinase NIK (21Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar). Subsequently, NIK phosphorylates IκB kinase, which targets IκB-α for ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation, thus allowing NF-κB to translocate into the cell nucleus (36Beg A.A. Finco T.S. Nantermet P.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3301-3310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Ling L. Cao Z. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3792-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). To determine whether TNF-α-induced PTEN reduction is mediated through NIK, an adenovirus containing the NIK gene was used to infect HT29 cells. Consistent with the effect observed previously by TNF-α treatment, NIK overexpression decreased PTEN expression as well as the level of IκB-α, suggesting NF-κB activation (Fig. 3A). Conversely, we analyzed the effect of the expression of the superrepressor of IκB-α after cell infection with the recombinant adenovirus Ad5IκB-AA. The superrepressor of IκB-α does not undergo degradation upon TNF-α stimulation (38Jobin C. Panja A. Hellerbrand C. Iimuro Y. Didonato J. Brenner D.A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 410-418PubMed Google Scholar), hence it sequesters NF-κB in the cytoplasm. We found that the infection of IκB-α superrepressor actually increased PTEN expression and the endogenous level of IκB-α (Fig. 3B). Next, we examined whether NF-κB can directly suppress PTEN expression by overexpressing the p65 subunit of NF-κB in HT29 cells. Overexpression of p65 protein decreased PTEN expression and, in combination with TNF-α treatment, an additive suppression was observed (Fig. 3C). To provide additional evidence that the TNF-α-induced PTEN decrease is functionally dependent on the activation of the NF-κB pathway, HT29 cells were treated with 1 nm TNF-α together with SN50, a cell-permeable peptide that binds to uncomplexed NF-κB and prevents nuclear translocation of NF-κB (39Lin Y.Z. Yao S.Y. Veach R.A. Torgerson T.R. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14255-14258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3D, SN50 peptide prevented the decrease in PTEN expression in TNF-α-treated cells, without affecting the decrease in IκB-α, confirming that this inhibitor acts downstream of IκB on the translocation of NF-κB. Moreover, the mutant inactive peptide SN50M was unable to prevent the TNF-α-induced PTEN decrease. Togethe"

We used a sequence-specific polyclonal antibody directed against phosphorylated Ser302 to study IRS-1-mediated signaling during insulin and insulin-like growth factor IGF-I stimulation. Insulin or IGF-I stimulated phosphorylation of Ser302 in various cell backgrounds and in murine muscle.

Replacing Ser302 with alanine significantly reduced insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and p85 binding and reduced insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of p70S6K, ribosomal S6 protein, and 4E-BP1; however, this mutation had no effect on insulin-stimulated Akt or glycogen synthase kinase 3β phosphorylation.

Although the role of each of these substrates merits attention, work with transgenic mice suggests that many insulin responses, especially those that are associated with somatic growth and carbohydrate metabolism, are mediated through IRS-1 or IRS-2 (2White M.F.

IRS-proteins are composed of multiple interaction domains and phosphorylation motifs, but they appear to lack intrinsic catalytic activities (5Yenush L. White M.F. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 491-500Google Scholar). All IRS-proteins contain an NH2-terminal pleckstrin homology domain followed by a phosphotyrosine binding domain. These domains couple the IRS-protein to the activated receptors for insulin, IGF-I, IL-4 and others (6Eck M.J. Dhe-Paganon S. Trub T. Nolte R.T. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 695-705Google Scholar). Multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the COOH terminus recruit various enzymes (PI3K, SHP2, or fyn) or adapter proteins (Grb-2, nck, crk, shb, and others) that promote carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, cell growth and survival, and the function of specialized neuroendocrine tissues that promote nutrient homeostasis and female fertility (5Yenush L.

Insulin plays a pivotal role in metabolic regulation because it promotes nutrient influx and storage in muscle and adipocytes and inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis. Although insulin is the principal activator, heterologous signals reflecting nutrient availability or physiological stress modulate insulin signaling. Dysregulation of these heterologous signals contributes to peripheral insulin resistance, metabolic dysregulation, and diabetes (2White M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E413-E422Google Scholar). Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain heterologous regulation of the insulin signaling cascade, including cytokine-induced serine phosphorylation or degradation of the IRS-proteins, or direct inhibition of the insulin receptor. IRS-1 contains more than 20 potential serine phosphorylation sites in amino acid sequence motifs that are recognized by various kinases, including protein kinase A, protein kinase B/Akt, protein kinase C, ERK1/2, Rho kinase and mTOR (8Li J. De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9351-9356Google Scholar, 9De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31400-31406Google Scholar, 10Barthel A. Nakatani K. Dandekar A.A. Roth R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 509-513Google Scholar). Many studies suggest that serine phosphorylation causes insulin resistance by blocking the interaction between IRS-1 and the activated insulin receptor, inhibiting the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues, or promoting IRS-1 degradation (11Tanti J.F.

Previous work from our laboratory shows that JNK-mediated phosphorylation of Ser307 inhibits coupling of IRS-1 to the activated insulin receptor, which reduces insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation and insulin signaling (14Aguirre V. Werner E.D. Giraud J. Lee Y.H. Shoelson S.E. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1531-1537Google Scholar, 15Lee Y.H. Giraud J. Davis R.J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2896-2902Google Scholar). By contrast, here we show that an adjacent residue, Ser302, is required for insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and that its phosphorylation might link insulin signaling to nutrient availability. Antibodies and Reagents—Phosphospecific Ser302 antibodies were made by injecting rabbits with a synthetic peptide designed to contain phosphorylated Ser302 (Boston Biomolecule). Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Antibodies against IRS-1 and p85 have been described (16Pons S. Asano T. Glasheen E.M. Miralpeix M. Zhang Y. Fisher T.L. Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4453-4465Google Scholar). Antibodies against phosphotyrosine, phospho-Akt, Akt, phospho-p70S6K, p70S6K, phosphoribosomal S6, ribosomal S6, phospho-4E-BP-1, phospho-GSK-3β and GSK-3 were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. JNK antibodies were from Santa Cruz. Monoclonal antibodies against full-length IRS-1 were made in the laboratory. All inhibitors, cytokines, and growth factors were purchased from Calbiochem. A BrdUrd cell proliferation kit was purchased from Oncogene Research Products. Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), 50× amino acid solution, and dextrose were from Invitrogen. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were from Roger Davis. Mutagenesis—IRS-1 point mutants for Ser302 to Ala were generated using the Stratagene QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis method. Cell Culture—IL-3-dependent 32D mouse myeloid cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% WEHI (IL-3), and 5 mm histidinol. 32D express a few endogenous insulin receptors but no endogenous IRS-proteins. Overexpression of IRS-1 in 32D cells reconstitutes many aspects of the insulin signaling pathway (17Mendez R. Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Rhoads R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2857-2864Google Scholar, 18Myers Jr., M.G. Mendez R. Shi P. Pierce J.H. Rhoads R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26908-26914Google Scholar). These cells were starved for at least 4 h before treatment with insulin/IGF-I. All inhibitors were added 30 min before insulin or growth factor treatment at 37 °C. 32D/IRS-1 and 32D/A302IRS-1 (mutant IRS-1 protein containing an alanine substitution for Ser302) were generated by electroporation and selected in histidinol as described previously (19Yenush L. Zanella C. Uchida T. Bernal D. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6784-6794Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. MEFs were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. CHO and MEF cells were starved for at least 12 h before inhibitor or insulin treatment. Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Analysis—32D cells were starved for 4 h in serum-free medium and stimulated with insulin for the indicated times. Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 130 nm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaF, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μm vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Immunoprecipitations were performed for 2 h at 4 °C followed by collection on protein A/G-Sepharose. Lysates and immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Proteins were detected by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. A similar protocol was used for CHO and MEF cells. Muscle samples from mice were prepared as in Ref. 20Rui L. Aguirre V. Kim J.K.

Amino Acid Withdrawal—CHOIR/IRS-1 cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium as described previously. For the starvation of amino acids, cells were starved for at least 12 h in serum-free medium. Cells were then washed twice with and incubated in the same buffer for 2 h. A 1× final concentration of amino acids or 5 mm of d-glucose (Glc) were added to the cells for 30 min followed by a 15-min treatment with insulin (21Patel J. Wang X. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 497-503Google Scholar). Cell Proliferation Assay—Insulin/IGF-I-stimulated proliferation of 32D cells was assayed according to the company's manual (Oncogene Research Products). Briefly, 32D cells in log phase growth were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and counted by the trypan blue exclusion method using a hematocytometer. 100 μl of cells at a density of 1 × 104 cells/ml were seeded into a 96-well culture dish. Cells were allowed to grow for 24 h. BrdUrd label was added to the cells for 6 h at 37 °C. BrdUrd incorporation was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a dual wavelength spectrometric plate reader (A450–540 nm). As controls, we included a blank containing only tissue culture medium and a background control containing only cells that were not labeled with BrdUrd. Each condition was done in triplicate, and the average absorbance values were used in plotting the results. Insulin/IGF-I Stimulates Ser302 Phosphorylation—To study serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, we raised sequence-specific polyclonal antibodies against 17-amino acid peptides containing putative serine phosphorylation sites in rat IRS-1. One of these antibodies was directed against pSer302 and designated α-pS302. The α-pS302 immunoblotted IRS-1 extracted from insulin or IGF-I-stimulated 32D/IRS-1 cells, 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and CHOIR/IRS-1 cells. Platelet-derived growth factor had a weak effect in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and epidermal growth factor and tumor necrosis factor-α did not promote Ser302 phosphorylation (Fig. 1, a–c). Ser302 phosphorylation was detected 1 min after insulin stimulation of 32D/IRS-1 cells, reached a maximum within 30 min, but was barely detected after 2 h (Fig. 1d). Moreover, Ser302 was phosphorylated in IRS-1 isolated from muscles of insulin-stimulated mice, suggesting that Ser302 phosphorylation might be physiologically relevant (Fig. 1e). We conducted peptide competition and site-directed mutagenesis experiments to establish the specificity of the α-pS302. The phosphopeptide used to produce α-pS302 (Fig. 2, a and b) completely prevented immunoblotting of IRS-1 from insulin-stimulated 32D/IRS-1 cells (Fig. 2c). The unphosphorylated peptide at best weakly inhibited immunoblotting, suggesting that the phosphoserine residue was an important determinant of specificity (Fig. 2c). The α-pS302 did not immunoblot background proteins in the various cell extracts, did not immunoblot alkaline phosphatase-treated IRS-1 immunoprecipitates, and it did not immunoblot IRS-2, even though the corresponding serine residue (Ser343) is phosphorylated (data not shown). Replacing Ser302 with Ala in IRS-1 completely abolished immunoblotting by α-pS302 (Fig. 2d). Based upon these results, we conclude that α-pS302 is specific for IRS-1 phosphorylated on Ser302. Mutation of Ser302 to Ala Impairs Insulin Signaling—Serine phosphorylation is generally thought to inhibit IRS-1 function by decreasing insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation or promoting IRS-1 degradation through a proteasome-mediated degradation pathway (22Sun X.J. Goldberg J.L. Qiao L.Y. Mitchell J.J. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1359-1364Google Scholar). For example, JNK-mediated phosphorylation of Ser307 in IRS-1 inhibits insulin signaling; replacing Ser307 with alanine increases insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream signaling (15Lee Y.H. Giraud J. Davis R.J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2896-2902Google Scholar). To establish the effect of Ser302 on IRS-1 function, we generated 32D cells expressing wild type IRS-1 or a mutant IRS-1 protein containing an alanine substitution for Ser302 (A302IRS-1). Stable 32D cell clones expressing equal amounts of IRS-1 or A302IRS-1 were identified by immunoblotting. Insulin strongly stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine and Ser302 phosphorylation in 32D/IRS-1 cells, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation was reduced significantly in A302IRS-1 (Fig. 3, a and b). Consistent with reduced tyrosine phosphorylation, A302IRS-1 associated weakly with p85 during insulin stimulation (Fig. 3c). We conclude that Ser302 promotes IRS-1 function during insulin stimulation. IRS-1 Signaling Is Regulated Differentially through Ser302— The IRS-1/PI3K cascade regulates various downstream signals during insulin/IGF-I stimulation, including the activation of Akt/GSK-3β, p70S6K/S6 and mTOR/4E-BP1 cascades. As shown previously, IRS-1 was required for insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt in 32D cells, which is consistent with the binding and activation of PI3K by IRS-1 during insulin stimulation (Fig. 4a). However, insulin stimulated normally Akt phosphorylation in 32D/A302IRS-1 cells, even though tyrosine phosphorylation of A302IRS-1 and p85 recruitment was significantly reduced during insulin stimulation (Fig. 4a). Akt phosphorylates GSK-3β on Ser9, which can be detected with a phosphospecific antibody (23Sutherland C. Leighton I.A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 15-19Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of GSK-3β was stimulated equally by insulin in 32D/IRS-1 and 32D/A302IRS-1 cells, suggesting that replacing Ser302 with alanine did not impair IRS-1-mediated activation of the Akt/GSK-3β cascade during insulin stimulation (Fig. 4a). The activation of p70S6K was investigated during insulin stimulation by immunoblotting with a phosphospecific antibody against pThr389. As shown previously, insulin failed to stimulate p70S6K phosphorylation in 32D cells, whereas it was strongly phosphorylated in 32D/IRS-1 cells, especially after 30 min of insulin stimulation (Fig. 4b). The ribosomal protein S6 and the regulatory protein 4E-BP1 are substrates of p70S6K and mTOR, respectively, and both proteins were phosphorylated during insulin stimulation of 32D/IRS-1 cells (Fig. 4b). However, insulin weakly stimulated p70S6K phosphorylation in 32D/A302IRS-1 cells, and the phosphorylation of S6 and 4E-BP1 was barely detected (Fig. 4b). Thus, Ser302 was essential for the mTOR/p70S6K branch of the IRS-1 signaling cascade. A Ser302 Kinase Associates with IRS-1—Specific association between a kinase and its substrates, followed by the recognition of phosphorylation sites by the associated kinase, determines the specificity of protein phosphorylation. To determine whether the Ser302 kinase associates with IRS-1, specific immunoprecipitates containing IRS-1 were incubated without or with 500 μm ATP. Before addition of ATP, Ser302 was phosphorylated as observed previously; however, Ser302 phosphorylation increased 2-fold after incubation with ATP (Fig. 5a) Thus, a Ser302 kinase associated with IRS-1 during immunoprecipitation. Previous studies show that JNK phosphorylates Ser307 on rat IRS-1 (Ser312 in human IRS-1), which inhibits insulin signaling (24Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R.J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9047-9054Google Scholar). Because Ser302 is close to Ser307, we tested whether JNK might phosphorylate Ser302. We conducted this experiment with wild type MEFs or JNK-deficient MEFs obtained from JNK-1–/–::JNK-2–/– mice (MEFs do not express JNK-3). Our previous work showed that Ser307 phosphorylation was decreased more than 50% in JNK1–/–::JNK2–/– MEFs (15Lee Y.H. Giraud J. Davis R.J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2896-2902Google Scholar). However, insulin or IGF-I stimulated Ser302 phosphorylation to similar levels in both wild type and JNK-1–/–::JNK-2–/– MEFs (Fig. 5b). Because recombinant JNK-1 did not phosphorylate Ser302in vitro (data not shown), we conclude that insulin/IGF-I-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser302 in IRS-1 was not mediated by JNK. These results reveal that adjacent sites in IRS-1 are phosphorylated through distinct associated kinases. Ser302 Phosphorylation Is Downstream of mTOR—We used classical inhibitors and amino acid starvation to determine whether the mTOR cascade might mediate Ser302 phosphorylation in IRS-1. Wortmannin or LY294002 (PI3K cascade), or rapamycin (mTOR cascade) inhibited insulin-stimulated Ser302 phosphorylation in MEFs, whereas PD98059 (mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade) had no inhibitory effect; these inhibitors had the expected effects on p70S6K, ERK1/2, and Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 5c). Similar results were obtained with 32D, CHO cells, and 3T3-L1 adipocytes (data not shown). Thus, mTOR-regulated pathways promote insulin-stimulated Ser302 phosphorylation. Previous results showed that activation of mTOR by mitogens or insulin is modulated by nutrient availability, including amino acids or glucose (25Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Google Scholar, 26Nojima H. Tokunaga C. Eguchi S. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Yoshino K. Hara K. Tanaka N. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15461-15464Google Scholar). We investigated the effect of amino acid and glucose starvation on Ser302 phosphorylation to establish further whether an mTOR-mediated pathway is involved. Incubation of CHOIR/IRS-1 cells in glucose and amino acid-free medium (DPBS) reduced basal and insulin-stimulated Ser302 phosphorylation (Fig. 6, a and b). Consistent with a role for the mTOR cascade, the addition of amino acids or glucose restored basal and insulin-stimulated Ser302 phosphorylation (Fig. 6, a and b). Insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation was not reduced in glucose/amino acid-free medium, suggesting that the early steps of insulin signaling were not inhibited, and sufficient ATP exists in the starved cells to mediate kinase activities (Fig. 6b). Rapamycin or LY294002 inhibited amino acid-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser302, whereas PD98059 had no effect, which was consistent with a role for the mTOR cascade during nutrient and insulin-stimulated Ser302 phosphorylation (Fig. 6c). Although our results suggest that kinases in the mTOR cascade promote Ser302 phosphorylation, mTOR itself is probably not involved. We treated cells with a relatively high concentration of okadaic acid, which inhibits protein phosphatase 2A and other related phosphatases (27Richards F.M. Milner J. Metcalfe S. Immunology. 1992; 76: 642-647Google Scholar). As expected, okadaic acid increased Ser302 phosphorylation; however, the stimulatory effect of okadaic acid was not inhibited by either rapamycin or LY294002 (Fig. 6d). We conclude that mTOR is not a direct Ser302 kinase. Ser302 Promotes Insulin-stimulated Mitogenesis—One of the main biological functions of insulin/IGF-I is to promote cell proliferation, and the activation of Akt, p70S6K, and 4E-BP1 plays an important role (28Thomas G. Biol. Res. 2002; 35: 305-313Google Scholar, 29Coutant A. Rescan C. Gilot D. Loyer P. Guguen-Guillouzo C. Baffet G. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 1079-1088Google Scholar, 30Volarevic S. Stewart M.J. Ledermann B. Zilberman F. Terracciano L. Montini E. Grompe M. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Science. 2000; 288: 2045-2047Google Scholar, 31Kawasome H. Papst P. Webb S. Keller G.M. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. Terada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5033-5038Google Scholar). Because these signals are regulated differentially by A302IRS-1, we compared insulin/IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis in 32D/IRS-1 and 32D/A302IRS-1 cells. As shown previously, insulin or IGF-I failed to promote DNA synthesis in wild type 32D cells; however, expression of IRS-1 mediated insulin/IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis (Fig. 7). Because insulin receptors are nearly absent in 32D cells, a high concentration of insulin was required to stimulate DNA synthesis in 32D/IRS-1 cells. However, insulin or IGF-I stimulation of DNA synthesis was significantly reduced in 32D/A302IRS-1 cells (Fig. 7). Our results show that Ser302 in rat/mouse IRS-1 is phosphorylated rapidly during insulin stimulation. Although we have not identified the kinase, inhibitor experiments and short term glucose/amino acid starvation suggest that mTOR-regulated kinases are involved. TOR is thought to act as a sensor of ambient amino acid concentrations (32Patti M.E. Brambilla E. Luzi L. Landaker E.J. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1519-1529Google Scholar, 33Avruch J. Belham C. Weng Q. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2001; 26: 115-154Google Scholar). Insulin-stimulated Ser302 phosphorylation is reduced when glucose/amino acids are removed from the culture medium and restored to normal when these nutrients are provided. These results reveal a potential mechanism that coordinates IRS-1-mediated insulin action with nutrient availability. Replacing Ser302 with alanine (A302IRS-1) provides the strongest evidence that Ser302 is a cornerstone of IRS-1 function. A302IRS-1 is expressed normally in cells, but it is phosphorylated poorly on tyrosine residues and interacts weakly with p85 during insulin stimulation. Previous work from our laboratory and elsewhere establishes a close relation between p85 binding to IRS-1 and activation of the PI3K. This relation is especially clear in 32D and 32DIR cells that lack endogenous IRS-proteins (19Yenush L. Zanella C. Uchida T. Bernal D. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6784-6794Google Scholar, 34Myers Jr., M.G. Zhang Y. Aldaz G.A.I. Grammer T.C. Glasheen E.M. Yenush L. Wang L.M. Sun X.J. Blenis J. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4147-4155Google Scholar, 35Rordorf-Nikolic T. Van Horn D.J. Chen D. White M.F. Backer J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3662-3666Google Scholar). Phospholipid products generated from PI3K activation activate various serine kinases, including Akt and certain atypical protein kinase C isoforms (36Duronio V. Scheid M.P. Ettinger S. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 233-239Google Scholar). Akt plays an important role in insulin action as it phosphorylates GSK-3β, the antiapoptotic protein BAD, the forkhead transcription factor Foxo1, and other targets (37Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Google Scholar, 38Plas D.R. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12361-12366Google Scholar). In 32D or 32DIR cells, expression of recombinant IRS-1 is a prerequisite for activation of Akt by insulin (19Yenush L. Zanella C. Uchida T. Bernal D. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6784-6794Google Scholar). However, expression of IRS-1 rather than its ability to activate PI3K might be the critical step in Akt activation in 32D cells. Here we show that A302IRS-1 barely binds to p85, whereas it mediates insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and the activation of the Akt/GSK-3β cascade normally. This result is consistent with early findings that a truncated IRS-1 protein composed of residues 1–309 failed to promote PI3K activity whereas activating Akt during insulin stimulation (19Yenush L. Zanella C. Uchida T. Bernal D. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6784-6794Google Scholar). Moreover, similar conclusions have emerged during that study of various models of insulin resistance, where PI3K is poorly activated whereas Akt is activated normally (39Kim Y.B. Zhu J.S. Zierath J.R. Shen H.Q. Baron A.D. Kahn B.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 310-320Google Scholar, 40Nadler S.T. Stoehr J.P. Rabaglia M.E. Schueler K.L. Birnbaum M.J. Attie A.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: E1249-E1254Google Scholar). Insulin/IGF signaling plays an important role in somatic growth, and disruption of IRS-1 results in mice that reach 50% or their expected size (41Araki E. Lipes M.A. Patti M.E. Bruning J.C. Haag III, B. Johnson R.S. Kahn C.R. Nature. 1994; 372: 186-190Google Scholar). Body growth depends upon mitogenesis and protein synthesis. Translational control by amino acid-dependent signaling appears to be integrated with the insulin stimulated PI3K signaling through the activation of TOR, the target of rapamycin (17Mendez R. Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Rhoads R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2857-2864Google Scholar, 26Nojima H. Tokunaga C. Eguchi S. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Yoshino K. Hara K. Tanaka N. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15461-15464Google Scholar). Like Akt activation, the expression of IRS-1 is absolutely required for insulin stimulation of the p70S6K/S6 pathway and inactivation of 4E-BP1; however, in this case the activation of PI3K is essential (17Mendez R. Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Rhoads R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2857-2864Google Scholar, 34Myers Jr., M.G. Zhang Y. Aldaz G.A.I. Grammer T.C. Glasheen E.M. Yenush L. Wang L.M. Sun X.J. Blenis J. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4147-4155Google Scholar). Unlike our results with the Akt/GSK-3β cascade, A302IRS-1 fails to mediate the insulin stimulation of the p70S6K/S6 pathway and phosphorylation of 4E-BP1. The truncated IRS-1-protein composed of residues 1–309 also fails to mediate p70S6K activation, consistent with its inability to bind p85 (19Yenush L. Zanella C. Uchida T. Bernal D. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6784-6794Google Scholar). Moreover, a mutant IRS-1 molecule lacking 18 tyrosine phosphorylation sites (F18IRS-1) fails to bind p85 and activate PI3K and does not mediate insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (17Mendez R. Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Rhoads R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2857-2864Google Scholar, 34Myers Jr., M.G. Zhang Y. Aldaz G.A.I. Grammer T.C. Glasheen E.M. Yenush L. Wang L.M. Sun X.J. Blenis J. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4147-4155Google Scholar). Thus, Ser302 is a specificity determinant in the IRS-1 branch of the insulin/IGF signaling cascades which can control various aspects of the signal. Replacing Ser302 with alanine causes a significant inhibition of insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Because Ser302 has a positive role in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, its replacement by alanine fails to establish whether this residue is functionally important in the phosphorylated or unphosphorylated state. However, the finding that inhibition of Ser302 phosphorylation by short term amino acid/glucose starvation also correlates with a decrease in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, without inhibition of insulin receptor autophosphorylation or Akt phosphorylation, supports the conclusion that Ser302 phosphorylation might be important 2J. Giraud, R. L. Leshan, Y. H. Lee, and M. F. White, unpublished observations. (25Hara K. Yonezawa K. Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M.T. Belham C. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14484-14494Google Scholar). We do not know the mechanism by which Ser302 phosphorylation has this effect. Ser302 phosphorylation might stabilize the interaction between the phosphotyrosine binding domain of IRS-1 and the juxtamembrane region of the insulin receptor, which is expected to promote tyrosine phosphorylation. However, Ser302 phosphorylation might inhibit the recruitment of phosphotyrosine phosphatases or inhibit interactions with serine/threonine kinases that phosphorylate negative regulatory sites. Because the IRS-1-branch of the insulin/IGF signaling cascade plays an important role in protein synthesis, phosphorylation of Ser302 might serve to attenuate insulin action when nutrients are in short supply (17Mendez R. Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Rhoads R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2857-2864Google Scholar). Regulation of IRS-protein levels and function is an important component of the insulin/IGF response in various tissues (43Howlett K.F. Sakamoto K. Hirshman M.F. Aschenbach W.G. Dow M. White M.F. Goodyear L.J. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 479-483Google Scholar, 44Kushner J.A. Ye J. Schubert M. Burks D.J. Dow M.A. Flint C.L. Dutta S. Wright C.V. Montminy M.R. White M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1193-1201Google Scholar). Several mechanisms controlling IRS-protein levels have been investigated, including regulation of IRS-2 gene expression by cAMP-responsive element-binding protein, or proteasome-mediated degradation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 (22Sun X.J. Goldberg J.L. Qiao L.Y. Mitchell J.J. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1359-1364Google Scholar, 45Jhala U.S. Canettieri G. Screaton R.A. Kulkarni R.N. Krajewski S. Reed J. Walker J. Lin X. White M.F. Montminy M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1575-1580Google Scholar, 46Rui L. Yuan M. Frantz D. Shoelson S. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42394-42398Google Scholar). Regulation of IRS-protein function by serine/threonine phosphorylation mediated by heterologous kinases is also an important control mechanism (47Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budvari A. Ellis R.W. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Google Scholar). Most studies suggest that serine/threonine phosphorylation inhibits insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation (9De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31400-31406Google Scholar, 48Qiao L.-y. Zhande R. Jetton T.L. Zhou G. Sun X.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26530-26539Google Scholar, 50De Fea K. Roth R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12939-12947Google Scholar). However, IRS-proteins contain more than 20 potential serine/threonine phosphorylation sites, and some of these sites are reported to promote tyrosine phosphorylation (51Paz K. Liu Y.F. Shorer H. Hemi R. LeRoith D. Quan M. Kanety H. Seger R. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28816-28822Google Scholar, 52Jakobsen S.N. Hardie D.G. Morrice N. Tornqvist H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46912-46916Google Scholar). In addition to Ser302 reported here, Ser789 in IRS-1 is phosphorylated by the AMP kinase. Phosphorylation of Ser789 is reported to increase insulin signaling (52Jakobsen S.N. Hardie D.G. Morrice N. Tornqvist H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46912-46916Google Scholar). Our previous work focused on the phosphorylation of Ser307 in rat/mouse IRS-1 (Ser312 in human IRS-1), which is located near Ser302 (14Aguirre V. Werner E.D. Giraud J. Lee Y.H. Shoelson S.E. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1531-1537Google Scholar, 15Lee Y.H. Giraud J. Davis R.J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2896-2902Google Scholar). Both Ser302 and Ser307 are phosphorylated during insulin stimulation. Replacing Ser307 with alanine increases insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser307 blocks insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphotyrosine binding domain function (14Aguirre V. Werner E.D. Giraud J. Lee Y.H. Shoelson S.E. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1531-1537Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser307 inhibits insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which is reversed by mutation of Ser307 to alanine (15Lee Y.H. Giraud J. Davis R.J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2896-2902Google Scholar). Both Ser302 and Ser307 are phosphorylated by kinases that associate with IRS-1 during immunoprecipitation. At least two kinases promote Ser307 phosphorylation, including the JNK, which associates with IRS-1 at a well defined COOH-terminal binding site (15Lee Y.H. Giraud J. Davis R.J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2896-2902Google Scholar). Mutation of the JNK binding site or disruption of JNK1/2 significantly inhibits insulin-stimulated Ser307 phosphorylation (15Lee Y.H. Giraud J. Davis R.J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2896-2902Google Scholar, 53Hirosumi J. Tuncman G. Chang L. Gorgun C.Z. Uysal K.T. Maeda K. Karin M. Hotamisligil G.S. Nature. 2002; 420: 333-336Google Scholar). However, mutation of the JNK binding site in IRS-1 or disruption of JNK isoforms does not reduce insulin-stimulated Ser302 phosphorylation, suggesting that Ser302 is not a JNK phosphorylation site. These results reveal the striking site-specific phosphorylation that occurs in IRS-1. The Ser302 kinase is unknown; however, inhibition of Ser302 phosphorylation by wortmannin or rapamycin, and by short term amino acid/glucose starvation, implicates the PI3K/mTOR cascade. However, Ser302 is probably not directly phosphorylated by mTOR, because the serine phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid promotes Ser302 phosphorylation in a rapamycin-insensitive manner. Insulin signaling through mTOR has been shown to inhibit protein phosphatase 2A activity, which might contribute to Ser302 phosphorylation (42Hartley D. Cooper G.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 85: 304-314Google Scholar). However, inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A might be a nonspecific mechanism that would lead to increased phosphorylation of many serine residues in IRS-1. The PI3K/mTOR/S6K pathway promotes cell growth and proliferation in cell-based experiment and in adult mouse tissues (30Volarevic S. Stewart M.J. Ledermann B. Zilberman F. Terracciano L. Montini E. Grompe M. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Science. 2000; 288: 2045-2047Google Scholar, 49Zhang H. Stallock J.P. Ng J.C. Reinhard C. Neufeld T.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2712-2724Google Scholar). Deletion of p70S6K or ribosomal protein S6 in embryonic stem cells or mice reduces the rate of cell proliferation (31Kawasome H. Papst P. Webb S. Keller G.M. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. Terada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5033-5038Google Scholar). Consistent with those data, we observed a decrease in insulin/IGF-I-stimulated cell proliferation in 32D cells expressing the Ser302 to Ala mutation. The decrease in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and down-regulation of the PI3K/mTOR/S6K pathway is likely responsible for this defect in cell proliferation. Reduction in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation because of mutation of Ser302 to Ala might partially diminish the transduction of growth signals from IRS-1 to the PI3K/mTOR/S6K pathway, which reduces cell proliferation. In summary, we showed that insulin/IGF-I stimulates Ser302 phosphorylation of rat IRS-1 through activation of an mTOR-dependent pathway. Ser302 phosphorylation of IRS-1 appears to play a permissive role in insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and signal transduction. This result is important because a defect in a positive regulatory IRS-1 Ser/Thr kinase may be another mechanism contributing to insulin resistance. Future studies will reveal the mechanism(s) by which Ser302 phosphorylation promotes IRS-1 function and at identifying additional phospho Ser/Thr residues that regulate IRS-1. The effects of Ser/Thr phosphorylation on IRS-1 signaling are likely to be of critical importance to our full understanding of insulin action and insulin resistance.

To understand better the role of STAT1 in the interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-induced phenotype, we generated an active form of STAT1 (STAT1C) by substituting Cys residues for both Arg-656 and Asn-658 within the C-terminal loop of the STAT1 SH2 domain. The IFN-γ activation site element was stimulated and bound efficiently by STAT1C without IFN-γ treatment. STAT1C was found to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in the nucleus for more than 30 h after IFN-γ stimulation. STAT1-negative U3A cells reexpressing STAT1C showed retarded cell growth and underwent apoptosis when treated with IFN-γ. Further analysis demonstrated that apoptosis was preceded by proteolytic cleavage of caspases 2, 3, and 7, and wild type STAT1 also induced cleavage of caspase 7 when expressed in STAT1-negative U3A cells, indicating that STAT1C augments potential activity of wild type STAT1. Studies with cycloheximide treatment showed that protein synthesis induced in the first 24 h after IFN-γ treatment was required for apoptosis under these conditions. Finally, we found that STAT1C-induced apoptosis was, in part, mediated by caspase 2, 3, and 7 because benzyloxycarbonyl-valyl-aspartyl-valyl-alanyl-aspartic acid fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VDVAD-FMK) treatment partially blocked apoptosis. These results suggest that prolonged nuclear localization of activated STAT1 results in apoptosis involving specific regulation of caspase pathway.

In response to IFN-γ stimulation, STAT1 becomes phosphorylated on Tyr-701 and forms a homodimer through reciprocal SH2-phosphotyrosine interactions. Phosphorylation on Tyr-701 is required for subsequent nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and gene activation (15Darnell Jr., J.E.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 is regulated both by Jak1/Jak2 protein-tyrosine kinases and by protein-tyrosine phosphatase.

STAT1 has been implicated in apoptosis in response to IFN-γ stimulation. Mutant forms of STAT1 lacking the N-terminal 62 amino acid residues or carrying a single amino acid substitution of Ala-31 for Arg-31 inhibited STAT1 tyrosine dephosphorylation and greatly enhanced the antiproliferative activity of IFN-γ when expressed in fibroblasts (28Shuai K. Liao J. Song M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4932-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that constitutive expression of caspases 1, 2, and 3 requires STAT1 without IFN-γ stimulation and that STAT1-negative U3A cells reexpressing wild type and Y701F mutant forms of STAT1 restored apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-α plus actinomycin D treatment (9Chin Y.E.

Science. 1997; 278: 1630-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Although these results demonstrate that STAT1 is involved in negative regulation of cell growth, the mechanism of apoptosis induced by the IFN-γ/STAT1 pathway has not fully been described. To dissect the role of STAT1 in the IFN-γ-induced phenotype, we generated an active form of STAT1 (STAT1C) by introducing Cys residues into Arg-656 and Asn-658 within the C-terminal loop of the STAT1 SH2 domain. Cysteine residues have been used successfully to induce dimerization in several signaling molecules, including Eyk, erythropoietin, c-Mpl, and ion channel proteins (30Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Dunn A.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5569-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 31Watowich S.S. Hilton D.J. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell.

In particular, an engineered STAT3 protein carrying equivalent Cys mutations has been demonstrated to activate transcription and induce cell transformation without cytokine stimulation (34Bromberg J.F.

Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar), suggesting that STAT1C may enhance a potential activity of STAT1. Here we report that STAT1C alone can stimulate a promoter construct containing the GAS element. IFN-γ treatment induced prolonged nuclear localization of STAT1C for more than 30 h, leading to apoptosis. Inhibition of caspases 2, 3, and 7 partially blocked apoptosis, suggesting that these caspases are, at least in part, involved in this pathway. More importantly, cleavage of caspase 3 and 7 was observed in cells expressing endogenous wild type STAT1 when treated with IFN-γ, demonstrating that STAT1C augments potential activity of STAT1. These results suggest a novel mechanism of apoptosis mediated by STAT1 involving specific cleavage of caspase. Cell Lines, Transfection, and Luciferase Measurements—2fTGH (35Pellegrini S. John J. Shearer M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4605-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), U3A (36McKendry R. John J. Flavell D. Muller M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

G8 cells (37Muller M. Laxton C. Briscoe J. Schindler C. Improta T. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4221-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) were grown in the same medium to which 100 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) had been added. IFN-γ was purchased from PeproTech, Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). Transfections were made with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Luciferase assay basic procedures have been described (38Ouchi T. Monteiro A.N. August A. Aaronson S.A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2302-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). For each cell culture, 1 μg of M67luc with STAT1wt, STAT1C, or empty vector was transfected. Cells were treated with IFN-γ for 6 h before luciferase assay. β-Galactosidase activity was measured as an internal control by cotransfection of pcDNA3.1/His/LacZ (Invitrogen). Values shown represent a normalized average of three or four independent transfections. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in EBC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaF, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Protein concentration in cell lysates was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. An equal amount of protein (20 or 100 μg for caspase assay) for each sample was separated by 7.5–10 or 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk or 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and sequentially incubated with primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratories) followed by ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies—Antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal antibodies for STAT1 p84/p91 (E-23), IRF1 (C-20), mouse monoclonal antibody for α-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-STAT1 (Tyr-701) and anti-cleaved caspase 3 (Asp-175) (Cell Signaling Technology); and rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-caspase 1 (Ab-1), caspase 2 (Ab-1), cleaved caspase 3 (Ab-1), caspase 6 (Ab-2), caspase 7 (Ab-1) (Oncogene Research Products). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Total lysates or nuclear extracts were prepared from various type of cells both untreated and treated with IFN-γ for various time periods, as described previously (39Lassar A.B.

Synthetic double strand oligonucleotide M67, 5′-CATTTCCCGTAAATCAT-3′, was end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Extracts were incubated with the labeled probe in the presence of poly(dI-dC) in a binding buffer containing 20 mm HEPES at room temperature for 30 min. For the competition assay, 2–10 ng of unlabeled probe or 1–5 μg of the indicated antibodies was added to the incubation mix. After resolving the DNA-protein complex in a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. Plasmid Constructs—STAT1wt FLAG-tagged in pcDNA3.1 was a gift from Dr. C. Horvath. The STAT1-C construct was made using site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene) with primer pairs 5′-AATTACAAAGTCATGGCTTGTGAGTGTATTCCTGAGAATCCC-3′. The construct was then transferred to a pRc/CMV vector (Invitrogen) and the cytomegalovirus promoter was replaced by EF1α promoter from pEF vector (Invitrogen). Apoptosis Assay—Annexin V and propidium iodine staining was performed as described by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). After flow cytometry, cells were divided into four distinct populations using the control cells as a reference; the lower left quadrant of the dot plot represented viable cells, and the lower and upper right quadrants represented cells early and late in apoptosis, respectively. The cells in each quadrant were then gated, and the percentage of the total population was determined using CellQuest™ (BD Biosciences) software. Generate Active Form of STAT1—It has been shown that the introduction of two Cys residues into Ala-662 and Asn-664 in the STAT3 SH2 domain produces a constitutively active form of STAT3 (34Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). We generated a mutant STAT1 (STAT1C) by introducing Cys residues into Ala-656 and Asn-658 in the SH2 domain, which are equivalent to Ala-662 and Asn-664 of STAT3 (Fig. 1 A). Transcription activity of STAT1C was examined in the presence or absence of IFN-γ using an M67luc reporter construct containing four copies of STAT1 binding sites upstream of the luciferase gene (41Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 42Deberry C. Mou S. Linnekin D. Biochem.

STAT1-positive 2fTGH cells and STAT1-negative U3A cells (36McKendry R. John J. Flavell D. Muller M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11455-11459Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 37Muller M. Laxton C. Briscoe J. Schindler C. Improta T. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M.

Biol. 1991; 11: 4189-4195Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) were transfected with an empty, STAT1-, or STAT1C-expressing vector together with M67luc for 40 h and stimulated further by 20 ng/ml IFN-γ for 6 h before measuring luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 1B, STAT1 activated the reporter 46-fold after IFN-γ treatment in U3A cells; an empty vector alone did not increase the activity because of a loss of endogenous STAT1 expression. Significantly, STAT1C alone activated the reporter plasmid 80-fold, and IFN-γ treatment further enhanced the activity up to 147-fold. In STAT1-positive 2fTGH cells, luciferase activity was increased 2.5-fold when vector alone was transfected, and transfection of STAT1 enhanced the activity 27-fold when treated with IFN-γ. As shown in U3A cells, STAT1C alone activated the reporter plasmid 48-fold, an outcome enhanced by IFN-γ treatment up to 88-fold. These results suggest that STAT1C alone can potentially activate a promoter containing STAT1 binding sites and that this activity is strongly enhanced by IFN-γ stimulation. STAT1C Shows Increased Tyrosine Phosphorylation—U3A cells were stably transfected with STAT1C, which has the FLAG tag at the C terminus, and G418-resistant clones were isolated for further analysis. Among the clones obtained, 1CC and 1C5 clones were found to express similar levels of STAT1 protein with G8 cells generated by stably expressing STAT1α in U3A cells (37Muller M. Laxton C. Briscoe J. Schindler C. Improta T. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4221-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). It has been shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 Tyr-701 is essential for dimerization, nuclear translocation and DNA binding ability. To understand how Tyr-701 phosphorylation is involved in the strong transactivation activity of STAT1C, we examined the phosphorylation status of Tyr-701 and the induction of IRF1, a well characterized IFN-γ target gene, with or without treatment with the kinase inhibitor genistein, which is frequently used for the inhibition of tyrosine kinases. 100 μm genistein was added to the cell culture 30 min after IFN-γ stimulation, and nuclear extracts were prepared for immunoblot analysis at 30 min, 1 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 30 h after IFN-γ stimulation. The expression level of nuclear transcription factor Sp1 was unchanged, and it is shown as a loading control in Fig. 2. Although significant change in the nuclear STAT1 protein level was not observed in G8 cells, Tyr-701 phosphorylation was transiently induced (30 min) in these cells. Nuclear localization and Tyr-701 phosphorylation of STAT1 were undetectable in IFN-γ-stimulated G8 cells when treated with genistein, serving as a positive control of Jak kinase inhibition by genistein. These results are consistent with the previous finding that Tyr-701 phosphorylation is required for nuclear localization of STAT1 (15Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar, 16Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar, 17Shuai K. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 405-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Interestingly, IRF1 was also induced in the presence of genistein in G8 cells, although induction was slightly weaker than untreated G8 cells. These results suggest that low levels of nuclear STAT1 are sufficient for induction of IRF1. In 1CC and 1C5 cells, STAT1C was more nuclear than in G8 even in the presence of genistein. Although Tyr-701 phosphorylation was slightly decreased by genistein in both 1CC and 1C5 cells, it was significantly sustained for 30 h after IFN-γ stimulation even with genistein treatment, implying that prolonged STAT1C phosphorylation is a consequence not of kinase hyperactivation but of a decreased dephosphorylation rate. Consistent with the enhanced phosphorylation in Tyr-701, a remarkable induction of IRF1 was sustained for 30 h in 1CC and 1C5 cells after IFN-γ stimulation. Interestingly, high expression of IRF1 was also detected in genistein-treated cells. These results suggest that IFN-γ-induced Tyr-701 phosphorylation is protected from nuclear phosphatase activity by the reinforced interaction of the SH2 domain through the Cys-Cys bond. Increased DNA Binding Ability of STAT1C—Next, DNA binding activity of STAT1C protein was studied using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 3A). Normally growing 2fTGH, G8, and 1CC cells were treated with IFN-γ for 15, 30, and 120 min, and cell extracts were subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a 32P-labeled STAT1-binding DNA element as a probe (41Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Wild type STAT1 showed increased DNA binding after 15 min of treatment which gradually decreased in 120 min. The basal DNA binding ability of STAT1C was higher than that of wild type (lanes 1, 5, and 9) and was remarkably increased and sustained for more than 120 min after IFN-γ stimulation (lanes 10–12). Specific binding of STAT1 and STAT1C to the probe was confirmed by a competition assay using an unlabeled DNA probe (Fig. 3B). Cell extracts were prepared from unstimulated or stimulated (15 min) cells, and an excess amount of unlabeled DNA probe was added to the extracts. Consistent with the results in Fig. 3A, STAT1C was found to bind DNA more efficiently than wild type STAT1 without IFN-γ treatment (lanes 1, 7, and 13). Strong DNA binding ability of STAT1C was induced in 15 min, and it disappeared after administration of an excess DNA probe, confirming that STAT1C specifically recognizes the GAS element. Specific binding of STAT1C to GAS element was confirmed further with antibodies recognizing STAT1C in gel shift assay (Fig. 3C). In 2fTGH cells, STAT1 binding to GAS element (lane 2) was supershifted with anti-STAT1 antibody (lanes 3 and 5) but not affected with anti-FLAG antibody (lanes 4 and 5). Enhanced DNA binding of STAT1C (lane 11) was supershifted with antibodies for FLAG, STAT1, or both (lanes 12–14) because STAT1C is FLAG-tagged at the C terminus. Consistent with results in Fig. 3B, DNA-binding signals were completed with excess M67 probe, not with unrelated cold probe (lanes 6–9 and 15–18). These results demonstrate that STAT1C contains a DNA binding ability similar to that of wild type STAT1, but it is further enhanced by IFN-γ treatment. STAT1C Shows Antiproliferative Activity—We studied the biological activity of STAT1C on cell growth by comparing its effects with those of wild type STAT1. Exponentially growing 2fTGH, U3A, G8, 1CC, and 1C5 cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells/6-cm plate. After 24 h, IFN-γ (20 ng/ml) was added to the medium, and the cells were counted at different times during a 5-day interval (Fig. 4A). No significant differences in growth rate were observed between untreated (solid line) or IFN-γ-treated 2fTGH, U3A, or G8 cells (dotted line). In contrast, 1CC and 1C5 cells showed striking growth retardation 24–30 h after stimulation compared with untreated 1CC and 1C5 cells. This growth retardation was also observed when a lower concentration of IFN-γ was used (5 ng/ml, data not shown). Cell morphology was analyzed by phase-contrast microscopy of 2fTGH, U3A, G8, 1CC, and 1C5 cells treated with IFN-γ for 48 h (Fig. 4B). Each cell line showed indistinguishable morphology before treatment (a–e), but 1CC and 1C5 cells detached from the plate after 48 h of IFN-γ treatment and showed condensed nuclei, characteristic of cultured cells undergoing apoptosis (i and j). Although previous studies demonstrated that 2fTGH and STAT1-reconstituted U3A cells show the apoptosis phenotype in 72 h after IFN-γ treatment (9Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Fu X.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5328-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), 2fTGH, U3A, and G8 cells did not show apoptosis after the same treatment within 48 h in our experiments. These results suggest that enhanced STAT1 activity results in cell death after IFN-γ treatment. STAT1C Sensitizes Cells to Apoptosis by IFN-γ—We further quantified apoptosis of STAT1C cells induced by IFN-γ treatment. 2fTGH, U3A, G8, 1CC, and 1C5 cells were plated at 2 × 106 cells/10-cm plate, respectively. After 24 h, cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml IFN-γ for 48 h. Collected cells were then stained with propidium iodide and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V, a marker of an early stage of apoptosis, and were analyzed by means of fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Fig. 5A). Apoptosis of 2fTGH, U3A, or G8 cells did not an increase by 48 h of IFN-γ treatment. STAT1C-expressing 1CC and 1C5 cells showed slightly high levels of apoptosis without IFN-γ treatment (11 and 13%, respectively), but increased cell death was observed at 24–48 h after IFN-γ treatment (33 and 43% at 48 h, respectively). As a positive control of apoptosis, hydroxyperoxide treatment of 1CC and 1C5 cells resulted in 66 and 69% frequency of apoptosis, respectively, in 24 h. These results confirm that STAT1C can sensitize cells to IFN-γ-induced apoptosis. We next tested whether de novo protein synthesis is required for apoptosis by using the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). CHX was added to the 1CC cell cultures at 6, 12, and 24 h after IFN-γ stimulation (Fig. 5B, top). At 48 h after IFN-γ stimulation, cells were collected and divided into two aliquots, one for fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis and the other for immunoblot of STAT1 and α-tubulin. When CHX was added to the cell culture after 0–6 h of IFN-γ treatment, 1CC cells did not show apoptosis (Fig. 5B, panels 1 and 2). However, when cells were exposed to IFN-γ for 24 h, CHX did not prevent the cells from undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 5B, panels 3 and 4). Treatment with CHX alone resulted in the intermediate rate of apoptosis only at 48 h (35%, Fig. 5B, panel 6). To avoid the possibility that this inhibition of apoptosis was the result of a decreased level of STAT1C as a result of CHX treatment, expression of STAT1C was confirmed by immunoblot with anti-STAT1 antibody (Fig. 5C). These results support the hypotheses that 1) STAT1C can transmit apoptosis signals; 2) apoptosis is not an immediate response to IFN-γ treatment, but it is dependent on de novo protein synthesis during the first 6–12 h after stimulation. Such protein synthesis is conceivably regulated by STAT1C. Cleavage of Caspase 2, 3, and 7 in IFN-γ-treated STAT1C Cells—Genetic studies in Caenorhabditis elegans defined an evolutionarily conserved apoptosis pathway including activation of cysteine proteases called caspases. Once activated, these proteases cleave specific intracellular substrates, leading to cell death. We sought to determine whether specific activation of caspases is involved in IFN-γ-induced apoptosis of 1CC and 1C5 cells. 2fTGH, U3A, G8, 1CC, and 1C5 cells were treated with IFN-γ for 24 or 48 h. Total cell lysates were studied by immunoblot analysis using anti-caspase 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 antibodies that recognize the full-length and/or cleaved forms of caspases (Fig. 6A). A strong increase in caspase 1 protein was observed in IFN-γ-treated 1CC and 1C5 cells, although previous studies had showed that the mRNA level of caspase 1 is increased in a STAT1-dependent manner in response to IFN-γ stimulation (9Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Fu X.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5328-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Cleaved forms of caspases 2, 3, and 7 were specifically detected in 1CC and 1C5 cells from 24 to 48 h of IFN-γ treatment, whereas no cleaved forms of caspases 1 and 6 were detected in 2fTGH, U3A, G8, 1CC, or 1C5 cells. To rule out the possibility that this caspase activation and apoptosis are induced only in STAT1C cells, we studied also HeLa cells expressing wild type STAT1, because it has been reported that IFN-γ treatment can induce caspase 1 expression and apoptosis particularly maintained in 1% serum medium (9Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Fu X.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5328-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6B, IFN-γ treatment induced full-length caspase 1 in 1% serum and caspase 3 in both 10 and 1% serum medium when HeLa cells were treated with IFN-γ for 72 h. Significantly, cleaved forms of both caspase 3 and 7 were also immunodetected in IFN-γ-treated HeLa cells. IRF1 induction showed that the IFN-γ pathway is intact in HeLa cells. We further examined whether U3A cells that are transiently transfected with an empty vector, STAT1wt (WT) or STAT1C (1C) expression vectors can activate caspase pathway when treated with IFN-γ (Fig. 6C). Induction of caspase 1 by WT and 1C and cleavage of caspase 3 by WT were not detected in this transfection assay perhaps because of low transfection efficiency, because stable transfectants of 1CC and 1C5 cells showed strong induction and cleavage of both caspases (Fig. 6A). Nevertheless, cleavage of caspase 7 was detected in transient transfection of WT, and cleavage of caspase 3 and 7 was detected in transfection of 1C. These results indicate that activation of caspase pathway by IFN-γ is not specific in STAT1C cells but is generally observed in IFN-γ-treated cells. Partial Inhibition of Apoptosis by Z-VDVAD-FMK—On the basis of the observation described above, we attempted to determine whether STAT1C-mediated apoptosis specifically involves the caspase pathway. As shown in Fig. 7, 1CC cells were grown in normal medium with IFN-γ alone and/or Z-VDVAD-FMK, which specifically inhibits caspase 2 and, to a lesser degree, caspase 3 and 7 (46Talanian R.V. Quinlan C. Trautz S. Hackett M.C. Mankovich J.A. Banach D. Ghayur T. Brady K.D. Wong W.W. J. Biol.

Cell morphology and annexin V staining were studied after 48 h. Apoptosis of 1CC cells by IFN-γ (75%) was partially inhibited by coincubation with Z-VDVAD-FMK (49%). These results demonstrate that caspase 2 and, perhaps, caspase 3 and 7 are partially involved in STAT1C-mediated apoptosis. IFN-γ inhibits cell growth and regulates apoptosis, two activities involved in suppression of cancer development and modulation of the immune response. The sensitivity of cells of different types to IFN-γ antiproliferative activity is extremely variable. For instance, IFN-γ has been shown either to promote or to inhibit the apoptosis in murine pre-B cells or B chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, respectively (48Grawunder U. Melchers F. Rolink A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 49Rojas R. Roman J. Torres A. Ramirez R. Carracedo J. Lopez R. Garcia J.M. Martin C. Pintado O.

Med. 1993; 177: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Thus, the involvement of IFN-γ in apoptosis is determined by collaboration with other modulators of apoptosis and/or the enzymes they regulate. STAT1 is a key molecule in signal transmission after IFN-γ stimulation and has been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation-associated genes. Recent investigations have demonstrated that STAT1 is essential for regulation of the constitutive mRNA level of c-myc and caspases 1, 2, and 3, suggesting that STAT1 is involved in apoptosis (29Kumar A.

Significantly, it has been shown that STAT1 has promoter selectivity through the interaction with breast cancer tumor suppressor protein BRCA1, which is frequently mutated in breast cancer patients, suggesting that the IFN-γ-induced phenotype can be determined by cytogenetic background (8Ouchi T. Lee S.W. Ouchi M. Aaronson S.A. Horvath C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5208-5213Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These results reinforce the hypothesis that when cells are stimulated with IFN-γ, STAT1 plays a crucial role in determining their fate. Artificially engineered STAT3 (STAT3C) protein carrying the Cys substitutions in the SH2 domain has provided a model of the constitutively active form of STATs, which stimulate their own targets in a cytokine-independent manner (34Bromberg J.F.

In the current studies, a similar strategy was followed to produce constitutively active STAT1 (STAT1C) for analysis of the potential activity of STAT1 in the regulation of cell proliferation. Intermolecular STAT1 homodimerization through phosphorylated Tyr-701 and the SH2 domain is required for DNA binding and transcription of the target genes upon IFN-γ simulation (15Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar, 16Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar, 17Shuai K. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 405-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We found that reporter constructs containing the high affinity STAT1 binding sequence were activated by STAT1C without IFN-γ, demonstrating that the engineered STAT1C forms a homodimer and binds DNA, consistent with our results showing that STAT1C is more nuclear than wild type STAT1 without IFN-γ. However, IFN-γ treatment further enhanced STAT1C transcription activity, indicating that the IFN-γ-induced modification of STAT1C is required to achieve maximal activity. In this context, it is likely that Ser-727 in the transactivation domain is involved in this activation because it has been shown that Ser-727 phosphorylation is crucial for the interaction with transcription coactivators, including BRCA1 and MCM5, which leads to maximal STAT1 activity (8Ouchi T. Lee S.W. Ouchi M. Aaronson S.A. Horvath C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5208-5213Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 52Zhang J.J. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. Lathem W.W. Ritzi M. Knippers R. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6963-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Further biochemical studies are needed to understand the modification of STAT1C protein after IFN-γ stimulation. Genistein treatment did not significantly change Tyr-701 phosphorylation induced by IFN-γ in 1CC and 1C5 cells, suggesting that prolonged Tyr-701 phosphorylation is not the result of the constitutive activation of tyrosine kinase(s). Recent studies indicate that tyrosine phosphatase TC45 and SHP-2 are involved in dephosphorylation of Tyr-701 (24ten Hoeve J. de Jesus Ibarra-Sanchez M. Fu Y. Zhu W. Tremblay M. David M. Shuai K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5662-5668Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 53Wu T.R. Hong Y.K. Wang X.-D. Ling M.Y. Dragoi A.M. Chung A.S. Campbell A.G. Han Z.-Y. Feng G.-S. Chin Y.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47572-47580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Although it is unclear that the activities of these phosphatases are regulated by STAT1C, it is possible that phosphorylated Tyr-701 is strongly protected from dephosphorylation by phosphatase through the interaction with the SH2 domain, which is intensified by the introduced Cys-Cys bond. Our present results support the hypothesis that sustained nuclear localization of the active form of STAT1 is crucial for IFN-γ-induced apoptosis. Our results using CHX to inhibit IFN-γ-induced protein synthesis revealed that de novo protein synthesis in the first 12 h after IFN-γ stimulation is necessary for apoptosis. These results suggest at least two possible mechanisms: 1) STAT1C continuously produces a proapoptotic protein(s) during the first 12 h, or 2) STAT1C target protein subsequently induces the secondary target genes responsible for apoptosis. Our current studies did not identify the mechanisms of how STAT1C directly or indirectly induces apoptosis. Further investigation is required to identify the gene(s) mediating apoptosis of STAT1C cells. Although our results demonstrate that STAT1C induces cleavage of specific sets of caspases, a detailed mechanism of caspase activation is largely unclear. It has been shown previously that IFN-γ can potentially suppress Bcl-xL promoter in STAT1-dependent manner (54Stephanou A. Brar B.K. Knight R.A. Latchman D.S. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 329-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and our preliminary results show that Bcl-xL protein is decreased in STAT1C cells in response to IFN-γ treatment. 2J. J. Sironi and T. Ouchi, in preparation. Given that the cytochrome c level is regulated by balanced expression of Bcl-2 family of proteins (55Ranger A.M. Malynn B.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), it is possible that decreased level of Bcl-xL results in activation of cytochrome c-Apaf/caspase 9 pathway, leading to caspase 3 cleavage. Our results demonstrate that IFN-γ- and wild type STAT1-dependent cleavage of caspase and apoptosis were confirmed in HeLa cells and U3A cells that are transiently transfected with wild type STAT1. These studies indicate that STAT1C enhances potential activities of wild type STAT1, cleavage of caspase, and subsequent apoptosis upon IFN-γ stimulation. These studies provide a model in which STAT1 activity is critical in determining the balance between cell survival and apoptosis, and enhanced STAT1 activity tips the balance toward apoptosis through activation of the caspase pathway.

This is achieved through the stimulation of transducin GTPase activity by the complex of the ninth member of the regulator of G protein signaling protein family (RGS9) with type 5 G protein β subunit (Gβ5). RGS9·Gβ5 is anchored to photoreceptor disc membranes by the transmembrane protein, R9AP. In this study, we analyzed visual signaling in the rods of R9AP knockout mice. We found that light responses from R9AP knockout rods were very slow to recover and were indistinguishable from those of RGS9 or Gβ5 knockout rods. This effect was a consequence of the complete absence of any detectable RGS9 from the retinas of R9AP knockout mice. On the other hand, the level of RGS9 mRNA was not affected by the knockout. These data indicate that in photoreceptors R9AP determines the stability of the RGS9·Gβ5 complex, and therefore all three proteins, RGS9, Gβ5, and R9AP, are obligate members of the regulatory complex that speeds the rate at which transducin hydrolyzes GTP.

Timely termination of the light response in retinal photoreceptors is essential for normal vision (reviewed in Refs. 1.Burns M.E. Baylor D.A. Annu. Rev.

On the molecular level, the normal time course of the light response requires rapid deactivation of the G protein transducin, which relays the visual signal to the effector, cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase. Deactivation of transducin occurs when the transducin α subunit hydrolyzes its bound GTP. In normal rods, GTP hydrolysis is catalyzed by the complex of the regulator of G protein signaling protein (RGS9) 1The abbreviations used are: RGS9, regulator of G protein signaling protein; Gβ5, type 5 G protein β subunit; R9AP, RGS9 anchor protein; DEP, disheveled/Egl-10/pleckstrin. with type 5 G protein β subunit (Gβ5) (reviewed in Refs. 2.Arshavsky V.Y.

Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6965-6971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In photoreceptors, the RGS9·Gβ5 complex is tightly associated with the transmembrane protein R9AP (RGS9 anchor protein), which anchors RGS9·Gβ5 on the surface of the disc membranes of the outer segment, which is the subcellular compartment where visual transduction occurs (6.Hu G.

R9AP is a 25-kDa protein structurally related to members of the SNARE (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) protein family, which are involved in vesicular trafficking and exocytosis (8.Hu G. Zhang Z. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14550-14554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 9.Keresztes G. Mutai H. Hibino H. Hudspeth A.J. Heller S. Mol. Cell.

Lem J. Heller S. Burns M.E. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10175-10181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, R9AP is expressed predominantly in the retina (6.Hu G. Wensel T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9755-9760Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 9.Keresztes G. Mutai H. Hibino H. Hudspeth A.J. Heller S. Mol. Cell.

R9AP dramatically enhances the ability of RGS9·Gβ5 to stimulate transducin GTPase (7.Lishko P.V. Martemyanov K.A. Hopp J.A. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol.

In this study, we analyzed visual signaling in rods of R9AP knockout mice. The knockout did not affect the overall retinal morphology or photoreceptor development. However, light responses from R9AP knockout rods were very slow to recover and were indistinguishable from those of RGS9 or Gβ5 knockout rods. The effect of the R9AP knockout on the photoresponse recovery was explained by a complete absence of any detectable RGS9 in the retinas of knockout mice. On the other hand, the level of RGS9 mRNA was not affected by the knockout. These data indicate that in photoreceptors R9AP determines the stability of RGS9·Gβ5, and therefore R9AP should be considered an essential component of the GTPase-activating complex for transducin. Generation of the R9AP Knockout Mouse—Primers specific for the coding region of the mouse R9AP gene, Rgs9–1bp, (forward, 5′-GCGCGGCTCGTCTTGGAGAC-3′; reverse, 5′-CAGAGGTTTCAGAGCCTGGTTCC-3′) were used for PCR screen of a 129/SvJ mouse bacterial artificial chromosome genomic library (Genome Systems, St. Louis, MO) for a clone containing the complete Rgs9–1bp gene with the flanking sequences. The targeting vector contained 2 kb of PCR-amplified genomic sequence directly upstream of the Rgs9–1bp start codon followed by a 6.1-kb cassette containing the tau-lacZ reporter gene and the neomycin resistance gene, which are flanked by lox sites, and a 2.8-kb genomic sequence directly downstream of the stop codon of the gene. The vector was used to transfect E14 embryonic stem cells (11.Hooper M. Hardy K. Handyside A. Hunter S. Monk M. Nature. 1987; 326: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). The targeting of the Rgs9–1bp locus was confirmed by screening genomic the DraI-digested DNA of G418-resistant embryonic stem cell clones for homologous recombination using a Southern probe specific to sequence outside of the targeted region (Fig. 1A). After germ line transmission was obtained, animals heterozygous for the targeted allele were crossed to create R9AP knockout animals. Analysis was performed in mice that showed 100% penetrance of the retinal phenotypes described in a mixed (129/SvJ x C57BL/6) background. Southern Blot Analysis—Genomic DNA was extracted from mouse tails, and 10 μg of DNA was digested overnight with DraI, electrophoretically fractionated in 0.6% agarose gel, denatured, and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, AP Biotech). Hybridization was done overnight at 62 °C in hybridization solution (ExpressHyb, Clontech) including 10 μg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA. The membrane was washed twice with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 62 °C and twice with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 62 °C for 10–15 min each. Primers for generating the Southern probe were: forward, 5′-CAAAATCATTGAGCGGCACC-3′; and reverse, 5′-AGTATTGGAGAGGTCACTTG-3′. Northern Blot Analysis—Denatured total RNA was isolated from retinas with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). After separation on 0.8% formaldehyde-agarose gels, RNA was transferred to nylon membrane (Hybond-N, AP Biotech) and incubated at 60 °C with RGS9-specific probe in hybridization solution (ExpressHyb, Clontech). The probe was generated by PCR amplification of the 1–1300 region of the RGS9 gene and labeled with 32P by random priming. After the membranes were washed with 0.1% SDS in 0.2× SSC at 68 °C, the blots were exposed to XAR-5 film (Eastman Kodak). Western Blot Analysis—Two mouse retinas were removed from the eyes, placed in 100 μl of deionized water, and homogenized by sonication. Rhodopsin concentration in retinal homogenates was determined spectrophotometrically from the difference in the absorption at 500 nm before and after bleaching the sample using the extinction coefficient of ϵ500 = 40500. Samples containing 20 pmol of rhodopsin were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. For protein detection, membranes were incubated with one of the following antibodies: rabbit antibody against the R9AP-(102–144) fragment (10.Martemyanov K.A. Lishko P.V. Calero N. Keresztes G. Sokolov M. Strissel K.J. Leskov I.B. Hopp J.A. Kolesnikov A.V. Chen C.-K. Lem J. Heller S. Burns M.E. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10175-10181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), sheep anti-RGS9c antibody (12.Makino E.R. Handy J.W. Li T. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1947-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), sheep anti-Gβ5 NTL antibody (12.Makino E.R. Handy J.W. Li T. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1947-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), and rabbit anti-Gαt1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, the signals were detected using the West Pico ECL Western blot detection system (Pierce). Preparation of Plastic-embedded Cross-sections of the Retina—Eyes were enucleated, cleaned of outside tissue, and fixed for 1 h in freshly prepared 2% paraformaldehyde with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer containing 2.5 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.4). The eye globe was then hemisected along the vertical meridian and allowed to fix overnight at the same buffer. The eye cup was rinsed with excess 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) and placed into 2% osmium tetroxide. The eye cup was gradually dehydrated in an increasing ethanol series (25–100%) and embedded in Epon. 1-μm cross-sections were obtained and stained with alkaline toluidine blue for light microscopy. Suction Electrode Recordings—Mice were housed in 12-h cyclic light conditions and dark-adapted overnight before an experiment. Under infrared light, animals were anesthetized and euthanized, and the retinas were removed and stored in Leibovitz's L-15 medium (Invitrogen) with 10 mm glucose and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin on ice. Small pieces of retina were placed in the recording chamber and perfused with bicarbonate-buffered Locke's solution, bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2, and warmed to 35–37 °C (pH 7.4). Responses to flashes (500 nm, 10 ms) were recorded from individual rods using suction electrodes as described (5.Krispel C.M. Chen C.K. Simon M.I. Burns M.E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6965-6971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, individual outer segments were drawn into a glass pipette containing 140 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm KCl, 2.4 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 3 mm HEPES, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4). The bath and suction electrodes were connected to calomel half-cells by agar bridges, and the bath voltage was maintained at ground potential by an active feedback circuit. The rod membrane current was amplified (Axopatch 1B, Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and filtered at 20 Hz with an 8-pole Bessel filter. Data were digitized continuously at 200 Hz using NiDAQ (National Instruments, Austin, TX) for IgorPro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Light intensities were controlled with neutral density filters and calibrated daily (United Detector Technology, Baltimore, MD). The average response to a high number (>30) of flashes was considered to be a dim flash response (linear response) if its mean amplitude was less than 20% of the maximal response amplitude. These dim flash responses were used to estimate the form of the single photon response using the “variance to mean” method as described previously (13.Mendez A. Burns M.E. Roca A. Lem J. Wu L.W. Simon M.I. Baylor D.A. Chen J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Integration time, used as a measure of the duration of the dim flash response, is defined as the time integral of the average linear response divided by its peak amplitude (14.Baylor D.A. Hodgkin A.L. J. Physiol. 1973; 234: 163-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The time that a bright flash response remained in saturation was calculated as the time interval between the midpoint of the flash and the time at which the current recovered by 10%. Generation and Characterization of the R9AP Knockout Mouse—To test the function of R9AP in mice, we induced a null mutation into the R9AP gene (Rgs9–1bp) by gene targeting (Fig. 1A). We replaced the complete gene with a reporter gene and a neomycin resistance gene by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. The targeting of the Rgs9–1bp locus was confirmed by Southern blot analysis of DraI-digested genomic DNA (Fig. 1B) and by PCR (not shown). After germ line transmission was obtained, the animals heterozygous for the targeted allele were intercrossed to generate R9AP knockout mice. Mice that were homozygously lacking Rgs9–1bp were viable and fertile and displayed no obvious behavioral abnormalities. They also had normal retinal morphology up to at least 2 months of age (Fig. 2A). The total amount of rhodopsin in their retinas was also normal (384 ± 89 pmol/retina versus 406 ± 103 pmol/retina in wild type mice; S.E., n = 2). The Absence of RGS9 from the Retinas of R9AP Knockout Mice—We analyzed the effects of the R9AP knockout on the expression of the proteins constituting the GTPase-activating complex for transducin. No detectable amount of R9AP was present in the retinas of R9AP knockout animals, consistent with targeted disruption of the R9AP locus in the genome (Fig. 2B). Strikingly, the retinas lacking R9AP also lacked any detectable amount of RGS9, and had significantly reduced levels of Gβ5. The amounts of R9AP, RGS9, and Gβ5 in the retinas of R9AP+/– heterozygous animals bearing only one functional R9AP allele were about one-half of that present in their wild type littermates. In contrast, the amount of transducin in the retinas of knockout and heterozygous animals was normal. Our data indicate that R9AP is required for the expression of RGS9 and Gβ5. This is similar to the lack of Gβ5 expression in RGS9 knockout mice (4.Chen C.K. Burns M.E. He W. Wensel T.G. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Nature. 2000; 403: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) and the reciprocal lack of RGS9 expression in Gβ5 knockouts (15.Chen C.K. Eversole-Cire P. Zhang H.K. Mancino V. Chen Y.J. He W. Wensel T.G. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6604-6609Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In both RGS9 and Gβ5 knockout mice, this regulation was not caused by a reduction of Gβ5 or RGS9 mRNA and was argued to occur on the posttranslational level. To test whether the absence of R9AP affects RGS9 expression in a similar fashion, we compared RGS9 mRNA levels in retinas of R9AP knockout mice and their wild type littermates. As shown in Fig. 2C, these mRNA levels were indeed similar. Electrophysiological Properties of the Rods from R9AP Knockout Mice—To study the effects of inactivating the R9AP gene on the electrophysiological properties of intact rods, we used suction electrodes to record rod responses to flashes of light. A representative family of responses from a R9AP knockout rod is shown in Fig. 3A. On average, R9AP knockout rods displayed normal maximal response amplitudes and normal sensitivity to light (Table I). However, the responses of R9AP knockout rods were slow to recover, similar to the responses of rods with known defects in transducin deactivation, such as those of RGS9 and Gβ5 knockout mice (4.Chen C.K. Burns M.E. He W. Wensel T.G. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Nature. 2000; 403: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 5.Krispel C.M. Chen C.K. Simon M.I. Burns M.E. J.

The average duration of the dim flash response, as measured by integration time (see “Experimental Procedures”), was on the order of 2 s (Table I). This is 10-fold slower than the integration time that has been observed for dim flash responses of wild type mouse rods but indistinguishable from the integration times measured for both RGS9 and Gβ5 knockout rods (4.Chen C.K. Burns M.E. He W. Wensel T.G. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Nature. 2000; 403: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 5.Krispel C.M. Chen C.K. Simon M.I. Burns M.E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6965-6971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recovery time constant was assessed by fitting a single exponential curve to the falling phases of the average dim flash response. The average time constant of this exponential recovery was 2.0 ± 0.5 s (Fig. 3; Table I), very similar to the time constant of recovery observed in RGS9 (2.6 ± 0.3 s, from Ref. 4.Chen C.K. Burns M.E.

It is well known that the recovery of responses of rods lacking RGS9 and Gβ5 slows further as the flash strength increases (4.Chen C.K. Burns M.E. He W. Wensel T.G. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Nature. 2000; 403: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 5.Krispel C.M. Chen C.K. Simon M.I. Burns M.E. J.

Heller S. Burns M.E. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10175-10181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). R9AP knockout rods also showed this phenomenon. For bright flashes that produce saturating responses, the dominant time constant of recovery can be determined by measuring the slope of the dependence of saturation time (Tsat) on the natural log of the flash strength (16.Pepperberg D.R. Cornwall M.C. Kahlert M. Hofmann K.P. Jin J. Jones G.J. Ripps H. Visual Neurosci. 1992; 8: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). We found that in R9AP knockout rods, the dominant time constant of recovery, τD, was 9.3 ± 0.5 s (Fig. 3C; Table I), indistinguishable from the τD values reported for both RGS9 (8.99 ± 0.22 s, from Ref. 4.Chen C.K. Burns M.E. He W. Wensel T.G. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Nature. 2000; 403: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) and Gβ5 knockout rods (8.8 ± 0.3 s, from Ref. 5.Krispel C.M. Chen C.K. Simon M.I. Burns M.E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6965-6971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The striking similarity of the R9AP knockout responses to those of the RGS9 and Gβ5 knockouts indicates that inactivating the R9AP gene has the same functional consequences as inactivating either the catalyst, RGS9, or its binding partner, Gβ5. We conclude that all three proteins, RGS9, Gβ5, and R9AP, are obligate members of the regulatory complex that speeds the rate at which transducin hydrolyzes GTP. In this study we report that knocking out the gene for R9AP results in a functional knockout of RGS9, which is evidenced by the lack of RGS9 protein in photoreceptors and abnormally slow recovery of the light response. In addition, the reduction in the R9AP protein level in the retinas of heterozygous mice causes a proportional reduction of RGS9·Gβ5. Provided that the levels of RGS9 mRNA were not affected by the R9AP knockout, the most plausible explanation for these effects is that the association of RGS9 with R9AP plays a crucial role in stabilizing the entire GTPase-activating complex and that this interaction can determine the amount of functionally active RGS9·Gβ5 in the cell. These data also suggest that all RGS9·Gβ5 in rods is present as the complex with R9AP, making it unlikely that photoreceptors contain less R9AP than RGS9 as suggested previously (6.Hu G. Wensel T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9755-9760Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In principle, one could argue that the absence of RGS9 in the knockout may be explained by a drastically reduced translation of RGS9 mRNA without R9AP. However, this is unlikely because RGS9 mRNA is efficiently translated without R9AP in several eukaryotic protein expression systems (17.He W. Lu L.S. Zhang X. El Hodiri H.M. Chen C.K. Slep K.C.

Schmidt C.J. Andrade R. Cooper J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 687-694PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the effect of the R9AP knockout on the expression level of RGS9 is not entirely reciprocal. RGS9 knockout causes only a modest reduction in the R9AP levels and does not affect the delivery of R9AP to rod outer segments (10.Martemyanov K.A. Lishko P.V. Calero N. Keresztes G. Sokolov M. Strissel K.J. Leskov I.B. Hopp J.A. Kolesnikov A.V. Chen C.-K. Lem J. Heller S. Burns M.E. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10175-10181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is also a difference in the levels of Gβ5 in R9AP and RGS9 knockouts. Although undetectable in the photoreceptors of RGS9 knockout (4.Chen C.K. Burns M.E. He W. Wensel T.G. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Nature. 2000; 403: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), an appreciable fraction of Gβ5 is present in the R9AP knockout photoreceptors (Fig. 2B). This is somewhat curious because the stability of the Gβ5 molecule is known to be dependent on its binding to the G protein γ subunit-like (GGL) domain of RGS9 (17.He W. Lu L.S. Zhang X. El Hodiri H.M. Chen C.K. Slep K.C. Simon M.I. Jamrich M. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37093-37100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 18.Skiba N.P.

One possible explanation is that in the R9AP knockout, RGS9 and Gβ5 interact with one another prior to the degradation of RGS9 and that this early interaction somehow makes Gβ5 more resistant to subsequent degradation. To the contrary, no Gβ5 is ever formed in photoreceptors of RGS9 knockout mice, perhaps because the RGS9·Gβ5 complex is never formed. Along with the results reported in our other recent study (10.Martemyanov K.A. Lishko P.V. Calero N. Keresztes G. Sokolov M. Strissel K.J. Leskov I.B. Hopp J.A. Kolesnikov A.V. Chen C.-K. Lem J. Heller S. Burns M.E. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10175-10181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our data allow us to define the part of the RGS9 molecule that is primarily responsible for targeting unanchored RGS9 for degradation. Previously, we expressed RGS9 lacking the N-terminal DEP (disheveled/Egl–10/pleckstrin) domain in the rods of RGS9 knockout mice. This RGS9 mutant was not able to interact with R9AP (see also Refs. 7.Lishko P.V. Martemyanov K.A. Hopp J.A. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24376-24381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar and 8.Hu G. Zhang Z. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14550-14554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) but was not degraded. The results of the present study suggest that the DEP domain per se plays a decisive role in the cellular fate of the RGS9 molecule. The DEP domain binding to R9AP allows RGS9 survival and delivery to the site of its function in the rod outer segment. Conversely, we suggest that the presence of exposed DEP domain lacking its R9AP partner affects RGS9 expression, most likely by leading to degradation of RGS9. Finally, the strong expression of R9AP in avian hair cells (9.Keresztes G. Mutai H. Hibino H. Hudspeth A.J. Heller S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 24: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) led us to address whether R9AP knockouts display deficiencies of the inner ear function. Our initial assessment of auditory brainstem responses and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (20.Maison S.F. Luebke A.E. Liberman M.C. Zuo J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10838-10846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) did not reveal any significant differences between the knockout and wild type littermates (data not shown). This indicates that cochlear mechanics, transduction, and synaptic transmission at low and moderate sound levels are not significantly altered by the R9AP knockout. These results are consistent with our comparative analysis of R9AP expression, which is detectable in several neural cell types of the chicken but is restricted to photoreceptors in the mouse (9.Keresztes G. Mutai H. Hibino H. Hudspeth A.J. Heller S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 24: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We are grateful to Dr. A. J. Hudspeth for supporting the initial stages of this work and Drs. P. Feinstein and C. Yang for help in generating the R9AP knockout mouse."

In the absence of RecF, replication fails to recover, and the nascent lagging strand of the arrested replication fork is extensively degraded by the RecQ helicase and RecJ nuclease. recO mutants are epistatic with recF and recR with respect to recombination and survival assays after DNA damage. In this study, we show that RecO functions with RecF and RecR to protect the nascent lagging strand of arrested replication forks after UV-irradiation. In the absence of RecO, the nascent DNA at arrested replication forks is extensively degraded and replication fails to recover. The extent of nascent DNA degradation is equivalent in single, double, or triple mutants of recF, recO, or recR, and the degradation is dependent upon RecJ and RecQ functions. Because RecF has been shown to protect the nascent lagging strand from degradation, these observations indicate that RecR and RecO function with RecF to protect the same nascent strand of the arrested replication fork and are likely to act at a common point during the recovery process.

We discuss these results in relation to the biochemical and cellular properties of RecF, RecO, and RecR and their potential role in loading RecA filaments to maintain the replication fork structure after the arrest of replication by UV-induced DNA damage. The failure to accurately replicate the genomic template in the presence of DNA damage is believed to be a primary cause of mutagenesis, genomic rearrangements, and lethality in all cells. Irradiation with near-UV (254 nm) light induces DNA lesions that block replication (1Smith K.C. Mutat. Res. 1969; 8: 481-495Google Scholar, 2Setlow R.B. Swenson P.A. Carrier W.L. Science. 1963; 142: 1464-1466Google Scholar). In wild-type Escherichia coli, replication is inhibited after a moderate dose of UV irradiation, but it efficiently recovers at a time correlating with the removal of the lesions by the nucleotide excision repair proteins (2Setlow R.B. Swenson P.A. Carrier W.L. Science. 1963; 142: 1464-1466Google Scholar, 3Setlow R.B. Carrier W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1963; 51: 226Google Scholar, 4Courcelle J. Crowley D.J. Hanawalt P.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 916-922Google Scholar). The recovery of replication in E. coli requires RecA to stabilize and maintain the integrity of replication forks after arrest by DNA lesions. Mutants lacking RecA fail to recover replication after UV-irradiation and exhibit a rapid and eventually complete degradation of the chromosome (5Courcelle J. Carswell-Crumpton C. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3714-3719Google Scholar, 6Horii Z.I. Suzuki K. Photochem. Photobiol. 1968; 8: 93-105Google Scholar). The degradation initiates at the blocked replication forks and regresses back from these points (6Horii Z.I. Suzuki K. Photochem. Photobiol. 1968; 8: 93-105Google Scholar). In vitro, RecA proteins will bind to form a filament on single-strand DNA, and they pair the singlestrand region with homologous duplex DNA (7Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Google Scholar, 8Konforti B.B. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 690-694Google Scholar, 9Cox M.M. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8523-8532Google Scholar), an activity which would be consistent with maintaining the DNA at blocked replication forks (10Kowalczykowski S.C. Dixon D.A. Eggleston A.K. Lauder S.D. Rehrauer W.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 401-465Google Scholar, 11Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Google Scholar). Similar to recA, recF, and recR mutants also fail to maintain replication forks that are blocked by DNA damage and do not recover replication (4Courcelle J. Crowley D.J. Hanawalt P.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 916-922Google Scholar, 5Courcelle J. Carswell-Crumpton C. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3714-3719Google Scholar). In contrast to recA mutants, however, the DNA degradation is less extensive and is limited to ∼50% of the nascent DNA localized at the blocked replication fork (4Courcelle J. Crowley D.J. Hanawalt P.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 916-922Google Scholar, 5Courcelle J. Carswell-Crumpton C. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3714-3719Google Scholar). In vitro, RecF, RecO, and RecR interact with and stabilize RecA filaments bound to DNA (12Umezu K. Chi N.W. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3875-3879Google Scholar), a role that would be consistent with the in vivo observation of limiting DNA degradation at the replication fork. Mutants lacking RecF and RecR also exhibit a delayed induction of the SOS response, consistent with the idea that these genes may help stabilize the RecA filaments which are required for SOS induction (7Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Google Scholar, 13Thoms B. Wackernagel W. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1731-1736Google Scholar, 14Hegde S. Sandler S.J. Clark A.J. Madiraju M.V. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 254-258Google Scholar, 15Whitby M.C. Lloyd R.G. Mol. Gen. Gent. 1995; 246: 174-179Google Scholar). The nascent DNA degradation that occurs in recF mutants has been shown to result from the combined action of RecQ, a 3′-5′ helicase, and RecJ, a 5′-3′ exonuclease (16Courcelle J. Hanawalt P.C. Mol. Gen. Gent. 1999; 262: 543-551Google Scholar, 17Courcelle J. Donaldson J.R. Chow K.H. Courcelle C.T. Science. 2003; 299: 1064-1067Google Scholar). Based upon the extent of nascent DNA degradation in recF mutants (5Courcelle J. Carswell-Crumpton C. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3714-3719Google Scholar), the polarity of the helicase and nuclease in vitro (18Lovett S.T. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2627-2631Google Scholar, 19Umezu K. Nakayama K. Nakayama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5363-5367Google Scholar), and the preferential loss of the nascent lagging strand DNA at the fork (16Courcelle J. Hanawalt P.C. Mol. Gen. Gent. 1999; 262: 543-551Google Scholar), RecJ and RecQ are thought to degrade the nascent lagging strand of blocked replication forks prior to the recovery of replication, as depicted in the model shown in Fig. 6. In the absence of either gene product, the nascent DNA degradation does not occur irrespective of whether RecF is present to protect the lagging strand DNA (16Courcelle J. Hanawalt P.C. Mol. Gen. Gent. 1999; 262: 543-551Google Scholar), and the frequency of illegitimate recombination is altered (20Hanada K. Ukita T. Kohno Y. Saito K. Kato J. Ikeda H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3860-3865Google Scholar, 21Ukita T. Ikeda H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2362-2367Google Scholar), suggesting that these enzymes may affect the frequency with which replication resumes accurately when it is disrupted. recO is classified with recF, recR, recJ, and recQ as genes belonging to the recF pathway. Like recF and recR, recO mutants exhibit a similar delay in SOS induction, hypersensitivity to UV irradiation, reduced plasmid recombination, reduced conjugational recombination in a recBCsbcBC background, and the persistence of daughter-strand gaps in the nascent DNA of UV-irradiated uvrA mutants (22Horii Z. Clark A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 327-344Google Scholar, 23Kolodner R. Fishel R.A. Howard M. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1060-1066Google Scholar, 24Mahdi A.A. Lloyd R.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 503-510Google Scholar). Based upon these pheno-types, recF, recR, and recO have been suggested to form an epistatic group, RecFOR. In vitro, RecO physically interacts with both RecF and RecR to form either RecFO, RecRO, or RecFRO complexes, a role which is believed to be important for RecA stabilization (7Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Google Scholar, 12Umezu K. Chi N.W. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3875-3879Google Scholar, 25Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30005-30013Google Scholar, 26Hedge S.P. Qin M.H. Li X.H. Atkinson M.A.L. Clark A.J. Rajagopalan M. Madiraju M.V.V.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14468-14473Google Scholar). These observations, taken together, suggest that RecO may be required with RecF and RecR to maintain arrested replication forks and promote the resumption of DNA synthesis after arrest. However, to date, the structures that RecO and RecR act upon at DNA damage-blocked replication forks in vivo have not been examined. To identify the relationship between RecF, RecO, and RecR at arrested replication fork structures in vivo, we have characterized the role that RecO plays during the recovery of replication after UV-induced DNA damage to determine when and where this protein functions during the recovery process.

UV Irradiation—Cultures were UV-irradiated in DGCthy media in Petri dishes on a rotating orbital shaker using a Sylvania 15-W germicidal light bulb (254 nm; 0.9 J/m2/s). Density Labeling of Replicated DNA—A fresh overnight culture was diluted 1:100 and grown in Davis minimal media with 0.4% glucose, 0.2% casamino acids, and 10 μg/ml thymine (DGCthy media) supplemented with [14C]thymine (0.1 μCi/ml) to an A600 of 0.45 in a 37 °C shaking water bath. The culture was then split into two halves and either mock UV-irradiated or UV-irradiated with 27 J/m2, before the cells were filtered on general filtration 0.45-μm membranes (Fisher-brand) and resuspended in DGC media containing 20 μg/ml 5-bromouracil in place of thymine and 0.5 μCi/ml of [3H]thymine (60.5 Ci/mmol). Cultures were allowed to recover for 1 h at 37 °C in a shaking water bath. Then, two volumes of ice-cold NET buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0) were added. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in 150 μl of TE buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) and lysed by the addition of 150 μlK2HPO4/KOH (pH 12.5) and 20 μlof20% sarcosyl. The lysate was then subjected to isopycnic alkaline CsCl gradient centrifugation by combining 0.3 g lysate, 3.31 g 0.1 m K2HPO4/KOH (pH 12.5), and 2.23 g CsCl (refractive index = 1.4055) in a 5-ml polyallomer tube and centrifuged to equilibrium. Gradient fractions were collected on Whatman No. 17 paper, precipitated in 5% trichloroacetic acid, washed in 95% ethanol, and the amount of 14C and 3H in each fraction was quantitated in a scintillation counter. Degradation Assay—A fresh overnight culture was diluted 1:100 and grown in DGCthy media supplemented with [14C]thymine (0.1 μCi/ml) to an A600 of 0.4 in a 37 °C shaking incubator. Cultures were then pulse-labeled with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for 10 s (to label the nascent DNA at the replication fork) before being filtered on 0.45-μm membranes (Fisherbrand General Filtration), washed with 2–5 ml of NET buffer, resuspended in prewarmed non-radioactive DGCthy media, UV-irradiated with 27 J/m2, and then incubated in a 37 °C shaking incubator. Duplicate 200-μl aliquots of the culture (triplicate at time 0) were collected at 20-min intervals and lysed/precipitated in cold 5% trichloroacetic acid before being filtered on Millipore glass fiber prefilters. The amount of radioactivity in each filter was determined in a scintillation counter. Two-dimensional Gel and Southern Analysis—Fresh overnight cultures of cells that contain the plasmid pBR322 were grown in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 and grown without ampicillin selection in a shaking incubator at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.5 (∼5 × 108 cells/ml) and UV-irradiated with 50 J/m2. At the indicated time points, 0.75-ml samples were placed into 0.75 ml of cold 2× NET (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA). Each sample was pelleted, resuspended in 150 μl of 1 mg/ml lysozyme and 0.2 mg/ml RNaseA in TE buffer, and lysed at 37 °C for 20 min. At this time, proteinase K (10 μl, 10 mg/mg) and sarcosyl (10 μl, 20%) were added and incubated at 50 °C for 1 h. Samples were then extracted, twice, with four volumes of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25/24/1), once with four volumes of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24/1), and dialyzed for 3 h on 47-mm Whatman 0.05-μm pore disks (VMWP04700, Whatman Bioscience) floating on a 250-ml beaker of TE. Samples were then digested with PvuII (New England Biolabs), extracted with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24/1), and equal volumes were loaded onto the gel. Restricted genomic DNA samples were run in the first dimension in 0.4% agarose, 1× Tris-borate-EDTA at 1 volume/cm. Gel lanes were cut out, recast, and run in the second dimension in 1.0% agarose, 1× Tris-borate-EDTA at 6.5 volumes/cm. Gels were transferred to Hybond N+ nylon membranes and probed with pBR322 that had been labeled with 32P by nick translation according to the protocol supplied by Promega using [α-32P]dCTP (ICN Biomedicals). Radioactivity was visualized and quantitated with a Storm 820 PhosphorImager and its associated ImageQuant Software (Molecular Dynamics). RecO Is Required to Resume Replication After UV-induced DNA Damage—Both recF and recR are required for the recovery of replication after disruption by UV-induced DNA damage (5Courcelle J. Carswell-Crumpton C. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3714-3719Google Scholar). The ability of recO to recover replication after UV irradiation was compared with that of recF and recR and visualized by density-labeling the post-irradiation DNA synthesis with 5-bromouracil. Cultures that were either UV-irradiated with 27 J/m2 or mock-irradiated were allowed to recover for a period of one hour in media containing 5-bromouracil in place of thymine, so that any DNA replicated during this period would be of a greater density than the DNA synthesized before irradiation. The denser, replicated DNA in each culture was then separated from the rest of the DNA by centrifugation in isopycnic alkaline CsCl gradients and quantitated. As shown in Fig. 1, one hour after irradiation, UV-irradiated wild-type cells had replicated nearly as much DNA as their unirradiated counterparts, demonstrating that replication had fully recovered within this time frame. However, the amount of DNA synthesized in either recF, recR, or recO mutants was inhibited to a similar extent after this dose of UV irradiation. By contrast, although both recJ and recQ process the nascent DNA after UV irradiation (16Courcelle J. Hanawalt P.C. Mol. Gen. Gent. 1999; 262: 543-551Google Scholar) and affect the time that replication recovers, 1K.-H. Chow and J. Courcelle, unpublished observations. these genes are not essential for replication to resume, and significant amounts of DNA synthesis are observed in the absence of these gene products. It is of interest to note that, in an otherwise wild-type background, mutations in recJ or recQ do not render cells sensitive to UV irradiation (29Lovett S.T. Clark A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 157: 190-196Google Scholar, 30Nakayama H. Nakayama K. Nakayama R. Irino N. Nakayama Y. Hanawalt P.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 195: 474-480Google Scholar). The lack of recovery in recF and recR mutants is associated with a failure to maintain replication forks blocked by DNA damage. This can be visualized by examining the structural intermediates that are associated with arrested replication forks on plasmids such as pBR322 using two-dimensional agarose gel analysis (17Courcelle J. Donaldson J.R. Chow K.H. Courcelle C.T. Science. 2003; 299: 1064-1067Google Scholar, 31Friedman K.L. Brewer B.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 613-627Google Scholar). To determine whether recO mutants also fail to maintain the replication fork, we characterized the structural intermediates that occurred on replicating plasmid molecules of pBR322 after UV irradiation with 50 J/m2 in growing E. coli cultures. Previous studies by our group (17Courcelle J. Donaldson J.R. Chow K.H. Courcelle C.T. Science. 2003; 299: 1064-1067Google Scholar) have shown that this dose produces 0.5 lesions per plasmid strand and that 90% of the parental cells survive the irradiation to form colonies. Cells containing the plasmid pBR322 were UV-irradiated, and the genomic DNA was purified, digested with PvuII (which cuts the plasmid just downstream of the unidirectional origin of replication), and analyzed by two-dimensional agarose gels at the times indicated. In this technique, nonreplicating plasmids migrate as linear 4.4-kb fragments, whereas replicating fragments form Y-shaped structures and migrate more slowly because of their larger size and nonlinear shape. These replicating fragments form an arc that extends out from the linear fragment (Fig. 2A). In wild-type cells, a transient reversal of the replication fork has been shown to occur on plasmids after UV irradiation (17Courcelle J. Donaldson J.R. Chow K.H. Courcelle C.T. Science. 2003; 299: 1064-1067Google Scholar). The regressed fork intermediate is maintained by the RecF, RecR, and RecA proteins until a time that correlates with the removal of the lesions by nucleotide excision repair and the recovery of replication. The extrusion of the nascent DNA converts the three-arm replication fork structure into a four-arm, replication intermediate that further retards its mobility in the gel. These four-arm structures migrate in a cone region beyond the normal replication arc (Fig. 2A). Consistent with our previous studies, UV-irradiated recF and recR mutants did not accumulate the cone region intermediates to any significant extent (17Courcelle J. Donaldson J.R. Chow K.H. Courcelle C.T. Science. 2003; 299: 1064-1067Google Scholar). When we examined the replicating plasmids in UV-irradiated recO mutants, the replication fork intermediate also failed to accumulate (Fig. 2B), indicating that RecO, like RecF and RecR, is required to maintain the replication fork after arrest by UV-induced DNA damage. RecO Is Required with RecF and RecR to Protect the Nascent DNA at Blocked Replication Forks from Degradation by RecQ and RecJ—The failure to recover replication in UV-irradiated recF or recR mutants is associated with the extensive loss of nascent DNA made just prior to irradiation (5Courcelle J. Carswell-Crumpton C. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3714-3719Google Scholar). The failure of recO mutants to recover replication could indicate that RecO is required at a step similar to RecF and RecR and is needed to limit the nascent DNA degradation. Alternatively, RecO could be required at a subsequent step in the recovery process once the nascent DNA strands have been stabilized or protected. To differentiate between these possibilities, we examined the nascent degradation pattern in recO mutants. To this end, exponentially growing, [14C]thymine-prelabeled cultures were pulse-labeled with [3H]thymidine for 10 s to label the DNA at replication forks. Then, the culture was transferred to nonradioactive medium and immediately UV-irradiated with 27 J/m2. The 14C prelabel allowed us to compare the degradation occurring in the overall genome to that in the 3H-labeled DNA made at replication forks just prior to UV irradiation. As shown previously, UV-irradiated wild-type cells degrade very little of their overall genomic DNA after irradiation. However, some limited degradation of the nascent DNA was detected at times prior to the recovery of replication (Fig. 3A; Refs. 4Courcelle J. Crowley D.J. Hanawalt P.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 916-922Google Scholar, 5Courcelle J. Carswell-Crumpton C. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3714-3719Google Scholar, 32Hanawalt P. Brempelis I. Proceedings of the 7th International Congress of Biochemistry, August, 1967. Japanese Biochemical Society, Tokyo, Japan1967: 650Google Scholar). In contrast to the limited degradation in wild-type cells, recF or recR mutants degraded approximately half of the nascent DNA made just prior to UV irradiation (Fig. 3B). When the degradation pattern was examined in recO mutants, we found that the nascent DNA was extensively degraded, and that the extent of degradation was similar to that occurring in recF and recR mutants (Fig. 3B). The result indicates that, like RecF and RecR, RecO contributes to protecting the DNA at blocked replication forks in UV-irradiated cells. Although extensive degradation occurs in all three recF, recR, and recO single mutants, it is possible that these gene products protect different strands of the blocked replication fork in vivo. If this is the case, then we would predict that the nascent DNA degradation would increase when more than one of these gene products is absent. To examine this possibility, we examined the nascent DNA degradation in double mutants of recF recR, recF recO, and recR recO, as well as the corresponding recF recO recR triple mutant. All double mutants exhibited nascent degradation patterns that were similar in extent to the recF or recR single mutants (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, the nascent DNA degradation in the triple mutant was also limited to approximately half of the nascent DNA (Fig. 4B), suggesting that RecO functions together with RecF and RecR to protect the same strand (or structural aspect) of the blocked replication fork. If RecO acts together with RecF and RecR to protect the nascent lagging strand of the arrested replication fork, then the observed nascent DNA degradation should be dependent upon RecJ and RecQ (16Courcelle J. Hanawalt P.C. Mol. Gen. Gent. 1999; 262: 543-551Google Scholar). To test this idea, we examined the nascent DNA degradation in recO mutants that also lacked either the RecQ helicase or RecJ nuclease (Fig. 3B). Consistent with this idea, the nascent DNA degradation was reduced to a similar extent in recF, recR,or recO mutants when either RecJ or RecQ was inactivated (Fig. 5). These observations indicate that the nascent DNA degradation in recO, recF, and recR mutants results from the same enzymatic degradation of the lagging strand by RecJ and RecQ. RecF, RecO, and RecR are proposed to form an epistatic group based upon several shared biochemical and genetic characteristics. All three mutations render cells equally hypersensitive to UV irradiation, reduce the frequency of recombinant progeny in conjugation or transduction assays in recBC or recD backgrounds, and delay the induction of the SOS response after DNA damage (14Hegde S. Sandler S.J. Clark A.J. Madiraju M.V. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 254-258Google Scholar, 15Whitby M.C. Lloyd R.G. Mol. Gen. Gent. 1995; 246: 174-179Google Scholar, 23Kolodner R. Fishel R.A. Howard M. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1060-1066Google Scholar, 24Mahdi A.A. Lloyd R.G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 503-510Google Scholar). A recent study suggested that the UV hypersensitivity of recO is associated with a delayed recovery of replication similar to recF and recR (33Rangarajan S. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 617-628Google Scholar). The results presented here indicate that RecF, RecR, and RecO function together to maintain replication forks arrested by UV-induced DNA damage. In addition, all three proteins are required together to limit the degradation of the nascent lagging strand by RecJ and RecQ after UV irradiation. In vitro, all three proteins bind DNA, and RecO has been shown to promote annealing between homologous DNA strands (34Luisi-Deluca C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 124-138Google Scholar). RecO and RecR promote RecA protein-mediated d-loop formation at the 5′ end of linear ssDNA and stabilize RecA filaments to prevent their disassembly (7Shan Q. Bork J.M. Webb B.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 519-540Google Scholar, 25Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30005-30013Google Scholar). Complexes of RecF and RecR bind double-strand DNA and gapped DNA substrates and limit how far RecA filaments are able to extend into double-strand regions (35Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 347-356Google Scholar). Furthermore, the RecFOR proteins in combination have been shown to facilitate RecA loading onto gapped DNA substrates (12Umezu K. Chi N.W. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3875-3879Google Scholar, 36Morimatsu K. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1337-1347Google Scholar). These in vitro characterizations are consistent with the in vivo observations that RecF, RecO, and RecR may recognize and bind to nascent DNA at blocked replication forks and serve to stabilize the RecA filaments at these regions, as proposed previously (5Courcelle J. Carswell-Crumpton C. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3714-3719Google Scholar, 37Courcelle J. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8196-8202Google Scholar). The data presented here and in previous work indicate that binding by these proteins limits the nascent degradation on the lagging strand by the RecQ-RecJ helicase-nuclease in vivo (Fig. 5). However, to date, the binding and activity of these gene products has not been examined on replication fork-like structures in vitro. A role for RecF, RecO, and RecR in stabilizing RecA filaments at blocked replication forks is also consistent with several genetic observations. recF, recO, and recR mutants exhibit a delayed SOS induction (14Hegde S. Sandler S.J. Clark A.J. Madiraju M.V. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 254-258Google Scholar, 15Whitby M.C. Lloyd R.G. Mol. Gen. Gent. 1995; 246: 174-179Google Scholar). Because RecA filaments bound to single-strand DNA function as the inducing signal for up-regulation of the SOS genes, the delay in up-regulation of SOS genes may reflect the reduced ability of RecA to bind to the replication fork substrates in the absence of RecFOR. Additionally, certain mutant alleles of RecA that increase its affinity to bind DNA are able to partially bypass the requirement for RecFOR and partially suppress the UV sensitivity of recF, recR, and recO mutants (38Madiraju M.V. Lavery P.E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Clark A.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10529-10535Google Scholar, 39Madiraju M.V. Templin A. Clark A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6592-6596Google Scholar, 40Wang T.C. Chang H.Y. Hung J.L. Mutat. Res. 1993; 294: 157-166Google Scholar). To incorporate these observations, we have placed RecFOR at the nascent lagging strand junction of the block replication fork (Fig. 6). However, the precise arrangement and stoichiometry of this complex will require further investigation, and it remains possible that RecF, RecO, and RecR independently bind and recognize different portions of the replication fork structure to achieve its task of limiting the nascent lagging strand degradation and of stabilizing RecA filaments at arrested replication fork structures. This possibility is supported by genetic studies that show overexpression of RecR or RecO alone can partially suppress the UV sensitivity of recF mutants (41Sandler S.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 245: 741-749Google Scholar, 42Sandler S.J. Clark A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3661-3672Google Scholar). However, the stoichiometry and constitution of the functional complex (or complexes) on the nascent lagging strand remains an important aspect that has not yet been identified. It is clear from this and previous studies that these genes are required for maintenance of replication forks blocked at DNA lesions until a time corresponding to when the lesions are repaired and replication can resume. In the absence of DNA damage when replication is not frequently disrupted, inactivation of RecF, RecO, or RecR does not seem to affect the growth rate or viability of growing E. coli cultures. However, in the event that replication arrests before the duplication of the genome has been completed, RecF, RecO, and RecR play a critical role in recognizing arrested fork structures as a proper substrate and in facilitating the stabilization of the RecA filament to protect and promote the resumption of replication, thereby allowing the processive duplication of the chromosome to be completed.

They share a distinct molecular structure, and from the N terminus their extracellular part consists of two immunoglobulin-like domains (Ig domains) followed by two fibronectin-type III repeats (FNIII domains). The membrane-spanning single helix is followed by the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. The three family members are widely expressed in adult tissues, most prominently in the brain, testis, lymphatic, and vascular system (8Crosier K.E. Crosier P.S.

A number of different phenotypes are observed in mice lacking individual or all three receptors. For example, Mer-truncated mice develop blindness because of postnatal degeneration of the photoreceptors. Mice lacking all three receptors are infertile because of the destruction of the germ cells (11Lu Q. Gore M. Zhang Q. Camenisch T. Boast S. Casagranda F. Lai C. Skinner M.K. Klein R. Matsushima G.K.

Possibly, these late onset phenotypes result from the impairment of the immune system, and it has been suggested that the main function of the Axl/Tyro3 receptors might be the regulation of the macrophage response (12Scott R.S.

Residues in the LG domains are responsible for receptor binding and activation (15Mark M.R. Chen J. Hammonds R.G. Sadick M. Godowsk P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9785-9789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and recently a crystal structure of this fragment (Gas6-LG) has been determined (26Sasaki T. Knyazev P.G. Cheburkin Y. Gohring W. Tisi D. Ullrich A. Timpl R. Hohenester E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44164-44170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Previous studies revealed that bovine protein S is also able to activate the kinase activity of human Tyro3; however, further investigations have shown that this interaction is limited to this single interspecies cross-reactivity and that human protein S does not bind to the human receptors (27Godowski P.J. Mark M.R. Chen J. Sadick M.D. Raab H. Hammonds R.G. Cell. 1995; 82: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar).As for all RTKs, ligand-induced signal transduction is expected to be the main mechanism by which the Axl/Tyro3 family members exert their biological functions. However, it is not clear whether Gas6 is the only ligand for these receptors because, unexpectedly, the main phenotype of Gas6 knock-out mice is different from the phenotypes of the receptor-deficient mice. Gas6 knock-out mice are protected against thrombosis because of a platelet aggregation defect (28Angelillo-Scherrer A. de Frutos P. Aparicio C. Melis E. Savi P. Lupu F. Arnout J. Dewerchin M. Hoylaerts M. Herbert J. Collen D. Dahlback B. Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). It is also possible that additional mechanisms exist by which the Axl/Tyro3 receptors function, and these mechanisms might not involve signaling through activation of the tyrosine kinase activity but rather cell adhesion processes (29Bellosta P. Costa M. Lin D.A. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 614-625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).To shed light onto the molecular mechanisms by which this important family of receptors exerts its functions, we investigated the atomic structure of the Tyro3 receptor. We report the crystal structure of the N-terminal Ig domain pair of Tyro3 and show that this fragment binds the ligand Gas6 and displays the identical binding specificity profile as the full-length mature receptor. The crystal structure suggests the existence of a common ligand-binding site in the Axl/Tyro3 receptors, located close to the interface of the Ig domains. Furthermore the existence of ligand-independent receptor dimers both in the crystal and in solution explains a number of previous observations regarding the function of these receptors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Production—The DNA encoding for the extracellular domain of the human Tyro3 receptor was amplified by PCR from a cDNA pool of human adult brain, kindly obtained from Regina Reszka (Max Delbrück Center, Berlin, Germany). A fragment of the Tyro3 gene encoding for residues 1-182 (numbering of the residues in the mature protein is according to Swiss Protein Database entry Q06418, named hereafter Tyro3-D1D2) was cloned into a pET21a+ expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) using restriction sites NdeI and XhoI. The correctness of the construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing.Following transformation into the methionine-auxotroph Escherichia coli strain B834(DE3), unlabeled protein was produced in LB medium at 37 °C upon induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Selenomethionine-labeled protein was produced as described (30Budisa N. Steipe B. Demange P. Eckerskorn C. Kellermann J. Huber R. Eur J Biochem. 1995; 230: 788-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in minimal medium overnight to an A600nm = 0.6, harvested, and washed three times with medium containing selenomethionine instead of methionine. The cells were resuspended in selenomethionine-containing medium and cultivated for 2 h, and protein expression was induced for 10 h with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside.The bacterial pellet was sonicated in 20 mm Tris-buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm EDTA. Inclusion bodies were isolated by centrifugation, washed, and resolved in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8, 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, and 4 mm dithiothreitol. The concentration of the protein was adjusted to 1 mg/ml (estimated from UV absorbance), and refolding conditions were identified using the FSAP method (31Heiring C. Muller Y.A. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Large scale refolding was accomplished by rapid dilution of the solubilized protein into a buffer containing 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8, and 10 mm cysteine followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C.The Tyro3-D1D2 fragment was purified with a HR Q-Sepharose chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8, and eluted with a 0-1 m NaCl gradient. The fractions containing Tyro3-D1D2 were concentrated using Ultrafree Concentrators (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl. This protocol yielded about 10-15 mg of pure protein/liter of cell culture.Site-directed mutations were introduced in a two-step protocol. First, two overlapping fragments were amplified with PCR using the pET21a+:Tyro3-D1D2 plasmid as a template. The first fragment was obtained by combining the original forward primer with a reverse primer containing the desired mutation, and for the second fragment a mutated forward primer was used together with the original reverse primer. Second, the two purified PCR products were fused to each other in a single denaturing/annealing cycle and reamplified using the original forward and reverse primers only. Subsequently the fragment was subcloned into a pET21a+ vector, and the presence of the desired mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Pure mutant protein was produced using the protocol established for the wild type protein.Biochemical Characterization—Analytical size exclusion chromatography of Gas6-LG, human, or bovine protein S alone or in combination with Tyro3-D1D2 was performed at 4 °C with a Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences) attached to an Äkta Purifier (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with a running buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2 at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. 100-μl protein samples loaded onto the column contained either 70 μg of Gas6-LG, human protein S, or bovine protein S or 30 μg of Tyro3-D1D2 as a reference, as well as mixtures of Gas6-LG/Tyro3-D1D2 (70 μg/50 μg), bovine protein S/Tyro3-D1D2 (70 μg/30 μg), or human protein S/Tyro3-D1D2 (70 μg/30 μg) roughly corresponding to a 1:1.5 molar ratio. Gel filtration experiments in which the three Tyro3-D1D2 mutants were compared with wild type Tyro3-D1D2 were performed with a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min.The self-association behavior of Tyro3-D1D2 wild type and of mutant I59R was further investigated by analytical ultracentrifugation with a Beckman XL-I centrifuge (Beckman Coulter). Radial absorbance data sets at 280 nm and at two different protein concentrations (0.2 and 0.75 mg/ml) were collected at four different angular speeds (15,000, 25,000, 35,000, and 42,000 rpm) for Tyro3-D1D2 wild type and at two different speeds (15,000 and 25,000 rpm) for mutant I59R. Data were analyzed with the Origin6/XL-I package (Beckman), and best fits between model and data obtained with a monomer dimer self-association model. The dissociation constant (KD) for the wild type protein is 30 μm and greater than 15 mm for mutant I59R.Crystallization and X-ray Structure Determination—Single crystals of the Tyro3-D1D2 fragment suitable for x-ray analysis were grown by using the hanging drop method and mixing 2 μl of protein solution (17 mg/ml, 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0) with 1 μl of precipitant solution (100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 5.4-5.7, 10-14% polyethylene glycol 2000, 200 mm magnesium acetate, and 4 mm dithiothreitol) over 700 μl of reservoir solution (100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 5.5, 12% polyethylene glycol 2000, 200 mm magnesium acetate). Crystals with sizes of about 150 × 70 × 70 μm3 grow at 20 °C within a week and have a hexagonal cross-section. Prior to data collection, for cryoprotection the crystals were soaked in a reservoir solution in which the polyethylene glycol 400 concentration was increased stepwise to 30% (w/v). Native data were collected on a CuKα rotating anode equipped with a Rigaku Raxis IV+ image plate system. Multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) data were collected at three different wavelengths (peak, inflection point, and remote) at beamline BW7a at the EMBL Outstation in Hamburg, Germany. The data were reduced with program XDS (32Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 24: 916-924Crossref Scopus (1681) Google Scholar).Initial phases were obtained in space group P61 with the program SOLVE/RESOLVE (33Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar) and further improved with solvent flattening and NCS averaging. An initial model spanning residues 7-182 was built manually with program O (34Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13003) Google Scholar) and contained most of the side chains apart from two loop regions in the first Ig domain (residues 43-46 and 80-84). Here only the Cα backbone could be traced. After an initial round of refinement against the MAD data set, the model was refined against the 1.95-Å native data set using the simulated annealing and energy minimization protocol of the crystallography software (CNS) (35Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16929) Google Scholar). Following the introduction of water molecules, model refinement was continued with the program REFMAC (36Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13774) Google Scholar). Each round of automatic refinement was followed by the inspection of the σA-weighted electron density maps (37Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2035) Google Scholar) and the manual rebuilding of the model. Rfree was monitored to assess model refinement progress.The final model consists of the two molecules of Tyro3-D1D2 present in the asymmetric unit (residues Gly7-Gln182), 276 water molecules, 1 zinc ion (probably introduced as an impurity during crystallization) as well as four acetates and one HEPES molecule present in the crystallization buffer. Four residues in molecule A (Gln30, Ile59, Phe61, His180) and six residues in molecule B (His57, Ile59, Phe61, Lys65, Ser66, Glu96) are modeled with two alternative side chain conformations.

Open table in a new tab RESULTSFunctional Characterization of Tyro3-D1D2—A fragment containing the first two Ig domains of the human Tyro3 receptor (residues 1-182) was tested by analytical size exclusion chromatography for its ability to bind to its physiological ligand Gas6 as well as to the proteins bovine and human protein S. The elution profiles (Fig. 1, A-C) of each of these putative binding partners alone and mixed with Tyro3-D1D2 in a molar ratio of 1:1.5 show that the addition of Tyro3-D1D2 to Gas6-LG causes the formation of a complex, as revealed by a clearly visible shift of the Gas6 peak toward higher molecular weights when compared with Gas6 alone.The same behavior is observed when mixing bovine protein S and Tyro3-D1D2. A sample collected from this higher molecular weight peak analyzed by SDS-PAGE confirms the formation of the complex (data not shown). In contrast to bovine protein S, no complex is formed upon the addition of human protein S to Tyro3-D1D2. In this case the elution profile of the mixture resembles the overlaid profiles of the two reference samples.These experiments show that both Gas6 and bovine protein S bind to Tyro3-D1D2. Moreover, Tyro3-D1D2 is capable of discriminating between bovine and human protein S, and thus this truncated fragment displays the same binding specificity profile as reported for the native human Tyro3 receptor (27Godowski P.J. Mark M.R. Chen J. Sadick M.D. Raab H. Hammonds R.G. Cell. 1995; 82: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar).To further characterize the fragment, we performed analytical ultracentrifugation experiments. Radial absorbance data sets from samples containing different protein concentrations were collected at sedimentation equilibrium at different speeds. Data evaluation using a model with single ideal species resulted in an average molecular mass of 31 kDa (the nominal molecular mass of Tyro3-D1D2 calculated from the sequence is 19.6 kDa). In this model the apparent molecular mass increased with the centrifugal radius, indicating the presence of higher aggregates. A significantly better fit is obtained applying a self-association model and assuming a dimer monomer equilibrium. The calculated dissociation constant of the dimer monomer equilibrium is 30 μm.Crystal Structure of Tyro3-D1D2—Well diffracting crystals of the Tyro3-D1D2 fragment belong to space group P61 and contain two Tyro3-D1D2 fragments in the asymmetric unit. The crystal structure was solved by the MAD method and the model refined at 1.95 Å resolution to a crystallographic R-factor of 21.3%. The polypeptide chain of the fragment can be traced uninterruptedly in the electron density from residues Gly7 to Gln182. The first six residues are disordered and therefore are not visible in the electron density maps.The overall structure of Tyro3-D1D2 (Fig. 2A) consists of two immunoglobulin-like domains, in agreement with the modular architecture predicted from the amino acid sequence. In the full-length receptor, the polypeptide chain would then protrude from the C terminus of the fragment leading to the two membrane proximal FNIII repeats. The N-terminal Ig domain consists of residues 7-96 and belongs to the I-set of Ig domains (38Harpaz Y. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Its closest structural homologue is telokin (39Holden H.M. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. Rayment I. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 840-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A remarkable feature can be observed in the G-strand; instead of solely contributing to the AGFCC′ sheet, it starts as a short G′-strand (residues 86-88) hydrogen-bonded to strand B of the DEB sheet. Upon interruption of this sheet extension by a β-bulge the polypeptide chain crosses over to become part of the AGFCC′ sheet (residues 91-96). Such a sheet crossover does not occur in other Ig domains of the I-set as classified by the SCOP (structural classification of proteins) data base (40Hubbard T.J. Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Chothia C. Nucleic. Acids Res. 1997; 25: 236-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and to the best of our knowledge has not been observed in any other Ig superfamily domain fold so far. The second Ig domain spans residues 97-182, and strand A starts at residue 100. This domain belongs to the C2-set of the Ig domains. Its closest structural neighbor is the third extracellular Ig domain of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (41Plotnikov A.N. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M. Cell. 1999; 98: 641-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Monomer structure and surface conservation. A, schematic representation of the Tyro3-D1D2 monomer. The first domain (D1) belongs to the I-set of Ig domains and features a unique crossing over of the G-strand between the DEB and the AGFCC′ sheet. The second domain (D2) belongs to the C2-set. B, mapping of conserved residues (yellow patches) onto the surface of Tyro3-D1D2, displayed in two different orientations. C, sequence alignment of the three human Axl/Tyro3 family members spanning the N-terminal two Ig domains. The β-sheet structure of Tyro3-D1D2 is indicated by green arrows. Conserved residues are highlighted in yellow; and residues involved in the dimerization interface are marked with black boxes. Molecular sketches were generated with PyMol (Delano Scientific, San Carlos, CA).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The two Ig domains are linked together in an extended orientation. An angle of 139° is formed between the Cα atom of Glu96 from the linker region and the centers of mass of the two Ig domains. Inspection of the domain interface shows that the orientation of the domains is stabilized by an intricate network of hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3A). These interactions are likely to provide some rigidity in the overall arrangement of the two domains. This rigidity is confirmed by the observation that the domain orientation is similar in the two molecules of Tyro3-D1D2 present in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. When the entire molecules are superimposed, the root mean square deviation value between the Cα atoms of both molecules in the asymmetric unit is 0.793 Å. Only slightly lower values are obtained when the N-terminal and C-terminal Ig domains are superimposed separately (0.201 Å and 0.483Å). We therefore expect that the extended orientation observed for the first two Ig domains of the Tyro3 receptor is not a result of the crystal packing but prevails in receptor molecules displayed on the cell surface.Fig. 3Structural details in the Tyro3-D1D2 monomer. A, stereoview of the interface between the first and second Ig domains of Tyro3-D1D2. Hydrogen bonds are displayed as yellow dots. The linker segment is shown in an all atom main chain representation and the remaining parts as Cα sketches.

Intramolecular and intermolecular recombination studies showed that the frequency of recombination between the GAA·TTC tracts was as much as 15 times higher than the non-repeating control sequences. Homologous, intramolecular recombination between GAA·TTC tracts and GAAGGA·TCCTTC repeats also occurred with a very high frequency (∼0.8%). Biochemical analyses of the recombination products demonstrated the expansions and deletions of the GAA·TTC repeats. These results, together with our previous studies on the CTG·CAG sequences, suggest that the recombinational hot spot characteristics may be a common feature of all triplet repeat sequences. Unexpectedly, we found that the recombination properties of the GAA·TTC tracts were unique, compared with CTG·CAG repeats, because they depended on the DNA secondary structure polymorphism. Increasing the length of the GAA·TTC repeats decreased the intramolecular recombination frequency between these tracts. Also, a correlation was found between the propensity of the GAA·TTC tracts to adopt the sticky DNA conformation and the inhibition of intramolecular recombination. The use of novobiocin to modulate the intracellular DNA topology, i.e. the lowering of the negative superhelical density, repressed the formation of the sticky DNA structure, thereby restoring the expected positive correlation between the length of the GAA·TTC tracts and the frequency of intramolecular recombination.

Microsatellites or short tandem repeats are DNA sequences composed of repetitive units of one to six nucleotides (1Weber J.L. Wong C. Hum. Mol.

Due to the high instability of the (GAA·TTC) repeats cloned into pFW25, we were unable to isolate plasmids harboring more than 100 (GAA·TTC) repeats. The pFW25 derivatives shown in Fig. 1B were obtained as the deletion products after the transformation of E. coli HB101 with the ligation mixture. All plasmids used here were characterized by restriction mapping (to determine the orientation and length of the cloned TRS) and dideoxy sequencing of both strands as described earlier (29Napierala M.

In the case of recombination studies performed in the presence of novobiocin (Sigma), the drug was added, at 5 μm concentration, at all stages of the experiment beginning with the preparation of competent cells. In addition, plasmids used in these experiments were isolated from the E. coli HB101 cells grown with novobiocin. Novobiocin inhibits the assembly of the active gyrase (39Lewis R.J. Singh O.M.

Detection of RB—The presence of sticky DNA was determined by detection of the retarded band (RB) in 0.8% agarose gels as described earlier (15Sakamoto N. Chastain P.D. Parniewski P. Ohshima K.

This treatment completely converts the RB to the linear monomeric form (15Sakamoto N. Chastain P.D. Parniewski P. Ohshima K. Pandolfo M. Griffith J.D. Wells R.D. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 465-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In order to evaluate the amount of RB in different plasmids (Fig. 2B), AccI-digested DNA fragments were radioactively labeled with the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I and [α-32P]dATP, and the gels were analyzed using Storm 820 and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). The statistical analyses were performed using SigmaStat version 2.03. Polyacrylamide Gel Analyses—The sizes of the TRS tracts as well as complex (GAA·TTC)m(GAAGGA·TCCTTC)n motifs in the recombination products were determined using AatII/NdeI digestion followed by end labeling as described above. The products were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide gels in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)). The lengths of the inserts were calculated as described earlier (46Pluciennik A. Iyer R.R. Parniewski P. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28386-28397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The primary structures of more than 20 individual recombination products were determined by direct DNA sequencing of one or both DNA strands. Genetic Assays for Intra- and Intermolecular Recombination—The genetic assays for monitoring the frequencies of intramolecular as well as intermolecular recombination between CTG·CAG sequences were established previously (29Napierala M. Parniewski P. Pluciennik A. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34087-34100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 30Pluciennik A. Iyer R.R. Napierala M. Larson J.E. Filutowicz M. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34074-34086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An intramolecular recombination system was developed in which a crossover event between direct repeats leads to the deletion of the intervening sequence, including the GFPuv gene, located between the repeats (Fig. 1C). This deletion results in white colony formation. In contrast, when the plasmid containing the GFPuv gene is established in the host cell, the expression of this gene leads to the formation of a fluorescent green colony. Thus, the frequency of the recombination events was measured as the ratio of the number of white colonies to the total number of viable cells. In order to study the frequency of intermolecular recombination between plasmids harboring the (GAA·TTC) repeats, derivatives of pBR322 containing different TRS lengths were transformed into E. coli AB1157 and ECF005 cells. This was followed by a second transformation with the pFW25 derivatives containing varying lengths of the (GAA·TTC) inserts (Fig. 1B). In E. coli ECF005, both plasmids can co-exist without recombining and can give rise to TetR and CmR colonies. These plasmids could also recombine to form co-integrants at a certain frequency. In order to establish the frequency of these recombination events, the (GAA·TTC)-containing pBR322 and pFW25 derivatives were sequentially transformed into E. coli AB1157. Because this was a two-step transformation, the pBR322 derivative was already established in the cell and could therefore exist independently in the presence of tetracycline. The pFW25 derivatives, however, cannot replicate in this strain because of the absence of the π protein (30Pluciennik A. Iyer R.R. Napierala M. Larson J.E. Filutowicz M. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34074-34086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, after the transformation of the TetR cells with the pFW25 derivatives, the only way to obtain TetR, CmR colonies is by recombination between the TRS-harboring plasmids. This could be exclusively due to co-integrants, which not only replicate using the ColE1 replicon but also carry the chloramphenicol resistance gene. Thus, the frequency of recombination between the plasmids was calculated as shown in Equation 1, frequency=No.coloniesfromAB1157No.coloniesfromECF005×R(Eq. 1) Since two different strains were used in the experiment, it was possible that their transformation efficiencies differed and thus could affect the results. Therefore, R is the ratio of the efficiency of transformation of E. coli ECF005 to that of E. coli AB1157 established using pACYC184 (30Pluciennik A. Iyer R.R. Napierala M. Larson J.E. Filutowicz M.

Several additional controls (such as plasmid copy number determination, growth advantage control, and plasmid establishment control) were conducted, as described in detail previously (29Napierala M.

We determined, within the limits described previously (29Napierala M. Parniewski P. Pluciennik A. Wells R.D. J. Biol.

GAA·TTC Tracts Are Preferred Sites for Intramolecular Recombination, but Long Sticky DNA Is Inhibitory—Plasmids pRW4876gfp, pRW4882gfp, and pRW4886gfp harboring pairs of 33, 60, and 176 GAA·TTC tracts, respectively (Fig. 1A), were transformed into E. coli AB1157, the parental strain. Two controls were used in these experiments as follows: pRW4819gfp containing a pair of (CTG·CAG)67 repeats and pRW4873gfp harboring a pair of non-repeating, 354-bp fragments of the DMPK gene (Fig. 1A). Fig. 2A shows that pRW4876gfp with two (GAA·TTC)33 tracts, oriented as direct repeats, recombined in E. coli AB1157 with a frequency ∼10 times higher than the plasmid carrying the non-repeating sequences (pRW4873gfp). In addition, pRW4876gfp had a much higher (1.5–60 times) propensity for intramolecular recombination than plasmids harboring tracts of 17, 67, 98, and 165 CTG·CAG repeats (29Napierala M. Parniewski P. Pluciennik A. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34087-34100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, the studies conducted with pRW4882gfp, carrying longer GAA·TTC tracts (of 60 repeats), showed a decrease in the frequency of intramolecular recombination from 12.6% for the plasmid with a pair of (GAA·TTC)33 repeats to 7.4% for pRW4882gfp. Moreover, a further increase in the length of the recombining sequences, up to 176 repeats, led to an even more dramatic suppression of recombination (Fig. 2A). Thus, increasing the length of the recombining sequences from 33 to 176 GAA·TTC repeats showed an ∼3-fold decrease in the recombination frequency. These results were confirmed by three independent experiments performed in E. coli AB1157. The same tendency was observed in another wild type E. coli strain, KMBL1001 (Fig. 3A, filled symbols). It should be pointed out that, in all cases, regardless of the length of the recombining sequences, the frequency of recombination between the GAA·TTC repeats was several times higher than for the non-repeating, control DMPK fragments (Fig. 2A). Thus, we conclude that GAA·TTC repeats per se are preferred sites (hot spots) for intramolecular recombination. In order to determine the cause of the inverse correlation between the frequency of recombination and the length of homologous sequences, a restriction analysis of the plasmids harboring GAA·TTC tracts was performed (Fig. 2B). As expected, when the two GAA·TTC repeat inserts were oriented as direct repeats, a DNA triplex structure between the distantly located TRS tracts, sticky DNA, was formed (15Sakamoto N. Chastain P.D.

We found that a sod-1 mutant, with a defective Cu,Zn-type superoxide dismutase (SOD), showed accelerated light-dependent induction of carotenoid accumulation in the mycelia compared with the wild type. The initial rate of light-induced carotenoid accumulation in the sod-1 mutant was faster than that in the vvd mutant known to accumulate high concentrations. This acceleration was suppressed by treatment with antioxidant reagents. Light-induced transcription of genes involved in carotenoid synthesis, al-1, -2, and -3, was sustained in the sod-1 mutant, whereas it was transient in the wild type. Moreover sod-1 was defective in terms of light-induced polarity of perithecia. By genetic analysis, the enhancement in light-inducible carotenoid synthesis in sod-1 was dependent on the wild type alleles of wc-1 and wc-2. However, the sod-1;vvd double mutant showed additive effects on the carotenoid accumulation in the mycelia. These results suggested that intracellular reactive oxygen species regulated by SOD-1 could affect the light-signal transduction pathway via WC proteins.

The initial rate of light-induced carotenoid accumulation in the sod-1 mutant was faster than that in the vvd mutant known to accumulate high concentrations. This acceleration was suppressed by treatment with antioxidant reagents. Light-induced transcription of genes involved in carotenoid synthesis, al-1, -2, and -3, was sustained in the sod-1 mutant, whereas it was transient in the wild type. Moreover sod-1 was defective in terms of light-induced polarity of perithecia. By genetic analysis, the enhancement in light-inducible carotenoid synthesis in sod-1 was dependent on the wild type alleles of wc-1 and wc-2. However, the sod-1;vvd double mutant showed additive effects on the carotenoid accumulation in the mycelia. These results suggested that intracellular reactive oxygen species regulated by SOD-1 could affect the light-signal transduction pathway via WC proteins. Light is one of the most important environmental factors being utilized for various biological phenomena by living organisms (1Kendrich R.E. Kronenberg G.H.M. Photomorphogenesis in Plants. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Netherlands1994Crossref Google Scholar, 2Meyerowitz E.M. Somerville C.R. Arabidopsis. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Typical examples are the visual systems in animals, photosynthesis in plants, and photomorphogenesis in fungi. In Neurospora crassa, several biological phenomena are under the control of blue light. Light-induced processes are summarized as follows: (i) synthesis of carotenoids in the mycelia (3Harding R.W. Turner R.V. Plant Physiol. 1981; 68: 745-749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), (ii) induction of conidiation (3Harding R.W. Turner R.V. Plant Physiol. 1981; 68: 745-749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), (iii) formation of protoperithecia on nitrogen-deficient media (4Degli-Innocenti F. Russo V.E. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 757-761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), (vi) positive phototropism of perithecial beaks (5Harding R.W. Melles S. Plant Physiol. 1984; 72: 996-1000Crossref Google Scholar), (v) positioning of the beak formed on the perithecium (perithecial polarity) (6Oda K. Hasunuma K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 7Ogura Y. Yoshida Y. Yabe N. Hasunuma K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21228-21234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and (vi) phase shift in the circadian rhythm of conidiation (8Sargent M.L. Briggs W.R.

Much information on photoreceptors and light-inducible genes has been accumulated by genetic and molecular biological analyses to understand the molecular mechanism of these photobiological phenomena. In the search for the blue light photoreceptor in N. crassa, light-insensitive mutants, white collar (wc) 1The abbreviations used are: wc, white collar; NDK-1, nucleoside diphosphate kinase-1; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SOD, superoxide dismutase; RT, reverse transcriptase; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: wc, white collar; NDK-1, nucleoside diphosphate kinase-1; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SOD, superoxide dismutase; RT, reverse transcriptase; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid.-1 and wc-2, deficient in most of these blue light responses, have been isolated (4Degli-Innocenti F. Russo V.E. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 757-761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lauter F.R. J. Genet. 1996; 75: 375-386Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Linden H. Rodriguez-Franco M. Macino M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The products for these genes are photoreceptors that can activate transcription. Both possess a PAS (PER, ARNT, and SIM) domain, a zinc finger DNA binding motif, and a glutamine-rich putative transcription activation domain (12Ballario P. Vittorioso P. Margrelli A. Talora C. Cabibbo A. Macino G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1650-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 13Linden H. Macino G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 98-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). WC proteins form heterodimers presumably through their PAS domains (14Ballario P. Talora C. Galli D. Linden H. Macino G. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 15Cheng P. Yang Y. Gardner K.H. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), having promoter binding activity of blue light-regulated genes in Neurospora crassa. In Arabidopsis thaliana, three major groups of photoreceptors, phytochromes (16Quail P.H. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), cryptochromes (17Ahmad M. Jarillo J.A. Smirnova O. Cashmore A.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 939-948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and phototropins (18Briggs W.R. Huala E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 33-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), have been identified. Phototropins have two LOV (light, oxygen, and voltage) domains, and bind FMN (flavin mononucleotide) as a chromophore (19Christie J.M. Briggs W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11457-11460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). WC-1 also has one LOV domain, which is a putative chromophore-binding site. The WC-1·WC-2 complex is reported to bind FAD (flavin-adenine dinucleotide) (20He Q. Cheng P. Yang Y. Wang L. Gardner K.H. Liu Y. Science. 2002; 297: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Blue light-responsive albino genes, al-1, al-2, and al-3, which encode enzymes for the synthesis of carotenoids (21Nelson M.A. Morelli G. Carattoli A. Romano N. Macino G. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6883-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and blue light inducible genes bli-4 and bli-6 are transcriptionally activated after blue illumination of mycelia (25Bruchez J.J. Eberle J. Kohler W. Kruft V. Radford A. Russo V.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 223-229PubMed Google Scholar). No light-induced accumulation in al-1, al-2, al-3, or con-10 transcripts in the mycelia was observed in either wc-1 or wc-2 mutants (21Nelson M.A. Morelli G. Carattoli A. Romano N. Macino G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1271-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 23Schmidhauser T.J. Lauter F.R. Schumacher M. Zhou W. Russo V.E. Yanofsky C. J. Biol.

Schmidhauser T.J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 90-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). WC proteins have the capacity to bind the promoter element, GATA motif, of the al-3 gene in vitro (12Ballario P. Vittorioso P. Margrelli A. Talora C. Cabibbo A. Macino G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1650-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 13Linden H. Macino G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 98-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In light-inducible carotenogenesis in N. crassa, there is a phenomenon called adaptation (27Baima S. Macino G. Morelli G. J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1991; 11: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the wild type, al-3 mRNA is transiently expressed in the mycelia under light. The accumulation of al-3 mRNA reached a peak at 30 min after illumination, and decreased to the level in darkness after 1 h even in the presence of light. For this light adaptation, VIVID (VVD) protein, a candidate for a photoreceptor possessing LOV domain has been suggested to function as a negative regulator of WC-1 protein (28Heintzen C. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Cell. 2001; 104: 453-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 29Cheng P. He Q. Yang Y. Wang L. Liu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5938-5943Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). WC proteins play a critical role in the blue light signal transduction and light responses, such as carotenoid synthesis in the mycelia through transcriptional activation (30Linden H. Science. 2002; 297: 777-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, Dragovic et al. (31Dragovic Z. Tan Y. Gorl M. Roenneberg T. Merrow M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3643-3651Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) showed that the wc-1, wc-2, and wc-1 wc-2 mutants showed self-sustained rhythmic banding of conidiation and resetting by light. These results indicated that there is a novel light receptor other than WC-1 and WC-2 in N. crassa. In Fusarium aquaeductuum, the accumulation of carotenoid increased in the mycelia treated with methylene blue or toluidine blue under red light, although the fungus was thought to be insensitive to this spectrum of light (32Lang-Feulner J. Rau W. Photochem. Photobiol. 1975; 21: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In Phaffia rhodozyma, singlet oxygen induced the carotenoid synthesis (33Schroeder W.A. Johnson E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18374-18379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). These results suggested a relation between the intracellular redox state and light-induced carotenogenesis. Previously, we have isolated nucleoside diphosphate kinase-1 (NDK-1), as a novel candidate for a light signal-transducing factor other than WC proteins in N. crassa (7Ogura Y. Yoshida Y. Yabe N. Hasunuma K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21228-21234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 34Oda K. Hasunuma K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The ndk-1P72H mutant with reduced protein kinase activity showed a deficiency in the light response for perithecial polarity. In the present study, we investigate reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by light that could serve as factors to control redox state functioning as controlling factors for redundant pathways of light signal transduction. To test these possibilities, we tried to address the relationship between photomorphogenesis and ROS using a sod-1 mutant of N. crassa, defective in Cu,Zn-superoxide disumutase (Cu,Zn-SOD) (35Chary P. Dillon D. Schroeder A.L. Natvig D.O. Genetics. 1994; 137: 723-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and found that light-induced phenomena, including carotenoid synthesis, in the mycelia of the sod-1 mutant are markedly affected. Moreover light-induced transcription of genes involved in carotenoid synthesis was sustained in the sod-1 mutant, under conditions where the expression of these genes was transient in the wild type. Strains of Neurospora crassa—Strains of N. crassa used in this study were obtained from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center (Department of Microbiology, University of Kansas Medical Center, KS) and included the standard wild type; 74-OR23-1A (FGSC number 987), a Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD-1) null mutant, sod-1 (FGSC numbers 7437 and 7438), vvd (FGSC number 7854), wc-1 (FGSC number 4445), and wc-2 (FGSC number 3818), and a sod-1 mutant was obtained after crossing of FGSC number 7437) three times into wild type; 74-OR23-1a (FGSC number 988). NDK-1 missense mutant, ndk-1P72H (FGSC number 8416), was described by Ogura et al. (7Ogura Y. Yoshida Y. Yabe N. Hasunuma K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21228-21234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The wc-2 mutant (FGSC number 3818) produces a truncated WC-2 protein lacking the zinc finger motif (13Linden H. Macino G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 98-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 31Dragovic Z. Tan Y. Gorl M. Roenneberg T. Merrow M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3643-3651Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although the mutation in the wc-1 mutant (FGSC number 4445) used in this study has unknown characteristics, it is a loss of function mutant in the light-dependent carotenoid synthesis. The sod-1;ndk-1P72H double mutant was generated by crossing sod-1 (FGSC number 7437) with ndk-1P72H (FGSC number 8416). The sod-1; wc-1 double mutant was obtained by crossing sod-1 (FGSC number 7437) with wc-1 (FGCS number 4445). The sod-1 wc-2 double mutant was obtained by crossing sod-1 (FGSC number 7437) with wc-2 (FGCS number 3818). The sod-1;vvd double mutant was obtained by crossing sod-1 (FGSC number 7437) with vvd (FGSC number 7854). In the screening of double mutants, the sod-1 mutation was detected by SOD activity assay and Northern analysis for the expression of sod-1 mRNA. Each strain was grown on a glycerol complete slant medium (36Tatum E.L. Barratt R.W. Fries N. Bonner D. Am. J. Bot. 1950; 37: 437-440Crossref Google Scholar) for 1 week at 25 °C. Analysis of Perithecial Polarity—Perithecial polarity was analyzed as described by Oda and Hasunuma (6Oda K. Hasunuma K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The sod-1 mutant (FGSC number 7437) was incubated in darkness at 25 °C on synthetic crossing medium for 5 days and fertilized with sod-1 (FGSC number 7438) conidia. After 3 days in darkness, the fertilized cultures were placed in a box with a slit 4 cm wide and illuminated directionally under 12-h light (20 μE m-2 s-1)/12-h dark regime for 2 weeks. Perithecia were observed and photographed through a dissecting microscope. In this article, perithecial polarity refers only those perithecia with the beak formed upward. Light-induced perithecial polarity is defined as the difference of those between under illumination and in darkness. Quantification of Mycelial Carotenoid Accumulation—Conidia (1 × 106) were inoculated into 20 ml of Vogel's minimal medium in 8.5-cm Petri dishes. The dishes were incubated at 30 °C for 36 h in darkness, and then exposed to light (20 μE m-2 s-1) for 0.5, 1.5, 3, 10, and 15 h. After the exposure, mycelia were harvested on filter paper by vacuum filtration. Carotenoid accumulation was determined essentially as described by Linden et al. (11Linden H. Rodriguez-Franco M. Macino M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Dried mycelia (50 mg) were extracted in 3 ml of methanol for 30 min at 60 °C. After filtration, the mycelia were re-extracted with 3 ml of acetone for 30 min at 50 °C. The methanol/acetone fraction was collected by centrifugation and the spectral absorption at 470 nm was determined. In the experiments with antioxidants after incubation at 30 °C for 36 h in darkness, the mycelia were treated with 1 mm N-acetyl-l-cysteine (37Weinander R. Anderson C. Morgenstern R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 71-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 1,3-dimethylurea (38Fischer L.J. Hamburger S.A. Life Sci. 1980; 26: 1405-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), or n-propyl gallate (39Wu T.W. Fung K.P. Zeng L.H. Wu J. Nakamura H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) at 30 °C for 1 h in darkness. After exposure to light for 2 h, mycelial carotenoids were extracted and the content was determined. N-Acetylglycine, an analogue of N-acetyl-l-cysteine with no antioxidation activity, was used as a control. Northern Blot Analysis—After mycelia were incubated at 30 °C for 36 h in darkness, they were transferred to light (20 μE m-2 s-1) for 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 h. Mycelia were harvested as described. In N-acetyl-l-cysteine treatment, after incubating for 36 h at 30 °C, the mycelia were incubated with 1 mm N-acetyl-l-cysteine for 1 h. Mycelia were exposed to light for an additional 1 h. In the cycloheximide treatment, after the mycelia were incubated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, mycelia were exposed to light for 15 min. The treated mycelia were homogenized with a pestle and mortar in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was prepared by a small-scale RNA extraction method (40Sokolovsky V. Kaldenhoff R. Ricci M. Russo V.E.A. Fungal Genet. Newslett. 1990; 67: 41-43Google Scholar). Total RNA (5 μg) was separated by glyoxal-gel electrophoresis and transferred to a piece of GeneScreen Plus membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Probes for al-1, al-2, al-3, bli-4, con-10, and β-tub were amplified by PCR, using N. crassa genomic DNA as a template. The primers used for the PCR were as follows: al-1/forward: 5′-ccgggtctcttccgcgaga-3′, al- 1/reverse: 5′-aatcttctcatccatctccttcctcat-3′; al-2/forward: 5′-ccaccagaagccattgttgggcgg-3′, al-2/reverse: 5′-aatgacctggggaccctcggggt-3′; al-3/forward: 5′-acctggacccgcccgcttt-3′, al-3/reverse: 5′-agctgcctgtgctctccatatacgcc-3′; bli-4/forward: 5′-actgaatcccgctacctggcc-3′, bli-4/reverse: 5′-gctctgcgcaaggtcagtgcc-3′; con-10/forward: 5′-atggctggcactggtaacgagaac-3′, con-10/reverse: 5′-ctcatcgtcgtcggcaccagt-3′; β-tub/forward: 5′-tccggcaacaacaagtatgtccctcgt-3′, β-tub/reverse: 5′-ggcagtgaactgctcgccgat-3′. Hybridization with 32P-labeled probes was carried out overnight at 60 °C using Church's phosphate buffer (41Church G.M. Kieffer-Higgins S. Science. 1988; 240: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Radioisotopic signals were visualized by autoradiography using X-Omat AR film (Kodak). RT-PCR—The abundance of wc-1 mRNA was detected by RT-PCR analysis. Total RNA prepared from mycelia exposed to light (20 μE m-2 s-1) for 30 min was treated with DNase I, RT-PCR grade (Invitrogen). Total RNA (5 μg) and 1 μl of oligo(dT)12-18 primer (100 pmol) were denatured in 12 μl of reaction solution for 5 min at 65 °C and were annealed on ice. First strand cDNA was synthesized with the use of 1 μl of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) for 50 min at 42 °C to generate single stranded cDNA. The RT reaction mixture (1 μl) was mixed with 50 pmol of wc-1/forward: 5′-cccgggttatccgcaacaacacagacaata-3′, wc-1/reverse: 5′-gagctctttgcgccaacaaaaacgtt-3′ primer in 10 μl of reverse transcriptase reaction buffer (50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm of each dNTP and 0.2 units of Taq polymerase) and incubated for 2 min at 95 °C. PCR was performed using the following program: 95 °C (30 s), 60 °C (30 s), and 72 °C (2 min) for 20 cycles with a final 7 min of extension at 72 °C. Amplified products were separated by 0.8% TAE-agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to a piece of GeneScreen Plus membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Amplified wc-1 was detected by Southern hybridization using wc-1 probe. The relative amount of mRNA for each band was determined with the NIH Image program (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Enzyme Activity Assays for SOD—One ml of conidial suspension (106 conidia/ml) was inoculated into 50 ml of Vogel's minimal medium with 2% sucrose in 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks. After the cultures were shaken (200 rpm) at 25 °C for 24 h, they were harvested under room light (0.6 μE m-2 s-1). The mycelia were disrupted in 2 volumes of ice-cold extraction buffer (25 mm Pipes/NaOH, pH 6.3, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.25 m sucrose, 0.01 mm leupeptin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The homogenized cell suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant (100 μg of total proteins) were loaded onto 6% native polyacrylamide slab gels. After electrophoresis, SOD activity was determined by immersing the gels in 1 mm nitro blue tetrazolium for 20 min at room temperature, followed by an immersion in a solution containing 28 mm tetramethylethylenediamine, 28 μm riboflavin, and 36 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, for 15 min under room light (42Chary P. Natvig D.O. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2646-2652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SOD activity was visualized as a band where superoxide was decomposed by SOD. Light-dependent Carotenoid Accumulation in the sod-1 Mutant—To investigate the interaction between the response of light and ROS in N. crassa, we examined light-dependent carotenoid accumulation in mycelia of the sod-1 mutant. In the experiment to quantify mycelial carotenoid, mycelia were harvested in a growing phase prior to conidiation, because carotenoid accumulation in conidia occurs independent of the light response. The light-insensitive mutant, wc-1, was used as a negative control of light response. The sod-1 mutant showed an accelerated light-dependent induction of carotenoid accumulation in the mycelia compared with the wild type (Fig. 1, A and B). Levels of mycelial carotenoids in the sod-1 mutant were detectable after 1.5 h of illumination (Fig. 1A). The sod-1 mutant showed no significant difference in carotenoid accumulation after 15 h of illumination, whereas, the wc-1 mutant failed to produce mycelial carotenoid. A vvd mutant also showed the enhancement of light-inducible carotenoid accumulation in the mycelia (43Shrode L.B. Lewis Z.A. White L.D. Bell-Pedersen D. Ebbole D.J. Fungal Genet. Biol. 2001; 32: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The rate of carotenoid accumulation in the sod-1 mutant was higher than that in the vvd mutant at the early period (3 h) of illumination (Fig. 1B). However, the vvd mutant continued to accumulate carotenoid ∼1.5-fold that in the sod-1 mutant after 15 h of illumination (Fig. 1B). Expression of Light-inducible Genes in Wild Type and the sod-1 Mutant—The sod-1 mutant showed an increase in the initial rate of light-inducible carotenoid accumulation (Fig. 1). This could result from expression of the carotenoid biosynthetic genes. To test whether ROS regulate the transcription of genes in carotenoid biosynthesis, we analyzed the accumulation of light-inducible gene transcripts after illumination for 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 h by Northern blot analysis. In this study, we used al-1, al-2, and al-3, which are light-inducible genes that specify carotenoid synthetic enzymes. We also used bli-4, con-10, and wc-1, which are typical blue light-inducible genes in N. crassa. In the wild type, the expression of all six of these genes is transient, even after constant illumination (Fig. 2, WT). The abundance of al-1, -2, -3, bli-4, and wc-1 mRNA showed a rapid increase and reached a maximum after illumination for 30 min, and decreased rapidly after 1 h, forming a transient expression pattern. However, the expression of con-10 reached a maximum at 60 min, and decreased gradually. In the sod-1 mutant, the mRNAs of al-1, -2, -3, and bli-4 showed increases in response to light stimulation compared with those in the wild type and a more sustained expression pattern (Fig. 2, A and B). However, the accumulation of mRNA for con-10 showed no significant difference from that of the wild type. The vvd mutant showed the expression of the al-1 gene, which was sustained compared with that in the wild type (44Schwerdtfeger C. Linden H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1080-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, the peak of al-1 transcript accumulation in the vvd mutant was 1 h after illumination, and was different than that in the sod-1 mutant (Fig. 2, A and B). We quantified the wc-1 accumulation by a RT-PCR method followed by Southern blot analysis in the sod-1 and vvd mutants. Significantly more of the light-inducible wc-1 mRNA accumulated in the sod-1 and vvd mutant than in wild type (Fig. 2C). Effects of Antioxidants on Light-inducible Carotenoid Synthesis and Gene Expression—In the sod-1 mutant, the concentration of intracellular superoxide anion radical, O2·¯ is maintained at a higher level than in wild type by the lack of Cu,Zn-SOD. To test whether the increase in carotenoid accumulation is caused by intracellular ROS, the effect of antioxidants on light-inducible carotenoid synthesis was examined. We used N-acetyl-l-cysteine (37Weinander R. Anderson C. Morgenstern R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 71-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 1,3-dimethylurea (38Fischer L.J. Hamburger S.A. Life Sci. 1980; 26: 1405-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and n-propyl gallate (39Wu T.W. Fung K.P. Zeng L.H. Wu J. Nakamura H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) as antioxidants. N-Acetyl-l-glycine, which has no antioxidative effect, was used as a control for the N-acetyl-l-cysteine. Each antioxidant was used at a final concentration of 1 mm. This concentration had no inhibitory effect on the mycelial growth (data not shown). The mycelia were treated with each reagent for 1 h in darkness and then were exposed to light for 2 h, and mycelial carotenoids were measured. The accumulation of carotenoids after antioxidant treatment followed by illumination was suppressed by about 40-50% compared with the control experiments in both wild type and the sod-1 mutant (Fig. 3A). Next, we examined the effect of antioxidant on light-inducible gene expression in the sod-1 mutant. After co-incubation with N-acetyl-l-cysteine for 1 h, the mycelia were exposed to light for 1 h. Light-inducible accumulation of al-1 mRNA was determined by Northern blot analysis. The accumulation of al-1 mRNA in the mycelia treated with N-acetyl-l-cysteine was suppressed by about 40% of that observed in the sample without it (Fig. 3B). The increases in the accumulation of al-1, -2, -3, and bli-4 mRNAs in the sod-1 mutant may be dependent on the newly expressed wc-1 gene products after illumination (Fig. 2C). To test whether al-1 are under the control of de novo synthesized WC-1, we examined the effect of cycloheximide inhibiting de novo protein synthesis on the light-inducible accumulation of al-1 mRNA in wild type and the sod-1 mutant. After treatment with cycloheximide for 1 h, light-inducible accumulation of al-1 mRNA in the mycelia exposed to light for 15 min was assessed by Northern blot analysis. The increase in the accumulation of al-1 mRNA in the sod-1 mutant was not affected by the treatment with cycloheximide (Fig. 4). These results suggested that increases in the accumulation of light-inducible mRNAs in the sod-1 mutant do not require de novo synthesis of a protein component such as WC-1 and VVD. Genetic Analysis of the Light-inducible Carotenoid Synthesis Using the sod-1;wc-1, sod-1 wc-2, and sod-1;vvd Double Mutants—The expression of the al-1, -2, and -3 genes is regulated downstream of the WC protein signaling cascade (12Ballario P. Vittorioso P. Margrelli A. Talora C. Cabibbo A. Macino G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1650-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 13Linden H. Macino G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 98-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The sod-1 mutant showed a higher level of accumulation of light-inducible genes (Fig. 2). The intracellular ROS may act to stimulate carotenoid synthesis via WC proteins. To test this possibility, we observed the carotenoid synthesis in sod-1;wc-1 and sod-1 wc-2 double mutants compared with the wc-1 and wc-2 single mutants. These double mutants series, the sod-1; wc-1, sod-1 wc-2, and sod-1;vvd mutants, showed the lack of Cu, Zn SOD (Fig. 5A). In continuous darkness, wild type and the sod-1 mutant accumulated low levels of the carotenoids in mycelia compared with that of the wc-1 and wc-2 mutants (Fig. 5C). The double mutants, sod-1;wc-1 and sod-1 wc-2, also failed to synthesize carotenoid after illumination (Fig. 5, B and C). These results indicate that the effects of ROS depended on the function of WC proteins. Furthermore, a double mutant between sod-1 and vvd, sod-1;vvd, showed an additive effect on light-dependent carotenoid synthesis (Fig. 5B). The sod-1;vvd mutant showed 2-fold carotenoid accumulation compared with that of the vvd mutant after 2 h of illumination. This result suggests that there may be a parallel relationship between sod-1 and vvd in the pathway to induce the carotenoid synthesis. Light-inducible Perithecial Polarity in the sod-1 Mutant—We next investigated a light-responsive phenotype other than carotenoid synthesis in the sod-1 mutant. Previously, we found that the perithecial polarity was controlled by illumination, because the perithecial beaks corresponding to 80-90% of total perithecia are formed upward o"

The experimental approach was to first separate the multimers (molecular mass >90 kDa) as individual spots by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and next analyze compositions of each multimers by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight and electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometric (ES-MS/MS) methods. The WI proteins from lenses of 25- and 41-year-old subjects showed distinct 5- and 16-multimer spots on two-dimensional gels, respectively, but the spots from 52- and 72-year-old lenses were non-descript and diffused. ES-MS/MS analyses showed two types of covalent multimers in 25- and 41-year-old lenses, i.e. the first type composed of fragments of eight different crystallins (i.e. αA, αB, βA3, βA4, βB1, βB2, γS, and γD), and the second type of α-, β-, and γ-crystallins (possibly fragments) and two beaded filament proteins (phakinin and filensin). The most commonly identified species in the complexes of 41-year-old lenses were: αA-fragment (C-terminally truncated, residues 1–157), αB-fragment (residues 83–90), βB1-crystallin (residues 60–71), βA3 (residues 33–44), βA4 (residues 106–117), filensin (residues 78–90), and phakinin (residues 77–89). Three post-translational modifications (i.e. oxidation of Met and Trp, conversion of Ser to dehydroalanine, and formylation of His) were observed in αA-crystallin fragment, and the first two modifications could cross-link proteins. Together, the results suggested that covalent multimers appeared early in life (i.e. 25 years of age) and increased in number with aging, and the two beaded filament proteins form covalent complexes with crystallin fragments in vivo.

Together, the results suggested that covalent multimers appeared early in life (i.e. 25 years of age) and increased in number with aging, and the two beaded filament proteins form covalent complexes with crystallin fragments in vivo. Mammalian lens contains three major structural proteins that are known as α-, β-, and γ-crystallins. Among these, the α- and β-crystallins exist as oligomers, whereas the γ-crystallin as a monomer. The αA- and αB-crystallins, the two subunits and primary gene products of α-crystallin, aggregate to form 800,000-Da oligomers, whereas β- and γ-crystallins originated via gene duplication and form a superfamily. These structural proteins, by virtue of their special structural interactions and high concentrations, contribute to the transparency of the lens and provide refractive index to focus light on to the retina. With aging, crystallins show aggregation, cross-linking, and water insolubilization. Together, these processes contribute to the development of age-related lens opacity. Presently, the sequence of events that lead to development of opacity is not well understood. However, evidence suggests that a variety of post-translational modifications in crystallins lead to their aggregation, cross-linking, and eventually water insolubilization. Because of several of the post-translational modifications simultaneously occur during aging in the native, aggregated, and water-insoluble crystallins, the identification of a single or combination of potential modifications as the initiating factor in the aggregation and insolubilization process of crystallins remains unclear. Consequently, it is now believed that lens opacity may involve a multifactorial mechanism. To understand the cataractogenic process, lens researchers have attempted to determine how these post-translational modifications lead to aggregation and water insolubilization of crystallins.

Previous studies showed that the modifications of crystallins that may contribute to aggregation and cross-linking included disulfide bonding (3Takemoto L. Exp.

The relative importance of the modifications and their specificity to either aging and/or cataractogenic processes is not well established. However, certain cataract-specific modifications (i.e. not observed or occurring at relatively lower levels during aging) have been identified, which included increased degradation of α-crystallin in diabetic cataracts (12Jimenez-Asensio J. Colvis C.M. Kowalak J.A. Duglas-Tabor Y. Datiles M.B. Meroni M. Mura U. Rao C.M. Balasubraminian D. Janjani A. Garland D. J. Biol.

Vis. 2000; 6: 164-168PubMed Google Scholar). The proportion of WI proteins increase in human lenses with aging and more so during cataract development (15Clark R. Zigman S. Lehrman S. Exp. Eye Res. 1969; 8: 172-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and the age-related water insolubilization of crystallins might be mediated via a precursor complex known as water-soluble, high molecular weight (HMW) proteins (16Jedziniak J.A. Nicoli D.F. Baram H. Benedek G.B. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1978; 17: 51-57PubMed Google Scholar). One approach to determine the relative importance of different modifications in cross-linking of crystallins is to ascertain their presence in the species that form water-insoluble covalent multimers. The composition of the WI proteins has shown that several aggregated species increase in concentration and become water-insoluble with aging and cataractogenesis and show the modifications as described above (1Lund A.L. Smith J.B. Smith D.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1996; 63: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 2Hanson S.R. Hasan A. Smith D.L. Smith J.B. Exp. Eye Res. 2000; 71: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The potential mechanisms that cause crystallin cross-linking during the cataractogenic process are identified, which included transglutaminase-mediated cross-linking (17Shridas P. Sharma Y. Balasubraminian D. FEBS Lett. 2001; 499: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), glycation-induced cross-linking (4Nagaraj R.H. Sell D.R. Prabhakaram M. Ortwerth B.J. Monnier V.M. Proc.

Eye Res. 1995; 60: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Together, these complexes may represent the supramolecular species in the lens, previously identified in vivo as 0.12- to 0.9-μm particles with an estimated molecular mass of 2 × 109 Da by NMR spectroscopy (23Morgan C.F Schleich T. Caines G.H. Farnsworth P.N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5064-5074Google Scholar) and by quasielastic light scattering (24Benedeck G.B. Chylack L.T. Libondi T. Pennett M. Curr. Eye Res. 1987; 6: 1421-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As stated above, an intermediate state between WS proteins and WI proteins is believed to be the WS-HMW proteins, which is shown to exist in vivo by the light-scattering method (16Jedziniak J.A. Nicoli D.F. Baram H. Benedek G.B. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1978; 17: 51-57PubMed Google Scholar). The constituents of the WS-HMW proteins have been reported (16Jedziniak J.A. Nicoli D.F. Baram H. Benedek G.B. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1978; 17: 51-57PubMed Google Scholar, 25Jedziniak J. Kinoshita J.H. Yates E.M. Benedeck G.B. Exp.

Silney C. Curr. Eye Res. 1996; 15: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), but it provided little information regarding the mechanism of aggregation and cross-linking during the conversion of WS proteins to WS-HMW proteins. This was because the covalent multimers are difficult to isolate from the aging and cataractous lenses. The purpose of this study was to identify covalent multimers with a molecular mass of >90 kDa in the WI proteins of aging human lenses. The experimental approach was to first separate the multimers as individual spots by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (isoelectric focusing in the first dimension followed by SDS-PAGE in the second dimension) and then to analyze the single multimer spots by MALDI-TOF and ES-MS/MS mass spectrometric methods. Because our results showed that the covalent multimers are increasingly cross-linked, non-descript, and difficult to isolate as single species in the older human lenses (age > 40 years), the present study was focused on WI multimers from younger lenses of 25–40 years. The results presented show for the first time that two different types of covalent multimers exist in the aging human lenses (i.e. one composed of only the crystallin fragments and the other of crystallins and two beaded filament proteins (filensin and phakinin)). Additionally, three specific post-translational modifications in the components of multimers (i.e. oxidation of Met and Trp, conversion of Ser to dehydroalanine, and formylation of His) were identified. These modifications might be causative factors for the crystallin cross-linking to form multimer species. Materials—Normal human lenses with no apparent opacity were obtained from Dr. Robert Church of the Emory University or from the Shared Ocular Tissue Module at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The lenses were retrieved within 48–72 h post-mortem, and stored in medium-199 without phenol red at –20 °C until used. The prestained and unstained molecular weight protein markers were from Invitrogen and Amersham Biosciences, respectively. The chemicals for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were from either Amersham Biosciences or Bio-Rad. Unless indicated otherwise, all other chemicals used in this study were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) or Fisher (Atlanta, GA) companies. Isolation of WS and WI Protein Fractions from Normal Human Lenses and Their Analysis by Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis— Normal human lenses without any opacity from donors of 25, 41, 52, and 72 years of age were used to isolate WS and WI protein fractions by a procedure as previously described (26Srivastava O.P. Exp. Eye Res. 1988; 47: 525-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 27Srivastava O.P. Srivastava K. Silney C. Curr. Eye Res. 1996; 15: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Lenses were thawed on ice, decapsulated, suspended (2 ml/lens) in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm iodoacetamide (a cysteine proteinase inhibitor), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (a serine proteinase inhibitor)), and homogenized using a tissue grinder. Following centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 15 min of the lens homogenate, the supernatant was recovered, the pellet was homogenized and centrifuged as above, and the process was repeated twice. The three supernatants after each centrifugation were pooled and designated as water-soluble (WS) protein fraction, and the pellet was designated as the water-insoluble (WI) protein fraction. The WI proteins from lenses of individual ages were dissolved in the resolubilization buffer (28Herbert B. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 660-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) (5 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% CHAPS, 2% caprylyl sulfobetaine, 2 mm tributylphosphine, 40 mm Tris, pH 8.0). Each preparation was subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (IEF in the first dimension and SDS-PAGE in the second dimension). The IEF separation was carried out using Immoboline Dry Strips (pH range of 3–10) and by following the manufacturer's suggested method (Amersham Biosciences). The second dimension SDS-PAGE was performed by using the Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) method. Prior to the first IEF analysis, the desired WI protein fraction was incubated overnight with dry strips at room temperature. Following the IEF separation, the strips were consecutively treated for 15 min each, first with 100 mm dithiothreitol (in equilibration buffer: 0.1 m Tris, pH 6.8, containing 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, and 1% SDS) and next with 300 mm iodoacetamide (also dissolved in equilibration buffer). During SDS-PAGE, a 15% polyacrylamide gel of 16 × 14 cm (width × height) was used. The protein spots on a gel were stained with Coomassie Blue. Analysis of Multimers by Mass Spectrometric Methods—For mass spectrometric analyses, the protein spots were individually excised from a polyacrylamide gel using pipette microtips. The polyacrylamide pieces containing a spot was washed with doubly distilled water and destained after treating with ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile. Trypsin solution (12 ng/μl) was added, and the preparation was resuspended in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8. The samples were digested by trypsin (sequencing grade from Roche Applied Science) at 37 °C overnight, and the next day they were analyzed by using the MALDI-TOF method (Perspective Biosciences, Model Voyager-DE2 PRO). The MALDI analysis and ES-MS/MS sequencing (Micromass QTOF-2) were performed at the Comprehensive Cancer Center Mass Spectrometric Shared Facility of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) identity of proteins was established by using the NCBInr data base of Matrix Science. During the ES-MS/MS analysis of the tryptic fragments, the data base of the Proteinlynx Global Server was used along with manual interpretations as needed in certain cases. Protein concentration was determined by a modified method of Lowry using the Pierce protein determination kit. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoretic Analyses of WI Protein Fractions from Lenses of Different Ages—The two-dimensional gel profiles of WI protein fractions from lenses of 25-, 41-, 52-, and 72-year-old donors are shown in Fig. 1. The α-, β-, and γ-crystallins (molecular mass between 20–35 kDa) and their fragments (molecular mass < 20 kDa) were predominately present in the two-dimensional gel profiles of these lenses. Several minor spots with molecular mass >35 kDa were also seen in these lenses, which became increasingly more complex and non-descript with aging. However, although some of these were separated as single spots in the WI protein fractions of 25- and 41-year-old lenses (shown with arrows in Fig. 1, A and B), they remained diffused and non-descript in the lenses from 52- and 70-year-old donors (Fig. 1, C and D). Because the focus of this investigation was to characterize individual covalent multimers, the single spots with molecular mass >90 kDa from lenses of only 25- and 41-year-old donors were chosen for their compositional analysis by MALDI-TOF and ES-MS/MS methods. As shown in Fig. 2A, five major spots (numbered as 1 to 5) were identified in the WI protein fraction of lenses from 25-year-old donors, whereas 16 spots were present in the 41-year-old lenses. The central region of each spot was excised and digested with trypsin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Next, the tryptic fragments were analyzed by the MALDI-TOF method followed by their amino acid sequence analysis by ES-MS/MS method using Micromass-QTOF2. The amino acid sequences of the tryptic fragments from lenses of a 25-year-old donor revealed that the single multimer spots were either made of several crystallin fragments or α-, β-, and γ-crystallins and filensin and/or phakinin (the two beaded filament proteins) (Table I). Among the five major spots (molecular mass >90 kDa) in the WI protein fraction of 25-year-old lenses, spot 1 was of filensin, spot 2 was a mixture of fragments of αA and filensin, spot 3 was a mixture of fragments of eight different crystallins (αA-, αB-, βA3-, βA4-, βB1-, βB2-, γS-, and γD-crystallins), and spot 4 was a complex of αA-crystallin and filensin. As stated above, these identifications were based on the amino acid sequences of the tryptic fragments of individual spots by the ES-MS/MS analysis (see below). Among the 16 spots observed in the WI protein fraction of lenses of 41-year-old donors, the amino acid sequences of tryptic fragments showed that these were multimeric complexes of intact or fragments of crystallins and filensin and phakinin. The details of the ES-MS/MS analyses of these spots are described below.Table IIdentification of composition of multimers in WI protein fraction of lenses from 25- and 41-year-old donorsSpot numberComposition of multimersaThe composition was based on sequence determination of tryptic fragments by ES-MS/MS using Micromass QTOF-2.25-Year-old lenses1Filensin2αA and filensin3αA, αB, βA3, βA4, βB1, βB2, γS, and γD4αA and filensin41-Year-old lenses3αA, βB1, βA4, filensin, and phakinin5αA, βB1, βA4, and filensin6αA, αB, βA3, filensin, and phakinin7αA, αB, βB1, γS, and phakinin8αA, αB, βA3, βA4, filensin, and phakinin9αA, αB, βA3, filensin, and phakinin13αA, αB, βA4, filensin, and phakinin14αA, αB, βA3, βA4, βB1, and filensin15αA, βA4, and filensin16αA and filensina The composition was based on sequence determination of tryptic fragments by ES-MS/MS using Micromass QTOF-2.

The fact that residues 79–239 of filensin were seen as a complex with molecular mass >90 kDa, suggested that the protein was truncated.Table IIAmino acid sequences of components forming covalent multimers in lenses from a 25-year-old donorSpot numberα-CrystallinCrystallins β and γFilensin1LGELAGPEDALAR (#223-239)LNKEADEALLHNLR (#144-157)SQLEEGREVLSHLQAQR (#223-239)2αA: Ac-MDVTIQHPWFK (#1-11, oxidized Met and Trp)aResidue numbers are shown in parentheses.LGELAGPEDALAR (#78-90)αA: DVTIQHPWFKR (#2-12)SQLEEGREVLSHLQAQR (#223-239)αA: TLGPFYPSR (#13-22)αA: TVLDSGISEVR (#55-65)αA: SDRDKFVIFLDVK (#66-78)αA: HFSPEDLTVK (#79-88)αA: HFSPEDLTVKVQDDFVEIHGK (#79-99)αA: VQDDFVEIHGK (#89-99)αA: IQTGLDATHAER (#146-157)αA: TGLDATHAER (#148-157)3αA: TLGPFYPSR (#13-22)βA3: ITIYDQENFQGKR (#33-45)αA: HFSPEDLTVK (#79-88)βA3: WDAWSGSNAYHIER (#96-109)αB: APSWFDTGLSEMR (#57-69, oxidized Met)βA3: MTIFEKNFIGR (#126-137)αB: APSWFDTGLSEMLEK (#57-72)βA4: MVVWDEDGFQGR (#13-24, oxidized Met)αB: HFSPEELK (#83-90)βA4: LTIFEQENFLGK (#106-117)αB: DRFSVNLDVK (#73-82)βB1: LVVFELENFQGR (#60-71)αB: QDEHGFISR (#108-116)βB1: VSSGTWVGYQYPGYR (#187-201)αB: IPADVDPLTITSSLSSDGVLTVNGPR (#124-149)βB1: ISLFEGANFK (#150-159)βB1: GYQYLLEPGDFR (#202-213)βB2: VQSGTWVGYQYPGYR (#145-159)γS: ITFYEDKNFQGR (#7-18)γS: AVHLPSGGQYQK (#84-94)γS: QYLLDKK (#148-154)γS: KPIDWGAASPAVQSFR (#158-173)γD: QYLLMPGDYR (#143-152)4αA: TLGPFYPSR (#15-21)LGELAGPEDALAR (#78-90)αA: TVLDSGISEVR (#55-65)a Residue numbers are shown in parentheses. Open table in a new tab Spot 2 was a covalent complex of αA-crystallin and filensin, because ES-MS/MS analysis showed that it contained tryptic peptides with matching amino acid sequences of both proteins. The following tryptic peptide sequences of αA-crystallin were seen in spot 2: Ac-MDVTIQHPWFK (residues 1–11, oxidized Met, and Trp with none, one or two oxygen), DVTIQHPWFKR (residues 2–12), TLGPFYPSR9 (residues 13–22), TVLDSGISEVR (residues 55–65), SDRDKFVIFLDVK (residues 66–78), HFSPEDLTVK (residues 79–88), HFSPEDLTVKVQDDFVEIHGK (residues 79–99), VQDDFVEIHGK (residues 89–103), IQTGLDATHAER (residues 146–157), and TGLDATHAER (residues 148–157). Similarly, spot 2 contained two filensin tryptic peptides with sequences of LGELAGPEDALAR (residues 78–90) and SQLEEGREVLSHLQAQR (#223–239). Together, the sequence data of the tryptic peptides suggested that the complex contained C-terminally truncated αA-crystallin (residues 1–157) and a filensin fragment (residues 79–239). Because the molecular mass of the complex was ∼90 kDa, the complex might be containing fragments instead of complete sequences of the two proteins. Spot 3 was a multimer made of fragments of eight different crystallins (Table II), suggesting that crystallin fragments per se could cross-link to form a multimer complex. The ES-MS/MS analysis identified tryptic peptide sequences that overlapped with the sequences of αA-, αB-, βA3-, βA4-, βB1-, βB2-, γS-, and γD-crystallins. The complex showed the presence of two tryptic peptide sequences of αA-crystallin: TLGPFYPSR (residues 13–21) and HFSPEDLTVK (residues 79–88), and six tryptic peptides of αB-crystallin with sequences of: APSWFDTGLSEMR (oxidized Met residues 57–69), APSWFDTGLSEMRLEK (residue 57–72), HFSPEELK (residues 83–90), DRFSVNLDVK (residues 73–82), QDEHGFISR (residues 108–116), and IPADVDPLTITSSLSSDGVLTVNGPR (residues 124–149). This spot also contained three βA3-crystallin tryptic peptides with the sequences of ITIYDQENFQGKR (residues 33–45), WDAWSGSNAYHIER (residues 96–109), and MTIFEKENFIGR (13Thampi P. Hassan A.

Additional peptides in the complex were one βB2 tryptic peptide with the sequence of VQSGTWVGYQYPGYR (residues 145–159), four γS tryptic fragments with the sequence of ITFYEDKNFQGR (residues 7–18), AVHLPSGGQYK (residues 84–94), QYLLDKK (residues 148–154), and KPIDWGAASPAVQSFR (residues 158–173), and one tryptic peptide of γD-crystallin with the sequence of QYLLMPGDYR (with oxidized Met, residues 143–152). Spot 4 was found to be a multimer of filensin and αA-crystallin. The spot showed the presence of a filensin tryptic peptide with the sequence of LGELAGPEDALAR (residues 78–90) and the tryptic peptides of αA with the sequence of TLGPFYPSR (residues 13–21) and TVLDSGISEVR (residues 55–65). Together, the above results suggested that covalent multimers existed in the WI protein fraction of young human lenses of 25 years of age, and these complexes were formed following cross-linking between truncated αA-crystallin and filensin, or among fragments of eight different crystallins. Identification of Components of Multimer Spots in WI Proteins of Lenses from 41-Year-old Donors—Upon two dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis, the WI protein fraction from lenses of 41-year-old donor showed more than 16 individual spots with molecular mass >90 kDa (Fig. 2B). The increased number of spots represented additional age-related cross-linked species that became water-insoluble. The ES-MS/MS analysis-deduced amino acid sequences of tryptic peptides from spots 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, and 16 are listed in Table III, which show that a variety of fragments of α-, β-, and γ-crystal-lins and that of filensin and phakinin were present in the multimers. The components of the remaining spots could not be fully identified and, therefore, are not reported.Table IIIAmino acid sequences of components forming covalent multimers in lenses from a 41-year-old donorSpot numberα-CrystallinCrystallins β and γFilensin and/or phakinin3αA: Ac-MDVTIQHPWFK (#1-11, oxidized Met and Trp)aResidue numbers are shown in parentheses.βB1: LVVFELENFQGR (#60-71)Filensin: LGELAGPEDALAR (#78-90)αA: TLGPFYPSR (#13-21)βB1: GEMFILEK (#110-117, Met oxidized)Filensin: SQLEEGREVLSHLQAQR (#223-239)αA: TVLDSGISEVR (#55-65)βB1: GYQYLLEPGDFR (#202-213)Filensin: EVLSHLQAQR (#230-239)αA: LDSGISEVR (#57-65)βA4: LTIFEQENFLGK (#106-11"
https://openalex.org/W2136793746,"Livers of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)-null mice have high levels of retinoic acid (RA), retinol, and retinyl palmitate. Hepatic accumulation of RA in these mice may be responsible in part for the hepatic phenotype characterized by small liver size and fibrosis. The increased levels of hepatic RA may be due to decreased metabolism of RA to 4-hydroxyretinoic acid. To identify the P450 isoform(s) involved in RA metabolism, liver microsomes from AHR-null and wild-type mice were subjected to Western blotting and probed with antibodies to rat P450s that cross-react with murine forms. Signal intensity in Western blots probed with anti-rat CYP2C6 antibodies correlated with levels of RA 4-hydroxylation. Furthermore, this anti-rat CYP2C6 antibody inhibited RA 4-hydroxylase activity of wild-type mouse liver microsomes to the levels of AHR-null mouse liver. When used to screen a mouse liver cDNA expression library, this antibody exclusively recognized the murine P450 CYP2C39. Catalytic assays of five recombinant mouse CYP2Cs expressed in Escherichia coli revealed that only CYP2C39 was competent for RA 4-hydroxylation (Km = 812.3 nm and Vmax 47.85 (fmol/min/pmol P450)). Real time reverse transcriptase-PCR used to assess the Cyp2C39 mRNA expression showed decreased levels (30%) of this transcript in AHR-null compared with wild-type liver, consistent with decreased protein levels observed by Western blot analysis using an antibody to a CYP2C39-specific peptide. These data show that CYP2C39 catalyzes RA catabolism and thus possibly controls RA levels in mouse liver. Down-regulation of Cyp2C39 is hypothesized to be responsible for the liver phenotype in the AHR-null mouse.

Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1994; 24: 87-149Google Scholar). These chemicals exert their effects primarily by binding to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor (2Swanson H.I. Bradfield C.A. Pharmacogenetics. 1993; 3: 213-230Google Scholar). Ligand binding promotes dissociation of cytosolic AHR from heat shock protein 90 and dimerization with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator. The AHR/aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator heterodimer translocates to the nucleus, binds to upstream DNA regulatory elements, and activates expression of a large battery of target genes. These alterations in target gene expression underlie the toxic and carcinogenic effects of AHR ligands, as reported recently (3Shimizu Y. Nakatsuru Y. Ichinose M. Takahashi Y. Kume H. Mimura J. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Ishikawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 779-782Google Scholar).The carcinogenic effects of AHR ligands are inhibited by retinoids (4Hansen L.A. Sigman C.C. Andreola F. Ross S.A. Kelloff G.J. De Luca L.M. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1271-1279Google Scholar). AHR ligands have been shown to reduce tissue retinoid content and to induce preneoplastic lesions, such as squamous metaplasia. This lesion is also induced by retinoid deficiency and reversed by retinoids in culture and in vivo (5De Luca L.M. Darwiche N. Jones C.S. Scita G. Sci. Am. Sci. Med. 1995; 2: 28-37Google Scholar). Thus, squamous metaplasia results from both AHR ligand and retinoid deficiency. Given that AHR ligands can reduce tissue retinoid content, and that the AHR can influence gene expression even in the absence of exogenous ligand, it seemed likely that loss of the AHR might affect retinoid homeostasis. This was confirmed by our observation that livers from AHR-null mice exhibit a 3-fold increase in retinol esters, retinol and retinoic acid, relative to wild-type livers (6Andreola F. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Chiantore M.V. Petkovich M.P. Gonzalez F.J. De Luca L.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2835-2838Google Scholar). Increased liver retinoids may cause liver fibrosis in the AHR-null mice through retinoic acid receptor-mediated induction of transglutaminase II, which in turn activates latent transforming growth factor-β (6Andreola F. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Chiantore M.V. Petkovich M.P. Gonzalez F.J. De Luca L.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2835-2838Google Scholar, 7Zaher H. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Letterio J. Sheikh M.S. Fornace Jr., A.J. Roberts A.B. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 313-321Google Scholar). Transforming growth factor-β causes decreased proliferation and elevated apoptosis, which could thus account for the small liver size and fibrosis (7Zaher H. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Letterio J. Sheikh M.S. Fornace Jr., A.J. Roberts A.B. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 313-321Google Scholar). Indeed, liver fibrosis can be partially reversed upon feeding a vitamin A-deficient diet to the AHR-null mice. 2F. Andreola, D. F. Calvisi, G. Elizondo, S. B. Jakowlew, J. Mariano, F. J. Gonzalez, and L. M. De Luca, unpublished data.2F. Andreola, D. F. Calvisi, G. Elizondo, S. B. Jakowlew, J. Mariano, F. J. Gonzalez, and L. M. De Luca, unpublished data.RA accumulation in the AHR-null mouse liver is associated with, and most likely caused by, a 65% decrease in RA metabolism (6Andreola F. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Chiantore M.V. Petkovich M.P. Gonzalez F.J. De Luca L.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2835-2838Google Scholar). The primary pathway of RA metabolism and excretion in vertebrates starts with 4-hydroxylation (8Napoli J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 139-162Google Scholar). In liver tissue this activity is NADPH-dependent and is inhibited by carbon monoxide, suggesting that it may be catalyzed by a cytochrome P450. The AHR is known to regulate P450 genes, including Cyp1A1, Cyp1A2, and Cyp1B1 (9Gonzalez F.J. Fernandez-Salguero P. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1998; 26: 1194-1198Google Scholar). These P450s are members of a superfamily of heme-containing enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of a large number of diverse substrates, including drugs, environmental toxins, carcinogens, endogenous steroids, and fatty acids (10Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R. Waxman D.J. Waterman M.R. Gotoh O. Coon M.J. Estabrook R.W. Gunsalus I.C. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1996; 6: 1-42Google Scholar). However, neither Cyp1A1 nor Cyp1A2, known to be regulated by the AHR status in mouse liver, metabolized RA (6Andreola F. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Chiantore M.V. Petkovich M.P. Gonzalez F.J. De Luca L.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2835-2838Google Scholar). Conversely, mRNA levels of the only known murine hepatic RA-metabolizing P450, Cyp26 (i.e. CYP26A1 (11Ray W.J. Bain G. Yao M. Gottlieb D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18702-18708Google Scholar, 12Loudig O. Babichuk C. White J. Abu-Abed S. Mueller C. Petkovich M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1483-1497Google Scholar)), were found to be similar in AHR wild-type and null mice (6Andreola F. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Chiantore M.V. Petkovich M.P. Gonzalez F.J. De Luca L.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2835-2838Google Scholar). Hence, the AHR appears to control the expression of an unidentified RA-metabolizing P450. This study was initiated to identify this P450 form.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All-trans-RA, hexane, isopropyl alcohol, acetic acid, and ammonium acetate were purchased from Sigma. [11,12-3H]RA (specific activity, 51.2 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 4-Hydroxy- and 4-oxo-RA were a kind gift of Dr. Joseph L. Napoli (University of California at Berkeley). Acetonitrile and methanol were purchased from Burdick and Jackson (Muskegon, MI). All of the solvents used for HPLC were degassed through a 0.2-μm filter, and all of the procedures were carried out under yellow light.Animals, TCDD Treatment and Microsome Preparation—All animals used in this study were 20-week-old males and were maintained in a pathogen-free facility. TCDD was administered in a single intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 80 μg/kg in corn oil. Mice were killed by CO2 asphyxiation 3 days after injection. Microsomes were prepared by differential centrifugation as described previously, and protein concentrations were determined by the dye-binding method (BCA kit, Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard.Western Immunoblots—Microsomal proteins (10 or 20 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane in TGM transfer buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, 20% v/v methanol) at a constant 30 V overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were probed with antibodies raised against rat CYP2C6 (a generous gift from Dr. David Waxman), CYP2C11, and CYP2B1 (BD Gentest Corp., Woburn, MA), mouse CYP1A1 (a generous gift from Dr. Harry Gelboin) and mCYP26, and an antibody for mCYP2C39 raised against a CYP2C39-specific peptide, generated as described below. Binding of antibody was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). Relative band intensities (peak area) were measured by densitometry.Generation of Anti-CYPs Antibody—Polyclonal anti-CYP26A1 antibody was raised by injection of a synthetic keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated C-terminal peptide from mouse CYP26 (Ac-CVDNLPARFTYFQGDI-OH) into rabbits using a standard protocol (Quality Control Biochemicals, a division of BioSource International Inc., Camarillo, CA). A CYP2C39-specific peptide C-EEFSDRGSIPMV was synthesized by ResGen (a division of Invitrogen) and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin through the terminal cysteine. Custom polyclonal antibodies specific for CYP2C39 were then produced by Covance Research Products Inc. (Denver, PA) as follows. At the start of production, a 1 mg/ml suspension of conjugated peptide was diluted 1:1 with Freund's complete adjuvant, and each of two rabbits received 500 μg (1 ml) following pre-bleed. After 4 weeks, rabbits were each boosted with 250 μg of peptide diluted 1:1 with Freund's incomplete adjuvant, followed after 2 weeks with a test bleed. Rabbits received 4 additional boosts at 4-week intervals, with production bleeds beginning after the third boost. Rabbits were terminated by exsanguination at completion of production. Antibodies used in this study were from the second production bleed.Enzymatic Assays and Determination of Kinetic Constants for RA 4-Hydroxylation by mCYP2C39 Isoform—RA metabolism in mouse liver microsomes was assayed as described previously (6Andreola F. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Chiantore M.V. Petkovich M.P. Gonzalez F.J. De Luca L.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2835-2838Google Scholar). The N termini of the murine Cyp2C cDNAs were modified for optimal expression in Escherichia coli and expressed, partially purified and reconstituted with dilauroylphosphatidylcholine and NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase, as described previously (13Luo G. Zeldin D.C. Blaisdell J.A. Hodgson E. Goldstein J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 357: 45-57Google Scholar, 14Ibeanu G.C. Blaisdell J. Ghanayem B.I. Beyloer C. Behamou S. Bouchardy C. Wilkinson G. Dayer P. Daly A.K. Goldstein J.A. Pharmacogenetics. 1998; 8: 129-135Google Scholar). Incubations containing a final concentration of 90 nm3H-labeled RA were initiated by the addition of NADPH and run for 1 h at 37 °C. For the determination of Km and Vmax values for RA 4-hydroxylation by mCYP2C39 isoform, recombinant and partially reconstituted mCYP2C39 isoform was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with a range of [3H]RA concentrations (22.5 to 720 nm); incubation time was within the linear range as determined from velocity versus time experiments. NADPH-minus controls were run side by side. Reactions were stopped by placing tubes in a dry ice/ethanol bath and processed as described below.HPLC—Conversion of [11,12-3H]RA to more polar metabolites was analyzed on both reverse and straight phase columns. A Beckman model 110A pump was connected in series to a Knauer D-14163 spectrophotometer (Sonntek, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ) and a Radiomatic radioactivity flow detector (150TR flow scintillation analyzer; Packard Instrument Co.). Samples were first analyzed on a Partisil 10 ODS-2 column (4.6 mm inside diameter × 25 cm; Whatman) fitted with a precolumn of Pellicular ODS (Whatman). Acetonitrile and 1% ammonium acetate in water (65:35 concentration) was used as mobile phase at a flow rate of 2.2 ml/min. Polar metabolites were further separated on a Zorbax-SIL (3 μm, 6.2 × 80 mm) column with 93.5:5:1:0.5 hexane/isopropyl alcohol/methanol/acetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min.Immunoinhibition—Liver microsomes (100 μg of protein) were preincubated for 30 min at room temperature with 0, 0.5, 1, and 2.5 mg of anti-rat CYP2C6 IgG/mg of microsomes. Commercial rabbit IgG (Sigma) was used as a negative control. Each sample was then incubated at 37 °C in a shaking water bath for 20 min in 0.3 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and an NADPH-regenerating system (2.5 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 500 nmol of NADP, and 0.5 μmol of glucose 6-phosphate), pH 7.4, with 90 nm [3H]RA, according to Fiorella et al. (15Fiorella P.D. Olson J.R. Napoli J.L. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1995; 134: 222-228Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped in a dry ice/methanol mixture before sample lyophilization. Each residue was extracted with 200 ml of methanol. After removal of particulates by centrifugation (3 min at maximum speed in a table top centrifuge), samples were stored at –70 °C until analyzed.RNA Extraction—Total RNA was extracted from crushed, frozen mouse liver using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To ensure efficient removal of possible DNA contamination, RNA samples were further purified using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol for RNA clean up. cDNA Synthesis—Purified total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reactions were primed with oligo(dT)12–18 primers, and the total volume/reaction was 20 μl.PCR Amplification—PCR was performed in a total volume of 50 μl using TaqMan PCR Core Reagent Kit (Applied Biosystems); 1 μl of cDNA/sample was used as template. Both GAPDH and Cyp2C39 amplification were done in duplicate for each sample. The thermal cycling conditions included 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min.Primers and Probes—Primers and probe for Cyp2C39 mRNA were designed using the Primer Express (Applied Biosystems) computer program and then custom-synthesized by Applied Biosystems. Primers and probe nucleotide sequences for mCyp2C39 (GenBank™ accession number AF047726) are as follows: forward primer 5′-1067AGAGATTCATCAACCTTGTCCCTAA1091-3′; reverse primer 5′-1178GATGTCAGTGACGTTACTACTGTTGTTC1151-3′; and TaqMan probe 5′(FAM)-1093AACATACCCCGTGCAGTGACTTGTGACATTAAATTT1128-(TAMRA)-3′. The boldface nucleotides in the TaqMan probe sequence represent the fully unique nucleotides for the Cyp2C39 isoform, which guarantee a specific amplification of this isoform over other very similar ones within the same subfamily. Both the primer pair set and probe for GAPDH were purchased from Applied Biosystems.Real Time RT-PCR—Cyp2C39 expression in wild-type and AHR-null mouse liver samples was measured by real time quantitative RT-PCR, based on TaqMan methodology, using the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). This technique allows, by means of fluorescence emission, identification of the cycling point when PCR product is detectable (threshold cycle or CT value). To normalize the amount of total RNA present in each reaction, we amplified the housekeeping gene GAPDH. Results are expressed as relative levels of Cyp2C39 mRNA, referred to wild-type samples (the calibrator), chosen to represent 1× expression of this gene. The AHR-null samples and the TCDD-treated AHR+/+ samples express n-fold Cyp2C39 mRNA relative to the calibrator. The amount of target, normalized to an endogenous reference (GAPDH) and relative to the calibrator is definite by the ΔΔCT method as described by Livak (Sequence Detector User Bulletin 2, Applied Biosystems). Specifically, the formula is as follows: target amount = 2–ΔΔCT, where ΔΔCT = {(CT(mCyp2C39 sample) – CT(GAPDH sample)) – (CT(mCyp2C39 calibrator) – CT(GADPH calibrator))}. This method is based on the assumption that the target (Cyp2C39) and the reference (GAPDH) display equal amplification efficiencies. To verify this condition, we checked ΔCT (CT mCyp2C39 – CT GAPDH) variations according to template dilution. To this end, a standard curve composed of five different dilutions of wild-type mouse liver total RNA (1.25, 1, 0.75, 0.5, and 0.25 μg) was generated. The slope of this curve was –0.0832. (To ensure the appropriate amplification efficiency, the slope of the standard curve should be less than 0.1.)Statistical Analysis—Quantitative RT-PCR data were analyzed using the following statistical Model 1,CT=μ+β1(batch)+β2(gene)+β3(type)+β4(gene·type)+ϵMODEL 1 This model is designed to adjust for possible batch effects and also to take into account the sample replicates, so the standard errors would account for both within mouse and between mouse variability.RESULTSCorrelation between CYP2C Immunoreactive Protein Levels and RA Metabolism in Microsomes Prepared from AHR-null and Wild-type Mouse Liver—Initially, an approach that directly compared protein levels was taken to study modulation of P450 levels in wild-type and AHR-null mice. Due to a high degree of amino acid similarity, antibodies raised to P450s from one species often cross-react with those from other rodent species. Thus, probing Western immunoblots of AHR-null and wild-type mouse liver microsomes with a panel of antibodies raised against rat P450s could be used to identify an antibody that would cross-react with the RA-hydroxylating P450 and to highlight differences in this P450 between AHR-null and wild-type mice. The results of this screen are presented in Fig. 1. The intensity of signal on the blots was found to vary in the same rank order as RA 4-hydroxylase activity, using an anti-rat 2C6 antibody as probe (Fig. 1). Thus, proteins that were cross-reactive to the antibody to rat CYP2C6 were decreased in AHR-null livers relative to wild type (37% decrease was estimated by densitometric analysis by ImageQuant 5.1 software). Furthermore, they were not increased by in vivo pretreatment with TCDD. This validates the fact that, although RA metabolism was decreased in AHR-null mouse liver, this activity was not TCDD-responsive. 3F. Andreola, G. P. Hayhurst, G. Luo, S. S. Ferguson, F. J. Gonzalez, J. A. Goldstein, and L. M. De Luca, unpublished data. The efficacy of TCDD treatment was confirmed using an anti-CYP1A1 antibody (Fig. 1). Thus, anti-rat CYP2C6 antibodies recognize a P450 form that follows the same trend as RA 4-hydroxylation in the AHR-null mice. In contrast, the signal obtained with anti-rat CYP2C11 antibodies did not vary considerably between genotypes, indicating that only a subset of P450s is affected in the AHR-null mouse. Significantly, the intensity of signal obtained using an antibody raised to a C-terminal peptide of CYP26, the retinoic acid-inducible retinoid acid 4-hydroxylase (also known as CYP26A1 or CYPRAI), was not significantly decreased (13%) in the AHR-null mouse. Thus, decreased levels of CYP26A1 (to our knowledge the only confirmed liver RA 4-hydroxylase P450 in the mouse) cannot explain the observed deficiency in RA metabolism in the AHR-null mouse liver.RA Metabolism in Mouse Liver Microsomes by Anti-CYP2C6 Antibody—In order to determine whether the anti-CYP2C6 antibody does indeed recognize an RA-metabolizing P450, immunoinhibition was performed with anti-CYP2C6 antibody. Indeed, this treatment inhibited RA oxidation in microsomes prepared from wild-type mice to a level of activity that resembled that of AHR-null microsomes, whereas control IgG had no effect on this activity (Fig. 2). In contrast, RA 4-hydroxylation in microsomes prepared from AHR-null livers was unaffected by the addition of either anti-CYP2C6 or control IgG. Taken together, these data strongly suggest the following: 1) the anti-CYP2C6 antibody specifically recognizes an RA-metabolizing P450; 2) the anti-CYP2C6 reactive P450 is present at decreased levels in the AHR-null mouse liver.Fig. 2Anti-CYP2C6 antibody inhibits RA metabolism in mouse liver microsomes. Liver microsomes (100 μg) prepared from wild-type or AHR-null mice were preincubated for 30 min at room temperature with 0, 0.5, 1, and 2.5 mg of anti-rat CYP2C6 IgG/mg microsomes or commercial rabbit IgG. RA metabolism was assayed and metabolites quantified by HPLC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Anti-2C6 Antibody Preferentially Recognizes Mouse CYP2C39 in an Expression Library Screen—In initial attempts to identify the mouse P450 that is recognized by the anti-rat CYP2C6 antibody, this antibody was used to screen a mouse liver cDNA expression library. Of nine recombinant phages identified from a tertiary screen, seven contained a sequence exactly corresponding to CYP2C39 (13Luo G. Zeldin D.C. Blaisdell J.A. Hodgson E. Goldstein J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 357: 45-57Google Scholar) (representing three unique clones). The remaining two clones had no sequence similarity to the P450 superfamily. Significantly, no other P450s, including those from the highly homologous CYP2C subfamily members, were recognized during the library screen.CYP2C39 Catalyzes the 4-Hydroxylation of RA—Given the evidence presented above, it seemed likely that CYP2C39 was the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of RA and that it is present at decreased levels in the AHR-null mouse liver. To determine whether this enzyme is indeed capable of metabolizing RA, expressed, partially purified recombinant CYP2C39 was incubated in a reconstituted system with [3H]RA. A concentration of 90 nm RA was chosen for all incubations as this is in the same range as the reported physiological RA concentration in the liver (6Andreola F. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Chiantore M.V. Petkovich M.P. Gonzalez F.J. De Luca L.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2835-2838Google Scholar). The specificity of the reaction was tested by assaying metabolite formation of the other highly homologous murine CYP2C isoforms (CYP2C29, -37, -38, -39 and -40). Of all the P450s tested, only CYP2C39 produced the major metabolites of RA (4-hydroxy- and 4-oxo-RA) at levels above that seen with the inactive P450 control (Table I), even though all P450 preparations were active in the metabolism of arachidonic acid (13Luo G. Zeldin D.C. Blaisdell J.A. Hodgson E. Goldstein J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 357: 45-57Google Scholar). As a further test to ensure that lack of RA-hydroxylating activity by the murine CYP2Cs was not due to inactive P450, tolbutamide metabolism was assessed side-by-side with the RA incubations. Both CYP2C29 and 2C38 metabolized tolbutamide with turnover numbers of 6 and 1.1 nmol/nmol/min, respectively (not shown). Kinetic studies for RA oxidation were performed using the partially purified, recombinant mCYP2C39 isoform. This isoform exhibited high activity for the 4-hydroxylation of RA, with a Vmax value of 47.85 fmol/min/pmol of mCYP2C39 and a Km of 812.29 nm. Background metabolite formation was assessed with an inactive recombinant human CYP2C19*5 allele (which contains a mutation in the heme-binding motif) (14Ibeanu G.C. Blaisdell J. Ghanayem B.I. Beyloer C. Behamou S. Bouchardy C. Wilkinson G. Dayer P. Daly A.K. Goldstein J.A. Pharmacogenetics. 1998; 8: 129-135Google Scholar). This allele has been found to be essentially inactive (<0.4% of wild-type CYP2C19) toward CYP2C19 substrates such as S-mephenytoin and tolbutamide (14Ibeanu G.C. Blaisdell J. Ghanayem B.I. Beyloer C. Behamou S. Bouchardy C. Wilkinson G. Dayer P. Daly A.K. Goldstein J.A. Pharmacogenetics. 1998; 8: 129-135Google Scholar). Background 4-hydroxy- and 4-oxo-RA formation was fairly high (∼5% total radioactivity) in the absence of an active P450 (Table I). As no metabolites were observed in the absence of protein (not shown), this is most likely due to metabolism by contaminating bacterial proteins.Table IMetabolism of RA by recombinant mouse CYP2CsP450All-trans RA, (% initial)Metabolite4-OH-RA4-OXO-RATotalpmol formed in 1-h incubationCYP2C2987 ± 10.49 ± 0.20.7 ± 0.251.19 ± 0.44CYP2C3786 ± 10.51 ± 0.040.71 ± 0.11.22 ± 0.14CYP2C3882 ± 20.81 ± 0.220.8 ± 0.111.61 ± 0.28CYP2C3972 ± 3aSignificantly different from CYP2C19mt (p < 0.05).2.49 ± 0.61aSignificantly different from CYP2C19mt (p < 0.05).1.47 ± 0.55aSignificantly different from CYP2C19mt (p < 0.05).3.97 ± 1.06aSignificantly different from CYP2C19mt (p < 0.05).CYP2C4087 ± 20.46 ± 0.170.62 ± 0.251.08 ± 0.41CYP2C19mtbCYP2C19mt refers to a catalytically inactive allele of CYP2C19 (CYP2C19*5), which contains a mutation in the heme binding region that abolishes catalytic activity toward S-mephenytoin and tolbutamide (<0.4% of the wild type allele).

Open table in a new tab Cyp2C39 mRNA Is Dependent on AHR Status but Unresponsive to TCDD—Because of the unique activity of the bacterially expressed CYP2C39 in RA 4-hydroxylation, we tested whether AHR-null mice showed a decrease in Cyp2C39 mRNA compared with wild type. Fig. 3 shows a 70% decrease in Cyp2C39 mRNA as tested in real time RT-PCR experiments and specified in Fig. 3 legend. The difference was highly significant (95% confidence intervals). Interestingly, in vivo pretreatment with TCDD did not affect Cyp2C39 mRNA expression, thus suggesting that AHR status controls the expression of this RA 4-hydroxylating enzyme in an indirect manner. These data correlate well with the reported lack of induction by TCDD treatment of both anti-rat CYP2C6 immunoreactive protein(s) expression and in vitro RA metabolism in AHR wild-type mice.Fig. 3mCyp2C39 mRNA expression level is reduced in AHR-null mouse liver but unaffected by TCDD treatment.

In the present work, we report that tumor necrosis factor α-converting enzyme (TACE; ADAM-17) mediates shedding of c-Kit. Stimulation of transfected cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induced metalloproteinase-mediated release of c-Kit ectodomain, which increased further upon TACE overexpression. By contrast, TACE-deficient fibroblasts did not demonstrate inducible release, thus identifying TACE as the metalloproteinase primarily responsible for PMA-induced c-Kit shedding. Surface expression of c-Kit by the human mast cell-1 line decreased upon phorbol-induced shedding, which involved metalloproteinase activity susceptible to inhibition by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-3. To further explore the role of TACE in shedding of c-Kit from mast cells, we compared the behavior of mast cells derived from murine embryonic stem cells. In these studies, PMA decreased surface c-Kit levels on mast cells expressing wild-type (+/+) TACE but not on those expressing an inactive mutant (ΔZn/ΔZn), confirming the role of TACE in PMA-induced c-Kit shedding. Compared with TACE+/+ cells, TACEΔZn/ΔZn mast cells also demonstrated decreased constitutive shedding and increased basal surface expression of c-Kit, with diminished apoptosis in response to c-Kit ligand deprivation.

Therefore, metalloproteolytic ectodomain shedding may regulate critical mast cell signaling interactions involving c-Kit and KL. In this work, we used in vitro cell-based systems to investigate the role of TACE in mechanisms regulating c-Kit shedding and to clarify its relevance to mast cell biology. Comparative analysis of transfected murine embryonic fibroblasts expressing wild-type or inactive protease identified TACE as the metalloproteinase responsible for phorbol-inducible c-Kit shedding. We show that cultured mast cells also express ADAM-9 (meltrin-γ), ADAM-10 (kuzbanian), and TACE, which substantiates their candidacy as sheddases of mast cell surface proteins. To demonstrate that TACE activity regulates shedding of c-Kit by mast cells, we differentiated murine embryonic stem (ES) cells to generate mast cells expressing wild-type (+/+) or inactive (ΔZn/ΔZn) TACE. TACEΔZn/ΔZn ES-derived mast cells demonstrated decreased c-Kit shedding, increased surface receptor expression, and decreased apoptosis upon growth factor deprivation, showing that TACE-mediated metalloproteolytic shedding controls mast cell survival.

HMC-1 cells, a human mast cell line (obtained from J. Butterfield (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN)), were maintained at a concentration of ∼1 × 106 cells/ml in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 10% FBS, as previously described (24Mellon M.B. Frank B.T. Fang K.C. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated alone or with 100 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma), 100 ng/ml recombinant human c-Kit ligand (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ), mammalian (serine, cysteine, and aspartic) protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) with 2 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, or 25 μm PP2 (Src kinase inhibitor) (Calbiochem) at 37 °C for various periods of time. To determine the effect of metalloproteinases, cells were preincubated with various concentrations of GM6001 (Calbiochem), TNF-α protease inhibitor-2 (IC-3) (Peptides International, Louisville, KY) (23Reddy P. Slack J.L. Davis R. Cerretti D.P. Kozlosky C.J. Blanton R.A. Shows D. Peschon J.J. Black R.A. J. Biol.

Measurement of Soluble c-Kit Ectodomain—Concentrations of the soluble extracellular domain of c-Kit released into culture media were measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in 96-well microtitration plates using the human sCD117 ELISA Kit (sensitivity range from 0.312 to 10 ng/ml) (Diaclone, Besançon, France), according to the manufacturer's protocols. Levels of soluble c-Kit ectodomain (range of 1.0–6.0 ng/ml) in conditioned media were expressed as a percentage relative to the experimental control. Plasmid Construction—To express c-Kit containing V5 and His6 epitopes (KitV5His), PCR-amplified full-length human c-Kit cDNA (gift of J. Longley (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI)) was subcloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen) containing a COOH-terminal V5 epitope and polyhistidine region. To express ADAM-17 with a COOH-terminal FLAG epitope, human ADAM-17 cDNA obtained by reverse transcription of HEK-293 mRNA was amplified by PCR and cloned into the KpnI site of pFLAG-CMV-5a. Transfection—Exponentially growing HEK-293 cells or murine tace+/+ and taceΔZn/ΔZn fibroblasts were washed three times in antibiotic-free culture media, seeded at 3–6 × 105 cells/ml in culture media in 6-well plates, and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Transient transfection of cells was performed with various concentrations of plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocols, and incubated at 37 °C for different time intervals. To isolate HEK-293 cells stably transfected with KitV5His, cells were selected by incubation in 400 μg/ml G418 (Calbiochem), with identification of drug-resistant clones expressing KitV5His protein after 14 days. Site-directed Mutagenesis—KitGNNKV5His plasmid for expression of c-Kit containing the GNNK(+) isoform was constructed using KitV5His (GNNK-) template DNA and the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), according to the manufacturer's protocols. Flow Cytometry—Cell surface c-Kit expression on tace+/+ and taceΔZn/ΔZn fibroblasts was identified 48 h after transfection by flow cytometric analysis of cells stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated antibody to c-Kit (clone 104D2; BD Pharmingen) at a 1:20 dilution for 45 min at 4 °C. To control for variable transfection efficiency and protein expression, c-Kit-positive fibroblasts were sorted on a triple-laser FACSVantage SE flow cytometer based on mean fluorescence intensity, with data analyzed by CellQuest Pro 4.1 software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). To detect cell surface protein expression, cells were washed three times with culture media containing 1% FBS prior to incubation with mouse monoclonal Ab against human c-Kit (clone K45) (Neomarkers, Fremont, CA), human ADAM-9 or -17 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), or rabbit polyclonal Ab to the NH2 terminus of active ADAM-10 (Triple Point Biologics) at 4 °C for 45 min. After washing, cells were incubated with either fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG1 (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, or FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at 4 °C for 30 min. Incubation of cells with secondary Ab alone was performed to exclude nonspecific cross-reactivity. Cells were examined on a FACScan Flow Cytometer with data analyzed using CELLQuest Pro 4.1 software (Becton Dickinson). Isotype control experiments were performed using either mouse IgG1, IgG2b (eBioscience, San Diego, CA), or IgG2a (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL) or rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA). Flow cytometric analysis of ESMC c-Kit expression was performed using FITC-conjugated rat anti-mouse c-Kit (clone 2B8) (BD PharMingen, San Jose, CA). FACS-based apoptosis assays using Hoechst 33342 (25Belloc F. Dumain P. Boisseau M.R. Jalloustre C. Reiffers J. Bernard P. Lacombe F. Cytometry. 1994; 17: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and annexin V (26Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4627) Google Scholar) were used to detect mast cell apoptosis. Incorporation of propidium iodide (PI) was used to identify necrotic cells. Induction of apoptosis was performed using 1 μm staurosporine (Sigma) (data not shown) and either partial or complete withdrawal of KL (15Iemura A. Tsai M. Ando A. Wershil B.K. Galli S.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 321-328PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in serum-free culture media for 24 h prior to the addition of 0, 10, or 100 ng/ml KL (Peprotech) at 37 °C for various time intervals. After incubation and equilibration of cells to room temperature, flow cytometry was performed on cells treated with 2 μg/ml PI and 6 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) added 6 min prior to detection on a triple laser FACSVantage SE flow cytometer. To detect bound annexin V, cells were incubated with FITC annexin V in binding buffer (Molecular Probes), according to the manufacturer's instructions and analyzed similarly. Survival was determined by identifying the population of nonapoptotic and nonnecrotic cells. Gates were established using control populations of cells (prior to induction of apoptosis) that exclude PI and either demonstrate only background levels of annexin V binding (left lower quadrant; see Fig. 7) or stain positive for Hoechst 33342 and negative for PI (right lower quadrant). Apoptotic cells were identified by decreased Hoechst 33342 and increased PI staining or by positive annexin V staining. Immunoprecipitation—To determine the effect of metalloproteinases on c-Kit ectodomain shedding, 20 × 106 HMC-1 cells were incubated in 300 μl of serum-free medium in the absence or presence of 50 μm IC-3 at 37 °C for 15 min, followed by incubation with 100 ng/ml PMA at 37 °C for 2 h. Aliquots of normal human serum (Sigma) or cell supernatants were equilibrated with an equal volume of PBS and incubated with monoclonal anti-c-Kit receptor Ab that recognizes the second Ig-like domain (clone K45) at 4 °C for 2 h. Antibody-antigen complexes were incubated with protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 4 °C for 16 h and washed three times in 25 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 135 mm NaCl and 2.6 mm KCl (TBS). To elute proteins, beads were resuspended in reducing running buffer prior to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis on 8% Tris-glycine gels. Immunoprecipitation using rat anti-murine c-Kit receptor (ACK2) (eBioscience) of c-Kit ectodomain released from murine mast cells (25 × 106 cells/ml) during a 16-h incubation at 37 °C was performed as previously described (20Broudy V.C. Lin N.L. Sabath D.F. Cytokine. 2001; 15: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Detection of ADAM or c-Kit proteins electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was performed by immunoblotting techniques, as previously described (27Frank B.T. Rossall J.C. Caughey G.H. Fang K.C. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2783-2792Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), using monoclonal (clone AB81) anti-c-Kit Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal anti-c-Kit-(951–960) Ab (gift of K. Langley, Amgen, Inc.) or polyclonal anti-ADAM-9, -10, or -17 Ab (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Triton X-114 Detergent Partitioning—Membrane-anchored proteins were isolated by Triton X-114 detergent partitioning, as previously described (28Schlondorff J. Becherer J.D. Blobel C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets were incubated in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) buffer containing 2% (v/v) Triton X-114 (Sigma) at 4 °C for 15 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Supernatants were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and centrifuged at 1000 × g at 22 °C for 10 min. Ice-cold TBS was added to the detergent phase prior to electrophoresis and immunoblotting. In Vitro Differentiation of Embryonic Stem Cell-derived Mast Cells—Murine embryonic stem (ES) cells expressing wild-type TACE (TACE+/+) or homozygous for an inactivating mutation in the zincbinding domain (TACEΔZn/ΔZn) (5Peschon J.J.

Briefly, ES cells were cultured on plates coated with 0.1% gelatin (Sigma) in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 15% FBS, 100 ng/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada), and 1.5 × 10-4m β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) at 37 °C for 2–3 days. Cells were then cultured in differentiation media for 8–10 days to develop embryoid bodies, which were dissociated in 0.25% trypsin at 37 °C for 5 min, disrupted mechanically, and cultured in maintenance media containing 2 ng/ml murine interleukin-3 and 100 ng/ml murine KL (Peprotech). Embryonic stem cell-derived mast cells (ESMCs) were used between weeks 6 and 12. To identify mast cell phenotypes, cytospun cells were incubated with 1% toluidine blue (which yields metachromatic staining in mast cells or basophils) (31Ochi H. Hirani W.M. Yuan Q. Friend D.S. Austen K.F. Boyce J.A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 267-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) or 2 μg/ml Texas Red avidin (Molecular Probes) (which binds specifically to mast cell granules) (32Weidner N. Horan R.F.

Cytochem. 1985; 33: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Chymase activity was identified by enzyme histochemistry using naphthol AS-D chloroacetate and Fast Garnet GBC (Sigma), which yields reddish brown cytoplasmic granules (34Matin R. Tam E.K. Nadel J.A. Caughey G.H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1992; 40: 781-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Expression of ADAM-9, ADAM-10, and TACE by TACE+/+ or TACEΔZn/ΔZn ESMCs was determined by PCR analysis of cDNA reverse transcribed from mRNA isolated from the cells using primers based on the nucleotide sequences of the murine ADAMs (GenBank™ accession numbers NM007404, NM001110, and NM009615) (data not shown). To block c-Kit receptor internalization, cells were incubated with 25 μm PP2 (Calbiochem) at 37 °C for 30 min prior to induction of c-Kit shedding by PMA, as previously described. Statistical Analysis—Differences with a p value of <0.05 using Student's two-tailed t test were considered significant. TACE Mediates c-Kit Ectodomain Shedding—To investigate metalloproteinase-dependent ectodomain shedding, soluble c-Kit levels in supernatants of HEK-293 cells stably expressing wild-type c-Kit incubated under various conditions were assayed by ELISA. As seen in Fig. 1B, HEK-293 cells constitutively released c-Kit ectodomain, whose levels increased by 2-fold upon phorbol stimulation. Incubation of cells with metalloproteinase inhibitors, GM6001 or IC-3, decreased levels of soluble c-Kit, demonstrating a dependence of c-Kit ectodomain shedding on metalloproteinase activity. Expression of c-Kit containing a Gly-Asn-Asn-Lys (GNNK) insertion, a common variant in the c-Kit juxtamembrane region (36Yarden Y. Kuang W.J. Yang-Feng T. Coussens L. Munemitsu S. Dull T.J. Chen E. Schlessinger J. Francke U. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3341-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar), did not alter constitutive or phorbol-inducible shedding, since soluble levels of both the GNNK(-) and GNNK(+) isoforms were similar (Fig. 1C). Therefore, c-Kit ectodomain shedding occurred independently of the GNNK sequence, despite altering the sequence and length of the juxtamembrane region. As shown in Fig. 1D, overexpression of TACE-FLAG in c-Kit-expressing HEK-293 cells increased constitutive ectodomain release by 2-fold, demonstrating that TACE mediates shedding of c-Kit. Compared with unstimulated cells, incubation of TACE-transfected cells with phorbol further increased release of soluble c-Kit, substantiating a role for TACE activity in phorbol-inducible c-Kit shedding. Phorbol-inducible c-Kit Shedding Requires TACE—To further investigate the dependence of ectodomain shedding on TACE activity, c-Kit receptor was transiently expressed in wild type (tace+/+) or taceΔZn/ΔZn fibroblasts, which express an inactive form of TACE due to a mutation in the Zn2+-containing active site. Transfected fibroblasts expressing high surface levels of c-Kit were isolated by flow cytometry after staining with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-c-Kit Ab. Following sorting, purity of c-Kit-positive cells exceeded 94% for both tace+/+ and taceΔZn/ΔZn fibroblasts, which demonstrated similar c-Kit surface expression (data not shown). As seen in Fig. 2, supernatants of unstimulated tace+/+ and taceΔZn/ΔZn fibroblasts demonstrated similar levels of soluble c-Kit by ELISA, suggesting that constitutive shedding of c-Kit occurred largely independently of TACE in these cells. Phorbol stimulation of tace+/+ fibroblasts increased soluble c-Kit levels by 2-fold but had no effect on shedding by taceΔZn/ΔZn fibroblasts. Therefore, these data substantiate a role for TACE in phorbol-induced c-Kit ectodomain shedding. It is important to note that the sensitivity of constitutive taceΔZn/ΔZn fibroblast c-Kit shedding to inhibition by either GM6001 or IC-3 also suggests the potential involvement of other non-TACE metalloproteinases in c-Kit ectodomain cleavage in these cells.

After prenylation, the last three residues of CAAX proteins are clipped off by Rce1, an integral membrane endoprotease of the endoplasmic reticulum. Prenylation is crucial to the function of many CAAX proteins, but the physiologic significance of endoproteolytic processing has remained obscure. To address this issue, we used Cre/loxP recombination techniques to create mice lacking Rce1 in the heart, an organ where Rce1 is expressed at particularly high levels. The hearts from heart-specific Rce1 knockout mice manifested reduced levels of both the Rce1 mRNA and CAAX endoprotease activity, and the hearts manifested an accumulation of CAAX protein substrates. The heart-specific Rce1 knockout mice initially appeared healthy but died starting at 3-5 months of age. By 10 months of age, ∼70% of the mice had died. Pathological studies revealed that the heart-specific Rce1 knockout mice had a dilated cardiomyopathy. By contrast, liver-specific Rce1 knockout mice appeared healthy, had normal transaminase levels, and had normal liver histology.

First, the C-terminal cysteine (i.e. the C of the CAAX motif) is “lipidated” with a 15-carbon farnesyl or a 20-carbon geranylgeranyl lipid. This processing step is carried out by cytosolic prenyltransferases (protein farnesyltransferase and protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I).

Academic Press, San Diego2000: 155-213Google Scholar), the physiological importance of the second step of CAAX protein processing, the endoproteolytic trimming of the C terminus, has remained obscure. In yeast, RCE1 deficiency caused a partial mislocalization of Ras2p away from the plasma membrane, but there was no detectable effect on cell growth or vitality (5Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, Rce1 deficiency eliminated the endoproteolytic processing of the Ras proteins and led to a partial mislocalization of Ras proteins away from the plasma membrane (6Kim E.

However, Rce1 deficiency had only a marginal effect on fibroblast cell growth (17Bergo M.O. Ambroziak P. Gregory C. George A. Otto J.C. Kim E. Nagase H. Casey P.J. Balmain A. Young S.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Studies of Rce1 knockout mice have heightened the mystery surrounding the importance of Rce1-mediated endoproteolytic processing for mammalian cells (6Kim E. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Taylor B. Ashby M. Shannon K. Casey P.J. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8383-8390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These knockout mice grow and develop normally until late in embryonic development. After embryonic day 15.5, however, most of them die and those that are born alive are small and survive for only a few weeks. Why Rce1 knockout mice die remains enigmatic, since no pathology was observed in any of the major organ systems (6Kim E. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Taylor B. Ashby M. Shannon K. Casey P.J. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8383-8390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The fact that most do not survive postnatally indicates that CAAX protein endoproteolysis is somehow important; however, the survival of some Rce1-deficient mice for a few weeks after birth indicates that the endoproteolytic processing is not nearly as important as prenylation for the vitality of mammalian cells and tissues. Hematopoietic stem cells harvested from the livers of Rce1-deficient embryos were capable of restoring normal levels of hematopoiesis when transplanted into lethally irradiated wild-type mice (6Kim E. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Taylor B. Ashby M. Shannon K. Casey P.J. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8383-8390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 18Aiyagari A.L. Taylor B.R. Aurora V. Young S.G. Shannon K.M. Blood. 2003; 101: 2250-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar); thus, Rce1 deficiency did not appear to have significant deleterious effects on hematopoiesis. However, no one has yet examined the physiologic importance of Rce1 on tissues of adult mice, for example by examining tissue-specific knockout mice. Thus, the physiologic significance of Rce1 in adult animals is uncertain. The finding that Rce1 deficiency leads to a partial mislocalization of Ras proteins within mouse fibroblasts (6Kim E. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Taylor B. Ashby M. Shannon K. Casey P.J. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8383-8390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) has encouraged efforts to develop Rce1 inhibitor drugs, with the hope that such drugs might diminish the effects of mutationally activated Ras proteins in human cancers (19Gilbert B.A. Ma Y.-T. Rando R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 206-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 20Schlitzer M. Winter-Vann A. Casey P.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001; 11: 425-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A recent study indicated that Cre-mediated excision of Rce1 in mouse fibroblasts limits Ras-induced transformation of cells (17Bergo M.O. Ambroziak P. Gregory C. George A. Otto J.C. Kim E. Nagase H. Casey P.J. Balmain A. Young S.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), but much more research is required to determine if Rce1 would be a useful therapeutic target. In any case, if Rce1 inhibitor drugs were shown to be effective in blocking tumor growth in vivo, it would be essential to document that they could be given safely. In that regard, the question of whether the absence of CAAX protein endoproteolysis would adversely affect the function of vital organ systems in vivo has never been addressed. In the current study, we sought to assess the physiologic importance of the endoproteolytic processing of prenylated CAAX proteins. To address this issue, we created mice lacking Rce1 in the heart, a tissue where Rce1 is expressed at very high levels (7Otto J.C. Kim E. Young S.G. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8379-8382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This study indicates that CAAX endoproteolysis is vitally important in the myocardium, as the absence of Rce1 in the heart caused a lethal-dilated cardiomyopathy. Heart-specific Rce1 Knockout Mice—Mice with a “floxed” Rce1 allele (Rce1flx) were created in an earlier study to analyze the effect of an Rce1 gene excision on Ras-induced transformation of fibroblasts (17Bergo M.O. Ambroziak P. Gregory C. George A. Otto J.C. Kim E. Nagase H. Casey P.J. Balmain A. Young S.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In the Rce1flx allele, the loxP sites flank all of the protein-coding sequences of the gene; thus, Cre-mediated recombination eliminates the possibility of translation of a functional protein. To create an Rce1 knockout allele (Rce1Δ), Rce1flx/+ mice were bred with transgenic mice that expressed Cre in the germline (21Rajewsky K. Gu H. Kühn R. Betz U.A.K. Müller W. Roes J. Schwenk F. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). As expected from earlier studies (6Kim E. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Taylor B. Ashby M. Shannon K. Casey P.J. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8383-8390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), mice with a single copy of the knockout allele (Rce1Δ/+) were phenotypically normal and free of pathology over 18 months of observation. Mice hemizygous for an α-myosin heavy chain-Cre transgene (αMyhc-Cre+/o) (22Agah R. Frenkel P.A. French B.A. Michael L.H. Overbeek P.A. Schneider M.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. Michael Schneider (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). To create heart-specific Rce1 knockout mice, we bred αMyhc-Cre+/o mice that contained both an Rce1flx allele and an Rce1Δ allele (Rce1flx/ΔαMyhc-Cre+/o). Two groups of mice were bred as controls: Rce1flx/flx mice and αMyhc-Cre+/o mice that were homozygous for wild-type Rce1 alleles (Rce1+/+αMyhc-Cre+/o). All mice were weaned at 28 days of age and maintained on a normal chow diet. The mice had a similar but mixed genetic background (>75% C57BL/6). Assessing Cre-mediated Inactivation of Rce1 in the Heart—To assess the extent of Cre-mediated recombination within Rce1 in the heart-specific Rce1 knockout mice, BamHI-cleaved genomic DNA from the heart was analyzed with Southern blots (17Bergo M.O. Ambroziak P. Gregory C. George A. Otto J.C. Kim E. Nagase H. Casey P.J. Balmain A. Young S.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition, Rce1 expression in the heart was assessed by real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR). For these studies, total RNA was isolated from the heart with a TRI REAGENT protocol (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). Reverse transcription of RNA (1 μg) was performed with the SuperScriptII RNase H-Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA); the resulting cDNA (50 ng) was used for real-time QPCR reactions, performed for 40 cycles (95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 60 s) on an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The oligonucleotide primers were 5′-AAGGTTGTCCTGGCCCCTC-3′ and 5′-TTTCGTAGCCAGGGCATGT-3′, and the probe was 5′-6FAM-GTTCTTGGGCCCGCTGCCTCACAG-TAMRA-3′ (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Rce1 expression levels were normalized to those of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Rodent GAPDH Control Reagents, PE Applied Biosystems). Rce1 mRNA levels in the hearts of Rce1flx/ΔαMyhc-Cre+/o mice were compared with those in the hearts of control Rce1flx/Δ mice. Assessing Rce1 Activity in the Heart—CAAX endoprotease activity levels in heart tissue were measured with a coupled endoproteolysis/methylation assay (6Kim E. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Taylor B. Ashby M. Shannon K. Casey P.J. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8383-8390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 7Otto J.C. Kim E. Young S.G. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8379-8382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In this assay, the level of CAAX endoprotease activity in heart extracts was determined by measuring the ability of the extracts to cleave farnesyl-K-Ras and render it susceptible to methylation by Icmt, thereby producing K-Ras terminating with a farnesylcysteine [14C]methyl ester. Hearts of mice were excised, rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cut into multiple pieces, and then homogenized and sonicated in a buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science, Nutley, NJ) (6Kim E.

Young S.G. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8379-8382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min and removal of tissue debris, heart extracts were collected. Extracts (300 μg) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 100 μl in the presence of human recombinant farnesyl-K-Ras (4 μm), the methyl donor S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-14C]methionine (1 mCi, 80 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), and recombinant Icmt (8Hrycyna C.A. Sapperstein S.K. Clarke S. Michaelis S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1699-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 1 m NaOH containing 1% SDS. A portion of the mixture (135 μl) was spotted onto a filter paper, which was wedged into the neck of a vial containing 5 ml of scintillation fluid. The vial was then capped and incubated overnight at room temperature. NaOH hydrolyzes the methyl esters, releasing [14C]methanol, which rapidly enters the scintillation fluid. After removal of the filter paper, the radioactivity in the scintillation fluid is measured. As a control, we tested the incorporation of S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-14C]methionine into nonfarnesylated K-Ras; the incorporation rates were invariably <5% of those into farnesyl-K-Ras. Quantifying Substrate Accumulation in Rce1-deficient Fibroblasts and Heart Tissue—To assess the level of accumulation of Rce1 substrates in Rce1-/- fibroblasts, whole-cell lysates (50 μg) from Rce1+/+ and Rce1-/- fibroblasts were mixed on ice and incubated with S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-14C]methionine at 37 °C for 45 min. In this experiment, Rce1 substrates within the Rce1-/- cells are cleaved by the Rce1 enzymatic activity in the Rce1+/+ lysates (23Leung G.K. Schmidt W.K. Bergo M.O. Gavino B. Wong D.H. Tam A. Ashby M.N. Michaelis S. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29051-29058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The endoproteolytic cleavage reaction renders the proteins susceptible to Icmt-mediated carboxyl methylation; the amount of methylation can be quantified by measuring the amount of [14C]methanol released after the addition of 100 μl of 1 m NaOH. As controls, we measured the methylation in lysates (100 μg) from either Rce1+/+ or Rce1-/- fibroblasts. (In Rce1+/+ lysates, the amounts of methylation would be expected to be low, since CAAX proteins would be fully processed (i.e. cleaved and methylated) prior to the incubation; in Rce1-/- lysates, the amount of methylation would be low because the absence of Rce1-mediated endoproteolysis precludes methylation of the isoprenylcysteine.) To assess the level of Rce1 substrates in hearts, we incubated total heart lysates (500 μg) from Rce1flx/ΔαMyhc-Cre+/o mice with S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-14C]methionine at 37 °C for 45 min. In this experiment, we relied on Rce1 in “non-cardiomyocytes” to cleave the Rce1 substrates in the Rce1-deficient cardiomyocytes, thereby rendering them susceptible to carboxyl methylation. The amount of methylation was quantified by measuring the base-releasable radioactivity. For controls, methylation was quantified in lysates from hearts of wild-type mice as well as mice deficient in Zmpste24, another integral membrane protease of the ER. Activation of Erk1/2 in Rce1-deficient Cells—Serum-stimulated activation of Erk1/2 was assessed by seeding 1 × 105Rce1+/+ and Rce1-/- cells on 60-mm dishes followed by overnight serum starvation. The next morning, medium containing 10% serum was added to the cells. Cells were harvested at various time points after serum stimulation, and total cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody recognizing phosphorylated Erk1/2 (phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase E10 monoclonal, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), and total Erk1/2 (p44/42 MAP kinase, polyclonal, Cell Signaling Technology). An identical series of experiments was performed with Rce1flx/flx fibroblasts and Rce1-deficient fibroblasts (Rce1Δ/Δ) that were generated from them. To produce the Rce1Δ/Δ fibroblasts, Rce1flx/flx fibroblasts were treated with a Cre adenovirus (AdRSVCre) as described (17Bergo M.O. Ambroziak P. Gregory C. George A. Otto J.C. Kim E. Nagase H. Casey P.J. Balmain A. Young S.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In these experiments, the parental Rce1flx/flx fibroblasts were treated with a β-galactosidase adenovirus (AdRSVnlacZ). Analyzing Heart-specific Rce1 Knockout Mice—Rce1flx/ΔαMyhc-Cre+/o mice (n = 14), Rce1flx/flx mice (n = 10), and Rce1+/+αMyhc-Cre+/o mice (n = 10) were fed a normal diet for 10 months. Mice that died before 10 months of age were analyzed for gross and microscopic pathology. Hearts were excised, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 10% formalin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin/eosin (H&E) and Sirius Red. Mice that survived until 10 months of age were euthanized, and the hearts were analyzed for gross and microscopic pathology. Generating Liver-specific Rce1 Knockout Mice—To inactivate Rce1 in the liver, Rce1flx/flx mice were given an intravenous injection of a Cre adenovirus (24Anton M. Graham F.L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4600-4606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (2 × 1011 plaque-forming units) (n = 3) or an adenovirus encoding Escherichia coli β-galactosidase (2 × 1011 plaque-forming units) (n = 3) (25Dong G.

After 3 days, livers and hearts were removed, and the levels of CAAX endoprotease activity in the tissues were determined. In addition, the electrophoretic mobilities of the Ras proteins from heart and liver were assessed with Western blots of SDS-polyacrylamide gels, as described previously (6Kim E. Ambroziak P.

Mice lacking Rce1 in the liver were also generated by breeding Rce1flx/flx mice carrying the interferon-inducible Mx1-Cre transgene (26Kühn R. Schwenk F. Aguet M. Rajewsky K. Science. 1995; 269: 1427-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar), and then inducing Cre expression with intraperitoneal injections of polyinosinic-polycytidylic ribonucleic acid (pI-pC, Sigma) (26Kühn R.

Differences between groups were analyzed with a two-tailed Student's t test (Primer of Biostatistics, Version 3.0, McGraw Hill, 1992). In earlier studies, we showed that Cre-mediated excision of Rce1 eliminates the enzymatic activity responsible for the endoproteolytic processing of Ras proteins, causing retarded mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (6Kim E. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Taylor B. Ashby M. Shannon K. Casey P.J. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8383-8390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, an Rce1 gene excision had little effect on the growth of cultured fibroblasts (17Bergo M.O. Ambroziak P. Gregory C. George A. Otto J.C. Kim E. Nagase H. Casey P.J. Balmain A. Young S.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In the current project, we sought to define the consequences of inactivating Rce1 in the tissues of adult mice. We injected Cre adenovirus into the internal jugular vein of Rce1flx/flx mice, with the expectation that the adenovirus would be taken up almost exclusively by hepatocytes (after intravenous administration, adenovirus is taken up largely by the liver, Ref. 29Wang Y. Krushel L.A. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3932-3936Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We further expected that Cre in the liver would excise the coding sequences of Rce1 and reduce CAAX endoprotease activity. Indeed, Cre adenovirus did cause a significant decrease in CAAX endoprotease expression in the liver (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis of the Ras proteins in the liver revealed that approximately one-half of the Ras proteins had retarded electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 1B), indicating the complete loss of endoproteolytic processing in a significant fraction of the liver cells. We also inactivated Rce1 in the liver by breeding Rce1flx/flxMx1-Cre+/+ mice and then inducing Cre expression with injections of pI-pC (26Kühn R. Schwenk F. Aguet M. Rajewsky K. Science. 1995; 269: 1427-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar, 27Rohlmann A. Gotthardt M. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin.

Investig. 1999; 103: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). As judged by Southern blots, the excision of Rce1 in the livers of the pI-pC-treated mice was complete (Fig. 1C), and Rce1 activity levels were dramatically reduced (Fig. 1D). Despite the absence of Rce1 in the liver DNA, the pI-pC-treated Rce1flx/flxMx1-Cre+/+ mice gained weight and exhibited normal vitality over 2-3 months of observation. During this time, transaminase levels remained normal, and the histological appearance of the liver on hematoxylin/eosin-stained sections was indistinguishable from that of wild-type mice (not shown). To further explore the physiologic importance of CAAX protein endoproteolysis, we created mice lacking Rce1 in the heart, where Rce1 is expressed at very high levels (7Otto"
https://openalex.org/W2019031014,"The ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) 6 small GTPase regulates vesicle trafficking and cytoskeletal actin reorganization. The GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) catalyze the formation of inactive ARF6GDP. Centaurin-α1 contains an ARF GAP and two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, which bind the second messenger phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Here, we show that centaurin-α1 specifically inhibits in vivo GTP loading of ARF6 and redistribution of ARF6 from the endosomal compartment to the plasma membrane, which are indicative of its activation. Centaurin-α1 also inhibited cortical actin formation in a PIP3-dependent manner. Moreover, the constitutively active mutant of ARF6, but not that of ARF1, reverses the inhibition of cortical actin formation by centaurin-α1. An artificially plasma membrane-targeted centaurin-α1 bypasses the requirement of PIP3 for its involvement in ARF6 inactivation, suggesting that PIP3 is required for recruitment of centaurin-α1 to the plasma membrane but not for its activity. Together, these data suggest that centaurin-α1 negatively regulates ARF6 activity by functioning as an in vivo PIP3-dependent ARF6 GAP."

Despite these molecular and cellular differences, all four isoforms possess a conserved and well defined domain structure comprised of an amino-terminal dimerization/docking domain, two tandem cAMP-binding domains at the carboxyl terminus (designated Site A and Site B, respectively), and a variable, interconnecting linker region containing the primary docking site for the catalytic (C) subunit (Fig. 1A). A peripheral C-subunit-binding site has been localized in the A domain of RIα and RIIβ (7Huang L.J.-S. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26739-26746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Anand G.S. Hughes C.A. Jones J.M. Taylor S.S. Komives E.A. J. Mol.

Biol. 2003; 327: 1065-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The allosteric activation of the RIα holoenzyme is mediated by the sequential binding of cAMP first to the B domain, followed by a second cAMP binding to the A domain, and finally the release of an active C-subunit (10Ogreid D. Doskeland S.O. FEBS Lett. 1981; 129: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11Ogreid D. Doskeland S.O.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2934-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Although extensive sequence and structure similarities exist between the A and B domains and between the domains of the four R-subunit isoforms (13Canaves J.M. Taylor S.S. J. Mol Evol. 2002; 54: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the most conserved feature of this cAMP-binding module is the phosphate-binding cassette (PBC) (13Canaves J.M. Taylor S.S. J. Mol Evol. 2002; 54: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 14Diller T.C. Madhusudan Xuong N-h Taylor S.S. Structure. 2001; 9: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The PBC is embedded in an eight-stranded β barrel and forms a shell surrounding the phosphate moiety of cAMP, thus shielding the phosphodiester bond from hydrolysis by phosphodiesterases. The PBC contains the residues essential for cAMP binding. One of these essential residues is a conserved arginine that contacts the cAMP exocyclic-oxygen (Fig. 1) (14Diller T.C. Madhusudan Xuong N-h Taylor S.S. Structure. 2001; 9: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 15Su Y. Dostmann W.R. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N.H. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). This Arg uniquely integrates each cAMP-binding domain. In addition to hydrogen bonding with cAMP and stabilizing the PBC by hydrogen bonding to backbone atoms and to a stable water molecule, the Arg side chain also reaches out across and beyond the β barrel and anchors an extensive network of hydrogen bond interactions (Fig. 1, B and C). The conserved Arg of each PBC is thus strategically positioned to play a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity of the cAMP-binding domain.The importance of this Arg was first discovered in the cAMP-sensitive S49 mouse lymphoma cells, where wild-type cells are killed by excess cAMP due to apoptosis (16Daniel V. Litwack G. Tomkins G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 17Coffino P. Bourne H.R. Friedrich U. Hochman J. Insel P.A. Lemaire I. Melmon K.L.

Cells that were resistant to cAMP-induced apoptosis frequently contained mutated RIα-subunits that required higher levels of cAMP to be activated (19Friedrich U. Coffino P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Cell. 1977; 10: 381-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The sites of these mutations localized to the PBC in the cAMP-binding domains and included the conserved Arg (Fig. 1D) (21Steinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1086-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 22Clegg C.H. Correll L.A. Cadd G.G. McKnight G.S. J. Biol.

Mutation of the conserved Arg to Lys in either cAMP-binding domain of RIα reduces high affinity cAMP binding to the mutated domain by increasing the Kd(cAMP) ∼10-fold (12Herberg F.W. Taylor S.S. Dostmann W.R.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2934-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 24Bubis J. Neitzel J.J. Saraswat L.D. Taylor S.S. J. Biol.

Detailed studies using the conserved Arg to Lys mutations in RIα have allowed us to better understand the importance of these residues for the stability of the protein, for mediating cooperativity between the two binding domains, and for allosteric activation of the holoenzyme (12Herberg F.W. Taylor S.S. Dostmann W.R.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2934-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 26Steinberg R.A. Symcox M.M. Sollid S. Ogreid D. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15022-15031Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). They furthermore confirmed a “gatekeeper” model where cAMP binds first to the B domain. Only when the B domain is occupied by cAMP does the A domain become accessible to cAMP, thereby initiating activation.We describe here the effects of mutating the conserved Arg to Lys in the A and B domains of RIIβ. Although RIα is found in every mammalian cell, RIIβ is expressed in a cell-specific manner. RIIβ is the predominant isoform in brain and adipose tissue and is physiologically distinct from the RIα isoform (6Cummings D.E. Brandon E.P. Planas J.V. Motamed K. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. Nature. 1996; 382: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 28Amieux P.S. McKnight G.S. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: RC75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The R subunit isoforms are clearly not functionally redundant. For example, deletion of RIα is embryonically lethal (28Amieux P.S. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3993-3998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), whereas deletion of RIIβ leads to a lean phenotype and a preference for and tolerance of alcohol (6Cummings D.E. Brandon E.P. Planas J.V. Motamed K. Idzerda R.L. McKnight G.S. Nature. 1996; 382: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 31Thiele T.E. Willis B. Stadler J. Reynolds J.G. Bernstein I.L. McKnight G.S. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: RC75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of the crystallographic structures also suggested that the allosteric pathways of activation are likely to be different in these two isoforms (14Diller T.C. Madhusudan Xuong N-h Taylor S.S. Structure. 2001; 9: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).To determine the role of each conserved Arg and the contribution of each cAMP-binding domain to the formation and functioning of the type IIβ holoenzyme complex, each conserved Arg in RIIβ (R230K in the A domain and R359K in the B domain) was replaced with Lys. Similar to RIα, the conserved arginines play an integral role in maintaining the structural integrity of each cAMP-binding domain and the allosteric communication across and between the two cAMP-binding domains. The arginines also influence allosteric communication between the cAMP-binding domains and the C-subunit but, surprisingly, by a different mechanism than in RIα.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMutagenesis, Protein Expression, and Purification—Single-site mutations were introduced into the rat RIIβ subunit (32Zawadzki K.M. Pan C.-P. Johnson D. Barkley M.D. Taylor S.S. Proteins. 2003; 51: 552-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) using the Kunkel method such that either Arg-230 in the A domain or Arg-359 in the B domain was replaced with Lys. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing the entire plasmid. Expression and purification of wild-type RIIβ and a deletion mutant protein lacking the entire B domain was carried out as described previously (32Zawadzki K.M. Pan C.-P. Johnson D. Barkley M.D. Taylor S.S. Proteins. 2003; 51: 552-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The two Arg mutant RIIβ proteins were purified by co-lysis with a poly-His-tagged C-subunit (33Hemmer W. McGlone M. Taylor S.S. Analyt. Biochem. 1997; 245: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Pellets from cells expressing poly-His C-subunit (4 liters) were co-lysed with cells expressing the mutant R-subunit (6 liters) in lysis buffer (20 mm MOPS, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% Triton X-100, pH 8.0). The mass of the C-subunit pellet was twice the mass of the R-subunit pellet, which corresponded to a 10-20% molar excess of C-subunit. Following lysis, the supernatant was incubated with nickel-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C, the resin was washed with lysis buffer, and the R-subunit was eluted with lysis buffer containing 10 mm cAMP. The protein eluates were then immediately dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in 20 mm MOPS, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm DTT, pH 7.0. Typical yields were 0.5-1 mg/liter of cell culture. Protein Characterization—The cAMP:R monomer stoichiometry was determined by UV absorption (34Builder S.E. Beavo J.A. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 225: 2350-2354Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). After removing unbound cAMP by gel filtration, protein aliquots (8 μm) were precipitated by adding trichloroacetic acid (final concentration of 10%), incubating on ice for 30 min, and centrifuging at high speed (4 °C for 10 min). The cAMP concentration was determined from the A260 of the supernatant solutions. CD measurements were acquired using an AVIV 202 CD spectropolarimeter. Fluorescence measurements were carried out with a SPEX Fluoromax-2 spectrofluorometer.Urea Unfolding of the RIIβ Subunits—A stock solution of 8.5 m urea was prepared in buffer containing 25 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, pH 7.4, as previously described (32Zawadzki K.M. Pan C.-P. Johnson D. Barkley M.D. Taylor S.S. Proteins. 2003; 51: 552-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Proteins were unfolded in designated concentrations of urea for 2 h at room temperature and monitored by fluorescence. Overnight incubation produced no additional changes in the fluorescence emission or CD spectra of the wild-type or R230K mutant protein. The R359K mutant protein required an overnight incubation to reach equilibrium. Each protein could fold and unfold reversibly. Fractional unfolding curves were constructed assuming a two-state model and using the following relationship, FU=1-[(R-RU)/(RF-RU)]where FU is the fraction of the unfolded protein, R is the fluorescence or CD measurement, and RF and RU represent the values of R for the folded and unfolded states, respectively (35Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar). Free energy of denaturation, ΔGU, at each urea concentration in the transition region of the denaturation curves were calculated from the fraction of folded and unfolded protein according to the following relationship, -RTIn(FN/FU)=ΔGUwhere FN is the fraction of folded protein. The ΔGU for the unfolded protein at zero concentration of denaturant, ΔGUH2O, was calculated by linear extrapolation (35Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar) using the equation, ΔGU=ΔGUH2O-m[urea]The slope, m, and ΔGUH2O values were used to define the concentration midpoint, Cm, for each protein denaturation curve through the relationship, Cm=ΔGUH2O/mHoloenzyme Formation—Holoenzyme was formed by dialyzing the C- and R-subunits in a molar ratio of 1.2:1 overnight at 4 °C against 20 mm MES, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, pH 6.5. Excess C-subunit was removed by gel filtration on an S200 column (Amersham Biosciences).Biotin-Maleimide Labeling of K16C C-subunit—A mutated form of the C-subunit, where Lys-16 was replaced with Cys, was labeled as described previously using 5-fold molar excess of biotin-maleimide (BM) (36Gangal M. Cox S. Lew J. Clifford T. Garrod S.M. Aschbaher M. Taylor S.S. Johnson D.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13728-13735Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Excess β-mercaptoethanol and unreacted BM were removed by elution through a Micro BioSpin P-30 Tris chromatography column. Ellman's reagent was used as instructed in the Pierce catalog to verify that only one Cys was labeled per mole of C-subunit (37Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21088) Google Scholar).Surface Plasmon Resonance—Surface plasmon resonance was used to study the interaction between the K16C mutant of the C-subunit and wild-type and mutant RIIβ subunits using a BIAcore 3000 instrument (Amersham Biosciences/Biosensor). The BM-K16C C-subunit was immobilized to a streptavidin surface sensor chip (BIAcore) through a biotin-streptavidin linkage. All binding interactions were performed at 25 °C in running buffer containing 20 mm MOPS, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.005% polysorbate 20, pH 7.0 (12Herberg F.W. Taylor S.S. Dostmann W.R.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2934-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). After injection of the R-subunit, the C-subunit surface was regenerated by injection of 10 μl of 100 μm cAMP and 5 mm EDTA in running buffer. Kinetic constants were calculated using the BIAcore pseudo-first order rate equation. Affinity constants were calculated from the equation, Kd = kdissoc/kassoc (12Herberg F.W. Taylor S.S. Dostmann W.R.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2934-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Holoenzyme Activation—Assays were performed using the continuous enzyme-linked coupled spectrophotometric method described by Cook et al. (38Cook P.F. Neville M.E. Vrana K.E. Hartl F.T. Roskoski R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5794-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) with an assay mix containing 1 mm ATP and 10 mm MgCl2. Holoenzyme (10 nm) was incubated for 2 min at room temperature with varying concentrations of cAMP. Each assay was initiated by the addition of Kemptide (final concentration 200 μm).RESULTSPurification and Characterization of the Arginine Mutant ProteinsThe conserved Arg to Lys mutant proteins were purified by co-lysis with His6C-subunit (33Hemmer W. McGlone M. Taylor S.S. Analyt. Biochem. 1997; 245: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) rather than with cAMP-agarose resin because of their tendency to aggregate. Because the purified wild-type R-subunit dimer retains four stably bound cAMP molecules that cannot be removed by dialysis, a cAMP-free wild-type protein (apoprotein) was obtained by eluting the R-subunit from cAMP-agarose resin using cGMP rather than cAMP. 2J. Jones, personal communication. Completely cAMP-free Arg mutant proteins were not obtainable as the cGMP-eluted mutant proteins because of their propensity to aggregate.The effects of the mutations on high affinity cAMP binding was seen in the reduced stoichiometry (moles of cAMP bound per mole of R-subunit monomer) of 1.23 ± 0.06 and 1.1 ± 0.1 for the R230K and R359K mutant proteins, respectively, compared with wild-type RIIβ where 2.1 ± 0.3 mol of cAMP remain bound per R-subunit monomer. Thus, the Arg-to-Lys mutant proteins contained only one cAMP-saturated binding site following purification.Local and Global Structural Changes following RIIβ MutationsCircular dichroism was employed to determine whether the global backbone structures of RIIβ were altered as a result of the mutations. The far-UV CD spectrum of each protein revealed subtle differences in the mean residue ellipticity intensities at the 209- and 222-nm minima, indicating that the secondary structures of the proteins are very similar but not identical (Fig. 2A). The CD spectrum of wild-type apo-RIIβ demonstrates that the subtle differences in the spectra cannot be attributed simply to the removal of cAMP.Fig. 2A, far-UV circular dichroism spectra of wild-type (○), R230K (□), R359K (▵), and apo- (⋄) RIIβ. Samples (1 μm) were scanned from 260 to 200 nm at 25 °C with a 6-s averaging time. B, comparison of the fluorescence emission spectra of wild-type and arginine mutants of RIIβ. Samples (1 μm) were excited at 295 nm at 25 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Endogenous tryptophan fluorescence was used to probe the local environment surrounding the endogenous tryptophan. Whereas RIIβ contains two endogenous tryptophans, Trp-58 in the linker region and Trp-243 in cAMP-binding domain A, the tryptophan fluorescence of wild-type RIIβ is due almost exclusively to Trp-243 (32Zawadzki K.M. Pan C.-P. Johnson D. Barkley M.D. Taylor S.S. Proteins. 2003; 51: 552-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Fluorescence emission spectra of the wild-type, R230K, and R359K mutant proteins, thus, most likely reports the fluorescence emission from Trp-243 in the A domain. The identical maximum emission wavelengths, λmax, for the proteins (Fig. 2B) indicate that the mutations do not change the polarity of the Trp reporter local environment. The quenching of the Trp reporters, however, is altered as demonstrated by the 11% increase, relative to wild-type RIIβ, in fluorescence emission intensity at 334 nm for R230K and the 26 and 21% decrease in emission intensity for apo- and R359K RIIβ, respectively. The local environment surrounding Trp-243 is therefore altered to some extent by the mutations. Surprisingly, the significant amount of quenching that results from removal of cAMP in wild-type RIIβ is mimicked by mutation of Arg-359 in the B domain and not by mutation of Arg-230, which is in closer proximity to cAMP bound to the A domain and in the same domain as Trp-243. Domain A can thus sense whether or not cAMP is bound to domain B.Characterization of RIIβ Stability Using Urea Denaturation and Endogenous Trp FluorescenceThe sensitivity of the RIIβ subunits to urea denaturation was used to compare the stability of the mutant proteins to the wild-type protein (Fig. 3 and Table I). Because most of the fluorescence is due to Trp-243 in the A domain, the stability within the A domain is, in effect, being monitored by this method. RIIβ is most stable when both cAMP-binding sites are saturated with cAMP but mutation in the B domain, and removal of cAMP from both domains each causes only a modest decrease in A domain stability. This decrease in the stability of the A domain following mutation of the B domain again indicates interdomain communication.Fig. 3Urea-induced fraction unfolded curves for the RIIβ-subunits as monitored by fluorescence. Each protein is designated as follows: wild-type (•), R230K (▪), R359K (▴), and apo- (○) RIIβ. Unfolding of the proteins (1 μm, 25 °C) was monitored by following the change in ratio of intensity at 356/334 upon excitation at 295 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IUnfolding parameters of wild-type and mutant RIIβ-subunitsProteinΔGUH2OCmmkcal/molmkcal/molmWT10.4±0.65.40±0.031.9±0.1R230K3.8±0.23.15±0.031.21±0.06R359K8.2±0.44.63±0.041.78±0.09Apo7.4±0.24.44±0.061.68±0.04 Open table in a new tab In contrast, mutation of Arg-230 had a much more significant effect on stability and is more perturbing than removal of cAMP. The fact that removal of cAMP alone does not have a comparable destabilizing effect to R230K indicates that this reduced stability is attributed to mutation of Arg-230 rather than removal of cAMP. The dramatic decrease in the Cm value demonstrates that the Trp reporter clearly senses the network of interactions that radiate from Arg-230 and that Arg-230 is critical for not only cAMP binding but also for maintaining the structural integrity of the A domain.Effect of RIIβ Conserved Arginine Mutations on cAPK ActivationHaving shown how mutation of the conserved arginines in RIIβ affected the protein structure and stability, we next investigated whether these mutations altered RIIβ function. Specifically, did these mutations affect activation of cAPK? To answer this question, one must investigate each of the three components of cAPK activation: 1) binding of cAMP, described by cAMP affinity, Kd(cAMP), 2) binding to the C-subunit, described by C-subunit affinity (Kd), and 3) activation, described by the activation constant (Ka).cAMP Binding Affinity—The affinity of the mutated PBC for cAMP was determined using the fluorescent cAMP analog 1,N6-etheno-cAMP and monitoring the change in fluorescence of the analog upon binding to the R-subunit. As anticipated, mutation of the conserved Arg weakens cAMP binding. The Kd(cAMP) of the mutated binding sites was 1.8 ± 0.4 μm and 0.82 ± 0.03 μm for the R230K and R359K mutant proteins, respectively. This represents a 30- and 14-fold increase for the R230K and R359K mutant proteins, respectively, when compared with the overall cAMP binding to wild-type RIIβ (60 ± 10 nm).Quantitation of R-C Interactions—Surface plasmon resonance was used to quantitate binding interactions between the K16C C-subunit and the R-subunits (Fig. 4A). For wild-type RIIβ, the affinity was measured both in the absence and presence of cAMP; the apoprotein showed a Kd of 0.6 nm, whereas the cAMP-bound wild-type protein showed a 15-fold greater Kd (9 nm; Table II). Due to an increased kassoc, the Kd for the R230K mutant protein was decreased slightly compared with the apo form of wild-type RIIβ but was still within experimental error. Compared with the cAMP-bound RIIβ, the R230K mutant protein showed a 4-fold decrease in kdissoc and a 6-fold increase in kassoc, yielding a 22-fold decrease in Kd. Thus the effect of the Arg-230 mutation was more comparable to the effect of removing cAMP from wild-type RIIβ even though, with this mutant, the B domain is still saturated with cAMP.Fig. 4C-subunit and RIIβ interactions. A, electrographs for apo-RIIβ and BM-K16C C-subunit binding using BIAcore. The BM-K16C C-subunit was immobilized and binding of the R-subunit was monitored. Data are representative of that collected for the Arg mutant proteins and cAMP-bound wild-type. B, activation of holoenzymes by cAMP. Holoenzyme (10 nm) was incubated with increasing concentrations of cAMP. Kinase activity was measured and expressed as a percentage of activity of C-subunit at maximum [cAMP].

https://openalex.org/W2055258480,"In accord with the central role c-Myc plays in control of cell growth and death, the stability of this protein is tightly regulated. Although the NH2-terminal domain of c-Myc has been implicated in the regulation of its stability, c-Myc-S, which lacks this domain, is equally unstable, pointing to the role of additional domains in the regulation of c-Myc stability. Our former studies revealed that amino acids (aa) 127-189 of c-Myc are responsible for stress-induced stability of the c-Myc protein. This region of c-Myc shares homology with the δ domain of c-Jun, which is required for JNK association and subsequent targeting of c-Jun for ubiquitination under non-stressed growth conditions. Here we demonstrate that JNK associates with, and mediates, c-Myc ubiquitination and degradation. Addition of JNK increased the degree of c-Myc ubiquitination in in vitro ubiquitination reactions. Increased c-Myc stability following MEKK1/JNK stimuli is abolished upon mutation within the δ-like domain of c-Myc (aa 166-181), as well as deletion of aa 127-189. Significantly, inhibition of JNK expression via small interfering RNA increased c-Myc protein expression. Similarly, squelching JNK association with c-Myc by overexpression of a peptide corresponding to aa 127-189 of c-Myc increased endogenous c-Myc stability and elevated the fraction of cells within the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. In all, these findings point to the contribution of JNK to the regulation of c-Myc protein stability under normal growth conditions. In accord with the central role c-Myc plays in control of cell growth and death, the stability of this protein is tightly regulated. Although the NH2-terminal domain of c-Myc has been implicated in the regulation of its stability, c-Myc-S, which lacks this domain, is equally unstable, pointing to the role of additional domains in the regulation of c-Myc stability. Our former studies revealed that amino acids (aa) 127-189 of c-Myc are responsible for stress-induced stability of the c-Myc protein. This region of c-Myc shares homology with the δ domain of c-Jun, which is required for JNK association and subsequent targeting of c-Jun for ubiquitination under non-stressed growth conditions. Here we demonstrate that JNK associates with, and mediates, c-Myc ubiquitination and degradation. Addition of JNK increased the degree of c-Myc ubiquitination in in vitro ubiquitination reactions. Increased c-Myc stability following MEKK1/JNK stimuli is abolished upon mutation within the δ-like domain of c-Myc (aa 166-181), as well as deletion of aa 127-189. Significantly, inhibition of JNK expression via small interfering RNA increased c-Myc protein expression. Similarly, squelching JNK association with c-Myc by overexpression of a peptide corresponding to aa 127-189 of c-Myc increased endogenous c-Myc stability and elevated the fraction of cells within the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. In all, these findings point to the contribution of JNK to the regulation of c-Myc protein stability under normal growth conditions. The c-myc protooncogene is a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factor involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 1Potter M.

As a critical regulator of these distinct cellular functions, expression of c-Myc is tightly regulated at multiple levels, including transcription, as well as mRNA and protein stability (1Potter M. Marcu K.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 224: 1-17PubMed Google Scholar). c-Myc protein has a relatively short half-life of about 20-30 min (2Luscher B. Eisenman R.N. Mol.

The amino-terminal domain of c-myc, and specifically, two highly conserved regions, box I and box II, have been implicated in regulation of c-Myc protein stability (4Salghetti S.E. Kim S.Y. Tansey W.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 7Flinn E.M. Busch C.M. Wright A.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5961-5969Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, a naturally occurring form of c-Myc, c-Myc S, which lacks box I and most of the transactivation domain, exhibits a similar half-life as full-length c-Myc, pointing to the role of other c-Myc protein regions in regulation of c-Myc protein stability (12Chen L. Smith L. Accavitti-Loper M.A. Omura S. Bingham Smith J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Furthermore, c-Myc S mediates a number of c-Myc-specific functions, including repression of transcription from several promoters, regulation of proliferation and apoptosis, as well as rescue of phenotypes in myc null fibroblasts (13Mateyak M.K.

The expression of c-myc is regulated differently in normal growth conditions than under conditions of cellular stress or in human cancers, albeit with different outcomes of c-myc function. For example, human Papillomavirus E6-16 high risk oncoprotein, but not the low risk E6-11 oncoprotein, was shown to induce the ubiquitin-dependent, proteasomal degradation of Myc (11Gross-Mesilaty S. Reinstein E. Bercovich B. Tobias K.E. Schwartz A.L. Kahana C. Ciechanover A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8058-8063Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), presumably acting to prevent apoptotic induction by c-Myc. However, significant increases in c-Myc protein half-life have been noted in human glioma and in Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines (4Salghetti S.E. Kim S.Y. Tansey W.P.

The opposing level of c-Myc proteins in different tumor types suggests that regulation of c-Myc stability is adjusted depending on its cell type-specific function. Point mutations frequently found to occur around Thr-58 and Ser-62 within the transactivation domain of c-Myc have been associated with increased c-Myc protein stability (4Salghetti S.E. Kim S.Y.

Regulation of c-Myc protein stability as well as subsequent gene activation and S phase induction have been associated with Ras signaling (6Sears R. Leone G. DeGregori J. Nevins J.R. Mol.

However, mutation of c-myc is not essential for its stabilization in certain Burkitt's lymphoma cells, suggesting that other mechanisms may contribute to the regulation of c-Myc protein stability (8Gregory M.A. Hann S.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 2423-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The stability of several transcription factors, including c-Jun, ATF2, JunB, and p53, was shown to be affected by JNK (5Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Yin Z. Wu X. Jones S.N. Ronai Z.

JNK-targeted ubiquitination and degradation of these transcription factors takes place under normal, non-stressed conditions, when JNK is not active as a kinase (reviewed in Ref. 31Fuchs S.Y. Fried V.A. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1483-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In all cases, JNK serves as an adaptor to an unknown ligase, different from those implicated in the regulation of the stability of these proteins (i.e. independent of Mdm2, in the case of p53; (5Fuchs S.Y.

We previously identified a novel region of c-Myc from aa 127-189 involved in mediating an MEKK1-dependent, stress-induced increase in c-Myc protein stability (32Alarcon-Vargas D. Tansey W.P. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4384-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this study, we further characterize the role of aa 127-189 in mediating altered c-Myc stability under normal growth conditions. Here we identify JNK as a targeting factor that increases the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of c-Myc via a δ-like domain on c-Myc. In addition, we developed a peptide of aa 127-189 of c-Myc capable of blocking endogenous c-Myc degradation by competing for JNK binding, resulting in altered cell cycle distribution. Cell Culture—TIG-3, normal human lung fibroblasts, and NIH3T3, mouse embryo fibroblasts, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Inc.) supplemented with 10% calf serum (Invitrogen) and 100 units and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Mediatech, Inc.). MCF-7, breast carcinoma cells, 293T, human adenovirus-transformed kidney cells expressing SV40 large T antigen cells, and HeLa, cervical carcinoma cells, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 100 units and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Mediatech, Inc.). Cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2.

Ting A.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6034-6045Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified for integrity by sequencing. Bacterial Protein Expression—pTrcHis A MycWT and MycΔC were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21. Cultures were grown to OD 0.6 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The bacterial pellet was lysed in buffer with 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole. After a brief sonication, the lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Cleared supernatant was then incubated with 50% Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) on a rotator for 1 h at 4 °C. Myc proteins bound to the beads were washed and eluted against a buffer with 250 mm imidazole and dialyzed against a solution containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 5% glycerol. Proteins were again bound to 50% Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen), and then washed and analyzed for purity and concentration by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining using bovine serum albumin (Pierce) as a standard. In Vitro Ubiquitination—Empty nickel NTA beads (Qiagen) or nickel beads bound to bacterially expressed MycWT or MycΔC (deleted of aa 127-189) cloned in pTrcA his vector (Invitrogen) were preincubated for targeting with control buffer (composed of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride); or with 100 μg of TIG-3 cell extract lysed with lysis buffer composed of control buffer with 350 mm NaCl and 20% glycerol; or with 2 μg of purified JNK (isolated from extracts by c-Jun protein coupled to GST beads) as indicated for 30 min at 37 °C, and then washed four times in control buffer and one time in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol. In vitro ubiquitination in the presence of ubiquitination buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm NaF, 3 μm okadaic acid), 2 μg of ubiquitin HA, 2 mm ATP, 1.5 mm ATPγS, and rabbit reticulocyte lysate depleted of JNK by preincubation with GST-c-Jun beads was performed for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped using STOP buffer (8 m urea, pH 6.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40), beads were washed three times in STOP buffer and one time with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protein complexes were eluted in 3× SDS sample buffer. The proteins were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE gels, and the upper portion of the blot was probed with HA antibody (12CA5; Berkeley Antibody) to detect polyubiquitin HA complexes formed on c-Myc, whereas the lower portion of the blot was probed with c-Myc polyclonal antibody (Sigma) to confirm the loading of equal amounts of c-Myc in the reactions compared. Transfection—TIG-3, normal human lung fibroblasts, were transfected with 4 μg of the Myc forms indicated under “Results” and 400 ng of the kinases indicated using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent, according to manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). MCF-7, breast carcinoma cells, and HeLa, cervical carcinoma cells, were transiently transfected with the indicated constructs (see Fig. 3) using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). 293T, human adenovirus-transformed kidney cells expressing SV40 large T antigen, were transfected using calcium phosphate with gag-pol, VSV-G, and pRS plasmids as described (36He K.L. Ting A.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6034-6045Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). MCF-7, breast carcinoma cells, were transfected with 4 μg of the HA-GFP (V-GFP), or Myc-pepWT, Myc-pep2PM, or Myc-pep4PM, with and without 0.8 μg of pBabe puro using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). Stable Cell Line Production—MCF-7 stable mass cultures were established by co-transfection of the peptides described above and V-GFP vector as control along with pBabe puro for selection using lipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). Cells were selected using 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) treatment for 2 weeks, and selected cells were sterile-sorted based on GFP expression to enrich for the GFP-positive population by MoFlo high speed cell sorter (Flow Cytometry Shared Research Facility, Mount Sinai). Whole cell extract was used in direct Western analysis (see Fig. 3, WCE lanes) and for immunoprecipitation using HA antibody (12CA5; Berkeley Antibody). Cycloheximide Chase—Equal numbers of transfected MCF-7 cells (as outlined above) were plated. 24 h later, cells were treated with 20 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) for 40 or 80 min or untreated (0 min). Cells were harvested, and proteins were prepared and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Immunoblot analysis was performed using c-Myc polyclonal antibody (Sigma). The blots were stripped and reprobed using HA antibody (12CA5; Berkeley Antibody), as well as monoclonal β-actin antibody (Sigma). Chemical Treatment—TIG-3 cells were treated 24 h after transfection with Me2SO (Sigma) or 40 μm MG132 (Peptides International) for 4 h before harvesting for co-immunoprecipitation. Co-immunoprecipitation—TIG-3 cells were transiently transfected with V5-tagged c-Myc and were treated 24 h after transfection with Me2SO (Sigma) or 40 μm MG132 (Peptides International) for 4 h before harvesting. Immunoprecipitation (IP) of V5 Myc was performed using V5 antibody (Invitrogen), IP of JNK was performed using monoclonal JNK antibody (Pharmingen), and IP of HA was performed using HA antibody (Berkeley Antibody) on 1 mg of total protein at 4 °C for 16 h. Protein G agarose beads (Invitrogen) were incubated with reaction mixtures at 4 °C for 2 h. Immune complexes were washed in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered salt solution (Mediatech, Inc.) two times followed by three times without 0.5 m lithium chloride (Sigma). Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-sample buffer and separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with Myc polyclonal antibody (RDI). The blot was then stripped and incubated with JNK monoclonal antibody (666; Pharmingen) or JNK polyclonal antibodies (Pocono Rabbit Farm, Poconos, PA). Small Interfering RNA Infection—3T3 cells were infected for 16 h with 4 μg/ml polybrene and retroviral supernatant collected from 293T cells co-transfected with gag-pol and VSV-G along either with empty pRS vector (pRS-C) or with pRS vector containing small interfering RNA against JNK (pRS-JNK) prepared as described (36He K.L. Ting A.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 6034-6045Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Following change to fresh media, cells were harvested after 48 h. 100 μg of cell lysate was run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotted using Myc polyclonal antibody (Sigma). The blot was stripped and reprobed with antibodies to JNK (666; Pharmingen) to confirm reduction of JNK, as well as with β-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) to confirm equal protein loading. Results shown are representative of three experiments. Immunoblotting—Proteins were prepared 48 h after transfection using lysis buffer (control buffer with 350 mm NaCl and 20% glycerol) with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and protein concentrations were determined using Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce) and bovine serum albumin (Pierce) as standard. Proteins were boiled in SDS-sample buffer and separated on SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in TBST (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) at room temperature for 1 h and incubated either for 1 h at room temperature or for 16 h at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies followed by washes in TBST and incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody at a 1:10,000 dilution (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. Following washes in TBST, bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) according to manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies—Immunoblot for HA-tagged proteins was performed using monoclonal HA antibody (12CA5; Berkeley Antibody). Immunoblot for bacterially expressed Myc and endogenous c-Myc was performed using polyclonal Myc antibody (Sigma), unless otherwise indicated. Immunoblot of JNK was performed using monoclonal antibodies to JNK (666; Pharmingen) or JNK polyclonal antibody (Pocono Rabbit Farm). Immunoblot for β-actin was performed using monoclonal antibodies to β-actin (Sigma). Immunoprecipitation of V5-Myc complex was performed using monoclonal V5 antibody (Invitrogen). Immunocytochemistry—HeLa cells plated on coverslips in 6-well dishes were transfected with 0.5 μg of pcDNA FLAG-MycWT and 1 μg of GFP peptides using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). 24 h later, cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, 2% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100, 3 mm MgCl2, and 6.8% sucrose for 5 min on ice, and blocked for 1 h in 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature. Cells were incubated with FLAG polyclonal primary antibody diluted 1:500 (Sigma) or normal rabbit Ig (Molecular Probes) as a negative control for 30 min at room temperature, and then cells were washed and incubated with Alexa red 568 secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:1,000 for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) for 1 min at room temperature to stain DNA and visualize the nucleus. Staining was visualized using a four-channel UV confocal laser scanning microscope (Microscopy Shared Research Facility, Mount Sinai). FACS Analysis—Duplicate sets of TIG-3 cells were transfected with the indicated constructs using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). 24 h later, one set of cells was trypsinized, fixed with ice-cold ethanol, and stained with propidium iodide (PI). Flow cytometry analysis was performed using a FACScalibur (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with CellQuest software. The control panel (see Fig. 6, No GFP) represents a profile obtained with cells that were transfected with empty vector. The other profiles shown reflect GFP-positive, PI-positive cells. A δ Domain-like Region Is Required for MEKK1-mediated Increase in c-Myc Expression—Using a panel of c-myc deletion mutants in which successive regions of 60 amino acids were deleted, we have previously identified aa 127-189 as the region of c-Myc that mediates an increase in c-Myc protein stability following MEKK1 stimuli (32Alarcon-Vargas D.

C2 domains are structurally similar and are characterized by a β sandwich composed of two four-stranded β sheets and loops connecting the strands (14Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15879-15882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). In response to increases in [Ca2+]i, three loops at one end of the structure coordinate the binding of 2 or 3 Ca2+ and together define the membrane-interacting surface of the C2 domain. In the case of cPLA2,Ca2+ binding neutralizes the negative charge at the tips of the Ca2+ binding loops, allowing hydrophobic residues in the C2 domain to insert into the lipid surface and stabilize membrane association (5Perisic O.

Two early reports investigating full-length and isolated C2 domain binding have reported Ca2+ requirements in the range of 100-300 nm for cPLA2 membrane association in vitro (4Nalefski E.A.

Chem. 1990; 265: 5409-5413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, most in vitro studies have used the isolated C2 domain and have reported a minimum [Ca2+] of between ∼2 and 11 μm for membrane binding (6Bittova L. Sumandea M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9665-9672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 16Xu G.-Y. McDonagh T. Hsiang-Ai Y. Nalefski E.A. Clark J.D. Cumming D.A. J. Mol.

Diverse experimental conditions make comparisons between the in vitro studies difficult to interpret, but the magnitude of the [Ca2+] predicted for binding from most of the in vitro studies is higher than would be expected in vivo for a cytosolic protein that responds to agonist-mediated [Ca2+]i changes. An investigation of membrane binding in vivo reported that the [Ca2+]i requirements for full-length and isolated C2 domain membrane association to be ∼120 nm for Golgi and ∼250 nm for ER membranes (8Evans J.H. Spencer D.M. Zweifach A. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30150-30160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar).Investigation of full-length cPLA2 binding in vivo has demonstrated that, following Ca2+-dependent membrane association, the full-length cPLA2 remains associated with membranes in a Ca2+-independent manner (8Evans J.H.

This suggests a possible role for the catalytic domain, or cooperativity between the C2 and catalytic domains in prolonging membrane residence time. Although studies have evaluated dissociation kinetics of the cPLA2 C2 domain in vitro (20Nalefski E.A. Slazas M.M. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12011-12018Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 21Nalefski E.A. Wisner M.A. Chen J.Z. Sprang S.R. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3089-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), there are few in vitro studies to date that have evaluated the contribution of the catalytic domain in Ca2+-independent association with membrane (24Bayburt T. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3216-3231Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We have used imaging of fluorescent protein-cPLA2 chimeras to investigate further the role of the cPLA2 catalytic domain in regulating membrane association and residence time in living cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSFluorescent Protein Constructs—For imaging studies, DNAs encoding wild-type human cPLA2 and the cPLA2 C2 domain (residues 1-749 and 17-148, respectively; GenBank™ accession no. M72393) were cloned into the vector pEGFP-C3 (Clontech) to create pEGFP-cPLA2, and pEGFP-cPLA2C2, as previously described (8Evans J.H. Spencer D.M. Zweifach A. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30150-30160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). pECFP-cPLA2W464G, pECFP-cPLA2W464A, and pECFP-cPLA2W464F were made from pECFP-cPLA2 by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). pECFP-GT, a Golgi marker encoding the N-terminal 82 residues of β-1,4-galactosyltransferase, was purchased from Clontech. The pEYFP plasmid used in this study was constructed from pEYFP-C1 (Clontech) by introducing a Q70M mutation by site directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) to improve its qualities (25Griesbeck O. Baird G.S. Campbell R.E. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29188-29194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Different color fluorescent protein constructs were produced by interchanging NheI/BsrGI fragments encoding the fluorescent protein-encoding region between constructs. Expression of FP-tagged wild-type and mutant proteins at the predicted molecular weights was confirmed by immunoblot of protein lysates from MDCK cells transfected with each construct. A band at ∼135 kDa was observed in protein lysates from cells expressing pECFP-cPLA2W464A, pECFP-cPLA2W464G, and pECFP-cPLA2W464F, which migrated at the same molecular weight as pEGFP-cPLA2 (data not shown) (8Evans J.H. Spencer D.M. Zweifach A. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30150-30160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that pEGFP-cPLA2C2 is expressed at the predicted molecular weight in MDCK cells (8Evans J.H. Spencer D.M. Zweifach A. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30150-30160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing.Cell Culture—MDCK cells obtained from ATCC were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.292 mg/ml glutamine in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Subconfluent cells (1 × 104 cells/cm2) were transfected with the relevant plasmid(s) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.292 mg/ml glutamine following the protocol from the manufacturer.Microscopy of Fluorescent Proteins—Transfected MDCK cells grown on glass-bottomed culture dishes (MatTek) were washed with and incubated in Hanks' balanced salt solution additionally buffered with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (HHBSS). Cells were imaged using an Olympus inverted microscope equipped with a 60×, 1.25 numeric aperture oil immersion objective, ECFP and EYFP emission filters (Chroma) in a Sutter filter wheel, a ECFP/EYFP dichroic mirror, and a TILL Imago CCD camera (TILL Photonics). Excitation light of 430 and 510 nm for ECFP and EYFP, respectively, was provided using a Polychrome IV monochromator (TILL Photonics). TILLvisION software was used for acquisition and analysis. Final images were produced using Adobe PhotoShop. Contamination of ECFP fluorescence into the EYFP channel was <0.2%, and <0.35% for EYFP into the ECFP channel.FP fluorescence at Golgi (FPGolgi) with respect to time was determined for a region of interest (ROI) corresponding to an area of Golgi membrane (ROIGolgi) by the following method. Background-corrected average pixel values were determined for ROIGolgi at each time point. Because of photobleaching of the FPs during the course of the experiments, bleach correction factors were calculated for each time point by first determining the background-corrected average pixel values for an ROI corresponding to the entire cell (ROIcell) and then normalizing those values to the initial value at t = 0. The background- and bleach-corrected fluorescence value, Ft, was calculated by dividing the background-corrected average pixel value for ROIGolgi at each time point by the bleach correction factor at the corresponding time point. The normalized fluorescence at Golgi was calculated by dividing Ft by the t = 0 fluorescence value, F0, to yield Ft/F0. Because the Ft/F0 values are equivalent to the integrated fluorescence from the ROIGolgi divided by the integrated fluorescence from the ROIcell, the Ft/F0 values are proportional to the fraction of the total cellular fluorescence in the area of the Golgi. In addition, because ROIGolgi and ROIcell were identical for ECFP and EYFP images, direct comparisons of ECFPGolgi and EYFPGolgi with respect to time in the same cell could be made.Ca2+ Clamp Conditions—Transfected cells in glass-bottomed dishes were treated with buffer containing 3 mm EGTA in HHBSS (EH buffer) for >45 min to deplete internal Ca2+ stores, and then made permeable to [Ca2+]i with 10 μm ionomycin in EH buffer. Cells exhibiting translocation after ionomycin addition were excluded from study. For the experiments to determine membrane association at static [Ca2+]i (Figs. 1 and 8), a small volume of 100 mm CaCl2 (∼20-23 μl, depending on the experiment) was added to 1 ml of the ionomycin/EH buffer covering the cells, the buffer was mixed, and the [Ca2+]i allowed to establish an equilibrium with [Ca2+]e for >5 min before imaging. The process of CaCl2 addition, in increments of 2-3 μl, mixing, equilibration, and imaging was repeated for each [Ca2+]e step. As previously reported (8Evans J.H. Spencer D.M. Zweifach A. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30150-30160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), this treatment results in incremental increases in [Ca2+]i in the physiological range of ∼10-600 nm that remain stable for >10 min; however, the [Ca2+]i was lower than the [Ca2+]e at equilibrium.Fig. 8cPLA2W464G requires a higher [Ca2+]i than cPLA2C2 for membrane association. MDCK cells co-expressing EYFP-cPLA2C2 (A-C) and ECFP-cPLA2W464G (D-F) were subjected to calcium clamp conditions as outlined under “Materials and Methods.” CaCl2 was added in discreet steps in ∼10-min intervals, and image pairs were taken at each step.

[Ca2+]i increases were stimulated by exchanging the buffer over the cells with 1 ml of EH buffer containing 2.5 mm CaCl2 and 10 μm ionomycin at the times indicated. To decrease [Ca2+]i, 1 ml of EH buffer was added at the times indicated.Fig. 2cPLA2 C2 domain functions as a [Ca2+]i sensor.A, CaCl2 was added at 7.5 s after the start of imaging and EGTA at 247.5 s to cells expressing EGFP-cPLA2C2 and loaded with Fura2 under calcium clamp conditions.

In these experiments, [Ca2+]i was increased by addition of 100 μl of 10 μm ionomycin in EH to 900 μl of EH buffer over the cells, which resulted in Ca2+ release from internal stores. The [Ca2+]i was subsequently decreased by chelation of [Ca2+]i by the EH buffer in the bath. This second treatment resulted in a faster, higher amplitude [Ca2+]i increase, but the results obtained were not different from the experiments where exogenous CaCl2 was added to store-depleted cells.Fig. 9cPLA2W464F exhibits Ca2+-independent membrane residence. 10 μm ionomycin was added to MDCK cells co-expressing ECFP-cPLA2W464F (A) and EYFP-cPLA2C2 (B) in EH buffer at 7.5 s. C, ECFP-cPLA2W464F fluorescence change in the area of the Golgi (ECFP-cPLA2W464FGolgi and EYFP-cPLA2C2Golgi, inset, black line) was graphed with respect to time.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Calcium Imaging—MDCK cells grown on glass-bottomed dishes were washed with HHBSS containing 1 mm probenecid and incubated with 5 μm Fura2-AM (Calbiochem) in HHBSS, 1 mm probenecid, and 0.1% Me2SO for 45 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with HHBSS containing 1 mm probenecid and imaged after a 30-min incubation for de-esterification of the Fura2-AM. Single-cell imaging was performed on the Olympus system described above, but using a 40×, 1.35 numeric aperture oil immersion objective and a Fura2/EGFP dichroic mirror and emission filter (Chroma). Fura2/EGFP image sets were illuminated at 340, 380, and 465 nm at the time intervals specified. The [Ca2+]i increase is expressed as the ratio of the background-corrected Fura2 fluorescence at 340 and 380 nm (26Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).Structural Models—The cPLA2 models used the Protein Data Bank identifier 1CJY (7Dessen A. Tang J. Schmidt H.

Structures were visualized with the SwissPDB Viewer 3.7 program by GlaxoSmithKline.RESULTSExpression and Localization of cPLA2in MDCK Cells—To determine the intracellular membrane to which cPLA2 translocates in response to increases in [Ca2+]i in live cells, EYFP-cPLA2C2 was co-expressed with ECFP-GT, which localizes to medial and trans-Golgi cisternae (27Sciaky N. Presley J. Smith C. Zaal K.J. Cole N. Moreira J.E. Terasaki M. Siggia E. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1137-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), and imaged in time-lapse in response to [Ca2+]i mobilization. In response to 5 μm ATP, EYFP-cPLA2C2 moved from the cytosol to juxtanuclear membranes (Fig. 1A), and co-localized with ECFP-GT (Fig. 1, B and C). This shows that cPLA2 associates prominently with the Golgi in living cells and extends previous immunofluorescence findings in fixed and permeabilized MDCK cells (8Evans J.H. Spencer D.M. Zweifach A. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30150-30160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar).cPLA2and the cPLA2C2 Domain Have Equivalent Ca2+ Sensitivities for Membrane Association—In previous experiments, we correlated [Ca2+]i with the extent of EGFP-tagged cPLA2 (EGFP-cPLA2) or EGFP-tagged cPLA2 C2 domain (EGFP-cPLA2C2) association with Golgi and ER membranes and found the [Ca2+]i threshold for association with Golgi to be ∼120 and ∼250 nm for ER and nuclear membrane (8Evans J.H. Spencer D.M. Zweifach A. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30150-30160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of the C2 and full-length cPLA2 constructs also appeared similar. However, we were unable to directly compare membrane association of both constructs simultaneously at any given [Ca2+]i or directly compare targeting in the same cell. Here, we directly compared membrane association of EYFP-cPLA2C2 and ECFP-cPLA2 co-expressed in cells under calcium clamp conditions, where [Ca2+]e was increased in discrete steps and the chimeras imaged. At [Ca2+]i less than 50 nm (resting level), fluorescence from both constructs was distributed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, D and H). EYFP-cPLA2C2 is also evident in the nucleoplasm, whereas ECFP-cPLA2 is excluded because of differences in protein size, as we have previously shown (8Evans J.H. Spencer D.M. Zweifach A. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30150-30160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar).At each step increase in [Ca2+]e, roughly equivalent fractions of EYFP-cPLA2C2 and ECFP-cPLA2 associated with Golgi (Fig. 1, panels E and F and panels I and J). Because cPLA2 associates with ER and nuclear membranes at [Ca2+]i greater than ∼250 nm, the [Ca2+]i in images in panels E and F and panels I and J were judged to be below 250 nm. In Fig. 1 (G and K), [Ca2+]i is above 250 nm, as evidenced by fluorescence from both constructs on the nuclear envelope (white arrowhead) as well as Golgi (black arrowhead). Although the ER is not resolved in panels G and K as it is in panel A, we have shown previously that isolated C2 and full-length cPLA2 translocate to the nuclear membrane and ER at the same [Ca2+]i (8Evans J.H. Spencer D.M. Zweifach A. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30150-30160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). EYFP-cPLA2C2 and ECFP-cPLA2 localized to the same intracellular membranes as shown in the merged image (Fig. 1L). These observations using dual imaging of cells co-expressing full-length cPLA2 and the isolated C2 domain directly confirm that the C2 domain provides targeting specificity and that the isolated C2 domain and full-length cPLA2 have equivalent Ca2+ sensitivities.cPLA2C2 as a [Ca2+]i Sensor—Because of the essential role of [Ca2+]i in mediating cPLA2 association, we investigated using cPLA2C2 as a [Ca2+]i sensor to monitor [Ca2+]i changes. C2 domains have been used successfully as biosensors sensitive to [Ca2+]i change (28Teruel M.N. Meyer T. Science. 2002; 295: 1910-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Based on our earlier work, translocation to Golgi, but not ER, occurred at [Ca2+]i of 125-250 nm (8Evans J.H. Spencer D.M. Zweifach A. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30150-30160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). By titrating the [Ca2+]e in the extracellular buffer against the extent of EYFP-cPLA2C2 translocation (Fig. 1), we determined the [Ca2+]e that reproducibly elicited association of cPLA2C2 with Golgi, but not ER (i.e. produced [Ca2+]i of 125-250 nm). Cells expressing EGFP-cPLA2C2 and loaded with Fura2 were placed in calcium clamp conditions, and ex"

So, the increase in Ito across canine cardiac ventricular wall (from endo- to epicardium) reflects a parallel gradient in KChIP2 expression (3Rosati B. Pan Z. Lypen S. Wang H.S. Cohen I. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. J. Physiol. (Lond). 2001; 533: 119-125Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar), and transgenic mice devoid of KChIP2 have no measurable Ito, a prolonged action potential, and susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmia (4Kuo H.C.

Cell. 2001; 107: 801-813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Functional and structural studies of α-subunits demonstrate that K+ channel conduction pores are formed by assembly of 4 pore loops about a central axis (19Jiang Y.X. Lee A. Chen J.Y. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1623) Google Scholar). Conversely, K+ channel accessory subunits vary in their nature (soluble, peripheral, or membrane-spanning) and number per complex (20Abbott G.W. Goldstein S.A.N. Quarterly Reviews Biophysics. 1998; 31: 357-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To explore the structural basis for KChIP function, the stoichiometry of Kv4.2·KChIP2 channels was determined using a stepwise strategy: significant amounts of intact, functional Kv4.2· KChIP2 complexes were produced and isolated; functional and structural integrity of the purified material was confirmed by a toxin binding assay; and, thereafter, subunit valence was established by gradient centrifugation and direct amino acid analysis. Molecular Biology—Human Kv4.2 and KChIP2 were expressed in pRAT, a dual purpose vector with a cytomegalovirus promoter for mammalian expression and a T7 promoter for cRNA synthesis. Charybdotoxin (CTX)-sensitive Kv4.2 (Kv4.2*) was produced by plaque-forming unit-based mutation (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA); the pore segment containing mutations was isolated with NruI and BamHI and replaced into a wild-type human Kv4.2 backbone. The 1D4 epitope was introduced by creating an Mlu1 site in place of the termination codon and inserting a nucleotide compatible to Mlu1 and BglII encoding a linker and the epitope (RVPDGDPDETSQVAPAX). cRNA was synthesized after linearization with NotI using an mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). cRNAs were quantified by spectroscopy and gel electrophoresis. The gene variants used in this study were human Kv4.2 (accession number AH009258), KChIP2 (accession number AF199598), and Kv1.3 (accession number NM_002232). Electrophysiology and Data Analysis—Oocytes from Xenopus laevis frogs were defolliculated by collagenase and injected with 0.2 ng of Kv4.2 or Kv4.2* and 0.4 ng of KChIP2 cRNA. For CTX block studies less cRNA was injected for mixed complexes so macroscopic current was like that for α-subunits alone. Currents were studied at 12–24 h. Whole-cell currents were measured by two electrode voltage clamp (Geneclamp 500, Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistance of 0.1–1.2 mΩ. Data were sampled at 1 kHz. Data recording was performed using Clampex v8.0 and assessed with Clampfit v8.0, Excel, and Origin 6.0. All experiments were performed at room temperature. Standard bath solution was ND-96: 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.5) and supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for CTX studies. CTX binding kinetics were examined with voltage pulses to 40 mV for 500 ms from a resting membrane voltage of -80 mV repeated every 20 s. Current-voltage curves were evoked by depolarizing from a holding potential of -100 mV to test potentials of -80 to 70 mV with 10 mV steps lasting 500 ms every 5 s. Steady state inactivation was examined from a holding potential of -100 mV with test pulses from -120 to 10 mV held for 2.5 s with a second pulse at 40 mV to measure currents that were not inactivated. Recovery from inactivation was measured by driving channels to an inactivated state at 40 mV, hyperpolarizing to -100 mV, and then applying a second pulse to 40 mV for various intervals (increments of 5 and 50 ms). Inactivation was fit to a double exponential equation. Recovery from inactivation was fit to a single exponential. Activation V0.5 and Vs were calculated by fitting the conductance-voltage relationship to a Boltzmann function. Similarly, inactivation V0.5 and Vs were calculated by fitting the normalized current-voltage relationship to a Boltzmann function. Expression and Purification with COS7 Cells—Kv4.2* was co-expressed with KChIP2 in COS7 cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 2.5 and 5 μg cDNA/plate, respectively. 10–25 100 mm plates were harvested 2 days after transfection and solubilized for 1 h at 4 °C in lysis buffer containing 2.5% CHAPS, 100 mm NaCl, 40 mm KCl, 1.0 mg/ml Escherichia coli lipid, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm leupeptin/pepstatin, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, and 10% glycerol with Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Soluble material (SM) was collected after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The extract was incubated with anti-1D4-coated beads for 2 h at 4 °C with agitation often between New Haven, CT, and Waltham, MA (Honda Civic 1999). The column was washed with 50 ml of wash buffer containing 0.7% CHAPS, 300 mm NaCl, 40 mm KCl, 0.01 mm leupeptin/pepstatin, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4 with Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Protein was then eluted (E) in wash buffer with 100 mm NaCl and 0.2 mg/ml 1D4 peptide (Yale University Keck Facility). 1D4 monoclonal antibody was purchased (NCCC, Minneapolis MN) and coupled to beads as before (21Sokolova O. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Grigorieff N. Structure. 2001; 9: 215-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). KChIP2 antibodies were a generous gift (J. Trimmer, University of California, Davis). Whole-cell CTX Binding—3H-CTX binding to cells was performed as described previously (22Sun T. Naini A.A. Miller C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9992-9999Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell samples were divided into control and test groups. Control assessed nonspecific binding of 3H-CTX (36 nm) that took place in the presence of 1 μm non-radioactive CTX. Test groups measured total 3H-CTX binding and specific binding was determined by subtracting the nonspecific from the total binding. All steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were exposed to 3H-CTX in binding buffer (20 mm KCl, 10 mm NaPi, 100 mm sucrose, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 30 min, collected by centrifugation for 1 min at 3,000 rpm, and the supernatant was removed. The cell pellet was washed in 100 μl binding buffer, centrifuged, and after removal of supernatant, suspended in 100 μl of buffer, transferred to a scintillation vial with 10 ml of scintillation fluid (SafeScint, American Bioanalytical, Natick, MA) for liquid scintillation counting. CTX Binding to Purified Complexes—A 50 μl elution of purified material was exposed to 36 nm3H-CTX with or without 1 μm unlabelled CTX. As above, the two samples were used to assess nonspecific and total binding of 3H-CTX. Binding was performed at 4 °C for 30 min, 8 h, 16 h, or 24 h, after which unbound toxin was removed with an Amicon Centricon 100 (Millipore, Billerica, MA) by centrifugation for 10 s at 9,000 rpm and a wash with 20 μl wash buffer with only 100 mm NaCl by centrifugation. The filter was then placed in a liquid scintillation vial and studied in a scintillation counter as above. The dosetitration assay was performed in a similar manner with 25 μl aliquots of purified channel complex. 0, 0.45, 1.33, 4, 12, or 36 nm3H-CTX was applied to a control and test sample for 30 min at 4 °C and processed as above. Glycerol Gradient Analysis—Kv4.2*·KChIP2 protein complex (0.5 ml, ∼2 μg, E2–4) was layered on a 12 ml 10–40% (w/v) linear glycerol gradient containing 0.7% CHAPS, 100 mm NaCl, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, and Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). A parallel gradient was layered with 20 μg of each of the following molecular mass markers (Amersham Biosciences); chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and ferritin (440 kDa). Gradients were centrifuged for 15 h at 35,000 rpm and 4 °C using an SW41 rotor (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). 1-ml fractions were collected by upward displacement. Proteins were precipitated with 5 volumes acetone at -20 °C for analysis. Amino Acid Analysis—After SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, bands corresponding to Kv4.2* and KChIP2 and a blank portion of the gel were excised with a sterile scalpel. Samples were hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl and 0.2% phenol for 16 h at 115 °C with 2 nmol norleucine/100 μl HCl as an internal standard. After hydrolysis, amino acids were quantified on a Beckman 7300 Amino Acid Analyzer via ion-exchange and post-column ninhydrin detection (Yale University Keck Facility). After quantification, some amino acids are not analyzed due to intrinsic limitations of the method: these include His, which co-elutes with Tris in the SDS-PAGE buffer, Gly, which is in SDS-PAGE buffer, and Arg, which is variably obscured by ammonia in gel samples. Amino acids residues determined for the blank gel sample were subtracted from subunit samples to correct for background signal. 9–12 amino acids for each subunit were observed to be within 10% of predicted value in each trial and were studied: Asn, Asp, Thr, Gln, Glu, Pro, Ala, Val, Ile, Leu, Phe, and Lys. First, a variant of human Kv4.2 α-subunits (Kv4.2*) was produced that maintained the functional attributes of wild-type but had two modifications, a pore binding site for the peptide toxin CTX and an 8 residue C-terminal epitope tag (1D4, ETSQVADA). The rationale for these embellishments was as follows. A single CTX molecule binds in the ion conduction pore of toxin-sensitive K+ channels to occlude the permeation pathway only when 4 permissive α-subunits are assembled in correct fashion; as a result, small changes in pore (or toxin) structure are registered with great sensitivity as altered blockade (23MacKinnon R. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 91: 335-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 24MacKinnon R. Nature. 1991; 350: 232-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 25Goldstein S.A.

Thus, CTX and related toxins were used to locate the external aspect of the conduction pore (26MacKinnon R. Miller C.

Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1623) Google Scholar). The 1D4 epitope allows purification of membrane proteins under mild conditions via monoclonal antibody binding and peptide elution (21Sokolova O. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Grigorieff N.

The CTX-sensitive variant of Kv4.2 was produced by introduction of 3 mutations in the pore loop (Fig. 1a) chosen in an iterative fashion based on residues found to be important for high-affinity toxin binding in other K+ channels (29Goldstein S.A.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 961-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although wild-type Kv4.2 channels are insensitive to application of CTX, those with Kv4.2* α-subunits show half-maximal block (Ki) at 0.35 ± 0.04 nm (Fig. 1, b and c). Similarly, wild-type Kv4.2·KChIP2 channels are insensitive to toxin whereas those with Kv4.2* α-subunits showed Ki = 0.76 ± 0.03 nm (Fig. 1, b and c). As CTX is external and KChIP2 subunits are intracellular, the increase in Ki observed on KChIP2 incorporation was unexpected. Relaxation to equilibrium blockade upon acute toxin application revealed KChIP2 to have little effect on the toxin on-rate (Kon = 18.1 ± 1.4 μm-1 s-1versus Kon = 24.5 ± 2.3 μm-1 s-1 with KChIP2, n = 8–10) but to destabilize bound toxin, increasing its off-rate ∼3-fold (Koff = 8.0 ± 0.6 × 10-3 s-1versus Koff = 22.9 ± 2.6 × 10-3 s-1). This indicates small KChIP2-induced changes in the external pore of the closed channel (the predominant state in this protocol). Despite modifications to confer CTX sensitivity and append the epitope tag, channels with Kv4.2* behaved almost like those with wild-type subunits (Table I and Fig. 2). Kv4.2* channels are like wild-type in their voltage-dependence for half-maximal activation and half-maximal steady state inactivation. Although small differences in inactivation kinetics were observed for slow (τslow) and fast (τfast) time constants, these were without associated changes in their relative ratio, or rates of recovery from inactivation. Moreover, the archetypal effects of KChIP2 were unaltered by the α-subunit mutations. Thus, KChIP2 produced similar increases in current density and rates of recovery from inactivation with both wild type Kv4.2 and Kv4.2*, and similar decreases in rates of inactivation (due to increased contribution of the slow component) with expected small shifts in the voltage required to achieve half-maximal activation and half-maximal steady state inactivation.Table IChannel gating parameters for Kv4.2 and Kv4.2* channels with and without KChIP2 Parameters for Kv4.2 and Kv4.2* expressed alone or with KChIP2 from measurements by two electrode voltage clamp using oocytes as described under “Materials and Methods.” V0.5 and Vs were calculated by fitting the conductance-voltage and normalized current-voltage relationships, respectively, to a Boltzmann function.

Naini A.A. Miller C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9992-9999Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and used first to monitor and optimize surface expression of channels on COS7 cells (see “Materials and Methods”). As expected based on measurement of channel currents, KChIP2 increased the absolute number of channels on the cells ∼2.6-fold, from 1.6 ± 0.2 pmol/plate (n = 4) to 4.0 ± 0.2 pmol/plate (n = 11). Purification of Kv4.2*·KChIP2 complexes was achieved via the 1D4 epitope on Kv4.2* with anti-1D4 antibodies covalently bound to beads (Fig. 3). Thus, COS7 cells induced to transiently express Kv4.2* and KChIP2 at high levels were solubilized with the detergent CHAPS (2.5%), and complexes isolated by binding, washing with buffer, and elution with 1D4 peptide (see “Materials and Methods”). This led to co-purification of Kv4.2* and KChIP2 (Fig. 3, a–c). Western blot analysis revealed excess KChIP2 in soluble material (SM) and unbound flow though (FT) whereas Kv4.2*·KChIP2 channels were enriched in fractions collected by peptide elution (E) (Fig. 3a). Staining with Coomassie Blue confirmed the E2 fraction to be rich in the two channel subunits (Fig. 3b). Purified material was subjected to centrifugation through a glycerol gradient and studied by Western blot analysis after SDS-PAGE to estimate the size of Kv4.2*·KChIP2 channels. The complex had a molecular mass between 232–440 kDa in trials with four separate preparations (Fig. 3c). Because Kv4.2* subunits carry no carbohydrate, each 642 residue protein has a predicted mass of ∼72 kDa and each tetramer a mass of ∼288 kDa (an underestimate due to detergent binding (21Sokolova O. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Grigorieff N. Structure. 2001; 9: 215-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar)). Because KChIP2 has 252 residues and a predicted mass of ∼28 kDa this result argues that complexes contain between 1 and 6 KChIP2 subunits (∼316–456 kDa). The predicted mass for an octameric complex with 4 Kv4.2* subunits and 4 KChIP2 subunits is 400 kDa. To verify the stability and integrity of purified Kv4.2*· KChIP2 channels over time, binding of 3H-CTX to isolated complexes was assessed. After 24 h at 4 °C, ∼90% of the binding activity was retained (Fig. 4a). Indeed, despite residence in detergent rather than a lipid membrane, purified complexes bound 3H-CTX with high affinity. Binding studies with four separate preparations Kv4.2*·KChIP2 were well fit to a single-site binding (Langmuir) isotherm with a Kd ∼4.8 nm (Fig. 4b). Because CTX binding occurs with high affinity only when pores are properly assembled, the results provide direct evidence that the isolated complexes are a good approximation of the channels in plasma membranes and indicate their homogeneity because a single high affinity toxin site is apparent. To accurately assess the subunit composition of purified Kv4.2*·KChIP2 complexes, the two subunits were separated by SDS-PAGE, identified by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye, and the bands excised from the gel for amino acid analysis by hydrolysis, ion-exchange chromatography, and ninhydrin detection (Table II). Because the amino acid sequences of Kv4.2* and KChIP2 were known, the expected and observed amino acid content of the bands could be compared and the moles of each subunit determined independently from 9–12 residues in each of 3 independent trials. The molar ratio of Kv4.2*:KChIP2 in purified complexes was 1:1 (Table II); similar results are noted in a companion report for channels with a KChIP2 variant and others with a Kv4.2* mutant. 2Kim, L. A., Furst, J., Gutierrez, D., Butler, M. H., Xu, S., Goldstein, S. A. N., and Grigorieff, N. (2004) Neuron, in press. Purified channels are shown to have 4 α-subunits because CTX binds with high affinity (Fig. 4). A 1:1 molar ratio therefore indicates that Kv4.2*·KChIP2 complexes contain 4 KChIP2 subunits.Table IIMoles of Kv4.2* and KChIP2 subunits in channel complexes Amino acids determined from Kv4.2* and KChIP2 bands excised from SDS-PAGE gels; 9–12 amino acids for each subunit in each study were within 10% of the predicted number and used individually to assess pmol of recovered subunit.

Here we demonstrate that regulatory KChIP2 subunits assemble with pore-forming Kv4.2 subunits in 4:4 complexes when over-expressed in tissue culture cells to produce voltage-gated K+ channels like those in native cells (such as cardiac Ito (3Rosati B.

A 4:4 subunit arrangement appears to be the natural and stable valence for Kv4.2*·KChIP2 channels first because it was found with four separate large-scale preparations and second because KChIPs could not be separated from α-subunits without complete dissociation of the complexes to monomer form (not shown). KChIP2 increases trafficking to the surface, channel half-life, and detergent solubility of mixed complexes formed with Kv4.2 (6Shibata R. Misonou H. Campomanes C.R. Anderson A.E. Schrader L.A.

This suggests why we could purify significant amounts of Kv4.2*·KChIP2 channels but did not succeed when Kv4.2* α-subunits were expressed alone (not shown). We expect KChIPs and related neuronal calcium sensing proteins (such as frequenin (16Nakamura T.Y. Pountney D.J. Ozaita A. Nandi S. Ueda S. Rudy B. Coetzee W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A 4:4 subunit stoichiometry is also seen with the soluble intracellular regulator Kvβ2 in assemblies with the N-terminal segments of Kv1 α-subunits (33Gulbis J.M. Zhou M. Mann S. MacKinnon R. Science. 2000; 289: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Similarly, KCNMB1-encoded β-subunits (two span transmembrane proteins) and voltage- and calcium-gated BK α-subunits assemble with 4:4 valence (34Knaus H.G. Folander K. Garcia C.M. Garcia M.L.

In contrast, just 2 KCNE1-encoded MinK β-subunits (peptides with a single transmembrane span) assemble with 4 KCNQ1 α-subunits to form cardiac IKs channels (39Wang K.W. Goldstein S.A.N.

KChIP2 incorporation was found to create an ∼36 × 115 × 115 Å, intracellular fenestrated rotunda: 4 peripheral columns that extend down from the membrane-embedded portion of the channel to enclose the central Kv4.2 “hanging gondola” (a platform held beneath the transmembrane conduction pore by 4 internal columns) (21Sokolova O.

To reach the pore from the cytosol, ions pass through one of four external fenestrae to enter the rotundal vestibule and then cross one of four internal windows in the gondola. The location of KChIP2 subunits in the structure is lateral to the gondola platform and does not overlap with the sub-platform locale for the Kvβ2 subunits apparent in crystal structures (33Gulbis J.M.

Gusella J.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 315: 1267-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). HD is caused by an expansion of the CAG trinucleotide repeat within exon 1 of the HD gene, which encodes a cytoplasmic protein named huntingtin (2The Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research GroupCell. 1993; 72: 971-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7117) Google Scholar). The number of CAG repeats is polymorphic, ranging from 6 to 35 on normal chromosomes and 36 or more on HD chromosomes. The CAG trinucleotide repeat is translated into polyglutamine (polyQ). Expression of the mutant huntingtin carrying an expanded polyQ tract induces the formation of the nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates in the brain, as well as in peripheral tissues of HD patients (3DiFiglia M.

However, the question as to whether the role of the aggregates is protective or pathogenic remains to be solved. Several lines of evidences from in vitro experiments as well as HD model mice suggest that a gain of toxic property acquiring in the mutant huntingtin is a major cause for HD pathogenesis. Recently, it has been shown that the expanded polyQ binds to a group of transcription factors, such as Sp1, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP), p300/CBP-associated factors (P/CAF), and TAFII130 (6Dunah A.W.

This could lead to transcriptional dysregulation in a number of genes under controlling by these transcription factors, and ultimately to dysfunction of the cells. Thus, one of the possible toxic entities could be the ability of polyQ for binding to several transcription factors. To alleviate the pathology seen in HD, removing or reducing such toxic entities is one of the challenges in the development of disease therapies for HD as well as other polyQ diseases such as spinocerebellar ataxias and dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the dysregulation of cellular systems, including the downstream signaling pathways mediated by the mutant huntingtin, remain elusive. Several studies using animal models for HD have given important insights into the pathogenesis and cure for HD. Using YAC transgenic mice as a HD model, Leavitt et al. (14Leavitt B.R. Guttman J.A. Hodgson J.G. Kimel G.H. Singaraja R. Vogl A.W. Hayden M.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 313-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) have reported that normal huntingtin competes against mutated huntingtin to reduce the toxicity, suggesting that an increment of normal huntingtin could delay disease progression. On the other hand, the study of the conditional mouse model of HD using the tetracycline-responsive gene system demonstrated that a blockade of expression of mutated gene in symptomatic mice led to a disappearance of aggregates and an amelioration of the behavioral phenotypes, indicating that a continuous expression of the mutated huntingtin was required to maintain aggregate formation, as well as some symptoms, and that HD may be reversible (15Yamamoto A. Lucas J.J. Hen R. Cell. 2000; 101: 57-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Taken together, the levels of normal and mutated huntingtin may influence severity and progression of the disease. It is feasible to intervene in the progression or even to cure the disease by means of the manipulation of the mutated and/or normal huntingtin gene expression. As a first step toward this, comprehension of the molecular basis of the HD transcriptional regulation should be a primary objective. To delineate the transcriptional regulation for the HD gene, we must perceive: 1) the structure of the promoter region including unique cis-regulatory elements, 2) trans-acting factors that bind to these cis-regulatory elements, and 3) how these factors contribute to induce or suppress its expression in the cells. Thus far, several studies on the structure and/or sequences for the promoter region of the HD gene have been published. The HD promoter region consists of a GC-rich DNA sequence containing several potential binding sites for Sp1, AP2, and AP4, whereas it lacks both typical TATA and CAAT boxes (16Holzmann C. Schmidt T. Thiel G. Epplen J.T. Riess O. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 92: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 17Lin B. Nasir J. Kalchman M.A. McDonald H. Zeisler J. Goldberg Y.P. Hayden M.R. Genomics. 1995; 25: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). There are two copies of the 20-bp direct repeat and two copies of the 17-bp direct repeat in the 5′ region of the HD gene (17Lin B. Nasir J. Kalchman M.A. McDonald H. Zeisler J. Goldberg Y.P. Hayden M.R. Genomics. 1995; 25: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These unique repeat sequences have postulated to be cis-regulatory elements, which contribute to the regulation of transcription of the HD gene. In particular, the 20-bp direct repeat sequences are shown to be required for the enhanced transcription (18Coles R. Caswell R. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol.

However, no trans-acting factors that bind to these candidate cis-regulatory elements on the HD promoter have been identified yet, let alone understanding the molecular mechanisms by which the transcription of the HD gene is regulated. To aid in the delineation of the transcriptional regulation of the HD gene, we sought to explore trans-acting factors that bound to the promoter region of the HD gene. We report in this study the identification of two members of a novel nuclear shuttle protein family, HD gene regulatory region-binding protein (HDBP) 1 and HDBP2, which are found to be an exact match of GLUT4 enhancer factor DNA binding domain (GEFdb) (19Oshel K.M.

Virology. 2002; 293: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), respectively. Both factors specifically bind to the triplicated 7-bp consensus sequence (GCCGGCG) at intervals of 13 bp in the HD promoter region. The HD promoter function, especially in a neuronal cell line (IMR32), relies on the 7-bp consensus sequence. These novel DNA-binding proteins in conjunction with the novel cis-regulatory element, GCCGGCG, can trigger off HD gene transcription in a neuronal cell line. These elements provide new clues to the understanding of the transcriptional regulation of the HD gene in neuron. Reagent—Nuclear export signal (NES) inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB) (21Nishi K.

Yeast One-hybrid Screening—The Matchmaker one-hybrid system (Clontech) was used to isolate cDNA clones encoding DNA-binding factor for the promoter region of the HD gene. A plasmid DNA containing 2.0 kilobase pairs of 5′-flanking region of the HD gene with (CAG)18 (23Arai N.R. Akiyama R. Niimi N.H. Nakatsubo H. Inoue T. Genes Genet. Syst. 1999; 74: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) was used as a template for the PCR amplification. To generate target reporter construct for library screening, the DNA fragment containing the 5′-flanking region and a portion of exon 1 of the HD gene, corresponding with the nucleotide sequences from -365 to +158, was amplified by PCR using the primer pair 5′-GTTGAGCCCCGCGCCTTCG-3′ and 5′-GGCTGAGGAAGCTGAGGAG-3′. The amplified fragment was inserted into the SmaI sites of pHISi-1 and pHISi reporter vectors, resulting in target-reporter constructs, pHISi-1-R1-2-3-4 and pHISi-R1-2-3-4, respectively. Yeast transformants containing either pHISi-1-R1-2-3-4 or pHISi-R1-2-3-4 reporter construct were established by transforming a yeast YM4271 strain with XhoI-linearized pHISi-1-R1-2-3-4 or pHISi-R1-2-3-4, followed by the selection on the SD/-His medium. Then, human testis Matchmaker cDNA (GAL4 activation domain) library (pACT2 library) was introduced into these reporter strains. Transformants growing on SD/-His/-Leu medium containing 45 mm 3-aminotriazole (3-AT) were isolated as positive clones (pACT2 clones), encoding the DNA-binding protein. Isolation of cDNA from yeast transformants was performed according to the protocol from the manufacturer (Clontech). To confirm DNA binding activity and its specificity among the positive clones, additional reporter strains carrying smaller DNA fragments, R1 (-365 to -214), R2 (-231 to -113), R3 (-131 to +51), and R4 (+29 to +158), were generated by PCR amplification using the primer pairs 5′-AAAGAATTCGTTGAGCCCCGCGCCTTCG-3′/5′-AAATGCGCAACGCCGGCCAGCATGATT-3′, 5′-AAAGAATTCAATCATGCTGGCCGGCGT-3′/5′-AAATGCGCAAGCGGCCGTCCATCTTGGA-3′, 5′-AAAGAATTCTCCAAGATGGACGGCCGCT-3′/5′-AAATGCGCAGAAGGACTTGAGGGACTCGAAGG-3′, and 5′-AAAGAATTCCCTTCGAGTCCCTCAAGTCCTTC-3′/5′-AAATGCGCAGGCTGAGGAAGCTGAGGAG-3′, respectively. Each amplified fragment was digested with EcoRI and MluI and inserted into both pHISi-1 and pHISi reporter vectors, resulting in eight target-reporter constructs, pHISi-1-R1, pHISi-R1, pHISi-1-R2, pHISi-R2, pHISi-1-R3, pHISi-R3, pHISi-1-R4, and pHISi-R4. Reporter strains were established by transforming a yeast YM4271 strain with XhoI-linearized constructs, followed by the selection on the SD/-His medium plate. After re-transformation of each reporter strain with the positive cDNA (pACT2 clone) clone, the DNA-protein interaction was assayed by the growth of transformants on the SD/-His/-Leu medium plate containing 45 mm 3-AT. Isolation of the Entire Coding Sequence of Transcripts—To isolate full-length cDNA for HDBP1, 1.5 × 105 plaque-forming units of the human testis cDNA library (insert size: larger than 0.5 kb) was screened by the standard procedure (Stratagene). In brief, phage plaques were plated, lifted and fixed onto nylon filters, and hybridized with the 32P-labeled 1.3-kb HDBP1 cDNA fragment for 18 h in hybridization solution (2× PIPES buffer, 50% deionized formamide, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml herring testis) at 42 °C. The filters were washed twice for 5 min in 2× SSC at room temperature and for 30 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. Autoradiography was performed for 1-2 days using x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co., BioMax) at -80 °C. The resulting positive phage clone was converted into plasmid DNA (pBluescript II; pBs) by in vivo excision (Stratagene), resulting in pBs-HDBP1. To obtain the most 5′ sequence of the HDBP2 transcript, rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed using SMART™ RACE cDNA amplification (Clontech). First strand cDNA was synthesized from the human testis mRNA using 5′-RACE cDNA synthesis primer. Twenty-five cycles of 5′-RACE and nested PCR reactions (94 °C for 30 s; 68 °C for 3 min) were carried out using 5′-ACCCCCGTACCACACATAAACCTTC-3′ and an universal primer mix (Clontech), and 5′-GGTGCTGGGAGCCTTAAGGACT-3′ and a nested universal primer (Clontech), respectively. The 350-bp PCR product was cloned using TA cloning system (Invitrogen). The fragment containing the entire open reading frame (ORF) of HDBP2 was generated from pACT2 clone 8 by PCR using primers c8ATG (5′-AAAGAATTCATGGCGAGTGTCCTGTCCCGACGCCTTGGAAAGCGGTCCCTCCTGGGAGCCCGGGTGTTGGGACCCAGTGCCT-3′) (initiation ATG is underscored) and c8stop (5′-AAAGTCGACTCAGTCCAGAAAGCGCTG-3′). The PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI and SalI and inserted into the EcoRI-SalI site of pBs vector, resulting in pBs-HDBP2. cDNA Sequencing and Sequence Analysis—DNA sequence of the cDNA clones was determined using a DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit and ABI377 DNA sequencer (ABI). The cDNA and predicted amino acid sequences were compared with non-redundant nucleotide and protein sequence data base using BLASTN and BLASTP (blast.genome.ad.jp/) (35Altschul S.F. Mockten T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60216) Google Scholar), respectively. The multiple protein sequence alignment was performed using GENETYX-MAC. Northern Blot Analysis—The filters of Gene Hunter I, II, III, and IV (non-normalized) (Toyobo) were used for Northern blot analysis. The 1.3-kb HDBP1 cDNA, the 1.7-kb HDBP2 cDNA, and the full-length β-actin cDNA were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by a random priming method. Hybridization with each labeled probe was carried out in a solution (0.5 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA) for 18 h at 65 °C. Filters were washed once for 5 min in 2× SSC at room temperature and for 30 min in 2× SSC, 1% SDS at 65 °C. Autoradiography was performed for 1-2 days using x-ray film (Kodak BioMax) at -80 °C. Generation of the Plasmid Constructs—Expression constructs for HDBP1 and HDBP2 as glutathione S-transferase (GST)-, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-, and MycHis-tagged fusion proteins were generated as follows. Template plasmid DNA (10 ng) was subjected to 25 cycles of PCR amplification (30 s at 94 °C and 3 min at 68 °C) using KOD polymerase (Toyobo) and primers (Table I). Each fragment was digested with EcoRI and XhoI (GST-fused HDBPs and MycHis-tagged fused HDBPs) or EcoRI and SalI (GFP-fused HDBPs) and inserted into the EcoRI-XhoI site of pGEX-5X-1 or -5X-2 (Amersham Biosciences) and pcDNA3.1-MycHisC (Clontech), or the EcoRI-SalI site of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech).Table IThe list of HDBP1- and HDBP2-specific primers, vectors, and template DNAs used for PCR amplification Open table in a new tab A firefly luciferase reporter plasmid was constructed as follows. The fragments (-231 to -146) with wild-type and mutated 7 bp in R2 region were generated by PCR using the template DNA, pHISi-R2, and the primer pairs 5′-AAAACGCGTAATCATGCTGGCCGGCGT-3′/5′-AAACTCGAGCCCCACGGCGCCTTGCGTCCCAGA-3′ and 5′-AAAACGCGTAATCATGCTGGCAAGCGTGGCCCCGCCTCCGCAAGCGCGGCCCCGCCTCCGCAAGCGCAGCGTCT-3′/5′-AAACTCGAGCCCCACGGCGCCTTGCGTCCCAGA-3′ (mutations are underscored), respectively. Each amplified fragment (wt-7bp and m3-7bp) was digested with MluI and XhoI and inserted into pGV-E2 reporter vector (Toyo Inc.), resulting in two reporter constructs, pGV-E2-wt-7bp/Luc and pGV-E2-m3-7bp/Luc. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—A series of the GST-fused HDBP1 and HDBP2 was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)-pLysS in the presence of 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 100 μm zinc chloride, and purified using GSTrap (Amersham Biosciences) according to the protocol from the manufacturer. Probe DNAs were prepared by digesting the pHISi-1 plasmid containing R1, R2, R3, or R4 fragments with the EcoRI-MluI site and the pGV-E2 plasmid containing wt-7bp or m3-7bp fragment with the MluI-XhoI site and then labeled with [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dCTP using DNA polymerase Klenow fragment (Takara Bio Inc.), respectively. Binding reaction was performed in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 2 μg poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences)). GST fusion proteins were incubated in binding buffer for 5 min at room temperature with or without competitor DNAs. The 32P-labeled probe (0.1 ng) was then added and incubated for another 20 min at room temperature. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 4% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA) at 120 V for 2 h. Gels were dried under vacuum and exposed to Kodak x-ray film. DNase I Footprinting—The 253-bp DNA fragment of the HD promoter region was amplified by PCR using primer pair 5′-AAAACGCGTGTTGAGCCCCGCGCCTTCG-3′ and 5′-AAAACTCGAGAGCGGCCGTCCATCTTGGA-3′, and cloned using a TA cloning system (Invitrogen), followed by digestion with MluI and XhoI. The MluI-XhoI fragment was isolated, end-labeled with 32P, and used for DNase I footprinting. Binding reaction was performed in a total volume of 20 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 2 μg poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences)). The 32P-end-labeled DNA fragment (1 ng) was mixed with GST-HDBPs-C (10, 50, 200, and 400 ng) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Two μl of 10× DNase I solution (15 μg/ml DNase I, 50 mm MgCl2) was added, incubated for additional 1 min at 25 °C, and followed by the addition of DNase I stop solution (1.6 m ammonium acetate, 95 mm EDTA, 0.8% SDS, 0.3 mg/ml calf thymus DNA). The DNA mixture was treated with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. Precipitated DNA was dissolved in loading dye (80% formamide, 10 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.025% bromphenol blue, 0.025% xylene cyanol). The samples were electrophoresed on an 8 m urea, 8% acrylamide gel. Sequence ladders (G+A and T+C) were generated by standard chemical sequencing techniques of Maxam and Gilbert. Measurement of Reporter Gene Activity by Luciferase Assay—HeLa and IMR32 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C, respectively. Cells were plated by 36 h before transfection at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well (HeLa) and 1 × 106 cells/well (IMR32) in 6-well culture plates. HeLa and IMR32 cells were transfected with 100 and 500 ng of pGV-E2-wt-7bp/Luc or -m3-7bp/Luc and 5 and 25 ng of pRL-TK (Nippon Gene) using FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science), respectively. After incubation for 24 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 1× lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase assays were carried out according to the protocol from the manufacturer using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and TR717 Microplate Luminometer (PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems). The firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the control sea pansy luciferase activity to control for variations in transfection efficiency (24Hoshino H. Kobayashi A. Yoshida M. Kudo N. Oyake T.

Subcellular Localization Analysis of GFP Fusion Proteins—HeLa cells were plated by 18 h before transfection at a density of 0.8 × 104 cells/well on an 8-well chamber slide (Becton Dickinson) and were transfected with 1 μg of the pHDBP-GFP expression plasmids using an Effectene™ transfection reagent (Qiagen). IMR32 cells were plated by 36 h before transfection at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well on 2-well chamber slide (Nunc) and were transfected with 1 μg of the pHDBPs-GFP expression plasmids using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). After 24 h, HeLa and IMR32 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and were examined for subcellular localization of GFP fusion proteins under a fluorescence microscopic observation (DMREB; Leica) and confocal microscopic observation (TCS_NT confocal microscope systems; Leica), respectively. To examine effects of leptomycin B, transfected cells were treated with 10 ng/ml leptomycin B for 1 h after 24 h of transfection. Mutagenesis of the HDRF1 and HDRF2 Clones—Two amino acid substitution mutations were introduced into pHDBP1-MycHis and pHDBP2-MycHis by GeneEditor™ in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega) using the following mutagenic oligonucleotides: hdrf1 (L257A/L260A), 5′-GATGTTGGTGTGGACACGCTGACCGACGGGGCGTCCAGCGCGACTCCAGTGTCCCCCACGGCCTCCATGCCG-3′; hdrf1 (F273A/L276A), 5′-GTGTCCCCCACGGCCTCCATGCCGCCTGCCGCCCCCCGCGCGGAGCTGCCAGAGCTGCTGGAGCCCCCAGCC-3′; hdrf2 (L109A/L113A), 5′-TGGATGGAGGGTCAGGTGACCGTCTGGCTGGCGGAGCAGAAGGCGCAGGTCTGCTGCAGGGTGGAGGAGGTGTGG-3′; hdrf2 (M169A/M172A), 5′-GAAGTCGGACGCAGTGGAAATGGATGAGATGGCGGCGGCCGCGGTGCTGACGTCCCTGTCCTGCAGCCCTGTTG-3′ (mutations are underscored). The resulting mutants, pHDBP1(L257A/L260A)-MycHis, pHDBP1(F273A/L276A)-MycHis, pHDBP2(L109A/L113A)-MycHis, and pHDBP2(M169A/M172A)-MycHis, were confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis. To generate GFP fusion expression constructs with mutations, the fragments were amplified from pHDBP1(L257A/L260A)-MycHis and pHDBP1(F273A/L276A)-MycHis using the primer pair hdrf1gF/hdrf1gR, and from pHDBP2(L109A/L113A)-MycHis and pHDBP2(M169A/M172A)-MycHis using the primer pair hdrf2F/hdrf2R. Each fragment was digested with EcoRI and SalI and inserted into the EcoRI-SalI site of pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech), resulting in pHDBP1(L257A/L260A)-GFP, pHDBP1(F273A/L276A)-GFP, pHDBP2(L109A/L113A)-GFP, and pHDBP2(M169A/M172A)-GFP. Identification of Proteins That Bind to the Promoter Region of the HD Gene—To explore the promoter-binding proteins of the HD gene, we performed a yeast one-hybrid screening with a human testis Matchmaker cDNA (GAL4 activation domain) library using a yeast reporter strain containing the bait R1-2-3-4 DNA fragment (Fig. 1A). Thirty-three positive clones (pACT2 clones) have been isolated so far. Five of these clones represented the same cDNA (pACT2 clone 2, ∼1.3-kb cDNA size, GenBank™ accession no. AB044786) (Fig. 1B), and the other two clones represented independent cDNAs, pACT2 clone 8 (∼1.7-kb cDNA size, GenBank™ accession no. AB044750) (Fig. 1B) and pACT2 clone 11, respectively. 2K. Tanaka, J. Shouguchi-Miyata, N. Miyamoto, and J.-E Ikeda, unpublished data. The rest of 26 clones are false positives, which neither carry in-frame coding sequences nor re-grow on the SD/-His/-Leu/+3-AT medium. On the other hand, the reporter strain containing the bait DNA in a reverse orientation (R4-3-2-1, Fig. 1A) gave no positive clone. To refine the binding regions of three representative clones (pACT2 clones 2, 8, and 11), we further carried out the yeast one-hybrid assay using four yeast reporter strains containing the bait DNA of R1 (-364 to -214), R2 (-231 to -114), R3 (-131 to +51), and R4 (+29 to +158) DNA fragment (Fig. 1A), respectively. Both pACT2 clone 2 and pACT2 clone 8 revealed strong binding to the R2 region in the promoter of the HD gene (Fig. 1B). In addition, they also showed weak binding activity to the R1 region, indicating that they bind to an overlap region (-231 to -214) between R1 and R2 or that there are several distinct binding sites within R1 and R2 regions. On the other hand, pACT2 clone 11 was shown to associate with the R3 region (data not shown). As both pACT2 clone 2 and pACT2 clone 8 revealed specific binding to the promoter region of the HD gene, we characterized these two clones in detail. Isolation of the Transcripts Encoding HDBP1 and HDBP2—Based upon the sequence analysis, the 1.3-kb cDNA of pACT2 clone 2 appears to be a part of transcript; therefore, we screened further a human testis cDNA library using the 1.3-kb cDNA as a probe to obtain a full-length transcript. Two independent cDNA clones, whose inserts are ∼1.5 and 1.8 kb long, respectively, were identified. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the 1.8-kb cDNA encompassed 1,776 nucleotides (nt) with a single ORF encoding a 46-kDa protein of 387 amino acids (GenBank™ accession no. AB052777). As 1.8 kb of the cDNA is equivalent to the size of the transcript represented by Northern blotting (see Fig. 2A), the 1.8-kb cDNA might contain the entire sequence of the transcript. We thus designated this gene product as HDBP1 (Huntington's disease gene regulatory region-bin"
https://openalex.org/W2084527370,"Abstract The Plasmodium falciparum cysteine protease falcipain-2 is a trophozoite hemoglobinase and potential antimalarial drug target. Unlike other studied papain family proteases, falcipain-2 does not require its prodomain for folding to active enzyme. Rather, folding is mediated by an amino-terminal extension of the mature protease. As in related enzymes, the prodomain is a potent inhibitor of falcipain-2. We now report further functional evaluation of the domains of falcipain-2 and related plasmodial proteases. The minimum requirement for folding of falcipain-2 and four related plasmodial cysteine proteases was inclusion of a 14–15-residue amino-terminal folding domain, beginning with a conserved Tyr. Chimeras of the falcipain-2 catalytic domain with extensions from six other plasmodial proteases folded normally and had kinetic parameters (kcat/Km 124,000–195,000 m-1 s-1) similar to those of recombinant falcipain-2 (kcat/Km 120,000 m-1 s-1), indicating that the folding domain is functionally conserved across the falcipain-2 subfamily. Correct folding also occurred when the catalytic domain was refolded with a separate prodomain-folding domain construct but not with an isolated folding domain peptide. Thus, the prodomain mediated interaction between the other two domains when they were not covalently bound. The prodomain-catalytic domain interaction was independent of the active site, because it was blocked by free inactive catalytic domain but not by the active site-binding peptide leupeptin. The folded catalytic domain retained activity after purification from the prodomain-folding domain construct (kcat/Km 168,000 m-1 s-1), indicating that the folding domain is not required for activity once folding has been achieved. Activity was lost after nonreducing gelatin SDS-PAGE but not native gelatin PAGE, indicating that correct disulfide bonds are insufficient to direct appropriate folding. Our results identify unique features of the falcipain-2 subfamily with independent mediation of activity, folding, and inhibition."

CarB displays sequence homology with members of the crotonase family including enoyl-CoA hydratase (crotonase) and methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase. The CarB reaction has been proposed to comprise condensation of acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) and glutamate semi-aldehyde to give (2S,5S)-carboxymethylproline ((2S,5S)-CMP).

Here we report the purification of recombinant CarB and that it exists predominantly in a trimeric form as do other members of the crotonase family. AcCoA was not found to be a substrate for CarB. Instead malonyl-CoA was found to be a substrate, efficiently producing (2S,5S)-CMP in the presence of glutamate semi-aldehyde. In the absence of glutamate semi-aldehyde, mass spectrometric analysis indicated that CarB catalyzed the decarboxylation of malonyl-CoA to AcCoA. The reactions of CarB, CarA, and CarC were coupled in vitro demonstrating the viability of malonyl-CoA as a carbapenem precursor. CarB was also shown to accept methylmalonyl CoA as a substrate to form 6-methyl-(2S,5S)CMP, which in turn is a substrate for CarA.

Although some carbapenems are natural products, the medicinally used antibiotics are produced by chemical synthesis, as it has not yet been possible to develop fermentation based procedures.

However CarB, which catalyzes the interesting first step in the pathway to (5R)-carbapenem, has no homologue in clavam biosynthesis, where the committed step is catalyzed by a thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent enzyme, carboxyethyl-arginine synthase (16Khaleeli N.

Both of these sub-families of enzymes belong to the crotonase superfamily, which encompasses a diverse range of enzymes catalyzing reactions involving enolates derived from CoA ester substrates. Structural studies imply that all members of the family feature a similar scaffold, which enables binding of the CoA substructure and provides an oxyanion hole to stabilize an enolate anion. The rest of the active sites appear to be tailored to the individual reaction being catalyzed (18Gerlt J.A. Babbitt P.C. Annu. Rev.

CarB Cloning, Expression, and Purification—A PCR-amplified DNA product corresponding to the P. carotovora carB gene was engineered as a NdeI-BamHI fragment into the pET24a expression vector (Novagen) and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) supercompetent cells. Cells were grown in shake flasks at 37 °C using 2TY medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. At A600 0.7, cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and growth was allowed to continue for 4 h; CarB expression was ∼30% of the total soluble protein. Cultured cells were resuspended in Tris-HCl (15 ml, 50 mm, pH 7.5) and sonicated (HeatSystems), and the lysate was centrifuged (35,000 × g 4 °C) for 20 min. The resultant supernatant was filtered (0.22 μm, Millipore) and then applied directly to a Q-Sepharose FF column (12 ml) preequilibrated with Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.5).

The resultant supernatant was applied directly to a DEAE-Sepharose column (10 ml) pre-equilibrated with Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 8).

(Molecular mass by negative ion electrospray MS: 55892 ± 23 Da, cf. calculated mass without N-terminal Met, 55867.1 Da.) Quantitative Gel Filtration and Native PAGE Analysis—The “native” molecular weight of CarB was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography and by native PAGE analyses. Calibration for size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200 HR) was carried out using cytochrome c (12 kDa), chymotrypsin (25 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa) and blue dextran (2000 kDa) (Gel Filtration Calibration Kit, Amersham Biosciences). An elution volume parameter (Kav) was calculated for each of the calibration proteins and a calibration curve constructed. By calculation Kav for CarB the native molecular weight was established. Native PAGE employed 15% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels lacking SDS and run at 20 mV for 10 h. DTNB Assay—Production of free CoA (CoASH) was assayed by reaction with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) to produce thionitrobenzoate, which has a maximum absorbance at λmax = 412 nm (25Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Assay mixtures (50 μl) were diluted 4-fold and derivatized with DTNB reagent (50 μl). Absorbance was measured at 405 nm (Shimadzu UV-1601). Calibration was carried out using a range of CoASH concentrations. A typical assay mixture consisted of Tris-HCl, pH7.5 (20 mm), malonyl CoA (0.8 mm), GSA (∼1.6 mm), CarB (0.32 mg·ml-1). The assay mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min prior to derivatization. LC/MS—LC/MS was performed using a Waters high performance liquid chromatography system connected to a Micro-Mass ZMD mass spectrometer in the negative ion mode. Assay mixtures as for the DTNB assay were precipitated with acetone (equal volume) and centrifuged (17,800 × g) for 5 min before analysis. Controls were carried out under identical conditions but with CarB omitted. The assay mixture (20 μl) was injected onto a Waters μBondpak NH2 (270 mm × 4.6 mm) column (Phenomenex) equilibrated in 5% MeOH at 1 ml·min-1. After 5 min, a gradient to 5% MeOH, 0.05% formic acid was run over 10 min. These conditions were maintained for 10 min before returning to 5% MeOH over 5 min and re-equilibration for 15 min. Preparative LC/MS used an 0.75-ml injection onto a C18/NH2 5-μm Spherisorb mixed mode column (250 × 9.4 mm) equilibrated in 5% MeOH at 4 ml·min-1. A gradient to 5% MeOH, 0.1% formic acid was run over 5 min. These conditions were maintained for 20 min before returning to 5% MeOH over 5 min and re-equilibration for 25 min. Coupled CarB/CarA/CarC assays contained Tris-HCl, pH 9 (10 mm), 2-oxoglutarate (1 mm), CarC (1.6 mg·ml-1), FeSO4 (1 mm), MgCl2 (2 mm), ATP (3 mm), CarA (2.5 mg·ml-1), malonyl- or methylmalonyl-CoA (3 mm), GSA (∼7.5 mm), and CarB (1.2 mg·ml-1). Coupled CarB/CarA assays were as stated above with the omission of CarC, 2-oxoglutarate, and FeSO4. The assay mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. For the bioassays, assay mixtures were transferred into holed (11-mm diameter) bioassay plates (E. coli X580) and incubated at 28 °C overnight. For LC/MS analysis, assay mixtures were mixed with MeCN (equal volume), chilled on ice for 5 min, and then centrifuged (17,800 × g) for 5 min before analysis. The assay mixture (100 μl) was injected onto a Synergi Polar-RP (250 mm × 4.6 mm) column (Phenomenex) equilibrated in 5% MeCN at 1 ml·min-1. After 15 min, a gradient to 90% MeCN was run over 5 min. These conditions were maintained for 5 min before returning to 5% MeCN over 5 min and re-equilibration for 10 min. CD spectra were obtained in H2O at 20 °C with a JASCO J-720 spectropolarimeter using a 1 mm path length. 1H NMR spectra were obtained in D2O at 500 MHz on a Bruker DRX-500 spectrometer. DPFGSE-TOCSY 1H NMR was carried out as described by Sharman (26Sharman G.J. Chem. Commun. 1999; : 1319-1320Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Native mass spectrometry was carried out on a Micromass Platform quadrupole mass spectrometer in 3 mm ammonium acetate with the enzyme concentration at 8 pmol·μl-1 and a range of cone voltages. Recombinant CarB and CarA were produced in E. coli and highly purified (>95% by SDS-PAGE analysis). For CarB, a three-column procedure employing anion exchange (Q-Sepharose), hydrophobic interaction (Phenyl-Resource), and gel filtration (Superdex-S75) steps (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 2) was used. For CarA, anion exchange (DEAE-Sepharose) was followed by a second anion exchange step (Mono-Q) and gel filtration (Superdex-S75). Quantitative gel filtration and native PAGE analyses indicated that purified CarB existed primarily as a trimer, consistent with crystallographic analyses of other members of the crotonase family (27Bahnson B.J.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8103-8109Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Initially the activity of purified CarB was assayed by spectrophotometric determination of CoASH employing DTNB as a derivatization reagent (25Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Assays were carried out with AcCoA and synthetic racemic GSA. However, no production of CoASH above background levels was observed, and no CMP was observed by LC/MS analyses. Because enzymes from the crotonase family have been reported to use a variety of acyl-CoA derivatives as substrates (18Gerlt J.A. Babbitt P.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 209-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 19Holden H.M. Benning M.M. Haller T. Gerlt J.A. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 20Xiang H. Luo L.S. Taylor K.L. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7638-7652Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we examined various acyl-CoA derivatives as potential CarB substrates. Stearoyland acetoacetyl-CoA were not substrates, but in the presence of GSA the DTNB derivatization assay revealed that CarB clearly catalyzed the conversion of malonyl-CoA to CoASH (specific activity of 4.0 μmol·min-1·mg protein-1). The spectrophotometric observations that malonyl-CoA acts as a substrate for CarB were supported by nanospray mass spectrometry analyses. Under native conditions CarB was observed predominantly as a trimer by mass spectrometry, supporting the native PAGE and quantitative gel filtration analyses. When incubated with malonyl-CoA in the absence of GSA, CarB catalyzed its decarboxylation to AcCoA, observed by mass spectrometry both free in solution and as an enzyme-bound complex (Fig. 3). In contrast, in the presence of both malonyl-CoA and GSA, production of both an enzyme-bound complex with CoASH and free CoASH in solution was observed. CarB-mediated catalytic conversion of 2-methylmalonyl-CoA to CoASH was also observed by using the DTNB assay. Production of CMP and 6-methyl-CMP (probably as a mixture of C-6 epimers) was confirmed using LC/MS and, in the case of the former, NMR analyses (500 MHz) of both crude reaction mixtures (using DGFGSE-TOCSY 1H NMR (26Sharman G.J. Chem. Commun. 1999; : 1319-1320Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar)) and high pressure liquid chromatography-purified product (Fig. 4). A comparison of the NMR data for CMP produced via CarB catalysis with synthetic standards of (2S,5S)-CMP and (2S,5R)-CMP implied the production of only (>95%) the “trans” (5S)-CMP diastereomer (or its enantiomer). There was no evidence for the formation of the “cis” (5R)-CMP diastereomer (or its enantiomer) within the limits of detection. Assignment of the stereochemistry of the predominant CMP isomer produced via CarB catalysis as (2S,5S)-CMP was performed by comparison of the CD spectra of the enzymatically produced CMP with the chemically synthesized CMP. LC/MS assays of the coupled CarB and CarA reactions demonstrated production of CMP or 6-methyl-CMP from malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA, respectively. Bioassays conducted on CarA, CarB, and CarC resulted in the production of a zone of antibiosis, indicating the production of an active antibiotic when malonyl-CoA was used as a starting material. However, with methylmalonyl-CoA under analogous conditions, no antibiosis was observed, indicating either that CarC is unable to epimerize/desaturate the 6-methyl-carbapenam or, less likely, because 6-ethyl-carbapenem antibiotics have been reported, that the 6-methyl-carbapenem produced is not an active antibiotic. Although malonyl-CoA is commonly used as a two-carbon source in polyketide biosynthesis (see e.g. Refs. 31Carreras C.W. Pieper R. Khosla C. Top. Curr. Chem. 1997; 188: 85-126Crossref Google Scholar and 32Cane D.E. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: R319-R325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), with the exception of methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase, it is not used by known members of the crotonase family, making its use by CarB unusual. Further, although precedented (β-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA lyase and feruloyl-CoA hydratase/lyase), it is also unusual for crotonases to catalyze CoA ester hydrolysis. Intermolecular C–C bond formation involving heterocyclic substrates is unprecedented in the family. The sequence alignment of CarB with other members of the crotonase family highlights a high degree of similarity in the β-sheet core of the protein, which is very well conserved structurally in the other members of the family (18Gerlt J.A. Babbitt P.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 209-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 19Holden H.M. Benning M.M. Haller T. Gerlt J.A. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 20Xiang H. Luo L.S. Taylor K.L. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7638-7652Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Residues with a functionality similar to those responsible for binding the CoA portion of the substrate are also predicted to be present in a similar location in CarB (Fig. 1). The observed decarboxylation of malonyl-CoA by CarB in the absence of GSA is consistent with a mechanism involving an initial decarboxylation to form an enzyme-bound enolate, analogous to the mechanism proposed for methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase (28Benning M.M. Haller T. Gerlt J.A. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4630-4639Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, in the reaction catalyzed by CarB, instead of protonation the enolate formed can react with GSA/pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) to produce CMP (Scheme 2). The enolate may react with the protonated imine form of P5C to give CMP directly. Alternatively, it may react with GSA (in an aldol reaction) to give, after loss of water, an alkene, which undergoes an intramolecular Michael reaction in a kinetically favored 5-exo-trig reaction (33Baldwin J.E. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1976; : 734-736Crossref Google Scholar). The distinct lack of activity with AcCoA under standard assay conditions suggests the absence of an appropriately positioned, or strong enough, base to form an enolate for this potential substrate. The use of malonyl-CoA rather than AcCoA, may reflect a requirement to physically separate any base involved in enolate formation from the electrophilic P5C/GSA, thus avoiding unwanted reactions of the latter with the enzyme-bound base/nucleophile. Because in vivo malonyl-CoA can be produced from AcCoA in a reaction catalyzed by AcCoA carboxylase, the observation of activity of CarB with malonyl-CoA agrees with previous observations of the incorporation of carbons derived from an intact acetate unit into positions 6 and 7 of the β-lactam ring (34Bycroft B.W. Maslen C. Box S.J. Brown A. Tyler J.W. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1988; 41: 1231-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Given the apparent lack of absolute stereoselectivity of CarA (10Gerratana B. Stapon A. Townsend C.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7836-7847Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which minimally accepts three stereoisomers of CMP (albeit with different efficiencies), the production (at least predominantly) of a single enantiomer of CMP by CarB rationalizes the observation of only the (3S,5S)-carbapenam as the sole in vivo product of CarA. It is likely that CarD and CarE, which display sequence similarity with proline oxidase and 2Fe2S ferrodoxin, are responsible for increasing the level of the GSA/P5C via its biosynthesis from l-proline (5McGowan S.J. Sebaihia M. Porter L.E. Stewart G. Williams P. Bycroft B.W. Salmond G.P.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Aside from its synthetic implications, the observation that methylmalonyl-CoA is a substrate for CarB has possible implications for the biosynthesis of substituted carbapenems such as thienamycin (3Nunez L.E. Mendez C. Brana A.F. Blanco G. Salas J.A. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (Scheme 3). Most naturally occurring carbapenems, including antibiotics with the medicinally useful hydroxyethyl side chain, are substituted at the C-6 position, (35Page M.I. The Chemistry of Beta-lactams.

Recently, the sequence for the biosynthetic gene cluster for thienamycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces cattleya has been reported and a pathway proposed (3Nunez L.E. Mendez C. Brana A.F. Blanco G.

In this proposal a CarB homologue, ThnE, is proposed to catalyze the formation of a CoA derivative of dehydro-CMP from γ-glutamyl phosphate and AcCoA (following from earlier suggestions by Houck et al.

In the next step it is proposed that a methyl transfer involving S-adenosylmethionine occurs to give a C-6 methyl dehydro-CMP CoA derivative, cyclization of which is mediated by ThnM (a homologue of CarA (29% identity, 53% similarity)) to give a 6-methyl-carbapen-2-em. Given the assigned roles of β-lactam synthetase (13McNaughton H.J. Thirkettle J.E. Zhang Z. Schofield C.J. Jensen S.E. Barton B. Greaves P. Chem. Commun. 1998; : 2325-2326Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Bachmann B.O. Li R. Townsend C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9082-9086Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and CarA in clavam and (5R)-carbapenem biosynthesis, respectively, it seems most reasonable that ThnM catalyzes ATP-driven bicyclic β-lactam formation. It is not yet known whether the simple (5R)-carbapenem is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of more complex carbapenems such as thienamycin. Although ThnE and ThnM are closely related to CarB and CarA, respectively, there is not a close homologue of CarC, the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase that catalyzes the epimerization and desaturation in carbapenem biosynthesis. However examination of the open reading frames of the thienamycin gene cluster reveals two likely 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases (ThnG and ThnO). Sequence analyses reveal that these are phylogenetically related to phytanoyl-CoA hydrolase (data not shown). This enzyme catalyzes the β-hydroxylation of the chlorophyll metabolite phytanoyl-CoA in humans (38Mukherji M. Chien W. Kershaw N.J. Clifton I.J. Schofield C.J. Wierzbicki A.S. Lloyd M.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1971-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Sequence analyses indicate the presence of closely related enzymes, possibly phytanoyl-CoA hydrolases, in bacteria including mycobacteria. Human phytanoyl-CoA hydrolase has been shown to accept truncated substrates such as isovaleryl-CoA (23Mukherji M. Kershaw N.J. Schofield C.J. Wierzbicki A.S. Lloyd M.D. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 597-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). There is thus an interesting structural correlation between substrates for phytanoyl-CoA hydrolase, which contain CoA and various isolated natural carbapenems, and carbapenams, which contain a pantotheinyl or (N-acyl)-cysteaminyl group at C-2 (Scheme 3). Because CarB and ThnE are very closely related (37% identity, 67% similarity), the work described herein suggests that ThnE will catalyze formation of CMP or a 6-substituted CMP derivative such as 6-methyl-CMP. If ThnE catalyzes CMP formation from malonyl-CoA and GSA/P5C, one of the three assigned methyl transferases (ThnK, ThnL, or ThnP) in the thienamycin gene cluster may catalyze transfer of a methyl group to the 6-position of CMP or a later intermediate. We considered an alternative possibility, i.e. that ThnE catalyzes the formation of 6-methyl-CMP from methylmalonyl-CoA (or propanoyl-CoA) and GSA. CarB was shown to accept racemic methylmalonyl-CoA as a substrate and CarA to convert the resultant β-amino acid produced to a carbapenam (probably a mixture of epimers). Although this result does not demonstrate that thienamycin biosynthesis occurs in the same manner, it does reveal the biochemical viability of such a route. Labeling studies have shown that the two carbons of the 6-ethyl/hydroxyethyl carbapenems are both derived from the one-carbon pool (S-adenosylmethionine) (37Houck D.R. Kobayashi K. Williamson J.M. Floss H.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 5365-5366Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The known biosynthetic routes to methylmalonyl-CoA all proceed via propanoyl-CoA, which can be biosynthesized by a number of different routes. However, these routes do not (to our knowledge) include a direct methyl transfer (to e.g. malonyl-CoA), possibly indicating a thienamycin pathway that does not directly involve methylmalonyl-CoA. Given the highly unusual nature of some of the reactions already identified in carbapenem biosynthesis, and more generally in β-lactam biosynthesis, a new and chemically plausible route to methylmalonyl-CoA involving methylation of malonyl-CoA (or a derivative) is a possibility.

https://openalex.org/W2069809595,"Legionella pneumophila proliferates within alveolar macrophages as a central property of Legionnaires' disease. Intracellular growth involves formation of a replicative phagosome, which requires the bacterial Dot/Icm system, a multiprotein secretion apparatus that translocates proteins from the bacterium across the macrophage plasma membrane. Two components of this system, IcmR and IcmQ, are proposed to exhibit a chaperone/substrate relationship similar to that observed in other protein translocation systems. We report here that IcmQ inserts into lipid membranes and forms pores that allow the efflux of the dye calcein but not Dextran 3000. Both membrane insertion and pore formation were inhibited by IcmR. Trypsin digestion mapping demonstrated that IcmQ is subdivided into two functional domains. The N-terminal region of IcmQ was necessary and sufficient for insertion into lipid membranes and calcein efflux. The C-terminal domain was necessary for efficient association of the protein with lipid bilayers. IcmR was found to bind to the N-terminal portion of the protein thus providing a mechanism for its ability to inhibit IcmQ pore-forming activity. Localization of IcmQ on the surface of the L. pneumophila shortly after infection as well as its pore-forming capacities suggest a role for IcmQ in forming a channel that leads translocated effectors out of the bacterium.

Legionella pneumophila is a Gram-negative bacterium that multiplies inside amoebae found in fresh water ecosystems (1Fields B.S. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 286-290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). It is believed that inhalation of aerosols containing either free-living L. pneumophila or amoeba laden with the bacteria leads to colonization of the lungs. Phagocytosed L. pneumophila then grow within alveolar macrophages in a fashion similar to that observed with amoeba (2Glavin F.L. Winn Jr., W.C. Craighead J.E. Ann. Intern. Med. 1979; 90: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 3Katz S.M. Hashemi S. Lab. Invest. 1982; 46: 24-32PubMed Google Scholar), eventually causing a severe form of pneumonia known as Legionnaires' disease (4Fraser D.W. Tsai T.R. Orenstein W. Parkin W.E. Beecham H.J. Sharrar R.G.

The ability of L. pneumophila to grow intracellularly can be recapitulated within cultured macrophages or cell lines (1Fields B.S. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 286-290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Phagosomes harboring L. pneumophila avoid fusion with the endocytic network as early as 5-min postinfection (5Swanson M.S. Hammer B.K. Ann. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 567-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 17Roy C.R. Berger K.H. Isberg R.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), as endosomal markers such as Rab5 or the transferrin receptor are excluded from the phagosome (6Horwitz M.A. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 2108-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 7Clemens D.L. Lee B.Y. Horwitz M.A. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2671-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Instead, the compartment appears to mature via a unique pathway that involves recruitment of components found in the early secretory pathway (8Tilney L.G. Harb O.S. Connelly P.S. Robinson C.G. Roy C.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4637-4650PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kagan J.C. Roy C.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). For example, the secretory pathway marker Arf1 has been recently localized on the L. pneumophila phagosome shortly after infection (10Nagai H. Kagan J.C. Zhu X. Kahn R.A. Roy C.R. Science. 2002; 295: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), and markers of early secretory vesicles are found surrounding the phagosome within 15 min after bacterial contact with macrophages (9Kagan J.C. Roy C.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Within a few hours, rough endoplasmic reticulum accumulates and potentially docks with the phagosome (11Horwitz M.A. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 1319-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 12Swanson M.S. Isberg R.R. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3609-3620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inside this intracellular niche, the bacteria replicate, yielding dozens of bacteria before lysing out of the macrophage to initiate a new replication cycle. Several independent genetic screens have led to the identification of bacterial factors necessary for intracellular proliferation of L. pneumophila (13Berger K.H. Isberg R.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 7-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 14Brand B.C. Sadosky A.B. Shuman H.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 797-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 15Segal G.

Single mutations in the majority of the 25 dot/icm genes lead to complete inhibition of intracellular growth. Most dot/icm mutants fail to form a replicative phagosome and cannot avoid the endocytic pathway (17Roy C.R. Berger K.H. Isberg R.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 18Wiater L.A. Dunn K. Maxfield F.R. Shuman H.A. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4450-4460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The majority of these genes show similarity to components of conjugative DNA transfer systems found on IncI plasmids R64 and Col1b-P9 (15Segal G. Shuman H.A. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 5057-5066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Vogel J.P. Andrews H.L. Wong S.K. Isberg R.R. Science. 1998; 279: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 19Komano T. Yoshida T. Narahara K. Furuya N. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1348-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, L. pneumophila can mobilize the RSF1010 plasmid between bacterial strains in a dot/icm-dependent manner (16Vogel J.P. Andrews H.L. Wong S.K. Isberg R.R. Science. 1998; 279: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 20Segal G. Purcell M. Shuman H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). By analogy to other pathogens, it was hypothesized that the products of the dot/icm genes are the building blocks of a type IV secretion system that allows translocation of bacterial factors into the host cell. In agreement with this idea, RalF, which activates the cellular small GTPase protein Arf1, is a translocation substrate of the Dot/Icm system (10Nagai H. Kagan J.C. Zhu X. Kahn R.A. Roy C.R. Science. 2002; 295: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), as is LidA, a coiled-coil protein that associates with the phagosomal membrane (21Conover G.M. Derre I. Vogel J.P. Isberg R.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 305-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Wild-type L. pneumophila but not dot/icm mutants induce osmotic cell death of the macrophages at a high multiplicity of infection (22Kirby J.E. Vogel J.P. Andrews H.L. Isberg R.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that the Dot/Icm proteins allow the secretion of a pore-forming protein that inserts into the host cell membrane as part of the secretion channel, and the resulting pore is responsible for this cytotoxicity. In contrast with this hypothesis, however, a partial loss of function mutation in icmT depresses high multiplicity of infection cytotoxicity but does not affect intracellular proliferation in U937 cells. This indicates that the pore formation promoted by L. pneumophila may not be involved in translocation of effector molecules into host cells (23Molmeret M. Alli O.A. Radulic M. Susa M. Doric M. Kwaik Y.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 24Molmeret M. Alli O.A. Zink S. Flieger A. Cianciotto N.P. Kwaik Y.A. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Several of the Dot/Icm proteins have been studied in detail, although no biochemical activities have been demonstrated for any components of this apparatus, except for the ability of IcmR to inhibit self-association of IcmQ (25Coers J. Kagan J.C. Mathews M. Nagai H. Zuckman D.M. Roy C.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 719-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 26Dumenil G. Isberg R.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1113-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Analysis of icmR and icmQ deletion strains indicates that these genes encode proteins necessary for intracellular growth, proper intracellular trafficking as well as high multiplicity of infection cytotoxicity (25Coers J. Kagan J.C. Mathews M. Nagai H. Zuckman D.M. Roy C.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 719-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 26Dumenil G. Isberg R.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1113-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although these phenotypes suggest participation in the secretion channel itself, either within the bacterial envelope or on the mammalian plasma membrane, subcellular fractionation studies indicate that both IcmR and IcmQ are found in soluble fractions (25Coers J. Kagan J.C. Mathews M. Nagai H. Zuckman D.M. Roy C.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 719-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The bulk of these two proteins is found in a complex likely to consist of one molecule of IcmQ and two or three molecules of IcmR (26Dumenil G. Isberg R.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1113-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the absence of IcmR, however, IcmQ forms large soluble homopolymers having a wide range of molecular weights, a property reminiscent of the behavior of type III secretion substrates in the absence of their chaperone (27Wattiau P. Woestyn S. Cornelis G.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 28Hueck C.J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 379-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A chaperone/substrate interaction has also been observed in the virB secretion system of the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens, suggesting that conjugative systems similar to Dot/Icm may use such chaperones (29Deng W. Chen L. Peng W.T. Liang X. Sekiguchi S. Gordon M.P. Comai L. Nester E.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1795-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 30Dumas F. Duckely M. Pelczar P. Van Gelder P. Hohn B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We report here that although the primary sequence of IcmQ indicates that it is a highly hydrophilic protein, purified soluble IcmQ efficiently inserts into lipid membranes allowing efflux of a fluor of defined molecular weight. This behavior is reminiscent of pore-forming toxins such as Staphylococcus aureus α-toxin (31Bhakdi S. Tranum-Jensen J. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 733-751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). L. pneumophila Bacterial Strains and Cultures—L. pneumophila strains used in this study were derived from the wild-type strain LP02 (thyA, hsdR, rpsL) (32Berger K.H. Merriam J.J. Isberg R.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 809-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). LP03 is a dotA mutant isogenic to LP02 (32Berger K.H. Merriam J.J. Isberg R.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 809-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). GD59 is isogenic to LP02, and contains a ΔicmR mutation. Strains were passaged on CYET plates and AYE broth as described previously (13Berger K.H. Isberg R.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 7-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). For L. pneumophila, chloramphenicol was used at 5 μg/ml. For all experiments, L. pneumophila strains were grown to post-exponential phase (OD600 of 3.3-3.5) using bacterial motility as a post-exponential phase marker. The broad host range plasmid pMMB207 (33Morales V.M. Backman A. Bagdasarian M. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 97: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) was used to overexpress IcmQ under the control of the Ptac promoter in L. pneumophila strains. An EcoRI and SalI digestion fragment of the plasmid pGD32 (26Dumenil G. Isberg R.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1113-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) encoding the icmQ coding sequence was inserted into the EcoRI- and SalI-digested pMMB207, generating pGD41. Mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages were isolated from femurs of female A/J mice (Jackson Laboratories) and cultivated in L cell-conditioned media as described previously (34Celada A. Gray P.W. Rinderknecht E. Schreiber R.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 55-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Production of the IcmR-IcmQ Complex—Plasmid pGD31 was used to express the GST-IcmR fusion protein in Escherichia coli (26Dumenil G. Isberg R.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1113-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Plasmid pGD41 (described above) was used to express IcmQ in the absence of any tag. To allow in vivo formation of the complex, pGD31 and pGD41 were cotransformed into E. coli XL-1 blue (35Bullock W.O. Fernandez J.M. Short J.M. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 376-379Google Scholar), generating GD105. One-liter cultures of GD105 were grown to OD600 of 1.0 at 37 °C and induced with 0.1 mm IPTG 1The abbreviations used are: IPTGisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranosidePLphospholipidPCphosphatidylcholinePEphosphatidylethanolaminePGphosphatidylglycerolPIphosphatidylinositolCAcardiolipinChcholesterolICDHisocitrate dehydrogenaseTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineGSTglutathione S-transferase. for 3 h. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 40 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl (TN), and sonicated on ice for 2 min on 50% duty cycle with a Branson Sonifier 250. Samples were then cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. 1 ml of glutathione-agarose (Amersham Biosciences) slurry was incubated with the cleared bacterial lysates for a period of 1-2 h. After extensive washing of the beads with TN buffer, the IcmR-IcmQ complex was cleaved from GST by adding 80 units of thrombin to the slurry and incubating the samples overnight at 4 °C. The suspension was then centrifuged briefly to pellet the beads, and the supernatant was collected. Thrombin was then removed by mixing the cleavage product with ∼30 μl of benzamidine agarose slurry (Sigma) and incubating for 15 min. The agarose was then pelleted, and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (BioRad), and the sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside phospholipid phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylglycerol phosphatidylinositol cardiolipin cholesterol isocitrate dehydrogenase N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine glutathione S-transferase. Purification of His-tagged Proteins—The open reading frame of IcmQ was inserted into the pQE70 plasmid (Qiagen) to allow expression of IcmQ fused to a C-terminal histidine tag, generating pGD37. Oligonucleotides 5′-CATGAAAGATCAACTCTCGGATGAAC-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTGCATTTTTAATTAGACGGCCATTG-3′ (the BamHI site is underlined) were used to amplify a DNA fragment encoding the IcmQ open reading from LP02 genomic DNA. This fragment was digested by BamHI and cloned into pQE70 previously digested by SphI and BamHI (the SphI site overhang was blunted with mung bean nuclease). The C-terminal portion of IcmQ was cloned into the pQE70 plasmid to allow expression of amino acids 68-191 of IcmQ fused to a C-terminal histidine tag, generating pGD46. The DNA fragment corresponding to amino acids 68-191 of IcmQ was generated by PCR using oligonucleotides 5′-CATGATTGCCTTAAGGAGTGGTCAG-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTGCATTTTTAATTAGACGGCCATTG-3′ (the BamHI site is underlined) from LP02 genomic DNA. This fragment was digested by BamHI and cloned into pQE70 previously digested by SphI and BamHI (the SphI site overhang was blunted with mung bean nuclease). The plasmid pGD46 was electroporated in the XL-1 Blue containing pREP4 (Qiagen), generating GD 120. To construct IQN, the 5′-end of icmQ was inserted into pQE70 to allow expression of amino acids 1-72 of IcmQ fused to a C-terminal histidine tag. The DNA fragment corresponding to codons 1-72 of icmQ was generated by PCR using oligonucleotides 5′-CCCGAAAAGTGCCACCTG-3′ and 5′CGGGATCCATTTGCAAGATGAGACTCTGC-3′ (the BamHI site is underlined) from pGD46. This fragment was digested by BamHI and inserted into pQE70 previously digested by SphI and BamHI (the SphI site overhang was blunted with mung bean nuclease) generating pTIM1. The plasmid pTIM1 was electroporated in the XL-1 Blue containing pREP4 (Qiagen). One-liter cultures of the full-length or C-terminal portion of IcmQ were grown to an OD600 of 1.0 and induced with 0.1 mm IPTG for 3 h. Bacteria were pelleted, resuspended in 40 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole. The suspension was sonicated on ice for 2 min on 50% duty cycle with a Branson Sonifier 250, pelleted at 12,000 × g for 15 min, and lysates were loaded onto a 5-ml metal chelation Hi trap column (Amersham Biosciences) using a Amersham Biosciences FPLC system. After extensive washing of the column with TN buffer, His-tagged proteins were eluted using 50 ml of a 0-200 mm imidazole gradient. Fractions containing full-length IcmQ or IQC were pooled and dialyzed overnight against TN buffer. IcmQ Membrane Insertion Assay—All lipids used in this study were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. E. coli PL from this supplier represents a crude extract from bacteria with the following composition: 67% PE, 23% PG, and 10% CA. Lipids stored in chloroform at –80 °C were dried down under a nitrogen stream in a 15-ml Corex tube and then dessicated overnight. Unless otherwise stated, 5 mg of lipids were used. Large unilamellar vesicles were prepared by two different techniques, either by detergent dilution (36Mimms L.T. Zampighi G. Nozaki Y. Tanford C. Reynolds J.A. Biochem. 1981; 20: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) or by extrusion (37Hope M.J. Bally M. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). For the detergent-based approach, lipids were resuspended in 0.5 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 5% n-octylglucoside in the presence or absence of protein. The mixtures were then dialyzed against TN buffer for 24 h. For the extrusion-based approach, the lipid cake was hydrated at room temperature for 30 min in 0.5 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA (TNE). Four cycles of freeze and thaw were performed between an ethanol/dry ice mix and a water bath either at room temperature or at 60 °C depending on whether the transition temperature of the lipids was above or below 50 °C. The suspension was then extruded by several passes through a 0.1 μm pore polycarbonate membrane using a mini extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids). Certain lipid mixtures such as the PC 18:0 first required passage through a 1 μm polycarbonate membrane to prevent clogging of the filter. To assess association of proteins with preformed lipid vesicles, 20 μg of protein was mixed with 5 mg of lipid vesicles in TNE buffer and incubated at room temperature for 30 min prior to sucrose gradient centrifugation. Sucrose in TNE buffer was added to the samples to a final concentration of 45% (w/v) and 1 ml of the mixture was placed at the tube bottom (bottom fraction). A 7-ml 30% (w/v) sucrose solution in TNE buffer was layered on the samples (middle fraction) and finally 1 ml of TNE was layered on top (top fraction). The samples were then subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g in a Beckman SW41 rotor for 15 h. The contents of the different fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE follow by Coomassie staining of the gel or by Western blot analysis. To generate lipid-associated IcmQ, the top fraction including the interface with the 30% (w/v) sucrose layer was dialyzed against TNE, prior to treatment with various reagents as described in Fig. 2. Subcellular Fractionation—A 50-ml culture in AYET broth was grown until motility was observed (OD ∼3.5). The bacteria were pelleted, the supernatant was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and spheroplasts were made from the pelleted bacteria (38Roy C.R. Isberg R.R. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 571-578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionation was then performed following the procedure described by Coers et al. (25Coers J. Kagan J.C. Mathews M. Nagai H. Zuckman D.M. Roy C.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 719-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) except that Tris-HCl was used as a buffer instead of Hepes. Briefly, sonicated spheroplasts were pelleted, resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and loaded on a 3-step sucrose gradient. Membranes were collected at the 25-60% sucrose interphase, washed with a high salt solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.5 m NaCl solution and then solubilized with 2% Triton X-100. Equivalent volumes of the different fractions were loaded on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot using antibodies directed against L. pneumophila proteins. Calcein Release Assay—Lipid vesicles were generated by extrusion as described above except that lipids were resuspended at 10 mg/ml in TNE containing 80 mm calcein (pH 7.5) (39Kayalar C. Duzgunes N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 860: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Free calcein was then removed using a 10-ml G-75 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with TNE. The lipid vesicles were diluted in TNE to a final concentration of 60 μg/ml in cuvettes having four clear sides, and subjected to constant agitation. Fluorescence emission was monitored at 520 nm after excitation at 490 nm using an SLM Aminco spectrofluorometer. As an alternative to calcein, Dextran 3000 tetramethyl rhodamine (Molecular Probes) was resuspended at 20 mg/ml in TNE, added to the dried lipids and extruded lipid vesicles were prepared as above. Fluorescence was monitored at 580 nm after excitation at 530 nm. Sonication Release Assay—PC vesicles containing IcmQ derivatives were prepared using the OG dialysis technique described above. As a control, vesicles were prepared in the absence of protein but in the presence of 80 mm calcein. Following purification, the lipid vesicles were sonicated using a Bransen Sonifier 250. To determine the efficiency of vesicle disruption, the vesicles were diluted in TNE and fluorescence emission was monitored as above. Sonication conditions were found such that there was 50% of the maximum fluorescence of the calceinladen vesicles (30 pulses, output level 3, 50% duty cycle), indicating at least 50% of the vesicle contents had been released, relative to treatment with 0.1% Triton X-100. These conditions were then applied to lipid vesicles incubated with protein. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Tris-Tricine gels (15% acrylamide) were performed as described (40Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10503) Google Scholar) except that the sample buffer contained phenol red dye. For Tris glycine gels, samples were boiled for 5 min in Laemmli buffer, resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Immunoblotting was then performed as described (26Dumenil G. Isberg R.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1113-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Membranes were processed with the Renaissance detection kit (PerkinElmer Life Science Products), and blots were either exposed to film (Kodak) or the image was directly acquired on a Kodak Image Station to allow quantitation of the signal. Immunofluorescence—For IcmQ localization studies, GD132 (LP02/pGD32, Ptac-icmQ) was grown to an OD600 of 2.5 in AYET broth before adding IPTG at 0.1 mm for about 2 h until the culture reached post-exponential phase. Bacteria were then either fixed in periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde (PLP) (41McLean I.W. Nakane P.K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1974; 22: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar) containing 5% sucrose for 30 min or used to infect macrophages. Bacteria were deposited on bone marrow-derived macrophages at an multiplicity of infection of 20 by centrifugation at 150 × g for 5 min at room temperature and then incubated at 37 °C for various times. Cells were fixed for 30 min at 37 °C in PLP containing 5% sucrose. After removal of the fixative by washing with phosphate-buffered saline, infected cells were permeabilized with –20 °C methanol for 10 s. To analyze broth grown bacteria in the absence of mammalian cells, bacteria were pelleted onto coverslips previously treated with 0.1% poly-l-lysine. Coverslips with fixed infected macrophages or broth grown bacteria were then treated in parallel. Coverslips were blocked and stained with anti-L. pneumophila antibody as described (42Swanson M.S. Isberg R.R. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2585-2594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were then stained with biotinylated affinity-purified anti-IcmQ polyclonal antibody (1:200) (26Dumenil G. Isberg R.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 1113-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Biotinylation was performed according to the manufacturer (Pierce). After extensive washing, coverslips were then stained with streptavidin-Alexa-488 (1:2000, Molecular Probes). IcmQ Associates with Lipid Vesicles—Several substrates found in type III and IV secretion systems interact with lipid membranes when released from their chaperone (43Cornelis G.R. Van Gijsegem F. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 735-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). To address whether IcmQ exhibits such properties we tested whether purified recombinant His-tagged IcmQ (“Materials and Methods”) could associate with and/or insert into phospholipid (PL) bilayers by incubating purified IcmQ with PL extracts in the presence of 5% n-octylglucoside (OG; “Materials and Methods”). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) was also added to the mixture as a negative control. The detergent was removed by dialysis to allow the formation of PL vesicles and the preparation was analyzed on a three-step sucrose gradient to determine the amount of PL-associated IcmQ. About 30% of the total IcmQ added in the reaction floated with E. coli PL to the top step of the gradient (Fig. 1A, E. coli). In the same sample, less than 10% of GST copurified with the PL, presumably due to the trapping of the protein within the internal volume of the vesicles. When liver PL extracts were used to make the vesicles, almost 90% of total IcmQ was found to be PL-associated (Fig. 1A, Liver). In the absence of PL, IcmQ was found entirely in the bottom fraction of the gradient (data not shown). IcmQ is thus able to associate with lipids and the efficiency of association depended on the composition of the PL vesicles. We next tested whether soluble IcmQ could associate with preformed lipid vesicles (Fig. 1B). PL vesicles were first formed by incubation with OG followed by dialysis to remove the detergent. IcmQ was added to the vesicles in the absence of OG prior to loading onto a sucrose gradient and collecting fractions. Quantitative Western blot analysis revealed that under these conditions, 60% of total IcmQ associated with E. coli PL vesicles and 100% of IcmQ was associated with liver PL vesicles (Fig. 1B, IcmQ). In contrast, little or no GST was found associated with the preformed vesicles (Fig. 1B, GST). Therefore, soluble IcmQ appears to associate with PL vesicles in the absence of detergent. Phospholipid Association Is Due to Insertion—The copurification of IcmQ with PC vesicles could be the result of peripheral association or integration into the bilayer. To determine the nature of the association of IcmQ with lipids, membrane-associated IcmQ was exposed to buffers containing 1 m NaCl, or 1% Triton X-100 and subjected to sucrose gradient fractionation(Fig. 2A). Western blot analysis allowed visualization of a major band migrating at 22 kDa corresponding to IcmQ and a minor band migrating at 50 kDa that could correspond to an SDS-resistant dimer of IcmQ, High salt did not affect the association of IcmQ with lipid vesicles indicating that IcmQ is not peripherally associated with the lipid bilayer. In contrast, IcmQ could be released by addition of Triton X-10"

Plc1p is similar to metazoan δ-PICs and is the only PIC in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Genetic studies have implicated Plc1p in several cell functions, both nuclear and cytoplasmic. Here we show that a brief hypo-osmotic episode provokes rapid Plc1p-catalyzed hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in intact yeast by a mechanism independent of extracellular Ca2+. Much of this PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis occurs at the plasma membrane. The hydrolyzed PtdIns(4,5)P2 is mainly derived from PtdIns4P made by the PtdIns 4-kinase Stt4p. PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis occurs normally in mutants lacking Arg82p or Ipk1p, but they accumulate no InsP6, showing that these enzymes normally convert the liberated Ins(1,4,5)P3 rapidly and quantitatively to InsP6. We conclude that hypo-osmotic stress activates Plc1p-catalyzed PtdIns(4,5)P2 at the yeast plasma membrane and the liberated Ins(1,4,5)P3 is speedily converted to InsP6. This ability routinely to activate Plc1p-catalyed PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis in vivo opens up new opportunities for molecular and genetic scrutiny of the regulation and functions of phosphoinositidases C of the δ-subfamily.

Of the five known PIC families, PICδs are ubiquitous in eukaryotes and receptor-controlled PICs of the β, γ, and ϵ subfamilies (1Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev.

Swann K. Lai F.A. Reproduction. 2002; 124: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). A prokaryotic PIC that integrated into an emerging proto-eukaryote was probably the common ancestor of all eukaryote PICs (5Michell R.H. Gerskowitch V.P. Perspectives on Receptor Classification. Alan R. Liss Inc, New York1987: 95-101Google Scholar), and it seems likely that this was more similar to modern PICδs than the later-evolved signaling PICs (1Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar, 2Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, 3Katan M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). PICδs might even retain some of the original functions of this ancestral PIC, so it is unfortunate that we understand so little about their regulation and functions. Improved understanding of PICδs is likely to come most readily from organisms that express only one, PICδ-like, PIC and that lack the PtdIns(4,5)P2-consuming Type I phosphoinositide 3-kinases. One such is Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with Plc1p (encoded by PLC1) its sole PIC. In unstressed yeast, PLC1 deletion or mutations in the catalytic X and Y domains of Plc1p have little effect. However, the mutants display multiple problems when stressed (6Flick J.S. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5861-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 7Yoko-o T. Matsui Y. Yagisawa H.

Commun. 1998; 252: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), with two 14-3-3 proteins (Rad24p and Rad25p) (12Andoh T. Kato Jr., T. Matsui Y. Toh-e A. Mol. Gen.

Finally, mutations in two inositol polyphosphate kinases mimic some or all of the above phenotypes: Arg82p (also known as ArgRIII or Ipk2) converts Plc1p-generated Ins(1,4,5)P3 to Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5, and Ipk1p converts Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 to InsP6 (17York J.D.

Some, such as chromatin maintenance, transcription, and mRNA export, are nuclear, whereas others, including vacuole homeostasis and proteasome activity, reside in the cytosol compartment. It therefore seems that the pleiotropic phenotypes of Δplc1 cells are consequences of multiple flaws in several fundamental processes, in at least two cell compartments. Despite this substantial body of genetic evidence, there is scant information on what controls Plc1p activity in vivo. It was suggested that glucose re-admission to glucose-deprived yeast might activate Plc1p (23Kaibuchi K. Miyajima A. Arai K. Matsumoto K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8172-8176Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), but this response was later attributed mainly to polyphosphoinositide deacylation (24Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. Piggott J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3374-3383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was suggested that glucose re-admission might provoke phosphoinositide turnover and activate a plasma membrane H+ pump, with Plc1p needed for both responses (25Coccetti P. Tisi R. Martegani E. Souza Teixeira L. Lopes Brandao R. de Miranda Castro I. Thevelein J.M. Biochim Biophys Acta. 1998; 1405: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but again deacylation may have caused much of the observed phosphoinositide loss. Nitrogen re-addition to nitrogen-starved yeast provokes rapid Ins(1,4,5)P3 formation (26Schomerus C. Kuntzel H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), but this seems not to need Plc1p (27Bergsma J.C. Kasri N.N. Donaton M.C. De Wever V. Tisi R. de Winde J.H. Martegani E. Thevelein J.M. Wera S. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 517-523Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hypo-osmotic shock evokes a [Ca2+]i rise in yeast (28Batiza A.F. Schulz T. Masson P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23357-23362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and in some animal and plant cells, and hypo-osmotic shock may sometimes activate PIC (29Fujii M. Ohtsubo M. Ogawa T. Kamata H. Hirata H. Yagisawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 30Einspahr K.J. Peeler T.C. Thompson Jr., G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5775-5779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the underlying phosphoinositide changes in these responses, and how these are linked to other cellular events, remain uncertain. In this study, we present evidence that hypo-osmotic stress speedily activates Plc1p-catalyzed PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis at the plasma membrane in S. cerevisiae, and we define the source of the hydrolyzed PtdIns(4,5)P2 and the metabolic fate of the liberated Ins(1,4,5)P3.

Growth of [3H]Inositol-labeled Yeast and Procedure for Hypo-osmotic Shock—Cells were grown exponentially with [3H]inositol (5 μCi per ml), and maintained in the presence of this label throughout all manipulations until they were killed. They were acclimatized to hypertonic saline medium during 2-h incubations, in media supplemented first with 0.5 m NaCl and then with 0.9 m NaCl. The acclimatized cells (3 × 106 ml–1, 5 ml) were sedimented (3000 × g, 5 min, 23 °C) and resuspended in 0.5 ml of medium supplemented with 0.9 m NaCl at 23 °C. 15 min later they were diluted 4-fold with medium containing 0.9 m NaCl (no osmotic shock) or lacking added NaCl (hypo-osmotic stress).

DeWald Open table in a new tab Hypo-osmotic Shock in Ca2+-deprived Cells—Labeled and acclimatized yeast (see above) were harvested, washed, and re-suspended in a modified, Ca2+-free, medium containing 0.9 m NaCl. This nominally lacked Ca2+, was treated overnight with Chelex 100 resin (100–200 mesh, sodium form; Bio-Rad) and was supplemented with 1 mm EGTA and 2 mm BAPTA (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid). After 15 min at 23 °C in this medium, samples were diluted 4-fold with EGTA/BAPTA-free media that were: (a) either iso-osmotic (retaining 0.9 m NaCl) or hypo-osmotic (lacking the 0.9 m NaCl); and (b) either Ca2+-free or supplemented with Ca2+ (Ca2+-restored): the final Ca2+/chelator combinations were 1.65 mm Ca2+/0.5 mm BAPTA/0.25 mm EGTA (Ca2+-restored) or 0.5 mm BAPTA/0.25 mm EGTA (Ca2+-free). After 2 min, cells were killed, and inositol lipids and phosphates extracted and analyzed. The high ionic strength (I > 1.0) and low pH (5.7) of these incubations greatly restricts chelation by EGTA (and slightly by BAPTA) (31Tsien R.Y.

The slurry was alternately vortexed (30 s) and cooled for on ice (30 s) through 12 cycles, disrupting ≥90% of the yeast. 0.47 ml of methanol (containing 0.12 m HCl) and 1.33 ml of chloroform were added, the slurry was vortexed (30 s), and the monophasic mixture was left on ice (15 min). Bovine brain phosphoinositides (10 μg, Type I, Folch fraction V) were added in 2:1 (v/v) chloroform/methanol, and samples were vortexed (30 s) and cooled on ice. After adding 0.4 ml of a mixture of 0.1 m HCl, 100 mm Na2HPO4, 5 mm tetra-n-butyl-ammonum hydrogen sulfate (TEBAS), 2.5 mm EDTA, and 2.5 mm EGTA, mixing yielded a two-phase system (separated at 3000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). The chloroform-rich lower phase was transferred to a glass vial and dried in vacuo (unheated Speedvap), and excess HCl was removed by repeated drying in vacuo with methanol. Lipids were deacylated (monomethylamine reagent, 53 °C, 40 min) and glycerophosphoesters recovered (35Dove S.K. Michell R.H. Milligan G. Signaling Research: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1999: 255-281Google Scholar). They were resolved by anion-exchange HPLC on a 250 × 4.6 mm Partisphere 5-SAX column, eluted at 1 ml/min with a complex gradient: Solution A was H2O, and Solution B was 1.25 m (NH4)2HPO4, pH 3.8. The gradient was: 0–5 min, 0% B; 5–45 min, ramp to 12% B; 45–52 min, ramp to 20% B; 52–64 min, ramp to 100% B; then isocratic to 80 min. The eluate was continuously mixed with 3 ml/min UltimaFlo AP scintillant and fed through an on-line detector (averaging period 0.1 min). The upper phase plus interface, containing water-soluble inositol polyphosphates, were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, centrifuged (105 × g, 30 min, 30 °C) and the interfacial pellet discarded. The volume was made 2 ml with H2O, and acid was neutralized with an appropriate volume of 1 m NaOH containing 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, and 37.5 mm HEPES, and samples were stored at –20 °C. They were analyzed by HPLC on a 250 × 4.6 mm Partisphere 5-SAX column, eluted at 1 ml/min with a complex gradient: Solution A was H2O, and Solution B was 1.25 m (NH4)2HPO4, pH 3.8. The gradient was: 0–5 min, 0% B; 5–10 min, ramp to 7% B; 10–40 min, ramp to 9% B; 40–110 min, ramp to 100% B; then isocratic to 120 min. Radioactivity was measured with a flow detector (see above). A different gradient, using the same column and Solutions A and B, was used to confirm that the major inositol polyphosphate that accumulated during hypo-osmotic shock was InsP6 (Fig. 1): 0–5 min, 0% B; 5–10 min, ramp to 7% B; 10–25 min, ramp to 70% B; 25–95 min, ramp to 78% B; 95–110 min, ramp to 100% B; then isocratic to 120 min. Fractions were collected for static scintillation counting. Recombinant GST-Arg82p and GST-Ipk1p—ARG82 and IPK1 ORFs were PCR-amplified from yeast genomic DNA using sense and antisense primers (0.3 μm: for ARG82:5′-ATACGGGATCCATGGATACGGTAAACAATTAT-3′ and 5′-CACCGCTCGAGCTAGAATTTCATAAAAATATC-3′; for IPK1: 5′-ATAAGGAATTCATGCAAGTCATCGGACGT-3′ and 5′-CCCCGCTCGAGTTATTTATTTGAAGTATG-3′) and Expand proofreading DNA polymerase [25 cycles, denaturing at 94 °C (2 min initially, then 45 s per cycle), annealing at 56 °C (1 min) and extension at 72 °C (3 min; 6 min in final reaction)]. Products were purified on Qiaex-II resin. An ∼0.9-kb fragment covering the ARG82 ORF was digested with BamHI and XhoI and inserted into pGEX4T1 to make pGEX4T1-ARG82. An ∼1.1-kb PCR fragment covering the IPK1 ORF was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and inserted into pGEX4T1 to make pGEX4T1-IPK1. pGEX4T1-ARG82 and pGEX4T1-IPK1 were transformed into BL21-competent Escherichia coli. To induce expression of GST-Arg82p and GST-Ipk1p, suspensions were diluted to an OD600 of 0.1–0.2 in 1 liter of LB + 100 μg·ml–1 ampicillin, grown to an OD600 of 0.5–0.6 (∼1.5 h) and treated with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 4 h at 37 °C, cells were harvested (3000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), washed thrice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 550 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mm EDTA) and suspended in 40 ml of PBS buffer supplemented with 5 mg·liter–1 aprotinin, 5 mg·liter–1 leupeptin, 5 mg·liter–1 bestatin, 3 mg·liter–1 pepstatin, and 1 mg·liter–1 E64 (also present in subsequent PBS buffers). E. coli were disrupted (Glas-Col nebulizer, 15 min of continuous cycling, N2 pressure 200 p.s.i.) and adjusted to 27 ml. 3 ml of 10% (by volume) Triton X-100 were added, and the homogenate was end-to-end mixed (30 min), centrifuged (30,000 rpm, 15 min), and filtered (0.2 μm). Glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (75% slurry, 1.33 ml) was washed, suspended in 2 ml of PBS buffer, and packed into a 10-ml EconoPac column. The filtrate was applied (∼0.5 ml/min), and the column was washed with: (a) 40 ml of PBS buffer containing 0.1% (v:v) Triton X-100; and (b) 40 ml of detergent-free buffer (∼2.0 ml/min). GST-tagged proteins were eluted with 20 ml of PBS buffer containing 20 mm glutathione (∼0.5 ml/min). Plasmid pUG36-PLC1—The PLC1 ORF was amplified by PCR from yeast genomic DNA (primers 5′-AACCGGGATCCATGACTGAAAGTGCTATAGAT-3′ and 5′-CACCGAAGCTTCTATAAAATTTGTGTATGAAT-3′), as above. The resulting ∼2.6-kb PCR fragment was digested with BamHI and HindIII and inserted into pUG36 to make plasmid pUG36-PLC1. Construction of a Δstt4 Strain in BY4742 Background—Genomic DNA retrieved from diploid stt4::kanMX4/STT4 cells by standard techniques was transformed into haploid wild-type BY4742 cells, with 1.0 m sorbitol present during transformation and selection. Kanamycin-resistant colonies were selected on geneticin-agar plates, and replacement of STT4 with the kanr marker was confirmed when PCR amplification of genomic DNA from the kanamycin-resistant colonies yielded an ∼3.0-kb fragment (not shown). Inositol Polyphosphate Kinase Assays—The kinase activities of GST-Arg82p and GST-Ipk1p, singly and in combination, were assayed by incubating 5 μg of each protein for 0–10 min at 28 °C with 25,000 cpm of [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 in 30-μl assays containing 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 200 pm Ins(1,4,5)P3, 2 mm Na2ATP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm creatine phosphate, and 250 units of creatine kinase. Assays were terminated with 120 μl of 1.0 m HCl, neutralized with 55 μl of 1.0 m NaOH containing 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, and 37.5 mm HEPES and diluted to 2 ml with 1.795 ml H2O. Inositol polyphosphates were resolved by HPLC (see above). Measurements of GFP Fluorescence—The dimeric GFP-PLDδ-PH domain construct pTL336 was a gift from T. Levine (36Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 695-704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Changes in plasma membrane and cytosolic GFP intensity in hypo-osmotically-shocked cells were visualized on a Nikon Eclipse E600 Microscope with an XF100–3 filter cube (Omega Optical). Images were acquired with an ORCA digital camera (Hamamatsu, Japan) and changes measured using an Intensity Threshold program in Simple PCI (Compix Imaging Systems. Our experiments used S. cerevisiae that were in exponential growth until shortly before environmental perturbations were imposed. They were cultured for 5–6 generations with medium containing [2-3H]inositol, to label all inositol-containing cell constituents close to isotopic equilibrium with the intracellular precursor mixture of [3H]inositol and inositol made de novo by the resident inositol 3-phosphate synthase. Under these conditions, rapid changes in labeling of cellular inositol phospholipids and phosphates will reflect approximately equivalent changes in the relative quantities of the molecules present. Hypo-osmotic Shock Stimulates PtdIns(4,5)P2 Hydrolysis— We compared the effects of hypo-osmotic stress on the PtdIns (4,5)P2 complements of wild-type and Δplc1 yeast. Suspensions of equilibrium-labeled cells were adapted to high osmolarity, abruptly diluted 4-fold, and after various periods lipids were extracted, deacylated, and the resulting glycerophosphoesters separated by anion-exchange HPLC (see “Materials and Methods”). Fig. 1A shows typical chromatograms from wild-type and Δplc1 cells that were hypo-osmotically stressed for 2 min, and Fig. 1B records the amounts of phosphoinositides in the control and unstressed cells. The PtdIns(4,5)P2 complement of hypo-osmotically stressed wild-type cells started to decrease after ∼20 s (Fig. 1, C and D), declined by about a half within ∼2 min (Fig. 1, A–D) and started to return toward the starting value over the following 5–10 min (Fig. 1, C and D). This response was relatively straininvariant (Fig. 1D). The levels of PtdIns, PtdIns3P, and PtdIns(3,5)P2 did not change (Fig. 1B). However, the PtdIns4P content of the cells initially rose very rapidly, approximately doubling in ∼20 s, and then declined steadily during the following few minutes (Fig. 1E). Superficially, this might have suggested that 5-dephosphorylation of [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 caused both rapid [3H]PtdIns4P accumulation and [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 depletion. However, the [3H]PtdIns4P rise was complete in 20–30 s, before any major decrease in [3H]PtdIns (4,5)P2, and [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 and [3H]PtdIns4P both declined between 0.5 min and 2 min. PtdIns4P accumulation and PtdIns(4,5)P2 depletion were therefore independent events. When cells and medium were analyzed for [3H]GroPIns(4,5)P2, the product of [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 deacylation, the small amount detected corresponded to less than 5% of the 3H lost from PtdIns(4,5)P2 (not shown). Hypo-osmotic Shock Did Not Stimulate PtdIns(4,5)P2 Hydrolysis in Δplc1 Yeast—Δplc1 yeast incorporated slightly less [3H]inositol into their phosphoinositides than wild-type cells (Fig. 1B). They showed no significant changes in PtdIns(4,5)P2 complement during hypo-osmotical stress (Fig. 1, A and B), but the rapid and transient PtdIns4P accumulation still occurred (not shown). Expression of Plc1p from a multicopy plasmid in a Δplc1 strain restored [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 breakdown in response to hypo-osmotic stress (not shown). When multicopy overexpression of Plc1p was achieved in wild-type cells, it caused no substantial modification either of basal or stimulated [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 metabolism (see, for example, Fig 2C). InsP6 Accumulation Accompanies Stress-induced PtdIns(4,5)-P2 Depletion—The experiments shown in Fig. 1 employed an extraction procedure that achieves close to quantitative [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 recovery (35Dove S.K. Michell R.H. Milligan G. Signaling Research: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1999: 255-281Google Scholar). In most subsequent experiments, we also needed to recover water-soluble phosphates in a state suitable for anion-exchange HPLC analysis. For this, we used a method employing less aggressive acid chloroform-methanol extraction followed by phase partition (see “Materials and Methods”): this method retrieved inositol polyphosphates efficiently but failed to extract about one-third of [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 (not shown). We have not corrected for this under-extraction, so from Fig. 2 onwards the total [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 complements of the extracted cells would have been about 50% greater than the figures reported. When aqueous phases from unstressed [3H]inositol-labeled yeast were analyzed, there were substantial labeled peaks coincident with InsP6 (the largest peak, Fig. 2A) and with multiple InsP and InsP2 isomers (not show), and a small peak of PP-InsP5 eluted after InsP6 (at ∼113 min: Fig. 2A). InsP and InsP2 changed little during stress and were not studied in detail. Very little radioactivity eluted in parts of the chromatogram where the various isomers of InsP3, InsP4, and InsP5 emerge (Fig. 2A). This region of the chromatogram was devoid of clear-cut peaks in most experiments, but small but distinct peaks were seen in others, whether because of better HPLC or slight variations in metabolism we do not know. To confirm the identity of the putative InsP6, an aqueous extract from [14C]inositol-labeled and stressed cells was cochromatographed with authentic [3H]InsP6 in a second HPLC system (see “Materials and Methods”). The constancy of the 14C:3H ratio across the InsP6 peak confirmed its identity (Fig. 2B). When wild-type cells were hypo-osmotically stressed for 2 min or more, the most striking change in inositol polyphosphate complement was an approximate doubling of the already substantial InsP6 concentration (Fig. 2, A and C). Δplc1 cells, unstressed or following hypo-osmotic stress, behaved differently: they were devoid of inositol polyphosphates with three or more phosphate groups (Fig. 2A). These observations suggested three obvious conclusions: hypo-osmotic stress quickly stimulates Plc1p-catalyzed PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis; Plc1p-generated Ins(1,4,5)P3 is the precursor of all S. cerevisiae inositol polyphosphates; and Ins(1,4,5)P3 is converted to InsP6 so fast that no detectable intermediates accumulate. The information in Fig. 2, D and E, reinforces these deductions. First, the concurrent time courses of PtdIns(4,5)P2 depletion and InsP6 accumulation (Fig. 2D) suggest a direct relationship between PtdIns(4,5)P2 loss and InsP6 synthesis. Secondly, titration of cells with the PIC inhibitor U73122 (37Bleasdale J.E. Bundy G.L. Bunting S. Fitzpatrick F.A. Huff R.M. Sun F.F. Pike J.E. Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukoc. Res. 1989;"
https://openalex.org/W2082435993,"UBP10 codes for a deubiquitinating enzyme of Saccharomyces cerevisiae whose loss of function determines slow growth rate and partial impairment of silencing at telomeres and HM loci. A genome-wide analysis performed on a ubp10 disruptant revealed alterations in expression of subtelomeric genes together with a broad change in the whole transcriptional profile, closely parallel to that induced by oxidative stress. This response was accompanied by intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species as well as by DNA fragmentation and phosphatidylserine externalization, two markers of apoptosis. SIR4 inactivation mitigated the wide transcriptome remodeling of the ubp10 null mutant affecting particularly the stress transcriptional profile. Moreover, the ubp10sir4 disruptant did not display apoptotic markers. These results argue in favor of an involvement of deubiquitination in transcriptional control and suggest a linkage between oxidative stress and apoptotic pathway in budding yeast."

Here we show that thrombin itself up-regulates TFPI-2 mRNA and protein expression in human liver myofibroblasts, a cell type shown to express high levels of TFPI-2 (Neaud, V., Hisaka, T., Monvoisin, A., Bedin, C., Balabaud, C., Foster, D. C., Desmoulière, A., Kisiel, W., and Rosenbaum, J. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 35565–35569). This effect required thrombin catalytic activity, as shown by its abolition with hirudin. Although the thrombin effect could be mimicked by agonists of both protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1 and PAR-4, it was largely blocked by a PAR-1 blocking antibody. Transactivation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor has been reported as a common event in thrombin signaling. However, thrombin did not detectably transactivate the EGF receptor in liver myofibroblasts, and blocking the EGF receptor did not affect TFPI-2 induction. On the other hand, thrombin increased the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA via a MAPK-dependent pathway, and a specific COX-2 inhibitor abolished the effect of thrombin on TFPI-2 expression. Thus, thrombin, through PAR-1 signaling, up-regulates the synthesis of TFPI-2 via a MAPK/COX-2-dependent pathway. The up-regulation of TFPI-2 expression by thrombin could in turn down-regulate thrombin generation and contribute to limit blood coagulation.

The up-regulation of TFPI-2 expression by thrombin could in turn down-regulate thrombin generation and contribute to limit blood coagulation. The serine proteinase thrombin is a key factor in hemostasis as it converts fibrinogen to fibrin thus leading to clot formation. Besides this hemostatic function, thrombin is also known to elicit many cellular signals most of which originate from the interaction of thrombin with specific cellular receptors, the so-called protease-activated receptors (PAR), 1The abbreviations used are: PARprotease-activated receptorsTFPI-2tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2COX-2cyclooxygenase-2MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseEGFepidermal growth factorPBSphosphate-buffered salineGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseECMextracellular matrixRTreverse transcriptaseMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. that belong to the G protein-coupled receptor family. Thrombin can activate PAR-1, PAR-3, and PAR-4 (1Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11023-11027Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Binding is followed by cleavage of the amino terminus of the receptor. This will unmask a new amino terminus that behaves as a tethered ligand inducing receptor activation and downstream signalization. PAR-1 and PAR-4 appear to be the major signaling receptors, with PAR-3 being used as a co-factor for PAR-4 activation (2Nakanishi-Matsui M. Zheng Y. Sulciner D. Weiss E. Ludeman M. Coughlin S. Nature. 2000; 404: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Many cellular functions such as migration, mitogenesis, and cytokine secretion are controlled by thrombin. These effects are mediated through several transduction pathways such as those of Ras/MAPK (3Mallat A. Gallois C. Tao J. Habib A. Maclouf J. Mavier P. Préaux A.M. Lotersztajn S. J. Biol.

The functional relevance of these pathways could be shown by using inhibitors. Thus, blocking the Ras/MAPK pathway inhibited mitogenesis (9Molloy C.J. Pawlowski J.E. Taylor D.S. Turner C.E. Weber H.

The role of COX-2 was also shown as COX-2 inhibitors increase the thrombin mitogenic effect by blocking the production of prostaglandins that inhibit proliferation through enhancement of cAMP synthesis (3Mallat A.

Finally, like other GPCR agonists, thrombin has been shown in many instances to transactivate the EGF receptor (11Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A.

The events leading to thrombin generation are very well known. The complex formed by tissue factor and factor VIIa activates factor X. Factor Xa together with factor Va then converts prothrombin to thrombin. The catalytic activity of the tissue factor-factor VIIa complex is subject to inhibition by two related molecules, the tissue factor pathway inhibitors-1 and -2. Both TFPIs contain three tandemly arranged Kunitz-type domains. Besides the tissue factor-factor VIIa complex, TFPI-2 also inhibits trypsin, plasmin, and kallikrein but not thrombin (14Petersen L.C. Sprecher C.A. Foster D.C. Blumberg H. Hamamoto T. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). TFPI-2 exists as three isoforms of 27, 31, and 33 kDa that are synthetic products of a single gene and arise from differential glycosylation. TFPI-2 is most abundant in placenta. It is also expressed in several adult tissues, including the liver (15Miyagi Y. Koshikawa N. Yasumitsu H. Miyagi E. Hirahara F. Aoki I. Misugi K. Umeda M. Miyazaki K. J. Biochem.

PD98059 and AG1478 were from Calbiochem. Purified human thrombin (1000 NIH units/mg, T4393) and all other chemicals were from Sigma. Cell Culture—Human hepatic myofibroblasts were obtained from explants of non-tumoral liver resected during partial hepatectomy and characterized as described previously (18Win K. Charlotte F. Mallat A. Cherqui D. Martin N. Mavier P. Préaux A.M. Dhumeaux D. Rosenbaum J. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 19Blazejewski S. Préaux A.M. Mallat A. Brochériou I. Mavier P. Dhumeaux D. Hartmann D. Schuppan D. Rosenbaum J. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 788-797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Myofibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, 5% pooled human AB serum, and 5 ng/ml recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF). When looking at TFPI-2 regulation by thrombin, cells were seeded in 35-mm dishes at an initial density of 9000/cm2 in complete medium. When confluent, they were washed and left in serum and EGF-free Waymouth medium for 3 days. Thrombin was then added in fresh Waymouth medium. Cells from five different donors were used in these experiments. ECV 304 cells are derived from a human bladder carcinoma. They were grown in Medium 199. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot—At the designated time points, total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy minikit. For Northern blot, 2 μg of RNAs were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide in MOPS buffer. Running buffer and gel contained 0.2 m formaldehyde. The RNAs were transferred onto a Hybond N+ membrane by downward capillary transfer in running buffer. Examination of the stained membrane under UV light was used to confirm the quality of loading and transfer. The probes used were the full-length human TFPI-2 cDNA (16Sprecher C.A. Kisiel W. Mathewes S. Foster D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3353-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), a fragment of the human TFPI-1 cDNA (a gift from P. van der Logt, Leiden, Netherlands), and a fragment of the human COX-2 cDNA (a gift from A. Dannenberg, New York). Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming using the Ready-to-Go kit. Hybridization was performed using the Ultrahyb solution. The blots were washed in stringent conditions (0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C). The blots were further rehybridized with a probe to human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, a gift from A. Pawlak, Créteil, France). Bands were quantified after image acquisition on a Macintosh computer (Apple Computers, Les Ulis, France) by using the Kodak 1D Image Analysis software (Eastman Kodak Co.). Results are expressed as TFPI-2/GAPDH ratios and normalized according to the control value, set at 1. RT-PCR—For RT-PCR, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus. An aliquot was amplified by PCR with Qiagen Hot-start Taq polymerase, using the following primers that were described previously (20Shimizu S. Gabazza E.C. Hayashi T. Ido M. Adachi Y. Suzuki K. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L503-L510PubMed Google Scholar, 21Miyata S. Koshikawa N. Yasumitsu H. Miyazaki K. J. Biol.

PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation for 5 min at 94 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C 30 s/55 °C (PAR-1, -3, and -4) or 60 °C (PAR-2)/30 s, 72 °C/45 s. The sizes of the amplified products are 592, 358, 513, and 542 for PAR 1–4, respectively. Negative control was performed for each reaction and included the omission of the RT step or the omission of cDNA in the PCR mix. Western Blot for TFPI-2—TFPI-2 was measured in extracellular matrix (ECM) extracts as described previously (17Neaud V. Hisaka T. Monvoisin A. Bedin C. Balabaud C. Foster D.C. Desmoulière A. Kisiel W. Rosenbaum J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35565-35569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To prepare ECM extracts for Western blotting, cells were grown to confluence, washed twice with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and incubated for 24 h in the same medium. The ECM was prepared as described by Rao et al. (22Rao C.N. Reddy P. Liu Y. O'Toole E. Reeder D. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. Woodley D.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 82-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed 3 times with PBS and lysed with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Cellular DNA was quantified as described (23Labarca C. Paigen K. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4553) Google Scholar). The remaining ECM was washed 3 times with PBS and another 3 times with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20. ECM was then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with reducing Laemmli buffer and collected by scraping. ECM extracts normalized for cell DNA were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 15% gels and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by semi-dry transfer (Transblot-SD, Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with 4% skimmed milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-Tween) for 2 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-TFPI-2 IgG (10 μg/ml) (22Rao C.N. Reddy P. Liu Y. O'Toole E. Reeder D. Foster D.C. Kisiel W. Woodley D.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 82-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) in TBS-Tween containing 1% bovine serum albumin and then 1 h at room temperature with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody. Detection was achieved by enhanced chemiluminescence. The signals were quantified with the Kodak 1D Image Analysis software. Preparation of Cell Extracts and Assay of Protein Phosphorylation by Western Blot—For studies of activation of MAPK, Akt, and tyrosine phosphorylation, cells were grown to confluency and serum-starved for 3 days. They were then exposed to various agonists. At the end of the incubation, cell lysates were prepared in the presence of proteases and phosphatases inhibitors as described (24Neaud V. Faouzi S. Guirouilh J. Le Bail B. Balabaud C. Bioulac-Sage P. Rosenbaum J. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 1458-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Proteins were measured with a Bio-Rad assay. Equivalent amounts of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies to phosphotyrosine, phospho-MAPK, phospho-Akt-1, or phospho-EGF receptor. The signals were revealed with a chemiluminescent substrate. The blots were then stripped and rehybridized with an antibody to total MAPK to confirm equal loading. Assay for TFPI-2 Inactivation by Thrombin—The assay was based on the ability of TFPI-2 to inhibit plasmin. Recombinant human TFPI-2 (2 μg) was incubated with 1.5 units of thrombin for 3 h at 37 °C in a total volume of 17 μl. This was followed by the addition of hirudin to neutralize thrombin. Plasmin activity was monitored by using the colorimetric substrate S2251, as described (25Lottenberg R. Christensen U. Jackson C.M. Coleman P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 341-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 26Monvoisin A. Neaud V. De Lédinghen V. Dubuisson L. Balabaud C. Bioulac-Sage P. Desmoulière A. Rosenbaum J. J. Hepatol. 1999; 30: 511-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained S2251 with either purified plasmin alone or in the presence of native or thrombin-treated TFPI-2. Optimal concentrations of reagents were determined in preliminary experiments. All assays were carried out in duplicate. An aliquot of the digestion mixtures was also analyzed by Western blot with a polyclonal anti-TFPI-2 antibody. Northern blot with total RNA showed several transcripts for human TFPI-2. In addition to the 1.8-kb transcript, the previously described 1.2-kb transcript actually resolved into separate 1.1- and 1.3-kb bands, respectively. These two species could not be discriminated enough for separate quantitation on gels. It is likely that they arise through differential polyadenylation (15Miyagi Y. Koshikawa N. Yasumitsu H. Miyagi E. Hirahara F. Aoki I. Misugi K. Umeda M. Miyazaki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 939-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Two higher molecular weight bands were also found in minor amounts. Addition of thrombin to human liver myofibroblasts in serum-free conditions dose-dependently increased the expression of TFPI-2 transcripts (Fig. 1, A and C). The increase could be observed as soon as 3 h following thrombin addition and was maximal after 24 h (Fig. 1, B and D). All transcripts were up-regulated in parallel. Variations in TFPI-2 protein expression were studied by measuring the amount of TFPI-2 deposited into the ECM, by using Western blot (Fig. 1E). When the intensity of the 31-kDa band was measured in four independent experiments conducted in quadruplicate, there was a significant increase as compared with the control (1.85 ± 0.64-fold, p = 0.006, Mann and Whitney test). TFPI-2 is closely related to TFPI-1. We thus also studied TFPI-1 expression and its regulation by thrombin by Northern blot. Our results show first that TFPI-1 is indeed expressed in human liver myofibroblasts and that its expression is also up-regulated by thrombin (Fig. 2). In order to check whether thrombin effects were specific to liver myofibroblasts, we used the human bladder carcinoma cell line ECV 304, known to express TFPI-2 (27Ott I. Miyagi Y. Miyazaki K. Heeb M.J. Mueller B.M. Rao L.V. Ruf W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 874-882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, thrombin also up-regulated TFPI-2 in ECV 304 cells. The kinetics were different, however, since expression peaked at 3 h and was back to control values at 24 h. In addition, although all transcripts were up-regulated, the 1.1/1.3-kb level remained elevated for a longer time. Most thrombin effects are believed to be mediated through protease-activated receptors. We first checked, by using RT-PCR, whether human liver myofibroblasts expressed PARs. As shown in Fig. 4A, these cells expressed the three putative thrombin receptors, PAR-1, PAR-3, and PAR-4, as well as PAR-2, a receptor for trypsin and factor Xa. In order to know whether thrombin actually used these receptors, we incubated the cells with thrombin together with hirudin, which specifically inhibits thrombin catalytic activity. As demonstrated in Fig. 4, B and C, hirudin completely abolished the stimulating effect of thrombin on TFPI-2 mRNA expression. Hirudin by itself had no effect. The PAR-1 agonist peptide SFLLRNPNRKYEPF dose-dependently up-regulated TFPI-2 mRNA expression in myofibroblasts (Fig. 4, D and E). The PAR-4 agonist peptide GYPGQV also increased TFPI-2 mRNA expression at a concentration of 100 μm. In order to discriminate the relevance of each receptor, we took advantage of the existence of an antibody that blocks the cleavage of PAR-1 by thrombin. As shown in Fig. 4F, this antibody markedly reduced thrombin-induced TFPI-2 expression. We then analyzed the transduction pathways involved in the effect of thrombin. Thrombin quickly induced the phosphorylation of both ERK1 and ERK2 (Fig. 5A). Addition of the MEK inhibitor PD98059 to thrombin-stimulated cells completely blocked TFPI-2 induction (Fig. 5, B and C). As observed previously, thrombin rapidly up-regulated the expression of COX-2 mRNA in liver myofibroblasts. The maximal increase was seen 3 h after stimulation, and COX-2 transcripts returned to control values at 24 h (Fig. 6A). Induction by thrombin was prevented by using the MAPKK inhibitor PD98059 (data not shown). In order to know whether COX-2 was involved in thrombin-induced up-regulation of TFPI-2 expression, cells were exposed to thrombin in the absence or in the presence of the specific COX-2 inhibitor NS-398. As shown in Fig. 6, B and C, NS-398 completely abolished the increase in TFPI-2 expression evoked by thrombin. NS-398 had no effect on the induction of COX-2 mRNA expression by thrombin (not shown). The inhibitory effect of NS-398 could be completely reversed by the direct addition of prostaglandin E2 to the cells (Fig. 6B). Several cellular effects of thrombin have been shown to be relayed through the transactivation of the EGF receptor by thrombin. This possibility was first evaluated in our model by investigating the phosphorylation status of the EGF receptor in thrombin-stimulated cells. When cellular extracts were analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, no increase in the phosphorylation of bands co-migrating with the EGF receptor (as detected by EGF treatment) could be seen over a period of 60 min (Fig. 7A, top panel). This result was confirmed by blotting with an antibody specifically recognizing the phosphorylated EGF receptor (Fig. 7A, bottom panel) and by immunoprecipitating tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins followed by blotting with the anti-phospho-EGF receptor antibody (Fig. 7B). In order to exclude any role for the EGF receptor, we treated thrombin-stimulated cells with AG1478, a specific inhibitor of the EGF receptor kinase. This did not modify TFPI-2 expression, although it efficiently blocked EGF-induced receptor autophosphorylation (Fig. 7C). An EGF receptor blocking antibody did not impair the effect of thrombin on TFPI-2 expression (Fig. 7C). These results suggest that transactivation of the EGF receptor is unlikely to explain the results obtained in our model. Although thrombin clearly up-regulates TFPI-2 mRNA and protein expression, the resulting functional effect could be annihilated if TFPI-2 proved to be a substrate for the proteolytic activity of thrombin. This was tested in a functional assay measuring the ability of recombinant TFPI-2 to inhibit plasmin activity toward the colorimetric substrate S2251. As shown in Fig. 8, recombinant TFPI-2 readily inhibited plasmin, and this effect was not decreased by previous treatment with thrombin. Furthermore, when thrombin-treated TFPI-2 was analyzed by Western blot, no difference was found by comparison with native TFPI-2 (not shown). Thrombin generation leads to clot formation. This important homeostatic function is tightly regulated in order to avoid excess clotting. In this article, we demonstrate a new mechanism potentially down-regulating this pathway, i.e. up-regulation by thrombin of the expression of TFPI-2. TFPI-2 inhibits the formation of factor Xa by the tissue factor-factor VIIa complex. This will result in decreased de novo thrombin generation from prothrombin. We found that thrombin increased the expression of TFPI-2 transcripts in human liver myofibroblasts as well as in the unrelated cell line ECV 304. Thrombin also increased the deposition of TFPI-2 in the extracellular matrix, as judged by Western blot. Most but not all thrombin effects are mediated through PAR receptors (28Sower L.E. Payne D.A. Meyers R. Carney D.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In our case, the effect of thrombin appeared secondary to its action on PAR-type receptors since the thrombin effect was blocked by hirudin, which specifically inhibits its catalytic activity. Both PAR-1 and PAR-4 are directly involved in thrombin signalization, whereas PAR-3 seems to act as a co-receptor for PAR-4 (2Nakanishi-Matsui M. Zheng Y. Sulciner D. Weiss E. Ludeman M. Coughlin S. Nature. 2000; 404: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). We found that the effect of thrombin could be mimicked by both PAR-1 and PAR-4 agonistic peptides. In order to know whether PAR-1 and PAR-4 were effectively used by thrombin, we incubated the cells with a PAR-1 blocking antibody. This antibody significantly blocked the thrombin effect suggesting that PAR-1 was indeed involved. However, the inhibition was not complete, which could indicate that PAR-4 also participates in this effect. Analysis of the signaling pathway showed that the thrombin effect on TFPI-2 expression could be blocked by an antagonist of MAPK activation. However, in contradiction with several published studies, thrombin failed to transactivate the EGF receptor in human liver myofibroblasts. This was shown by the lack of detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor following thrombin addition. Furthermore, thrombin-induced up-regulation of TFPI-2 expression was unaffected by the EGF receptor kinase-specific inhibitor AG1478 or by an EGF receptor blocking antibody. Transactivation of the EGF receptor by thrombin appears to be a general finding since it has been observed in many different cell types (11Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar, 12Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), including smooth muscle cells that are closely related to myofibroblasts. It has been shown that EGF receptor transactivation by thrombin involves the metalloproteinase-mediated shedding of heparin-binding EGF from the cell membrane (12Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). By using RT-PCR, we have found that liver myofibroblasts express HB-EGF (data not shown), and expression of the required proteinase, presumably ADAM-12 (30Asakura M. Kitakaze M. Takashima S. Liao Y. Ishikura F. Yoshinaka T. Ohmoto H. Node K. Yoshino K. Ishiguro H. Asanuma H. Sanada S. Matsumura Y. Takeda H. Beppu S. Tada M. Hori M. Higashiyama S. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), has also been demonstrated (31Le Pabic H. Bonnier D. Wewer U.M. Coutand A. Musso O. Baffet G. Clement B. Theret N. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 1056-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Thus, the reason for the lack of EGF receptor transactivation by thrombin in human liver myofibroblasts is unclear. On the other hand, induction of TFPI-2 by thrombin could be blocked by the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398, thus suggesting that prostaglandins were involved. We show indeed that this inhibition could be reverted by adding prostaglandin E2 to the cells. COX-2 has been shown previously (3Mallat A. Gallois C. Tao J. Habib A. Maclouf J. Mavier P. Préaux A.M. Lotersztajn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27300-27305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) to mediate an anti-proliferative pathway of thrombin for liver myofibroblasts and thus appears as a major mediator of thrombin signaling in these cells. Besides its inhibitory effect on the procoagulant function of thrombin, the increased expression of TFPI-2 could also contribute to the fine-tuning of other thrombin functions, such as its role in extracellular matrix remodeling. Indeed, thrombin up-regulates the expression of several matrix metalloproteinases (32Duhamel-Clerin E. Orvain C. Lanza F. Cazenave J.P. Klein-Soyer C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1931-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 33Raza S.L. Nehring L.C. Shapiro S.D. Cornelius L.A. J. Biol.

Puppala A. Rao J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), it could regulate the extent of matrix degradation stimulated by thrombin. Finally, depending on the cellular setting, TFPI-2 has been shown to either promote (17Neaud V. Hisaka T. Monvoisin A. Bedin C. Balabaud C. Foster D.C. Desmoulière A. Kisiel W. Rosenbaum J. J. Biol.

Understanding receptor function, particularly in terms of ligand recognition by calcitonin receptors, may aid in the rational design of calcitonin analogs with increased potency and improved selectivity. To directly identify sites of proximity between calcitonin and its receptor, we carried out photoaffinity labeling studies followed by protein digestion and mapping of the radiolabeled photoconjugated receptor. A fully active salmon calcitonin analog [Arg11,18,Bpa19]sCT, incorporating a photolabile p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine into position 19 of the ligand, has been used to demonstrate spatial proximity between residue 19 of the peptide and the amino-terminal extracellular domain of the receptor. Cyanogen bromide cleavage together with endoproteinase Asp-N digestion indicated that binding was predominantly to the region delimited by receptor residues Cys134 and Met187. Binding to this fragment was supported further by cyanogen bromide-digestion of receptors that were mutated to remove the predicted cleavage site at Met133 (M133A, M133L). Binding within the 54-amino acid fragment was refined further by digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C to the 8-amino acid region corresponding to Cys134–Lys141.

Findlay D.M. Martin T.J. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 1067-1093PubMed Google Scholar). Calcitonin receptors (CTRs), however, are expressed widely in both peripheral and central tissues, and CTs exert a wide range of actions including modulation of ion excretion in the kidney, inhibition of appetite, and gastric acid secretion via both peripheral and central mechanisms as well as affecting embryological implantation and development and sperm function (1Sexton P.M.

CT peptides, derived from different species, fall into three broad classes according to structural and biological similarities: teleost/avian, exemplified by salmon CT (sCT); artiodactyl; and rodent/human. Of these, the teleost/avian class has the highest affinity and efficacy, although the relative potency of CTs varies according to the species of receptor under study (1Sexton P.M. Findlay D.M. Martin T.J. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 1067-1093PubMed Google Scholar, 4Houssami S. Findlay D.M. Brady C.L. Martin T.J. Epand R.M. Moore E.E. Murayama E. Tamura T. Orlowski R.C. Sexton P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 798-809PubMed Google Scholar). As a consequence of its higher potency and in vivo stability, sCT is the most common form of CT used therapeutically. The CTR is a member of the class II subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors, which includes the receptors for peptide hormones such as parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-related protein, secretin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and glucagons (5Sexton P.M. Receptors Channels. 8. 2002: 135-255Google Scholar). These receptors exhibit homology with each other and have a number of common structural features including a large amino-terminal domain that contains at least one site of N-linked glycosylation and 6 conserved cysteines that yield a common pattern of disulfide bonding (6Grauschopf U.

The human CTR has two common splice variants that differ by the absence or presence of a 16-amino acid insert in intracellular domain 1; these receptors have been designated hCTRa and hCTRb by the IUPHAR receptor nomenclature subcommittee (8Poyner D.R. Sexton P.M. Marshall I. Quirion R. Kangawa K. Born W. Fischer J.A. Muff R. Smith D.M. Foord S.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Of these two variants, hCTRa is the most prevalent isoform (8Poyner D.R. Sexton P.M. Marshall I. Quirion R. Kangawa K. Born W. Fischer J.A. Muff R. Smith D.M. Foord S.M. Pharmacol.

Whitmore T. Findlay D.M. Houssami S. Sexton P.M. Moore E.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 246-255PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known about the molecular nature of the interaction between CT and its receptor, with only limited data from NH2-terminal domain exchange chimeras between CTR and either the glucagon receptor (11Stroop S.D. Kuestner R.E. Serwold T.F. Chen L. Moore E.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1050-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 12Stroop S.D. Nakamuta H. Kuestner R.E. Moore E.E. Epand R.M.

J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26469-26472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These have provided preliminary evidence for a prominent role for the NH2 terminus in high affinity ligand binding and for overlap in the mode of interaction between CT with its receptor and the interaction of other class II ligands and their receptors. To provide direct information about the nature of the interface between peptides and their respective receptors, a number of laboratories have adopted a photoaffinity scanning approach that relies on the spatially restricted (within 3.1 Å) cross-linking of photolabile amino acids within peptide ligands and their cognate receptors (14Dorman G. Prestwich G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5661-5673Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). This approach has proved successful in providing constraints on the relative orientation of peptides and receptors for at least four class II peptide hormone receptors (15Adams A.E. Bisello A.

In this study we have developed a photolabile derivative of sCT, substituted with p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (Bpa) at amino acid 19 for photoaffinity labeling of the hCTRa. Salmon CT was chosen as the template molecule because of its wide use clinically and its high affinity and efficacy at all CTRs (1Sexton P.M. Findlay D.M. Martin T.J. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 1067-1093PubMed Google Scholar, 2Pondel M. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 2000; 81: 405-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 3Purdue B.W. Tilakaratne N. Sexton P.M. Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Using this molecule we have identified a short domain in the NH2 terminus of the receptor close to the transmembrane domain, delimited by Cys134 and Lys141, as the site of covalent interaction. The current work provides the first constraint in defining the interface between sCT and its receptor. Cyanogen bromide (CNBr), protein G-agarose beads, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, forskolin, dithiothreitol, and iodoacetamide were purchased from Sigma. Sequencing grade endoproteinases Lys-C and Asp-N, N-glycosidase F, and protease inhibitor mixture tablets were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Salmon CT and all amino acid derivatives were synthesized by Auspep (Parkville, Australia). Na125I(specific activity of 2,200 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Biosciences. 125I-Goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G antibody (specific activity 1,035 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Penicillin G/streptomycin was from Multicell Technologies (Warwick, RI). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, HEPES, Fungizone, and trypsin together with LipofectAMINE reagents and protein molecular mass markers were from Invitrogen. Tissue culture disposables and plasticware were purchased from Falcon (Bedford, MA). 12CA5 mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was purified from hybridoma cells via a Hi-Trap protein G column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lysine residues at positions 11 and 18 in the native sCT sequence were replaced with arginines to render the ligand resistant to enzymatic cleavage by endoproteinase Lys-C; this substitution does not alter activity of the peptide (29D'Santos C.S. Nicholson G.C. Moseley J.M. Evans T. Martin T.J. Kemp B.E. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 1483-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In general, the procedure for analog synthesis was as follows. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis—A 0.2-mmol scale was used with the continuous flow Fmoc-polyamide method and a MilliGen 9050 automated synthesizer as described previously (30Dawson N.F. Macris M. Tan Y.-Y. Summers R.J. Tregear G.T. Wade J.D. J. Peptide Res. 1999; 53: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Fmoc-PAL-PEG-PS resin was used as the solid support to generate a COOH-terminal peptide-amide. Amino acid side chain protection was afforded by tert-butyl esters and ethers for Glu, Ser, Thr, and Tyr, trityl for Asn, Gln, His, and Cys, and 2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl for Arg. Residue 19 was introduced manually via its Fmoc-p-benzoylphenyalanine derivative. All amino acid derivatives were activated in situ with 2-(1H-benzotrazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethylronium hexafluorophosphate/N,N′-diisoethylpropylamine in dimethyl formamide. Each acylation was of 30-min duration, and subsequent Nα-Fmoc deprotection was with 20% piperidine in dimethyl formamide. After synthesis, the peptide was separately cleaved and deprotected by a 3-h treatment with 95% trifluoroacetic acid, 3% anisole, 1% triethylsilane, 1% phenol (v/v/v/w) at room temperature. The crude cleaved peptide was precipitated from ice-cold ether and freeze dried. Folding and Oxidation—The crude S-reduced peptide was treated with 20% aqueous dimethyl sulfoxide in 5% aqueous acetic acid (31Tam J.P. Wu C.-R. Liu W. Zhang J.-W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 6657-6662Crossref Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Oxidation was monitored by analytical reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a Vydac C18 column (Hesperia) using a gradient of CH3CN in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid for 21 h. The reaction was stopped by further acidification with neat trifluoroacetic acid. Peptide purification was by preparative reversed phase HPLC with a Vydac C18 column. Characterization—Peptide purity was confirmed by analytical reversed phase HPLC and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry using a Bruker Biflex instrument (Bremen, Germany) in the linear mode at 19.5 kV. For peptide 1–32, calculated: MH+ 3,627.0; found: 3,628.2. Peptide quantitation was by amino acid analysis of a 24-h acid hydrolysate. Radiolabeled sCT and [Bpa19]sCT (specific activity ∼700 Ci/mmol) were prepared by the chloramine-T method as described previously (32Nicholson G.C. Moseley J.M. Sexton P.M. Mendelsohn F.A.O. Martin T.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The iodinated peptides were purified using silica QUSO G32 (North America Silica Co.), washed twice with H2O, and eluted with 20% acetone and 1% acetic acid. cDNA of the hCTRa isoform was excised from the pZEM228cc expression vector (10Kuestner R.E. Elrod R.D. Grant F.J. Hagen F.S. Kuijper J.L. Matthewes S.L. O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Stroop S.D. Thompson D.L. Whitmore T. Findlay D.M. Houssami S. Sexton P.M. Moore E.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 246-255PubMed Google Scholar) using the restriction enzymes HindIII and BamHI and subcloned into the multicloning site of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1zeo+ (Invitrogen). The receptor was mutated to introduce a unique AgeI restriction site at amino acid 23, immediately following the predicted signal peptide cleavage site, using site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene). To create NH2-terminal double epitope tags, complementary oligonucleotides that contained two HA epitope peptide sequences flanked by AgeI restriction sites, 5′-GCTGCTGCACCGGTCCCATATGATGTACCAGATTATGCACCAT ATGATGTACCAGATTATGCCACCGGTGCTGCTGCT-3′ and 5′-AGCAGCAGCACC GGTGGCATAATCTGGTACATCATATGGTGCATAATCTGGTACATCATATGGGACCGGTGCAGCAGC-3′, were annealed by heating at 95 °C, then gradually cooled and digested with AgeI restriction enzyme. The AgeI-digested double-stranded oligonucleotides were purified and ligated into AgeI-digested, mutated pCDNA3.1zeo+:hCTRa to generate the “wild-type HA-hCTRa” construct. At each step, the sequence integrity of the constructs was verified using PCR dideoxynucleotide chain termination sequencing. The following point mutations were introduced, by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis, into wild-type HA-hCTRa: L90M, V108M, V117M, M133A, M133L, C134A, N135A, A136V, F137A, T138A, P139A, E140A, K141A, M346L, and M367L. Selected clones were chosen for plasmid isolation (Qiagen; La Jolla, CA), and the presence of mutations was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing (Australian Genome Research Facility, Parkville, Australia). COS-7 cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, HEPES, and Fungizone at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. For radioligand receptor binding assay and analysis of cell surface receptor expression, COS-7 cells were seeded into 24-well plates. For cross-linking studies, COS-7 cells were grown in 6-well plates for small scale, and in 60-cm2 dishes or 140-cm2 dishes for large scale experiments. Once the cell monolayers were at 95% confluence, cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE using 100 ng, 500 ng, 3 μg, and 7 μg of plasmid DNA in 24-well plates, 6-well plates, 60-cm2 and 140-cm2 dishes, respectively according to the manufacturer's protocol. All transient transfections were performed with either wild-type or mutant HA-hCTRa. Transiently transfected COS-7 cells were grown to confluence in 24-well plates. The cells were incubated with either ∼90 pm125I-sCT or [125I-Bpa19]sCT in binding buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.1% BSA) in the absence (total binding) or presence of varying concentrations of unlabeled peptides. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and subsequently washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 1 m NaOH. The entire cell lysate was counted in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences γ-irradiation counter to determine the bound radioactivity. Intracellular cAMP assay was performed in 384-well plates using the Alpha Screen cAMP kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In brief, transiently transfected COS-7 cells in 60-cm2 dishes were harvested, counted, and resuspended into stimulation buffer (phenol red free medium, 0.1% BSA, 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) and preincubated at 37 °C for ∼20 min. Cells (10,000 cells/well) were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the absence and presence of increasing concentration of agonists, either sCT or [Bpa19]sCT. After incubation, anti-cAMP acceptor beads that were prepared in lysis buffer (5 mm HEPES, 0.3% Tween 20, 0.1% BSA) were added to all wells and incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. The detection mix of biotinylated cAMP/streptavidin donor beads, which was preincubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature, was then added to all wells. The assay plate was incubated overnight at room temperature before reading on a Fusion plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For each experiment, forskolin and cAMP dose-response curves were performed in parallel to allow translation of the α-screen signal to either cAMP or a percent of the maximum forskolin response. COS-7 cells transiently expressing wild-type or mutated receptors were incubated for 1 h in darkness with binding buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.1% BSA) containing ∼900 pm [125IBpa19]sCT/well in the presence (nonspecific binding) or absence (total binding) of 10-7m [Bpa19]sCT. Cells were washed twice with cold 1 × phosphate-buffered saline to remove unbound ligand and then irradiated at a distance of ∼ 5 cm with a 365-nm UV lamp on ice for 30 min. Lysis buffer (0.1 m Tris, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.3) was then added, and the cells were scraped free of the culture plates and centrifuged at 1,800 × g for 10 min. To remove potential contamination of signal arising from carry forward of noncovalently bound radioligand, cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation according to the method of Sengstag et al. (33Sengstag C. Stirling C. Schekman R. Rine J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For this, 2 μg of anti-HA antibody was incubated with each sample to precipitate the [125I-Bpa19]sCT·HA-hCTRa complex, with complexes subsequently isolated using protein G-Sepharose beads. For samples not subjected to enzymatic or chemical cleavage, the complexes were eluted directly from the beads using 1 × “reduced” SDS-sample buffer and the eluted proteins were immediately electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE. When necessary, the samples were reduced with 0.5% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, followed by alkylation with 100 mm iodoacetamide for 25 min at room temperature in the dark to break the disulfide bonds irreversibly. After immunoprecipitation, the ligand-receptor conjugates were subjected to enzymatic or chemical cleavage. For Endo-F deglycosylation, the bead samples were resuspended in 0.15 m Tris, pH 8.8, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol containing 1 unit of N-glycosidase F. For endoproteinase Asp-N digestion, samples were incubated in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, containing 0.04 μg/μl Asp-N enzyme. For endoproteinase Lys-C digestion, samples were resuspended in 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5, containing 0.1 μg/μl Lys-C enzyme. All enzyme-treated samples were incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. For CNBr cleavage, samples were incubated in 100 μl of 70% trifluoroacetic acid with 10 mg/ml CNBr for 24 h at room temperature, in darkness and under nitrogen. After the incubation period, samples were diluted 5-fold with H2O and dried using a vacuum concentrator. Samples were then redissolved in 500 μl of H2O and dried again. Radiolabeled samples were assessed using a combination of 10% SDS-PAGE and 16.5% SDS-Tricine or 10–20% SDS-Tricine (for low molecular mass proteins). After electrophoresis, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, destained, dried, and exposed to phosphorimaging screens (Fuji-Bas; Tokyo, Japan) for 1–5 days to identify radiolabeled fragments. The relative molecular mass (Mr) of the radiolabeled band was determined, by interpolation, on a plot of the mobility of protein standards versus the log values of their apparent molecular mass. Independent monitoring of the cell surface expression of wild-type and mutated HA-hCTRa, in intact COS-7 cells, was performed using the 12CA5 anti-HA antibody as described (34Lee C. Gardella T.J. Abou-Samra A.B. Nussbaum S.R. Segre G.V. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Juppner H. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1488-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Transfected COS-7 cells were rinsed twice with binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1% BSA); cells were then incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with binding buffer alone, for nonspecific binding, and binding buffer containing HA-antibody (4 μg/well in 24-well plates) for total binding. Cells were rinsed twice and incubated further with 125I-goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G antibody for 3 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed with 1 m NaOH. The whole cell lysate was counted in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences γ-irradiation counter to determine the bound radioactivity. The specific binding of antibody to each mutant was calculated by subtracting the nonspecifically bound radioactivity from total binding. All experiments were repeated independently at least three times, unless otherwise indicated. The binding curves and cAMP dose-response data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Data were analyzed using nonlinear regression with the Prism Software package (Graph-Pad Software, Inc., San Diego). Values in the tables are presented as mean ± S.E., unless otherwise indicated. Pharmacological Characterization of [Bpa19]sCT—A photoactive analog of sCT, substituted with Bpa at position 19 [Bpa19]sCT was synthesized as a photoaffinity probe of the CTR. Evaluation of the interaction of this analog with the HA-hCTRa transiently transfected into COS-7 cells revealed similar affinity ([Bpa19]sCT, IC50 = 2.94 ± 0.46 nm versus sCT, IC50 = 2.07 ± 0.32 nm, n = 3) and efficacy (EC50 = 33.79 ± 16.81 pm versus 8.21 ± 3.84 pm, respectively, n = 3) to native sCT (Fig. 1, A and B). [125I-Bpa19]sCT also displayed similar affinity to the unlabeled peptide (IC50 = 3.56 ± 0.75 nm for sCT and 3.21 ± 0.34 nm for [Bpa19]sCT, n = 3, Fig. 1C). Therefore, this analog was suitable for photoaffinity labeling of the receptor and assessment of sites of proximity between residue 19 of the peptide and the receptor. Photoaffinity Cross-linking of hCTRa with [125I-Bpa19]sCT— Cross-linking of [125I-Bpa19]sCT to intact COS-7 cells transiently expressing the HA-hCTRa revealed a single radiolabeled band of Mr ∼72,000, and this band was shifted to Mr ∼51,000 after treatment of the ligand-receptor complex with Endo-F to remove N-linked carbohydrate on the receptor NH2 terminus (Fig. 2). These bands are receptor-specific because they were not observed in the nontransfected cells and were completely inhibited by coincubation with excess unlabeled sCT (10-7m) (Fig. 2). The receptor mass and level of glycosylation are consistent with the expected mass of the receptor and previously characterized level of receptor glycosylation (35Quiza M. Dowton M. Perry K.J. Sexton P.M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 530-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The cross-linked receptor-[125I-Bpa19]sCT conjugate was then subjected to a series of chemical and enzymatic cleavages to identify the site of covalent contact between the ligand and receptor. The photolabeled HA-hCTRa was digested with CNBr, which cleaves at the COOH terminus of methionine residues, followed by resolution on an SDS-Tricine gel and autoradiography. One specifically labeled band of Mr ∼9,300 was identified. Sequential digestion with Endo-F followed by CNBr did not alter the mobility of the Mr 9,000 fragment (Fig. 3). Possible candidate receptor fragments for this band included Lys23–Met48 (Mr ∼4,800 including the HA tag), Cys134–Met187 (Mr ∼6,000), Ile197–Met229 (Mr ∼4,000), Ala307–Met327 (Mr ∼2,500), and Ile347–Met367 (Mr ∼2,500) (Fig. 4), given the molecular mass of the radiolabeled ligand (3.8 kDa).Fig. 4Schematic diagram of the amino acid sequence of HA-hCTRa, including the predicted sites for CNBr digestion. Theoretically, CNBr digestion of the intact receptor, which cleaves at the COOH terminus of methionine residues (black circles), generates 16 fragments, 2 of which contain consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation (Y). The molecular mass of each CNBr-digested fragment is shown. The site of insertion of the double HA tag is also illustrated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Immunoprecipitation of the [125I-Bpa19]sCT·HA-hCTRa complex after cleavage with CNBr did not precipitate a radioactive band, indicating that the far NH2-terminal end of the receptor was not a site of cross-linking (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2033757574,"Mice rendered null for α-dystrobrevin, a component of the dystrophin complex, have muscular dystrophy, despite the fact that the sarcolemma remains relatively intact (Grady, R. M., Grange, R. W., Lau, K. S., Maimone, M. M., Nichol, M. C., Stull, J. T., and Sanes, J. R. (1999) Nat. Cell Biol. 1, 215-220) Thus, α-dystrobrevin may serve a signaling function that is important for the maintenance of muscle integrity. We have identified a new dystrobrevin-associated protein, DAMAGE, that may play a signaling role in brain, muscle, and peripheral nerve. In humans, DAMAGE is encoded by an intronless gene located at chromosome Xq13.1, a locus that contains genes involved in mental retardation. DAMAGE associates directly with α-dystrobrevin, as shown by yeast two-hybrid, and co-immunoprecipitates with the dystrobrevin-syntrophin complex from brain. This co-immunoprecipitation is dependent on the presence of α-dystrobrevin but not β-dystrobrevin. The DAMAGE protein contains a potential nuclear localization signal, 30 12-amino acid repeats, and two MAGE homology domains. The domain structure of DAMAGE is similar to that of NRAGE, a MAGE protein that mediates p75 neurotrophin receptor signaling and neuronal apoptosis (Salehi, A. H., Roux, P. P., Kubu, C. J., Zeindler, C., Bhakar, A., Tannis, L. L., Verdi, J. M., and Barker, P. A. (2000) Neuron 27, 279-288). DAMAGE is highly expressed in brain and is present in the cell bodies and dendrites of hippocampal and Purkinje neurons. In skeletal muscle, DAMAGE is at the postsynaptic membrane and is associated with a subset of myonuclei. DAMAGE is also expressed in peripheral nerve, where it localizes along with other members of the dystrophin complex to the perineurium and myelin. These results expand the role of dystrobrevin and the dystrophin complex in membrane signaling and disease. Mice rendered null for α-dystrobrevin, a component of the dystrophin complex, have muscular dystrophy, despite the fact that the sarcolemma remains relatively intact (Grady, R. M., Grange, R. W., Lau, K. S., Maimone, M. M., Nichol, M. C., Stull, J. T., and Sanes, J. R. (1999) Nat. Cell Biol. 1, 215-220) Thus, α-dystrobrevin may serve a signaling function that is important for the maintenance of muscle integrity. We have identified a new dystrobrevin-associated protein, DAMAGE, that may play a signaling role in brain, muscle, and peripheral nerve. In humans, DAMAGE is encoded by an intronless gene located at chromosome Xq13.1, a locus that contains genes involved in mental retardation. DAMAGE associates directly with α-dystrobrevin, as shown by yeast two-hybrid, and co-immunoprecipitates with the dystrobrevin-syntrophin complex from brain. This co-immunoprecipitation is dependent on the presence of α-dystrobrevin but not β-dystrobrevin. The DAMAGE protein contains a potential nuclear localization signal, 30 12-amino acid repeats, and two MAGE homology domains. The domain structure of DAMAGE is similar to that of NRAGE, a MAGE protein that mediates p75 neurotrophin receptor signaling and neuronal apoptosis (Salehi, A. H., Roux, P. P., Kubu, C. J., Zeindler, C., Bhakar, A., Tannis, L. L., Verdi, J. M., and Barker, P. A. (2000) Neuron 27, 279-288). DAMAGE is highly expressed in brain and is present in the cell bodies and dendrites of hippocampal and Purkinje neurons. In skeletal muscle, DAMAGE is at the postsynaptic membrane and is associated with a subset of myonuclei. DAMAGE is also expressed in peripheral nerve, where it localizes along with other members of the dystrophin complex to the perineurium and myelin. These results expand the role of dystrobrevin and the dystrophin complex in membrane signaling and disease. The dystrophin glycoprotein complex links the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix in skeletal muscle. In addition, recent studies (1Adams M.E. Mueller H.A. Froehner S.C. J.

Thus, the dystrophin complex functions as both a structural link to the extracellular matrix and as a scaffold that concentrates and stabilizes functionally inter-related signaling proteins at the muscle cell membrane. Part of the signaling function of the dystrophin complex may be mediated by the dystrobrevins. The role of the dystrobrevins in signaling is not fully understood; however, targeted disruption of the α-dystrobrevin gene in mice results in muscle pathology without the membrane fragility characteristic of dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy (8Grady R.M. Grange R.W. Lau K.S. Maimone M.M. Nichol M.C. Stull J.T. Sanes J.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that α-dystrobrevin is important for muscle function but in a non-structural way. Dystrobrevin has no enzymatic activity of its own; therefore, the involvement of dystrobrevin in signaling pathways is dependent on its interaction with other proteins. The dystrobrevins are transcribed from two separate genes, designated α and β, that share sequence homology with the C terminus of dystrophin and are composed of several protein interaction domains. These include two EF hands, a zinc binding domain (ZZ), two syntrophin-binding sites, a pair of coiled-coil domains that mediate the interaction of dystrobrevin with dystrophin/utrophin (9Sadoulet-Puccio H.M.

Whether syncoilin, desmuslin, or dysbindin contributes to the signaling function of dystrobrevin and the dystrophin complex remains to be seen. In an effort to identify new α-dystrobrevin-interacting proteins, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a mouse cDNA library. By using this approach, we identified an X-chromosome-encoded protein that contains two MAGE homology domains (MHD) 1The abbreviations used are: MHDs, MAGE homology domains; UTR, untranslated region; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NLS, nuclear localization sequence; NTR, neurotrophin receptor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. and multiple 12-amino acid repeats, which we have named DAMAGE (dystrobrevin-associated MAGE protein). The presence of this protein in neurons, at the neuromuscular junction, in perinuclear structures in skeletal muscle, and in myelin and perineurium of peripheral nerve expands the possible role of α-dystrobrevin and the dystrophin complex in membrane signaling and disease. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The nucleic acid sequence encoding mouse α-dystrobrevin-3 was subcloned into the pPC86BD yeast two-hybrid vector (Invitrogen) by using standard methods. This bait plasmid when transfected into the Y190 yeast strain caused no autoactivation of the histidine and β-galactosidase reporter genes. Library screens were performed by sequential transfection of a mouse brain cDNA library in the pACT2 vector (Clontech), on leu-/trp-/his- plates containing 10 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. The prey plasmid was isolated from positive clones by standard methods, and the clones were sequenced to determine their identities. Each positive clone was tested for specificity of interaction by retransformation into the Y190 yeast strain alone, with the empty bait vector, or with the bait vector containing the PDZ domain of spinophilin, and was tested for growth on leu-/trp-/his- plates and for β-galactosidase activity. The clones were also tested in the more stringent CG1945 yeast strain to confirm the interaction. Clones that passed these tests were considered “positive” and were characterized further. Isolation of Full-length DAMAGE cDNA Clones—The DNA sequence of the longest yeast clone obtained was used to search the NCBI data base using the BLAST search program. Mouse clone 4943 (Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources at the National Institute of Infections Diseases, Tokyo, Japan) was identified, sequenced using standard methods, and found to contain a full-length mouse DAMAGE sequence including a small portion of 5′-UTR. This clone was generously provided by Katsuyuki Hashimoto (Division of Genetic Resources, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan). Antibodies—Antibodies to pan-syntrophin (1351), pan-dystrobrevin (433) and (308), dystrophin, and α-syntrophin were described previously (14Blake D.J. Nawrotzki R. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Davies K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7802-7810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 20Peters M.F. Adams M.E. Froehner S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). A pan-dystrobrevin monoclonal antibody, Db-23 (Transduction Laboratories), is commercially available. Antibodies to DAMAGE were raised against keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptides with the sequences SLVSQNSRRRRGGRANARR (SLVS), RVARPFRRPLFAEVAPELD (RVARP), and EDEANRAEAGRRPLIVRNLR (EDEAN) that correspond to amino acids 2-20, 672-690, and 890-918, respectively, of the mouse DAMAGE sequence. The conjugated peptides were injected into New Zealand White rabbits on a boost and bleed schedule that followed established protocols (Covance Immunoresearch). Immune serum was affinity-purified on columns containing the immunizing peptide. Immunoprecipitations, Immunohistochemistry, and Immunoblots—Whole tissue samples were prepared in 20 volumes of reducing SDS gel sample buffer in a Dounce homogenizer and boiled for 2 min. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g before separation of proteins by SDS-PAGE. Dystrophin protein complexes were immunoprecipitated from mouse brain as described previously (20Peters M.F. Adams M.E. Froehner S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 unstripped mouse brains (PelFreeze) were homogenized in 50 ml of HB (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 400 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.02% sodium azide) in a Waring blender. The insoluble fraction was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g and homogenized in 50 ml of HB using a Vertishear homogenizer. This fraction was centrifuged again at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was homogenized in HB containing 1% Triton X-100. The detergent-insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 55,000 × g, and the final supernatant was divided into appropriate volumes. Immunoprecipitations were performed using 10 μg of antibody or control IgG. The immunocomplexes were isolated with protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) and were washed twice in HB, 1% Triton X-100, twice in HB, 0.1% Triton X-100, and once with HB containing protease inhibitors. The immune complexes were then boiled in reducing sample buffer and loaded onto 9% polyacrylamide gels and separated by SDS-PAGE. Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Immobilon nylon membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked in TBST containing 3% non-fat dry milk overnight at 4 °C. Antigen detection was performed by overlaying blots with the appropriate antibody diluted to a final IgG concentration of 30 nm. Blots were then washed and incubated with either donkey anti-rabbit IgG or donkey anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted 1:8,000. Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) using Super Signal West Pico ECL substrate (Pierce) and an AlphaInnotech gel documentation system (AlphaInnotech Corp.). For brain immunohistochemistry, C57 mice were sacrificed, and the brain was removed and grossly dissected into 2-5-mm2 chunks that contained the hippocampus or cerebellum. These were incubated in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS with 10% sucrose for 20 min and then in 25% sucrose overnight at 4 °C. The tissue was then covered with OCT, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and cryosectioned at 20 μm. For muscle and nerve immunohistochemistry, C57, mdx, and mice rendered null for α-dystrobrevin-1, -2, and -3 by targeted disruption of exon 3 of the α-dystrobrevin gene (αDb-/-) were sacrificed, and the quadriceps and soleus/gastrocnemius muscles were rapidly removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane, and cryosectioned at 10 μm. Cryostat sections were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin, 1% fish gelatin, and 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, and labeled with primary antibody at a concentration of 30 nm. The sections were then washed in PBS and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa 568 diluted 1:500 or goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa 488 diluted 1:500 (Molecular Probes), washed in PBS, and stained with Hoechst 33258. Labeled sections were viewed using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 equipped with a Zeiss Axiocam and Axiovision software or with a Leica TCS confocal microscope. Images were imported into Adobe PhotoShop for final cropping and adjustment of brightness and contrast. Northern Blots—A mouse multiple tissue Northern blot purchased from Sigma was probed with a 32P-labeled full-length DAMAGE cDNA. Hybridization and washing of the blot were done using PerfectHybe plus (Sigma) hybridization solution following the PerfectHybe plus protocol. Isolation of DAMAGE cDNA and Properties of the Encoded Protein—Yeast two-hybrid screening of a mouse brain cDNA library was performed using full-length mouse αDb-3 cDNA. Of 600,000 clones screened, 18 clones interacted with αDb-3 as determined by growth on leu-/trp-/his- plates and generation of β-galactosidase activity. Four of these clones interacted with the Gal4 binding domain alone or with the Gal4 binding domain fused to an unrelated sequence (the spinophilin PDZ domain). Sequencing of the remaining clones revealed that 9 of the 14 clones encoded overlapping parts of a protein that we have named DAMAGE. A full-length clone of mouse DAMAGE, as well as several partial clones, were identified by a search of the GenBank™ EST data base. Similarly, the human DAMAGE orthologue was identified as an uninterrupted genomic sequence on the X chromosome. The human nucleotide sequence of ∼3600 bp is located at Xq13.1 and likely encodes the entire mRNA for DAMAGE (see below). Furthermore, this sequence contains a single, uninterrupted open reading frame of 2874 nucleotides beginning at 208ATG. Thus, DAMAGE appears to be encoded by an intronless gene. Although unusual, this trait is common among genes encoding MHD proteins (25Chomez P. De Backer O. Bertrand M. De Plaen E. Boon T. Lucas S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5544-5551PubMed Google Scholar). Additional mouse, human, and macaque genes encoding DAMAGE were found in GenBank™ under the accession numbers AB046807 (human), AB060233 (macaque), and AL672248.12 nucleotides 4959-8423 (mouse). A mouse sequence (AF319978), called MAGE-E1, is identical to the mouse DAMAGE sequence but is missing 582 nucleotides of 5′-coding sequence (25Chomez P. De Backer O. Bertrand M. De Plaen E. Boon T. Lucas S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5544-5551PubMed Google Scholar). However, several other sequences named MAGE-E1 that encode alternatively spliced isoforms of a different MAGE protein are also present in GenBank™ (accession numbers AB056059, AB040527, AB040528, and AB040529) (49Masuda Y. Sasaki A. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, the name MAGE-E1 is ambiguous. In addition, hepatocellular carcinoma antigen-1 (HCA-1, AF490507) is identical to DAMAGE; however, this name is inadequate to describe a protein that is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system in non-pathological conditions (see below). The confusion generated by current nomenclature has prompted us to refer to the protein identified here as DAMAGE to emphasize its interaction with α-dystrobrevin and to distinguish it from MAGE-E1 cloned by Sasaki and co-workers (49Masuda Y. Sasaki A. Shibuya H. Ueno N. Ikeda K. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A comparison of the human, mouse, and macaque sequences reveals that all three are highly homologous in their C-terminal portions, sharing at least 85% amino acid identity to the human sequence (Fig. 1). However, the mouse protein is divergent in the N-terminal half of the protein, which is primarily composed of repeats. In both macaque and human the repeated sequence is very pronounced and highly conserved. However, the mouse sequence contains only occasional identifiable elements of the repeats (Fig. 1A). This divergence leads to a 73% DNA and 62% amino acid identity between the mouse and human sequences, whereas the human and macaque sequences are 93% identical at both the DNA and protein levels. The homology between mouse and human is very high in the C-terminal half of the protein (85% identical at the amino acid level). The homology is particularly high in the two MHDs suggesting that they are highly conserved across species. Finally, the first 12 amino acids, including a string of 4 arginines, are identical in all three species (Fig. 1A). The sequence of DAMAGE contains several interesting structural features (Fig. 2A). First, DAMAGE has homology to a family of proteins known as the melanoma-associated antigens (MAGE) protein family that has 29 members (25Chomez P. De Backer O. Bertrand M. De Plaen E. Boon T. Lucas S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5544-5551PubMed Google Scholar, 26Barker P.A. Salehi A. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 67: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), all of which contain motifs known as MAGE homology domains (MHDs). DAMAGE is one of only a few proteins that contain two MHDs, located in the C-terminal half of the protein, and is most closely related to two other type II MHD proteins named necdin and MAGE-H1 (26Barker P.A. Salehi A. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 67: 705-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Another interesting feature of DAMAGE is the presence of 30 contiguous 12-amino acid repeats, beginning at residue 62, with the consensus sequence A(S/T)EGPSTSVPPT (Fig. 1B). This consensus sequence does not appear to be related to any other known repeat sequence. The repeats are very prominent in the human sequence but are much less pronounced in the mouse sequence with only small portions of the repeated sequence readily identifiable in the latter (Fig. 1A). The DAMAGE repeat domain may be hyperphosphorylated on serine and threonine as there are 30 sites in mouse and 39 in human that have a consensus sequence recognized by either protein kinase C or casein kinase II. Finally, the repeat region of DAMAGE contains numerous prolines, serines, threonines, and acidic residues. Sequences rich in these amino acids can target the protein for degradation by either the 26 S proteasome or calpain (27Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1960) Google Scholar). A score greater than 5 using the PESTfind program suggests that a sequence is a genuine PEST domain. The human/macaque sequence has 7 potential PEST sequences with scores of 8.46, 18.86, 8.45, 14.57, 6.19, 6.07, and 11.08. The mouse sequence, with its less prominent repeats, has three PEST domains with scores of 10.58, 5.05, and 10.57. Finally, a region with a high concentration of basic amino acids (SRRRRGGRANARR in mouse and SRRRRRRVAKATA in human and macaque) near the N terminus of DAMAGE may be a nuclear localization sequence (NLS). The basic residues in the mouse sequence are interrupted by several amino acids suggesting that the mouse NLS is bipartite, whereas human and macaque have larger monopartite basic NLSs. Neither sequence has a proline or acidic amino acid directly preceding the basic residues, indicative of a classic NLS. However, the sequence upstream of the basic residues is identical among the three species, demonstrating that it is conserved and suggesting that they may be involved in the NLS or some other function of DAMAGE. Although the functionality of these putative NLSs has not been tested, it is intriguing that DAMAGE can be found in nuclear and perinuclear locations (see below). Regions of Interaction between α-Dystrobrevin and DAMAGE—In an effort to define the binding site between α-dystrobrevin and DAMAGE, we tested truncated forms of DAMAGE for interaction with α-dystrobrevin-3 by yeast two-hybrid. The minimal portion of DAMAGE required for the interaction with α-dystrobrevin-3 is a 214-residue sequence that includes the second MHD as well as the C terminus of the protein (Fig. 2A). Shorter segments of DAMAGE were inactive, possibly because α-dystrobrevin interacts with multiple sites within this region or because the smaller segments do not fold properly. α-Dystrobrevin-3 was also truncated to determine the region involved in its association with DAMAGE. The only dispensable sequence was ∼75 residues of the C terminus of the protein downstream of the ZZ domain (Fig. 2B). Thus, the ZZ domain may be involved in the association of the two proteins. However, because a large portion of α-dystrobrevin-3 is required for interaction (286 residues), tertiary structure may play an important role in the association of αDb-3 with DAMAGE. Expression Pattern of DAMAGE mRNA—Analysis of DAMAGE mRNA on a multiple mouse tissue Northern blot revealed a single transcript of ∼3.6 kb (Fig. 3), consistent with a coding region of 2757 bp plus a 3′-UTR of 562 bp and a 5′-UTR estimated to be 300 bp. This is very similar to the expected size of the full-length transcript encoded on the human X chromosome. The transcript is expressed most abundantly in brain but is present at lower levels in all of the other tissues examined including heart, liver, kidney, spleen, testes, lung, thymus, placenta, and skeletal muscle. Characterization of Anti-DAMAGE Antibodies—For studies of DAMAGE association with the dystrophin complex, we produced three antibodies against peptides derived from the mouse DAMAGE sequence. Affinity-purified antibodies were tested to determine whether they react with DAMAGE expressed in CHO cells, and secondarily with a protein of the expected size in brain and sciatic nerve homogenates (Fig. 4). All three of the antibodies recognize a 100-kDa protein in DAMAGE-transfected CHO cells, but the RVARP antibody reacts non-specifically with an unidentified 40-kDa protein present in untransfected cells (Fig. 4A). These experiments also demonstrate that the antibodies recognize smaller bands that are proteolytic fragments of DAMAGE because they are seen only in the transfected cells. In whole lysates from brain, all three antibodies recognize a protein of the size expected for DAMAGE (100 kDa) (Fig. 4B). Unfortunately, the RVARP antibody recognizes both DAMAGE and another protein of higher molecular weight (185 kDa, tentatively identified as periaxin) in peripheral nerve (Fig. 4C). Therefore, the SLVS antibody was used for the studies on peripheral nerve. Association of DAMAGE with the Dystrophin-Dystrobrevin-Syntrophin Complex in Vivo—Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments were performed to determine whether DAMAGE associates with the dystrophin complex in vivo. Brain extracts were used for these experiments because DAMAGE mRNA is most abundant in this tissue. These studies were based, in part, on the knowledge that isoforms of syntrophin are tightly associated with α-dystrobrevin (17Butler M.H. Douville K. Murnane A.A. Kramarcy N.R. Cohen J.B. Sealock R. Froehner S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6213-6218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ahn A.H. Kunkel L.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 19Dwyer T.M. Froehner S.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, proteins associated with α-dystrobrevin should be present in immune complexes isolated with antibodies to syntrophin or α-dystrobrevin. For these experiments, we used pan-specific mAb 1351 that recognizes α-, β1-, and β2-syntrophins (20Peters M.F. Adams M.E. Froehner S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and mAb Db-23 against α-dystrobrevin. As expected, complexes isolated with either of these mAbs contain α-dystrobrevin (Fig. 5A). These protein complexes also contained a band of ∼100 kDa recognized by the DAMAGE anti-peptide (RVARP) antibody. The anti-DAMAGE antibody also detects a lower band in these extracts that is probably a breakdown product of the full-length protein. We also performed the reverse experiment in which anti-DAMAGE was used to isolate protein complexes. Protein complexes isolated with anti-DAMAGE contained α-dystrobrevin (Fig. 5B). In each case, no immunoreactive band was seen in the control lane containing material immunoprecipitated with an unrelated, control antibody. In addition, preincubation of the DAMAGE antibody with a 5-fold excess of the immunizing peptide eliminated detection of the DAMAGE band, whereas incubation with a 5-fold excess of an unrelated peptide had no effect (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that complexes of DAMAGE and α-dystrobrevin exist in vivo. We used mice lacking α-dystrobrevin (αDb-/-) (8Grady R.M. Grange R.W. Lau K.S.

Protein complexes were isolated with the Pan-syntrophin antibody from brain extracts prepared from wild type"
https://openalex.org/W2064973680,"TFII-I is a ubiquitously expressed multifunctional transcription factor with broad biological roles in transcription and signal transduction in a variety of cell types. We and others have shown that TFII-I can interact physically and functionally with Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), a hematopoietic non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase that is critical for B lymphocyte development. Although TFII-I-Btk interactions are impaired in B cells from X-linked immunodeficient mice, the precise molecular determinants governing TFII-I-Btk complex formation remain unknown. To this end, we have conducted a structural analysis of TFII-I-Btk interactions by using a panel of TFII-I mutants. These studies have revealed that a region within the N-terminal 90 amino acids of TFII-I, which includes a putative leucine zipper motif, is primarily responsible for its interaction with Btk. Mutations in the leucine zipper region itself were not sufficient to abrogate binding of TFII-I to Btk, suggesting that regions/residues outside the leucine zipper are responsible for such interactions. Because the first 90 amino acids of TFII-I are required for its dimerization, we propose that Btk tethers TFII-I to the cytoplasm by preventing its dimerization and its subsequent nuclear localization. We further examined the requirement of tyrosine phosphorylation for TFII-I-Btk complex formation. Our data showed that Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation sites in TFII-I are not targeted by Btk, suggesting that multiple kinases can independently target TFII-I via distinct signaling pathways. Our results provide a beginning step toward understanding the functional importance of the TFII-I-Btk pathway in B cell signaling and gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2119178111,"Actin filaments and microtubules are two major cytoskeletal systems involved in wide cellular processes, and the organizations of their filamentous networks are regulated by a large number of associated proteins. Recently, evidence has accumulated for the functional cooperation between the two filament systems via associated proteins. However, little is known about the interactions of the kinesin superfamily proteins, a class of microtubule-based motor proteins, with actin filaments. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a novel kinesin-related protein named DdKin5 from Dictyostelium. DdKin5 consists of an N-terminal conserved motor domain, a central stalk region, and a C-terminal tail domain. The motor domain showed binding to microtubules in an ATP-dependent manner that is characteristic of kinesin-related proteins. We found that the C-terminal tail domain directly interacts with actin filaments and bundles them in vitro. Immunofluorescence studies showed that DdKin5 is specifically enriched at the actin-rich surface protrusions in cells. Overexpression of the DdKin5 protein affected the organization of actin filaments in cells. We propose that a kinesin-related protein, DdKin5, is a novel actin-bundling protein and a potential cross-linker of actin filaments and microtubules associated with specific actin-based structures in Dictyostelium.

Actin filaments and microtubules are two major cytoskeletal systems involved in a wide variety of cellular processes, including intracellular transport, cell division, cell migration, and cellular morphogenesis. These functional multiplicities result from changes in the assembly and organization of filamentous networks that are regulated by a large number of associated proteins, including cross-linking, severing, capping, and motor proteins. The kinesin superfamily is a class of microtubule-based motor proteins defined by a conserved motor domain responsible for ATP hydrolysis and microtubule binding. Since the first identification of kinesin (1Vale R.D. Reese T.S. Sheetz M.P.

The cellular slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum, is a useful model system to study cytoskeletons and motor proteins. It is suitable for biochemical and genetic approaches, including gene disruption and overexpression. Moreover, it shows a wide range of cellular processes, such as binary fission, intracellular transport, endocytosis, and chemotaxis. A number of studies have been made on the actin cytoskeleton and its regulation by associated proteins in Dictyostelium (reviewed in Refs. 4Noegel A.A. Schleicher M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 759-766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 5Lee E. Pang K. Knecht D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1525: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, some KRPs were recently identified as motors associating with membranous structures in Dictyostelium. One of them, K7, was shown to be involved in the development of Dictyostelium cells (6de Hostos E.L. McCaffrey G. Sucgang R. Pierce D.W. Vale R.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2093-2106Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). DdUnc104, the closest relative of Unc104/KIF1 KRPs in Dictyostelium, was purified using an organelle transport assay and shown to participate in membrane transport in cells (7Pollock N. de Hostos E.L. Turck C.W. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recently, evidence has accumulated for the functional cooperation between the two filament systems during various cellular processes (reviewed in Ref. 8Rodriguez O.C. Schaefer A.W. Mandato C.A. Forscher P. Bement W.M. Waterman-Storer C.M. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2003; 5: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). In addition, some KRPs have been shown to interact with actin filaments physically or functionally. In melanophores, pigment granules are transported along both microtubules and actin filaments by a combination of kinesin II, cytoplasmic dynein, and an actin-based motor protein, myosin V (9Tuma M.C.

Moreover, biochemical studies demonstrated the direct interaction between conventional kinesin and myosin V (13Huang J.D. Brady S.T. Richard B.W. Stenolen D. Resau J.H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nature. 1999; 397: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In migrating cells, conventional kinesin is required for focal delivery of a factor that promotes focal adhesion disassembly (14Krylyshkina O. Kaverina I. Kranewitter W. Steffen W. Alonso M. Cross R.A. Small J.V. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In cytokinesis, the proper placement of a cleavage furrow requires interactions between cortical actin filaments and spindle astral microtubules (8Rodriguez O.C. Schaefer A.W. Mandato C.A. Forscher P. Bement W.M. Waterman-Storer C.M. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2003; 5: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The CHO1 isoform of the mitotic kinesin-like protein 1 subfamily, which is required for the completion of cytokinesis, has been shown to interact directly with actin filaments via the middle of the tail (15Kuriyama R. Gustus C. Terada Y. Uetake Y. Matuliene J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 156: 783-790Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, as yet, little is known about the interactions between KRPs and actin filaments. In this study, we describe the identification and characterization of a Dictyostelium KRP designated as DdKin5 (Dictyostelium discoideumkinesin 5). We found that the C-terminal tail domain of DdKin5 directly interacts with actin filaments and bundles them in vitro. The intracellular localization of DdKin5 suggested the association of DdKin5 with actin in vivo. Analyses of Dictyostelium cells overexpressing DdKin5 suggested the involvement of DdKin5 in the organization of actin cytoskeletons. We propose that DdKin5 is a novel actin-bundling protein and a potential cross-linker of actin filaments and microtubules in Dictyostelium. Strains, Culture, Development, and Transformation of Dictyostelium Cells—D. discoideum axenic strain Ax2 (16Watts D.J. Ashworth J.M. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar) was used as the wild-type strain and the parental strain for the gene disruption mutant. Ax2 and mutants cells were cultivated in an HL5 nutrient medium (17Sussman M. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 9-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin either on Petri dishes or in a shaken suspension at 22 °C. For development, cells were seeded on DM agar plates (17Sussman M. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 9-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) covered with Escherichia coli B/r lawns and incubated at 22 °C. Transformation was performed by electroporation according to Howard et al. (18Howard P.K. Ahern K.G. Firtel R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 2613-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Cloning of Ddkin5 cDNAs—Partial genomic DNA sequences encoding a novel KRP (referred as DdKin5) were obtained from the Genome Sequencing Centre Jena 2genome.imb-jena.de/dictyostelium. in the Dictyostelium genome project. Genomic DNA clones carrying the entire Ddkin5 gene were obtained by inverse PCR from genomic DNAs that were digested with EcoT22I or NdeI and circularized with ligase (Fig. 8A, EcoT22I and NdeI fragments). The 3′ end of the DdKin5 gene was confirmed by 3′-rapid amplification of the cDNA end using the total RNA extracted from vegetative Ax2 cells as a template. cDNA clones encoding the full-length DdKin5 protein were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR using the total RNA as a template. Several clones were sequenced for all the PCR products. While this work was being completed, the sequence of the KRP was released independently from dictyBase (GenBank™ accession number AAM09366), confirming the sequence of the Ddkin5 gene and revealing the existence of the gene on chromosome 2. Antibodies—DNA encoding the fragment of DdKin5 (residues 342-582) was amplified by PCR from the Ddkin5 cDNA and cloned into the pET-15b His tag expression vector (Novagen). E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen) cells transformed with the vector were grown at 37 °C to A600 = 0.6, at which point protein expression was induced by the addition of 10 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After further shaking for 13 h at 22 °C, the cells were harvested and resuspended in LB (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Following sonication, lysates were centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was washed twice with LB containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and extracted with an extraction buffer (8 m urea, 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT) at 37 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation, the solubilized extraction was successively dialyzed against LB containing 4 m urea for 1 h, LB containing 2 m urea for 1 h, LB for 1 h, and LB overnight. After centrifugation, the protein was mixed with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C and eluted with LB containing 250 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was dialyzed against PBS and used for immunization of a rabbit to raise antiserum against the protein (Asahi Technoglass). For Western blotting, gels were transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) by electrophoresis. Blots were blocked for 30 min with 5% skim milk (Difco) in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with crude anti-DdKin5 antiserum used at 1:100,000 dilution, a monoclonal anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) antibody 1E4 (Medical & Biological Laboratories) at 1:100,000 dilution, or a monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody DM1A (Sigma) at 1:2000 dilution in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% skim milk and 0.05% Tween 20, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. After washing twice with 3× Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, blots were developed with ECL-Plus reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Microtubule Cosedimentation Assays—DNA encoding the truncated DdKin5 (residues 1-542) was amplified by PCR from Ddkin5 cDNA clones, ligated with the coding sequence of the GFP S65T mutant (19Heim R. Tsien R.Y. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 178-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar) at the 3′ end, and cloned into an extrachromosomal vector pBIG (20Ruppel K.M. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18773-18780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ax2 cells were transformed with the vector, and transformants were selected and maintained at 10 μg/ml G418. Transformed cells were harvested, washed in a 17 mm potassium/sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.3), and resuspended at a density of 8 × 107 cells/ml in an ice-cold microtubule binding buffer (10% sucrose, 30 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 6.8, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT) containing a complete protease inhibitor mixture without EDTA (Roche Applied Science). Suspended cells were lysed by one passage through a nucleopore polycarbonate filter (5 μm pore size, 13-mm diameter; Whatman). Lysates were incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged for 2 min at full speed in a microcentrifuge and for 15 min at 350,000 × g at 4 °C. For microtubule cosedimentation experiments, the supernatant was incubated with 2 mm AMPPNP and 40 μm Taxol in the presence or absence of 0.5 mg/ml Taxol-stabilized microtubules for 30 min at room temperature. After incubation, the mixture was centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 15 min at 25 °C to separate the microtubule pellet and supernatant. For ATP-dependent release experiments, the pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of a release buffer (100 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 6.8, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 40 μm Taxol). The resuspended pellet fraction was divided into two fractions, one of which was supplemented with 10 mm ATP. After 15 min incubation at room temperature, the mixture was recentrifuged at 90,000 × g for 15 min at 25 °C. All supernatant and pellet fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE. They were analyzed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and Western blotting with the anti-GFP antibody as described above. Disruption of the Ddkin5 Gene—A DNA fragment (nucleotide 90-840 in the cDNA) was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA using primers containing restriction enzyme sites for EcoRI and HindIII, followed by digestions with them. Another fragment (nucleotide 1020-1966 in the cDNA) was amplified using primers, one of which contained a site for BamHI, and was digested with BamHI and KpnI. A blasticidin S resistance marker was excised from pUCBsrΔBam (21Adachi H. Hasebe T. Yosinaga K. Ohta T. Sutoh K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1808-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) by BamHI and HindIII digestions. These three fragments were ligated in tandem and cloned into a vector, pUC118. Ax2 cells were transformed with a gene disruption construct that was digested with EcoRI and KpnI to release the vector backbone (Fig. 8A, gene disruption construct). Transformants were selected at 10 μg/ml blasticidin S. Blasticidin S-resistant clones were isolated by spreading onto DM agar plates with E. coli B/r and screened by PCR using primers whose positions are schematically indicated using arrowheads in Fig. 8A. Genomic DNAs used as templates were prepared from cells as previously described (22Barth C. Fraser D.J. Fisher P.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3317-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, 1-2 × 107 cells were washed with water and resuspended in 400 μl of Tris-EDTA (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). They were lysed by freezing at –80 °C for 10 min and thawing at 37 °C for 10 min and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 2 min to precipitate the nuclei. Pellets were suspended in 100 μl of Tris-EDTA containing 10 mm EDTA and 0.1 mg/ml RNase, followed by addition of 0.1% SDS and 0.4 mg/ml proteinase K. After incubation at 65 °C for 1 h, genomic DNAs were recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Positive candidates were confirmed by Western blotting with the anti-DdKin5 antiserum as described above. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—To reduce background labeling in immunofluorescence studies, the anti-DdKin5 antiserum was preadsorbed with fixed Ddkin5-null cells according to Fukui et al. (23Fukui Y. Yumura S. Yumura T. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, 1.5 × 108Ddkin5-null cells were harvested, fixed with methanol at –20 °C for 5 min, and washed three times with PBS. Washed cells were divided into three fractions, one of which was resuspended with 500 μl of the anti-DdKin5 antiserum diluted 1:3000 in PBST. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with agitation and centrifuged to remove fixed cells. After two more repeats of the incubation, the mixture was supplemented with 3% BSA and finally centrifuged at 300,000 × g for 30 min to remove debris. For the immunofluorescence observations of vegetative cells, cells were grown on glass-bottomed dishes (MatTek) in an HL5 medium for 1 h and subsequently fixed in 3% formaldehyde in a 17 mm potassium/sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.3) for 10 min. Other fixatives, such as 3% formaldehyde in PBS, were not used in this study because such higher salt conditions caused cells to show some responses to hyperosmotic stress. 3S. Iwai and K. Sutoh, unpublished observation. Cells were postfixed in 70% ethanol at –20 °C for 5 min and washed three times in PBS. After being blocked with 3% BSA in PBST, cells were incubated with the preadsorbed anti-DdKin5 antiserum for 1 h at room temperature. After being washed in PBS three times, cells were incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:3000 in PBST containing 3% BSA and 2 ng/ml TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed four times in PBS and observed as described previously (24Iwai S. Suyama E. Adachi H. Sutoh K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Chemotaxing cells were fixed as previously described (25Jung G. Remmert K. Wu X. Volosky J.M. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1479-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, cells at the mid-log phase (<4 × 106 cells/ml) grown in suspension were washed with a starvation buffer (17 mm potassium/sodium phosphate, pH 6.3, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2) and resuspended in the buffer at a density of 2-3 × 106 cells/ml. Twenty-five μl of cells was spotted onto ethanol-washed glass coverslips and incubated at 22 °C until the cells started streaming, at which point they were overlaid with thin agarose sheets (23Fukui Y. Yumura S. Yumura T. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and fixed in ethanol containing 1% formaldehyde at –15 °C for 5 min. Staining was performed as described for vegetative cells, except that agarose sheets were peeled off and cells were washed once more before the incubation with the antiserum and that coverslips were finally mounted using 90% glycerol in PBS. Triton-insoluble Cytoskeletons—Cells were harvested, washed with a 17 mm potassium/sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.3), and resuspended at a density of 1.6 × 108 cells/ml in a 2× cytoskeleton buffer (20 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 30 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT) containing a complete protease inhibitor mixture without EDTA (Roche Applied Science). Suspended cells were divided into two fractions, and each was lysed by addition of an equal volume of 1% Triton X-100 containing 10 mm EGTA or 0.2 mm CaCl2 at room temperature. Lysates were agitated and immediately centrifuged for 30 s at full speed in a microcentrifuge. The supernatants were collected, and the pellets were resuspended in an equivalent volume of a 1× cytoskeleton buffer. They were mixed with an equal volume of a 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE. They were analyzed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and Western blotting with the anti-DdKin5 antiserum and the anti-α-tubulin antibody as described above. Expression of Proteins in Dictyostelium—For the expression of GFP-tagged proteins in Dictyostelium cells, DNAs encoding the full-length DdKin5 (residues 1-990) or truncated fragments (residues 1-949, 950-990, or 805-990) were amplified by PCR from Ddkin5 cDNA clones and ligated with the coding sequence of the GFP S65T mutant (19Heim R. Tsien R.Y. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 178-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar) at the 3′ end. GFP and DdKin5 or its fragments were separated by the linker GPGKDP, which had resulted from the cloning procedures. They were cloned into an extrachromosomal vector pBIG (20Ruppel K.M. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18773-18780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to express GFP-tagged proteins under the control of the actin-15 promoter. For the expression of FLAG-tagged proteins, DNAs encoding the full-length DdKin5 and a truncated fragment (residues 342-990) were amplified by PCR and ligated with the FLAG-coding sequence at their 5′ ends. They were cloned into pBIG to express FLAG-tagged proteins under the control of the actin-15 promoter. Ddkin5-null cells were used for transformation with all these vectors. Transformants were selected and maintained at 6 μg/ml G418, except for two of GFP-tagged fragments (residues 950-990 and 805-950) selected at 10 μg/ml G418. Cells were observed as described in the section “Immunofluorescence Microscopy,” except that they were stained with 5 or 10 ng/ml TRITC-conjugated phalloidin for 30 min at 37 °C. For counting the nuclei per cell, cells were adhered onto glass coverslips for 5 min (for cells grown in suspension) or 1 h (for cells grown on a surface) and strongly compressed by thin agarose sheets (23Fukui Y. Yumura S. Yumura T. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). They were fixed with methanol at –15 °C for 5 min and stained with 50 ng/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 30 min at 37 °C. Nuclei in >300 cells grown on a surface or >100 cells grown in suspension were counted for each cell line. Differences between Ax2 and other mutants were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney test. Expression of Proteins in E. coli and Purification—For the expression of the GST-tagged DdKin5 tail domain (GST-T), DNA encoding the DdKin5 tail domain (residues 950-990) amplified as above was cloned into the pGEX-4T-3 GST tag expression vector (Pharmacia). For the expression of the His-tagged DdKin5 tail domain with a coiled-coil (His-ST), DNA encoding the DdKin5 tail domain with the coiled-coil (residues 805-990) amplified as above was cloned into the pET-15b His tag expression vector (Novagen). E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen) cells transformed with these vectors were grown at 37 °C to A600 = 1, at which point the protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After further shaking for 3 h at 22 °C, cells were harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl or NaH2PO4-NaOH, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 5 mm DTT and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Following sonication, lysates were centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min. For the purification of GST-T, the supernatant was mixed with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was precipitated and washed twice with the lysis buffer. The resin was precipitated again, and bound protein was eluted with an elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 16 mm reduced glutathione). For the purification of His-ST, the supernatant was mixed with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was precipitated and washed twice with a lysis buffer containing 50 mm imidazole and 1 mm DTT. The resin was precipitated again, and bound protein was eluted with lysis buffer containing 300 mm imidazole and 1 mm DTT. The eluted proteins were dialyzed against an actin-binding buffer (10 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT) and finally centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min to remove aggregates. The concentrations of purified proteins were determined by Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce) using BSA as a standard. F-actin Cosedimentaion Assays—Actin was extracted from the acetone powder of rabbit skeletal muscle and purified as described previously (26Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 24: 271-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Cosedimentation assays of GST-T with F-actin were performed as previously described (27Jung G. Hammer III, J.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, various concentrations of GST-T (0.5-8 μm) were mixed with 2 μm F-actin in an actin-binding buffer containing 0.2 mg/ml BSA and 10 mm KCl. Otherwise, 4 μm GST-T was mixed with 4 μm F-actin in an actin-binding buffer containing 0.2 mg/ml BSA and various concentrations of KCl (10-300 mm). After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, mixtures were centrifuged at 160,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatants were collected, and the pellets were resuspended in an equal volume of the actin-binding buffer. For cosedimentation assays of His-ST with F-actin at low speed, 5 μm His-ST was mixed with 5 μm G-actin in an actin-binding buffer containing 50 mm KCl. After incubation for 2 h at room temperature, mixtures were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatants were collected, and the pellets were resuspended in an equivalent volume of the actin-binding buffer. All samples were mixed with an equal volume of a 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. They were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue for densitometry. Electron Microscopy—Five μm His-ST was mixed with 5 μm G-actin in an actin-binding buffer containing 50 mm KCl and 50 μm ATP and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The protein mixture was applied to grids and negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate. The samples were observed using a JEM1200EX electron microscope (JEOL) at 80 kV. Identification of DdKin5 as a Kinesin-related Protein—We cloned and determined the full sequence of the Ddkin5 gene from D. discoideum. Fig. 1 shows the deduced amino acid sequence of DdKin5. Sequence analysis showed that the Ddkin5 gene encodes a protein with a molecular mass of 110 kDa that consists of an N-terminal kinesin motor domain, a central stalk region, and a C-terminal tail region. The motor domain of DdKin5 showed the highest degree of homology with members of conventional kinesins, sharing 53% identity with Neurospora kinesin (28Steinberg G. Schliwa M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1605-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and 52% identity with human kinesin heavy chain (29Navone F. Niclas J. Hom-Booher N. Sparks L. Bernstein H.D. McCaffrey G. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1263-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, outside the motor domain, DdKin5 did not show significant homology to conventional kinesins, other KRPs, or any other proteins in the data base. The central stalk region was predicted to contain four α-helical coiled-coil regions (Fig. 1, underlined). Two of them were predicted to contain leucine zippers (Fig. 1, double underlined) corresponding to short coiled-coils (30O'Shera E.K. Rutkowski R. Kim P.S. Science. 1989; 243: 538-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Because the coiled-coil stalk region in the Drosophila kinesin heavy chain is important for the dimerization of the protein (31Huang T.-G. Suhan J. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16502-16507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that these multiple coiled-coils and leucine zippers also facilitate the dimerization of DdKin5. The nonhelical region between putative coiled-coil regions from residues 733 to 780 is rich in asparagine and serine residues. Although the significance of the amino acid clusters often found in Dictyostelium is not well known (32Shaw D.R. Richter H. Giorda R. Ohmachi T. Ennis H.L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 218: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), a serine-rich region was recently found to mediate membrane fusion in Dictyostelium cells (33Brazill D.T. Caprette D.R. Myler H.A. Hatton R.D. Ammann R.R. Lindsey D.F. Brock D.A. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19231-19240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The C-terminal tail region is rich in basic residues"
https://openalex.org/W2067912883,"Cyclooxygenase catalysis by prostaglandin H synthase-1 and -2 (PGHS-1 and -2) requires activation of the normally latent enzyme by peroxide-dependent generation of a free radical at Tyr-385 (PGHS-1 numbering) in the cyclooxygenase active site; the Tyr-385 radical has also been linked to self-inactivation processes that impose an ultimate limit on cyclooxygenase catalysis. Cyclooxygenase activation is more resistant to suppression by cytosolic glutathione peroxidase in PGHS-2 than in PGHS-1. This differential response to peroxide scavenging enzymes provides a basis for the differential catalytic regulation of the two PGHS isoforms observed in vivo. We sought to identify structural differences between the isoforms, which could account for the differential cyclooxygenase activation, and used site-directed mutagenesis of recombinant human PGHS-2 to focus on one heme-vicinity residue that diverges between the two isoforms, Thr-383, and an adjacent residue that is conserved between the isoforms, Asn-382. Substitutions of Thr-383 (histidine in most PGHS-1) with histidine or aspartate decreased cyclooxygenase activation efficiency by about 40%, with little effect on cyclooxygenase specific activity or self-inactivation. Substitutions of Asn-382 with alanine, aspartate, or leucine had little effect on the cyclooxygenase specific activity or activation efficiency but almost doubled the cyclooxygenase catalytic output before self-inactivation. Asn-382 and Thr-383 mutations did not appreciably alter the Km value for arachidonate, the cyclooxygenase product profile, or the Tyr-385 radical spectroscopic characteristics, confirming the structural integrity of the cyclooxygenase site. The side chain structures of Asn-382 and Thr-383 in PGHS-2 thus selectively influence two important aspects of cyclooxygenase catalytic regulation: activation by peroxide and self-inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2073539123,"Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) presenilin 1 (PS1) mutations give enhanced calcium responses upon different stimuli, attenuated capacitative calcium entry, an increased sensitivity of cells to undergo apoptosis, and increased γ-secretase activity. We previously showed that the FAD mutation causing an exon 9 deletion in PS1 results in enhanced basal phospholipase C (PLC) activity (Cedazo-Minguez, A., Popescu, B. O., Ankarcrona, M., Nishimura, T., and Cowburn, R. F. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 36646-36655). To further elucidate the mechanisms by which PS1 interferes with PLC-calcium signaling, we studied the effect of two other FAD PS1 mutants (M146V and L250S) and two dominant negative PS1 mutants (D257A and D385N) on basal and carbachol-stimulated phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis and intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. We found a significant increase in basal PI hydrolysis in PS1 M146V cells but not in PS1 L250S cells. Both PS1 M146V and PS1 L250S cells showed a significant increase in carbachol-induced [Ca2+]i as compared with nontransfected or wild type PS1 transfected cells. The elevated carbachol-induced [Ca2+]i signals were reversed by the PLC inhibitor neomycin, the ryanodine receptor antagonist dantrolene, the general aspartyl protease inhibitor pepstatin A, and the specific γ-secretase inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester. The cells expressing either PS1 D257A or PS1 D385N had attenuated carbachol-stimulated PI hydrolysis and [Ca2+]i responses. In nontransfected or PS1 wild type transfected cells, N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester and pepstatin A also attenuated both carbachol-stimulated PI hydrolysis and [Ca2+]i responses to levels found in PS1 D257A or PS1 D385N dominant negative cells. Our findings suggest that PS1 can regulate PLC activity and that this function is γ-secretase activity-dependent.

Presenilins are multipass membrane proteins that form a high molecular complex with other binding partners (Aph-1, Pen-2, and Nicastrin) so as to execute an intramembraneous proteolytic activity known as γ-secretase cleavage (1De Strooper B. Neuron. 2003; 38: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). The γ-secretase complex cleaves several integral membrane proteins; of particular interest for AD pathogenesis is the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is processed to different peptide fragments (2Selkoe D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1375-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), including β-amyloid (Aβ) and the APP-intracellular domain (AICD). Although Aβ is secreted in the extracellular milieu, the AICD was found to translocate to the nucleus and form a transcriptively active complex with the nuclear adaptor protein Fe65, in a manner similar to the intracellular domain of Notch (3Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). The releases of both Aβ and AICD from the C-terminal fragment of APP are dependent on γ-secretase activity (4Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 5Yu C. Kim S.H. Ikeuchi T. Xu H. Gasparini L. Wang R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol.

Selkoe D. Younkin S. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (2247) Google Scholar). There is a wealth of data showing Aβ to be neurotoxic in various experimental paradigms (7Small D.H. Mok S.S. Bornstein J.C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 595-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Another pathogenic pathway by which mutated PS1 triggers neurodegeneration is the sensitization of cells to undergo death by apoptosis (8Popescu B.O. Ankarcrona M. J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2000; 4: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), although there is as yet no proof to link the proapoptotic effects of mutant PS1 to increased Aβ secretion. Under stress conditions, the cells expressing mutant PS1 show increased caspase-3, caspase-12, and calpain activation (9Kovacs D.M. Mancini R. Henderson J. Na S.J. Schmidt S.D. Kim T.W. Tanzi R.E. J.

Neurovirol. 2002; 8: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Moreover, FAD PS1 mutants were shown to disrupt calcium signaling not only in response to toxic stimuli but also to the physiological signals of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), bradykinin, and glutamate (12Leissring M.A. Paul B.A. Parker I.

The fact that all analyzed FAD PS1 mutations have been found to alter calcium signaling could be of relevance to AD pathogenesis, especially because deregulation of [Ca2+]i is also a constant finding in cells from AD patients and in AD experimental models (14LaFerla F.M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 862-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Increased [Ca2+]i can also result in enhanced Aβ generation (15Querfurth H.W. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4550-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), whereas in turn cells treated with Aβ show increased [Ca2+]i (16Mattson M.P. Cheng B. Davis D. Bryant K. Lieberburg I. Rydel R.E. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 376-389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast secreted APP stabilizes calcium homeostasis (17Guo Q. Robinson N. Mattson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12341-12351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar).A large proportion of calcium mobilization and regulation in neurons can be attributable to cholinergic neurotransmission (18Berridge M.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 13-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). Phospholipase C (PLC), which predominantly couples to muscarinic receptors via G proteins, was shown to be essential for transduction of cholinergic signals in hippocampal and cortical neurons (19Kim D. Jun K.S. Lee S.B. Kang N.G. Min D.S. Kim Y.H. Ryu S.H. Suh P.G. Shin H.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Activated PLC hydrolyzes plasma membrane phosphoinositides (PI) to form the second messengers IP3 and diacylglycerol, which release calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and activate protein kinase C, respectively (20Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Cholinergic signaling is impaired in AD at different levels (21Auld D.S. Kornecook T.J. Bastianetto S. Quirion R. Prog. Neurobiol. 2002; 68: 209-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), and muscarinic receptor-stimulated PI hydrolysis is disturbed in vitro by both Aβ and apolipoprotein E4 (22Cedazo-Minguez A. Cowburn R.F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), two molecules involved in AD pathogenesis.Serial reports by Leissring and co-workers (12Leissring M.A. Paul B.A. Parker I.

Dis. 2001; 8: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) have shown that mutant PS1 enhances calcium signaling mediated by caged IP3 in Xenopus oocytes. By imaging calcium release with high resolution line scanning confocal microscopy, they found that mutant PS1 induced an increase of ER calcium stores without affecting the number or the sensitivity of IP3 receptors in the ER (24Leissring M.A. LaFerla F.M. Callamaras N. Parker I. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A recent study revealed that phosphoinositide/calcium signaling is dependent on the γ-secretase activity of PS1, because PS1 knock-out cells or cells treated with γ-secretase inhibitors showed no calcium signals upon bradykinin stimulation (25Leissring M.A. Murphy M.P. Mead T.R. Akbari Y. Sugarman M.C. Jannatipour M. Anliker B. Muller U. Saftig P. De Strooper B. Wolfe M. Golde T. LaFerla F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4697-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In a previous work (26Cedazo-Minguez A. Popescu B.O. Ankarcrona M. Nishimura T. Cowburn R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36646-36655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) we have shown that the FAD mutation-causing deletion of PS1 exon 9 (PS1 ΔE9) enhances basal [Ca2+]i, as a result of an increased PLC upstream of ER IP3 receptors. Currently it is still unclear whether this novel mechanism of calcium homeostasis alteration is common for all FAD PS1 mutants or is induced by only the PS1 ΔE9 mutation. To further elucidate the pathways by which PS1 interferes with cholinergic signal transduction, we transfected SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells to express wild type PS1 (PS1 WT), the FAD-causing PS1 M146V or PS1 L250S mutants, or the dominant negative PS1 D257A or PS1 D385N mutants lacking γ-secretase activity (27Kimberly W.T. Xia W. Rahmati T. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3173-3178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). These cell lines were used to measure basal and carbachol-stimulated PI hydrolysis and [Ca2+]i responses. We show that PS1 M146V but not PS1 L250S generates an increased basal PLC activity. However both FAD mutants gave increased basal and carbachol-stimulated [Ca2+]i. We also show that abolition of γ-secretase activity by pharmacological inhibition or by expression of dominant negative PS1 results in the attenuation of carbachol-stimulated PI hydrolysis and the following [Ca2+]i signals. Together, these data suggest that PS1 γ-secretase activity regulates PLC activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Chemicals and isotopes were purchased from the following companies: myo-[2-3H]inositol (10 Ci/mmol) from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Carbamylcholine chloride (carbachol), Dowex 1X8-200 (chloride form), dantrolene, pepstatin A, and probenecid were from Sigma-Aldrich. Neomycin (neomycin sulfate) and N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (Darmstadt, Germany). Fluo-3 acetoxymethyl (AM) ester and Pluronic F-127 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Europe BV, Leiden, The Netherlands). All other chemicals were standard laboratory reagents.Cell Lines, Cell Culture, and Transfections—Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in minimum essential medium with Earle's salts containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The transfected cells were additionally supplemented with 200 μg/ml geneticin. All of the cell culture supplies were purchased from Invitrogen (European Division).Transfection of cDNA constructs for mutant PS1 into SH-SY5Y cells was performed using DOTAP liposomal transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Stable transfectants were first selected in 500 μg/ml geneticin for several days, and then the geneticin concentration was reduced to 200 μg/ml. The expression levels of the transfected PS1 were determined by Western blotting as described previously (28Tanii H. Ankarcrona M. Flood F. Nilsberth C. Mehta N.D. Perez-Tur J. Winblad B. Benedikz E. Cowburn R.F. Neuroscience. 2000; 95: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We also confirmed expression of mutant PS1 mRNA in SH-SY5Y cells by sequencing following reverse transcription. Establishment of SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing wild type PS1 has been previously reported by our lab (28Tanii H. Ankarcrona M. Flood F. Nilsberth C. Mehta N.D. Perez-Tur J. Winblad B. Benedikz E. Cowburn R.F. Neuroscience. 2000; 95: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).cDNA Constructs—The two-step PCR method was employed to construct PS1 cDNA with an artificial mutation of either D257A or D385N, using wild type PS1 in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) as the template. Two sets of PCR reactions were performed each using: 1) a forward primer for the N terminus of PS1 (5′-CATATGACAGAGTTACCTGCACCG-3′) and a reverse primer for the sequence containing a point mutation (D257A, 5′-CAGCCACTAAAGCATATACTG-3′ or D385N, 5′-GAAAATGAAATTTCCCAATCC-3′) and 2) a forward primer for the sequence containing a point mutation (D257A, 5′-CAGTATATGCTTTAGTGGCTG-3′, or D385N, 5′-GGATTGGGAAATTTCATTTTC-3′) and a reverse primer for the C terminus of PS1 (5′-CTAGATATAAAATTGATGG-3′). The resultant two PCR fragments were mixed and hybridized to obtain the second template, which was amplified by PCR using the primers for both terminals of PS1. The resultant full-length PS1 cDNA with point mutations was inserted into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). The vectors containing cDNA constructs of FAD-associated PS1 mutations (M146V and L250S) were a gift from Prof. John Hardy (NIA, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). All of the cDNA constructs were sequenced for verification.Immunoblot Analysis—To obtain cell extracts, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), harvested with a cell scraper, and collected by 3,000 rpm centrifugation for 3 min. The pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2% Nonidet P-40, 2% Triton X-100, and 400 μg/ml protease inhibitors Complete™ Mini; Roche Applied Science) and centrifuged at 11,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The samples were stored at -20 °C until use. The Pierce BCA protein assay kit was used to quantify the protein amounts in cell extracts. PS1 expression was analyzed by separating equivalent protein amounts by SDS-PAGE using 10% acrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred onto Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) by trans-blot electrophoretic transfer for 4 h at a constant current of 200 mA. After blocking for 1 h using 5% (w/v) dried milk in Tris-buffered solution containing 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated overnight with an N-terminal PS1 antibody (28Tanii H. Ankarcrona M. Flood F. Nilsberth C. Mehta N.D. Perez-Tur J. Winblad B. Benedikz E. Cowburn R.F. Neuroscience. 2000; 95: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) diluted 1:2000. The membranes were washed in Tris-buffered solution containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 15 min and then washed three times for 5 min. The secondary antibody (anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked; Amersham Biosciences) diluted in blocking solution (1:2000) was added to the membranes for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were subsequently washed as described above, plus an additional wash of 1 h. Bound antibody was detected by the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences) after exposure to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences).PI Hydrolysis Assay—The cells were cultured to 75-80% confluence in 75-cm2 flasks. One day prior to the experiment, the cells were changed to serum-free medium containing 5 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol and incubated for 24 h. PI hydrolysis was measured as described previously (22Cedazo-Minguez A. Cowburn R.F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested by scraping with a rubber policeman in 4 ml of PBS. The contents were centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 15 min. The pellets were washed twice with 37 °C PBS and resuspended in 3mlof37 °C Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer containing 10 mm LiCl (KHB/Li), gassed with 5% CO2, 95% O2, and centrifuged again (15,000 rpm, 15 min). The cell pellets were resuspended in 210 μl of KHB/Li and regassed, and 50 μl was added to glass centrifuge tubes containing 250 μl of KHB/Li buffer with or without 100 μl of carbachol. The tubes were incubated at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% O2 with gentle agitation for 25 min. The incubations were stopped by adding 940 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:2). The tubes were incubated on ice for 30 min, and the phases were separated by adding 310 μl of chloroform and 310 μl of water followed by vortexing and centrifugation. 750 μl of the aqueous phase were removed, and labeled inositol phosphates were separated from myo-[3H]inositol by Dowex chromatography, as described by Berridge (29Berridge M.J. Cell Calcium. 1982; 3: 385-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The chloroform phase was removed, placed into scintillation vials, and allowed to evaporate before determination of “dpm lipid” by scintillation spectroscopy. The results were expressed as dpm inositol phosphates/(dpm inositol phosphates + dpm lipid). This unit is independent of the number of cells aliquoted in each tube and upon the degree of labeling of inositol phospholipids (30Fowler C.J. Court J.A. Tiger G. Bjorklund P.E. Candy J.M. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1987; 60: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).For the treatment with DAPT, 1 day prior to experiment, the cells were changed to serum-free medium containing 5 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]-inositol and incubated for 21 h. The medium was then replaced with that containing DAPT (1 μm) plus 5 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol for 3 h prior to PI hydrolysis measures.Intracellular Calcium Measurements—Intracellular calcium apparent concentrations were determined as described previously (31Popescu B.O. Cedazo-Minguez A. Popescu L.M. Winblad B. Cowburn R.F. Ankarcrona M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 66: 122-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells cultured in 96-well plates were loaded with minimum essential medium without phenol red containing 5 μm Fluo-3 AM ester, 0.5% (v/v) Pluronic F-127, and 1 mm probenecid (90 min in the dark at room temperature). After loading, the cells were incubated for 120 min in minimum essential medium without phenol red with 1 mm probenecid in the dark at room temperature to allow intracellular esterases to decompose the Fluo-3 AM ester. For the measurements of basal apparent [Ca2+]i, the medium was removed, and Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS was added. Basal apparent [Ca2+]i was measured repeatedly for 10 min at 37 °C to certify that a steady state of apparent [Ca2+]i was obtained. We found that basal apparent [Ca2+]i in the absence of treatments was steady during the entire incubation time courses used (26Cedazo-Minguez A. Popescu B.O. Ankarcrona M. Nishimura T. Cowburn R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36646-36655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Neomycin and dantrolene were added at indicated concentrations in minimum essential medium without phenol red during the 120 min of incubation time and in the PBS for the 10 min when basal apparent [Ca2+]i was measured. DAPT and pepstatin A were added to cells 24 h prior to experiments, in growth and incubation media and in the PBS for the 10 min when basal apparent [Ca2+]i was measured. After measuring basal apparent [Ca2+]i, the PBS was removed, and 100 μm carbachol in PBS solution at 37 °C was added (100 μl to each well). Carbachol was present for all subsequent apparent [Ca2+]i measures. A CytoFluor Series 4000 multiwell plate reader (PerSeptive Biosystems GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany) was used to measure fluorescence, with the excitation and emission wavelengths being 485 and 530 nm, respectively. Apparent [Ca2+]i corresponding to fluorescent value F was calculated with the formula, [Ca2+]i = Kd(F - Fmin)/(Fmax - F), where Kd for Fluo-3-Ca2+ was taken as 390 nm, as indicated by the protocol from the manufacturer (Molecular Probes Europe BV). Fmin was determined by measuring the signal of the unloaded cells, and Fmax was determined by the addition to the cells of a 100 mm CaCl2 buffer containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100.Statistical Analyses—Analyses of differences were carried out by ANOVA followed by Fisher's protected least significant distance post hoc test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSPS1 Expression in Transfected Cell Lines—We stably transfected SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells to overexpress PS1 WT or FAD mutant PS1 (PS1 M146V or PS1 L250S) or the nonfunctional dominant negative PS1 mutants (PS1 D257A or PS1 D385N). The transfection of these PS1 variants in SH-SY5Y cells was confirmed by sequencing and by immunoblotting with an N-terminal PS1 antiserum (Fig. 1). Different clones of PS1 D257A (clones 2, 2A and 2C) and of PS1 D385N (clones 1A and 1B) were checked for levels of PS1 expression (Fig. 1). The pattern of PS1 protein expression in nontransfected (NT) cells and PS1 WT or FAD mutant PS1 transfected cells was similar to our previous reports, with most of the PS1 being identified as the ∼28-kDa N-terminal fragment resulting from its constitutive endoproteolytic cleavage (26Cedazo-Minguez A.

Winblad B. Cowburn R.F. Ankarcrona M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 66: 122-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the PS1 WT and FAD mutant PS1 transfectants, we observed a moderate accumulation of an ∼48-kDa full-length protein, probably caused by limited PS1 proteolytic processing (32Thinakaran G. Harris C.L. Ratovitski T. Davenport F. Slunt H.H. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28415-28422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous findings (33Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar, 34Yu G. Chen F.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27348-27353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cells expressing PS1 D257A or PS1 D385N showed an accumulation of full-length PS1, because of a lack of endoproteolysis in these PS1 variants. This was more pronounced in D257A clones 2 and 2A and in D385N clone 1A (Fig. 1). D257A clones 2 and 2A also showed the presence of other PS1 fragments that presumably reflect caspase cleavage of overexpressed protein (Fig. 1).Effects of FAD Mutant PS1 and Dominant Negative Mutant PS1 on Basal and Carbachol-stimulated PI Hydrolysis—Basal PI hydrolysis values did not differ significantly in NT, PS1 WT, PS1 L250S, and PS1 D257A-2C cells (Fig. 2). In contrast, we found significantly higher PI hydrolysis in PS1 M146V cells (p < 0.05; ANOVA, Fisher's post hoc test) and significantly lower PI hydrolysis in PS1 D257A-2, PS1 D257A-2A, PS1 D385N-1A, and PS1 D385N-1B cells (p < 0.001; ANOVA, Fisher's post hoc test), as shown in Fig. 2. Stimulation with 100 μm carbachol of either the NT or PS1 WT cells gave an ∼2-fold increase in PI hydrolysis, comparable with that reported before (26Cedazo-Minguez A. Popescu B.O. Ankarcrona M. Nishimura T. Cowburn R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36646-36655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As compared with NT and PS1 WT cells, carbachol-stimulated PI hydrolysis was not significantly different either in PS1 M146V or PS1 L250S cells. Conversely, both PS1 D257A (p < 0.01 for all clones; ANOVA, Fisher's post hoc test) and PS1 D385N (p < 0.05 for clone 1A and p < 0.001 for clone 1B; ANOVA, Fisher's post hoc test) cells showed significantly lower PI hydrolysis upon stimulation with carbachol, as compared with NT and PS1 WT cells (Fig. 2). For further experiments, we selected PS1 D257A-2C and PS1 D385N-1B cells. These were the clones with the lowest level of PS1 expression among these cell lines. This was done to rule out potential artifacts caused by ER stress that could in theory occur because of overexpression of nonendoproteolyzed protein.Fig. 2Effects of FAD mutant presenilin 1 and dominant negative presenilin 1 on basal and carbachol-stimulated PI hydrolysis.

Both the PS1 M146V and the PS1 L250S cells showed a significantly higher basal apparent [Ca2+]i value (45.7 ± 1.9 and 43.5 ± 1.2 nm, respectively, p < 0.05; ANOVA, Fisher's post hoc test) as compared with NT and PS1 WT cells (Fig. 3). In accordance with the basal PI hydrolysis data, PS1 D385N cells showed a significantly lower basal apparent [Ca2+]i (35.6 ± 0.5 nm, p < 0.05; ANOVA, Fisher's post hoc test) as compared with NT and PS1 WT cells (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Effects of FAD mutant presenilin 1 and dominant negative presenilin 1 on basal and carbachol-stimulated intracellular calcium concentrations.

Sticky DNA is a single long GAA·GAA·TTC triplex formed in plasmids harboring a pair of long GAA·TTC repeat tracts in the direct repeat orientation. This requirement is fulfilled by either plasmid dimers of DNAs with a single trinucleotide repeat sequence tract or by monomeric DNAs containing a pair of direct repeat GAA·TTC sequences.

An excellent correlation was observed between the ability of a plasmid to adopt the sticky triplex conformation as assayed in vitro and its propensity to form plasmid dimers relative to monomers in vivo. The variables measured that strongly influenced these measurements are as follows: length of the GAA·TTC insert; the extent of periodic interruptions within the repeat sequence; the orientation of the repeat inserts; and the in vivo negative supercoil density. Nitrogen mustard cross-linking studies on a family of GAA·TTC-containing plasmids showed the presence of sticky DNA in vivo and, thus, serves as an important bridge between the in vitro and in vivo determinations. Biochemical genetic studies on FRDA containing DNAs grown in recA or nucleotide excision repair or ruv-deficient cells showed that the in vivo properties of sticky DNA play an important role in the monomer-dimer-sticky DNA intracellular intercon-versions.

The FRDA gene (X25) contains seven exons and encodes a 210-amino acid protein named frataxin (1Pandolfo M. Koenig M. Wells R.D. Warren S.T. Genetic Instabilities and Hereditary Neurological Diseases. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 373-398Google Scholar). Ninety eight percent of FRDA patients have an expanded GAA·TTC repeat in the first intron of the frataxin gene, and 2% have point mutations. FRDA is a typical triplet repeat disease (6Wells R.D. Warren S.T. Genetic Instabilities and Hereditary Neurological Diseases. Academic Press, San Diego1998Google Scholar) because an expansion of the repeat is found in patients; normal alleles have 6–34 repeats of GAA·TTC, but the FRDA patient alleles have 66–1700 repeats (1Pandolfo M.

Genetic Instabilities and Hereditary Neurological Diseases. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 373-398Google Scholar) have an earlier age of onset and more severe disease manifestations. FRDA is a loss of function disease because patients with two expanded alleles have reduced levels of frataxin. Also, a reduction in the amount of the frataxin protein, a mitochondrial protein involved in iron metabolism, is because of a diminution in the abundance of the frataxin mRNA (1Pandolfo M. Koenig M. Wells R.D. Warren S.T. Genetic Instabilities and Hereditary Neurological Diseases. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 373-398Google Scholar).

Hoogsteen base-pairing stabilizes the GAA·GAA interactions, whereas the GAA·TTC pairing is Watson-Crick. Two long tracts of (GAA·TTC)n (where n = 59–270) in the direct repeat orientation in a single DNA molecule are required for the formation of sticky DNA (13Vetcher A.A. Napierala M. Iyer R.

The requirement for two blocks of long GAA·TTC repeats can be fulfilled by either having two tracts in one recombinant plasmid or by biological dimers of the plasmids, each parent monomer containing a single repeat tract. The intermolecular formation of sticky DNA from two independent plasmid molecules, each harboring a single long GAA·TTC tract, has never been observed (13Vetcher A.A. Napierala M. Iyer R.

During the course of our plasmid investigations, we realized that DNAs with long and/or pure tracts of GAA·TTC that had the highest propensity to form sticky DNA also showed the greatest tendency to form plasmid dimer isoforms compared with monomeric forms (D/M ratio) during cell growth. Here we have evaluated the influence of TRS length, composition, and orientation as well as the effect of negative supercoil density and mutant host cells on the D/M ratio in E. coli. Furthermore, nitrogen mustard cross-linking studies directly demonstrate the formation of sticky DNA in vivo, thus validating the dimer to monomer ratio data as a measure of sticky DNA in living cells.

Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) and grown in 10 ml of LB media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Supercoiled plasmids were purified by the Wizard Plus Miniprep DNA Purification procedure (Promega Corp.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. To purify DNA monomers and dimers, 1–10 μg of the isolated plasmids, which contain monomers, dimers, and higher oligomers, in 60 μl of TE buffer containing 10% sucrose and 0.01% bromphenol blue (loading buffer) was loaded onto a 1% agarose gel. Electrophoresis was conducted in 40 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.3), 1 mm EDTA buffer (TAE) at 5 V/cm until the bromphenol blue reached a distance of 6 cm. Gels were stained by EtBr as described elsewhere (29Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). To prevent DNA damage during UV irradiation, aluminum foil was placed under the gel as a screen while excising the band. The bands corresponding to the monomeric and dimeric isoforms of the plasmids were excised from the agarose gels. DNAs were eluted from the gels using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cloning of a Pair of (GAA·TTC)150 Tracts into pSPL3—A fragment containing the (GAA·TTC)150 tract was prepared from pRW3822 (8Sakamoto N. Chastain P.D. Parniewski P. Ohshima K. Pandolfo M.

The vector was prepared by digesting pRW3822 with NheI followed by phenol-chloroform extraction. The sticky-end ligation of the mixture of the two DNAs and all subsequent cloning steps were performed as described earlier (30Napierala M. Parniewski P. Pluciennik A. Wells R.D. J. Biol.

All plasmids were fully characterized by restriction mapping to verify the orientation and length of the cloned TRS. Thus, pRW4201 contains two (GAA·TTC)150 tracts in the direct repeat orientation, and pRW4202 contains the two (GAA·TTC)150 repeats in the inverted repeat orientation (Fig. 1). The distance between these two (GAA·TTC)150 inserts in pRW4201 and pRW4202 is 1,912 and 1,665 bp, respectively. Conditions of Bacterial Growth for Recultivation Assay—For the recultivation studies, supercoiled monomeric or dimeric forms of the plasmids were purified from 1% agarose gels and used as the starting materials. E. coli cells were transformed with 50 ng of the monomeric or dimeric forms of the plasmids using the CaCl2 transformation method (29Sambrook J. Russell D.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) and grown in 10 ml of LB media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C at a shaking rate of 250 rpm. Populations of ∼1000 cells were used to initiate the culture. When the cultures reached an absorbance (600 nm) of 0.9 ± 0.05 unit (12–14 h) (i.e. step 1), an aliquot was inoculated into 10 ml of LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin as before at a final dilution of 1 × 10-7 and grown to the same OD (i.e. step 2), etc. (31Bowater R.P.

Observations reported here reveal that estrogen receptors α and β (ERα and ERβ), androgen receptor, and glucocorticoid receptor bind in vitro to vinexin α, a multiple SH3 motif-containing protein associated with the cytoskeleton. The SH3 domains are not involved in this interaction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that vinexin α stimulates the ligand-induced transactivation function of these receptors, although it is devoid of intrinsic transcriptional activity when tethered to DNA. In addition, the ectopic coexpression of vinexin α and ERα results in a loss of ERα phosphorylation on serines and the partial redistribution of vinexin α into the nucleus, where it colocalizes with ERα. These results establish a new model of transcriptional regulation where components of the cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion complexes can regulate the phosphorylation and activity of steroid receptors.

The modular structure of ERs into functional domains is shared with other steroid receptors and features an extremely divergent N-terminal region, a highly homologous central DNA-binding domain (DBD), and a conserved multifunctional C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD). Two transcription activation functions, the constitutive AF-1 and the hormone-dependent AF-2, have been allocated to the N-terminal domain and the LBD, respectively. Upon binding of ligand, steroid receptors are released from a complex with molecular chaperones and/or corepressors. Liganded receptors then bind to cognate hormone response elements, located in the promoter or enhancer regions of target genes, and stimulate transcription by transmitting signals to the transcriptional machinery through direct protein-protein interactions (8Sadovsky Y.

Both isoforms share a common C-terminal sequence, and the larger vinexin α contains an additional N-terminal sequence (see Fig. 1). Vinexin α was isolated via its interaction with vinculin, an abundant cytoskeletal protein found at cell-substrate adhesion sites (focal adhesions) and at cell-cell adhesions (intermediate junctions) where it regulates actin cytoskeletal organization. Through its association with vinculin, mediated by its first two SH3 domains, vinexin α stimulates the formation of actin stress fibers (17Kioka N. Sakata S. Kawauchi T. Amachi T. Akiyama S.K.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1001-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), have been identified. Besides the presence of three SH3 domains at their C termini, these proteins share with vinexin α a region of homology with the gut peptide sorbin (24Kimura A. Baumann C.A. Chiang S.H. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9098-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The sorbin homology (SoHo) domain mediates the interaction of CAP and vinexin with flotillin (a protein located at the lipid raft membrane fraction), the subsequent translocation of the c-Cbl/CAP complex to the lipid raft, and the propagation of the signal to guanyl nucleotide exchange proteins, resulting in the activation of intracellular signaling pathways.In the present study, we report that vinexin α also interacts with steroid receptors in vitro and stimulates their hormone-induced transactivation potential, although it has no inherent ability to activate transcription. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ERα elicits the relocation of a subset of vinexin α into the nucleus, where it colocalizes with ERα. Finally, our results reveal an inverse correlation between the levels of vinexin α and serine phosphorylation of ERα. In view of its function in growth factor signaling, we propose that vinexin α integrates signal transduction from the cell membrane and the regulation of steroid receptor action, further emphasizing the multifaceted role of the vinexin/ponsin/ArgBP2 family of proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—All recombinant plasmids were produced using standard cloning procedures with PCR-generated cDNA fragments and verified by DNA sequencing. The Gal4 DBD fusion yeast expression vector Gal4-ERβ(AF-1) was constructed by inserting a fragment of the rat ERβ cDNA corresponding to aa 1–103 (6Kuiper G.G. Enmark E. Pelto-Huikko M. Nilsson S.

Fragments of human vinexin α cDNA, corresponding to aa 1–201, aa 202–386, and aa 387–671, respectively, were introduced into the EcoRI site of the GST fusion Escherichia coli expression plasmid pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The pSG5-VINXa expression vector was obtained by subcloning a fragment containing the full coding sequence of vinexin α in an improved translational initiation codon context (GCCGCCACCATG) (25Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4151) Google Scholar) into the site of pSG5 (Stratagene). The intact vinexin α coding sequence was inserted into the EcoRI site of the Gal4 DBD mammalian expression vector pSG5Gal4(GBT9J) (26Treuter E. Johansson L. Thomsen J.S. Wärnmark A. Leers J.

Damdimopoulos.Yeast Two-hybrid Screening and RT-PCR—The isolation of cDNAs encoding proteins that interact with ERβ was performed in a yeast two-hybrid screening using the Gal4 MATCHMAKER system as suggested by the manufacturer (Clontech). Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain HF7c was sequentially transformed with Gal4-ERβ(AF-1) followed by a MATCHMAKER rat brain cDNA library constructed in the plasmid pGAD10. Positive clones were selected on the basis of their ability to grow on synthetic dropout plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine, in the presence of 1 mm aminotriazole. One positive clone showed homologies with a human cDNA sequence named SCAM-1 (GenBank™ accession number AF037261), which was later identified as the product of the vinexin gene (17Kioka N. Sakata S. Kawauchi T. Amachi T. Akiyama S.K. Okazaki K. Yaen C. Yamada K.M. Aota S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The full vinexin α coding sequence with surrounding partial UTRs was obtained by nested PCR on human cerebellum cDNA (Clontech). A first PCR was performed on 1 μl of cDNA using the ExpandLong PCR system (Roche Applied Science) with the sense primer 5′-CTCGCCGGGGAAGAGGACACGCAGAGGA-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-GGGCAAAGCGGAGAGCTGGTCCCTGTTAGA-3′ for 30 cycles with a final elongation step of 10 min. Each cycle consisted of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 65 °C, and 1 min 30 s at 68 °C; an increment of 20 s was added to each elongation step for the remaining 20 cycles. 1 μl of the PCR product was used as a template for the second amplification with the sense primer 5′-TGGCTTGCCCGGAGTCCTCCCACCTTGAC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-TTGGGGAGTGGGGTGGGGAGGAAATGAAAG-3′ under the same PCR conditions. The PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T easy (Promega) and sequenced.In Vitro Protein-Protein Interaction Assay (GST Pull-down Assay)— GST-vinexin α fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)-pLysS from pGEX-4T-1-based plasmids as described previously (33Caira F. Antonson P. Pelto-Huikko M. Treuter E. Gustafsson J.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5308-5317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and purified in a non-denaturing extraction solution (39Treuter E. Albrektsen T. Johansson L. Leers J. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 864-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). All nuclear receptors that were tested in pull-down assay were transcribed in vitro and translated with [35S]methionine using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TnT-coupled in vitro system, Promega) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Approximately 5 μg of GST fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were used in each assay. Glutathione-bound GST fusion proteins were incubated with 2 μlof[35S]methionine-labeled protein in the presence of the appropriate ligand in Me2SO or ethanol at a final concentration of 1 μm E2 (ERs), dexamethasone (GR), 5α-dihydrotestosterone (AR), T3 (TRβ), 9-cis-retinoic acid (RXRα), or with vehicle alone in a total volume of 200 μl of incubation buffer (20 mm Hepes KOH (pH 7.9), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After incubation overnight at +4 °C with rotation, beads were sedimented by centrifugation (2000 × g) and washed three times for 15 min with incubation buffer without bovine serum albumin. Washed beads were resuspended in 60 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer, and an aliquot was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Before autoradiography, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to control for the stability and the equal loading of the GST fusion proteins.Cell Cultures—Hepa-1c1c7, COS-7, MCF-7, and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Invitrogen). SK-N-BE cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% l-glutamine. HEK-293 cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Ham’s nutrient mixture F-12 (Invitrogen) and DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. MCF-10-2A cells were cultured in Ham’s F-12:DMEM (1:1) with 0.04 mm Ca2+, 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 100 ng/ml cholera toxin, 0.01 mg/ml insulin, 500 ng/ml hydrocortisone, and 5% horse serum. All cultures were supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (1% PEST). Cells were maintained in an atmosphere of 5.0% CO2 and 37 °C.Transactivation Assays—COS-7 cells were seeded on 6-well cell culture plates 24 h before transfection in phenol red-free DMEM containing 10% dextran-coated charcoal (DCC)-treated FCS, and 1% PEST. Transient transfection experiments utilizing the FuGENE6™ reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were performed as described by the manufacturer, using 0.8 μg of MMTV-Luc reporter plasmid, 10 ng of pCMVhGRα, or either 10 or 100 ng of pSG5-rAR and various amounts of pSG5-VINXa in the absence or presence of ligands (as indicated in the figure legends). Transient transfection experiments utilizing the Lipofectin® reagent (Invitrogen) were carried out as instructed by the manufacturer with 0.8 μg of 3xERE-TATA-Luc, 10 ng of either pSG5-ERα, pSG5-ERβ485, or pSG5-ERβ530 and various amounts of pSG5-VINXa in the absence or presence of E2 (as indicated in the figure legends). Prior to transfection, the cell culture medium was replaced by 1 ml of phenol red-free DMEM without serum or antibiotics. Six hours after addition of the DNA·lipid complexes to the cells, 1 ml of phenol red-free DMEM containing 10% DCC-treated FCS, 1% PEST, 10 nm E2 or vehicle alone was added. HEK-293 cells were seeded in a 1:1 mixture of phenol red-free DMEM (Invitrogen) and F-12 containing 10% DCC-treated FCS and 1% PEST. Cells were transiently transfected using the FuGENE6™ reagent with 0.8 μg of 3xERE-TATA-Luc, 10 ng of pSG5-ERα, and various amounts of pSG5-VINXa in the absence or presence of E2 (as indicated in the figure legends). For mammalian one-hybrid experiments, HEK-293 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of the UAS-tk-Luc reporter plasmid and various amounts of the different Gal4 fusion protein expression vectors (as indicated in the figure legends). After 24 h (HEK-293) or 36–48 h (COS-7), cellular extracts were prepared and analyzed for luciferase activity using a Berthold luminometer. The luciferase detection reagents were purchased from Biothema.Analysis of Intracellular Localization Using Confocal Microscopy— COS-7 cells were seeded onto glass coverslips in 12-well cell culture plates and grown in phenol red-free DMEM, 10% DCC-treated FBS, 1% PEST, for 24 h. The cells were transfected in OPTI-MEM I medium (Invitrogen) for 6 h with either 0.5 μg of pHcRed-ERα or 0.3 μg of pEGFP-VINXa, or both, using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). When necessary, the total amount of DNA was completed to 0.8 μg with pSG5. The cells were grown for 24 h after transfection in the absence or presence of 10 nm estradiol before fixing with 3% paraformaldehyde in 5% sucrose/PBS for 20 min at room temperature. The cell nuclei were stained with 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes), and the coverslips were then mounted on glass slides using antiphotobleaching Fluorosave (Calbiochem). Subcellular localization was determined using a TCS SP Multiband confocal imaging system (Leica Corp.).ERα Protein Stability—COS-7 cells were transfected using the Lipofectin® reagent with 0.8 μg of 3xERE-TATA-Luc, 10 ng of pSG5-ERα, and 1 μg of either pSG5 or pSG5-VINXa in the absence or presence of 10 nm E2 as described above. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were harvested in 500 μl of TEN (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl2) and lysed in 30 μl of buffer C (10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, and 1× Complete™, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), 0.4 m NaCl, by two successive cycles of freezing on dry ice and thawing. After centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm and 4 °C, the supernatant was recovered and 5 μl of protein extract was used for luciferase reporter assay as described above. 10 μg of proteins was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transblotted onto Hybond-P Nylon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. ERα was detected using the H-184 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a 1:1000 dilution in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% nonfat dried milk, and the rabbit IgG, horse-radish peroxidase-linked whole antibody (Amersham Biosciences) at a 1:10000 dilution. Signals were revealed with the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences).ERα Phosphorylation—COS-7 cells were seeded onto 150-mm plates 24 h before transfection. The cells were transiently transfected using the Lipofectin® reagent with 12 μg of 3xERE-TATA-Luc, 150 ng of pcDNA-FlagERα, and 15 μg of either pSG5 or pSG5-VINXa in the absence or presence of 10 nm E2. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were harvested in 1.5 ml of TEN and lysed as described above in 200 μl of buffer C, 0.4 m NaCl, supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors: Phosphatase Inhibitor Mixture I (1:1000) (Sigma), Phosphatase Inhibitor Mixture II (1:1000) (Sigma), 1 mm NaF, 1 mm NaPPi, and 2 μm fenvalerate. The luciferase reporter activity was monitored using 1 μlof protein extract. FLAG-tagged ERα was immunoprecipitated from 500-μg protein extracts using 5 μg of anti-FLAG M5 antibody (Sigma) in 450 μl of buffer C, 0.2 m NaCl, supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors. After 2-h incubation at 4 °C under gentle agitation, 25 μl of Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) were added, and the incubation prolonged for 2 h. After three washes with 1 ml of buffer C, 0.2 m NaCl, for 10 min and 1 wash with 1 ml of buffer C without NaCl, for 10 min, proteins retained in the immunopellets were denatured in 25 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer for 5 min at 100 °C. Ten μl of immunoprecipitates was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transblotted onto Hybond-P Nylon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The detection of the phosphoserine-containing proteins was achieved using the phosphoserine 1C8 mouse IgM antibody (Alexis Biochemicals) and the donkey anti-mouse IgM antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), both at a 1:1000 dilution in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 4% bovine serum albumin. ERα was detected using the H-184 rabbit polyclonal antibody as described above. Signals were revealed with the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences).RNA Blot Analysis—Various cell lines were grown to ∼80% confluence, and poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated as previously described (40Badley J.E.

Aliquots (3 μg) of RNA were electrophoresed on a formaldehyde-agarose gel prior to transfer to Zeta-probe membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and cross-linking. Random primed 32P-labeled probes to a cDNA fragment corresponding to amino acids 1–159 of human vinexin α and to full-length rat GAPDH cDNA were prepared using the Redi-Prime II kit (Amersham Biosciences). Human multiple tissue Northern blots (Clontech) and the cell line Northern blot were prehybridized and hybridized as recommended by the manufacturers.RESULTSIsolation of Vinexin α—We used the AF-1 region of ERβ485 (6Kuiper G.G.

We thus isolated a 1.5-kb cDNA fragment that showed high degrees of homology at the protein level with two human sequences named SCAM-1 (SH3-containing adaptor molecule-1) (GenBank™ accession number AF037261) and vinexin β (17Kioka N.

Yamada K.M. Aota S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Rat SCAM-1 cDNA contains a coding sequence starting at position 125 and ending with the end of the cloned cDNA fragment at position 1518 (data not shown). No upstream stop codon, in-frame with the first translation start site, was found in the first 124 bp. Comparison of protein sequences reveals that mouse vinexin α presents an extended N-terminal polypeptide that is not seen in the human or rat orthologues. The translation of the 5′-UTR in rat SCAM-1/vinexin α showed that the sequence conservation between rat and mouse is restricted to 19 codons directly upstream from the translation start site in the rat sequence (data not shown). Strikingly, no such similarity is observed in the more distal region of the rat 5′-UTR, in contrast to the overall high degree of conservation between the rat and the mouse sequences. We suggest that the conservation of the sequence upstrea"
https://openalex.org/W2126812112,"The function of the Fanconi anemia group C protein (FANCC) is still unknown, though many studies point to a role in damage response signaling. Unlike other known FA proteins, FANCC is mainly localized to the cytoplasm and is thought to act as a messenger of cellular damage rather than an effector of repair. FANCC has been shown to interact with several cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins and to delay the onset of apoptosis through redox regulation of GSTP1. We investigated the fate and function of FANCC during apoptosis. Here we show that FANCC undergoes proteolytic modification by a caspase into a predominant 47-kDa ubiquitinated protein fragment. Lack of proteolytic modification at the putative cleavage site delays apoptosis but does not affect MMC complementation. These results suggest that FANCC function is regulated through proteolytic processing.

A. 1999; 96: 10320-10325Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Assembly of the multiprotein complex seems to be necessary for the activation through post-translational monoubiquitination of FANCD2 (19Garcia-Higuera I. Taniguchi T. Ganesan S. Meyn M.S. Timmers C. Hejna J. Grompe M. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 249-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 20Taniguchi T. Dandrea A.D. Int. J. Hematol. 2002; 75: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Monoubiquitination of FANCD2 is dependent on the recently identified FANCL gene that possesses ubiquitin ligase activity (11Meetei A.R. De Winter J.P. Medhurst A.L. Wallisch M. Waisfisz Q. Van De Vrugt H.J. Oostra A.B. Yan Z. Ling C. Bishop C.E. Hoatlin M.E. Joenje H. Wang W. Nat. Genet. 2003; PubMed Google Scholar). The FANCD2 protein has been associated in nuclear foci with BRCA1, suggesting that BRCA1 may be a downstream component of the FA molecular pathway. Recently, the BRCA1 protein was shown to interact with the FANCA protein supporting a role of BRCA1 in the Fanconi pathway (21Folias A. Matkovic M. Bruun D. Reid S. Hejna J. Grompe M. D'Andrea A. Moses R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2591-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The FA group D1 protein, BRCA2/FANCD1/FANCB, may function upstream in the pathway by promoting the formation of the FA complex and/or downstream by transducing signals from FA proteins to the DNA repair machinery. Mutation in one of the FA genes abolishes the FA complex formation, the monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and the nuclear foci formation in response to genotoxic stress. Nuclear localization of the FA complex was found to be critical for cellular resistance to MMC (17Kruyt F.A. Abou-Zahr F. Mok H. Youssoufian H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34212-34218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Qiao F. Moss A. Kupfer G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23391-23396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, several lines of investigation have suggested additional extranuclear functions for at least some FA components. For instance, FANCC and FANCG were shown to bind non-nuclear proteins involved in oxygen radical metabolism such as cytochrome P450 reductase, glutathione S-transferase P1, or cytochrome P450 2E1 (23Futaki M. Igarashi T. Watanabe S. Kajigaya S. Tatsuguchi A. Wang J. Liu J.M. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 24Cumming R.C. Lightfoot J. Beard K. Youssoufian H.

Blood. 1998; 92: 3050-3056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of all known FA proteins, FANCC is the only protein predominantly located in the cytoplasm although a fraction is located to the nucleus in association with the FA protein complex (26Hoatlin M.E. Christianson T.A. Keeble W.W. Hammond A.T. Zhi Y. Heinrich M.C. Tower P.A. Bagby Jr., G.C. Blood. 1998; 91: 1418-1425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nuclear accumulation of FANCC seems to be mediated by FANCE (27Taniguchi T. D'Andrea A.D. Blood. 2002; 100: 2457-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). FANCC was also shown to bind protein chaperones GRP94 and HSP70 (28Hoshino T. Wang J. Devetten M.P. Iwata N. Kajigaya S. Wise R.J. Liu J.M. Youssoufian H.

In addition, FANCC was shown to form protein complexes with other partners such as cdc2, involved in cell cycle regulation (30Kupfer G.M. Yamashita T. Naf D. Suliman A. Asano S. D'Andrea A.D. Blood. 1997; 90: 1047-1054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the transcription factors FAZF (31Hoatlin M.E. Zhi Y. Ball H. Silvey K. Melnick A. Stone S. Arai S. Hawe N. Owen G. Zelent A. Licht J.D.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7025-7034Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Studies on FANCC protein structure have shown evidence that FANCC has multifunctional roles in cell survival, uncoupling the MMC complementation function and growth factor signaling (35Pang Q. Christianson T.A. Keeble W. Diaz J. Faulkner G.R. Reifsteck C. Olson S. Bagby G.C. Blood. 2001; 98: 1392-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Also, FA complementation group C cells and Fancc-/- cells derived from the FA group C mouse model show an increased apoptosis response to various cytokines (TNFα, IFNγ, MIP-1α) and DNA-damaging agents such as MMC or γ-rays (36Haneline L.S.

Heinrich M.C. Grompe M. Tower P.A. Bagby G.C. Blood. 1997; 90: 974-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of FANCC was shown to delay the onset of apoptosis induced by various signals, including Fas activation, serum deprivation, and MMC (39Cumming R.C. Liu J.M. Youssoufian H. Buchwald M. Blood. 1996; 88: 4558-4567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Wang J. Otsuki T. Youssoufian H. Foe J.L. Kim S. Devetten M. Yu J. Li Y. Dunn D. Liu J.M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3538-3541PubMed Google Scholar), via the redox regulation of GSTP1 activity (24Cumming R.C. Lightfoot J. Beard K. Youssoufian H. O'Brien P.J. Buchwald M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 814-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However the exact role of FANCC in the FA molecular pathway is still unknown. Here we show that FANCC undergoes proteolytic modification by a caspase during apoptosis. FANCC cleavage occurs in FA cell lines from all complementation groups tested. Mutagenesis of the putative cleavage site does not interfere with the FA complex formation or with MMC complementation function, although absence of FANCC proteolytic processing delays the onset of apoptosis. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—Normal (HSC93) and FA Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblasts (EUFA173, FA-A; HSC230, FA-B; HSC536, FA-C; HSC62, FA-D1; EUFA130, FA-E; EUFA121, FA-F) were grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum. HEK293T cells were grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were maintained in log phase growth before setting up experiments. FA-C lymphoblastoid cells were transfected by electroporation and HEK293T cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate transfection method with either the pFAC3 plasmid (pFANCC) containing the full-length FANCC gene (2Strathdee C.A. Gavish H. Shannon W.R. Buchwald M. Nature. 1992; 358: 434Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) or FANCC constructs (see below). Transfected cells were grown in hygromycin B (200 ng/ml) to select for plasmid-containing cells. MMC sensitivity was assayed by plating cells at a density of 1 × 105 per ml in 24 wells plate. Twenty-four hours after plating, various concentrations of MMC were added, and cells were further cultured for 5-7 days. Growth inhibition was evaluated by counting the number of cells in each well using an automated cell counter (Counter Z series, Beckman Coulter). Percent viability was established as the number of cell grown in drug divided by the number of cells grown in media alone. For proteasome and apoptosis inhibition or induction, cells were grown as previously indicated and drugs were added for various stimulation periods. Inhibitors were resuspended either in water or Me2SO and used as follows: proteasome inhibitors ALLN at 50 μm, lactacystin at 10 μm and MG132 at 10 μm (all from Biomol Laboratories Inc); lysosomal inhibitor E64 at 50 μm; apoptosis inducer etoposide at 68 μm (Sigma), staurosporine at 1 μm (Roche Applied Science); caspase inhibitors, YVAD-CHO, IETD-CHO, DEVD-CHO (100 μm final; Bachem) were added 30 min prior to proteasome inhibition. Controls were either performed with equivalent volumes of water or Me2SO. Mutagenesis and FANCC Constructs—Mutagenesis of both FANCC LETD and KEMD putative caspase sites were performed by PCR using FANCC-specific primers containing the nucleotide change from an adenine to a cytosine changing in both cases the aspartic acid to an alanine at codon 56 (FANCC-D56A) or 306 respectively (FANCC-D306A). PCR amplifications were performed using a proofreading polymerase (Roche Diagnostics) with the following conditions: 1 cycle at 94 °C 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s. PCR fragments were gel-purified and cloned into expression vectors pRep4 or pEBV (Invitrogen). The FANCC-del-1-18 (1-18-bp deletion of FANCC open reading frame) mutant was produced from a BglII restriction digest at position 273 of the full-length FANCC cDNA coding for a polypeptide missing the first 7 amino acids. All clones were sequenced to confirm the presence of the base change at the putative caspase site and to confirm the absence of PCR-induced mutations. FANCC cDNA constructs were cloned in fusion with either EGFP in pEGFPC1 vector (Clontech; full-length FANCC, pEGFPFANCC; FANCC from amino acids 56-558, pEGFPFANCC-56-558 and C-terminal FANCC from amino acids 306-558, pEGFPFANCC-306-558) or His tag at the N-terminal or C-terminal end (pEBVFANCC and pFANCCHis in pEBVHis or pREP4 vectors, respectively; Invitrogen). Western Blotting Analysis and Immunoprecipitations—Total cell lysates were prepared in SDS loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCL, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS). Samples were sonicated and boiled and subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-acrylamide gel (Invitrogen). Proteins were electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and probed with either polyclonal anti-poly(ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP) antibodies (Dr. Guy Poirier, Québec, Canada), anti-presenilin-1 (PS1) antibodies, polyclonal anti-His antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-human FANCC antibodies raised against the N-terminal or C-terminal end of the protein, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Chemiluminescence was detected by autoradiography using the ECL Western blotting analysis system from Amersham Biosciences. For immunoprecipitation, 5 × 106 to 1 × 107 cells were harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and complete proteases inhibitors; Roche Diagnostics). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and mixed with 5 μg of the precipitating antibodies: anti-FANCC, anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-HA (Roche Diagnostics). After overnight incubation at 4 °C, protein A-agarose beads were added to each sample and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Beads were washed three times and resuspended in SDS loading buffer, boiled, and loaded immediately on denaturing 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred and visualized as described above. Polyclonal anti-FANCC antiserum was generated in rabbits using as immunogens peptides corresponding to FANCC residues 41-58 and 544-558 coupled via the N-terminal cysteine residue to the carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). New Zealand White female rabbits were injected subcutaneously with a mixture of 2 mg (0.5 ml) of peptide and 0.5 ml of Freund's complete adjuvant and boosted three times at 4-week intervals. FANCC antibodies were affinity-purified using Amminolink plus affinity columns (Pierce). The animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care committee of the Université Laval. Detection of Ubiquitination—HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with 10 μg of full-length FANCC (pFAC3) along with 10 μg of an HA-tagged ubiquitin-expressing vector (a gift from Dr. Shigetsugu Hatakeyama, Kyushu University, Higashi-Ku, Fukuoka, Japan) by the calcium phosphate transfection method. Following an overnight incubation period, cell media was changed, and cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor ALLN (50 μm). Total cell lysates were prepared, subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and probed with either anti-HA antibodies (clone 12CA5, Roche Applied Science) or anti-FANCC antibodies as described above. Fluorescence Microscopy—Hela or HEK293T cells were grown on microscopy glass cover slides in 6-well plates and transfected with pEGFP-FANCC fusion vectors using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. 24-48 h after transfection, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, stained with DAPI, and mounted on microscopic slides. Cells were visualized using an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Nikon Canada Inc.), and images were captured using a Coolsnap digital camera (Canberra-Packard-Canada). Proteolytic Modification of FANCC—It has been reported previously that the FANCC protein is regulated at the post-transcription level in a cell cycle-dependent manner (41Heinrich M.C. Silvey K.V. Stone S. Zigler A.J. Griffith D.J. Montalto M. Chai L. Zhi Y. Hoatlin M.E. Blood. 2000; 95: 3970-3977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While Heinrich et al. (41Heinrich M.C. Silvey K.V. Stone S. Zigler A.J. Griffith D.J. Montalto M. Chai L. Zhi Y. Hoatlin M.E. Blood. 2000; 95: 3970-3977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that FANCC regulation occurred both at the mRNA translation and protein degradation level, we observed that FANCC was regulated through proteolytic modification before being targeted to the 26 S proteasome pathway (Fig. 1). Western blot analysis of protein extracts from normal cells incubated with the irreversible or reversible proteasome inhibitors, lactacystin, and ALLN, respectively, showed accumulation of a truncated FANCC protein fragment (Fig. 1). No accumulation of the full-length endogenous FANCC protein was observed in either ALLN- or lactacystin-treated cells. Proteasome inhibitors have been shown to induce apoptosis (42Drexler H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 855-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 43Shinohara K. Tomioka M. Nakano H. Tone S. Ito H. Kawashima S. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Detection of a 47-kDa FANCC fragment (FANCCp47) correlated with apoptosis induction as demonstrated by PARP cleavage and caspase-3 and caspase-8 activation (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that during apoptosis the FANCC protein undergoes proteolytic cleavage before being targeted to the 26 S proteasome pathway. We also tested whether FANCC proteolytic modification was only detectable with inhibitors specific to the 26 S proteasome degradation pathway. We used the lysosomal inhibitor E-64 and analyzed FANCC cleavage. The lysosomal inhibitor E-64 did not induce apoptosis as shown by lack of PARP cleavage and, consequently, we did not observe any FANCC proteolytic fragments as compared with proteasome inhibitors ALLN, lactacystin or MG132 (Fig. 1D). To determine if FANCC cleavage resulted specifically from apoptosis induction we used the fast-acting apoptotic inducer staurosporine and analyzed for FANCC cleavage. Cells were treated with staurosporine with or without the proteasome inhibitor ALLN. Staurosporine was added 1 h prior to proteasome inhibition. Using these conditions, the proteasome inhibitor ALLN did not induce apoptosis showed by lack of caspase-3 and caspase-8 activation or PARP cleavage (Fig. 1E). However, staurosporine alone or in combination with ALLN induced apoptosis shown by caspase-3 and caspase-8 activation and PARP cleavage while FANCC 47-kDa fragment was only detectible when ALLN was used in conjunction with staurosporine. These results suggest that cleavage of FANCC is a direct consequence of apoptosis and that proteasome inhibition is required for FANCCp47 detection. FANCC Is Cleaved by a Caspase—Since caspases have been shown to be important mediators of apoptosis, cleavage of FANCC may occur by a caspase. To verify if the 47-kDa FANCC-specific fragment resulted from a cleavage by a caspase, we incubated normal HSC93 lymphoblastoid cells with different caspase inhibitors for group I (Ac-YVAD-CHO), group II (Ac-DEVD-CHO) and group III caspases (Ac-IETD-CHO) (44Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Leiting B. Ruel R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32608-32613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). These inhibitors have been shown to block various forms of apoptosis by binding as substrates to the catalytic site of caspases, where Ac-YVAD-CHO preferentially inhibits Group I caspases such as caspase-1, -4, and -5, and to a lesser extent some members of Group III caspases including caspase-6, -8, and -10 (44Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Leiting B. Ruel R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32608-32613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Ac-DEVD-CHO is a potent inhibitor of caspase-3 and -7 and, to a lesser extent of caspase-8, whereas Ac-IETD-CHO resembles the preferred sequences for Group III caspases (caspase-6, -8, -9, and -10). Cells were treated with caspase inhibitors 30 min prior to the addition of the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. Western blot analysis of protein extracts, using FANCC-specific antibodies, revealed that all caspase inhibitors prevented FANCC cleavage and only little FANCC p47 could be detected (Fig. 2). Inhibition of caspase activity was confirmed by reduced PARP cleavage and absence of the caspase-3 12-kDa fragment. Similar results were obtained using the reversible proteasome inhibitor ALLN (data not shown). Mapping of the FANCC Cleavage Site—To identify the FANCC putative cleavage site, we first investigated if the 47-kDa FANCC fragment corresponded to the N- or C-terminal end of the FANCC protein. Using specific FANCC antibodies directed against either the N- or C-terminal end of the protein, we show that FANCCp47 corresponds to the C-terminal end of the protein (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained with FANCC fusion proteins His-tagged at the N or C terminus and probed with anti-His antibodies (Fig. 3B). The p47 FANCC fragment was detected from both endogenous or overexpressed FANCC. However, overexpression of FANCC resulted in the presence of a 55-kDa FANCC-specific band detected with anti-FANCC antibodies directed against the C-terminal end of the protein. This 55-kDa truncated FANCC protein could be the result of a reinitiation from methionine 55 as previously reported (45Yamashita T. Wu N. Kupfer G. Corless C. Joenje H. Grompe M. D'Andrea A.D. Blood. 1996; 87: 4424-4432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because FANCC proteolytic processing can be inhibited by caspase inhibitors, we analyzed the FANCC amino acid sequence for any putative caspase sites. FANCC protein sequence analysis revealed 4 putative caspase cleavage sites at position 7 (4DSVD↓L8), 56 (53KEMD↓S57), 306 (303LETD↓G307), and 358 (355DPQD↓I359). Both53KEMD↓S57 and303LETD↓G307 resemble preferred cleavage sites for Caspase-8 (46Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1834) Google Scholar). Although, estimation of a FANCC fragment size at these putative caspase sites do not give a C-terminal 47-kDa fragment size, mutagenesis of the two most plausible FANCC cleavage sites was performed where the aspartic acid at position 56 or 306 was mutated to the noncleavable amino acid alanine (D56A and D306A, respectively). Cells were transiently transfected with pFANCC-D56A or pFANCC-D306A and subjected to proteasome inhibition in order to determine if FANCC cleavage occurred at either site. Replacement of both Asp-56 and Asp-306 with Ala resulted in the absence of proteolytic processing of FANCC, thus eliminating p47 (Fig. 3C). We also performed analysis of the DSVD putative cleavage site (pFANCC-del1-18) using FA-C mutant cells transfected with the full-length or truncated FANCC and showed that the DSVD FANCC deletion mutant was cleaved into p55 and p47 FANCC fragments (Fig. 3D). Since FANCC proteolytic processing give rise to an observed fragment size of 47 kDa and the putative caspase site at Asp-306 gives a predicted size of 28 kDa, suggest that the FANCC proteolytic fragment may be subjected to post-translational modification such as ubiquitination. Furthermore, since we only observed FANCCp47 with proteasome inhibitors, we tested the hypothesis that FANCC proteolytic fragment is ubiquitinated before being targeted to the proteasome. To do so, we transfected HEK293T cells with a cDNA encoding HA-ubiquitin (47Ageta H. Kato A. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. Isojima Y. Sugiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15893-15897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) along with full-length FANCC and subjected cells to proteasome inhibition. We found that the FANCC p47 fragment observed following proteasome inhibition is ubiquitinated (Fig. 3E). Ubiquitin was only detectible in cells transfected with the HA-ubiquitin coding vector (pHAub) alone or in combination with the full-length FANCC coding vector pFANCC (Fig. 3F). The FANCC C-terminal Fragment Is Located Principally in the Cytoplasm—The FANCC protein has been shown to be distributed principally to the cytoplasm but also to the nucleus (26Hoatlin M.E. Christianson T.A. Keeble W.W. Hammond A.T. Zhi Y. Heinrich M.C. Tower P.A. Bagby Jr., G.C. Blood. 1998; 91: 1418-1425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To address the question whether the C-terminal proteolytic FANCC fragment is also located to the cytoplasm, we evaluated the subcellular localization of the FANCC C-terminal fragment using EGFP fusion constructs. Full-length and C-terminal FANCC were cloned in fusion to the EGFP protein, transfected into HEK293T cells and visualized by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4). All FANCC constructs, either full-length FANCC, FANCC corresponding to amino acids 56-558 (pFANCC-56-558) or C-terminal FANCC (pFANCC-306-558), were found to be principally located to the cytoplasm. We also employed a differential centrifugation technique in order to obtain subcellular fractions. We found that the endogenous proteolytic p47 FANCC fragment is located to the cytoplasm in ALLN-treated cells"
https://openalex.org/W2055462889,"Antithrombin becomes an efficient inhibitor of factor Xa and thrombin by binding a specific pentasaccharide sequence found on a small fraction of the heparan sulfate proteoglycans lining the microvaculature. In the structure of native antithrombin, the reactive center loop is restrained due to the insertion of its hinge region into the main beta-sheet A, whereas in the heparin-activated state the reactive center loop is freed from beta-sheet A. In both structures, hinge region residue Glu-381 makes several stabilizing contacts. To determine the role of these contacts in the allosteric mechanism of antithrombin activation, we replaced Glu-381 with an alanine. This variant is less active toward its target proteases than control antithrombin, due to a perturbation of the equilibrium between the two forms, and to an increase in stoichiometry of inhibition. Pentasaccharide binding affinity is reduced 4-fold due to an increase in the off-rate. These data suggest that the main role of Glu-381 is to stabilize the activated conformation. Stability studies also showed that the E381A variant is resistant to continued insertion of its reactive center loop upon incubation at 50 degrees C, suggesting new stabilizing interactions in the native structure. To test this hypothesis, and to aid in the interpretation of the kinetic data we solved to 2.6 A the structure of the variant. We conclude that wild-type Glu-381 interactions stabilize the activated state and decreases the energy barrier to full loop insertion."
https://openalex.org/W2022408915,"In previous studies, we reported the isolation and characterization of a Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant (pgsG) defective in glucuronyltransferase I (GlcATI). This enzyme adds the terminal GlcA residue in the core protein-linkage tetrasaccharide (GlcAβ1,3Galβ1,3Galβ1, 4Xylβ-O-) on which glycosaminoglycan assembly occurs (Bai, X.

Here we show that incorporation of 35SO4 into glycosaminoglycans in the mutant is temperature-sensitive, with greater synthesis occurring at 33 °C compared with 37 °C. Wild-type cells show the opposite thermal dependence. Rabbit antiserum to hamster GlcATI failed to detect cross-reactive material in pgsG cells by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Furthermore, expression of chimeric proteins composed of mutant GlcATI fused to IgG binding domain of protein A or to green fluorescent protein did not yield the proteins at the expected mass. The green fluorescent protein-tagged version appeared as a truncated protein, and immunofluorescence showed large perinuclear bodies at 30 °C. At 37 °C, the fusion protein was not readily detectable. Sequencing cDNAs from mutant and wild-type cells revealed a single base transition (G331A) in the open reading frame in pgsG cells, which resulted in a Val-111 → Met substitution. These data suggest that pgsG cells contain a labile form of GlcATI that causes conditional expression of glycosaminoglycans dependent on temperature. In previous studies, we reported the isolation and characterization of a Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant (pgsG) defective in glucuronyltransferase I (GlcATI). This enzyme adds the terminal GlcA residue in the core protein-linkage tetrasaccharide (GlcAβ1,3Galβ1,3Galβ1, 4Xylβ-O-) on which glycosaminoglycan assembly occurs (Bai, X. M., Wei, G., Sinha, A., and Esko, J. D. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 13017–13024; Wei, G., Bai, X. M., Sarkar, A. K., and Esko, J. D. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 7857–7864).

These data suggest that pgsG cells contain a labile form of GlcATI that causes conditional expression of glycosaminoglycans dependent on temperature. Proteoglycans play important roles as regulators in many biologic processes, such as cell adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, and cytokine and growth factor action (1Kjellén L. Lindahl U.

Most of these activities depend on interactions of proteins with sulfated oligosaccharide sequences present in the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) 1The abbreviations used are: GAGglycosaminoglycanCHOChinese hamster ovaryGlcAd-glucuronic acidGlcATIUDP-GlcA: Galβ1,3Gal-R β1,3glucuronyltransferasePBSphosphate-buffered salineGFPgreen fluorescent proteinMES2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acidGSTglutathione S-transferaseFITCfluorescein isothiocyanate.1The abbreviations used are: GAGglycosaminoglycanCHOChinese hamster ovaryGlcAd-glucuronic acidGlcATIUDP-GlcA: Galβ1,3Gal-R β1,3glucuronyltransferasePBSphosphate-buffered salineGFPgreen fluorescent proteinMES2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acidGSTglutathione S-transferaseFITCfluorescein isothiocyanate. chains that distinguish proteoglycans from other glycoconjugates. GAG assembly initiates by the formation of a tetrasaccharide, GlcAβ1,3Galβ1,3Galβ1,4Xylβ-O-attached to the side chain hydroxyl group of specific serine residues (3Esko J.D. Zhang L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This oligosaccharide serves as a primer for chain elongation, forming either heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate depending upon the addition of a GlcNAc or GalNAc residue, respectively (3Esko J.D. Zhang L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 4Sugahara K. Kitagawa H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 518-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The chains then polymerize by the alternating addition of GlcA and GlcNAc or GalNAc residues and undergo modifications by multiple sulfotransferases and epimerases, thus generating binding sites for various ligands (5Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 6Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev.

Nearly all of the enzymes involved in GAG assembly have now been identified, molecularly cloned, and in many cases mutated in cells or model organisms (6Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar).Glucuronyltransferase I (GlcATI) catalyzes the final biosynthetic step in the formation of the linkage region tetrasaccharide. The enzyme has been purified and cloned from several sources (7Kitagawa H. Ujikawa M. Tsutsumi K. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K.

A. 2001; 98: 12984-12989Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).We described previously a set of Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants designated pgsG that lack GlcATI enzyme activity and fail to make both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate (20Bai X.M. Wei G. Sinha A. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13017-13024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the course of studying the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of GlcATI (21Bulik D.A. Wei G. Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Waldrip W.R. Esko J.D. Robbins P.W. Selleck S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10838-10843Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we discovered that GAG assembly in the pgsG mutants depended on the temperature at which the cells were grown. Here we show that the pgsG mutants contain a point mutation in the GlcATI gene, which renders GAG synthesis temperature-sensitive.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1, ATCC CCL-61) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The isolation of mutants pgsG-110, -114, and -224 was described previously (20Bai X.M. Wei G. Sinha A. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13017-13024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The cells were grown under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air and 100% relative humidity and maintained in Ham's F-12 growth medium (Hyclone Laboratories) supplemented with 7.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories), 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 units/ml penicillin G. Sulfate-free medium was prepared from individual components (22Ham R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 53: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar), substituting chloride salts for sulfate, and fetal bovine serum that had been dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (23Dulbecco R. Vogt M. J. Exp. Med. 1954; 99: 167-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar).Purification of Glycosaminoglycan Chains—Cells were labeled for 6–24 h with 10 μCi/ml H235SO4 (1600 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in sulfate-free medium as indicated in the figure legends. Radiolabeled GAGs were isolated from the growth medium and the cells by anion-exchange chromatography as described (24Bame K.J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8059-8065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and quantified by liquid scintillation chromatography, and the counts were expressed relative to the amount of cell protein that was analyzed. In some experiments, the radiolabeled GAGs were analyzed by anion-exchange high pressure liquid chromatography (20Bai X.M. Wei G. Sinha A. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13017-13024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The elution position of chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate was determined by enzymatic treatment of the chains (24Bame K.J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8059-8065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In Vitro Assay of GlcATI Activity—GlcATI activity was assayed under optimized conditions as described (10Wei G. Bai X.M. Sarkar A.K. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7857-7864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Bai X.M. Wei G. Sinha A. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13017-13024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The standard reaction (25 μl) contained 10–30 μg of total cell homogenates, 0.05% Triton X-100, 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.2–0.4 μCi of UDP-[1-3H]GlcA, 100 μm UDP-GlcA, and 10 mm synthetic Galβ1,3Galβ-O-naphthalenemethanol as acceptor (25Sarkar A.K. Esko J.D. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 279: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The reaction was diluted with 1 ml of 0.5 m NaCl and applied to a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (100 mg, Waters). After washing the cartridge with 2 ml of water, the product was eluted with 50% methanol, dried, and counted by liquid scintillation. The reaction was proportional to protein and time at 37 °C for at least 4 h.DNA Sequencing—mRNA from mutant and wild-type CHO cells was purified, and first-strand cDNA was produced using random primers (Superscript™ Preamplification System for First Strand cDNA synthesis, Invitrogen). The 5′- and 3′-primers are 5′-TCTAAAGCGGTCCCCGCGGACCCC-3′ and 5′-TGGAGGGGCTGCCTCTGGTTCTGA-3′. PCR was carried out with Pfu polymerase (Clontech; 25 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, followed by a final incubation at 72 °C for 7 min) in a 2400 Thermocycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The PCR products were cloned into pCR-Script Amp SK(+) (Stratagene). At least two clones from each PCR were sequenced on both strands by the dideoxy chain termination method using Taq polymerase (dye terminator cycle sequencing, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with a DNA automatic sequencer (ABI PRISM genetic analyzer).Production of Rabbit Polyclonal Antiserum against GlcAT-1—A polyclonal antiserum was prepared against recombinant GlcATI fused to glutathione S-transferase. A cDNA fragment consisting of GlcATI without its transmembrane and cytosolic domains (residues 29–335) was amplified by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Clontech) and cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pGEX-KG expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting cDNA encoded a fusion protein composed of GST, a thrombin cleavage site, and the catalytic domain of hamster GlcATI. The GST fusion protein was produced after isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction of a 1-liter culture of Escherichia coli DH5α containing the plasmid. The cells were recovered by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 ml of cold PBS containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm benzamidine. The sample was sonicated twice for 30 s on ice, adjusted to 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and centrifuged at 4 °C at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) were equilibrated with PBS, and 1 ml of a 50% slurry was added to the supernatant. The suspension was mixed gently at 4 °C for 30 min using a rotary mixer and then briefly centrifuged to recover the beads. After washing the beads 4 times with cold PBS, the fusion protein was eluted by incubating the beads twice with 1 ml of fresh, reduced glutathione (10 mm) followed by centrifugation. The eluant was diluted 10-fold with cold PBS and repurified on fresh beads. GST-GlcATI was injected into New Zealand White rabbits (0.5 mg/injection, Robert Sargeant, Ramona, CA). The antiserum was obtained after 5–6 injections, spaced apart by 6–12 weeks.To make affinity columns, purified GST and GST-GlcATI were cross-linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). Rabbit antiserum was diluted 1:3 with PBS and mixed with GST-GlcATISepharose (1 ml) at 4 °C overnight. The resin was collected by low speed centrifugation and washed with PBS until the absorbance at 280 nm of the supernatant was ≤0.01. The antibodies were eluted twice with 4 ml of a buffer containing 0.05 m glycine and 0.15 m NaCl, pH 2.3, neutralized immediately with 1 m Tris base, pH 9.5, and dialyzed against PBS at 4 °C. Antibodies to GST were removed by passing the antiserum through a column containing GST, and the material was then concentrated by membrane centrifugation (Centricon 10) to ∼0.5 mg/ml. The antiserum appeared to be specific based on its strong reaction with purified GST-GlcATI fusion protein by Western blotting and the reaction of a single band in extracts from wild-type CHO cells.Expression of Wild-type and Mutant GlcATI Fusion Proteins—cDNA encoding amino acids 30–335 of GlcATI (stem region and catalytic domain) was prepared and fused in-frame to the C terminus of the IgG-binding domain of protein A in pRK5-F10-PROTA (26Wei Z. Swiedler S.J. Ishihara M. Orellana A. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3885-3888Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, isolated by IgG affinity chromatography from the medium, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.The full-length coding sequences of mutant and wild-type GlcATI were prepared by PCR and fused in-frame to the N terminus of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). These constructs were transiently transfected into CHO-K1 cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). For Western blots, the cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. For labeling studies, [35S]methionine was added 24 h after transfection, and 1 day later the cells were harvested and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and Western blottingSDS-PAGE Analysis—Samples were boiled in reducing SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 4–20% Tris-glycine gel. Gels containing [35S]methionine-labeled samples were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Other samples were blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blots were incubated with anti-GlcATI antiserum (1:500 dilution) and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase or with anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution of 0.4 mg/ml stock) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antimouse IgG.Some samples were immunoprecipitated to enrich for fusion proteins. The spent medium was decanted from cells transiently transfected with GlcATI-GFP fusion proteins, and the cell layers were washed three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl. Lysis buffer (1 ml) was added (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm EDTA). After incubation for 20 min at room temperature, the cell lysates were incubated with 10 μg of anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science, catalog number 1814460) on ice for 1 h. Protein G-agarose (50 μl, Roche Applied Science) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The pellet of absorbed immunoprecipitate was washed with lysis buffer and collected for SDS-PAGE.Immunostaining GlcATI in Wild-type and Mutant CHO Cells—Both wild-type and pgsG mutant cells were grown on glass coverslips at low density. The cells were first made permeable by treatment with PBS containing 0.1% Triton and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (10 min) and then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. The cells were then stained with antibodies to GlcATI or α-mannosidase II (kindly provided by Dr. Marilyn Farquhar, University of California, San Diego) and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies. Cells were viewed by epifluorescence under a Zeiss microscope fitted with a green barrier filter for FITC emission. The digitized images were captured using a DKC-5000 digital camera (Sony) and rendered in Adobe Photoshop.Wild-type and mutant GlcATI-GFP were transiently transfected into wild-type and mutant CHO cells on coverslips using LipofectAMINE™ (Invitrogen). Three days later, cells were made permeable with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and then fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The cells were stained with Hoechst dye, and photomicrographs were taken and processed as described (19Pinhal M.A.S. Smith B. Olson S. Aikawa J. Kimata K. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12984-12989Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONGlycosaminoglycan Synthesis Is Conditionally Defective in pgsG Cells—In the course of studying the GlcATI ortholog of C. elegans (SQV-8), a cDNA clone for the C. elegans gene was introduced into pgsG mutant cells to test if it corrected the GAG deficiency (21Bulik D.A. Wei G. Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Waldrip W.R. Esko J.D. Robbins P.W. Selleck S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10838-10843Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In these studies, the cells were grown at 30 °C because some enzymes from nematodes are more active at lower temperatures. pgsG cells made GAGs after transfection with SQV-8 GlcATI, but the same results were obtained when the cells were transfected using a control vector lacking any insert. Further analysis showed that the mutant produced GAGs to the same extent as wild-type cells at all temperatures below 30 °C, whereas it produced significantly less GAG at higher temperatures (35–37 °C) (Fig. 1A). Some residual synthesis occurred at elevated temperatures presumably due to a small amount of residual enzyme activity (as shown below). Analysis of the composition of the [35S]GAGs generated at 30 °C showed that pgsG cells made the normal amount of heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate as compared with wild-type cells grown under identical conditions (Fig. 2). At 37 °C, the mutant made a small amount of 35S-labeled material that migrated like GAG chains. Furthermore, the heparan sulfate chains from both mutant and wild-type cells grown at 30 °C bound FGF-2 to the same extent (data not shown and see Ref. 27Bai X.M. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17711-17717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar).Fig. 2pgsG cells produce a normal complement of glycosaminoglycans at 30 °C. Wild-type (A) and pgsG (B) cells were cultured at 37 °C for 2 days. One set of cultures was left at 37 °C and another was shifted to 30 °C. Both sets were labeled with 35SO4 overnight.

When maintained at 30 °C, both mutant and wild-type cells generated GAGs at the same rate, which paralleled the growth of the cells (doubling time ∼30 h). When shifted to 37 °C, wild-type cells increased the rate of synthesis of GAGs dramatically, balancing the extent of GAG synthesis with the increase in growth rate (doubling time ∼14 h). In contrast, when the mutant was shifted to 37 °C, [35S]GAGs no longer accumulated in the cultures. The doubling time of the mutant was unaffected, indicating that the decrease in GAG synthesis was independent of growth. The decrease in the amount of [35S]GAGs recovered from the cultures 1–2 days after temperature shift presumably reflects partial turnover of membrane proteoglycans through endocytosis and lysosomal degradation (28Bame K.J. Zhang L. David G. Esko J.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 29Bai X.M. Bame K.J. Habuchi H. Kimata K. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23172-23179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).GlcATI Activity in pgsG Cells—The labeling studies suggested that GlcATI activity should be present in pgsG cells cultured at 30 °C and that it might be thermolabile. To test this possibility, cell-free extracts were prepared from mutant and wild-type cells cultured at 30 °C and assayed at 30 and 37 °C using conditions optimized for the wild-type enzyme (10Wei G. Bai X.M. Sarkar A.K. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7857-7864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Bai X.M. Wei G. Sinha A. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13017-13024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Wild-type cells expressed robust activity at both temperatures (Fig. 3, solid bars). In contrast, the mutant had low activity at both temperatures compared with the wild type, but the values were significantly above background (i.e. the signal obtained in the absence of added acceptor; open bars). Somewhat higher activity was observed at 30 °C compared with 37 °C in several experiments, but this difference was not statistically significant due to variation in the assay. Attempts to stabilize the residual activity in the mutant by altering the concentration of substrates and cofactors were not successful, making further analysis of the enzyme difficult. Although enzyme activity was low in the mutant at permissive conditions, it could account for GAG biosynthesis. CHO cells produce about ∼1 μg of GAG/mg of cell protein, which is ∼50 pmol of GAG chains/mg of cell protein assuming on average ∼100 disaccharides/chain. Residual enzyme activity in the mutant was reported to be 0.2 pmol/min/mg cell protein (10Wei G. Bai X.M. Sarkar A.K. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7857-7864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Bai X.M. Wei G. Sinha A. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13017-13024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Given a generation time of ∼14 h, the mutant could generate about 0.2 pmol/min/mg × (60 min/h × 14 h) = ∼170 pmol of chains/mg cell protein, more than enough to account for the level of residual synthesis. In the wild type, GlcATI is expressed in large catalytic excess.Fig. 3Defective enzyme activity in pgsG cells. Wild-type and mutant cells were cultured at 30 °C, and cell homogenates were assayed for GlcATI activity at 30 and 37 °C. The open bars refer to samples assayed in the absence of added acceptor Galβ1,3Galβ-O-β-naphthalenemethanol (“Experimental Procedures”).

Surprisingly, GlcATI was not detected in pgsG cells (Fig. 4D), although α-mannosidase was detected (Fig. 4C). Similarly, we were not able to detect GlcATI in the mutant by Western blotting extracts prepared from the cells (data not shown).Fig. 4pgsG cells lack GlcATI. Wild-type (A and C) and pgsG (B and D) cells were incubated with anti-α-mannosidase II antibodies (A and B) or affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-GlcATI antibodies (C and D) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat ant-rabbit IgG antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To increase the level of expression of the mutant enzyme, chimeras were prepared containing the signal peptide from transin, the IgG-binding domain of protein A, and residues 30–335 of wild-type or mutant GlcATI (stem region and catalytic domain). Recombinant protein secreted into the medium was affinity-purified, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting. Expression of a chimera containing wild-type GlcATI yielded a band of the expected mass (68 kDa) and was detected both by silver staining and by Western blotting with anti-GlcATI polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 5). In contrast, the chimera containing the mutant form of GlcATI was not detectable by chemical or antibody staining. This experiment was repeated with chimeras consisting of the full-length forms of GlcATI fused on their C termini to GFP. The cells were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine, and samples were immunoprecipitated with antiserum to GFP. SDS-PAGE and autoradiography showed multiple bands brought down by the antiserum, with a particularly strongly labeled band in cells transfected with GFP fused to wild-type GlcATI (Fig. 6). This band was greatly reduced in cells transfected with mutant GlcATI-GFP. Instead, a protein migrating with a lower mass was observed (arrowhead,Fig. 6, left panel), suggesting that the fusion protein underwent proteolytic cleavage. Western blotting with anti-GFP or anti-GlcATI polyclonal sera confirmed that the cleavage product contained both GFP and a portion of GlcATI. These findings suggested that the mutation rendered GlcATI more susceptible to proteolysis, presumably resulting in its inactivation.Fig. 5A protein A-pgsG GlcATI fusion protein is not stable. Mutant and wild-type forms of GlcATI lacking their transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains were fused to the IgG binding domain of protein A and expressed in COS-7 cells (“Experimental Procedures”). The fusion proteins were affinity-purified from the conditioned medium using IgG-agarose beads and analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis. The gels were silver-stained or analyzed by Western blotting using rabbit polyclonal anti-GlcA T1 antibody. + and - refer to the orientation of GlcATI"
