https://openalex.org/W2003238569,"Some aquatic invertebrates such as shrimp contain low albeit stable numbers of bacteria in the circulating hemolymph. The proliferation of this hemolymph microbiota in such a nutrient-rich environment is tightly controlled in healthy animals, but the mechanisms responsible had remained elusive. In the present study, we report a C-type lectin (MjHeCL) from the kuruma shrimp (Marsupenaeus japonicus) that participates in restraining the hemolymph microbiota. Although the expression of MjHeCL did not seem to be modulated by bacterial challenge, the down-regulation of its expression by RNA interference led to proliferation of the hemolymph microbiota, ultimately resulting in shrimp death. This phenotype was rescued by the injection of recombinant MjHeCL, which restored the healthy status of the knockdown shrimp. A mechanistic analysis revealed that MjHeCL inhibited bacterial proliferation by modulating the expression of antimicrobial peptides. The key function of MjHeCL in the shrimp immune homeostasis might be related to its broader recognition spectrum of the hemolymph microbiota components than other lectins. Our study demonstrates the role of MjHeCL in maintaining the healthy status of shrimp and provides new insight into the biological significance of C-type lectins, a diversified and abundant lectin family in invertebrate species.

Healthy animals, vertebrates or invertebrates, host diverse bacterial communities as commensals or symbionts in the various microenvironments they provide, and significant progress has been achieved in recent years with regard to the mechanisms responsible for the establishment of such consortia (1.Duron O.

Hatton R.D. Weaver C.T. Reciprocal interactions of the intestinal microbiota and immune system.Nature. 2012; 489: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, the microbiota mostly resides on external surfaces, i.e. skin or cavities directly connected to the external environment such as the gut (2.Kamada N. Seo S.U. Chen G.Y. Núñez G. Role of the gut microbiota in immunity and inflammatory disease.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13: 321-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). In some healthy invertebrates such as shrimp, however, bacteria are not only present in the digestive tract but also in the circulating hemolymph (4.Fagutao F.F. Koyama T. Kaizu A. Saito-Taki T.

This observation has now been extended to other aquatic invertebrate species (5.Olafsen J.A. Mikkelsen H.V. Giaever H.M. Høvik Hansen G.

In shrimp, the hemolymph bacterial communities are present at relatively low numbers as compared with the gut microbiota and usually include species that can become opportunistic pathogens under stressful conditions such as those that may occur in the aquaculture context (4.Fagutao F.F.

However, the mechanism(s) that regulates homeostasis of the hemolymph microbiota is largely unknown, and the factor(s) that may inhibit its proliferation in such a nutrient-rich environment had remained elusive.

Among the diverse recognition and effector innate immune factors, lectins and antimicrobial peptides play key roles in sensing and controlling or eradicating any potential pathogens not only in invertebrates but also in most vertebrate species (15.Christophides G.K.

By binding to microbial surface glycans, including lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan, C-type lectins (CTLs) from invertebrate species effectively participate not only in the initial step of pathogen recognition via the carbohydrate recognition domain but also in various antimicrobial effector functions such as immobilization, phagocytosis, clearance, encapsulation, nodule formation, activation of the prophenoloxidase system/melanization, and others including direct antimicrobial activity (17.Rabinovich G.A. van Kooyk Y.

Thus, CTLs from invertebrates probably carry a heavier burden in pathogen recognition and the activation of pathways leading to antimicrobial effector functions than their vertebrate counterparts. This hypothesis is partially supported by the greater abundance and diversification of CTLs in invertebrates as compared with vertebrates (16.Zelensky A.N. Gready J.E.

Furthermore, based on our observations and those of others, a larger subset of the CTL proteins is soluble in insects and crustaceans than in mammals (27.Christophides G.K. Zdobnov E.

The humoral CTL repertoire in shrimp, constituted by at least 49 members as determined by a transcriptomic analysis, is highly expanded and diversified as compared with other invertebrate and vertebrate species. 3X.-W. Wang, J.-D. Xu, X.-F. Zhao, G. R. Vasta, and J.-X. Wang, unpublished data. In this study, we identified and characterized a CTL that is highly expressed in the hemocytes and present in plasma of the kuruma shrimp (Marsupenaeus japonicus), a species of high commercial value, and that we named MjHeCL for M. japonicus hemocyte C-type lectin. Although MjHeCL expression was not affected by microbial challenge, silencing its expression by RNA interference (RNAi) caused uncontrolled bacterial proliferation in the hemolymph and death of the shrimp. A functional study revealed that the activity of MjHeCL was based on its ability to modulate the expression of AMPs. Healthy kuruma shrimp (M. japonicus) with an average weight of 6–7 g each were obtained from an aquaculture farm in Rizhao, Shandong, China; acclimated in aerated artificial seawater (30 parts per thousand) at 20 °C for a week prior to use; and fed daily with a commercial shrimp diet. Vibrio anguillarum (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 43305) and Vibrio harveyi (ATCC 33842) were obtained from the Marine College, Shandong University (Weihai, China), cultured overnight in Luria-Bertani medium (3% NaCl), collected by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 3 min, washed by sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) thrice, resuspended in PBS, and plated for colony counting, and the bacterial suspension was adjusted to 2 × 106 CFU/ml. Fifty microliters of the bacterial suspension were injected into each shrimp intramuscularly at the fourth abdominal segment with similar mock PBS injections in the control shrimp. Hemolymph was drawn from the ventral sinus at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h postchallenge (at least six shrimp at each time point) using a sterile syringe fitted with a 26-gauge needle and collected into precooled anticoagulant (450 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.45) at a ratio of 1:1. The hemolymph was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min, and total RNA was extracted from the hemocyte pellet using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plasma supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 140,000 × g for 2 h to remove most of the hemocyanin and concentrated in an ultracentrifugal filter (Millipore). The hemocytes and plasma from unchallenged shrimp were collected and processed at the same time points as controls. Semiquantitative RT-PCR was used to study the tissue distribution and abundance of MjHeCL transcripts. A pair of specific primers was designed to amplify a 141-bp fragment (Table 1) with β-actin amplified as the reference gene. The PCR amplification protocol consisted of an initial 94 °C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles (22 cycles for β-actin) of 94 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s and a final 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose and stained by ethidium bromide.TABLE 1Primers used in the present studyPrimersSequence (5′–3′)(q)RT-PCRMjHeCLRTFACGCTGGTGTGATGCCCGMjHeCLRTRACCGAGTCTGAGCCGCCTAAActinRTFCAGCCTTCCTTCCTGGGTATGGActinRTRGAGGGAGCGAGGGCAGTGATTAlf1RTFCGGTGGTGGCCCTGGTGGCACTCTTCGAlf1RTRGACTGGCTGCGTGTGCTGGCTTCCCCTCAlf4RTFCGCTTCAAGGGTCGGATGTGAlf4RTRCGAGCCTCTTCCTCCGTGATGAlf5RTFCTGGTCGGTTTCCTGGTGGCAlf5RTRCCAACCTGGGCACCACATACTGAlf6RTFTCCTGGTGGTGGCAGTGGCTAlf6RTRTGCGGGTCTCGGCTTCTCCTAlf8RTFCGCAGGCTTATGGAGGACAlf8RTRAGGTGACAGTGCCGAGGAAlf9RTFTGCCGTGTTCTCCTGCTTATAlf9RTRTTGGTGGGATTCGTGTGGTPen2RTFAGGCGAGGAGAAAATCAAPen2RTRAGAGAAGAAGCAACTACCAATCcLysRTFTTGCGGAGTTGCTGGAGAcLysRTRTTCGGTATCACGGCGGAiLys1RTFTACTGGATGGACGGCGGiLys1RTRATTCGGCATTAGGTGGTGGCru4RTFCAAGCCCTCCACCACTCTCGCru4RTRTTCCTGGGTTGCGGTCACACru11RTFGCGTTTTCGTCTTCGTCCTGCru11RTRAATGATTGGTGGTTTCACGGTAGRNAiMjHeCL RNAiFGCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTCCTGACGACTTCTTCCTMjHeCL RNAiRGCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGACTCGCACTGACGCAATGFPRNAiFGCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGTGGTCCCAATTCTCGTGGAACGFPRNAiRGCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGCTTGAAGTTGACCTTGATGCCAlf4RNAiFGCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGATCTCGCTCTACAGCAACGAlf4RNAiRGCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGCATCTGATACCACGACCTTTAlf5RNAiFGCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGCAGTCAGCGGCGGAGAAAlf5RNAiRGCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGCTGCGTAAAACAAACACCCAlf6RNAiFGCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGAGTGGCTGCGTCCTTCAlf6RNAiRGCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGATTATTTCATTGAGTTGGTCPen2RNAiFGCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGTCATCTGGCTCCTACGGPen2RNAiRGCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGTCTTTTTTTCACAAGCATTTRecombinant expressionMjHeCLYEFTACTCAGAATTCAAGGTATCCTGTCCTGACMjHeCLYERTACTCAGCGGCCGCTTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGATTAAATGCCTCCACTATGMjHeCLEFCCGGAATTCAAGGTATCCTGTCCTGACMjHeCLERCCCAAGCTTTTAATTAAATGCCTCCACMjCL1EFCCGGAATTCAACCACACGCCCACAGAAMjCL1ERCCCAAGCTTTTATGAGGGTTCCACTTGMjCL2EFCCGGAATTCAGCGTTCGTTCTAACGAGMjCL2ERCCCAAGCTTTTAATAATTCTTGAGGCAMjCL3EFCCGGAATTCTGTCCAGATGGCTTCTTTMjCL3ERCCCAAGCTTTCAGCTGGACTTAGCCCTMjCL4EFCCGGAATTCTGCGAGATCGGATGGGTAMjCL4ERCCCAAGCTTTTAGAGCATCATGCAGAGMjCL5EFCCGGAATTCAAGTGCACGGCGCCCTTCMjCL5ERCCCAAGCTTGAAGGTGTCCGGGCTGAAMjCL6EFCCGGAATTCTCCCACATGACGGCCGAGMjCL6ERCCCAAGCTTGTCTCCGCCATGTTATTTMjCL7EFCCGGAATTCTCGGAGGCCTCCAGAGGCMjCL7ERCCCAAGCTTTGATCATCCATGATAAACMjCL8EFCCGGAATTCCAACAACCTGATAACGCAMjCL8ERCCCAAGCTTTTACGTCACCTGCGCCCACGTMjCL9EFCCGGAATTCAAACAAGACTGGGCGTCAMjCL9ERCCCAAGCTTGCTTTATTTCTGGCAAAG16 S rRNA amplification27FAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG1492RGGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT Open table in a new tab Quantitative changes of MjHeCL expression were assessed by real time PCR (qRT-PCR) in a CFX96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad) using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and the same primers as for semiquantitative RT-PCR. PCR was performed with an initial 94 °C for 3 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s and 60 °C for 1 min, and then a melt period from 65 to 95 °C. Results were processed by using a 2−ΔΔCt method by which the data were normalized in two steps. First, the expression of the gene of interest (MjHeCL) was normalized to that of the reference gene (β-actin) in the same sample. Second, the relative expression of the gene in the experimental shrimp sample was normalized to that in the control shrimp sample. Results were expressed as the mean ± S.D. from three independent repeats. The expression of the antimicrobial peptides was evaluated with the primers listed in Table 1 using a similar strategy as for MjHeCL. MjHeCL levels in shrimp plasma were assessed by Western blot in both challenged and control animals. Plasma proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in 12.5% gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking in nonfat milk (5% in PBS) for 1 h, the membrane was immersed in rabbit anti-MjHeCL antiserum (1:200 in blocking milk) overnight. The membrane was washed thrice with PBST (0.02% Tween 20) and incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (1:10,000 in blocking milk; Zhongshan, Beijing, China) for 3 h. After three washes with PBST, the protein bands were visualized by oxidation of 4-chloro-1-naphthol. A 597-bp MjHeCL fragment was amplified by PCR with the specific primers linked to the T7 promoter (Table 1). The resulting DNA was used as the template to synthesize dsRNA using an in vitro transcription T7 kit (Takara) following the manufacturer's instructions. GFP dsRNA was synthesized as the control. Each shrimp was injected with 10 μg of dsRNA (MjHeCL or GFP), and hemolymph was collected at 24, 48, and 72 h postchallenge (at least three shrimp per time point for experimental samples and controls). RNAi efficiency was assessed by RT-PCR on total RNAs from hemocytes and by Western blot on plasma. RNAi for the AMPs was performed in the same way as for MjHeCL using the primers listed in Table 1. Primary cultures of shrimp hemocytes were established by separating the cells from plasma by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min and resuspending the cells in Leibovitz L-15 medium (Sangon, Shanghai, China) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 5% shrimp plasma (collected without anticoagulant and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min to obtain the supernatant), 1 g/liter glucose, 2 g/liter NaCl, 0.3 g/liter glutamine, 0.1 mg/liter vitamin C, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. The hemocyte suspensions (5 × 105 cells/ml) were distributed in 6-well plates at 2 ml/well and incubated at 28 °C for 12 h. Two micrograms of dsRNA (for MjHeCL and for GFP as control) and 5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) were mixed with 250 μl of serum-free medium, respectively, incubated separately for 5 min, mixed together, incubated for an additional 20 min, and added to serum-free medium (1.5 ml). The final mixture was added to each well after removing the initial culture medium, incubated for 10 h, and replaced by serum-containing medium (2 ml). Total RNA was extracted 24 h later to evaluate expression of the target genes in both experimental and control (GFP dsRNA) wells. Shrimp were randomly divided into three groups with 30 animals in each group. In the first group, each shrimp was injected with 10 μg of MjHeCL dsRNA, 10 μg of GFP dsRNA was injected in the second group, and PBS was injected in the third group. The numbers of dead shrimp were recorded for each group daily for 3 days, and survival rates were calculated at 72 h postinjection. Hemolymph from experimental and control shrimp was collected as described above and immediately mixed with an equal volume of sterile anticoagulant buffer. One hundred microliters of each mixture were plated onto a modified 2216E agar plate (0.5% tryptone, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.01% FeCl3, 2.4% sea salt, and 1.5% agar). The plates were placed at 28 °C for 36 h, and the colony counts were recorded for each plate. To ensure that any proliferating bacteria in shrimp hemolymph originated in the endogenous microbiota, ampicillin and kanamycin were added to the culture water to a final concentration of 25 mg/liter to generate an axenic environment. To exclude the potential interference of the endogenous microbiota on the expression of AMPs, each shrimp was injected with ampicillin and kanamycin (25 μg each/animal) to generate axenic animals. For expression of the recombinant MjHeCL in yeast, the fragment corresponding to the mature MjHeCL was amplified with the primers shown in Table 1 and cloned into the pPIC9k vector (Invitrogen). The recombinant plasmid was linearized with SacI (New England Biolabs) and transformed into the Pichia pastoris GS115 cells by electroporation. The transformants were screened with the histidine-deficient minimal dextrose medium. Positive transformants were inoculated into BMGY medium (1% yeast extract, 2% tryptone, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base, 4 × 10−5% biotin, 1% glycerol, and 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0) and cultured at 30 °C for 18 h and transferred into BMMY medium (1% yeast extract, 2% tryptone, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base, 4 × 10−5% biotin, 0.5% methanol, and 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0) for protein induction. Methanol was supplemented into the medium to a final concentration of 0.5% (w/v) every 24 h for 3 days. The culture supernatant (600 ml) was collected by centrifugation and applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid His-Bind resin column (Novagen). The recombinant protein was eluted by 250 mm imidazole in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 and 300 mm NaCl. The eluted protein was dialyzed in PBS thrice at 4 °C to remove the imidazole. Protein concentrations were determined by the standard Bradford method with BSA as the control and adjusted to 200 μg/ml. After being filtered through a sterile 0.45-μm filter, the protein was stored at −80 °C with 5% glycerol (v/v). The bacterial expression of recombinant MjHeCL and other shrimp CTLs (MjCL1–9) was performed according to the standard method using the pET32a(+) (Novagen) vector and Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) cells (primers are listed in Table 1). The recombinant proteins were purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid His-Bind column. Potential endotoxin contaminants were removed by adding an additional wash before final elution with 0.1% Triton X-114 (Sigma) in the wash buffer (50× column volume) at 4 °C (29.Reichelt P. Schwarz C. Donzeau M. Single step protocol to purify recombinant proteins with low endotoxin contents.Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 46: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins were processed and stored following the protocol described above. The recombinant MjHeCL (rMjHeCL-tag) was expressed in bacteria, purified, and concentrated to 3 mg/ml with an ultracentrifugal filter. Equal volumes of rMjHeCL-tag solution (1 ml) and complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma) were mixed thoroughly and injected into a New Zealand White rabbit. The injection was repeated 25 days later with a similar rMjHeCL-tag inoculum but mixed with incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Periodic bleeds were tested for anti-MjHeCL titer and specificity, and after the kill bleed, the anti-MjHeCL antiserum was stored at −80 °C for further use. The bacteria present in the shrimp hemolymph were isolated and characterized by 16 S rRNA. The bacteria growing in plates corresponding to the experimental and control shrimp from the experiment described above were selected based on colony morphology, isolated, and grown as individual cultures in 2216E medium at 30 °C overnight. From each culture the 16 S rRNA was amplified using the standard primers (Table 1) and sequenced for species identification. The remaining bacterial cultures were used for MjHeCL binding assays and stored at −80 °C. To test whether MjHeCL could bind to bacteria, a preliminary study was carried out with a Vibrio spp. isolated from shrimp hemolymph. An overnight bacterial culture was harvested as described above and resuspended in PBS. The binding was performed by incubating the rMjHeCL-tag (expressed in bacteria; 4 μg) with the selected bacteria (108 CFU) in 1 ml of PBS. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 1 h with gentle rotation. The bacteria were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 3 min and washed thrice with PBST. The resultant bacterial pellet was resuspended in PBS, processed for SDS-PAGE by adding regular sample buffer and heating at 100 °C for 5 min, and subjected to Western blot. rMjHeCL-tag that bound to the bacteria was detected by an antibody specific for the pET32a(+) tag. Negative controls consisted in replacing the rMjHeCL-tag by the pET32a(+) tag. To determine whether calcium was necessary for the binding, a similar experiment was carried out with either CaCl2 (5 mm), EDTA (5 mm), or both added to the mixture of bacteria and rMjHeCL-tag. After the preliminary experiments revealed that rMjHeCL could bind to Vibrio spp., all other bacterial isolates from shrimp hemolymph were tested similarly to determine the binding spectrum of rMjHeCL and other recombinant shrimp CTLs (MjCL1–9). The authentic MjHeCL was also tested to examine whether it exhibited binding behavior similar to that of the rMjHeCL. For this, ∼107 hemocytes were resuspended in 1.5 ml of PBS and sonicated at 300 Hz for 5 min. The hemocyte lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant (1 ml) was used as the source of native MjHeCL. Bound proteins were detected with an antibody specific for the tag (for recombinant proteins) or the anti-MjHeCL antibody (for the native MjHeCL). The bacteria isolated from the shrimp hemolymph and recognized by MjHeCL were used to determine whether MjHeCL possesses antibacterial activity. The bacterial strain suspensions were prepared as described above, adjusting their concentration to 106 CFU/ml. To assess the antibacterial activity of MjHeCL, 10 μl of the bacterial suspension were incubated with 2 μg of rMjHeCL for 2 h at 25 °C. The mixture was then introduced to 200 μl of fresh LB medium (3% NaCl) and cultured at 25 °C for 24 h. The A600 of each sample was recorded as a measure of bacterial growth. The antimicrobial activity of plasma was evaluated after the initial centrifugation of hemolymph at 800 × g for 10 min to separate it from the hemocytes followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min to obtain a clear supernatant. Equal volumes (10 μl) of the supernatant and bacterial suspension were mixed and placed at 25 °C for 1 h. The mixtures were plated onto LB (3% NaCl for V. harveyi) agar plates and cultured at 30 (V. harveyi) or 37 °C (Micrococcus luteus) for 30 h, and the colony counts were recorded. Results were expressed as the mean ± S.D. derived from three independent repeats. Phenotypes (AMP expression, bacterial prolif"

Inducible cyclooxygenase (COX) isoform COX-2 has been involved in the pathogenesis of such chronic inflammatory diseases. We found that the active form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D produces dose-dependent inhibition of COX-2 expression in murine macrophages under both basal and LPS-stimulated conditions and suppresses proinflammatory mediators induced by LPS. Administration of 1,25(OH)2D significantly alleviated local inflammation in a carrageenan-induced paw edema mouse model. Strikingly, the phosphorylation of both Akt and its downstream target IκBα in macrophages were markedly suppressed by 1,25(OH)2D in the presence and absence of LPS stimulation through up-regulation of THEM4 (thioesterase superfamily member 4), an Akt modulator protein. Knockdown of both vitamin D receptor and THEM4 attenuated the inhibitory effect of 1,25(OH)2D on COX-2 expression in macrophages. A functional vitamin D-responsive element in the THEM4 promoter was identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assay. Our results indicate that vitamin D restrains macrophage-mediated inflammatory processes by suppressing the Akt/NF-κB/COX-2 pathway, suggesting that vitamin D supplementation might be utilized for adjunctive therapy for inflammatory disease."
https://openalex.org/W2117122073,"In gram-negative bacteria, the assembly of outer membrane proteins (OMPs) requires a β-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) complex, of which BamA is an essential and evolutionarily conserved component. To elucidate the mechanism of BamA-mediated OMP biogenesis, we determined the crystal structure of the C-terminal transmembrane domain of BamA from Escherichia coli (EcBamA) at 2.6 Å resolution. The structure reveals 2 distinct features. First, a portion of the extracellular side of the β barrel is composed of 5 markedly short β strands, and the loops stemming from these β strands form a potential surface cavity, filled by a portion of the L6 loop that includes the conserved VRGF/Y motif found in the Omp85 family. Second, the 4 extracellular loops L3, L4, L6, and L7 of EcBamA form a dome over the barrel, stabilized by a salt-bridge interaction network. Functional data show that hydrophilic-to-hydrophobic mutations of the potential hydrophilic surface cavity and a single Arg547Ala point mutation that may destabilize the dome severely affect the function of EcBamA. Our structure of the EcBamA β barrel and structure-based mutagenesis studies suggest that the transmembrane β strands of OMP substrates may integrate into the outer membrane at the interface of the first and last β strands of the EcBamA barrel, whereas the soluble loops or domains may be transported out of the cell via the hydrophilic surface cavity on dislocation of the VRGF/Y motif of L6. In addition, the dome over the barrel may play an important role in maintaining the efficiency of OMP biogenesis.—Ni, D., Wang, Y., Yang, X., Zhou, H., Hou, X., Cao, B., Lu, Z., Zhao, X., Yang, K., Huang, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2044822127,"According to the ""amyloid cascade"" hypothesis of Alzheimer disease, the formation of Aβ fibrils and senile plaques in the brain initiates a cascade of events leading to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, neurodegeneration, and the symptom of dementia. Recently, however, emphasis has shifted away from amyloid fibrils as the predominant toxic form of Aβ toward smaller aggregates, referred to as ""soluble oligomers."" These oligomers have become one of the prime suspects for involvement in the early oxidative damage that is evident in this disease. This raises the question whether or not Aβ fibrils are actually ""inert tombstones"" present at the end of the aggregation process. Here we show that, when Aβ(1-42) aggregates, including fibrils, are bound to Cu(II) ions, they retain their redox activity and are able to degrade hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) with the formation of hydroxyl radicals and the consequent oxidation of the peptide (detected by formation of carbonyl groups). We find that this ability increases as the Cu(II):peptide ratio increases and is accompanied by changes in aggregate morphology, as determined by atomic force microscopy. When aggregates are prepared in the copresence of Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions, the ratio of Cu(II):Zn(II) becomes an important factor in the degeneration of H2O2, the formation of carbonyl groups in the peptide, and in aggregate morphology. We believe, therefore, that Aβ fibrils can destroy H2O2 and generate damaging hydroxyl radicals and, so, are not necessarily inert end points."

In this study, we show that this hyperacetylation is a common response to several cellular stresses that involves the stimulation of the major tubulin acetyltransferase MEC-17. We also demonstrate that the acetyltransferase p300 negatively regulates MEC-17 expression and is sequestered on microtubules upon stress. We further show that reactive oxygen species of mitochondrial origin are required for microtubule hyperacetylation by activating the AMP kinase, which in turn mediates MEC-17 phosphorylation upon stress. Finally, we show that preventing microtubule hyperacetylation by knocking down MEC-17 affects cell survival under stress conditions and starvation-induced autophagy, thereby pointing out the importance of this rapid modification as a broad cell response to stress."

Xylans are the major hemicellulose components in the plant cell wall and account for nearly one-third of all renewable organic carbon source on earth (1.Collins T. Gerday C.

Ulvskov P. et al.Hemicelluloses.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2010; 61: 263-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (1830) Google Scholar). Xylans are heteropolysaccharides composed of β-1,4-glycosidic bond-linked xylose units as a backbone chain that is usually decorated by different side groups such as methyl group, acetyl group, and other sugar molecules (1.Collins T.

Due to its structural complexity, a set of enzymes is required for complete xylan decomposition, including endo-1,4-β-xylanase, β-xylosidase, acetylxylan esterase, arabinase, and α-glucuronidase (3.Subramaniyan S.

Among them, the glycoside hydrolase endo-1,4-xylanase (xylanase, EC 3.2.1.8) is the key enzyme that catalyzes random hydrolysis of the xylan backbone to small fragments by cleaving the β-1,4-glycosidic bonds (1.Collins T.

These biotechnological treatments usually involve harsh conditions and demand enzymes with good thermostability, broad pH adaptability, and high specific activity. Therefore, numerous research projects have been carried out in search of novel xylanases with favorable properties and to improve performance of available enzymes via direct evolution or rational design approaches. To date, various xylanases have been identified from bacteria, fungi, yeasts, plants, and insects (8.Paës G. Berrin J.G. Beaugrand J. et al.GH11 xylanases.

In terms of biotechnological applications, GH11 xylanases have drawn much attention due to their small sizes, high substrate selectivities, and wide ranges of pH and temperature adaptability (9.Biely P.

To date nearly a thousand GH11 xylanases have been characterized from various species, but only 26 structures from bacteria and fungi have been solved (CAZy database). Among them, several are thermophilic/thermostable enzymes, including Dictyoglomus thermophilum XynB (optimal temperature 75 °C) (10.McCarthy A.A. Morris D.D. Bergquist P.L.

The catalytic domain of the enzyme (Xyn-CD) exerts optimal activity at pH 6.0, and an alkalophilic mutant XynCDBFV with seven amino acid substitutions was later created via direct evolution using error-prone PCR (16.Chen Y.L.

The recombinant XynCDBFV protein is among the highest active xylanases and possesses an optimal temperature of 65 °C, broad pH adaptability, and remarkable tolerance at pH 10.0 when expressed in E. coli. Therefore, the XynCDBFV is an attractive candidate to be developed as an industrial product. In the present study the recombinant XynCDBFV was expressed in the industrial strain P. pastoris and crystallized. The overall protein fold and ligand complex structure are analyzed in detail. Based on these data, potential factors contributing to the enzyme thermostability are proposed. The synthesized gene encoding XynCDBFV, an engineered mutant of Xyn-CD from N. patriciarum (GenBankTM accession number AF123252) (16.Chen Y.L. Tang T.Y.

The gene was then cloned into the vector pPICZαA for the P. pastoris system by EcoRI and NotI to yield pPICZαA/xynCDBFV. The substituted mutants including E109A, C4A, C172A, and C4A/C172A were prepared by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent) with pPICZαA/xynCDBFV as the template. The genes encoding the deleted mutants of Δ6 (deletion of Gln-1–Ser-6) and Δ11 (deletion of Gln-1–Gly-11) were generated by PCR with full-length xynCDBFV gene as the template. These truncated genes were then cloned into the vector pPICZαA by using EcoRI and NotI to yield pPICZαA/xynCDBFV-Δ6 and pPICZαA/xynCDBFV-Δ11. The sequences of the mutated primers are listed in the supplemental Table S1. Alternatively, the xynCDBFV gene was amplified by using PCR and cloned into the vector pET32 Xa/LIC for E. coli expression system. This vector has designed a His tag before the N terminus of targeted gene for purification purpose. The specific primers used here were 5′-GGTATTGAGGGTCGCCAAAGTTTCTGTAGTTCAGCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGAGGAGAGTTAGAGCCTTAATCACCAATGTAAACCTTTGC-3′ (reverse). These above plasmids, except pET32 Xa/LIC-xynCDBFV, were linearized by PmeI and then individually transformed into X33 strain of P. pastoris by electroporation. The transformants were selected on the YPD (yeast extract peptone dextrose) plates containing 100 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen). The selected clones were inoculated and amplified in 50 ml of buffered glycerol-complex medium (BMGY; 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base (YNB) with ammonium sulfate without amino acids, 4× 10–5% biotin, and 1% glycerol) at 30 °C for 1 day. Then the culture medium of cultured cells was replaced by 20 ml of buffered methanol-complex medium (BMMY; 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base (YNB) with ammonium sulfate without amino acids, 4× 10–5% biotin, and 0.5% methanol) to induce protein expression. For protein purification, the supernatants were collected and dialyzed twice against the buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5. In addition, the proteins were treated by endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs) during the dialysis procedure. The proteins were then purified by FPLC system using diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) column (GE Healthcare) and eluted using a linear gradient of 0–250 mm NaCl in the buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The purified proteins were finally concentrated to 10 mg/ml in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl by using Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units (Millipore), and the purity (>95%) was checked by SDS-PAGE. On the other hand the pET32 Xa/LIC-xynCDBFV plasmid was transformed into BL21 (DE3) strain of E. coli. Then the transformed cells were propagated and induced by adding isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for protein expression. The protein was purified by FPLC system using a nickel nitriloacetic acid column. The His-tagged protein was eluted using a gradient of 0–250 mm imidazole in the buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. The eluted protein was then dialyzed against the buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, with Factor Xa enzyme to remove the His tag. The mixture was loaded onto another nickel nitriloacetic acid column, and the untagged protein was eluted in the buffer without imidazole for purification of untagged protein. The eluted protein was then dialyzed against the buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, for the DEAE column. Next, the purified protein was eluted using a gradient of 0–250 mm NaCl in the 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, for the DEAE column. The purified proteins were finally concentrated to 10 mg/ml in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and the purity was checked by SDS-PAGE. The XynCDBFV and E109A proteins were crystallized by using sitting-drop vapor diffusion method and Crystal Screen kit (Hampton Research). The XynCDBFV protein crystals were obtained from the reservoir solution containing 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5, and 2 m ammonium sulfate at room temperature for 1 day. The E109A protein crystals were obtained from the reservoir solution containing 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, 26% PEG8000, and 5% glycerol at room temperature for 2 days. The hexagonal E109A-xylotriose-bound crystal was prepared by soaking with 10 mm xylotriose (Megazyme) in the reservoir solution for 1 h. The cryoprotectants for XynCDBFV and E109A crystals contained 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5, 2 m ammonium sulfate and 10% glycerol and 0.12 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 0.24 m ammonium sulfate, 31% PEG8000, and 5% glycerol, respectively. All of the x-ray diffraction data were collected at beam line BL13B1 of National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center in Hsinchu, Taiwan.

Chem. 2002; 374: 80-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In general, the protein solution in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.3, with a proper concentration was mixed with 1% xylan substrate (beechwood, Sigma) in the proportion of 1 to 9 and then incubated at 55 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 1% dinitrosalicylic acid solution and incubated at 100 °C in boiling water for 10 min. The absorbance of A540 nm was measured for calculation of the enzyme activity. The standard curve for calibrating the enzyme activity was determined by 0–0.6 mg/ml xylose solutions. One unit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that releases 1 μmol of reducing sugar equivalent to xylose per minute. The crystal structure of XynCDBFV was solved to a resolution of 1.27 Å by molecular replacement using the Xyn11X from B. subtilis B230 as a search model. The data collection and refinement statistics of the wild type, E109A mutant (<0.2% activity, data not shown), and its complex with xylotriose (XTI, E109A-XTI) structures are listed in Table 1. The root mean square deviations (r.m.s.d.) of Cα atoms between XynCDBFV and the E109A mutant is 0.374 Å, indicating that the mutation did not cause a significant alteration in the protein structure. To investigate whether the ligand binding could cause significant conformational change, the ligand-free (XynCDBFV and E109A mutant) and ligand-bound (E109A-XTI) structures were superimposed. The r.m.s.d. between these structures ranged from 0.192 to 0.436 Å for all Cα atoms, suggesting that the ligand binding did not result in significant conformational change. As shown in Fig. 1A, the protein structure of XynCDBFV displays a β-jelly-roll fold, which is typical of GH11 family enzymes. It comprises two anti-parallel β-sheets, linked by interconnecting loops and α-helices. The topology of GH11 enzymes is also described as the shape of a right hand (27.Törrönen A. Harkki A. Rouvinen J. et al.Three-dimensional structure of endo-1,4-β-xylanase II from Trichoderma reesei. Two conformational states in the active site.EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2493-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The two β-sheets mimic the palm and fingers, whereas the loop β12-β13 is like a thumb. As shown in Fig. 1B, there are two disulfide bridges in the XynCDBFV structure, including DS1 (Cys-4–Cys-172), which connects the N-terminal α1 helix to the strand β14, and DS2 (Cys-50–Cys-60), which joins the strand β5 to the strand β6. The tunnel-like active site cleft (Fig. 1C) is formed by the curved inner β-sheet consisting of β2, β3, β6, β15, β8, β9, β10, β12, and β13 strands (Fig. 1, A and C). The catalytic residues Glu-109 and Glu-202 predicted from sequence alignment of GH11 xylanases were found embedded in this region and located on the strand β10 and β15, respectively (Fig. 1, A and D). The electron density maps in the tunnel-like cleft of the E109A-XTI structure clearly indicated the presence of three β-1,4-linked xylosyl moieties in the +1 to +3 subsites and two in the −2 to −3 subsites (Fig. 2A). The sugar molecules were modeled into the wild-type XynCDBFV to display the detailed interactions between the substrates and the surrounding residues (Fig. 2B). Trp-32 and Trp-125 provide stacking forces to sugar units in the subsites −2 and +3, respectively. Trp-32 further forms a hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl group of the −3 sugar. Glu-30, Arg-61, and Tyr-100 form hydrogen bonds to the −2 sugar unit. Asp-57, Tyr-94, Tyr-111, Arg-148, Gln-161, and Glu-202 (one of catalytic residues) form hydrogen bonds to sugar moiety in the +1 subsite. Arg-148 also forms a hydrogen bond to the +2 sugar unit. The −1 sugar moiety was not observed from our crystal structure, but the subsite can be predicted from the superimposition of the XynCDBFV-XTI model and the complex structure of XynII from Trichoderma reesei (PDB code 4HK9) (28.Wan Q. Zhang Q. Hamilton-Brehm S. Weiss K. Mustyakimov M. Coates L. Langan P. Graham D. Kovalevsky A. et al.X-ray crystallographic studies of family 11 xylanase Michaelis and product complexes. Implications for the catalytic mechanism.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2014; 70: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The superimposition indicates that several residues might participate in the −1 subsite formation including Asp-57, Arg-148, Pro-151, and Gln-161 along with two catalytic residues, Glu-109 and Glu-202 (Fig. 2C). Among these ligand-interacting residues, Trp-32, Tyr-100, Tyr-111, Gln-161, and Pro-151 are strictly conserved in GH11 xylanase, indicating their vital roles in catalytic reactions. From protein sequence alignment and structure superimposition, we found that XynCDBFV carries an extended N-terminal region (NTR) that is unique in the GH11 family (Fig. 3, A and B). The NTR is composed of 11 amino acids and spans the convex side of the palm β-sheet, whereas other GH11 enzymes start from the strand β1 or β2 (Fig. 3B). There are several interactions formed between the NTR and the nearby β-strands including β4, β5, β14, β16, and β17 (Fig. 3C). Two stacking interactions are formed between NTR-Phe-3 and β17-Tyr-218 and between NTR-His-9 and β4-Tyr-43 (Fig. 3C). NTR-His-9 is also at a hydrogen bonding distance to β5-Ser-47 and β16-Asp-215. Notably, NTR-Cys-4 forms the DS1 disulfide bond with β14-Cys-172. Through these interactions, the NTR is stably attached to the catalytic core of XynCDBFV instead of hanging freely as a flexible segment. To investigate the functional significance of NTR, we constructed the NTR-truncated mutants, including Δ6 (Gln-1–Ser-6 deletion) and Δ11 (Gln-1–Gly-11 deletion) (Fig. 4A), and analyzed their performance. As shown in Fig. 4B, the enzymatic activities of mutants Δ6 and Δ11 were reduced to 80.9 and 61.5% at 55 °C, respectively, compared with the wild-type protein. Remarkably, the variations between wild-type and mutant enzymes were even larger at higher temperatures. As the wild-type XynCDBFV showed enhanced activity at 65 °C (140%) and 75 °C (151.8%), the relative activities of Δ6 and Δ11 were reduced to 33.7 and 20.7% at 65 °C and 21 and 19.6% at 75 °C (Fig. 4B). These results clearly demonstrated that the NTR plays a role in the catalytic activity of XynCDBFV, and its presence is especially important for the enzyme to exert thermophilic functions. As mentioned, there is a disulfide bond DS1 formed between the NTR and strand β14. To further investigate the role of the DS1 linkage, mutants C4A, C172A, and C4A/C172A were constructed. Similar to the results of the NTR-truncated mutants, the DS1-removed mutants showed lower activities comparing to the wild-type enzyme at 55 °C, and their activities further declined when the tested temperature was increased to 65 °C (39.3–44.8%) and 75 °C (20.8–23.3%) (Fig. 4C). Protein expression levels of all mutants were similar to that of wild type (data not shown). These results suggested that the NTR is important for the catalytic activity and is an essential element for thermophilicity of XynCDBFV, and its function is highly dependent on the presence of disulfide bond DS1. In the beginning we tried to use E. coli-expressed protein (E-XynCDBFV) for structural study because the E. coli expression system is easier to handle than P. pastoris expression system. The E-XynCDBFV was easily expressed and purified but failed to be crystallized despite the protein being catalytically active (Table 2) . When the purified proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis, the E-XynCDBFV formed a significant amount of dimer and trimer in the absence of reducing agent, suggesting the presence of one or more free Cys residues on the protein surface (Fig. 5) . Reducing agent was supplemented during E-XynCDBFV crystallization to prevent formation of nonspecific disulfide bonds, but no crystal was obtained. However, the crystal structure solved in this study indicated that the four Cys residues in XynCDBFV form two pairs of disulfide bonds, and there is no free thiol group exposed to the bulk solvent. Indeed, the recombinant P-XynCDBFV, which was successfully crystallized, showed much less tendency of dimer formation (Fig. 5).TABLE 2Specific activity of XynCDBFV expressed in E. coli and P. pastorisSpecific activity at pH 5.355 °C65 °C75 °Cunits/mgE. coli4009.7 ± 115.6 (82 ± 2.4%)5747.6 ± 270.2 (117.5 ± 5.5%)5778.3 ± 73.0 (118.2 ± 1.5%)P. pastoris4889.9 ± 218.3 (100 ± 4.5%)7611.6 ± 382.4 (155.7 ± 7.8%)7995.3 ± 178.6 (163.5 ± 3.7%)"
https://openalex.org/W2024113992,"Generalized trust refers to trust in other members of society; it may be distinguished from particularized trust, which corresponds to trust in the family and close friends. An extensive empirical literature has established that generalized trust is an important aspect of civic culture. It has been linked to a variety of positive outcomes at the individual level, such as entrepreneurship, volunteering, self-rated health, and happiness. However, two recent studies have found that it is highly correlated with intelligence, which raises the possibility that the other relationships in which it has been implicated may be spurious. Here we replicate the association between intelligence and generalized trust in a large, nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. We also show that, after adjusting for intelligence, generalized trust continues to be strongly associated with both self-rated health and happiness. In the context of substantial variation across countries, these results bolster the view that generalized trust is a valuable social resource, not only for the individual but for the wider society as well."
https://openalex.org/W2088735264,"There is rapidly-emerging evidence on the harmful health effects of sedentary behaviors. The aim of this paper was to quantify time in sedentary behaviors and document socio-demographic variations in different life domains among adults.A population-based survey was carried out in 2012 through face-to-face interviews with Brazilian adults aged 20+ years (N = 2,927). Information about time spent sedentary in a typical weekday was collected for five different domains (workplace, commuting, school/university, watching TV, and computer use at home). Descriptive and bivariate analyses examined variations in overall and domain-specific sedentary time by gender, age, educational attainment and socioeconomic position.On average, participants reported spending 5.8 (SD 4.5) hours per day sitting. The median value was 4.5 (interquartile range: 2.5-8) hours. Men, younger adults, those with higher schooling and from the wealthiest socioeconomic groups had higher overall sedentary scores. TV time was higher in women, older adults and among those with low schooling and socioeconomic position. Sedentary time in transport was higher in men, younger adults, and participants with high schooling and high socioeconomic position. Computer use at home was more frequent among young adults and those from high socioeconomic groups. Sitting at work was higher in those with higher schooling and from the wealthiest socioeconomic groups. Sedentary behavior at school was related inversely to age and directly to schooling.Patterns of sedentary behavior are different by life domains. Initiatives to reduce prolonged sitting among Brazilian adults will be required on multiple levels for different life domains."

The known diversity of the group has dramatically increased in recent years with new finds, but overall understanding of tyrannosaurid ecology and evolution is based almost entirely on fossils from latitudes at or below southern Canada and central Asia. Remains of a new, relatively small tyrannosaurine were recovered from the earliest Late Maastrichtian (70-69Ma) of the Prince Creek Formation on Alaska's North Slope. Cladistic analyses show the material represents a new tyrannosaurine species closely related to the highly derived Tarbosaurus+Tyrannosaurus clade. The new taxon inhabited a seasonally extreme high-latitude continental environment on the northernmost edge of Cretaceous North America. The discovery of the new form provides new insights into tyrannosaurid adaptability, and evolution in an ancient greenhouse Arctic."
https://openalex.org/W1993929280,"Glycans play key roles in a variety of protein functions under normal and pathological conditions, but several glycosyltransferase-deficient mice exhibit no or only mild phenotypes due to redundancy or compensation of glycan functions. However, we have only a limited understanding of the underlying mechanism for these observations. Our previous studies indicated that 70% of Fut8-deficient (Fut8−/−) mice that lack core fucose structure die within 3 days after birth, but the remainder survive for up to several weeks although they show growth retardation as well as emphysema. In this study, we show that, in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from Fut8−/− mice, another N-glycan branching structure, bisecting GlcNAc, is specifically up-regulated by enhanced gene expression of the responsible enzyme N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III). As candidate target glycoproteins for bisecting GlcNAc modification, we confirmed that level of bisecting GlcNAc on β1-integrin and N-cadherin was increased in Fut8−/− MEFs. Moreover using mass spectrometry, glycan analysis of IgG1 in Fut8−/− mouse serum demonstrated that bisecting GlcNAc contents were also increased by Fut8 deficiency in vivo. As an underlying mechanism, we found that in Fut8−/− MEFs Wnt/β-catenin signaling is up-regulated, and an inhibitor against Wnt signaling was found to abrogate GnT-III expression, indicating that Wnt/β-catenin is involved in GnT-III up-regulation. Furthermore, various oxidative stress-related genes were also increased in Fut8−/− MEFs. These data suggest that Fut8−/− mice adapted to oxidative stress, both ex vivo and in vivo, by inducing various genes including GnT-III, which may compensate for the loss of core fucose functions.

https://openalex.org/W2139375312,"Dental anxiety creates significant problems for both patients and the dental profession. Some distraction interventions are already used by healthcare professionals to help patients cope with unpleasant procedures. The present study is novel because it a) builds on evidence that natural scenery is beneficial for patients, and b) uses a Virtual Reality (VR) representation of nature to distract participants. Extending previous work that has investigated pain and anxiety during treatment, c) we also consider the longer term effects in terms of more positive memories of the treatment, building on a cognitive theory of memory (Elaborated Intrusions). Participants (n = 69) took part in a simulated dental experience and were randomly assigned to one of three VR conditions (active vs. passive vs. control). In addition, participants were distinguished into high and low dentally anxious according to a median split resulting in a 3×2 between-subjects design. VR distraction in a simulated dental context affected memories a week later. The VR distraction had effects not only on concurrent experiences, such as perceived control, but longitudinally upon the vividness of memories after the dental experience had ended. Participants with higher dental anxiety (for whom the dental procedures were presumably more aversive) showed a greater reduction in memory vividness than lower dental-anxiety participants. This study thus suggests that VR distractions can be considered as a relevant intervention for cycles of care in which people's previous experiences affect their behaviour for future events."
https://openalex.org/W1984167696,"Expression of glycosyltransferase genes is essential for glycosylation. However, the detailed mechanisms of how glycosyltransferase gene expression is regulated in a specific tissue or during disease progression are poorly understood. In particular, epigenetic studies of glycosyltransferase genes are limited, although epigenetic mechanisms, such as histone and DNA modifications, are central to establish tissue-specific gene expression. We previously found that epigenetic histone activation is essential for brain-specific expression of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-IX (GnT-IX, also designated GnT-Vb), but the mechanism of brain-specific chromatin activation around GnT-IX gene (Mgat5b) has not been clarified. To reveal the mechanisms regulating the chromatin surrounding GnT-IX, we have investigated the epigenetic factors that are specifically involved with the mouse GnT-IX locus by comparing their involvement with other glycosyltransferase loci. We first found that a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor enhanced the expression of GnT-IX but not of other glycosyltransferases tested. By overexpression and knockdown of a series of HDACs, we found that HDAC11 silenced GnT-IX. We also identified the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and ten-eleven translocation-3 (TET3) complex as a specific chromatin activator of GnT-IX gene. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis in combination with OGT or TET3 knockdown showed that this OGT-TET3 complex facilitates the binding of a potent transactivator, NeuroD1, to the GnT-IX promoter, suggesting that epigenetic chromatin activation by the OGT-TET3 complex is a prerequisite for the efficient binding of NeuroD1. These results reveal a new epigenetic mechanism of brain-specific GnT-IX expression regulated by defined chromatin modifiers, providing new insights into the tissue-specific expression of glycosyltransferases."
https://openalex.org/W2001772098,"The rate at which glycoproteins are cleared from the circulation has a critical impact on their biologic activity in vivo. We have shown that clearance rates for glycoproteins such as luteinizing hormone (LH) that undergo regulated release into the circulation determine their potency. Two highly abundant, carbohydrate-specific, endocytic receptors, the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGR) and the mannose receptor (ManR) are expressed in the liver by parenchymal and sinusoidal endothelial cells, respectively. We demonstrate that the ManR mediates the clearance of glycoproteins such as LH that bear N-linked glycans terminating with β1,4-linked GalNAc-4-SO4, as well as glycoproteins bearing glycans that terminate with Man. Steady state levels of mRNA encoding the ASGR and the ManR are regulated by progesterone in pregnant mice, reaching maximal levels on day 12.5 of pregnancy. Protein expression and glycan-specific binding activity also increase in the livers of pregnant mice. In contrast, ManR mRNA, but not ASGR mRNA, decreases in male mice at the time of sexual maturation. We show that levels of ManR and ASGR expression control the clearance rate for glycoproteins bearing recognized glycans. Thus, reduced expression of the ManR at the time of sexual maturation will increase the potency of LH in vivo, whereas increased expression during pregnancy will reduce LH potency until progesterone and receptor levels fall prior to parturition."
https://openalex.org/W1993427825,"Background Upper tract urothelial carcinomas (UT-UC) can invade the pelvicalyceal system making differential diagnosis of the various histologically distinct renal cell carcinoma (RCC) subtypes and UT-UC, difficult. Correct diagnosis is critical for determining appropriate surgery and post-surgical treatments. We aimed to identify microRNA (miRNA) signatures that can accurately distinguish the most prevalent RCC subtypes and UT-UC form the normal kidney. Methods and Findings miRNA profiling was performed on FFPE tissue sections from RCC and UT-UC and normal kidney and 434 miRNAs were significantly deregulated in cancerous vs. the normal tissue. Hierarchical clustering distinguished UT-UCs from RCCs and classified the various RCC subtypes among them. qRT-PCR validated the deregulated expression profile for the majority of the miRNAs and ROC analysis revealed their capability to discriminate between tumour and normal kidney. An independent cohort of freshly frozen RCC and UT-UC samples was used to validate the deregulated miRNAs with the best discriminatory ability (AUC>0.8, p<0.001). Many of them were located within cytogenetic regions that were previously reported to be significantly aberrated. miRNA targets were predicted using the miRWalk algorithm and ingenuity pathway analysis identified the canonical pathways and curated networks of the deregulated miRNAs. Using the miRWalk algorithm, we further identified the top anti-correlated mRNA/miRNA pairs, between the deregulated miRNAs from our study and the top co-deregulated mRNAs among 5 independent ccRCC GEO datasets. The AB8/13 undifferentiated podocyte cells were used for functional assays using luciferase reporter constructs and the developmental transcription factor TFCP2L1 was proved to be a true target of miR-489, which was the second most upregulated miRNA in ccRCC. Conclusions We identified novel miRNAs specific for each RCC subtype and UT-UC, we investigated their putative targets, the networks and pathways in which they participate and we functionally verified the true targets of the top deregulated miRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2019994586,"The greatest challenge for the seeding of cancer in metastatic sites is integration into the ectopic microenvironment despite the lack of an orthotopic supportive environment and presence of pro-death signals concomitant with a localized “foreign-body” inflammatory response. In this metastatic location, many carcinoma cells display a reversion of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition that marks dissemination in the primary tumor mass. This mesenchymal to epithelial reverting transition (MErT) is thought to help seeding and colonization by protecting against cell death. We have previously shown that hepatocyte coculture induces the re-expression of E-cadherin via abrogation of autocrine EGFR signaling pathway in prostate cancer (PCa) cells and that this confers a survival advantage. Herein, we show that hepatocytes educate PCa to undergo MErT by modulating the activity of p38 and ERK1/2. Hepatocytes inhibited p38 and ERK1/2 activity in prostate cancer cells, which allowed E-cadherin re-expression. Introduction of constitutively active MEK6 and MEK1 to DU145 cells cocultured with hepatocytes abrogated E-cadherin re-expression. At least a partial phenotypic reversion can be achieved by suppression of p38 and ERK1/2 activation in DU145 cells even in the absence of hepatocytes. Interestingly, these mitogen-activated protein kinase activities were also triggered by re-expressed E-cadherin leading to p38 and ERK1/2 activity in PCa cells; these signals provide protection to PCa cells upon challenge with chemotherapy and cell death-inducing cytokines. We propose that distinct p38/ERK pathways are related to E-cadherin levels and function downstream of E-cadherin allowing, respectively, for hepatocyte-mediated MErT and tumor cell survival in the face of death signals.Background: Epithelial mesenchymal phenotypic switching enables cancers to seed and survive in metastatic sites.Results: Both p38 and ERK1/2 MAP kinases need to be inhibited to allow for an epithelial reversion but activated to provide survival advantage in the face of chemotherapy.Conclusion: Distinct p38/ERK signaling outcomes are involved in hepatocytes-mediated MErT and tumor cells survival.Significance: Provides insights in understanding approaches to p38α or ERK1/2 activity regulation for cancer therapy. The greatest challenge for the seeding of cancer in metastatic sites is integration into the ectopic microenvironment despite the lack of an orthotopic supportive environment and presence of pro-death signals concomitant with a localized “foreign-body” inflammatory response. In this metastatic location, many carcinoma cells display a reversion of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition that marks dissemination in the primary tumor mass. This mesenchymal to epithelial reverting transition (MErT) is thought to help seeding and colonization by protecting against cell death. We have previously shown that hepatocyte coculture induces the re-expression of E-cadherin via abrogation of autocrine EGFR signaling pathway in prostate cancer (PCa) cells and that this confers a survival advantage. Herein, we show that hepatocytes educate PCa to undergo MErT by modulating the activity of p38 and ERK1/2. Hepatocytes inhibited p38 and ERK1/2 activity in prostate cancer cells, which allowed E-cadherin re-expression. Introduction of constitutively active MEK6 and MEK1 to DU145 cells cocultured with hepatocytes abrogated E-cadherin re-expression. At least a partial phenotypic reversion can be achieved by suppression of p38 and ERK1/2 activation in DU145 cells even in the absence of hepatocytes. Interestingly, these mitogen-activated protein kinase activities were also triggered by re-expressed E-cadherin leading to p38 and ERK1/2 activity in PCa cells; these signals provide protection to PCa cells upon challenge with chemotherapy and cell death-inducing cytokines. We propose that distinct p38/ERK pathways are related to E-cadherin levels and function downstream of E-cadherin allowing, respectively, for hepatocyte-mediated MErT and tumor cell survival in the face of death signals. Background: Epithelial mesenchymal phenotypic switching enables cancers to seed and survive in metastatic sites. Results: Both p38 and ERK1/2 MAP kinases need to be inhibited to allow for an epithelial reversion but activated to provide survival advantage in the face of chemotherapy. Conclusion: Distinct p38/ERK signaling outcomes are involved in hepatocytes-mediated MErT and tumor cells survival.

https://openalex.org/W2007819302,"Background There is growing evidence that air pollutants are associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes. Subclinical inflammation may be a mechanism linking air pollution with diabetes. Information is lacking whether air pollution also contributes to worse metabolic control in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. We examined the hypothesis that residential particulate matter (PM10) is associated with HbA1c concentration in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Methods Nationwide regional levels of particulate matter with a diameter of ≤10 µm (PM10) were obtained in 2009 from background monitoring stations in Germany (Federal Environmental Agency) and assigned to place of residency of 9,102 newly diagnosed diabetes patients registered in the DPV database throughout Germany (age 65.5±13.5 yrs; males: 52.1%). Mean HbA1c (%) levels stratified for air pollution quartiles (PM10 in µg/m3) were estimated using linear regression models adjusting for age, sex, BMI, diabetes duration, geographic region, year of ascertainment, and social indicators. Findings In both men and women, adjusted HbA1c was significantly lower in the lowest quartile of PM10 exposure in comparison to quartiles Q2–Q4. Largest differences in adjusted HbA1c (95% CI) were seen comparing lowest quartiles of exposure with highest quartiles (men %: −0.42 (−0.62; −0.23)/mmol/mol: −28.11 (−30.30; −26.04), women, %: −0.28 (−0.47; −0.09)/mmol/mol: −0.28 (−0.47; −0.09)). Interpretation Air pollution may be associated with higher HbA1c levels in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients. Further studies are warranted to examine this association."
https://openalex.org/W1971383505,"Kojic acid (KA) is a fungal metabolite used as a topical treatment skin-whitening cosmetic agent for melasma in humans; however its potential as an anti-leishmanial agent is unknown. Chemotherapy is one of the most effective treatments for Leishmaniasis. However, the drugs available are expensive, invasive, require long-term treatment and have severe side effects. Thus, the development of new effective leishmanicidal agents is a necessity. In this study we investigated the anti-leishmanial effect of KA on L. amazonensis, following in vitro and in vivo infections. KA (50 μg/mL) was found to decrease the growth by 62% (IC50 34 μg/mL) and 79% (IC50 27.84 μg/mL) of promastigotes and amastigotes in vitro, respectively. Ultrastructural analysis of KA-treated amastigotes showed the presence of vesicles bodies into the flagellar pocket, and an intense intracellular vacuolization and swelling of the mitochondrion. During the in vitro interaction of parasites and the host cell, KA reverses the superoxide anions (O2-) inhibitory mechanism promoted by parasite. In addition, 4 weeks after KA-topical formulation treatment of infected animals, a healing process was observed with a high production of collagen fibers and a decrease in parasite burden. Thus, these results demonstrated the great potential of KA as an anti-leishmanial compound."

A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase C (ITPKC) has been identified to be an important polymorphism in the risk of KD. This study was conducted to comprehensively investigate the associations between all tagging SNPs of ITPKC in the risk of KD in a Taiwanese population. A total of 950 subjects (381 KD patients and 569 controls) were recruited. Seven tagging SNPs (rs11673492, rs7257602, rs7251246, rs890934, rs10420685, rs2607420, rs2290692) were selected for TaqMan allelic discrimination assay. Clinical data of coronary artery lesions (CAL) and aneurysms were collected for analysis. A significant association was found between rs7251246 in ITPKC and CAL formation. Haplotype analysis for ITPKC polymorphisms also confirmed this association in the patients with CAL and aneurysm formation. This is the first study to identify that SNP rs7251246 in ITPKC is associated with the severity of KD."

IL-33 mRNA is rapidly regulated, but the fate of synthesized IL-33 protein is unknown. To understand the interplay among IL-33, IFN-γ, and IL-4 proteins, recombinant replication-deficient adenoviruses were produced and used for dual expression of IL-33 and IFN-γ or IL-33 and IL-4. The effects of such dual gene delivery were compared with the effects of similar expression of each of these cytokines alone. In lung fibroblast culture, co-expression of IL-33 and IFN-γ resulted in suppression of the levels of both proteins, whereas co-expression of IL-33 and IL-4 led to mutual elevation. In vivo, co-expression of IL-33 and IFN-γ in the lungs led to attenuation of IL-33 protein levels. Purified IFN-γ also attenuated IL-33 protein in fibroblast culture, suggesting that IFN-γ controls IL-33 protein degradation. Specific inhibition of caspase-1, -3, and -8 had minimal effect on IFN-γ-driven IL-33 protein down-regulation. Pharmacological inhibition, siRNA-mediated silencing, or gene deficiency of STAT1 potently up-regulated IL-33 protein expression levels and attenuated the down-regulating effect of IFN-γ on IL-33. Stimulation with IFN-γ strongly elevated the levels of the LMP2 proteasome subunit, known for its role in IFN-γ-regulated antigen processing. siRNA-mediated silencing of LMP2 expression abrogated the effect of IFN-γ on IL-33. Thus, IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-33 are engaged in a complex interplay. The down-regulation of IL-33 protein levels by IFN-γ in pulmonary fibroblasts and in the lungs in vivo occurs through STAT1 and non-canonical use of the LMP2 proteasome subunit in a caspase-independent fashion.

https://openalex.org/W1975663753,"The zinc finger AN1-type domain 2a gene, also known as arsenite-inducible RNA-associated protein (AIRAP), was recently identified as a novel human canonical heat shock gene strictly controlled by heat shock factor (HSF) 1. Little is known about AIRAP gene regulation in human cells. Here we report that bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor with anticancer and antiangiogenic properties used in the clinic for treatment of multiple myeloma, is a potent inducer of AIRAP expression in human cells. Using endothelial cells as a model, we unraveled the molecular mechanism regulating AIRAP expression during proteasome inhibition. Bortezomib induces AIRAP expression at the transcriptional level early after treatment, concomitantly with polyubiquitinated protein accumulation and HSF activation. AIRAP protein is detected at high levels for at least 48 h after bortezomib exposure, together with the accumulation of HSF2, a factor implicated in differentiation and development regulation. Different from heat-mediated induction, in bortezomib-treated cells, HSF1 and HSF2 interact directly, forming HSF1-HSF2 heterotrimeric complexes recruited to a specific heat shock element in the AIRAP promoter. Interestingly, whereas HSF1 has been confirmed to be critical for AIRAP gene transcription, HSF2 was found to negatively regulate AIRAP expression after bortezomib treatment, further emphasizing an important modulatory role of this transcription factor under stress conditions. AIRAP function is still not defined. However, the fact that AIRAP is expressed abundantly in primary human cells at bortezomib concentrations comparable with plasma levels in treated patients suggests that AIRAP may participate in the regulatory network controlling proteotoxic stress during bortezomib treatment."

Difficulties reaching both frail and healthy elderly people in randomized controlled trials or large cohort studies may in part explain discordant findings. We determined hazard ratios for hip fractures of elderly men and women related to serum 25(OH)D, including both the frail and the healthy segment of the elderly population.The AGES-Reykjavik Study is a prospective study of 5764 men and women, age 66-96 years, based on a representative sample of the population of Reykjavik, Iceland. Participation was 71.8%. Hazard ratios of incident hip fractures and baseline bone mineral density were determined according to serum concentrations of 25(OH)D at baseline.Mean follow-up was 5.4 years. Compared with referent values (50-75 nmol/L), hazard ratios for hip fractures were 2.24 (95% CI 1.63, 3.09) for serum 25(OH)D <30 nmol/L, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, height, smoking, alcohol intake and season, and 2.08 (95% CI 1.51, 2.87), adjusting additionally for physical activity. No difference in risk was associated with 30-50 nmol/L or ≥75 nmol/L in either model compared with referent. Analyzing the sexes separately, hazard ratios were 2.61 (95% CI 1.47, 4.64) in men and 1.93 (95% CI 1.31, 2.84) in women. Values <30 nmol/L were associated with significantly lower bone mineral density of femoral neck compared with referent, z-scores -0.14 (95% CI -0.27, -0.00) in men and -0.11 (95% CI -0.22, -0.01) in women.Our results lend support to the overarching importance of maintaining serum 25(OH)D above 30 nmol/L for bone health of elderly people while potential benefits of having much higher levels could not be detected."
https://openalex.org/W2019056279,"Two main models have been proposed to explain how the relative size of neural structures varies through evolution. In the mosaic evolution model, individual brain structures vary in size independently of each other, whereas in the concerted evolution model developmental constraints result in different parts of the brain varying in size in a coordinated manner. Several studies have shown variation of the relative size of individual nuclei in the vertebrate brain, but it is currently not known if nuclei belonging to the same functional pathway vary independently of each other or in a concerted manner. The visual system of birds offers an ideal opportunity to specifically test which of the two models apply to an entire sensory pathway. Here, we examine the relative size of 9 different visual nuclei across 98 species of birds. This includes data on interspecific variation in the cytoarchitecture and relative size of the isthmal nuclei, which has not been previously reported. We also use a combination of statistical analyses, phylogenetically corrected principal component analysis and evolutionary rates of change on the absolute and relative size of the nine nuclei, to test if visual nuclei evolved in a concerted or mosaic manner. Our results strongly indicate a combination of mosaic and concerted evolution (in the relative size of nine nuclei) within the avian visual system. Specifically, the relative size of the isthmal nuclei and parts of the tectofugal pathway covary across species in a concerted fashion, whereas the relative volume of the other visual nuclei measured vary independently of one another, such as that predicted by the mosaic model. Our results suggest the covariation of different neural structures depends not only on the functional connectivity of each nucleus, but also on the diversity of afferents and efferents of each nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2012401440,"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules exhibit conformational heterogeneity, which influences their ability to stimulate CD4 T cells and drive immune responses. Previous studies suggest a role for the transmembrane domain of the class II αβ heterodimer in determining molecular structure and function. Our previous studies identified an MHC class II conformer that is marked by the Ia.2 epitope. These Ia.2(+) class II conformers are lipid raft-associated and able to drive both tyrosine kinase signaling and efficient antigen presentation to CD4 T cells. Here, we establish that the Ia.2(+) I-A(k) conformer is formed early in the class II biosynthetic pathway and that differential pairing of highly conserved transmembrane domain GXXXG dimerization motifs is responsible for formation of Ia.2(+) versus Ia.2(-) I-A(k) class II conformers and controlling lipid raft partitioning. These findings provide a molecular explanation for the formation of two distinct MHC class II conformers that differ in their inherent ability to signal and drive robust T cell activation, providing new insight into the role of MHC class II in regulating antigen-presenting cell-T cell interactions critical to the initiation and control of multiple aspects of the immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2065312143,"Intense geological activity caused major topographic changes in Western North America over the past 15 million years. Major rivers here are composites of different ancient rivers, resulting in isolation and mixing episodes between river basins over time. This history influenced the diversification of most of the aquatic fauna. The genus Pantosteus is one of several clades centered in this tectonically active region. The eight recognized Pantosteus species are widespread and common across southwestern Canada, western USA and into northern Mexico. They are typically found in medium gradient, middle-elevation reaches of rivers over rocky substrates. This study (1) compares molecular data with morphological and paleontological data for proposed species of Pantosteus, (2) tests hypotheses of their monophyly, (3) uses these data for phylogenetic inferences of sister-group relationships, and (4) estimates timing of divergence events of identified lineages. Using 8055 base pairs from mitochondrial DNA protein coding genes, Pantosteus and Catostomus are reciprocally monophyletic, in contrast with morphological data. The only exception to a monophyletic Pantosteus is P. columbianus whose mtDNA is closely aligned with C. tahoensis because of introgression. Within Pantosteus, several species have deep genetic divergences among allopatric sister lineages, several of which are diagnosed and elevated to species, bringing the total diversity in the group to 11 species. Conflicting molecular and morphological data may be resolved when patterns of divergence are shown to be correlated with sympatry and evidence of introgression."
https://openalex.org/W2069966017,"Aim Physical activity (PA) confers some protection against development of heart failure (HF) but little is known of the role of intensity and duration of exercise. Methods and Results In a prospective cohort study of men and women free of previous MI, stroke or HF with one or more examinations in 1976–2003, we studied the association between updated self-assessed leisure-time PA, speed and duration of walking and subsequent hospitalization or death from HF. Light and moderate/high level of leisure-time PA and brisk walking were associated with reduced risk of HF in both genders whereas no consistent association with duration of walking was seen. In 18,209 subjects age 20–80 with 1580 cases of HF, using the lowest activity level as reference, the confounder-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for light and moderate/high leisure-time physical activity were 0.75 (0.66–0.86) and 0.80 (0.69–0.93), respectively. In 9,937 subjects with information on walking available and 542 cases of HF, moderate and high walking speed were associated with adjusted HRs of 0.53 (0.43–0.66) and 0.30 (0.21–0.44), respectively, and daily walking of ½–1 hrs, 1–2 and >2 hrs with HR of 0.80 (0.61–1.06), 0.82 (0.62–1.06), and 0.96 (0.73–1.27), respectively. Results were similar for both genders and remained robust after exclusion of HF related to coronary heart disease and after a series of sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Speed rather than duration of walking was associated with reduced risk of HF. Walking is the most wide-spread PA and public health measures to curb the increase in HF may benefit from this information."
https://openalex.org/W2001754265,"Although mechanical stimulations are known have a significant impact on cytoskeletal rearrangement, little is known regarding the behavioral alteration of human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs) under cyclic strain. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of the Rho signaling pathway on cyclic strain-induced cytoskeletal rearrangement of hPDLCs.Healthy hPDLCs obtained from teeth extracted for orthodontic purposes were subjected to cyclic strain with physiological loading (10%) at a frequency of 0.1 Hz for 6 h or 24 h using a FX-5000T system. Changes in cell morphology were examined by phase-contrast microscopy, while F-actin reorganization was observed by phalloidin staining and confocal microscopy. Protein expression was analyzed through western blot analysis.Significant enhancement of cytoskeletal reorganization was observed following exposure to the cyclic strain. In addition, a significant increase was noted in the expression levels of GTP-Rho, Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) and p-cofilin, whereas the expression levels of Rho GDP dissociation inhibitors alpha (Rho-GDIa) were reduced in the hPDLCs, compared with the static control cells. More importantly, the Rock inhibitor Y-27632 suppressed cyclic strain-induced cytoskeletal rearrangement of hPDLCs. Additionally, Y-27632 and overexpression of Rho-GDIa were found to lower p-cofilin protein expressions under cyclic strain, while Rho-GDIa siRNA transfection had the opposite effect on the hPDLCs.Cyclic strain promotes cytoskeletal rearrangement of hPDLCs by downregulating the expression levels of Rho-GDIa and upregulating the expression levels of GTP-Rho, Rock and p-cofilin. These observations may provide valuable insight into understanding orthodontic tooth movement as well as alveolar bone remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W1999150577,"Research on spermatogonia is hampered by complex architecture of the seminiferous tubule, poor viability of testicular tissue ex vivo and lack of physiologically relevant long-term culture systems. Therefore there is a need for an in vitro model that would enable long term survival and propagation of spermatogonia. We aimed at the most simplified approach to enable all different cell types within the seminiferous tubules to contribute to the creation of a niche for spermatogonia. In the present study we describe the establishment of a co-culture of mouse testicular cells that is based on proliferative and migratory activity of seminiferous tubule cells and does not involve separation, purification or differential plating of individual cell populations. The co-culture is composed of the constituents of testicular stem cell niche: Sertoli cells [identified by expression of Wilm's tumour antigen 1 (WT1) and secretion of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, GDNF], peritubular myoid cells (expressing alpha smooth muscle actin, αSMA) and spermatogonia [expressing MAGE-B4, PLZF (promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger), LIN28, Gpr125 (G protein-coupled receptor 125), CD9, c-Kit and Nanog], and can be maintained for at least five weeks. GDNF was found in the medium at a sufficient concentration to support proliferating spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) that were able to start spermatogenic differentiation after transplantation to an experimentally sterile recipient testis. Gdnf mRNA levels were elevated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) which shows that the Sertoli cells in the co-culture respond to physiological stimuli. After approximately 2-4 weeks of culture a spontaneous formation of cord-like structures was monitored. These structures can be more than 10 mm in length and branch. They are formed by peritubular myoid cells, Sertoli cells, fibroblasts and spermatogonia as assessed by gene expression profiling. In conclusion, we have managed to establish in vitro conditions that allow spontaneous reconstruction of testicular cellular microenvironments."
https://openalex.org/W2034874717,"Allergic inflammation has been known to enhance the metastatic potential of tumor cells. The role of histone deacetylase-3 (HDAC3) in allergic skin inflammation was reported. We investigated HDAC3 involvement in the allergic inflammation-promotion of metastatic potential of tumor cells. Passive systemic anaphylaxis (PSA) induced HDAC3 expression and FcεRI signaling in BALB/c mice. PSA enhanced the tumorigenic and metastatic potential of mouse melanoma cells in HDAC3- and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1-(MCP1)-dependent manner. The PSA-mediated enhancement of metastatic potential involved the induction of HDAC3, MCP1, and CD11b (a macrophage marker) expression in the lung tumor tissues. We examined an interaction between anaphylaxis and tumor growth and metastasis at the molecular level. Conditioned medium from antigen-stimulated bone marrow-derived mouse mast cell cultures induced the expression of HDAC3, MCP1, and CCR2, a receptor for MCP1, in B16F1 mouse melanoma cells and enhanced migration and invasion potential of B16F1 cells. The conditioned medium from B16F10 cultures induced the activation of FcεRI signaling in lung mast cells in an HDAC3-dependent manner. FcεRI signaling was observed in lung tumors derived from B16F10 cells. Target scan analysis predicted HDAC3 to be as a target of miR-384, and miR-384 and HDAC3 were found to form a feedback regulatory loop. miR-384, which is decreased by PSA, negatively regulated HDAC3 expression, allergic inflammation, and the positive feedback regulatory loop between anaphylaxis and tumor metastasis. We show the miR-384/HDAC3 feedback loop to be a novel regulator of the positive feedback relationship between anaphylaxis and tumor metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2042060127,"A chemolithotrophic bacterium enriched in the chemostat in presence of sodium bicarbonate as sole carbon source was identified as Serratia sp. by 16S rRNA sequencing. Carbon dioxide sequestering capacity of bacterium was detected by carbonic anhydrase enzyme and ribulose-1, 5- bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO). The purified carbonic anhydrase showed molecular weight of 29 kDa. Molecular weight of RuBisCO was 550 kDa as determined by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC), however, sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) showed presence of two subunits whose molecular weights were 56 and 14 kDa. The Western blot analysis of the crude protein and purified sample cross reacted with RuBisCO large-subunit polypeptides antibodies showed strong band pattern at molecular weight around 56 kDa regions. Whole cell soluble proteins of Serratia sp. grown under autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions were resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF/MS for differential expression of proteins. In proteomic analysis of 63 protein spots, 48 spots were significantly up-regulated in the autotrophically grown cells; seven enzymes showed its utilization in autotrophic carbon fixation pathways and other metabolic activities of bacterium including lipid metabolisms indicated sequestration potency of carbon dioxide and production of biomaterials."
https://openalex.org/W1963655835,"The first event in origination of many childhood leukemias is likely the presence of preleukemic clone (transformed hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells with preleukemic gene fusions (PGF)) in newborn. Thus, the screening of umbilical cord blood (UCB) for PGF may be of high importance for developing strategies for childhood leukemia prevention and treatment. However, the data on incidence of PGF in UCB are contradictive. We have compared multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time quantitative PCR (RT qPCR) in neonates from Slovak National Birth Cohort. According to multiplex PCR, all 135 screened samples were negative for the most frequent PGF of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To explore the prevalence of prognostically important TEL-AML1, MLL-AF4 and BCR-ABL (p190), 200 UCB were screened using RT qPCR. The initial screening showed an unexpectedly high incidence of studied PGF. The validation of selected samples in two laboratories confirmed approximately ¼ of UCB positive, resulting in ∼4% incidence of TEL-AML1, ∼6.25% incidence of BCR-ABL1 p190, and ∼0.75% frequency of MLL-AF4. In most cases, the PGF presented at very low level, about 1-5 copies per 105 cells. We hypothesize that low PGF numbers reflect their relatively late origin and are likely to be eliminated in further development while higher number of PGF reflects earlier origination and may represent higher risk for leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W1994649998,"Marked variation occurs in both seasonal and multiannual population density peaks of northern European small mammal species, including voles. The availability of dietary proteins is a key factor limiting the population growth of herbivore species. The objective of this study is to investigate the degree to which protein availability influences the growth of increasing vole populations. We hypothesise that the summer growth of folivorous vole populations is positively associated with dietary protein availability. A field experiment was conducted over a summer reproductive period in 18 vegetated enclosures. Populations of field voles (Microtus agrestis) were randomised amongst three treatment groups: 1) food supplementation with ad libitum high protein (30% dry weight) pellets, 2) food supplementation with ad libitum low protein (1% dry weight; both supplemented foods had equivalent energy content) pellets, and 3) control (no food supplementation), n = 6 per treatment. Vole density, survival, demographic attributes and condition indicators were monitored with live-trapping and blood sampling. Highest final vole densities were attained in populations that received high protein supplementation and lowest in low protein populations. Control populations displayed intermediate densities. The survival rate of voles was similar in all treatment groups. The proportion of females, and of those that were pregnant or lactating, was highest in the high protein supplemented populations. This suggests that variation in reproductive, rather than survival rates of voles, accounted for density differences between the treatment groups. We found no clear association between population demography and individual physiological condition. Our results demonstrate that dietary protein availability limits vole population growth during the summer growing season. This suggests that the nutritional quality of forage may be an underestimated source of interannual variation in the density and growth rates of widely fluctuating populations of herbivorous small mammals."

Individuals ranging from 18 to 75 years of age--some of them without any skills in skateboarding and others experts in this sport--were compared in their ability to anticipate and simulate a skateboarding jump by listening to the sound it produces. Only skaters were able to modulate the forces underfoot and to apply muscle synergies that closely resembled the ones that a skater would use if actually jumping on a skateboard. More importantly we showed that only skaters were able to plan the action by activating anticipatory postural adjustments about 200 ms after the jump event. We conclude that expert patterns are guided by auditory events that trigger proper anticipations of the corresponding patterns of movements."
https://openalex.org/W2042787861,"p97, also known as valosin-containing protein, is a versatile participant in the ubiquitin-proteasome system. p97 interacts with a large network of adaptor proteins to process ubiquitylated substrates in different cellular pathways, including endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation and transcription factor activation. p97 and its adaptor Fas-associated factor-1 (FAF1) both have roles in the ubiquitin-proteasome system during NF-κB activation, although the mechanisms are unknown. FAF1 itself also has emerging roles in other cell-cycle pathways and displays altered expression levels in various cancer cell lines. We have performed a detailed study the p97-FAF1 interaction. We show that FAF1 binds p97 stably and in a stoichiometry of 3 to 6. Cryo-EM analysis of p97-FAF1 yielded a 17 Å reconstruction of the complex with FAF1 above the p97 ring. Characteristics of p97-FAF1 uncovered in this study reveal common features in the interactions of p97, providing mechanistic insight into how p97 mediates diverse functionalities."
https://openalex.org/W1997284290,"Background During the last decade, new Neogene fossil assemblages from South America have revealed important clues about the evolution of seabird faunas in one of the major upwelling systems of the world: the Humboldt Current. However, most of this record comes from arid Northern Chile and Southern Peru and, in consequence, our knowledge of the evolutionary history of seabirds in the temperate transitional zone is negligible. A new Late Pliocene assemblage of fossil birds from the coastal locality of Horcon in Central Chile offers a unique opportunity to fill this gap. Principal Findings Isolated bones of a medium-sized penguin are the most abundant bird remains. Morphological and cladistic analyses reveal that these specimens represent a new species of crested penguin, Eudyptes calauina sp. nov. Eudyptes is a penguin genus that inhabit temperate and subantarctic regions and currently absent in central Chile. Additionally, a partial skeleton of a small species of cormorant and a partial tarsometatarsus of a sooty shearwater have been identified. Conclusion/Significance The Horcon fossils suggest the existence of a mixed avifauna in central Chile during the Pliocene in concordance with the latitudinal thermal gradient. This resembles the current assemblages from the transitional zone, with the presence of species shared with Northern Chile and Southern Peru and a previously unrecorded penguin currently absent from the Humboldt System but present in the Magellanic region. Comparison of Pliocene seabird diversity across the Pacific coast of South America shows that the Horcon avifauna represents a distinctive assemblage linking the living faunas with the Late Miocene ones. A comparison with the fossil record near the Benguela Current (west coast of southern Africa) suggests that the thermic gradient could play an important role in the preservation of a higher diversity of cold/temperate seabirds in the Humboldt Current."
https://openalex.org/W2007212877,"Cigarette smoking is an established risk factor for esophageal cancers. Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), the key transcription factor of the mammalian Hippo pathway, has been reported to be an oncogenic factor for many cancers. In this study, we find nicotine administration can induce nuclear translocation and activation of YAP1 in ESCC. Consistently, we observed nuclear translocation and activation of YAP1 by knockdown of CHRNA3, which is a negative regulator of nicotine signaling in bronchial and esophageal cancer cells. Nicotine administration or CHRNA3 depletion substantially increased proliferation and migration in esophageal cancer cells. Interestingly, we find that YAP1 physically interacts with nAChRs, and nAChRs-signaling dissociates YAP1 from its negative regulatory complex composed with α-catenin, β-catenin and 14-3-3 in the cytoplasm, leading to upregulation and nuclear translocation of YAP1. This process likely requires PKC activation, as PKC specific inhibitor Enzastaurin can block nicotine induced YAP1 activation. In addition, we find nicotine signaling also inhibits the interaction of YAP1 with P63, which contributes to the inhibitory effect of nicotine on apoptosis. Using immunohistochemistry analysis we observed upregulation of YAP1 in a significant portion of esophageal cancer samples. Consistently, we have found a significant association between YAP1 upregulation and cigarette smoking in the clinical esophageal cancer samples. Together, these findings suggest that the nicotine activated nAChRs signaling pathway which further activates YAP1 plays an important role in the development of esophageal cancer, and this mechanism may be of a general significance for the carcinogenesis of smoking related cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2042130099,"Objective Vascular inflammation plays an important role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Recently, salusins (salusin-α and salusin-β) have been reported to be associated wtih atherosclerosis. However, its underlying mechanism remains incompletely known. In this study, we observed the effects of salusins on vascular inflammation in apoE-deficient (apoE-/-) mice. Methods and Results Six-week old male apoE-/- mice were infused with salusin-α, salusin-β or vehicle for 8 weeks via osmotic mini-pumps. Our results showed that apoE-/- mice receiving vehicle alone developed severe atherosclerotic lesions and dyslipidemia, with significantly up-regulated levels of IL-6, TNF-α, VCAM-1 and MCP-1. For apoE-/- mice receiving 8 weeks of salusin-β infusion, the atherosclerotic lesions were markedly aggravated, and the levels of IL-6, TNF-α, VCAM-1 and MCP-1 were substantially increased, despite a similar plasma lipid concentration with that of apoE-/- mice. However, after 8 week-infusion of salusin-α, apoE-/- mice presented significant amelioration in atherosclerotic lesions, along with remarkably up-regulated level of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and down-regulated levels of IL-6 and TNF-α, but without any effect on the expressions of VCAM-1 and MCP-1. Furthermore, the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), an important transcription factor essential for inflammatory molecules, and the degradation of I-κBα, an inhibitor of NF-κB, were markedly increased in apoE-/- mice receiving vehicle alone. Treatment with salusin-β not salusin-α could remarkably accelerate the process of NF-κB nuclear translocation and I-κBα degradation. Conclusion Salusin-β, but not salusin-α, promotes vascular inflammation in apoE-deficient mice via the I-κBα/NF-κB pathway. These findings provide further insight into the mechanism of salusins in atherosclerosis and potential targets for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2014059914,"The development of the mammalian kidney is a highly complex process dependent upon the interplay of various cell types, secreted morphogens, and the extra-cellular matrix (ECM). Although integrins are the most important receptors for ECM proteins and are ubiquitously expressed during kidney development, mice lacking expression of integrin α3 (Itga3) do not demonstrate a reduced number of nephrons, but mostly a disorganized GBM (glomerular basement membrane) leading to proteinuria. Thus, ITGA3 is considered mostly a passive GBM stabilizer and not an active player in nephrogenesis. Recently, mutations in the human ITGA3 were shown to cause congenital nephrotic syndrome, epidermolysis bullosa and interstitial lung disease, otherwise termed NEP syndrome (Nephrotic syndrome, Epidermolysis bullosa and Pulmonary disease). Herein, we performed histological and molecular analysis on the kidneys of a single patient from the initial cohort harboring an ITGA3 mutation, to illuminate the role of ITGA3 in human renal development. We show the patient to harbor a unique phenotype at birth, including severe unilateral renal hypodysplasia. Interrogation of global gene expression in the hypodysplastic kidney versus three controls (fetal, child and adult kidneys) revealed perturbed expression in several renal developmental pathways implicated in hypodysplasia, including the Wnt, BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) and TGF (transforming growth factor) pathways. Moreover, the affected kidney showed upregulation of early embryonic genes (e.g. OCT4 and PAX8) concomitant with downregulated kidney differentiation markers, implying a defect in proper renal differentiation. In conclusion, we show for the first time that ITGA3 is not merely a passive anchor for renal ECM proteins, as predicted by mouse models. Instead, our results may suggest it plays a central role in the interplay of cells, morphogens and ECM, required for proper nephrogenesis, thus adding ITGA3 to the list of CAKUT (congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract)-causing genes."

We demonstrate that D2R activation decreases huntingtin phosphorylation on its Akt site. This dephosphorylation event depends upon the Gαi-dependent engagement of specific members of the protein phosphatase metallo-dependent (PPM/PP2C) family and is independent of β-arrestin 2.

https://openalex.org/W2033885263,"Objective To examine HIV prevalence, HIV testing behaviour, undiagnosed infection and risk factors for HIV positivity among a community sample of gay men in Scotland. Methods Cross-sectional survey of gay and bisexual men attending commercial gay venues in Glasgow and Edinburgh, Scotland with voluntary anonymous HIV testing of oral fluid samples in 2011. A response rate of 65.2% was achieved (1515 participants). Results HIV prevalence (4.8%, 95% confidence interval, CI 3.8% to 6.2%) remained stable compared to previous survey years (2005 and 2008) and the proportion of undiagnosed infection among HIV-positive men (25.4%) remained similar to that recorded in 2008. Half of the participants who provided an oral fluid sample stated that they had had an HIV test in the previous 12 months; this proportion is significantly higher when compared to previous study years (50.7% versus 33.8% in 2005, p<0.001). Older age (>25 years) was associated with HIV positivity (1.8% in those <25 versus 6.4% in older ages group) as was a sexually transmitted infection (STI) diagnosis within the previous 12 months (adjusted odds ratio 2.13, 95% CI 1.09–4.14). There was no significant association between age and having an STI or age and any of the sexual behaviours recorded. Conclusion HIV transmission continues to occur among gay and bisexual men in Scotland. Despite evidence of recent testing within the previous six months, suggesting a willingness to test, the current opt-out policy may have reached its limit with regards to maximising HIV test uptake. Novel strategies are required to improve regular testing opportunities and more frequent testing as there are implications for the use of other biomedical HIV interventions."

All participants underwent short-term HRV test. The risk score was derived from an exploratory set. The risk score was developed by stepwise backward multiple logistic regression. The coefficients from this model were transformed into components of a CAN score. This score was tested in a validation and entire sample.The final risk score included age, body mass index, hypertension, resting hear rate, items independently and significantly (P<0.05) associated with the presence of previously undiagnosed CAN. The area under the receiver operating curve was 0.726 (95% CI 0.686-0.766) for exploratory set, 0.784 (95% CI 0.749-0.818) for validation set, and 0.756 (95% CI 0.729-0.782) for entire sample. In validation set, at optimal cutoff score of 5 of 10, the risk score system has the sensitivity, specificity, and percentage that needed subsequent testing were 69, 78, and 30%, respectively.We developed a CAN risk score system based on a set of variables not requiring laboratory tests. The score system is simple fast, inexpensive, noninvasive, and reliable tool that can be applied to early intervention to delay or prevent the disease in China."

We found serial subcultivation of the co-culture could enhance the yield of 2-KGA by 16% in comparison to that of the ancestral co-culture. To elucidate the evolutionary dynamics and interaction mechanisms of the two microbes, we performed iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic analyses of the pure cultures of K. vulgare, B. cereus and their co-culture during serial subcultivation. Hierarchy cluster analyses of the proteomic data showed that the expression level of a number of crucial proteins associated with sorbose conversion and oligopeptide transport was significantly enhanced by the experimental evolution. In particular, the expression level of sorbose/sorbosone dehydrogenase was enhanced in the evolved K. vulgare, while the expression level of InhA and the transport efficiency of oligopeptides were increased in the evolved B. cereus. The decreased sporulating protein expression and increased peptide transporter expression observed in evolved B. cereus, together with the increased amino acids synthesis in evolved K. vulgare suggested that serial subcultivation result in enhanced synergistic cooperation between K. vulgare and B. cereus, enabling an increased production of 2-KGA."

The effect of GlcNAc was probed by using a yeast strain expressing a single chitin synthase, Chs2, by examining formation of chitin oligosaccharides (COs) and insoluble chitin, and by replacing GlcNAc with 2-acylamido analogues of GlcNAc. Synthesis of COs was strongly dependent on inclusion of GlcNAc in chitin synthase incubations, and N,N′-diacetylchitobiose (GlcNAc2) was the major reaction product.

Mechanistic investigations have found that the functional interaction between the ERα and APP is indirectly mediated through Fe65, identifying it as a novel ERα interacting protein (16.Bao J. Cao C. Zhang X. Jiang F. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. Suppression of β-amyloid precursor protein signaling into the nucleus by estrogens mediated through complex formation between the estrogen receptor and Fe65.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 1321-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Fe65 is a multidomain adaptor protein containing an undefined N terminus, a group II tryptophan-tryptophan (WW) domain in the middle, and two C-terminal PTB domains, namely PTB1 and PTB2 (17.McLoughlin D.M. Miller C.C. The FE65 proteins and Alzheimer's disease.J. Neurosci. Res. 2008; 86: 744-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Through PTB2, it forms a multimeric complex with APP or APPct to stimulate transcription through the recruitment of the transcription factor CP2/LSF/LBP1 and the histone acetyl transferase Tip60 (13.Cao X.

Transcription regulation by the adaptor protein Fe65 and the nucleosome assembly factor SET.EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The PTB1 domain also interacts with two cell surface lipoprotein receptors, the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (19.Trommsdorff M. Borg J.P. Margolis B. Herz J.

Besides SET, the WW domain also binds to Mena (21.Ermekova K.S. Zambrano N. Linn H. Minopoli G. Gertler F. Russo T. Sudol M.

There are two Fe65 isoforms produced by the alternative splicing of a 6-bp mini-exon encoding Arg-Glu dipeptide inserted in the PTB1 domain. The isoform with this mini-exon is expressed exclusively in neurons, whereas the isoform lacking the dipeptide exists in non-neuronal cells (24.Hu Q. Hearn M.G. Jin L.W. Bressler S.L. Martin G.M. Alternatively spliced isoforms of FE65 serve as neuron-specific and non-neuronal markers.J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Besides its neuronal functions in APP processing and Alzheimer disease biology, Fe65 has been reported to regulate other essential cellular functions such as DNA damage repair that goes beyond neuronal cells. Fe65 null mice are more sensitive to DNA damages induced by etoposide and ionizing radiations (25.Minopoli G. Stante M. Napolitano F. Telese F. Aloia L. De Felice M. Di Lauro R. Pacelli R.

Chem. 2007; 282: 831-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Studies with Fe65 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts concluded that Fe65 was required for the efficient repair of DNA double-strand breaks, a function dependent on its interaction with Tip60 and APPct (26.Stante M.

However, functions of Fe65 in non-neuronal cells are largely undefined, and nothing is known about its involvement in estrogen actions in BCa. In the present study we demonstrate for the first time that Fe65 is expressed in mammary epithelial cells and that its expression is increased in BCa cells and human breast tumor samples. Fe65 is recruited by estrogens to the promoters of estrogen target genes in BCa cells and potentiates the recruitment of the ERα and its coactivators to the promoters. It increases the agonistic activity of 17β-estradiol and decreases the antagonistic activity of TAM. The studies define Fe65 as a positive ERα regulator that increases the growth of human BCa cells and contributes to TAM resistance. 17β-Estradiol, anti-FLAG affinity gels, and 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) were purchased from Sigma.

Fe65 (siFe65) (sequence 5′-CUACGUAGCUCGUGAUAAG-3′), siERα (sequence 5′-GCCAGCAGGUGCCCUACUA-3′), and scrambled control (siCtrl) siRNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Dharmacon/Thermo Scientific (Waltham, MA). The ECL Western blotting substrates were from Thermo Scientific. Luciferase assay substrates were from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). Chip assay kit (EZ-ChipTM) was from Millipore (Billerica, MA). Breast invasive ductal carcinoma tissue array slides were purchased from US Biomax Inc.

To construct tagged Fe65, cDNA of the non-neuronal Fe65 (Thermo Scientific) was amplified by PCR using forward (GCGGGATCCATGTCTGTTCCATCATCACTG) and reverse (GAGGTCGACTCATGGGGTATGGGCCCC) primers. Myc-Fe65 was constructed by cloning the amplified cDNA into the Bam H1 and Sal1 of p-CMV-3Tag-2a-Myc plasmid (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). To construct the expression plasmids of HA-Fe65 and deletion constructs, Fe65 cDNA or fragments were amplified by PCR using the Myc-Fe65 as the template, digested with BamH1 and Sal1, and ligated into pCMV-HA plasmid generated by replacing the FLAG tag with HA of pCMV-3Tag-1A (Agilent Technologies). The primers used for the constructions of Fe65 and its deletion mutants are as follows: full-length: GCGGGATCCATGTCTGTTCCATCATCACTGAGC (forward) and GAGGTCGACTCATGGGGTATGGGCCCCAGCCG (reverse); N-terminal 128 amino acid deletion (dN128): GCGGGATCCATGAACCGAGGCCTACGAGGACCT (forward) and GAGGTCGACTCATGGGGTATGGGCCCCCAGCCG (reverse); N-terminal 242 amino acid deletion (dN242): GCGGGATCCATGTTCTGGAACCCCAACGCCTTC (forward) and GAGGTCGACTCATGGGGTATGGGCCCCCAGCCG (reverse); WW deletion (dWW): TTCACCGGTCAAGAGGAGTCCCAGCTCAC (forward) and CTTACCGGTGTCGGAATCCGTCTCGAAG (reverse); PTB1 deletion (dPTB1): CCCAAGAGGAGGAGAAGTGCTTGGTAAATGGACT (forward) AGTCCATTTACCAAGCACTTCTCCTCCTCTTGGG (reverse); PTB2 deletion (dPTB2): CTTGTGGATGTCCCTTTCCAATCCCAGGCCTC (forward) and GAGGCCTGGGATTGGAAAGGGACATCCACAAG (reverse); C-terminal 182 amino acid deletion (dC182): GCGGGATCCATGTCTGTTCCATCATCACTGAGC (forward) GAGGTCGACTCATTGGAAAGGGACATCCACAAG (reverse); C-terminal 42 amino acid deletion (dC182): GCGGGATCCATGTCTGTTCCATCATCACTGAGC (forward) and GAGGTCGACACGGGCATCCAGACACTTCTGGTA (reverse).

For all experiments involving estrogen and androgen treatment, cells were starved in phenol red-free medium containing 3% stripped FBS for 3 days to remove steroids in the assay system, and all steroid treatments were carried out under the same steroid-free conditions. For reporter assays, cells were steroid-starved for 2 days in DMEM containing 3% charcoal stripped FBS, and transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000.

Transformed bacteria were cultured at 37 °C until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.8. The culturing was continued for 4 h in the presence of 0.5 mm isopropylthiogalactopyranoside. The bacteria were then harvested and lysed by sonication in buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare). Then 50 μg of bead-bound GST-ERα were incubated overnight at 4 °C with extracts of 293T cells transfected with Fe65 constructs and washed 3 times with the lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Fe65 protein bound to the beads was released by boiling in sample buffer, resolved in an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE), and detected by IB analyses. Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol reagent and cDNA template synthesized from 2 μg of RNA using Oligo(dT)12–18 primer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase.

The suspension was incubated on ice for 30 min with a brief vortex every 5 min followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 rpm. The supernatant was then collected as nuclear proteins. For immunoprecipitations (IPs), cells suspended in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor mixture were lysed by sonication for 6 s with two repeats and incubation on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation, cellular extracts were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and with beads for 2 h. The beads were washed with cold lysis buffer three times and boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer to release the precipitates. For IB analyses, precipitates or cellular extracts were separated in SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with cognate antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) were used to detect proteins. For chromatin IP (ChIP) assays, cells were plated in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS.

https://openalex.org/W2071419643,"Correct positioning of neurotransmitter-gated receptors at postsynapses is essential for synaptic transmission. At Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular junctions, clustering of levamisole-sensitive acetylcholine receptors (L-AChRs) requires the muscle-secreted scaffolding protein LEV-9, a multidomain factor containing complement control protein (CCP) modules. Here we show that LEV-9 needs to be cleaved at its C terminus to exert its function. LEV-9 cleavage is not required for trafficking nor secretion but directly controls scaffolding activity. The cleavage site is evolutionarily conserved, and post-translational cleavage ensures the structural and functional decoupling between different isoforms encoded by the lev-9 gene. Data mining indicates that most human CCP-containing factors are likely cleaved C-terminally from CCP tandems, suggesting that not only domain architectures but also cleavage location can be conserved in distant architecturally related proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2092824976,"Introduction The aim of this work was to evaluate the role of human plasma prekallikrein assembly and processing in cells and to determine whether proteoglycans, along with high molecular weight kininogen (H-kininogen), influence this interaction. Methods We used the endothelial cell line ECV304 and the epithelial cell lines CHO-K1 (wild type) and CHO-745 (deficient in proteoglycans). Prekallikrein endocytosis was studied using confocal microscopy, and prekallikrein cleavage/activation was determined by immunoblotting using an antibody directed to the prekallikrein sequence C364TTKTSTR371 and an antibody directed to the entire H-kininogen molecule. Results At 37°C, prekallikrein endocytosis was assessed in the absence and presence of exogenously applied H-kininogen and found to be 1,418.4±0.010 and 1,070.3±0.001 pixels/cell, respectively, for ECV304 and 1,319.1±0.003 and 631.3±0.001 pixels/cell, respectively, for CHO-K1. No prekallikrein internalization was observed in CHO-745 in either condition. Prekallikrein colocalized with LysoTracker in the absence and presence of exogenous H-kininogen at levels of 76.0% and 88.5%, respectively, for ECV304 and at levels of 40.7% and 57.0%, respectively, for CHO-K1. After assembly on the cell surface, a plasma kallikrein fragment of 53 kDa was predominant in the incubation buffer of all the cell lines studied, indicating specific proteolysis; plasma kallikrein fragments of 48–44 kDa and 34–32 kDa were also detected in the incubation buffer, indicating non-specific cleavage. Bradykinin free H-kininogen internalization was not detected in CHO-K1 or CHO-745 cells at 37°C. Conclusion The prekallikrein interaction with the cell surface is temperature-dependent and independent of exogenously applied H-kininogen, which results in prekallikrein endocytosis promoted by proteoglycans.

Since women with prior gestational diabetes (pGDM) display a generally young population at high risk of developing diabetes and associated cardiovascular complications, we aimed to assess whether myocardial lipid accumulation can be detected at early stages of glucose intolerance and relates to markers of hepatic steatosis (Fatty Liver Index), cardiac function, insulin sensitivity and secretion.Myocardial lipid content (MYCL), left-ventricular function (1H-magnetic-resonance-spectroscopy and -imaging), insulin sensitivity/secretion (oral glucose tolerance test) and the fatty liver index (FLI) were assessed in 35 pGDM (45.6±7.0 years, 28.3±4.8 kg/m2) and 14 healthy control females (CON; 44.7±9.8 years, 26.1±2.5 kg/m2), matching for age and body-mass-index (each p>0.1).Of 35 pGDM, 9 displayed normal glucose tolerance (NGT), 6 impaired glucose regulation (IGR) and 20 had been already diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). MYCL and cardiac function were comparable between pGDM and CON; in addition, no evidence of left-ventricular dysfunction was observed. MYCL was inversely correlated with the ejection fraction in T2DM (R = -0.45, p<0.05), while the FLI was tightly correlated with metabolic parameters (such as HbA1C, fasting plasma glucose and HDL-cholesterol) and rose along GT-groups.There is no evidence of cardiac steatosis in middle-aged women with prior gestational diabetes, suggesting that cardiac complications might develop later in the time-course of diabetes and may be accelerated by the co-existence of further risk factors, whereas hepatic steatosis remains a valid biomarker for metabolic diseases even in this rather young female cohort."
https://openalex.org/W2070438094,"There is an acute need for better tools to extract knowledge from the growing flood of sequence data. For example, thousands of complete genomes have been sequenced, and their metabolic networks inferred. Such data should enable a better understanding of evolution. However, most existing network analysis methods are based on pair-wise comparisons, and these do not scale to thousands of genomes. Here we propose the use of weighted graphs as a data structure to enable large-scale phylogenetic analysis of networks. We have developed three types of weighted graph for enzymes: taxonomic (these summarize phylogenetic importance), isoenzymatic (these summarize enzymatic variety/redundancy), and sequence-similarity (these summarize sequence conservation); and we applied these types of weighted graph to survey prokaryotic metabolism. To demonstrate the utility of this approach we have compared and contrasted the large-scale evolution of metabolism in Archaea and Eubacteria. Our results provide evidence for limits to the contingency of evolution."
