We previously demonstrated that the α and γ subunits of ENaC are cleaved during maturation near consensus sites for furin cleavage. Using site-specific mutagenesis of channel subunits, ENaC expression in furin-deficient cells, and furin-specific inhibitors, we now report that ENaC cleavage correlates with channel activity. Channel activity in furin-deficient cells was rescued by expression of furin. Our data provide the first example of a vertebrate ion channel that is a substrate for furin and whose activity is dependent on its proteolysis.

Epithelial Na+ channels are expressed in apical membranes of high resistance Na+-transporting epithelia. These channels have a key role in the regulation of extracellular fluid volume, blood pressure, and airway fluid volume. ENaCs 1The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial Na+ channel; CAP, channel-activating protease; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; α1-AT, α1-antitrypsin; α1-PDX, Portland variant of α1-AT; TGN, trans-Golgi network. 1The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial Na+ channel; CAP, channel-activating protease; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; α1-AT, α1-antitrypsin; α1-PDX, Portland variant of α1-AT; TGN, trans-Golgi network. are composed of three structurally related subunits, termed α, β, and γ, with a presumed α2β1γ1 subunit stoichiometry (1Kosari F.

Chem. 1998; 273: 681-684Google Scholar). Each subunit has two membrane-spanning domains that are connected by a large extracellular loop and intracellular NH2 and COOH termini. Residues preceding and within the second membrane-spanning domain form the channel pore (4Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. Bucher D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28484-28490Google Scholar, 5Sheng S.

A. 1999; 96: 4170-4175Google Scholar).Previous studies have demonstrated that ENaC activity is regulated by proteases. Extracellular trypsin has been shown to increase channel activity, while extracellular serine protease inhibitors, such as aprotinin and bikunin, have been shown to decrease channel activity (7Vallet V.

Channel activation by proteases likely reflects changes in channel gating (8ChraÏbi A. Vallet V. Firsov D. Hess S.K. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 127-138Google Scholar, 12Caldwell R.A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C190-C194Google Scholar). ENaCs characteristically have long open and closed times, generally on the order of seconds (13Kemendy A.E. Kleyman T.R. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C825-C837Google Scholar, 14Palmer L.G. Frindt G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 35-45Google Scholar). However, a population of channels has been described that exhibit only brief (50 ms) openings and have long closed states (13Kemendy A.E. Kleyman T.R. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C825-C837Google Scholar, 14Palmer L.G. Frindt G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 35-45Google Scholar). Caldwell et al. (12Caldwell R.A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C190-C194Google Scholar) recently reported that extracellular trypsin converts these near-silent Na+ channels to channels that exhibit the typically long open and closed times. A family of channel-activating serine proteases, referred to as CAPs, have been identified based on their ability to activate ENaC when co-expressed in heterologous systems (7Vallet V. Chraïbi A. Gaeggeler H.-P. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1997; 389: 607-610Google Scholar, 15Vuagniaux G. Vallet V. Jaeger N.F. Hummler E. Rossier B.C. J. Gen.

These serine proteases include CAP1 (or prostasin), CAP2, CAP3, and a member of a family of transmembrane serine proteases (TMPRSS3) (7Vallet V. Chraïbi A. Gaeggeler H.-P. Horisberger J.-D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1997; 389: 607-610Google Scholar, 15Vuagniaux G. Vallet V. Jaeger N.F. Hummler E. Rossier B.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 191-201Google Scholar, 16Guipponi M. Vuagniaux G.

Rossier B.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2829-2836Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether proteolysis of ENaC subunits or cleavage of a distinct regulatory protein is responsible for the activation of Na+ channels.We recently reported that maturation of mouse ENaC in both Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells involves proteolytic cleavage of the α and γ subunits (17Hughey R.P. Mueller G.M. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Harkleroad K.L. Carattino M.D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37073-37082Google Scholar). Expression of individual subunits revealed full-length forms of the α, β, and γ subunits (95, 96, and 93 kDa, respectively) that had immature N-glycans. However, co-expression of the three subunits revealed a second form for each subunit (65 kDa for α, 110 kDa for β, and 75 kDa for γ) that exhibited complex-type N-glycans consistent with processing during transit through the Golgi complex (17Hughey R.P. Mueller G.M. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Harkleroad K.L. Carattino M.D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37073-37082Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that the 65-kDa form of α and the 75-kDa form of γ are the COOH-terminal fragments of cleaved subunits (see Fig. 1). NH2-terminal fragments of α (30 kDa) and γ (18 kDa) also co-immunoprecipitated with the channel (17Hughey R.P. Mueller G.M. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Harkleroad K.L. Carattino M.D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37073-37082Google Scholar). This information allowed us to predict the regions where cleavage of the α and γ subunits likely occurred. These regions in the extracellular domains of both α and γ contained consensus motifs for cleavage by furin (minimal sequence of RXXR ↓ where R is Arg and ↓ is the cleavage site) that were conserved across species (for review, see Refs. 18Zhou A. Webb G. Zhu S. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20745-20748Google Scholar, 19Rockwell N.C. Krysan D.J. Komiyama T. Fuller R.S. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4525-4548Google Scholar, 20Thomas G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 753-766Google Scholar and Supplemental Table I). Furin is a well characterized proprotein processing endoprotease that is localized in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and shuttles between the TGN and plasma membrane (21Jean F. Thomas L. Molloy S.S. Liu G. Jarvis M.A. Nelson J.A. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2864-2869Google Scholar). We now report that ENaC maturation and activation involves furin-dependent cleavage.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESVector Preparation, Cell Culture, and Transfections—Preparation of carboxyl-terminal and double epitope-tagged mENaC subunit cDNAs were described previously (17Hughey R.P. Mueller G.M. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Harkleroad K.L. Carattino M.D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37073-37082Google Scholar). Point mutations were generated in α or γ mENaC cDNAs cloned into pCDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) using a two-step PCR method (22Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Avery D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8572-8581Google Scholar).Wild type parental CHO and furin-deficient CHO cell lines were obtained from Stephen Leppla (National Institute of Dental Research, Bethesda, MD) (23Gordon V.M. Klimpel K.R. Arora H. Henderson M.A. Leppla S.H. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 82-87Google Scholar) and cultured as described previously (24Altschuler Y. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Bruns J.B. Apodaca G. Weisz O.A. Hughey R.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 819-831Google Scholar). Transient expression of mENaC subunit cDNAs for biochemical studies was carried out in CHO cells (17Hughey R.P. Mueller G.M. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Harkleroad K.L. Carattino M.D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37073-37082Google Scholar). Transient expression of mENaC subunit cDNAs for electrophysiological studies in CHO cells were previously described (25Booth R.E. Tong Q. Medina J. Snyder P.M. Patel P. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41367-41379Google Scholar). Whole-cell macroscopic current recordings in CHO cells were obtained at a holding potential of –80 mV, or with voltage ramps from 40 to –100 mV (25Booth R.E. Tong Q. Medina J. Snyder P.M. Patel P. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41367-41379Google Scholar).Mouse cortical collecting duct cells (mpkCCDc14) were obtained from Alain Vandewalle (Paris, France) and maintained in defined medium as described previously (26Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F. Pascual-Letallec L. Kahn A. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Rossier B.C. Vandewalle A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 10: 923-934Google Scholar). Cells were grown on permeable filter transwells (Costar, Corning, NY) for 7 days prior to the addition of either α1-antitrypsin (α1-AT) or the variant α1-PDX at 8 μm for 16 h (Calbiochem) (21Jean F. Thomas L. Molloy S.S. Liu G. Jarvis M.A. Nelson J.A. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2864-2869Google Scholar). Equivalent short curcuit currents in mpkCCDc14 cells were measured with a portable EVOM (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL).Sodium Channel Expression and Channel Activity in Xenopus Oocytes—Wild type and epitope-tagged ENaC subunit cRNAs were prepared using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). The mENaC subunit cRNAs (1 ng per subunit) were injected into oocytes, and electrophysiological measurements were performed after 24 h as described previously (27Sheng S. McNulty K.A. Harvey J.M. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44091-44098Google Scholar). The difference in measured current in the presence and absence of amiloride (10 μm) was used to identify ENaC currents produced by different subunit combinations. Where indicated, trypsin (2 μg/ml; Sigma) was subsequently added to the bath for 5 min before a second measurement. Animal protocols were approved by the University of Pittsburgh's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis of ENaC epitope-tagged subunits expressed in either CHO cells, MDCK cells, or oocytes were carried out as described previously (17Hughey R.P. Mueller G.M. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Harkleroad K.L. Carattino M.D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37073-37082Google Scholar, 28Bruns J.B. Baofeng H. Ahn Y.J. Sheng S. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F600-F609Google Scholar).RESULTSKey Arg residues within consensus motifs for furin cleavage in the α and γ subunits were mutated to Ala, as indicated in Fig. 1, A and B. The α mutants had either a single mutation (R1202A, R2205A, R3208A, or R4231A) or multiple mutations (R2205A/R3208A, R1202A/R4231A, or R2205A/R3208A/ R4231A). As shown in Fig. 1A, mutation of R4 clearly altered the pattern of cleavage in MDCK cells observed from the COOH terminus, while mutation of either R1 or R2 clearly altered the pattern of cleavage from the NH2 terminus (producing a larger fragment in each case). These results indicated that α subunit cleavage occurs at both the RSTR205 ↓ and RSAR231 ↓ motifs. This was confirmed by our finding that cleavage was totally abolished by coincident mutation of both motifs (see mutants R1,4 or R2,3,4). As shown in Fig. 1B, mutation of the single consensus motif for furin cleavage in γ (R143A) blocked cleavage, as evidenced by the loss of the 75- and 18-kDa fragments that were observed by expression of the wild type γ with αβENaC. These data suggest that furin may have a major role in the proteolytic maturation of Na+ channels in MDCK cells. Similar data were obtained with many of the furin site mutants in CHO cells (data not shown).We also observed that the α (R2,3,4) or γ (R143A) mutants that blocked cleavage in MDCK cells exhibited reduced functional ENaC expression in Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 2). Analyses of ENaC subunit expression in oocytes by immunoblot (Fig. 2, D and E) indicated that the wild type α and γ subunits were cleaved in ooctyes yielding the expected fragments (65 and 30 kDa for α and 75 and 18 kDa for γ). These proteolytic fragments were not observed when consensus sites for furin cleavage were mutated in the α or γ subunits. Whole-cell ENaC currents in oocytes expressing both the α (R2,3,4) and γ mutants were only 12 ± 1% of the current recorded in oocytes expressing wild type channels. We also examined whether an exogenous serine proteases can activate ENaC in the absence of furin cleavage sites. Subsequent addition of external trypsin to oocytes expressing one or both mutant subunits for 5 min resulted in large amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents that were similar in magnitude to that observed after trypsin treatment of oocytes expressing wild type ENaC.Fig. 2ENaC activity and cleavage in oocytes are blocked by mutation of consensus sites for furin cleavage. Xenopus oocytes were co-injected with either cRNAs for the wild type channel (WT, αβγ) (A–C), cRNAs for α with mutation of the three furin consensus sites (αMUT, R2,3,4) and wild type βγ (A), cRNAs for γ with a mutation of the one furin consensus site (γMUT, R143A) and wild type αβ (B), or cRNAs for αMUT, wild type β, and γMUT (C). Whole-cell amiloride-sensitive currents were measured as described previously 1 day after injection (28Bruns J.B. Baofeng H. Ahn Y.J. Sheng S. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F600-F609Google Scholar). Trypsin (2 μg/ml) was subsequently added to the bath for 5 min before a second measurement as indicated. Normalized data (mean ± S.E.) are presented from two experiments (n = 16–20 for each condition) with the current from the wild type subunits (without trypsin) set as 100% (I/IWT(–trypsin)). ENaC activity of oocytes expressing mutant subunits was significantly (*) less than that produced by wild type channels (p < 0.001). Oocytes injected with wild type (D and E), αMUTβγ (D), or αβγMUT (E) (10 each) were also solubilized in lysis buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-HA (N-term) or anti-V5 (C-term) antibodies after immunoprecipitation using anti-V5 (C-term) antibodies. Non-injected ooctyes (–) were used as a control in each case. The cleavage fragments for α (65 and 30 kDa) and γ (93 and 18 kDa) were absent when the consensus sites for furin cleavage within the α or γ subunits were mutated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)ENaC processing and functional expression were also examined in both wild type and furin deficient CHO cells (23Gordon V.M. Klimpel K.R. Arora H. Henderson M.A. Leppla S.H. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 82-87Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, cleavage fragments for α (65 and 30 kDa) and γ (75 and 18 kDa) found in parental CHO cells were absent when αβγENaC was expressed in furin-deficient CHO cells. When furin was co-expressed with αβγENaC in these cells, the cleaved forms of α and γ were clearly evident. Coexpression of furin with αβγENaC in the parental CHO cells also increased the levels of cleaved forms of α and γ in this T7-vaccinia expression system. Finally, it was clear that glycoprotein processing and membrane trafficking in the biosynthetic pathway were normal in the furin-deficient cells, with or without co-expression with furin, as the processing of the β subunit in cells expressing αβγENaC was identical to that observed in the parental CHO cells (data not shown).Fig. 3ENaC cleavage and activity are furin-dependent. A and B, parental (control) or furin-deficient CHO cells were transiently transfected with either HA-α-V5, β(FLAG), and γ(muc) (A) or α(myc), β(FLAG), and HA-γ-V5 (B), with (+) or without (–) furin. In each case ENaC was immunoprecipitated with the anti-V5 antibody (COOH terminus) and immunoblotted (IB) with the anti-HA (N-term) antibody prior to stripping and reprobing the blot with anti-V5 (C-term) antibody. Estimated molecular weights of subunits and cleaved fragments are indicated in kilodaltons. The asterisk refers to a γ band migrating slower than 93 kDa that likely represents N-glycan processing in the absence of furin. C, parental (n = 8) or furin-deficient (n = 11) CHO cells were transiently transfected with αβγENaC and whole-cell macroscopic current recordings were obtained at a holding potential of –80 mV. Furin-deficient cells were also transiently co-transfected with furin (n = 6) where indicated. While the capacitance was not different for the three conditions (left panel), whole-cell amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents (right panel, pA/pF) were significantly (*) lower in furin-deficient cells (p < 0.05) when compared with parental cells. Amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents were significantly (**) increased by co-expression of furin (p < 0.05) when compared with furin-deficient cells expressing ENaC alone. Representative current tracings for each condition elicited by a voltage gradient from +40 to –100 mV in the absence and presence (see arrow) of amiloride (10 μm) are shown above the two panels. D, mouse cortical collecting duct cells (mpkCCDc14) were grown on Costar transwells for 7 days prior to the addition of either α1-AT, the variant α1-PDX at 8 μm for 16 h, or no addition. The mean ± S.E. for the amiloride-sensitive equivalent short circuit currents from two experiments (n = 11 for each condition) are presented. Treatment with the furin inhibitor α1-PDX inhibited ENaC activity significantly (*) when compared with treatment with the control α1-AT (p < 0.001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We examined whether furin processing of ENaC in CHO cells affects its functional activity by measuring whole-cell amiloride-sensitive currents in both parental and furin-deficient CHO cells that were expressing αβγENaC (Fig. 3C). Whole cell currents were dramatically and significantly lower in furin-deficient CHO cells than in parental CHO cells, while capacitance was unchanged. However, co-expression of furin with αβγENaC in furin-deficient cells produced currents that were similar in magnitude to that observed by the expression of αβγENaC in the parental cells. Furin-dependent cleavage of αβγENaC appears to be required for expression of robust channel activity in CHO cells.Previous studies have shown that furin cycles between the TGN and plasma membrane (21Jean F. Thomas L. Molloy S.S. Liu G. Jarvis M.A. Nelson J.A. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2864-2869Google Scholar). The bioengineered Portland variant of α1-antitrypsin (α1-PDX) binds irreversibly to furin at the plasma membrane and enhances its degradation, blocking furin-dependent processing of proteins in the TGN (21Jean F. Thomas L. Molloy S.S. Liu G. Jarvis M.A. Nelson J.A. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2864-2869Google Scholar). Endogenous ENaC activity has been well characterized in a mouse cortical collecting duct cell line (mpkCCDc14) (26Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F. Pascual-Letallec L. Kahn A. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Rossier B.C. Vandewalle A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 10: 923-934Google Scholar). Purified recombinant α1-PDX was added to the apical and basolateral media of polarized cultures of mpkCCDc14 cells for 16 h. As shown in Fig. 3D, incubation of mpkCCDc14 cells with α1-PDX blocked expression of an amiloride-sensitive equivalent short circuit current in these cells. No inhibition was observed when cells were incubated with control α1-antitrypsin. High transepithelial resistance was maintained in cells treated with α1-PDX indicating that the cells were not adversely affected by the loss of furin activity (data not shown). Thus, endogenous ENaC activity is furin-dependent in mpkCCDc14 cells.DISCUSSIONOur data and previous studies support the hypothesis that ENaC activity is regulated by proteolytic cleavage of ENaC subunits. In CHO cells, Xenopus oocytes and mpkCCDc14 cells, a major protease that appears to be responsible for activation of Na+ channels is furin. This conclusion is based on our findings that (i) cleavage and activity of ENaC were restored in furin-deficient CHO cells by co-transfection with the cDNA for furin, (ii) inhibition of ENaC cleavage by mutation of essential Arg residues within consensus sites for furin cleavage inhibited ENaC activity in Xenopus oocytes, and (iii) endogenous ENaC activity was blocked by the addition of a furin-specific inhibitor to the media of cultured collecting duct cells. Furin is one of seven members of the family of proprotein convertases (for review, see Refs. 18Zhou A. Webb G. Zhu S. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20745-20748Google Scholar, 19Rockwell N.C. Krysan D.J. Komiyama T. Fuller R.S. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4525-4548Google Scholar, 20Thomas G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 753-766Google Scholar). Furin is best known for its ability to cleave growth factors, hormones, serum proteins, coagulation factors, cell surface receptors, extracellular matrix proteins, and viral envelope glycoprotein precursors in the biosynthetic pathway. Furin also cleaves bacterial toxins at the cell surface or within endosomes (23Gordon V.M. Klimpel K.R. Arora H. Henderson M.A. Leppla S.H. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 82-87Google Scholar). An Arg residue is essential at the position immediately preceding the cleavage site (P1 (–1) position). At least two out of the three residues at P2 (–2), P4 (–4), and P6 (–6) must be basic (Arg or Lys) for efficient cleavage by furin (19Rockwell N.C. Krysan D.J. Komiyama T. Fuller R.S. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4525-4548Google Scholar, 20Thomas G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 753-766Google Scholar). Thus, our finding that α ENaC is cleaved at the RRRSTR ↓ site and γ ENaC at the TPRKRR ↓ site fits these requirements. However, there are numerous examples where furin cleaves at suboptimal sites such as RXXR ↓ consistent with the second cleavage of α that we observed at the STRDLR ↓ site (19Rockwell N.C. Krysan D.J. Komiyama T. Fuller R.S. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4525-4548Google Scholar, 20Thomas G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 753-766Google Scholar).It is possible that ENaC can be cleaved by other proprotein convertases. PC4 expression is restricted to testicular spermatogenic cells (30Mbikay M.

A. 1997; 94: 6842-6846Google Scholar), and PC2 and PC1/PC3 are found only in neuroendocrine tissues (18Zhou A. Webb G. Zhu S. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20745-20748Google Scholar), making these three convertases less relevant to ENaC cleavage in epithelial cells. In contrast, furin, PACE4, PC5/PC6 (A and B), and PC7 are expressed in a broad range of tissues. Little is known about the specificity of PACE4 except that it is implicated in cleavage of TGF-β-related differentiation factors at the RXK/RR ↓ site (31Tsuji A. Ikoma T. Hashimoto E. Matsuda Y. Protein Eng. 2000; 15: 123-130Google Scholar). Preliminary characterization of recombinant PC7 indicates that it may have sequence specificity similar to furin, but it seems to have an absolute requirement for an Arg residue at P4 (–4) and appears to process substrates than are distinct from those processed by furin in vivo (32van de Loo J.W. Creemers J.W. Bright N.A. Young B.D. Roebroek A.J. Van de Ven W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27116-27123Google Scholar). PC6B has overlapping specificity with furin (33Cui Y. Jean F. Thomas G. Christian J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4735-4743Google Scholar) and is inhibited by α1-PDX in vitro (34Jean F. Stella K. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Reason A.J. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7293-7298Google Scholar). Although furin, PC7, and PC6B all cycle between the cell surface and the TGN, Jean et al. (21Jean F. Thomas L. Molloy S.S. Liu G. Jarvis M.A. Nelson J.A. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2864-2869Google Scholar) found that cells expressing furin, but not cells expressing either PC6B or PC7, could internalize α1-PDX. Our data and these previous studies indicate that furin is a key protease responsible for cleavage and functional activation of ENaC in Xenopus oocytes, CHO cells, and mpkCCDc14 cells.ENaC activity in the Xenopus cell line A6 and in the mouse kidney cell line mpkCCDc14 is reduced by extracellular aprotinin, a serine protease inhibitor. Aprotinin does not inhibit furin (35Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppla S.H. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Google Scholar), suggesting that other proteases may have a secondary role in regulating ENaC activity. A family of serine proteases has been identified that could alternatively cleave and activate ENaC, including CAP1 (or prostasin), CAP2, CAP3, and TMPRSS3 (7Vallet V. Chraïbi A. Gaeggeler H.-P.

Antonarakis S.E. Rossier B.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2829-2836Google Scholar). Previous studies suggest that only a fraction of channels expressed at the plasma membrane are cleaved (17Hughey R.P. Mueller G.M. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Harkleroad K.L. Carattino M.D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37073-37082Google Scholar). Non-cleaved channels could be substrates for CAPs, proprotein convertases, or other, as yet unidentified, proteases that are expressed at the cell surface or within recycling compartments.Our data, in the context of previous studies (8ChraÏbi A. Vallet V. Firsov D. Hess S.K. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 127-138Google Scholar, 12Caldwell R.A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Am. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 37073-37082Google Scholar), suggest that proteolytic cleavage of ENaC subunits activates ENaC by enhancing channel open probability. It is unclear why cleavage of ENaC extracellular domains produces this effect. We recently identified a region within the extracellular domains of the α and γ subunits where the introduction of mutations at key His residues (αHis282 and γHis239) affects gating in response to extracellular cations (Na+ and Ni2+) (36Sheng S. Perry C.J. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50098-50111Google Scholar, 37Sheng S. Bruns J.B. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9743-9749Google Scholar). These observations suggest that α and γ subunit extracellular domains have important roles in modulating ENaC activity, although mechanisms by which this occurs remain to be defined. ENaCs are members of the degenerin/ENaC superfamily that includes a group of structurally related ion channels that are involved in diverse biological processes (38Kellenberger S. Schild L. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Google Scholar). While it is not known whether proteolysis has a role in regulating the activity of other members of this ion channel"
https://openalex.org/W1977914780,"Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) express constitutively activated forms of the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase protein, resulting from oncogenic mutations in the extracellular, juxtamembrane, or kinase domains. KIT oncoproteins are detected early in GIST tumorigenesis, and most GIST patients respond well to treatment with the KIT kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (STI571, Gleevec®). However, GISTs can develop resistance to imatinib, and additional therapeutic strategies are needed. Little is known about oncogenic KIT signal transduction in GISTs, and whether the type of KIT mutation accounts for selective activation of downstream signaling intermediates. We therefore evaluated KIT downstream signaling profiles in 15 primary GISTs with mutations in KIT exons 9, 11, 13, and 17, and in two human GIST cell lines. All GISTs showed constitutive phosphorylation at KIT tyrosine residues Y703 and Y721. Additionally, most GISTs showed activation of MAPK p42/44, AKT, S6K, STAT1, and STAT3. STAT5 and JNK were not demonstrably activated in any GIST. Using GIST in vitro models, we showed that activation of MAPK p42/44, AKT, and S6K was KIT dependent, whereas STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation was only partially dependent on KIT activation. Correlation of activated signaling pathways with the type of KIT mutation revealed low levels of AKT phosphorylation in exon 9 mutant GISTs in contrast to a subset of GISTs with exon 11 mutations. However, additional factors are likely to modify the engagement of signaling pathways in GISTs as suggested by the fact that four GISTs with identical KIT exon 9 mutations had differential activation of MAPK p42/44 and STAT proteins. In summary, in this first report on KIT signal transduction in primary GISTs and GIST cell lines, we identified pathways that are constitutively activated in a KIT-dependent manner and therefore warrant further study as molecular targets in GISTs."

The importance of alternative splicing is further illustrated by the increasing number of human diseases that have been attributed to mis-splicing events. Appropriate spatial and temporal generation of splicing variants demands that alternative splicing be subjected to extensive regulation, similar to transcriptional control. The Clk (Cdc2-like kinase) family has been implicated in splicing control and consists of at least four members. Through extensive screening of a chemical library, we found that a benzothiazole compound, TG003, had a potent inhibitory effect on the activity of Clk1/Sty. TG003 inhibited SF2/ASF-dependent splicing of β-globin pre-mRNA in vitro by suppression of Clk-mediated phosphorylation. This drug also suppressed serine/arginine-rich protein phosphorylation, dissociation of nuclear speckles, and Clk1/Sty-dependent alternative splicing in mammalian cells. Consistently, administration of TG003 rescued the embryonic defects induced by excessive Clk activity in Xenopus. Thus, TG003, a novel inhibitor of Clk family will be a valuable tool to dissect the regulatory mechanisms involving serine/arginine-rich protein phosphorylation signaling pathways in vivo, and may be applicable for the therapeutic manipulation of abnormal splicing.

We addressed the role of Src phosphorylation of the GTPase dynamin-2 in the mechanism of caveolae release and albumin transport. Studies were made in microvascular endothelial cells in which the uptake of cholera toxin subunit B, a marker of caveolae, and 125I-albumin was used to assess caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Albumin binding to the 60-kDa cell surface albumin-binding protein, gp60, induced Src activation (phosphorylation on Tyr416) within 1 min and resulted in Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin-2, which increased its association with caveolin-1, the caveolae scaffold protein. Expression of kinase-defective Src mutant interfered with the association between dynamin-2, which caveolin-1 and prevented the uptake of albumin. Expression of non-Src-phosphorylatable dynamin (Y231F/Y597F) resulted in reduced association with caveolin-1, and in contrast to WT-dynamin-2, the mutant failed to translocate to the caveolin-rich membrane fraction. The Y231F/Y597F dynamin-2 mutant expression also resulted in impaired albumin and cholera toxin subunit B uptake and reduced transendothelial albumin transport.

The GTPase dynamin on oligomerization probably plays a crucial role in transcytosis because it triggers fission by constriction of caveolae necks subsequent to the hydrolysis of GTP (17Schnitzer J.E.

In the present study, we delineated the regulation of dynamin-2 activation via Src kinase and its role in the mechanism of caveolae-mediated endocytosis. We demonstrate that gp60 activation induced Src-dependent phosphorylation of dynamin-2, the resultant association of dynamin-2 with caveolin-1 and thereby the caveolae-mediated endocytosis and transport of albumin. Endothelial Cell Cultures—Rat lung microvessel endothelial cells (RLMVEC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin as described previously (13John T.A. Vogel S.M. Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. Minshall R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: L187-L196Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Reagents—All of the reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. PP2 was purchased from Calbiochem. Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing NaHCO3 (4.2 mm) and HEPES (10 mm) was adjusted to pH 7.4. Bovine serum albumin (fraction V, 99% pure, endotoxin-free, cold alcohol-precipitated) was dissolved in HBSS. Plasmid Transfection—RLMVEC grown to 50-60% confluence in 60-mm-diameter plates were co-transfected with either wild type (WT) or dominant-negative (DN) Src (Y527F,K295M) in vector pSM (a gift from Dr. Silvio Gutkind, National Institute of Dental Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and pEGFP (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and were used 24-48 h after transfection. Dynamin-2 Constructs and Stable Endothelial Cell Line Selection—Rat dynamin-2 wild type and K44A mutant were generous gifts from Dr. Mark McNiven (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). Mutants Y231F and Y597F were generated through a two-step PCR as described previously (24Andersson E. Hellman L. Gullberg U. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4747-4753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the first step, two separate reactions with primer pairs Dyn2-F (5′-AGGAATTCCACCATGGGCAACCGCGGGATGG-3′) and Dyn2-Y231F-R (5′-ACGCCGATGAAGCCTCTTCTCAAGG-3′) or Dyn2-R (5′-GGAGGAAGCTTGTCGAGCAGGGACGGCTCGG) and Dyn2-Y231F-F (5′-TTGAGAAGAGGCTTCATCGGCGTGG-3′) were used to introduce site-specific mutations in codon 231 while amplifying either the region 5′ or 3′ of the base pair change. Similarly, primer pairs Dyn2-F/Dyn2-Y597F-R (5′-GCAGGTCCTTGAAGACGTTCCTCTG-3′) or Dyn2-R/Dyn2-Y597F-F (5′-GGAACGTCTTCAAGGACCTGCGACAG-3′) were used to generate site-specific changes in codon 597. The resulting PCR products were gel-purified and used as overlapping templates in the second step reaction with primer pair Dyn2-F/Dyn2-R to generate full-length Dyn2 mutants. The double mutant was generated as described above for the Y231F mutation using the Y597F mutant as a template. Primer pair Dyn2-F/Dyn2-R was also used to amplify Dyn2 wild type and the K44A mutant. FLAG-tagged retroviral constructs were generated by first cloning into pCMV-Tag4 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and then into the EcoRI and PsiI sites of pLXSN/EB vector, a modified pLXSN vector containing an enhanced polylinker site (5′-GAATTCCAGTTAACTGGGCCCGAGCTCTCGAGATCTTATAATCGATGCGGCCGCGTCGACTGGGATCC-3′) (provided by Dr. O. Colamonici, University of Illinois at Chicago). Dynamin-2 FLAG-tagged constructs were transfected into Phoenix-Eco cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Retroviral vector-rich medium was harvested 48 h post-transfection, clarified by centrifugation, and added to 60-80% confluent RLMVEC. Medium was replaced 12 h later with growth medium containing G418 (300 μg/ml) for stable selection. Stable lines were chosen from clones of each group based on Western blot analysis of FLAG expression. The cell lines used herein expressed approximately equal levels of FLAG-tagged dynamin-2 (wild-type or mutant forms) (see Fig. 4A). Antibodies and Fluorescent Probes—Monoclonal Abs for dynamin-2, caveolin-1, PY20, and Jak-1 and polyclonal caveolin Ab were from BD Biosciences. PY416-Src monoclonal Ab was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). FLAG monoclonal Ab was from Sigma. pJak-1 polyclonal Ab was from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). c-Src polyclonal Ab, myc monoclonal Ab, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG, albumin, and cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) Alexa Fluor conjugates and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Anti-gp60 Ab was generated as described by us (10Tiruppathi C. Finnegan A. Malik A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—For Western blot analysis, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (30 min at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 44 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture), and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 15 min). For immunoprecipitations, the lysates were incubated with 1-10 μg/ml primary antibodies for 4 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight. Most of the dynamin-2 (endogenous or FLAG-tagged) was immunoprecipitated using this protocol as indicated by concentration of dynamin-2 in immunoprecipitates and disappearance of dynamin-2 from lysates after immunoprecipitation. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE as described previously (6Minshall R.D. Tiruppathi C. Vogel S.M. Niles W. Gilchrist A. Hamm H. Malik A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1057-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Dynamin-2—Confluent RLMVEC were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and incubated with serum-free medium for 12-15 h. The cells were then treated for 15 min with 10 μm Na3VO4 (protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor), 10 min with 15 μm PP2 (Src family kinase inhibitor), and/or 0-5 min with 1-30 mg/ml albumin, or 20 μg/ml anti-gp60 Ab in HBSS. The cells were then washed with PBS and lysed, and the lysates analyzed for dynamin-2 phosphorylation by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis using PY20 phosphotyrosine Ab. Relative intensity of phosphorylated dynamin was measured using Scion Image (National Institutes of Health). Subcellular Fractionation—Confluent cells were treated with 30 mg/ml albumin, washed with PBS, and scraped in a detergent-free buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture). Samples were sonicated on ice four times using 30-s bursts with 30-s intervals and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h in a TLA55 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) at 4 °C. The 100,000 × g supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was compared with the pellet (membrane fraction). Equal amounts of protein were boiled in loading buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. 125I-Albumin Uptake and Transendothelial Transport—Transendothelial permeability of 125I-albumin of RLMVEC monolayers grown on clear microporous polyester Transwell membranes (12-mm diameter, 1-cm2 growth area, 0.4-μm pore size, Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA) was calculated as described previously (13John T.A. Vogel S.M. Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. Minshall R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: L187-L196Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Immunostaining and Confocal Microscopy—Confluent RLMVEC were washed with PBS, incubated for at least 3 h in serum-free medium, and incubated with Alexa 488- or 594-conjugated albumin or CTB in HEPES-buffered HBSS for 30-60 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the cells were washed with pH 2.5 buffer (0.2 m acetic acid and 0.5 m NaCl) to remove non-internalized/membrane-associated tracers. The cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and stained with anti-FLAG or anti-caveolin polyclonal Ab and the nuclear marker, DAPI (1 μg/ml), as described previously (13John T.A. Vogel S.M. Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. Minshall R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: L187-L196Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Non-confocal DAPI images were acquired using Hg lamp excitation and UV filter set. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope with 488- and 543-nm excitation laser lines. Fluorescence emission was detected in optical sections <1 μm in thickness (pinhole set to achieve 1 Airy unit) separately for each fluorophore using a multi-track configuration. Average whole cell fluorescence intensity (per pixel) in the acquired confocal images (n = 6/treatment group) was determined using Zeiss LSM 510 META software. Using the LSM 510 META z-sectioning software, orthogonal views (y-z) were obtained from sequential images acquired in 0.5-μm step increments. The average background fluorescence detected in each experimental condition was subtracted from the total fluorescence to yield specific cellular fluorescence intensity. Statistical Analysis—Statistical comparisons were made using two-tailed ANOVA with Bonferroni correction with the significance level set at p < 0.05. Gp60-mediated Src Activation and Endocytosis of Albumin—The activation of the albumin-binding protein, gp60, by the addition of a physiological concentration of albumin (1-30 mg/ml) or gp60-cross-linking using the anti-gp60 Ab (10-20 μg/ml) as described previously (6Minshall R.D. Tiruppathi C. Vogel S.M. Niles W. Gilchrist A. Hamm H. Malik A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1057-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 11Tiruppathi C. Song W. Bergenfeldt M. Sass P. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25968-25975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) resulted in Src kinase activation (Fig. 1A). Treatment of cells with Na3VO4 (tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor) or PP2 (Src kinase inhibitor) augmented or abolished the phosphorylation, respectively. We determined the uptake of fluorescent-albumin in cells treated with Na3VO4 in the presence of PP2. Albumin uptake was increased 30% compared with control cells, and it was blocked by treatment with PP2 (Fig. 1B). We also addressed the role of Src kinase in caveolae-mediated endocytosis by co-transfecting RLMVEC with WT-or DN-Src cDNA and green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNA (as a transfection marker). Alexa 594-albumin uptake was measured only in the GFP-positive cells. Cells transfected with DN-Src showed a 45% reduction in Alexa 594-albumin uptake compared with cells expressing WT-Src and 35% less uptake compared with cells transfected with GFP alone (Fig. 1C). Src Phosphorylation of Dynamin-2—Because dynamin-2 is important in caveolae-mediated endocytosis, we next addressed whether dynamin-2 is a target of Src kinase. RLMVEC lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-dynamin-2 Ab followed by Western blotting with phosphotyrosine Ab, PY20. As shown in Fig. 2A, dynamin-2 phosphorylation increased within 1 min of gp60 activation (i.e. within the time course of Src activation). Pretreatment with 10 μm Na3VO4 increased dynamin phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). Activation of gp60 further augmented the phosphorylation that was sensitive to Src kinase inhibition (Fig. 2B). Western blot of p(Y416)Src showed that activation of Src correlated with phosphorylation of dynamin-2. However, phosphorylation of another non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Jak-1, as determined by p(Y1022/1023)-Jak-1 immunoblot analysis, did not increase upon gp60 activation (Fig. 2B). Src-dependent Dynamin-2 Phosphorylation Induces Its Association with Caveolin-1—To address whether Src phosphorylation of dynamin-2 promotes its association with caveolin-1 and localizes dynamin to caveolae, detergent-soluble RLMVEC lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-dynamin-2 Ab, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-caveolin-1 and anti-Src Abs. Immunoprecipitation of dynamin-2 pulled down caveolin-1 as well as Src (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained using anti-caveolin-1 Ab for immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3A). To address whether the association of dynamin-2 and caveolin-1 was dependent on dynamin-2 phosphorylation, cell lysates prepared after gp60 stimulation were immunoprecipitated with dynamin-2 Ab and immunoblotted for caveolin-1 or dynamin-2. Fig. 3B shows the phosphorylation of dynamin-2 (top panel) and total dynamin-2 pulled down (middle panel). Gp60 activation increased the amount of caveolin-1 immunoprecipitated with dynamin-2 (bottom panel). Thus, phosphorylation of dynamin-2 promoted its association with caveolin-1. To address the role of Src in regulating the phosphorylation-dependent association of dynamin-2 and caveolin-1, co-immunoprecipitation of caveolin-1 with dynamin was assayed in cells pretreated with PP2. gp60 stimulation of cells induced the phosphorylation of dynamin-2 as well as caveolin-1 (Fig. 3C). Treatment of cells with PP2 decreased the amount of dynamin-2 recruited to caveolin-1 (Fig. 3C). Also, transfection of RLMVEC with dominant-negative Src decreased the gp60-activated phosphorylation of dynamin-2 and caveolin-1 as compared with phosphorylation of these proteins in empty vector- or WT-Src-transfected cells (Fig. 3D). The overexpression of WT-Src increased dynamin-2 phosphorylation, which enhanced the association between dynamin-2 and caveolin-1 (Fig. 3D). We next addressed the role of dynamin-2 residues Tyr231 and Tyr597, i.e. the tyrosine residues phosphorylated by Src (Fig. 4A) (25Ahn S. Maudsley S. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1185-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 26Ahn S. Kim J. Lucaveche C. Reedy M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26642-26651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) in the phosphorylation-dependent association of dynamin-2 and caveolin-1. We generated stable endothelial cell lines using retroviral vector pLXSN/Dyn-2/FLAG constructs (described under “Experimental Procedures”). Endothelial cells expressed the following constructs: WT dynamin-2; tyrosine phosphorylation-defective mutants (Y231F, Y597F, and Y231F/Y597F); and dominant-negative (GTPase-defective) dynamin-2 mutant (K44A). Phosphorylation of Y597F dynamin was reduced by 70%, and phosphorylation of Y231F was reduced by 50% compared with wild-type dynamin-2 (Fig. 4A), whereas the phosphorylation of double mutant Y231F/Y597F was reduced by 90% (Fig. 4A). Src activation as measured by the phosphorylation of Tyr416 on Src showed that Src activation was unaffected by the expression of WT or mutant forms of dynamin-2. The phosphorylation of Tyr14 on caveolin-1 (a substrate for Src kinase) (11Tiruppathi C. Song W. Bergenfeldt M. Sass P. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25968-25975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) was also unaffected by expression of the dynamin-2 constructs (Fig. 4A). To determine whether Tyr231 and Tyr597 phosphorylation was responsible for dynamin-2-caveolin-1 association, the expressed dynamin-2 constructs were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG Ab and immunoblotted with either anti-FLAG or anti-caveolin-1 Ab (Fig. 4B). Control cells (no stimulus applied) were compared with cells subjected to gp60 activation. To control for the level dynamin-2 mutant expressed and immunoprecipitated, the amount of co-immunoprecipitated caveolin-1 was normalized to the dynamin mutant (Fig. 4C). The association of caveolin-1 with Y231F, Y597F, and Y213F/Y597F dynamin-2 mutants was significantly reduced compared with the amount of caveolin-1 associated with WT or K44A dynamin-2. Both single Tyr point mutations, Y231F and Y597F, as well as the double mutant, Y231F/Y597F, showed reduced association with caveolin-1 following gp60 activation as compared with wild type and K44A dynamin-2 (Fig. 4C). The association of dynamin-2 with caveolin-1 was not altered by the GTPase-defective K44A mutation. These findings indicate that phosphorylation of Tyr231 and Tyr597 on dynamin-2 is a critical determinant of dynamin-2 association with caveolin-1. Src Phosphorylation of Dynamin-2 Induces Its Translocation to the Membrane—We addressed whether Src-mediated phosphorylation of dynamin-2 stimulates its translocation to caveolin-1-rich membrane fractions. Confluent RLMVEC expressing WT dynamin-2 or Y231F/Y597F were subjected to gp60 activation, and the cytosolic and membrane-enriched fractions were separated by high speed centrifugation. Fig. 5A shows that on gp60 activation, the amount of WT dynamin-2 increased in the membrane fraction, whereas the double tyrosine mutant, Y231F/Y597F, failed to translocate to this fraction. Fig. 5B shows the expression pattern of FLAG-tagged WT dynamin-2 (a and c) and Y231F/Y597F dynamin-2 (b and d) (red) together with caveolin-1 (green) before and after gp60 stimulation. As seen in the high magnification-merged images, gp60 stimulation induced an increase in the co-localized staining of WT dynamin-2 and caveolin-1 (a versus c), whereas the Y231F/Y597F dynamin-2-staining pattern did not change (b versus d). Orthogonal views (asterisk) of the optical sections showed an increase in the number of vesicles in which dynamin-2 and caveolin-1 co-localized following gp60 activation. In contrast, the Y231F/Y597F dynamin-2 mutant failed to co-localize with caveolin-1, indicating that Src phosphorylation of dynamin-2 is required for its association with caveolin-1. Src Phosphorylation of Dynamin-2 Is Required for Caveolae-mediated Endocytosis and Albumin Transport—We addressed the functional significance of Src phosphorylation of dynamin-2 on the uptake of albumin and CTB in confluent RLMVEC monolayers. Endothelial cells were incubated with Alexa 488-albumin or Alexa 488-CTB, permeabilized, and stained with anti-FLAG Ab followed by Alexa Fluor secondary Ab conjugates (Fig. 6A). Albumin uptake in Y597F-or Y231IF/Y597F double mutant-expressing cells was reduced by 45% compared with RLMVEC expressing wild-type dynamin-2 or cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 6B). The albumin uptake in the Y231F-expressing cells was not significantly different from empty vector or wild-type dynamin-2-transfected cells (Fig. 6B). In K44A dynamin-2 mutant-expressing cells, albumin up-take was reduced by 55%. We also measured 125I-albumin uptake in the dynamin-2 mutant expressing endothelial cell lines as described previously (13John T.A. Vogel S.M. Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. Minshall R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: L187-L196Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). 125I-Albumin uptake was reduced by 70-80% in the cells expressing Y231F/Y597F and K44A dynamin-2 mutants compared with empty vector-transfected or WT dynamin-2-expressing cells. 125I-Albumin uptake by cells expressing Y231F dynamin-2 was not different from cells transfected with empty vector (data not shown). We determined whether the non-Src-phosphorylatable dynamin-2 mutants interfere with caveolae-mediated uptake of Alexa 488-CTB. As shown in Fig. 6B, the effect of dynamin-2 mutant expression on CTB uptake was similar to that observed using fluorescent albumin as the tracer. Expression of Y597F and the Y231F/Y597F double mutant reduced CTB uptake by 65%, whereas in Y231F dynamin-2-expressing cells, CTB up-take was not different from empty vector-transfected cells. In the K44A-expressing cells, CTB uptake was reduced by 75% compared with empty vector-transfected cells (Fig. 6B). In cells overexpressing wild-type dynamin-2, we observed a 23% increase in CTB uptake relative to empty vector-transfected cells. We next determined the role of tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin-2 in the regulation of transendothelial albumin permeability by measuring the luminal-to-abluminal transport of 125I-albumin in RLMVEC monolayers stably expressing the dynamin-2 mutants. All of the cell monolayers were grown to confluence in Transwell chambers. Transendothelial 125I-albumin permeability was determined from tracer accumulation in the lower chamber. In cells expressing the Y597F, Y231F/Y597F, or K44A dynamin-2 mutants, transendothelial 125I-albumin permeability decreased 30% compared with cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 6C). The Y231F dynamin-2 mutant showed no effect compared with empty vector, whereas the overexpression of WT dynamin-2 significantly increased the transport of albumin. The decrease in both albumin endocytosis and transcytosis observed in the Y597F dynamin-2 mutant-expressing cells paralleled the inhibition of caveolin-dynamin co-immunoprecipitation observed in the Y597F mutant-expressing cells (Fig. 4, B and C, versus Fig. 6, B and C). The GTPase dynamin is a key regulator of vesicle fission from the plasma membrane in multiple cell types (18Oh P. McIntosh D. Schnitzer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 19Henley J. Cao H. McNiven M.A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: S243-S247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (3073) Google Scholar). Dynamin functions by binding to the neck region of vesicles, forming a collar, and by its “pinchase” activity releasing the vesicle from the membrane (27Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Expression of the dominant-negative dynamin-1 lacking the GTPase activity in endothelial cells inhibited endocytosis (17Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. McIntosh D. Science. 1996; 274: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). As caveolae are the vesicle carriers mediating albumin transcytosis in endothelial cells (5Predescu S.A. Predescu D.N. Palade G.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H937-H949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Minshall R.D. Tiruppathi C. Vogel S.M. Niles W. Gilchrist A. Hamm H. Malik A.B. J.

Physiol. 2003; 284: L187-L196Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), the mechanisms mediating the release of caveolae from the plasma membrane are key to understanding the basis of transcytosis. The upstream signals regulating activation of dynamin-2 (the predominant endothelial isoform) (28Cook T.A. Urrutia R. McNiven M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), 2A. N. Shajahan and R. D. Minshall, unpublished observation. its membrane localization, and role in the scission of caveolae remain unclear. c-Src-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin regulates the endocytosis of β-adrenergic and epidermal growth factor receptors via clathrin-coated vesicles (25Ahn S. Maudsley S. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1185-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 26Ahn S. Kim J. Lucaveche C. Reedy M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26642-26651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In these studies, Src phosphorylation at Tyr231 and Tyr597 induced dynamin self-assembly and its GTPase activity (26Ahn S. Kim J. Lucaveche C. Reedy M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26642-26651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, in this study, we addressed the role of Src kinase in the activation of dynamin-2 and its role in the mechanism of caveolae-mediated endocytosis and albumin transport. We assessed the mechanism of albumin endocytosis via caveolae in response to activation of the albumin-binding protein, gp60 (6Minshall R.D. Tiruppathi C. Vogel S.M. Niles W. Gilchrist A. Hamm H. Malik A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1057-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 11Tiruppathi C. Song W. Bergenfeldt M. Sass P. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25968-25975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 13John T.A. Vogel S.M. Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. Minshall R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: L187-L196Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Gp60 activation induced both Src phosphorylation and Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin-2 within 1 min, consistent with the rapid induction of caveolae-mediated endocytosis of albumin (13John T.A. Vogel S.M. Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. Minshall R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: L187-L196Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation step was required for the uptake of albumin and CTB, a marker of caveolae-mediated endocytosis (29Gilbert A. Paccaud J.P. Foti M. Porcheron G. Balz J. Carpentier J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1101-1110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that the internalized albumin co-localized with CTB and that the uptake of both was blocked by the caveolae-disrupting agent methyl-β-cyclodextrin (13John T.A. Vogel S.M. Tiruppathi C. Malik A.B. Minshall R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: L187-L196Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that Src phosphorylation of dynamin-2 in endothelial cells signaled caveolae internalization and endocytosis of albumin. Epidermal growth factor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin in B82L fibroblasts also occurred via a Src inhibitor-sensitive signaling pathway regulating the internalization of epidermal growth factor receptors (30Kim Y.-N. Bertics P. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1726-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, Src and dynamin formed a complex in PC12 cells and regulated membrane trafficking (31Foster-Barber A. Bishop J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4673-4677Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These findings are in accord with our observation demonstrating the important signaling function of Src in activating dynamin-2. Because Src-induced dynamin-2 phosphorylation was necessary for caveolae release, we next addressed the possibility that Src mediated this effect by regulating the association of dynamin-2 with caveolin-1. We observed that the Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin-2 following the activation of gp60 promoted the association of dynamin-2 with caveolin-1. It is possible that the association between caveolin-1 and dynamin-2, however, is not the result of a direct interaction per se but rather they are part of a multi-protein complex (20Predescu S.A. Predescu D.N. Palade G.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1019-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) in which additional factors are required for their interaction. Recently, Predescu et al. (32Predescu S.A. Predescu D.N. Timblin B.K. Stan R.V. Malik A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4997-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) showed that the adaptor protein intersectin, which interacts with dynamin, was important in regulating the fission and internalization of caveolae, suggesting that multiple proteins can interact to localize dynamin to caveolae and thus promote caveolae fission. To determine the functional role of Src-induced association of dynamin-2 with caveolin-1 in mediating membrane trafficking in endothelial cells, we assessed whether the dynamin-caveolin association was required for caveolae internalization and transendothelial albumin permeability. We generated retroviral vector FLAG epitope-tagged rat dynamin-2 mutants: Y231F, Y597F, and the double mutant Y231F/Y597F. These residues were chosen because Tyr231 and Tyr597 are phosphorylated by Src in dynamin-1 (25Ahn S. Maudsley S. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1185-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 26Ahn S. Kim J. Lucaveche C. Reedy M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26642-26651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Src phosphorylates Tyr231 in the GTPase domain and Tyr597 in the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, and both regulate GTPase function and self-assembly of dynamin in vitro (26Ahn S. Kim J. Lucaveche C. Reedy M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26642-26651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Expression of these mutants in endothelial cells resulted in significant reductions in the association of dynamin-2 and caveolin-1 as well as caveolae-mediated endocytosis. The amount of caveolin-1 immunoprecipitated by Y231F or Y597F dynamin-2 mutant following gp60 activation was 60-65% less than wild-type dynamin-2, indicating the importance of Src activation in the mechanism of the dynamin-caveolin-1 association. In contrast, caveolin-1 co-immunoprecipitated by the K44A dynamin-2 mutant was similar to wild-type dynamin-2, indicating that the dynamin-2 GTPase activity is not a requirement for the caveolin-1 association with dynamin-2. We observed markedly less caveolae-mediated uptake of 125I-albumin tracer and CTB in the endothelial cells stably expressing Y597F or Y231F/Y597F dynamin-2 compared with control cells. The albumin and CTB uptake in cells expressing the Y231F dynamin mutant were not reduced relative to control cells, whereas the Y231F dynamin-2 mutant expression showed decreased association with caveolin-1, similar to that seen with Y597F dynamin-2. Thus, it is possible that the Src-regulated association of dynamin-2 with caveolin-1 is dependent on the phosphorylation of both Tyr231 and Tyr597, whereas Tyr597 alone is important for caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Because previous in vitro studies showed that the phosphorylation of Tyr597 regulated GTPase activity of dynamin (26Ahn S. Kim J. Lucaveche C. Reedy M. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26642-26651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), it is also possible that impairment in dynamin GTPase activity in the Y597F dynamin-2 mutant-expressing cells is responsible for the reduction in the uptake of albumin and CTB. As expected, the endothelial cells expressing K44A dynamin-2 (GTPase-defective mutant) also showed reduced uptake of albumin and CTB, consistent with the requirement of GTPase activity in the mechanism of caveolae fission (17Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. McIntosh D. Science. 1996; 274: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Dynamin functions by localizing at the neck of caveolae such that the activation of its GTPase activity leads to vesicle fission (18Oh P. McIntosh D. Schnitzer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Our data show that Src-mediated phosphorylation of dynamin-2 is probably a key signal in directing dynamin to the membrane since dynamin-2 translocated to caveolin-1-rich membrane fractions after gp60 activation. In contrast, the Y231F/Y597F dynamin-2 mutant remained in the cytosol. We observed by confocal imaging that dynamin-2, but not the Y231F/Y597F dynamin-2 mutant, co-localized with caveolin-1 in punctate vesicle-like structures at the membrane after gp60 activation. To address the functional significance of Src-regulated association of dynamin-2 with caveolin-1 on endothelial barrier function, we determined the effects of Src phosphorylation of dynamin-2 on transendothelial albumin permeability. Permeability of 125I-albumin in Y597F and K44A dynamin-2-expressing cells was significantly reduced compared with control cells. Because the Src phosphorylation-defective dynamin-2 mutant interfered with caveolae-mediated endocytosis as shown above, the reduction in permeability is evidence that Src phosphorylation of dynamin-2 at Tyr597 is a critical determinant of albumin transcytosis. The mechanism by which Src phosphorylation of dynamin-2 signals the internalization of caveolae is unclear. Dynamin Tyr597 is located in the PH domain that is involved in protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions (33Lemmon M. Ferguson K. Biochem. J. 2000; 273: 27725-27733Google Scholar). Studies showed that the dynamin PH domain is required for activation of endocytosis by clathrin-coated vesicles (34Artalejo C. Lemmon M. Schlessinger J. Palfrey H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1565-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 35Achiriloaie M. Barylko B. Albanesi J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1410-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Thus, a possible mechanism of caveolae internalization as regulated by Src phosphorylation of Tyr597 may involve the binding of the βγ dimer of heterotrimeric G proteins to the PH domain (36Pitcher J. Touhara K. Payne E. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 1270: 11707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 37Scaife R. Margolis R. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Gβγ binding was reported to regulate dynamin GTPase activity (38Lin H.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Duncan J. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5057-5060Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), lending support to Src phosphorylation of Tyr597 of dynamin-2 as being the crucial signal required for caveolae-mediated endocytosis. In summary, we have demonstrated a novel role for Src kinase in signaling caveolae-mediated endocytosis of albumin in endothelial cells. Caveolin-1 is a scaffolding protein for Src kinase and other components of the endocytic machinery (22Li S. Seitz R. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3863-3868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). We showed that activation of albumin-binding protein gp60 induced Src activation, which in turn phosphorylated caveolin-1 (11Tiruppathi C. Song W. Bergenfeldt M. Sass P. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25968-25975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) as well as dynamin-2. Phosphorylation of dynamin-2 at Tyr597 promoted its translocation to the plasma membrane where it associated with caveolin-1. Thus, the Src phosphorylation of dynamin-2 on Tyr597 is a critical step mediating the activation of caveolae-mediated endocytosis and transendothelial albumin permeability. We thank Angela M.

https://openalex.org/W2039034479,"Several lines of evidence suggest that tumor-derived trypsin contributes to the growth and invasion of cancer cells. We have recently shown that trypsin is a potent growth factor for colon cancer cells through activation of the G protein-coupled receptor protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2). Here, we analyzed the signaling pathways downstream of PAR2 activation that lead to colon cancer cell proliferation in HT-29 cells. Our data are consistent with the following cascade of events upon activation of PAR2 by the serine protease trypsin or the specific PAR2-activating peptide (AP2): (i) a matrix metalloproteinase-dependent release of transforming growth factor (TGF)-α, as demonstrated with TGF-α-blocking antibodies and measurement of TGF-α in culture medium; (ii) TGF-α-mediated activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) and subsequent EGF-R phosphorylation; and (iii) activation of ERK1/2 and subsequent cell proliferation. The links between these events are demonstrated by the fact that stimulation of cell proliferation and ERK1/2 upon activation of PAR2 is reversed by the metalloproteinase inhibitor batimastat, TGF-α-neutralizing antibodies, EGF-R ligand binding domain-blocking antibodies, and the EGF-R tyrosine kinase inhibitors AG1478 and PD168393. Therefore, transactivation of EGF-R appears to be a major mechanism whereby activation of PAR2 results in colon cancer cell growth. By using the Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2, we further showed that Src plays a permissive role for PAR2-mediated ERK1/2 activation and cell proliferation, probably acting downstream of the EGF-R. These data explain how trypsin exerts robust trophic action on colon cancer cells and underline the critical role of EGF-R transactivation.

Proteases have been increasingly recognized as important factors in pathophysiology of tumor diseases. Besides their contribution to cancer progression by the degradation of extracellular matrix proteins, there is now substantial evidence that certain proteases serve as signal molecules controlling cell functions through specific membrane receptors, the proteaseactivated receptors. PARs 1The abbreviations used are: PAR, protease-activated receptor; AP, activating peptide; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGF-R, epidermal growth factor receptor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; TGF, transforming growth factor. are seven transmembrane-spanning domain G protein-coupled receptors comprising four receptors named PAR1, PAR2, PAR3, and PAR4 (1Dery O.

Rev. 2001; 53: 245-282PubMed Google Scholar). Thrombin is the physiological activator of PAR1, PAR3, and PAR4, whereas PAR2 is activated by multiple trypsin-like enzymes including trypsin and mast cell tryptase but not thrombin. The mechanism of activation of PARs was initially established for PAR1 (3Vu T.K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2675) Google Scholar) and seems to be a paradigm for the other PARs (1Dery O. Corvera C.U. Steinhoff M. Bunnett N.W. Am. J.

They are irreversibly activated by a proteolytic mechanism in which the protease binds to and cleaves the amino-terminal exodomain of the receptor. This cleavage generates a new amino-terminal sequence that binds intramolecularly to the core receptor and serves as a tethered ligand. Synthetic activating peptides that mimic the tethered ligand domains of PAR1, PAR2, and PAR4 have been developed. The activation of PARs by these synthetic peptides APs is independent of receptor proteolysis (1Dery O. Corvera C.U. Steinhoff M. Bunnett N.W. Am. J.

The importance of trypsin, a major serine protease, has been evidenced more recently in many cancers, including digestive tract tumors. Extra-pancreatic production of trypsin was shown in ovarian (5Hirahara F. Miyagi Y. Miyagi E. Yasumitsu H. Koshikawa N. Nagashima Y. Kitamura H. Minaguchi H. Umeda M. Miyazaki K. Int. J.

In addition, overexpression of exogenous trypsinogen cDNA in human gastric cancer cells increases their tumorigenicity in nude mice (7Miyata S. Miyagi Y. Koshikawa N. Nagashima Y. Kato Y.

Recently, it has been shown that down-regulation of trypsin (11Lukkonen A. Sorsa T. Salo T. Tervahartiala T. Koivunen E. Golub L. Simon S. Stenman U.H. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 86: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or serine protease inhibitors suppresses carcinogenesis in many different in vivo and in vitro assay systems (12Kennedy A.R.

We have demonstrated that trypsin acting at PAR2 is a very robust growth factor for human colon cancer cells (14Darmoul D. Marie J.C. Devaud H. Gratio V. Laburthe M. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 85: 772-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These data support the idea that some serine proteases should now be considered as crucial contributors to the development of human colon cancer. However, the cellular pathways that transmit the proliferative signal induced by activation of PAR2 to the nucleus of colon cancer cells have not yet been elucidated. In this context, the purpose of the present study was to explore the signaling pathways downstream of PAR2 that lead to colon cancer cell proliferation. By using the human colon cancer cell line HT-29 as a model (14Darmoul D. Marie J.C. Devaud H. Gratio V. Laburthe M. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 85: 772-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 15Darmoul D. Gratio V. Devaud H. Lehy T. Laburthe M. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 162: 1503-1513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), we showed that activation of PAR2 by its physiological activator, trypsin, or by the synthetic activating peptide AP2 results in a series of events that includes MMP-dependent release of TGF-α, transactivation of the EGF receptor, and subsequent activation of ERK1/2. These data represent a breakthrough in the understanding of the role of PAR2 in controlling cell proliferation in colon cancer. They also highlight the role of the EGF receptor as a pivotal downstream integrator in the control of colon cancer cell proliferation by proteinase-activated receptors. Reagents—Reagents were obtained from the following sources: activating peptides AP2 and SLIGKV, Neosystem (Strasbourg, France); trypsin (16,000 units/mg), Sigma; the MEK inhibitor PD98059, the EGF-R tyrosine kinase-specific inhibitors tyrphostin AG1478 and PD168393, and the Src inhibitor PP2, Calbiochem; batimastat (BB94), British Biotech (Oxford, UK); and protein G-Sepharose beads, Amersham Biosciences. All other chemicals were from Interchim (Asnière, France). Antibodies were purchased from the following vendors: phospho-specific antibodies to ERK1/2, New England Biolabs; polyclonal anti-ERK1/2 antibodies, Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); rabbit anti-EGF-R used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting of EGF-R, NeoMarkers (Fremont, CA); monoclonal neutralizing anti-EGF-R and monoclonal anti-phospho-tyrosine (4G10), Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY); and monoclonal neutralizing anti-TGF-α, Oncogene (Boston, MA). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit for TGF-α measurement was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Cell Culture—HT-29 cells were routinely cultured in 25-cm2 plastic flasks (Costar, Cambridge, MA) and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, air in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal calf serum as described previously (15Darmoul D. Gratio V. Devaud H. Lehy T. Laburthe M. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 162: 1503-1513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Cell Proliferation Assay—Determination of cellular proliferation was accomplished by direct cell count. 5,000 cells/well were seeded in 96-cluster wells (Costar) in the appropriate medium and allowed to attach for 3 days. They were starved in serum-free medium for 48 h. Then, 200 μl of a fresh serum-free medium, with or without PAR2 agonists (1 nm trypsin or 100 μm AP2) or EGF (6 nm), were added every other day for 4 days. In some experiments, HT-29 cells were preincubated for 60 min with 3 μm AG1478, 2 μm PD168393, or 5 μm PP2, for 30 min with 5 μm batimastat, or for 2 h with the blocking antibodies for EGF-R or TGF-α before cell stimulation with the different PAR activators. After 96 h of culture, cells were detached from triplicate wells by trypsin/EDTA and counted in a hemacytometer. Cell death was evaluated with trypan blue, and the staining of cells treated with the indicated inhibitors revealed 99.9% viability, suggesting that these concentrations are not toxic to HT-29 cells. MAPK Western Blots—For ERK1/2 phosphorylation, cells were grown in 6-cluster wells (Costar) at 50% confluence and serum-deprived for 48 h before their activation with 10 nm trypsin or 100 μm AP2 for 5 min. In some experiments, before stimulation with the PAR2 ligands, cells were treated with PD98059 (25 μm), AG1478 (3 μm), or PP2 (10 μm) for 1 h or with blocking antibodies for 2 h. Cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (v/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% (v/v) SDS) containing protease inhibitor mixture and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate for 30 min at 4 °C, and lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. Equal amounts of extracts (50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane that was incubated first with Tris-buffered saline buffer (20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl) containing 5% (w/v) low-fat milk and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and then with phospho-specific antibodies to ERK1/2 diluted 1:2,000 overnight at 4 °C that react with the activated, dual threonine- and tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of p42/p44 MAPK. Then, blots were washed and incubated with the anti-IgG-peroxidase-linked secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature before detection using chemiluminescence detection kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposure to x-ray films. The same membrane was reprobed with a polyclonal anti-ERK1/2 antibody (diluted 1:1,000) that recognizes ERK1/2 regardless of its phosphorylation status and served as loading control. EGF-R Immunoprecipitation Assay and Western Blot—HT-29 cells were grown in 100-mm dishes at 50% confluence and serum-starved for 48 h. Cells were then treated with PAR2 agonists (10 nm trypsin or 100 μm AP2) for 5 min at 37 °C before being washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 45 min on ice in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.25% (v/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were cleared by spinning at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. EGF-Rs were precipitated overnight at 4 °C from lysates with a polyclonal anti-EGF-R antibody coupled to protein G-Sepharose beads. The precipitates were separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. Phosphorylated EGF-Rs were detected by Western blot with the anti-phospho-tyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10. The total quantities of EGF-R were detected by Western blot with a polyclonal antibody against EGF-R. In some experiments, before stimulation with the ligands, cells were pretreated with AG1478 (3 μm) or PP2 (10 μm) for 1 h and then stimulated with PAR2 agonists or EGF for 5 min. TGF-α Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—HT-29 cells were seeded at 5,000 cells/well in 96-cluster wells (Costar) and allowed to attach for 3 days. They were starved in serum-free medium for 48 h. To prevent the binding of released TGF-α to EGF-R, we pretreated cells with the anti-EGF-R binding domain antibody (10 μg/ml) for 2 h before cell stimulation with PAR2 agonists. It was hypothesized (16McCole D.F. Keely S.J. Coffey R.J. Barrett K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42603-42612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) that this pretreatment increases the measurement of TGF-α in cell culture supernatants. Cells were counted, and the conditioned medium of different conditions was collected for measurement of TGF-α. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for TGF-α was performed using a commercially available kit (R&D Systems), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical Analysis—All results are expressed as means ± S.E. for a series of experiments. Differences between data were tested by Student's t tests for unpaired data. A p of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Trypsin Stimulates Cell Proliferation in HT-29 Cells via ERK Phosphorylation Pathway—In previous studies, we showed that trypsin acts as a growth factor for colon cancer cells through the activation of PAR2 (14Darmoul D. Marie J.C. Devaud H. Gratio V. Laburthe M. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 85: 772-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Because ERKs play a pivotal role in the pathway leading to growth factor-regulated proliferation, we investigated the involvement of ERKs upon activation of PAR2. As shown in Fig. 1A, pretreatment of HT-29 cells with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 resulted in an 80% decrease of cell proliferation induced by activation of PAR2 (1 nm trypsin or 100 μm AP2). Cell counts from control cells treated with PD98059 alone were comparable with those of diluent-treated cells. Further experiments showed that activation of PAR2 with trypsin or AP2 induced a significant phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 1B). In the presence of the MEK inhibitor PD98059, ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by PAR2 agonists was completely inhibited (Fig. 1B). These results clearly show that PAR2 agonists signal as growth factors for HT-29 cells through the MAPK pathway. Activation of ERKs and Cell Proliferation Induced by PAR2 Agonists Are Attenuated by EGF-R Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors—We next determined whether PAR2-mediated ERK activation is dependent on EGF-R kinase activity. As shown in Fig. 2, the EGF-R kinase inhibitor tyrphostin AG1478 (3 μm) abrogated the effects of PAR2 agonists on ERK phosphorylation in HT-29 cells. EGF was used as a positive control to show the specificity of the inhibitor (Fig. 2). To ascertain the role of EGF-R kinase in the mitogenic pathway induced by PAR2, we inhibited EGF-R kinase activity with specific inhibitors and measured cell proliferation. As shown in Fig. 3A, AG1478 (3 μm) significantly reduced PAR2-mediated cell proliferation. Because inhibition with AG1478 was only partial, we used another inhibitor of EGF-R tyrosine kinase that was shown to be irreversible and more selective, i.e. PD168393 (17Fry D.W. Bridges A.J. Denny W.A. Doherty A. Greis K.D. Hicks J.L. Hook K.E. Keller P.R. Leopold W.R. Loo J.A. McNamara D.J. Nelson J.M. Sherwood V. Smaill J.B. Trumpp-Kallmeyer S. Dobrusin E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12022-12027Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, this inhibitor completely abolished PAR2-mediated cell proliferation. These data support the involvement of EGF-R tyrosine kinase activity in ERK activation and the subsequent proliferative responses induced by activation of PAR2.Fig. 3Effect of the EGF-R tyrosine kinase inhibitors AG1478 or PD168393 on PAR2 agonist-induced HT-29 cell proliferation. Cells grown in serum-free medium were treated for 60 min with vehicle, AG1478 (3 μm), or PD168393 (2 μm), and then PAR2 agonists or EGF was added to the medium. In A, cells were stimulated without or with trypsin (1 nm), AP2 (100 μm), or EGF (6 nm) in the presence or absence of AG1478. In B, cells were stimulated without or with trypsin (1 nm), AP2 (100 μm), or EGF (6 nm) in the presence or absence of PD168393. After 96 h, cells from triplicate wells were counted for each condition. Data are means ± S.E. Asterisks represent a significant reduction by inhibitors in EGF-, trypsin- or AP2-stimulated cell proliferation. ***, p < 0.0001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Activation of PAR2 Promotes EGF-R Phosphorylation—Because PAR2-mediated activation of ERK and cell proliferation could be influenced by inhibitors of the EGF-R tyrosine kinase, we sought to identify whether activation of PAR2 results in EGF-R tyrosine phosphorylation. HT-29 cells were treated with trypsin, AP2, or EGF for 5 min, and the cells were then lysed and assayed for tyrosine-specific phosphorylation of the EGF-R. The EGF-R in HT-29 cells became highly phosphorylated in response to EGF stimulation, whereas PAR2 agonist treatment resulted in moderate EGF-R tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, we showed that inhibition of EGF-R tyrosine kinase activity by AG1478 abolished PAR2-dependent phosphorylation of the EGF-R in HT-29 cells (Fig. 4B). As a control, we checked that AG1478 also completely inhibited EGF-dependent phosphorylation of the EGF-R. It is concluded that activation of PAR2 leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF-R. Blockade of the EGF-R Ligand Binding Domain Inhibits PAR2-mediated Effects on Cell Proliferation and ERK1/2 Phosphorylation—To determine the mechanism by which EGF-R is activated after the challenge of HT-29 cells with PAR2 agonists, we designed experiments to block the binding of EGF-R ligands to the extracellular domain of the EGF-R. We used a monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular portion of the EGF-R. To avoid the bias of the proteolytic activity of the enzyme on the EGF-R antibodies, we performed these experiments only with PAR2-activating peptide AP2, and not with trypsin. As shown in Fig. 5A, preincubation of HT-29 cells with the EGF-R blocking antibody significantly reduced AP2-induced HT-29 cell proliferation. In agreement with these data, pretreatment of the cells with this antibody also inhibited AP2-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). To test the efficiency of the antibody, we showed that anti-EGF-R also inhibited EGF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and cell proliferation (Fig. 5). These results provide strong evidence that PAR2-induced cell proliferation and signal transduction involve the binding of an EGF-R ligand to the EGF-R. A Neutralizing Antibody for TGF-α Blocked PAR2-induced Cell Proliferation—The above-described data showed that inhibition of EGF-R phosphorylation and blockade of the EGF-R ligand binding domain inhibit PAR2-induced ERK1/2 activation and subsequent cell proliferation. We next investigated whether EGF-R transactivation upon activation of PARs is mediated by release of TGF-α, the most abundant member of the EGF-R family ligands found in normal colon and colon carcinomas (18Barnard J.A. Beauchamp R.D. Russell W.E. Dubois R.N. Coffey R.J. Gastroenterology. 1995; 108: 564-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). We first analyzed the involvement of TGF-α by blocking its biological activity with neutralizing antibodies. As shown in Fig. 6A, treatment of HT-29 cells with TGF-α-neutralizing antibodies strongly inhibited AP2-induced cell proliferation. The TGF-α antibodies also had a small effect on control cells, suggesting that small amounts of TGF-α are constitutively secreted in the absence of PAR2 agonists. We tried to measure TGF-α under conditions in which TGF-α binding to the EGF-R was prevented by preincubating cells with EGF-R binding site antibodies (19Johnson G.R. Kannan B. Shoyab M. Stromberg K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2924-2931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Results showed that AP2 significantly enhanced TGF-α release as compared with control cells (Fig. 6B). These findings suggest that PAR2 transactivates the EGF-R by causing the extracellular release of TGF-α. PAR2-mediated ERK1/2 Phosphorylation and Cell Proliferation Involve MMPs—A mechanism whereby the TGF-α ligand is released is thought to be the shedding of membrane-bound precursor by metalloproteinases (20Blobel C.P. Inflamm. Res. 2002; 51: 83-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the effect of the general metalloproteinase inhibitor batimastat in our model. As shown in Fig. 7, batimastat abrogated cell proliferation induced by either synthetic agonists of PAR2 (AP2) or by the serine protease trypsin. In contrast, batimastat had no effect on exogenous EGF- or TGF-α-induced cell proliferation (Fig. 7A). Batimastat was also tested on ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by PAR2 agonists (Fig. 7B). The MMP inhibitor dramatically decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation caused by PAR2 activators (trypsin or AP2). As expected, batimastat had no effect on EGF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 7B). These studies suggest that EGF-R transactivation induced by PAR agonists involves MMP-mediated EGF-R ligand cleavage and correlates with our previous experiments that showed a reduction in AP2-induced cell number in the presence the TGF-α-blocking antibody. Effect of Src Inhibitor on PAR Agonist-induced EGF-R Phosphorylation, ERK1/2 Activation, and Subsequent Cell Proliferation—In addition to EGF-R activation, non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as Src can be activated after stimulation of GPCRs (21Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lansing T.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19443-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). To examine the involvement of Src in PAR2-mediated responses in HT-29 cells, we utilized the Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2. As shown in Fig. 8, pretreatment of HT-29 cells with 10 μm PP2 did not significantly reduce PAR2 agonist-induced EGF-R phosphorylation (Fig. 8A). However, Src inhibition with PP2 significantly blocked ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by PAR2 agonists in HT-29 cells (Fig. 8B). In concordance with the MAPK effect, HT-29 cell proliferation induced by either the synthetic agonist of PAR2 (AP2) or trypsin was dramatically decreased in the presence of 5 μm PP2 (Fig. 8C). In contrast, PP2 had only a slight effect, if any, on exogenous EGF-induced EGF-R phosphorylation, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and cell proliferation (Fig. 8). Taken together, these results suggest that PAR2 mediates ERK phosphorylation and cell proliferation by an EGF-R-dependent and Src kinase-dependent pathway. We recently showed that trypsin, acting at protease-activated receptor PAR2, is a potent growth factor for human colon cancer cells (14Darmoul D. Marie J.C. Devaud H. Gratio V. Laburthe M. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 85: 772-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In the present study, we expand upon these findings to elucidate the mechanism(s) whereby PAR2 control colon cancer cell proliferation. We found that PAR2 agonists transactivate the EGF-R through a pathway that includes matrix metalloproteinase-dependent cleavage and release of TGF-α, which in turn activates the EGF-R and downstream MAPK cascade, leading to cell proliferation. The different steps of the pathway leading to cell proliferation after activation of PARs have been analyzed using pharmacological enzyme inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies. Evidence supports the involvement of ERK1/2 in PAR-mediated cell proliferation: (i) the MEK inhibitor PD98059 abrogated cell proliferation stimulated by PAR2 agonists; and (ii) activation of PAR2 resulted in ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Whereas the relationship between ERK activation and cell proliferation is well documented (22Schramek H. News Physiol. Sci. 2002; 17: 62-67PubMed Google Scholar), the mechanism by which PAR2 activates MAPKs (ERK1/2) was not known. The important finding of our study was to show that transactivation of EGF-R is an essential link between PAR2 activation and colon cancer cell proliferation. Indeed, blockade of EGF-R tyrosine kinase activity by AG1478 or PD168393 and blockade of the EGF-R binding domain by a specific antibody resulted in robust inhibition of both ERK1/2 phosphorylation and cell proliferation. This transactivation of the EGF-R by PAR2 agonists has never been reported before in any cell system. Whether this mechanism can be extended to other cancers such as gastric carcinoma (23Miyata S.

In the present study, the fact that EGF-R tyrosine kinase inhibition and the blockade of the extracellular ligand binding domain of the EGF-R result in similar abolition of PAR2-mediated HT-29 cell proliferation suggests that the binding of an extracellular ligand comes into play upon PAR2 activation. Our data show that TGF-α is such as an extracellular EGF-R ligand. Indeed, incubating HT-29 cells with TGF-α-neutralizing antibodies blocks PAR2 agonist-induced cell proliferation. Moreover, we could measure the increase of TGF-α concentration in the culture medium of PAR2 agonist-stimulated HT-29 cells. Amphiregulin, another EGF-R ligand, has been shown to also be expressed in colon cancer (28Saeki T. Stromberg K. Qi C.F. Gullick W.J. Tahara E. Normanno N. Ciardiello F. Kenney N. Johnson G.R.

We report here that tweety, a gene located in Drosophila flightless, has a structure similar to those of known channels and that human homologues of tweety (hTTYH1–3) are novel maxi-Cl- channels. hTTYH3 mRNA was found to be distributed in excitable tissues.

Chloride (Cl-) anion passes through the cell membrane in greatest abundance mainly by channels. Cl- channels play roles in the stabilization of membrane potential, transport, and cell volume regulation. Cl- channels are observed in many tissues and are thus variably regulated by voltage, calcium, pH, or cell volume. There are three types of Cl- channels based on their conductance: small (<10 pS), 1The abbreviations used are: pS, picosiemens; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; FITC, fluorescent isothiocyanate; SITS, 4-acetamido-4′-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanato-stilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; HEK, human embryonal kidney; TMSs, transmembrane segments; TEA, tetraethylammonium; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; RT, reverse transcriptase; CaC, Ca2+-activated Cl-; m, mouse; h, human; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 1The abbreviations used are: pS, picosiemens; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; FITC, fluorescent isothiocyanate; SITS, 4-acetamido-4′-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanato-stilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; HEK, human embryonal kidney; TMSs, transmembrane segments; TEA, tetraethylammonium; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; RT, reverse transcriptase; CaC, Ca2+-activated Cl-; m, mouse; h, human; GFP, green fluorescent protein. medium (10–100 pS), and large (100 >pS, maxi-Cl-) conductance channels. Small and medium conductance channels are found ubiquitously, even in oocytes, whereas large conductance channels are rarely found. To our knowledge, less than 12 cells possessing maxi-Cl- channels have been found over the past 40 years. A maxi-Cl- channel in muscle or in other tissues is activated directly by cytosolic Ca2+ (1Thorn P. Martin R.J. Q. J. Exp. Physiol. 1987; 72: 31-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 2Fahmi M. Garcia L. Taupignon A. Dufy B. Sartor P. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E969-E976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas activity of the channel in other tissues is independent of Ca2+ (3Nilius B. Droogmans G. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1415-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 4Kemp P.J. MacGregor G.G. Olver R.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: L323-L329PubMed Google Scholar). GTP-binding protein (5Sun X.P. Supplisson S. Torres R. Sachs G. Mayer E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 448: 355-382Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar), cell volume (3Nilius B. Droogmans G. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1415-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), and protein kinases (6Groschner K. Kukovetz W.R. Pfluegers Arch. 1992; 421: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have been reported to modify the function of a maxi-Cl- channel. However, because of their rarity, the physiological role of maxi-Cl- channels remains obscure. The molecular structures of Cl- channels are diverse, with different transmembrane segments (TMSs) such as cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (7Schwiebert E.M. Benos D.J. Egan M.E. Stutts M.J. Guggino W.B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S145-S166Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) and ClC (8Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weuinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar) with 10 or 12 TMSs. Aquaporin-6 encodes a unique acid-dependent Cl- channel with 6 TMSs (9Yasui M. Hazama A. Kwon T.H. Nielsen S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Nature. 1999; 402: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The ClCA family, with 5 TMSs, encodes medium conductance Ca2+-activated Cl- (CaC) channels (10Gandhi R. Elble R.C. Gruber A.D. Ji H.L. Copeland S.M. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32096-32101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 11Gruber A.D. Elble R.C. Ji H.L. Schreur K.D. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Genomics. 1998; 54: 200-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that there exists a Cl- channel with more variable TMSs. On the other hand, cDNA encoding ion channels is generally expressed in ovary cells, such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and Xenopus oocytes. They possess Cl- channels endogenously. CaC currents are frequently observed as endogenous currents of these cells. The CaC current is driven by small or medium conductance Cl- channels activated by a high concentration of intracellular Ca2+, is outwardly rectifying, and is inhibited by 4,4′-diisothiocyanato-stilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS) and niflumate (3Nilius B. Droogmans G. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1415-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Human embryonal kidney (HEK) cells have also been used for the expression of cDNA encoding CaC (10Gandhi R. Elble R.C. Gruber A.D. Ji H.L. Copeland S.M. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32096-32101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), but they possess endogenous maxi-Cl- channels regardless of the concentration of Ca2+ (12Zhu G. Zhang Y. Xu H. Jiang C. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1998; 81: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To try to find a novel ion channel, we used the BLAST program to search for proteins that have four or more TMSs as predicted by hydrophobicity and a gene related to behavior abnormality. By using a cluster of leucine residues as a transmembrane probe, we found a human gene (httyh3) that has homology to Drosophila tweety (dttyh1) located in the flightless locus (13Maleszka R. Hanes S.D. Hackett R.L. DeCouet H.G. Gabormiklos G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), which is related to behavior abnormality. flightless is a mutant of Drosophila melanogaster. The flightless gene is molecularly characterized by four transcription units within it, which are named tweety (twe), fli, dodo (dod), and penguin (pen). These genes are required for normal flight. We therefore investigated the localization and expressed currents of hTTYH3 in the present study. Isolation and Detection of hTTYH3—Human TTYH3 cDNA (AL530584) was purchased from Incyte Genomics. Mutants were made by using PCR (QuickChange, Stratagene). Northern blot analysis was performed with a membrane (human multiple tissues Northern blot, Clontech, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol using a PstI fragment as a probe. Mouse RNA was isolated by using the guanidine thiocyanate method with organic extraction (Trizol, Invitrogen). A mouse TTYH3 (mTTYH3) fragment was cloned by PCR followed by reverse transcriptase (RT) using a primer set (5′-AAGCTGTCGGGCAGCCACAA-3′ and 5′-CGATGGAGCTGAACATGAGG-3′) that detects an 84-amino acid fragment from S positions 310–394. RT-PCR detections of human, hamster (Cricetulus griseus), and mouse TTYH3 (hmcTTYH3) exons in the cell lines and tissues were performed by conventional methods. Human endothelial cells (number 375) and smooth muscle cells (number 716) were purchased from Applied Cell Biology Research Institute. Neuronal cells (PC12 and N2A) were gifts from K. Shimazaki (Department of Neurophysiology, Jichi Medical School, Japan). The mTTYH3 protein was detected in mouse tissues. Specific antibodies were raised against the C-terminal region of MRAKYLATSQ, which was common in human, hamster, and mouse clones. An antigen (1 mg/ml distilled water) conjugated with 1 ml of Freund's adjuvant was intramuscularly injected into New Zealand White rabbits, and this was followed by biweekly booster injections of the same dose of the antigen in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Serum in which the titer was over 10,000 times higher than that of the control was obtained 8 weeks later. The immunized rabbit serum was passed through a column (Amersham Biosciences) and affinity-purified by a kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Extracts of subconfluent HEK293 or CHO cells (in 60-mm dishes) with or without transfection of hTTYH3 cDNA were lysed by gentle sonication in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.05% Tween 20 (pH 8.0), and protease inhibitors. Digestion was performed with the proteins at a concentration of 20 mg/20 ml and incubated with N-glycanase (0.5 units/20 μl) for 18 h at 37 °C. Western blot analysis with a blocking test by an excess of antigen (1 μg/ml) was performed to evaluate specificity. Immune complexes were detected by horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG by using an ECL detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Histologic staining was performed by conventional methods and detected by fluorescent isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Dako, Kyoto, Japan). The tissues were viewed through a microscope (BX-5, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), and photographs were stored in a computer. Expression of cDNA—A plasmid expressing green fluorescence protein (pEGFP-N1, Clontech, Tokyo, Japan) or red fluorescence protein (pDsRed1-N1, Clontech) was used as a marker for transfection. 0.5 μg of the marker cDNA and 1 μg of hTTYH3 cDNA or its mutants were transfected into mammalian cells grown on coverslips using FuGENE6™ (Roche Applied Science). Growth and transfection were performed in 10% fetal calf serum-containing media. The cells were used without any further treatment for patch clamp samples. The experiments were performed at 48–72 h after the transfection. To make stable transformed cells, we inserted hTTYH3 cDNA into a plasmid (pIREShygr3, Clontech). The CHO cells were transfected by electroporation, and the stable transformant was cloned using the immunoreactivity as a marker. Electrophysiology—Patch clamp recordings were carried out according to conventional methods (14Suzuki M. Morita T. Hanaoka K. Kawaguchi Y. Sakai O. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 83: 735-742Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The experiments were performed at room temperature (20–25 °C). Micropipettes were made from capillary tubes (Drummond Scientific, Broomall, PA) that were coated by bees-wax before fire-polishing. They had a resistance of <10 megohms. Series resistance in a whole cell configuration was around 300 megohms. The GFP-positive cells were visualized by fluorescence measurement (CAM 2000 System, Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) with an emission of 490 nm. Currents were recorded with an EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA, Pfalz, West Germany). Applied voltage and sampling (10 kHz) were controlled by a computer system (HEKA, Pfalz, West German). Samples were filtered through 1 kHz, and analysis was performed using the software Patch Analyst Pro. The bath solution contained 140 mm NaCl (or TEA-Cl or sodium gluconate), 1.0 mm MgCl2, and 3 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). The whole cell patch pipette contained a filtered solution of 140 mm CsCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2,and 3 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) with or without 0.5 mm CaCl2. To calculate the ratio of X- to Cl- permeability in a whole cell configuration, the current-clamp mode was used to measure reversal potential. Then the reversal potential was compensated by liquid junction potential, and the ratio was calculated by using an equation (15Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992: 337-361Google Scholar). For single channel analysis, the pipette solution was changed to 140 mm NaX, 1.0 mm MgCl2, and 3 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Single channel recording was performed in inside-out patches, and then reversal potential was calculated to obtain the selective permeability. To obtain the desired Ca2+ concentration, Ca/EGTA concentration in the solution for the cytoplasmic side was adjusted with appropriate amounts of KCl, KOH, MgCl2, and HEPES, keeping a constant ionic strength (Σ ions2) of 1.5. A hypotonic solution was made by addition of distilled water to the bath solution. Osmolality was measured using an osmometer (One-Ten Osmometer, Fiske, MA). The data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance, and the significance was calculated using Bonferroni's analysis. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Isolation and Characterization of hTTYH3 Protein—The sequence of the purchased cDNA (AL530584) had significant homology to ttyh1 and ttyh2 (NM020659 and NM032646) and was named ttyh3. The gene ttyh3 is located in 7p22.3. Other family members of ttyh3 were found by using the BLAST program; one was found in Drosophila (CG3638) and two were found in Homo sapiens (ttyh1 and ttyh2). hTTYH3 mRNA encodes 4800 nucleotides and 523 amino acids. hTTYH1 is thought to have 5 TMSs (16Campbell H.D. Kamei M. Claudianos C. Woollatt E. Sutherland G.R. Suzuki Y. Hida M. Sugano S. Young I.G. Genomics. 2000; 68: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), whereas hTTYH3 is thought to possess 6 TMSs. Both were predicted by the Sosui program (GenomNet, Kyoto University) (Fig. 1A). The third TMS (TMS3) was predicted in hTTYH3 but not in hTTYH1. The cluster of leucine used for the search was found in TMS4. To determine the membrane topology, a marker (His6) was inserted between TMS3 and TMS4 (amino acids 199–209) and between TMS5 and TMS6, which were expressed in mammalian cells and then detected with an FITC-labeled antibody against His6 (data not shown). The mutants containing the marker in the given positions (amino acids 202, 205, 208, and 257, Fig. 1A, green triangles) were positive, and the other mutants (red triangles) were negative for binding when the antibody was incubated outside the cells. However, addition of His6 may change the transmembrane topology. Detection of an ttyh3 product and glycosylation scanning were performed with an antibody raised against C-terminal peptides. The amino acid sequence of the C-terminal region used for the antibody is a common sequence among hamsters, mice, and humans. Western blot analysis showed positive signal in expressed CHO cells (Fig. 1B), whereas immunoreactivity was not detected in control CHO cells. On the other hand, immunoreactivity was faintly detected by Western blotting and clearly detected by immunohistochemistry in HEK cells (Fig. 1C), suggesting that hTTYH3 is an endogenous Cl- channel. Incubation of the same membrane with an excess of antigen (1 μg/ml) abolished the signals, indicating that the antibody is specific for hTTYH3 detection. Possible glycosylation sites (Asn-Xaa-Thr/Ser, red circle) were found at the positions 128, 144, and 353. Glycosylation scanning was performed by using N-glycanase digestion. The protein of hTTYH3 expressed in CHO was incubated with N-glycanase, resulting in digestion of the upper band, but the sequence-predicted 58-kDa band remained. Thus, the upper band in CHO was a glycosylated form of hTTYH3. When threonine was substituted by alanine at the three sites, Thr at position 353 was the only site glycosylated. Thr at 353 was therefore located in an extracellular domain. Therefore, the structure of hTTYH3 is like that illustrated in Fig. 1A (lower panel), regardless of whether TMS3 (white column) penetrates the membrane or not. The putative structure of hTTYH3 may be comparable with that of the Ca2+-activated large conductance potassium channel (17Piskorowski R. Aldrich R.W. Nature. 2002; 420: 500-503Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Schreiber M. Yuan A. Salkoff L. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) (maxi-K+, Fig. 1A, lower). The pore region in maxi-K+ determines potassium ion selectivity located between TMS5 and TMS6. The position of the pore region in hTTYH3 is predicted to be similar to that of maxi-K+, where positively charged amino acids, arginine and histidine, are commonly conserved in the TTYH family. Maxi-K+ has a unique aspartate cluster below the last transmembrane domain. This negatively charged cluster is called the “Ca2+ bowl” and is related to direct activation by Ca2+ (18Schreiber M. Yuan A. Salkoff L. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A Ca2+ bowl-like sequence was recognized in the TTYH family as a glutamate- or Asp-rich domain. Knockout of the maxi-K+ channel gene resulted in a “slowpoke,” whereas that of the tweety gene resulted in a “flightless” in Drosophila; both genes are related to behavior abnormality. Localization of hTTYH and mTTYH3—hTTYH3 and mTTYH3 are distributed mainly in excitable tissues. hTTYH3 mRNA of 4.8 kb was found by Northern blotting in the brain, heart, skeletal muscle, colon, spleen, kidney, and peripheral blood leukocytes (Fig. 2A). RT-PCR using mouse tissues revealed positive signals also in fat, the pancreas, thymus, and uterus (Fig. 2B). mTTYH3 was also detected in an endothelial cell line, kidney epithelial cells (opossum kidney and HEK), and a neuronal cell line (PC12 and N2A). To confirm the absence of a hamster cTTYH3 product in CHO cells, we cloned a partial sequence of hamster cTTYH3 (AB158504), 84 amino acids, from genomic DNA of CHO cells by PCR (arrows in Fig. 1A). A comparison of the hamster sequence with those of other species showed that one and nine amino acids differed from those in mouse and human, respectively. By using species-common primers, cTTYH3 cDNA was not found in CHO by RT-PCR. Immunohistological analysis was performed on mouse tissues (Fig. 3). Thalamic neurons and ventricular cells of the heart and skeletal muscle membrane were positively stained. A negative control was obtained with an excess of antigen. In the kidney, cells in glomeruli, presumably mesangium cells, were positively stained. Although opossum kidney cells or HEK cells showed positive hmcTTYH3 signals by RT-PCR, renal proximal tubules were not positively stained. The signal may be indistinguishable because the level of autofluorescence of proximal tubules is high and/or the level of expression of mTTYH3 is low in this segment. Therefore, mTTYH3 is located mainly in excitable membranes. Whole Cell Recordings of hTTYH3-transfected CHO Cells— We first selected HEK293 cells for the expression of hTTYH3, because HEK293 cells were used for discovery of the ClCA family (10Gandhi R. Elble R.C. Gruber A.D. Ji H.L. Copeland S.M. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32096-32101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). When transiently expressed in HEK293 cells, hT-TYH3 was associated with a prominent Cl- current that was activated by ionomycin (10-6m). The current was much less marked in GFP vector (mock)-transfected cells. However, a similar large conductance Cl- single channel (12Zhu G. Zhang Y. Xu H. Jiang C. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1998; 81: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) was detected in the following investigation. Therefore, we used CHO cells. The basal current in hTTYH3-transfected CHO cells was not different from that in untransfected control cells. Although ionomycin induced an outward-rectified current in mock-transfected cells, it induced an overt linear current in hTTYH3-transfected cells (Fig. 4A). The current was not altered by substitution of sodium with TEA but was altered by substitution of Cl- with gluconate in the bath solution, suggesting that the current is a current driven by an anion. The permeability ratio of Cs+/Cl- was nominally zero and that of gluconate/Cl- was 0.33 (15Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992: 337-361Google Scholar). To investigate the ion selectivity, we used whole cell patches with a pipette solution containing 0.5 mm CaCl2, because this large amount of Ca2+ was required to stabilize the current-voltage relation. The ionic selectivity was altered in hTTYH3 pore mutants by exchanges of charged amino acids (Fig. 4B). Mutant H370D showed a different selectivity, in which gluconate/Cl- decreased from 0.3 to 0.12 and Cs+/Cl- increased to 0.1. Mutant R366Q was more permeable to cations. The reversal potential with isosmotic NaCl/CsCl shifted to 12.5 mV (mean of eight), suggesting significant permeability to Na+. Assuming that TEA and gluconate are impermeable ions, the Na+/Cs+/Cl- permeability ratio was calculated to be 0.7:0.25:1. Thus, positively charged amino acids at positions 366 and 370 composed the pore of hTTYH3, playing a role in anion selectivity. Halide selectivity of hTTYH3 was precisely measured by single channel analysis. Anions in the pipette solution were changed in each experiment, and reversal potential was measured (n = 5 in each). The resultant order of permeability (P X/Cl-) was I- (2.2), Br- (1.8), SCN- (1), NO3− (0.83), gluconate- (0.3), aspartate- (0.2), and Na+ (<0.1). Effects of Blockers on the hTTYH3 Channel—The effects of blockers were investigated next. The evoked current in non-transfected cells was blocked by niflumate, whereas the evoked current in hTTYH3-transfected cells was not inhibited by niflumate (300 μg/ml). The CaC current was not inhibited by 10 μm dithiothreitol, 10 μm ZnCl2, or 10 μm SITS but was completely inhibited by 10 μm DIDS (Fig. 4C, left). Effects of reagents on the single hTTYH3 channel in an inside-out configuration were also examined. Niflumate had no effect (Po = 0.8 to 0.82, n = 4). SITS induced a flickering opening but had no significant inhibitory effect (Po = 0.58, n = 4), whereas DIDS induced a blockade (Po = 0.12, n = 0.4, p < 0.01) within a few seconds (Fig. 4C, right). Therefore, the hTTYH3 current was only sensitive to DIDS. Single Channel Analysis of hTTYH3—hTTYH3 was characterized by single channel analysis. Maxi-Cl- channel activity was observed within 30 s after detachment of the membrane when bath solution contained 0.1 mm of Ca2+ (Fig. 5A). Such a large conductance was observed in hTTYH3-transfected cells but not in non-transfected cells. The current-voltage relation was linear in symmetrical Cl- solution (n = 12) with slope conductance of 260 pS (Fig. 5B). Open probability was not dependent on voltage of less than 0 mV but decreased at voltage over 60 mV (Fig. 5C). The distribution of current amplitudes fitted well to results of Gausian's analysis, indicating a subconductance of 50 pS (Fig. 5D). The channel had a long open lifetime as was observed in the trace at +40 mV, whereas it also had a fluctuating rapid opening as was observed in the trace at -60 mV. Long opening and rapid (but transient) fluctuations were observed in the same patch membrane. The hTTYH3 channel therefore involved a multiopening mechanism. Open-closed lifetimes fit better to two kinetic states (τo1 = 52, τo 2 = 510 ms, τc1 = 60 and τc2 = 250 ms, mean of 12) rather than 1. As in the case of a maxi-K+ channel (17Piskorowski R. Aldrich R.W. Nature. 2002; 420: 500-503Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and ClCA channel (10Gandhi R. Elble R.C. Gruber A.D. Ji H.L. Copeland S.M. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32096-32101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), a high concentration of cytosolic Ca2+ was essential for hTTYH3 activation. The open probability was plotted against Ca2+ concentration, resulting in an ED50 of about 2 μm (Fig. 5E). The range of Ca2+ concentrations is similar to that for maxi-K+ activation (18Schreiber M. Yuan A. Salkoff L. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The value 2 μm is within the physiologic range of Ca2+ in excitable cells in which hTTYH3 is detected. Thus, like the maxi-K+ channel, hTTYH3 may play a role in Ca2+ signal transduction. However, it took around 10 s for activation when the cytosolic side of the isolated membrane was exposed to high Ca2+ solution. Thus, protein phosphorylation or another complex mechanism might be involved in the activation. To search for activators, activity of hTTYH3 was observed in a cell-attached configuration with stably transformed CHO cells, and the presence of hTTYH3 channels in the attached membrane was determined later in an inside-out configuration in high Ca2+ solution. Although protein kinase sites on the amino acid sequences were predicted, direct opening of the hTTYH3 channel by protein kinase A (dibutyryl cAMP, 10-5 m) or kinase C (phorbol ester, 10-8 m) was not observed. Addition of stauro-sporine (10-6 m), GTPγS (10-5 m), or okadaic acid (10-5 m) to the bath solution did not activate the hTTYH3 channel (data not shown). Therefore, the physiological role of hTTYH3 remains obscure and awaits in vivo study. Expression and Activation of hTTYH1 and hTTYH2 Channels—To elucidate the physiological role of the TTYH family, we examined the functional expression of other members, hTTYH1 and hTTYH2. Based on the above results, we tested whether hTTYH1 and hTTYH2 were also expressed as evoked Cl- channels (Fig. 6). Activity of the hTTYH1 single channel was sometimes observed in cell-attached patches, showing slope conductance of 280 pS. However, the hTTYH2-induced channel appeared only after treatment with ionomycin. hTTYH2 was expressed as a Ca2+-dependent inward-rectified Cl- channel of 120 pS in an inward direction and of 45 pS in an outward direction. In a cell-attached configuration, reversal potential of hTTYH1 and hTTYH2 was around -30 mV, which is similar to the Cl- equilibrium potential. By substitution of NaCl with TEA-Cl in a pipette solution, the permeability ratio, PNa/PCl, was calculated to be less than 0.1 for hTTYH1 and 0.1 for hTTYH2. We next tested the influence of a hypotonic solution on hTTYH1 and hTTYH3 channels. In a whole cell configuration with CsCl in the pipette solution without Ca2+ (pCa = 7.2), the current by hTTYH1 was usually silent but remarkably activated when the bath osmolarity was changed to a hypotonic solution of 250 mOsm (Fig. 7A). The current was further activated in a hypotonic solution of 220 mOsm. A whole cellular current-voltage relation of hTTYH1 in a hypotonic solution was not obtained because the magnitude of the current was unstably high. Because the current at 0 mV was stable even in a hypotonic solution, this prominent current was not due to leakage but due to fluctuated opening and closing of the large channel. The current magnitude at 100 mV was measured (n = 6, Fig. 7B). The evoked current at 220 mOsm was diminished by 50 μm GdCl3 and abolished by 10 μm DIDS. On the other hand, the current of hTTYH3-expressed cells was significantly activated only when exposed to a solution of 220 mOsm. The evoked current was blocked by 50 μm GdCl3. This magnitude of activation in a hypotonic solution was, however, observed in GFP-transfected control CHO cells (19Suzuki M. Mizuno A. Kodaira K. Imai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22664-22668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that hTTYH1 is involved in a swelling-activated Cl- channel, whereas hTTYH3 may not be involved. Thus, the common feature of these three channels is large conductance. In this study, we showed that the hTTYH family possesses 5 or 6 transmembrane segments encoding a large conductance Cl- channel. The structure of hTTYH3 was estimated by computer-based hydrophobic analysis, addition of tag alignment, and glycosylation scanning. The results of a mutation study suggested that the structure of this novel maxi-Cl- channel is similar to the structure of known cation channels, in which a selective pore is located between TMS5 and TMS6 and a regulatory domain is located in the C terminus. An ion channel with the pore domain between TMS5 and TMS6 is a prototype structure of cation-permeable channels, such as the K+ channel encoded by the Kv family and the Ca2+ channel encoded by the Trp family (20Minke B.

Post-translational regulation of p27 by different phosphorylation events is critical in allowing cells to proceed through the cell cycle. We now demonstrate that the arginine-directed kinase, Mirk/dyrk1B, is maximally active in G0 in NIH3T3 cells, when it stabilizes p27 by phosphorylating it at Ser-10. The phospho-mimetic mutant p27-S10D was more stable, and the non-phosphorylatable mutant p27-S10A was less stable than wild-type when expressed in G0-arrested cells. Following phosphorylation by Mirk, p27 remains a functional CDK inhibitor, capable of binding to CDK2. Mirk did not induce the translocation of p27 from the nucleus in G0, but instead co-localized with nuclear p27. Depletion of Mirk by RNA interference decreased the phosphorylation of p27 at Ser-10 and the stability of endogenous p27. RNAi to Mirk increased cell entry from G0 into G1 as shown by increased expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and decreased expression of p27. These data suggest a model in which Mirk increases the amount of nuclear p27 by stabilizing it during G0 when Mirk is most abundant. Mitogen stimulation then causes cells to enter G1, reduces Mirk levels (Deng, X., Ewton, D., Pawlikowski, B., Maimone, M., and Friedman, E. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 41347-41354), and initiates the translocation of p27 to the cytoplasm. In addition, depletion of Mirk by RNAi in postmitotic C2C12 myoblasts decreased protein but not mRNA levels of p27, suggesting that stabilization of p27 by Mirk also occurs during differentiation. Elevated levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27 block the cell in G0/G1 until mitogenic signals activate G1 cyclins and initiate proliferation.

Mitogenic signals also induce the kinase KIS, which mediates phosphorylation of p27 at Ser-10 (6Boehm M. Yoshimoto T. Crook M. Nallamshetty S. True A. Nabel G. Nabel E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3390-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), facilitating the translocation of p27 to the cytoplasm at later times in G1 (7Ishida N. Kitagawa M. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K.

However, p27 has been shown to be already phosphorylated at Ser-10 in G0/early G1 before KIS induction (7Ishida N. Kitagawa M. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. J. Biol.

Furthermore, p27 is solely nuclear in G0 and does not even bind to its exportin CRM1 until cells enter G1 following mitogen stimulation (9Connor M.K. Kotchetkov R. Cariou S. Resch A. Lupetti R. Beniston R.G. Melchior F. Hengst L. Slingerland J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), implying that phosphorylation at Ser-10 may fulfill another function. In this study we identify the arginine-directed serine/threonine kinase Mirk/dyrk1B as a kinase active in G0 which phosphorylates p27 at Ser-10 without inducing its translocation from the nucleus. Mirk/dyrk1B is a member of the Dyrk/minibrain family of arginine-directed serine/threonine kinases. Mirk is transcriptionally up-regulated by Rho family members (10Deng X. Ewton D. Pawlikowski B.

Chem. 2002; 277: 49438-49445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Mirk is expressed at elevated levels in some tumor cells and in normal skeletal muscle (13Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar) where it is active in muscle differentiation (10Deng X. Ewton D. Pawlikowski B. Maimone M. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41347-41354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, Mirk is widely expressed at low levels, suggesting it performs some general role. In the current study we demonstrate a novel function for Mirk, stabilization of the CDK inhibitor p27 kip1 during the G0 phase of the cell cycle. Materials—Antibody to p27Kip1 was from Transduction Laboratories; antibodies to PCNA, 1The abbreviations used are: PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; HNF1α, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α. CDK2, β-tubulin, and cyclin A were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and antibody to the FLAG-epitope was from Sigma. Antibody to the Ser-10-phosphorylated form of p27 was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody to a unique sequence at the C terminus of Mirk was raised as described (13Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody to the unique N terminus of Mirk was used (13Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). GST-ERK2 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, inc. Polyvinylidene difluoride transfer paper Immobilon-P was purchased from Millipore. PLUS reagent and LipofectAMINE were from Invitrogen. All radioactive materials were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, ECL reagents from Amersham Biosciences, and tissue culture reagents from Mediatech (Fisher). All other reagents were from Sigma. Cell Culture—C2C12 mouse myoblasts and NIH3T3 cells were obtained from the ATCC. NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. C2C12 cells were maintained in growth medium: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal calf serum, and switched to differentiation medium/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% horse serum. NIH3T3 and C2C12 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE/PLUS according to the supplier's manual. Plasmids—pcDNA-Mirk, pcDNA-MirkYF, and pcDNA-MirkKR (kinase-inactive Mirk) had been generated previously (13Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). pGEX2T p27-wild-type, pGEX2T p27-NADA, pGEX2T p27-VPKK, and pGEX2T p27-NADA/VPKK were the kind gift of Dr. B. Amati (14Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5334-5344Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Wild-type p27Kip1 (pGEX2T-p27) was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis (Gene-Editor system from Promega) and subcloned into pCMV-tag2 (Stratagene) to make FLAG epitope-tagged constructs. All mutant p27 constructs were sequenced to confirm the mutated sequence. RNAi sequences to murine Mirk were si1, GACCTACAAGCACATCATT, and si3, CAGAGCCTACCGATACAG, whereas another sequence mutant at two positions to murine Mirk, si2, GCTCTCTGTGGACCTCA, served as the mutant control. Each was inserted into the pSilencer plasmid (Ambion). Phosphatase Treatment of Phosphorylated p27—FLAG-tagged p27 was immunoprecipitated from total cell lysates, and the immunocomplex was treated with 1 unit of alkaline phosphatase (Promega) in the presence of protease inhibitors (15Deng X. Bellis S. Yan Z. Friedman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 11-18PubMed Google Scholar). In Vitro Kinase Assay—The immunoprecipitates were washed five times with lysis buffer and three times with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT), incubated for 15 min at 30 °C with 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 50 μm cold ATP plus 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μg of purified recombinant p27 protein as substrate, and then analyzed by PAGE and autoradiography. TnT products were produced as detailed previously (13Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). GST Fusion Proteins—Mirk and the p27 constructs were subcloned into the pGEX 4T1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) and expressed and purified as described (16Frangioni J. Neel B. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Briefly, 300 ml of LB media was seeded with 10% of overnight culture of JM109 cells carrying the desired expression plasmid and incubated at 37 °C for 1-2 h. Protein expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 6 h at 24 °C, and bacteria were collected by centrifugation and frozen at -70 °C. Pellets, averaging 2 g each, were resuspended in 5 ml of ice-cold STE (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 100 μg/ml lysozyme and protease inhibitors (Complete Mini-Tabs Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set, Roche Applied Science) and incubated on ice for 15 min. DTT was added to a final concentration of 5 mm and then Sarkosyl was added to a final concentration of 1.5% (w/v). Bacteria were lysed by sonication using a microtip (Misonix, setting 2.5) for 3 min, using 5-s bursts separated by 5 s of rest. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 20 min. 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and an additional 1× of protease inhibitor mixture were added to the clarified lysates, and 13-ml portions were incubated with 1 ml (bed volume) of glutathione-Sepharose 4-B (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C overnight with end-on rotation. Beads were washed six times with 10 volumes of ice-cold PBS (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3). GST fusion proteins used for in vitro kinase assays were eluted from the beads by overnight incubation at 4 °C with 1 ml of glutathione elution buffer (75 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm reduced glutathione, 5 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100) per ml of bead volume used. Recombinant p27 used in immune complex kinase reactions was cleaved from GST by incubation with thrombin (Amersham Biosciences, 50 units per ml of bead volume in PBS) for 18 h at room temperature. Thrombin was removed from the preparation by incubation with 1 ml of benzamidine-Sepharose 6-B (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunodetection—Following treatment as indicated and washing twice with PBS, cells were lysed in boiling SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol). Lysates were boiled again for 5 min and vortexed vigorously. Protein determinations were made using Coomassie protein assay reagent from Pierce. Depending on the experiment, 30-50 μg of cell lysate were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes after separation by SDS-PAGE. The blots were blocked in 5% milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibody in TBST buffer, 3% milk, and proteins were subsequently detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Northern Analysis—20 μg of total RNA from each cell line was electrophoresed in a 1.1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to nylon membranes by downward capillary transfer, and cross-linked by baking. The membranes were hybridized to a labeled p27 cDNA probe containing 600 bp of p27 coding sequence in pCMV5 (1Polyak K. Lee M.-H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Koff A. Roberts J. Tempst P. Massague J. Cell. 1994; 78: 59-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2057) Google Scholar). Probes were labeled with 32P by random priming. The blot was hybridized overnight at 68 °C with at least 107 cpm of the labeled probe, washed at room temperature twice for 15 min with 1× SSC-0.1% SDS, then washed for 15 min at 65 °C in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and autoradiographed. Band Analysis—Immunoblots were scanned using a Lacie Silver-scanner, and densitometry was performed using the IP Lab Gel program (Scanalytics). Mirk Is a G0 Kinase That Phosphorylates p27 in Vivo—The serine/threonine kinase Mirk/dyrk1B is widely expressed at low levels in normal tissues (13Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Mirk may play a general role in either cell physiology or cell growth. In addition, Mirk protein levels are known to vary widely in response to treatment of cells both with mitogens and with anti-proliferative stimuli (13Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar), so we determined whether Mirk exhibited any regulation within the cell cycle. NIH3T3 cells arrest in G0/G1 when grown to confluence and move into S phase in a synchronous wave 10-14 h after release (17Takuwa N. Takuwa Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5348-5358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein levels of cyclin A were used to monitor cell cycle progression through late G1 to S. Mirk protein levels were elevated in density-arrested NIH3T3 cells, and these levels fell sharply when cells transited late G1 and entered S phase (Fig. 1A). Thus Mirk levels were elevated in G0/G1 and were reduced in cycling cells. Levels of the CDK inhibitor p27 are elevated when cells reach confluence and arrest in G0 (18Coats S. Flanagan W. Nourse J. Roberts J. Science. 1996; 272: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar, 19Polyak K. Kato J.-Y. Solomon M. Scherr C. Massague J. Roberts J. Koff A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar), the cell cycle phase in which Mirk activity was greatest, so we tested the hypothesis that Mirk phosphorylated p27 in G0. Mirk was immunoprecipitated from NIH3T3 growth-arrested cells and from cells at various times after release, and then its capacity to phosphorylate exogenous p27 was determined by an in vitro kinase assay. The greatest phosphorylation of p27 by Mirk was seen in cells in G0/G1 concordant with the highest Mirk levels 0-6 h post-release (Fig. 1B). At later time points, cells had undergone the G1/S transition as shown by the increase in cyclin A, and the levels and the capacity of Mirk to phosphorylate p27 decreased. Mirk Phosphorylates p27 in Vitro and in Vivo at Ser-10 —We next determined the specific site at which Mirk phosphorylated p27. Recombinant Mirk is a constitutively active kinase (13Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar), so its capacity to phosphorylate p27 was assayed using in vitro kinase assays. Mirk phosphorylated the CDK inhibitor p27, with kinase-inactive YF-Mirk serving as the negative control (Fig. 2). In contrast, recombinant p38α and JNK1 had little kinase activity on p27 (data not shown). CDK2 phosphorylation at Thr-187 initiated the ubiquitination and rapid degradation of p27 by the proteasome (3Sheaff R. Groudine M. Gordon M. Roberts J. Clurman B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1464-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar, 4Muller D. Bouchard C. Rudolph B. Steiner P. Stuckman I. Saffrich R. Ansorge W. Huttner W. Eilers M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2561-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), so we tested whether mutation of the CDK-binding site, the Thr-187 phosphorylation site, or the Ser-10 site, which facilitates the translocation of p27 to the cytoplasm (8Ishida N.

Di Marcotullio L. Coulombe P. Draetta G.F. Pagano M. Meloche S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6672-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), altered Mirk activity. The double mutant p27-F62A/F64A, a construct deficient in interaction with CDKs (14Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5334-5344Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), a p27 construct mutant at its conserved C-terminal CDK target site (T187V), and a triple mutant (F62A/F64A/T187V) were each phosphorylated by Mirk to a similar extent as wild-type p27 (Fig. 2), indicating these sites were irrelevant to Mirk action in vitro. Moreover, Mirk is a highly selective p27-S10 kinase. Mirk was unable to phosphorylate p27-S10A, whereas it phosphorylated wild-type p27, p27-S178A, and the p27 CDK phosphorylation site mutant T187V to a similar extent in in vitro kinase reactions (Fig. 3). In contrast, ERK2 phosphorylated each of the mutant p27 constructs to an equal extent, somewhat less than wild-type p27. These results show that Mirk has a very defined substrate requirement for the Ser-10 residue in p27 and suggest that Mirk is at least one of the kinases responsible for phosphorylation at Ser-10 in vivo.Fig. 3Mirk phosphorylates p27 at Ser-10. GST-p27 constructs were prepared of wild-type (WT) p27, p27 mutated to S10A, S178A, or T187A. Purified recombinant GST-Mirk or GST-ERK2 was added to each p27 construct in an in vitro kinase reaction. The phosphorylated p27 molecules were separated by SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. Coomassie Blue (CB) staining confirmed equal amounts of p27 constructs were tested.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Ser-10 is the major phosphorylation site for p27 in vivo, accounting for about 70% of the total amount of p27 phosphorylation as determined by metabolic labeling with [32P]orthophosphate (7Ishida N.

Phosphorylation of p27 at Ser-10 has been shown, by use of a p27-S10D phospho-mimetic mutant, to facilitate p27 translocation to the cytoplasm in response to mitogens, whereas mutation of Ser-10 to alanine prevents export to the cytoplasm (8Ishida N.

In G0, p27 is solely nuclear and does not even bind to its exportin CRM1 until cells enter G1 following mitogen stimulation (9Connor M.K. Kotchetkov R. Cariou S. Resch A. Lupetti R. Beniston R.G. Melchior F. Hengst L. Slingerland J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that phosphorylation of p27 at Ser-10 is a major control point in the cellular mitogenic response. The mitogen-induced kinase KIS has been identified as one kinase that mediates phosphorylation of Ser-10 in vivo (6Boehm M. Yoshimoto T. Crook M. Nallamshetty S. True A. Nabel G. Nabel E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3390-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). However, p27 has been shown to be phosphorylated already at Ser-10 to some extent in G0/early G1 before KIS induction (7Ishida N. Kitagawa M. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25146-25154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 8Ishida N. Hara T. Kamura T. Yoshida M. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14355-14358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Mirk activity is highest in density-arrested NIH3T3 cells in G0 (Fig. 1), and it is rapidly down-regulated by serum mitogens (13Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). These properties suggest that Mirk could phosphorylate p27 at Ser-10 during G0, before mitogen induction of KIS. To confirm that Mirk phosphorylates p27 in vivo, either wild-type or kinase-inactive KR-Mirk was co-transfected with either wild-type or p27-S10A FLAG epitope-tagged expression constructs into NIH3T3 cells. Following expression, the constructs were labeled for 16 h with 32Pi, and then the 32P-labeled p27 was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and analyzed by PAGE and autoradiography. The amount of 32Pi incorporated into wild-type p27 was severalfold higher when wild-type Mirk was co-expressed (Fig. 4, 3rd lane), whereas little incorporation was seen when wild-type p27 was co-expressed with kinase-inactive Mirk or vector control. In contrast, co-expression of wild-type Mirk did not increase the low basal level of 32Pi incorporated into mutant p27-S10A (Fig. 4, last 3 lanes). Western blotting for transfected p27 using anti-FLAG antibody demonstrated equal expression of all constructs (Fig. 4, lower lanes). These metabolic labeling data confirm that Mirk phosphorylates p27 in vivo at Ser-10. Phosphorylation can impede protein mobility on SDS-PAGE. Mirk phosphorylation of p27 in vivo reduced its electrophoretic mobility. Constructs for wild-type p27 and either wild-type Mirk, kinase-inactive YF-Mirk, or the pcDNA(HisA) vector were co-transfected into NIH3T3 cells and allowed to express, and the mobility of p27 was determined by Western blotting (Fig. 5A, 1st 3 lanes). Only the p27 co-transfected with wild-type Mirk exhibited a decrease in mobility. When wild-type Mirk was co-expressed with the mutant p27 constructs S10A, T170A, S178A, or T187V, all of the mutants except S10A exhibited the mobility shift. The p27-T187V construct is itself a little longer than wild-type p27 so its shift was confirmed by co-transfection with the HisA epitope-tagged vector (Fig. 5, last 3 lanes on right). Phosphatase treatment demonstrated that the p27 mobility shift was caused by phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). Immunoprecipitated FLAG epitope-tagged p27 constructs (wild-type or S10A) were incubated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase before Western blotting. Treatment with the phosphatase eliminated the p27 mobility shift induced by co-transfected wild-type Mirk, thus demonstrating definitively that Mirk phosphorylates p27 in vivo solely at Ser-10. p27 Phosphorylated at Ser-10 by Mirk Binds to CDK2—We next determined whether p27 phosphorylated at Ser-10 could function as a CDK inhibitor. FLAG-p27 and Mirk were co-expressed in NIH3T3 cells. Following phosphorylation by Mirk in vivo, p27 was still capable of binding to CDK2 (Fig. 6A). The FLAG-p27 bound to immunoprecipitated CDK2 exhibited decreased mobility on SDS-PAGE following co-expression with Mirk (Fig. 6A, arrows), indicating that it had been phosphorylated. The equal amount of immunoglobulin heavy chain (H-chain) indicates equal amounts of antibody were found in the immunoprecipitates. These data demonstrate that p27 phosphorylated by Mirk in G0 was still capable of functioning as a CDK inhibitor. Mirk Phosphorylation of p27 Blocked by RNAi to Mirk—The capacity of endogenous Mirk to phosphorylate p27 at Ser-10 was further evaluated by expression of small interfering RNA to Mirk using the pSilencer vector. Two sequences within the Mirk coding region were targeted to murine Mirk sequences and termed si1 and si3. For the RNAi control, a mutant sequence si2 was used. NIH3T3 cells were co-transfected in serum-free medium with a 10 to 1 ratio (μg/μg) of RNAi plasmid to pEGFP plasmid, and with an expression plasmid for p27 to enable the phosphorylation of p27 to be readily detected. Cell lysates contained roughly equal levels of green fluorescent protein, demonstrating similar transfection efficiencies (not shown), so lysates were examined for Mirk abundance by Western blotting. Two days after transfection with plasmids expressing either si1 or si3, a decrease in both endogenous Mirk protein levels and in phosphorylation of p27 at Ser-10 was detected by Western blotting. Little effect on either Mirk or p27 phosphorylation was seen with the si2 RNA that was used as an small interfering RNA control (Fig. 6B). A plot of the Mirk/tubulin ratio and the ratio of p27 phosphorylated at Ser-10 to total exogenous p27 from Fig. 6B and a duplicate experiment demonstrated that RNAi si1 and si3 both reduced endogenous Mirk levels and reduced exogenous p27-S10 phosphorylation by half after 48 h (Fig. 6D). Thus there was a concordance between reduction of Mirk protein levels and reduction of p27 phosphorylation at Ser-10. Mirk Phosphorylation of p27 Increases Its Stability in Vivo— Phosphorylation of p27 at Ser-10 has been reported to stabilize p27 (7Ishida N. Kitagawa M. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25146-25154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We confirmed this observation by measuring the half-life of non-phosphorylatable p27-S10A, phospho-mimetic p27-S10D, and wild-type FLAG-p27 constructs in NIH3T3 cells growth-arrested in G0 by serum deprivation. Translation arrest by addition of cycloheximide followed by Western blotting confirmed that the p27-S10D phospho-mimetic construct was the most stable (Fig. 6E). Reducing Mirk levels with RNAi also decreased the stability of endogenous p27 (Fig. 6F). Mirk Knockdown by RNA Interference Increases Cell Cycling—These data implied that depleting endogenous Mirk in G0 would destabilize p27 and might allow some cells to “leak” into G1. To test this hypothesis, NIH3T3 cells were transfected for 24 h with either pSilencer expressing si1 or control. Cells were cultured serum-free for another 2 days to block the untreated cells in G0 and to determine whether cells depleted of Mirk could enter G1 in the absence of mitogens. Depletion of Mirk blocks the stabilization of p27 (Fig. 6F) and should decrease p27 levels. RNAi to Mirk decreased Mirk levels to a mean of 37% of control values and decreased p27 levels by half (Fig. 6C, mean of three measurements ± S.E.), confirming the hypothesis. Movement from G0 to G1 was assayed by measurement of the abundance of the proliferation marker PCNA by Western blotting. RNAi to Mirk increased the abundance of PCNA 33% ± 7 (mean of three experiments, Fig. 6C). Thus depleting the G0-arrested cell of Mirk destabilized p27 and moved the cell into G1. Mirk Co-localizes with p27 in Vivo—Phosphorylation of p27 at Ser-10 has been shown to facilitate p27 translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to mitogens, whereas mutation of Ser-10 to alanine prevents export to the cytoplasm (8Ishida N. Hara T. Kamura T. Yoshida M. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14355-14358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 20Rodier G. Montagnoli A. Di Marcotullio L. Coulombe P. Draetta G.F. Pagano M. Meloche S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6672-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Mirk phosphorylates p27 at Ser-10 in G0, yet p27 remains localized in the nucleus until the middle of G1. We tested the hypothesis that phosphorylation at p27-S10 was not sufficient to initiate p27 translocation in G0 by overexpressing Mirk-EGFP or kinase-inactive YF-Mirk-EGFP together with either p27-DsRed or p27-S10A-DsRed in G0-arrested serum-starved NIH3T3 cells. Fluorescent photomicrographs of Mirk alone, p27 alone, and a merged green/red fluorescence were made (Fig. 7). Mirk and YF-Mirk were predominantly nuclear with some diffuse presence in the cytosol, whereas p27 and p27-S10A were localized solely in the nucleus. When the fields were merged, p27, either wild-type or S10A, and nuclear Mirk, wild-type or kinase-inactive, strongly overlapped. Therefore, phosphorylation of p27-S10 by overexpressed Mirk was not sufficient to induce translocation of p27 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in G0. Phosphorylation of p27-S10 by Mirk in G0 stabilizes p27 and increases its abundance rather than facilitating its translocation out of the nucleus. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that Mirk aids in maintaining cell arrest through phosphorylation of p27 at Ser-10, which occurs in G0 when Mirk is most abundant. Mitogen stimulation then causes cells to enter G1, reduces Mirk levels (13Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar), and induces the KIS kinase that phosphorylates p27 during G1 (6Boehm M. Yoshimoto T. Crook M. Nallamshetty S. True A. Nabel G. Nabel E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3390-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Induction of Mirk during Myoblast Differentiation Enables p27 to Be Stabilized in Post-mitotic Myoblasts—We used RNAi in differentiated C2C12 myoblasts to examine the effect of Mirk expression on p27 stability in a cell system in which Mirk functioned physiologically in differentiation. We reported recently (10Deng X. Ewton D. Pawlikowski B. Maimone M. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41347-41354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) that depletion of endogenous Mirk from differentiating C2C12 myoblasts using RNA interference prevented the induction of myogenin and various contractile proteins and blocked the fusion of myoblasts into myocytes. We found that reduction of Mirk levels by RNA interference in differentiating myoblasts caused a 13-fold decrease in p27 protein levels (Fig. 8) with only a 20% decrease in p27 mRNA levels (not shown). The minimal effect of Mirk on p27 mRNA levels was also seen by microarray analysis (data not shown) and confirmed our earlier results (21Ewton D. Lee K. Deng X. Lim S. Friedman E. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 103: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which showed that Mirk did not modulate the activity of a p27 promoter construct. These data indicated that Mirk plays a post-translational role in maintaining p27 stability in post-mitotic myoblasts as well as NIH3T3 cells. The current study resolves some apparently conflicting experimental results in the literature. It was clearly demonstrated previously (7Ishida N. Kitagawa M. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25146-25154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) that phosphorylation of p27 at Ser-10 confers increased stability on p27, data which we have duplicated in the current study using NIH3T3 cells arrested in G0. Other investigators (8Ishida N. Hara T. Kamura T. Yoshida M. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14355-14358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 9Connor M.K. Kotchetkov R. Cariou S. Resch A. Lupetti R. Beniston R.G. Melchior F. Hengst L. Slingerland J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) have presented equally strong data that phosphorylation of p27 at Ser-10 is required for p27 to bind to the exportin CRM1 and to be translocated to the cytoplasm during G1 where p27 is proteolyzed by the proteasome, and thus shows less stability. Our results indicate that phosphorylation of p27 at Ser-10 has two outcomes which are cell cycle-dependent. Phosphorylation of p27 at Ser-10 during G0 by Mirk/dyrk1B stabilizes p27 and maintains p27 within the nucleus where it can bind to CDK2. In contrast, phosphorylation of p27 at Ser-10 by the KIS kinase in G1 enables p27 to bind to CRM1 and to be transported into the cytoplasm for destruction (6Boehm M. Yoshimoto T. Crook M. Nallamshetty S. True A. Nabel G. Nabel E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3390-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In support of our conclusions, other investigators (9Connor M.K. Kotchetkov R. Cariou S. Resch A. Lupetti R. Beniston R.G. Melchior F. Hengst L. Slingerland J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) have clearly shown that association of p27 with CRM1 is minimal in G0 and increases markedly during the G1 to S phase progression. Why are two different kinases needed to perform the same phosphorylation? Mirk and KIS exhibit markedly different transcriptional regulation so they do not occupy the same phase of the cell cycle. Cellular mitogens transcriptionally down-regulate Mirk/dyrk1B (10Deng X. Ewton D. Pawlikowski B. Maimone M. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41347-41354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), whereas mitogens induce the transcription of KIS (6Boehm M. Yoshimoto T. Crook M. Nallamshetty S. True A. Nabel G. Nabel E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3390-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Mirk levels and activity are highest in G0 (this study) and decline during G1 when KIS levels and activity are rising. Therefore, KIS is not present during G0 to phosphorylate p27. The current study has shown that p27 is not transported to the cytoplasm even after phosphorylation at Ser-10 by Mirk. Thus phosphorylation at Ser-10 is not sufficient to enable p27 to bind to CRM1 during G0. Possibly Mirk and p27 occupy a different part of the nucleus than CRM1 during G0. Mirk is found in 670-kDa complexes within the nucleus together with the Ran-binding protein RanBPM (12Lim S. Zou Y. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49438-49445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 22Zou Y. Lim S. Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49573-49581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Jab1 functions as an adaptor between CRM1 and p27 (23Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Arata Y. Mori S. Maeda M.

The Mirk-containing nuclear complexes have not been completely characterized, but we found in an earlier study that they do not contain Jab1 (22Zou Y. Lim S. Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49573-49581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), which is found within the 450-kDa signalosome and smaller complexes (22Zou Y. Lim S. Lee K. Deng X.

The serine/threonine kinase Mirk/dyrk1B is a RhoA-induced gene that functions in muscle differentiation (10Deng X. Ewton D. Pawlikowski B. Maimone M. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41347-41354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) but is widely expressed at low levels, suggesting that it participates in some general cellular control mechanisms. In the current study we have identified one such Mirk function, phosphorylation of p27 to assist the maintenance of the cell in G0. Other members of the Dyrk/minibrain family include Dyrk1A, which has been implicated in neuronal development through its phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein (24Kentrup H.

Dyrk3 functions in late erythroid progenitor cells to inhibit programmed cell death through activation of the cAMP-response element response pathway (26Geiger J.N. Knudsen G.T. Panek L. Pandit A.K.

The related kinase HIPK2 promotes the pro-apoptotic transcriptional function of the tumor suppressor protein p53 (28Hofmann T. Molle A. Sirma H. Zentgraf H. Taya Y. Droge W. Will H. Schmitz M. Nat.

Fanciulli M. Appella E. Soddu S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Although found at only low levels in most normal tissues, Mirk is expressed at high levels in skeletal and cardiac muscle (13Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lee K.-M. Friedman E. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1998; 39: 273Google Scholar). The role of Mirk in muscle differentiation is likely to be multifactorial, involving broad, indirect effects of Mirk acting as a transcriptional activator, as well as more direct effects of Mirk functioning as a substrate-specific kinase. Mirk has been shown to function, in a kinase-dependent manner, as a co-activator of the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF1α) (11Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25040-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Mirk binds to HNF1α through its cofactor, DCoH, which binds as a dimer to the unstable HNF1α dimer, thus enabling effective binding of the tetrameric complex to DNA. We speculate that Mirk may act as a co-activator of one of the transcription factors for the myogenin gene. We have also reported recently (22Zou Y. Lim S. Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49573-49581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) that Mirk functions to inhibit cell migration. This study identifies an additional function of Mirk/dyrk1B, specific phosphorylation of the CDK inhibitor p27 at Ser-10. p27 acts as a brake on the proliferation program. Mirk phosphorylation of p27 may assist differentiating myoblasts to arrest in G0 by stabilizing p27."
https://openalex.org/W1987416188,"Stat3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-3) activity is required for transformation by a number of oncogenes, while a constitutively active form of Stat3 alone is sufficient to induce neoplastic transformation. Although in most instances Stat3 is growth-promoting, the impact of cell density on Stat3 activation status and the biological importance of Stat3 during growth arrest have not been characterized. Previous results indicated that cell density alters tyrosine phosphorylation levels of cultured cells. Since signalling through Stat3 is determined by a key phosphorylation at tyr705, we examined the effects of cell density upon Stat3 activity in normal breast epithelial cells, breast carcinoma lines and normal mouse fibroblasts. Intriguingly, the results revealed a dramatic increase in Stat3, tyr705 phosphorylation and activity with cell density, which gradually declined at later stages. This activation was dependent upon cell–cell contact, since it was eliminated if cell adhesion was disrupted through calcium chelation, while it was reinstated through cell aggregation. Furthermore, this activation was suppressed following inhibition of JAKs (Janus kinases) but not inhibition of Fer, IGF1-R, or kinases of the c-Src family. On the other hand, constitutively active Stat3 in carcinoma lines, known to harbor activated Src, was blocked by pharmacological inhibitors of Src as well as JAKs. These results point to the existence of two distinct pathways of Stat3 activation in breast carcinomas, based on Src dependence. More importantly, our results suggest that Stat3 activity is upregulated during the confluence-mediated growth arrest by a signalling mechanism that requires JAKs."
https://openalex.org/W2104656074,"Cyclin-dependent protein kinases are among the key regulators of eukaryotic cell cycle progression. Potential functions of the five cdc2-related kinases (CRK) in Trypanosoma brucei were analyzed using the RNA interference (RNAi) technique. In both the procyclic and bloodstream forms of T. brucei, CRK1 is apparently involved in controlling the G1/S transition, whereas CRK3 plays an important role in catalyzing cells across the G2/M junction. A knockdown of CRK1 caused accumulation of cells in the G1 phase without apparent phenotypic change, whereas depletion of CRK3 enriched cells of both forms in the G2/M phase. However, two distinctive phenotypes were observed between the CRK3-deficient procyclic and bloodstream forms. The procyclic form has a majority of the cells containing a single enlarged nucleus plus one kinetoplast. There is also an enhanced population of anucleated cells, each containing a single kinetoplast known as the zoids (0N1K). The CRK3-depleted bloodstream form has an increased number of one nucleus-two kinetoplast cells (1N2K) and a small population containing aggregated multiple nuclei and multiple kinetoplasts. Apparently, these two forms have different mechanisms in cell cycle regulation. Although the procyclic form can be driven into cytokinesis and cell division by kinetoplast segregation without a completed mitosis, the bloodstream form cannot enter cytokinesis under the same condition. Instead, it keeps going through another G1 phase and enters a new S phase resulting in an aggregate of multiple nuclei and multiple kinetoplasts in an undivided cell. The different leakiness in cell cycle regulation between two stage-specific forms of an organism provides an interesting and useful model for further understanding the evolution of cell cycle control among the eukaryotes.

The different leakiness in cell cycle regulation between two stage-specific forms of an organism provides an interesting and useful model for further understanding the evolution of cell cycle control among the eukaryotes. The progression of the eukaryotic cell cycle is dictated by an ordered series of checkpoints, each regulated by multiple, but well conserved, regulatory proteins. They exert a tight control over DNA replication, mitosis, cytogenesis, and cell division resulting in maintenance of genomic stability. Through the well controlled periodic synthesis and destruction of various cyclins, the cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CRK, cdc2-related kinase; RNAi, RNA interference; BrdUrd, 5-bromo-2-de-oxyuridine; FACS, fluorescence activated cell sorting; DAPI, 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; PI, propidium iodide; RT, reverse transcriptase. activity goes through a corresponding sequential fluctuation, which provides the primary means of cell cycle control (1Johnson D.G. Walker C.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 295-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there are three G1 cyclins (CLN1-CLN3) and six B-type mitotic cyclins (CLB1-CLB6) that interact with a single CDK, CDC28, in a sequential and overlapping manner to activate the latter for regulating the yeast cell cycle (2Nurse P.

Ehbrecht I.M. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1996; 377: 481-487PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, there have been at least 9 CDK and 16 cyclin homologues identified. Although not all of them are involved in directing the cell cycle, the overlapping regulatory functions already identified among many of these proteins in cell cycle progression suggest a most complex controlling system (1Johnson D.G. Walker C.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 295-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Trypanosoma brucei is a parasitic protozoan and the causative agent of sleeping sickness in Africa. It is also generally regarded as a deeply branched and relatively primitive eukaryote further removed from mammals than yeast. The trypanosomes have a complex life cycle of distinctive stage-specific forms that alternate between an insect vector, the tsetse, and a mammalian host. The bloodstream form inhabiting the mammalian blood and the procyclic form in the midgut of tsetse are known to differ significantly in many biochemical and metabolic aspects due to their distinctive living environments (5Vickerman K. Br. Med. Bull. 1985; 41: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The trypanosome cell cycle in both bloodstream and procyclic forms has the usual sequential G1, S, G2, and M phases (6Woodward R. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 49-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). But it differs also from yeast and mammalian cells by the presence of a single mitochondrion in each cell, which divides synchronously with the nucleus (7Ploubidou A. Robinson D.R. Docherty R.C. Ogbadoyi E.O. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4641-4650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mitochondrial DNA complex, the kinetoplast, has its own cell cycle with an S phase (SK) and the phase of kinetoplast segregation preceding the nuclear S phase (SN) and mitosis, respectively (6Woodward R. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 49-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ploubidou A. Robinson D.R. Docherty R.C. Ogbadoyi E.O. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4641-4650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetoplast is closely associated with the flagellum basal body, and its segregation depends on the microtubule-mediated separation of replicated basal bodies, which represent the initial step of trypanosome cell division (8Robinson D.R. Gull K. Nature. 1991; 352: 731-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Kinetoplast segregation is presumably well coordinated with mitosis initiating and leading the cell through cytokinesis and eventual division (8Robinson D.R. Gull K. Nature. 1991; 352: 731-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Recent experimental evidence suggested, however, that these two events may not be inter-dependent of each other in procyclic form trypanosome, because okadaic acid treatment prevented the kinetoplast from replicating but resulted in multinucleated cells (9Robinson D.R. Sherwin T. Ploubidou A. Byard E.H. Gull K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Treatment with the nuclear DNA synthesis inhibitor aphidicolin or the antimicrotubule agent rhizoxin resulted in blocked mitosis without inhibiting kinetoplast segregation, which led to cytokinesis and cell division, generating anucleated daughter cells designated as the zoids (7Ploubidou A. Robinson D.R. Docherty R.C. Ogbadoyi E.O. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4641-4650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Das A. Gale Jr., M. Carter V. Parsons M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3477-3483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the kinetoplast cycle alone can apparently drive the procyclic form into cell division, a phenomenon not yet observed among other eukaryotes. It suggests leakiness in the mechanism of trypanosome cell cycle regulation. There are four PHO80 cyclin homologues, three B-type mitotic cyclin homologues, but no G1 cyclin homologue in the genome of T. brucei (11Li Z. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20652-20658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the procyclic form of trypanosome, one of the PHO80 homologues CycE1/CYC2 plays an essential role in controlling the G1/S passage, whereas the transition through G2/M is regulated by a single B-type mitotic cyclin CycB2/CYC6 (11Li Z. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20652-20658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). By using the technique of RNA interference (RNAi) in T. brucei, depletion of CycE1/CYC2 resulted in an enrichment of slender-shaped anucleated zoids, whereas a reduced CycB2/CYC6 level led to an enhanced population of stumpy-shaped zoids (11Li Z. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20652-20658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These results reiterated that, in the procyclic form, the kinetoplast cycle alone can drive the cells blocked in SN or mitosis through cytokinesis to cell division. But in a separate study, a knockdown of CycB2/CYC6 from the bloodstream form generated cells of one nucleus and multiple kinetoplasts without any anucleated zoids (12Hammarton T.C. Clark J. Douglas F. Boshart M. Mottram J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22877-22886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Thus, kinetoplast replication and segregation apparently continue in the absence of mitosis in the bloodstream form too, but they are incapable of bringing about cell divisions. These distinctive regulatory mechanisms of cell division demonstrated in two different developmental stages of the same living organism represent yet another unusual biological phenomenon in T. brucei not reported previously on other eukaryotes. The potential CDKs involved in regulating cell cycle progression in T. brucei have not yet been identified. Several CDK homologues in the T. brucei genome have been cloned from the previous studies and designated the cdc2-related kinases (CRKs) (13Mottram J.C. Smith G. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 162: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 14Hammarton T.C. Mottram J.C. Doerig C.D. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 2003; 5: 91-101PubMed Google Scholar). Among them, CRK1-4 and 6 have several features in common with the CDKs from yeasts and mammals, including an overall 40-50% amino acid sequence identity, a recognizable “PSTAIR” cyclin-binding box, and a “DSEI” box and the key threonine and tyrosine residues known as the important phosphorylation sites (13Mottram J.C. Smith G. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 162: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). There are also sequence features in these CRKs that distinguish them from yeast and mammalian CDKs, including an N-terminal extension in CRK2 and CRK3 and two additional domains within the catalytic site of CRK4 (13Mottram J.C. Smith G. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 162: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although sequence data alone cannot distinguish which CRK is involved in regulating the cell cycle, CRK3 was found to complex with CycE1/CYC2 (15Van Hellemond J.J. Neuville P. Schwarz R.T. Matthews K.R. Mottram J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8315-8323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) as well as CycB2/CYC6 (12Hammarton T.C. Clark J. Douglas F. Boshart M. Mottram J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22877-22886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) in yeast two-hybrid tests, thus suggesting its involvement in cell cycle control. In our present study, we used the RNAi technique to knockdown the respective expression of CRK1-4 and 6 in the procyclic as well as the bloodstream forms of T. brucei. Data thus assembled indicated that CRK1 plays a role in regulating the G1/S passage, whereas CRK3 is involved in G2/M transition in both forms of trypanosome. The cell cycle blockade resulted from CRK3 depletion led to an accumulation of zoids in the procyclic form, but only an enrichment of cells with multinucleated aggregates and multiple kinetoplasts was observed in the bloodstream form. This outcome not only reiterates the previous observations from cyclin knockdown studies (11Li Z. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20652-20658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12Hammarton T.C. Clark J. Douglas F. Boshart M. Mottram J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22877-22886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) but also reveals an important role of CRK3 in completing the mitosis required for cell division in the bloodstream form but apparently not in the procyclic form. There is thus a difference in the mechanisms of regulating cell division between the two developmental forms of trypanosome. Cell Culture—The procyclic form T. brucei strain 29-13 (16Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar) was cultivated at 26 °C in the Cunningham's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biological). G418 (15 μg/ml) and hygromycin B (50 μg/ml) were maintained in the culture medium to preserve the T7 RNA polymerase and tetracycline repressor gene constructs within the cells. The bloodstream form T. brucei strain 90-13 (16Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar) was cultivated at 37 °C in the HMI9 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10% serum plus (JRH Biosciences) (17Hirumi H. Hirumi K. J. Parasitol. 1989; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). G418 (2.5 μg/ml) and hygromycin B (5 μg/ml) were also added to the culture medium to maintain the T7 RNA polymerase and tetracycline repressor constructs. RNA Interference—A partial cDNA fragment (250-550 bp in length) of each of the five T. brucei CRK genes was used for RNAi. (The accession numbers of CRK1, CRK2, CRK3, CRK4, and CRK6 genes are X64314, X74598, X74617, AJ413200, and AJ505556, respectively.) The sequences used for RNAi were nucleotide numbers 12-493 for CRK1, 438-906 for CRK2, 4-279 for CRK3, 91-630 for CRK4, and 91-520 for CRK6. Each DNA fragment was amplified by PCR using a pair of gene-specific primers with respective XhoI and HindIII linkers and subcloned into the pZJM vector by replacing the α-tubulin fragment in it (18Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The resulting RNAi construct was linearized with NotI for integration into the rDNA spacer region in T. brucei chromosome. Transfection of the procyclic form T. brucei with the linearized DNA construct by electroporation was performed essentially according to the procedures described previously (19Li Z. Zou C.-B. Yao Y. Hoyt M.A. McDonough S. Mackey Z.B. Coffino P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15486-15498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 20Li Z. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42686-42693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The transfectants were selected under 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin, and single transfected cells were cloned by limiting dilutions. To induce RNAi, the cloned stable transfectants were cultured in the presence of 1.0 μg/ml tetracycline. Transfection of the bloodstream form T. brucei by electroporation was performed as described previously with some modifications (21Morris J.C. Wang Z. Drew M.E. Paul K.S. Englund P.T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 117: 111-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, a sample of 1 χ 107 log phased cells were harvested, washed once with cytomix buffer (22Mutomba M.C. To W.-Y. Hyun W.C. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 491-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and suspended in 0.5 ml of the same buffer containing 100 μg of the linearized pZJM DNA construct described above. Electroporation was carried out in a 4-mm cuvette using the Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) with parameters set as follows: 1.7-kV voltage, 400-ohm resistance, and 25-microfarad capacitance. The cells were transferred to a 24-well plate in HMI 9 medium immediately after electroporation and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The transfectants were then selected with the addition of 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin, and single cells were cloned by limiting dilutions. For induction of RNAi, the cloned stable transfectants were cultured in the presence of 1.0 μg/ml tetracycline. Cell numbers were counted under microscope at different time intervals using a hemocytometer. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from T. brucei cells using the TRIzol reagent (Amersham Biosciences). First-strand cDNAs were generated from DNase I-treated RNA samples using an oligo(dT)15 primer and Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Promega). PCR was then performed using the first-strand cDNA and a pair of gene-specific primers that differs from the primer pair used in generating the original RNAi construct (sequences available upon request). Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) Analysis—Cell samples for FACS analysis were prepared as described previously (22Mutomba M.C. To W.-Y. Hyun W.C. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 491-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, time samples of the transfected T. brucei cells (2 χ 106 cells) were collected before and during tetracycline induction, centrifuged at 2500 χ g and 4 °C for 10 min, and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mm NaCl, 8 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4). The cell pellets were gently suspended in 100 μl of PBS and mixed with 200 μl of 10% ethanol, 5% glycerol in PBS. It was then mixed with another 200 μl of 50% ethanol, 5% glycerol prior to incubation on ice for 5 min. One ml of 70% ethanol, 5% glycerol was then added, and the mixture was left at 4 °C overnight. The cells were then washed with PBS twice and suspended in PBS. DNase-free RNase (Sigma) and propidium iodide (PI) were added to the suspension to the final concentrations of 10 and 20 μg/ml, respectively, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature before the FACS analysis. The DNA content of PI-stained cells was analyzed with a FACScan analytical flow cytometer using the Cellquest software (BD Biosciences). Percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle, G1, S, and G2/M, was determined by the ModFitLT version 3.1 software (BD Biosciences). The same PI-stained cell samples were also examined under a Nikon phase-contrast and fluorescence microscope for a tabulation of numbers of nuclei and kinetoplasts in individual cells and a count of cells with different morphologies from a population of 200 cells. BrdUrd Labeling of Cells—5-Bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) was added to the transfected and tetracycline-induced T. brucei cells at a concentration of 0.3 mm. Cell samples were harvested after 2 days of incubation and washed and fixed as described above. Immunofluorescence assays for the incorporated BrdUrd were performed as described in the manufacturer's protocol (BD Biosciences). Briefly, the DNA in fixed cells was first denatured in 2 n HCl at room temperature for 20 min, washed, and neutralized in 0.1 m sodium borate. Mouse anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (Sigma) diluted 200-fold in PBS 0.5% bovine serum albumin was then added and incubated at room temperature for 1 h, followed by incubating with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (Sigma) diluted 1:70 in PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin for another hour. Slides were mounted in Vectashield in the presence of 1 μg of 4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) per ml and examined under a fluorescence microscope. RNA Interference of the Expression of Individual CRK Genes in T. brucei—We employed the RNAi technique to selectively knockdown expression of each of the five individual CRK genes both in the procyclic and bloodstream forms of T. brucei to explore the potential role each may play during the cell cycle. A 250-500-bp DNA fragment of a unique sequence from the coding region of each gene that has no significant sequence identity among the rest of the genome sequences in Trypanosome Genome Data base was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the RNAi vector pZJM (18Wang Z. Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40174-40179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The resulting construct was linearized and introduced by electroporation into either the procyclic form cells of T. brucei strain 29-13 or the bloodstream form cells of T. brucei strain 90-13 expressing both tetracycline repressor and T7 RNA polymerase. The stable transfectants in both forms were selected under phleomycin and cloned by limiting dilutions. Transcription of the DNA insert into double-stranded (ds) RNA was induced by adding tetracycline to the culture medium to switch on the T7 promoters, and the double-stranded RNA thus synthesized is known to lead to specific degradations of its corresponding mRNA in T. brucei (23Bastin P. Ellis K. Kohl L. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3321-3328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Moreira-Leite F.F. Sherwin T. Kohl L. Gull K.

Cell. 2002; 13: 3747-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The effect of RNAi on individual CRK gene expression was first examined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. The results (shown in the insets of Figs. 1A and 3) indicate that, after initiating RNAi for 3 days, the levels of mRNAs encoding individual CRKs were decreased significantly in both procyclic and bloodstream forms. This knockdown of gene expression was highly specific. Only a single mRNA species designated for the knockdown was diminished, whereas levels of the other CRK mRNAs remained unchanged in each case. Two such examples for the procyclic form T. brucei are presented in Fig. 1B, in which RT-PCR analysis shows that a CRK1 knockdown results only in a decreased level of CRK1 mRNA, whereas a CRK3 knockdown leads to the disappearance of only CRK3 transcript.Fig. 3Effects of CRK RNAi on the growth rate of bloodstream form T. brucei cells. Cloned bloodstream trypanosome cell lines harboring the CRK RNAi plasmid constructs were each incubated in culture medium without (-Tet) or with (+Tet) 1.0 μg/ml tetracycline at 37 °C. The rate of cell growth was monitored daily, and the cell numbers were plotted on a logarithmic scale. The insets show the intracellular mRNA levels monitored by semi-quantitative RT-PCR from the corresponding RNAi experiments after a 3-day induction. Levels of α-tubulin mRNA (TUB) were included as a sampling control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The effects of individual CRK mRNA depletion on growth of trypanosome cells were then monitored by a daily counting of the number of transfected cells with or without tetracycline induction (Figs. 1A and 3). Due to their different generation times, the slower growing procyclic form was cultivated for 9 days, whereas the bloodstream form was grown for 4 days in these experiments. Effects of Individual CRK Depletions on the Cell Cycle Progression of Procyclic form T. brucei—The results in Fig. 1 indicate that the growth rates of CRK1-, CRK3-, and CRK4-deficient cells were reduced to 19, 9, and 36% of the RNAi un-induced controls, respectively, in the procyclic form. Growth of cells depleted of either CRK2 or CRK6 assumed apparently the same rate as those cells growing without an induced RNAi. FACS analysis of the cell populations by their DNA contents indicated that 9 days after knocking down the expression of CRK1, there was an increase of about 10% cells in the G1 phase accompanied with a corresponding 10% decrease from the S phase, whereas the percentage of G2/M phase cells remained relatively unchanged (Fig. 2). The data can be taken as an indication that CRK1 plays a role in facilitating the cells across the G1/S checkpoint. Among the CRK3-depleted cells, those originally in the G1 phase were decreased from 45 to 15% of the total population, whereas the G2/M phase cells were increased from 20 to 50%, and the S phase cell population was not significantly changed (Fig. 2). CRK3 thus may perform an important function in catalyzing the procyclic form cells through G2/M transition. When CRK4 was deficient, there was relatively little change in the percentages of cells in different phases of the cell cycle as compared with the control (Fig. 2). It could be that CRK4 is not involved in cell cycle regulation at all, but the 64% inhibition of growth rate caused by its knockdown (Fig. 1) may also suggest that CRK4 is involved in controlling passage of cells through both G1/S and G2/M junctions. There were some minor fluctuations of cell population in the three cell cycle phases during the 9-day incubation when either CRK2 or CRK6 was deficient (Fig. 2). Because the rates of growth were unaffected by their removal (Fig. 1A), these two CRKs are most likely not involved or playing overlapping functions with other proteins in cell cycle regulation in the procyclic form of T. brucei. Effects of Individual CRK Depletions on the Cell Cycle Progression of Bloodstream Form T. brucei—In the bloodstream form, a knockdown of CRK1, CRK3, and CRK4 expression by RNAi resulted in reduced rates of growth of 17, 31, and 68% of the un-induced control, respectively, whereas a loss of CRK2 or CRK6 exerted no appreciable effect on growth rate (Fig. 3). When CRK1 was depleted from the cells, there was an increase of G1 phase cells (from 45 to 60%), accompanied by a corresponding decrease of S phase cells from 43 to 28% without appreciable change in the G2/M population over a period of 3 days. The data suggest that the transition from G1 to S phase is slowed down, and CRK1 may thus perform an important role in the G1/S transition in the bloodstream form as in the procyclic form (Fig. 2). Among the CRK3-deficient cells, those in the G1 phase were reduced from 50 to 30% of the total population, whereas the G2/M phase cells were enriched from 10 to 30%, and the S phase cells were not significantly changed after 3 days of induced RNAi (Fig. 4). CRK3 is thus likely playing a similar role in the bloodstream form as in the procyclic form by being an important protein kinase promoting transition of cells across the G2/M checkpoint. The deficiency of CRK2, CRK4, or CRK6 resulted in little appreciable change in the profile of cells compared with the un-induced RNAi cell population (Fig. 4). Taken together, the data indicated little discrepancy in the profiles of CRK functions between the procyclic and bloodstream forms. CRK1 plays a role in catalyzing the G1/S transition, and CRK3 is involved in the G2 to M phase transition in cell cycle control in both forms. The partial growth inhibition from CRK4 deficiency on both forms of T. brucei keeps the possibility open that it could be involved in both G1/S and G2/M transitions. Distinctive Morphologies of the CRK3-deficient Procyclic and Bloodstream Form Cells—The PI-stained CRK1-, CRK3-, and CRK4-depleted cells in both forms were examined under a fluorescence microscope for potential aberrations in intracellular numbers of nuclei and kinetoplasts and cellular morphology. There was no apparent change among the CRK1- and CRK4-depleted cells in both forms compared with the un-induced controls (data not shown). However, when PI-stained CRK3-deficient cells were examined, distinctive morphological changes were observed in the two forms of T. brucei. In the procyclic form 5 days after induction of CRK3 RNAi, the population of one nucleus-one kinetoplast (1N1K) cells was decreased slightly from 75 to 65% (Fig. 5B). But the average size of individual nuclei in the CRK3-deficient 1N1K cells appeared to be enlarged considerably (Fig. 5A) and are designated 1N*1K to be distinguished from the regular 1N1K cells (7Ploubidou A. Robinson D.R. Docherty R.C. Ogbadoyi E.O. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4641-4650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These enlarged nuclei could reflect active DNA synthesis without an accompanied mitosis in the cell cycle. This working hypothesis was verified by the results from another experiment in which BrdUrd incorporation into the DNA of CRK3 knockdown cells was examined in an immunofluorescence assay. The data, presented in Fig. 6, show active BrdUrd incorporation into the enlarged nuclei in a pattern super-imposable with that of the DAPI stain, suggesting that continued DNA synthesis may be the primary cause of nuclear enlargement.

Its physiological targets include the mRNAs encoding the cytokines tumor necrosis factor α (TNF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. TTP was originally identified on the basis of its massive but transient increase in mRNA levels following mitogen stimulation of fibroblasts. It has been difficult to reconcile this transient mRNA profile with the presumed continuing “need” for TTP protein, for example, to reverse the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated TNF secretion. To investigate this and other questions concerning endogenous TTP protein in cells and tissues, we raised a high titer rabbit antiserum against full-length mouse TTP. TTP could be detected on immunoblots of mouse cytosolic tissue extracts; it was most highly expressed in spleen, but its concentration in that tissue was only about 1.5 nm. TTP could be detected readily in splenic macrophages and stromal cells from LPS-injected rats. In both LPS-treated RAW 264.7 macrophages and fetal calf serum-treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts, TTP protein was stable after induction, with minimal degradation occurring for several hours after treatment of the cells with cycloheximide. The biosynthesis of TTP was accompanied by large changes in electrophoretic mobility consistent with progressive phosphorylation. Confocal microscopy revealed that TTP accumulated in a vesicular pattern in the cytosol of the LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells, and was occasionally seen in the cytosol of unstimulated dividing cells. Gel filtration of the endogenous protein suggested that its predominant structure was monomeric. TTP appears to be a low abundance, cytosolic protein in unstimulated cells and tissues, but once induced is relatively stable, in contrast to its very labile mRNA.

In mammals, three members of this family have been characterized: TTP (also known as ZFP36, TIS11, G0S24, and NUP475), ZFP36L1 (also known as TIS11b, cMG1, ERF1, BRF1, and Berg36), and ZFP36L2 (also known as TIS11d, ERF2, and BRF2) (1Blackshear P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 30: 945-952Crossref Google Scholar). Although they are encoded by different genes and their patterns of cell- and tissue-specific expression and agonist-stimulated expression are quite different, they share certain properties: All have highly conserved tandem zinc finger domains, in which each C8xC5xC3xH zinc finger is preceded by the sequence (R/K)YKTEL, and the two fingers are separated by 18 amino acids (2Lai W.S.

In intact animals, TTP deficiency causes a profound inflammatory syndrome with erosive arthritis, autoimmunity, and myeloid hyperplasia, apparently due almost entirely to excessive production of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), both of whose mRNAs are direct targets of TTP and are stabilized in cells from the knockout (KO) mice (7Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 1891-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Taylor G.A.

Immunity. 1996; 4: 445-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). For these reasons, TTP can be thought of as an anti-inflammatory or arthritis-suppressor protein. The cDNAs encoding TTP were originally cloned by three groups by virtue of its very rapid and dramatic transcriptional induction in fibroblasts in response to insulin, phorbol esters, and serum (12DuBois R.N. McLane M.W. Ryder K. Lau L.F. Nathans D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19185-19191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lai W.S. Stumpo D.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol.

In a typical example, TTP mRNA was undetectable in serum-starved, insulin-responsive 3T3-L1 mouse fibroblasts, but the transcript became detectable within 10 min of insulin stimulation, peaked at ∼45 min, and returned to near baseline by 120 min (13Lai W.S. Stumpo D.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16556-16563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These dramatic but transient responses were also seen in cells in which TTP is thought to exert an effect in normal physiology, i.e. in the regulation of TNF mRNA stability in macrophages (7Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, in most cell types there is a mechanism for the rapid transcription of the TTP gene (Zfp36 in the mouse) in response to various agonists, mediated by some well characterized and some relatively un-characterized enhancer elements (15Lai W.S. Thompson M.J. Taylor G.A. Liu Y. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25266-25272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and a mechanism for the rapid turning off of transcription while transcript degradation is occurring, leading quickly to a return to baseline mRNA levels despite the continued presence of agonist (1Blackshear P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 30: 945-952Crossref Google Scholar). This rapid but transient increase in TTP mRNA levels is difficult to reconcile with the presumed continuing requirement for TTP protein in situations in which it might be needed to destabilize TNF mRNA, for example. For these and other reasons, it was important to establish the normal patterns of TTP protein expression in cells and tissues, as well as the protein response patterns in cells such as macrophages in which the protein is thought to play an important physiological role. However, studies of this type have been hampered by the lack of good antibodies to TTP, a deficiency that is partly due to difficulties in expressing the intact protein in soluble form in typical expression systems (6Cao H. Dzineku F. Blackshear P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 412: 106-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we describe the development of a high titer antibody to mouse TTP, and its use in characterizing the normal patterns of TTP expression in mouse tissues and its pattern of induction in cultured cells. Among the interesting findings were that TTP seems to be an extraordinarily low abundance protein in normal mouse tissues; that its levels do not necessarily parallel the steady-state levels of its transcript in these tissues; that it is a very stable cytoplasmic protein once induced, at least in macrophages and fibroblasts; and finally, that it undergoes progressive phosphorylation during biosynthetic induction over a scale of hours. MBP-mTTP Purification and Antibody Production—Maltose binding protein-mouse TTP fusion protein (MBP-mTTP) and MBP were purified as described (6Cao H. Dzineku F. Blackshear P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 412: 106-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and used to produce rabbit antisera according to standard procedures (Covance Research Products, Inc., Denver, PA). The antiserum that contained the highest titer anti-TTP activity was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, sodium azide was added to a final concentration of 0.02% (w/v), and the serum was stored at -70 °C. Preparation of Tissue Extracts—Wild-type (WT) C57B16 mice, and mice deficient in TTP, TTP/TNFα receptor 1 (TNFR1), or TTP/TNFα receptor 2 (TNFR2) (11Taylor G.A. Carballo E. Lee D.M. Lai W.S. Thompson M.J. Patel D.D. Schenkman D.I. Gilkeson G.S. Broxmeyer H.E. Haynes B.F. Blackshear P.J.

Blood. 2001; 98: 2389-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) were maintained in microisolator cages in a barrier facility according to institutional guidelines. Tissues were collected from mice at ∼6 months of age after euthanasia with CO2. The tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen, stored at -70 °C, pulverized with a mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen, and then homogenized with an Overhead Strirrer (Wheaton Instruments, Millville, NJ) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaF, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 2 mm ZnCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μm leupeptin. Supernatants from centrifugations at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C were stored at -70 °C after addition of 20% glycerol (v/v). A cytosolic fraction was separated from a membrane fraction by further centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Cell Culture—Mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) were prepared from 6- to 8-month-old WT and TTP KO mice as described previously (17Carballo E. Gilkeson G.S. Blackshear P.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 986-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), then stimulated with 0.1 or 1 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) for various times. Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were prepared from mouse embryos at embryonic day 14 and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) as described (18Taylor G.A. Thompson M.J. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13341-13347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). They were serum-deprived overnight and then stimulated with 10% FCS for various times. Mouse RAW 264.7 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured as MEF, except in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Invitrogen), and treated with LPS (0.1 μg/ml) for various times. In one experiment, cells were stimulated with LPS for 2.5 h, followed by LPS “washout” as described (19Lidington D. Ouellette Y. Tyml K. J. Cell Physiol. 2000; 185: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In some experiments, 50 μm cycloheximide (CHX) was added to inhibit protein synthesis. Cell Extracts—After washing twice with PBS, cells were gently scraped with a rubber policeman into 5 ml of ice-cold PBS, and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells from each 10-cm dish were then resuspended and lysed in 0.5 ml of a lysis buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm imidazole, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell lysate was left on ice for about 20 min and then centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then centrifuged again at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The 10,000 × g supernatant was mixed with glycerol to a final concentration of 20% (v/v), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -20 °C for future use. The pellet from the 1,000 × g centrifugation was used for the preparation of nuclear extracts as described previously (7Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, nuclear extract was prepared from the pellet by sonication and then centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. To concentrate proteins in the mouse fibroblast extracts, proteins in the 10,000 × g supernatant from 2-4 dishes were precipitated with 25% (v/v) of trichloroacetic acid on ice for 2 h, washed twice with cold acetone, dried with a Speed-Vac (Thermo Electron Corp., Waltham, MA), and dissolved in 40 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.5. Dephosphorylation of mTTP from LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cellular extracts used calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (CIAP) (Stratagene) as described in the legend to Fig. 6D. Size Exclusion Chromatography of TTP from Mouse RAW 264.7 Cells—Proteins in the 10,000 × g supernatant from RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with 0.1 μg/ml LPS for 2 h were precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 50% saturation, followed by separation on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) using a similar procedure to that described previously (20Cao H. James M.G. Myers A.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Proteins were eluted with 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0, and column fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-MBP-mTTP serum. The molecular mass of mTTP was determined by comparing its elution volume to a standard curve generated with protein standards separated on the same column. The protein standards (Amersham Biosciences) used were bovine pancreas ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), bovine pancreas chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa), hen egg ovalbumin (43 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), rabbit muscle aldolase (158 kDa), bovine liver catalase (232 kDa), horse spleen ferritin (440 kDa), and bovine thyroid thyroglobulin (669 kDa). The void volume of the column was determined with blue dextran (2000 kDa). SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard, with NaOH treatment as described (21Cao H. Sullivan T.D. Boyer C.D. Shannon J.C. Physiol. Plant. 1995; 95: 176-186Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE following standard protocols (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Naniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and visualized with either Coomassie Blue (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Naniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or silver staining (23Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7784) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes in transfer buffer containing 0.1% SDS and visualized with Ponceau S staining. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in 0.05% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (TTBS) for 30-60 min and incubated with the primary antiserum at a 1:10,000 dilution in the blocking buffer for 1-18 h. After being washed with TTBS three times for 10 min each, the membranes were incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of secondary antibody in TTBS for 1-6 h. Following three, 10-min washes with TTBS, membranes were incubated with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and exposed to x-ray film. The primary antibodies used were anti-MBP serum (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and the anti-MBP-mTTP antiserum described here and its pre-immune control serum. The secondary antibodies were affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) horseradish peroxidase conjugate with human IgG absorbed (GAR-HRP) (Bio-Rad). Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Microscopy of RAW 264.7 Cells—Mouse RAW 264.7 cells were grown on glass slides or glass coverslips under the conditions described above. Following the addition of LPS (0.1 μg/ml) for various times, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS three times before being fixed at room temperature for 10 min in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cells were again washed with PBS twice and then permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in TBS at room temperature for 10 min. The cells were then incubated at 4 °C overnight in anti-MBP-mTTP serum (1:8 -10,000 dilution) and 1% normal goat serum in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Following two washes with 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100 in TBS, the cells were incubated at room temperature for 30 min in goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (1:300 dilution, Molecular Probes) and 25% normal goat serum in TBS. The cells were rinsed twice with PBS for 10 min each time before being mounted with Prolong anti-fade (Molecular Probes). After drying overnight, the slides were examined and imaged with an LSM510 UV confocal microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Immunostaining of Rat Spleen Sections—We took advantage of the fact that mouse and rat TTP are 96% identical (compare GenBank™ accession numbers NP_035886 and NP_579824) to examine the patterns of immunoreactive TTP expression in rat spleen. Male Sprague-Dawley rats at ∼12 weeks of age were maintained as described (24Bruno M.E. Borchers C.H. Dial J.M. Walker N.J. Hartis J.E. Wetmore B.A. Carl Barrett J.C. Tomer K.B. Merrick B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 406: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and injected intraperitoneally with LPS (5 mg/kg in 5 ml/kg PBS) or the same volume of PBS as a control. 2 h later, spleens were collected, fixed in Bouin's fixative for 48 h, clarified in 70% ethanol, then embedded in paraffin and used for immunohistochemistry essentially as described (25Flores K.G. Li J. Hale L.P. Hum. Pathol. 2001; 32: 926-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The sections were incubated with the anti-MBP-mTTP serum or preimmune serum (1:1000) in PBS containing 1% BSA at 37 °C for 45 min, washed in PBS three times for 5 min each, and incubated with a biotin-labeled anti-rabbit antibody (1:200) (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in PBS containing 1% BSA at 37 °C for 20 min. The sections were washed as above, and the avidin/biotin complex was developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine staining, counterstaining, and dehydration as described (25Flores K.G. Li J. Hale L.P. Hum. Pathol. 2001; 32: 926-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) using the Vectastain ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories). Production and Characterization of Anti-MBP-mTTP Serum—For antigen production, MBP-mTTP was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to near-homogeneity as described (6Cao H. Dzineku F. Blackshear P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 412: 106-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The results of this purification are shown after staining with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 1A) and immunoblotting with an anti-MBP antibody (Fig. 1B). The Mono Q fractions with the highest purity of MBP-mTTP (Fig. 1, lane 6) were pooled, concentrated, and used as antigen. The resulting anti-MBP-mTTP serum at a 1:10,000 dilution was able to detect as little as 1 ng of the purified MBP-mTTP, using the SuperSignal detection reagent and a 5-s exposure of the blot (Fig. 1C). We also tested the antiserum using extracts from 293 cells expressing mouse TTP (3Phillips R.S. Ramos S.B. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11606-11613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 4Murata T. Yoshino Y. Morita N. Kaneda N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 1242-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The antiserum at 1:10,000 dilution was able to detect mouse TTP when as little as 1 μg of total protein from the transfected 293 cells was loaded into the gel (Fig. 1C). This antiserum recognized mouse TTP but not human TTP or mouse Zfp36L1 under these immunoblotting conditions (data not shown). However, it could recognize human TTP when much more protein was used or when the blot was exposed to film for longer times (see below). Identification of TTP in Mouse Cells and Tissues—Using the present antiserum at 1:10,000 dilution, TTP could be detected in Western blots of normal spleen when 5 mg of protein per gel lane and the SuperSignal detection reagent were used (Fig. 2A). TTP in cells and tissues occurs as multiple bands of Mr about 40-50,000, probably a mixture of differentially phosphorylated species and degradation products (1Blackshear P.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 30: 945-952Crossref Google Scholar, 7Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The TTP bands were absent in spleen taken from TTP KO mice (Fig. 2A). As a positive control, we used 2 μg of protein extract from transfected 293 cells (Fig. 2A). The 20,000 × g spleen supernatant was separated into supernatant and pellet fractions by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. TTP was found primarily in the 100,000 × g supernatant, with very little immunoreactivity in the membrane pellet (Fig. 2B). No TTP signal was detected in the 20,000 × g pellet (data not shown). Because purified recombinant MBP-mTTP (10 ng, or 0.134 pmol of the 74.9-kDa fusion protein) was probed on the same blot as the spleen cytosol (1.7 mg of total protein), we used this blot to estimate the approximate concentration of TTP in normal mouse spleen. In these studies, the average spleen weight was 95.2 mg (n = 14), the average soluble protein content per spleen was 16.5 mg/spleen (n = 14), and adult mouse spleen water content was ∼86% (26Zebrowska G. Lewa C.J. Ramee M.P. Husson F. De Certaines J.D. Anticancer Res. 2001; 21: 1213-1217PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, the TTP immunoreactivity in 1.7 mg of spleen extract protein appeared to be about 10% of that of 10 ng (0.134 pmol) of the recombinant protein, or 0.0134 pmol. Therefore, TTP was expressed at ∼0.0134 pmol per 1.7 mg/16.5 mg/spleen, or 0.1265 pmol/spleen. Because average spleen water content was 86% of an average wet weight of 95.2 mg/spleen, the final estimated TTP concentration was 0.1265 pmol/81.87 μl, or about 1.5 nm. Distribution of TTP in Mouse Tissues—The anti-MBP-mTTP serum (1:10,000 dilution) cross-reacted with proteins of the appropriate size in spleen, lung, liver, large intestine, and thymus, and with proteins of different sizes from several other tissues (Fig. 3A). To distinguish between true positive and false positive signals, we analyzed tissues from mice deficient in either TNFR1 and WT for TTP (Fig. 3B) or deficient in both TNFR1 and TTP (Fig. 3C). These genotypes were used, because the absence of the TNFR1 largely prevents the development of the inflammatory TTP-deficiency syndrome, which might have altered the expression of nonspecific bands in the tissues. When compared with tissues from the TTP KO mice (Fig. 3C), true positive TTP signals were seen in spleen, lung, liver, and large intestine (Fig. 3B), whereas nonspecific immunoreactive bands of various sizes were detected in brain, heart, pancreas, and skin from both the TTP WT and KO mice (Fig. 3, compare B and C). These data showed that spleen expressed the highest concentration of TTP of any tissue examined. Induction of TTP in Cultured Cells—To address the specificity of this antiserum in cultured cells, BMM from WT and TTP KO mice were exposed to LPS (1 μg/ml) for 2 h, and proteins from 10,000 × g supernatants were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with the antiserum at a 1:10,000 dilution. The multiple bands of TTP were clearly detected when 200 μg of cellular protein was used per gel lane from the LPS-induced WT BMM, but were not seen in the macrophages from the TTP KO mice (Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained using 500 μg of protein per lane in the 10,000 × g supernatants from WT but not KO MEF, which had been stimulated with 10% FCS for 2 and 3 h (Fig. 4B). As also shown in Fig. 4B, TTP was readily detected in RAW 264.7 cell extracts when only 50 μg of protein was used per lane from the 10,000 × g supernatant of cells stimulated with 0.1 μg/ml LPS. Time Course of Induction and Stability of TTP in Cultured Cells—To investigate the patterns of TTP protein accumulation in cultured cells, BMM were collected following LPS (0.1 μg/ml) stimulation. TTP was undetectable at time 0 but readily detectable after 2 h, reaching a peak of expression at about 4 h (Fig. 5A). Immunoreactive TTP in 500 μg of BMM protein was compared with only 50 μg of protein from RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with LPS for 1.5 and 2 h (Fig. 5A). Similar induction kinetics were seen in MEF stimulated with 10% FCS (Fig. 5B). Again, TTP was undetectable in the serum-deprived cells at time 0, but accumulated dramatically to reach peak levels at ∼2-3 h. These peak levels, detected with 200 μg of cellular protein per lane, were comparable to the levels seen in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells when only 10 μg of protein was loaded into the gel lane (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, there was a continued shift upward in the apparent molecular weight of the protein with still longer times of exposure to FCS (Fig. 5B), compatible with increasing phosphorylation.

https://openalex.org/W2083646752,"HCO3− secretion is a vital activity in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-expressing epithelia. However, the role of CFTR in this activity is not well understood. Simultaneous measurements of membrane potential and pHi and/or current in CFTRexpressing Xenopus oocytes revealed dynamic control of CFTR Cl−/HCO3− permeability ratio, which is regulated by external Cl– (Cl–o). Thus, reducing external Cl– from 110 to 0–10 mm resulted in the expected increase in membrane potential, but with no corresponding OH– or HCO3− influx. Approximately 3–4 min after reducing Clo− to 0 mm, an abrupt switch in membrane potential occurs that coincided with an increased rates of OH– and HCO3− influx. The switch in membrane permeability to OH−/HCO3− can also be recorded as a leftward shift in the reversal potential. Furthermore, an increased rate of OH– influx in response to elevating pHo to 9.0 was observed only after the switch in membrane potential. The time to switch increased to 11 min at Clo− of 5 mm. Conversely, re-addition of external Cl– after the switch in membrane potential did not stop HCO3− influx, which continued for about 3.9 min after Cl– addition. Importantly, addition of external Cl– to cells incubated in Cl–-free medium never resulted in HCO3− efflux. Voltage and current clamp experiments showed that the delayed HCO3− transport is electrogenic. These results indicate that CFTR exists in two conformations, a Cl– only and a Cl– and OH−/HCO3− permeable state. The switch between the states is controlled by external Cl–. Accordingly, a different tryptic pattern of CFTR was found upon digestion in Cl–-containing and Cl–-free media. The physiological significance of these finding is discussed in the context of HCO3− secretion by tissues such as the pancreas and salivary glands.

The physiological significance of these finding is discussed in the context of HCO3− secretion by tissues such as the pancreas and salivary glands. Most epithelia, including the pancreas, salivary glands, bile duct, intestine, uterus, and presumably the airway, secrete fluid rich in HCO3− that can be as high as 140 mm, as found in the pancreatic juice (1Argent B.E.

These tissues express the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) 1The abbreviations used are: CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxantine. protein in the luminal membrane. CFTR plays a critical role in HCO3− secretion, as evident from the absence of HCO3− in the pancreatic juice of patients with cystic fibrosis (5Johansen P.G. Anderson C.M. Hadorn B.

In most tissues, the mechanism of epithelial HCO3− secretion is not well understood, although it seems that the role of CFTR in this activity is tissue-specific. For example, the pancreatic duct (1Argent B.E. Case R.M. Johnson L.R. Textbook of Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 1478-1498Google Scholar), salivary gland duct (2Cook D.I. Van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Young J.A. Johnson L.R. Textbook of Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed.

The luminal Cl−/HCO3− exchangers have been identified as members of the SLC26 family (8Lohi H. Kujala M. Kerkela E. Saarialho-Kere U. Kestila M. Kere J. Genomics. 2000; 70: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 9Makela S. Kere J. Holmberg C. Hoglund P. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 20: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 10Ko S.B.

On the other hand, HCO3− secretion by Calu-3 cells, a cell line that is believed to be a model of airway gland serous cells (11Shen B.Q. Finkbeiner W.E. Wine J.J. Mrsny R.J. Widdicombe J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L493-L501PubMed Google Scholar), is conductive and may be mediated by CFTR itself (12Devor D.C. Singh A.K. Lambert L.C. DeLuca A. Frizzell R.A. Bridges R.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In addition, measurement of Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity in primary cultures of airway epithelia concluded that all the measured activity is by a conductive mechanism that depends on CFTR (13Paradiso A.M. Coakley R.D. Boucher R.C. J. Physiol. 2003; 548: 203-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Similar findings were reported in the intestinal epithelium (14Spiegel S. Phillipper M. Rossmann H. Riederer B. Gregor M. Seidler U. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: G887-G897Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A problem in interpreting these findings arises with the recent discovery that at least some of the SLC26 transporters are electrogenic (10Ko S.B. Shcheynikov N. Choi J.Y. Luo X. Ishibashi K.

Lee M.G. Naruse S. Muallem S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5662-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Furthermore, all SLC26 transporters tested were found to be markedly activated by CFTR, and the activation required stimulation of CFTR with protein kinase A (10Ko S.B. Shcheynikov N. Choi J.Y. Luo X. Ishibashi K. Thomas P.J. Kim J.Y. Kim K.H. Lee M.G. Naruse S. Muallem S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5662-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). These findings raised the possibility that the conductive Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity reported in airway (13Paradiso A.M. Coakley R.D. Boucher R.C. J. Physiol. 2003; 548: 203-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and intestinal epithelia (14Spiegel S. Phillipper M. Rossmann H. Riederer B. Gregor M. Seidler U. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: G887-G897Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) can be mediated by a CFTR-regulated electrogenic SLC26 transporter. Notwithstanding, to better understand epithelial HCO3− secretion and the role of CFTR in this activity, it is necessary to evaluate the ability of CFTR to transport HCO3− and the properties of this transport. There is meager evidence of HCO3− transport by CFTR. The first evidence that CFTR can conduct HCO3− was provided by Gray et al. (16Gray M.A. Pollard C.E. Harris A. Coleman L. Greenwell J.R. Argent B.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: C752-C761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in native pancreatic duct cells, who also later reported that HCO3− can inhibit CFTR Cl– channel activity (17O'Reilly C.M. Winpenny J.P. Argent B.E. Gray M.A. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 1187-1196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), similar to its inhibition by other external anions (18Wright A.M. Argent B.E. Gray M.A. J. Physiol. 2003; 549P: C21Google Scholar). Poulsen et al. (19Poulsen J.H. Fischer H. Illek B. Machen T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5340-5344Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) used cells expressing CFTR to measure CFTR-mediated HCO3− current under internal and external conditions of 0 Cl– and 140 mm HCO3−. In a more detailed work, using bionic gradients, Linsdell et al. (20Linsdell P. Tabcharani J.A. Rommens J.M. Hou Y.X. Chang X.B. Tsui L.C. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) reported a HCO3−/Cl− selectivity of 0.1 for external to internal HCO3− current and a selectivity of 0.25 for internal to external HCO3− current. In both cases, one side of the membrane contained 140 mm Cl–, and the other side contained 140 mm HCO3−. These values are widely cited in discussions of HCO3− transport by CFTR. A unique and an interesting feature of HCO3− conductance of CFTR was reported recently by Reddy and Quinton (21Reddy M.M. Quinton P.M. Nature. 2003; 423: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), in which activation of CFTR by intracellular glutamate activated only Cl– conductance, whereas activation of CFTR by glutamate and ATP led to activation of both Cl– and HCO3− conductance. We reported similar separation between the ability of CFTR mutants associated with cystic fibrosis to mediate Cl– and HCO3− transport (22Choi J.Y. Muallem D. Kisilyov K. Lee M.G. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. Nature. 2001; 410: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). However, it is important to note that the HCO3−/Cl− selectivity of CFTR was never reported under more physiological conditions. In an attempt to better understand the role of CFTR in HCO3− secretion, in the present work we expressed CFTR in Xenopus oocytes and simultaneously measured the CFTR-dependent membrane potential, current, and changes in pHi to report that CFTR can exist in two conformations, a HCO3− impermeant conformation or a HCO3− permeant conformation. The switch between the conformations is slow and is prominently regulated by external Cl–. CFTR, AE1, and cRNA—pcDNA3/CFTR was a gift from Dr. K. Kirk (University of Alabama), and the mouse AE1 construct in the pRBG4 vector was a gift from Dr. R. Kopito (Stanford University). pcDNA3/CFTR was linearized with XhoI. The AE1 insert was transferred to the pXBG-ev1 vector and linearized with NotI. cRNA was transcribed in vitro using a SP6 and T7 PNA polymerase kits (mMessage mMashine SP6 or T7 Kit; Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). cRNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, precipitated with isopropanol, and then dissolved in nuclease-free water. Preparation and Injection of Oocytes—Oocytes were obtained by partial ovariectomy of female Xenopus laevis (Xenopus Express, Beverly Hills, FL) anesthetized with 2.0 g/liter methanesulfonate salt of 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (Sigma). Follicle cells were removed into OR-2 calcium-free medium (82.5 mm NaCl, 2.4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.5) supplemented with 1 mg/ml collagenase B (Roche Applied Science). Defolliculated oocytes were washed four to five times with OR-2 calcium-free medium. Healthy oocytes in stages V to VI were collected and maintained at 18 °C overnight in a standard ND-96 medium (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 5 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.5, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin). Oocytes were injected with cRNA (2.5 ng) in a final volume of 50 nl using a Nanoliter 2000 injector (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL). Oocytes were incubated at 18 °C in ND-96 solution supplemented with pyruvate and antibiotics. The medium was changed every day, and oocytes were used 48–96 h after cRNA injection. Measurement of Membrane Current and Voltage—Electrophysiological recordings were performed at room temperature with two-electrode voltage-clamp or current-clamp methods using an OC-725C Oocyte Clamp System (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT). The microelectrodes were filled with 3 m KCl (resistance, 0.5–2 megaohm(s)). Current was measured at a holding potential of –60 mV. CFTR was activated by 2 μm forskolin (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) and 100 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxantine (IBMX) (Calbiochem). During recording, the oocytes were superfused with ND-96, HCO3−-buffered ND-96, and similar Cl–-free solutions. The HCO3−-buffered solution contained 71 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.4. The Cl–-free and HCO3−-containing solution contained 71 mm Na+-gluconate, 25 mm NaHCO3, 2 mm potassium gluconate, 1.8 mm calcium cyclamate, 1 mm MgSO4, and 5 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.4. Solutions were continually gassed with 5% CO2, 95% O2. Solutions containing 10 and 50 mmHCO3− were prepared by maintaining external Cl– at 71 mm and adding 10 mmHCO3− and 40 mm Na+-gluconate or 50 mmHCO3−, respectively. To prepare butyrate-containing solutions, 40 mm sodium butyrate replaced 40 mm NaCl in ND-96 or 40 mm Na+-gluconate in Cl–-free medium. Current and voltage were digitized via a Digidata 1322A A/D converter (Axon Instrument, Foster City, CA) and analyzed using a Clampex 8.1 system. Intracellular pH Measurement in Oocytes—pHi was measured with single-barreled borosilicate electrodes (outer diameter = 1.2 mm, inner diameter = 0.69 mm; Warner Instrument Corp.). The electrodes were vapor-silanized with bis(dimethylamino)dimethyl silane (Fluka Chemical Corp.) in a closed storage jar (World Precision Instruments, Inc.). Several (usually four) microelectrodes were placed overnight in the storage jar, with their tips pointing upward. When the silanization was completed ∼0.5 μl of proton exchanger resin (hydrogen ionophore I, mixture B; Fluka Chemical Corp.) was introduced into the tip of the microelectrodes by means of a 10-μl microsyringe equipped with a long thin needle (Hamilton, Reno, NV). The electrodes were backfilled with ND-96 solution and calibrated in standard solutions of pH 6, 7, and 8 before and after each experiment. The electrodes were fitted with a holder with an Ag-AgCl wire attached to a high-impedance probe of a two-channel FD-223 electrometer (World Precision Instruments, Inc.). A second channel was used for measurement of membrane potential by a standard microelectrode. The bath was grounded via a 3 m KCl agar bridge connected to an Ag-AgCl wire. The signal from the voltage microelectrode was subtracted from the voltage of the pH electrode using Microcal Origin Version 5.0 software. Initial rates of change in pHi were determined from the slope of the line obtained by fitting pHi versus time to a linear regression line. The slope of the pH electrodes was between 56 and 57 mV (pH unit)–1. Intracellular pH and Current Measurement in Oocytes—For simultaneous pHi and current measurement under voltage clamp conditions, a three-electrode setup was used. Two standard microelectrodes connected to an OC-725C amplifier were used for voltage or current clamp, and one electrode containing the pH resin was attached to a FD-223 electrometer. A common reference electrode was used for both amplifiers. Data were acquired as described above for pHi measurement. CFTR Trypsin Digest—Calu-3 cells in a 100-mm dish were grown to 80% confluence in minimal essential media supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml penicillin and streptomycin and 15% fetal calf serum. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated on ice with 3 ml of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose for 10 min. The cells were scraped off the plate and broken by sonication three times for 10 s. The homogenate was centrifuged at 75,000 × g to collect a crude plasma membrane fraction. The pellets were resuspended in 0.6 ml of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 4 mm Ca2+ cyclamate, and either 150 mm NaCl or 150 mm sodium gluconate. A 100× stock of trypsin (Sigma) was diluted 100-fold into the resuspended membranes and incubated on ice for 10 min. Sample buffer was then added to quench the reaction, and the extracts were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and the membranes were blocked and incubated for 1 h with a mixture of anti-CFTR antibodies to identify as many fragments as possible. The mixture included 1:1000 dilutions of clones M3A7 (Upstate Biotechnology) and 13-1 (R&D Systems) and a 1:1500 dilution of 24-1 (R&D Systems). A 1:10,000 dilution of a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody was used as the secondary antibody, and proteins were visualized with Super Signal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce). Statistical Analysis—Results in all experiments are given as the mean ± S.E. of the indicated number of experiments. The results of multiple experiments were analyzed using analysis of variance or by paired or non-paired Student's t test, as appropriate. OH−/HCO3−Transport by CFTR in Xenopus Oocytes—Several studies reported that CFTR can conduct HCO3− (19Poulsen J.H. Fischer H. Illek B. Machen T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 2003; 423: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and may mediate Cl– absorption and HCO3− secretion in several epithelia (12Devor D.C. Singh A.K. Lambert L.C. DeLuca A. Frizzell R.A. Bridges R.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 13Paradiso A.M. Coakley R.D. Boucher R.C. J.

Physiol. 2003; 285: G887-G897Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is, however, not known whether the HCO3− conductance of CFTR is regulated, and, except for one study (12Devor D.C. Singh A.K. Lambert L.C. DeLuca A. Frizzell R.A. Bridges R.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), the capacity of the HCO3− conductance of CFTR to mediate HCO3− secretion is unknown. To examine the relationship between Cl– and HCO3− transport by CFTR, it is necessary to simultaneously measure membrane potential and/or membrane current and pHi in the presence and absence of HCO3−. Such experiments were possible only in Xenopus oocytes due to their size, which allowed insertion of several pipettes and a suitable temporal resolution of the electrical and pHi signals. Fig. 1, A and B, shows that expression of CFTR and stimulation with forskolin resulted in a current of between 1.5 and 2 μA in various experiments. As we reported previously (10Ko S.B. Shcheynikov N. Choi J.Y. Luo X. Ishibashi K. Thomas P.J. Kim J.Y. Kim K.H. Lee M.G. Naruse S. Muallem S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5662-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), incubating the oocytes in media containing 25 mmHCO3− resulted in partial inhibition of the current (Fig. 1B), an effect that was initially attributed to inhibition of CFTR Cl– current by HCO3− (17O'Reilly C.M. Winpenny J.P. Argent B.E. Gray M.A. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 1187-1196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and later to inhibition by extracellular anions (18Wright A.M. Argent B.E. Gray M.A. J. Physiol. 2003; 549P: C21Google Scholar). Replacing 110 mm external Cl– with 110 mm gluconate resulted in a rapid but transient increase in the inward current that was measured at a holding potential of –60 mV. We reported similar behavior with CFTR expressed in HEK293 cells, in which removal of external Cl– resulted in only a rapid transient increase in inward current (10Ko S.B. Shcheynikov N. Choi J.Y. Luo X. Ishibashi K. Thomas P.J. Kim J.Y. Kim K.H. Lee M.G. Naruse S. Muallem S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5662-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The transient increase in current can be due to partial inhibition of CFTR, an increased permeability to another anion, or both. To address these possibilities, we simultaneously measured the membrane potential and pHi in control oocytes (Fig. 1C) and in oocytes expressing CFTR bathed in HEPES- or HCO3−-buffered media (Fig. 1, D and E). Removal of external Cl– (Cl–o) slightly hyperpolarized control oocytes incubated in HEPES- or HCO3−-buffered media while slightly increasing the rate of pHi increase only in the presence of HCO3− (Fig. 1C). In CFTR-expressing and forskolin-stimulated oocytes, removal of Cl–o resulted in complex membrane potential changes. Thus, removal of Cl–o resulted in a rapid increase in membrane potential, which then declined slowly, probably due to gradual loss of Cl–i. However, after 3–5 min of incubation in Cl–-free media, there was an abrupt and large drop in membrane potential in both HEPES- and HCO3−-buffered media. The abrupt drop in membrane potential coincided with increased rates of OH– and HCO3− influx, as reflected in the commencement of an increase in pHi. Henceforth in this article, the abrupt and large drop in membrane potential will be referred to as the “switch” in membrane potential. To analyze the time to switch, it was defined as the time interval between the removal of Cl–o and the end of the abrupt change in membrane potential. The drop in membrane potential was not due to activation of endogenous Na+ or K+ channels. Removal of external Na+ by replacement with N-methyl-d-glucamine+ hyperpolarized the cells by about 5 mV (n > 15), whereas removal of external K+ had no measurable effect on the membrane potential (n = 3). Removal of either cation had no effect on the membrane potential changes observed upon removal of Cl–o, including a lack of effect on the time that the switch in membrane potential and OH−/HCO3− permeability occurred. In addition, the endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl– channel did not participate in the observed pattern of membrane potential changes. Thus, removal of external Ca2+ with 2 mm EGTA had no effect on resting membrane potential or the changes in membrane potential observed on removal of Cl–o. Moreover, the endogenous, strongly inwardly rectifying, Ca2+-acticated Cl– channel was maximally activated by incubating the oocytes in Ca2+-containing medium and 5 μm ionomycin. Incubating these oocytes in Cl–-free media did not appreciably depolarize the cells and did not reproduce the changes in membrane potential observed with CFTR, due to the strong inward rectification of the channel. Therefore, the large abrupt drop in membrane potential (the switch) is most likely related to the function of CFTR. Importantly, the abrupt switch in membrane potential was observed in all experiments, with no exception (>250). More specifically, CFTR-expressing oocytes in HEPES-buffered media had a resting membrane potential of –31 ± 0.8 mV (n = 53) and a resting pHi of 7.25 ± 0.01 (n = 53). Incubation in Cl–-free medium after stimulation with forskolin resulted in a membrane potential of 63 ± 1.4 mV that then declined slowly. When membrane potential reached 35 ± 0.9 mV (n = 53), an abrupt change in membrane potential occurred that reduced the membrane potential to –10 ± 1.1 mV. The switch happened 4.2 ± 0.21 min (n = 53) after removal of external Cl–. Remarkably, pHi remained nearly stable until the switch in membrane potential. The switch coincided with an increase in the rate pHi increase to 0.015 ± 0.001 pH unit/min (n = 53). Restoration of external Cl– hyperpolarized the oocytes to –67 ± 3 mV and slowly stopped the increase in pHi. It was more difficult to demonstrate a sharp correlation between the switch in membrane potential and increased rate of HCO3− transport due to the endogenous permeability of the oocytes to HCO3− and the basal HCO3− permeability of CFTR. However, the findings in HCO3−-buffered media were similar to those in HEPES-buffered media. Thus, the oocytes had a resting membrane potential of –22 ± 1.2 mV (n = 46). Addition of HCO3− reduced pHi to 6.77 ± 0.02. Incubation in Cl–-free medium after stimulation with forskolin resulted in membrane potential of 49 ± 1.9 mV, which then declined slowly until a potential of 34 ± 0.8 mV (n = 46) was attained, at which point a switch occurred that reduced the membrane potential to –0.7 ± 1.2 mV. The difference in the rates of pHi increase before and after the switch in HCO3−-buffered media was significant. Before the switch, the rate of pHi increase varied between experiments but was slow for several minutes (dashed line in Fig. 1E) and in 46 experiments averaged 0.013 ± 0.004 pH unit/min. As exemplified by the dotted line in Fig. 1E, after the switch, pHi increased at a rate of 0.088 ± 0.003 pH unit/min (n = 46) for a net increase of 0.068 ± 0.005 pH unit/min. Note that restoration of external Cl– hyperpolarized the oocytes and stopped the increase in pHi, but it did not cause a reduction in pHi, as would be expected from reversal of Cl– and HCO3− gradients. The Electrogenic Nature of HCO–3 Transport—The HCO3− transport observed on incubation of CFTR-expressing oocytes in Cl–-free medium can be mediated by CFTR or a Cl−/HCO3− exchanger because CFTR markedly activates the SLC26 transporters (10Ko S.B. Shcheynikov N. Choi J.Y. Luo X. Ishibashi K. Thomas P.J. Kim J.Y. Kim K.H. Lee M.G. Naruse S. Muallem S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5662-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). However, the delay in the pHi increase upon removal of external Cl– and the coincidence of the switch with increased rate of pHi increase were not observed with members of the SLC26A4 and SLC26 Cl−/HCO3− exchangers (see below), which suggested that CFTR itself is responsible for OH−/HCO3− transport. This predicts that net HCO3− transport should be inhibited at membrane potentials more negative than the reversal potential for HCO3−, even when Cl– is completely removed from the medium. At 25 mmHCO3− in the bath and 5.6 mm in the cytosol (pHi 6.77), the reversal potential for HCO3− is –40 mV. Therefore, to test this prediction, we used a three-electrode system and clamped the membrane potential at –80 mV while recording pHi. Fig. 2A shows that clamping the membrane potential at –80 mV completely prevented the pHi increase due to removal of external Cl–. Moreover, release of the clamp resulted in a membrane potential of 28 ± 3 mV (n = 6) and an immediate increase in pHi at a rate of 0.087 ± 0.007 pH unit/min (n = 6). This indicates that the selectivity switch must have occurred during the incubation in Cl–-free medium to allow the immediate increase in pHi and that HCO3− transport is purely electrogenic. A constant observation in all experiments (n = 46) is that re-addition of Cl– to oocytes incubated in HCO3−-buffered, Cl–-free media failed to reduce pHi, although the membrane potential always hyperpolarized, indicating that CFTR was fully active. The most likely explanation for this observation is that under these conditions, CFTR is no longer permeable to HCO3−. This was examined directly in Fig. 2B. The oocytes were incubated in Cl–-free medium and allowed to increase pHi to 7.47 ± 0.04 (n = 4). Addition of external Cl– hyperpolarized the membrane potential to –73 ± 6 mV, but pHi remained stable. Clamping the membrane potential at –100 mV to force HCO3− out of the oocytes or at 20 mV to force Cl– into the oocytes failed to induce significant HCO3− efflux and reduce pHi. Therefore, in the presence of 110 mm external Cl–, CFTR is not permeable to HCO3− and is highly selective for Cl–. Time Course of Increased Base Permeability—The delay in OH−/HCO3− influx may reflect slow response of the pH electrode when inserted into the oocytes or the low pHi in the HCO3−-buffered media. To exclude these possibilities, we tested the effect of acidification by butyrate and measured changes in pHi in oocytes expressing"

The current study has elucidated just such a pathway for GrB-mediated mitochondrial apoptotic alterations. Two Bcl-2 family members have been identified as interactive players in this newly discovered mitochondrial response to GrB: the pro-survival protein Mcl-1L and the pro-apoptotic protein, Bim. Expression of Mcl-1L, which localizes mainly to the outer mitochondrial membrane, decreases significantly in cells subjected to CTL-free cytotoxicity mediated by a combination of GrB and replication-deficient adenovirus. The data suggest that Mcl-1L is a substrate for GrB and for caspase-3, but the two enzymes appear to target different cleavage sites. The cleavage pattern of endogenous Mcl-1L resembles that of in vitro translated Mcl-1L subjected to similar proteolytic activity. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments performed with endogenous as well as with in vitro translated proteins suggest that Mcl-1L is a high affinity binding partner of the three isoforms of Bim (extra-long, long, and short). Bim, a BH3-only protein, is capable of mediating the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, and this activity is inhibited by the presence of exogenous Mcl-1L. The findings presented herein imply that Mcl-1L degradation by either GrB or caspase-3 interferes with Bim sequestration by Mcl-1L.

Bleackley R.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 401-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GrB has been reported to cleave caspases, including caspase-3, -6, -7, -8, and -10 in vitro. It has been assumed that GrB has multiple entry points for initiating the caspase-dependent apoptotic cascade. However, GrB also activates cell death and apoptotic morphology in the presence of short peptide fluoromethyl ketones, which are potent caspase inhibitors, but do not inactivate GrB (2Lieberman J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). These observations led to the notion that GrB may be capable of initiating an alternate death pathway in the presence of viral or cellular inhibitors of caspases. This concept is supported by the identification of caspase substrates that are also processed by GrB, including the sensor for initiation of DNA damage repair, poly-(ADP)ribose polymerase (3Froelich C.J.

Goping I.S. Bleackley R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Recent studies have identified Bid as a direct substrate for GrB, and thereby as a direct link to a mitochondrial apoptotic cascade mediated by GrB (9Sutton V.R. Davis J.E. Cancilla M. Johnstone R.W.

Med. 2000; 192: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Bid, a cytosolic BH3-only Bcl-2 family member, is cleaved by caspase-8, lysosomal proteases, or GrB. Although cleaved at different sites, each of the resultant truncated Bids translocates to the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it triggers the release of the pro-apoptotic proteins cytochrome c, SMAC/DIABLO, HtrA2/Omi, endonuclease G, and AIF (12Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although in a cell-free system GrB-cleaved Bid is a potent inducer for the release of mitochondrial apoptotic proteins, a recent study questions whether cleavage of Bid by GrB occurs directly and independently of caspase activation under physiologic conditions (13Metkar S.S. Wang B. Ebbs M.L. Kim J.H. Lee Y.J. Raja S.M. Froelich C.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 14Froelich C.J. Metkar S.S. Raja S.M. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 369-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Despite this controversy regarding the direct role of GrB-cleaved Bid, the need for the mitochondrial amplification of the caspase pathway in GrB-mediated apoptosis is well established, particularly in tumor or viral infected target cells with increased expression of cellular or viral inhibitors of apoptosis (1Barry M. Bleackley R.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 401-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lieberman J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 8Roberts D.L.

Cellular inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP), such as XIAP or cIAP1/2 that are overexpressed in numerous types of tumors (15Tamm I. Kornblau S.M. Segall H. Krajewski S. Welsh K. Kitada S. Scudiero D.A.

Consequently, mitochondrial secreted antagonists of IAP, SMAC/DIABLO and HtrA2/Omi, are required to relieve the inhibited caspases (17Hegde R. Srinivasula S.M. Zhang Z. Wassell R. Mukattash R.

Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3317) Google Scholar) and can be inhibited by overexpression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (21Cheng E.H. Wei M.C. Weiler S. Flavell R.A. Mak T.W. Lindsten T. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 705-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar). Although a role for GrB-cleaved Bid in the physiologic induction of a mitochondrial apoptotic cascade is controversial, it has been documented that a deficiency in both Bax and Bak attenuates the mitochondrial response to GrB (13Metkar S.S. Wang B. Ebbs M.L. Kim J.H. Lee Y.J. Raja S.M. Froelich C.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 22Wang G.-Q. Wieckowski E. Goldstein L.A. Gastman B.R.

Furthermore, embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from Bid–/– mice or Bax/Bak double knockout mice still have disrupted mitochondrial transmembrane potential in response to GrB (23Thomas D.A. Scorrano L. Putcha G.V. Korsmeyer S.J. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14985-14990Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These findings imply that one or more cytosolic mediators other than Bid may act as a link between GrB and the mitochondria. Alternatively, GrB may act directly on mitochondrial outer membrane proteins providing an explanation for the ability of GrB to disrupt the mitochondrial transmembrane potential in a caspase- and Bid-independent manner (10Alimonti J.B.

Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).Mitochondrial response to apoptotic stimuli is determined by the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, including Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1L (myeloid cell leukemia-1) protect against mitochondrial apoptotic events, whereas pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, including Bax, Bak, and BH3-only proteins, promote the release of apoptogenic proteins from the mitochondria. Mcl-1 is an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein that was discovered as an early induction gene during myeloblastic leukemic cell differentiation (24Kozopas K.M. Yang T. Buchan H.L. Zhou P. Craig R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). The biological significance of Mcl-1 has been elucidated by recent studies demonstrating that a Mcl-1 deficiency results in peri-implantation embryonic lethality (25Rinkenberger J.L. Horning S. Klocke B. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 23-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increased expression of endogenous full-length Mcl-1 is associated with the maintenance of cell viability and decreased expression with cell death (24Kozopas K.M. Yang T. Buchan H.L. Zhou P.

A short splice variant of Mcl-1, Mcl-1S, has recently been identified as a BH3 domain only pro-apoptotic protein (28Bae J. Leo C.P. Hsu S.Y. Hsueh A.J. J. Biol.

Despite numerous studies on the induction of Mcl-1, scarce information is available regarding the mechanisms involved in its down-regulation. Based on the effects of proteasome inhibitors, two recent studies proposed that Mcl-1L is degraded by proteasomes in response to UV or actinomycin D, in HeLa or multiple myeloma cell lines, respectively (30Zhang B. Gojo I. Fenton R.G. Blood. 2002; 99: 1885-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 31Nijhawan D. Fang M. Traer E. Zhong Q. Gao W. Du F. Wang X. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1475-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar).Our studies, described below, are the first to report that Mcl-1L is a direct substrate for caspase-3 and GrB. We have also identified Bim, a BH3-only protein, as a high affinity binding partner for Mcl-1. The Mcl-1L/Bim cooperation may constitute an alternative mitochondrial apoptotic pathway that could be activated by the direct effect of GrB on the mitochondria, independent of Bid.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Anti-human Mcl-1 Abs were from Oncogene (Boston, MA; Ab-2, mouse clone RC13 generated against recombinant Mcl-1L), and from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA; Ab-1, mAb generated against recombinant Mcl-1L; and Ab-3, polyclonal Ab generated against 20-amino acid residue synthetic peptide of human Mcl-1L). Anti-β-actin mAb (clone AC-15) was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO); anti-cytochrome c oxidase IV (Cox IV) Ab was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); rabbit anti-Bid Ab was a generous gift from Dr. Xiaodong Wang (Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Anti-caspase-3, caspase-8, cytochrome c, and XIAP were from BD Pharmingen; anti-Bim Ab were from ProSci (Poway, CA) and from Apoptech (San Diego, CA, clone 14A8); anti-SMAC mAb from Apoptech (clone 10G7); anti-AIF, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Z-VAD-Fmk and Ac-IETD-CHO were from ICN (Aurora, OH). [35S]Methionine, Protein A-Sepharose beads, and Protein G-Sepharose beads were from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ).Cell Lines, Cell Lysates, and Cell Extracts—Jurkat T leukemic cell line and the HeLa tumor cell line were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. The Bak-deficient Jurkat clonal cell line was obtained from wild-type Jurkat cells (22Wang G.-Q. Wieckowski E. Goldstein L.A. Gastman B.R. Rabinovitz A. Gambotto A. Li S. Fang B. Yin X.-M. Rabinowich H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1325-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15% fetal calf serum, 20 mm l-glutamine, and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. Cell lysates were prepared with 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris base, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Cellular lysates were obtained as the supernatants resulting from centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. To prepare cell extracts for GrB or caspase-3 reactions, cultured Jurkat cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in ice-cold buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1mm sodium EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose, and protease inhibitors). After incubation on ice for 20 min, cells (2.5 × 106/0.5 ml) were disrupted by Dounce homogenization. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 650 × g for 10 min at 4 °C.Molecular Cloning of Mcl-1L—Total RNA was isolated from HeLa cells using RNA STAT-60 Reagent (Tel-Test “B”, Inc.). Reverse transcription was carried out with 5 μg of total RNA using the oligonucleotide primer Mcl-R, 5′-TACAGCTTGGAGTCCAACTGC-3′, which is complementary to nucleotides (nt) 1779–1799 in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of the Mcl-1L mRNA sequence and SuperScript III RNase H– reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR was performed using the GC-Rich PCR System kit (Roche Applied Science). Amplicons containing the entire open reading frame (ORF) of Mcl-1L were generated using the forward primer Mcl-F, 5′-CTGGCAATGTTTGGCCTCAAA-3′, which corresponds to nt 658–678 and thus extends by 6 nt into the 5′-UTR and the reverse primer Mcl-R (see above). The Mcl-1L amplicon was size-selected and purified using a 1% agarose gel and the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Amplicons were subcloned into the vector pCR3.1 by utilizing the Eukaryotic TA Expression kit (Invitrogen). Mcl-1L clones were confirmed by automated DNA sequence analysis (University of Pittsburgh DNA Sequencing Core Facility) of randomly picked colonies.Generation of Mcl-1S—We produced a Mcl-1S splice variant cDNA clone based on the published sequence (GenBank™ accession number AF203373) utilizing deletion mutagenesis of Mcl-1L cDNA by overlap extension using PCR. To generate the deletion site, two primers were designed as follows: the forward primer Mcl-10, 5′-GGCCTTCCAAGGATGGGTTTGTGGAGTTCTTCC-3′, which corresponds to nt 1340–1352 and 1601–1621, and the reverse primer Mcl-11, 5′-CCACAAACCCATCCTTGGAAGGCCGTCTCGTGG-3′, which is complementary to nt 1612–1601 and 1352–1331. These primers overlap the sequence region (nt 1353–1600) that is deleted from Mcl-1L to generate the Mcl-1S variant. PCR was carried out with Mcl-1L cDNA and primer pairs Mcl-F (see above) and Mcl-11 and Mcl-R (see above) and Mcl-10, respectively, using the Expand Long Template PCR system (Roche Applied Science). The deletion mutant amplicons (0.5 μl of each) were combined in a subsequent PCR reaction using primers Mcl-F and Mcl-R to produce the putative Mcl-1S amplicon. This amplicon was then gel-purified and subcloned as above for Mcl-1L. Sequence analysis (as above) of randomly picked clones confirmed the Mcl-1S sequence.Molecular Cloning of Human BimEL—Total RNA was isolated from Jurkat T cells as described for Mcl-1L. First strand cDNA synthesis was carried out using SuperScript II RNase H– reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT)12–18 primer (Invitrogen). PCR was performed with the Expand Long Template PCR system (Roche Applied Science) and a forward and reverse primer pair specific for the amino and carboxyl-terminal ends, respectively, of BimEL, BimL, and BimS ORFs. The sequence of the forward Bim primer is 5′-GCCACCATGGCAAAGCAACCTTCTGAT-3′, whereas the reverse primer is 5′-TCAATGCATTCTCCACACCAG-3′. Reaction products were separated on a 1% agarose gel, and a band corresponding in size (∼600 bp) to the BimEL ORF was excised and DNA extracted as described for Mcl-1L. The putative BimEL amplicon was subcloned into the vector pCR3.1 as above. Random clones were sequenced also as above to confirm the presence of the BimEL ORF.Preparation of His-tagged BimL—Mouse amino-terminal histidine-tagged BimL was expressed from a recombinant plasmid produced by ligating an NdeI-XhoI-digested BimL amplicon produced with the Expand Long Template PCR system kit (Roche Applied Science) utilizing mouse BimL cDNA and the primers BimL-F, 5′-GGAATTCCATATGGCCAAGCAACCTTCT-3′, and BimL-R, 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAATGCCTTCTCCATACCAG-3′, into the NdeI-XhoI-digested bacterial expression vector pET-14b (Novagen). Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) cells were transformed and cultured at 37 °C in Terrific Broth. The induction of expression was started at an A600 of 0.8–1.0 by the addition of 0.4 mm, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside with continued incubation of the culture at 37 °C for 2–3 h. The bacterial pellets were resuspended and sonicated in a buffer containing 5 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9. After centrifugation, the cleared supernatants were passed through a His-Bind nickel agarose affinity chromatographic column pre-charged with 50 mm NiSO4 (Novagen). The columns were washed with wash buffer containing 60 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9. His-tagged Bim was eluted with elution buffer containing 400 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, and were further purified using a Sephadex G-50 column equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline. A single major band was detected by SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue.GrB-induced Apoptosis—CTL-free apoptosis was induced by incubation of target cells with GrB (33–330 nm) and replication-deficient adenovirus type V (Ad; 10–100 pfu/ml) for 6 h. The cells were then washed to remove excess exogenous GrB. To avoid the enzymatic activity of GrB during the lysis procedure, the GrB inhibitor, Ac-IETD-CHO (500 μm) was added to the lysis buffer.Cellular Fractionation and Mitochondria Purification—To obtain an enriched mitochondrial fraction, Jurkat or HeLa cells were suspended in mitochondrial buffer (MIB) composed of 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA, and 4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, and lysed by Dounce homogenization as previously described (32Petit P.X. O'Connor J.E. Grunwald D. Brown S.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 33Matsko C.M. Hunter O.C. Rabinowich H. Lotze M.T. Amoscato A.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 1112-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei and debris were removed by a 10-min centrifugation at 650 × g, and a pellet containing mitochondria was obtained by two successive spins at 10,000 × g for 12 min. To obtain the S-100 fraction, the postnuclear supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. To obtain the enriched mitochondrial fraction, the mitochondria containing pellet was resuspended in MIB and layered on a Percoll gradient consisting of four layers of 10, 18, 30, and 70% Percoll in MIB. After centrifugation for 30 min at 15,000 × g, the mitochondrial fraction was collected at the 30/70 interface. Mitochondria were diluted in MIB containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (at least a 10-fold dilution required to remove Percoll). The mitochondrial pellet was obtained by a 40-min spin at 20,000 × g and used immediately. Purity was assessed by electron microscopy and by enzyme marker analysis (33Matsko C.M. Hunter O.C. Rabinowich H. Lotze M.T. Amoscato A.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 1112-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For enzyme analysis, the following enzymes were assayed: aryl sulfatase (lysosomes/granules); N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase, α-l-fucosidase, and β-glucuronidase (lysosome); lactate dehydrogenase (cytosol); cytochrome oxidase or monoamine oxidase (mitochondria); thiamine pyrophosphatase (Golgi); NADH oxidase (endoplasmic reticulum); and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (plasma membrane). The purity was assessed at 95%, with ∼5% or less contamination from the microsomal fraction. When indicated, mitochondria were pelleted then incubated in 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.5, for 20 min on ice to remove loosely attached proteins (34Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). The alkali treatment was not associated with the release of mitochondrial intermembrane proteins, such as SMAC or AIF. Following alkali treatment, supernatants and mitoplasts were separated by centrifugation and boiled in SDS sample buffer. The fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting.Release of Mitochondrial Apoptogenic Proteins—Purified mitochondria (50 μg of protein) were incubated with His-BimL at various doses as indicated, in 25 μl of MIB at 37 °C for 30 min. Mitochondria were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatants or mitochondria were mixed with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting for the presence of mitochondrial apoptogenic proteins.In Vitro Transcription-Translation—Mcl-1L, Mcl-1S, and BimEL cDNAs were expressed in the TnT T7 transcription-translation reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Each coupled transcription-translation reaction contained 1 μg of plasmid DNA in a final volume of 50 μl in a methionine-free reticulocyte lysate reaction mixture supplemented with 35S-labeled methionine according to the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation at 30 °C for 90 min, the reaction products were immediately used or stored at –70 °C.In Vitro Cleavage Reaction with Caspase-3 or GrB—In vitro cleavage reactions were performed in total volume of 20 μl. The reaction buffer consisted of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Each reaction also contained 3 μl of reticulocyte lysate containing 35S-labeled Mcl-1L, Mcl-1S, or BimEL and reticulocyte lysate minus plasmid in the presence or the absence of recombinant caspase-3 (5–100 nm) or GrB (33–330 nm) for 20 min at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated by addition of SDS loading buffer and boiled for 5 min.Immunoprecipitation—For Mcl-1 and Bim immunoprecipitation experiments cells (5–10 × 106) and mitochondria (200 μg of protein) were lysed in 1% CHAPS buffer (20 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 1% CHAPS). The lysates were precleared with Protein A- or G-Sepharose beads and incubated with anti-Mcl-1 or anti-Bim Abs at 4 °C for 4 h. The immune complexes were then precipitated with Protein A- or G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C overnight. The pellets were washed four times with the appropriate lysis buffer and boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer.Western Blot Analysis—Proteins in cell lysates, cell extracts, mitochondria, or S-100 were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, as previously described (35Johnson D.E. Gastman B.R. Wieckowski E. Wang G.Q. Amoscato A. Delach S.M. Rabinowich H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1818-1823PubMed Google Scholar). Following probing with a specific primary Ab and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab, the protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce, Rockford, IL).RESULTSBid-dependent and Bid-independent Mechanisms of Mitochondrial Release of Apoptogenic Proteins in Response to Direct Application of GrB—GrB has been reported to have a direct effect on mitochondria that results in the release of cytochrome c (10Alimonti J.B. Shi L. Baijal P.K. Greenberg A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6974-6982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Such GrB dose-dependent release of apoptogenic proteins, including, cytochrome c, SMAC, and AIF (Fig. 1A) may be mediated by full-length Bid that in addition to its cytoplasmic localization, is also associated with purified mitochondria. However, full-length Bid is loosely attached to purified mitochondria, because it is entirely removed by treatment with alkali, and therefore it is probably not anchored to the mitochondrial outer membrane (Fig. 1B). Exposure of purified mitochondria to GrB results in the processing of mitochondria-associated Bid as indicated by its reduced level of detection (Fig. 1C). To investigate the significance of mitochondria-attached full-length Bid in the response to direct application of GrB, we utilized liver mitochondria purified from Bid–/– mice. Direct application of various doses of GrB (33–330 nm) to murine wild-type liver mitochondria resulted in a significant release of cytochrome c (Fig. 1D). We confirmed that some full-"
https://openalex.org/W2036243096,"Nore1, a noncatalytic protein identified by its ability to bind selectively to active Ras, is most closely related in amino-acid sequence to the tumor suppressor RASSF1. Both are expressed predominantly as a longer (Nore1A/RASSF1A) and/or shorter (Nore1B/RASSF1C) polypeptide; all four polypeptides contain a Ras-association domain and bind, through their conserved carboxytermini, the proapoptotic protein kinases MST1 and MST2. Moreover, the expression of the longer polypeptide is downregulated in human tumor cell lines through promoter methylation (frequently for RASSF1A, less regularly for Nore1A). Forced expression of RASSF1A in several such lines (including the NSCLC line A549) has been shown to suppress tumorigenicity; herein we inquire whether Nore has growth inhibitory activity. Four tumor cell lines were tested, selected for their low expression of both Nore1A and Nore1B; the two NSCLC lines, A549 and NCI-H460, each have a mutant active Ras oncogene, whereas the two melanoma lines G361 and M14 each contain the constitutively active BRaf(V599E) oncogene and wild-type Ras. The expression of Nore1A or Nore1B suppresses colony formation by the A549 and G361 lines, as effectively in A549 as does RASSF1A; colony formation in the NCI-H460 and M14 lines is unaffected. Nore1A inhibits anchorage-independent growth by A549 cells and delays A549 progression through G1 without evidence of increased apoptosis. The growth suppressive action of Nore1A is largely unaffected by deletion of both the MST- and Ras-binding domains, as well as by mutation of the Nore1A zinc finger. Thus, Nore1 suppresses the growth of some tumor cell lines through as yet unidentified effectors, independent of Ras-like proteins or MST1/2."
https://openalex.org/W2144306209,"The sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway generates bioactive molecules crucial to the regulation of mammalian and fungal physiological and pathobiological processes. In previous studies (Luberto, C., Toffaletti, D. L., Wills, E. A., Tucker, S. C., Casadevall, A., Perfect, J. R., Hannun, Y. A., and Del Poeta, M. (2001) Genes Dev. 15, 201–212), we demonstrated that an enzyme of the fungal sphingolipid pathway, Ipc1 (inositol-phosphorylceramide synthase-1), regulates melanin, a pigment required for the pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans to cause disease. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which Ipc1 regulates melanin production. Because Ipc1 also catalyzes the production of diacylglycerol (DAG), a physiological activator of the classical and novel isoforms of mammalian protein kinase C (PKC), and because it has been suggested that PKC is required for melanogenesis in mammalian cells, we investigated whether Ipc1 regulates melanin in C. neoformans through the production of DAG and the subsequent activation of Pkc1, the fungal homolog of mammalian PKC. The results show that modulation of Ipc1 regulates the levels of DAG in C. neoformans cells. Next, we demonstrated that C. neoformans Pkc1 is a DAG-activated serine/threonine kinase and that the C1 domain of Pkc1 is necessary for this activation. Finally, through both pharmacological and genetic approaches, we found that inhibition of Pkc1 abolishes melanin formation in C. neoformans. This study identifies a novel signaling pathway in which C. neoformans Ipc1 plays a key role in the activation of Pkc1 through the formation of DAG.

The eukaryotic sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway generates lipids that have important roles in cell signaling in addition to their structural function in cell membranes. Mammalian ceramide and sphingosine 1-phosphate regulate many key cellular processes such as the stress response, proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis (1Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Argraves K.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4893-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). More recently, fungal sphingolipids have been implicated in the heat stress response (2Patton J.L. Srinivasan B.

Interestingly, both mammalian and fungal sphingolipid pathways also generate diacylglycerol (DAG). 1The abbreviations used are: DAG, diacylglycerol; PKC, protein kinase C; l-DOPA, l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine. DAG is a glycerolipid that is well known for its function as a second messenger and activator of mammalian classical and novel protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. Sphingolipid enzymes that catalyze the formation of DAG include sphingomyelin synthase in mammalian systems (7Ullman M.D. Radin N.S. J. Biol.

Sphingomyelin synthase and Ipc1 transfer a phosphate head group from phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylinositol to ceramide or phytoceramide, respectively. Whether the DAG generated by these sphingolipid-metabolizing enzymes regulates cellular processes is, in fact, not known. In mammalian cells, the activation of sphingomyelin synthase correlates with activation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB (15Luberto C. Yoo D.S. Suidan H.S. Bartoli G.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Cryptococcus neoformans is a pathogenic fungus that infects mainly immunocompromised patients, and it represents the leading cause of fungal meningoencephalitis worldwide (22Casadevall A. Perfect J.R. Cryptococcus neoformans. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1998Crossref Google Scholar). In previous studies, we showed that Ipc1 regulates melanin production through the modulation of laccase (23Luberto C. Toffaletti D.L. Wills E.A. Tucker S.C. Casadevall A. Perfect J.R. Hannun Y.A. Del Poeta M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), the enzyme that, in C. neoformans, oxidizes exogenous diphenolic substrates (e.g. catecholamines) to form melanin (24Williamson P.R.

Biol. 1999; 19: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and melanin-deficient mutants of the fungus are indeed avirulent in animal models of cryptococcosis (27Kwon-Chung K.J. Polacheck I. Popkin T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 150: 1414-1421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been suggested that melanogenesis by mammalian cells is dependent on the activation of PKC by DAG. Initial reports in mammalian melanocytes showed that DAG increases melanin pigmentation in a PKC-dependent manner (28Gordon P.R. Gilchrest B.A. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1989; 93: 700-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar); and more recently, it was demonstrated that PKCβ, an isoform that is activated by DAG, regulates melanin production in mammalian cells (29Park H.Y. Russakovsky V. Ohno S. Gilchrest B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11742-11749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the generation of DAG by Ipc1 raises the intriguing hypothesis that Ipc1 regulates melanin production in C. neoformans through the formation of DAG and the consequent activation of Pkc1. Here, we found that modulation of Ipc1 expression regulates the formation of DAG in C. neoformans. Next, we demonstrated that DAG activates C. neoformans Pkc1 and that deletion of a conserved DAG-binding domain abrogates the activation of Pkc1 by DAG. Finally, inhibiting Pkc1 by both pharmacological and genetic approaches inhibits melanin production, thereby establishing a crucial role for Pkc1 in the activation of this virulence factor required for development of infection by C. neoformans. Strains, Growth Media, and Reagents—C. neoformans var. grubii serotype A strain H99 (wild type), C. neoformans strain GAL7::IPC1, and S. cerevisiae strain JK9-3dα (MAT trp1 leu2-3 his4 ura3 ade2 rme1) were used in this study. The GAL7::IPC1 strain was created from M001, an ade2 isogenic strain derivative of H99, as described previously (23Luberto C. Toffaletti D.L. Wills E.A. Tucker S.C. Casadevall A. Perfect J.R. Hannun Y.A. Del Poeta M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The C. neoformans H99 and GAL7::IPC1 strains were routinely grown in yeast extract/peptone/dextrose (YPD) medium. Yeast extract/peptone (YP) medium supplemented with 2% galactose or with 2% glucose or raffinose was used for up- and down-regulation of IPC1 expression, respectively. S. cerevisiae strain JK9-3dα was grown routinely in synthetic medium consisting of 6.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base (YNB) without amino acids, amino acid mixture lacking uracil (ura-; 0.1 g/liter leucine, 0.4 g/liter serine, 0.2 g/liter threonine, 0.15 g/liter valine, 0.1 g/liter glutamic acid, 0.1 g/liter aspartic acid, 50 mg/liter phenylalanine, 30 mg/liter tyrosine, 30 mg/liter lysine, 30 mg/liter isoleucine, 20 mg/liter tryptophan, 20 mg/liter histidine, 20 mg/liter arginine, 20 mg/liter methionine, and 0.2 g/liter adenine), 20 g/liter glucose, and 20 g/liter agar. YNB ura- medium supplemented with 2% galactose or 2% glucose was used to induce or repress transcription by the GAL1 promoter, respectively. To assess melanin production, l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) agar was prepared as described previously (30Kwon-Chung K.J. Bennett J.E. Medical Mycology. Lea & Febiger, Malvern, PA1992: 821-822Google Scholar), except that the plates contained either 0.1% galactose or 2% raffinose to up- and down-regulate IPC1 expression, respectively. Cells from fresh YPD plates were resuspended in a small volume of sterile distilled deionized water, spotted onto l-DOPA agar, and incubated overnight at 30 °C. All chemical reagents were obtained from Sigma, unless otherwise noted. DAG Kinase Assay—A total of 108 cells were collected from cultures of the C. neoformans wild-type H99 and GAL7::IPC1 strains. Neutral lipids were extracted from the cell pellets as described by Bligh and Dyer (31Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) and dried down. Three-fourths of each sample were used for lipid measurement, whereas one-fourth was used for inorganic phosphate measurement. Briefly, the lipids were incubated at room temperature for 45 min in the presence of 7.5% β-octyl glucoside and 25 mm dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol micelles, 2 mm ATP (mixed with [γ-32P]ATP), and a membrane preparation of Escherichia coli overexpressing DAG kinase (6 μg) in a final volume of 100 μl. After the lipids were extracted by the Bligh and Dyer method, the reaction products were separated by TLC in chloroform/methanol/acetone/acetic acid/H2O (50:20:15:10:5), and the radioactivity associated with the phosphatidic acid and phosphorylated ceramides was measured by scintillation counting. Ceramide and DAG levels were quantitated using external standards and were normalized to phosphate as described previously (32Bielawska A. Perry D.K. Hannun Y.A. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 33Perry D.K. Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 22-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isolation of the C. neoformans PKC1 Gene—The C. neoformans PKC1 gene was first identified by blasting the S. cerevisiae homolog in the C. neoformans Genome Project Database of var. neoformans serotype D strain JEC21. 2Available at www-Sequence.Stanford.edu/group/C.neoformans. Three sequences (502511B03.x1, 502488F12.x1, and 502342F06.x1) showed very high homology to the S. cerevisiae PKC1 gene and corresponded to the 3′-region of the gene containing the serine/threonine kinase domain, which is highly conserved among all fungal and human homologs. These sequences were used to design the following primers to amplify a 1589-bp fragment of the PKC1 gene from cDNA of C. neoformans var. grubii serotype A strain H99: PKC-antisense-5 (5′-GAT GAA TTC ATA GAA TCC CTC ACA GAT TCA CTC-3′) and PKC-antisense-3 (5′-GTA CTC GAG CTA GTG TCA GTA GCA TTA CCG ATC-3′), which contain EcoRI and XhoI sites (boldface and underlined), respectively. The DNA fragment was then used to screen both a genomic DNA library of C. neoformans var. grubii serotype A strain H99 and a cDNA library of C. neoformans var. neoformans serotype D strain B3501 to isolate, clone, and sequence the PKC1 gene (GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession numbers AY373758 and AY373759). Expression of Recombinant Pkc1, App1, and ΔC1-Pkc1 Proteins—To produce the recombinant Pkc1 protein, the cDNA of PKC1 from serotype D was amplified using primers XO-SeroD (5′-CTA TCT CGA GGG CAT CCA ATG ATC CCA AGG CCA AG-3′) and SeroD-H3 (5′-GAT TAA GCT TCT AGG TCT GTG CTG CAG CCC AAG GAG-3′9), which contain XhoI and HindIII sites (boldface and underlined), respectively. The PCR fragment was digested with XhoI and HindIII and cloned into the pBAD/HisB vector (Invitrogen), placing it in-frame downstream of the ATG start codon and the His and Xpress sequence tags. The resulting plasmid was digested with NcoI and HindIII, yielding a fragment containing the ATG start codon, the His and Xpress tags, and PKC1 cDNA sequence. The fragment was blunted and subcloned into HindIII-digested and blunted vector pYES2 (Invitrogen) downstream of the GAL1 promoter, yielding the pYES2/GAL1::Xpress::PKC1 plasmid. To produce the recombinant App1 (antiphagocytic protein-1) protein, the APP1 cDNA was subcloned from the pBAD/His-App1 vector (34Luberto C. Martinez-Marino B. Taraskiewicz D. Bolanos B. Chitano P.

To create the ΔC1-Pkc1 mutant protein, the pYES2/GAL1::Xpress:: PKC1 vector was first digested with SalI and BglII to remove a 1593-bp fragment spanning the sequence corresponding to the C1 domain in Pkc1. Next, a 1547-bp DNA fragment downstream of the C1 sequence was amplified by PCR using pYES2/GAL1::Xpress::PKC1 as a template and primers SL1-SeroD (5′-CGA CGT CGA CTG GAG ATG GCC AAT TTA CTG CTC-3′, which contains a SalI site (boldface and underlined)) and SeroD-H3 (5′-GAT TAA GCT TCT AGG TCT GTG CTG CAG CCC AAG GAG-3′). The resulting PCR fragment was digested with SalI and BglII to yield a 1177-bp fragment, which was then cloned into the SalI/BglII-restricted pYES2/GAL1::Xpress::PKC1 vector. The pYES2/GAL1::Xpress::PKC1, pYES2/GAL1::Xpress::APP1, and pYES2/GAL1::Xpress::ΔC1-PKC1 plasmids were transformed into S. cerevisiae strain JK9-3dα. Transformants were selected on YNB ura- agar plates containing 2% glucose, purified, randomly chosen, and then grown in YNB ura- broth containing 2% glucose for 24 h in a 30 °C shaker. The cultures were pelleted and washed twice with sterile distilled deionized water. Cells were then inoculated into YNB ura- broth containing 2% galactose and incubated for 16 h in a 30 °C shaker. Cell pellets were collected and stored at -20 °C. To lyse the cells, the cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml chymostatin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml antipain, 20 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5). Acid-washed glass beads (Sigma) were added in a volume equal to three-fourths of the cell suspension, and the cells were homogenized in a mini-Beadbeater (Biospec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK) three times for 45 s at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 2500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred to a sterile tube. The total protein concentration of the cell lysates was measured using the method of Bradford (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of Pkc1, App1, and ΔC1-Pkc1—To prepare antibody-bead complexes, 4 μl of anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen) were combined with 200 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4FF (50% slurry; Amersham Biosciences) in a 1-ml final volume of modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on a rocking platform. The antibody-bead complexes were washed twice with modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. To preclear the cell lysate, an aliquot containing 150 μg of total protein was placed in a 1-ml final volume of modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with 200 μl of protein G-Sepharose (50% slurry), rocked at 4 °C for 1 h, and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. The precleared supernatant was added to the antibody-bead complexes, and immunoprecipitation was carried out for 16 h at 4 °C on a rocking platform. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Recombinant protein conjugated to protein G-Sepharose 4FF was washed twice with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01% leupeptin, 0.01% aprotinin, and 0.01% trypsin/chymotrypsin inhibitor). A 20-μl aliquot was pelleted and resuspended in 15 μl of kinase buffer. The reaction was started by the addition of 60 μl of reaction mixture (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mg/ml histone type III-SS (Sigma H-4524), 1× Triton X-100/lipid mixed micelles, 50 μm unlabeled ATP, and 5 μCi/reaction [γ-32P]ATP). Triton X-100/lipid mixed micelles were prepared as described previously (36Hannun Y.A. Loomis C.R. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10039-10043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with lipids at the following final concentrations: 8 mol % phosphatidylserine, 2.5 mol % DAG, 2.5 mol % C6-ceramide and C6-phytoceramide. All lipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL), except for the short-chain ceramides, which were synthesized by the Medical University of South Carolina Lipidomics Core Facility. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 10 min and terminated by the addition of 4× Laemmli buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min, loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were fixed in a 50% methanol and 10% glacial acetic acid solution, rehydrated, and dried on gel blot paper. Radioactively labeled phosphorylated histone was visualized by autoradiography and quantitated using the PhosphorImager system and by ImageQuant analysis (Amersham Biosciences). Specific activity is defined as picomoles of histone phosphorylated per min/mg of lysate, although it may vary according to the level of expression of the recombinant protein. The moles of phosphorylated histone were calculated using a standard curve of the reaction mixture containing both unlabeled ATP and [γ-32P]ATP, which had been spotted onto gel blot paper and scanned using a PhosphorImager concurrently with the dried gels. The amount of total lysate corresponding to the amount of recombinant immunoprecipitated Pkc1 used in the assay was determined by subjecting an aliquot of the immunoprecipitate with a standard curve of the total lysate containing the recombinant protein to Western blotting. The reaction time for the kinase assay and the concentration of immunoprecipitated protein used were chosen after performing a time course and protein titration to ensure that the measurements were within the linear range of kinase activity. Ipc1 Activity and Western Blotting—The Ipc1 activity of the C. neoformans wild-type and GAL7::IPC1 strains grown in 0.1% galactose and 2% raffinose was measured as described previously (23Luberto C. Toffaletti D.L. Wills E.A. Tucker S.C. Casadevall A. Perfect J.R. Hannun Y.A. Del Poeta M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and quantitated using a PhosphorImager and by ImageQuant analysis. The specific activity of Ipc1 is defined as picomoles of N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)-inositol phosphorylceramide produced per min/mg of total cell lysate protein. The quantity of N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)-inositol phosphorylceramide produced was determined using a standard curve of N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)-C6-ceramide, which was subjected to TLC alongside the experimental samples. For Western blot analysis, samples were loaded onto a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, separated by electrophoresis, and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat milk/1× PBST (phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20). The anti-Xpress primary antibody (Invitrogen) was used at 1:2500 dilution in 3% bovine serum albumin/1× PBST. The secondary antibody used was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA). The membrane was washed with 1× PBST, treated with ECL Western blot detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences), and exposed to Kodak BioMax film. Laccase Activity—Laccase activity was assayed as described previously with minor modifications (37Zhang S. Varma A. Williamson P.R. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 227: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 38Alspaugh J.A. Perfect J.R. Heitman J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3206-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Cells were inoculated from fresh cultures in YPD medium into YP broth with 2% glucose or raffinose and 2% galactose and incubated at 30 °C for 16 h in a shaking incubator. Cells were pelleted, washed once with liquid YNB medium without sugar, and resuspended in 10 ml of the same medium. The serine/threonine kinase inhibitors staurosporine, bisindolylmaleimide I, and calphostin C (all from Calbiochem) and the tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein (BIOMOL Research Labs Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA) and herbimycin A (Calbiochem) suspended in Me2SO were added to the cell suspensions at the indicated concentrations, whereas Me2SO alone was added to untreated cells. Cells were incubated for an additional 5 h at 30 °C, pelleted, washed once with sterile distilled deionized water, and resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate at pH 5.0. Then, 1 × 107 cells/ml were incubated in a 30 °C water bath for 30 min with 1 mm 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid). The cells were pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 30 s, and the supernatants were analyzed at 420 nm. The A420 nm of a sample containing no cells was used as the blank. The specific activity of laccase is defined as nanomoles of 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) oxidized (ϵ420 nm = 36 mm-1 cm-1 (39Childs R.E. Bardsley W.G. Biochem. J. 1975; 145: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar) per min/107 cells. To ensure that the addition of the inhibitors did not affect cell viability, colony-forming units were measured after each treatment by plating cells on YPD plates and comparing with untreated samples. Construction of Antisense PKC1—The DNA fragment used to isolate the PKC1 gene from C. neoformans was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the pJMM170-3 vector (kindly provided by Dr. Gary Cox, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC) (40Gorlach J.M. McDade H.C. Perfect J.R. Cox G.M. Microbiology (Read.). 2002; 148: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, named pURA5/GAL7:: PKC1-AS (where AS is antisense), contains (i) the GAL7 promoter from the C. neoformans serotype D strain, which regulates transcription of the 3′–5′ PKC1 mRNA under galactose-inducing conditions, and (ii) the URA5 gene as the selectable marker. To enable transformation and selection of the plasmid in C. neoformans, the URA5 gene in pURA5/GAL7::PKC1-AS was replaced with the nourseothricin acetyltransferase gene (NAT1) (41McDade H.C. Cox G.M. Med. Mycol. 2001; 39: 151-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which confers resistance to the antibiotic nourseothricin (Werner BioAgents, Jena-Cospeda, Germany). First, the NAT1 gene under the control of the C. neoformans actin promoter was amplified from the pNAT1 vector (a gift from Dr. John Perfect, Duke University Medical Center) using primers XB-NAT-F (5′-CTA ATC TAG AGC GAG GAT GTG AGC TGG AGA GCG G-3′) and XB-NAT-R (5′-CGC GTC TAG AGA AGA GAT GTA GAA ACT AGC TTC C-3′), which contain XbaI sites (boldface and underlined); subcloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen); excised by digestion with XbaI; and blunted. Plasmid pURA5/GAL7::PKC1-AS was digested with SacI and XbaI, blunted, dephosphorylated, and ligated with the NAT1 fragment. This pNAT1/GAL7::PKC1-AS construct was then transformed into both C. neoformans wild-type and GAL7::IPC1 strains by biolistic transformation (42Toffaletti D.L. Rude T.H. Johnston S.A. Durack D.T. Perfect J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1405-1411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to produce the C. neoformans IPC1/PKC1-AS and GAL7::IPC1/PKC1-AS strains, respectively. Transformants were grown in YPD medium containing 100 mg/liter nourseothricin. Three stable nourseothricin-resistant transformants of each strain (IPC1/PKC1-AS, transformants 16, 18, and 19; and GAL7::IPC1/PKC1-AS, transformants 5, 27, and 31) were chosen randomly and grown in YP broth containing 2% galactose, glucose, or raffinose for 24 h at 30 °C. Total RNA was extracted from each culture and used for analysis of PKC1 mRNA levels by reverse transcription-PCR using primers PKC-5 (5′-GAG GGA GAC GAG GAA AAA ATC-3′) and PKC-antisense-3 (5′-GTA CTC GAG CTA GTG TCA GTA GCA TTA CCG ATC-3′). Laccase activity and melanin production by the transformants were also analyzed as described above. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. Ipc1 Regulates Melanin Production by C. neoformans—In previous studies, we generated a C. neoformans GAL7::IPC1 strain in which the IPC1 gene is regulated by the galactose-inducible GAL7 promoter (23Luberto C. Toffaletti D.L. Wills E.A. Tucker S.C. Casadevall A. Perfect J.R. Hannun Y.A. Del Poeta M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This strain allows up-regulation of IPC1 by growing cells in galactose medium (inducing conditions) and down-regulation of IPC1 by growing cells in glucose or raffinose medium (repressing conditions). Using the GAL7::IPC1 strain, we showed that Ipc1 regulates the activity of laccase, the melanin-producing enzyme of C. neoformans, as measured by an in vitro assay (23Luberto C. Toffaletti D.L. Wills E.A. Tucker S.C. Casadevall A. Perfect J.R. Hannun Y.A. Del Poeta M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, we wondered whether Ipc1 modulation would affect the production of melanin pigment in vivo (growing cells). The C. neoformans wild-type (H99) and GAL7::IPC1 strains were grown on agar containing l-DOPA, which is a substrate for laccase, with either galactose or raffinose. The production of melanin was visualized"

In this study, transient transfection of BHK21 cells with CLN6 cDNA and immunoblot analysis using peptide-specific CLN6 antibodies demonstrated the expression of a ∼27-kDa protein that does not undergo proteolytic processing. Cross-linking experiments revealed the presence of CLN6 dimers. Using double immunofluorescence microscopy, epitope-tagged CLN6 was shown to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with no colocalization with the cis-Golgi or lysosomal markers. The translocation into the ER and proper folding were confirmed by the N-linked glycosylation of a mutant CLN6 polypeptide. Pulse-chase labeling of fibroblasts from CLN6 patients and from sheep (OCL6) and mouse (nclf) models of the disease followed by immunoprecipitation of cathepsin D indicated that neither the synthesis, sorting nor the proteolytic processing of this lysosomal enzyme was affected in CLN6-defective cells. However, the degradation of the endocytosed index protein arylsulfatase A was strongly reduced in all of the mutant CLN6 cell lines compared with controls. These data suggest that defects in the ER-resident CLN6 protein lead to lysosomal dysfunctions, which may result in lysosomal accumulation of storage material.

Currently, eight forms of human NCLs (CLN1–8) can be differentiated for which six underlying genes have been identified (2Haltia M. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2003; 62: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). CLN1 and CLN2 encode for soluble lysosomal enzymes, palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 and tripeptidylpeptidase 1, respectively (3Hellsten E. Vesa J. Olkkonen V.M. Jalanko A. Peltonen L.

Although the nature of these CLN genes differs, defects in most of them lead to massive storage of autofluorescent material in lysosomes that has been identified as the subunit c of the mitochondrial ATP synthase (2Haltia M.

Newly synthesized palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 and tripeptidylpeptidase 1 are transported to the lysosome in a Man-6-P-dependent manner (3Hellsten E. Vesa J. Olkkonen V.M. Jalanko A. Peltonen L.

Binding to Man-6-P-specific receptors, MPR46 and MPR300, allows the segregation from the secretory pathway and transport from the trans-Golgi-network to the endosomal compartment. Because of the low pH, the receptor-ligand complexes dissociate and the enzymes are delivered to the lysosome. Soluble enzymes that escape binding to the MPR in the trans-Golgi network are secreted but can be partially endocytosed after binding to MPR localized at the cell surface and transported to the lysosome (13Braulke T. Lloyd J.B. Mason R.W. Subcellular Biochemistry: Biology of the Lysosome. 27. Plenum Press, New York1996: 15-49Google Scholar). CLN3, CLN5, and CLN8 have been localized in lysosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/ER-Golgi-intermediate compartment, respectively (14Järvelä I. Lehtovirta M. Tikknen R. Kyttälä A.

Isolation and Culture of Mouse Fibroblasts—CLN6-defective mice (B6.Cg-nclf) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Age-matched C57BL/6 mice served as controls. The animals were maintained and killed according to institutional guidelines in animal facilities of the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf. Fibroblasts were prepared from lung biopsies of 3-month-old mice as described previously (31Zwad O. Kübler B. Roth W. Scharf J.G. Saftig P. Peters C. Braulke T.

Metabolic Labelings and Immunoprecipitation—Cells were labeled with [35S]methionine (150 μCi/ml) for 1 h followed by a chase for the indicated time. CtsD was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts and media as described previously (33Muschol N. Matzner U. Tiede S. Gieselmann V. Ullrich K. Braulke T. Biochem.

For deglycosylation experiments, total BHK21 extracts were solubilized and incubated in the presence or absence of 1 milliunit of peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) or 5 milliunits of endoglycosidase H (endo H, Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. Double immunofluorescence microscopy was performed with transfected BHK21 cells as described previously (25Heine C. Tyynelä J. Cooper J.D. Palmer D.N. Elleder M. Kohlschütter A. Braulke T. Biochem.

Cell Res. 1978; 111: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Expression of Wild Type and Myc-tagged CLN6 —Wild type and C-terminally Myc-tagged CLN6 were transiently expressed in BHK21 cells. Non-transfected and pcDNA3.1 vector-transfected BHK21 cells were used as controls. Western blot analysis using the peptide-specific anti-CLN6 antibody revealed a single prominent immunoreactive band of ∼27 kDa in cell extracts of wild type CLN6-transfected cells (Fig. 1). No specific cross-reacting material was found in cells transfected with the vector only. An immunoreactive band of ∼30 kDa was observed in cells expressing the CLN6Myc construct. After stripping of the nitrocellulose membrane and reprobing with anti-Myc antibodies, only the ∼30-kDa Myc-tagged CLN6 was detectable. CLN6 Is an ER-resident Protein—The deduced amino acid sequence and the predicted protein structure of CLN6 revealed neither potential N-glycosylation site sequences (NX(S/T), where X = any amino acid) nor classical lysosomal sorting motifs. On the other hand, the N-terminal RRR sequence (amino acids residues 5–7) has been detected in the ER type II membrane protein glucosidase I (41Hardt B. Kalz-Fuller B. Aparicio R. Volker C. Bause E. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), whereas the N-terminal segment of CLN6 encoded by exon 1 (amino acids residues 1–28) has been suggested to function as a putative targeting signal for mitochondria (10Gao H. Boustany R.M. Espinola J.A. Cotman S.L. Srinidhi L. Antonellis K.A. Gillis T. Qin X. Liu S. Donahue L.R. Bronson R.T. Faust J.R. Stout D. Haines J.L. Lerner T.J. MacDonald M.E. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 70: 324-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To investigate its subcellular localization, an N-glycosylation site was introduced in the predicted second luminal loop. Ile residue 153 was substituted for a Ser (p.Ile153Ser) by site-directed mutagenesis of the CLN6 cDNA changing the sequence Asn-X-Ile to Asn-X-Ser. When the p.Ile153Ser was expressed in BHK21 cells, Western blot analysis revealed an additional band of ∼33 kDa, which disappeared after deglycosylation with PNGase F or endo H (Fig. 2A). These data demonstrate that the nascent CLN6 polypeptide had been translocated to the lumen of the ER and became accessible to the glycosylation machinery. This was confirmed by double immunofluorescence microscopy. The CLN6Myc protein colocalized with the ER marker protein PDI but not with the lysosomal marker enzyme cathepsin D (Fig. 2B, CtsD). CLN6 Forms Dimers—The capability of CLN6 to form oligomeric structures in membranes was examined by cross-linkage experiments. Semi-intact BHK21 cells overexpressing CLN6 were cross-linked with the non-cleavable reagents BS3 or DSS. Immunoblot analysis showed that the amounts of a 60-kDa immunoreactive band had increased after cross-linkage in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas the intensity of the 30-kDa CLN6 band decreased (Fig. 3). These results indicate that CLN6 partially exists as a dimer in vivo. Defective CLN6 Mice Do Not Impair Sorting and Processing of Newly Synthesized Cathepsin D—To examine whether CLN6 is critical for the transport and processing of Man-6-P-containing lysosomal proteins, the secretion and proteolytic modifications of newly synthesized CtsD was determined in fibroblasts from CLN6 patients, OCL6 sheep, nclf mice, and the corresponding control cells. In human fibroblasts, CtsD is synthesized as a 53-kDa precursor form (28Hasilik A. Neufeld E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4937-4945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A small fraction of the CtsD precursor (in this study ≥3% of total) is secreted (Fig. 4A). The majority of the precursor protein binds to MPRs in the trans-Golgi network and is transported to prelysosomal/endosomal compartments where it is processed to the 47-kDa intermediate form within 2 h after synthesis (42Gieselmann V. Pohlmann R. Hasilik A. von Figura K. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The intermediate CtsD forms are delivered to lysosomes and are processed to the mature 31- and 14-kDa forms within 6 h after synthesis (Fig. 4A). When South Hampshire sheep fibroblasts were labeled for 1 h with [35S]methionine, a 45-kDa polypeptide was immunoprecipitated with the anti-human CtsD antibody (Fig. 4B). After a chase period of 6 h, only 13 and 16% of the total CtsD were recovered as a 30-kDa mature form from cells and as a 48-kDa form from the media, respectively (Fig. 4B). After metabolic labeling of primary mouse fibroblasts followed by immunoprecipitation with the anti-mouse CtsD antibody, a predominant 45-kDa polypeptide was observed (32Partanen S. Storch S. Löffler H.-G. Hasilik A. Tyynelä J. Braulke T. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Small amounts (9% of total synthesized CtsD) were detected as a 51–48-kDa band in the media (Fig. 4C), suggesting a variable extent of glycosylation. These results show that the sorting and processing of newly synthesized CtsD was not affected in fibroblasts from a CLN6 patient, from OCL6 sheep, or from nclf mice. Additionally, the specific activities of two other lysosomal enzymes, β-hexosaminidase and ASA, were comparable in control and human, sheep, and mouse CLN6-defective cells. Accumulation of Endocytosed Arylsulfatase A in CLN6-defective Fibroblasts—To examine whether defective CLN6 affect the endocytic pathway to the lysosome, fibroblasts from CLN6 patients, OCL6 sheep, nclf mice, and the respective controls were incubated with [125I]ASA for 16 h. Because the MPR46 does not function in endocytosis of lysosomal enzymes (43Stein M. Zijderhand-Bleekemolen J.E. Geuze H. Hasilik A. von Figura K. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2677-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), the uptake of ASA is mediated by the MPR300. The ASA uptake is specific as shown by the complete inhibition in the presence of an excess of Man-6-P (Fig. 5). The densitometric evaluation of autoradiographs of several experiments (n = 3–4) showed that the average amount of [125I]ASA detectable in human CLN6, OCL6, and nclf cells is 2-, 51-, and 2-fold higher, respectively, than in control cells. This effect is specific for the MPR300-mediated uptake because the amounts of internalized [125I]transferrin are comparable in control and CLN6-defective cells (Fig. 5B). The increased intracellular amounts of [125I]ASA in CLN6-defective cells could result from an increased rate of endocytosis of [125I]ASA caused by elevated concentrations of MPR300 at the cell surface or more rapid MPR300 kinetics of cycling or decreased degradation of endocytosed [125I]ASA. The concentration of MPR300 at the cell surface of control and OCL6 sheep fibroblasts was shown to be the same. This was determined on the control and affected sheep fibroblasts showing most significant difference in intracellular [125I]ASA content after endocytosis by cell surface biotinylation followed by immunoprecipitation of MPR300 and Western blot analysis (Fig. 6). Even in these cells, the amounts of MPR300 at the cell surface of control and OCL6 fibroblasts were similar, indicating that the increased amounts of intracellular [125I]ASA in OCL6 cells is not the result of increased concentrations of MPR300 at the cell surface. The specificity of the procedure was shown by the effect of MESNA, which cleaved the biotin label linkage. To examine whether the degradation of endocytosed [125I]ASA was inhibited in CLN6-defective fibroblasts, cells were incubated with [125I]ASA for3hat37 °C. After removal of the radioactive media, the cells were either harvested or chased for a further 20 h. The solubilized cells were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 7). Densitometry of the autoradiograph revealed that the amount of intracellular [125I]ASA detected in cells from CLN6 patients was 1.5-fold more than in control cells after 3 h of endocytosis. During the following chase period of 20 h, the intracellular [125I]ASA remaining in control cells was reduced to 32%, whereas 96% remained in fibroblasts from CLN6 patients. These data indicate that the degradation of endocytosed [125I]ASA is strongly inhibited in CLN6-defective cells. In the present study, we have examined the subcellular localization of the CLN6 protein. Mutations in the CLN6 gene cause the accumulation of storage material in lysosomes and the clinical manifestation of the variant late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. Here we report that CLN6 is an ER-resident protein capable of forming dimers. Furthermore, neither the synthesis, the sorting, nor the transport of newly synthesized CtsD, a lysosomal protease, was impaired in CLN6-defective cells, whereas the degradation of an exogenous protein, ASA was reduced. Several lines of evidence imply the translocation and localization of the CLN6 protein to the ER. First, the CLN6 antigenic sites were found to colocalize with PDI, an established ER marker, but not with the cis-Golgi marker GM130 or with lysosomes stained for CtsD. Secondly, the CLN6 protein does not undergo proteolytic processing steps. Thirdly, although it contains no potential N-glycosylation sites, the replacement of the residue isoleucine 153 by serine located in the second proposed luminal loop (amino acid residues 137–179) resulted in the addition of an oligosaccharide chain that could be removed by PNGase F treatment. The mutant CLN6 was also completely sensitive to endo H removing the high mannose ER-type oligosaccharide chains but not complex Golgi-type oligosaccharides. These data strongly support the concept of CLN6 residency in the ER. ER residency of membrane proteins is achieved by retention and/or retrieval mechanisms requiring signal structures and targeting motifs within the proteins. Thus, ER-resident, type I transmembrane proteins contain a dileucine motif in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, whereas an arginine-containing signal structure functions as targeting signal in some type II membrane proteins (41Hardt B. Kalz-Fuller B. Aparicio R. Volker C. Bause E. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 44Schutze M.P. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R.

Recent studies have revealed additional ER retention signals such as RXR (R = arginine, X = a large neutral or positively charged residue) (46Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 27: 97-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 47Ren Z. Riley N.J. Garcia E.P. Sanders J.M. Swanson G.T. Marshall J. J.

Furthermore, the oligomerization of proteins mediated by transmembrane and/or luminal domains forming large homodimeric or heteromeric protein complexes might prevent package into transport vesicles and export from the ER (44Schutze M.P. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1696-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 49Maza J. Mateescu M. Sarma J.D. Koval M. Cell Commun.

Chem. 2003; 278: 52700-52709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The signal structures responsible for the retention of the polytopic CLN6 in the ER are not known. Both the N- and the C-terminal domain harbor potential RRR and RKK retention motifs. However, the replacement of these motifs by lysine and leucine residues, respectively, did not alter the ER localization of the mutant CLN6. 2C. Heine and S. Storch, unpublished results. It is also possible that the dimerization reported in this study or the assembly of CLN6 in oligomeric complexes prevents its export from the ER. The function of CLN6 has not been defined. However, the comparable rates of synthesis, sorting, and proteolytic processing of CtsD in CLN6-defective and control cells as well as similar specific activities of two lysosomal enzymes, β-hexosaminidase and ASA, suggest that CLN6 does not limit transport of at least three enzymes to the lysosome. On the other hand, this study shows that the capability to degrade exogenous arylsulfatase A is strikingly impaired in CLN6-defective cells. Whereas the half-life of the newly synthesized ASA has been reported to be >40 days (51Steckel F. Hasilik A. von Figura K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the internalized human ASA is rapidly degraded (Ref. 52Steckel F. Hasilik A. von Figura K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar and the present study). It is probable that the acidic pH-dependent octamerization cannot be completed by endocytosed ASA resulting in increased lysosomal instability (53von Bülow R. Schmidt B. Dierks T. Schwabauer N. Schilling K. Weber E. Uson I. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9455-9461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Taking the endocytosed ASA as an index for the delayed degradation in CLN6-defective cells, the results indicate that either specific lysosomal proteases are absent and/or inactive or other lysosomal parameters such as pH or the presence of cofactors are affected. It is of interest that the incubation of N1E.115 neuroblastoma cells with amyloid-β protein fragments, the suspected neurotoxic mediator in Alzheimer's disease, led to an increased expression of acetylcholinesterase because of slowed lysosomal degradation. The data suggest that the lysosomal acidification is impaired (54Hu W. Gray N.W. Brimijoin S. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 470-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Lysosomal dysfunction attributed to a defective ER-resident membrane protein is not without precedent. CLN8 is another polytopic ER membrane protein defective in progressive epilepsy with mental retardation belonging to the group of NCL disorders (16Lonka L. Kyttälä A. Ranta S. Jalanko A. Lehesjoki A.-E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1691-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It remains to be investigated whether the reduced capability for lysosomal degradation of proteins demonstrated in this study is specific for CLN6 or common in both CLN6- and CLN8-defective cells."
https://openalex.org/W2151816125,"In this study, we investigated the signaling pathway involved in cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression caused by peptidoglycan (PGN), a cell wall component of the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, in RAW 264.7 macrophages. PGN caused dose- and time-dependent increases in COX-2 expression, which was attenuated by a Ras inhibitor (manumycin A), a Raf-1 inhibitor (GW 5074), and an MEK inhibitor (PD 098059). Treatment of RAW 264.7 macrophages with PGN caused time-dependent activations of Ras, Raf-1, and ERK. The PGN-induced increase in Ras activity was inhibited by manumycin A. Raf-1 phosphorylation at Ser-338 by PGN was inhibited by manumycin A and GW 5074. The PGN-induced increase in ERK activity was inhibited by manumycin A, GW 5074, and PD 098059. Stimulation of cells with PGN activated IκB kinase α/β (IKKα/β), IκBα phosphorylation, IκBα degradation, and κB-luciferase activity. Treatment of macrophages with an NF-κB inhibitor (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate), an IκBα phosphorylation inhibitor (Bay 117082), and IκB protease inhibitors (l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone and calpain inhibitor I) all inhibited PGN-induced COX-2 expression. The PGN-mediated increase in the activities of IKKα/β and κB-luciferase were also inhibited by the Ras dominant negative mutant (RasN17), manumycin A, GW 5074, and PD 098059. Further studies revealed that PGN induced the recruitment of p85α and Ras to Toll-like receptor 2 in a time-dependent manner. Our data demonstrate for the first time that PGN activates the Ras/Raf-1/ERK pathway, which in turn initiates IKKα/β and NF-κB activation, and ultimately induces COX-2 expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages.

The PGN-mediated increase in the activities of IKKα/β and κB-luciferase were also inhibited by the Ras dominant negative mutant (RasN17), manumycin A, GW 5074, and PD 098059. Further studies revealed that PGN induced the recruitment of p85α and Ras to Toll-like receptor 2 in a time-dependent manner. Our data demonstrate for the first time that PGN activates the Ras/Raf-1/ERK pathway, which in turn initiates IKKα/β and NF-κB activation, and ultimately induces COX-2 expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages.

Like lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a cell wall component of Gram-negative bacteria, PGN induces most of the clinical manifestations of bacterial infections, including inflammation, fever, septic shock, etc. (3Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of these effects are due to the activation of macrophages and generation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8 (4Wang Q. Dziarski R.

PGN binds CD14 and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), which activates transcription factors and induces gene expression (4Wang Q. Dziarski R. Kirschning C.J. Muzio M. Gupta D. Infect.

Even though it is well known that bacterial products have multiple and various effects on the regulation of host defense and immune responses by macrophages, little is known about how PGN regulates induction of the cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) gene. COX is the key enzyme that synthesizes prostaglandins and thromboxane from arachidonic acid (10Vane J.R. Bakhle Y.S. Botting R.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2620) Google Scholar, 11DeWitt D.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Two COX isozymes, COX-1 and COX-2, have been cloned and identified to have 60% homology in humans (12Xie W.L. Chipman J.G. Roberstone D.L. Erikson R.L. Simmons D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

COX-1, which is constitutively expressed in most tissues, mediates physiological responses and regulates renal and vascular homeostasis. COX-2, an inducible gene for cell synthesis, can be up-regulated by inflammatory stimuli including IL-1β, lipoteichoic acid (LTA), and LPS to produce proinflammatory prostaglandins in inflammation (14Chiang L.L.

Several consensus sequences, including those for nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), NF-IL6, and the activating transcription factor/cyclic AMP-responsive element in the 5′ region of the cox-2 gene, have been identified as regulatory sequences that can induce COX-2 in response to various stimuli (20Inoue H.

Chem. 2000; 275: 3107-3113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). NF-κB, the most important transcription factor for regulating COX-2 expression, is a dimer of the transcription factors p65 or p50 (23Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). In a resting state, this dimer is associated with IκBs to retain NF-κB in the cytosol (24Thompson J.L. Phillips R.J. Bromage H.E. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). IκB kinase (IKK), which is activated through stimulation by cytokines and bacterial products, phosphorylates IκBα at Ser-32 and Ser-36 and IκBβ at Ser-19 and Ser-23 (25DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M.

Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). This process releases active NF-κB, which is then translocated from the cytosol to the nucleus, to bind specific DNA enhancer sequences and to induce gene transcription (23Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). A previous report showed that PGN-induced NF-κB activation is mediated through TLR2-dependent multiple signaling molecules including myeloid differentiation protein (MyD88), IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK), tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), NF-κB-inducing kinase, and the IKK signaling pathway (4Wang Q. Dziarski R. Kirschning C.J. Muzio M. Gupta D. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2270-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 5Xu Z. Dziarski R. Wang Q. Swartz K. Sakamoto K.M. Gupta D. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6975-6982Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), but little information is available about the role of Ras in regulating NF-κB signaling following PGN stimulation. Ras has been found to couple with multiple effector systems to activate distinct physiological and pathological responses such as cell proliferation and release of proinflammatory mediators (22Reddy S.T.

The classic Ras-mediated pathway involves the binding of Raf-1 and subsequent phosphorylation of Raf-1 at Ser-338 by many kinases (32Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 33Zang M. Hayne C. Luo Z. J. Biol.

Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), and consequently phosphorylates many target proteins including transcription factors and protein kinases (35Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 481-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Although a role for Ras in COX-2 induction has been implied by many cell types (22Reddy S.T. Wadleigh D.J. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3107-3113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 30Blaine S. Wick M. Dessev C. Nemenoff R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 18649-18657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), however, PGN-induced COX-2 expression has not been investigated in macrophages. This study was intended to identify the signaling pathway of PGN-induced Ras activation and its roles in PGN-mediated NF-κB activation and COX-2 expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Our hypothesis is that PGN might induce TLR2, p85α, and Ras complex formation and subsequently activate the Ras/Raf-1/ERK pathway, which in turn increases IKKα/β activity and NF-κB activation and finally causes COX-2 expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Reagents—Peptidoglycan (PGN derived from Staphylococcus aureus) was purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Manumycin A, PD 098059, and SB 203580 were obtained from Calbiochem. GW 5074 was obtained from Tocris (Bristol, UK). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (DMEM/Ham's F-12), fetal calf serum, and penicillin/streptomycin were purchased from Invitrogen.

Protein A/G beads, IκBα protein (amino acids 1–317), antibodies specific for ERK, ERK phosphorylated at Tyr-204, IκBα, IκBα phosphorylated at Ser-32, IKKα, IKKβ, Raf-1, TLR2, Ras, p85α, and anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibody specific for Raf-1 phosphorylated at Ser-338 was purchased from Cell Signaling and Neuroscience (St. Louis, MO). Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG-conjugated alkaline phosphatases were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). pGL2-ELAM-Luc (which is under the control of a single NF-κB-binding site) and pBK-CMV-LacZ were kindly provided by Dr. W.-W. Lin (National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan). A Ras dominant negative mutant (RasN17) and a Ras activity assay kit were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Bay 117082 was obtained from Alexis (Lausen, Switzerland). GenePORTER™ 2 was purchased from Gene Therapy System (San Diego, CA). All materials for SDS-PAGE were purchased from Bio-Rad. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Cell Culture—The mouse macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Livingstone, MT), and cells were maintained in DMEM/Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified 37 °C incubator. After reaching confluence, cells were seeded onto either 6-cm dishes for immunoblotting, co-immunoprecipitation, or kinase assays, or 12-well plates for transfection and κB luciferase assays. Transfection and κB Luciferase Assays—For these assays, 2 × 105 RAW 264.7 cells were seeded onto 12-well plates, and cells were transfected the following day using GenePORTER™ 2 with 0.5 μg of pGL2-ELAM-Luc and 0.5 μg of pBK-CMV-LacZ. After 24 h, the medium was aspirated, replaced with fresh DMEM/Ham's F12 containing 10% FBS, and then stimulated with PGN (30 μg/ml) for another 24 h before harvest. To assess the effects of Ras, Raf-1, and ERK inhibitors, drugs were added to cells 20 min before PGN addition. To assay the effect of RasN17, cells were co-transfected with RasN17, pGL2-ELAM-Luc, and pBK-CMV-LacZ for 24 h and then treated with PGN. Luciferase activity was determined with a luciferase assay system (Promega) and was normalized on the basis of LacZ expression. The level of induction of luciferase activity was compared as a ratio to cells with and without stimulation. Immunoblot Analysis—To determine the expressions of COX-2, α-tubulin, ERK phosphorylated at Tyr-204, ERK2, IKKα/β, IκBα phosphorylated at Ser-32, IκBα, Ras, Raf-1 phosphorylated at Ser-338, and Raf-1 in RAW 264.7 macrophages, proteins were extracted, and Western blotting analyses were performed as described previously (36Lin C.H. Sheu S.Y. Lee H.M. Ho Y.S. Lee W.S. Ko W.C. Sheu J.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 36-43PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, RAW 264.7 macrophages were cultured in 6-cm dishes. After reaching confluence, cells were treated with vehicle and PGN or pretreated with specific inhibitors as indicated followed by PGN. After incubation, cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and solubilized in extraction buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.0), 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.05 mm pepstatin A, and 0.2 mm leupeptin. Samples of equal amounts of protein (60 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane that was then incubated in TBST buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, and 0.02% Tween 20 (pH 7.4)) containing 5% non-fat milk. Proteins were visualized by specific primary antibodies and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase- or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated second antibodies. Immunoreactivity was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence or nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate following the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative data were obtained using a computing densitometer with scientific imaging systems (Eastman Kodak Co.). Immunoprecipitation and Protein Kinase Assays—RAW 264.7 cells were grown in 6-cm dishes. After reaching confluence, cells were treated with 30 μg/ml PGN for the indicated time intervals or pretreated with specific inhibitors as indicated followed by PGN. After incubation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, 125 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, and 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, and centrifuged. The supernatant was then immunoprecipitated with respective polyclonal antibodies against IKKα, IKKβ, or ERK2 in the presence of A/G-agarose beads overnight. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and two times with kinase buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 20 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The kinase reactions were performed by incubating immunoprecipitated beads with 20 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 20 μm ATP and 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. To assess IKKα/β and ERK activities, 0.5 μg of GST-IκBα protein (amino acids 1–317) and 50 μg/ml of myelin basic protein (MBP) were respectively added as the substrates. The reaction mixtures were analyzed by 12 (IKKα/β) or 15% (ERK) SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Ras Activity Assay—Ras activity was measured using a Ras activity assay kit. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, lysed in magnesium lysis buffer (MLB) (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5% Igepal CA-630, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and centrifuged. An equal volume of lysate was incubated with 5 μg of Ras-binding domain for Raf-1 (Raf-1 RBD) at 4 °C overnight, and the beads were washed three times with MLB lysis buffer. Bound Ras proteins were then solubilized in 2× Laemmli sample buffer and quantitatively detected by Western blotting (10% SDS-PAGE) using mouse monoclonal Ras with the ECL system and by densitometry of corresponding bands using scientific imaging systems. Co-immunoprecipitation of TLR2 Complex Formation—RAW 264.7 cells were grown in 6-cm dishes. After reaching confluence, cells were treated with 30 μg/ml PGN for the indicated time intervals. The cells were harvested, lysed in 1 ml of PD buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 6 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 300 μm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and centrifuged. The supernatant was then immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies against TLR2, p85α, or Ras in the presence of protein A/G beads at 4 °C overnight. The immunoprecipitated beads were washed three times with PD buffer. The samples were fractionated on 15 (for Ras) or 8% (for TLR2 or p85α) SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for Ras, TLR2, or p85α. Statistical Analysis—Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments. One-way analysis of variance followed by, when appropriate, Bonferroni's multiple range test was used to determine the statistical significance of the difference between means. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. PGN Induces Macrophage COX-2 Expression—Murine RAW 264.7 macrophages were chosen to investigate the signal pathways of PGN in COX-2 expression, an inflammatory response gene. Treatment with PGN (1–100 μg/ml) for 24 h induced COX-2 protein expression in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A); this induction also occurred in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). After 24 h of treatment with 30 μg/ml PGN, the COX-2 protein had increased by ∼640 ± 14% (n = 3) (Fig. 1B). To further confirm this stimulation-specific mediation by PGN without LPS contamination, polymycin B, an LPS inhibitor, was tested. We found that polymycin B (0.3 μg/ml) did not change PGN-induced COX-2 protein levels. In contrast, polymycin B completely inhibited LPS (1 μg/ml)-induced COX-2 protein expression (data not shown). Augmentation of COX-2 Expression Occurred at the Level of Transcription—RAW 264.7 macrophages were pretreated with either actinomycin D (a transcriptional inhibitor) or cycloheximide (a translational inhibitor) and then treated with 30 μg/ml PGN. As a result, the PGN-induced elevation of COX-2 expression was inhibited by actinomycin D (30 nm) and cycloheximide (100 nm) by about 55 ± 4 and 72 ± 6%, respectively (n = 3) (Fig. 2A). The results suggest that the increase in COX-2 protein in RAW 264.7 macrophages responsive to PGN may have been due to COX-2 transcriptional expression. Involvement of NF-κB in PGN-induced COX-2 Expression—As mentioned previously, NF-κB activation is necessary for COX-2 induction. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an antioxidant, has been shown to inactivate NF-κB in macrophages (37Chen B.-C. Chou C.-H. Lin W.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29754-29763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To examine whether NF-κB activation is involved in the signal transduction pathway leading to COX-2 expression caused by PGN, the NF-κB inhibitor PDTC was used. Fig. 2B shows that PGN-induced COX-2 protein levels were inhibited by PDTC (5–50 μm) in a concentration-dependent manner. When cells were treated with 50 μm PDTC, PGN-induced COX-2 expression was inhibited by 64 ± 4% (n = 3). Furthermore, macrophage pretreatment with an IκBα phosphorylation inhibitor (Bay 117082) (38Pierce J.W. Schoenleber R. Jesmok G. Best J. Moore S.A. Collins T. Gerritsen M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21096-21103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar) inhibited PGN-induced COX-2 protein expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Pretreatment of cells with 10 μm Bay 117082 inhibited the PGN response by 53 ± 3% (n = 3) (Fig. 2C). In parallel with the inhibition by PDTC and Bay 117082, IκB protease inhibitors (l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK, 3 μm) and calpain inhibitor I (10 μm)) (39Wu M. Lee H. Bellas R.E. Schauer S.L. Arsura M. Katz D. FitzGerald M.J. Rothstein T.L. Sherr D.H. Sonenshein G.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4682-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 40Musial A. Eissa N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24268-24273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) also inhibited PGN-induced COX-2 protein expression by 35 ± 3 and 65 ± 5%, respectively (n = 3) (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that NF-κB activation is necessary for PGN-induced COX-2 expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages. PGN Causes Increases in IKKα/β Activity, IκBα Phosphorylation, IκBα Degradation, and κB-Luciferase Activity—We further determined the upstream molecules of NF-κB in PGN-induced NF-κB activation. Stimulation of cells with 30 μg/ml PGN induced increases in IKKα/β activity and IκBα phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner, reaching maximums after 10 and 10–30 min of treatment, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B). In parallel with IKKα/β activity and IκBα phosphorylation, IκBα degradation was apparent after 10 min of treatment with 30 μg/ml PGN, and the IκBα protein was resynthesized after 60 min of treatment (Fig. 3C). To directly determine NF-κB activation after PGN treatment, RAW 264.7 macrophages were transiently transfected with pGL2-ELAM-κB-luciferase as an indicator of NF-κB activation. As shown in Fig. 3D, macrophage treatment with PGN (1–100 μg/ml) for 24 h caused a concentration-dependent increase in κB luciferase activity. Ras Is Involved in PGN-induced COX-2 Expression—To explore whether Ras might mediate PGN-induced COX-2 expression, manumycin A, a Ras inhibitor (41Hara M. Han M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3333-3337Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), was used. As shown in Fig. 4A, pretreatment of RAW 264.7 macrophages with manumycin A inhibited PGN-induced COX-2 expression in a concentration-dependent manner. When cells were treated with 3 μm manumycin A, PGN-induced COX-2 expression was inhibited by 58 ± 2% (n = 3). However, manumycin A had no effect on the basal level of COX-2 expression (Fig. 4A). Moreover, we found that 3 μm manumycin A also inhibited 1 μg/ml LPS-stimulated COX-2 expression by 72 ± 8% (n = 3) (Fig. 4A). Next, we directly measured the Ras activity in response to PGN and LPS. Fig. 4, B and C, shows that treatment of RAW 264.7 cells with 30 μg/ml PGN or 1 μg/ml LPS induced an increase in Ras activity in a time-dependent manner, as assessed by immunoblotting samples for Ras immunoprecipitated from lysates using Raf-1-RBD. Maximal activation was detected after 5 min of stimulation, and the response continued until 30 min after PGN stimulation (Fig. 4B). Similarly, the LPS-induced increase in Ras activity began at 3 min, peaked at 5 min, and then declined at 10 min after LPS treatment (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, the PGN-induced increase in Ras activity was markedly inhibited by pretreatment of cells for 30 min with manumycin A (1–3 μm) in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these results imply that Ras activation is involved in PGN- or LPS-induced COX-2 expression. Raf-1 Is Involved in PGN-induced COX-2 Expression—To examine whether Raf-1, a target protein for Ras, might play a crucial role in PGN-induced COX-2 expression, the Raf-1 inhibitor GW 5074 (42Varga E.V. Rubenzik M. Grife V. Sugiyama M. Stropova D. Roeske W.R. Yamamura H.I. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 451: 101-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was used. As shown in Fig. 5A, 1 μm of GW 5074 alone did not affect the basal COX-2 level, but it significantly inhibited PGN-induced COX-2 expression by 43 ± 3% (n = 3). Furthermore, we found that GW 5074 (1 μm) inhibited LPS-induced COX-2 expression by 76 ± 3% (n = 3) (Fig. 5A). Raf-1 is associated with Ras-GTP and then by additional modifications such as phosphorylation at Ser-338 to become the active form (33Zang M. Hayne C. Luo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4395-4405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The activated Raf-1 then triggers sequential activation of downstream molecules. Thus, phosphorylation of Raf-1 at Ser-338 is a critical step in Raf-1 activation. Next, we further examined Raf-1 Ser-338 phosphorylation by PGN stimulation in RAW 264.7 macrophages using the anti-phospho-Raf-1 antibody at Ser-338. When cells were treated with 30 μg/ml PGN for various time intervals, Raf-1 Ser-338 phosphorylation increased at 5 min and peaked at 10 min. After 20 min of treatment, the PGN-induced increase in Raf-1 Ser-338 phosphorylation declined (Fig. 5B). In addition, PGN-induced Raf-1 Ser-338 phosphorylation was also inhibited by treatment with 3 μm manumycin A and 1 μm GW 5074 (Fig. 5C). Results indicate that Raf-1 is a downstream molecule of Ras and is involved in Ras-mediated COX-2 protein expression. PGN Mediates Phosphorylation of ERK—We next wished to determine whether PGN is able to activate ERK, a critical downstream target of Raf-1 (43Frost J.A. Steen H. Shapiro P. Lewis T. Ahn N. Shaw P.E. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), which has been shown to induce gene expression (44Lee H.-W. Ahn D.-H. Crawley S.C. Li J"

https://openalex.org/W1990457307,"Guanine nucleotide exchange in heterotrimeric G proteins catalyzed by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is a key event in many physiological processes. The crystal structures of the GPCR rhodopsin and two G proteins as well as binding sites on both catalytically interacting proteins are known, but the temporal sequence of events leading to nucleotide exchange remains to be elucidated. We employed time-resolved near infrared light scattering to study the order in which the Gα and Gγ C-terminal binding sites on the holo-G protein interact with the active state of the GPCR rhodopsin (R*) in native membranes. We investigated these key binding sites within mass-tagged peptides and G proteins and found that their binding to R* is mutually exclusive. The interaction of the holo-G protein with R* requires at least one of the lipid modifications of the G protein (<i>i.e.</i> myristoylation of the Gα N terminus and/or farnesylation of the Gγ C terminus). A holo-G protein with a high affinity Gα C terminus shows a specific change of the reaction rate in the GDP release and GTP uptake steps of catalysis. We interpret the data by a sequential fit model where (i) the initial encounter between R* and the G protein occurs with the Gβγ subunit, and (ii) the Gα C-terminal tail then interacts with R* to release bound GDP, thereby decreasing the affinity of R* for the Gβγ subunit. The mechanism limits the time in which both C-terminal binding sites of the G protein interact simultaneously with R* to a short lived transitory state."

Anaerobically grown cells had higher rhodoquinone levels than aerobically grown cells in agreement with earlier findings indicating the need for fumarate reductase activity in anaerobic wax ester fermentation in Euglena. Microsequencing revealed components of complex III and complex IV of the respiratory chain and the E1β subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase to be present in mitochondria of aerobically grown cells but lacking in mitochondria from anaerobically grown cells. No proteins were identified as specific to mitochondria from anaerobically grown cells. cDNAs for the E1α, E2, and E3 subunits of mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase were cloned and shown to be differentially expressed under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Their expression patterns differed from that of mitochondrial pyruvate:NADP+ oxidoreductase, the N-terminal domain of which is pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, an enzyme otherwise typical of hydrogenosomes, hydrogen-producing forms of mitochondria found among anaerobic protists. The Euglena mitochondrion is thus a long sought intermediate that unites biochemical properties of aerobic and anaerobic mitochondria and hydrogenosomes because it contains both pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase and rhodoquinone typical of hydrogenosomes and anaerobic mitochondria as well as pyruvate dehydrogenase and ubiquinone typical of aerobic mitochondria.

Oxygen respiration, the most important process for ATP production in many eukaryotes, takes place in mitochondria. Its overall biochemistry, involving oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, citric acid cycle, electron transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation, is conserved across many groups of fungi, higher plants, and animals (1Saraste M. Science. 1999; 283: 1488-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar), although the exceptions prove the rule: not all mitochondria require oxygen for ATP synthesis (2Tielens A.G.M. Rotte C.

Biol. 2001; 204: 3755-3764PubMed Google Scholar). In some anaerobic mitochondria, ATP is synthesized via a proton-pumping electron transport chain, but different terminal acceptors, and alternative terminal oxidases accordingly, are used. Both external and endogenous terminal acceptors are used. Some fungi, for example Fusarium oxysporum and Cylindrocarpon tonkinense, can utilize nitrate or nitrite as terminal acceptor (5Kobayashi M.

These mitochondria possess a nitrite reductase that reduces nitrite to nitrogen monoxide with electrons from the cytochrome c pool. An additional nitrate reductase can be used to reduce nitrate to nitrite, and the electrons for this reaction are derived from the ubiquinone pool (12Zumft W.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 533-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2830) Google Scholar). Mitochondria from parasitic worms such as Fasciola hepatica or Ascaris suum can use endogenously produced fumarate as their electron acceptor (2Tielens A.G.M. Rotte C. Van Hellemond J.J. Martin W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 564-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 13Tielens A.G.M. Van Hellemond J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Reduction of fumarate by the action of fumarate reductase is directly coupled to electron transport and ATP synthesis but involves rhodoquinone instead of ubiquinone.The single, reticulate mitochondrion of the flagellate Euglena gracilis is biochemically an intermediate between aerobic and anaerobic mitochondria. Several Euglena species adapt to a broad range of oxygen concentrations and can tolerate even very low concentrations of oxygen (14Buetow D.E. Buetow D.E. The Biology of Euglena: Subcellular Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. 4. Academic Press, San Diego1989: 247-314Google Scholar). E. gracilis can survive up to 6 months of oxygen deprivation in the dark with culturing on lactate (15Carre I. Bomsel J.L. Calvayarc R. Plant Sci. 1988; 54: 193-202Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Euglena uses its mitochondrion for ATP synthesis in the presence and absence of oxygen (14Buetow D.E. Buetow D.E. The Biology of Euglena: Subcellular Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. 4. Academic Press, San Diego1989: 247-314Google Scholar, 16Kitaoka S. Nakano Y. Miyatake K. Yokota A. Buetow D.E. The Biology of Euglena: Subcellular Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. 4. Academic Press, San Diego1989: 2-135Google Scholar). Under aerobic conditions Euglena performs a more or less typical oxidative phosphorylation in association with a modified citric acid cycle and respiratory chain. Pyruvate from glycolysis enters the mitochondrion and is subjected to oxidative decarboxylation, but this is thought not to involve the typical mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) 1The abbreviations used are: PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; UQ, ubiquinone; RQ, rhodoquinone; UQ9, UQ-9; RQ9, RQ-9; EST, expressed sequence tag; ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS, electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; IPG, immobilized pH gradient; E1, pyruvate dehydrogenase; E2, dihydrolipoyl transacetylase; E3, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase. 1The abbreviations used are: PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; UQ, ubiquinone; RQ, rhodoquinone; UQ9, UQ-9; RQ9, RQ-9; EST, expressed sequence tag; ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS, electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; IPG, immobilized pH gradient; E1, pyruvate dehydrogenase; E2, dihydrolipoyl transacetylase; E3, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase. complex but instead an unusual, oxygen-sensitive enzyme, pyruvate:NADP+ oxidoreductase (6Rotte C.

Chem. 1987; 262: 9130-9135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting acetyl-CoA enters a modified citric acid cycle, which entails a shunt via succinate semialdehyde as in the α-proteobacterium Bradyrhizobium (18Green L.S. Li Y. Emerich D.W. Bergersen F.J. Day D.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2838-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), circumventing the step catalyzed by α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Under anaerobic conditions, pyruvate:NADP+ oxidoreductase constitutes the key enzyme for a unique wax ester fermentation. Acetyl-CoA from decarboxylation of pyruvate serves in the absence of oxygen as the terminal acceptor of electrons from glucose oxidation whereby fatty acids are thought to be synthesized via an unusual reversal of β-oxidation that does not involve malonyl-CoA (19Inui H. Miyatake K. Nakano Y. Kitaoka S. FEBS Lett. 1982; 150: 89-93Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 20Inui H. Miyatake K. Nakano Y. Kitaoka S. Eur. J.

A part of the fatty acids is reduced to alcohols, esterified with another fatty acid, and deposited in the cytosol as wax (hence wax ester fermentation). The stored waxes are degraded via aerobic dissimilation in the mitochondrion upon the return to aerobic conditions (19Inui H. Miyatake K. Nakano Y. Kitaoka S. FEBS Lett. 1982; 150: 89-93Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Similar to the situation in anaerobic mitochondria of metazoa, wax ester fermentation in Euglena involves mitochondrial fumarate reduction and thus requires rhodoquinone (2Tielens A.G.M. Rotte C. Van Hellemond J.J. Martin W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 564-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), which was characterized from Euglena in early work (22Powls R. Hemming F.W. Phytochemistry (Oxf.). 1966; 5: 1235-1247Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar).To examine changes in mitochondrial biochemistry of Euglena during the shift from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, we investigated changes in ubiquinone and rhodoquinone content and isolated mitochondria from cells grown under both conditions to analyze their protein content via two-dimensional electrophoresis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMedium and Culture Conditions—E. gracilis strain Z (SAG 1224-5/25 collection of algae Göttingen) for isolation of mitochondria and subsequent analysis by two-dimensional PAGE was cultured as described previously (6Rotte C. Stejskal F. Zhu G. Keithly J.S. Martin W. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2001; 18: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Euglena cultures for determination of UQ9 and RQ9 were grown in a BIOSTAT B 10-liter fermenter (Braun Biotech) at a culturing volume of 7 liters with light continuously at 5000 lux, constant temperature at 28 °C, and stirring at 200 rpm. A defined medium as described by Ogbonna et al. (23Ogbonna J.C. Tomiyama S. Tanaka H. J. Appl. Phycol. 1998; 10: 67-74Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and Yamane et al. (24Yamane Y. Utsunomiya T. Watanabe M. Sasaki K. Biotechnol. Lett. 2001; 23: 1223-1228Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was modified and used. One liter of medium contained 12 g of glucose, 0.8 g of KH2PO4, 1.5 g of (NH4)2SO4, 0.5 g of MgSO4·7H2O, 0.2 g of CaCO3, 0.0144 g of H3BO3, 2.5 mg of vitamin B1, 20 μg of vitamin B12, 1 ml of trace element solution, 1 ml of iron solution. The trace element solution contained 4.4 g of ZnSO4·7H2O, 1.16 g of MnSO4·H2O, 0.3 g of Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.32 g of CuSO4·5H2O, and 0.38 g of CoSO4·5H2O/100 ml of distilled water. The iron solution contained 1.14 g of (NH4)2SO4Fe(SO4)2·6H2O and 1 g of EDTA/100 ml of distilled water. The pH of the medium was kept at 2.8 during the cultivation. Aerobic cultures were gassed with 2 liters/min air, and the anaerobic cultures were gassed with 2 liters/min nitrogen. Relative to O2 levels in air-gassed uninoculated medium (set to 100%), anaerobic culture medium had 0% O2 as determined with the BIOSTAT B electrode, although photosynthetic O2 production was not specifically blocked by inhibitors in N2-gassed, light-grown cultures. Cultures were harvested 5 days after inoculation with a starting density of 35,000 cells/ml. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and used directly (not frozen) for isolation of mitochondria or determination of UQ9 and RQ9 content.Isolation of Mitochondria and Marker Enzymes—Spheroplast preparation by partial trypsin digestion of the pellicle and gentle mechanical disruption and fractionation by differential centrifugation was performed by the method of Chaudhary and Merrett (25Chaudhary M.F. Merrett M.J. Planta. 1984; 162: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were purified on discontinuous Percoll gradients as described by Inui et al. (20Inui H. Miyatake K. Nakano Y. Kitaoka S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 142: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Marker enzyme activities of succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.16) for mitochondria (26Tokunaga M. Nakano Y. Kitaoka S. Biochim. Biophys.

Protozool. 1979; 26: 471-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NADP+) (EC 1.2.1.13) for chloroplasts (28Theiss-Seuberling H.G. Plant Cell Physiol. 1984; 25: 601-609Google Scholar) were determined using the assays described, respectively.Two-dimensional Electrophoresis—Separation of mitochondrial proteins by two-dimensional PAGE was performed according to Görg et al. (29Görg A. Postel W. Günther S. Weser J. Electrophoresis. 1985; 6: 599-604Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 30Görg A. Postel W. Günther S. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 531-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Isoelectric focusing was performed on a IPGphor isoelectric focusing system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Up to 1 mg of mitochondrial protein was included in the rehydration solution (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% (w/v) CHAPS, 0.5% (v/v) IPG buffer, bromphenol blue), and the IPG strip (18 cm, pH 3-10, Amersham Biosciences) was allowed to rehydrate at 20 °C for 12 h. Focusing was performed for 0.5 h at 100 V, 1 h at 500 V, 1 h at 1000 V, and 9 h at 8000 V. IPG strips were equilibrated for 30 min in equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6 m urea, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, bromphenol blue) with 1% (w/v) dithiothreitol and for 30 min in equilibration buffer with 3% (w/v) iodoacetamide followed by the transfer to the top of a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and covering with agarose sealing solution (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.5% (w/v) agarose, bromphenol blue). SDS-PAGE was performed in a Hoefer SE 600 vertical electrophoresis unit (Amersham Biosciences) with a current of 40 mA/gel. Gels were stained with Coomassie by the method of Neuhoff et al. (31Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2342) Google Scholar) or silver-stained as described by Blum et al. (32Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3729) Google Scholar).In-gel Digestion and ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS Analysis—Protein spots of interest were cut from the gel, washed twice with 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, and incubated successively with 100% acetonitrile, 100 mm NH4HCO3, and 100 mm 1:1 NH4HCO3:acetonitrile. After vacuum drying, the gel pieces were reswollen with 10 ng μl-1 trypsin (Promega) and digested for 12 h at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted in 5% (v/v) formic acid using a sonication bath. Prior to mass spectrometry, samples were desalted using C18 ZipTips (Millipore). ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis of tryptic peptides was performed with a QSTAR XL mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems).Determination of UQ9 and RQ9 Content—Harvested Euglena cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, diluted to a final titer of 107/ml, and lyophilized. Lipids were extracted from these samples essentially according to Bligh and Dyer (33Bligh E.D. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42174) Google Scholar). After evaporation (nitrogen stream at 40 °C) of the organic phase, the lipid residue was dissolved in 15% (v/v) diethyl ether in hexane. Quinones were eluted from a silica column (LiChrolut Si 200) with 15% (v/v) diethyl ether in hexane, dried by a nitrogen stream, and dissolved in ethanol.Quinones were separated on a reverse phase RP-18 column (LiChrospher, end-capped, 5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm, Merck) using a linear gradient from 7 to 20% (v/v) diisopropyl ether in methanol with 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid in 24 min. Quinones were detected with a PE Sciex API 365 mass spectrometer equipped with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization interface. Measurements were performed in the positive ionization mode. Quantification of eluted quinones was performed by selective reaction monitoring taking M + H+ as a parent ion (795.6 for UQ9 and 780.6 for RQ9), and the specific product ion for UQ9 and the specific product ion for RQ9 were 197.1 and 182.1, respectively (Fig. 1). Calibration of the liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method was performed using UQ9 standards (Sigma) and RQ9 standards (isolated from A. suum according to Bligh and Dyer (33Bligh E.D.

The concentrations of the UQ9 and RQ9 standards were spectrophotometrically determined using the following extinction coefficients: UQ9, E1% 1 cm = 185 at 275 nm (22Powls R. Hemming F.W. Phytochemistry (Oxf.). 1966; 5: 1235-1247Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar); RQ9, E1% 1 cm = 140 at 283 nm (35Crane F.L. Barr R. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 18: 137-165Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar).Identification of PDH Subunits E1α, E2, and E3—Standard molecular methods, nucleic acid isolation, cDNA synthesis, and cloning in λ ZAPII were performed as described previously (36Henze K.

Hybridization probes for PDH subunits from Euglena were obtained by comparisons of in-house Euglena EST data with annotated sequences in the National Center for Biotechnology Information data base using BLAST. Oligonucleotides for screening a library constructed with mRNA from aerobically grown Euglena cells were designed as follows: PDH-E1α, 5′-AATCTCCTTGTCCACCTCCTTGTTAGTCTCCTTCTCGACTGCCTT-3′; PDH-E2, 5′-TTTCAAATCAGCATTGTAGACAACTGGGGTGATCAGTCCGTT-3′; PDH-E3, 5′-CCTTGGAAGGGGACAAGAAGGTGAAGGTCGTTGGAGAAACGA-3′.Sequence Analyses—Data base searching, sequence handling, and alignment were performed with programs of the GCG package, version 10.3 (38Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 2: 387-395Crossref Scopus (11516) Google Scholar). Reinspection of alignments and automatic exclusion of gaps were performed with programs clus2mol and rminsdel of the MOLPHY package, version 2.3 (39Adachi J. Hasegawa M. Computer Science Monographs.

Marker enzyme activities for chloroplasts were not detectable, and only very slight activities of cytosolic marker enzyme were measured (Table I). Succinatesemialdehyde dehydrogenase, the marker enzyme for Euglena mitochondria, was strongly enriched in the mitochondrial fraction as compared with the crude extract (Table I).Table IMarker enzyme activities Activities are expressed in nmol·mg-1·min-1 for crude extract and mitochondrial fraction of E. gracilis cells grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (±S.D.).EnzymeCrude extract, aerobic (n = 8)Mitochondrial fractionAerobic (n = 8)Anaerobic (n = 6)Succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase18.8 ± 5.8173 ± 22.5153 ± 13.2Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NADP+)431 ± 15.600Lactate dehydrogenase17,950 ± 15702 ± 0.86 ± 0.7 Open table in a new tab Separation of Mitochondrial Proteins by Two-dimensional PAGE—Mitochondrial proteins from aerobic and anaerobic cells separated in the first dimension in pH 3-10 gradients and subsequent separation on SDS-PAGE were compared. The overall number of protein spots observed here for Euglena mitochondria is rather small in comparison with recent studies of mitochondrial proteomes in yeast or mouse (43Sickmann A. Reinders J.

However, our focus here is on major proteins involved in core energy metabolism whose levels change in response to the transition to anaerobiosis. No new protein spots appeared during the shift from aerobic to anaerobic culturing conditions; rather some spots present in aerobic mitochondria disappeared under anaerobic conditions (Fig. 2). Spots identified as aerobic specific spots in mitochondria from three independent cultures were excised from Coomassie-stained gels, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS. Sequenced peptides were compared with GenBank™ with options for short nearly exact matches and by searching Euglena EST data. Three sequenced spots that are missing in mitochondria from anaerobically grown cells belonged to components of electron transfer in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Fig. 2, spots 1, 2, and 3). These three spots represented two components of mitochondrial complex III (ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex core protein I and complex III core protein II) plus one component of complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV). In addition, analysis of a fourth spot indicated that the E1β subunit of the PDH complex (Fig. 2, spot 4) was also not expressed under anaerobic conditions (Table II).Fig. 2Mitochondrial proteome analysis. Silver-stained two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel loaded with 800 μg of mitochondria isolated from aerobically (A) and anaerobically (B) grown E. gracilis cells.

Northern hybridization revealed that all three PDH subunits are expressed under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Messenger RNA expression levels in anaerobically light-grown cells were about 2-fold higher than those in anaerobically darkgrown cells, whereas aerobically grown cells had reduced mRNA levels in comparison to anaerobically gassed cells grown in the light (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Gene expression under different conditions.

The blots were probed with PDH E1α, PDH E2, and PDH E3 as indicated.

RQ and UQ concentrations differed between aerobically and anaerobically grown Euglena cells (Table III). In anaerobically grown cells, a decrease in ubiquinone content was detected compared with aerobically grown cells, whereas these anaerobic cells showed an increase in rhodoquinone content. Consequently the RQ:UQ ratio was increased in anaerobically grown Euglena. In anaerobically grown Euglena, RQ was 43% of the total quinones (RQ + UQ) compared with 28% under aerobic conditions. The total amount of quinones did not differ between aerobically and anaerobically grown cells.Table IIIUbiquinone and rhodoquinone content of Euglena cells Quinones were extracted and determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Means of three independent aerobic and anaerobic cultures are shown (±S.D.).

https://openalex.org/W2049219098,"The NH2 terminus of Stat proteins forms a versatile protein interaction domain that is believed to use discrete surfaces to mediate oligomerization and tyrosine dephosphorylation of Stat dimers. Here we show for Stat1 and Stat5a/b that these interfaces overlap and need to be reassigned to an unrelated region of the N-domain. Unexpectedly, our study showed for Stat1 that defective oligomerization of DNA-bound dimers was associated with prolonged interferon-induced nuclear accumulation. This uncoupling of DNA binding and nuclear retention was explained by the concomitant dephosphorylation deficiency that both Stat1 and Stat5a/b have in common and that for Stat1 was due to defective dephosphorylation by the phosphatase TC45. Furthermore, diminished N-domain-mediated oligomerization affected transcriptional activation by both Stat1 and Stat5a/b in a promoter-specific manner. DNA binding analysis indicated that oligomerization of Stats on DNA may be common, irrespective of the presence of multiple canonical binding sites. Accordingly, also transcription from promoters with only a single discernable γ-activated sequence site was negatively effected by reduced tetramerization. Thus, these results indicate that defective oligomerization cannot generally be compensated for by enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation and prolonged nuclear accumulation. In addition, these data clarify the role of DNA binding in nuclear retention of Stat1.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11767-11769Google Scholar). Canonical signaling through the Janus tyrosine kinase (Jak)/Stat pathway begins at the cell membrane with the engagement of cytokines with their cognate receptor (2Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Google Scholar). This triggers the autophosphorylation on tyrosines of non-covalently attached Jak kinases, which also phosphorylate signature tyrosine residues in the intracellular receptor tails thus providing phosphotyrosine docking sites for the Stat SH2 domain (3Leaman D.W. Leung S. Li X. Stark G.R. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1578-1588Google Scholar). The bound Stat monomers detach from their receptor docking sites after phosphorylation of a single tyrosine residue at their COOH terminus and form high avidity reciprocal homo- or heterodimers (4Shuai K. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1744-1776Google Scholar, 5Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Huang L.H. Qureshi S.A. Cowburn D. Darnell Jr., J.E.

This sequence of events is commonly referred to as “Stat activation” and within minutes triggers the accumulation of Stat dimers in the nucleus due to their inability to leave this compartment (7Meyer T. Marg A. Lemke P. Wiesner B. Vinkemeier U. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1992-2005Google Scholar). Here they can bind to palindromic DNA recognition sites (GAS) and directly induce transcription (8Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Google Scholar). The products of seven different Stat genes and various splice variants thereof can be found in mammalian cells. Gene inactivation experiments using homologous recombination have revealed that the most striking phenotypes are associated with signal transduction by particular cytokines. Stat1 is required for interferon-α (IFNα) and IFNγ signaling, and mice and humans lacking Stat1 are extremely sensitive to viral and microbial infection (9Dupuis S. Jouanguy E. Al-Hajjar S. Fieschi C. Al-Mohsen I.Z. Al-Jumaah S. Yang K. Chapgier A. Eidenschenk C. Eid P. Al Ghonaium A. Tufenkeji H. Frayha H. Al-Gazlan S. Al-Rayes H. Schreiber R.D. Gresser I. Casanova J.L. Nat.

The two highly related Stat5a and Stat5b proteins (∼96% sequence identity) are activated by a wide range of different cytokines such as interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-7, prolactin, and growth factors. Accordingly, gene ablation experiments uncovered mammary gland defects, growth abnormalities, and an absent IL-2 response (12Liu X. Robinson G.W. Wagner K.U. Garrett L. Wynshaw-Boris A. Hennighausen L. Genes Dev. 1997; 15: 179-186Google Scholar, 13Teglund S. McKay C. Schuetz E. van Deursen J.M. Stravopodis D. Wang D. Brown M. Bodner S. Grosveld G. Ihle J.N.

Stat proteins consist of a large core domain including the DNA binding module (15Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 15: 984-994Google Scholar) and the SH2 domain responsible for dimer formation (5Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Huang L.H. Qureshi S.A. Cowburn D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Google Scholar). The core is connected through a proteolytically cleavable peptide to the smaller N-domain, which engages in a multitude of protein-protein interactions. The N-domain mediates cooperative DNA binding of Stat dimers (16Li X. Leung S. Burns C. Stark G.R. Biochimie (Paris). 1998; 80: 703-710Google Scholar, 17John S. Vinkemeier U. Soldaini E.

J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28049-28056Google Scholar). The structure of the isolated N-domain reveals an all-helical hook-like appearance (23Vinkemeier U. Moarefi I. Darnell Jr., J.E. Kuriyan J. Science. 1998; 279: 1048-1052Google Scholar). In solution the N-domain forms stable dimers; however, two alternate binding surfaces are formed in the crystals. Recent reevaluation of the crystal-packing has indicated that the initial assignment of one of these surfaces as being responsible for cooperative DNA binding is probably incorrect (24Chen X. Bhandari R. Vinkemeier U. van den Akker F. Darnell Jr., J.E. Kuriyan J. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 361-365Google Scholar). An unrelated region of the N-domain has previously been identified by mutagenesis to be important for the dephosphorylation of Stat1, as mutation of an invariant residue caused severe hyperphosphorylation (21Shuai K. Liao J. Song M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4932-4941Google Scholar). However, this mutation affects the salt bridges that interlink the helices that make up this domain and thus may impair the structural integrity of this domain. Therefore, at present the physiological interfaces that modulate cooperative DNA binding and tyrosine dephosphorylation of the Stats remain poorly defined. Here, we investigate these issues and find for Stat1 and Stat5a/b that the two interfaces overlap. Our data reveal that DNA binding, but not dimerization, is dispensable for nuclear retention of Stat proteins and demonstrate a promoter-specific but widespread need for cooperative DNA binding in gene activation. Cell Culture and Antibody Microinjection—Human HeLa S3, U3A, and 293T cells were grown as described previously (25Begitt A. Meyer T. van Rossum M. Vinkemeier U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10418-10423Google Scholar). Unless noted otherwise, treatment of cells was with 2 nm human (hu) IL-2 (Roche), 5 ng/ml huIFNγ (Biomol), 500 IU/ml huIFNα (Biomol), 20 ng/ml huTNFα (Strathmann, Hannover), 500 nm staurosporine (Sigma), 50 μm MG132 (Calbiochem). Antibody microinjection into HeLa cells transiently expressing GFP-tagged Stat1 variant proteins was done with monoclonal GFP antibody 2A3 as described previously (7Meyer T. Marg A. Lemke P. Wiesner B. Vinkemeier U. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1992-2005Google Scholar, 26Meyer T. Begitt A. Lödige I. van Rossum M. Vinkemeier U. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 344-354Google Scholar). Plasmids, Transfections, and Luciferase Assays—pCIStat5a, pCIStat5b, pStat1-GFP, and pStat1-DNAminus have been described previously (7Meyer T. Marg A. Lemke P. Wiesner B. Vinkemeier U. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1992-2005Google Scholar, 17John S. Vinkemeier U. Soldaini E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1910-1918Google Scholar, 25Begitt A. Meyer T. van Rossum M. Vinkemeier U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10418-10423Google Scholar). Site-specific mutagenesis of these plasmids according to manufacturer's instructions (QuikChange, Stratagene; Morph site-specific mutagenesis, 5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) generated the respective N-domain mutants (F77A for Stat1, F81A for Stat5). The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Additionally for use in reporter gene assays, the cDNAs of Stat1 and Stat1F77A were cloned into pcDNA3. For IL-2 receptor reconstitution transfection assays, 4 × 106 293T cells were transfected with the following DNAs: 2 μg of IL-2 receptor β, 0.5 μg of γc, 0.25 μg of Jak3, and 0.5 μg (for electrophoretic mobility shift assays) or 10 ng (for luciferase assay) of each of the WT Stat5 or F81A mutant expression plasmids. Additionally for the luciferase assay, 1 μg of positive regulatory region III (PRRIII)-E1b- or M10-E1b-luciferase reporter constructs (17John S. Vinkemeier U. Soldaini E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1910-1918Google Scholar) and 0.5 ng of the transfection control plasmid, pRLTK-luciferase, was added. The total amount of DNA transfected was kept at a constant amount of 10 μg with empty pCI vector (Promega). Twenty-four hours after transfection, where appropriate, cells were split into two, and 48 h after transfection one set was left untreated and the other was treated with 2 nm IL-2 for 30 min (for nuclear extracts) or overnight (for luciferase assays). Dual luciferase assays were performed according to manufacturer's protocols (Promega). Reporter gene assays with transfected U3A cells and IFNγ stimulation were done as described previously (25Begitt A. Meyer T. van Rossum M. Vinkemeier U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10418-10423Google Scholar). The reporter genes pIC339 and pIC1352 (a kind gift from Dr. van der Saag) contain 339 or 1352 bp (relative to the transcription start site) from the 5′-region of the human intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) gene (27van de Stolpe A. Caldenhoven E. Stade B.G. Koenderman L. Raaijmakers J.A. Johnson J.P. van der Saag P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6185-6192Google Scholar). Transfections for luciferase assays were performed in triplicate and the data presented are the means ± S.D. values for the three independent experiments. Nuclear Extracts and EMSAs—Following transfections, cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (26Meyer T. Begitt A. Lödige I. van Rossum M. Vinkemeier U. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 344-354Google Scholar). Total protein was determined by the Bradford method with a bovine serum albumin standard (Bio-Rad). All buffers used in the cell extract preparations and EMSAs contained protease inhibitor mixture-1 (Calbiochem), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mm sodium fluoride. Ten μg of nuclear extracts was incubated with 40,000 cpm of 32P-labeled DNA probe, labeled by end-filling reaction using Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs). The WT PRRIII and MGF probes have been previously described (28Soldaini E. John S. Moro S. Bollenbacher J. Schindler U. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 389-401Google Scholar). EMSA reactions containing Stat1 were done with in vitro phosphorylated recombinant protein or cytoplasmic extracts from IFNγ-treated reconstituted U3A cells (25Begitt A. Meyer T. van Rossum M. Vinkemeier U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10418-10423Google Scholar), and the following duplex oligonucleotides (4-bp overhangs at each 5′-end are not included; the respective antisense oligonucleotides are not listed): M67, 5′-CGACATTTCCCGTAAATCTG; human IRF-1, 5′-CGACATTTCCCCGAAATCTG; 2×-GAS, 5′-CGTTTCCCCGAAATTGACGGATTTCCCCGAAC; GAS+GAS-like, 5′-CGTTTCCCGGAAATAGAAGATTATTATCATTAT; GAS+non-GAS, 5′-CGTTTCCCGGAAATAGAAGAACCTCGTTGTCAC; 2×-non-GAS, 5′-CGAGGTACAGGTAAAGAAGAACCTCGTTGTCAC; GAS-like sites are underlined. For competition assays the EMSA reaction was equilibrated for 15 min at room temperature before adding a 750-fold molar excess of the respective unlabeled DNA. Thereafter, the reaction was incubated at room temperature for another 30 min (or as indicated). In supershift assays 20 ng of a Stat1-specific antibody was added and incubated with the EMSA reaction for 15 min at room temperature. Dephosphorylation Assays and Western Blot Analysis—In vivo dephosphorylation was determined as follows. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with IFNγ or IL-2 for 30 min, and then the cytokine-containing medium was replaced with either fresh medium or medium containing Me2SO, MG132, staurosporine, or MG132 + staurosporine as indicated. Samples were harvested immediately (zero time point) or at the indicated times after removal of cytokine and replacement with new medium containing appropriate chemicals. Cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and whole cell lysates were prepared by boiling the cell pellet in 200 μl of SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Ten μl of each sample was loaded on 8% Tris-glycine-SDS gels. Western blotting, blot development, and reprobing were done as described previously (25Begitt A. Meyer T. van Rossum M. Vinkemeier U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10418-10423Google Scholar) using a phosphotyrosine-specific Stat5 antibody (Tyr694, αStat5-P) or a pan-Stat5 antibody (both from Transduction Laboratories) or a Tyr701 phosphospecific Stat1-P (Cell Signaling) or Stat1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In vitro dephosphorylation reactions were performed for 60 min with 0.5 nm Stat1 dimers and 1.5 units of truncated TC45 (Sigma) and the indicated amount of unphosphorylated Stat1 as described previously (7Meyer T. Marg A. Lemke P. Wiesner B. Vinkemeier U. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1992-2005Google Scholar). Unphosphorylated Stat1 was added at a concentration of 0.5, 5, or 20 nm. The mixture was resolved by SDS-PAGE after boiling in SDS sample buffer. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant Stat1α and His-tagged Stat5a proteins were produced in baculovirus infected insect cells and purified as described previously (7Meyer T. Marg A. Lemke P. Wiesner B. Vinkemeier U. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1992-2005Google Scholar, 28Soldaini E. John S. Moro S. Bollenbacher J. Schindler U. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 389-401Google Scholar). Stat5a was tyrosine-phosphorylated by an endogenous kinase during expression in the insect cells (28Soldaini E. John S. Moro S. Bollenbacher J. Schindler U. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 389-401Google Scholar). In vitro tyrosine phosphorylation with epidermal growth factor receptor and isolation of phosphorylated Stat1 were done as described previously (7Meyer T. Marg A. Lemke P. Wiesner B. Vinkemeier U. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1992-2005Google Scholar). For production of Stat1F77A, the correctly mutated cDNA was excised (NotI) from pcDNA-Stat1F77A and cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pFastBac (Invitrogen). For production of recombinant Stat5aF81A the wild type Stat5a cDNA sequence, which was cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pBacPAK8 (Clontech) was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis at the appropriate residue and confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Both Stat5a and Stat5aF81A were confirmed to be tyrosine-phosphorylated by Western blot analysis using anti-phospho-Stat5 antibody. Truncated TC45 was produced in bacteria and purified as described previously (7Meyer T. Marg A. Lemke P. Wiesner B. Vinkemeier U. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1992-2005Google Scholar). Fluorescence Microscopy and Fluorescence Recovery after Photo-bleaching (FRAP)—Fluorescence microscopy and FRAP were performed as described previously (7Meyer T. Marg A. Lemke P. Wiesner B. Vinkemeier U. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1992-2005Google Scholar). RT-PCR—RT-PCR analysis was done as described previously (26Meyer T. Begitt A. Lödige I. van Rossum M. Vinkemeier U. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 344-354Google Scholar) with U3A cells stably expressing Stat1 or Stat1F77A and the following primer pairs: IRF-1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_002198), 5′-ATGAGACCCTGGCTAGAG and 5′-AAGCATCCGGTACACTCG; LMP-2 (GenBank™ accession number U01025), 5′-GG-GGGCGTTGTGATGGGTTCTGATTC and 5′-TCGGGAGACATGCCTGGCTTATAT; ISG-15 (GenBank™ accession number NM_005101), 5′-GGCGGGCAACGAATTCCAGGTGTC and 5′-CCCCGCAGGCGCAGATTC-ATGA; ISG-56k (GenBank™ accession number M24594), 5′-AGGGCAGAACAGAGAAAAGCTAGACAA and 5′-CCGCTCATAGTACTCCAGGGCTTCATTC. The Alternate N-domain Interface Mediates Cooperative DNA Binding of Stat1 and Stat5a/b—Studies of Stat oligomerization from our and other labs have indicated that a single invariant residue (Trp37 of Stat1) that is located in the crystallographic interface of N-domain dimers affects tetramerization of full-length Stats (17John S. Vinkemeier U. Soldaini E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1910-1918Google Scholar, 20Zhang X. Darnell Jr., J.E. J. Biol.

However, in vitro studies with the isolated N-domain demonstrated that mutation of Trp37 causes destabilization and degradation of the N-domain (24Chen X. Bhandari R. Vinkemeier U. van den Akker F. Darnell Jr., J.E. Kuriyan J. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 361-365Google Scholar), and the Stat5W37A mutants were previously found to be expressed less efficiently compared with their WT counterparts in either a baculovirus expression system or in IL-2 receptor-reconstituted 293T cells (17John S. Vinkemeier U. Soldaini E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1910-1918Google Scholar, 28Soldaini E. John S. Moro S. Bollenbacher J. Schindler U. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 389-401Google Scholar). The crystal packing of the isolated N-domain also revealed another mode of N-domain interactions not involving Trp37 (24Chen X. Bhandari R. Vinkemeier U. van den Akker F. Darnell Jr., J.E. Kuriyan J. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 361-365Google Scholar). Therefore, we mutated in the full-length Stat molecule a conserved hydrophobic residue on the surface of the N-domain that was demonstrated to affect dimerization of N-domains (Phe77 → Ala in Stat1 and Phe81 → Ala in Stat5a/b, respectively). As is shown in Fig. 1, A and B, the resulting Stat1 and Stat5b mutants were expressed well and no indication of structural instabilities was detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. However, expression of the Stat5aF81A mutant was reduced in 293T cells compared with WT (Fig. 1B). Therefore, we produced recombinant Stat5a protein in baculovirus infected insect cells (Fig. 1C). In these cells, Stat5aF81A was expressed even better than WT. Phosphorylation by an endogenous kinase yielded correctly tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat5a protein (Fig. 1C and Ref. 17John S. Vinkemeier U. Soldaini E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1910-1918Google Scholar), and this material was therefore used in subsequent DNA binding experiments. The Phe77 and Phe81 mutants of Stat1 or Stat5a/b, respectively, were tyrosine phosphorylated in response to cytokine stimulation of cells and bound to a single optimal GAS site (M67 and MGF, respectively) similar to wild type, as did recombinant Stat5aF81A (Fig. 1, D, E, and left panel of F). Next, we tested the ability to form tetramers on tandem GAS sites by EMSA analysis. For Stat5 we used an oligonucleotide containing tandemly linked GAS motifs, derived from the IL-2 response element that is contained in both the murine and human genes coding for the α-subunit of the IL-2 receptor, termed PRRIII. We and others (17John S. Vinkemeier U. Soldaini E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1910-1918Google Scholar, 28Soldaini E. John S. Moro S. Bollenbacher J. Schindler U. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 389-401Google Scholar, 29Meyer W.K. Reichenbach P. Schindler U. Soldaini E. Nabholz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31821-31828Google Scholar) have previously shown that binding of endogenous Stat5 to isolated single GAS sites from PRRIII is not discernable, but an oligonucleotide comprising full-length PRRIII binds Stat5a and Stat5b as tetramers (Fig. 1F). Consistent with previous observations (28Soldaini E. John S. Moro S. Bollenbacher J. Schindler U. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 389-401Google Scholar), tetramerization of Stat5b on PRRIII was weak compared with Stat5a (Fig. 1F, left panel). In contrast to wild type Stat5a/b, mutation of residue Phe81 to Ala caused a loss of tetramer formation as indicated by the inability to bind to the tandemly linked GAS motifs in PRRIII (Fig. 1F, left panel). In addition to nuclear extracts from reconstituted 293T cells, we used purified recombinant Stat5a proteins to explore binding to the PRRIII probe, which confirmed the tetramerization defect of the Stat5aF81A mutant (Fig. 1F, right panel). EMSA analysis with tandem binding sites was also performed with Stat1WT and Stat1F77A (Fig. 1G). An artificial construct containing two high affinity GAS sites from the human IRF-1 promoter (5′-TTCCCCGAA) was used in these experiments. Stat1 can bind independently to either site, resulting in both a fast migrating Stat1/DNA-complex containing a single Stat1 dimer as well as a slow migrating complex with two Stat1 dimers. When such complexes were challenged for 30 min with a 750-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide, the dimeric complexes of both wild type and mutant were displaced. However, the tetrameric complex resisted displacement only with Stat1WT, whereas the respective complex of the F77A mutant was dispelled (Fig. 1G), indicating that adjacent dimers of Stat1F77A interacted only weakly via stabilizing contacts. To further explore DNA binding and tetramerization of Stat1, we included in our analysis another three 41-mer oligonucleotides. Two of them each contained a single canonical GAS site (5′-TTCCCGGAA), and a second site 11 bp away that was either unrelated (non-GAS; 5′-TCGTTGTCA) or bore little resemblance to GAS sites (GAS-like; 5′-TTATCATTA). Additionally, a 41-mer without sequences resembling GAS elements was used (see “Experimental Procedures”). We used in vitro tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat1 at a concentration of 1 nm for these experiments (which is also the apparent equilibrium constant of the Stat1 DNA-binding reaction; see Ref. 18Vinkemeier U. Cohen S.L. Moarefi I. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5616-5626Google Scholar). The results are shown in Fig. 1, H and I. Expectedly, a fast migrating band of dimeric Stat1 bound to canonical GAS sites was seen (Fig. 1H, lanes 2-5). Strikingly, Stat1 tetramers formed not only with the tandem canonical GAS sites (Fig. 1H, lane 2) but also with the 41-mer oligonucleotides that harbored only a single GAS site (Fig. 1H, lanes 4 and 5). DNA binding of Stat1 was observed even in the complete absence of any GAS resemblance of the DNA, but binding was confined to tetramers (Fig. 1H, lane 6). Of note, tetramerization required the presence of a DNA stretch, as no band indicative of tetramer formation was seen with a short 28-mer oligonucleotide containing a single binding site (Fig. 1H, lane 3). Importantly, the mutant F77A did not form tetramers on DNA where a single high affinity GAS site was adjacent to a GAS-like site (5′-TTATCATTA) (Fig. 1I, compare with Fig. 1G, where oligonucleotides containing tandem canonical GAS sites were used). Thus, N-domain interactions of DNA-bound Stat molecules made tetramerization possible even in the presence of only a single canonical GAS site. In summary, these data revealed that the phenylalanine residues in position 81 of Stat5 and 77 of Stat1 maintain N-domain interactions. We thus conclude that the recently identified alternate interface is physiologically relevant. Tetramerization Deficiency Is Associated with Prolonged Nuclear Accumulation—The molecular mechanisms underlying nuclear accumulation of Stat1 were elucidated very recently (7Meyer T. Marg A. Lemke P. Wiesner B. Vinkemeier U. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1992-2005Google Scholar). It was shown that Stat1 can leave the nucleus only after its tyrosine dephosphorylation, and DNA binding was identified as the critical regulator of the conversion. Importantly, impaired DNA binding resulted in shortened nuclear retention. Thus, we investigated nuclear accumulation of the tetramerization-deficient Stat1F77A mutant, expecting diminished nuclear retention due to the negative effect that the mutation exerted on DNA binding. Surprisingly, our expectations were not met, as we observed a markedly prolonged accumulation phase in IFNγ-stimulated cells (Fig. 2A). Moreover, we observed a distinct insensitivity to pharmacological kinase inactivation, since nuclear accumulation of the mutant persisted also in the presence of staurosporine (Fig. 2B). This is in stark contrast to wild type Stat1, where staurosporine caused a rapid collapse of nuclear accumulation (Fig. 2B). We then employed an antibody microinjection assay to explore the rate of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of GFP-tagged Stat1 during nuclear accumulation (7Meyer T. Marg A. Lemke P. Wiesner B. Vinkemeier U. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1992-2005Google Scholar, 26Meyer T. Begitt A. Lödige I. van Rossum M. Vinkemeier U. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 344-354Google Scholar). It was previously demonstrated that antibody microinjection can cause precipitation of the targeted molecule. In the case of a shuttling protein this lead to the depletion of the respective molecule from the non-injected compartment (26Meyer T. Begitt A. Lödige I. van Rossum M. Vinkemeier U. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 344-354Google Scholar). This is shown in Fig. 2C for Stat1WT during its nuclear accumulation in interferon-γ stimulated cells. Strikingly, the nuclear retention time during IFNγ-induced accumulation was considerably extended for mutant Stat1, as it was impossible to achieve its clearance from the nucleus after cytoplasmic microinjection of a GFP antibody (Fig. 2C). According to our previous results the intranuclear mobility of Stat1 is inversely correlated with the strength of DNA binding (7Meyer T. Marg A. Lemke P. Wiesner B. Vinkemeier U. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1992-2005Google Scholar). We employed FRAP analysis to examine this also for Stat1F77A (Table I). Expectedly, both the mutant and wild type Stat1 were highly mobile during nuclear accumulation, and the mobility was reduced only modestly by the inactivation of tyrosine phosphatases. Notably, though, the mutant was even less sensitive to phosphatase inhibition, as its mobility remained significantly higher than wild type (Table I). These results indicated that the prolonged nuclear accumulation period of the mutant Stat1F77A was uncoupled both from DNA binding capacity and reduced intranuclear mobility. The mutant thus differed from the nuclear retention mutants described to date (7Meyer T. Marg A. Lemke P. Wiesner B. Vinkemeier U. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1992-2005Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether the loss of nuclear accumulation that was previously observed with the DNA binding mutant Stat1-DNAminus, which has lost b"

Gcn4p is a transcriptional activator of hundreds of genes involved in remedying nutrient deprivation. In addition to a conserved kinase domain, Gcn2p has a regulatory region homologous to histidyl tRNA synthetase enzymes that binds uncharged tRNA that accumulates during amino acid starvation. Flanking the carboxyl terminus of the histidyl-tRNA synthetase-related domain is a region spanning 162 residues that participates in the activation of the protein kinase. Gel filtration and chemical cross-linking analysis of the recombinant carboxyl-terminal Gcn2 protein revealed that this region is a stable homodimer that is highly resistant to high concentrations of salt. Residue alterations in three hydrophobic segments and one segment with a proposed amphipathic α-helix in this Gcn2p carboxyl terminus blocked oligomerization, supporting the role of hydrophobic interactions in the dimerization interface of Gcn2p. Introduction of residue substitutions that impaired dimerization into the full-length protein prevented the ability of Gcn2p to phosphorylate its substrate eukaryotic initiation factor-2α and induce GCN4 translational expression in yeast cells subjected to a variety of stresses including amino acid limitation or exposure to rapamycin or high levels of NaCl. This latter stress can be overcome by addition of increasing amounts of K+ ions, indicating that the Na+/K+ ion balance is central to this stress induction. We conclude that dimerization involving hydrophobic segments in the carboxyl-terminal region is required for activation of Gcn2p in response to a multitude of stresses.

We conclude that dimerization involving hydrophobic segments in the carboxyl-terminal region is required for activation of Gcn2p in response to a multitude of stresses. Environmental stresses induce a program of gene expression designed to remedy the underlying cellular disturbance. An important example of such a stress response is the general amino acid control pathway in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1Wek R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 491-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 2Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol.

Eukaryotic Cell. 2002; 1: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In the general control pathway, starvation for any one of several different amino acids induces a collection of genes involved predominantly in the metabolism of amino acids and the salvaging of nutrients important for renewal. The mechanism by which amino acid starvation induces this program of stress gene expression involves phosphorylation of the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF2) 1The abbreviations used are: eIF2, eukaryotic initiation factor-2; HisRS, histidyl-tRNA synthetase; 3-AT, 3-aminotriazole; ORF, open reading frame; PKR, double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase. by protein kinase Gcn2p (4Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The eIF2 complexed with GTP and initiator Met-tRNAMeti participates in the ribosomal selection of the start codon (5Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 33-88Google Scholar). During this translation initiation process, the GTP associated with eIF2 is hydrolyzed to GDP, and eIF2 is released from the ribosome. A guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B, is required to recycle eIF2-GDP to the active eIF2-GTP form (5Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 33-88Google Scholar). Gcn2p phosphorylation of eIF2α at Ser-51 converts this initiation factor from a substrate to an inhibitor of the eIF2B, thereby reducing the levels of eIF2-GTP available for translation initiation (2Hinnebusch A.G.

Biol. 2001; 21: 5018-5030Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Lowered levels of eIF2-GTP enhance the translational expression of Gcn4p, a basic zipper transcriptional activator of hundreds of genes important for alleviation of nutrient deprivation (3Hinnebusch A.G. Natarajan K. Eukaryotic Cell. 2002; 1: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). We have been interested in the mechanisms by which Gcn2p is activated during amino acid starvation. Mutations in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase genes, such as HTS1 important for charging of tRNAHis, elicit the general control response in yeast even in the presence of abundant cognate amino acids (9Wek S.A. Zhu S. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4497-4506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This observation supports the idea that increased levels of uncharged tRNA that accumulate during severe amino acid depletion is the direct signal activating the general control pathway. Gcn2p activation by elevated levels of uncharged tRNA involves direct binding of tRNA to a regulatory domain of Gcn2p with sequence homology to the entire length of the HisRS enzymes (9Wek S.A. Zhu S. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4497-4506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wek R.C. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1425-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Such binding is thought to be obligate for Gcn2p activity, as residue substitutions in the HisRS-related domain that impair binding to uncharged tRNA block Gcn2p phosphorylation of eIF2α in vitro and in vivo (9Wek S.A. Zhu S. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4497-4506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Dong J. Qiu H. Garcia-Barrio M. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24989-24994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Gcn2p binding with uncharged tRNA is not restricted to uncharged tRNAHis, however, suggesting that the HisRS-related domain has diverged sufficiently from the bona fide HisRS enzyme so that it can bind to many different uncharged tRNA species that amass during amino acid starvation conditions. Gcn2p appears to have reduced affinity for aminoacylated tRNA in vitro, consistent with the idea that it is activated by only uncharged tRNA (11Dong J. Qiu H. Garcia-Barrio M. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 269-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Activation of Gcn2p by uncharged tRNA is proposed to involve a transition from an inhibited to a catalytically active conformation that is signaled by direct contacts between the protein kinase domain, HisRS-regulatory region, and the extreme carboxyl terminus of Gcn2p (12Qiu H. Dong J. Francklyn C.S. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1425-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 14Qiu H. Garcia-Barrio M.T. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell.

Accompanying this activated Gcn2p conformation is autophosphorylation at threonine residues 882 and 887 in the so-called activation loop between kinase sub-domains VII and VIII (16Romano P.R. Garcia-Barrio M.T. Zhang X. Wang Q. Taylor D.R. Zhang F. Herring C. Mathews M.B. Qin J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2282-2297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This autophosphorylation may occur in trans between Gcn2p dimers. Gcn2p is thought to retain its induced eIF2 kinase activity until it is dephosphorylated by protein phosphatases (17Wek R.C. Cannon J.F. Dever T.E. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5700-5710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The extreme carboxyl terminus of Gcn2p is suggested to have multiple functions in this regulatory mechanism. First, the carboxyl terminus facilitates Gcn2p association with ribosomes (18Ramirez M. Wek R.C. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3027-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 19Zhu S. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1808-1814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Substitutions of three lysine residues in the carboxyl-terminal segment selectively block interaction between Gcn2p and 60 S ribosomal subunits and reduce eIF2 phosphorylation by Gcn2p in response to amino acid limitation. A second interface with ribosomes involves the amino terminus of Gcn2p that interacts with the Gcn1p-Gcn20p complex (20Kubota H. Obata T. Ota K. Sasaki T. Ito T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20457-20460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 21Garcia-Barrio M. Dong J. Ulfano S. Hinnebusch A.G.

This complex is proposed to channel uncharged tRNA evicted from the A site of the ribosome to the HisRS-related domain of Gcn2p, contributing to the active conformation of this eIF2 kinase. Based on yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation analyses, the carboxyl terminus of Gcn2p is suggested to interact with multiple regions of Gcn2p, possibly contributing to the activated and inhibitory Gcn2p conformations (14Qiu H. Garcia-Barrio M.T. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2697-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A final proposed role for the extreme carboxyl terminus of Gcn2p is to facilitate binding of the HisRS-related domain to uncharged tRNA (11Dong J. Qiu H. Garcia-Barrio M. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 269-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). We wished to address the contribution of dimerization to Gcn2p regulation of GCN4 translation. Our analyses of 16 different mutants indicate that hydrophobic interactions in the carboxyl-terminal region form the dimerization interface of Gcn2p. Impaired Gcn2p dimerization blocked activation of its eIF2 kinase activity and subsequent enhanced GCN4 expression in response to amino acid limitation or exposure to rapamycin or high levels of Na+. During this latter stress, we found that a reduced K+ level also enhances GCN4 translation, indicating that the Na+/K+ ion balance is central to this stress induction. Together, our results suggest that dimerization along with Gcn2p protein kinase and HisRS-related functions are required for activation of Gcn2p in response to diverse stress conditions. Strains and Plasmid Constructions—Yeast strains F113 (MATa ino1 ura3 can1), JC482 (MATα ura3-52 leu2 his4-359), and EG328-1A (MATα ura3-52 leu2 trp1) were described by Yang et al. (24Yang R. Wek S.A.

Plasmid p180 encoding Gcn4-LacZ and the full complement of upstream ORFs was introduced into strains EG328-1A (RY74) and into RY139 (RY76). Similarly plasmid p277 encoding Gcn4-LacZ devoid of upstream ORFs was introduced into EG328-1A (RY75) and into RY139 (RY77). Strain EG328-1A was transformed with DNA fragments containing the LEU2, TRP1, or URA3 genes, generating strain KY286 (MATα ura3-52 LEU2 trp1). Strain KY328 (MATα URA3 LEU2 TRP1) was derived from KY286 by co-transforming with DNA fragments containing URA3 and TRP1 gene to obtain a prototrophic strain. Strain KY499 is a LEU2 and TRP1 derivative of EG328-1A that contains p180. Plasmid p722 is a low copy number yeast plasmid encoding the entire GCN2 gene and the selectable marker URA3 (27Wek R.C.

Plasmid p540 was used to express a polyhistidine-tagged version of the carboxyl terminus of Gcn2p, from residues 1498 to 1659, in Escherichia coli using the T7 promoter system. Construction of plasmid p540 involved generation of a 500-bp DNA fragment by the PCR amplification method using a 5′-primer designed to introduce an NdeI restriction site just prior to the GCN2 codon 1498, and a 3′-primer containing a BamHI site following the GCN2 termination codon. The PCR DNA product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and inserted between these same restriction sites in a modified version of the T7 expression vector pET-15b (Invitrogen). GCN2 carboxyl-terminal mutants were constructed using oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutation and the Quickchange kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). Mutated GCN2 DNA was sequenced to ensure only the desired changes were made. The altered GCN2 sequences were introduced into p540 for expression of Gcn2-Cp in E. coli and into full-length GCN2 in p722 for complementation analysis in yeast. Plasmid p722 and its derivatives were introduced into yeast strain RY139 (MATα ura3-52 leu2 trp1 gcn2::LEU2) by selecting for uracil prototrophy. Plasmid pSZ-3 encodes the Gcn2-Cp residues 1536–1659 in a modified version of the pET-15b vector (19Zhu S. Wek R.C. J. Biol.

Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17297) Google Scholar) using the website (us.expasy.org/tools/pscale/Hphob.Doolittle.html). Secondary structure predictions were carried out using the web site (npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr/cgi-bin/secpred_sopma.pl) (29Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Deléage G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). The plasmid p245 used for the expression of the polyhistidine-tagged HisRS +C has been described earlier (9Wek S.A. Zhu S. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4497-4506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid p630 is a high copy number plasmid encoding the full-length wild type GCN2 gene and includes a URA3 gene as a selectable marker (27Wek R.C. Ramirez M. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2820-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Plasmid p180 encodes Gcn4-LacZ with the entire GCN4 5′-noncoding region with four upstream ORFs inserted into YCp50 (30Mueller P.P. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1986; 45: 201-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Ycp50 is a low copy number plasmid marked with URA3, and plasmid p227 is a similar construct with mutations in the initiation codon of each of the four upstream ORFs of GCN4. Plasmid pYB41 includes this same GCN4-lacZ fusion with the four upstream ORFs intact in the low copy number TRP1-based plasmid pRS314 (24Yang R. Wek S.A. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2706-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Plasmid pYB41 was introduced into strain RY139 containing wild type GCN2 encoded in p722 or its carboxylterminal mutant derivatives. Expression and Purification of Gcn2-C Proteins—The plasmid p540 derivatives encoding wild type or mutant versions of Gcn2-Cp were transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) (F– ompTr –B containing lysogen DE3), and the transformants were grown at 37 °C with shaking in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin until an A600 between 0.4 and 0.6. 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside was added to the cultures, and after further incubation at 37 °C for 3 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in Buffer A solution (20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 500 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol) containing 10 mm imidazole and lysed using a French press. After centrifugation of the lysate, the supernatant was applied to nickelnitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) equilibrated with Buffer A and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The resin was washed with Buffer A solution containing 50 mm imidazole, and the polyhistidine-tagged Gcn2-C proteins were eluted with buffer A solution containing 200 mm imidazole. Gcn2-C proteins were separated by electrophoresis using SDS-polyacrylamide gels (14% polyacrylamide) and visualized by staining with Coomassie R-250. Gcn2-Cp was also visualized by immunoblot analysis using polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes the polyhistidine tag (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody, and chemifluorescent substrate. Gel Filtration Analysis—A Superdex-200 (S-200) analytical sizing column (10 mm × 30 cm) (Amersham Biosciences) connected to an fast protein liquid chromatography system was used for determination of the molecular weights of the Gcn2-C proteins. The column was calibrated using gel filtration standards in a 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) solution containing 50 mm NaCl (low salt), 1 m NaCl (high salt), or 50 mm ethylene glycol. The low and high molecular weight gel filtration standards (Amersham Biosciences) and the Gcn2-Cps were analyzed under identical conditions (0.4–0.5 ml/min, 200-μl sample load), and their relative mobilities were calculated as the ratio of (Ve–Vo) to (Vt–Vo), where Ve, Vo, and Vt are the elution, void, and total bed volumes, respectively. The molecular weight of the Gcn2-C proteins was then determined by comparison of their relative mobility to a straight line plot determined for the standards. Gcn2-Cp was visualized by using SDS-polyacrylamide gels (14% polyacrylamide), followed by Coomassie R-250 staining, or by immunoblot analysis. To disrupt the Gcn2-Cp dimer, ethylene glycol or SDS was added to the gel filtration buffer solution at a concentration of 50 mm or 0.1% (w/v), respectively. Chemical Cross-linking—The purified Gcn2-Cp solutions were buffer-exchanged to remove imidazole and Tris components that could interfere with the cross-linking reaction (31Ho C.K. Shuman S. Virology. 1996; 217: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing purified Gcn2-Cp in a solution of 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 50 mm or 1 m NaCl, and glutaraldehyde (Sigma) at the indicated concentrations (% v/v) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The chemical cross-linked samples were then denatured in 2% SDS and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (14% polyacrylamide gel). Gcn2 proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie R-250, silver stain, or by immunoblotting with antibody specific to the polyhistidine tag of the recombinant Gcn2-Cp. Thrombin cleavage to remove the polyhistidine tag from the recombinant Gcn2-Cp was carried out in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.9) solution containing 10 mm CaCl2 for 30 min at 4 °C. Completion of thrombin cleavage reaction was verified by a faster migrating polypeptide by SDS-PAGE gel and Coomassie staining and the absence of recognition in an immunoblot using a polyhistidine-specific antibody. GCN2 Complementation in Yeast—To measure Gcn2p function, RY139 cells each expressing different GCN2 alleles were grown to saturation in synthetic medium containing 2% glucose (SD) supplemented with the required amino acids (32Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 207-217Google Scholar). Cultures were diluted to an A600 of 0.25, and 7 μl of the samples were spotted onto agar plates containing SD medium supplemented with all 20 amino acids (SC), medium supplemented with 30 mm 3-aminotriazole, and all amino acids except histidine (SC + 3-AT) or SC medium containing 200–400 ng/ml rapamycin (SC + Rap) or 1 m NaCl (SC + NaCl). Alternatively, samples were spotted onto enriched medium YPD (32Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 207-217Google Scholar). Plates were incubated at 30 °C, and growth was monitored over a period of 4–6 days. Immunoblot Analysis—RY139-derived cells expressing the indicated GCN2 allele were grown to mid-logarithmic phase in SD medium supplemented with leucine, isoleucine, valine, and tryptophan at 30 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold water, and resuspended in a solution of 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors (100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 μm aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin), and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF and 40 mm β-glycerophosphate). Cells were lysed by using glass beads and vortexing for 2 min at 15-s intervals while maintaining the samples on ice. After a 2000 × g centrifugation to remove the glass beads and cell debris, the lysate was subjected to centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min. The protein content of the cell lysate was measured using the Bradford method and bovine serum albumin as a standard (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of each protein sample were separated by electrophoresis in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (12% polyacrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Broad range polypeptide markers (Bio-Rad) were used to measure the molecular weight of proteins. Immunoblot analyses were carried out using a polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated eIF2α at Ser-51 (Research Genetics or StressGen), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, and chemiluminescent substrate. To measure total levels of eIF2α, the same nitrocellulose membrane was stripped using a solution of 70 mm Tris (pH 6.7), 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS, and reprobed using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against recombinant yeast eIF2α (9Wek S.A. Zhu S. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4497-4506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gcn2p levels were measured in strain RY139 containing p722 and its derivatives encoding wild type or mutant forms of GCN2 and pYB41. The cells were harvested in mid-logarithmic phase as before, and cell pellets were washed in ice-cold water. Due to observed high levels of degradation of full-length GCN2, the cell pellets were boiled for 10 min immediately after the washing step. Protease inhibitors were added to the cell preparation, and the cells were lysed by using glass beads and vortexing. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and 40 μg of protein samples were separated using SDS-PAGE (7% polyacrylamide). Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and Gcn2p was visualized using Gcn2p-specific antibody that was generously provided by Dr. Alan Hinnebusch (National Institutes of Health). Gcn4-lacZ Enzyme Assay—RY139 strains expressing wild type or mutant versions of Gcn2p and Gcn4-LacZ were grown to mid-logarithmic phase and then shifted to SD medium containing 30 mm 3-AT, 1 m NaCl, 200 ng/ml rapamycin, or no stress agent. Following incubation at 30 °C, the non-stressed cells were harvested after 4 h, and stressed cells were collected after 6 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 250 μl of breaking solution (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20% glycerol, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and broken using glass beads and vortexing. Cell lysates were collected and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g. To measure the β-galactosidase enzyme activity, 20 μl of extract was added to 980 μlof Z-buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 10 mm KCl, 2 mm Mg2SO4, 4.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and the reaction was initiated by the addition of a 200-μl solution of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (4 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside in Z-buffer). The reaction was terminated following 20 and 60 min of incubation at 28 °C by adding 0.5 ml of 1 m Na2CO3, and the absorbance of the reaction mixture was measured at A420. Enzyme activity is represented as the nanomoles of o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside hydrolyzed per min per mg of total protein. Total protein concentration of the clarified lysate was determined as mg/ml using the Bradford method. Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation—EG328-1A-derived cells were grown in SD medium with the required amino acid supplements and harvested in mid-logarithmic phase. Just prior to harvesting, 50 μg/ml of cycloheximide was added to retain polysomes as described (18Ramirez M. Wek R.C. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3027-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Lysate preparation and sucrose gradient analyses were carried out as described previously (18Ramirez M. Wek R.C. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3027-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 19Zhu S. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1808-1814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition to cycloheximide, cells lysate preparations contained 10 mm MgCl2, required for association of ribosomal subunits. Aliquots of 20–25 A260 units were applied to 11.5 ml of 5–47% sucrose gradients and subjected to centrifugation at 39,000 rpm for 3 h in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 4 °C. Gradients were fractionated into 0.6-ml aliquots, and trichloroacetic acid-precipitated proteins from each fraction were analyzed by immunoblot using polyclonal antibody specific to Gcn2p. Carboxyl Terminus of Gcn2p Forms a Stable Dimer—The carboxyl terminus of Gcn2p has been implicated in multiple functions in the mechanisms activating this eIF2 kinase in response to amino acid starvation (Fig. 1). To discern the role of the carboxyl terminus of Gcn2p in oligomerization, we expressed a recombinant protein containing Gcn2p residues 1498–1659 using the T7 promoter system in E. coli. This recombinant protein, we refer to as Gcn2-Cp, was purified using an amino-terminal polyhistidine sequence and nickel chelation resin (Fig. 1). Purified Gcn2-Cp was analyzed using an S-200 gel filtration column and found to elute in a buffer solution containing 50 mm NaCl with a molecular weight of 44,000, consistent with a dimer (Fig. 2, A and D). The carboxyl terminus of Gcn2p was suggested to interact with itself in a yeast two-hybrid analysis, and deletion of sequences extending to residue 1536 reduced this association (14Qiu H. Garcia-Barrio M.T. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell"
https://openalex.org/W2111100327,"Anthrax lethal toxin (LT), a critical virulence factor for Bacillus anthracis, has been demonstrated to cleave and to inactivate mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAPKKs) that propagate prosurvival signals in macrophages (1-5). Whether this action of anthrax LT leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines by macrophages has been more controversial (6, 7). We now report that anthrax LT treatment leads to the specific extracellular release of interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18 by the murine macrophage cell lines, RAW264.7 and J774A.1. Studies of the processing of IL-1beta reveal that the levels of activated/cleaved IL-1beta in RAW264.7 and J774.A1 cells are increased following treatment with anthrax LT. Enhanced processing of IL-1beta directly correlates with increased levels in the activation of its upstream regulator, IL-1beta-converting enzyme/Caspase-1 (ICE). The extracellular release of IL-1beta and IL-18 in response to anthrax LT is ICE-dependent, as an ICE-specific inhibitor blocks this process. These data indicate that ICE, IL-1beta, and IL-18 are downstream effectors of anthrax LT in macrophages, providing the basis for new bioassays for anthrax LT activity and representing potential therapeutic targets."

These hydrolases contain non-catalytic carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) that, by bringing the appended catalytic domain into intimate association with its insoluble substrate, greatly potentiate catalysis.

Cleft B is solvent-exposed and, therefore, able to bind ligands because the loop, which occludes this region in other CBM6 proteins, is much shorter and flexible (lacks a conserved proline) in CmCBM6. Subsites 2 and 3 of cleft B accommodate cellobiose (Glc-β-1,4-Glc), subsite 4 will bind only to a β-1,3-linked glucose, whereas subsite 1 can interact with either a β-1,3- or β-1,4-linked glucose.

The specific recognition of carbohydrates by proteins is central to many biological processes including cell signaling, host-pathogen interactions, and the microbial recycling of carbon from the plant cell wall (1Brett C.T. Waldren K. Physiology and Biochemistry of Plant Cell Walls. Chapman & Hall, London1996Google Scholar). The microbial enzymes involved in plant cell wall degradation frequently display a modular structure in which non-catalytic carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) 1The abbreviation used is: CBM, carbohydrate binding module. 1The abbreviation used is: CBM, carbohydrate binding module. are linked to the catalytic module. The role of the CBMs is mainly to target the enzymes to specific structural polysaccharides and enhance catalytic efficiency by increasing the effective concentration of the enzyme on the surface of these insoluble substrates (2Gilbert H.J.

CBMs are grouped into sequenced families, which may be found as part of a continuously updated carbohydrate-active enzyme data base at afmb.cnrsmrs.fr/CAZY. The structures of CBMs from 22 of the 34 known CBM families have been determined, and the majority of these modules have a “jelly roll” fold composed almost exclusively of β-strands (Ref. 2Gilbert H.J.

In contrast to all other CBM families, the CBM6 modules contain two clefts that could potentially function as ligand binding sites. Cleft B is located on the concave surface of one β-sheet, whereas cleft A is found in the loop region connecting the inner and outer β-sheets of the jelly roll fold. Cleft B is in a similar location to the ligand binding sites of CBMs from several other families that include CBM22, CBM4, CBM29, and CBM17 (13Charnock S.J. Bolam D.N. Turkenburg J.P. Gilbert H.J.

NMR and mutagenesis studies on CtCBM6 and the resolution of the structure of CsCBM6 in complex with xylotriose revealed that in both proteins the xylo-configured ligands bind exclusively to cleft A; however, it was suggested that cleft B may play a role in carbohydrate recognition in family 6 proteins that display specificities distinct from CtCBM6 and CsCBM6. To address this issue we have analyzed the structural basis for the ligand specificity displayed by the C-terminal CBM6 (CmCBM6-2) of endoglucanase 5A from Cellvibrio mixtus. The accompanying paper (29Henshaw J. Bolam D.N. Pires V.M.R. Czjzek M. Henrissat B. Ferreira L.M.A. Fontes C.M.G.A. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol.

Only cleft B, however, interacts with β(1,4)(1,3)-mixed linked glucans such as lichenan and barley β-glucan, supporting the hypothesis that variation in ligand specificity within the CBM6 family reflects the functionality of the two potential carbohydrate binding clefts. Here we define the structural determinants for the distinct ligand specificity displayed by cleft A and cleft B in CmCBM6-2. Furthermore, by solving the structure of CtCBM6 with a xylooligosaccharide that occupies the complete binding site, we provide insight into the mechanism by which cleft A in family 6 CBMs can distinguish between gluco- and xylo-configured ligands.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCrystallization—Crystals of CmCBM6-2 (40 mg/ml) were grown from hanging drops in 12% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000 and 2.2 m NaCl. They belonged to space group P212121 with unit cell parameters a = 63.11 Å, b = 66.96 Å, and c = 85.39 Å, suggesting a Vm value of 3.3 Å3/Da with 2 molecules in the asymmetric unit. Co-crystallization of CmCBM6-2 with xylotetraose, cellobiose, and a mixed β-(1,4)(1,3)-linked glucan (Glc-4Glc-3Glc-4Glc-(1)-OMe, see Fig. 1; in all cases the ligand concentrations were ∼2 mm) yielded crystals in 11% polyethylene glycol 6000 and 2.0 m NaCl, whereas the complexes of CmCBM6-2 with two mixed β-(1,3)(1,4)-linked glucans (Glc-3Glc-4Glc-3Glc and Glc-4Glc-3Glc-4Glc-OMe; Fig. 1), cellobiose and cellotriose, were obtained by soaking experiments. In the latter case native crystals were transferred into 20-μl drops of mother liquor containing 10% glycerol and ∼2-3 mm of oligosaccharides. After 20-30 min of soaking the crystals were mounted in a cryo loop and frozen in a 100 K nitrogen stream.All crystals except those with Glc-4Glc-3Glc-4Glc-OMe belonged to the same space group as the native crystals and had approximately the same unit cell parameters (Table I). The co-crystals of CmCBM6-2 with Glc-4Glc-3Glc-4Glc-OMe belonged to space group P22121 with unit cell parameters a = 31.69 Å, b = 37.93 Å, and c = 102.41 Å, leading to a Vm value of 2.2 Å3/Da, with one molecule in the asymmetric unit.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsCtCBM6 xylopentaoseCmCBM6CmCBM6 cellobioseCmCBM6 cellotrioseCmCBM6 xylotetraoseCmCBM6 G3G4G3GCmCBM6G4G3G4GBeamlineID14-EH1ID14-EH1ID14-EH1ID14-EH1ID29ID14-EH1ID14-EH3Wavelength0.9340.9340.9340.9340.9790.9340.931Space groupP21P212121P212121P212121P212121P212121P22121Unit cell parameters (Å)a = 27.4863.1163.5563.3364.0163.5431.69b = 51.6866.9667.6567.6467.3967.5937.93c = 36.1385.3985.2985.3085.2485.31102.41β = 102.78Resolution (Å)1.601.401.471.471.601.651.90RsymaRsym=∑[Ii−⟨I⟩]/∑[⟨I⟩], where i is the ith measurement, and ⟨i⟩ is the weighted mean of I.

Open table in a new tab Co-crystals of CtCBM6 (10 mg/ml) with xylopentaose were obtained in hanging drops made of 2 μl of a protein/xylopentaose mixture (∼2mm oligosaccharide) and 2 μl of reservoir solution containing 20% polyethylene glycol 1000, 0.2 m sodium acetate, and 0.1 m acetate buffer at pH 4.6. The crystals grew after 10 months at 4 °C. Here, the crystals belonged to space group P21 with unit cell parameters a = 27.48 Å, b = 51.68 Å, c = 36.13, and β = 102.78°. The Vm value was calculated to be 1.9 Å3/Da with 1 molecule in the asymmetric unit.Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—All crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution comprised of the growth buffer supplemented with 15% (v/v) glycerol. Subsequently the crystals, mounted in cryo loops, were flash-frozen in a cold nitrogen stream at 100 K. The different complex data sets were collected at beamlines ID29, ID14-EH1, and ID14-EH3 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facilities, Grenoble, France. The details of data collection statistics are resumed in Table I. The data were processed and reduced with MOSFLM (17Powell H.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 1690-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), and all further computing used the CCP4 (18Collaborative Computational Project No. 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19702) Google Scholar) suite unless otherwise stated. The crystal structure of CmCBM6-2 was solved by the molecular replacement method using the program AMoRe (19Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar) and the coordinates of the CsCBM6 (Protein Data Bank code 1nae) as the molecular starting model. Two solutions, corresponding to the two molecules in the asymmetric unit, gave a correlation coefficient of 22% and an R-factor of 53%. The model building was performed with ARP/wARP (20Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) using the complete data set at 1.40 Å. Then the structure was refined with REFMAC5 (18Collaborative Computational Project No. 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19702) Google Scholar) to a final R-factor of 16.07% and Rfree factor of 17.76%. All complex structures having the same space group as the native protein were directly submitted to a first refinement cycle with REFMAC5 before manually constructing the substrate molecules using the program TURBO (21Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory 88. Mountain View, CA, 1991Google Scholar) and adding the water molecules. The same set of reflections was flagged for the calculation of the free R value for these complexes. Because the co-crystals of the CtCBM6 with xylopentaose did not have the same space group as the native crystals, molecular replacement with AMoRe was applied to position the protein molecules correctly in the new unit cell. The same strategy was applied to solve the structure of the crystals of CmCBM6-2 in complex with Glc-4Glc-3Glc-4Glc-OMe. All structures were refined with REFMAC5. The final refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. All coordinates of the different structures have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank with accession codes as follows: CtCBM6 with xylopentaose, 1uxx; native CmCBM6-2, 1uxz; CmCBM6-2 with cellobiose/cellotriose, 1uxy/1uyy; CmCBM6-2 with Glc-4Glc-3Glc-4Glc-OMe, 1uz0; CmCBM6-2 with Glc-3Glc-4Glc-3Glc, 1uy0; CmCBM6-2 with xylotetraose, 1uyz.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONStructure of CmCBM6-2—The unliganded structure of Cm- CBM6-2 was solved by molecular replacement using the x-ray structure of CsCBM6-3 (RCSB Protein Data Bank code 1nae) and refined to a resolution of 1.40 Å. The final model of Cm- CBM6-2 comprised 2 copies of residues 1-133, 2 metal ions, and 390 water molecules. Both metal ions are common to CtCBM6, whereas CsCBM6-3 was reported to contain only one metal ion (12Boraston A.B. Notenboom V. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. Rose D.R. Davies G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In CmCBM6-2 the ions were modeled as Ca2+ and were both hepta-coordinated. In each case a single water molecule completes the coordination. The structure of Cm- CBM6-2 adopts a classical β-jelly roll fold, consisting predominantly of two five-stranded β-sheets (Fig. 2). The overall structure is very similar to the two xylan binding family 6 CBMs previously described, with a root mean square deviation value of 0.9 Å over 123 matched Cα atoms with CsCBM6-3 and a value of 1.1 Å over 125 matched Cα atoms with CtCBM6.Fig. 2Ribbon representation of CmCBM6-2 (left), CtCBM6 (middle), and CsCBM6-3, highlighting the region of cleft B for the three proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Interestingly, CmCBM6-2 has an exposed tryptophan residue in the region designated cleft B (Fig. 2), which is located in a shallow groove formed by one of the β-sheets, analogous to the location of the binding clefts of CBM4, CBM15, CBM17, CBM22, and CBM29 (13Charnock S.J.

By contrast, cleft B in both CsCBM6-3 and CtCBM6 is occluded from solvent by a proline residue in the neighboring surface loop and, thus, is not accessible to oligosaccharide or polysaccharide ligands. Furthermore CsCBM6-3 does not contain an aromatic residue in the equivalent position to Trp-39, which would further limit the capacity of cleft B in the C. stercorarium protein to bind ligand.The Complex of CtCBM6 with Xylopentaose—Previously, we have shown that CtCBM6 binds with high affinity to xylans (unsubstituted and highly decorated) and xylooligosaccharides displaying the highest affinity for ligands with a degree of polymerization ≥5, suggesting the presence of five sugar binding sites (11Czjzek M. Bolam D.N. Mosbah A. Allouch J. Fontes C.M. Ferreira L.M. Bornet O. Zamboni V. Darbon H. Smith N.L. Black G.W. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48580-48587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).The structure of CtCBM6 in complex with xylopentaose was determined to a 1.6-Å resolution (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Electron density for all five sugar units in xylopentaose was well defined, allowing unambiguous modeling of the pentasaccharide bound to cleft A (Fig. 3A). The direction of the sugar in the binding cleft was resolved by assessing the temperature factors and the level of electron density of the sugar C5 and O5 atoms and the hydrogen bonding of O5. Xylopentaose binds in an almost 3-fold helical orientation characterized by the internal hydrogen bond from O3n to O5n+1. The chair ring planes (defined by C2, C3, C5, and O5) of the three sugars Xyl2-4 (Xyl1 defines the reducing end of the ligand, and Xyl5 defines the non-reducing end) lie at angles of 89 and 84°, respectively. Xylan thus binds in its favored 3-fold helical conformation previously determined by x-ray fiber diffraction analysis of xylan (23Atkins E.D.T. Visser J. Beldman G. van Kusters S. Voragen A.G.L.

Such a conformation has previously been proposed for xylohexaose bound to CBM2b-1 from Cellulomonas fimi Xyn11A (24Simpson P.J. Xie H. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Williamson M.P. J. Biol.

This binding site, designated “cleft A,” from CsCBM6-3 binds to oligosaccharides derived from xylan and cellulose with similar affinities (12Boraston A.B. Notenboom V. Warren R.A. Kilburn D.G. Rose D.R. Davies G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), whereas in CtCBM6 cleft A accommodates primarily xylan and xylooligosaccharides (11Czjzek M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 48580-48587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The binding site (cleft A) is formed by two loops, residues 28-34 and 90-97, which contain two highly conserved aromatic residues, Tyr-33 and Trp-92, that stack against the α and β face of the central xylose of the pentasaccharide located in subsite 3, whereas Asn-120 forms a tight hydrogen bond (2.6 Å) with O3 of this sugar. It is interesting to note that although two aromatic residues are also involved in ligand binding in the xylan binding CBMs from family 2a and 15, these residues are in a perpendicular orientation with respect to each other and, by stacking against xylose residues n and n + 2, play a key role in defining a binding site topology that can accommodate ligands with a 3-fold helical conformation (22Szabo L.

Further subsites are formed in CtCBM6 by Asp-64 and Thr-65, which bind to the reducing end of the ligand at subsite 1, Pro-118 is at subsite 2, Ile-23 and Asn-93 form subsite 4, whereas Gly-24, Ser-26 (weakly; OG 3.9 Å and N 3.8 Å), and Asn-93 interact with the non-reducing end of xylopentaose at subsite 5 (Fig. 3, B and C). The distances of hydrogen bonds and close contact are summarized in Table II. On the basis of NMR data we had speculated that the surface loop from Gly-24 to Gly-33 might undergo a conformational change upon binding (11Czjzek M. Bolam D.N. Mosbah A. Allouch J. Fontes C.M.

Here we show that residues 25-27 undergo a positional shift, bringing Ser-26 (shifted by 4.1 Å) closer to the sugar at subsite 1 and, thus, facilitating the weak interaction between the hydroxy amino acid and O4 of the xylose at subsite 5. Although such conformational changes are likely to incur an energetic cost, which will lead to a reduction in overall affinity, the movement of the protein may reflect the heterogeneity of the xylan decorations. Thus, although the movement of Ser-26 is optimal for binding unsubstituted xylooligosaccharides, this amino acid may need to be more distant from the binding cleft to accommodate xylans that are decorated at O2 and/or O3.Table IIHydrogen bonds and close contacts of xylopentaose in cleft A of CtCBM6Cleft A subsite 1T65 Og1O1 3.0O2 2.5T65 NO2 3.1D64 NO2 3.5O3 3.6D64 Od1O2 2.7O3 3.9Cleft A subsite 3E36 OOw2.8-O2 2.8Y34 NO3 2.9N120 Od1O3 2.6N120 Nd2O3 3.7O4 3.3Cleft A subsite 4N120 Nd2O5 3.3N93 Nd2O3 3.1N93 Od1O3 3.9Cleft A subsite 5N93 Od1O5 3.6N93 Nd2O5 3.5S26 NO4 3.8T25 OO4 3.6G24 OO2 3.5G24 NO2 2.9 Open table in a new tab Previous studies show that CtCBM6 displays similar affinities for highly decorated and unsubstituted xylans (11Czjzek M.

https://openalex.org/W1992816352,"The growth hormone receptor (GHR) is a cell surface receptor that mediates the somatogenic and metabolic effects of the growth hormone (GH). GHR signaling is transduced via the receptor-associated cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase called Janus protein kinase 2 (JAK2). The major intracellular signaling systems activated by JAK2 in response to GH include the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1 and -2 pathways. In this report, we investigate the role of cholesterol-rich plasma membrane microdomains (caveolae and lipid rafts) in GH signaling. By subcellular fractionation of the GH-responsive 3T3-F442A murine preadipocyte, we found dramatic enrichment (6.7-fold) of plasma membrane GHR in the caveolae membranes (CM). JAK2 was also represented in the CM fraction, but was less enriched (2.5-fold) than GHR. ERK1/2 and the important ERK pathway upstream small adaptor protein, Grb2 (growth factor receptor-bound protein 2), were also enriched in caveolae (2.3- and 8.3-fold, respectively), but STAT5 was barely detected in the same fraction. Correspondingly, GH-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated GHR, JAK2, and ERK1/2 were highly represented in the CM fraction, whereas tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5 was enriched in the non-membranous fraction of the post-nuclear supernatant. Additionally, GH induced further accumulation of GHR, Grb2, and SHC proteins in the CM fraction. Interestingly, treatment of the cells with the caveolae-disrupting agent, methyl-β-cyclodextrin (mβCD), selectively inhibited GH-induced ERK1/2 activation but not STAT5 phosphorylation; repletion of cholesterol in mβCD-treated cells restored GH-induced ERK activation. Comparison of 3T3-F442A cells with the GHR-expressing human IM-9 lymphoblasts revealed similar enrichment of GHR in the lipid raft fraction of IM-9 as in the CM fraction of 3T3-F442A, but there were dramatic differences in the ERKs and Grb2. The IM-9 cell, in which ERKs are not activated by GH, displayed no enrichment of ERKs and Grb2 in the lipid raft fraction. Our results suggest that localization of GHRs in the CM fraction of the plasma membrane plays important roles in signaling."

Early IL-6 signaling events that ultimately lead to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) are poorly understood. The IL-6 receptor is composed of two α-chains (IL-6 receptor α, gp80, 80 kDa), which are the binding molecules, and two β-chains (gp130, 130 kDa), which are the signal transducers. IL-6 binding to its receptor triggers both the association of IL-6Rα with gp130 and gp130 phosphorylation. The binding and activation of Src homology- containing tyrosine phosphatase (SHP)-2 and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 are dependent on the phosphorylation of cytoplasmic gp130 domain residues Tyr-759 and Tyr-767, Tyr-814, Tyr-905, and Tyr-915, respectively (1Fukada T.

Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). In contrast to the ubiquitous expression pattern of Src, Yes, and Fyn, the expression of Hck is restricted to the hematopoietic system; specifically, Hck is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells of the myeloid and B-lymphoid lineages (4Quintrell N. Lebo R. Varmus H. Bishop J.M. Pettenati M.J. Le Beau M.M. Diaz M.O. Rowley J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2267-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 5Ziegler S.F. Marth J.D. Lewis D.B. Perlmutter R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2276-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In B-lymphoid lineages Hck is a common feature of pro-B-cells and its expression decreases with B-cell differentiation (6Taguchi T. Kiyokawa N. Sato N. Saito M. Fujimoto J. Exp. Hematol. 2000; 28: 55-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Importantly, Hck binds to an “acidic” domain comprising amino acids 771-811 of gp130 and is independent of STAT3 and SHP2 association via tyrosine residues 759, 767, and 814. Functionally, this region is responsible for the activation of Hck and subsequently for the phosphorylation of ERK and the dephosphorylation of Pyk2, therefore mediating cell proliferation and cell survival. Deletion of this region consequently leads to significant reduction of cell proliferation, thereby supporting a critical role of Hck in mediating IL-6-induced proliferative signals (7Schaeffer M. Schneiderbauer M. Weidler S. Tavares R. Warmuth M. de Vos G. Hallek M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8068-8081Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The mechanisms whereby the gp130/Hck-containing complex mediates IL-6-induced activation of both ERK and PI 3-kinase are poorly understood. One explanation could be that Hck can create docking sites for signaling molecules such as growth factor receptor-bound protein (Grb) 2 and SHP2 and/or by activating non-enzymatic adapter molecules that diversify and localize signals downstream of tyrosine kinase or cytokine receptors by their ability to assemble multiprotein complexes (8Liu Y. Rohrschneider L.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These activating adapter molecules belong to a growing family of scaffolding and docking proteins including mammalian Grb2-associated binders (Gab)-1, -2, -3, Drosophila daughter of sevenless, Caenorhabditis elegans Suppressor of clear 1, insulin receptor substrates-1, -2, and -3, Downstream of kinase (Dok), Dok-related (Dok-R), fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2, and linker of T cell. Typically, they contain an amino-terminal pleckstrin homology domain with the capacity to bind membrane phospholipids, a central proline-rich domain, and multiple potential binding sites for phosphotyrosine domains or SH2 domains of p85 subunit of PI3K, SHP2, phospholipase Cγ, or Crk. Gab1 and Gab2 act downstream of gp130 in transmitting signals to ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (9Takahashi-Tezuka M. Yoshida Y. Fukada T. Ohtani T. Yamanaka Y. Nishida K. Nakajima K. Hibi M.

In this report we show that the scaffolding adapter Gab family proteins are both expressed by multiple myeloma cells and phosphorylated upon IL-6 stimulation. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that gp130-associated SFK Hck forms a complex with Gab proteins in MM cells, thereby regulating their IL-6-stimulated phosphorylation and subsequent recruitment of downstream signaling molecules. These events ultimately lead to the activation of ERK and PI3K. Our studies therefore identify Hck and downstream Gab adapter proteins as potential new therapeutic targets in MM.

Expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a control to measure integrity of the RNA samples. To ensure that RNA samples were not contaminated with DNA, purified RNA was incubated with the appropriate primers and Taq polymerase, without reverse transcriptase. PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel and photographed. Expression of Hck Wild-type and Mutants in MM.1S and HEK 293 Cells—MLV-based transfer vectors were created by subcloning of wild-type and kinase-defective Hck (K269E = KE) IRES-GFP or IRES-GFP fragments into the retroviral vector pMigR1 (14Klejman A.

High titer retroviral pseudotype stocks were generated by triple co-transfection of 293T cells with transfer vectors together with helper vectors expressing in trans the MLV gag-pol and the vesicular stomatitis virus envelope glycoprotein (VSV-G). Transfection was performed using Trans-IT® 293 (MIRUS Corp., Madison, WI) solution according to the manufacturer's protocol. Viral supernatants were concentrated by ultracentrifugation 100-fold prior to infections. For each infection 1 × 106 MM.1S cells or 0.6 × 106 HEK 293 cells were plated per well in 6-well tissue culture plates and incubated with viral stocks in the presence of 5 μg/ml Polybrene (37 °C, 5% CO2).

However, early IL-6 signaling events that ultimately lead to the activation of ERK and PI3K are poorly understood. The use of pyrazolopyrimidine PP2, a potent inhibitor of the SFK p56Lck, p59Fyn, and p56/59Hck (17Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J.

Schneiderbauer M. Weidler S. Tavares R. Warmuth M. de Vos G. Hallek M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8068-8081Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Although PP2 was reported as a potent and specific inhibitor of Lck, Fyn, and Hck (17Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol.

J. 2003; 371: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar). After determining potential Hck targets using the PP2 model, this study therefore utilizes MM cells infected with wild-type Hck and kinase-inactive KE-Hck to limit the potential lack of PP2 specificity. We first examined MM.1S cells for changes in IL-6-induced tyrosine phosphorylation after pre-treatment with PP2. As shown in Fig. 1, IL-6 stimulation of MM.1S cells (1, 5, and 30 min) induced rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins with apparent masses of ∼60, 72, 85, 100, and 110 kDa. Importantly, tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins triggered by IL-6 was markedly decreased after pretreatment with the PP2. In addition, Fig. 1 shows the expression of Gab1 (110 kDa), Gab2 (97/100 kDa), SHP2 (72 kDa), and Hck (56/59 kDa) as possible candidates for these tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in the MM.1S model cell line. Gab1 and Gab2 Are Expressed in MM Cell Lines and MM Patient Cells—To investigate a potential role of the 110-kDa protein Gab1 and the p97/100 Gab2 in IL-6-mediated MM cell signaling, we first determined the expression of Gab1 and Gab2 proteins in several MM cells by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2a, all MM cell lines investigated, as well as patient MM cells, express both Gab1 and Gab2. The bands obtained for Gab1 (316 bp) and Gab2 (512 bp) were specific for cDNA, as no bands were detected in the absence of reverse transcriptase during the cDNA synthesis step (data not shown). Control PCR amplification with primers to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase confirmed that the isolated RNA could be PCR amplified and the quantity of RNA used was similar for all cells. IL-6 Mediates Tyrosine Phosphorylation of the Gab Adapter Proteins and Their Association with Other Signaling Proteins in MM Cells—Gab1 and Gab2 act downstream of cytokine and growth factor receptors as well as the antigen receptors on T and B cells (10Nishida K. Yoshida Y. Itoh M. Fukada T. Ohtani T. Shirogane T. Atsumi T. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Hirano T. Blood. 1999; 93: 1809-1816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, whether IL-6 signaling in MM cells is mediated through Gab1 and Gab2 as downstream signaling proteins is to date unknown. We therefore next investigated whether IL-6 can induce: 1) phosphorylation of Gab1 and Gab2; and 2) the association of Gab adapter molecules with other signaling proteins in MM cells. Serum-starved cells were stimulated with IL-6 and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Gab1 and anti-Gab2 antibody, respectively, followed by immunoblotting with antibodies directed against phosphotyrosine, Gab1, Gab2, and SHP2. To picture Gab-1-specific and Gab2-specific immunoreactive bands on the same blot, the membrane was extensively washed after Gab-1 detection (with no visible specific Gab2 band) and reblotted with anti-Gab2 antibody (Fig. 2b, second panel). Our results show that IL-6 mediates both early Gab1 and Gab2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Co-immunoprecipitation studies further demonstrate that IL-6 induces the association of Gab1 and Gab2 with tyrosine-phosphorylated SHP2 (Fig. 2b, third panel) and CRKL (data not shown) in MM cells. Gab proteins constitutively associate with Grb2, as expected (16Gu H. Pratt J.C. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 729-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 27Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J.

Biol. 2002; 22: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2b, fourth panel). IL-6-induced Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Gab1 and Gab2 Is Down-regulated by the Pyrazolopyrimidine PP2—We next sought to characterize upstream IL-6-induced signaling events that regulate Gab1 and Gab2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Signal transduction of IL-6 involves activation of SFKs in MM cells (29Hallek M. Neumann C. Schaffer M. Danhauser-Riedl S. von Bubnoff N. de Vos G. Druker B.J. Yasukawa K. Griffin J.D. Emmerich B. Exp. Hematol. 1997; 25: 1367-1377PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms whereby SFKs participate in mediating the mitogenic response in MM cells are unknown. Possible candidates for proteins whose IL-6-induced tyrosine phosphorylation is markedly decreased upon pretreatment with the pyrazolopyrimidine PP2 are Gab1 and Gab2 (Fig. 1). We therefore next tested the hypothesis that SFKs are required for IL-6-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab1 and Gab2 in MM cells. Immunoprecipitations were performed using anti-Gab1 (Fig. 3, a and b) and anti-Gab2 (Fig. 3, c and d) antibodies on cell lysates prepared from control and IL-6-stimulated MM cells pretreated with PP2 or left untreated; followed by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine-specific antibody and densitometric analysis. To confirm that equal amounts of Gab1 and Gab2 were immunoprecipitated, the filter was reblotted with Gab1 and Gab2 antisera, respectively; loading of whole cell lysate served as a size control. Our results indicate that the pyrazolopyrimidine PP2 inhibits IL-6-triggered rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of both Gab1 and Gab2. IL-6-induced Association of Gab1 and Gab2 with SHP2 in MM Cells Is Blocked by the Pyrazolopyrimidine PP2—In contrast to SH2 domain containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase (SHP)-1, protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 is a positive regulator of signaling from receptor tyrosine kinases and cytokine receptors (30Streuli M. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1996; 8: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 31Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell.

SHP2 binds Gab family proteins through the COOH-terminal consensus binding motif YXXV/I/L. Furthermore, previous studies underscore the importance of Gab-SHP2 interaction, strongly suggesting that the primary role of Gab proteins is to recruit SHP2 phosphatase to activate downstream signaling molecules (8Liu Y. Rohrschneider L.R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 515: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Our own prior studies have demonstrated that IL-6-triggered proliferation and survival of MM cells via the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and the PI3K cascade, respectively, require SHP2 activation (34Ogata A. Chauhan D. Teoh G. Treon S.P. Urashima M. Schlossman R.L. Anderson K.C. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2212-2221PubMed Google Scholar, 35Hideshima T. Nakamura N. Chauhan D. Anderson K.C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5991-6000Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar); these results also show that IL-6 induces association of SHP2 with p85 in MM cells (35Hideshima T. Nakamura N. Chauhan D. Anderson K.C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5991-6000Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). We therefore next investigated whether: 1) IL-6 can trigger the association between Gab proteins and SHP2 in MM cells; and if so, whether 2) inhibition of SFKs by PP2 abrogates this IL-6-triggered complex formation. Anti-SHP2 immunoprecipitates from cell lysates of IL-6-stimulated MM cells, pretreated with PP2 or left untreated, were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Gab1, anti-Gab2, and anti-SHP2 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4a, IL-6-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins with molecular masses of 100-115 kDa, which was markedly decreased by PP2 treatment. In addition, IL-6-induced complex formation between both Gab1 and Gab2 and SHP2 was abrogated upon PP2 treatment. Grb2 is a small adapter protein comprised of an SH2 domain flanked by two SH3 domains. Gab proteins constitutively associate with the COOH-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2, allowing the recruitment of further downstream proteins via the interaction of the SH2 domain of Grb2 (16Gu H.

In IL-6-induced growth signaling, the phosphorylation of residue Tyr-759 of gp130 is required for binding and tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2, its subsequent association with Grb2, and the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase by linking Grb2 to the Ras pathway through Sos (1Fukada T.

As expected, our data shows constitutive association of Gab proteins with Grb2. In contrast IL-6-induced SHP-2-Grb2 association and tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab proteins was decreased after pretreatment with PP2 (Fig. 4b). Taken together, these data indicate that IL-6-induced Gab protein tyrosine phosphorylation and Gab/Grb2·-SHP2 complex formation is dependent on SFK activity.

https://openalex.org/W2012912242,"The hydrophobic membrane protein, subunit c, has been isolated from ATP synthase purified from bovine heart mitochondria. It has also been obtained from lysosomal storage bodies associated with ceroid lipofuscinosis from ovine liver and from human brain tissue of a victim of Batten disease. It is likely that the lysosomal protein has originated from the mitochondrion. These samples have been characterized by mass spectrometric methods. Irrespective of its source, subunit c has an intact molecular mass of 7650 Da, 42 Da greater than the value calculated from the amino acid sequence, and the protein has been modified post-translationally. In all three samples, the modification is associated with lysine 43, which lies in a polar loop region linking the two transmembrane α-helices of the protein. This residue is conserved throughout vertebrate sequences. The additional mass arises from trimethylation and not acetylation at the ϵ-N-position of the residue. These experiments show that the post-translational modification of subunit c is not, as has been suggested, an abnormal phenomenon associated with the etiology of Batten disease and ceroid lipofucinoses. Evidently, it occurs either before or during import of the protein into mitochondria or at a mitochondrial location after completion of the import process. The function of the trimethyllysine residue in the assembled ATP synthase complex is obscure. The residue and the modification are not conserved in all ATP synthases, and their role in the assembly and (or) functioning of the enzyme appear to be confined to higher organisms. The hydrophobic membrane protein, subunit c, has been isolated from ATP synthase purified from bovine heart mitochondria. It has also been obtained from lysosomal storage bodies associated with ceroid lipofuscinosis from ovine liver and from human brain tissue of a victim of Batten disease. It is likely that the lysosomal protein has originated from the mitochondrion. These samples have been characterized by mass spectrometric methods. Irrespective of its source, subunit c has an intact molecular mass of 7650 Da, 42 Da greater than the value calculated from the amino acid sequence, and the protein has been modified post-translationally. In all three samples, the modification is associated with lysine 43, which lies in a polar loop region linking the two transmembrane α-helices of the protein. This residue is conserved throughout vertebrate sequences. The additional mass arises from trimethylation and not acetylation at the ϵ-N-position of the residue. These experiments show that the post-translational modification of subunit c is not, as has been suggested, an abnormal phenomenon associated with the etiology of Batten disease and ceroid lipofucinoses. Evidently, it occurs either before or during import of the protein into mitochondria or at a mitochondrial location after completion of the import process. The function of the trimethyllysine residue in the assembled ATP synthase complex is obscure. The residue and the modification are not conserved in all ATP synthases, and their role in the assembly and (or) functioning of the enzyme appear to be confined to higher organisms. Subunit c is a small hydrophobic protein that forms oligomeric rings in the membrane domain of ATP synthases from mitochondria, chloroplasts, and eubacteria (1Stock D. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E.

Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Nature Rev. 2001; 2: 669-677Crossref Scopus (701) Google Scholar). In the mitochondria of vertebrates, subunit c is composed of 75 amino acids and, as far as is known, its sequence is absolutely conserved in mammals and the only known substitutions in vertebrates are Ile70-Leu in carp and Met60-Val in flounders. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli, the sequence of subunit c is 60 and 20% conserved, respectively, relative to the mammalian protein. More than 25 years ago, the mitochondrial protein was proposed to be folded into two transmembrane α-helices linked by a polar loop structure containing the absolutely conserved sequence Arg-Asn-Pro (residues 38–40 in the bovine protein) (6Sebald W.

This proposal has been borne out by subsequent extensive genetic and biochemical studies, especially of the E. coli protein, by solution NMR studies in organic solvents of the E. coli protein (8Girvin M.E.

Subunit c has also been found in large amounts in fluorescent storage bodies associated with most forms of a group of neurodegenerative diseases called Batten disease in man or the (neuronal) ceroid lipofuscinoses.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 8-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The stored protein and the normal mitochondrial subunit c were found to be identical by protein sequencing (15Palmer D.N. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Hall N.A. Lake B.D. Wolfe L.S. Haltia M. Martinus R.D. Jolly R.D. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1992; 42: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 16Fearnley I.M.

By amino acid analysis of acid hydrolysates of storage bodies, one mole of trimethyllysine was detected per mole of subunit c and it was proposed that the modification of lysine 43 was associated with the etiology of the disease (20Katz M.L. Gerhardt K.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1138: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 21Katz M.L. Biochim. Biophys.

An unmodified lysine residue was detected at lysine 7 by Edman sequencing of the intact stored protein, and therefore, the only other lysine residue in the protein at position 43 was assumed to be the modified residue (14Palmer D.N.

Consistent with these proposals, molecular mass measurements by electrospray mass spectrometry of intact subunit c isolated from sheep storage bodies showed the presence in the protein of an additional mass of 42 Da but neither the location nor the chemical nature of the modification has been determined directly (24Buzy A. Ryan E.M. Jennings K.R. Palmer D.N. Griffiths D.E. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 790-796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other post-translational modifications, including S-methyl methionine, have also been proposed to be associated with stored subunit c from different forms of Batten disease at different times, and consequently, accounts of the modification status of the stored proteins are contradictory (25Katz M.L. Gerhardt K.O. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1990; 53: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 26Katz M.L. Siakotos A.N. Gao Q. Freiha B. Chin D.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1361: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As reported here, samples of subunit c isolated from bovine mitochondrial ATP synthase and from human and ovine storage bodies have been analyzed by mass spectrometry. Their molecular masses are identical, and they all contain an additional mass of 42 Da. In the bovine, human, and ovine proteins, this mass is associated with lysine 43 and arises from trimethylation of the ϵ-amino group of this residue. As the modification is present in both the mitochondrial protein and in storage bodies, the etiology of the ceroid lipofuscinoses (Batten disease) is not associated with the post-translational modification of lysine 43. Purification of ATP Synthase—ATP synthase was purified from bovine heart mitochondria (27Buchanan S.K. Walker J.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Purification of Subunit c for Molecular Mass Analysis—Samples of subunit c were extracted from bovine heart mitochondrial membranes in mixtures of chloroform methanol (28Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6630-6637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8247-8251Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The crude proteolipid extract from mitochondrial membranes was fractionated by gel filtration on Toyopearl HW-55 in a mixture of chloroform, methanol, and water (46:46:8 by volume) containing 60 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0. Fractions containing subunit c were desalted before analysis by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Chloroform and water were added to fractions (final composition of chloroform:methanol:water 8:4:3 by volume), causing phase separation of the upper aqueous methanol layer from a mostly chloroform layer. The lower layer was removed. The proteins in it were concentrated in a stream of nitrogen and then precipitated with diethyl ether (4 volumes) at –20 °C. Subunit c was extracted from purified storage bodies with chloroform:methanol (16Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Martinus R.D. Jolly R.D. Kirkland K.B. Shaw G.J. Palmer D.N. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Isolation of Storage Bodies—Storage bodies were isolated from livers of sheep affected with ceroid lipofuscinosis and from a sample of frozen brain tissue of a deceased patient affected by the late infantile disease (15Palmer D.N. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Hall N.A. Lake B.D. Wolfe L.S. Haltia M. Martinus R.D. Jolly R.D. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1992; 42: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 30Palmer D.N. Martinus R.D. Barns G. Jolly R.D. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1988; 5 (suppl.): 141-158Crossref Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—The subunits of bovine mitochondrial ATP synthase and samples of human and ovine storage bodies isolated from Batten tissues were dissolved in 5% lithium dodecyl sulfate containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and analyzed by SDS-PAGE with an acrylamide gradient (10–22%) (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206658) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue R250 dye (British Drug Houses, Poole, United Kingdom). Protein Characterization by Peptide Mass Fingerprinting—Protein bands were excised and cleaved “in-gel” at 37 °C with chymotrypsin (12.5 ng/μl; 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) without prior reduction and alkylation of cysteine residues (32Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7787) Google Scholar). Sequencing grade chymotrypsin was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Peptides were analyzed by peptide mass fingerprinting in a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (TofSpec 2E spectrometer, Micromass, Altrincham, United Kingdom) or by tandem MS peptide sequencing in a Q-TOF instrument (Micromass, Altrincham, United Kingdom) as described previously (33Fearnley I.M.

Intact protein molecular masses were measured in chloroform:methanol by ESI-MS using a Sciex API III+ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (34Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 912-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Molecular Mass Measurements of Subunit c—Samples of subunit c from mitochondria and storage bodies were analyzed by ESI-MS. The average molecular mass of the bovine mitochondrial subunit c was 7650 ± 1 Da, 42 Da greater than the value of 7608 calculated from its amino acid sequence (Table I). Essentially, the same value was obtained with the samples of subunit c from storage bodies. Thus, all of the samples, irrespective of their source, contain a post-translational modification with a mass of 42 Da (Table I).Table IMolecular masses of samples of subunit c determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometryProtein sourceMolecular massObservedCalculatedBovine mitochondrial ATP synthase7649.4 (0.6)7608.07666.9 (0.4)7687.6 (1.0)Human brain storage bodies7649.8 (0.2)7608.07666.1 (0.9)7683.4 (1.2)Ovine liver storage bodies7650.5 (0.1)7608.07667.6 (1.1)Ovine pancreas storage bodies7649.3 (0.6)7608.07666.5 (1.5) Open table in a new tab In both samples, masses of 7666 and 7683–7685 were also observed (see Supplementary Figs. S1, A–C). These masses arise from partial oxidation of one and two methionines, respectively, in the protein (see below). The abundance of these species indicates that ∼30–45% of the total protein is oxidized in this way. Other than this oxidation, which is likely to be an in vitro artifact (see below), the samples from bovine mitochondria and ovine storage bodies were homogenous and no other masses relating to subunit c were observed by ESI-MS. The spectra of subunit c from human storage bodies contain additional masses corresponding to the partial loss of one and two amino acids from the C terminus of the protein (see Supplementary Fig. S1B). No masses corresponding to unmodified subunit c were observed, and so the addition of 42 mass units appears to be quantitative. Subunit c purified from bovine mitochondria is only partially resolved from subunit A6L of ATP synthase in these experiments, and trace amounts of this protein with mass of 7965.4 were observed in the spectrum. Location and Identification of the Modification—The site of modification was investigated by peptide mass mapping by MALDI-TOF and tandem ESI-MS of fragments produced by chymotrypic digestion of samples purified by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). The MALDI-TOF spectrum of the chymotryptic digest of subunit c from ATP synthase contained three peptides with m/z values of 880.4338, 1343.7844, and 1732.9155 (see Figs. 2 and Fig. 3A and Supplementary material). One peptide with a mass of 1343.7844 corresponded to chymotryptic peptide Ch-4 (residues 37–47) with an additional mass of 42 Da. The two other peptides corresponded to Ch-1 (residues 1–8) and Ch-2 (residues 9–29) (see Fig. 2). These data show that the region from 37–47 contains the modification. They confirm that lysine 7 is unmodified and that the site of modification is not in residues 1–29.Fig. 2Amino acid sequence of mammalian mitochondrial subunit c. The location of the modified lysine is marked with an asterisk, and the chymotryptic fragments characterized by mass spectrometry are indicated. The sequences of five chymotryptic peptides characterized from the mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit c are underlined and denoted Ch-1–Ch-5.

Peaks marked Ch correspond to the predicted chymotryptic fragments of subunit c, and the numbers denote the order of the peptide in the sequence. The spectra shown were calibrated with Ch-1 (residues 1–8) and Ch-2 (residues 9–29) as internal calibration standards. In A, the peak marked with an asterisk is a fragment of chymotrypsin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) All four protein bands examined from gels of storage body proteins contained only subunit c. Fragments of no other protein were identified (15Palmer D.N. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Hall N.A. Lake B.D. Wolfe L.S. Haltia M. Martinus R.D. Jolly R.D. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1992; 42: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 16Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Martinus R.D. Jolly R.D. Kirkland K.B. Shaw G.J. Palmer D.N. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The 3.5-kDa band represents the monomeric subunit c, and the bands migrating with higher molecular sizes are aggregates of it. In the chymotryptic digests of both human and ovine storage bodies, the same three fragments, Ch-1, Ch-2, and Ch-4, were observed in MALDI-TOF MS analyses of the 3.5-kDa bands (Figs. 3, B and C, respectively). As in the bovine protein, the modification lay in chymotryptic fragment Ch-4. The site and nature of the modification were determined by tandem MS analysis of chymotrypic fragment Ch-4. A doubly charged ion from Ch-4 from mitochondria with an m/z of 672.3 [M+H]2+ was fragmented by collision-induced dissociation in a Q-TOF mass spectrometer. From the product ion spectrum (Fig. 4), a partial amino acid sequence was deduced from both y- and b-fragment ions. They confirm the peptide as ARNPSLKQQLF, where the underlined sequence was deduced from the data. A mass difference of 170.15 Da observed between the b7 and b6 ions corresponds to the modified lysine 43 (Fig. 4). This mass corresponds to a lysine (128.17 Da) plus an additional mass of 42 Da, thus confirming the location of the modified residue. The spectrum also contains fragment ions arising by the partial loss of trimethylamine-N(CH3)3, (mass = 59 Da) from the fragment ions y9, y8, and b7 (Fig. 4), which are diagnostic of peptides containing trimethyllysine (35Zhang P.M. Yau P.M. Chandrasekhar B. New R. Kondrat R. Imai B.S. Bradbury M.E. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition, the product ion spectrum contains an immonium ion (m/z 84) also diagnostic for trimethyllysine, and there was no evidence for an immonium ion (m/z 126) arising from an acetylated lysine residue (35Zhang P.M. Yau P.M. Chandrasekhar B. New R. Kondrat R. Imai B.S. Bradbury M.E. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The corresponding Ch-4 peptides from stored human and ovine subunits c were characterized by tandem MS in a similar way. These spectra were qualitatively similar to those of subunit c from ATP synthase (see Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3). As in the mitochondrial protein, they define the modification of the stored proteins as ϵ-N-trimethylation of lysine 43. Additional evidence for trimethylation as opposed to ϵ-N-acetylation (mass difference between the modifications of 0.0364 Da) was obtained from the MALDI-TOF spectrum of Ch-4 after recalibration with fragments Ch-1 and Ch-2 (m/z values 880.4338 and 1732.9155, respectively) as internal standards. The masses of the modified chymotryptic peptide from subunits c from bovine ATP synthase and from human and ovine storage bodies (1343.7844, 1343.7949, and 1343.7800, respectively) give mass values for the modifying group of 42.0592, 42.0697, and 42.0548 Da and support modification by trimethylation rather than acetylation. Five additional chymotryptic fragments of bovine subunit c were identified by tandem MS analysis of digests of the bovine mitochondrial protein. They cover residues 1–47 and 70–73, and altogether, the tandem MS data cover 84% of the sequence of mitochondrial subunit c (see Supplemental Table SI). They indicate minor N-terminal heterogeneity in the protein involving the loss of residues 1–2 and 1–3. Similar heterogeneities have been noted in stored versions of subunit c. Intact protein ions in the ESI-MS spectra of subunit c from the [M+H+16]+ species with a mass of 7666 were also analyzed by tandem MS. A series of multiply charged fragment ions localized the additional 16 Da to the C-terminal methionine residue, consistent with oxidation to methionine sulfoxide (see data in Supplementary Fig. S4). These [M+H+16]+ masses were observed in ESI-MS of mitochondrial and stored forms of subunit c (Table I). The intensity of the [M+H+16]+ species differed from experiment to experiment with the same samples, suggesting that oxidation arose during either the sample preparation in chloroform and methanol solutions or during electrospray ionization (36Morand K. Talbo G. Mann M. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 7: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). No methionine-containing peptides were isolated in these experiments, and so it was not possible to examine the state of methionine oxidation by MALDI mass spectrometry. Biological Significance—The finding that lysine 43 is modified by trimethylation in both the bovine mitochondrial protein assembled into ATP synthase and in the version that is stored in ovine and human lysosomal bodies in ceroid lipofuscinoses has potential implications both for the etiology of Batten disease and also for the function of the protein in ATP synthesis. Several pieces of evidence point to the stored material having a mitochondrial origin. Among the most persuasive is the correct and rather precise removal of the mitochondrial import sequence in identical fashion from both the stored and mitochondrial protein (15Palmer D.N. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Hall N.A. Lake B.D. Wolfe L.S. Haltia M. Martinus R.D. Jolly R.D. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1992; 42: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The presence of the trimethyllysine at residue 43 in both forms adds further support. However, it should be remembered that without investigation of subunit c from ovine or human ATP synthase at present it is not absolutely certain that the modification by trimethylation of the stored material takes place before the formation of storage bodies, although it is highly likely to do so. If so, the modification does not lead to nor is it a consequence of ceroid lipofuscinosis. The ceroid lipfuscinoses are an example of a lysosomal storage disease where the defect is likely to lie at the level of lysosomal function (37Ezaki J. Wolfe L.S. Kominami E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1677-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Several human genes associated with the disease have been identified. Two of them, CLN1 (infantile) and CLN2 (classic late infantile), encode soluble lysosomal enzymes, a thiolesterase and serine protease, respectively (38Vesa J. Hellsten E. Verkruyse L.A. Camp L.A.

As yet, the biochemical origin(s) of the disease are unknown but any dysfunction associated with methylation of lysine 43 of subunit c can now be eliminated. Any possible modification of the stored subunit c by a fluorophor is also excluded, and the cause of fluorescence of storage bodies in situ is unconnected to lysine methylation (43Palmer D.N. Oswald M.J. Westlake V.J. Kay G.W. Arch. Gerontol. Geriatr. 2002; 34: 343-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The significance of the modification of lysine 43 of the subunit c assembled into ATP synthase is also obscure. This residue is adjacent to the membrane surface loop containing the conserved sequence Arg-Asn-Pro (residues 38–40) that connects its two transmembrane α-helices (7Sebald W. Hoppe J. Curr. Topics Bioenerget. 1981; 12: 1-64Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The c-ring of the membrane domain of the bovine ATP synthase by analogy with the c-ring in the enzyme in mitochondria in S. cerevisiae probably contains 10 protomers (44Stock D. Gibbons C. Arechaga I. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 672-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). If so, in addition to the 10 positive charges at arginine 38, there will be 10 more positive charges in the same vicinity of the assembly associated with trimethyllysine 43. Whether they have a structural or a functional role or both must await other studies including a high resolution structure of the intact bovine ATP synthase. Although lysine 43 is widely conserved in mitochondria including those of S. cerevisiae from peptide mass mapping experiments, the yeast subunit c appears to be unmodified. 2R. Chen, I. M. Fearnley, and J. E. Walker, unpublished data. This might suggest that the significance of the trimethylation is confined to a narrower range of species and that it reflects an association with one of the so-called “minor” subunits that is either absent from the yeast enzyme or is poorly conserved between the yeast and bovine enzymes. Trimethyllysine is not present in any of the other 15 subunits of bovine ATP synthase (34Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 912-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 45Collinson I.R. Fearnley I.M. Skehel J.M. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Finally, it is worth noting that trimethyllysine derived from protein breakdown, in diet for example, provides the precursor for carnitine biosynthesis, which is itself in part a mitochondrial process (21Katz M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1317: 192-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Whether the breakdown of the relatively abundant subunit c contributes significantly to this process remains to be established. Download .pdf (.31 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2015403899,"Strong agonists cause platelets to expose a procoagulant surface supporting the assembly of two important coagulation enzyme complexes. Equilibrium binding has determined the density of high affinity saturable factor IXa binding sites to be 500–600 sites/platelet. We have now used flow cytometry to visualize the binding of factor IX and IXa to thrombin- or SFLLRN-activated platelets. Concentrations of these agonists that are half-maximal or maximal in kinetic studies resulted in only a small subpopulation (4–20%) of platelets binding factor IX or IXa with the density of binding sites for factor IX being about half of that for factor IXa, consistent with previous equilibrium binding studies. A small subpopulation (5 ± 1.5%) of platelets stimulated with either agonist also exposed annexin V binding sites, and this subpopulation of platelets also bound factor IXa. Annexin V decreased factor IXa binding in the presence or absence of factor VIIIa, and factor IXa could also decrease annexin V binding on some platelets indicating a common binding site in agreement with previous studies. All platelets binding factor IXa were positive for glycoprotein IX, at the same glycoprotein IX surface density as seen in platelets negative for factor IXa binding. These studies refine the results from equilibrium binding studies and suggest that, on average, only a small subpopulation (∼10%) of PAR 1-stimulated platelets expose ∼6000 factor IXa binding sites/platelet.

Although normally circulating in a quiescent state, when activated with strong agonists, platelets provide an important surface for assembly of two major coagulation enzyme complexes, the intrinsic factor X-activating complex and the prothrombinase complex (1Colman R.W.

In vitro kinetic assays have demonstrated that in the presence of activated platelets (or artificial phospholipid vesicles) factor Xa generation is enhanced several million-fold, and thrombin generation is enhanced 300,000-fold over solution phase activity (2van Dieijen G. van Rijn J.L.

It is known that not all agonists are equivalent in their ability to stimulate all functional end points of platelet activation. Weak agonists (e.g. ADP and epinephrine) require feedback enhancement from secreted molecules or synthesized agonists such as thromboxane A2 to achieve stimulation of platelet aggregation and are unable to stimulate a procoagulant surface capable of supporting assembly of these enzyme complexes (6Ahmad S.S. Scandura J.M. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13071-13081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 7Scandura J.M. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8903-8913Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Strong agonists (e.g. thrombin and collagen) are capable of generating all platelet functional endpoints (8Bevers E.M. Rosing J. Zwaal R.F. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1985; 192: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Are all platelets equivalent in their response to these agonists? Visualizations of in vivo clot formation show most platelets rolling, adhering, aggregating, and serving as the foundation for fibrin clot formation (9Falati S. Gross P. Merrill-Skoloff G. Furie B.C. Furie B. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1175-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). However, circulating platelets may constitute a heterogeneous population. Their generation from megakaryocytes packages them in different sizes, with different granule loads, differing numbers of mitochondria, and other vestiges of the parent cells (10Hartwig J. Italiano Jr., J. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 1: 1580-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 11Italiano Jr., J.E. Lecine P. Shivdasani R.A. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1299-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The circulation contains platelets of different ages as well as sizes. Flow cytometry analyses detect a wide range of forward and side scatter of blood platelets, necessitating the viewing of platelets on log scales (12Shattil S.J. Cunningham M. Hoxie J.A. Blood. 1987; 70: 307-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Flow cytometry provides an opportunity to view the homogeneity or heterogeneity of the incidence and density of platelet markers as well as the appearance of activation-dependent markers providing a clinical tool to probe for platelet activation in whole blood samples (13Abrams C.S. Ellison N. Budzynski A.Z. Shattil S.J. Blood. 1990; 75: 128-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Shattil S.J. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1992; 56: 789S-790SCrossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We have formerly used both equilibrium binding studies and in vitro kinetic studies to investigate the nature of the factor IXa-factor VIIIa-catalyzed factor X-activating complex on thrombin- or SFLLRN-stimulated platelets. We determined that platelets upon activation expose 500–600 binding sites for the enzyme factor IXa (15Ahmad S.S. Rawala-Sheikh R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3244-3251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 1000–1200 binding sites for the cofactor factor VIIIa (6Ahmad S.S. Scandura J.M. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13071-13081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and 1000–1200 specific binding sites for the substrate factor X (as well as 30,000 sites shared with prothrombin) (16Scandura J.M. Ahmad S.S. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8890-8902Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The affinity of each protein for its binding site as well as complete occupancy of sites are both optimal when all components of the enzyme complex are present. It has been assumed that the saturable binding sites determined from equilibrium binding studies are generated on all platelets as a result of agonist stimulation. We now present data from flow cytometry studies visualizing the binding of the enzyme and the zymogen that result in the surprising conclusion that although all platelets respond to the PAR 1 agonists with markers of activation, only a small subpopulation of platelets stimulated with thrombin or SFLLRN-amide responds with procoagulant surface changes allowing binding of factor IXa. Reagents—Bovine serum albumin, buffer reagents, disodium EDTA, dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), calcium chloride, and Sepharose 2B-CL, were obtained from Sigma. Electrophoresis reagents were from Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. Chromogenic substrates N-α-benzyloxycarbonyl-d-arginyl-l-glycyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanaline-dihydrochloride (S-2765) and H-d-phenylalanyl-l-pipecolyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanaline dihydrochloride (S-2238) were purchased from DiaPharma (West Chester, OH). The thrombin receptor agonist peptide, SFLLRN-amide, was synthesized using Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl) chemistry on an Applied Biosystems 430A synthesizer and reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography purified to greater than 99% homogeneity. A fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) 1The abbreviations used are: FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GPIX, glycoprotein IX; GPIbα, glycoprotein Ibα; PE, phycoerythrin; FL, fluorescence channel. labeling kit was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR), and the biotinylation kit was from Pierce. FITC-labeled rabbit anti-human fibrinogen was from ICN Biochemicals, Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). FITC-labeled CD42a against glycoprotein IX (GPIX), FITC-labeled CD42b against glycoprotein Ibα (GPIbα), FITC-labeled CD62P against P-selectin and streptavidin-phycoerythrin (PE)-cy5 (Quantum Red) were purchased from Pharmingen. Unlabeled CD42b was purchased from DakoCytomation (Carpinteria, CA). Proteins—Factors IX, X, and XIa were obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc. (South Bend, IN) or Hematologic Technologies, Inc. (Burlington, VT). Coagulation proteins were obtained in or dissolved in 20 mm Tris-hydroxymethane, 150 mm NaCl and dialyzed against the same buffer to remove inhibitors. Concentrations were determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce), and purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining or by Western blot using specific antibodies. Baxter Healthcare Corporation (Duarte, CA) generously supplied recombinant factor VIII. Human α-thrombin was purchased from Sigma and was active-site titrated against human antithrombin III, the residual activity was assayed chromogenically with S-2238. The monoclonal antibody C10D raised against the catalytic domain of factor IX (17Frazier D. Smith K.J. Cheung W.F. Ware J. Lin S.W. Thompson A.R. Reisner H. Bajaj S.P. Stafford D.W. Blood. 1989; 74: 971-977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was fluoresceinated using manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes) or was biotinylated using manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Protein modifications did not interfere with the ability of the antibody to inhibit the clotting of normal human plasma. Platelet Preparation—Washed, aspirin-treated, gel-filtered platelets were prepared from human whole blood as described previously (18London F. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12146-12154Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Platelet-rich plasma was incubated with 1 mm acetylsalicylic acid for 30 min to inhibit feedback activation through prostaglandin synthesis, with prostaglandin E1 (2 μm) added 5 min before layering over the bovine serum albumin gradient for the wash step. Factor Xa Generation—Factor Xa was generated as described previously (18London F. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12146-12154Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Washed, aspirin-treated, gel-filtered platelets (108/ml) were added to wells of a microtiter plate. Factor IXa and varying concentrations of agonists (thrombin or SFLLRN-amide) were added, and activation proceeded for 10 min before the addition of the cofactor and substrate. Factor VIII (200 units/ml) was incubated 1 min at 37 °C with thrombin (0.1 units/ml) and an additional minute with hirudin (5 units/ml) immediately before addition to reaction mixtures. Reaction mixtures were stopped after 3 min and were analyzed for factor Xa generated by chromogenic substrate S-2765 cleavage as described (19London F. Ahmad S.S. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16886-16897Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—Results from enzyme assays were converted to factor Xa formed/min by comparison to a standard curve of factor Xa cleavage of S-2765 and plotted using KaleidaGraph software (Synergy, Reading, PA) to derive kinetic parameters. Results from multiple experiments were pooled and analyzed for means and standard errors. Flow Cytometry—Washed, aspirin-treated, gel-filtered platelets (106) were incubated with FITC-labeled CD42b against platelet GPIbα to define the platelet population. Platelets were incubated with FITC- or PE-labeled annexin V at specified concentrations or with various concentrations of factor IXa or IX, and half of each sample was activated with thrombin (0.2 or 2 units/ml) or with SFLLRN-amide (30–150 μm) for 10 min. Some samples contained thrombin-activated factor VIIIa at 10 units/ml. Samples containing factor IX or IXa were incubated with either FITC-labeled C10D or biotinylated C10D for 15 min, and the latter was detected with streptavidin-PE-cy5. Some samples were dual-labeled to simultaneously detect PE-annexin V binding and factor IXa binding (through FITC-C10D). Other samples were dual-labeled to simultaneously detect platelet GPIX and factor IXa binding. All samples were diluted 5-fold and analyzed on a Facscan flow cytometer (Pharmingen) equipped with a 488-nm-emitting laser. Data were collected using either E00 or E01 voltage settings for forward scatter sensitivity, and a threshold of 2 arbitrary fluorescence units was established to eliminate debris. Compensations were set to minimize fluorescence channel 1 (FL-1) spillover into fluorescence channel 2 or 3 (FL-2 and -3) and FL-3 spillover into FL-1 or -2. Using CellQuest Pro software (Pharmingen), platelets were defined by their characteristic forward versus side scatter pattern as well as by positive staining for fluorescein-CD42b (anti-GPIbα). Negative controls included excess unlabeled CD42a for FITC-CD42a, 10 mm EDTA for FITC- or PE-annexin V, and incubation with FITC-C10D (or the combination of biotinylated C10D and streptavidin-PE-cy5) in the absence of factor IX(a). Gated platelets were analyzed for fluorescein as FL-1 emission, PE as FL-2 emission, or PE-cy5 as FL-3 emission and displayed on log scales as density plots or histograms. Data Analysis—Quadrants (density plots) or markers (histograms) were established with negative control samples to determine the statistics of positive and negative populations. Positive regions were defined so that density plots displaying total events from defined regions could subsequently be analyzed as platelet and non-platelet events and for forward scatter statistics. Events measured with buffer alone were subtracted from events measured with platelet samples. Data from different experiments collected under the same conditions were averaged and statistically analyzed. Platelets activated with low levels of thrombin or PAR 1-activating peptide (SFLLRN) support intrinsic factor Xa generation (5Rawala-Sheikh R. Ahmad S.S. Ashby B. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2606-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and expose high affinity saturable binding sites for factor X-activating complex components (6Ahmad S.S. Scandura J.M. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13071-13081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 7Scandura J.M. Walsh P.N.

Investig. 1989; 84: 824-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have now used flow cytometry studies to visualize the effect of PAR 1 stimulation on both factor IXa binding and on exposure of procoagulant lipids and compared this with the ability of PAR 1 agonists to stimulate platelet support for factor Xa generation. Platelets stimulated with increasing amounts of thrombin or SFLLRN-amide for 10 min at 37 °C supported increasing factor Xa generation saturating at 14.4 ± 0.7 nm/min in response to thrombin at 1 units/ml and at 9.7 ± 0.2 nm/min in response to 150 μm PAR 1 agonist peptide (Fig. 1). The EC50 for thrombin was 0.14 ± 0.02 units/ml (1.4 nm) and for SFLLRN-amide was 34 ± 2.5 μm. When incubated with an FITC-labeled antibody to P-selectin (CD62P), platelets stimulated with 35 μm SFLLRN-amide showed a 5-fold fluorescence shift of the entire population of platelets indicating that all platelets had responded to the agonist peptide with secretion from α-granules and incorporation of membrane-bound P-selectin into the plasma membrane. The same effect on P-selectin exposure was found in response to thrombin at 0.2 units/ml, and these platelets aggregated fully without exogenous fibrinogen when stimulated with as little as 10 μm SFLLRN or thrombin at 0.2 units/ml (data not shown) indicating that all platelets are capable of aggregation as well as secretion in response to PAR 1 stimulation. The assembly of the factor X-activating complex on platelets was probed by flow cytometry for factor IXa binding. The monoclonal antibody C10D to the heavy chain of factor IX was either fluoresceinated with FITC for detection in the FL-1 window or was biotinylated and detected with streptavidin conjugated to PE-cy5, a tandem dye absorbing at 488 nm and fluorescing by resonance energy transfer from PE to cy5 in the FL-3 window. Factor IXa binding results were equivalent using either detection system. Table I shows binding results determined in the presence and absence of the cofactor factor VIIIa (6 units/ml) when platelets were stimulated with half-maximal concentrations of SFLLRN-amide (35 μm). Increasing factor IXa resulted in an increasing percentage of platelets binding more factor IXa/platelet in both the presence and absence of the cofactor. The presence of the cofactor did not affect the percentage of platelets responding for a given factor IXa concentration but did increase the density of binding sites at lower than saturating concentrations of ligand. At 10 nm factor IXa, the densities of binding sites in the presence and absence of the cofactor were equivalent. The mean percentage of platelets binding Factor IXa in the presence of 10 nm factor IXa in the absence of the cofactor was 9 ± 2.4 with a mean fluorescein emission of 1000 ± 147 (Table I). Activated platelets incubated with biotinylated C10D and streptavidin-PE-cy5 in the absence of factor IXa showed no positive population. Less than 1% of unstimulated platelets displayed low density binding in the presence of 10 nm factor IXa. Experiments comparing the binding of the enzyme with that of the zymogen found that 9% of the platelets were positive for factor IXa, and 6.5% were positive for factor IX, with the density of binding sites for factor IXa 2- to 3-fold higher than for factor IX (Table I). This is in approximate agreement with the equilibrium binding studies (15Ahmad S.S. Rawala-Sheikh R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3244-3251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that found half the number of sites for factor IX as were found for factor IXa.Table IDetection of factor IXa binding to activated platelets Platelets prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” were incubated with factor IXa or factor IX at the indicated concentrations and activated by SFLLRN-amide (35 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C before the addition, where indicated, of thrombin-activated factor VIII (6 units/ml). After incubation with a detection system, data were collected and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are presented as the mean of two determinations or as the mean (±S.E.) of the number (n) of observations designated in the table.Cofactor factor VIIIaLigand factor IXaResultsPositive plateletsFluorescence peak intensity6 units/mlnm%nmAbsent0.526633.4300(n = 12)109 (±2.4)1000 (±147)Present0.52.520035.56501091400AbsentFactor IX(n = 4)106.5 (±3)304 (±147) Open table in a new tab When saturating (10 nm) factor IXa was incubated with platelets in the presence of half-maximal or saturating levels of thrombin (0.2 and 2 units/ml) or SFLLRN-amide (30 and 150 μm), there was little effect on mean fluorescence density/platelet (900 ± 25–1000 ± 50 in both cases). The population of platelets responding, however, increased from 4.2 ± 1.3 to 7.0 ± 1.5 with thrombin and from 4.4 ± 1.3 to 8.4 ± 2.5 with SFLLRN-amide. When probed for exposure of annexin V binding sites after stimulation with thrombin or SFLLRN at either their EC50 or at saturation levels, only a small subpopulation of platelets was positive with a high density of annexin V binding sites/platelet (Fig. 2). Annexin V binding occurred in few (1.8%) unstimulated platelets (Fig. 2b) and increased as platelets were activated with half-maximal to maximal levels of both PAR 1 agonists, thrombin (4–7%) and SFLLRN-amide (3.8–5.7%). In five experiments with PE-annexin V and seven experiments with FITC-annexin V performed with the EC50 concentrations of the agonists, the mean (±S.E.) percentage of platelets positive with thrombin stimulation of annexin V binding was 5% ± 1.5 and with SFLLRN-amide stimulation was 4.2% ± 0.5, whereas maximal levels of SFLLRN-amide (150 μm) resulted in 7% ± 1.8. Therefore, activation with PAR 1 agonists was accompanied by a 3-fold increase in the population positive for annexin V binding with a 2-fold increased density of binding sites. Dual-labeling studies were performed to investigate the relationship between annexin V binding and factor IXa binding to SFLLRN-activated platelets. Platelets were stimulated with saturating SFLLRN-amide (150 μm) and exposed to 10 nm factor IXa (± thrombin-activated factor VIII, 6 units/ml) in the presence of varying concentrations of annexin V. Increasing annexin V concentrations from 1 to 5.7 nm resulted in increased density of bound annexin V/platelet (data not shown). Fig. 3a shows that the density of bound factor IXa decreased with increasing annexin V concentration in the absence (gray bars) or presence (black bars) of factor VIIIa. The simultaneous presence of both ligands had no effect on the percentage of platelets positive for either annexin V (6–7%) or for factor IXa (6–8%). It was noted, however, that of eight experiments all showing a decrease in factor IXa binding in the presence of annexin V, only five showed no change in annexin V binding in the presence of 10 nm factor IXa. Fig. 3b presents the data for samples incubated with 3.8 nm annexin V in the absence (open bars) or presence (black bars) of factors IXa/VIIIa. The bars on the left represent all data analyzed together for annexin V binding. Five experiments (Fig. 3b, middle) showed no change in annexin V bound in the presence of factors IXa/VIIIa. Three experiments showed that annexin V binding could be substantially decreased by the presence of factors IXa/VIIIa (Fig. 3b, right). These results were found using PE-annexin V with FITC detection of factor IXa and using FITC-annexin V with PE-cy5 detection of factor IXa. Factor IXa in the absence of factor VIIIa showed the same effect. The ability of factor IXa to reduce binding sites for annexin V was more noted with annexin V concentrations at or below the previously determined kinetic IC50 (19London F. Ahmad S.S. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16886-16897Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In support of this evidence for competition, it was clear that the platelet populations responding to PAR 1 stimulation with binding of either annexin V or factor IXa were almost totally overlapping. Fig. 4 shows that almost all positive events in the dual-labeled sample (Fig. 4d) appeared in the upper right quadrant that was set to depict dual-labeled platelets. This overlap in binding determinants was consistent with previously reported kinetic studies (19London F. Ahmad S.S. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16886-16897Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) of annexin V inhibition of factor IXa-catalyzed factor X activation, which predicted an overlap in platelet binding sites for both ligands. Thus, platelets responding to thrombin with the appearance of aminophospholipids that bind annexin V are the same platelets capable of binding the enzyme factor IXa. Activation of platelets can lead to microvesiculation (21Zwaal R.F. Comfurius P. Bevers E.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1180: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), resulting in procoagulant vesicles displaying exposed aminophospholipids that can bind coagulation proteins. To determine whether activation of platelets with the EC50 concentration of agonists leads to extra platelet procoagulant surfaces, data from single and dual-label platelet samples from factor IXa/annexin V experiments were analyzed for positive events inside and outside of the defined platelet population. It was found that 95% of all events positive for factor IXa binding, 94% of all events positive for annexin V binding, and 97% of all events positive for both labels were within the platelet population. Previously published data (21Zwaal R.F. Comfurius P. Bevers E.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1180: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) reporting barely detectable microvesicle formation in unstirred platelets stimulated with low thrombin agonist concentration support our observation that factor IXa binding stimulated by PAR 1 activation occurs on the activated platelet surface. To confirm that all events positive for factor IXa binding were platelets, dual staining was performed with PE-cy5-labeled anti-factor IXa and FITC-labeled anti-GPIX. A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 5. The quadrants were drawn to define the negative population of platelets incubated with both FITC-anti-GPIX in the presence of excess unlabeled anti-GPIX and with biotinylated C10D and streptavidin-PE-cy5 in the absence of factor IXa (Fig. 5a). 6% of activated platelets were positive for factor IXa (Fig. 5b), whereas all platelets were positive for GPIX (Fig. 5c). Fig. 5d shows that all platelets positive for factor IXa contained the same density of GPIX (upper right quadrant) as the activated platelet population that remained negative for factor IXa binding (upper left quadrant). In summary, these experiments produced evidence that platelet activation with doses of PAR 1 agonists mid to maximally effective at eliciting platelet procoagulant activity resulted in only a subpopulation of platelets exposing binding sites for factor IXa and for annexin V. This population displayed the same surface density of GPIb-IX-V complex as seen in the population of activated platelets negative for factor IXa binding. Biochemical techniques for determining specific ligand binding rely on statistical averaging over the entire population of cells studied. Using these techniques, it was determined that factor IXa binds to thrombin- or SFLLRN-amide-activated platelets with 500–600 sites/platelet and that the inactivated zymogen binds to one-half that number of sites (15Ahmad S.S. Rawala-Sheikh R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3244-3251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Flow cytometry provides the opportunity to analyze the total cell population as individual events and thus can help determine whether all cells provide binding sites or whether activation events are specific to portions of the cell population. It can also determine how uniformly distributed are the binding events. Although it has been demonstrated that thrombin, a strong agonist for many platelet activation events, is a weak agonist for activation-dependent exposure of procoagulant phospholipids (22Bevers E.M. Comfurius P. Zwaal R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 736: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), we have previously used thrombin or SFLLRN-amide to stimulate robust platelet support of factor Xa generation at one-fifth to one-tenth the concentrations that had shown little ability to stimulate exposure of procoagulant phospholipids (23London F.S. Marcinkiewicz M.M. Walsh P.N. Blood. 2002; 100 (abstr.): 1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Here we correlate dose-response curves for the stimulation of factor Xa generation with the development of factor IXa binding sites and exposure of procoagulant phospholipids detected by flow cytometry. We have found that although thrombin or SFLLRN stimulates all platelets to aggregate and to expose P-selectin through externalization of α-granules, only 4–20% of the platelets respond to thrombin or SFLLRN with exposure of factor IXa binding sites. These platelets responding with factor IXa binding sites overlap almost entirely with the entire population exposing aminophospholipids detected with annexin V binding. The subpopulation varies widely in single-donor platelets, the reasons for which are unknown. Because Feng and Tracy (24Feng P. Tracy P. Blood. 1998; 1 (abstr.): 1441Google Scholar) found that factor Xa binding was confined to a subpopulation of stimulated platelets, it would be interesting to determine whether there is a correlation between a tendency toward thrombotic events and the percentage of platelets responding to thrombin stimulation with exposure of factor IXa or Xa binding sites. Previous flow cytometric detection of factor IXa binding to thrombin-stimulated platelets provided dose-response data supporting the existence of two sites, a high affinity site comparable with what was found here and a low affinity site found with higher factor IXa concentrations (25Hoffman M. Monroe D.M. Roberts H.R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1992; 68: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Factor IXa binding results were similar for two different probes. Both fluorescein modification of a monoclonal antibody to the factor IX catalytic domain and biotinylation of that antibody detected with streptavidin-PE-cy5 allowed robust detection of 0.5 nm factor IXa in the presence of the cofactor and a weak detection of that concentration in the absence of the cofactor. Predictable from equilibrium binding results, 10 nm factor IXa represented a saturating level where binding-site density was not changed by the presence of the cofactor. The Kd was not measured in these flow cytometry studies, but it was noted that although the presence of both cofactor and substrate in equilibrium binding studies lowered the Kd from 2.5–3 nm to 0.5 nm (20Ahmad S.S. Rawala-Sheikh R. Ashby B. Walsh P.N. J. Clin. Investig. 1989; 84: 824-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), an inclusion of the cofactor in the absence of substrate here did not result in half-maximal binding density at 0.5 nm factor IXa. This may reflect either a lack of sensitivity at low binding-site density or the requirement for the substrate to stabilize the complex. However, the presence of the cofactor increased the density of binding sites/platelet most at a ligand concentration around the equilibrium Kd. As predicted from the titrations of agonists in kinetic assays, maximal concentrations of both SFLLRN-amide and thrombin elicited twice the factor IXa binding as seen with half-maximal concentrations. The additional binding resulted from recruitment of twice the number of platelets to bind factor IXa rather than from increases in the number of factor IXa binding sites/platelet. In these studies, factor IX bound to almost the same percentage of platelets with one-third to one-half of the density of binding sites/platelet. This is in agreement with equilibrium binding studies. Also in agreement with previous studies (19London F. Ahmad S.S. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16886-16897Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) is the overlap in binding determinants for annexin V and factor IXa. In kinetic studies, annexin V was found to inhibit factor Xa generation with a Ki of 3.5 nm. In these binding studies, although the density of factor IXa was reduced by the presence of annexin V, especially with annexin V present at concentrations above its Ki for kinetic studies, annexin V density could also be reduced by the presence of factor IXa. These results suggest that there is true competition for overlapping binding determinants, with factor IXa as a less effective competitor for annexin V binding sites than annexin V is for factor IXa binding sites. Binding sites for factor IXa and for annexin V were located primarily within the defined platelet population, which is in agreement with the previous observation that <5% of total factor IXa binding was attributed to platelet microparticles (25Hoffman M. Monroe D.M. Roberts H.R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1992; 68: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This was predictable from the weak ability of thrombin to generate microparticles from activated platelets (21Zwaal R.F. Comfurius P. Bevers E.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1180: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The dual-labeling studies detecting both GPIb/IX and factor IXa binding revealed that all platelets binding factor IXa contain an equivalent surface density of GPIb/IX/V complexes as the bulk of the platelet population that remains negative for factor IXa binding. These flow cytometry studies visualizing factor IXa binding to thrombin- or SFLLRN-stimulated platelets suggest a modification of the previous conclusions about intrinsic factor X-activating complex binding sites. It appears from the present results that instead of all platelets presenting ∼600 factor IXa binding sites/platelet, an average of 10% of activated platelets presents an average ∼6000 factor IXa binding sites/platelet. Flow cytometry detection of platelet binding of other factor Xa complex components should reveal interesting data to augment and refine information obtained from equilibrium binding studies.

https://openalex.org/W2065985393,"We have previously shown that the low molecular weight (LMW) forms (trunk 1 and trunk 2) of cyclin E are biochemically hyperactive and induce G1/S progression in normal epithelial cells. Here we investigate the biologic consequences of LMW cyclin E expression in ovarian cancer cells. Using a panel of ovarian carcinoma tumors we find that cyclin E overexpression is invariably due to the presence of LMW forms and that expression of these forms appears to correlate with more advanced grade and stage of disease. Despite similar expression of p21 and p27, cyclin E overexpressing tumors have higher kinase function. Using an isogenic ovarian cancer model, we find that clones that overexpress the trunk 1 (T1) protein have a 10-fold increase in cyclin E kinase function, a 20% increase in S-phase fraction, a 10-15% decrease in doubling time and a 20% increase in colony formation compared to parental cells that express only the FL cyclin E protein. T1 clones were resistant to G1 arrest but more sensitive to cisplatin. Therefore, in ovarian tumors, the presence of LMW cyclin E forms confers altered biologic properties. Our data provides a potential mechanism for the poor prognosis of patients with LMW cyclin E expressing tumors."

The aim of the present study was to determine whether protein kinase (PK) Cζ, one of the downstream mediators of the PI3K signaling pathway, is involved in cAMP-mediated stimulation of TC uptake. Studies were conducted in isolated rat hepatocytes and in HuH-7 cells stably transfected with rat liver Ntcp (HuH-Ntcp cells). Studies in hepatocytes showed that cAMP activates PKCζ in a PI3K-dependent manner without inducing translocation of PKCζ to the plasma membrane. Inhibition of cAMP-induced PKCζ activity by myristoylated PKC (ζ/λ) pseudosubstrate, a specific inhibitor of PKCζ, and Gö 6850, a PKC inhibitor, resulted in inhibition of cAMP-induced increases in TC uptake and Ntcp translocation. Studies in HuH-Ntcp cells showed that inhibition of cAMP-induced PKCζ activation by dominant-negative (DN) PKCζ resulted in inhibition of cAMP-induced increases in TC uptake and Ntcp translocation. DN PKCζ also inhibited wild-type PKCζ-induced increases in PKCζ activity, TC uptake, and Ntcp translocation. Myristoylated PKC (ζ/λ) pseudosubstrate and DN PKCζ also inhibited cAMP-induced activation of PKB in hepatocytes and HuH-Ntcp cells, respectively. Neither DN PKB nor constitutively active PKB affected cAMP-induced activation of PKCζ, and wild-type PKCζ did not activate PKB. Taken together, these results suggest that cAMP-induced activation of PKB is dependent on cAMP-induced stimulation of PKCζ. It is proposed that cAMP-induced Ntcp translocation involves the activation of the PI3K/PKCζ signaling pathway followed by the activation of the PI3K/PKB signaling pathway.

Considering that the effect of insulin on GLUT4 translocation involves PKB and PKCζ, cAMP-mediated Ntcp translocation may also involve PKCζ. However, it is unknown whether cAMP also activates the PI3K/PKCζ signaling pathway in hepatocytes and whether this pathway is also involved in the regulation of hepatic TC uptake. The aim of the present study was to determine whether PKCζ is involved in cAMP-mediated stimulation of hepatic TC uptake and Ntcp translocation. The role of PKCζ was evaluated by determining the effect of PKCζ inhibitors in hepatocytes and the effect of transient transfection with WT and/or DN PKCζ in HuH-Ntcp cells. Results are consistent with a role of PKCζ in hepatic uptake of bile acids. Materials—TC (sodium salt) was purchased from Calbiochem, and LipofectAMINE reagent kit from Invitrogen.

Hepatocytes were pretreated with PKC inhibitors and then with 10 μm CPT-cAMP for 15 min followed by determination of TC uptake, Ntcp translocation, and PKCζ activity. Details of these experiments are given in the figure legends. All studies were repeated in at least three different cell preparations. HuH-Ntcp Cell Culture and Transfections—HuH-Ntcp cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100,000 units/liter penicillin, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, 1.2 g/liter G418 at 37 °C in a 5% CO2/95% O2 air incubator. For transfection experiments, cells were cultured for 24 h in the culture medium and then transiently transfected with a PKCζ plasmid using LipofectAMINE as described previously (11Webster C.R.

After 24 h incubation in the transfection medium, cells were cultured for additional 24 h in culture media. Cells were then incubated in the HEPES buffer (see above) for 3 h at 37 °C before treatments. TC Uptake—The initial uptake rate of TC in hepatocytes was determined as described previously (33Anwer M.S. Hegner D. Hoppe-Zeyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1978; 359: 181-192PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, at various times after incubation of hepatocytes with different agents and/or CPT-cAMP, an aliquot of cell suspension (5–8 mg protein/ml) was withdrawn and used to determine the initial uptake rate of TC (20 μm). Transport was initiated by adding cells to the incubation medium containing [14C]TC and [3H]inulin, with uptake determined at different time points. Initial uptake rates were calculated from the slope of the linear portion of time-dependent uptake curves and were expressed as nanomoles per minute per milligram of protein. TC uptake in HuH-Ntcp cells was determined as described previously (11Webster C.R. Srinivasulu U. Ananthanarayanan M. Suchy F.J. Anwer M.S. J. Biol.

In brief, after pretreatment with 100 μm CPT-cAMP for 15 min, cells were incubated with 20 μm TC containing [3H]TC (100 dpm/pmol) for 2 min.

In brief, after various treatments, cell surface proteins were biotinylated by exposing hepatocytes (or HuH-Ntcp cells) to sulfo-d-biotin-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (0.5 mg/ml; Pierce) followed by preparation of cell lysate used to determine biotinylated and total Ntcp mass. Biotinylated proteins were isolated using streptavidin-agarose beads and then subjected to immunoblot analysis to determine plasma membrane Ntcp. For immunoblot analysis, proteins (10–50 μg) from whole-cell lysate and streptavidin-agarose-containing biotinylated proteins were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE by the method of Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) as described previously (35Mukhopadhayay S. Ananthanarayanan M. Stieger B. Meier P.J. Suchy F.J. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G842-G848PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred electophoretically from SDS gels to nitrocellulose membranes (Transblot transfer membrane, 0.45 μm; Bio-Rad) and probed with the Ntcp antibody (1:2000 dilution). Peroxidase conjugated anti-IgG was used as the secondary antibody. The immunoblots were developed with the Amersham Biosciences ECL kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein Kinase Assay—Cell lysates obtained after various treatments of hepatocytes and HuH-Ntcp cells were assayed for PKCζ using a previously described method (20Rust C. Karnitz L.M. Paya C.V.

In brief, PKCζ was immunoprecipitated by incubating 25–50 μg of total cellular protein with PKCζ antibody (Upstate), and the immunocomplexes were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with a 25-μl reaction mixture (kinase buffer containing 200 μm ATP, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μg of myelin basic protein). Reactions were stopped by adding Laemmli sample buffer and phosphorylated myelin basic protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. All samples were assayed in triplicate. PKB activity was determined from the ratio of phosphorylated PKB (active form) to total PKB as described previously (25Webster C.R.L. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1165-G1172PubMed Google Scholar, 27Webster C.R.L. Blanch C.J. Philips J. Anwer M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29754-29760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Other Methods—The Lowry method was used to determine cell protein (36Lowry D.H. Rosenberg N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The blots were scanned in gray scale using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA) and the relative band densities were quantitated using Sigma Gel (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Paired t test was used to statistically analyze data with p < 0.05 considered significant. Effect of cAMP on PKCζ in Hepatocytes—PKCζ is considered to be downstream of PI3K, and its activation depends on PI3K products (12Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and phosphorylation by PDK1 followed by autophosphorylation in some cells (37Newton A.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that cAMP activates PI3K as well as PKB and p70S6K, two downstream effectors of PI3K, in hepatocytes (25Webster C.R.L. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1165-G1172PubMed Google Scholar, 38Webster C.R. Usechak P. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G727-G738Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, the first series of studies were conducted to determine whether cAMP activates PKCζ in a PI3K-dependent manner in hepatocytes. PKCζ activity increased in hepatocytes treated with 10 μm CPT-cAMP and wortmannin inhibited both basal and cAMP-induced increases in PKCζ activity (Fig. 1). It may be noted that the effect of cAMP was variable and ranged from no activation in some cell preparations to 2–3-fold activation in others. PKC activation is usually associated with its translocation to membranes (37Newton A.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). However, cAMP did not increase plasma membrane content of PKCζ in hepatocytes (Fig. 1). These results indicated that cAMP activated PKCζ in a PI3K-dependent manner and that this activation was not associated with translocation to the plasma membrane in hepatocytes. Effect of PKCζ Inhibitors on Taurocholate Uptake, Ntcp Translocation, and PKCζ Activity in Hepatocytes—To determine whether the effect of cAMP on TC uptake and Ntcp translocation is mediated via PKCζ, we studied the effect of PKCζ inhibitors. Studies in Sf9 cells showed that Gö 6850, but not Gö 6976, inhibit PKCζ activity (39Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, studies were conducted with these two inhibitors first. Concentration-dependent studies showed that 5 and 10 μm Gö 6850, but not Gö 6976, inhibited basal as well as cAMP-stimulated PKCζ activity in hepatocytes (Fig. 2). Gö 6850, but not Gö 6976, also inhibited cAMP-induced increases in TC-uptake (Fig. 2) and plasma membrane Ntcp content (Fig. 3) in hepatocytes. Because Gö 6850, but not Gö 6976, inhibits PKCζ in hepatocytes, these results may suggest that cAMP-induced translocation of Ntcp is mediated via PKCζ. However, Gö 6850, but not Gö 6976, also inhibits PKCδ and PKCϵ in Sf9 cells (39Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of PKCζ PS, a more specific inhibitor of PKCζ, was studied.Fig. 3Gö6850, but not Gö6976, inhibits cAMP-induced Ntcp translocation in hepatocytes. Cells were treated with Me SO (Control), 10 μm Gö6850, or 10 μm Gö6976 for 30 min, followed by 2addition of buffer (Control) or 10 μm CPT-cAMP (cAMP). After an additional 15-min incubation, cell surface proteins were biotinylated and plasma membrane Ntcp (PM-Ntcp) was analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Typical Ntcp immunoblots are shown at the top, and results of densitometric analysis (Means ± S.E.; n = 5) are shown at the bottom. *, significantly different from respective controls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) PKCζ PS (100 μm, but not 10 μm) inhibited basal as well as cAMP-stimulated PKCζ activity in hepatocytes (Fig. 4). PKCζ PS (80 μm) has been shown to inhibit insulin-stimulated PKCζ activity in hepatocytes (17Lavoie L. Band C.J. Kong M. Bergeron J.J. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28279-28285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). PKCζ PS (100 μm, but not 10 μm) also inhibited cAMP-induced increases in TC uptake (Fig. 4) and plasma membrane Ntcp (Fig. 5); cAMP does not affect total Ntcp level in hepatocytes (25Webster C.R.L. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1165-G1172PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that cAMP-induced translocation of Ntcp may be mediated via PKCζ.Fig. 5PKCζ PS inhibits cAMP-induced Ntcp translocation in hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were treated with 10 or 100 μm PKCζ PS for 90 min before exposing cells to buffer (Control) or 10 μm CPT-cAMP (cAMP). After an additional 15-min incubation, cell surface proteins were biotinylated and plasma membrane Ntcp (PM-Ntcp) was analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Typical Ntcp immunoblots are at the top, and results of densitometric analysis (means ± S.E.; n = 4) are shown at the bottom. *, significantly different from respective controls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) DN PKCζ Inhibited cAMP-induced TC Uptake and Ntcp Translocation in HuH-Ntcp Cells—To determine the role of PKCζ more directly, HuH-Ntcp cells were transiently transfected with DN PKCζ followed by determination of PKCζ activity, TC uptake, and Ntcp translocation. We have shown previously that cAMP stimulates TC uptake and Ntcp translocation in HuH-Ntcp cells (11Webster C.R. Srinivasulu U. Ananthanarayanan M. Suchy F.J. Anwer M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28578-28583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Expression of DN PKCζ was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. As in hepatocytes, cAMP increased PKCζ activity and TC uptake in HuH-Ntcp cells (Fig. 6). DN PKCζ did not affect either basal TC uptake or PKCζ activity. However, cAMP-induced increases in TC uptake and PKCζ activity were inhibited in cells transfected with DN PKCζ (Fig. 6). Likewise, DN PKCζ also inhibited the ability of cAMP to increase plasma membrane Ntcp without affecting the basal level of Ntcp (Fig. 6). Total Ntcp level was not affected by either cAMP or DN PKCζ. These results further support that cAMP-induced increases in TC uptake and Ntcp translocation is dependent on PKCζ activity. WT PKCζ Stimulates Uptake and Ntcp Translocation in HuH-Ntcp Cells—If the effect of cAMP is mediated via PKCζ, activation of PKCζ independent of cAMP should also stimulate TC uptake and Ntcp translocation. This hypothesis was tested by determining TC uptake and Ntcp translocation in HuH-Ntcp cells transiently transfected with WT PKCζ,DNPKCζ, or WT PKCζ + DN PKC-ζ. PKCζ activity in HuH-Ntcp cells transfected with WT PKC-ζ was more than 2-fold higher than in cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 7). This increase in PKC-ζ activity was abolished when the expression of WT PKCζ was inhibited by cotransfecting HuH-Ntcp cells with 10-fold excess of DN PKCζ; DN PKCζ alone did not affect basal PKCζ activity. Similar to the effect on PKC-ζ activity, the expression of WT PKCζ also increased TC uptake and plasma membrane Ntcp content, and these effects were inhibited by cotransfection with 10-fold excess DN PKCζ (Fig. 7). These results would indicate that PKC-ζ is involved in the regulation of TC uptake and Ntcp translocation. Cross-talk between PKB and PKCζ—Recent studies suggest that PKCζ may be involved in PKB activation (37Newton A.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 40Hodgkinson C.P. Sale E.M. Sale G.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10351-10359Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and our previous studies suggested a role for the PI3K/PKB signaling pathway in cAMP-induced Ntcp translocation (11Webster C.R. Srinivasulu U. Ananthanarayanan M. Suchy F.J. Anwer M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28578-28583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, the effect of PKCζ observed in the present study may involve PKB. To assess possible interactions between PKCζ and PKB in cAMP-induced Ntcp translocation, we determined the effect of PKCζ PS and DN PKCζ on cAMP-induced PKB activation. PKCζ PS (100 μm but not 10 μm) inhibited cAMP-induced activation of PKB in hepatocytes (Fig. 8). Likewise, cAMP failed to stimulate PKB in HuH-Ntcp cells transiently transfected with DN PKCζ (Fig. 9); DN PKCζ inhibited cAMP-induced increases in PKCζ by 80% as in Fig. 6. Both PKCζ PS and DN PKCζ decreased basal PKB activity by 20%, although this decrease did not reach statistical significance. These results raised the possibility that PKCζ may be a positive regulator of PKB in hepatocytes. However, when PKCζ activity was increased 2.8 ± 0.35-fold (n = 3) by transfecting HuH-Ntcp cells with WT PKCζ, there was no increase in PKB activity (1.1 ± 0.13 relative to empty vector). Thus, it would seem that cAMP-induced activation of PKB is dependent on cAMP-induced activation of PKCζ, but PKCζ does not affect basal PKB activity.Fig. 9Dominant-negative PKCζ inhibits cAMP-induced increases in PKB activity in HuH-Ntcp cells. Cells were transiently transfected with 5.0 μg of empty vector or DN PKCζ and incubated for 48 h in culture. Cells were serum-deprived for 3 h and then exposed to 100 μm CPT-cAMP (+cAMP) or buffer (–cAMP) for 15 min followed by determination of PKB activity. Typical immunoblots are shown at the top, and results of densitometric analysis (means ± S.E.; n = 3) are shown at the bottom. *, significantly different from respective–cAMP values. pPKB, phospho-PKB; tPKB, total PKB.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further define the possible mechanism of interaction between PKB and PKCζ, we determined the effect of DN PKB on cAMP-stimulated PKCζ activity. It is interesting that neither basal nor cAMP-stimulated PKCζ activity was affected in HuH-Ntcp cells transiently transfected with DN PKB (Fig. 10); DN PKB decreased cAMP-stimulated PKB activity as previously reported (11Webster C.R.

Furthermore, stimulation of PKB activity in HuH-Ntcp cells by constitutively active PKB was not associated with a change in PKCζ activity (0.9 ± 0.11, n = 3); constitutively active PKB (1.0 μg) increased PKB activity 7-fold in HuH-Ntcp cells as reported previously (11Webster C.R.

The moderate recognition of 15-oxo-PGE2 is consistent with a broad substrate specificity of LTB4 12-HD/PGR. The structure also implies that a Src homology domain 3 may interact with the left-handed proline-rich helix at the dimer interface and regulate LTB4 12-HD/PGR activity by disruption of the substrate binding pore to accommodate the ω-chain.

It is involved in the relaxation of smooth muscle cells to protect against lung inflammation (5Pavord I.D. Tattersfield A.E. Lancet. 1995; 345: 436-438Abstract PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), regulating gastric acid and mucus secretion in the stomach (6Miller T.A. Am. J.

PGE2, LTB4, and LXA4 are rapidly degraded by separate enzymatic pathways, but the bifunctional LTB4 12-HD/PGR performs the first irreversible step of each degradation pathway (Fig. 1).

Although the Km values for both substrates are almost identical, the kcat value for 15-oxo-PGE2 reduction is approximately 200 times higher than that for LTB4 oxidation. Some NSAIDs, which primarily act as cyclooxygenase inhibitors, also inhibit LTB4 12-HD/PGR activity in vitro (21Clish C.B. Sun Y.P. Serhan C.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The enzyme has been identified as dithiolethione-inducible gene-1 product, suggesting that increased metabolism of LTB4 inhibits tumorigenesis (22Primiano T. Li Y. Kensler T.W. Trush M.A. Sutter T.R.

Here we report the crystal structure of the LTB4 12-HD/PGR, the binary complex structures with NADP+, and the ternary complex structure of LTB4 12-HD/PGR with NADP+ and 15-oxo-PGE2.

Glutathione S-transferase-LTB4 12-HD/PGR was purified with a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden), and the N-terminal glutathione S-transferase was cleaved with thrombin (Wako) for 20 h at room temperature, followed by further purification by cation exchange chromatography on a Mono S column (Amersham Biosciences) with 0-150 mm NaCl gradient. The sample (20 mg/ml) was crystallized by the batch method using the automated crystallization system TERA (24Sugahara M. Miyano M. Tanpakushitsu Kakusan Koso. 2002; 47: 1026-1032PubMed Google Scholar) by mixing equal volumes of protein solution (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and precipitating solution (100 mm 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid (pH 5.5-6.8), 17.5-27.5% polyethylene glycol 4000, and 50 mm MgCl2) at 18 °C. The binary complex contained 10 mm NADP+ in the crystallization solution, whereas the ternary complex included 10 mm NADP+ and 3.3 mm 15-oxo-PGE2. Crystals appeared within 1 week and belonged to the monoclinic space group P21. The solvent content of the crystals is 48%, calculated from a Vm value of 2.37 (25Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7909) Google Scholar). Structural Determination and Refinement—x-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K at SPring-8 with an R-AXIS V detector (Rigaku) for the Se-Met derivative and a Jupiter CCD (Rigaku) for the remaining data sets (Table I). For cryo-cooling, the Se-Met derivative crystal was soaked in the precipitating solution including trehalose, increasing the concentration stepwise from 5% (w/v) up to 30% (w/v), whereas the other crystals were treated with a 1:1 paraffin/Paratone-N mixture (Hampton Research). All data sets were processed using HKL2000 (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38440) Google Scholar). For the Se-Met derivative, 17 of the possible 20 Se sites were identified using Patterson methods in a SOLVE/RESOLVE (27Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). The phases were improved by non-crystallographic symmetry averaging and solvent flattening with DM (28Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19729) Google Scholar). The overall figure of merit for the final experimental phases was 0.75. The structural models were built using O (29Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar) and refined by simulated annealing and energy minimization methods with CNS (30Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L.

Open table in a new tab Chloride ions were identified by identifying water molecules with very low B-factors compared with surrounding protein residues or those with residual high electron density peaks in|Fo| -|Fc| difference Fourier maps (Table I). If the surrounding coordination sphere was consistent with chloride, the water molecule was changed to a chloride ion. For the apo structure, residues 12-16, 107-108, and 244-250 of one subunit were not included in the model because of poor or no electron density. For the ternary complex, the N-terminal methionine residue of one subunit is missing. In most models, a part of the N-terminal thrombin digestion site, Ser-Pro-Glu-Phe, was also identified. Several regions exhibited multiple conformations, including residues 124, 213, 280, and 281 in the apo structure and residues 272-274 in the ternary complex. The geometries of the final models were verified using PROCHECK (31Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and only one residue, Leu-105 of apo structure, is in generous region of Ramachandran plot. Leu-105 is located in a disordered flexible loop. The average B-factors of the NADP+ binding site residues (shown in Fig. 3A) are 24.1, 20.6, and 17.3 Å2 in the apo, binary, and ternary complexes, respectively, and those of NADP+ are 17.7 and 15.0 Å2 in the binary and ternary complexes, respectively. The average B-factors of the residues lining the ω-chain binding pore (in Fig. 3D) are 26.4, 24.0, and 20.3 Å2 in the apo, binary, and ternary complexes, respectively, and that of the ω-chain of the ternary complex is 38.8 Å2. In the ternary complex, only the ω-chain of 15-oxo-PGE2 was defined in the electron density map. The ω-chain was modeled in the keto-form, because resolution was too low to allow distinction between keto- and enolate-forms. Absorption Spectrum of the Ternary Complex in Solution—Two aliquots of a ternary complex solution (1.6 mg/ml enzyme, 10 mm NADP+, and 0.5 mm 15-oxo-PGE2) were incubated for 3 h in the crystallization solution without the precipitant, polyethylene glycol 4000. An equal volume of solutions with or without 10 mm NADPH was then mixed into the ternary complex solution. A half-volume of 2 n NaOH was further added into both solutions to allow measurement of the residual 15-oxo-PGE2 (32Hansen H.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 574: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The incubated ternary complex solution was ultrafiltered by Millipore Ultrafree®-MC centrifugal filter units (5,000 nominal molecular weight limit) to examine whether the colored material(s) is bound to LTB4 12-HD/PGR. Absorption spectra were measured for each reaction mixture solution using a Shimadzu MultiSpec-1500. The reaction mixture without the enzyme was used as a reference. For the ternary complex solutions without NADPH addition, a 10× diluted sample was measured after NaOH addition. Molecular Graphics—The figures were prepared with Molscript (33Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), Bobscript (34Esnouf R.M. J. Mol. Graph. 1997; 15: 132-134Crossref Scopus (1794) Google Scholar), and Raster3D (35Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3873) Google Scholar). Overall Structure of LTB412-HD/PGR—LTB4 12-HD/PGR is a homodimer with 2-fold symmetry (Fig. 2). As a member of the MDR family, it exhibits a typical alcohol dehydrogenase fold (36Clarke A.R. Dafforn T.R. Simmott M. Comprehensive Biological Catalysis. 3. Academic Press, New York1998: 1-76Google Scholar). Each monomer comprises a catalytic domain (residues 1-122 and 293-329) and a nucleotide binding domain (residues 123-292) arranged around a Rossmann fold. The substrates, NADP+ and 15-oxo-PGE2, are bound at the active site clefts located between the catalytic and nucleotide binding domains (Fig. 2). NADP+Binding to LTB412-HD/PGR in the NADP+Complex Structure—In the binary complex structures, the bound NADP+ is in the anti configuration of the ribose-nicotinamide glycosidic bond, as commonly observed in alcohol dehydrogenases (36Clarke A.R. Dafforn T.R. Simmott M. Comprehensive Biological Catalysis. 3. Academic Press, New York1998: 1-76Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). NADP+ forms a number of hydrogen bonds with LTB4 12-HD/PGR, some of which are mediated by ordered water molecules. The amino acid residues lining the NADP+ binding sites are well conserved in the LTB4 12-HD/PGRs of all species but not among the MDR family (Fig. 4). This may explain why the substrates directly interact with the bound NADP+(H). A well ordered hydrogen bond network around the 2′-hydroxyl group of the nicotine amide ribose contains two water molecules (W1 and W2) that are proposed to facilitate catalysis by stabilizing an enolate of the 15-carbonyl group of 15-oxo-PGE2 through hydrogen bond formation (Fig. 3A). Tyr-245, whose hydroxyl group may be a proton donor to the 2′-hydroxyl group, is conserved among known LTB4 12-HD/PGRs from various species (20Yamamoto T. Yokomizo T. Nakao A. Izumi T. Shimizu T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 6105-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 22Primiano T. Li Y. Kensler T.W. Trush M.A. Sutter T.R. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 999-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 37Yokomizo T. Ogawa Y. Uozumi N. Kume K. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2844-2850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 38Boll W. Schmid C.T. Semenza G. Mantei N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12901-12911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hydroxyl group of Tyr-245 also makes a hydrogen bond with the main chain nitrogen of Ala-241. Water W1 is a proton acceptor from the main chain nitrogen of Tyr-49 as well as a proton donor to the bound water W2. W2 is a proton donor to the carboxyl group of Asp-47 and the phosphate group of the NADP+. The LTB412-HD/PGR, NADP+, and 15-Oxo-PGE2Ternary Complex—The LTB4 12-HD/PGR ternary complex crystal has a faint brown color (Fig. 3B), as observed in the enzyme solution with 20 mm NADP+ and 0.5 mm 15-oxo-PGE2 at neutral pH. The ternary complex solution mixture turned a faint brown color over time with a maximum absorption peak of 475 nm, characteristic of an enolate intermediate (Fig. 3C). The solution became colorless upon addition of 10 mm NADPH, whereas the addition of 0.4 m NaOH to the ternary complex mixture resulted in a much denser brown color with an absorption peak at 500 nm (Fig. 3C). These color changes have been utilized as an enzyme assay to quantify the remaining 15-oxo-PGE2 (32Hansen H.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 574: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The addition of NADPH propagates the reduction of the 15-oxo-PGE2 complex (faint brown) to 13,14-dihydro-15-oxo-PGE2 (colorless). Ultrafiltration analysis showed that the faint brown chromophore in the ternary complex mixture was retained in the LTB4 12-HD/PGR protein fraction, and the absorption density of 475 nm concentrated proportionally to the ternary complex. These results indicate that the conversion of the colored 15-oxo-PGE2 intermediate to colorless 15-oxo-PGE2 is reversible. In addition, the intermediate remains bound to the active site of the enzyme. In the crystal structure of the ternary complex, only the ω-chain (from C12 to C20) of 15-oxo-PGE2 was defined in the electron density (Fig. 3D). The α,β-unsaturated 15-oxo moiety of the bound 15-oxo-PGE2 is in direct van der Waals contact with the nicotine amide ring of the bound NADP+ (Fig. 3E). The ω-chain tail is buried in the hydrophobic pore composed of loop βE-αF and helices α1 and αF at the dimer interface (Figs. 2 and 3D). The 15-carbonyl group of the ω-chain forms hydrogen bonds with the 2′-hydroxyl group of the nicotine amide ribose and the bound water W1 (Fig. 3E). The carbon atoms C12 to C16 including the 15-carbonyl oxygen in the ω-chain are co-planar with a geometry consistent with the configuration of the conjugated α,β-unsaturated carbonyl. The plane lies parallel to the nicotine amide ring of NADP+ with a π-π orbital interaction, which may produce the faint brown chromophore as a charge transfer complex (Fig. 3E). The conjugated 15-carbonyl of the ω-chain is stabilized by a hydrogen bonding network allowing formation of the enolate intermediate (Fig. 3D). An enolate formation should cause electron deficiency of the conjugated C13 atom as the putative hydride ion acceptor in the reductase reaction. The distance of 3.8 Å between the C13 atom and the C4 position of the nicotine amide ring, the proposed hydride donor, allows for hydride transfer (36Clarke A.R. Dafforn T.R. Simmott M. Comprehensive Biological Catalysis. 3. Academic Press, New York1998: 1-76Google Scholar) (Figs. 3E and 5). Hydrophobic residues from both subunits comprise the ω-chain binding pore at the dimer interface (Fig. 3D). The alkyl chain between C16 and C20 of the ω-chain is surrounded by Tyr-49 and Ile-52 on helix α1, and Ala-241, Tyr-245, and Met-248 on the βE-αF loop and Ile-271 on the edge of strand βF of the NADP+-bound subunit, and by Pro-257(B), Glu-258(B), Ile-261(B), and Tyr-262(B) on the helix αF of the countersubunit (B). These residues are likely to recognize the ω-chain and determine LTB4 12-HD/PGR specificity, as they are highly conserved among LTB4 12-HD/PGRs but not among MDR families (20Yamamoto T. Yokomizo T. Nakao A. Izumi T. Shimizu T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 6105-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 22Primiano T. Li Y. Kensler T.W. Trush M.A. Sutter T.R.

Zhang H. Tai H.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 20Yamamoto T. Yokomizo T. Nakao A. Izumi T. Shimizu T. Eur. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 40803-40810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). 15-Oxo-PGE2 and 15-oxo-LXA4 have a conjugated double bond, which is in equilibrium with the α,β-conjugated enolate as the reaction intermediate. The 2′-hydroxyl group of the nicotine amide ribose and the water W1 promote enolate formation by forming hydrogen bonds with the O15 carbonyl oxygen of the ω-chain, which stabilize the intermediate (Figs. 3D and 5). The electron-deficient C13 atom in the conjugated enolate may be directly attacked by the A-side (pro-R) hydride anion (Ha) of the C4 atom of the nicotine amide of NADPH (Fig. 5). The hydride anion should then transfer to the pro-S position of the enolate intermediate (39Benkovic S.J. Hammes-Schiffer S. Science. 2003; 301: 1196-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Thus, the C14 atom of the enolate anion intermediate would be protonated at the final step of the reaction. The mechanism of the β-ketoreductase reaction is identical to that of an enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, whose enolate anion intermediate is stabilized by hydrogen bonds with the 2′-hydroxyl group of the nicotine amide ribose (40Rozwarski D.A. Vilcheze C. Sugantino M. Bittman R. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15582-15589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This catalytic mechanism may be a common feature of β-ketoreductase reactions. For the LTB4 oxidase reaction of LTB4 12-HD/PGR, some hydrophilic groups would be required as catalytic residues. In the LTB4 12-HD/PGR structure, Tyr-262 from the other subunit is the only candidate catalytic residue considering both the orientation of the side chain and conservation among species (20Yamamoto T. Yokomizo T. Nakao A. Izumi T. Shimizu T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 6105-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 22Primiano T. Li Y. Kensler T.W. Trush M.A. Sutter T.R.

Chem. 1993; 268: 12901-12911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3D). Domain Movement—Moderate domain movements are observed upon NADP+ binding compared with the apo form. The NADP+ binding site is wider in both the binary and ternary complexes than in the apo form. Superimposing the nucleotide binding domains of the apo and ternary complex structures of LTB4 12-HD/PGR revealed that the distances between the center of masses of each domain are 0.41 Å in the nucleotide binding domain and 1.14 Å in the catalytic domain, respectively. This corresponds to a domain rotation of ∼1.6o. The most notable structural difference is in the binding site of the adenine moiety of NADP+, residues 316-323 on the helix α3 and the loop α3-β10. Although there are no direct interactions between these residues and NADP+ (Fig. 3A), the region is forced to open upon NADP+ binding as a result of steric hindrance with the adenine moiety of NADP+. This local conformational change may induce the entire domain movement. Such domain movement is also observed in Thermus thermophilus quinone oxide reductase (QOR) (41Shimomura Y. Kakuta Y. Fukuyama K. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4211-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and Candida tropicali enoyl thioester reductase (42Airenne T.T. Torkko J.M. Van den Plas S. Sormunen R.T. Kastaniotis A.J. Wierenga R.K. Hiltunen J.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), although in these cases domain movement operates to close the NADP+ binding site upon NADP+ binding. A similar domain movement has also been reported for a zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (43Eklund H. Branden C.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3458-3461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that this phenomenon is common to members of the alcohol dehydrogenase family. The orientations of each subunit differ between LTB4 12-HD/PGR and QOR (Fig. 6). Superimposing the nucleotide binding domains of one subunit of LTB4 12-HD/PGR and E. coli. QOR (44Thorn J.M. Barton J.D. Dixon N.E. Ollis D.L. Edwards K.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 785-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) revealed that the distance of the center of masses of each nucleotide binding domain is 1.1 Å in the superimposed and 9.3 Å in the countersubunit. Fifty-three residues (16.1%) are identical between guinea pig LTB4 12-HD/PGR (329 amino acid(s)) and E. coli QOR (328 amino acid(s)) (Fig. 4). In the dimer of LTB4 12-HD/PGR, both active sites are closer than those of QOR (Fig. 6). In addition, there is a cavity between subunits (Figs. 2 and 6). Interestingly, the ω-chain binding pore in LTB4 12-HD/PGR is in the dimer interface neighboring the cavity (Fig. 2). A Left-handed Polyproline II Helix (PPII Helix) Recognition and Activity Regulation by SH3 Domain Binding—The PPII helix of the loop βE-αF may be recognized by the SH3 domain. The enzyme activity could be modulated by the change in the interface interaction of the ω-chain binding pore architecture, which includes Ala-241, Tyr-245, Met-248, Pro-257(B), Glu-258(B), Ile-261(B), and Tyr-262(B) in the vicinity of the loop (Fig 7A). The sequence of the PPII helix, Leu-251-Pro-Pro-Gly-Pro-Ser-256, is conserved among LTB4 12-HD/PGRs in all known species (20Yamamoto T. Yokomizo T. Nakao A. Izumi T. Shimizu T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 6105-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 23Dick R.A. Kwak M.-K. Sutter T.R. Kensler T.W. J. Biol.

Parallels can be drawn to that of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which is bound by the SH3 domain of Fyn (45Renzoni D.A. Pugh D.J. Siligardi G. Das P. Morton C.J. Rossi C. Waterfield M.D. Campbell I.D. Ladbury J.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15646-15653Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7B). In the case of LTB4 12-HD/PGR, Pro-252, Pro-253, and Pro-255 occupy the P-1, P0, and P2 positions, respectively, and may be recognized by a proline-rich binding groove of an SH3 domain. SH3 recognition sequences often include a basic residue at either the N- or C-terminal side of the P-X-X-P motif (46Nguyen J.T. Turck C.W. Cohen F.E. Zuckermann R.N. Lim W.A. Science. 1998; 282: 2088-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In LTB4 12-HD/PGR Arg-247 is at the N-terminal side of the PPII helix and forms part of a β-turn structure. The guanidino group of Arg-247 occupies a similar position to that of the p85 subunit phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase structure (45Renzoni D.A. Pugh D.J. Siligardi G. Das P. Morton C.J. Rossi C. Waterfield M.D. Campbell I.D. Ladbury J.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15646-15653Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7B). These similar structures suggest that the PPII helix in LTB4 12-HD/PGR binds to a specific SH3 domain to regulate enzymatic activity, as described for 5-lipoxygenase. The activity of 5-lipoxygenase is regulated by a tyrosine kinase (47Lepley R.A. Muskardin D.T. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6179-6184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), which modulates binding of the SH3 domain of the growth factor-bound receptor protein 2 (Grb2) to the proline-rich region of 5-lipoxygenase (48Lepley R.A. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24163-24168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We propose that binding of an SH3 domain to LTB4 12-HD/PGR modulates enzyme activity by causing domain re-orientation. The open conformation of the dimer may allow adequate changes of the dihedral angles of the loop βE-αF residues on both sides of the PPII helix, such that an SH3 domain can be bound to each subunit (Fig. 7C). The SH3 domain binding followed by domain re-orientation should disturb the hydrophobic pore, which accommodates the ω-chain of 15-oxo-PGE2. This would result in an LTB4 12-HD/PGR·SH3 complex, which is no longer able to bind substrate (Fig. 7C). Therefore, we propose that there is a currently unknown protein with an SH3 domain that recognizes the PPII helix and thus regulates LTB4 12-HD/PGR activity. The eicosanoid degradation pathway may thus be regulated by a protein with an SH3 domain, similar to that seen for the LTB4 synthesis pathway.

https://openalex.org/W1997510900,"We have used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to measure p53-dependent histone acetylation at the p21, MDM2, and PUMA promoters. The pattern of histone acetylation was different at each promoter. H3 and H4 acetylation increased at both the p21 and PUMA promoters in response to p53 activation, whereas there was only a minimal increase in H4 acetylation and no increase in H3 acetylation at the MDM2 promoter. The high p53 occupancy of the p21, MDM2 and PUMA promoters has been attributed to the presence of two p53 binding sites in these promoters, but mutation of the p53 binding sites in integrated p21 promoter constructs showed that the two sites in the p21 promoter do not cooperate to stabilize p53 binding. Despite 10-fold higher p53 binding to the proximal than the distal site in the p21 promoter, both sites showed similar patterns of H3 and H4 acetylation. Mutation of the binding sites showed that acetylation of the proximal, low-affinity site requires p53 binding to that site but not to the distal, high-affinity site. Since low-affinity p53 binding sites can confer strong acetylation, the DNA binding affinity in vitro is an unreliable guide to the likely importance of p53 in regulating candidate target genes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2148535148,"The regulation of gene expression via the histone code has, for the most part, revealed that histone modifications cause the recruitment of adaptor proteins that indirectly regulate the synthesis of RNA. Using purified factors to assemble and modify the chromatin and to transcribe the DNA, we investigated whether modifications of histones may directly impact the RNA polymerase II transcription process. We screened proteins known to modify histones for effects on transcription, and we found that the mitogen- and stress-induced kinase, MSK1, inhibited RNA synthesis. Inhibition of transcription by MSK1 was most sensitive when the template was in chromatin, as naked DNA templates were resistant to the effects of MSK1. We found that MSK1 phosphorylated histone H2A on serine 1, and mutation of serine 1 to alanine blocked the inhibition of transcription by MSK1. Furthermore, we found that acetylation of histone H3 by the p300 and CREB-binding protein associated factor, PCAF, suppressed the kinase-dependent inhibition of transcription. These results suggest that acetylation of histones may stimulate transcription by suppressing an inhibitory phosphorylation by a kinase as MSK1.

In eukaryotic cells, genomic DNA is ensheathed in chromatin. The core component is the histone octamer bound to DNA to comprise the nucleosome. Nucleosomes are in turn spaced and arrayed by nuclear machinery to effectively open or close the DNA to facilitate or repress gene expression. It has become clear that histone proteins become tagged to signal the activation or repression of genes, and the covalent tags have become known as the histone code (1Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6507) Google Scholar, 2Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7538) Google Scholar). Modifications, which include acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination, result in binding by other chromatin effector proteins to add (or remove) other tags or modify the chromatin, or the tag may be bound by a transcription factor that catalyzes the initiation of RNA synthesis. As an example, phosphorylation of H3 at serine 10 stimulates acetylation of lysine 14 of H3, which in turn recruits TFIID 1The abbreviations used are: TF, transcription factor; MSK, mitogen- and stress-induced kinase; PCAF, p300 and CREB-binding protein associated factor; ACF, ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor; TAU, Triton/acid/urea; nt, nucleotide(s); HAT, histone acetyltransferase. 1The abbreviations used are: TF, transcription factor; MSK, mitogen- and stress-induced kinase; PCAF, p300 and CREB-binding protein associated factor; ACF, ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor; TAU, Triton/acid/urea; nt, nucleotide(s); HAT, histone acetyltransferase.

Phosphorylation of H2A and H4 occur, but the downstream effects of phosphorylation of these subunits are unknown.

The MSK proteins have been shown to stimulate transcription in cells via phosphorylation of H3 serine 10, and it has recently been found that this activity primarily resides in the MSK2 protein (18Soloaga A.

In the current study, we found, to our surprise, that the MSK1 protein negatively regulated transcription via a phosphorylation of H2A, and we found that the acetylation state of the nucleosomes affected this phosphorylation reaction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Templates—G-less cassette construct G5E4 contained GAL4 response elements, the adenoviral E4 promoter, and a sequence containing no guanines in the coding strand from the transcription start site to 384 base pairs downstream. All transcription reactions include an internal basal control template, pΔML-200, which encoded a 210-base pair G-less cassette.Histone Octamer Preparations—HeLa core histones were purified from the chromatin pellet of whole cell extracts (19Manley J.L.

Full-length histone genes were isolated using full-length IMAGE clones purchased from Invitrogen. The human histone genes were subcloned into pET-21a for expression as untagged proteins in bacteria. IMAGE clones used were: 2988620 (H2A), 2989839 (H2B), 2988279 (H3), and 5113140 (H4). The sequences of the expression constructs were confirmed. Details of the subcloning can be obtained from the authors upon request. Individual histone proteins were purified from inclusion bodies, purified by ion exchange chromatography, mixed with the other histone proteins, slowly renatured, and ∼110-kDa histone octamers were isolated by gel filtration, essentially according to published methods (3Agalioti T.

Briefly, each chromatin assembly reaction (30 μl) contained 0.5 μg of pG5E4, 0.5 μgofpΔML-200, and 1.4 μg of histone octamers. For recombinant human histones, histone octamer preparations were premixed with 100 nm NAP-1 for 30 min on ice, then incubated with 4 nm Acf-1, 7 nm imitation switch, and DNA templates at 27 °C for 5 h in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 1% polyvinyl alcohol, 1% polyethylene glycol, 25 mm MgCl2, and 4 mm ATP. For histone octamer purified from HeLa cells or butyrate-treated HeLa cells, histones were premixed with 2 μm NAP-1 and then incubated with 10 nm Acf-1, 18 nm imitation switch. When PCAF was tested, histone octamer were first incubated with PCAF and 10 μm acetyl-CoA (Amersham Biosciences) in the assembly buffer for 1 h at 30 °C, followed by the chromatin assembly reaction.In Vitro Transcription Assay—Transcription reactions were performed in a 25-μl volume containing 20 nm Tris-OAc, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 6 mm Mg(OAc)2, 90 mm KOAc, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 4 μm ZnSO4, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μm each of ATP and UTP, 2.5 μm CTP, 50 μm 3′-OMe-GTP, 30 ng of each DNA template (naked or chromatin), and 10 μCi of [α-32P]CTP. Transcription factors included 100 ng of TFIIA, 60 ng of TFIIB, 4 ng of TFIIE, 100 ng of TFIIF, 40 ng of core pol II, 0.8 μl of immunoaffinity purified TFIID, 0.5 μl of TFIIH fraction, and 100 ng of PC4. 30 ng of GAL4-VP16 as an activator was added where indicated. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 90 min, terminated, and processed using standard procedures (24Mondal N. Parvin J.D. Nature. 2001; 413: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Gels were dried and exposed to film with an intensifying screen, generally for 16–24 h. Radioactive bands were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences).Protein Kinase Assay—Active MSK1 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Protein kinase assays were performed in a 50-μl volume containing 20 mm Tris-OAc, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 6 mm Mg(OAc)2, 90 mm KOAc, 0.75 μg of histone (free histone or chromatin), 4 mm ATP, the indicated amount of kinase, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences). The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 60 min. After precipitation with 20% trichloroacetic acid and washing with 100% acetone, the pellets were dissolved in the appropriate loading buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE (17% gel) or Triton/acid/urea (TAU) gel electrophoresis (25Ryan C.A.

Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 and destained before drying for autoradiography.RESULTSMSK1 Inhibits Transcription from Chromatin Templates—We tested several enzymes, which are known to modify histones, for effects on in vitro transcription assays. We found that one of these, MSK1, exerted a strong inhibitory effect on RNA synthesis. The transcription factors were all purified mammalian proteins: TFIIA, -B, -D, -E, -F, -H, core RNA polymerase II, and cofactor PC4. Histone octamers were initially purified from HeLa cells, and these octamers were assembled into DNA-bound chromatin using ACF and nucleosome assembly protein 1 (NAP1) (21Ito T. Levenstein M.E. Fyodorov D.V. Kutach A.K. Kobayashi R. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1529-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Micrococcal nuclease assays of these templates revealed that these templates contained a high quality of chromatin (Supplementary Materials Fig. S1), and by other measures developed in this study (see below), the histone octamers were effectively converted to nucleosomes on DNA. We had earlier shown that transcription from chromatin templates requires a topoisomerase activity for elongation (24Mondal N. Parvin J.D. Nature. 2001; 413: 435-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), but when using the ACF chromatin assembly system, we found that the topoisomerase was not absolutely required as there was a low level of transcription, and the topoisomerase was stimulatory to transcription on these templates (23Mondal N. Zhang Y. Jonsson Z. Dhar S.K. Kannapiran M. Parvin J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5016-5024Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (and data not shown). In the described experiments in this study, the effects of the tested histone modifications on the transcription reaction were the same regardless of the inclusion of topoisomerase (data not shown), and for the sake of maintaining as simple a transcription system as possible we omitted the topoisomerase from the assembly and the transcription reactions used in the figures.We tested whether MSK1 can modulate transcription in this purified factor system from these chromatin templates using HeLa-derived histones. We had anticipated that MSK1 would stimulate RNA synthesis because modification of H3 by MSK factors has been reported to be stimulatory to transcription (18Soloaga A. Thomson S. Wiggin G.R. Rampersaud N. Dyson M.H. Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. Arthur J.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2788-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). To our surprise, MSK1 inhibited the transcription activated by GAL4-VP16 on chromatin templates (Fig. 1A). Transcription reactions were identical and only differed in the state of the DNA (naked in lanes 1–4 and chromatin in lanes 5–8) and in MSK1 concentration. At high MSK1 concentrations, transcription on naked templates was modestly inhibited, and this was probably because of either an inhibitory modification of a transcription factor, or a nonspecific inhibition because of the MSK1 preparation. By contrast, the inhibition of transcription by MSK1 was more profound and occurred at lower concentrations of kinase in identical reactions except that the template was chromatin. The levels of RNA synthesis were very consistent, and results, from three or more repeat experiments, were quantified in Fig. 1D. The most striking effect of MSK1 was observed when quantifying the levels of activated transcription, rather than total transcription. The values represent the ratio of GAL4-VP16-stimulated transcription (390-nt band) to basal transcription (210-nt band), and the ratio was set at 100% in the absence of MSK1 (Fig. 1D). On chromatin DNA templates, compared with the absence of MSK1, GAL4-VP16-stimulated transcription was repressed more than 60% in the presence of 16 nm MSK1, a significant difference from the inhibition of transcription on naked DNA templates by MSK1.We next tested whether the acetylation of histones in chromatin affects the inhibition of transcription by MSK1. Histones purified from butyrate-treated HeLa cells were hyperacetylated (Supplementary Materials Fig. S2), and these were assembled into chromatin and tested in transcription. We found that the hyperacetylated histone octamers enhanced GAL4-VP16-stimulated transcription (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 5) and significantly reversed the inhibition of transcription by MSK1 (Fig. 1, B and D). This result suggested that the acetylation of histones could negatively affect the inhibition of transcription by MSK1. Because both histone preparations, HeLa and But-HeLa, contained acetylated proteins, and because bacterially expressed recombinant factors lack modifications such as acetylation, we tested the role of acetylation of histones in this reaction using recombinant human histones purified from bacteria. When using chromatin containing recombinant human histones the inhibitory effects of MSK1 occurred at a lower concentration of MSK1 and to a higher level of total inhibition than with chromatin containing histones purified from HeLa cells (Fig. 1, C and D). At the highest concentration of MSK1 tested, the inhibition of transcription by MSK1 was ∼80% when the chromatin contained recombinant histones, ∼60% with HeLa histones, and less than 40% with either hyperacetylated HeLa histones or naked templates. The reaction conditions were equivalent with regard to basal transcription factors, the DNA templates, assembly factors, and MSK1. The only differences were the state of the histones in the chromatin. These results indicated that MSK1 inhibited transcription with chromatin templates. In addition, pre-existing acetylation of histones on chromatin could block the inhibition of GAL4-VP16-stimulated transcription by MSK1.Inhibition by MSK1 Is Specific for Transcription Stimulated by GAL4-VP16 —Both GAL4-VP16-activated and basal transcription decreased as MSK1 was added to the chromatin-containing reaction but the stimulated transcript was disproportionately affected (Fig. 1). Because the longer transcript was more sensitive to the effects of MSK1, either the elongation rate or the activation process was negatively affected by the MSK1 kinase. To determine the role of GAL4-VP16 in the inhibition of transcription, the inhibitory effects of MSK1 were tested in the absence of GAL4-VP16 using the chromatin containing recombinant histones. Under these basal transcription conditions, MSK1 modestly decreased the levels of RNA product, but the effects on the 390-nt transcript were balanced by the effects on the 210-nt internal control RNA. By contrast, the levels of transcription of the GAL4-VP16-stimulated RNA were disproportionately inhibited by the MSK1 (Fig. 2, A and B). Visual inspection of the gel reveals that the presence of the GAL4-VP16 activator strongly stimulated transcription of the 390-nt RNA (lane 5), but in the presence of 16 nm MSK1 the level of synthesis of the 390-nt RNA was equal to the basal levels (compare lane 8 to lane 4). These results indicated that inhibition of transcription by MSK1 directly affected the transcriptional activation process.Fig. 2MSK1 activity inhibits transcription stimulated by GAL4-VP16.A, chromatin templates assembled with recombinant human histones were tested in transcription reactions without (lanes 1–4) or with (lanes 5–8) GAL4-VP16. MSK1 was included as indicated. The exposure time of the autoradiograph in lanes 1–4 was longer than for lanes 5–8.

The results are based on three repeat experiments, and the relative transcription levels were calculated as in Fig. 1D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Substrate Specificity of MSK1 Kinase—MSK1 and MSK2 have been shown to be histone H3 kinases, but in living cells, MSK2 was the major H3 kinase (17Thomson S.

Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. Arthur J.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2788-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). To confirm that the H3 subunit was phosphorylated by MSK1 and to test whether this modification was responsible for the inhibition of activated transcription, kinase assays were performed using histone octamers purified from HeLa cells or from recombinant proteins expressed in bacteria. Consistent with prior observations, free histone octamers from both preparations were primarily modified on H3, with lower levels of phosphorylation detected on each of the other histones (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2). Because the migrations of histones were poorly resolved by standard SDS-PAGE, we confirmed the identities of phosphorylated histones using a TAU gel (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 5). The identities of the phosphorylated species were readily assigned in the case of the recombinant human histones, because the composition of these were uncomplicated (lanes 1 and 3). The interpretation of the HeLa-derived phosphorylated histones was more complex because multiple histone variants and modifications were present.Fig. 3Phosphorylation of histones by MSK1.A, chromatin made from recombinant human histones or HeLa histones (Chro, lanes 3–6) were incubated in vitro, with or without MSK1 and [γ-32P]ATP as indicated, to analyze the phosphorylation of histones. Reactions were resolved by SDS-PAGE (17%). Coomassie Blue staining (C.B.B.) revealed the relative migrations of histone octamers of rHH and HeLa on the same gel. Kinase reactions from free histone octamers (lanes 1 and 2) were exposed to film for shorter times than similar reactions using nucleosomes. B, resolution of MSK1 kinase reaction products on TAU gels. Recombinant human histones (lanes 1–3) were tested. In lane 1, purified histone octamers were analyzed by autoradiography of 32P-labeled bands after phosphorylation by MSK1. In lane 2, a similar reaction using DNA-associated chromatin as substrate for MSK1 is shown. In lane 3, Coomassie Blue-stained histone proteins were analyzed. Identification of the unmodified histones was determined by comparison with known migrations (25Ryan C.A. Annunziato A.T. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 21.22.10-21.22.21Google Scholar) and by comparison with the migrations of individual histone proteins (data not shown). MSK1 kinase reaction products using HeLa histone octamers as substrate were analyzed (lane 5) and compared with the Coomassie-stained proteins on the same gel (lane 4). The identities of the phosphorylated histones were assigned based on the shift relative to the Coomassie-stained polypeptides. Because the slowest migrating phosphorylated histone co-migrated with the H2A Coomassie band, we interpreted that it could not be H2A, but must instead be phospho-H3.1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Association of histones with DNA has been observed to affect the specificity of their modifications (26Hsu J.Y.

Cell. 2000; 102: 279-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). We tested whether the phosphorylation of histones by MSK1 was affected by association with DNA in chromatin. Surprisingly, phosphorylation of H3 by MSK1 was completely repressed in chromatin. Instead, the principal phosphorylated product was H2A when using recombinant human histones, and in chromatin from HeLa histones the main phosphorylated products were H4 and to a significantly lesser extent H2A (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 5). The sequences of the amino termini of H4 and H2A are very similar. The first eight residues of H4 match those of H2A except for the insertion of a glutamine at position 6. It is thus possible in the context of the histones purified from cells that the H4 and H2A amino termini have similar effects. We do not understand why phosphorylation of H4 was only observed in the HeLa-derived nucleosomes, but we suggest that the multiple histone variants and multiple modifications found in a cell (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Materials Fig. S2) cause this effect. That H2A was the principal phospho-product of MSK1 when using the chromatin from recombinant histones was confirmed by a TAU gel (Fig. 3B, lane 2). The nearly complete loss of phosphorylation of histone H3 suggested that there were few free histone octamers remaining in the chromatin preparations. Taken together, these results suggested that MSK1 repressed transcriptional activation on chromatin through phosphorylation of H2A. The quantitative difference between the effects on transcription of MSK1 on recombinant human histones and HeLa histones may reflect differences in phosphorylation of H2A.Acetylation of Histones Modulated the Effects of the MSK1 Kinase—The data in Fig. 1 suggested that acetylation of histones decreased the inhibitory effect of MSK1 activity on transcription. We tested candidate HAT proteins for modulating the effects of MSK1 by inclusion in the chromatin assembly reaction and then assaying in transcription. Acetylation of recombinant histones by the 93-kDa PCAF polypeptide stimulated transcription (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 5), which is consistent with the known stimulatory effect of acetylation on transcription in general. Of interest, this stimulatory effect of PCAF on transcription, independent of MSK1, was not observed with histone octamers purified from HeLa cells (data not shown), suggesting that the effects of the HAT activity were most effective if there were no baseline acetylations of the histones. As was predicted from the results of Fig. 1, pretreatment of histones with PCAF decreased the inhibitory effect on transcriptional activation by MSK1 (Fig. 4A). The results were highly reproducible, and significantly shifted the curve plotting the inhibition by MSK1 (Fig. 4B). The concentration of MSK1 at which the reaction was inhibited by 50% shifted from 5.5 to 8.5 nm. The magnitude of the effect of PCAF on the inhibition of transcription by MSK1 was small when comparing these results with those obtained using HeLa histones purified from butyrate-treated cells. This result was expected because the recombinant PCAF subunit would only affect a small percentage of the possible acetylations and with low efficiency. By comparison, the HAT domain of CBP did not affect the inhibition of transcription by MSK1 (data not shown). A protein kinase assay revealed that PCAF decreased the level of phosphorylation of H2A by MSK1 (Fig. 4C). Consistent with prior results (22Schiltz R.L. Mizzen C.A. Vassilev A. Cook R.G. Allis C.D.

Chem. 1999; 274: 1189-1192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), PCAF acetylated primarily histone H3 (Fig. 4D), suggesting that the effect of PCAF on the phosphorylation activity was not via a single polypeptide, but rather that there is a trans effect of acetylation of one histone subunit and phosphorylation of another.Fig. 4Acetylation of histones by recombinant PCAF suppresses the inhibition of activated transcription by MSK1.A, transcription on chromatin templates made from recombinant human histone octamers treated without (lanes 1–4) or with (lanes 5–8) PCAF before chromatin assembly.

Several stimuli including UV irradiation, arsenite treatment, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) bring about phosphorylation of histone H3, but until now, it was unknown whether cisplatin could induce such phosphorylation. In the present study, we investigated the phosphorylation state of histone H3 in cells treated with cisplatin as well as the signal transduction pathway mediating such an event. We discovered that the drug triggers specific phosphorylation of histone H3, mediated by the p38 MAPK pathway. We further report that hyperacetylation of histone H4 also occurred. These findings reveal a direct link between cisplatin treatment and chromosome modifications that can lead to structural changes with attendant modulation of function.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—Cisplatin was obtained as a gift from Johnson-Matthey. Antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Sodium butyrate was purchased from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, RPMI 1640 medium, and l-glutamine were obtained from Invitrogen. SKF86002 was bought from Calbiochem.Cell Culture—HeLa and MCF-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum on tissue culture plates at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Ntera II cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine on tissue culture plates at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. The cells were grown in medium to near 90% confluence and then pretreated with various concentrations of cisplatin for fixed times before the preparation of nuclear extracts. For studies with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SKF86002, cells were pre-incubated with 10 μm of the inhibitor for 1 h before cisplatin treatment.Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells as described in the Clontech TransFactor extraction kit (PT3612-2) with a slight modification. Briefly, HeLa cells were washed twice with 5 packed cell volumes of cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were collected and transferred to clean centrifuge tubes and then centrifuged for 5 min at 450 × g, after which the pellets were rinsed twice with an equal volume cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellets were resuspended with 5 packed cell volumes of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 15 min. The cells were spun down, and the pellets were resuspended with 2 packed cell volumes of ice-cold lysis buffer. The cells were lysed with 10 strokes of a narrow gauge syringe (catalog number 263/4). The suspension was spun at 11,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in a two-thirds volume extraction buffer comprising 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.5 mm MgCl2. The solution was homogenized with the narrow gauge syringe. The suspension was shaken for 30 min at 4 °C. The nuclear extract was spun at 20,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred in small aliquots and stored at –80 °C.Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 4–20% Tris-HCl minigel (Bio-Rad). Membranes containing proteins were incubated with specific histone antibodies as indicated in the figures and with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody separately and were detected with the ECL plus detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Actin was used as the loading control.RESULTSCisplatin Strongly Induces Histone H3 Ser-10 Phosphorylation in HeLa Cells—To study whether cisplatin activates a pathway leading to phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser-10, HeLa cells were pretreated with the drug (1 μm) for 16 h. HeLa nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting using a phospho-specific antibody against phosphorylated Ser-10 of histone H3. Cisplatin strongly induces the phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser-10 (Fig. 1A). A time course study revealed that platinum-stimulated phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser-10 increases monotonically with incubation time from 1 to 24 h (Fig. 1B). The phosphorylation level of histone H3 at Ser-10 also rises with increasing concentrations of cisplatin (Fig. 1C). trans-DDP, a stereoisomer of cisplatin that is not active against cancer, has no significant effect on the degree of H3 Ser-10 phosphorylation compared with cisplatin under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 2, lane 1).Fig. 2Inhibition of cisplatin-induced phosphorylation of H3 Ser-10 by SKF86002. HeLa nuclear extracts were pretreated with 1 μm trans-DDP (lane 1), 1 μm cisplatin and 10 μm p38 MAPK inhibitor (SKF86002) (lane 2), 10 μm p38 MAPK inhibitor (SKF86002) (lane 3), or 1 μm cisplatin (lane 4) overnight.

Interestingly, the induction of histone H3 phosphorylation was significantly greater in the Ntera II than the MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Cisplatin induction of phosphorylation of histone H3 in MCF-7 (top) and Ntera II (bottom) cell lines.

To explore whether p38 MAPK has a role in mediating cisplatin-induced phosphorylation of histone H3, we tested the effect of a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor, SKF86002, on the cisplatin-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 Ser-10. We prepared nuclear extracts from HeLa cells pretreated or untreated with SKF86002. The Western blot results revealed that the phosphorylation level of H3 Ser-10 induced by cisplatin is significantly reduced when cells were pretreated with SKF86002 (Fig. 2). This result suggests that cisplatin-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser-10 is mediated by the p38 MAPK pathway.Cisplatin Induces Other Histone Modifications—To explore other possible histone modification pathways activated by cisplatin, we analyzed HeLa nuclear extracts by Western blot using several modification-specific antibodies. The results demonstrate that cisplatin also induces phosphorylation of H3 at Ser-28 (Fig. 4A) and acetylation of histone H4 (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4Cisplatin induction of phosphorylation of H3 Ser-28 and acetylation of H4.

Cisplatin, a potent anti-cancer drug, forms platinum-DNA adducts and causes a variety of cellular responses. However, a relationship between cisplatin treatment and histone H3 modification had not previously been established.Cisplatin activates p38 MAPK for 8–12 h in sensitive cells and transiently for 1–3 h in resistant cells (16Losa J.H. Cobo C.P. Viniegra J.G. Lobo V.J.S.-A. Cajal S.R. Sánchez-Prieto R. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3998-4006Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 17Mansouri A. Ridgway L.D. Korapati A.L. Zhang Q.

Moreover, lack of p38 MAPK activation/function induces a resistant phenotype in human cells (16Losa J.H. Cobo C.P. Viniegra J.G. Lobo V.J.S.-A. Cajal S.R. Sánchez-Prieto R. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3998-4006Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 17Mansouri A. Ridgway L.D. Korapati A.L. Zhang Q. Tian L. Wang Y. Siddik Z.H. Mills G.B. Claret F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19245-19256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). MAP kinases may also play a role in modifying the chromatin environment of target genes. Here we show that SKF86002, a potent p38 inhibitor, inhibits cisplatin-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser-10. Furthermore, the p38 MAP kinase and downstream kinase MSK-1 have been reported to phosphorylate histone H3 Ser in vitro (13Zhong S.-P. Ma W.-Y. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20980-20984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 27Thomson S. Clayton A.L. Hazzalin C.A. Rose S. Barratt M.J. Mahadevan L.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4779-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Taken together, this evidence indicates that p38 MAPK mediates phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser-10 in response to cisplatin.Our results also indicate that the inactive isomer of cisplatin, trans-DDP, fails to induce phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser-10. Previous work revealed that both cisplatin and trans-DDP activate p38 MAPK differently. Only the active drug cisplatin can bring about long term activation (16Losa J.H. Cobo C.P. Viniegra J.G. Lobo V.J.S.-A. Cajal S.R. Sánchez-Prieto R. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3998-4006Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This difference in the kinetics of activation could account for their differential cytotoxicity.Cisplatin also modestly induces phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser-28. Phosphorylation at this site can also be triggered by UV irradiation, Trichostatin A, and other stimuli (34Zhong S. Zhang Y. Jansen C. Goto H. Inagaki M. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12932-12937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 35Zhong S. Goto H. Inagaki M. Dong Z. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5291-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The kinetics are very similar to those for Ser-10. Both Ser-10 and Ser-28 on histone H3 N-terminal tails are highly conserved and occur in the same consensus sequence, ARKS (22Hans F. Dimitrov S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar).There are two distinct modes of histone H3 phosphorylation, mitotic and stimulus-inducible. Both Ser-10 and Ser-28 on histone H3 are highly phosphorylated on condensed chromosomes during mitosis. The exact role of histone phosphorylation is still not fully understood, although several models have been proposed to explain such a process during mitosis (30Prigent C. Dimitrov S. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 3677-3685Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Diverse stimuli induce rapid phosphorylation of H3 at Ser-10, which has been correlated with transcription activation of certain immediate early genes, by changing the nucleosome environment or serving as a binding motif for recruiting co-activators or chromatin remodeling complexes.Cisplatin-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 also occurs in cell types other than HeLa. In testicular cancer cell lines, a high level of H3 phosphorylation is observed. Because the Ntera II cell line is at least twice as sensitive to cisplatin as MCF-7 cells (data not shown), there may be a link between H3 phosphorylation and cisplatin cytoxicity.The acetylation of histones correlates well with the transcription activation of many genes (36Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar), presumably by increasing the accessibility of particular genomic regions for transcription activator or remodeling protein complexes. The acetylation of histones is under the control of histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases. We find that cisplatin treatment induces hyperacetylation of histone H4. Although this process could occur by a mechanism independent from that by which histone H3 is phosphorylated, it might be that MAP kinase-dependent recruitment of co-activators with histone acetyltransferase activity to sequence-specific regulatory elements contributes to the acetylation of histones, as has been reported previously (37Miyata Y. Towatari M. Maeda T. Ozawa Y. Saito H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 38Cheung P. Tanner K.G. Cheung W.L. Sassone-Corsi P. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 905-915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Acetylation and phosphorylation of histones are linked with transcriptional activation and facilitate DNA repair (39Kwon J. Morshead K.B. Guyon J.R. Kingston R.E. Oettinger M.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1037-1048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 40Cheung P. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 2000; 103: 263-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar).Phosphorylation of histone H3 Ser-10 is also induced by UV irradiation, arsenite, EGF, and other stimuli through activation of the MAPK pathway (Table I) (18Clayton A.L.

In general, the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) are activated by mitogenic and proliferative stimuli, such as EGF and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. The c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs) and p38 MAPKs respond to environmental stress and chemotherapeutic drugs, such as UV irradiation, arsenite, and cisplatin. The different patterns of MAPK pathway activation caused by these various stimuli may represent a regulatory signal by which cells respond to stress in a stimuli-specific manner.Table IStimuli that activate a MAPK pathway to induce histone phosphorylationStimulusActivation of MAPK pathwayHistone modificationCisplatinp38H3 Ser-10/Ser-28 phosphorylationINK, ERKUnknownUVp38, ERK, JNKH3 Ser-10/Ser-28 phosphorylation (48Zhong S.

Taken together, these results make it unlikely that ERK1/2 was activated by cisplatin under the same experimental conditions (1 μm) in which H3 was phosphorylated.

The ability to diminish the intracellular Na+ concentration by specific transporters is common to many organisms. The uphill transport of Na+ against an electrochemical potential catalyzed by Na+/H+ antiporters is driven by the proton motive force (1Padan E. Venturi M. Gerchman Y. Dover N. Biochim. Biophs. Acta. 2001; 1505: 144-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In addition, some bacteria and archaea possess Na+ pumps that directly couple an exergonic reaction to the endergonic transport of Na+ across the membrane (2Dimroth P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 11-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). For example, the oxidation of NADH with quinone catalyzed by membrane-bound NADH dehydrogenases generates an electrochemical Na+ gradient that can be used to drive the uptake of nutrients. Two distinct classes of bacterial Na+-translocating NADH dehydrogenases are known. Enterobacteria like Escherichia coli possess a Na+-dependent NADH dehydrogenase that is homologous to complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (3Steuber J. Schmid C. Rufibach M. Dimroth P.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 240-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). NqrF is the only subunit that contains four closely spaced cysteine residues 70Cys-Xaa5-Cys-Xaa2-Cys-Xaa31-Cys111 (V. cholerae numbering) required for the ligation of an Fe-S cluster. In addition, motifs for the binding of flavin and NADH were identified on NqrF (14Rich P.R. Meunier B. Ward F.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Subunits NqrB and NqrC each contain one FMN that is covalently linked to a threonine residue (15Zhou W. Bertsova Y.V. Feng B. Tsatsos P. Verkhovskaya M.L. Gennis R.B. Bogachev A.V. Barquera B.

Recently, riboflavin was identified as a component of the Na+-NQR complex from V. cholerae (18Barquera B. Zhou W. Morgan J.E. Gennis R.B. Proc. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10322-10324Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In summary, the known prosthetic groups of the Na+-NQR are one non-covalently bound FAD, two covalently bound FMNs (on NqrB and NqrC, respectively), one riboflavin, one Fe-S cluster (on NqrF), and ubiquinone-8 (6Barquera B.

The central question is how electron transfer from NADH to the substrate quinone proceeds and how this redox reaction is coupled to the translocation of Na+ by the Na+-NQR. Here we demonstrate that the NqrF subunit catalyzes the initial electron transfer reactions NADH → FAD → [2Fe-2S] in the Na+-NQR complex. Construction of Expression Vectors—V. cholerae O395 N1 (20Mekalanos J.J. Swartz D.J. Pearson G.D. Harford N. Groyne F. de Wilde M. Nature. 1983; 306: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) served as a source of genomic DNA for PCR cloning of nqrF constructs. Cloning was carried out in E. coli DH5α using standard techniques (21Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Short Protocols in Molecular Biology: A Compendium of Methods from Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). Gene sequences encoding the shortened NqrF subunit, its Fe-S domain, or flavin domain were amplified from chromosomal DNA by PCR. The forward primers for amplification of sequences encoding a truncated NqrF subunit or its Fe-S domain were designed to excise bp 7-75 of nqrF. Hereby, amino acids Thr3-Ala25 including the predicted single N-terminal transmembrane helix (Val8-Ala25) of the NqrF subunit were removed, and soluble variants of NqrF (NqrF′) and its Fe-S domain were produced (see Fig. 1). Primer sequences and restriction sites are given in Table I. The 3′-ends of the reverse primers for NqrF′ and the flavin domain construct were homologous to sequences downstream of the stop codon of nqrF. PCR amplification by Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) was carried out as described by the supplier with an annealing temperature of 56 °C and an amplification time of 2 min and 40 s. PCR products encoding for NqrF′ or the flavin domain were digested with NdeI and EcoRI and ligated into the arabinose-inducible expression vector pEC422 (22Schulz H. Fabianek R.A. Pellicioli E.C. Hennecke H. Thöny-Meyer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6462-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), yielding pNF3 and pFNF8. The PCR fragment encoding the Fe-S domain was digested by NdeI and XhoI and inserted into pET-16b (Novagene) to give pFS224. The translation product of pFS224 has a C-terminal extension of 21 amino acids, and the stop codon is conferred by the vector. All three constructs add N-terminal His tags to the target proteins consisting of six histidine residues in the case of the NqrF′ and its flavin domain and ten histidine residues in the case of the Fe-S domain. The expression vectors pNF3 or pFNF8 were transformed into V. cholerae as described in Ref. 23Hamashima H. Nakano T. Tamura S. Arai T. Microbiol. Immunol. 1990; 34: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar. E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Stratagene) was transformed with pFS224. The cloned gene fragments were sequenced, and in the case of the fragments encoding the NqrF′ and the flavin domain the fragments were found to be identical to the corresponding genomic sequence of V. cholerae El Tor N16961 (GenBank™ accession number AAF95434) (24Heidelberg J.F.

The cloned gene fragment encoding the Fe-S domain contained a silent G→ A mutation at bp 273 (nqrF numbering). The identity of the Fe-S and the flavin domains with the predicted polypeptides derived from nqrF from V. cholerae El Tor N16961 was further supported by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry. The observed mass was 17895 Da (calculated, 17873 Da) for the Fe-S domain and 33983 Da for the flavin domain (calculated, 34047 Da).

V. cholerae O395 N1 was cultivated in LB medium supplemented with 10 mm glucose and 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, in the presence of 50 μg ml-1 streptomycin and 200 μg ml-1 ampicillin. For the production of NqrF′ or the flavin domain, 10 liters of medium were inoculated with 250 ml of V. cholerae O395 N1 transformed with pNF3 or pFNF8. The cells were grown in a 12-liter fermenter (Bioengineering AG) at 37 °C to an A600 nm of 0.8 or 1.0, respectively. Expression was induced by adding 10 mm L-arabinose. Four hours after induction (A600 nm of ∼2) the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation. For the production of the Fe-S domain 150 liters of LB medium containing 100 μg ml-1 ampicillin were inoculated with 4 liters of E. coli BL21 (DE3)-pFS224 in a bioreactor (Bioengineering AG). The cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 nm of 1.1. After the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, growth was continued at 30 °C overnight. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (d3A 112M-4 centrifuge, Loher) and washed with 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.3 M NaCl. Concentrated cell suspensions were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Purification of Recombinant NqrF′ and Its Flavin and Fe-S Domains—Prior to use all solutions were thoroughly degassed and purged with N2 followed by equilibration in a Coy glove box (95% N2, 5% H2) at least overnight (O2 < 0.3 μm in buffers). Five g wet weight cells of E. coli BL21 (DE3) or V. cholerae O395 N1 were resuspended in 25 ml of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.3 M NaCl, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, and traces of DNase I (Roche Diagnostics). In the case of the flavin domain, 0.1 mm diisopropylfluorophosphate was added instead of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell suspension was passed once through a French pressure cell at 83 millipascal, and the eluate was collected under a stream of N2. Unbroken cells and large debris were removed by centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 20 min. If not indicated otherwise, all subsequent manipulations were performed in the glove box at room temperature. Soluble proteins were separated from the membrane fraction by ultracentrifugation (150,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C). The soluble fraction from V. cholerae was loaded onto a Ni-NTA superflow column (3-ml bed volume, 1.4-cm diameter, Qiagen) equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl). The column was washed with 30 mm imidazole in buffer A, and NqrF′ or the flavin domain was eluted with 400 mm imidazole. NqrF′ from the Ni-NTA column was diluted 10-fold in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5 (buffer B), and loaded on a Fractogel TSK DEAE 650 column (1-ml bed volume, 1.4-cm diameter, Merck). Concentrated NqrF′ was obtained by elution with buffer B containing 0.3 M NaCl. A major contaminant identified in NqrF′ and in the flavin domain was the VC2333 gene product, a putative ribosomal protein S6 modification protein. This protein was removed by further purification of the flavin domain in the presence of oxygen using a MonoQ HR5/5 anionic exchange column connected to an Äkta FPLC station (Amersham Biosciences). The flavin domain was diluted 10-fold in 50 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.0, and loaded onto the MonoQ column. A linear gradient of 15 volumes from 0-0.40 M NaCl led to the elution of the flavin domain at 0.32 m NaCl. The soluble fraction containing the Fe-S domain was loaded onto a Ni-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 M NaCl (buffer C). The column was washed with 80 mm imidazole in buffer C, and the Fe-S domain was eluted with 400 mm imidazole. Fractions containing the Fe-S domain were combined (∼8 ml) and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C overnight. The purification yields from 5 g of cells (wet weight) were ∼10, 4, and 5 mg of Fe-S domain, flavin domain, and NqrF′, respectively. In Vitro Reconstitution of the Fe-S Cluster—Insertion of the Fe-S cluster was performed by means of the cysteine desulfurase NifS from Azotobacter vinelandii (25Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) under exclusion of oxygen. NifS (50 μg/ml) was added to the Fe-S domain (<0.5 mm in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, containing 10 mol of (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2/mol of Fe-S domain and 10 mm dithiothreitol), and the reaction was started by the addition of 2 mm cysteine, pH 7.5, acting as sulfide donor. After 45 min, the reconstituted Fe-S domain was purified from the reaction mixture by affinity chromatography on the Ni-NTA-agarose column. Reduction and Determination of Midpoint Potential—The reduction of NqrF′, the FAD, or the Fe-S domain was followed spectrophotometrically under exclusion of oxygen in cuvettes sealed with a rubber stopper. NADH or sodium dithionite were added in the glove box or with gas-tight syringes. The standard reduction potential of the FAD of the flavin domain was determined by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase method (26Massey V. Curti B. Ronchi S. Zanetti G. Flavins and Flavoproteins: Proceedings of the Tenth International Symposium on Flavins and Flavoproteins.

Benzyl viologen (Em = -359 mV, pH 7.5, n = 2) and methyl viologen (Em = -440 mV, pH 7.5, n = 2) were used as redox mediators (27Hunt J. Massey V. Dunham W.R. Sands R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18685-18691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at final concentrations of 1.8 μm each. The redox state of FAD or phenosafranin was monitored at 404 or 518 nm, respectively. The Nernst coefficient was determined from the slope of the line ln(FADox/FADred) versus ln(PSox/PSred). The difference between the Em of FAD in the flavin domain and the Em of phenosafranin was calculated from the vertical intercept of the line. Analytical Methods—Protein was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method using the reagent from Pierce (28Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18348) Google Scholar) or by the microbiuret method (29Goa J. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Investig. 1953; 5: 219-222Crossref Scopus (794) Google Scholar) preceded by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Bovine serum albumin served as the standard. The concentration of active NqrF′ and the flavin domain was estimated from the content of FAD after extraction. The protein concentration of the flavin domain and the Fe-S domain was standardized by UV spectroscopy using the calculated extinction coefficients at 280 nm based on the content of aromatic amino acid residues of the apoproteins. The concentrations of NADH (ϵ340 = 6.22 mm-1 cm-1), ubiquinone-1 (ϵ275 = 13.7 mm-1 cm-1 in ethanol or ϵ275 = 7.8 mm-1 cm-1 in H2O) (30Fato R. Estornell E. Bernardo S.D. Pallotti F. Castelli G.P. Lenaz G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2705-2716Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and FAD (ϵ450 = 11.3 mm-1 cm-1) (31Macheroux P. Chapman S.K. Reid G.A. Flavoprotein Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, New Jersey1999: 1-8Google Scholar) were calculated based on their absorption coefficients. SDS-PAGE was performed with 12.5% polyacrylamide (32Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). The expression of the nqrF constructs was confirmed by Western blotting using an antibody directed against histidine tags (Tetra-His Antibody, Qiagen). Non-covalently bound flavins were extracted from protein and subjected to high pressure liquid chromatography analysis (33Gemperli A.C. Dimroth P. Steuber J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33811-33817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Iron was determined colorimetrically by the 3-(2-pyridyl)-5,6-bis(5-sulfo-2-furyl)-1,2,4-triazinedissodium salt trihydrate (ferene) complex (34Beinert H. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For the determination of acid-labile sulfur the methylene blue method (35Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) was applied. NADH dehydrogenase activity was assayed in 20 mm Tris/H2SO4,pH 7.5, containing 50 mm Na2SO4,50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 ubiquinone-1 (Sigma). The reaction was started by the addition of NADH. The kinetics were followed at 25 °C in the presence of oxygen using a dual wavelength/double beam recording spectrophotometer (UV-3000, Shimadzu) operating in the dual wavelength mode at 340-370 nm (36Chance B. Science. 1954; 120: 767-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Prior to activity assays NqrF′ and the flavin domain were diluted to an appropriate concentration in 20 mm Tris/H2SO4, pH 7.5, supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. During the activity measurements, diluted NqrF′ was kept on ice under the exclusion of oxygen. Spectroscopy—UV-visible spectroscopy was performed with a Cary 50 spectrophotometer (Varian) or a UV-3000 dual wavelength/double beam recording spectrophotometer. X-band EPR spectra were recorded with an Elexsys E-500 spectrometer equipped with a helium flow cryostat (Oxford Instruments ESR 410), a NMR Gaussmeter, and a Hewlett Packard Frequency counter. Simulation of EPR spectra was carried out by means of the program EPR (37Neese F. Quant. Chem. Progr. Exch. Bull. 1995; 136 (abstr.): 5Google Scholar). Spin concentrations were determined by comparison of simulated spectra to a CuSO4 standard (38Neese F. Zumft W.G. Antholine W.E. Kroneck P.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 8692-8699Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). CD spectroscopy of the Fe-S domain was performed using a MOS-450 spectropolarimeter (Biologics) at a scan rate of 10 nm/s at 25 °C. The cuvette was flushed with N2. Model Building—The sequence of the NqrF subunit from V. cholerae was aligned with the sequences of the benzoate 1,2-dioxygenase reductase (BenC) (39Karlsson A. Beharry Z.M. Matthew Eby D. Coulter E.D. Neidle E.L. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Eklund H. Ramaswamy S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and the cytochrome b reductase fragment of nitrate reductase (40Lu G. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Dwivedi U. Campbell W. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 931-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) using the program 3D-PSSM (41Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). These alignments were combined and verified using structural information of BenC (Protein Data Bank entry 1KRH), of cytochrome b reductase (1CNF), and of adrenodoxin (42Müller A. Müller J.J. Muller Y.A. Uhlmann H. Bernhardt R. Heinemann U. Structure. 1998; 6: 269-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) (1AYF). The resulting multiple sequence alignment was the basis for a three-dimensional model of NqrF generated by the program modeler (43Marti-Renom M.A. Stuart A.C. Fiser A. Sanchez R. Melo F. Sali A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 291-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar). Cofactor Content and Activity of NqrF-derived Polypeptides—The N-terminal half of NqrF with its binding motif for an Fe-S cluster is related to ferredoxins, whereas the C-terminal half comprises motifs for the binding of flavin and NADH (Fig. 1). Three NqrF-derived polypeptides were produced, the NqrF subunit devoid of a putative N-terminal α-helix with a molecular mass of 44,596 Da (NqrF′) and its Fe-S and flavin-carrying domains with molecular masses of 17,873 and 34 047 Da, respectively (Fig. 2). NqrF′ contained 0.94 ± 0.06 mol of FAD/mol (21.1 ± 1.3 nmol of non-covalently bound FAD/mg). In addition, less than 3.2 nmol/mg FMN and 0.3 nmol of riboflavin/mg were present in NqrF′. The FAD domain contained 0.95 ± 0.06 mol of non-covalently bound FAD/mol (29.6 ± 1.9 nmol of FAD/mg). Again, small amounts of FMN (<2.8 nmol/mg) and riboflavin (<0.2 nmol/mg) were also detected. These results demonstrate that the non-covalently bound FAD present in the Na+·NQR complex resides in the NqrF subunit. Both NqrF′ and the flavin domain exhibited high NADH dehydrogenase activities with ubiquinone-1 as an artificial electron acceptor (up to 20,000 μmol min-1 mg-1), depending on the FAD content of the enzyme specimens. The increase of enzymatic activity with increasing concentrations of NADH was very similar for NqrF′ and the flavin domain, with half-maximal activities observed in the presence of 2-4 μm NADH. A characteristic property of Na+-NQR is its inhibition by silver ions (44Steuber J. Krebs W. Dimroth P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Half-maximal inhibition of the flavin domain by Ag+ was observed in the presence of 670 nm Ag+. NqrF′ produced in V. cholerae contained 0.35 ± 0.02 mol of Fe and 0.38 ± 0.12 mol of acid-labile sulfide/mol of NqrF′. Although FAD was efficiently inserted during overproduction of NqrF′, the assembly of the Fe-S cluster was clearly substoichiometric. Assuming that the Fe-S cluster on NqrF′ is of the 2Fe-2S type (see below), our results indicate that 18% of NqrF′ overproduced in V. cholerae contained an Fe-S cluster. Treatment with the cysteine desulfurase NifS did not increase the amounts of iron and acid-labile sulfide in NqrF′ and did not result in higher spin concentrations monitored by EPR. Attempts to reconstitute the Fe-S cluster under slightly denaturing conditions resulted in the loss of the FAD. The situation was different in the isolated Fe-S domain of the NqrF subunit. Here, the amount of Fe-S cluster inserted in vivo (0.40 ± 0.08 mol of Fe and 0.40 ± 0.10 mol of acid-labile sulfide/mol) could be increased by subsequent in vitro assembly with the help of NifS (1.61 ± 0.28 mol of Fe and 1.31 ± 0.11 mol of acid-labile sulfide/mol). The NifS-catalyzed insertion of the Fe-S cluster was accompanied by an increase in absorption with typical maxima at 340, 410, 451, and 560 nm. The content of iron and acid-labile sulfide indicated that the reconstituted Fe-S domain harbors a 2Fe-2S cluster in accordance with its spectroscopic properties (see below). We observed a rapid degradation of the Fe-S cluster in NqrF′ and the Fe-S domain during few minutes after exposure to air. The NqrF′ domain lost its brown-yellow color typical for Fe-S-containing flavoproteins and turned yellow, whereas the Fe-S domain bleached completely. A loss of the Fe-S center during purification in the presence of oxygen was also observed with the Na+-NQR complex from V. alginolyticus (10Steuber J. Rufibach M. Fritz G. Neese F. Dimroth P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1287-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Midpoint Redox Potential of the FAD in the Flavin Domain—The flavin domain exhibited an optical spectrum typical for oxidized flavoproteins with maxima at 396 and 454 nm and a shoulder at 480 nm (Fig. 3). Upon addition of substoichiometric amounts of NADH (10 μm) to the flavin domain (14 μm), the transient formation of a blue neutral flavosemiquinone with a characteristic absorbance in the range from 520 to 660 nm was observed (Fig. 3A). The flavosemiquinone was stable for 20-30 min. From the difference in absorbance at 580 nm and the absorption coefficient of the neutral flavosemiquinone in flavodoxin (ϵ580 = 4.5 mm-1 cm-1) (45Massey V. Palmer G.H. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 3181-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), a flavosemiquinone concentration of 4 μm was calculated indicating that ∼30% of the FAD cofactor in the flavin domain was in the one-electron-reduced state under these conditions. The formation of the one-electron-reduced flavin from the obligate two-electron donor NADH is unexpected and might be the result of a comproportionation reaction between two FAD domains in the fully oxidized and the fully reduced state, respectively (46McLean K.J. Scrutton N.S. Munro A.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Addition of excess NADH (73 μm) to the FAD domain (30 μm) resulted in the complete reduction of the FAD (Fig. 3B). The Na+-NQR complex purified in the presence of oxygen stabilized a neutral flavosemiquinone in the as isolated state, whereas an anionic flavosemiquinone was observed in the Na+-NQR after addition of excess dithionite (7Bogachev A.V. Bertsova Y.V. Ruuge E.K. Wikström M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 47Barquera B. Morgan J.E. Lukoyanov D. Scholes C.P. Gennis R.B. Nilges M.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We did not detect radicals in the flavin domain as isolated or in the flavin domain treated with an excess of NADH by EPR spectroscopy. The midpoint redox potential of the FAD in the flavin domain was determined by comparison with a suitable redox indicator of known midpoint potential. Using the two-electron donor phenosafranin, a theoretical Nernst coefficient of 1.0 is expected if the FAD in the flavin domain undergoes a two-electron reduction. A Nernst coefficient of 1.33 was obtained for the FAD in the flavin domain indicating that the FAD acted as two-electron acceptor during the redox titration. The FAD in the flavin domain"

Through one such high throughput analysis, which entailed the evaluation of 72 SNPs in 62 vascular biology genes in 398 sib-pairs, we identified three members of the thrombospondin gene (THBS) family encoding for thrombospondin protein (TSP)-1, -2, and -4, which are associated with familial, premature MI (6Topol E.J.

The TSP-1 SNP is a rare N700S recessive trait (1% frequency) but has the highest association with disease (odds ratio for MI = 8.66). This rarity leads to a low likelihood of successful replication in small studies (7Yamada Y. Izawa H. Ichihara S. Takatsu F. Ishihara H. Hirayama H. Sone T. Tanaka M. Yokota M. N. Engl. J.

Blood. 2003; 102 (Abstr. 1129): 11Google Scholar) this disease association of the Ser-700 variant was corroborated. TSP-1 is synthesized by a variety of cells and is a component of the extracellular matrix (10Adams J.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 861-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It is stored within secretory granules of platelets (11Hagen I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 392: 242-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 12Lawler J.W. Chao F.C. Fang P.H. Thromb.

Slayter H.S. Coligan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8609-8616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although a variety of functions have been ascribed to TSP-1 and its domains (14Adams J.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 25-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 15Mosher D.F. Annu. Rev. Med. 1990; 41: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), the region harboring the N700S SNP is devoid of such known functional assignments with respect to platelet and other vascular cell responses (14Adams J.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 25-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 16Lawler J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 634-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Moreover, TSP-1 has not been previously regarded as a significant contributor to thrombotic diseases. Although TSP-1 has been identified as a constituent of human atherosclerotic plaques (17Riessen R. Kearney M. Lawler J. Isner J.M. Am. Heart J. 1998; 135: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), mice in which the TSP-1 gene has been inactivated do not exhibit an overt hemostatic phenotype (18Lawler J. Sunday M. Thibert V. Duquette M. George E.L. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 982-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The goal of the current study was to determine how the structure and function of N700S SNP in TSP-1 are altered and, thereby, to identify potential mechanisms by which this substitution predisposes individuals to familial, premature MI. Protein Purification and Radioiodination—Asn-700 and Ser-700 variants of TSP-1 were purified from the platelets of individual donors homozygous for each variant, and samples from at least three different donors of each genotype were used. The TSP-1 from these donors was isolated according to methods described previously (13Lawler J.W. Slayter H.S. Coligan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8609-8616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but using 0.5-1 unit of blood as starting material. Platelets were washed by centrifugation in the presence of prostaglandin E1 and activated with thrombin to induce secretion. TSP-1 in the releasate was bound onto a heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with an NaCl gradient (see Fig. 3). The TSP-1 variants were radioiodinated with 125I using a modified chloramine-T procedure (19Wolff R. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6840-6846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of the TSP-1 preparations was assessed by SDS-PAGE (see under “Results”). In addition, the presence of active transforming growth factor-β1, which is bound and activated by TSP-1 (20Schultz-Cherry S. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 21Schultz-Cherry S. Lawler J. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26783-26788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was assessed as a likely contaminant with biological activity using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Promega). The levels of the growth factor were: Asn-700 rTSP-1, 1 pg/μg protein; Ser-700 rTSP-1, <0.5 pg/μg; Asn-700 TSP-1, <0.5 pg/μg; and Ser-700 TSP-1, 3 pg/μg. Baculovirus encoding Asn-700 TSP-1, kindly provided by Dr. Mosher (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI), was used to produce recombinant (r)TSP-1 in Sf9 insect cells. The rSer-700 variant was made in our laboratory in collaboration with Virus Core of Cleveland Clinic Foundation. The Sf9 cells expressing rTSP-1 were grown in the serum-free medium to minimize contamination with serum growth factors. Protein concentration was measured at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 13 for a 1% solution. Fibrinogen was purified as described previously (22Marguerie G.A. Plow E.F. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5357-5363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TSPI-1 and 6G6, monoclonal antibodies to TSP-1, were produced as described previously (23Aiken M.L. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. Blood. 1987; 69: 58-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Platelet Studies—Platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma (PRP), in the presence or absence of either recombinant or naturally occurring TSP-1 variants, was induced by 20 mm ADP. TSP-1 (10 μg/ml) was added to the PRP and preincubated for 10 min prior to addition of the agonist. Using an aggregometer (Bio/Data Corp., Horsham, PA), aggregation was monitored as the value of the decrease of light transmission, setting the minimum and maximum responses with PRP and platelet-poor plasma, respectively. The approximate diameters of aggregates were estimated with a Leica microscope using a scale bar. Washed platelets were obtained by differential centrifugation followed by gel filtration. Fixed platelets were prepared (24Plow E.F. Marguerie G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3711-3715Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) by stimulating washed platelets with a solution of 10 μm ADP plus 20 μm epinephrine and then fixing them with 1% paraformaldehyde. This protocol fixes integrin αIIbβ3 in an activated state, thereby limiting the effects of TSP-1 added to the aggregation rather than the activation step of the platelet-platelet interaction (25Du X.P. Plow E.F. Frelinger III, A.L. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1991; 65: 409-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 26Marguerie G.A. Edgington T.S. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 154-161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aggregation of these cells was induced by the addition of 20 μg/ml fibrinogen in the presence or absence of the TSP-1 variants. To measure platelet surface expression of endogenous TSP-1, washed platelets without stimulation or after 5 min of thrombin stimulation were reacted with FITC-labeled TSPI-1 mAb or with a labeled mAb to P-selectin as a control. Surface expression was analyzed by flow cytometry using the FacsCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences) with CellQuest software to quantify mean fluorescence intensities. For binding of radioiodinated TSP-1 to platelets, isolated platelets were stimulated with 0.25 unit/ml thrombin and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde. After washing, 20 μg/ml 125I-TSP-1 variants were added, with or without fibrinogen (300 μm) or heparin (1 mm, sodium salt, from porcine intestinal mucosa). After 30 min at room temperature, unbound ligand was separated by centrifugation through 20% sucrose, and platelet-bound radioactivity was measured in a γ-counter. Solid Phase Binding Assays—Fibrinogen (2 μg/well in 50 mm NaHCO3, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.4) was immobilized onto 96-well microtiter plates (Immulon 2HB, ThermoLabsystems, Franklin, MA) overnight at 4 °C. The plates were washed, post-coated with 0.5% polyvinyl alcohol for 1 h at 22 °C, and then Asn-700 or Ser-700 TSP-1 were incubated in a solution of 20 mm Tris·HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2, to which 0.05% Tween 20 was added. After incubation for 2 h at 22 °C, wells were washed and incubated with 6G6 (0.5 μg/ml) mAb to TSP-1 for 1 h at 22 °C. A secondary goat anti-mouse antibody labeled with alkaline phosphatase (Pierce) and p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (Sigma) was used to assess the amount of bound TSP-1. Trypsin Digestion of TSP-1—Digestion was performed at an enzyme: substrate molar ratio of 1:20 at 37 °C. At selected time points, samples were removed, treated with protease inhibitors, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by transfer and Western blotting with mAb 6G6. Intensities of bands were quantified using the ScanImage program. Biophysical Measurements—Circular dichroism measurements were carried out in a JASCO-700 Spectropolarimeter (Tokyo, Japan), using a protein concentration of 0.25 mg/ml in a 1-mm path-length cell. Fluorescent spectra were obtained using a protein concentration of 10 μg/ml and an excitation wavelength of 280 nm in a PerkinElmer LS-50B luminescence spectrometer. In view of the prominence of TSP-1 in platelets, the dominant role of these cells in thrombus formation leading to MI (27Bhatt D.L. Topol E.J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), and recent studies implicating platelets in the development of atherosclerotic lesions (28Massberg S. Brand K. Gruner S. Page S. Muller E. Muller I. Bergmeier W. Richter T. Lorenz M. Konrad I. Nieswandt B. Gawaz M. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 29Huo Y. Schober A. Forlow S.B. Smith D.F. Hyman M.C. Jung S. Littman D.R. Weber C. Ley K. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), we focused on the influence of TSP-1 on platelet aggregation. Low dose (5 μm) ADP was used as both a model and a physiologically relevant agonist to stimulate a submaximal aggregation response (∼35% of maximum) of platelets in plasma. A low concentration (10 μg/ml) of Asn-700 rTSP-1 (>95% pure, based on SDS-PAGE, as shown in Fig. 4b) enhanced the aggregation response to 80% of maximum (Fig. 1a). Addition of the same amount (in moles) of fibrinogen or bovine serum albumin failed to enhance the response. Observed microscopically, TSP-1 increased the size of the platelet aggregates by 3-4-fold. This effect was evident when washed platelets were stimulated (20 μm ADP), treated with paraformaldehyde to fix the fibrinogen receptor, αIIbβ3, in an activated state (25Du X.P. Plow E.F. Frelinger III, A.L. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1991; 65: 409-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), and naturally occurring TSP-1 was added. Aggregation was more extensive when induced by fibrinogen with TSP-1 than when TSP-1 was omitted (Fig. 1b). The use of fixed platelets excludes an effect of TSP-1 or possible contaminants on platelet activation and indicates that TSP-1 exerts an influence on the post-stimulation stage of platelet-platelet cohesion. With conditions established under which TSP-1 exerted a notable influence on platelet aggregation, we analyzed the effect of isolated Asn-700 and Ser-700 TSP-1 from the platelets of individual donors. Under the conditions used, maximum aggregation of stimulated, fixed platelets responding to addition of fibrinogen was 23.4 ± 1.3% with Asn-700 TSP-1 (Fig. 1c) compared with 34.6 ± 3.9% and 32.8 ± 2.8% with Ser-700 TSP-1 from the two different donors (p = 0.018 and 0.03, respectively, compared with the Asn-700 variant). Of note, platelet aggregation in the presence of Ser-700 TSP-1 began immediately on stirring, whereas a 40-60-s lag was observed with the Asn-700 TSP-1 (Fig. 1d). These data indicate that Ser-700 TSP-1 enhances platelet aggregation, consistent with the prothrombotic phenotype of these individuals.Fig. 1TSP-1 variants and platelet aggregation. a, platelet aggregation in PRP in the absence (curve 1) or presence (curve 2) of rTSP-1 (Asn-700) was induced by 20 μm ADP. PRP was preincubated with 10 μg/ml rTSP-1 for 10 min. Aggregation was monitored by the decrease of light transmission, with the minimum and maximum set with platelet-poor and platelet-rich plasma, respectively. b, micrographs show aggregates of ADP-stimulated platelets fixed with 0.5% paraformaldehyde, washed, and then aggregated by addition of fibrinogen (300 nm) in the absence (panel 1) or presence (panel 2) of purified rTSP-1 at 100 μm. c, aggregation of fixed platelets stimulated by 10 μm ADP/20 μm epinephrine plus 20 μg/ml fibrinogen in the absence or presence of 10 μg/ml TSP-1 isolated from one Asn-700 donor (black bar) or from two different Ser-700 donors (striped bars). The maximum extent of aggregation, recorded at 5 min after addition of ADP/epinephrine, is presented as the means ± S.D. of five separate experiments using platelets from five Asn-700 donors. d, representative aggregation curves of platelets prepared as in c in the presence of Ser-700 (curve 2) and Asn-700 (curve 1) TSP-1 (10 μg/ml).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When it is secreted from platelet α granules, a significant portion of the TSP-1 becomes associated with the surface of stimulated platelets (30Aiken M.L. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1987; 13: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 31Legrand C. Thibert V. Dubernard V. Begault B. Lawler J. Blood. 1992; 79: 1995-2003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We assessed basal and thrombin-stimulated TSP-1 surface expression by FACS, using a TSPI-1 mAb that was verified to react equally with Asn-700 and Ser-700 TSP-1 and platelets from three Ser-700 and three Asn-700 donors. Little Asn-700 TSP-1 was detected on the surface of resting platelets, but stimulation of the cells with thrombin, a strong agonist, resulted in a substantial increase in surface-bound TSP-1. Under identical conditions, the signal with Ser-700 TSP-1 platelets was 2.4-fold higher (Fig. 2a), and even basal Ser-700 TSP-1 expression was higher. These differences were observed despite the Ser-700 donor patients' daily dosage of aspirin, administered to blunt platelet reactivity. The observed differences in TSP-1 surface expression were not the results of different amounts of the TSP-1 variants released from or within the platelets as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown). Furthermore, exposure of P-selectin, another α granule release marker (32Stenberg P.E. McEver R.P. Shuman M.A. Jacques Y.V. Bainton D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar), was not elevated in the Ser-700 individuals, with or without platelet stimulation (Fig. 2b). In fact, P-selectin expression was slightly lower with the Ser-700 versus the Asn-700 platelets and was similar to that obtained when an Asn-700 individual ingested aspirin for 3 consecutive days prior to the analysis (Fig. 2b). To directly assess whether the differences in surface expression of the variants arise from differential interaction between the TSP-1s and platelets, we measured the binding of naturally occurring and recombinant TSP-1 variants to platelets isolated from healthy donors by FACS analysis. TSP-1 variants were added to platelets stimulated with 10 μm ADP and fixed with paraformaldehyde to limit the measured reaction to the direct binding of the TSP-1 variants and to avoid potential platelet stimulation by the TSP-1 preparations (19Wolff R. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6840-6846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After a 40-min incubation of the ADP-fixed platelets with the TSP-1 variants, the amount of bound TSP-1 was assessed with anti-TSP-1 labeled with FITC. Under identical conditions, the Ser-700 TSP-1 variant exhibited significantly increased binding to platelets compared with the Asn-700 variant (Fig. 2c). Significant differences (p = 0.05) were observed also in the interaction of the recombinant TSP-1 variants with platelets, although the extent of the difference was less dramatic than with the naturally occurring proteins (Fig. 2d). As an independent approach to examining the interaction of the TSP-1 variants with platelets, we iodinated the purified, naturally occurring variants of TSP-1 and measured their direct binding to platelets. Under the conditions used, minimal interaction was observed unless fibrinogen was present (Fig. 3a). This finding supports previous data showing that fibrinogen bound to integrin αIIbβ3 provides a primary pathway for TSP-1 binding to platelets (33Bonnefoy A. Hantgan R. Legrand C. Frojmovic M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5605-5612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), a reflection of the high affinity of TSP-1 for fibrinogen. In the presence of fibrinogen (300 nm, ∼Kd for αIIbβ3), the amount of Asn-700 TSP-1 bound to platelets increased by 8-fold, whereas the amount of bound Ser-700 TSP-1 increased by 16-fold. The interaction between TSP-1 and fibrinogen-occupied platelets was almost completely inhibited by heparin (Fig. 3a), which binds with high affinity to the N-terminal region of TSP-1 (34Legrand C. Morandi V. Mendelovitz S. Shaked H. Hartman J.R. Panet A. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicate that Asn-700 and Ser-700 TSP-1 interact differently with platelets, which, in turn, may arise from a difference in the binding of the TSP-1 variants to fibrinogen. Fibrinogen was immobilized onto microtiter plates, varying amounts of Asn-700 or Ser-700 TSP-1 were added, and their binding was quantified with a 6G6 mAb against TSP-1. The binding of the two TSP-1 variants to the immobilized fibrinogen differed greatly (Fig. 3b); at the highest concentration tested (50 μg/ml), ∼5-fold more Ser-700 than Asn-700 TSP-1 was bound (Fig. 3b). It has been proposed that TSP-1 forms additional bridges between aggregating platelets and, thereby, increases the extent of platelet aggregation (33Bonnefoy A. Hantgan R. Legrand C. Frojmovic M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5605-5612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, our data showing that Ser-700 TSP-1 has increased binding to fibrinogen provides a potential explanation as to why this variant supports enhanced platelet aggregation and increases thrombus burden. In our experiments we used TSP-1 purified from platelets as well as the recombinant TSP-1 variants. The quality of TSP-1 preparations was assessed by SDS-PAGE immediately after purification, under nonreducing (Fig. 4a) and reducing (Fig. 4b) conditions with subsequent Western blotting (Fig. 4c).

Because it still was possible that TSP-1 preparations contained platelet activators that are effective at the relatively low concentrations, we performed the majority of experiments using platelets fixed with paraformaldehyde. The isolation procedure we used to purify TSP-1 takes advantage of a binding affinity to heparin (35Lawler J. Derick L.H. Connolly J.E. Chen J.H. Chao F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3762-3772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Chen H. Herndon M.E. Lawler J. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 597-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), but Asn-700 and Ser-700 TSP-1 behaved differently when eluted from heparin-Sepharose columns (Fig. 4d). The Ser-700 TSP-1 required substantially higher NaCl concentrations to elute from the heparin columns than Asn-700 TSP-1. For the Ser-700 TSP-1 from three different individuals, the concentration of NaCl that eluted 50% of the bound TSP-1 was 650 mm compared with 470 mm for Asn-700 TSP-1. Nevertheless, the products that were isolated were similar as shown by Western blotting (Fig. 4c). Differences in heparin binding may reflect overall changes in the organization of the variants, which, in turn, might alter protease susceptibility, and we explored this possibility. As evident from Fig. 5a, cleavage fragments of Asn-700 TSP-1, detected by blotting with a 6G6 mAb against TSP-1, were evident only after 60 min of digestion with trypsin. In contrast, substantial degradation of the Ser-700 TSP-1 was observed at 15-30 min. The intensities of the immunoblotting bands below 180 kDa were quantified by densitometry. The amounts of product at 60 and 120 min of trypsin digestion were 10- and 4-fold higher with Ser-700 than Asn-700 TSP-1, respectively (Fig. 5b). The intensities of these bands with the Ser-700 variants isolated from two different donors were similar. Based on the differences in heparin affinity and trypsin sensitivity, we implemented approaches to compare the conformations of the two TSP-1 molecules. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra of the TSP-1 proteins (Fig. 6a) were identical with the broad maximum at 345 nm, indicative of a large number of tryptophan residues (22 are present in TSP-1) in environments differing slightly in exposure to solvent (37Stryer L. Science. 1968; 162: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar); however, as the two purified TSP-1s were unfolded with denaturants guanidine HCl (GdnHCl) or urea, differences in their intrinsic fluorescence at the 345 -nm maximum became evident (Fig. 6, b and c). Asn-700 TSP-1 retained its fluorescence signal at low concentrations of the denaturants (up to 1 m GdnHCl and 3 m urea), whereas the Ser-700 TSP-1 began to lose fluorescent intensity at very low concentrations of the denaturants. These differences suggest that the conformation of Ser-700 TSP-1 is more labile. This interpretation is supported by CD measurements (Fig. 6d). In the absence of GdnHCl, the far UV CD spectra of the two TSP-1 molecules were complex, indicating multiple secondary structural elements (38Adler A.J. Greenfield N.J. Fasman G.D. Methods Enzymol. 1973; 27: 675-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), but were essentially the same (Fig. 6d). At a high concentration (3 m)of the denaturant, the spectra of the two proteins were"
https://openalex.org/W2110272995,"It is generally accepted that the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane of mammalian cells is enriched in acidic phospholipids due to an asymmetric distribution of neutral and anionic phospholipids in the two bilayer leaflets. However, the phospholipid asymmetry across intracellular membranes is not known. Two models have been proposed for the selective targeting of K-Ras4B, which contains a C-terminal farnesyl cysteine methyl ester adjacent to a polybasic peptide segment, to the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane. One involves electrostatic interaction of the lipidated polybasic domain with anionic phospholipids in the plasma membrane, and the other involves binding of K-Ras4B to a specific protein receptor. To address this issue, we prepared by semi-synthesis a green fluorescent protein variant that is linked to a farnesylated, polybasic peptide corresponding to the K-Ras4B C terminus as well as a variant that contains an all-D amino acid version of the K-Ras4B peptide. As expected based on electrostatics, both constructs showed preferential in vitro binding to anionic phospholipid vesicles versus those composed only of zwitterionic phospholipid. Both constructs fully targeted to the plasma membrane when microinjected into live Chinese hamster ovary and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Because the all-D amino acid peptide should be devoid of binding affinity to a putative highly specific K-Ras membrane receptor, these results support an electrostatic basis for the targeting of K-Ras4B to the plasma membrane, and they support an intracellular landscape of phospholipids in which the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane is the most enriched in acidic phospholipids."

Specificity analyses using macromolecular substrates including globular and other fibrillar proteins showed that kumamolisin-As is highly specific for collagen (3Nakayama T. Tsuruoka N. Akai M.

Most noticeably, this enzyme exhibits the maximum activity at acidic pH ∼4.0. This is in striking contrast to all known collagenases, which are either zinc-dependent metallopeptidases (5Harrington D.J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1885-1891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or chymotrypsin-like serine proteinases (6Okamoto M. Yonejima Y. Tsujimoto Y. Suzuki Y. Watanabe K. Appl. Microbiol.

A primary structure analysis of this novel “acid collagenase” revealed that it is a member of the sedolisin family, a recently established class of serine peptidases with a unique catalytic triad, Ser-Glu-Asp, in place of the Ser-His-Asp triad of classical serine peptidases (2Wlodawer A.

Collagen is an insoluble structural protein that accounts for ∼30% of the total weight of animal proteins (5Harrington D.J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1885-1891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is the predominant constituent of skin, tendons, and cartilage as well as the organic component of bones, teeth, and the cornea. Collagen is also found in the connective tissues of nearly all organs as insoluble fibers embedded in the extracellular matrix, where it serves to provide both their structure and strength (5Harrington D.J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1885-1891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymatic degradation of collagen has attracted medical attention because it is closely related to the etiology of many human diseases (5Harrington D.J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1885-1891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the abundance of collagen in nature, microbial degradation of collagen should also be of biogeochemical significance in global cycling of nitrogen (11Madigan M.T. Martinko J.M. Parker J. Biology of Microorganisms. Prentice-Hall, Saddle River, NJ2000Google Scholar). Due to its rigidified fibrillar structure, collagen is not generally degraded by ordinary peptidases but can only efficiently be degraded by the collagen-specific enzymes named collagenases (5Harrington D.J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1885-1891Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kumamolisin-As was the first example of a collagenase from the sedolisin family, and analyses of its subsite specificity, its mode of collagen binding, and the role of its unique catalytic triad could be very interesting issues to be clarified in comparison with the classical types of collagenases. We report here the results of such a study, conducted using crystallographic and biochemical approaches. In addition, we created and characterized the E78H mutant of the enzyme, in which the glutamate residue of its catalytic triad was replaced by a histidine in order to mimic the catalytic triad of the classical serine peptidases. Collagen (type I, from bovine Achilles tendon) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; IQF, internally quenched fluorogenic substrate; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; NMA, N-methylanthranilic acid; DNP, 2,4-dinitrophenol; AcIPF, N-acetylisoleucyl-prolyl-phenylalaninal. grade acetonitrile were purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). All chemicals for peptide synthesis were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Science. An internally quenched fluorogenic substrate (IQF), NMA-MGPH*FFPK(DNP)dRdR ([2-(N-methylamino)benzoyl]-l-methionyl-glycyl-l-prolyl-l-histidyl-l-phenylalanyl-l-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-Nϵ-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-l-lysyl-d-arginyl-d-arginine amide) was a product of the Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). An inhibitor, N-acetyl-isoleucyl-prolyl-phenylalaninal (AcIPF) was synthesized as described previously (9Oyama H. Hamada T. Ogasawara S. Uchida K. Murao S. Beyer B.B. Dunn B.M. Oda K. J. Biochem.

Restriction enzymes and other DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from TaKaRa Shuzo (Kyoto, Japan) or from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan). The plasmid pScpA, which is a derivative of pET15b (Novagen, Madison, WI), was constructed as described previously (4Tsuruoka N. Nakayama T. Ashida M. Hemmi H. Nakao M. Minakata H. Oyama H. Oda K. Nishino T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and was used for the expression of the full-length kumamolisin-As gene. All other chemicals used were of analytical or sequencing grade, as appropriate. Two methods of assessing collagenase activity were employed in this study. Method I—This assay system contained 100 μm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, 2 mg of collagen, and enzyme in a final volume of 0.5 ml. After preincubation at 60 °C, the reaction was started by the addition of the enzyme. Incubation was carried out at 60 °C with shaking (at 1000 rpm) for 10-60 min (depending on the amount of enzyme to be assayed) using a micromixer model E-36 (TAITEC Co., Saitama, Japan) that maintained the homogeneous distribution of the collagen powder in the reaction mixture during incubation. The blank reference mixture did not contain the enzyme. The reaction was stopped by adding 1.0 μl of 0.2 m HCl and chilling the mixture on ice for 15 min followed by centrifugation. Supernatant (100 μl) was mixed with 400 μl of Ninhydrin Color Reagent Solution (Nacalai Tesque) and was heated at 97 °C for 10 min, followed by chilling the mixture on ice. 2-Propanol (1.0 ml) was then added to the mixture, and the increase in absorbance of the supernatant at 570 nm (ΔA570) was determined. The ΔA570 of the reaction mixture, in which collagen (2 mg) was completely degraded by the addition of an excess amount of the collagenase under these assay conditions, was also determined and used for unit calculations. Method II—For assaying the enzymatic hydrolysis of the IQF substrate, NMA-MGPH*FFPK(DNP)dRdR (where an asterisk indicates the scissile site), the standard assay mixture contained varying amounts of the substrate, 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0), and the enzyme in a final volume of 300 μl. The stock enzyme solution used for Method II contained 0.1% (w/v) Tween 80. The assay mixture without the enzyme was brought to 40 °C, and the reaction was started by the addition of the enzyme. After incubation for 10 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 300 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, followed by chilling the mixture on ice. Fluorescence intensity changes of the reaction mixture (excitation, 340 nm; emission, 440 nm) were determined with a Shimadzu fluorescence spectrophotometer RF-5000. The fluorescence intensity change where the substrate was completely degraded by the addition of an excess amount of the collagenase under these assay conditions was also determined and was used for unit calculations. Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using a kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Kinetic parameters and their S.E. values were determined by nonlinear regression analysis (14Leatherbarrow R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 15: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (172) Google Scholar) using the initial velocity data obtained by means of assay method II. To analyze the P1 and P1′ specificities of kumamolisin-As, peptide libraries were designed on the basis of the amino acid sequence of a nonapeptide, Met-Gly-Pro-Arg*Gly-Phe-Pro-Gly-Ser, where an asterisk indicates the scissile site. A peptide of such a sequence was previously identified as a good substrate for kumamolisin-As (4Tsuruoka N. Nakayama T. Ashida M. Hemmi H. Nakao M. Minakata H. Oyama H. Oda K. Nishino T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The P1′ library was an equimolar mixture of peptide components, Met-Gly-Pro-Arg*Xaa-Phe-Pro-Gly-Ser, with Xaa being all of the different amino acids other than Cys. The individual relative retention times of the peptide components and their cleavage products were predicted from their amino acid sequences by Rekker's method as described by Sasagawa and Teller (15Sasagawa T. Teller D.C. Hancock W.S. Handbook of HPLC for the Separation of Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1987: 53-65Google Scholar). Five different sets of peptides (termed P1′a, P1′b, P1′c, P1′d, and P1′e; see below), each consisting of three or four peptides, were synthesized for the P1′ library using an ABI 433A automated peptide synthesizer; the combination of amino acids (Xaa) at P1′ of peptides for each set was determined on the basis of the predicted retention times so that all of the substrate peptide and the cleavage products could be separated from one another by a single HPLC assay (see below). Thus, amino acid residues at the P1′ position of each set were as follows: Trp, His, Gly, and Arg for P1′a; Phe, Leu, Pro, and Ala for P1′b; Tyr, Thr, and Glu for P1′c; Ile, Val, Gln, and Asp for P1′d; and Met, Ser, Lys, and Asn for P1′e. For the evaluation of the P1 specificity of the enzyme, the P1 library, Met-Gly-Pro-Xaa*Phe-Phe-Pro-Gly-Ser, was also constructed in a manner similar to the one described above. Three different sets of peptides were synthesized for the P1 library and were termed P1a (Xaa; His, Asn, Tyr, and Trp), P1b (Xaa; Arg, Glu, Ala, Asp, Val, Leu, and Phe), and P1c (Xaa; Lys, Thr, Gln, Gly, Ser, Met, Pro, and Ile). Primary structures of the peptide libraries were verified by automated Edman degradation. The individual substrates and cleavage products separated on HPLC were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry using a Bruker REFLEX III spectrometer. The reaction mixture consisted of 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.0, a set of synthetic peptides (typically 250 μm for each component), and 0.185 nm of enzyme in a final volume of 200 μl. The mixture without the enzyme was preincubated at 60 °C, and the reaction was started by the addition of the enzyme. At intervals, a 200-μl aliquot of solution was withdrawn and mixed with 50 μl of 1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0; the resulting mixture was chilled on ice. The peptides were analyzed by a reversed-phase HPLC using an automated Gilson 305 system equipped with a Shimadzu SPD-10A VP UV-visible detector: column, YMC-Pack ODS-A A-303 (4.6 × 250 mm; YMC Co., Kyoto, Japan); flow rate, 0.7 ml/min; solvent A, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 60% (v/v) acetonitrile. After injection (50 μl) onto a column that was equilibrated with 35% solvent B, the column was initially developed isocratically for 5 min, followed by linear gradients from 35% solvent B to 48% solvent B in 20 min and from 48% solvent B to 100% solvent B in 1 min. The column was then washed isocratically with 100% solvent B for 5 min, followed by a linear gradient from 100% B to 35% B in 1 min. This gradient profile ensured base-line separation of the oligopeptide components. The chromatograms were obtained with detection at 215 nm, and the amounts of peptides were determined from peak integrals by using a Shimadzu Chromatopak CR8A data processor. Three independent digestions were carried out to check the reproducibility of the assays. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis showed that cleavage of the peptides took place only at the predicted site, indicated above by an asterisk. The initial velocity (v) (i.e. change of the individual substrate concentration at zero time) was calculated from the initial linear part of the decrease in the corresponding substrate peak areas after separation of the components by reversed-phase HPLC. Quantitative evaluation of the specificity profiles of the enzyme was based on the equation that describes the enzymatic reaction when competing substrates are present (16Antal J. Pal G. Asboth B. Buzas Z. Patthy A. Graf L. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 288: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics. Portland Press, London1995: 105-111Google Scholar), (vi/[Si])/(vj/[Sj])=(kcat,i/Km,i)/(kcat,j/Km,j)(Eq. 1) where i and j denote the individual substrates, and kcat and Km are the catalytic constant and the Michaelis constant, respectively. Individual concentrations of the substrates, [Si], were determined by amino acid analyses. We constructed an active site mutant of kumamolisin-As in which Glu78 was replaced by His. The plasmid, pScpA/E78H, was prepared by in vitro mutagenesis of the plasmid pScpA (4Tsuruoka N. Nakayama T. Ashida M. Hemmi H. Nakao M. Minakata H. Oyama H. Oda K. Nishino T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) using a QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. The mutation was verified by DNA sequencing on both strands using a Dye-Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) with a CEQ 2000 DNA analysis system (Beckman Coulter). Each of the plasmids, pScpA and pScpA/E78H, was used to transform Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), and the transformant cells were grown at 37 °C in an LB medium (1 liter) containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin until the optical turbidity of the culture reached 0.6 at 600 nm. Expression of the wild-type and mutated kumamolisin-As genes was attained by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.8 mm, followed by further fermentation for 3 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (5,000 × g, at 4 °C for 10 min), suspended in an appropriate volume of a 0.05 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, and disrupted at 4 °C by ultrasonication at 10 kHz. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation (18,000 × g, at 4 °C for 10 min), and the resultant supernatant (pH 4.0) was incubated at 55 °C for 5 h, followed by centrifugation. Almost all of the endogenous E. coli proteins were removed by centrifugation, and the resultant supernatant contained the expressed product of >96% homogeneity. The supernatant was concentrated by ultrafiltration with a YM-10 membrane using an Amicon 8200 unit and dialyzed at 4 °C against 0.02 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 (buffer A). The concentrate was then loaded on an ΔKTA system equipped with a Mono Q HR10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A. After loading the enzyme solution onto the column, followed by an extensive washing of the column with buffer A, the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.15-0.5 m NaCl in buffer A in 75 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. In order to avoid any possible contamination of the mutant preparations with the wild-type activity, chromatographic purification of the E78H mutant was completed first, followed by that of the wild-type enzyme. Collagen (3 mg) was reacted with 0.065 pm kumamolisin-As at 60 °C for 30 min in 0.5 ml of a 0.05 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0. The mixture was then analyzed for proteolytic cleavage of collagen by SDS-PAGE (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Protein bands in the gel were transferred to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by electroblotting, and the membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. Stained portions corresponding to the 70- and 30-kDa fragments of the membrane were excised using dissecting scissors and subjected to automated Edman degradation to determine the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the fragments. Crystals of kumamolisin-As complexed with AcIPF, an inhibitor specifically designed for kumamolisin (10Comellas-Bigler M. Fuentes-Prior P. Maskos K. Huber R. Oyama H. Uchida K. Dunn B.M. Oda K. Bode W. Structure. 2002; 10: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), as well as of uninhibited native kumamolisin-As and its E78H mutant were obtained by the vapor diffusion method. The complex was prepared by mixing 100 μl of 2.3 mg/ml kumamolisin-As in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.0 with 2.5 μl of 10 mg/ml AcIPF in Me2SO. The samples of native kumamolisin, both complexed and uninhibited, were mixed with the well solution containing 27% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.18 m ammonium sulfate, 10 mm dithiothreitol in 25 mm sodium acetate buffer at pH 4.0 or 4.2 at a 1:1 ratio, with the total volume of 4 μl. Crystals of the E78H mutant were grown in a mother liquor containing 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, 30% polyethylene glycol 8000 in deionized water. X-ray diffraction data for the wild-type and E78H mutant apoenzymes were collected on a MAR345 detector mounted on a Rigaku RU200 rotating anode x-ray generator, operated at 50 kV and 100 mA. Data for the inhibitor complex were collected on beamline X9B, NSLS, Brookhaven National Laboratory, using an ADSC Quantum4 CCD detector. The reflections were integrated and merged using the HKL2000 suite (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar), with the results summarized in Table I. All structures were refined using the program SHELXL (20Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar). After each round of refinement, the models were compared with the respective electron density maps and modified using the interactive graphics display program O (21Jones T.A. Kjeldgaard M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The default SHELXL restraints were used for the geometrical (22Engh R. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2548) Google Scholar) and displacement parameters; temperature factors were refined isotropically, due to the limited resolution of data. Water oxygen atoms were refined with unit occupancies, although some of the sites are probably only partially occupied. The refinement results are also presented in Table I.

Open table in a new tab Specificity Analysis of Kumamolisin-As—We have previously shown that digestion of collagen with kumamolisin-As at a substrate/enzyme ratio of 103:1 (mol/mol) yielded more than 50 peptides (4Tsuruoka N. Nakayama T. Ashida M. Hemmi H. Nakao M. Minakata H. Oyama H. Oda K. Nishino T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Analysis of the primary structure of some of these peptides suggested that the enzyme may preferably act on the -Pro-Xaa*Gly-Yaa-Zaa- sequence of the α1 and α2 chains of collagen. When collagen was incubated with a lower amount of the enzyme (i.e. substrate to enzyme ratio, 2 × 105:1 mol/mol), incubation resulted in specific cleavage of collagen at a single site to produce two degradation products, one with a molecular mass of 70 kDa and another with a molecular mass of 30 kDa, as analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After electroblotting the protein bands of the fragments to the membranes, N-terminal amino acid sequences were analyzed by automated Edman degradation. The N-terminal sequence, NH2-Gly-Leu-Hyp-Gly-Glu-Arg-Gly-Arg-Hyp-, could only be unambiguously determined for the 70-kDa fragment. A comparison of this sequence with the published amino acid sequence of the α1 chain of bovine type I collagen (23Glanville R.W. Breitkreutz D. Meitinger M. Fietzek P.P. Biochem. J. 1983; 215: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 24Miller E.J. Piez K.A. Reddi A.H. Extracellular Matrix Biochemistry. Elsevier Science Publishing, New York1984: 41-81Google Scholar) revealed that it corresponded to the sequence starting from position 127 of the α1 peptide. Since the N terminus of the α1 chain of bovine type I collagen is blocked (24Miller E.J. Piez K.A. Reddi A.H. Extracellular Matrix Biochemistry. Elsevier Science Publishing, New York1984: 41-81Google Scholar), these results showed that the specific cleavage site of collagen under these conditions was -Arg126-*Gly127- of the α1 collagen chain. The specificity at the P1′ site was then analyzed using the peptide libraries, Met-Gly-Pro-Arg*Xaa-Phe-Pro-Gly-Ser, in which the individual components differ only at the P1′ site. Each set of peptides (see “Experimental Procedures”) was digested with kumamolisin-As, and the reaction was monitored by separation of the substrates and cleavage products by reversed-phase HPLC. The calculated specificity profile at the P1′ site is presented in Fig. 1A, indicating some preference for aromatic or bulky aliphatic amino acids. Unexpectedly, Gly was one of the least preferred amino acids at this position, although that residue is present at the P1′ position of the preferred cleavage site in collagen. We then analyzed the P1 specificity profile using the peptide library, Met-Gly-Pro-Xaa*Phe-Phe-Pro-Gly-Ser, where Phe was located at the P1′ site. We found that the P1 site had very high specificity for Arg (Fig. 1B), in excellent agreement with the results obtained by the limited proteolysis of collagen. On the basis of the preliminary results of the specificity studies, we designed an IQF substrate, NMA-MGPH*FFPK-(DNP)DRDR, which could be utilized for a highly sensitive fluorometric assay of kumamolisin-As. This substrate was developed based on the addition of the fluorescent tag, N-methylanthranilic acid (NMA), and the quenching tag, 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), to a peptide where His and Phe were located at the respective P1 and P1′ positions. The design was based on our preliminary analysis of the specificity of kumamolisin-As that appeared to indicate that both histidine and arginine were equally good P1 substituents. Although later reinterpretation of the data summarized in Fig. 1B has shown this not to be the case, P1 His appears to be sufficient to provide a basis for the design of an acceptable substrate. Two d-arginine residues were added to the C term"

Both of these effects are prevented by the PKA inhibitor, myristoylated PKI. The aims of the present study were to identify the PKA phosphorylation site(s) important for PKA activation of hClC-2 at neutral and low pHo and to examine the relationship between PKA and low pHo activation. Recombinant hClC-2 with point mutations of consensus phosphorylation sites was prepared and stably expressed in HEK-293 cells. The responses to forskolin plus isobutylmethylxanthine at neutral and acidic pHo were studied by whole cell patch clamp in the presence and absence of phosphatase inhibitors. The double phosphorylation site (RRAT655(A) plus RGET691(A)) mutant hClC-2 lost PKA activation and low pHo activation. Either RRAT or RGET was sufficient for PKA activation of hClC-2 at pHo 7.4, as long as phosphatase inhibitors (cyclosporin A or endothal) were present. At pHo 6 only RGET was needed for PKA activation of hClC-2. Low pHo activation of hClC-2 Cl– channel activity was PKA-dependent, retained in RGET(A) mutant hClC-2, but lost in RRAT(A) mutant hClC-2. RRAT655(D) mutant hClC-2 was constitutively active and was further activated by PKA at pHo 7.4 and 6.0, consistent with the above findings. These results show that activation of hClC-2 is differentially regulated by PKA at two sites, RRAT655 and RGET691. Either RRAT655 or RGET691 was sufficient for activation at pHo 7.4.

Physiol. 2000; 279: C40-C50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ClC-2 plays a role in Cl– transport by a variety of tissues (6Thieman A. Grunder S. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), and low pHo and PKA regulation of ClC-2 may be of physiological relevance. The goal of these studies was to determine the structural basis for low pHo and PKA activation of human ClC-2 Cl– channels. Human ClC-2 contains seven potential phosphorylation sites in the C terminus, and two in the N terminus (Table I). All but two consensus sites (RRAT655 and RGET691 in human ClC-2 and RRQS651 and KRKS749 in rabbit ClC-2) are conserved in rat (6Thieman A. Grunder S. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Human and rabbit, but not rat, ClC-2 are activated by PKA (1Sherry A.M. Stroffekova K. Knapp L.M. Kupert E.Y. Cuppoletti J.

These sites are absent in rat ClC-2 (6Thieman A. Grunder S. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), a channel that does not show PKA activation, although it has been shown to be phosphorylated without changes in function (7Park K. Begenisich T. Melvin J.E. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 182: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation sites RRAT655 and RGET691 of human ClC-2 were the focus of the present studies.Table IConsensus phosphorylation sites in ClC-2HumanRabbitRatLocationRRAT655RRQS651C terminus (A)RGET691C terminus (A)KRGPS704KRCPS702KRGCS710C terminus (A)KRKS749C terminus (B)RIS755RIS755RIS764C terminus (B)RTS802RTS802RTS811C terminus (B)RDS860RDS860RDS869C terminus (B)REGS889REGS889REGT897C terminus (B)RYT27RYT30RYT33N terminus (B)RVCS76RMCS79RICS82N terminus (B) Open table in a new tab ClC-2 (human and rabbit) has been shown to be activated by PKA in planar lipid bilayer studies and in hClC-2-expressing HEK-293 cells treated with forskolin plus IBMX (2Tewari K.P.

Physiol. 2001; 281: C46-C54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, an unsuccessful attempt to activate 36Cl transport in human IB3 cells containing hClC-2 has been reported (8Schwiebert E.M. Cid-Soto L.P. Stafford D. Carter M. Blaisdell C.J. Zeitlin P.L. Guggino W.B. Cutting G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3879-3884Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), despite finding low pHo activation. Further studies of the relationship between low pHo and PKA activation of hClC-2 were warranted because low pHo activation was found to be dependent upon PKA activation (2Tewari K.P. Malinowska D.H. Sherry A.M. Cuppoletti J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C40-C50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present studies used site-directed mutagenesis and functional assays in the presence and absence of phosphatase inhibitors and a PKA inhibitor, mPKI, to determine the structural basis for PKA activation and PKA-dependent low pHo activation of hClC-2. The site(s) of PKA activation of the hClC-2 Cl– channel is not known. Moreover, it is not known whether PKA activation of the channel at pHo 7.4 and at reduced pHo occur at the same site(s). Site-directed mutagenesis of hClC-2 was used to determine which of the sites (RRAT and RGET), or whether both, was important under these two different conditions. Wild-type and mutant hClC-2 Cl– channels were stably expressed in HEK-293 cells, and Cl– channel function was assessed by measuring whole cell Cl– currents in response to activation of PKA by forskolin and IBMX at pHo 7.4 and 6.0. Arachidonic acid, which activates hClC-2 in a PKA-independent manner (2Tewari K.P. Malinowska D.H. Sherry A.M. Cuppoletti J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C40-C50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used to determine whether the mutant channels were expressed and present in the plasma membrane. The effects of protein phosphatase inhibitors were used to determine whether PKA activation was sufficient to overcome the action of endogenous protein phosphatase. These studies delineate the structural basis for low pHo and PKA activation of hClC-2 and suggest a possible role for PKA regulation of hClC-2 in physiological settings. Transfected HEK-293 Cells—HEK-293 cells stably transfected with wild-type or mutant human ClC-2 cDNA in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 using LipofectAMINE were prepared as described previously (2Tewari K.P. Malinowska D.H. Sherry A.M. Cuppoletti J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C40-C50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of single phosphorylation sites was carried out using a TransformerII site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech). Four mutants, as follows, were prepared and confirmed by sequencing: RRAT655(acc)→ A(gcc); RGET691 (acc)→ A(gcc); a double mutant containing both of these changes; and RRAT655(acc)→ D(gac). The entire cDNA was also verified by sequencing. Sequential PCR was used to introduce the point mutation RGET691(acc)→ D(gac) into a 1363-bp cDNA fragment of wild-type human ClC-2, which was then cloned into PCR2.1Topo. After confirming the sequence, a SanDI/HindIII fragment, which included the mutation, was cloned into the full-length human ClC-2 cDNA and sequenced over the ligation sites. Measurement of Whole Cell Cl–Currents—Whole cell currents were measured as described previously (5Cuppoletti J. Tewari K.P. Sherry A.M. Kupert E.Y. Malinowska D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C46-C54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Forskolin and arachidonic acid in Me2SO were diluted into the bath solution resulting in a final concentration of Me2SO of 0.1% or less. Controls containing equivalent amounts of Me2SO alone were always performed. Statistical significance of the difference between two means was determined using the Student's t test using N = number of cells. Materials—HEK-293 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). HEPES, Me2SO, Tris, EGTA, and inorganic and organic salts were obtained from Sigma. Forskolin, arachidonic acid, cyclosporin A, nodularin, endothal, and mPKI were from Calbiochem. IBMX was from Aldrich. LipofectAMINE, pcDNA3.1, and PCR2.1Topo were from Invitrogen. Wild-type and Mutant hClC-2 Cl–Channel Activity at pHo 7.4 —Fig. 1A shows typical Cl– current recordings from HEK-293 cells expressing wild-type hClC-2 Cl– channels at pHo 7.4 with no addition (control) and following addition of 5 μm forskolin plus 20 μm IBMX (forskolin/IBMX). The cells were subsequently treated with 1 μm arachidonic acid. Both treatments increased Cl– currents. Similar treatments of nontransfected HEK-293 cells had no effects (Table IV). Cl– currents in HEK-293 cells expressing the double site (RGET(A) plus RRAT(A)) or the single site (RRAT(A)) mutant hClC-2 Cl– channel were not activated by forskolin/IBMX but were activated by arachidonic acid. This suggests that RRAT is involved in the PKA activation of hClC-2 at pHo 7.4. HEK-293 cells expressing the single site RGET(A) mutant hClC-2 were activated by forskolin/IBMX, and the level of activation was greater than in HEK-293 cells expressing wild-type hClC-2, indicating that the remaining site, RRAT, is involved in PKA activation of the channel at pHo 7.4. The single site RRAT(D) mutant hClC-2 showed high basal Cl– channel activity that was further increased with forskolin/IBMX. The RGET(D) site was also constitutively active, thus confirming the importance of these sites to PKA activation of hClC-2 at pHo 7.4. I/V curves normalized to capacitance under each condition are shown in Fig. 1B. The summarized data expressed as slope conductance (nS/pF) are shown in Fig. 1C and Table II. The extent of arachidonic acid activation was similar in wild-type and mutant channels, demonstrating that the mutant hClC-2 channels were expressed to levels similar to that of the wild-type channel in HEK-293 cells.Table IVNon-transfected HEK-293 cellspHo 7.4Control pHo 7.40.024 ± 0.002 (3)F/I0.035 ± 0.010 (3)F/I + AA0.044 ± 0.009 (3)Control pHo 7.40.031 ± 0.007 (3)Cyclo0.033 ± 0.007 (3)Cyclo + F/I0.033 ± 0.008 (3)Cyclo + F/I + AA0.028 ± 0.005 (3)pHo 6Control pHo 7.40.030 ± 0.003 (3)pHo 60.033 ± 0.003 (3)pHo 6 + F/I0.031 ± 0.004 (3)pHo 6 + F/I + AA0.040 ± 0.012 (3)Control pHo 7.40.041 ± 0.009 (3)pHo 60.045 ± 0.008 (3)pHo 6 + cyclo0.047 ± 0.007 (3)pHo 6 + cyclo + F/I0.046 ± 0.006 (3)pHo 6 + cyclo + F/I + AA0.038 ± 0.008 (3) Open table in a new tab Table IIhClC-2 slope conductance at pHo 7.4 (nS/pF)Table IIhClC-2 slope conductance at pHo 7.4 (nS/pF) Wild-type and Mutant hClC-2 Cl–Channel Activity at pHo 6.0 —Fig. 2A shows typical Cl– current recordings of wild-type and mutant hClC-2 channels stably expressed in HEK-293 cells, first recorded at pHo 7.4 and then recorded at pHo 6.0, followed by forskolin/IBMX and then arachidonic acid. The I/V curves normalized to capacitance are shown in Fig. 2B, and the summarized data expressed as slope conductance (nS/pF) are shown in Fig. 2C and Table III. Nontransfected HEK-293 cells had very low currents, and these treatments had no effect on the current (Table IV). Wild-type and RGET(A) mutant hClC-2 channels were activated by reduction of pHo, whereas low pHo activation was lost in the RRAT(A) plus RGET(A), RRAT(A), RRAT(D), and RGET(D) mutant hClC-2 (Fig. 2 and Table III). This result demonstrated that RRAT was involved in low pHo activation, presumably as a result of basal level phosphorylation. The remaining RGET site did not support low pHo activation, suggesting separate roles for RRAT and RGET in low pHo activation and in PKA-dependent activation at reduced pHo levels. At pHo 6, the wild-type channel and the RRAT(A), RRAT(D), and RGET(D) mutant channels were activated by forskolin/IBMX, but the RRAT(A) plus RGET(A) and the RGET(A) mutant channels did not respond to forskolin/IBMX. These findings, coupled with the loss of low pHo activation of the RRAT(D) mutant, are consistent with RGET involvement in forskolin/IBMX activation at pHo 6 and with a separate role for RRAT in low pHo activation. The RGET(D) mutant showed PKA activation at pHo 6.0. This showed that RRAT supports PKA-dependent activation at pHo 6.0, although RRAT alone did not (Table III).Table IIIhClC-2 slope conductance at pHo 6.0 (nS/pF)Table IIIhClC-2 slope conductance at pHo 6.0 (nS/pF) Role of Basal State Phosphorylation in Low pHo Activation—Fig. 3 and Table V show that low pHo activation of wild-type hClC-2 and RGET(A) mutant hClC-2 was abolished by mPKI. Thus, acid activation in the basal state is dependent upon PKA phosphorylation of RRAT.Table VEffect of mPKI on pHo 6, forskolin/IBMX, and arachidonic acid activation of wild-type hClC-2 slope conductance (nS/pF)+mPKI-mPKI+mPKI vs. -mPKIControl, pHo 7.40.061 ± 0.008 (13)0.069 ± 0.008 (13)NS+F/I0.060 ± 0.014 (5)0.170 ± 0.011 (9)p < 0.001NS vs. controlp < 0.001 vs control+ F/I + AA0.592 ± 0.073 (10)0.437 ± 0.032 (5)NSp < 0.001 vs. F/Ip < 0.001 vs. F/IpHo 60.067 ± 0.014 (4)0.153 ± 0.021 (3)p < 0.05NS vs. pHo 7.4p < 0.04 vs. pHo 7.4pHo 6 + F/I0.063 ± 0.012 (4)0.276 ± 0.015 (3)p < 0.001NS vs. pHo 6p < 0.01 vs. pHo 6pHo 6 + F/I + AA0.359 ± 0.024 (4)0.598 ± 0.018 (3)p < 0.001p < 0.001 vs. pHo 6 + F/Ip < 0.001 vs. pHo 6 + F/I Open table in a new tab Effect of Protein Phosphatase Inhibitors—To assess whether protein phosphatase inhibition could affect basal levels or forskolin/IBMX-activated levels of wild-type hClC-2 Cl– channel activity, the effects of cyclosporin A (a PP2B inhibitor) (9Baba Y. Hirukawa N. Tanohira N. Sodeoka M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 9740-9749Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and endothal (a PP2A ≫ PP1 inhibitor) (10Brockdorff J. Nielsen M. Svejgaard A. Dobson P. Ropke C. Geisler C. Odum N. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) were examined at pHo 7.4 and 6.0. As shown in Table II, at pHo 7.4 cyclosporin A (20 μm) added to the bath significantly increased (approximately doubled) the basal Cl– channel slope conductance of wild-type and both single-site mutant hClC-2 channels, but it was without effect on the double phosphorylation site mutant hClC-2. Endothal (500 nm) had no effect on basal activity of either wild-type or mutant channels. However both cyclosporin A and endothal increased forskolin/IBMX activation of the wild-type channel and rescued the forskolin/IBMX activation of the RRAT(A) mutant hClC-2 at pHo 7.4 (Fig. 4, Table II). These results show that both RRAT and RGET phosphorylation play a role in activation of hClC-2 at pHo 7.4. Suppression of phosphatase activity at pHo 7.4 was required to show activation of the RRAT(A) mutant channel, which retains the phosphatase-sensitive RGET site. When 1 μm nodularin, a cell-impermeant phosphatase inhibitor with a specificity of PP1 ≥ PP2A >>> PP2B, was added to the bath, there was no effect; however, when it was added to the pipette solution the wild-type channel showed increased activation by forskolin/IBMX, but the basal level was unaffected at pHo 7.4 (Table II). In contrast, at pHo 6 the only significant phosphatase inhibitor effects were those of cyclosporin A and nodularin (in the pipette), which increased forskolin/IBMX activation of the wild-type hClC-2 channel. No other effects of cyclosporin A, endothal, or nodularin on basal or activated channel activity in either wild-type or mutant hClC-2 were observed (Table III). The cumulative data presented show that both RRAT655 and RGET691 are important to the activation of hClC-2 by PKA phosphorylation at pHo 7.4. RGET alone, but not RRAT alone, supported PKA-dependent activation at pHo 6.0. However, RRAT did support PKA-dependent activation in the RGET(D) mutant. In addition, these studies show that acid activation of hClC-2 Cl– channel requires phosphorylation of RRAT. The functional significance of these phosphorylation sites has been investigated using alanine and aspartate substitution of consensus phosphorylation sites (11Zhang B. Tavare J.M. Ellis L. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 990-996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Purves F.C. Spector D. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5757-5764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Klose K.E. Weiss D.S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 6810-6814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by site-directed mutagenesis. This is a widely used technique, and loss of activation by protein kinases in such mutants is generally interpreted as a specific modification that does not affect global conformation of the protein. Arachidonic acid, which acts through a separate mechanism to activate hClC-2 Cl– currents, was used to confirm structural integrity of the mutant channels and their presence on the surface of the HEK-293 cells. In addition, the substitution of only one of the two phosphorylation sites generally did not affect the ability to activate at the remaining site, supporting the argument for structural integrity of the mutant channels. Because there are numerous consensus phosphorylation sites on hClC-2, the site-directed mutagenesis approach would be very tedious, especially because quantitative assessment of the function of the Cl– channels required patch clamp technology. However, based on the initial observation that the human channel contains two phosphorylation sites that are not present in rat ClC-2, which has been repeatedly demonstrated to be insensitive to PKA activation (7Park K. Begenisich T. Melvin J.E. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 182: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 15Jentsch T.J. Stein V. Weinreich F. Zdebik A.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82 (Correction): 503-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google ScholarPhysiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 1aCrossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), it was reasonable to begin this study by focusing on the sites that are unique to hClC-2. The loss of the effect of PKA in the double knock-out RRAT(A) plus RGET(A) mutant hClC-2 supported this rationale and greatly limited the number of sites that required detailed study. However, the other potential phosphorylation sites may play a role in regulation of hClC-2 under different conditions. The RRAT(A) mutant was not responsive to PKA activation at pHo 7.4 in the absence of protein phosphatase inhibitors. Wild-type hClC-2 has been previously shown to be responsive to protein phosphatase inhibition (16Fritz J. Edelman A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C778-C786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein phosphatase inhibitors increased PKA activation of the wild-type and the RRAT(A) mutant channel at pHo 7.4, demonstrating the importance of control of protein phosphatase activity in PKA activation studies. Thus, the report of lack of PKA activation of 36Cl transport in the human cystic fibrosis (IB-3) cell line containing hClC-2 (8Schwiebert E.M. Cid-Soto L.P. Stafford D. Carter M. Blaisdell C.J. Zeitlin P.L. Guggino W.B. Cutting G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3879-3884Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) could be explained in part by the lack of inclusion of phosphatase inhibitors in that study. The same cell line was shown to exhibit low pHo activation in electrophysiological studies. Based on our finding that low pHo activation is dependent upon PKA, it is likely that endogenous PKA activation of hClC-2 occurred in the basal state in those studies (8Schwiebert E.M. Cid-Soto L.P. Stafford D. Carter M. Blaisdell C.J. Zeitlin P.L. Guggino W.B. Cutting G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3879-3884Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) showing low pHo activation. The RRAT site alone is not responsive to PKA activation at pHo 6.0 in this model system. PKA itself was active, based on its ability to activate the wild-type and the RRAT(A) mutant hClC-2. Protein phosphatase inhibition was effective because activation of the RRAT(A) mutant containing the RGET site was rescued by protein phosphatase inhibition at pHo 7.4 and because cyclosporin A increased forskolin/IBMX-activated wild-type hClC-2 activity at pHo 6. Therefore, these results suggest that reduced extracellular pH changed the availability of the RRAT site to protein phosphatases or PKA, perhaps through direct effects on the channel. The RGET(D) mutation also changes the availability of RRAT at reduced pH, suggesting that under some conditions, phosphorylation of RGET may have similar effects. In support of this suggestion, the RRAT(D) and RGET(D) phosphomimetic mutant hClC-2 channels were constitutively active under basal conditions at both pHo 7.4 and 6.0. Some of these could be further activated by PKA through phosphorylation at the RRAT site at pHo 7.4 and the RGET and RRAT sites at pHo 6.0. The constitutive activity of the RRAT(D) mutant and the inability of PKA to activate the RGET(A) mutant containing RRAT at reduced pHo demonstrated that this was not due to low intrinsic activity of the phosphorylated RRAT channel at pHo 6.0. Rather, these results suggested that the RRAT site alone was not a good substrate for PKA at reduced pHo but that it was a good substrate in the RGET(D) mutant. Although it is tempting to speculate that there is transmembrane coupling between extracellular pH and the C-terminal phosphorylation site(s), further studies will be required to determine how these pHo-dependent effects arise. In the presence of cyclosporin A, wild-type, RGET(A), and RRAT(A) channels at pHo 7.4 show similar levels of activation by forskolin/IBMX. The difference noted with and without cyclosporin A shows that the wild-type channel has a different phosphatase sensitivity than either of the mutants. The present study was not designed to consider the physiological significance of any particular protein phosphatase in the regulation of hClC-2 in the HEK-293 model system. Other approaches may be better suited to such studies. For example, a direct interaction between PP1 and rabbit ClC-2 has been demonstrated in a yeast two-hybrid system (18Furukawa T. Ogura T. Zheng Y.J. Tsuchiya H. Nakaya H. Katayama Y. Inagaki N. J. Physiol. 2002; 540: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Endothal has a partial selectivity for PP1, and PP1 inhibition by inclusion of nodularin in the pipette solution increased PKA activation of wild-type hClC-2 at both pHo 7.4 and 6. Additional studies of the action of phosphatases on native hClC-2 channels in cells may be warranted to help evaluate the physiological role of these channels. This study has identified the residues responsible for PKA activation and PKA-dependent low pHo activation of the human ClC-2 channel (RRAT655 and RGET691) and provides some new direction for future evaluation of PKA activation of ClC-2-mediated currents in human tissues. Whereas PKA activation, per se was only 4-fold at pHo 7.4 and 2-fold at pHo 6.0, there was an 8.6-fold increase at pHo 7.4 comparing basal Cl– currents with currents in the presence of cyclosporin A and forskolin/IBMX and a 13-fold increase comparing basal currents at pHo 7.4 with currents at pHo 6.0 in the presence of cyclosporin A plus forskolin/IBMX (Tables II and III). Several reports of the kinase regulation of ClC-2 in other systems have now appeared (1Sherry A.M. Stroffekova K. Knapp L.M. Kupert E.Y. Cuppoletti J. Malinowska D.H. Am. J.

In this report, we have investigated the involvement of the second intracellular loop of the neuronal glycine transporter 2 (GLYT2) on the protein conformational equilibrium and the regulation by 4α-phorbol 12 myristate 13-acetate (PMA). By substituting several charged (Lys-415, Lys-418, and Lys-422) and polar (Thr-419 and Ser-420) residues for different amino acids and monitoring plasma membrane expression and kinetic behavior, we found that residue Lys-422 is crucial for glycine transport. The introduction of a negative charge in 422, and to a lower extent in neighboring N-terminal residues, dramatically increases transporter voltage dependence as assessed by response to high potassium depolarizing conditions. In addition, [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate accessibility revealed a conformational connection between Lys-422 and the glycine binding/permeation site. Finally, we show that the mutation of positions Thr-419, Ser-420, and mainly Lys-422 to acidic residues abolishes the PMA-induced inhibition of transport activity and the plasma membrane transporter internalization. Our results establish a new structural basis for the action of PMA on GLYT2 and suggest a complex nature of the PMA action on this glycine transporter.

By substituting several charged (Lys-415, Lys-418, and Lys-422) and polar (Thr-419 and Ser-420) residues for different amino acids and monitoring plasma membrane expression and kinetic behavior, we found that residue Lys-422 is crucial for glycine transport. The introduction of a negative charge in 422, and to a lower extent in neighboring N-terminal residues, dramatically increases transporter voltage dependence as assessed by response to high potassium depolarizing conditions. In addition, [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate accessibility revealed a conformational connection between Lys-422 and the glycine binding/permeation site. Finally, we show that the mutation of positions Thr-419, Ser-420, and mainly Lys-422 to acidic residues abolishes the PMA-induced inhibition of transport activity and the plasma membrane transporter internalization. Our results establish a new structural basis for the action of PMA on GLYT2 and suggest a complex nature of the PMA action on this glycine transporter. The inhibitory action of glycine neurotransmitter in spinal cord and brain stem of vertebrates is terminated by re-uptake through sodium-driven plasma membrane glycine transporters (1Nelson N. J.

The proposed structure for GLYT2, shared by the Na+- and Cl–-dependent neurotransmitter transporters, contains 12 transmembrane segments (TM) connected by alternating extracellular (EL) and intracellular (IL) hydrophilic loops and terminal ends lying in the cytoplasm (12Liu Q.R.

The Na+- and Cl–-dependent neurotransmitter transporters are believed to be tightly regulated, making the protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated regulation the most studied mechanism (34Blakely R.D. Bauman A.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 35Zahniser N.R. Doolen S. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 92: 21-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Activation of PKC by phorbol esters such as 4α-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), leads to acute reduction in transport activity of the monoamine transporters, the γ-aminobutyric acid transporter GAT-1 and GLYT1 (35Zahniser N.R. Doolen S. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 92: 21-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). This down-regulation of the transport activity seems to be due to a PMA-induced internalization of the plasma membrane residing transporters (36Daniels G.M. Amara S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35794-35801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 37Grånäs C. Ferrer J. Loland C.J. Javitch J.A. Gether U. J. Biol.

Ferrer J. Loland C.J. Javitch J.A. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4990-5000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Consequently, no individual consensus phosphorylation site for PKC has been proven to be responsible for the PMA-induced internalization (37Grånäs C. Ferrer J. Loland C.J. Javitch J.A. Gether U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4990-5000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 38Sato K. Adams R. Betz H. Schloss P. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1967-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated the function of the second intracellular loop (IL2) of GLYT2 that contains several charged (Lys-415, Lys-418, and Lys-422) and polar (Thr-419 and Ser-420) residues, the latter in consensus sequences for PKC phosphorylation, which are strictly conserved among the subfamily of Na+- and Cl–-coupled amino acid neurotransmitter transporters. We show that positions Thr-419, Ser-420, and mainly Lys-422 are conformationally connected with the substrate-binding site, and its substitution by acidic residues abolishes the GLYT2 response to PMA, making the transporter resistant to the inhibition and internalization induced by this phorbol ester. Our data provide structural basis for the action of PMA on this glycine transporter. Materials—[2-3H]Glycine (1.6 TBq/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Ligase and restriction enzymes were from Roche Applied Science. Peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG and ECL reagent were from Amersham Biosciences. NHS-SS-biotin was obtained from Pierce. MTSET and MTSEA-biotin were obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. (Toronto, Canada). Anti-GLYT2 antibody against the N-terminal region of the recombinant protein was characterized previously (6Zafra F. Aragón C. Olivares L. Danbolt N.C. Giménez C. Storm-Mathisen J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3952-3969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All other reagents were obtained in the purest form available. Site-directed Mutagenesis—GLYT2 substitution mutants were created by site-directed mutagenesis using the method of Higuchi as described previously (10Martínez-Maza R. Poyatos I. López-Corcuera B. Núñez E. Giménez C. Zafra F. Aragón C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2168-2173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The mutated region was subcloned downstream from the cytomegalovirus promoter of the pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen), containing the wild type GLYT2a cDNA (12Liu Q.R. López-Corcuera B. Mandiyan S. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22802-22808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by using flanking restriction sites. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For the relevant mutants at least two independent Escherichia coli colonies carrying the mutant plasmids were characterized by sequencing and transport activity. Cell Growth and Protein Expression—COS 7 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient expression in COS 7 cells was carried out using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) following the procedure indicated by the supplier. Cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C and then used for modification and/or transport assays. Glycine Transport Assay—Transport assays were performed at 37 °C on COS 7 cells 48 h after transfection in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS: 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES-Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm Ca2Cl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 10 mm glucose) as described previously (10Martínez-Maza R. Poyatos I. López-Corcuera B. Núñez E. Giménez C. Zafra F. Aragón C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2168-2173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for the indicated times in 0.25 ml of an uptake solution containing 2 μCi/ml 3H-labeled glycine isotopically diluted to yield 10 μm final glycine concentration in HBS or the medium indicated in the figure legends. Kinetics for glycine were performed by varying glycine concentrations from 1 to 1000 μm. For the experiments where Na+ or Cl– had to be isotonically replaced, choline chloride or sodium gluconate was used to obtain the desired Na+ or Cl– concentrations. In all the experiments the glycine transport was measured by subtracting the glycine accumulation by mock-transfected cells from that of the transporter cDNA transfected cells. The background transport of glycine was usually 0.3 nmol of glycine/mg of protein/6 min, which represented around the 20% of the glycine transport by wild type GLYT2. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford. Treatment with PKC Activators or Inhibitors—Transfected or mock-transfected COS cells expressing the indicated transporters were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with PMA (20 nm to 1 μm) or 1 μm PMA plus 1 μm staurosporine or vehicle (Me2SO). Cells were then washed, and glycine transport activity was assayed as described. Sulfhydryl Modification by MTSET—The day before the experiment, transfected or mock-transfected COS 7 cells were plated at 30% confluence (72,000 cells per well) on polylysine-covered 24-well plates. The next day, cells were washed at room temperature with 1 ml of HBS solution or HBS in which LiAc isotonically replaced NaCl. In protection experiments, protecting agents were added to this solution. After washing, each well was preincubated at room temperature with 300 μl of the former medium containing the indicated concentrations of the MTSET reagent. Following 10 min of incubation, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with 1 ml of the same solution, at least twice with 1 ml of HBS, and then immediately assayed for [3H]glycine transport as described above. MTSET was dissolved in water as a 100× stock solution that was always freshly prepared immediately prior to use. Labeling with MTSEA-biotin and Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin—COS 7 cells were grown in 12-well plates and transfected as described above. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed twice with 1.0 ml per well of HBS containing NaCl (or LiAc when indicated). In protection experiments, protecting agents were added to this solution. This was followed by 10 min of incubation with the indicated concentration of MTSEA-biotin (2 mm stock solution, dissolved in water immediately before use) or 40 min of incubation with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (1.5 mg/ml, Pierce) in total surface expression determinations. After washing three times with 1 ml of the same solution (supplemented with 100 mm lysine in total surface expression determinations), cells were scraped in 0.6 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.004 mm pepstatin, and the protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford. Cells were lysed (equal amounts of total proteins from each well) using SDS-lysis solution (50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.004 mm pepstatin, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, and 0.25% sodium deoxycholate) for 30 min on ice. In total surface labeling with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin, biotinylated proteins were recovered by overnight incubation with 40 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads/sample (Sigma) at 4 °C in an end-over-end shaker. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted with 70 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1 m dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.01% bromphenol blue) for 10 min at 80 °C. Aliquots of each sample were run on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose for Western blotting (6Zafra F. Aragón C. Olivares L. Danbolt N.C. Giménez C. Storm-Mathisen J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3952-3969Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bands were visualized with the ECL detection method and quantified on a GS-710 Calibrated Imaging Densitometer from Bio-Rad with Quantity One software by using film exposures that were in the linear range. Standard errors in biotinylation studies were calculated after densitometry from at least three separate experiments. MTSEA-biotinylated samples were compared with NHS-SS-biotinylated samples (39Geerlings A. Núñez E. López-Corcuera B. Aragón C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17584-17590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Control or transfected COS 7 cells growing in 24-well plates at 48 h after transfection were subjected to immunofluorescence using a primary antibody against the N terminus of GLYT2 and a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody coupled to Alexa 488 fluorophore as described (10Martínez-Maza R.

Cells were visualized on a Confocal Microradiance (Bio-Rad) coupled to a vertical Axioskop2 microscope (Zeiss). Data Analysis—Non-linear or linear regression fits of experimental data were performed with ORIGIN (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). The effect of MTSET on uptake is expressed as the fraction of uptake remaining (F = 100 × uptake after/uptake before). To calculate second order apparent rate constants for MTSET inhibition (k), F was plotted as a function of MTSET concentration in M, and the data were fitted to a first order exponential decay equation (F = Fmin + Fmax × e exp(–kct)). The resulting first order apparent rate constant divided by the incubation time in seconds was taken as a measurement of the second order rate constant (23López-Corcuera B. Núñez E. Martínez-Maza R. Geerlings A. Aragón C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43463-43470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed on transport data from at least three experiments. To test whether the intracellular loop conserved sequence of GLYT2 plays a role in transporter function, we introduced several point mutations at each of the three lysines of IL2, and the mutated transporters were assayed for glycine transport after expression in COS cells. As shown in Table I, no major alterations in the kinetic parameters for glycine, chloride, and sodium were observed for the mutants, although the substitution of Lys-418 and Lys-422 for arginine or neutral residues increased the Vmax for glycine without affecting the apparent affinity for the cosubstrates. However, mutant K422E showed an intriguing alteration of all the measured parameters with reduced Vmax and Km values for glycine and decreased apparent affinities for chloride and sodium. Because the observed differences in Vmax between GLYT2 wild type and the mutated transporters could be the result of different surface expression levels, we performed cell surface biotinylation followed by Western blot (Fig. 1). Mutants K418R, K418A, K422R, and K422Q were indeed delivered more efficiently to the plasma membrane than the wild type, which accounts for the observed increases in Vmax. However, although K422E showed lower surface levels (∼50% of wild type), its Vmax value was much lower (about 25%, see Table I), indicating that glycine transport is somehow less efficient in this mutant.Table IKinetic parameters of GLYT2 and IL2 point mutantsVmaxKm (Gly)Km (Cl-)Km (Na+)nmol Gly / mg protein / 4 minμmmmmmGLYT234.3 ± 6.2154 ± 1547.2 ± 10.072.0 ± 4.2K415R34.4 ± 3.0193 ± 2836.1 ± 9.376.4 ± 2.3K415A29.2 ± 1.8132 ± 1529.9 ± 7.478.1 ± 7.7K415C31.3 ± 2.0151 ± 1843.6 ± 9.274.3 ± 5.1K415E20.2 ± 1.4151 ± 1732.9 ± 9.787.2 ± 8.6K418R64.0 ± 4.4186 ± 1639.2 ± 4.962.8 ± 4.7K418A58.6 ± 3.4164 ± 1336.5 ± 8.251.9 ± 4.8K418C24.9 ± 2.2150 ± 3052.5 ± 10.566.3 ± 2.4K418E18.3 ± 2.0105 ± 1563.4 ± 6.554.7 ± 1.9K422R50.0 ± 2.8179 ± 1744.8 ± 11.072.5 ± 6.4K422Q42.3 ± 1.8161 ± 1839.4 ± 10.468.8 ± 3.6K422C32.3 ± 2.0183 ± 2989.5 ± 25.872.1 ± 3.6K422E8.7 ± 0.480 ± 16158.6 ± 27.7110.2 ± 4.7 Open table in a new tab The kinetic behavior of K422E with inefficient glycine transport and lower apparent affinities for Na+ and Cl– could be compatible with an alteration in the mutant affecting the permeation pathway. We hypothesized that if Lys-422 were lying in the inner part of the permeation pathway, perhaps its substitution for an acidic residue could make IL2 accessible from the outside. Therefore, we decided to study the accessibility of exogenous cysteine residues inserted in this region, and for this purpose we initially took the cysteine mutants of the three lysines Lys-415, Lys-418, and Lys-422, expressed them in COS cells, and assayed MTSET sensitivity (Fig. 2A). We observed that if the incubation with the reagent was performed in HBS containing lithium acetate instead of NaCl, the mutant K422C was inhibited around 30% by 5 mm MTSET (p < 0.01 in Student's t test). Most surprising, if the MTSET treatment was applied to all the IL2 mutants, not only was mutant K422C inhibited in lithium acetate but also the mutants to glutamate of the three lysines (K415E, K418E, and K422E), being maximal at the inhibition of K422E (about 40% at 5 mm MTSET, p < 0.01 in Student's t test). Curiously, this inhibition by MTSET could not be reversed by DTT or any other reducing agent (Fig. 2B), indicating that it was not due to MTSET reaction with SH groups of the transporters. Consequently, there was no cysteine labeling with MTSEA-biotin (Fig. 2C), suggesting that IL2 is not accessible from the outside. Because the observed inhibition by MTSET was only produced in media containing acetate or propionate (not shown), we tested the effect of these compounds in the transport of glycine by K422E. Most interesting, if the glycine transport assay was performed in the presence of increasing acetate concentrations and a fixed concentration of chloride, mutant K422E, but not GLYT2 wild type, became progressively activated (Fig. 3, A and B), and this activation disappeared in the presence of 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS), a blocker of the Cl– fluxes through the plasma membrane (Fig. 3A) or in the presence of ouabain, an inhibitor of the Na+/K+-ATPase (Fig. 3B). Because acetate and propionate are the conjugated bases of weak acids, which can cross the plasma membrane in their protonated form and cause a decrease in intracellular pH, triggering compensatory mechanisms in the cell (40Szatkowski M.S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1989; 409: 103-120Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), these results suggest that K422E is more sensitive than the wild type to the effects of weak acids on the membrane potential. In fact, the direct depolarization of the plasma membrane with high potassium selectively inhibits K422E, thus confirming the higher voltage dependence of this mutant (Fig. 3C). We then performed glycine transport assays in the conditions shown in Fig. 3C for all the IL2 mutants (Table II), and we observed that for the mutants to glutamate, the negative slopes of the resulting plots (activity versus increasing K+ concentration) were progressively enhanced from position 415 to 422, and within position 422, the slopes increased as long as the substituting residue became more acidic. These results suggest that the involvement in voltage dependence increases from position 415 to 422 and the voltage dependence is higher in mutants where a negative charge is introduced.Table IISlopes of linearized plots transport activity versus increasing K+ concentration for GLYT2 and the IL2 mutantsSlope ± errorFold over wild typeGLYT2-0.55 ± 0.181K415E-1.24 ± 0.182.25K418E-1.57 ± 0.222.85K422E-1.78 ± 0.293.24K422C-1.29 ± 0.322.35K422Q-0.87 ± 0.231.58K422R-0.69 ± 0.151.25 Open table in a new tab One possible explanation of the K422E phenotype, according to its kinetic behavior and its higher voltage dependence, would be the locking of the transporter in a conformational state that displays the cosubstrate-binding sites to the inside (“inward conformation”) (28MacAulay N.

If this hypothesis were correct also for GLYT2, residues that show alternating access and are extracellularly accessible in the outward-facing conformation would become occluded in the K422E background. Thus, we chose two residues that fulfilled those requisites: Ile-292 in TMIII (18Bismuth Y. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol.

The two point mutants were inhibited in NaCl by MTSET and labeled by MTSEA-biotin in a DTT-reversible (not shown) and glycine-protected manner (Fig. 4), reflecting their extracellular accessibility. As shown previously, this contrasts with the MTSEA-biotin-unlabeled and MTSET-resistant K422E (in NaCl). However, if the point mutations were introduced in K422E, thus generating two double mutants (I292C/K422E and A223C/K422E), the inhibition by MTSET was reduced from 57 (I292C) to 29% (I292C/K422E) at 0.5 mm MTSET (p < 0.01 in Student's t test) and from 61 (A223C) to 30% (A223C/K422E) at 5 mm MTSET (p < 0.01 in Student's t test, Fig. 4A). The apparent inhibition constants for MTSET inactivation were calculated from dose-response experiments (data not shown), and they were lower in the double mutants, although the reduction was more apparent in A223C versus A223C/K422E (k = 3.1 ± 0.4 and 1.5 ± 0.1 m–1 s–1, respectively) than in I292C versus I292C/K422E (k = 2.4 ± 0.3 and 1.6 ± 0.2 m–1 s–1, respectively). Accordingly, the MTSEA-biotin labeling was diminished by 95% in A223C/K422E and by 20% in I292C/K422E compared with their corresponding"

Here, the amino acid sequence TRNKIMT, corresponding to the residues 14-20 of the N terminus of the mouse (m) CLR, was found to be required for a functional mCLR/RAMP2 AM receptor. The deletion of amino acids 14-20 (Δ14-20) or their substitution by alanine (14-20A) did not affect the heterodimerization of the mCLR with mRAMP1 or mRAMP2, and the levels of expression at the surface of transiently transfected COS-7 cells were not altered. In mRAMP1/mCLR- or mRAMP1/mCLR-(Δ14-20)-expressing cells CGRP stimulated cAMP formation with EC50 values of 0.12 ± 0.01 and 1.5 ± 0.4 nm, respectively. In mRAMP2/mCLR-expressing cells the EC50 of AM was 0.8 ± 0.2 nm. However, in cells expressing mRAMP2/mCLR-(Δ14-20) up to 10-6 m AM failed to stimulate cAMP production. In mRAMP2/mCLR-(14-20A) expressing cells the cAMP response to AM was minimally restored, and the EC50 was >100 nm. In conclusion, the deletion of the amino acid sequence TRNKIMT of the extreme N terminus of the mCLR maintained CGRP receptor function of mRAMP1/receptor heterodimers, but AM no longer activated the mutant mCLR-(Δ14-20) in the presence of mRAMP2. The TRNKIMT sequence is required for normal mCLR/mRAMP2 association, and as a consequence, high affinity AM binding signaling the activation of adenylyl cyclase. The receptors for the neuropeptide calcitonin (CT) gene-related peptide (CGRP) and the multifunctional peptide hormone adrenomedullin (AM) are calcitonin-like receptor (CLR)/receptor-activity-modifying protein (RAMP) 1 and CLR/RAMP2 heterodimers, respectively.

The neuropeptides α- and β-calcitonin (CT) 1The abbreviations used are: CT, calcitonin; CGRP, CT gene-related peptide; AM, adrenomedullin; CLR, CT-like receptor; RAMP, receptor-activity-modifying protein; PTH, parathyroid hormone; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate; h, human; m, mouse; r, rat. gene-related peptide (CGRP) (1-37) and the multifunctional peptide hormone adrenomedullin (AM) of 52 amino acids in man and 50 amino acids in the rat are potent vasodilators (1Wimalawansa S.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 533-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). CGRP and AM are only 20% identical but have in common ring structures of six amino acids linked by disulfide bonds between cysteine residues and amidated C termini, both required for biological activity. Molecularly defined receptors for CGRP and AM are CT-like receptor (CLR)/receptor-activity-modifying protein (RAMP) 1 and CLR/RAMP2 heterodimers, predominantly linked to cAMP production (2McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1868) Google Scholar). The CLR belongs to the family B of G protein-coupled receptors with seven transmembrane domains that includes the 60% homologous CT receptor and receptors for secretin and parathyroid hormone (PTH). The CLR, unlike the other known members of this receptor family, requires as associated proteins the RAMP for the functional expression. RAMP1 and RAMP2 and a third, RAMP3, consist of between 147 and 189 amino acids. They are single transmembrane domain proteins with 30% amino acid sequence similarity. Their N-terminal extracellular domains of between 90 and 110 amino acids define in part CGRP and AM selectivity of the CLR (3Fraser N.J. Wise A. Brown J. McLatchie L.M. Main M.J. Foord S.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Substitution of the 18 N-terminal amino acids of the human CLR by the corresponding domain of the porcine CT receptor revealed a fully functional CGRP receptor in the presence of human RAMP1, but the RAMP2-dependent AM receptor function was impaired (4Koller D. Born W. Leuthäuser K. Flühmann B. McKinney R.A. Fischer J.A. Muff R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This implies that subdomains of both the CLR and the RAMP determine distinct binding interaction sites for CGRP and AM in the corresponding heterodimers. In other receptors of the B family of G protein-coupled receptors critical determinants for high affinity ligand binding are localized near the N terminus. Photochemical cross-linking of PTH analogs and site directed mutagenesis identified Thr33 and Glu37 in the N-terminal extracellular domain of the rat PTH receptor as determinants for PTH binding (5Mannstadt M. Luck M.D. Gardella T.J. Jueppner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 273: 16890-16896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Similarly, 125I-CT analogs with photoreactive p-benzoyl-l-phenylamine in positions 16 and 26 labeled Thr30 close to the N terminus and Phe137 adjacent to the first transmembrane domain of the human CT receptor (6Dong M. Pinon D.I. Cox R.F. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1167-1175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Similarly, in the secretin receptor amino acids 1-10 were indispensable for high affinity ligand binding (7Holtmann M.H. Ganguli S. Hadac E.M. Dolu V. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14944-14949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Here, amino acids 14-20 of the mouse CLR with the sequence TRNKIMT were identified as a critical determinant for the functional interaction of the mCLR/mRAMP2 with AM. Importantly, the deletion of the TRNKIMT sequence in the mCLR maintained the CGRP receptor function in the presence of mRAMP1. Substitution of amino acids 14-20 by alanine revealed a low affinity mCLR/mRAMP2 AM receptor. Materials—Cell culture products were supplied by Invitrogen. Rat αCGRP (CGRP) and rat AM (AM) were obtained from Bachem AG (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Chemicals and other reagents were purchased from Sigma and VWR International GmbH (Darmstadt, Germany). Construction of mCLR Mutants—A DNA fragment encoding amino acids 1-292 of the mCLR was subcloned into the pBluescript SK-vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The amino acid deletions and substitutions in the extreme N-terminal region of the mCLR illustrated in Fig. 1 were introduced into the corresponding DNA sequence with the protocols of the QuikChange® Multisite-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). The primers carrying the mutations were designed according to the recommendations given by Stratagene. PCR was carried out in a final volume of 50 μl, containing 100 ng of plasmid template, 50 pmol of 5′ and 3′ primers, and 2.5 units of the PfuUltra™ High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Stratagene). The annealing temperature was set to 55 °C for the first 5 cycles and to 62 °C for the additional 25 cycles. The plasmid template was digested with DpnI, and the PCR products were transformed into calcium competent Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue cells. The DNA fragments encoding the N-terminal mCLR subregion with the introduced mutations were sequenced in both directions with ABI PRISM™ DNA Analizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). DNA fragments carrying the desired mutations were excised from pBluescript SK- and cloned into a pcDNA 3.1 construct that provided an in frame DNA fragment encoding the non-modified C-terminal region of the mCLR. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells were cultured in Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4.5 g/liter glucose) medium (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine (cell culture medium). For transfection the cells were seeded in 24- or 6-well plates or in 100-mm culture dishes at a density of 15,000 cells/cm2. 48 h later the cells were transfected with the indicated receptor and RAMP expression constructs and linear polyethylenimine (25 kDa) (Polysciences, Warrington, PA). Briefly, 0.2 μg/cm2 plasmid DNA was diluted with 6.25 μl/cm2 cell culture medium. 0.5 μg/cm2 polyethylenimine in 6.25 μl/cm2 cell culture medium was prepared separately. The solutions were then combined and vortexed immediately. After incubation for 15 min at room temperature, the volume was adjusted to 125 μl/cm2 with cell culture medium and the solution added to the cells. The cells were incubated at 37 °C overnight. The volume was then increased to 250 μl/cm2 with cell culture medium and the cells incubated for 2 days. Stimulation of cAMP Production—2 days after transfection the COS-7 cells were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with the indicated concentrations of rCGRP and rAM in cell culture medium without fetal calf serum but supplemented with 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Subsequently, cAMP was extracted from the cells and measured by radioimmunoassay as described previously (8Bühlmann N. Leuthäuser K. Muff R. Fischer J.A. Born W. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2883-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent Staining of Intact and Mutant V5-mCLR and of myc-mRAMP1 and myc-mRAMP2 at the Surface of COS-7 Cells—The cells were grown and transfected on coverslides in 24-well plates. V5 and myc immunofluorescence staining was carried out 2 days after transfection. The cells were fixed with 4% formalin in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and preincubated with Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature in the same medium with mouse monoclonal antibodies to V5 (Invitrogen) and/or rabbit polyclonal antibodies to myc (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) (diluted 1:400). Subsequently the cells were stained for 30 min in the dark with Alexa488 goat anti-rabbit serum (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and/or Cy3-conjugated sheep anti-mouse serum (Sigma) (diluted 1:200). After mounting of the coverslips with Immu-Mount (Thermo Shandon, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA) the fluorescence was detected by a Kappa DX20 CCD camera connected to an Eclipse E600 Nikon microscope with a 0.45× projection lens through a Plan Fluor 20×/0.5 DLL objective using B-2A and G-2A filter blocks. Protein Cross-linking, Immunoprecipitation, and Deglycosylation—Cell surface protein cross-linking was carried out with 10 mm bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3; Pierce). The cells were lysed with 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 7 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml aprotinin, 3 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and 0.2 mg/ml cholesterolhemisuccinate (cell lysis buffer). V5-tagged receptors were immunoprecipitated from the cleared lysates at 4 °C by sequential incubation with 50 μl of ImmunoPure® Immobilized Protein G (Pierce) for 1 h, 3 μl of V5 antibodies for 2 h, and 50 μl of ImmunoPure® Immobilized Protein G overnight on an end-over-end rotator. The immobilized proteins were washed twice with cell lysis buffer and then deglycosylated in 45 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% octylglucopyranoside, 1% β-mercaptoethanol supplemented with 2 units of N-glycosidase F (F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Ltd., Basel, Switzerland) at 37 °C for 18 h. Proteins bound to ImmunoPure® Immobilized Protein G were eluted twice with 15 μl SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the eluates were pooled. Proteins in 50 μl of total cell extracts were deglycosylated with 2 units of N-glycosidase F at 37 °C for 18 h. The reactions were stopped with protein gel loading buffer. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins in cell extracts obtained with lysis buffer or immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose Hybond™ ECL™ membranes (Amersham Biosciences UK Ltd., Buckinghamshire, UK) in a Trans-Blot® SD semidry transfer cell (Bio-Rad) at 20 V for 80 min. Immunoblots were washed with water for 5 min, 2 m NaOH for 10 min, and with water for 5 min. They were then blocked with 5% low fat milk. The epitope-tagged proteins were detected with alkaline phosphatase-labeled monoclonal V5 and myc antibodies (Invitrogen) (diluted 1:3,000 and 1:15,000 in 1% low fat milk, respectively) or with mouse monoclonal myc antibodies 9E10.2 (diluted 1:50 in 5% low fat milk) (9Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar) and secondary alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat antibodies to mouse IgG (1: 15,000 final dilution in 1% low fat milk) (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Actin as a reference for total protein loading was visualized with monoclonal antibodies to actin (diluted 1:5,000 in 5% low fat milk) (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) and secondary alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat antibodies to mouse IgG (1:15,000 in 1% low fat milk). The alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescence with the Immun-Star® AP substrate pack (Bio-Rad) using a VersaDoc™ Imaging System (Bio-Rad). Data Analysis—The values for half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50) were calculated by non-linear regression analysis using Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). The results are means ± S.E. Differences between mean values were analyzed by analysis of variance. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Total and Cell Surface Expression of Intact and Mutant V5-mCLR and of myc-mRAMP1 and myc-mRAMP2—The relative expression levels of the V5-mCLR and of the N-terminal deletion mutants and of myc-mRAMP1 and myc-mRAMP2 in transiently transfected COS-7 cells were estimated on Western blots of cell extracts (Fig. 2). The expression of the intact V5-mCLR was the same in the absence and presence of myc-mRAMP1. The expression levels of the V5-mCLR-(Δ14-20) and-(Δ18-20) in the presence of myc-mRAMP1 were comparable and those of V5-mCLR-(14-20A) and -(Δ14-17) slightly higher than that of the intact V5-mCLR. Myc-mRAMP1 was expressed at equal levels with intact and mutant V5-mCLR. The expression levels of the V5-mCLR in the absence and the presence of myc-mRAMP2 were similar and comparable with those of the V5-mCLR-(Δ18-20) in the presence of mycmRAMP2. The V5-mCLR-(Δ14-20) and -(Δ14-17) were expressed at lower and the V5-mCLR-(14-20A) at higher levels than the intact V5-mCLR in the presence of myc-mRAMP2. Myc-mRAMP2 was lower in the presence of the V5-mCLR-(Δ14-17) than together with the V5-mCLR or the other mutants. The expression of the intact and mutant V5-mCLR and of the myc-mRAMP1 and myc-mRAMP2 at the cell surface was visualized by V5 and myc immunofluorescence staining of intact COS-7 cells (Fig. 3). Cells transfected with the empty pcDNA3 expression vector or with myc-mRAMP1 alone did not stain (Fig. 3A), but myc-mRAMP1 was recognized in permeabilized COS-7 cells (not shown). Thus, myc-mRAMP1 in the absence of the V5-mCLR was not transported to the cell surface. But the V5-mCLR and myc-mRAMP2 expressed alone were both recognized at the cell surface. The cell surface expression of the intact V5-mCLR and of the mutants in the presence of mycmRAMP1 or myc-mRAMP2 was comparable (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the expression of myc-mRAMP1 and myc-mRAMP2 at the cell surface was the same in cells co-expressing the intact V5-mCLR or the different mutants. Taken together, the mutations introduced into the N-terminal extracellular domain of the V5-mCLR did not affect the expression of the receptors and the RAMP at the cell surface. Stimulation of cAMP Production—In COS-7 cells transiently co-transfected with myc-mRAMP1 and V5-mCLR expression constructs basal cAMP concentrations were 1.1 ± 0.2 pmol/100,000 cells. The stimulation of cAMP formation by 10-6 m CGRP was 48 ± 9-fold (100%) and indistinguishable in cells expressing myc-mRAMP1/V5-mCLR-(Δ14-17), -(14-20A), -(Δ14 -20), or -(Δ18-20) (Fig. 4, Table I). The EC50 of CGRP in myc-RAMP1/V5-mCLR-, -(Δ14-17)-, -(14-20A)-, and -(Δ14-20)-expressing cells were 0.12 ± 0.01 nm, 0.24 ± 0.12 nm, 1.0 ± 0.2 nm, and 1.5 ± 0.4 nm, respectively. In cells co-expressing myc-mRAMP1 and the V5-mCLR-(Δ18-20), on the other hand, the EC50 of CGRP was >100 nm.Table IcAMP stimulation in COS-7 cellsmyc-mRAMP1myc-mRAMP2EC50, rCGRPMaximal responseaMaximal cAMP stimulation of V5-mCLR was set to 100%.EC50, rAMMaximal responseaMaximal cAMP stimulation of V5-mCLR was set to 100%.nm%nm%V5-mCLR0.12 ± 0.011000.80 ± 0.20100V5-mCLR-(Δ14-17)0.24 ± 0.12106 ± 129.3 ± 3.4bp < 0.05 versus V5-mCLR.101 ± 21V5-mCLR-(14-20A)1.0 ± 0.2cp < 0.01 versus V5-mCLR.122 ± 14170 ± 54bp < 0.05 versus V5-mCLR.77 ± 7bp < 0.05 versus V5-mCLR.V5-mCLR-(Δ14-20)1.5 ± 0.4bp < 0.05 versus V5-mCLR.99 ± 16>1,0008 ± 1cp < 0.01 versus V5-mCLR.V5-mCLR-(Δ18-20)152 ± 48bp < 0.05 versus V5-mCLR.76 ± 1959 ± 7bp < 0.05 versus V5-mCLR.104 ± 33a Maximal cAMP stimulation of V5-mCLR was set to 100%.b p < 0.05 versus V5-mCLR.c p < 0.01 versus V5-mCLR. Open table in a new tab In COS-7 cells co-expressing myc-mRAMP2 and the V5-mCLR or the indicated mutants, basal cAMP levels were between 0.6 ± 0.1 and 2.0 ± 0.2 pmol/100,000 cells. In cells expressing myc-mRAMP2 together with the V5-mCLR or the -(Δ14-17), -(Δ18-20), and -(14-20A) mutants 10-6 m AM stimulated cAMP formation to comparable levels, and the EC50 values were 0.8 ± 0.2 nm, 9.3 ± 3.4 nm, 59 ± 7.2 nm, and >100 nm, respectively (Fig. 4, Table I). In contrast, in myc-mRAMP2/V5-mCLR-(Δ14-20)-expressing cells the cAMP levels were not affected at up to 10-7 m AM. Taken together, the deletion of amino acids 14-20 of the extreme N terminus of the mCLR maintains CGRP receptor function in the presence of mRAMP1 but abolishes the mRAMP2-dependent AM receptor activity. Cell Surface Association of Intact and Mutant V5-mCLR with myc-mRAMP1 and myc-mRAMP2—The association at the cell surface of the V5-mCLR or its mutants with myc-mRAMP1 or myc-mRAMP2 was assessed by chemical cross-linking of corresponding myc-mRAMP/V5-mCLR heterodimers in transiently transfected, intact COS-7 cells. Protein components with a V5 epitope tag were immunoprecipitated from cell homogenates and deglycosylated. The extracted proteins were then separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed on Western blots with V5 and myc antibodies. Predominant V5-immunoreactive protein components with an apparent size of ∼50 kDa represented the V5-mCLR and the indicated mutants (Fig. 5). The amounts of the V5-mCLR and of the mutants in the presence of myc-mRAMP1 were comparable and not different from V5-mCLR in the absence of myc-mRAMP1. In the presence of myc-mRAMP2 the amounts of the V5-mCLR and of the V5-mCLR-(14-20A) and -(Δ18-20) were similar, but those of the V5-mCLR-(Δ14-20) and of the V5-mCLR-(Δ14-17) were lower. The amount of the V5-mCLR in the absence of myc-mRAMP2 was also lower than in its presence. The extracts obtained with V5 antibodies from cells that expressed the V5-mCLR or its mutants together with mycmRAMP1 contained myc-immunoreactive protein components of 16 kDa and ∼66 kDa apparent size. They represented intact myc-mRAMP1 and myc-mRAMP1 cross-linked at the cell surface to the V5-mCLR and the mutants, respectively. This indicated that the deletions and substitutions introduced into the N terminus of the mCLR did not affect the formation and cell surface expression of mCLR/mRAMP1 heterodimers. Immunoprecipitation with V5 antibodies of cells co-expressing myc-mRAMP2 together with the intact and mutant V5-mCLR revealed predominant myc-immunoreactive protein components of ∼18 kDa apparent size. They represented deglycosylated myc-mRAMP2 co-precipitating with the intact and mutant V5-mCLR. Interestingly, receptor/myc-mRAMP2 cell surface cross-linking products of ∼70 kDa were only recognized in extracts of cells that co-expressed myc-mRAMP2 together with the intact V5-mCLR or with the mutant V5-mCLR-(14-20A) and -(Δ18-20). All together, this indicated that the deletion of amino acids 14-17 or 14-20 of the extreme N terminus of the mCLR did not affect co-immunoprecipitation of mycmRAMP2 but prevented chemical cross-linking at the cell surface. Since the V5-mCLR-(14-20A) and myc-mRAMP2 revealed a cross-linking product, the Lys17 residue is excluded as the cross-linking site between the V5-mCLR and myc-mRAMP2. The structures of CLR/RAMP1 or CLR/RAMP2 defining CGRP or AM selectivity are largely unknown. The N-terminal extracellular domains of RAMP1 and RAMP2 determine in part CGRP and AM specificity of the CLR (3Fraser N.J. Wise A. Brown J. McLatchie L.M. Main M.J. Foord S.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Along these lines, chemical cross-linking of 125I-CGRP or 125I-AM to intact cells expressing the CLR with RAMP1 or RAMP2 revealed 125ICGRP/RAMP1 and 125I-AM/RAMP2 cross-linking products (10Hilairet S. Foord S.M. Marshall F.H. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29575-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This indicated that extracellular subdomains of the RAMP are presumably in close proximity and contribute to the CGRP and AM binding sites of CLR/RAMP1 and CLR/RAMP2 heterodimers. Accordingly, RAMP1, through association with the CTR, the closest homologue of the CLR in the family B of G protein-coupled receptors, brings about a CGRP receptor isotype (11Leuthäuser K. Gujer R. Aldecoa A. McKinney R.A. Muff R. Fischer J.A. Born W. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The CTR, on the other hand, unlike the CLR, does not recognize AM in the presence of RAMP2. This indicates that structural elements in the CLR, that are not present in the CTR, are required for the AM receptor function of RAMP2/CLR heterodimers. Interestingly, the overall homology of the amino acid sequences of the CLR and the CTR is 60%, but the extreme N-terminal region of the receptors differs more widely. Here, targeted deletion and alanine substitution mutagenesis in the N-terminal regions of the mCLR identified amino acids 14-20 with the sequence TRNKIMT as a receptor domain that is required for the high affinity interaction with AM in the presence of mRAMP2. Deletion of the TRNKIMT sequence abolished the AM receptor function of the V5-mCLR without affecting the expression at the cell surface and heterodimerization with myc-mRAMP2. Chemical cross-linking of myc-mRAMP2 with the V5-mCLR at the surface of intact cells indicates the close proximity of the extracellular domains of the corresponding proteins. Cross-linking was no longer possible when the TRNKIMT sequence of the V5-mCLR was deleted. Cell-surface cross-linking of mycmRAMP2 to the V5-mCLR with a TRNK deletion was also not observed, but here the AM receptor function in the presence of myc-mRAMP2 was maintained. The results may imply that the chemical cross-linker BS3 coupled myc-mRAMP2 to the Lys17 residue in the V5-mCLR, but this was ruled out by the substitution of the TRNKIMT sequence by 7 alanine residues revealing myc-mRAMP2/V5-mCLR-(14-20A) cross-linking products indistinguishable from myc-mRAMP2/V5-mCLR. Taken together, the results demonstrate that structural alterations in the N-terminal extracellular domain of the V5-mCLR brought about by the deletion of the TRNKIMT sequence inhibit the formation of a high affinity AM recognition site in mycmRAMP2/V5-mCLR-(Δ14-20) heterodimers. The structural alterations in the N-terminal extracellular domain of the V5-mCLR are less severe when the TRNKIMT sequence is replaced by 7 alanines. Here, low affinity interaction with AM and chemical cross-linking of the myc-mRAMP2/V5-mCLR-(14-20A) complex at the cell surface was maintained. In an attempt to assign the defect in AM receptor function of the V5-mCLR-(Δ14-20) to parts of the TRNKIMT motif, the TRNK and the IMT sequences were individually deleted. Interestingly, the CGRP and AM receptor functions of the V5-mCLR were minimally affected by the TRNK deletion. The deletion of the IMT sequence, on the other hand, increased the half-maximal concentrations of both CGRP and AM for the stimulation of cAMP formation by 2 orders of magnitude. Thus, minor changes in the amino acid sequence of the mCLR N-terminal extracellular domain impair high affinity interactions of mCLR/mRAMP1 and mCLR/mRAMP2 heterodimers with CGRP and AM. Along these lines, the substitution of Asn117 in a consensus N-glycosylation site of the human CLR by amino acids other than Asp abolished the CGRP and AM receptor functions in the presence of RAMP1 and RAMP2 (12Gujer R. Aldecoa A. Bühlmann N. Leuthäuser K. Muff R. Fischer J.A. Born W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5392-5398Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In conclusion, minimal amino acid deletions or substitutions in the N-terminal extracellular domain of the CLR reveal distinct CGRP and/or AM receptor defects of the respective CLR/RAMP1 and CLR/RAMP2 heterodimers. Here, the deletion of the sequence TRNKIMT, corresponding to amino acids 14-20 in the mCLR, selectively abolished its AM receptor function. This observation is important for the development of AM receptor deficient animals to reveal distinct biological functions of AM and CGRP in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2070262397,"To determine if: (1) 5′ CpG island methylation is related to Fhit inactivation; (2) there are tumor or carcinogen-specific methylation patterns, we examined 35 CpG sites in the promoter, exon and intron 1 of the mouse Fhit gene. In primary tumors of lung, urinary bladder and tongue, induced by different carcinogens, 15–35% of sites were methylated, with specific methylation patterns associated with each cancer type, suggesting cancer- or tissue-specific methylation patterns. The methylation patterns were associated with reduced Fhit expression, as determined by immunohistochemical analyses. Methylation of rat Fhit 5′ CpGs in mammary adenocarcinomas, detected by methylation specific PCR amplification, also correlated with reduced gene expression. Thus, there was an overall association between promoter/exon 1 methylation and decreased Fhit expression. In contrast, in cancer-derived cell lines 70–95% of the CpG sites were methylated. This is the first detailed study of the relationship between Fhit 5′ CpG island methylation and Fhit expression in murine tumors, our main models for preclinical cancer studies, and provides evidence that loss of Fhit expression and methylation are correlated in these mouse models and these models will be useful to examine the complex relationships among gene expression, methylation patterns and organ specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2076687847,"The Xenopus αfast-tropomyosin gene contains, at its 3′ -end, a composite internal/3′ -terminal exon (exon 9A9′), which is subjected to three different patterns of splicing according to the cell type. Exon 9A9′ is included as a terminal exon in the myotome and as an internal exon in adult striated muscles, whereas it is skipped in nonmuscle cells. We have developed an in vivo model based on transient expression of minigenes encompassing the regulated exon 9A9′ in Xenopus oocytes and embryos. We first show that the different α-tropomyosin minigenes recapitulate the splicing pattern of the endogenous gene and constitute valuable tools to seek regulatory sequences involved in exon 9A9′ usage. A mutational analysis led to the identification of an intronic element that is involved in the repression of exon 9A9′ in nonmuscle cells. This element harbors four polypyrimidine track-binding protein (PTB) binding sites that are essential for the repression of exon 9A9′. We show using UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation experiments that Xenopus PTB (XPTB) interacts with these PTB binding sites. Finally, we show that depletion of endogenous XPTB in Xenopus embryos using a morpholinobased translational inhibition strategy resulted in exon 9A9′ inclusion in embryonic epidermal cells. These results demonstrate that XPTB is required in vivo to repress the terminal exon 9A9′ and suggest that PTB could be a major actor in the repression of regulated 3′ -terminal exon.

Alternative splicing is a widespread mechanism in metazoans, by which multiple mRNAs can be produced from a single gene. This process is often subjected to tissue or developmental control and allows the production of protein isoforms differing in specific domains. Over the last few years, some general topics have emerged from the intensive studies undertaken to elucidate the mechanism of alternative splicing. It is thus established that regulated exons are generally flanked by suboptimal splice sites whose recognition is modulated by cis-acting regulatory sequences present within exons or introns. In most cases, alternative exons are subject to positive and negative regulation which insures a tight control on their usage (reviewed in Ref. 1Caceres J.F. Kornblihtt A.R. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 186-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Numerous trans-acting factors that modulate alternative splicing have also been characterized. These regulatory factors belong to two broad families of RNA-binding proteins, designated hnRNP proteins and RS-domain proteins. The latter includes the SR protein subfamily (2Fu X.D. RNA. 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar, 3Graveley B.R. RNA. 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar) that is involved in constitutive or alternative exon recognition through exonic sequence called exonic enhancer (4Blencowe B.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 106-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Despite this significant breakthrough, the basis of tissue regulation of alternative splicing is still poorly understood in vertebrates. Indeed, contrary to the paradigm described in Drosophila, where many splicing events are controlled by tissue-specific factors (5Lopez A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 279-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), to date the implication of such factors appears limited in vertebrates. To overcome this lack of tissue specific factors it was proposed that ubiquitously expressed splicing factors could determine a cellular code based on variation of their relative levels or activities in various tissues (6Smith C.W. Valcarcel J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). A current model proposes that hnRNP packaging prevents exon use and that their displacement is a preamble to a splicing complex assembly. For example, hnRNP A1 can antagonize the promotion of alternative exon usage that occurs through the binding of SR proteins to purine-rich exonic enhancer (7Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 365-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 8Caceres J.F. Stamm S. Helfman D.M. Krainer A.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1706-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). The ubiquitously expressed polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB designated also hnRNP I) has been implicated in the repression of several alternative exons including exon 7 of β-tropomyosin (9Mulligan G.J. Guo W. Wormsley S. Helfman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25480-25487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), exon N of GABAγ2 (10Ashiya M. Grabowski P.J.

RNA. 1998; 4: 85-100PubMed Google Scholar), and exon 9 of caspase-2 (18Cote J. Dupuis S. Wu J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8535-8543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). PTB binds especially to pyrimidine-rich intronic splicing silencer elements present upstream or downstream of the alternative exon. These pyrimidine-rich elements frequently contain several high affinity binding motifs UCUU and (C/U)UCUCU (10Ashiya M. Grabowski P.J. RNA. 1997; 3: 996-1015PubMed Google Scholar, 19Perez I. Lin C.H. McAfee J.G. Patton J.G. RNA. 1997; 3: 764-778PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of PTB in alternative exon repression was recently demonstrated by RNAi-mediated PTB depletion that leads to an increase in exon IIIb of FGF-R2 and exon EIIIb of fibronectin inclusion (20Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 943-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). From all of these data, it was proposed that PTB has a general role in exon silencing and preventing exon definition (21Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3281-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). 3′-Terminal exons can also be differentially processed (reviewed in Ref. 22Edwalds-Gilbert G. Veraldi K.L. Milcarek C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2547-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). However, selection of alternative 3′-terminal exons differs in many aspects from that of internal exon, since it could potentially be regulated at several levels including transcriptional termination and competition between splice sites and cleavage-polyadenylation signals. Use of a proximal 3′-terminal exon can be simply controlled by the selection of a proximal polyadenylation signal, since cleavage at this site excludes the distal 3′-terminal exon and subsequently any competition with this distal exon. Indeed, to date extensive studies performed with the calatonin/calcium gene-related protein (CT/CGRP) and heavy chain immunoglobulin gene pre-mRNAs have especially highlighted the importance of the cleavage/polyadenylation reaction in the selection of alternative 3′-terminal exons. Thus, the processing of the CT/CGRP pre-mRNA is regulated at the level of polyadenylation through the action of a complex intronic enhancer localized downstream of the proximal 3′-terminal exon (23Lou H. Gagel R.F. Berget S.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 208-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In the same way, it was demonstrated that the differential processing of the heavy chain immunoglobulin μ gene during B-cell maturation did not require Ig gene-specific sequences (24Peterson M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7891-7898Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and was regulated primarily by changes in the activity of the general polyadenylation factor CstF-64 (25Takagaki Y. Seipelt R.L. Peterson M.L. Manley J.L. Cell. 1996; 87: 941-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 26Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 761-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of the polyadenylation signals in the regulation of 3′-terminal exons, it is difficult to explain a complete switch between two 3′-terminal alternative exons only by a change in the efficiency of the cleavage-polyadenylation efficiency. It is of particular interest to understand how a proximal exon is excluded when a distal 3′-terminal exon is selected. Active repression of the proximal 3′-terminal exon, as described for the internal alternative exons, could be a mechanism to ensure a complete skipping of this exon. In this study, with the aim of investigating the involvement of polyadenylation versus splicing in the selection of 3′-terminal regulated exons, we developed an in vivo splicing model based on the differential processing of the Xenopus α-tropomyosin pre-mRNA. This pre-mRNA possesses three alternative 3′-terminal exons designated exons 9A9′, 9B, and 9D, whose differential selection generates three distinct mRNAs (27Hardy S. Fiszman M.Y. Osborne H.B. Thiebaud P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28Hardy S. Hamon S. Cooper B. Mohun T. Thiebaud P. Mech. Dev. 1999; 87: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this article, we focus our attention on the regulation of exon 9A9′ that is subjected to a complex regulation. Exon 9A9′ is skipped in nonmuscle cells, whereas it is used as a terminal or internal exon in somitic and adult striated cells, respectively. For this reason, we designated this exon as a composite internal/3′-terminal exon. Using minigenes whose expression is targeted in embryonic epidermal or somitic cells or oocytes, we show that a genomic fragment encompassing exon 9A9′ contains all of the cis sequences necessary for accurate regulation during development. By a mutagenesis approach, we characterize an intronic element lying between the branch site and exon 9A9′ involved in the repression of this exon in nonmuscle cells. This element, which is pyrimidine-rich, binds PTB in vitro and contains four high affinity PTB binding sites. We first showed that mutation of these binding sites, which abolishes PTB binding, correlates with the loss of exon 9A9′ repression in the oocyte and embryonic epidermal cells. To ascertain a physiological role of XPTB in exon 9A9′ repression, we depleted endogenous XPTB in Xenopus embryos using a morpholinobased translation inhibition strategy. XPTB knockdown resulted in a strong inclusion of exon 9A9′ in embryonic epidermal cells. This study demonstrates that the composite exon 9A9′ is repressed in nonmuscle cells as a 3′-terminal exon by PTB and suggests that PTB could be a major actor in repression of regulated 3′-terminal exon. It also establishes Xenopus oocyte and embryo as valid models to study the tissue-specific regulation of alternative splicing in vivo. Embryo Culture and Injection—Xenopus laevis eggs were obtained from laboratory-reared females and fertilized artificially. Embryos were staged according to the table of Nieuwkoop and Faber (29Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis (Daudin). Garland Publishing, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). For DNA injection, 250 pg of supercoiled DNA were injected in one blastomere at the two-cell stage. Injections were carried out in F1 medium (30Grandin N. Charbonneau M. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 55-67PubMed Google Scholar) containing 5% Ficoll, and the embryos were cultured until Stage 26. Oocyte Culture and Injection—Pieces of X. laevis ovary were dissected and treated with collagenase, and individual Stage VI oocytes were prepared for microinjection as described in (31Chesnel F. Bonnec G. Tardivel A. Boujard D. Dev. Biol. 1997; 188: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Injection and culture of oocytes were carried out in OR2 medium (32Wallace R.A. Jared D.W. Dumont J.N. Sega M.W. J. Exp. Zool. 1973; 184: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). For nuclear injection, oocytes were previously centrifuged to allow the visualization of the germinal vesicle as described in Ref. 33Carroll D. Richter J.D. A Comparative Methods Approach to the Study of Oocytes and Embryos. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1999: 173-195Google Scholar. For minigene injection, 1 ng of supercoiled DNA was microinjected into the nucleus. For RNA competition experiments, different amounts of in vitro transcribed RNA were co-injected with minigenes. Plasmid Constructions—The plasmids pBS-SV40, pBS-actin, and pBS-keratin, which contain the SV40 early promoter, the Xenopus cardiac actin promoter, and the Xenopus keratin promoter, respectively, have been described previously (34Duriez P. Lesimple M. Allo M.R. Hardy S. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Wild type minigenes were generated by subcloning the BamHI/SalI-digested Xαg7–9B fragment from the pGEM-Xαg7–9B plasmid into the different expression vectors. All of the mutated minigenes were produced by primer-directed PCR mutagenesis and cassette substitutions. Two cassettes were used depending on the localization of the mutation. A first cassette localized between SnabI and MluI sites present within the 5′ region and 3′ region, respectively, of intron 7-8 was used to substitute all of the mutations introduced in intron 7-8 upstream of the MluI site. A second cassette localized between the MluI restriction site and a BsaBI restriction site present within the 5′ region of intron 9A9′-9B was used to substitute all of the mutations introduced in intron 7-8 downstream of the MluI restriction site or in exon 9A9′. For each mutation, the amplified region was cloned into the pGEM-T vector and sequenced. The mutated fragment was then substituted to the wild type sequence using the SnaBI/MluI or the MluI/BsaBI cassettes. The region 150PY present within intron 7-8 was PCR-amplified with the following primers: Int7-8 ss2 (5′-TTGCCAATGTCTCCAACCCT-3′) and Int7-8as2 (5′-GGTGGCACAAAAGAGGAGGG-3′). The resulting fragment was cloned into pGEM-T to generate the plasmid pGEM-150PY. The region 150pBS was amplified using the plasmid pBS(-) (Stratagene) as template and the following primers: pBS150ss (5′-CCGCGGCCTATCTCGGTC-3′) and pBS150as (5′-GATATCAATGGCGAATGGCG-3′). The AG dinucleotides present, within the 150pBS sequence, in positions 30 and 70 were subsequently mutated to TT by primer-directed PCR mutagenesis. The resulting fragment was cloned into pGEM-T to generate the plasmid pGEM-150pBS. For cross-link experiments, the open reading frame of XPTB was amplified by PCR from the hnRNPI cDNA (35Cote C.A. Gautreau D. Denegre J.M. Kress T.L. Terry N.A. Mowry K.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 431-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) using an upstream primer containing a BamHI restriction site and a downstream primer designed to remove the stop codon and containing a NotI restriction site. The product was cloned as a BamHI/NotI fragment into the pT7TS-V5 vector in frame with the carboxyl V5 epitope tag. The pT7TS-V5 vector was constructed by cloning the V5 epitope tag into the BglII/SpeI restriction sites of the pT7-TS vector (provided by Paul Krieg, University of Texas). Isolation of RNA and RT 1The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcriptase; PTB, polypyrimidine tract-binding protein; XPTB, Xenopus polypyrimidine tractbinding protein; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; MO, morpholino oligomer; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; nt, nucleotide(s). -PCR Analysis of the Exogenous Transcripts—Total RNA was isolated from oocytes and embryos by Harland and Misher's proteinase K/LiCl method (36Harland R. Misher L. Development. 1988; 102: 837-852PubMed Google Scholar). When RNA preparations were used to assay exogenous transcripts, a RQ1 DNase treatment was added in order to remove any residual plasmid DNA template. For RT-PCR, cDNAs were obtained using 10 μg of RNA and 1 μg of an oligo(dT) anchor primer (5′-VTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCAGCTGTAGCTATGCGCACAG-3′). The reaction was performed in 25 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm dNTPs. Annealing of the oligo(dT) anchor primer was performed for 3 min at 85 °C, followed by 5 min at 37 °C, after which 100 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) was added, and the reaction was further incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Samples of 5 μl were then used for the PCR amplification that was performed with 32P-end-labeled sense primers specific of each minigene and an antisense PCR-anchor primer (5′-CAGCTGTAGCTATGCGCACCAG-3′). Sense primers were either actin ex7ss oligonucleotide (5′-CACAGCACGGGGATCCAGTC-3′) or keratin ex7ss oligonucleotide (5′-GTCCGGATCCAGTCTCCCAG-3′) or sv40ex7ss oligonucleotide (5′-GCTCAGATCCAGTCTCCAGAAG-3′). Following an initial denaturation a 94 °C for 3 min, the reaction was carried out for 22 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 3 s. Labeled PCR products were analyzed on a 4% nondenaturating polyacrylamide gel. Quantification of radioactive PCR products was performed on a “Storm” Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software. In all cases, at least three independent microinjection experiments were carried out and analyzed. For the analysis of mutated minigenes, the wild type minigene was always microinjected in parallel as a control. In Vitro Transcription—150PY and 150pBS competitor RNAs were transcribed from pGEM vectors, linearized at a SalI site, using the mMessage mMachine T7 kit (Ambion). Recombinant V5-tagged XPTB-capped mRNA was transcribed from pT7TS-V5 vector, linearized at BamHI, with the mMessage mMachine T7 kit (Ambion). Full-length recombinant V5-tagged XPTB was produced in nucleasetreated rabbit reticulocyte lysate according to instructions (Promega). Antibodies and Western Blot Analysis—XPTB antibodies were raised in rabbits against two separate synthetic peptides encompassing residues 40–55 (peptide 1, YGSNGNDSKKFKGDGR) and 438–453 (peptide 2, PREGQEDQGLTKDYST) of XPTB by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). XPTB antibodies used in this study were then purified by immunoaffinity chromatography against the second synthetic peptide. Anti-V5 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Invitrogen. PCNA and β-tubulin monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Sigma. For Western blot analysis, proteins were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE minigels and electrophoresed. Gel-separated proteins were then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schüll), followed by a blocking of the membrane in a blocking buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, 5% nonfat dry milk, pH 8). The membranes were probed for4hat room temperate with the appropriate antibodies diluted in blocking buffer (1:500 XPTB immunoaffinity-purified, 1:5000 V5 monoclonal antibody, 1:5000 PCNA monoclonal antibody, 1:1000 β-tubulin monoclonal antibody), washed in wash buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, pH 8), and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the appropriate phosphatase alkaline-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson). The membranes were then sequentially washed in wash buffer and alkaline buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9), and proteins were revealed with a nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate kit (Sigma). For XPTB quantification, the protein was detected with the enhanced chemifluorescence technique according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified by PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). UV Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation—The 150PY and 150PY mut PTB 1–4 RNAs were synthesized directly from DNA templates amplified by PCR. pGEM-T 150PY was used as the PCR template with the T7150PY primer that comprises the sequence of the T7 promoter (T7150PYwt (5′-AAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTTTCTTGCCAATGTCTCC-3′) and the In7-8 as 2 primer (5′-GGTGGCACAAAAGAGGAGG-3′). pGEM-T 150PY mut PTB 1–4 was used as the PCR template with the T7150PY primer that comprises the T7 promoter (5′-AAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTTCCCCGCCAATGTCTCC-3′) and the In7-8 mut PTB as primer (5′-GGCACAAGGGGGGAGGGTAGTAGGGGC-3′). 5 pmol of PCR product were used for transcription in a 30-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mm MgCl2; 10 mm NaCl; 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9; 10 mm dithiothreitol; 10 units of RNAsin (Promega); 3 mm each rATP, rCTP, and rGTP; 0.3 mm rUTP; 40 mCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences); and 160 units of T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). Radiolabeled RNA (3.5 pmol, about 200,000 cpm) was incubated for 15 min at 4 °C with 5 μl of in vitro translated XPTB or nuclear extract corresponding to five germinal vesicles manually extracted from Stage VI oocytes in the following binding buffer: 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 3 mm MgCl2, 80 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 16% glycerol, 1 μg/μl yeast tRNA. The reaction mixtures were then irradiated for 10 min at 4 °C with a 254-nm UV light at a distance of 10 cm from the source. RNA components were digested by the addition of 100 units of RNase T1 for 1 h at 37 °C. The labeled cross-linked proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized on a PhosphorImager or by autoradiography. In vitro translated XPTB was immunoprecipitated using Protein G-Sepharose beads coated with monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen). Endogenous XPTB from germinal vesicle extracts was selected using protein A-Sepharose beads coated with our anti-XPTB serum. Immunoselection was performed at 4 °C in IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Igepal). The beads were subsequently washed three times with IP buffer containing 0.25% Igepal. Immunoselected proteins were eluted with 20 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and fractionated on a 10% SDS-PAGE. Cross-linked proteins were visualized on a PhosphorImager or transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for Western blot analysis. Morpholino Oligonucleotide Injection and XPTB Rescue—Morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) were obtained from Gene Tools, LLC. The XPTB-MO sequence is 5′-AACAATTCCTTCCATGGCACACTAA-3′, and the control MO sequence is 5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′. Oligonucleotides were resuspended in distilled H2O to a stock concentration of 10 μg/ml, and 20 ng/blastomere was injected into both blastomeres at the two-cell stage. For XPTB rescue, a V5-tagged XPTB mRNA that had third base modification at the 5′-end to prevent its hybridization with XPTB-MO was prepared. The sequence of the 5′ modification is 5′-GGGATCCACCATGGAGGGCATAGTCCAAGATATAACAG-3′. The start codon and modified nucleotides are underlined. 100 pg of V5-tagged XPTB mRNA was microinjected together with 40 ng of XPTB-MO. Minigenes Driven by Tissue-specific Promoters Recapitulate the Specific Use of Exon 9A9′ in Muscle Tissue and Its Repression in Nonmuscle Tissues—The differential processing of the 3′-terminal region of the Xenopus αfast-tropomyosin pre-mRNA generates three distinct mRNAs (Fig. 1A). In somites, exon 9A9′ is used as a terminal exon with the selection of a polyadenylation signal designated αe (where “e” represents embryonic), leading to the production of XTMα7 RNA. In embryonic heart and adult striated muscles, an internal 5′ splice site present within exon 9A9′ is selected, and exon 9A is spliced to the terminal exon 9B to produce XTMα2 RNA (28Hardy S. Hamon S. Cooper B. Mohun T. Thiebaud P. Mech. Dev. 1999; 87: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this case, one of the two polyadenylation signals arranged in tandem present within exon 9B and designated αa (where “a” represents adult) is used. Therefore, exon 9A9′ behaves like a composite internal/terminal exon, depending on the myogenesis stage at which the α-tropomyosin gene is expressed. Finally, in nonmuscle cells, the processing reaction skips over exons 9A9′ and 9B and splices exon 8 directly to the terminal exon 9D to produce XTM05 RNA (27Hardy S. Fiszman M.Y. Osborne H.B. Thiebaud P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To study the mechanisms involved in the regulation of the composite exon 9A9′ during development, the genomic region encompassing exon 7 to exon 9B was cloned by PCR and further analyzed (the sequence and its analysis are available as supplementary Fig. 1). The genomic fragment, designated Xαg7–9B, was then cloned downstream of tissue-specific promoters in order to study the differential use of the terminal exons in muscle and nonmuscle tissues during early development. Three promoters were used: the Xenopus cardiac actin promoter that is activated, around Stage 12, specifically in somites and embryonic heart (37Mohun T.J. Garrett N. Gurdon J.B. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3185-3193Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar); the Xenopus larval keratin promoter that is specifically activated in epidermis (38Jonas E.A. Snape A.M. Sargent T.D. Development. 1989; 106: 399-405PubMed Google Scholar); and the SV40 early promoter that is functional in Xenopus oocyte (39Krieg P. Strachan R. Wallis E. Tabe L. Colman A. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 615-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cardiac actin and keratin-driven minigenes were injected into two-cell stage embryos, which were then cultured until tail bud stage (Stage 26). The mRNA was assayed by labeled 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends in samples representing equal numbers of whole embryos (Fig. 1B). The size and the composition of each expected PCR product are indicated in Fig. 1C. The results are presented in Fig. 2A. A major product of 352 nt, containing exon 9A9′ (α7-type RNA) was present with the cardiac actin promoter. A faint product of 468 nt, containing exons 9A and 9B (α2-type RNA) was also present. A minor splicing product of 389 nt was also amplified. Cloning and sequencing of the corresponding fragment showed that it corresponds to a maturation product in which exon 8 was spliced directly to exon 9B, and it was designated α2Δ9A. Quantification of the different amplified fragments showed that α7-type RNA represents about 87% of the matured transcripts, whereas the minor products α2-type and α2Δ9A-type RNAs represent altogether <12% of the matured RNA. On the other hand, with the keratin-driven minigene, >70% of the mature transcripts correspond to α2Δ9A-type RNA. In non-muscle tissues, the endogenous α-tropomyosin gene produces RNA containing exon 8 and exon 9D but no α2Δ9A-type RNA. Therefore, our results suggest that in the context of the minigene, in which exon 9D is not present, the specific repression of exon 9A9′ in nonmuscle cells still occurs and that exon 8 is spliced to exon 9B as a default choice. Splicing of the endogenous α-tropomyosin pre-mRNA is also strictly regulated in the oocyte, since only one α-tropomyosin-derived mRNA (XTM05) is present in such cells (27Hardy S. Fiszman M.Y. Osborne H.B. Thiebaud P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, oocytes could be envisioned as an attractive model to study the α-tropomyosin pre-mRNA splicing regulation. Accordingly, we tested the behavior of a minigene in such a context. An SV40-driven minigene was injected in the germinal vesicles of Stage VI oocytes, followed by a 6-h incubation. The mRNA was assayed by 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. As described in embryonic epidermal cells, >80% of α2Δ9A-type RNA was produced in oocytes (Fig. 2B). Two bands corresponding to unspliced or partially spliced products primed from a poly(A) stretch present within intron 8-9A were also amplified. Their prevalence varies between experiments (data not shown), which could be related to a variation in the transcription efficiency according to the oocyte batch. The presence of these unspliced or partially splice"

GABAA receptors consist of multiple subunits and exhibit distinct pharmacological and channel properties. Of all GABAA receptor subunits, the β subunit is thought to be a key component for the functionality of the receptors. Certain types of GABAA receptors have been found to be constitutively active. However, the molecular basis for spontaneous opening of channels of these receptors is not totally understood. In this study, we showed that channels that contain the β1 but not β3 subunits opened spontaneously when these subunits were expressed homomerically or co-expressed with other types of GABAA receptor subunits in Xenopus oocytes. Using subunit chimeras and site-directed mutagenesis, we localized a key amino acid residue, a serine at position 265, that is critical in conferring an open state of the β1 subunit-containing GABAA receptors in the absence of agonist. Moreover, some point mutations of Ser-265 also produced constitutively active channels. The magnitude of spontaneous activity of these receptors was correlated with the molecular volume of the residue at 265 for both homomeric and heteromeric GABAA receptors, suggesting that the spontaneous activity of the β1 subunit-containing GABAA receptors may be mediated through a similar molecular mechanism that is dependent on the molecular volume of the residue at 265. γ-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors are major inhibitory neurotransmitter-gated ion channels in the central nervous system.

These receptors belong to a superfamily of the Cys-loop pentameric ligand-gated ion channels, which includes nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh), serotonin type 3 (5-HT3), and glycine receptors (1Maricq A.V. Peterson A.S. Brake A.J. Myers R.M. Julius D. Science. 1991; 254: 432-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). The topology of these receptors comprises a large extracellular N-terminal domain, a large intracellular loop, and four transmembrane (TM) domains (1Maricq A.V. Peterson A.S. Brake A.J. Myers R.M. Julius D. Science. 1991; 254: 432-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). The N-terminal extracellular domain contains the specific binding sites for agonists and antagonists (2Changeux J.P. Edelstein S.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 959-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The TM2 domain is thought to be a key channellining component, which determines channel properties such as conductance, rectification, and desensitization (2Changeux J.P. Edelstein S.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 959-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar).

Among these subunits, the β subunit is thought to be a key component to assemble heterooligomeric functional ion channels, to play a central role in determining the subcellular locations of GABAA receptors (4Connolly C.N.

Pharmacol. 2003; 476: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For homomeric β subunits, the constitutive activity appears to represent a major form of their functionality. Previous studies have reported that the spontaneous channel activity can vary substantially among GABAA receptor channels that contain different β subunits (11Krishek B.J. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 494-504PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wooltorton J.R. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 2225-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 19Davies P.A. Kirkness E.F. Hales T.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, the precise molecular basis for the constitutive activity of GABAA receptors is not totally understood. Here, we investigated whether the difference in spontaneous activity among different β subunits can be explained by localizing discrete sites on the receptor proteins using subunit chimeras and site-directed mutagenesis. Our data show that a single amino acid residue at position 265 in the second transmembrane domain of the β1 subunit is crucial for conferring increased opening probability of GABAA receptor ion channels in the absence of agonist. Further molecular analysis found that the magnitude of channel spontaneous opening of GABAA receptor channels is correlated with the volume of the amino acid residue at 265 of the β1 subunit. Chimeric Receptor—DNA fragments encoding the indicated regions of β1 and β3 subunits were generated by polymerase chain reaction. PCR primers were designed to introduce unique restriction sites into the targeted cDNAs without changing the encoded amino acid sequences. The chimeric β1/β3 cDNAs were constructed by cloning the PCR fragments into appropriate restriction enzyme sites of a pCM-Vscript vector (Stratagene). The chimeric C1 and C2 receptors were constructed by introducing an AflII site at position 213 of the β1 and β3 subunits. The chimeric C3 and C4 receptors were constructed by introducing a HindIII site at position 314 of the β1 and β3 subunits. The authenticity of the DNA fragments that flank the mutation site was confirmed by double strand DNA sequencing using an ABI Prism 377 automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Point mutations of a cloned rat GABAA receptor were introduced using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The authenticity of the DNA fragments that flank the mutation site was confirmed by double strand DNA sequencing using an ABI Prism 377 automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Preparation of cRNA and Expression of Receptors—Complementary RNAs were synthesized in vitro from linearized template cDNAs with mMACHINE RNA transcription kits (Ambion Inc.). The oocytes of mature Xenopus laevis frogs were isolated as described previously (20Zhang L. Peoples R.W. Oz M. Harvey-White J. Weight F.F. Brauneis U. J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 582-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Each oocyte was injected with a total of 20 ng of RNA in 20 nl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. The injected oocytes were incubated at 19 °C in modified Barth's solution (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 2.0 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Two-electrode Voltage Clamp Recording—After 2–5 days incubation, the oocytes were studied at 20–22 °C in a 90-μl chamber. The oocytes were superfused with modified Barth's solution at a rate of ∼6 ml/min. Agonists and antagonists were diluted in the bathing solution and applied to oocytes for a specified time using solenoid valve-controlled superfusion. Membrane currents were recorded by a two-electrode voltage clamp technique at a holding potential of –70 mV using a GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Data were routinely recorded on a chart recorder (Gould 2300S). Average values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Data Analysis—Statistical analysis of concentration-response curves was performed using the following form of the Hill equationI=Imax1+(EC50/[A])n(Eq.1) where I is the peak current at a given concentration of agonist A, Imax is the maximal response, EC50 is the half-maximal concentration, and n is the slope factor (apparent Hill coefficient). Data were statistically compared by the unpaired t test or analysis of variance followed by Scheffe's test as noted. Correlation analysis was carried out using nonparametric regression (Statistica, StatSoft). Homomeric β1 but Not β3 Subunits Can Form Channels That Open Spontaneously—In oocytes previously injected with cRNA of rat GABAA receptor β1 subunit (Fig. 1A, top), 3000 μm GABA activated a fast inward current. Application of 100 μm bicuculline (BIC), a selective inhibitor of GABAA receptors, did not induce any detectable current. However, picrotoxin (PTX), a chloride channel blocker, at a concentration of 100 μm produced a reversible outward current. On the other hand, both BIC and PTX did not induce any response in Xenopus oocytes expressing homomeric β3 subunits (Fig. 1A, bottom). To ensure that we could study the extent of channel opening in the absence and presence of agonist at an equivalent basis, we normalized the magnitude of PTX-sensitive outward current as percentage of maximal response, which is the sum of the amplitude of PTX-sensitive current and that of GABA-activated current (Fig. 1B). The majority of the β1 subunits appeared to be in a spontaneously active state since the maximal amplitude of outward current produced by PTX represented 88% of the normalized maximal response, which is 8-fold higher than the amplitude of inward current activated by 3000 μm GABA. PTX inhibited tonically opened ion channels formed by the β1 subunits in a concentration-dependent manner over a concentration range of 1 nm–300 μm (Fig. 1C). The EC50 value and Hill coefficient of the PTX concentration-response curve for homomeric β1 subunits were 0.3 ± 0.02 μm and 0.6 ± 0.04, whereas PTX in concentrations up to 300 μm did not trigger any detectable current in Xenopus oocytes expressing homomeric β3 subunits (Fig. 1C). The EC50 value of PTX that we found for the β1 subunits is very similar to that of PTX for the β1 subunits reported previously (10Sigel E. Baur R. Malherbe P. Mohler H. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 377-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Certain Types of Rat β1 Subunit-containing GABAA Receptors Are Spontaneously Active—The above results suggest that the homomeric β1 but not β3 subunits are constitutively active. Next, we examined whether a similar scenario could occur in heteromeric expression of the α2β1 or β1γ2 subunit combinations. While the average amplitude of maximal GABA-activated current was 27 ± 4 nA (n = 17) for the homomeric β1 subunits, the average amplitude of maximal GABA-activated currents was 1370 ± 65 nA (n = 12) for α1β1 and 868 ± 45 nA (n = 21) for β1γ2 subunit combinations. The differential sensitivity of these receptors to GABA allowed us to clearly distinguish homomeric from heteromeric GABAA receptors. In cells expressing heteromeric subunits, we found that 100 μm PTX induced outward current in oocytes co-expressing the β1 subunits with either α2 or γ2 subunits (Fig. 2A). In contrast, PTX did not induce any detectable current in cells previously injected with cRNAs of the α2β3 or β3γ2 subunits (Fig. 2B). In addition, no apparent outward current was observed in oocytes previously injected with either H2O or cRNAs of the α2β1γ2 subunits on application of 100 μm PTX (data not shown). These observations indicate that certain types of GABAA receptors containing the β1 subunit can form ion channels that are capable of opening independently of GABA. In addition, we found that the magnitude of the GABA-activated current is inversely correlated with that of the PTX-sensitive outward current (Fig. 2C; R = –0.99, a linear regression, p < 0.001), suggesting that the extent of channel opening in response to GABA depends on a preexisting conformational state of these receptor channels. Both Homomeric β1 and β3 Subunits Can Form GABA-gated Ion Channels—Whether or not the β1 and β3 homomers can form functional GABA-gated ion channels has been controversial. To address this question, we examined further the function of the β1 and β3 homomers. Oocytes exhibiting inward current in response to 3 mm GABA greater than 25 nA in amplitude were selected for this experiment. Phenobarbital, an allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors, at a concentration of 500 μm directly activated inward current when applied alone (not shown) or increased the amplitude of current activated by 10 μm GABA (Fig. 3A). In addition, GABA directly activated inward currents in a concentration-dependent manner over a concentration range of 0.1–3000 μm (Fig. 3B). The EC50 and Hill coefficient values of the GABA concentration-response curves were 7.6 ± 4 μm and 0.8 ± 0.03, respectively, for the β1 subunits and 22 ± 6 μm and 0.8 ± 0.06 for the β3 subunits. The EC50 values for the GABA concentration-response curves of the β1 and β3 subunits are significantly different (p < 0.02, unpaired t test, n = 10). Next, we determined the sensitivity of these homomeric receptors to BIC and PTX. In cells expressing β1 homomers, the application of 100 μm BIC slightly reduced the amplitude of current activated by GABA at a concentration of EC50, whereas 3 mm GABA failed to induce inward current in the presence of PTX (Fig. 3C). This suggests that PTX can completely inhibit GABA-activated current in oocytes expressing the β1 homomers and that the outward current induced by PTX is mediated through channels formed by homomeric β1 subunits. In cells expressing β3 homomers, although neither 100 μm BIC nor 100 μm PTX induced detectable outward current, these concentrations of both BIC and PTX significantly inhibited GABA-activated current. The bar graphs in Fig. 3D show the average percentage inhibition of GABA-activated inward current by 100 μm PTX and 100 μm BIC in cells expressing homomeric β1(solid bars) and β3 subunits (open bars). PTX (100 μm) inhibited currents activated by an EC50 concentration of GABA by nearly 100% in oocytes expressing either β1 or β3 homomers (Fig. 3D). On the other hand, 100 μm BIC nearly completely inhibited current activated by an EC50 concentration of GABA in cells expressing homomeric β3 subunits but had only a very small inhibitory effect in cells expressing homomeric β1 subunits. The Constitutive Activity of the β1 Subunits Was Not Affected by the Y205F Mutation—To investigate the molecular mechanisms by which the β1 receptor channels open spontaneously, we first tested whether reduction of agonist binding affinity alters the spontaneous opening of the receptor channels. To do this, we substituted tyrosine at position 205, a previously described agonist-binding site in the extracellular N-terminal domain of the β1 subunit (21Chang Y. Weiss D.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 511-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), with phenylalanine. Consistent with a previous study (21Chang Y. Weiss D.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 511-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the Y205F mutation shifted the GABA concentration-response curve to the right in a parallel manner (Fig. 4A) and increased the EC50 value by ∼10-fold (Fig. 4B; 7.6 ± 4 μm for the wild type (WT) and 82 ± 5 μm for the Y205F receptors, p < 0.001, unpaired t test). However, the sensitivity of the Y205F mutant receptors to PTX-sensitive current was nearly identical to that of the wild type receptors (Fig. 4, C and D), suggesting that the agonist-binding site is unlikely to be involved in the mechanisms that underlie the constitutive activity of homomeric β1 subunits. Chimeric Constructs: TMs (1Maricq A.V. Peterson A.S. Brake A.J. Myers R.M. Julius D. Science. 1991; 254: 432-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar–3Sigel E. Kannenberg K. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) of the β1 Subunit Are Associated with the Channel Spontaneous Opening—In view of our observation that homomeric β1 and β3 subunits of GABAA receptors exhibit a difference in PTX-induced outward current, we thought that chimeras between the β1 and β3 subunits might be an ideal approach to localize molecular domains that may be involved in the spontaneous opening of GABAA receptor channels, and therefore we constructed chimeras between the β1 and β3 subunits. Four chimeric receptors were generated, and the amplitude of PTX-induced outward current was determined. As shown in Fig. 5A, the chimeras that replaced the N terminus of the β1 subunit (C1) and the C terminus of the β1 subunit (C4) with the corresponding segments of the β3 subunit exhibited PTX-induced outward current, suggesting that the extracellular N-terminal domain, the large intracellular loop between transmembrane domains 3 and 4, and the fourth transmembrane domain as well as the extracellular C-terminal domain of the β1 subunit are not essential for spontaneous opening of the channels in the absence of GABA. However, the chimeras that contained a region from TM1 to TM3 of the β3 subunit (C2 and C3) became insensitive to PTX inhibition of channel spontaneous opening (Fig. 5B), suggesting these transmembrane domains of the β1 subunit may be critical for the constitutive activity of the receptors in the absence of agonist. In addition, to determine whether there is a relationship between the amplitude of PTX-induced current in the WT and chimeric receptors and the sensitivity of these receptors to GABA, we first determined the EC50s of the GABA concentration-response curves for these receptors as shown in Fig. 5C. Next we compared the amplitude of PTX-sensitive current with the EC50 values for the GABA concentration-response curves of the wild type and chimeric receptors (Fig. 5D). We found that there was no correlation between the EC50 values and the spontaneous activity of these receptors (R = 0.22, a linear regression, p > 0.5, n = 5). Point Mutations: A Residue (Ser-265) in the TM2 Confers Spontaneous Activity of the β1 Subunit-containing GABAA Receptors—To identify the site or sites responsible for the spontaneous opening of the homomeric β1 subunits, we aligned the amino acid sequences that flank a segment between TM1 and TM3 of the β1 and β3 subunits. Within this region, the β1 and β3 subunits differ by only four amino acid residues (Fig. 6A). We then substituted each of these residues of the β1 subunit with the corresponding residue of the β3 subunit. Fig. 6B shows the GABA concentration-response curves for the wild type and mutant β1 receptors. The EC50 and Hill coefficient values were, respectively, 30 ± 3 μm and 1.0 ± 0.1 for T255I/L256M receptors (solid circles), 7.7 ± 6 μm and 0.7 ± 0.2 for S265N receptors (solid triangles), and 68 ± 10 μm and 0.8 ± 0.09 for the I283M receptors (solid diamonds) (Fig. 6B). Except for the S265N mutation, which did not alter the sensitivity of the receptor to GABA, the T255I/L256M and I283M mutations significantly decreased the sensitivity of the receptors to GABA by 4- and 9-fold, respectively (p < 0.01, unpaired t test, n = 5). However, of these point mutations, the S265N mutation was the only point mutation that abolished spontaneous activity of the β1 subunits (Fig. 6C), suggesting that the amino acid residue at position 265 in the β1 subunit is critical for the channel spontaneous opening. To determine whether amino acid Ser-265 of the β1 subunit is also important for the spontaneous opening of heteromeric GABAA receptor channels, we co-expressed β1 (S265N) mutant subunits with γ2 or α2 subunits. The trace records in Fig. 7A show that 100 μm PTX induced an outward current in oocytes expressing the β1γ2 subunits. However, 100 μm PTX did not induce a detectable outward current in oocytes co-expressing β1 (S265N) mutant with γ2 subunits. The S265N mutation of the β1 subunit also blocked the spontaneously opening channels produced by the α2β1 subunits expressed in Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 7B). It should be noted that the N265S mutation of the β3 subunit did not produce spontaneously active channels in cells expressing homomeric β3(N265S) subunits or co-expressing β3(N265S)γ2 subunits (data not shown).Fig. 7The S265N mutation abolishes constitutive activity of β1-containing heteromeric GABAA receptor.

To gain molecular insight into the structural/functional role of the residue at position 265, we replaced Ser-265 with multiple amino acid residues and examined the spontaneous activity of mutant β1γ2 subunits. Among seven mutant receptors, the β1(S265W)γ2 and β1(S265G)γ2 mutant receptors were constitutively active. Next, we used correlation analysis to compare the magnitude of the PTX-induced outward current with the hydropathicity (22Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16891) Google Scholar), polarity (23Zimmerman J.M. Eliezer N. Simha R. J. Theor. Biol. 1968; 21: 170-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), hydrophilicity (24Hopp T.P. Woods K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3824-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2885) Google Scholar), and molecular volume (25Zamyatnin A.A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1972; 24: 107-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) of the amino acid residues replaced at position 265. In general, there is no significant difference among these variables (Fig. 8, A, B, C, and D). However, because these receptors clearly fall into two distinct groups based on whether they open or not in the absence of agonist, we classified the receptors into two groups, those that exhibit spontaneous activity, group 1, and those that do not, group 2. For the group 1 receptors, the strongest correlation was found between the side chain molecular volume of the residues at position 265 and the extent of spontaneous channel opening (Fig. 8D; R = 0.99, p < 0.0001, nonparametric analysis). A similar scenario was observed for other spontaneously opening β1-containing heteromeric GABAA receptors (Fig. 8, E and F). In this study we have demonstrated that homomeric and heteromeric expression of rat GABAA receptors that contain the β1 subunit were constitutively active, whereas GABAA receptors that contain the β3 subunit were inactive in the absence of GABA. These observations are consistent with previous studies showing that homomeric GABAA receptor channels formed by β1 but not β3 subunits are constitutively active (7Cestari I.N. Uchida I. Li L. Burt D. Yang J. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 943-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Sigel E. Baur R. Malherbe P. Mohler H.

In addition, we found that the magnitude of spontaneous opening of homomeric β1 receptor channels was predominant as the channel spontaneous activity accounted for 88% of total extent of the opening probability. In line with previous studies (5Sigel E. Baur R. Trube G. Mohler H. Malherbe P. Neuron. 1990; 5: 703-711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 26Malherbe P. Sigel E. Baur R. Persohn E. Richards J.G. Mohler H. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we also observed spontaneously opening β1-containing heteromeric GABAA receptor channels. It is unlikely that lack of constitutive activity from rat β3 subunits was due to insensitivity of the homomeric β3 subunits to GABAA receptor antagonists since both BIC and PTX were found to completely inhibit GABA-activated inward current in oocytes expressing the homomeric β3 subunits. It has been well documented that homomeric β subunits can form functional channels that either can open spontaneously or can be directly activated by some general anesthetics (5Sigel E. Baur R.

In the central nervous system, formation of functional NMDA receptors requires the presence of at least one NR1 subunit in complex with at least one of the NR2 subunits (9Ishii T. Moriyoshi K.

As evident from developmental distribution studies, the NR1 subunit appears to be uniformly expressed throughout the brain starting early in development. In contrast, the different NR2 and NR3 subunits are strictly regulated, both developmentally and spatially (11Das S. Sasaki Y.F. Rothe T. Premkumar L.S. Takasu M. Crandall J.E. Dikkes P. Conner D.A.

While the developmental and regional distribution of NMDA receptor subunits in the central nervous system has been extensively investigated, little is known about the expression of NMDA receptor subunits in non-neuronal tissues. Recently, evidence has accumulated that glutamate receptors may also possess important functions other than synaptic transmission of neuronal impulses in extraneuronal tissues such as lung (18Said S.I. Berisha H.I. Pakbaz H. Neuroscience. 1995; 65: 943-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) or pancreas (19Inagaki N. Kuromi H. Gonoi T. Okamoto Y. Ishida H. Seino Y. Kaneko T. Iwanaga T. Seino S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we found NR2B protein to be transiently expressed in rat heart during perinatal development. Here, the NR2B polypeptide was located to sarcomeric Z-bands in both the neonatal heart ventricle and acutely dissociated cardiac myocytes. In contrast to the aorticopulmonary septum and conotruncal cushions (20Jiang X. Rowitch D.H. Soriano P. McMahon A.P. Sucov H.M. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 1607-1616PubMed Google Scholar), cells forming the NR2B expressing ventricle are not of neural crest origin. While the NR2B subunit is known to functionally depend on co-expression with the NR1 subunit, we previously failed to detect either NR1 antigen or transcripts as analyzed by Western blot and RT-PCR, respectively (21Seeber S. Becker K. Rau T. Eschenhagen T. Becker C.M. Herkert M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2472-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, an identification of potential interaction partners of the NR2B polypeptide was attempted in neonatal rat heart. By immunoprecipitation and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry, we identified the ryanodine receptor 2 as a molecular interaction partner of the cardiac NR2B protein. Generation and Use of NR2B Antibodies—Antibodies were raised in rabbits (Chinchilla Bastard) against a synthetic peptide representing the N-terminal region of subunit NR2B (439RIISENKTDEEPGYCIC454) as described before (21Seeber S.

The underlined cysteine residue was added to the C terminus for coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanine (Calbiochem, Bad Soden, Germany) or EAH-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) with the heterobifunctional cross-linker sulfosuccinimidyl-4-(N-maleinidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxalate (sulfo-SMCC; Pierce). Peptide-specific antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography on immobilized peptides to sulfo-SMCC activated EAH-Sepharose. A polyclonal anti-NR2B antibody from rabbit recognizing a C-terminal epitope consisting of 19 amino acids (positions 1436–1457) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). An N-terminal polyclonal anti-NR2B antibody directed against an epitope covering 54 amino acids (amino acids 27–76) was obtained from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Reverse Transcriptase PCR—Total RNA from heart was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Eggenstein, Germany) and random hexameric primers. Aliquots of the cDNA obtained were amplified by PCR performed in 15 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 125 μm concentration of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, and 10 pmol of each oligonucleotide given in Table I (all purchased from MWG, München, Germany).

On postnatal day 4 (P 5) and at the adult stage (P 74), heart tissue was dissected from Wistar rats and fixed by diffusion with 4% EDAC in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 30 min. After fixation, hearts were washed three times with PBS (pH 7.4) and cryopreserved in 25% sucrose in PBS (pH 7.4). Slices (7 μm) were dissected with a cryotome (MICROM, Walldorf, Germany) at -30 °C and immunostained immediately. Cardiac myocytes (CM) were cultivated as described elsewhere (24Webster K.A. Bishopric N.H. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1992; 24: 741-751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, heart tissue from P 5 rats was dissociated by trypsinization and trituration cycles, centrifuged (400 × g, 1 min), and resuspended in non-CM medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum). Non-CM cells were allowed to attach to the bottom of a 10-cm culture plate for 90 min. The CMs in the supernatant were then plated on 3-cm culture plates containing four coverslips each (coated with 50 mg/ml poly-l-lysine, 10% silane) at a density of 200,000 cells per plate. Cells were grown at 5% CO2 and 37 °C in CM medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mm bromodesoxyuridine) for 4 days. CMs were washed three times with PBS (pH 7.4) and fixed using 4% formaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for 10 min. After removal of formaldehyde, reactive carbonyl groups were blocked by 0.1 m ammoniumchloride for 10 min followed by another three washing steps with PBS (pH 7.4). For staining procedures, coverslips with fixed CMs were transferred into 24-well plates. Immunohistochemistry—Before addition of primary antibody, fixed cells and tissue slices were incubated in blocking buffer containing 10% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h. Samples were incubated with affinity-purified polyclonal NR2B antiserum (protein concentration: ∼20 μg/ml) in addition to a monoclonal antibody directed against tubuline, ryanodine receptor 2, or actinine (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany; Alexis, Cologne, Germany) in 1% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h. Following three washing steps with PBS, samples were incubated with Alexa-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse antibodies (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands) or with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) for 30 min. After an additional washing step, samples were mounted in Mowiol containing the antifading reagent DABCO™ (Sigma). Stained cells and tissue slices were analyzed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Bio-Rad, München, Germany) and a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany), respectively, and photographs were taken with a CCD camera (Hamamatsu, Shizouka, Japan). Preparation of Membrane Proteins and Immunprecipitation—For preparation of membrane proteins, heart and cerebral cortex tissue from Wistar rats (P 5 or P 74) was dissected and homogenized for 3 min in buffer HP1 (0.32 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm o-phenantroline, 2 μg/ml E64, 10 μg/ml pepstatinA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 30 μg/ml Pefabloc, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA; Sigma) using a glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged (1000 x g; 5 min), and the low speed supernatant was pelleted at 20,000 x g for 20 min. The resulting crude membrane fraction was resuspended in hypotonic buffer HP2 (HP1 without sucrose), homogenized for 30 s, and recentrifuged at 20,000 x g for 20 min. The final pellet was resuspended in HP2 at a final protein concentration of 5–10 mg/ml. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (22Herkert M. Rottger S. Becker C.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In short, membrane proteins were solubilized from crude membrane fractions by incubation with 1% Triton, 0.5% sodium desoxycholate in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) for 1 h at 30 °C followed by centrifugation at 100,000 x g for 30 min. Solubilized proteins were reacted with affinity-purified antiserum against NR2B or NR1 or a monoclonal antibody against ryanodine receptor 2 (Alexis, Cologne, Germany) (antibody concentration: ∼20 μg/ml). Antibody-coupled protein complexes were precipitated using protein A-conjugated Sepharose beads. Protein complexes were precipitated (3000 × g; 5 min), washed three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl containing 1.5 m NaCl, and resuspended in Laemmli buffer containing 2 m urea. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. SDS Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Protein concentrations were estimated by the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using BSA as a standard. Membrane preparations or immunoprecipitates were incubated (56 °C; 20 min) in Laemmli sample buffer containing 2 m urea. Proteins (50 μg of protein per lane) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gelelectrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide slab gels under reducing conditions. Proteins were visualized with SyproRuby™ protein stain or transferred onto nitrocellulose for subsequent in-gel digestion or Western blot analysis, respectively. Following SDS gelelectrophoresis, proteins were transferred on nitrocellulose using a semidry blotting apparatus (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany). Protein transfer was controlled by reversible staining with Ponceau S. Blots were blocked with 5% Blotto (PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk powder and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 1 h. Incubation with affinity-purified polyclonal antiserum K39 (10 μg/ml) or antibodies against the ryanodine receptor 2, NR1, and NR2B proteins (dilution 1:500) was carried out overnight in 0.5% Blotto at 4 °C, followed by three washing steps with PBS. Antibodies were detected by fluorescence using Cy5-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) for 30 min, followed by extensive washing with PBS. Finally, fluorescence was visualized using the Storm Fluorescense Imager (Amersham Biosciences). Peptide Mass Fingerprinting—After SDS-gel electrophoresis and SyproRuby™ staining, protein gels were visualized using UV light and bands of interest excised. Gel bands were crushed into 1 mm2 pieces and destained using 50% acetonitrile, 25 mm ammoniumhydrogencarbonate. Following complete drying in a vacuum centrifuge, gel pieces were resuspended in 50 μl of 25 mm ammonium hydrogen carbonate containing 0.2 μg/μl sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, München, Germany). After enzymatic digest at 37 °C overnight, the resulting peptide fragments were eluted from the gel by adding 5% acetic acid, 50% actonitrile and sonification (20 min; room temperature). Supernatants were collected, and elution was repeated four times. Finally, supernatants were dried completely in a vacuum centrifuge, and peptides were resuspended in 10 μl of H2O containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. For MALDI-TOF-MS, digests were diluted with H2O (1:10 to 1:50). The sample (0.5 μl) was mixed with 0.5 μl of 3-hydroxy-α-cyanocinnamic acid matrix (saturated solution in 30% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid), dotted onto a steel target, and air-dried. MALDI-TOF analysis was performed on a Biflex III (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) in the reflector mode. Desorption of the samples was carried out using a nitrogen laser (337 nm), and the probes were accelerated with 19 kV after a delay of 3500 ns. For one sample spectrum, 25–50 individual spectra of the respective probes were performed and averaged. A peptide standard mix served as an external calibration. The masses obtained by MALDI-TOF-MS were used for a peptide mass fingerprint search. Experimentally obtained masses were aligned to theoretical peptide masses for trypsin digestion of all proteins available in the NCBI data base. For this purpose, we employed the search program MS-Fit, available at prospector.ucsf.edu (26Clauser K.R. Baker P. Burlingame A.L. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2871-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Data base search settings were as follows: protein mass (apparent molecular mass of the protein in SDS-PAGE according to the molecular mass of the standard proteins), ±50 kDa of the respective cut out protein band; species, rodentia; mass tolerance, 0.05%; maximum number of missed cleavages, 1; standard modifications, none; minimum number of peptides required for match, 4; data base, NCBI Protein. Immunological Variations of NR2B Antigen in Rat Heart and Central Nervous System—During perinatal development, the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B is detectable in rat heart (21Seeber S. Becker K. Rau T. Eschenhagen T. Becker C.M. Herkert M. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2472-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) using an affinity-purified rabbit antiserum (K39) directed against an extracellular epitope formed by amino acids 439–454 that is adjacent to transmembrane region 1 (TM1) (Fig. 1A). In contrast, studies using antibodies directed against the very C-terminal part of NR2B failed to detect the corresponding antigen in rat heart at any age analyzed (27Gill S.S. Pulido O.M. Mueller R.W. McGuire P.F. Brain Res. Bull. 1998; 46: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 28Gill S.S. Pulido O.M. Toxicol. Pathol. 2001; 29: 208-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 29Leung J.C. Travis B.R. Verlander J.W. Sandhu S.K. Yang S.G. Zea A.H. Weiner I.D. Silverstein D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: R964-R971Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To elucidate these apparently contradictory reports, we employed three antibodies defining distinct epitopes of NR2B. In Western blot analysis, affinity-purified antiserum K39 stained a 180-kDa protein present in both heart and cerebral cortex tissue. In the immunostains from central nervous tissue, a microheterogeneity of the NR2B antigen was observed. An identical result was reproducibly obtained in with an antibody directed against an epitope formed by amino acids 27–76 that is situated within the N-terminal extracellular domain of NR2B. In contrast, an antibody against the C-terminal part of NR2B detected this antigen in cerebral cortex but not in heart (Fig. 1B). To corroborate these results, we performed peptide mass fingerprinting of a K39 immunoprecipitate of the 180-kDa antigen from rat heart. Following SDS electrophoresis and in-gel digest, an informative peptide fragment pattern was obtained and subjected to a data bank search. Indeed, the NR2B polypeptide turned out to be the most probable candidate (compare Table II). Thus, by showing immunoreactivity with two anti-NR2B antibodies with different specificities, directed against distinct epitopes situated at the very N terminus and an extracellular pre-TM1 segment of NR2B (Fig. 1A), and the peptide mass fingerprint of the 180-kDa immunoband from heart, the expression of NR2B in juvenile rat heart could be proven unambiguously. To exclude alternative splicing to underlie the differences in antibody binding, RT-PCRs of overlapping fragments comprising the entire coding region of the NR2B transcript were performed. Sizes of the DNA fragments obtained were as predicted by gene bank data (see Fig. 1C and Table I), and partial sequencing of these fragments revealed no obvious sequence heterogeneity, regardless of their origin from either heart or central nervous system (data not shown). Thus, no evidence was obtained for transcript variability affecting the C terminus of the NR2B subunit.Table IIPeptide mass fingerprints of proteins precipitated from neonatal heart by anti NR2B antiserum K39 Left column lists the protein band excised from SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4B).

As a marker of filamentous actin, TRITC-conjugated phalloidin was used to determine the type of cells stained. In agreement with our previous results, tissue slices of P 5 rat yielded intense NR2B signals (Fig. 2, B and D). The striated pattern generated by phalloidin staining clearly identified the anti-NR2B reactive cells as cardiac myocytes (Fig. 2A). After preincubation of the antiserum with antigenic peptide, the NR2B signals were completely abolished (Fig. 2C). In contrast to slices from P 5 rat heart, adult heart did not produce any signal above background levels (Fig. 2F). The NR2B signal obtained with P 5 slices followed a well defined intracellular striated pattern (Fig. 2D). The subcellular distribution of NR2B antigen was investigated more closely in cultured cardiac myocytes. Single cells were prepared from ventricles of P 5 rats, fixed after 36 h in culture, and double-stained with affinity-purified anti-NR2B antiserum and monoclonal antibodies against cytoskeletal proteins. As analyzed by confocal microscopy, all myocytes showed significant immunosignals for NR2B. In addition to a weak intracellular reticular staining pattern, an intense accumulation of antigen was observed at distinct sarcomeric bands (Fig. 3, A, D, and G). By immunological co-localization with α-actinin, a protein forming the Z-bands, these structures could be confirmed to represent the Z-bands (Fig. 3C). We also found a less defined co-distribution of NR2B antigen with filamentous actin (Fig. 3F). In contrast, the reticular staining pattern of tubulin and the striated pattern of NR2B antigen was clearly distinct and did not overlap (Fig. 3I).Fig. 3Subcellular localization of NR2B antigen in acutely dissociated cardiac myocytes. Cardiac myocytes were double-stained with anti-NR2B antiserum and antibodies against typical structural proteins of cardiac myocytes. NR2B antigen appeared intracellularly, accumulating at distinct bands within the cells (A, D, G; arrows). A–C, double staining of NR2B (A) with actinin (B) antibody revealed clear co-localization, thereby indicating an accumulation of NR2B antigen at the sarcomeric Z-bands (C; arrows). D–F, double staining of NR2B (D) with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin (E). Staining patterns for both proteins, NR2B and actin, showed related distributions accumulating at the sarcomeric Z-band (F; arrows). G–I, double staining NR2B (G) with tubulin (H). Tubulin showed a reticular distribution throughout the cell (H); NR2B and tubulin staining patterns were mutually exclusive (I).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Different Molecular Interaction Partners of NR2B in Cerebral Cortex and Heart—To identify proteins interacting with the cardiac NR2B polypeptide, detergent extracts from membranes from heart and cerebral cortex were subjected to immunoprecipitation using affinity-purified anti-NR2B antiserum. The protein complexes precipitated were separated on SDS gels, stained with SyproRuby™, and visualized under UV light. In particular in the higher molecular mass range, we found significant differences in the composition of protein complexes precipitated from either from heart or from central nervous system preparations.

https://openalex.org/W2066611444,"The tyrosinase (Tyr) gene encodes the enzyme tyrosinase that catalyses the conversion of L-tyrosine into DOPA (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine)-quinone. The albino mutation abrogates functional activity of tyrosinase resulting in deficiency of melanin pigment production in skin and retina. Tyr maps to a region in the central position of Chromosome 7 that contains a skin tumor-modifier locus. We rescued the albino mutation in transgenic mice to assess a possible role of Tyr gene in two-stage skin carcinogenesis. Transgenic expression of the functional Tyr(Cys) allele in albino mice (Tyr(Ser)) caused a reduction in skin papilloma multiplicity, in four independent experiments and at three dose levels of DMBA (9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene). In vitro mechanistic studies demonstrated that transfection of the Tyr(Cys) allele in a human squamous cell carcinoma cell line (NCI-H520) increases tyrosinase enzyme activity and confers resistance to hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative DNA damage. These results provide direct evidence that the Tyr gene can act as a skin cancer-modifier gene, whose mechanism of action may involve modulation of oxidative DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2047078030,"The BTB/POZ transcriptional repressor HIC1 (Hypermethylated in Cancer 1) is a tumor suppressor gene located at chromosome 17p13.3, a region frequently hypermethylated or deleted in human tumors and in a contiguous-gene syndrome, the Miller-Dieker syndrome. The human and murine HIC1 genes are composed of two alternative 5' exons, 1a and 1b fused to a large second coding exon 2. Exon 1a is a noncoding exon associated with a major G-C-rich promoter whereas exon 1b is a downstream coding exon associated with a minor TATA box promoter. By human-mouse genome comparison, we have identified a short upstream conserved sequence containing G-C boxes which were shown to be functional. Transcripts initiating from this new promoter were detected in various human and mouse tissues and contained a long 5'-UTR sequence, called 1c which encompass the G-C-rich promoter associated with exon 1a and uses the same splice donor site. RT-PCR analyses of two primary breast epithelial cell lines identified two other 5'-UTRs generated by alternative splicing within exon 1c. Our results thus highlight the existence of an unexpected complex transcriptional regulation of HIC1."
https://openalex.org/W2028526717,"The rate of transcription of Escherichia coli ribosomal RNA promoters is central to adjusting the cellular growth rate to nutritional conditions. The +1 initiating nucleotide and ppGpp are regulatory effectors of these promoters. The data herein show that in vitro transcription is also regulated by the +2 nucleotide. Both the +1 and +2 nucleotides act by driving polymerase into an altered conformation rather than by increasing the lifetime of transcription complexes. The unique design of the ribosomal promoters may stabilize a distorted state of polymerase that is relieved by the binding of the two nucleotides required for transcription initiation. The rate of transcription of Escherichia coli ribosomal RNA promoters is central to adjusting the cellular growth rate to nutritional conditions. The +1 initiating nucleotide and ppGpp are regulatory effectors of these promoters. The data herein show that in vitro transcription is also regulated by the +2 nucleotide. Both the +1 and +2 nucleotides act by driving polymerase into an altered conformation rather than by increasing the lifetime of transcription complexes. The unique design of the ribosomal promoters may stabilize a distorted state of polymerase that is relieved by the binding of the two nucleotides required for transcription initiation. Transcription of ribosomal RNA is the limiting step in ribosome production (1Nomura M. Gourse R. Baughman G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 75-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). The ribosomal promoters sense the overall availability of nutrients and respond by producing amounts of rRNA that can support the maximal growth possible given the nutritional environment. Nucleotides have been shown to be critical effectors of this promoter response. The signal nucleotide ppGpp is produced in inverse concentration to growth rate, and this may help keep the rate of rRNA transcription at an appropriate level (2Reiness G. Yang H.L. Zubay G. Cashel M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2881-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 3Murray H.D. Schneider D.A. Gourse R.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The ribosomal promoters are also unusually sensitive to the concentration of the initiating nucleotide (4Gaal T. Bartlett M.S. Ross W. Turnbough Jr., C.L. Gourse R.L. Science. 1997; 278: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 5Jores L. Wagner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16834-16843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). During transitions to slow growth, the nucleotide concentration can be depressed, and this prevents unnecessary transcription of ribosomal components (3Murray H.D. Schneider D.A. Gourse R.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).The mechanism by which nucleotides affect transcription from ribosomal promoters has received a great deal of attention. In the case of the initiating nucleotide, it was proposed that it works by stabilizing polymerase-promoter DNA complexes (4Gaal T. Bartlett M.S. Ross W. Turnbough Jr., C.L. Gourse R.L. Science. 1997; 278: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). This effect is thought to be specific to the ribosomal promoters because their complexes have short half-lives and are therefore uniquely unstable. ppGpp also reduces the complex half-life (6Barker M.M. Gaal T. Josaitis C.A. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 673-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and competes with the initiating nucleotide (5Jores L. Wagner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16834-16843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).There are uncertainties associated with this mechanism of nucleotide control of ribosomal transcription. In order for the short lifetime of ribosomal complexes to reduce transcription, dissociation would need to occur before the first RNA bond is formed, but this is typically quite rapid (7Mangel W.F. Chamberlin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2995-3001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Gralla J.D. Carpousis A.J. Stefano J.E.

How these unstable complexes are uniquely stabilized by the +1 nucleotide is not known. In addition, recent experiments in other transcription systems have shown that the +2 nucleotide can also have stimulatory effects. This occurs during initiation by the viral T7 RNA polymerase (11Stano N.M. Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37292-37300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and during elongation by the Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (12Holmes S.F. Erie D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35597-35608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Nucleotides that do not match the +1 position on the template can stimulate the isomerization of E. coli RNA polymerase in complexes with fork-junction DNA. 1C. M. Lew and J. D. Gralla, manuscript in preparation. 1C. M. Lew and J. D. Gralla, manuscript in preparation. The structure of such complexes is known (13Murakami K.S. Masuda S. Campbell E.A. Muzzin O. Darst S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1285-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) and gives no obvious clue as to how this stabilization by nucleotides could occur.For these reasons we have re-evaluated the role of nucleotides as effectors of ribosomal transcription. The new data show that both the +1 and +2 nucleotides can act as effectors, unifying the properties of the bacterial and viral RNA polymerases. In these experiments, the nucleotides did not work by stabilizing transcription complexes but rather by causing a greater number of functional complexes to form. These effects can be rationalized in terms of the ribosomal promoter DNA sequence imposing a distorted conformation on RNA polymerase, which can be corrected by nucleotide binding.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and Proteins—E. coli holoenzyme was purchased from Epicentre. Plasmid rrnB P1-pTH8 is a derivative of pTH8 (14Hunt T.P. Magasanik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8453-8457Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) with the rrnB P1 promoter replacing the glnA promoter. rrnB P1-pTH8 was constructed as follows: complementary rrnB P1 promoter oligonucleotides from –61 to +15 with 5′-BamHI and 3′-HindIII sites (Qiagen) were phosphorylated, annealed, and inserted into digested pTH8. Plasmid rrnB P1(+2G)-pTH8 was created by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The pTH8-UV5 plasmid was as described previously (15Fenton M.S. Gralla J.D. J. Biol.

Science. 1997; 278: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) with 40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, 170 mm KCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 50 nm E. coli RNA polymerase at 37 °C for 5 min. For nucleotide titration experiments, the nontitrated NTPs were at 200 μm with 25 μm [α-32P]UTP at 0.1 μCi/μl. Transcription was for 10 min at 37 °C.In NTP stabilization experiments, 2 mm specified NTP was preincubated with the transcription complex for 5 min at 37 °C. For heparin challenge experiments, 100 μg/ml heparin was added to the transcription complex for 3 min at room temperature prior to the addition of the transcription nucleotide mix. A nucleotide mix of 200 μm ATP, 200 μm CTP, 200 μm GTP, and 25 μm [α-32P]UTP at 0.1 μCi/μl final concentration was then added for 10 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 10 μl. In the half-life experiment, a scaled-up reaction with 2 nm holoenzyme was incubated with 1 nm pTH8-rrnB P1 in Buffer A for 5 min at 37 °C. 20 nm BamHIII-cut pTH8-rrnB P1 competitor was then added. An aliquot was removed and added to a nucleotide mix as indicated above at various time intervals. Transcription was allowed to proceed for 10 min at 37 °C. A control was run to obtain the background transcription with BamHIII-cut pTH8-rrnB P1, and this background was subtracted from the signal. In the control, 2 nm holoenzyme was preincubated with 20 nm BamHIII-cut pTH8-rrnB P1 for 5 min at 37 °C, and then 1 nm uncut pTH8-rrnB P1 was added and transcription proceeded for 10 min at 37 °C. The controls for reactions with the nucleotide used for the preincubation contained 2 mm of the indicated nucleotide in the incubation with holoenzyme-BamHIII-cut pTH8-rrnB P1. A formamide-urea dye mix was added to stop the reaction, and this was loaded onto a 6% urea gel. Bands were analyzed by a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSHigh Concentration of Both the +1 and +2 Nucleotides Are Required at the rrnB P1 Promoter—A key property of the rrnB P1 promoter and its variants is that it transcribes poorly when the concentration of the +1 initiating nucleoside triphosphate is low. Experiments indicated that nucleotide positions downstream from +1 do not induce this property (4Gaal T. Bartlett M.S. Ross W. Turnbough Jr., C.L. Gourse R.L. Science. 1997; 278: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). We repeated these experiments under different conditions, namely substituting 37 °C for lower temperature and using a template that contained the natural upstream sequence that enhances transcription (the “UP” element) (18Ross W. Gosink K.K. Salomon J. Igarashi K. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 19Strainic Jr., M.G. Sullivan J.J. Velevis A. deHaseth P.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 18074-18080Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The experiment involved titrating the concentration of a single NTP, leaving the concentrations of the other 3 NTPs constant and fixed. The ribosomal promoter (rrnB P1) RNA sequence has an A at position +1 and a C at position +2 (Fig. 1, top). The transcripts obtained in the experiments, where +1 ATP or +2 CTP were titrated up to 200 μm, are shown in the middle panel of Fig. 1. The data were normalized to the amount of transcription at 200 μm CTP and plotted in the form of a titration in the bottom panel of Fig. 1.Under these conditions, rrnB P1 transcription required a higher concentration of both the +1 ATP and +2 CTP. The data for the +1 position replicated that obtained previously under different conditions (4Gaal T. Bartlett M.S. Ross W. Turnbough Jr., C.L. Gourse R.L. Science. 1997; 278: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The +2 effect had not been seen previously. The ATP and CTP curves are indistinguishable, indicating that the effect can be induced by either of the two nucleotides, which must bind polymerase and be condensed upon initiation. No similar effect was seen with GTP, which served as a control for a noninitiating nucleotide at this promoter. As the concentration of initiating nucleotides was increased beyond 200 μm, transcription continued to increase (data not shown and see below).Because the +2 effect had not been seen previously, we repeated the type of experiment that previously supported the role of the +1 nucleotide (4Gaal T. Bartlett M.S. Ross W. Turnbough Jr., C.L. Gourse R.L. Science. 1997; 278: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The +2 nucleotide was changed from C to G, and the experiment was repeated. The RNA sequence then had a +2 G, and the +1 A and all other nucleotides were left unchanged. The data (Fig. 2) show that the mutant promoter has a high concentration requirement for ATP and GTP, corresponding to its +1 and +2 positions. CTP, which behaved in this manner on the wild type promoter with a +2 C, no longer did so when +2 was changed to G. The magnitude of the effect was slightly reduced in the mutant, but the switch in specificity was clear. We concluded that both the +1 and +2 nucleotides have a higher concentration requirement at the rrnB P1 promoter.Fig. 2When the +2 nucleotide is mutated to a G, higher concentrations of the new +2 nucleotide are needed. Titration is the same as for Fig. 1, but the +2 now specifies a G. ATP (diamond), GTP (square), and CTP (triangle).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The +1 or +2 NTP Can Activate Heparin-resistant Complexes—Previous experiments under lower ionic strength conditions have shown that, in the absence of initiating nucleotides, RNA polymerase binds the rrnB P1 promoter in a stable closed complex (20Ohlsen K.L. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19813-19818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Ohlsen K.L. Gralla J.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2243-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Under similar conditions, preincubation with the +1 (but not the +2) nucleotide induce more complexes to survive dissociation in a heparin challenge protocol (4Gaal T. Bartlett M.S. Ross W. Turnbough Jr., C.L. Gourse R.L. Science. 1997; 278: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In view of the additional effect of +2 CTP in the above experiments, we reassessed the role of the +1 and +2 NTP under these experimental conditions.Fig. 3A shows the results of an experiment evaluating the effects of the +1 or +2 NTP in forming heparin-resistant complexes. In these experiments, each NTP was preincubated with the transcription complex, and then heparin was added for 3 min. At that point, transcription was initiated by adding the remaining NTPs. The data show that preincubation with either +1 ATP (Fig. 3A, lane 2 versus lane 1) or +2 CTP (lane 3 versus lane 1) increased transcription but that +4 GTP had no effect (lane 4 versus lane 1). This is consistent with the specific need for high concentrations of the +1 ATP and +2 CTP in the titration experiments (Fig. 1). The effect of +1 (reported previously in Ref. 4Gaal T. Bartlett M.S. Ross W. Turnbough Jr., C.L. Gourse R.L. Science. 1997; 278: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) is greater than that of +2, which is clear but smaller.Fig. 3+1 and +2 nucleotide stimulate heparin resistant transcription. A, holoenzyme bound to the rrnB P1 promoter preincubated with none, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm CTP, or 2 mm GTP prior to the addition of heparin. The remaining nucleotides were added to initiate transcription 3 min after the addition of heparin. B, same as A but with heparin added prior to any nucleotide. C, transcription with (lanes 1 and 3) and without heparin (lanes 2 and 4) for each promoter. Heparin was added to holoenzyme prior to the plasmid DNA in this case. D, same as in A but with HindIII-cut pTH8-rrnB P1 as the competitor instead of heparin, and 300 μm ppGpp inhibitor was added with the remaining nucleotides to initiate transcription.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Other experiments indicated that preincubation is not required to achieve the stimulatory effect of the nucleotide. Fig. 3B shows that, if either the +1 or +2 NTP is added after heparin, the results are unchanged from those described above. That is, there was still a specific stimulation (Fig. 3B, panel B is similar to panel A). In control experiments, the heparin was found to inactivate ∼85% of the complexes if added directly to the polymerase prior to DNA (at the lac UV5 promoter, the effectiveness was greater than 95%, Fig. 3C). The results suggest that an initiating NTP can convert a poorly transcribing transcription complex to a better transcribing one, even in the presence of heparin.It was reported previously that preincubation with the +1 NTP increases transcription by stabilizing an intrinsically unstable transcription complex as assessed in a heparin challenge assay (4Gaal T. Bartlett M.S. Ross W. Turnbough Jr., C.L. Gourse R.L. Science. 1997; 278: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The incomplete effect of heparin on inactivation at high ionic strength made this assay somewhat problematic. The prior heparin challenge assay used to determine complex lifetime was done using a lower KCl concentration (30 mm instead of 170 mm) (4Gaal T. Bartlett M.S. Ross W. Turnbough Jr., C.L. Gourse R.L. Science. 1997; 278: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), and we were able to reproduce the sensitivity to heparin under these low salt conditions (data not shown). We also found that the specificity of initiation was weak under these conditions, consistent with prior reports on general salt effects (22Dausse J.P. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 57: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To bypass these potentially complicating factors, we developed a modified assay to assess the lifetime of rrnB P1 promoter complexes at higher ionic strength, where NTP effects on transcription have been demonstrated (see above and Ref. 4Gaal T. Bartlett M.S. Ross W. Turnbough Jr., C.L. Gourse R.L. Science. 1997; 278: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar).High Concentrations of the +1 and +2 NTPs Do Not Significantly Stabilize Polymerase at the rrnB P1 Promoter—To measure the lifetime of RNA polymerase bound to the rrnB P1 promoter, we established a system wherein RNA polymerase does not efficiently reinitiate transcription from the template to which it is initially bound. In this system, RNA polymerase is prebound to the usual supercoiled template. A large quantity of competitor DNA was used, which was of the same template, except that it was cleaved prior to the usual transcription termination site so that its transcripts would be shorter and more distinguishable. Titration determined the amount of competitor that bound nearly all of the polymerase released after transcribing the original template. The small amount of reinitiated transcripts constituted a small background, which was corrected in the analysis. Under these conditions, polymerase initiated from the original template but could not rebind because of the large quantity of nearly identical promoter DNA, which acts as the competitor.The response to the nucleotide was not changed under these conditions (data not shown). The effect of the nucleotide on inhibition by ppGpp was also tested using this competitor (Fig. 3D). ppGpp inhibited transcription 3-fold in the absence of nucleotide and only slightly less in the presence of the +1 or +2 NTP. The use of a DNA competitor did not appear to alter the regulatory properties of the promoter.To measure the half-life of polymerase bound to the rrnB P1 promoter, complexes were assembled in the absence of NTPs, and competitor DNA was then added. At various subsequent times, aliquots were removed and NTPs were added to allow those complexes that had not dissociated to initiate transcripts. The amount of RNA at each time, corresponding to the number of functional complexes, was measured. The dissociation curve, which is plotted as the appropriate semilog plot, is shown in Fig. 4A. The half-life of the complexes under the experimental conditions used here is 3–4 min, only slightly longer than that seen using the lower KCl conditions and heparin as a competitor (4Gaal T. Bartlett M.S. Ross W. Turnbough Jr., C.L. Gourse R.L. Science. 1997; 278: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar).Fig. 4Initiating NTPs have little effect on the lifetime of promoter complexes. Top, schematic of the reaction. Transcription complexes were formed, and competitor DNA was added. At subsequent times, transcription was initiated. The plots are of the log of the fraction of complexes remaining at these times. A, the complex was not preincubated with any nucleotide. The half-life is 3 min. B, the complex was preincubated with 2 mm ATP. The half-life is 3.1 min. C, the complex was preincubated with 2 mm CTP. The half-life is 4 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)When the experiment was repeated using transcription complexes, which had been preincubated with either the +1 ATP (Fig. 4B) or the +2 CTP (Fig. 4C), no significant change in the lifetime was seen. These lifetimes were much shorter than those obtained after the first bond formation (Ref. 6Barker M.M. Gaal T. Josaitis C.A. Gourse R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 673-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar and data not shown), ruling out the effects of NTP contamination in these experiments. In all three cases, the lifetime is 3–4 min (see legend to Fig. 4). It is important to note that these results were obtained under the same experimental conditions as described above, where preincubation with these nucleotides stimulated transcription. We infer that the cause of nucleotide-dependent stimulation of transcription is not stabilization of polymerase at the promoter. Instead, the nucleotide must change some other property of the polymerase.DISCUSSIONThese experiments have addressed how the rrnB P1 ribosomal promoter is stimulated by the nucleotide, an effect thought to be central to regulation during growth phase transitions, where NTP concentrations change (3Murray H.D. Schneider D.A. Gourse R.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The main new result was that this stimulation is associated with both the +1 and +2 initiating nucleotides. The effect was previously thought to be specific for +1 NTP (4Gaal T. Bartlett M.S. Ross W. Turnbough Jr., C.L. Gourse R.L. Science. 1997; 278: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Although the stimulation by +2 was not anticipated, it helps unify our understanding of nucleotide effects; the +2 NTP was previously shown to be an effector of elongation by E. coli RNA polymerase (12Holmes S.F. Erie D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35597-35608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and of initiation by T7 RNA polymerase (11Stano N.M. Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37292-37300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Under “Discussion,” we place these results in context and suggest why ribosomal promoters are uniquely built to require higher concentrations of initiating nucleotides.How Do the +1 and +2 NTPs Assist Ribosomal Transcription?—The data show that rrnB P1 transcription is dependent on high concentrations of the +1 and +2 NTPs, using two different protocols. First, low concentrations of an NTP corresponding to either the +1 and +2 RNA position led to low transcription (Fig. 1); low concentration of an NTP incorporated at a downstream position did not lower transcription (Fig. 1). This experiment differed from a prior one, which showed only a +1 dependence (4Gaal T. Bartlett M.S. Ross W. Turnbough Jr., C.L. Gourse R.L. Science. 1997; 278: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) using a higher temperature (37 °C) and using a promoter that contained the natural upstream sequence containing the UP element described previously under “Results.” Second, when rrnB P1-polymerase complexes were preincubated with either the +1 or +2 NTPs, transcription was increased in a heparin challenge protocol. Taken together, the data show that transcription depends on the independent binding of the two nucleotides needed to form the first RNA bond.The stimulation by the +1 NTP has been suggested to be related to stabilizing the short-lived heparin-resistant complexes that form at ribosomal promoters (4Gaal T. Bartlett M.S. Ross W. Turnbough Jr., C.L. Gourse R.L. Science. 1997; 278: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). When we measured stability under conditions used here for transcription, the half-life was indeed short (3–4 min), but neither the +1 nor the +2 NTP lengthened it substantially. It is possible that the short half-lives are a consequence of unusual features of the transcription complex but are not the basis for stimulation by the +1 and +2 NTPs.Instead, the +1 and +2 nucleotides appeared to increase the ability of bound RNA polymerase to transcribe. Fig. 3B shows that the +1 or +2 NTP can increase transcription even after heparin was added to the transcription complexes under these conditions (4Gaal T. Bartlett M.S. Ross W. Turnbough Jr., C.L. Gourse R.L. Science. 1997; 278: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). This indicates that the NTPs can convert inactive complexes to active ones. The conformation of polymerase at the rrnB P1 promoter appears to be distorted from that of a normal preinitiation complex, because NTPs have an abnormally high Km (Fig. 1 and reported previously for the +1 NTP) (4Gaal T. Bartlett M.S. Ross W. Turnbough Jr., C.L. Gourse R.L. Science. 1997; 278: 2092-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), indicating that their binding sites are hindered or malformed. Thus, high concentrations of initiating NTPs are needed to fill these sites, but once bound, should induce restoration of the site configuration and activate the polymerase. The specific requirement for the +1 or +2 NTP is likely a consequence of the unique existence of these two sites in the preinitiation complex. rrnB P1 transcription needs high concentrations of these NTPs because its complexes, which contain these sites, may be distorted compared with the usual state at nonribosomal promoters.A Model for the Unique Role of Nucleotides at Ribosomal Promoters—Even nonribosomal promoters have a slightly increased Km for binding the +1 and +2 NTPs compared with those used in elongation (9Nierman W.C. Chamberlin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7921-7926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Somehow this effect is exaggerated at ribosomal promoters to the extent that it allows the promoters to be regulated when NTP concentrations drop. Several features of the promoter are known to contribute to this effect (23Barker M.M. Gourse R.L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6315-6323Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). One prominent feature is the uniquely short spacer length of ribosomal promoters, which is central to control by both the initiating nucleotide (23Barker M.M. Gourse R.L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6315-6323Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and growth rate regulation (24Dickson R.R. Gaal T. deBoer H.A. deHaseth P.L. Gourse R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4862-4870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The short spacer is interesting in several regards. It should distort the transcription complex, because a suboptimal-length spacer DNA cannot be accommodated without either the DNA changing its twist or the polymerase distorting to match the improperly presented –10 and –35 regions (25Stefano J.E. Gralla J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Region 3 of σ senses the spacer length (26Dombroski A.J. Johnson B.D. Lonetto M. Gross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8858-8862Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and would likely be distorted at the ribosomal promoters. Two lines of evidence indicate that a region 3.2 distortion could be associated with creating a requirement for high concentrations of initiating NTPs. First, mutations and a truncation that includes region 3.2 lead to a decrease in abortive transcription (27Cashel M. Hsu L.M. Hernandez V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5539-5547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 28Campbell E.A. Muzzin O. Chlenov M. Sun J.L. Olson C.A. Weinman O. Trester-Zedlitz M.L. Darst S.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 527-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), which can be compensated for by higher concentrations of initiating nucleotides (28Campbell E.A. Muzzin O. Chlenov M. Sun J.L. Olson C.A. Weinman O. Trester-Zedlitz M.L. Darst S.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 527-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Second, region 3.2 is close to an NTP binding site, as demonstrated by its ability to cross-link to a bound ATP (29Severinov K. Fenyo D. Severinova E. Mustaev A. Chait B.T. Goldfarb A. Darst S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20826-20828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the unique short spacer of the ribosomal promoters may cause region 3.2 to occlude the nearby NTP binding sites. This can be corrected by driving the binding with high concentrations of the initiating NTP.Although the short spacer is a hallmark of ribosomal promoters and contributes to its regulation, another unusual feature is a long stretch of DNA between the downstream promoter element and the start site. The discriminator for ppGpp control is found here, and mutations (23Barker M.M. Gourse R.L. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6315-6323Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) in this region result in a general loss of regulation. This long distance may increase the distortion of the complex. The manner of accommodation of the unusually large DNA segment could be affected by the sequence elements in the single-stranded DNA. Taken together, these features could be associated with distortions"

For the K244A and K244N mutant enzymes, the aspartate concentration required to achieve half-maximal specific activity was reduced to 8.4 and 4.0 mm, respectively, as compared with 12.4 mm for the wild-type enzyme. Both mutant enzymes exhibited dramatic reductions in homotropic cooperativity and the ability of the heterotropic effectors to modulate activity. Small angle x-ray scattering studies showed that the unligated structure of the mutant enzymes, and the structure of the mutant enzymes ligated with N-phosphonacetyl-l-aspartate, were similar to that observed for the unligated and N-phosphonacetyl-l-aspartateligated wild-type enzyme. A saturating concentration of carbamoyl phosphate alone has little influence on the small angle x-ray scattering of the wild-type enzyme. However, carbamoyl phosphate was able to shift the structure of the two mutant enzymes dramatically toward R, establishing that the mutations had destabilized the T state of the enzyme. The x-ray crystal structure of K244N enzyme showed that numerous local T state stabilizing interactions involving 240s loop residues were lost. Furthermore, the structure established that the mutation induced additional alterations at the subunit interfaces, the active site, the relative position of the domains of the catalytic chains, and the allosteric domain of the regulatory chains. Most of these changes reflect motions toward the R state structure. However, the K244N mutation alone only changes local conformations of the enzyme to an R-like structure, without triggering the quaternary structural transition. These results suggest that loss of cooperativity and reduction in heterotropic effects is due to the dramatic destabilization of the T state of the enzyme by this mutation in the 240s loop of the catalytic chain.

Regulation of metabolic pathways via enzymes whose activity is dependent upon the concentration of various metabolites is of paramount importance for all living systems. As a response to a change in the concentration of certain metabolites, a regulatory enzyme can alter its catalytic activity thereby regulating the flux of metabolic intermediates. In particular, a change in function (such as the affinity for substrate) necessarily mandates a change in structure (1Koshland D.E. Nemethy G. Filmer D. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 365-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (2206) Google Scholar). One excellent example of a regulatory enzyme in which there are dramatic functional and structural changes dependent upon the concentrations of substrates and allosteric effectors is Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase. Aspartate transcarbamoylase (EC 2.1.3.2) catalyzes the first reaction in pyrimidine biosynthesis, the reaction between carbamoyl phosphate and l-aspartate to form N-carbamoyl-l-aspartate and inorganic phosphate. The enzyme shows homotropic cooperativity for the substrate l-aspartate (2Gerhart J.C. Schachman H.K. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 538-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Its activity is inhibited heterotropically by CTP (3Yates R.A. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 221: 757-770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by UTP in the presence of CTP (4Wild J.R. Loughrey-Chen S.J. Corder T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and activated heterotropically by ATP (5Bethell M.R. Smith K.E. White J.S.

Biol. 1963; 28: 491-496Crossref Google Scholar), the product of the parallel purine biosynthetic pathway. The holoenzyme consists of two trimeric catalytic subunits (Mr 34,000/chain) and three dimeric regulatory subunits (Mr 17,000/chain). Each of the catalytic subunits contains three active sites shared across the interface between two adjacent catalytic chains (8Krause K.L. Voltz K.W. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1643-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 9Robey E.A. Schachman H.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit catalyzes the reaction, whereas the regulatory subunit binds the allosteric effectors and is catalytically inactive (10Gerhart J.C. Schachman H.K. Biochemistry. 1965; 4: 1054-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). When substrates or suitable substrate analogues bind, the enzyme undergoes a transition from a low-activity low affinity conformation (T state) to a high activity high affinity conformation (R state). During the allosteric transition, the two catalytic subunits separate by 11 Å along the 3-fold axis (vertical expansion) and rotate ∼15° about the 3-fold axis, while the three regulatory subunits rotate ∼15° about their respective 2-fold axes. In addition, the two folding domains of each catalytic chain, the CP 1The abbreviations used are: CP domain, carbamoyl phosphate binding domain of the catalytic chain; c, catalytic chain; r, regulatory chain; ASP domain, aspartate binding domain of the catalytic chain; AL domain, allosteric domain of the regulatory chain; ZN domain, zinc domain of the regulatory chain; SAXS, small angle X-ray scattering; PEG, polyethylene glycol; r.m.s., root mean square; PALA, N-(phosphonoacetyl)-l-aspartate; PDB, Protein Data Bank. and ASP domains, close about the substrates to form the catalytically competent active site, and several subunit interfaces are restructured (11Lipscomb W.N. Adv. Enzymol. 1994; 68: 67-151PubMed Google Scholar). An important functional consequence of this structural reorganization is to increase the affinity of the enzyme for aspartate and to significantly enhance catalytic activity. Although most of the structural rearrangements can be described by rigid body rotations and translations of the two domains of the catalytic chain, the loop composed of residues 73–88 in the CP domain (80′s loop) and residues 230–245 in the ASP domain (240s loop) undergo dramatic conformational changes in the T to R transition that cannot be explained as rigid body domain motions. When the 240s loop reorients it moves toward the CP domain helping to create the high activity high affinity active site (12Ladjimi M.M. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The position of the 240s loop in the T and R states are stabilized by a series of salt links and hydrogen bonds. In the T state, these interactions seem to not only position the 240s loop, but also stabilize the compact T structure. When some of these interactions have been disrupted, by amino acid substitution, the T state is destabilized relative to the R state (12Ladjimi M.M. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13Middleton S.A. Kantrowitz E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The exact position of the 240s loop has been difficult to discern because of relatively weak electron density in this portion of the structure (17Kim K.H. Pan Z. Honzatko R.B. Ke H.-M. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 853-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 18Ke H.-M. Honzatko R.B. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In a mutant structure more recently determined (20Williams M.K. Stec B. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the quality of the electron density map of the 240s loop was sufficiently high to allow for the conformation of the loop to be more firmly established, including the presence of a short segment of well defined 310 helix at the end of the fragment. In addition, this revised conformation of the 240s loop shows a salt link between Lys-244 and Asp-271 that previously had not been observed. Here, we investigate the role of this interaction for the stabilization of the T state of aspartate transcarbamoylase by site-specific mutagenesis, kinetics, small angle x-ray scattering, and x-ray crystallography.

DNA primers were designed to insert the mutations in both the forward and reverse directions. Site-specific mutagenesis was performed using plasmid pEK152 (21Baker D.P. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10150-10158Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) as the template DNA. Candidates were screened for the mutation by DNA sequence analysis. Once candidates were identified, the entire pyrB gene was sequenced to verify that the only mutation was at the 244 codon. The final plasmids with the K244N and K244A mutations were identified as pEK582 and pEK584 respectively. Enzyme Overexpression and Purification—Plasmids pEK152, pEK582, and pEK584 for the wild-type, K244N, and K244A enzymes, respectively, were transformed into the E. coli strain EK1104 for expression and purification as previously described (22Nowlan S.F. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14712-14716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme purity was judged both by native PAGE (23Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 680-685Google Scholar, 24Ornstein L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 321-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar); as well as by SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207479) Google Scholar) stained with Coomassie Blue. Protein Determination—The concentration of pure wild-type enzyme was determined by absorbance measurements at 280 nm with an extinction coefficient of 0.59 cm2·mg-1 (26Gerhart J.C. Holoubek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2886-2892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration of the mutant enzymes was determined by the Bio-Rad version of the Bradford's dye binding assay using the wild-type enzyme as standard (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217390) Google Scholar). Aspartate Transcarbamoylase Assay—The activity of the enzyme was measured at 25 °C by the colorimetric method (28Pastra-Landis S.C. Foote J. Kantrowitz E.R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Saturation kinetics was performed in duplicate, and data points shown are the average values. Assays were performed in 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.3 in the presence of a saturating concentration of carbamoyl phosphate (4.8 mm). Analysis of the steady-state kinetics data was carried out as previously described (29Silver R.S. Daigneault J.P. Teague P.D. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 168: 729-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Fitting of the experimental data to theoretical equations was achieved by non-linear regression. When substrate inhibition was significant, data were analyzed using an extension of the Hill equation (30Pastra-Landis S.C. Evans D.R. Lipscomb W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4624-4630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotide saturation curves were fit to a hyperbolic binding isotherm by non-linear regression. Small-Angle X-ray Scattering—The SAXS experiments were performed on Beamline 4-2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory. The experimental set up and procedures were performed as described previously (31Sakash J.B. Chan R.S. Tsuruta H. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 752-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Crystallization and Crystal Mounting—Crystals of the K244N mutant were obtained by the sitting drop method. Prior to crystallization the enzyme was dialyzed into 40 mm KH2PO4, 2.0 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 7.0 for 24 h. Single crystals of the K244N mutant were obtained by mixing a 20 mg/ml filtered solution (0.22 μm) of the K244N enzyme with a solution of 17% (w/v) PEG 1450, 50 mm malonate, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium azide, and 20 mm Bis-Tris buffer, pH 7.0 in a 1:1 ratio (v/v). Rhombohedral-shaped crystals grew in ∼1 week. In preparation for data collection, crystals of dimensions ∼0.6 × 0.5 × 0.3 mm3 were sequentially transferred to a solution containing 20% PEG 1450, 20 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.0, 50 mm malonate, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium azide, and 15% glycerol as cryoprotectant. Then the crystals were briefly dipped into a solution of 23% PEG 1450, 20 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.0, 50 mm malonate, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium azide, and 20% glycerol as cryoprotectant. Crystals mounted in cryo-loops were frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept frozen until exposure to x-rays for data collection. Data Collection and Structure Refinement—All the crystallographic data used for structure determination in this work were collected on beamline X12C at 1 Å wavelength using the Brandeis-2k detector at 100 K at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory. Data were collected up to 2.6 Å resolution, and analyzed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (32Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter Jr., C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods Enzymology. 276. Academic Press, NY1997: 307-326Google Scholar). The initial model used for refinement was the P268A mutant structure (PDB code: 1EZZ) (33Jin L. Stec B. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8058-8066Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although the crystals of the K244N mutant were of the same space group (R3) as the crystals of the P268A enzyme, there was a significant difference in the length of the a and b axes of the unit cell. After initial rigid body refinement and simulated annealing in CNS, it was apparent from an inflated Rfree value that the model bias was cumbersome. Therefore, a consensus model was built from overlaying several T state structures of aspartate transcarbamoylase (PDB codes 1EZZ, 1NBE, and 3AT1) using the program SEQUOIA (34Bruns C.M. Hubatsch I. Ridderstrom M. Mannervik B. Tainer J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 427-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) with all water molecules removed. Automated molecular replacement was performed using AmoRe in CCP4. This model was used for rigid body and simulated annealing refinement with initial bulk solvent correction with CNS (35Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16978) Google Scholar). Initial model rebuilding was performed using XtalView (36McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). After several rounds of rebuilding and simulated annealing, the spread between the Rfactor and Rfree increased. Therefore, the TLS protocol utilizing tensor, libration and screw axis parameterization in CCP4 was employed. As previously described for intermediate resolution structures (37Schomaker V. Trueblood K.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B. 1968; 24: 63-76Crossref Google Scholar, 38Schomaker V. Trueblood K.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B,. 1998; 54: 507-514Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar), anisotropic displacement parameters were used to define a global parameterization of the asymmetric unit. This was done by defining the individual domains of the asymmetric unit as rigid bodies. This takes into account the tensor and libration parameters of the TLS refinement: both dynamic internal motions of the domains and static disorder, respectively. In addition, the screw axis parameter defined in the TLS matrices accounts for the screw axis of the dimer unit of the regulatory chains (of the asymmetric unit) not described by the crystallographic symmetry of R3. The non-crystallographic 2-fold axis of the regulatory dimer is also accounted for in the TLS matrices that were used. All of these factors were included in the calculation of the anisotropic displacement parameters and refinement statistics using REFMAC5 in CCP4. The TLS parameters were chosen to defined the domains of both the upper and lower catalytic and regulatory chains as rigid bodies. For the catalytic chains, residues 1:150 of the CP domain and residues 151:310 of the ASP domain with the C-terminal helix of the CP domain. For the regulatory chains, residues 1:100 of the AL domain and residues 101:153 of the ZN domain. Non-crystallographic symmetry describing the 2-fold axis of the regulatory dimers was also applied. After several rounds of refinement with REFMAC5 in CCP4, the refinement was continued with CNS. The positional refinement performed with the TLS protocol was preserved by defining rigid body groups as described above, using a simple energy minimization script and manual rebuilding with XtalView (36McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). With the Rfactor and Rfree at 21 and 22%, respectively, and 98.8% of all side chains in allowed and generously allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, solvent molecules were added manually. Water molecules were only added where they could be justified by hydrogen bonds and Fo-Fc electron density at or above the 2.5σ level. The final Rfactor and Rfree values were 20.1 and 23.1%, respectively.

Although the substitutions at position 244 have little influence on the maximal catalytic activity, both mutations cause dramatic reductions in cooperativity and the [Asp]0.5. The K244N enzyme exhibited a hyperbolic saturation curve with a maximal velocity of 18.7 mmol·h-1·mg-1, and an [Asp]0.5 of 4.0 mm. In contrast, the wild-type enzyme exhibited a sigmoidal aspartate saturation curve with a Hill coefficient of 2.5, a maximal velocity of 18.9 mmol·h-1·mg-1 and an [Asp]0.5 of 12.4 mm. The K244A enzyme displayed substantially reduced cooperativity, with a Hill coefficient of 1.2, a maximal velocity of 18.8 mmol·h-1·mg-1 and an [Asp]0.5 of 8.6 mm.Table IIKinetic parameters of the wild-type and mutant aspartate transcarbamoylases These data were determined from the aspartate saturation curves.

Nucleotides effects were determined at this aspartate concentration because the nucleotides exert a larger influence on the activity of the enzyme as the aspartate concentration is reduced (39Tauc P. Leconte C. Kerbiriou D. Thiry L. Hervé G. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 155: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). From these nucleotide saturation curves, the maximal extent of activation or inhibition at infinite nucleotide concentration was calculated. The parameters were derived from the curves (shown in Fig. 2) and are displayed in Table III.Table IIIATP activation and CTP inhibition of the wild-type and mutant aspartate transcarbamoylases These data were determined from ATP and CTP saturation curves (Fig. 2). Colorimetric assays were performed at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.3. ATP and CTP saturation curves were determined at saturating levels of carbamoyl phosphate (4.8 mm) and aspartate concentrations at one-half the [Asp]0.5 of the respective enzyme at pH 8.3.EnzymeATPaPercent activation is defined as 100 (AATP/A) where AATP is the activity in the presence of ATP, and A is the activity in the absence of ATPKATPbK is the nucleotide concentration required to activate or inhibit the enzyme by 50% of the maximal effectCTPcPercent residual activity is defined as 100 (ACTP/A) where ACTP is the activity in the presence of CTP, and A is the activity in the absence of CTPKCTPbK is the nucleotide concentration required to activate or inhibit the enzyme by 50% of the maximal effect%mm%mmWild-type4000.25300.52K244N1200.63750.035K244A1400.61730.051a Percent activation is defined as 100 (AATP/A) where AATP is the activity in the presence of ATP, and A is the activity in the absence of ATPb K is the nucleotide concentration required to activate or inhibit the enzyme by 50% of the maximal effectc Percent residual activity is defined as 100 (ACTP/A) where ACTP is the activity in the presence of CTP, and A is the activity in the absence of CTP Open table in a new tab As shown in Fig. 2, the K244N and K244A enzymes exhibited similar activation by ATP and inhibition by CTP. However, the nucleotide effects for both mutant enzymes were much reduced as compared with the wild-type enzyme. The K244N and K244A enzymes were activated by ATP approximately one-fourth that of the wild-type enzyme, and were inhibited by CTP approximately one-third that of the wild-type enzyme. Effects of N-(phosphonoacetyl)-l-aspartate (PALA) on the K244N and K244A Enzymes—At low concentrations of aspartate, where the enzyme is predominately in the T state, low concentrations of PALA activate the wild-type enzyme (40Collins K.D. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6599-6605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by shifting the population to the R state. At higher concentrations of PALA inhibition is observed as the remaining active sites are filled. For the K244N and K244A enzymes, there was no activation observed by PALA (data not shown). Small Angle X-ray Scattering—Small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) in solution was used to evaluate the quaternary structures of the wild-type, K244A and K244N enzymes in the absence and presence of saturating concentrations of carbamoyl phosphate and PALA at pH 8.3. For the wild-type enzyme, shown in Fig. 3A, there is a significant change in the SAXS pattern upon addition of PALA, with both a change in the peak position and an increase in relative intensity (41Moody M.F. Vachette P. Foote A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 133: 517-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A saturating concentration of carbamoyl phosphate (5 mm) only shifted the SAXS curve slightly as compared with the unliganded curve for the wild-type enzyme, indicating that CP binding induces only a small quaternary structural change. The SAXS scattering curves for the unliganded K244A and K244N enzymes, shown in Fig. 3, B and C, respectively, are shifted slightly toward the R state as compared with the T state SAXS pattern of the wild-type enzyme. In the presence of PALA, the SAXS curves of both the K244A and K244N enzymes are nearly identical to the SAXS curve of the wild-type R state. Unlike the wild-type enzyme, the addition of a saturating concentration of carbamoyl phosphate (5 mm) significantly shifted the SAXS curves for both the K244A and K244N enzymes. For the K244A enzyme, the addition of CP shifted the structure nearly all the way to the R state. However, for the K244N enzyme the addition of CP shifted the structure all the way to the R state. Three-dimensional Structure of the K244N Enzyme—The K244N enzyme in the absence of ligands was crystallized in the R3 space group with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 125.67, c = 198.2 (Table I). The K244N enzyme had similar unit cell dimensions along the c axis and the same space group as observed for crystals of the P268A aspartate transcarbamoylase that was crystallized under similar conditions (33Jin L. Stec B. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8058-8066Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, the length of the a and b axes were ∼4 Å shorter than that observed for the crystal of the P268A enzyme. The crystals of the K244N enzyme diffracted to 2.6 Å resolution with completeness of ∼95% (Table I), and the structure was refined to an Rfactor and Rfree of 20.1 and 23.1%, respectively, with 50 waters. The vertical separation of the two catalytic trimers of aspartate transcarbamoylase is defined as the distance between the center of mass of the C1 2Within the E. coli holoenzyme, the catalytic chains of the top catalytic trimer are numbered C1, C2, and C3, whereas the catalytic chains of the bottom catalytic trimer are numbered C4, C5, and C6, with C4 under C1. The regulatory dimers contain chains R1-R6, R2-R4, and R3-R5. A regulatory chain is in direct co"
