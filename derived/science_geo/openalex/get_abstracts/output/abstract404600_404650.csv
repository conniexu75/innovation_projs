https://openalex.org/W2113236498,"Broadly neutralizing antibodies against highly variable viral pathogens are much sought after to treat or protect against global circulating viruses. Here we probed the neutralizing antibody repertoires of four human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected donors with remarkably broad and potent neutralizing responses and rescued 17 new monoclonal antibodies that neutralize broadly across clades. Many of the new monoclonal antibodies are almost tenfold more potent than the recently described PG9, PG16 and VRC01 broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and 100-fold more potent than the original prototype HIV broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies1,2,3. The monoclonal antibodies largely recapitulate the neutralization breadth found in the corresponding donor serum and many recognize novel epitopes on envelope (Env) glycoprotein gp120, illuminating new targets for vaccine design. Analysis of neutralization by the full complement of anti-HIV broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies now available reveals that certain combinations of antibodies should offer markedly more favourable coverage of the enormous diversity of global circulating viruses than others and these combinations might be sought in active or passive immunization regimes. Overall, the isolation of multiple HIV broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from several donors that, in aggregate, provide broad coverage at low concentrations is a highly positive indicator for the eventual design of an effective antibody-based HIV vaccine."

https://openalex.org/W2145803029,"Shorelines at the interface of marine, estuarine and terrestrial biomes are among the most degraded and threatened habitats in the coastal zone because of their sensitivity to sea level rise, storms and increased human utilization. Previous efforts to protect shorelines have largely involved constructing bulkheads and seawalls which can detrimentally affect nearshore habitats. Recently, efforts have shifted towards ""living shoreline"" approaches that include biogenic breakwater reefs. Our study experimentally tested the efficacy of breakwater reefs constructed of oyster shell for protecting eroding coastal shorelines and their effect on nearshore fish and shellfish communities. Along two different stretches of eroding shoreline, we created replicated pairs of subtidal breakwater reefs and established unaltered reference areas as controls. At both sites we measured shoreline and bathymetric change and quantified oyster recruitment, fish and mobile macro-invertebrate abundances. Breakwater reef treatments mitigated shoreline retreat by more than 40% at one site, but overall vegetation retreat and erosion rates were high across all treatments and at both sites. Oyster settlement and subsequent survival were observed at both sites, with mean adult densities reaching more than eighty oysters m(-2) at one site. We found the corridor between intertidal marsh and oyster reef breakwaters supported higher abundances and different communities of fishes than control plots without oyster reef habitat. Among the fishes and mobile invertebrates that appeared to be strongly enhanced were several economically-important species. Blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) were the most clearly enhanced (+297%) by the presence of breakwater reefs, while red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) (+108%), spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus) (+88%) and flounder (Paralichthys sp.) (+79%) also benefited. Although the vertical relief of the breakwater reefs was reduced over the course of our study and this compromised the shoreline protection capacity, the observed habitat value demonstrates ecological justification for future, more robust shoreline protection projects."
https://openalex.org/W2042165715,"If we could return the planet to ancestral conditions, asked the late Stephen Jay Gould, would we get a replay of the same evolutionary movie? Focusing on the simpler case of nematode domestication, McGrath et al. find that two Caenorhabditis elegans lines and Caenorhabditis briggsae, a species separated by some 20 million years from C. elegans, independently accumulated mutations in a conserved set of pheromone receptor genes, thus reducing the worms' natural trend to hibernate in overcrowded conditions. Such convergence in the adaptation process shows that evolution can indeed be quite reproducible, at least under some specific environmental constraints. Evolution can follow predictable genetic trajectories1, indicating that discrete environmental shifts can select for reproducible genetic changes2,3,4. Conspecific individuals are an important feature of an animal’s environment, and a potential source of selective pressures. Here we show that adaptation of two Caenorhabditis species to growth at high density, a feature common to domestic environments, occurs by reproducible genetic changes to pheromone receptor genes. Chemical communication through pheromones that accumulate during high-density growth causes young nematode larvae to enter the long-lived but non-reproductive dauer stage. Two strains of Caenorhabditis elegans grown at high density have independently acquired multigenic resistance to pheromone-induced dauer formation. In each strain, resistance to the pheromone ascaroside C3 results from a deletion that disrupts the adjacent chemoreceptor genes serpentine receptor class g (srg)-36 and -37. Through misexpression experiments, we show that these genes encode redundant G-protein-coupled receptors for ascaroside C3. Multigenic resistance to dauer formation has also arisen in high-density cultures of a different nematode species, Caenorhabditis briggsae, resulting in part from deletion of an srg gene paralogous to srg-36 and srg-37. These results demonstrate rapid remodelling of the chemoreceptor repertoire as an adaptation to specific environments, and indicate that parallel changes to a common genetic substrate can affect life-history traits across species."

https://openalex.org/W1999249055,"Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 21 and growth hormone (GH) are metabolic hormones that play important roles in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. Both hormones are induced in response to fasting and exert their actions on adipocytes to regulate lipolysis. However, the molecular interaction between these two hormones remains unclear. Here we demonstrate the existence of a feedback loop between GH and FGF21 on the regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes. A single bolus injection of GH into C57 mice acutely increases both mRNA and protein expression of FGF21 in the liver, thereby leading to a marked elevation of serum FGF21 concentrations. Such a stimulatory effect of GH on hepatic FGF21 production is abrogated by pretreatment of mice with the lipolysis inhibitor niacin. Direct incubation of either liver explants or human HepG2 hepatocytes with GH has no effect on FGF21 expression. On the other hand, FGF21 production in HepG2 cells is significantly induced by incubation with the conditioned medium harvested from GH-treated adipose tissue explants, which contains high concentrations of free fatty acids (FFA). Further analysis shows that FFA released by GH-induced lipolysis stimulates hepatic FGF21 expression by activation of the transcription factor PPARα. In FGF21-null mice, both the magnitude and duration of GH-induced lipolysis are significantly higher than those in their wild type littermates. Taken together, these findings suggest that GH-induced hepatic FGF21 production is mediated by FFA released from adipose tissues, and elevated FGF21 in turn acts as a negative feedback signal to terminate GH-stimulated lipolysis in adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2107740140,"Obesity is a major risk factor for the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Adipose tissue secretes various bioactive molecules, referred to as adipokines, whose dysregulation can mediate changes in glucose homeostasis and inflammatory responses. Here, we identify C1qdc2/CTRP12 as an insulin-sensitizing adipokine that is abundantly expressed by fat tissues and designate this adipokine as adipolin (adipose-derived insulin-sensitizing factor). Adipolin expression in adipose tissue and plasma was reduced in rodent models of obesity. Adipolin expression was also decreased in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes by treatment with inducers of endoplasmic reticulum stress and inflammation. Systemic administration of adipolin ameliorated glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in diet-induced obese mice. Adipolin administration also reduced macrophage accumulation and proinflammatory gene expression in the adipose tissue of obese mice. Conditioned medium from adipolin-expressing cells diminished the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in response to stimulation with LPS or TNFα in cultured macrophages. These data suggest that adipolin functions as an anti-inflammatory adipokine that exerts beneficial actions on glucose metabolism. Therefore, adipolin represents a new target molecule for the treatment of insulin resistance and diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2070338033,"Synucleinopathies are a group of neurodegenerative disorders associated with the formation of aberrant amyloid inclusions composed of the normally soluble presynaptic protein α-synuclein (α-syn). Parkinson disease is the most well known of these disorders because it bears α-syn pathological inclusions known as Lewy bodies (LBs). Mutations in the gene for α-syn, including the E46K missense mutation, are sufficient to cause Parkinson disease as well as other synucleinopathies like dementia with LBs. Herein, we describe transgenic mice expressing E46K human α-syn in CNS neurons that develop detrimental age-dependent motor impairments. These animals accumulate age-dependent intracytoplasmic neuronal α-syn inclusions that parallel disease and recapitulate the biochemical, histological, and morphological properties of LBs. Surprisingly, the morphology of α-syn inclusions in E46K human α-syn transgenic mice more closely resemble LBs than the previously described transgenic mice (line M83) that express neuronal A53T human α-syn. E46K human α-syn mice also develop abundant neuronal tau inclusions that resemble neurofibrillary tangles. Subsequent studies on the ability of E46K α-syn to induce tau inclusions in cellular models suggest that both direct and indirect mechanisms of protein aggregation are probably involved in the formation of the tau inclusions observed here in vivo. Re-evaluation of presymptomatic transgenic mice expressing A53T human α-syn reveals that the formation of α-syn inclusions in mice must be synchronized; however, inclusion formation is diffuse within affected areas of the neuroaxis such that there was no clustering of inclusions. Collectively, these findings provide insights in the mechanisms of formation of these aberrant proteinaceous inclusions and support the notion that α-syn aggregates are involved in the pathogenesis of human diseases.

The molecular interactions, protein folding, and many of the steps involved in the conversion of normally soluble α-syn into the formation of amyloid inclusions have been studied extensively using in vitro α-syn (4Waxman E.A.

For example, it is well established that the hydrophobic region of α-syn is necessary for amyloid formation, but both the N- and C-terminal regions and modifications therein influence this process (4Waxman E.A.

The importance of these findings notwithstanding, the biological events that lead to the aggregation of α-syn into pathological inclusions in vivo are still poorly understood (4Waxman E.A.

The most direct and compelling evidence for a fundamental role of α-syn in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies is the causal relationship between genetic mutations and disease. The missense mutation (c.G209A) in the α-syn gene (SNCA) resulting in the amino acid substitution A53T was first identified in a large Italian family (Contursi) and three small Greek families with autosomal dominant PD (24Polymeropoulos M.H.

For the generation of transgenic mice expressing E46K human α-syn, the cDNA harboring the E46K mutation was cloned into the MoPrP.Xho expression vector (45Borchelt D.R. Davis J. Fischer M. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Ratovitsky T. Regard J. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Sisodia S.S. Price D.L. Genet. Anal. 1996; 13: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) at the XhoI restriction site. The 14-kb NotI linear fragments containing the α-syn cDNA and the mouse prion protein (PrP) gene promoter together with its 5′-untranslated region (UTR) containing an intron and its 3′-untranslated sequences (Fig. 1A) were used as the transgene to create mice expressing E46K α-syn on a C57Bl/C3H background. The transgenic DNA was microinjected into C57Bl/C3H mouse eggs as a service provided by the Transgenic and Chimeric Mouse Facility of the University of Pennsylvania. Genomic DNA samples were isolated from mouse tails with the Puregene DNA isolation kit (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Potential founders were identified by Southern blot analysis with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide-primed α-syn DNA probe. Stable transgenic lines carrying the mutant E46K human α-syn constructs (lines M31 and M47) were established, and transgenic offspring were identified by Southern blot analysis of tail DNA. Homozygous transgenic lineages were identified by quantitative Southern blot analysis and verified by backcrossing. Mice were generated, maintained, and sacrificed by CO2 euthanization as approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Motor coordination was assessed using footprint analysis testing as described previously (46Heck D.H. Zhao Y. Roy S. LeDoux M.S. Reiter L.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 2181-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, the fore and hind paws were dipped in non-toxic water-based paints of different colors, and mice were allowed to walk on strips of white paper through a narrow walkway (5 cm wide, 70 cm long). 3–4-month-old mice (WT, n = 6; M47, n = 6), 5–9-month-old mice (WT, n = 6; M47, n = 8), and 15–19-month-old mice (WT, n = 6; M47, n = 4) were subjected to 3 days of testing with three trials per session (with an additional day for non-compliant subjects). The footprint patterns were analyzed for stride length and fore/hind paw overlap as an assessment of gait during ambulation. Stride length was measured as the distance between footprints of each stride. Fore/hind paw overlap was measured as the distance between fore and hind footprints of overlapping steps. Trials were averaged for each mouse, and individual days of testing were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni post hoc analysis (p was set at <0.05 as level of significance) to assess reproducibility. Data for age cohorts were calculated from the average performance of each mouse, and statistical significance was determined using a one-tailed t test. To evaluate motor performance, a wire hang test was performed as described previously with slight modifications (47Sango K. Yamanaka S. Hoffmann A. Okuda Y. Grinberg A. Westphal H. McDonald M.P. Crawley J.N. Sandhoff K. Suzuki K. Proia R.L. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were placed on an elevated wire cage lid that was waved lightly to ensure mice gripped the wires before the lid was inverted, and the latency to fall was recorded. A 60-s cut-off was used. 2–4-month-old mice (WT, n = 8; M47, n = 24), 6–8-month-old mice (WT, n = 8; M47, n = 6), and 15–19-month-old mice (WT, n = 7; M47, n = 5) were subjected to 3 days of testing with three trials per session with no prior training. The ability to hang from the wire cage lid is used as an assessment of neuromuscular function and grip strength. Trials were averaged for each mouse, and individual days of testing were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni post hoc analysis (p was set at <0.05 as level of significance) to assess reproducibility. Data for age cohorts were calculated from the average performance of each mouse, and statistical significance was determined using a two-tailed t test. Mice were sacrificed with CO2 euthanization and perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/heparin, followed by perfusion with either 70% ethanol plus 150 mm NaCl or PBS-buffered formalin. The brain and spinal cord were then removed and fixed for 24 h in the respective fixatives used for perfusion. As described previously, tissues were dehydrated at room temperature through a series of ethanol solutions, followed by xylene, and then were infiltrated with paraffin at 60 °C (48Duda J.E. Giasson B.I. Gur T.L. Montine T.J. Robertson D. Biaggioni I. Hurtig H.I. Stern M.B. Gollomp S.M. Grossman M. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 59: 830-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The tissues were then embedded into paraffin blocks, which were cut into 7-μm sections. Immunostaining of the sections was performed using methods described previously (48Duda J.E. Giasson B.I. Gur T.L. Montine T.J. Robertson D. Biaggioni I. Hurtig H.I. Stern M.B. Gollomp S.M. Grossman M. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 59: 830-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Briefly, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were rehydrated and labeled with primary antibodies in 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.6, 2% horse serum overnight at 4 °C. Following washing, sections were sequentially incubated with biotinylated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies and avidin-biotin complex system (Vectastain ABC Elite Kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunocomplexes were visualized with the chromogen 3,3′-diaminobenzidine, and the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized and hydrated through a series of graded ethanol solutions followed by 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.6. The sections were blocked with 5% dry milk, 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.6, and were incubated simultaneously with combinations of primary antibodies diluted in 5% dry milk, 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.6. After extensive washing, sections were incubated with goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa 594 and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa 488 (Invitrogen). Sections were postfixed with formalin, incubated with Sudan Black, and stained with 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342. The sections were coverslipped with Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL) and visualized using an Olympus BX51 microscope mounted with a DP71 Olympus digital camera to capture images. The cortex or brainstem/spinal cord was dissected from mice. For each mouse, the brainstem and spinal cord were pooled together, and then all tissues were weighed and homogenized with a pellet pestle motor in 3 tissue volumes of high salt (HS) buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 750 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA) with a mixture of protease inhibitor (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, N-tosyl-l-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, N-tosyl-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and soybean trypsin inhibitor) followed by sedimentation at 100,000 × g for 20 min. Supernatants were saved as the HS fraction. Pellets were rehomogenized in 3 tissue volumes of HS buffer and sedimented at 100,000 × g for 20 min. Pellets were homogenized in 3 tissue volumes of HS buffer with 1% Triton X-100 (HS-TX buffer) and sedimented at 100,000 × g for 20 min. These supernatants were saved as the HS-TX fraction. The pellets were subjected to a sucrose myelin float by homogenizing in 3 pellet volumes of sucrose buffer (HS buffer plus 1 m sucrose), and after centrifugation, the myelin-rich supernatants were discarded. Pellets were then homogenized in 2 tissue volumes of radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS with the protease inhibitors), sedimented at 100,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatants were saved as the RIPA fraction. Pellets were then sonicated in 1 pellet volume of 2% SDS, 4 m urea and were designated to be the SDS/urea fractions. The fractions were then quantified using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce). SDS sample buffer was added to each sample, and all samples, except for the SDS-urea fractions, were heated to 100 °C for 5 min prior to Western blot analysis. Equal amounts of protein extracts (10 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. Protein samples were separated by electrophoresis onto 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for α-syn analysis or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for tau analysis and transferred by electrophoresis onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 5% dry milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with Syn211, SNL-1, SNL-4, or anti-actin in TBS with 5% dry milk or with PHF1, AT8, or pSer129 in TBS with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Each incubation was followed by goat anti-mouse-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Amersham Biosciences) or goat anti-rabbit conjugated HRP (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), and immunoreactivity was detected using chemiluminescent reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) followed by exposure on x-ray film. For total protein lysate of mouse tissues, the specified tissues were lysed in 3% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, by sonication and heating to 100 °C for 10 min. Total protein extracts were then quantified using the BCA assay using BSA as the standard. Equal amounts of protein extracts (3 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot. Mice were sacrificed with CO2 euthanization and perfused with PBS/heparin, followed by 2% paraformaldehyde plus 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate, pH 7.4. The tissue was further fixed for 12 h, washed with PBS, cut into 50 μm sections with a vibratome, and reacted with 0.1% sodium borohydrate in PBS for 10 min. Following washing and blocking with 5% horse serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% cold water fish skin gelatin in PBS for 24 h, the sections were incubated with antibody SNL-4 or pSer129 in blocking solution for 24 h. After extensive washing, the sections were sequentially incubated with a biotinylated goat anti-mouse antibody or a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and developed with 3,3′- diaminobenzidine. The chemical product was enhanced using a modification of the Rodriguez silver/gold enhancement method (49Rodríguez E.M. Yulis R. Peruzzo B. Alvial G. Andrade R. Histochemistry. 1984; 81: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 50Teclemariam-Mesbah R. Wortel J. Romijn H.J. Buijs R.M. J. Histochem.

After extensive washes, sections were postfixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, followed by 2% osmium tetraoxide. Sections were dehydration in a graded ethanol series prior to infiltration and embedding in EMbed-812 (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA). Epone blocks were cut, and sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Sections were examined with a JEOL 1010 transmission electron microscope (Peabody, MA) fitted with a Hamamatsu digital camera (Bridgewater, MA) and AMT Advantage image capture software (Danvers, MA).

In the present work, we aimed to evaluate how the adipogenic environment influences the stemness of the resident multipotent stem cells. To achieve this goal, human omental multipotent stem cells (hO-MSCs) were isolated, expanded, and characterized in both healthy lean and morbidly obese individuals. We observed decreased cell proliferation, premature senescence, and increased cytokine secretion associated with increasing body mass index of the patients. Consistent with the latter finding, the hO-MSCs derived from patients with morbid obesity lose their multilineage differentiation capacity associated with a dysregulation in the Wnt, Notch, and Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathways. Moreover, microRNAs involved in the regulation of stemness, cell differentiation, and senescence were also up-regulated in obese individuals. Altogether, our data show that obesity causes a general short circuit in the stemness gene network of hO-MSCs.—Roldan, M., Macias-Gonzalez, M., Garcia, R., Tinahones, F. J., Martin, M.

To fully replace natural APCs, an optimized aAPC must present antigen (signal 1), provide costimulation (signal 2), and release cytokine (signal 3). Here we demonstrate that the spatial and temporal characteristics of paracrine release of IL-2 from biodegradable polymer aAPCs (now termed paAPCs) can significantly alter the balance in the activation and proliferation of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. Paracrine delivery of IL-2 upon T cell contact with paAPCs induces significant IL-2 accumulation in the synaptic contact region. This accumulation increases CD25 (the inducible IL-2 Rα chain) on responding T cells and increases proliferation of CD8+ T cells in vitro to levels 10 times that observed with equivalent amounts of bulk IL-2. These CD8+ T cell responses critically depend upon close contact of T cells and the paAPCs and require sustained release of low levels of IL-2. The same conditions promote activation-induced cell death in CD4+ T cells. These findings provide insight into the response of T cell subsets to paracrine IL-2.

Activation of naïve T cells to proliferate and acquire effector function requires, at a minimum, antigen recognition by the TCR 2The abbreviations used are: TCRT cell receptorAPCantigen-presenting cellpaAPCpolymer artificial antigen-presenting cellaAPCartificial antigen-presenting cellTregregulatory T cell.

Immunol. 2002; 2: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). IL-2 is a canonical T cell growth factor and plays a central role in the expansion and differentiation of CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells both in vivo and in vitro (2Pardoll D.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 3Rochman Y. Spolski R. Leonard W.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar) and may be described as signal 3. IL-2 is especially necessary for CD8+ T cell expansion, as this subset ceases IL-2 production after a few days of stimulation (4Janssen E.M. Lemmens E.E. Wolfe T. Christen U. von Herrath M.G. Schoenberger S.P. Nature. 2003; 421: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar, 5Shedlock D.J. Shen H. Science. 2003; 300: 337-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar, 6Shrikant P. Mescher M.F. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 1753-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). IL-2 is principally produced by CD4+ T cells (7Malek T.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 26: 453-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). APCs, such as dendritic cells, can foster CD8+ T cell responses by facilitating IL-2 delivery from CD4+ T cells to CD8+ T cells. This is accomplished by bringing CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes into close contact (1Blachère N.E. Morris H.K. Braun D. Saklani H. Di Santo J.P. Darnell R.B. Albert M.L. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 7288-7300Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 7Malek T.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 26: 453-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). IL-2 delivery can also occur by synaptic transmission between T cells without the need for an APC, as in the case of homotypic T cell interactions. Synaptic transmission of IL-2, as such, has been demonstrated as a key signal for T cell cluster initiation and persistence after antigen priming (8Sabatos C.A. Doh J. Chakravarti S. Friedman R.S. Pandurangi P.G. Tooley A.J. Krummel M.F. Immunity. 2008; 29: 238-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that DCs may also secrete IL-2 at the site of T cell contact, and accumulation of this cytokine at the DC-T cell interface has been shown to be an important signal for T cell activation (9Granucci F. Feau S. Angeli V. Trottein F. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5075-5081Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Thus, paracrine IL-2 delivery is a physiologically important process for effective immune responses. T cell receptor antigen-presenting cell polymer artificial antigen-presenting cell artificial antigen-presenting cell regulatory T cell. Both the timing and duration of IL-2 delivery are important determinants for the extent of T cell expansion (10D'Souza W.N. Lefrançois L. J.

Med. 2007; 204: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). IL-2 received from CD4+ T cells within the first few hours of CD8+ T cell stimulation is responsible for increased IFN-γ and granzyme B secretion and potent anti-tumor activity (11Lai Y.P. Lin C.C. Liao W.J. Tang C.Y. Chen S.C. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e7766Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). IL-2 is also required at later time points in CD8+ T cell stimulation to maintain proliferation and produce robust secondary responses (10D'Souza W.N. Lefrançois L. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 5727-5735Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 13Williams M.A. Tyznik A.J. Bevan M.J. Nature. 2006; 441: 890-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). However, high concentrations and chronic exposure to IL-2 can negatively impact T cell stimulation by sensitizing T cells to activation-induced cell death and tolerance induction (14Krammer P.H. Arnold R. Lavrik I.N. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 532-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 15Lenardo M.J.

Mol. Ther. 2008; 16: 765-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The source of IL-2 is also relevant because activated CD4+ T cells may sometimes display FasL, which can result in CD8+ T cell death. Here we constructed a polymeric artificial antigen-presenting cell (paAPC) from biodegradable materials that is capable of providing an antigenic signal, effective costimulation, and adjustable paracrine IL-2 signals to T cells (17Steenblock E.R. Fahmy T.M. Mol. Ther. 2008; 16: 765-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 18Steenblock E.R. Wrzesinski S.H. Flavell R.A. Fahmy T.M. Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 2009; 9: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The polymer that constitutes the core of this system, poly(lactic co-glycolic acid), and its homopolymers poly(lactic acid) and poly(glycolic acid) have been used for over 30 years in various human clinical applications, including drug delivery systems. The biodegradability of the polymer and subsequent release of bioactive encapsulant allow for dissection of the spatial and temporal paracrine IL-2 delivery components and their importance in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation. In this report, we explore how local control over IL-2 delivery impacts lymphocyte activity. Given that peptide-MHC Class I complexes are recognized by CD8+ T cells whereas peptide-Class II MHC complexes are recognized by CD4+ T cells, no single peptide-MHC complex can be used to activate both T cell subsets. Therefore, in this study, we use a paAPC system presenting an antigen-independent signal equally effective on both T cell subsets, namely anti-CD3 antibody. Anti-CD3, which binds to invariant signaling proteins associated with all TCRs on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, is widely used as an antigen mimetic because like peptide-MHC complexes, it activates T cells by clustering TCR·CD3 complexes on the T cell surface. This approach allowed us to assess differences in the responses of these two subsets to paAPC-encapsulated IL-2 acting as a paracrine IL-2 point source. In cells lacking the ability to secrete IL-2, paracrine delivery is critical for maximum expansion. We show that CD8+ T cells proliferate vigorously in response to paracrine IL-2 delivery by paAPCs, whereas CD4+ T cell expansion is limited by apoptosis. These effects cannot be mimicked even by an addition of a 1000-fold excess of exogenous IL-2. We find that synaptic accumulation of IL-2 in the early stages of activation may be important. Additionally, a slow and sustained release of IL-2 accounts for the effects of paracrine delivery, whereas an initial short-lived burst of cytokine availability (on the order of hours) is dispensable. The slow, sustained release must occur in close proximity to T cells to achieve maximal response. Animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Yale University. All animals were routinely used at 6–10 weeks of age, were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions, and were routinely checked by the Yale University Animal Resource Center. C57BL/6 (B6) mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories, Inc. (Wilmington, MA). Primary splenocytes were obtained from homogenized naïve mouse spleens after depletion of erythrocytes by hypotonic lysis (Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium). Splenocytes were resuspended in complete RPMI-10, consisting of RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 25 μm β-mercaptoethanol (American Bioanalytical, Natick, MA), 2% penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma Aldrich) and 1% gentamicin (Sigma Aldrich). B6 splenocytes were either used without further purification or subjected to negative immunoselection (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) to produce CD8+, CD4+, or CD4+CD25- populations of at least 96% purity. Poly(lactic co-glycolic acid) 50/50 with an average molecular weight of 80 kDa was obtained from Durect Corp. (Cupertino, CA). Microparticles were fabricated using a double emulsion water-in-oil-in-water technique (Jain 2000 Biomaterials). Microparticles were surface-modified with avidin-palmitate conjugate as described previously (19Park, J., Mattessich, T., Jay, S. M., Agawu, A., Saltzman, W. M., Fahmy, T. M. (2011) J. Control. Release.Google Scholar, 20Fahmy T.M. Samstein R.M. Harness C.C. Mark Saltzman W. Biomaterials. 2005; 26: 5727-5736Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For cytokine encapsulation, 100 μg of recombinant human (rh) IL-2 (Proleukin, Chiron Corp., Emeryville, CA) was added to the poly(lactic co-glycolic acid) solution. Particles were lyophilized and stored at −20 °C until use. Controlled release profiles were obtained in 1 ml of PBS at 37 °C from 5 mg of particles. An ELISA analysis was performed to measure rhIL-2 levels (BD Biosciences). Biotinylated anti-mouse CD3ϵ (BD Biosciences) and anti-mouse CD28 (BD Biosciences) were added at 10 μg/ml to a 10 mg/ml solution of poly(lactic co-glycolic acid) particles in PBS and rotated at room temperature for 20 min. IL-2-biotin, where present, was added after 5 min of particle incubation with antibodies without washing. Particles were then washed in all cases with PBS + 1% FBS and resuspended in complete RPMI-10. IL-2 biotin was prepared by reacting rhIL-2 with biotin hydrazide followed by removal of excess biotin reagent. The activity of IL-2-biotin was verified (supplemental Fig. S2). paAPCs with bound antibody were added to C57Bl/6 splenocyte or purified T cell cultures containing 106 cells/ml at 0.5 mg/ml After incubation at 37 °C for 48 h, cell culture supernatant was assayed for IFN-γ and mouse IL-2 or rhIL-2 using ELISA (BD Biosciences). Cells were analyzed for viability after 96 h using Cell Titer Blue (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). For “released particle” studies, paAPCs were allowed to release IL-2 in PBS at 37 °C for 24 h and then washed with PBS + 1% FBS prior to coupling to biotinylated anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 for use in stimulation studies. Reported values were obtained by using dilutions of supernatant that yielded absorbance values within the linear portion of the standard curve. All reagents were added to cell culture at time zero and were not supplemented at a later time. Blocking antibodies (BD Biosciences) were added at 10 μg/ml, carbobenzoxy-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-[O-methyl]-fluoromethylketone (Promega, Madison, WI) was added at 20 μm, and exogenous rhIL-2 (Chiron, Emeryville, CA) was added at the indicated amount in 2 ml of culture. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry after 96 h. Cells were stained with a 1:200 dilution of antibody in PBS + 1% FBS. All antibodies were obtained from BD Biosciences. Analysis of fluorescence was performed after gating on the lymphocyte population in side scatter versus forward scatter plots followed by gating on the CD8+ and CD4+ subsets. Annexin V and the BrdU flow kits were obtained from BD Biosciences and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were run on a BD FACScan or LSRII (BD Biosciences) and were analyzed using FlowJo 8.7 (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). Data fits were performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0. Controlled release data were fit to a two-phase exponential association model. Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism 5.0 using a one-way analysis of variance with p < 0.05 considered significant. Diffusion controls the shape of the IL-2 normalized concentration field (C*) near a paAPC. If the ambience is quiescent and the C field is steady, the diffusion equation reduces to the Laplace equation:∇2C*=0(Eq. 1) For an isolated (far from a T cell) paAPC with radius a, the concentration field is spherically symmetric, and the concentration decreases inversely with radial distance (r) from the center of the paAPC (see Fig. 1D, left panel).C*=C(r)C0=ar(Eq. 2) where C0 is the surface concentration (r = a). The normalized concentration (C*) thus has a value of unity on the surface of an isolated paAPC. When the paAPC is in proximity with a T cell, the problem is more complex. The C* field is distorted by the interaction and will depend not only on the geometric parameters such as surface-to-surface spacing and relative cell/particle size but also on kinetic parameters, including the release capacity of the paAPC and the absorption characteristics of the T cell. Because we are interested in the early stages of cell activation, when there are few, if any, high affinity IL-2 receptors, the T cell may be considered to be non-absorbing at that stage. If the paAPC releases IL-2 at a constant rate, then Equation 1 can be solved using a boundary collocation method (supplemental methods) (21Labowsky M. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2010; 24: 3079-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 22Labowsky M. Fenn J.B. de la Mora J.F. Anal. Chim. Acta. 2000; 406: 105-118Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Delivering IL-2 from a point source produces both spatial and temporal gradients. To examine the effect of spatial proximity of an IL-2 source on T cell stimulation, naïve T cells from mouse splenocytes were exposed to aAPCs presenting surface-bound anti-CD3 (signal 1) and anti-CD28 (signal 2) monoclonal antibodies. We then compared the effects when IL-2 was directly added to the culture medium (exogenous IL-2) or when it was provided by releasing paAPCs (encapsulated IL-2) under three different conditions, as shown in Fig. 1A. Because IL-2 is continually released from paAPCs, the concentration of IL-2 decreases with increasing distance from its paAPC source. The closest encounter (Fig. 1A, right panel) IL-2 is delivered by paAPCs that that are separated from T cells only by the nanoscale molecular interactions involving anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 binding to their ligands on T cells. Typically these interactions are on the order of an antigen-antibody molecular length scale (approximately 10–20 nm). In the second scenario, signal 1 and 2 stimulation was achieved with aAPCs (i.e. particles decorated with antibodies without encapsulated IL-2), and IL-2 delivery was achieved with uncoated paAPCs (Fig. 1A, center panel). In this setting, paAPCs may get near the responding T cells, but the nanoscale proximal interactions with T cells are expected to be less frequent, if not absent. In the third scenario, signal 1 and 2 interactions were achieved with aAPCs (particles with antibodies) in contact with the T cells, and IL-2 is provided by uncoated paAPCs that were placed across a transwell with a pore diameter of 0.4 μm (Fig. 1A, left panel). Released IL-2 freely diffuses from the transwell into the cell compartment. Again, in this scenario, cells and IL-2 releasing particles are far from each other on the order of many microns. The total amount of IL-2, either exogenously added or encapsulated in particles, was equal (1 ng of IL-2 in 2 ml of culture). IL-2 delivered from paAPCs enhanced T cell activation and proliferation compared with exogenous addition of IL-2 (Fig. 1B) and led to up-regulation of CD25 (C). However, IL-2 delivery was significantly less effective than paAPCs in molecular proximity to T cells. Specifically, paAPCs releasing IL-2 produced higher levels of CD25 on the surface of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Fig. 1C) and greater T cell activation as measured by secretion of IL-2 and IFN-γ and resulted in increased expansion of CD8+ T cells (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1). Interestingly, CD4+ T cell expansion was unaffected by distancing the IL-2 source (Fig. 1B). The results highlight the importance of colocalization of IL-2 delivery with stimulatory and costimulatory signals for efficient CD8+ T cell signaling. A T cell present in proximity to a paAPC can experience variable IL-2 gradients depending on its separation distance from the IL-2 source. To understand the diffusive transfer of IL-2 when a T cell interacts with a paAPC, it is important to examine the behavior of the concentration field during the interaction. The normalized concentration field (C*) field is spherically symmetric and decreases inversely with distance from an isolated paAPC in a quiescent environment (Fig. 1D, left panel). When a paAPC interacts with a T cell, the spherical symmetry of C* is compromised. Prior to activation, the naïve T cell can be considered as a poorly receptive to IL-2 compared with its activated state (7Malek T.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 26: 453-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). If the paAPC releases IL-2 at a constant rate, then an accumulation of IL-2 occurs at the interface. The amount of interfacial IL-2 accumulation will depend on the proximity of the cells. When the cells are separated by 3 μm (Fig. 1D, center panel), the IL-2 surface concentration will be non-uniform on the T cell surface and will have a maximum C* value of 0.7 at the synaptic point, as may be seen from the underlying magnified view of the synaptic region. If an isolated paAPC has an IL-2 surface concentration of about 1.8 pm, then a C* = 0.7 means the concentration near the T cell interface would be 1.26 pm. When the T cell is separated from the paAPC by only 20 nm (an approximate distance of synaptic ligand-receptor interactions, Fig. 1D, right panel), the T cell synaptic point C* increases significantly to 2.2, which equates to an actual concentration of 3.96 pm. So, the closer the cells, the larger the interfacial IL-2 accumulation. At this point, the T cell contact point is bathed in a concentration of IL-2 that is considerably higher than what would be expected based on an isolated paAPC concentration. This accumulation effect will be even magnified if the T cell-paAPC interface flattens during the interaction, thereby increasing the synaptic contact area. The above calculation is for a non-absorbing T cell interacting with one paAPC. In our experiments, a T cell may simultaneously interact with several paAPCs, leading to the hypothesis that the cytokine concentration, because of accumulation at multiple interface points, maybe even further magnified. Transpresented IL-2 may enhance availability and binding of IL-2 to its receptor (7Malek T.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 26: 453-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 23Létourneau S. van Leeuwen E.M. Krieg C. Martin C. Pantaleo G. Sprent J. Surh C.D. Boyman O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 2171-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Given that IL-2 is released from paAPCs, it is possible that it may associate with the particle surface in a nonspecific manner and be presented rather than released, leading to the observed enhancement at nanoscale separations. To address the effect of non-diffusible, surface-presented IL-2 on T cell activation, IL-2 was biotinylated and immobilized on the surface of aAPCs without encapsulated IL-2. Biotinylation of IL-2 did not affect its functional activity (supplemental Fig. S2). Here the amount of IL-2 immobilized on paAPCs was varied from the total amount released with paAPCs to two orders of magnitude greater than that amount. As shown in Fig. 2, there was little or no enhancement in stimulation with surface-bound IL-2 aAPCs, and this result was similar to exogenous IL-2 addition (Fig. 2). Increasing the amount of IL-2 presented on the surface by two orders of magnitude (100 ng per mg of aAPC) over the amount released from paAPCs (1 ng per mg of particles) improved CD8+ T cell expansion (Fig. 2B) and T cell cytokine secretion (C) but was significantly lower than paAPC stimulation. Similarly, we observed no changes in the surface density of CD25 on T cells activated by presentation of IL-2 compared with exogenous delivery (Fig. 2D). The results demonstrate the importance of delivering IL-2 as a soluble paracrine factor, similar to its natural mode of action (24Huse M. Quann E.J. Davis M.M. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 1105-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Diffusion of IL-2 from a point source over time also leads to temporal gradients that may impact T cell function. IL-2 release from the paAPCs occurs in two distinct phases, a short burst phase of IL-2 (0–8 h) followed by a long sustained release phase that has both a lower slope (expressed as quantity of cytokine per time) and a smaller magnitude of cytokine released (Fig. 3A). These two phases occur because IL-2 is not homogeneously distributed in the particle, and a significant fraction is localized near the surface of the particle with the remainder entrapped in the core. Release from the surface is triggered upon aqueous exposure, and slow sustained release from the core takes place over time as the aqueous medium degrades the polymer, releasing entrapped IL-2. To investigate the importance of each phase on T cell stimulation, we stimulated cells with paAPCs that have been depleted of the burst IL-2 phase and compared the potency of these “released” particles with “fresh” particles for T cell activation and expansion. Particles denoted as released were suspended in PBS under constant rotation for 24 h to wash away the burst phase prior to T cell stimulation. The remaining IL-2 is denoted as R in Fig. 3A. Strikingly, released paAPCs expanded CD8+ T cells to a level that is 70% of that achieved with fresh paAPCs, despite the fact that released paAPCs deliver only about 20% as much IL-2 as fresh paAPCs (Fig. 3B). Cytokine secretion and up-regulation of CD25 were indistinguishable between released and fresh paAPCs (Fig. 3, C and D), signifying the importance of slow sustained paracrine delivery of IL-2 for effective stimulation. Though only a small amount of IL-2 is released during the sustained slow portion of the curve, this amount of cytokine is sufficient to mimic natural paracrine delivery. Our data point to the importance of high IL-2 interfacial transfer rates over prolonged periods as a key factor in the potency of the paAPC. We hypothesized that increasing the amount of exogenous IL-2 would at some high concentration produce similar effects to those resulting from paracrine IL-2 paAPCs. To test this hypothesis, we incubated paAPCs with T cells derived from wild-type mice and mice deficient in IL-2 production (IL-2−/−) to eliminate confounding variables introduced by the presence of other cells that may act as additional sources of IL-2. The amount of exogenous IL-2 added to the media at the start of the experiment was increased by up to 3 orders of magnitude with both cell types. Although10-fold and 100-fold higher concentrations of exogenous IL-2 increased stimulation, we found that 1000-fold more IL-2 was required to approximate the effects of paAPCs in terms of CD8+ expansion (Fig. 4A), cytokine secretion (B), and levels of CD25 on CD8+ T cells (C) in wild-type T cells. Interestingly, we did not observe this enhancement with additional exogenous IL-2 in IL-2−/− cells. Stimulation of IL-2−/− T cells was still far greater with paAPCs compared with a 1000-fold addition of exogenous IL-2 (Fig. 4, D–F). The data point to the fact that paAPCs facilitate stimulation (in the absence of other sources of IL-2) by an enhanced transfer rate and concentration gradients that cannot be mimicked by exogenous sources, even at high concentrations. Stimulation by paAPCs of a splenocyte culture in which similar fractions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are present results in a population of T cells that is skewed strongly toward the CD8+ phenotype (Fig. 5A). Given that CD4+ T cells are a primary source of IL-2, we dissected this preferential phenotypic expansion by purifying CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations and stimulated them separately with paAPCs. The results paralleled splenocyte (mixed CD4+ CD8+) observations. CD4+ T cells failed to proliferate substantially under all conditions, and CD8+ T cells expanded robustly with paAPCs (Fig. 5B). Purified CD8+ and CD4+ T cells mixed at defined ratios prior to stimulation by paAPCs showed the same trend. CD8+ T cells expansion showed a linear dependence on the initial frequency and hence was directly proportional to the starting concentration of CD8+ T cells, whereas CD4+ T cells expanded moderately irrespective of initial frequency (Fig. 5C). Given that CD8+ T cells can also produce small amounts of IL-2, we measured IL-2 secretion after 48 h of culture to ascertain whether the enhanced expansion was due to increased IL-2 production from stimulated CD8+ T cells. Fig. 5D shows that the level of IL-2 production after 48 h increases with increasing percentages of CD4+ T cells, and the opposite effect is seen for IFN-γ. This rules out the possibility that stimulation of CD8+ cells significantly increases their production of IL-2 and leads to the conclusion that the enhanced proliferation of CD8+ T cells is solely due to IL-2 delivery by paAPCs. These results also indicate that the proliferative patterns of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are not the result of killing of the CD4+ subset by CD8+ T cells (25Foulds K.E. Zenewicz L.A. Shedlock D.J. Jiang J. Troy A.E. Shen H. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1528-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) or competition for IL-2 but rather intrinsic properties of the CD8+ versus CD4+ T cells' responses to the intense IL-2 concentration gradient provided by paAPCs. The observed attenuation in the CD4+ T cell response compared with CD8+ T cells upon paracrine stimulation may be due to one or both of the following mechanisms: 1) CD4+ T cells are simply slower in activation and proliferation upon encounter with paAPCs, or 2) CD4+ T cells also activate and proliferate, but their numbers are reduced by programmed cell death. To determine whether CD4+ T cells divide in culture with paAPCs, BrdU incorporation was used to detect cellular division. Division of CD4+ and CD8+ cells was evident after 48 h in all aAPC and paAPC stimulations but was significantly higher when IL-2 was present (Fig. 6A). There was no significant difference in the percentage of CD4+ T cells engaged in cell division between the exogenous and paracrine IL-2 groups. To examine the number of divisions that occurred in each case, splenocytes were labeled with the cytoplasmic dye carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester prior to stimulation, and dilution of the dye was examined after 96 h. Although more CD8+ T cells were found to undergo extensive cell division after exposure to paracrine IL-2 versus exogenous IL-2 addition, CD4+ T cells showed similar but moderate cell division patterns regardless of treatment (Fig. 6B and supplemental Fig. S3), indicating that CD4+ T cells are responding to paAPCs by undergoing cell division under all conditions.

Serological studies are the most reliable way to measure influenza infection independent of symptoms. We reviewed all published serological studies that estimated the cumulative incidence of infection with pandemic influenza H1N1 2009 prior to the initiation of population-based vaccination against the pandemic strain.We searched for studies that estimated the cumulative incidence of pandemic influenza infection in the wider community. We excluded studies that did not include both pre- and post-pandemic serological sampling and studies that included response to vaccination. We identified 47 potentially eligible studies and included 12 of them in the review. Where there had been a significant first wave, the cumulative incidence of pandemic influenza infection was reported in the range 16%-28% in pre-school aged children, 34%-43% in school aged children and 12%-15% in young adults. Only 2%-3% of older adults were infected. The proportion of the entire population infected ranged from 11%-18%. We re-estimated the cumulative incidence to account for the small proportion of infections that may not have been detected by serology, and performed direct age-standardisation to the study population. For those countries where it could be calculated, this suggested a population cumulative incidence in the range 11%-21%.Around the world, the cumulative incidence of infection (which is higher than the cumulative incidence of clinical disease) was below that anticipated prior to the pandemic. Serological studies need to be routine in order to be sufficiently timely to provide support for decisions about vaccination."

The polarization of the Ly-α emission can, in principle, distinguish between the various options, but a previous attempt to detect this signature returned a null detection. Hayes et al. report observations of polarized Ly-α from the LAB1 nebula, the largest and most luminous of these objects. The central region of LAB1 shows no measurable polarization, but the polarized fraction increases to about 20% at a radius of 45 kiloparsecs. This suggests that the Ly-α photons must have been produced in the galaxies hosted within the nebula, and re-scattered by neutral hydrogen. High-redshift Lyman-α (Lyα) blobs1,2 are extended, luminous but rare structures that seem to be associated with the highest peaks in the matter density of the Universe3,4,5,6. Their energy output and morphology are similar to those of powerful radio galaxies7, but the source of the luminosity is unclear. Some blobs are associated with ultraviolet or infrared bright galaxies, suggesting an extreme starburst event or accretion onto a central black hole8,9,10. Another possibility is gas that is shock-excited by supernovae11,12. But not all blobs are associated with galaxies13,14, and these ones may instead be heated by gas falling into a dark-matter halo15,16,17,18,19. The polarization of the Lyα emission can in principle distinguish between these options20,21,22, but a previous attempt to detect this signature returned a null detection23. Here we report observations of polarized Lyα from the blob LAB1 (ref. 2). Although the central region shows no measurable polarization, the polarized fraction (P) increases to ∼20 per cent at a radius of 45 kiloparsecs, forming an almost complete polarized ring. The detection of polarized radiation is inconsistent with the in situ production of Lyα photons, and we conclude that they must have been produced in the galaxies hosted within the nebula, and re-scattered by neutral hydrogen."
https://openalex.org/W2032902038,"Single copy genes, universally distributed across the three domains of life and encoding mostly ancient parts of the translation machinery, are thought to be only rarely subjected to horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Indeed it has been proposed to have occurred in only a few genes and implies a rare, probably not advantageous event in which an ortholog displaces the original gene and has to function in a foreign context (orthologous gene displacement, OGD). Here, we have utilised an automatic method to identify HGT based on a conservative statistical approach capable of robustly assigning both donors and acceptors. Applied to 40 universally single copy genes we found that as many as 68 HGTs (implying OGDs) have occurred in these genes with a rate of 1.7 per family since the last universal common ancestor (LUCA). We examined a number of factors that have been claimed to be fundamental to HGT in general and tested their validity in the subset of universally distributed single copy genes. We found that differing functional constraints impact rates of OGD and the more evolutionarily distant the donor and acceptor, the less likely an OGD is to occur. Furthermore, species with larger genomes are more likely to be subjected to OGD. Most importantly, regardless of the trends above, the number of OGDs increases linearly with time, indicating a neutral, constant rate. This suggests that levels of HGT above this rate may be indicative of positively selected transfers that may allow niche adaptation or bestow other benefits to the recipient organism."
https://openalex.org/W2054076752,"The inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs) are critical regulators of apoptosis and other fundamental cellular processes. Many IAPs are RING domain-containing ubiquitin E3 ligases that control the stability of their interacting proteins. However, how IAP stability is regulated remains unclear. Here we report that USP19, a deubiquitinating enzyme, interacts with cellular IAP 1 (c-IAP1) and c-IAP2. Knockdown of USP19 decreases levels of both c-IAPs, whereas overexpression of USP19 results in a marked increase in c-IAP levels. USP19 effectively removes ubiquitin from c-IAPs in vitro, but it stabilizes c-IAPs in vivo mainly through deubiquitinase-independent mechanisms. The deubiquitinase activity is involved in the stabilization of USP19 itself, which is facilitated by USP19 self-association. Functionally, knockdown of USP19 enhances TNFα-induced caspase activation and apoptosis in a c-IAP1 and 2-dependent manner. These results suggest that the self-ubiquitin ligase activity of c-IAPs is inhibited by USP19 and implicate deubiquitinating enzymes in the regulation of IAP stability."

Recently we have shown that a group of macrodomain proteins, i.e. MacroD-like proteins, including human MacroD1, human MacroD2, Escherichia coli YmdB, and the sirtuin-linked SAV0325 protein from Staphylococcus aureus, function as OAADPr deacetylases, catalyzing the deacetylation of OAADPr to form ADP-ribose and acetate (9Chen D.

Mutagenesis and modeling of ADPr into the putative active site of MacroD1 suggested important roles for Asn-171, Asn-174, Asp-184, and His-188. Unlike other human macrodomain proteins, MacroD1 and MacroD2 contain no other known functional domains. The OAADPr deacetylation activity functionally links the MacroD-like proteins with the NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases, connecting metabolic regulation with chromatin structure and gene activity (5Till S.

It shares the least amino acid sequence similarity to the other MacroD-like proteins, among which human MacroD1 and MacroD2 are closely related and share more similarity to E. coli YmdB and the sirtuin-linked SAV0325 protein from S. aureus. The divergent amino acid sequence of C6orf130 makes it a distinct branch on the phylogenetic tree (9Chen D. Vollmar M. Rossi M.N. Phillips C. Kraehenbuehl R. Slade D. Mehrotra P.V. von Delft F.

C6orf130 transcription and expression are enriched in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells and in B-cells of the chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients when effective graft-versus-leukemia responses are achieved after donor lymphocyte infusion (24Marina O. Hainz U. Biernacki M.A. Zhang W. Cai A. Duke-Cohan J.S. Liu F. Brusic V. Neuberg D. Kutok J.L. Alyea E.P. Canning C.M. Soiffer R.J. Ritz J. Wu C.J. Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 1344-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). C6orf130 can therefore be used as a biomarker for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and for monitoring the effectiveness of adoptive immunotherapy for this disease. The high level expression of C6orf130 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia suggests the possibility of using C6orf130 as a potential immunogen for developing chronic lymphocytic leukemia-specific vaccines. A molecular understanding of the association of C6orf130 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia is not understood. In a recent proteomic analysis, the putative C6orf130 ortholog from Torpedo californica was identified in the electric organ (25Mate S.E. Brown K.J. Hoffman E.P. Skelet. Muscle. 2011; 1: 20Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular function of this distinct member of the macrodomain family, we investigated the catalytic and structural properties of human C6orf130. Here we report the solution structures of C6orf130 in the apo and ADPr bound states using NMR spectroscopy as well as the biochemical characterization of its catalytic properties. In this study we show that C6orf130 is a new member of the OAADPr deacetylase family that efficiently catalyzes the hydrolysis of OAADPr to produce ADP-ribose and free acetate. We also show that C6orf130 can catalyze the deacylation of ADPr derivatives with longer acyl chains, including O-propionyl-ADP-ribose (OPADPr) and O-butyryl-ADP-ribose (OBADPr), to produce ADPr and the corresponding acyl acids. To our knowledge, the C6orf130-ADPr NMR structure is the first of a binary macrodomain complex that harbors O-acyl-ADP-ribose deacylase activity, revealing key residues for substrate binding and catalysis. Structural analyses of C6orf130 in the apo and ADPr bound states indicate that the β5-α4 loop in the core macrodomain fold functions as a gate to sequester ADPr in the ligand-binding cleft. Based on structural, mutagenic, and catalytic studies, we propose a minimal catalytic mechanism for the deacylation reaction of O-acyl-ADP-ribose by C6orf130. Comparisons with the MacroD-like proteins indicate that the sequence variation within the macrodomain family permits a different set of catalytic residues to perform O-acyl-ADPr hydrolysis. Tritium-labeled acetyl-CoA was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). Synthetic peptide and acyl-peptides corresponding to the 11 amino acids surrounding lysine 14 of histone H3, H2N-KSTGGKAPRKQ-CONH2 (11-mer H3 peptide), H2N-KSTGGK(-acetyl)APRKQ-CONH2, H2N-KSTGGK(-propionyl)APRKQ-CONH2, H2N-KSTGGK(-n-butyryl)APRKQ-CONH2, were synthesized in the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center Peptide Synthesis Facility. Tritium-labeled acetyl H3 peptide, H2N-KSTGGK(3H-acetyl)APRKQ-CONH2, was synthesized enzymatically from the 11-mer H3 peptide and purified as described previously (26Borra M.T. O'Neill F.J.

Expression and purification of the His-tagged C6orf130 protein for enzymatic studies was achieved by transforming E. coli BL21(DE3) cells with the pDEST17 plasmid containing the C6orf130 gene insert and induction of mid-log phase cells (A600 = 0.7) with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 23 °C. Specific point mutations were created using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutated genes were sequenced at the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center DNA Sequencing Facility to ensure that only the desired mutations were introduced. All protein purification was performed at 4 °C or on ice as described previously. The purified protein aliquots were reconcentrated, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Enzyme activity assays for the deacylation of OAADPr, OPADPr, and OBADPr to ADPr and the corresponding acyl acids were performed by radioactive and HPLC methods using conditions as described (9Chen D.

Inhibition of C6orf130 activity by ADPr and the non-hydrolysable OAADPr analog N-acetyl-ADP-ribose (NAADPr) were assayed in reactions containing from 20 to 1600 μm O-3H-acetyl-ADP-ribose and 0.5 μm C6orf130 enzyme and ADPr concentrations ranging from 0 to 400 μm or NAADPr concentrations from 0 to 500 μm in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.3, at 23 °C. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme and terminated by mixing an aliquot of the reaction mixtures with 1.5 volumes of activated charcoal slurry at the desired time points. Inhibition was analyzed by measuring the initial forward rate of 3H-acetate formation as described (9Chen D. Vollmar M. Rossi M.N. Phillips C. Kraehenbuehl R. Slade D. Mehrotra P.V. von Delft F.

The initial velocity data were fitted and displayed using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). NMR samples of the C6orf130 gene product from Homo sapiens were initially prepared in a uniformly 13C,15N-labeled form according to wheat germ cell-free protocols described previously (29Vinarov D.A.

Briefly, the protein was expressed with an N-terminal His6 fusion tag in wheat germ extract supplemented with uniformly 13C,15N-labeled amino acids (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) and purified by metal affinity chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography as described previously (30Tyler R.C.

Samples prepared using cell-free protocols were used to solve the structure of apo-C6orf130. Additional NMR samples for ADPr titrations and structure determination of the ADPr-C6orf130 complex were prepared recombinantly in E. coil strain SG13009[pRPEP4] (Qiagen) using the pQE308HT vector as described previously (31Waltner J.K.

Briefly, cells were grown at 37 °C in M9 minimal broth containing 150 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin until reaching a cell density of A600 = 0.7. Protein expression was then induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. Cells were grown for another 5 h, harvested by centrifugation, and stored at −80 °C until processed further. Isotopically labeled proteins were prepared for NMR by supplementing the M9 medium with 15N-ammonium chloride and/or 13C-glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon source, respectively. Cells harvested from a 1-liter culture were lysed with a French pressure cell and purified by metal affinity chromatography using a previously published protocol with one modification (32Lytle B.L.

In place of a second round of metal affinity chromatography, the proteolytically cleaved His8 affinity tag was separated from C6orf130 using a Sephacryl S-100 size-exclusion chromatography column equilibrated with 50 mm bis-Tris, pH 6.5, and 200 mm sodium chloride. NMR samples were prepared in buffer containing 50 mm bis-Tris, pH 6.5, 200 mm sodium chloride, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 5–10% 2H2O. All NMR data were acquired at 25 °C on a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance CryoProbeTM and processed with NMRPipe software (33Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G.

ADPr (Sigma) was titrated incrementally into a sample containing 250 μm 15N-labeled C6orf130 and monitored by two-dimensional 15N,1H HSQC to confirm binding. Backbone 1H, 15N, and 13C chemical shift assignments for apo-C6orf130 were obtained automatically as described previously using a 550 μm sample of 15N,13C-labeled apo-C6orf130 (34Wang L. Markley J.L.

Side chain assignments were completed manually from three-dimensional HBHACONH, HCCONH, and HCCH total correlation spectroscopy and 13C (aromatic)-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra. Backbone and side chain assignments were transferred to the ADPr-C6orf130 complex by inspection and confirmed with three-dimensional HNCACB and HCCH total correlation spectroscopy acquired using a 800 μm sample of 15N,13C-labeled ADPr-C6orf130. Chemical shift assignments were ∼91 and ∼93% complete for the apo- and holoproteins, respectively. Heteronuclear NOE values were measured from an interleaved pair of two-dimensional 15N-1H sensitivity-enhanced correlation spectra recorded with and without a 5-s proton saturation period. The combined chemical shift difference for each residue was calculated as [((ΔδN/5)2 + (ΔδH)2)/2]1/2, where ΔδN and ΔδH are the 15N and 1HN chemical shift differences (ppm), respectively, between the two conditions. Distance constraints were obtained from three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY-HSQC and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra (τmix = 80 ms). The intermolecular distance constraints between C6orf130 and ADPr were obtained from a three-dimensional F1-13C-filtered/F3-13C-edited NOESY-HSQC spectrum (τmix = 120 ms) (36Stuart A.C.

Two of the human macrodomain proteins, MacroD1 and MacroD2, are structurally and functionally homologous and are closely related to bacterial YmdB proteins and to the sirtuin-linked protein SAV0325 from pathogenic bacterium S. aureus (supplemental Table S1). As a member of the macrodomain superfamily, C6orf130 shares minimal homology with the MacroD-like proteins including human MacroD1 and MacroD2 (Fig. 1a and supplemental Table S1). C6orf130 transcription and expression are enriched in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, suggesting that this protein might be a promising serological marker for this disease (24Marina O. Hainz U.

Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 1344-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To explore the molecular and biological functions of this unique macrodomain protein, we examined whether C6orf130 was capable of hydrolyzing OAADPr and other NAD+ metabolites derived from the sirtuin reaction. By incubating radiolabeled O-3H-acetyl-ADP-ribose with purified C6orf130 and analyzing the incubation mixture using radioactive charcoal binding and HPLC (9Chen D. Vollmar M. Rossi M.N. Phillips C.

Fig. 1b shows that the initial rates of OAADPr deacetylation catalyzed by C6orf130 depend on the concentration of OAADPr and exhibit saturation kinetics. An apparent Km of 182 ± 17 μm and a Vmax of 0.31 ± 0.03 s−1 at 23 °C were determined (Table 1). To investigate the substrate specificity and whether C6orf130 also possesses catalytic activity toward other sirtuin-derived NAD+ metabolites, we synthesized longer acyl derivatives of ADPr and used them as alternative substrates. Catalytic assays using the alternative substrates show that C6orf130 efficiently catalyzed the deacylation of OPADPr and OBADPr to form ADPr and propionate and butyrate, respectively. The deacylation of OPADPr and OBADPr by C6orf130 followed similar saturation kinetics. Increasing the acyl chains of O-acyl-ADPr only slightly increased the Km and decreased catalytic tur"

Recent studies suggest that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors promote pluripotency. Here, using H3K9ac ChIP followed by high throughput sequencing analyses and gene expression in E14 mouse ESCs before and after treatment with a low level of the HDAC inhibitor valproic acid, we show that H3K9ac is enriched at gene promoters and is highly correlated with gene expression and with various genomic features, including different active histone marks and pluripotency-related transcription factors. Curiously, it predicts the cellular location of gene products. Treatment of ESCs with valproic acid leads to a pervasive genome-wide and time-dependent increase in H3K9ac, but this increase is selectively suppressed after 4 h in H3K4me3/H3K27me3 bivalent genes. H3K9ac increase is dependent on the promoter's chromatin state and is affected by the binding of P300, various transcription factors, and active histone marks. This study provides insights into the genomic response of ESCs to a low level of HDAC inhibitor, which leads to increased pluripotency. The results suggest that a mild (averaging less than 40%) but global change in the chromatin state is involved in increased pluripotency and that specific mechanisms operate selectively in bivalent genes to maintain constant H3K9ac levels.

Aside from the hyperdynamic and loose nature of chromatin architectural proteins (2Meshorer E. Yellajoshula D. George E. Scambler P.J. Brown D.T. Misteli T. Dev.

Cell Biol. 2010; 22: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Generally, the ESC chromatin is enriched for histone modifications associated with transcriptional activation, such as acetylations of histones H3 and H4 (7Meshorer E. Misteli T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), trimethylations of H3K4 and H3K36, and dimethylation of H3K36 (4Efroni S. Duttagupta R. Cheng J. Dehghani H. Hoeppner D.J. Dash C. Bazett-Jones D.P. Le Grice S. McKay R.D. Buetow K.H. Gingeras T.R. Misteli T. Meshorer E. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 437-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). In addition, developmental genes in ESCs, termed “bivalent” genes, are marked by both active histone marks (i.e. trimethylated H3K4 and the repressive mark trimethylated H3K27) (8Azuara V. Perry P. Sauer S. Spivakov M. J⊘rgensen H.F. John R.M. Gouti M. Casanova M. Warnes G. Merkenschlager M. Fisher A.G. Nat.

Such domains tend to be located at the promoters of genes that are not expressed in ESCs and are thought to function in the silencing of developmental genes while keeping them poised for activation. embryonic stem cell H3K9, H3K27, and H3K36, histone H3 lysine 4, 9, 27, and 36, respectively H3K9 and H3K27 acetylation, respectively methylated and dimethylated H3K4, respectively H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and H3K36me3, trimethylated H3K4, H3K9, H3K27, and H3K36, respectively histone acetyltransferase histone deacetylase embryoid body valproic acid mouse embryonic fibroblast ChIP followed by high throughput sequencing transcription factor gene ontology neuronal progenitor cell. The level of histone acetylation is mediated by the activity of both histone acetyltransferases (HATs), which acetylate lysine residues of the N-terminal histone tails, and histone deacetylases (HDACs), which deacetylate these residues. Histone acetylation is involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes, including nucleosome assembly, chromatin folding, and transcriptional regulation (10Shahbazian M.D. Grunstein M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 75-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). Several studies published in the past several years have demonstrated the importance of adequate histone acetylation levels during development and particularly in ESC biology. First, HDAC1 knock-out mice die before embryonic day E10.5 (11Lagger G. O'Carroll D. Rembold M. Khier H. Tischler J. Weitzer G. Schuettengruber B. Hauser C. Brunmeir R. Jenuwein T. Seiser C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2672-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), HDAC1 knock-out ESCs show reduced proliferation and histone hyperacetylation (11Lagger G. O'Carroll D. Rembold M. Khier H. Tischler J. Weitzer G. Schuettengruber B. Hauser C. Brunmeir R. Jenuwein T. Seiser C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2672-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), and HDAC1 conditional knock-out ESCs show enhanced differentiation when induced to form embryoid bodies (EBs) (12Dovey O.M. Foster C.T. Cowley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 8242-8247Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Second, low levels of HDAC inhibitors are able to increase pluripotency and support self-renewal in ESCs (13Hezroni H. Tzchori I. Davidhi A. Mattout A. Biran A. Nissim-Rafinia M. Westphal H. Meshorer E. Nucleus. 2011; 2: 300-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 14Lee J.H. Hart S.R. Skalnik D.G. Genesis. 2004; 38: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 15Ware C.B.

Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), whereas higher levels of HDAC inhibitors accelerate ESC differentiation (16Karantzali E. Schulz H. Hummel O. Hubner N. Hatzopoulos A. Kretsovali A. Genome Biol. 2008; 9: R65Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 17Zhou Q.J. Xiang L.X. Shao J.Z. Hu R.Z. Lu Y.L. Yao H. Dai L.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 100: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). More specifically, the HDAC inhibitor valproic acid (VPA) has been reported to improve the reprogramming efficiency of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells in both mouse and human cells (18Huangfu D. Maehr R. Guo W. Eijkelenboom A. Snitow M. Chen A.E. Melton D.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 795-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar, 19Huangfu D. Osafune K. Maehr R. Guo W. Eijkelenboom A. Chen S. Muhlestein W. Melton D.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 1269-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Third, the levels of H3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) have been reported to be enriched in mouse and human ESCs compared with differentiated cells (4Efroni S. Duttagupta R. Cheng J. Dehghani H. Hoeppner D.J. Dash C. Bazett-Jones D.P. Le Grice S. McKay R.D. Buetow K.H. Gingeras T.R. Misteli T. Meshorer E. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 437-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 20Bártová E. Galiová G. Krejcí J. Harnicarová A. Strasák L. Kozubek S. Dev. Dyn. 2008; 237: 3690-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and to be globally reduced during endoderm-like differentiation of human ESCs (21Krejcí J. Uhlírová R. Galiová G. Kozubek S. Smigová J. Bártová E. J. Cell. Physiol. 2009; 219: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Finally, we recently showed that different HDAC inhibitors can restore pluripotency of the mouse ESC line E14, which has reduced H3K9 acetylation levels and a diminished potential to reprogram mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) when compared with other ESC lines (13Hezroni H. Tzchori I. Davidhi A. Mattout A. Biran A. Nissim-Rafinia M. Westphal H. Meshorer E. Nucleus. 2011; 2: 300-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). HDAC inhibition increased the pluripotency of E14 in conjunction with increased H3K9 acetylation levels to levels comparable with other ESC lines. To gain more insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie the association between pluripotency and H3K9 acetylation level and the increase in pluripotency and reprogramming capacity following HDAC inhibition, we assayed global gene expression and H3K9 acetylation state before and after treatment with a low level of VPA. We find that HDAC inhibition leads to a mild (averaging less than 40%) but global increase in H3K9 acetylation level in gene promoters, which is not accompanied by a global transcriptional activation. We also show that the increase in acetylation level is dependent on the chromatin state and correlates with the binding of P300 and various transcription factors and active histone marks. In this paper, we analyzed the results of gene expression microarrays and H3K9ac chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) in E14 mouse ESCs before and after 4 or 16 h of VPA treatments that we have previously performed (13Hezroni H. Tzchori I. Davidhi A. Mattout A. Biran A. Nissim-Rafinia M. Westphal H. Meshorer E. Nucleus. 2011; 2: 300-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). All sequencing and expression data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data repository under accession number GSE23958. Data were normalized with the robust multiarray average method, using Affymetrix Expression Console version 1.1. Genes were defined as differentially expressed if they showed a 1.5-fold or higher change in expression level in each of the two independent repeats, between the VPA-treated cells and the corresponding untreated cells. 50-bp reads generated by the SOLiD sequencer were aligned to the UCSC mm9 assembly of the mouse genome using Bowtie software, version 0.12.5 (22Langmead B. Trapnell C. Pop M. Salzberg S.L. Genome Biol. 2009; 10: R25Crossref PubMed Scopus (15054) Google Scholar), allowing for up to two mismatches. Only uniquely aligned reads were further analyzed. Genomic regions significantly enriched for H3K9ac were identified using CCAT (23Xu H. Handoko L. Wei X. Ye C. Sheng J. Wei C.L. Lin F. Sung W.K. Bioinformatics. 2010; 26: 1199-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), with a sliding window of 500 bp, an enrichment score cut-off of 3.0, and an FDR cut-off of 0.05. Intersections between the enriched regions of the three samples or between enriched regions to different genomic features (promoters, exons, and introns) were found using Galaxy (24Blankenberg, D.Von Kuster, G.Coraor, N.Ananda, G.Lazarus, R.Mangan, M.Nekrutenko, A.Taylor, J. (2010) Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol., Chapter 19, Unit 19.10, 11–21.Google Scholar). Read density heat maps of H3K9ac, H3K27ac, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3 around known transcriptional start sites (TSS) and enrichment values for each gene were calculated and generated using SeqMiner (25Ye T. Krebs A.R. Choukrallah M.A. Keime C. Plewniak F. Davidson I. Tora L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: e35Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Average ChIP enrichment signals over known TSSs were calculated and visualized using CEAS (26Shin H. Liu T. Manrai A.K. Liu X.S. Bioinformatics. 2009; 25: 2605-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). ChIP-seq data sets of histone modifications were downloaded from GEO under the following accession numbers: GSM281695 (H3K4me1), GSM281694 (H3K4me2), GSM307618 (H3K4me3), GSM307620 (H3K36me3), GSM307619 (H3K27me3), GSM307621 (H3K9me3), GSM307617 (ESC whole cell extract), and GSM594578 (H3K27ac) (27Creyghton M.P.

Nature. 2007; 448: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (3241) Google Scholar). For H3K27ac, raw reads were downloaded and aligned to the UCSC mm9 assembly of the mouse genome using Bowtie software, version 0.12.5 (22Langmead B. Trapnell C. Pop M. Salzberg S.L. Genome Biol. 2009; 10: R25Crossref PubMed Scopus (15054) Google Scholar), allowing for up to two mismatches. For the other histone modifications, aligned reads were downloaded and converted from mm8 to mm9 using Galaxy lift-over. Genomic regions enriched for H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K36me, and H3K9me3 compared with whole cell extract sample were identified using MACS (30Zhang Y. Liu T. Meyer C.A. Eeckhoute J. Johnson D.S. Bernstein B.E. Nusbaum C. Myers R.M. Brown M. Li W. Liu X.S. Genome Biol. 2008; 9: R137Crossref PubMed Scopus (8610) Google Scholar) with a p value cut-off of 1 × 10−5. P300 binding sites were downloaded (27Creyghton M.P. Cheng A.W. Welstead G.G. Kooistra T. Carey B.W. Steine E.J. Hanna J. Lodato M.A. Frampton G.M. Sharp P.A. Boyer L.A. Young R.A. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 21931-21936Crossref PubMed Scopus (2509) Google Scholar) and converted from mm8 to mm9 using Galaxy lift-over. To compare H3K9ac levels in selected genomic regions between the three ESCs lines used in these previous studies (E14, V6.5, and R1 mouse ESCs), we performed ChIP-real-time PCR for H3K9ac for two genic regions and one intergenic region and found that H3K9ac levels were comparable between the three different lines (supplemental Fig. S1). To further validate increased H3K9ac following VPA, we also compared these same regions in E14 ESCs before and after 16 h of VPA treatment and found an excellent agreement with the ChIP-seq data (supplemental Fig. S1). Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were grown with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Biological Industries), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Biological Industries), and 2 mm l-glutamine (Biological Industries). To prevent proliferation, MEFs were treated with 10 μg/μl mitomycin C (Holland-Moran) for 3 h. MEFs were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2. We used three mouse ESC lines: R1, V6.5, and E14tg2a (E14) cells, all available at ATCC. All ESCs were grown on a feeder layer of mitomycin C-treated MEFs on 0.2% gelatin-coated cell culture dishes. Culture medium consisted of DMEM, 15% ES-grade fetal calf serum (FCS, Biological Industries), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Biological Industries), 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids (Biological Industries), 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and 1000 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor. ESCs were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and fed with fresh media every day. For differentiation, ESCs were plated on bacterial culture dishes without leukemia inhibitory factor for 4 days to allow for EB formation. EBs were replated on tissue culture plates coated with poly-l-ornithine (Sigma) and fibronectin (R&D Systems) in DMEM/F-12 medium (Sigma) supplemented with ITS (5 mg/ml insulin, 50 mg/ml transferrin, 30 nm selenium chloride; Invitrogen) and 5 mg/ml fibronectin. For HDAC inhibitor treatment, cells were grown in the presence of VPA (catalog no. P4543, Sigma) at a final concentration of 0.5 mm for either 4 or 16 h. Changes in pathway activity during ESC differentiation were analyzed using an algorithm that evaluates the interaction structure across predefined canonical networks (31Efroni S. Schaefer C.F. Buetow K.H. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e425Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In order to score the activity of a certain pathway, the algorithm evaluates the status of all of the input genes of each interaction in the pathway (based on microarray data) and determines the probability of the materialization of the interaction as the joint probabilities of all input genes. The final activity score of a pathway is an average of the scores of all interactions. This algorithm was applied to a data set of gene expression of three different mouse ESC lines at 11 time points during the differentiation into EBs (32Hailesellasse Sene K. Porter C.J. Palidwor G. Perez-Iratxeta C. Muro E.M. Campbell P.A. Rudnicki M.A. Andrade-Navarro M.A. BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 85Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) in order to score the activity and consistency of 288 known pathways indexed in the Pathway Interaction Database (33Schaefer C.F. Anthony K. Krupa S. Buchoff J. Day M. Hannay T. Buetow K.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D674-D679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). To determine the genomic distribution pattern of acetylated H3K9 in E14 mouse ESCs, we performed ChIP-seq of H3K9ac using SOLiD sequencing. The read density spanning 5 kb of TSSs of 20,500 genes from the Refseq database was compared with that of another histone acetylation, H3K27ac (27Creyghton M.P. Cheng A.W. Welstead G.G. Kooistra T. Carey B.W. Steine E.J. Hanna J. Lodato M.A. Frampton G.M. Sharp P.A. Boyer L.A. Young R.A. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 21931-21936Crossref PubMed Scopus (2509) Google Scholar), and with known promoter-associated histone marks, including H3K4me2, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3 (28Meissner A. Mikkelsen T.S. Gu H. Wernig M. Hanna J. Sivachenko A. Zhang X. Bernstein B.E. Nusbaum C. Jaffe D.B. Gnirke A. Jaenisch R. Lander E.S. Nature. 2008; 454: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar, 29Mikkelsen T.S. Ku M. Jaffe D.B. Issac B. Lieberman E. Giannoukos G. Alvarez P. Brockman W. Kim T.K. Koche R.P. Lee W. Mendenhall E. O'Donovan A. Presser A. Russ C. Xie X. Meissner A. Wernig M. Jaenisch R. Nusbaum C. Lander E.S. Bernstein B.E. Nature. 2007; 448: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (3241) Google Scholar). k-Means clustering of the TSS regions and heat map visualization were performed using seqMINER (25Ye T. Krebs A.R. Choukrallah M.A. Keime C. Plewniak F. Davidson I. Tora L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: e35Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). These analyses revealed an enrichment of H3K9ac at the TSS regions of almost half of the genes (Fig. 1A). H3K9ac signal at these regions highly correlated with that of H3K27ac, H3K4me2, and H3K4me3 (Fig. 1A). Genes that were marked by both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 (bivalent genes) had very low levels of H3K9ac. Both the read density heat map and the average profile at the region spanning 3 kb of TSSs (Fig. 1B) showed two major peaks of H3K9ac near the TSS, one 500 bp upstream and one 500 bp downstream of the TSS. In addition, high correlation was observed between H3K9 acetylation level and gene expression level, measured using Affymetrix gene expression microarrays (R2 = 0.695) (Fig. 1C), in agreement with the presence of H3K9ac in promoters of active genes occupied by activating transcription factors (TFs) (10Shahbazian M.D. Grunstein M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 75-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). To identify the genes and genomic regions that are associated with increased pluripotency of E14 mouse ESCs following HDAC inhibition, we also performed ChIP-seq for H3K9ac in E14 cells treated with 0.5 mm VPA for either 4 or 16 h. Genomic regions significantly enriched for H3K9ac compared with the input sample were identified using CCAT (23Xu H. Handoko L. Wei X. Ye C. Sheng J. Wei C.L. Lin F. Sung W.K. Bioinformatics. 2010; 26: 1199-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) for each of the three samples. The number of identified regions significantly increased after both 4 and 16 h of VPA treatment, at different chromosomes and genomic features, implying a global increase in acetylation of H3K9 following HDAC inhibition (Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. S2). In addition, the average profile at the region spanning 3 kb of TSSs also significantly increased after the treatments, implying an increase in H3K9ac at promoter regions (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, microarray analyses of gene expression before and after VPA treatment showed that the treatment had almost no effect on expression levels, despite the increased H3K9 acetylation levels at promoter regions (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). After 4 h of VPA treatment, 77 genes were up-regulated and 26 were down-regulated, whereas after 16 h, 39 genes were up-regulated and 37 were down-regulated (supplemental Table S1). One of the genes that were down-regulated after 16 h was KAT2B, an H3 lysine acetyltransferase and a member of several transcriptional activators. This might explain the decrease in the number of up-regulated genes between 4 and 16 h. To calculate a single H3K9 acetylation enrichment value for each gene, the number of reads at each promoter (defined as the region between 1 kb upstream and 1 kb downstream of the TSS) was counted and normalized to the input sample using seqMINER (25Ye T. Krebs A.R. Choukrallah M.A. Keime C. Plewniak F. Davidson I. Tora L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: e35Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Comparison of the treated and untreated samples revealed that the acetylation level of H3K9 increased only mildly (i.e. averaging less than 20 and 40% for the 4 and 16 h time points, respectively) but across almost the entire set of genes (Fig. 1, A and B). In addition, we found that the response to VPA was different for promoters with different initial acetylation levels. Although the HDAC inhibition hardly had any effect on promoters that were not acetylated before the treatment (enrichment value of around 0), the treatment significantly increased the acetylation level of H3K9 at promoters that were acetylated at intermediate level (enrichment value of around 1.5). In genes that were initially highly acetylated (enrichment value larger than 3), the acetylation level decreased after 4 h and did not change significantly after 16 h (Fig. 2, A–D, and supplemental Fig. S4). The distribution of change in acetylation level was significantly higher after 16 h of VPA treatment than after 4 h (p ≪ 10−10, two-tailed t test) (Fig. 2E), indicating that the effect of VPA treatment on H3K9 acetylation level is larger after 16 h. The different response to HDAC inhibition in different genes might result from a different chromatin state, which either supports or prevents recruitment of various chromatin-modifying enzymes, such as HATs. In order to characterize the chromatin state of genes with different initial H3K9 acetylation levels, we compared the initial acetylation level with a genome-wide map of sites that are hypersensitive to DNase I digestion, previously generated for mouse ESCs using DNase-seq (35Schnetz M.P. Handoko L. Akhtar-Zaidi B. Bartels C.F. Pereira C.F. Fisher A.G. Adams D.J. Flicek P. Crawford G.E. Laframboise T. Tesar P. Wei C.L. Scacheri P.C. PLoS Genet. 2010; 6: e1001023Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Promoters that were highly acetylated on H3K9 overlapped with sites that are highly sensitive to DNase I digestion (Fig. 3A), indicating an open chromatin conformation at the promoters of these genes. Moreover, the increase in acetylation level following VPA treatment was higher for genes with higher DNase I hypersensitivity scores (Fig. 3B), indicating that open chromatin increases the potential of promoters to undergo increased acetylation after HDAC inhibition. Promoters that were associated with the top 10% of DNase I-hypersensitive sites showed a significant increase in H3K9 acetylation even at low initial acetylation levels (supplemental Fig. S5A). This suggests that the acetylation level of most genes with low initial acetylation levels does not increase after HDAC inhibition, probably due to a condensed chromatin structure. On the contrary, promoters that did not overlap with any DNase I-hypersensitive sites showed a significant decrease in acetylation after the treatment (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. S5B). To test whether the recruitment of a specific HAT, P300, affects the response of different genes to HDAC inhibition, we compared the acetylation level of H3K9 before and after the treatments with a genome-wide map of P300 binding sites, previously generated for mouse ESCs using ChIP-seq (27Creyghton M.P. Cheng A.W. Welstead G.G. Kooistra T. Carey B.W. Steine E.J. Hanna J. Lodato M.A. Frampton G.M. Sharp P.A. Boyer L.A. Young R.A. Jaenisch R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 21931-21936Crossref PubMed Scopus (2509) Google Scholar). The percentage of genes whose promoter regions overlapped with P300 peaks increased from 6% for genes that were not H3K9-acetylated to 71% for genes with a high H3K9 acetylation level (Fig. 3C). This suggests that P300 has a role in acetylating H3K9 in gene promoters in mouse ESCs. Binding by P300 also affected the potential of a given promoter to be hyperacetylated following VPA treatment; the distribution of change in acetylation level was significantly higher for genes bound by P300 than for unbound genes, both after 4 and 16 h of VPA treatment (p ≪ 10−10, two-tailed t test) (Fig. 3, D and E). Similar to DNase I-hypersensitive promoters, promoters bound by P300 also showed a significant increase in acetylation even at low initial acetylation levels (supplemental Fig. S6A). However, no significant difference between genes that were not bound by P300 to the entire set of genes was observed at different initial acetylation levels (supplemental Fig. S6B), suggesting that other HATs are also involved in determining the initial H3K9ac level and affecting the response of the cells to HDAC inhibition. Taken together, these data suggest that the initial H3K9ac level at a given promoter influences the recruitment of P300 and other HATs to that promoter following HDAC inhibition (probably by conferring an accessible chromatin structure), thereby further increasing histone acetylation. In a previously published study (36Chen X. Xu H. Yuan P. Fang F. Huss M. Vega V.B. Wong E. Orlov Y.L. Zhang W. Jiang J. Loh Y.H. Yeo H.C. Yeo Z.X. Narang V. Govindarajan K.R. Leong B. Shahab A.

The role of diversity in ecosystems is pivotal, because species richness can be both a cause and a consequence of primary production. However, the mechanisms behind the varying productivity-diversity relationships (PDR) remain poorly understood. Moreover, large-scale studies on PDR across taxa are urgently needed. Here, we examined the relationships between resource supply and phyto-, bacterio-, and zooplankton richness in 100 small boreal lakes. We studied the PDR locally within the drainage systems and regionally across the systems. Second, we studied the relationships between resource availability, species richness, biomass and resource ratio (N∶P) in phytoplankton communities using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) for testing the multivariate hypothesis of PDR. At the local scale, the PDR showed variable patterns ranging from positive linear and unimodal to negative linear relationships for all planktonic groups. At the regional scale, PDRs were significantly linear and positive for phyto- and zooplankton. Phytoplankton richness and the amount of chlorophyll a showed a positive linear relationship indicating that communities consisting of higher number of species were able to produce higher levels of biomass. According to the SEM, phytoplankton biomass was largely related to resource availability, yet there was a pathway via community richness. Finally, we found that species richness at all trophic levels was correlated with several environmental factors, and was also related to richness at the other trophic levels. This study showed that the PDRs in freshwaters show scale-dependency. We also documented that the PDR complies with the multivariate model showing that plant biomass is not mirroring merely the resource availability, but is also influenced by richness. This highlights the need for conserving diversity in order to maintain ecosystem processes in freshwaters."

Two diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGATs 1 and 2) can catalyze the final step in the synthesis of TAG from diacylglycerol, which has been suggested to play an important role in the transfer of the glyceride moiety across the endoplasmic reticular membrane for (re)synthesis of TAG on the lumenal aspect of the endoplasmic reticular (ER) membrane (Owen, M., Corstorphine, C. C., and Zammit, V. A. (1997) Biochem. J. 323, 17–21). Recent topographical studies suggested that the oligomeric enzyme DGAT1 is exclusively lumen facing (latent) in the ER membrane. By contrast, in the present study, using two specific inhibitors of human DGAT1, we present evidence that DGAT1 has a dual topology within the ER of HepG2 cells, with approximately equal DGAT1 activities exposed on the cytosolic and lumenal aspects of the ER membrane. This was confirmed by the observation of the loss of both overt (partial) and latent (total) DGAT activity in microsomes prepared from livers of Dgat1−/− mice. Conformational differences between DGAT1 molecules having the different topologies were indicated by the markedly disparate sensitivities of the overt DGAT1 to one of the inhibitors. These data suggest that DGAT1 belongs to the family of oligomeric membrane proteins that adopt a dual membrane topology.

Hypertriglyceridemia is a key biomarker for the metabolic/insulin resistance syndrome and for associated morbidities, including type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (1Gotto Jr., A.M. Am. J. Cardiol. 1998; 82: 22Q-25QAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, excessive accumulation of triglycerides in cytoplasmic lipid droplets results in hepatic steatosis, now recognized as being associated, possibly causatively, with whole body insulin resistance, and which may progress to nonalcoholic fatty liver or steatohepatitis (2Zammit V.A.

Diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGATs) catalyze the final reaction of TAG synthesis. Two distinct gene products, DGAT1 and DGAT2, that catalyze most of tissue TAG synthesis have been described (4Cases S. Smith S.J. Zheng Y.W. Myers H.M. Lear S.R. Sande E. Novak S. Collins C.

In the present study, we have used two specific inhibitors (which belong to different chemical classes of compounds) of human DGAT1, in combination with the selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane and the ER membrane of whole hepatocytes, to study the sidedness of the active site of the enzyme in situ in HepG2 cells. Our previously described model of hepatic TAG synthesis and secretion (6Zammit V.A. Buckett L.K. Turnbull A.V. Wure H. Proven A. Pharmacol. Ther. 2008; 118: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was based on observations that (i) only a minority of secreted triglyceride (∼20%) is incorporated into VLDL without prior hydrolysis (24Bell R.M. Ballas L.M. Coleman R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1981; 22: 391-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) during the co-translational insertion of apoB through the ER membrane to form nascent particles in the first step of lipoprotein assembly (7Olofsson S.O. Asp L. Borén J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), (ii) that most newly synthesized TAG is diverted to cytosolic lipid droplets, and (iii) that the hydrolysis of this TAG prior to its assembly into VLDL proceeds only to partial glycerides (8Lankester D. Brown A. Zammit V. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1889-1895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equilibration of diacylglycerol across the ER membrane provides the main route through which the acylglycerol moiety is transferred to the secretory pathway. For diglycerides to play this role, DGAT activity would have to be distributed on both aspects of the ER membrane (6Zammit V.A. Buckett L.K. Turnbull A.V. Wure H. Proven A. Pharmacol. Ther. 2008; 118: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 9Owen M.R. Corstorphine C.C. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 24Bell R.M. Ballas L.M. Coleman R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1981; 22: 391-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to enable the re-synthesis of TAG on the lumenal aspect of the membrane. This was shown to be the case through the demonstration of “overt” and “latent” DGAT activities of approximately equal magnitude in intact microsomes isolated from rat liver (9Owen M.R. Corstorphine C.C. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In accordance with this model, we demonstrated that rat liver microsomes express both overt and latent DGAT activities of similar magnitude on the cytosolic and lumenal aspects of the ER membrane, respectively (9Owen M.R. Corstorphine C.C. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We also described how the relative expression of the two activities varies with physiological (11Waterman I.J. Price N.T. Zammit V.A. J.

Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1708-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This pathway may also account for the remodeling of TAG that occurs particularly in the sn-3 position before it is secreted (9Owen M.R. Corstorphine C.C. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, the positional distribution of acyl chains within TAG molecules differs markedly between intrahepatic and VLDL-TAG, indicating that the extensive hydrolysis-resynthesis cycling between TAG and diacylglycerol serves to remodel TAG before secretion (13Yang L.Y. Kuksis A. Myher J.J. Steiner G. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 125-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent data from several other laboratories have supported our model. Thus, the involvement of the ancillary transport of acylcarnitine across the ER membrane for the provision of long-chain acyl-CoA in the ER lumenal compartment necessary for the (re)synthesis of TAG from diacylglycerol delivered from the cytosol across the ER was experimentally established (14Broadway N.

Recently, overexpression of tagged and mutated murine DGAT1 and DGAT2 has been used to elucidate their membrane topology, in separate studies. The data on DGAT1 (18McFie P.J. Stone S.L. Banman S.L.

In the present study we provide evidence that contrasts with this conclusion. We show that the activity due to DGAT1 is expressed on both the cytosolic (overt) and lumenal (latent) aspects of the ER membrane, and that the two activities can be distinguished through differential sensitivity to the two specific inhibitors used. In addition, studies using liver microsomes prepared from Dgat1−/− mice showed that DGAT1 is normally expressed on both aspects of the ER membrane, and also confirmed the results from overexpression studies (see Refs. 19Stone S.J.

Alamethicin, essentially fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA), d-mannose 6-phosphate, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol, oleoyl-coenzyme A lithium salt, lactate dehydrogenase, sodium cacodylate, dithiothreitol, and the lipid standards, glyceryl triolate, and oleic acid were purchased from Sigma. Digitonin was purchased from Fischer Scientific. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates (LK6D 19 channel) were purchased from VWR-Jencons, UK. Tissue culture media were from Invitrogen. All other chemicals used were of analytical grade. Radiolabeled 1-[14C]oleoyl-CoA (50 μCi/μmol) and [3H]glycerol (10 mCi/μmol were obtained from Amersham Biosciences (GE Healthcare UK Ltd.). The two inhibitors of DGAT activity used were synthesized by Astra Zeneca. The structural formula of inhibitor compound A (iA) is 2-((1s,4s)-4-(4-(4-amino-7,7-dimethyl-7H-pyrimido[4,5-b][1,4]oxazin-6-yl)phenyl)cyclohexyl)aceticacid, and its use as a DGAT1 inhibitor has been described in Ref. 22Herker E.

The formula of compound B (iB) is cis-4-{3-fluoro-4-[({5-[(4-fluorophenyl)amino]-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl}carbonyl)amino]phenoxy}cyclohexanecarboxylic acid. The structures of the two compounds are given in Fig. 1. Male Wistar rats (200–250 g) were from Charles River Laboratories, Essex UK, and Dgat1−/− mice were sourced from Jackson Laboratories. They were fed a standard rodent chow diet. The animals were killed by CO2 anesthesia followed by cervical dislocation. The liver was dissected from rats or mice, and immediately chilled in ice-cold homogenization buffer (MI buffer, containing 300 mm sucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). Homogenization (10–15 strokes) was performed using loose-fitting Potter-Elvenheijm Teflon-glass homogenizers cooled by immersion in ice water. The initial homogenate was centrifuged twice at 2,000 and 12,000 × g to sediment unbroken cells, nuclei, and mitochondria. The postmitochondrial fraction was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C to sediment the microsomes. The resulting microsomal pellet was suspended in MI buffer, to ∼20 mg of protein/ml, and stored at −80°C in aliquots. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method, using BSA as standard. Insect membranes expressing human recombinant DGAT1 or DGAT2 protein were prepared as in Refs. 4Cases S.

For hDGAT1 the plasmid prepared from I.M.A.G.E. clone 412631 containing the coding sequence for human DGAT1 (EMBL accession number AF059202) was used as the PCR template. The primers were: forward, 5′0GGGGAATTCGCGGGCTGAGGCCATGGGCGACCGCGGC-3′ and reverse, 5′-GAGAAGCTTGGCCCTCAGGTGCAGCTCAGGCCT-3′. The PCR was performed using 100 ng of plasmid template DNA, 50 pmol each of the two primers, 200 μm dNTPs, and 0.5 μl of Herculase Hot Start Taq polymerase. The resultant PCR product was gel-purified and ligated into the pFASTBAC expression plasmid (Invitrogen) as an EcoRI fragment. The coding sequence was verified, and its correct orientation with respect to the coding promoter was performed through PstI digestion. For hDGAT2 the cloning template was prepared by converting 5 μg of total RNA isolated from the HepG2 cell line into first strand cDNA using the SuperScript preamplification kit (Invitrogen). The resultant cDNA was diluted 1:5, and 1 μl was used as a template in a 50-μl PCR. The PCR primers were: forward, 5′-CGGAATTCAGCCATGAAGACCCTCATAG-3′ and reverse, 5′-CCGAATTCTGGCTCAGTTCACCTCCAGGACC-3′. The PCR was performed using 1 μl of cDNA template, 50 pmol each of the forward and reverse primers, 200 μm dNTPs, and 0.5 μl of Herculase Hot Start Taq polymerase. The resultant PCR product was gel-purified and ligated into the pFASTBAC expression plasmid (Invitrogen) as an EcoRI-HindIII fragment. The resultant construct was sequence verified to confirm that the coding region was identical to the sequence quoted in the EMBL accession data base. Cell pellets of known weight were re-suspended gently in 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.0) and centrifuged twice at 200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pellets were re-suspended in STE buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA (disodium salt), pH 7.4), at a ratio of 2 ml of buffer per g wet weight of membranes. The re-suspended pellets were homogenized by 10 passages through a 2-gauge needle using a 10-ml syringe, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g (at 4 °C for 60 min). The resultant membrane pellets were re-suspended in STE buffer and the protein concentration was quantified using the Bradford protein assay method. The human hepatoma cell line HepG2, and the rat hepatoma cell line McA-RH7777 were purchased from the EACC. HepG2 cells were cultured routinely in RPMI 1640 medium (with added 2.5 mm l-glutamine) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). McA-RH7777 cells were cultured in DMEM containing l-glutamine (2.5 mm) and supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were grown in an incubator at 37 °C in a water-saturated 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cell media were changed every 3–4 days and cells were passaged when they became 80–90% confluent, using the same medium containing 2.5 mg of trypsin/ml and 0.1 mm EDTA to detach them. Aliquots (containing 2 × 106 cells) of trypsin-detached and washed cells were incubated, for known periods of time, with 2 ml of artificial “cytoskeleton” (CSK) medium (23Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9166-9175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing increasing concentrations of digitonin (up to 60 μg/ml as indicated) to permeabilize their plasma membrane, as described in Ref. 23Adeli K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9166-9175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. After the preliminary experiments were performed to find the optimal concentration of digitonin, routine incubations were performed in the presence of 30 μg of digitonin/ml followed, after washing, by incubation with 20 μg of alamethacin/ml, to effect the additional permeabilization of the ER membrane. Total amounts of cytosolic or intra-ER markers were achieved by addition of 1% Triton X-100 to cell suspensions. At the end of the incubation period, the cells were either sedimented and the supernatant used to measure the released cytosolic markers, or used directly to measure the activity of ER-lumenal enzyme activity. The assay mixture contained 50 mm sodium cacodylate (pH 6.6), 0.2 m sucrose, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm mannose 6-phosphate, and 10 mg/ml of defatted BSA. Aliquots (30 μl) of the assay buffer were pre-equilibrated at 37 °C and the assay was initiated by the addition of 125 μl of a suspension containing ∼180 μg of cellular or microsomal protein (9Owen M.R. Corstorphine C.C. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Permeabilized cells that had been previously treated with digitonin (30 μg/ml) to permeabilize the plasma membrane were assayed for mannose-6-phosphatase activity before or after treatment with alamethicin (20 μg/ml in DMSO) aimed at permeabilizing the ER membranes to the substrate of the reaction (mannose 6-phosphate). The reactions were stopped by addition of 125 μl of 20% perchloric acid. The denatured protein was removed by centrifugation, and the amount of inorganic phosphate formed was quantified by addition of an aliquot (200 μl) of the reaction supernatant to 50 μl of inorganic phosphate color reagent (acidic ammonium molybdate-ferrous sulfate mixture), followed by quantification of the absorbance at 700 nm. Routinely, overt DGAT activity of HepG2 and McA-RH7777 cells was measured in situ by carrying out the DGAT assay using cells permeabilized solely by low concentrations of digitonin (30 μg/ml) for 30 min at 0 °C. Latent DGAT activity was measured in HepG2 cells that were further incubated with 20 μg of alamethicin/ml for 30 min at 0 °C. All incubations were for 30 min at 0 °C. Isolated microsomes obtained from rat or mouse livers were used intact (for overt activity) or after permeabilization with alamethicin when total (overt plus latent) DGAT activity was to be measured. The difference between total DGAT activity and overt DGAT activity represented latent DGAT activity. DGAT activity was measured by quantifying the incorporation of [1-14C]oleoyl-CoA into [14C]triacylglycerol in the presence of the second substrate 1,2-dioleoylglycerol. Preliminary experiments were performed to ascertain that the assay was linear with time and amounts of microsomal and cell protein, and that no DGAT activity was detectable when HepG2 cells were intact. The final assay conditions were as follows: 50 μm [1-14C]oleoyl-CoA (2.2 × 104 dpm/nmol), 500 μm 1,2-diacylglycerol delivered in ethanol (final concentration of ethanol 0.25%), 2.5 mg/ml of BSA, 0.6% DMSO, in 125 mm Tris-HCl buffer (adjusted to pH 7.4 using KOH at 37 °C) containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 250 mm sucrose, and 20 μg of microsomal protein in a volume of 25 μl. Radioactive TAG formation increased linearly for at least the first 5 min, and also had a linear relationship with the amount of protein in the microsomal or permeabilized cell fractions assayed, respectively. Dioleoylglycerol (added in ethanol, see above) was vortexed into aliquots containing the assay buffer and the microsomal protein, and incubated at 37 °C for 3 min in a shaking heating block to warm the reaction mixture. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the radioactive oleoyl-CoA substrate, and was terminated after 3 min by the addition of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). After vigorous shaking, the chloroform layer was aspirated into a glass tube and dried under a stream of N2 gas. The dried material was re-solubilized in chloroform (200 μl) and the entire volume was applied to TLC plates coated with Silica Gel 60 for separation of the radioactive triglyceride product from the oleoyl-CoA substrate, using hexane/diethyl ether/formic acid (70:30:1, v/v/v) as the mobile phase. A triglyceride standard (triolein, 10 nmol) was used to identify the position of the triglyceride band after lipid separation. Lipid bands were visualized using iodine vapor. The radioactivity of each band was quantified after scraping into scintillation vials, followed by addition of 4 ml of UltimaGold scintillant (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and quantification of the associated 14C radioactivity using a scintillation counter. In assays investigating the effect of either of the two hDGAT1 inhibitor compounds (iA and iB) on DGAT activity, these were added in DMSO; the final concentration of the solvent was kept constant at 0.6% of the total assay volume. Incubations of microsomes or cells (previously incubated in the absence/presence of digitonin/alamethacin) with the inhibitors were performed on ice for 5 min prior to starting the DGAT assay. Preliminary experiments on the DMSO tolerance of the assay showed that, at the final concentration (0.6%) of DMSO used, there was no effect on DGAT activity or microsomal membrane integrity. All assays were performed in duplicate on the number of separate preparations indicated in the figure legends. Confluent HepG2 or McA-RH7777 cells were detached by trypsinization and incubated on ice in CSK buffer (see above) containing 30 μg of digitonin/ml for 30 min on ice, to expose the overt DGAT activity. They were then sedimented by light centrifugation and resuspended in CSK buffer to wash off the digitonin, followed by gentle sedimentation. They were used either directly (for measurement of overt DGAT activity) or after re-suspension and a further 30-min incubation on ice with CSK buffer containing 20 μg/ml of alamethacin, to expose latent DGAT activity. Alamethacin is a small peptide that forms oligomers that align perpendicularly to the membrane, and in the process, create pores therein. Two inhibitors of human DGAT1 activity were used (see “Materials”); they were dissolved separately in DMSO and serial dilutions were dispensed into a 96-well plate in duplicate. Final assay conditions in the reaction mixture were: 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm diacylglycerol, 0.03 mm oleoyl-CoA, and [1-14C]oleoyl-CoA (0.1 μCi/μmol). Final insect membrane protein concentrations were 4.2 μg/ml for DGAT1 and 30 μg/ml for DGAT2 assays, contained in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Reactions were carried out in 96-well plates for 30 min at 22 °C and initiated by addition of 40 μl of the 1-[14C]oleoyl-CoA-BSA. Assays were terminated by addition of an aliquot of a mixture of 2-propanol and heptane (7:1, v/v) followed by 5 μl of bromphenol blue, 20 μl of carrier lipid mixture (50 μg of triolein and 50 μg of oleic acid in heptane), 100 μl of 0.1 m carbonate buffer (pH 9.5), and 10 μl of [3H]triolein (∼10,000 dpm in heptane) as an internal standard, to enable the recovery of extracted triglyceride to be determined. The [14C]triglyceride product formed during the DGAT assay was extracted into the heptane layer, from which a 150-μl aliquot was transferred to a scintillation vial for the quantification of the associated radioactivity. The ethanol used to deliver the dioleoylglycerol (final concentration 5 mm, see above) in the DGAT assay mixture acted as one of the substrates for acyl-CoA:ethanol O-acyltransferase activity (AEAT), thus enabling the simultaneous quantification of AEAT and DGAT activities. Measurement of the activity of this marker enzyme after incubation of cells or membranes in the absence or presence of alamethacin in the same assay as that of DGAT enabled us to determine, simultaneously, the degree of intactness of the individual microsomal membrane preparations, as AEAT is known to be exclusively latent in its ER distribution (24Bell R.M. Ballas L.M. Coleman R.A. J. Lipid Res. 1981; 22: 391-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The very low activities of AEAT detected in microsomes and digitonin-treated cells not exposed to alamethicin treatment indicated that both isolated microsomes and those left in situ in permeabilized hepatocytes were very largely intact. Cells (1.5 × 106) were cultured for 72 h in 10-cm2 six-well dishes in 2 ml of RPMI 1640 medium (with added l-glutamine, 2.5 mm) supplemented with 10% FBS. They were subsequently washed in PBS, and preincubated in serum-free medium for 30 min with increasing concentrations of the inhibitors (iA or iB) dissolved in DMSO. The control reactions had only DMSO added (0.6% DMSO in all incubations). At the end of the incubation period, oleate (0.7 mm) and [3H]glycerol (0.25 mm, 104 dpm/nmol) were added to each well and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h (which was determined from preliminary experiments to be on the linear time course of incorporation of [3H]glycerol into triglycerides). At the end of the 2-h incubation period, total lipids were extracted from the media and the cells using chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v). The triglyceride fraction was isolated, and the radioactivity associated with it quantified, as described above for the DGAT assays. When plasma membrane integrity was measured, cells were incubated with 20 mm glycerol for 20 min prior to treatment with different concentrations of digitonin. Following sedimentation of the permeabilized cells by light centrifugation, the incubation media were assayed for glycerol 3-phosphate content. The glycerol 3-phosphate assay mixture contained 0.76 m hydrazine sulfate, 2 m glycine, and 10.5 mm EGTA (pH 9.0) in 250 μl, to which was added to 50 μl of NAD (40 mm), followed by 700 μl of the permeabilized cell supernatant. The optical density at 340 nm was monitored using a spectrophotometer, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 μl of an ammonium sulfate suspension of purified glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Sigma). The optical density was followed continuously to the completion of the reaction, and the amount of glycerol 3-phosphate present was calculated from the difference between the initial and final optical density at 340 nm. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the NADH-dependent absorbance changes at 340 nm. The data presented are mean (± S.E.) of the number of separate preparations detailed in the figure legends. Statistical significance was calculated using Student's t test. To ascertain whether the previous observation of the dual distribution of DGAT activity in isolated microsomes (9Owen M.R. Corstorphine C.C. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) could be reproduced in the ER in situ after permeabilization of whole cells, we measured DGAT activity before and after treatment with the pore-forming peptide, alamethacin, both in rat-derived McA-RH7777 cells and human-derived HepG2 cells in which the plasma membrane was permeabilized with low concentrations of digitonin (see below), and in isolated rat microsomes. The data in Fig. 2, panel i, show that permeabilization of isolated rat-derived liver microsomes with alamethacin (a pore-forming small peptide) resulted in the expected increase in DGAT activity (cf. Ref. 9Owen M.R. Corstorphine C.C. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and ∼10-fold increases in the exposure of the activities of AEAT (Fig. 2, panel ii) and mannose-6-phosphatase (Fig. 2, panel iii).

Although this ensures the equimolar production of rRNAs, it requires the endonucleolytic separation of pre-rRNAs to initiate rRNA production.

Furthermore, because Rcl1 has no homology to other known endonucleases, these data also establish a novel class of nucleases. Eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis is a complex process that requires the transient association of ∼200 proteins, including nucleases, RNA helicases, GTPases, and ATPases, to promote the modification, folding, and cleavage of rRNA and the binding of ribosomal proteins to the pre-rRNA (1Strunk B.S. Karbstein K. RNA. 2009; 15: 2083-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Three of the four rRNAs are co-transcribed as a single transcript referred to in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the 35 S precursor, which is subsequently cleaved in a partially ordered process to release the mature 18 S, 5.8 S, and 25 S rRNAs (Fig. 1A) (2Venema J. Tollervey D. Annu. Rev. Gen. 1999; 33: 261-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). After initial cleavages to generate the mature 5′-end of 18 S rRNA, co-transcriptional cleavage at so-called site A2 separates rRNA destined for the small and large subunits (3Kos M. Tollervey D. Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 809-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 4Osheim Y.N. French S.L. Keck K.M. Champion E.A. Spasov K. Dragon F. Baserga S.J. Beyer A.L. Mol.

Despite decades of research, only three of eight endonucleases in pre-rRNA processing have been identified. This is surprising considering the conservation of cleavage steps and the central importance of processing for rRNA production. Knowledge of the A2 nuclease would also allow for accumulation of novel pre-40 S intermediates that have so far been only inferred because yeast strains specifically inhibited for A2 cleavage are lacking. Rcl1 (RNA 3′-phosphate cyclase-like) is a conserved S. cerevisiae nucleolar protein (7Billy E. Wegierski T. Nasr F. Filipowicz W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2115-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 8Wegierski T. Billy E. Nasr F. Filipowicz W. RNA. 2001; 7: 1254-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) named for its similarity to RNA cyclases. Cyclases catalyze the ATP-dependent formation of a 2′,3′-cyclic phosphodiester from a 3′-phosphate (9Genschik P. Billy E. Swianiewicz M. Filipowicz W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2955-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, the Rcl1 protein contains an insertion not present in cyclases, and thus, Rcl1 lacks cyclase activity (7Billy E. Wegierski T. Nasr F. Filipowicz W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2115-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Rcl1 is required for co-transcriptional steps in 18 S rRNA biogenesis (7Billy E. Wegierski T. Nasr F. Filipowicz W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2115-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and is delivered to pre-ribosomes by Bms1, an essential GTPase that is also required for assembly of the 40 S ribosomal subunit (8Wegierski T.

Cell. 2005; 20: 633-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The regulation of this protein by a GTPase suggests that its function may represent an irreversible gatekeeper in ribosome assembly. Here, we show that recombinant Rcl1 cleaves pre-rRNA transcripts at site A2 in a concentration-dependent manner. This cleavage is abolished by rcl1 mutations that inhibit this co-transcriptional cleavage step in vivo and substantially slowed by RNA mutations around the cleavage site that are known to inhibit A2 cleavage in vivo. These results provide strong evidence that Rcl1 is the long sought nuclease responsible for co-transcriptional cleavage at site A2, the separation point of the large and small subunit rRNAs. The rcl1 gene-including promoter and terminator was amplified from genomic DNA and cloned into the yeast expression vector pRS315 using primers 1 and 2. Mutations were generated using the QuikChange method. Rcl1, rcl(1–309), and rcl(1–341) were also cloned into pRS416TEF using primers 3–6. Maltose-binding protein (MBP) 3The abbreviation used is: MBPmaltose-binding protein.-tagged rcl1 was cloned into pSV272 using primers 4 and 7. Plasmids are described in supplemental Table S2. maltose-binding protein. rDNA fragments were cloned as described (14Lamanna A.C. Karbstein K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 14259-14264Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 15Young C.L. Karbstein K. RNA. 2011; 17: 512-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Transcriptions were carried out as described (27Karbstein K. Carroll K.S. Herschlag D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11171-11183Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and RNA was purified using an RNA Maxi Kit (Qiagen). 300 pmol of RNA was treated with Antarctic phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for 1.5 h at 37 °C. After heat inactivation at 65 °C for 5 min, the RNA was 5′-end labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP at 37 °C for 2 h and then gel-purified. His-tagged or MBP-tagged Rcl1 were expressed and purified over nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose as described previously (11Karbstein K. Jonas S. Doudna J.A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 633-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Elution fractions containing Rcl1 were pooled and dialyzed overnight into 50 mm NaCl and 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5) at 4 °C. Dialyzed protein was loaded onto a MonoS column equilibrated in 25 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), and 0.5 mm EDTA and eluted in a salt gradient to a final concentration of 1 m KCl over 12 column volumes. Fractions containing Rcl1 were pooled and concentrated for further purification over a Superdex75 column in 200 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. Concentrated protein was flash frozen for storage at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined using an extinction coefficient of 35,410 m−1 cm−1. RNA was folded as described (11Karbstein K.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 14259-14264Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Rcl1 was pre-incubated at 30 °C for 15–20 min. Aliquots were removed at the indicated time points and immediately phenol/chloroform extracted and precipitated. Samples were boiled for 2 min at 95 °C and held on ice before separation on a 6% acrylamide, 50 mm MES (pH 6.2), 8 m urea gel. Gels were dried and then exposed overnight. Cleavage gels were quantified using phosphoimaging analysis and graphs fit with Equation 1.fractioncleav=fractioncleavmax -fractioncleavmax⋅exp(-kcleav⋅t)(Eq. 1) Yeast strain YKK55, generated by PCR-based recombination, has a galactose-inducible promoter upstream of the Rcl1 open reading frame. The insertion was verified by PCR and Western blotting. Northern blotting was carried out as described previously (28Woolls H.A. Lamanna A.C. Karbstein K. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 2578-2586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Rcl1 depletion leads to defects in early co-transcriptional cleavages of pre-rRNA, with effects on cleavage at site A2 being most pronounced (Billy et al., 2000). This observation, as well as the sequence homology of Rcl1 to RNA 3′-cyclases, and the fact that 2′,3′-cyclic phosphates are common endonuclease products, led to the proposal that Rcl1 could be the nuclease for A2 cleavage (7Billy E. Wegierski T. Nasr F. Filipowicz W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2115-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11Karbstein K. Jonas S. Doudna J.A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 633-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), although that proposal has been recently challenged (12Tanaka N. Smith P. Shuman S. RNA. 2011; 17: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and alternative proposals have been made (13Bleichert F. Granneman S. Osheim Y.N. Beyer A.L. Baserga S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 9464-9469Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To test whether Rcl1 is responsible for cleavage at site A2, we produced recombinant S. cerevisiae Rcl1 in Escherichia coli. The resulting 40-kDa protein was purified to homogeneity over three columns, and mass spectrometry confirmed that the full-length protein was obtained (supplemental Fig. S1 and data not shown). As substrates, we transcribed pre-rRNA mimics that include the 3′-minor region of 18 S rRNA (starting at helix 44, H44) and ITS1 (internal transcribed spacer I), the spacer region that separates 5.8 S from 18 S rRNAs and harbors cleavage site A2 (see Fig. 2A for rRNA nomenclature). These rRNAs are folded into unique and stable structures relevant to 18 S processing and 40 S subunit assembly in vivo (5Lamanna A.C. Karbstein K. J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 405: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 14Lamanna A.C. Karbstein K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 14259-14264Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 15Young C.L. Karbstein K. RNA. 2011; 17: 512-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To test whether Rcl1 cleaves pre-rRNA containing the A2 cleavage site, we incubated Rcl1 with prefolded 5′-end labeled H44-ITS1 rRNA and separated the resulting RNAs on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. As shown in Fig. 2B, Rcl1 quantitatively cleaves H44-ITS1 in a time-dependent manner, liberating an RNA fragment corresponding to the in vitro-transcribed H44-A2 product. This reaction is enhanced by increasing the Rcl1 concentration from 0 to 4 μm (Fig. 2, E and F). Furthermore, 3′-end labeling demonstrates that cleavage is endonucleolytic as the 3′-product, A2-ITS1, is also formed (supplemental Fig. S2). Prior to A2 cleavage, pre-18 S rRNA is in a conformation different from that during cleavage at the 3′-end of 18 S rRNA and in mature 18 S rRNA. H44-ITS1 RNA in this early structure is stabilized by base pairing between the top of H44 and nucleotides immediately downstream of site A2 (5Lamanna A.C. Karbstein K. J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 405: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To test whether the early structure is required for cleavage at site A2, we used an alternative substrate (H45-ITS1), which lacks H44 and thus assumes the post-A2 cleavage structure. Rcl1 cleaves this pre-rRNA with kinetics indistinguishable from those observed for the H44-ITS1 substrate (Fig. 2, C and D). This finding is consistent with the previous observation that the pre-A2 structure is not required for A2 cleavage in vivo (19Lindahl L. Archer R.H. Zengel J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5399-5407Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and suggests that Rcl1 is indifferent to secondary structure changes near the A2 cleavage site. To test whether the A2 sequence was sensitive to any nuclease or specifically cleaved by Rcl1, we also incubated H45-ITS1 RNA with Nob1, the endonuclease for D-site cleavage (5Lamanna A.C. Karbstein K. J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 405: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 6Pertschy B. Schneider C. Gnädig M. Schäfer T. Tollervey D. Hurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35079-35091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). As expected (5Lamanna A.C. Karbstein K. J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 405: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) Nob1 cleaves at site D, not at site A2 (supplemental Fig. S3), demonstrating that cleavage at site A2 is specific to Rcl1 and not simply achieved by any nuclease. A2 cleavage in vivo occurs after C(+212) (16Allmang C. Henry Y. Wood H. Morrissey J.P. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. RNA. 1996; 2: 51-62PubMed Google Scholar). To further confirm that Rcl1 cleaves at the same site in vitro, we mapped the cleavage site by comparing it with RNA sequence ladders generated by RNase T1 digestion and alkaline hydrolysis (supplemental Fig. S4). RNase T1 cleaves after guanosine residues and thereby produces a partial sequencing read. In vitro cleavage of H45-ITS1 by Rcl1 produced the expected product at C(+212) as well as two additional products resulting from cleavages at positions C(+209) and C(+214). These cleavages occur in the same CA sequence context as the main site and are also observed in vivo, albeit to a lesser extent (16Allmang C. Henry Y. Wood H. Morrissey J.P. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. RNA. 1996; 2: 51-62PubMed Google Scholar). 4It is also possible that cleavage at the upstream site is overestimated in our assay, as cleavage at the correct site followed by cleavage at the upstream site would appear only as upstream cleavage. In contrast, the in vivo primer extension assay is biased to cleavage downstream. Sequencing of RNaseT1-digested 3′-ends of 20 S rRNA provided evidence for a single product one nucleotide shorter than the upstream cleavage product, as well as demonstrating that in at least 20% of the material at least one nucleotide was lost in the work up (17De Jonge P. Klootwijk J. Planta R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 72: 361-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Using existing assays, it is thus not possible to determine the exact distribution of cleavage sites in vivo and in vitro. Sequence mapping with the larger H44-ITS1 rRNA produced two products, including the expected product at +212 (data not shown). However, the existence of a third product cannot be ruled out, as the larger size of H44-A2 RNA might prevent the resolution of a third band. To further demonstrate that Rcl1 is responsible for A2 cleavage and to better characterize the sequence elements recognized by Rcl1, we performed cleavage assays with mutated RNA substrates. These substrates contain a deletion (Δ6–3′) or substitution (sub2) 3′ to the A2 site and inhibit A2 cleavage (at the most abundant site) in vivo (Fig. 2A) (16Allmang C. Henry Y. Wood H. Morrissey J.P. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. RNA. 1996; 2: 51-62PubMed Google Scholar). Although not abolished, cleavage of either mutant substrate was hindered compared with the wild type RNA substrate (Fig. 3). Residual cleavage most likely results at the aberrant sites three nucleotides upstream or two nucleotides downstream of A2 as reported previously (16Allmang C. Henry Y. Wood H. Morrissey J.P. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. RNA. 1996; 2: 51-62PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that Rcl1-dependent rRNA cleavage in vitro has the same requirement as A2 cleavage in vivo further supports the hypothesis that Rcl1 is the endonuclease that cleaves at the A2 site. To demonstrate that rRNA cleavage is due to Rcl1 and not a minor E. coli contaminant and to gain insight into the mechanism of Rcl1, we generated an inactive point mutant. We first used truncation analysis to determine a region in rcl1 necessary for activity in vivo. A yeast strain with the endogenous rcl1 gene under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter was created, and plasmids containing no rcl1, wild type, or truncated rcl1 were transformed. Yeast were grown overnight, serially diluted, and plated on media containing either galactose or glucose. As expected, all strains grow indistinguishably on galactose medium, whereas growth on glucose requires functional Rcl1 (Fig. 4A). This analysis indicated that amino acids between residues 309 and 341 are required for Rcl1 function, as Rcl(1–341) rescues growth but Rcl(1–309) does not. This latter truncation corresponds almost exactly to a recently described non-functional truncation of Kluyveromyces lactis Rcl1 (12Tanaka N. Smith P. Shuman S. RNA. 2011; 17: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Subsequent mutation analysis in this region yielded the triple mutant R327A/D328A/K330A, which grows slowly on glucose-containing medium, indicating that this mutant version of Rcl1 is not fully functional (Fig. 4A). Western analysis of sucrose gradient-fractionated lysates demonstrates that wild type, mutant, and truncated Rcl1 are stable and similarly distributed in pre-ribosomes (supplemental Fig. S5). Northern analysis of mutant and truncated Rcl1 shows reduced levels of 20 S and 27 S A2 rRNAs, the products from A2 cleavage, as well as accumulation of 21 S rRNA (Fig. 4B). This intermediate is cleaved at the A0 and A1 sites, but not at site A2 (but instead at the independent, downstream A3 site). Together, these data demonstrate that mutations in rcl1 specifically inhibit cleavage at site A2 in vivo, whereas cleavages at sites A0, A1, and A3 are not affected. His-tagged mutant or truncated Rcl1 are insoluble (data not shown), perhaps not surprising, as both human and Schizosaccharomyces pombe Rcl1 are also insoluble (12Tanaka N. Smith P. Shuman S. RNA. 2011; 17: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Addition of a MBP tag solubilized these proteins, and therefore, MBP-tagged wild type and mutant Rcl1 were prepared. However, MBP-tagged wild type Rcl1 was inactive in the RNA cleavage assay using H44-ITS1 (data not shown). We reasoned that this lack of activity might be due to steric inhibition from the MBP tag, which is the same size as Rcl1 itself (see “Discussion” for further details about steric inhibition in the context of the Rcl1 structure). To test whether inhibition could be relieved by use of a smaller substrate that is less prone to steric inhibition, we used a chemically synthesized 10-mer RNA oligonucleotide comprising the cleavage site. Wild type Rcl1 cleaves this oligonucleotide at the same sites as larger substrates, consistent with recognition of a single-stranded region of limited size (Fig. 4C). MBP-tagged Rcl1 also cleaves this oligonucleotide. However, the main site of cleavage is at a downstream site, consistent with steric clashes arising from the MBP-tag that preclude binding at the correct site. In this model, the N-terminal end of the protein, which contains the MBP tag, is oriented toward the RNA 3′-end (Fig. 4C). To avoid steric clashes between the MBP tag and RNA, the protein reorients downstream so that the tag does not contact RNA. Importantly, the Rcl1 R327A/D328A/K330A mutant was incapable of cleaving these oligonucleotides at any site, demonstrating that RNA cleavage arises from the Rcl1 protein. In all forms of life, rRNAs from the small and large subunit are co-transcribed in a single transcript; in eukaryotes, this operon encodes 18 S, 5.8 S, and 25 S rRNAs. Here, we demonstrate that Rcl1 is the nuclease required for the co-transcriptional cleavage that separates 18 S rRNA from 5.8 S and 25 S rRNAs. Recombinant S. cerevisiae Rcl1 purified from E. coli cleaves in vitro-transcribed pre-rRNA mimics containing the A2 cleavage site in a site-specific manner to generate products identical to those found in vivo. Point mutations in rcl1 and pre-rRNA abolish rRNA cleavage in vivo and in vitro. Our data are consistent with previous in vivo primer extension data demonstrating that Rcl1 depletion has no effect on cleavage at sites A0 and A1 when assayed within 10 h of the shift to glucose (7Billy E. Wegierski T. Nasr F. Filipowicz W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2115-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Lateron effects on the non-essential cleavage at site A0 are also observed, consistent with our observation that 35 S also accumulates at later time-points. Rcl1 is delivered to pre-ribosomes by the GTPase Bms1 (11Karbstein K. Jonas S. Doudna J.A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 633-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Our finding that Rcl1 is the nuclease required for cleavage at site A2 puts this observation in a new light, as it explains why Rcl1 delivery is regulated in a GTP-dependent manner: ribosome assembly is facilitated by a large machinery comprising ∼200 cofactors, which transiently interact with assembling ribosomes before dissociating. Because binding and dissociation steps are generally freely reversible, this creates the problem of a lack of flux through the pathway. rRNA cleavage steps (and other steps such as GTP or ATP hydrolysis) can solve this problem as they are irreversible. As observed in metabolic pathways, which also often contain freely reversible as well as irreversible steps, these irreversible steps are often the point of regulation. This appears also to hold true for ribosome biogenesis, where not just the Rcl1 endonuclease is regulated by the GTPase Bms1, but similarly, the Nob1 and RNase MRP endonucleases are regulated by a conformational switch and an RNA-dependent helicase, Dbp3, respectively (11Karbstein K. Jonas S. Doudna J.A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 633-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 5Lamanna A.C. Karbstein K. J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 405: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 18Weaver P.L. Sun C. Chang T.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 1354-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Rcl1 has no homology to other known nucleases, and although it has significant structural homology to the RNA cyclase RtcA, most residues around the active site are not conserved (12Tanaka N. Smith P. Shuman S. RNA. 2011; 17: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, Rcl1 represents a novel endonuclease, with no additional homologs in yeast. It is possible that among the four or more missing endonucleases are additional novel endonucleases, which might have substantially stalled their identification, as they would not be identified as nucleases computationally. Our data indicate that Rcl1 has specificity for cleavage between C and A. Furthermore, the observation that Rcl1 cleavage is limited to the correct A2 site as well as only two CA sites just up and downstream (despite the presence of 32 CA dinucleotides in H44-ITS1 RNA), suggests that there is an additional Rcl1 recognition element. Substitutions and mutations that affect A2 cleavage are all located 3′ to the A2 site, suggesting that a recognition site may reside there. Reanalysis of previous data (16Allmang C. Henry Y. Wood H. Morrissey J.P. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. RNA. 1996; 2: 51-62PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lindahl L. Archer R.H. Zengel J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5399-5407Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and data herein suggests that Rcl1 recognizes a sequence of C↓ACAC, where the arrow indicates the site of cleavage. The C 5′ to the cleavage site can be replaced with an A (supplemental Fig. S4B). Immediately 3′ to this sequence element is a region that forms base pairs with H44 in early pre-40 S ribosomes (5Lamanna A.C. Karbstein K. J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 405: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This region is outside of the Rcl1 recognition site, as the secondary structure of this element does not affect Rcl1 cleavage in vivo or in vitro. Interestingly, the C↓ACAC sequence appears to be conserved from yeast to humans, with the A immediately 3′ to the cleavage site possibly universally conserved (5Lamanna A.C. Karbstein K. J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 405: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We believe that both the highly conserved A 3′ to the cleavage site, as well as a conserved binding site 3′ but not 5′ to the cleavage site are a vestige of the evolution from the bacterial RtcA. RtcA can convert any 3′-monophosphate into cyclic phosphate, suggesting there is no sequence specific recognition to the 5′ sequence. Conversion of the 3′-monophosphate to the cyclic 2′,3′-phosphate is achieved by activation with ATP, which is specifically bound. We believe that the highly conserved A 3′ to the cleavage site binds Rcl1 where ATP binds RtcA. Although correct Rcl1-dependent cleavage at the A2 site is observed in vitro, additional cleavage products arising from cleavage two or three nucleotides up or downstream, respectively, are also found. The same miscleavage sites are observed in vivo; however, fidelity is much increased (16Allmang C. Henry Y. Wood H. Morrissey J.P. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. RNA. 1996; 2: 51-62PubMed Google Scholar). The S1 domain-containing protein Rrp5 is required for cleavage at site A2 in vivo (20Torchet C. Jacq C. Hermann-Le Denmat S. RNA. 1998; 4: 1636-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 21Venema J. Tollervey D. RRP5 is required for formation of both 18 S and 5.85 rRNA in yeast.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5701-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 22Vos H.R. Faber A.W. de Gier M.D. Vos J.C. Raue H.A. Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 1504-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and binds near cleavage site A2 (15Young C.L. Karbstein K. RNA. 2011; 17: 512-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In vitro, Rrp5 does not promote Rcl1-dependent cleavage nor increase its fidelity, and its binding is insensitive to the rRNA mutations. Moreover, in vitro pulldowns provide no evidence for a direct interaction between Rrp5 and Rcl1. 5C. L. Young, S. L. Mason, and K. Karbstein, unpublished data. Together, these data indicate that Rrp5 is not directly responsible for fidelity of A2 site cleavage in vivo. The structures of Rcl1 and the related bacterial RtcA provide important guidance for further functional studies (12Tanaka N. Smith P. Shuman S. RNA. 2011; 17: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 23Palm G.J. Billy E. Filipowicz W. Wlodawer A. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 24Tanaka N. Smith P. Shuman S. Structure. 2010; 18: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We have identified three residues in the C terminus, Arg-327, Asp-328, and Lys-330, where mutations render Rcl1 non-functional in vivo and in vitro. The observation that individual mutations of the R327A/D328A/K330A residues have no appreciable effect on Rcl1 function in vivo (data not shown) suggests that these residues are not directly involved in the catalytic step. Instead, we predict that they help binding of the RNA substrate: the active site in Rcl1 is likely near the covalently bound AMP in RtcA (24Tanaka N. Smith P. Shuman S. Structure. 2010; 18: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) where a larger pocket, sufficient to accommodate a CA dinucleotide, is found in Rcl1 (Fig. 1B) (12Tanaka N. Smith P. Shuman S. RNA. 2011; 17: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). At one end of this pocket, Rcl1 displays a groove that is lined with basic amino acids, where the conserved R327A/D328A/K330A residues are located. RtcA has a similar, although more narrow, groove. Furthermore, this groove does not display positive charges in RtcA. We propose that this groove forms the binding site for the RNA element 3′ to the cleavage site recognized by Rcl1 as described above. Because a cyclase works on a RNA 3′-end, it would not have such a binding site. This model explains the findings that specificity elements in the RNA are located 3′ to the cleavage site, and that N-terminally tagged Rcl1 cleaves at the very 3′-end of an RNA substrate: the N terminus is located at the end of this channel (12Tanaka N. Smith P. Shuman S. RNA. 2011; 17: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) such that the MBP tag would interfere with RNA binding, requiring a shift in the RNA binding mode. The recently published Rcl1 structure includes an extensive mutational analysis where 14 individual point mutants around the putative active site pocket were analyzed in a yeast growth assay (12Tanaka N. Smith P. Shuman S. RNA. 2011; 17: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We have mutated a partially overlapping set of residues around that site and obtained the same result (data not shown). Although this was interpreted as evidence against nuclease activity for Rcl1, we want to point out that it simply demonstrates that these side chains are not required for cell growth. A2 cleavage is not rate-limiting for 40 S ribosome production in vivo, which could obscure small effects on catalysis. Furthermore, backbone amides can be used to bind and stabilize developing negative charge in the transition state, as demonstrated for the oxyanion hole in serine proteases (25Birktoft J.J. Blow D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 68: 187-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Similarly, backbone carbonyls as well as the RNA substrate itself could provide ligands for essential metal ions, which could function in acid/base catalysis. Side chain mutagenesis would not affect these potential functional groups and can thus not be used to rule out (or in) any functional role for the putative active site or the entire protein. Nevertheless, the surprising lack of any effects from mutagenesis clearly indicates that additional experiments are required to understand how this novel enzyme works. rRNA processing in bacteria is initiated by RNase III-dependent cleavage 3′ to the 16 S coding region, which separates pre-16 S rRNA from pre-23 S rRNA and pre-tRNAs encoded between the 16 S and 23 S rRNA genes. Thus, RNase III performs a reaction that is analogous to the one carried out by Rcl1 in eukaryotes. It is not known why eukaryotes, which have a functional RNase III homolog that is involved in 3′-end formation of 25 S rRNA (26Elela S.A. Igel H. Ares Jr., M. Cell. 1996; 85: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), evolved a specialized enzyme to separate rRNAs from the two subunits. Perhaps RtcA, suggested to be involved in tRNA repair, was localized to pre-rRNA by the tRNAs encoded between bacterial 16 S and 23 S rRNAs and co-evolved into Rcl1 with the evolving ITS1. It is tempting to speculate that additional enzymes allow for a finer regulation of pre-rRNA cleavage in higher organisms.

https://openalex.org/W2020285011,"The objective of this study was to identify a source of intramitochondrial malonyl-CoA that could be used for de novo fatty acid synthesis in mammalian mitochondria. Because mammalian mitochondria lack an acetyl-CoA carboxylase capable of generating malonyl-CoA inside mitochondria, the possibility that malonate could act as a precursor was investigated. Although malonyl-CoA synthetases have not been identified previously in animals, interrogation of animal protein sequence databases identified candidates that exhibited sequence similarity to known prokaryotic forms. The human candidate protein ACSF3, which has a predicted N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence, was cloned, expressed, and characterized as a 65-kDa acyl-CoA synthetase with extremely high specificity for malonate and methylmalonate. An arginine residue implicated in malonate binding by prokaryotic malonyl-CoA synthetases was found to be positionally conserved in animal ACSF3 enzymes and essential for activity. Subcellular fractionation experiments with HEK293T cells confirmed that human ACSF3 is located exclusively in mitochondria, and RNA interference experiments verified that this enzyme is responsible for most, if not all, of the malonyl-CoA synthetase activity in the mitochondria of these cells. In conclusion, unlike fungi, which have an intramitochondrial acetyl-CoA carboxylase, animals require an alternative source of mitochondrial malonyl-CoA; the mitochondrial ACSF3 enzyme is capable of filling this role by utilizing free malonic acid as substrate.

Mitochondria synthesize fatty acids de novo using a suite of freestanding enzymes that closely resemble their prokaryotic counterparts. These “type II” fatty acid-synthesizing systems differ from those found in the cytosol of animals, in which the component enzymes are covalently linked in large multifunctional polypeptides, the “type I” systems. The mitochondrial systems are composed of an acyl carrier protein (ACP) 2The abbreviation used is: ACPacyl carrier protein. and malonyltransferase (which together generate the malonyl-ACP substrate used for chain extension by β-ketoacyl synthase) and a trio of β-carbon-processing enzymes (β-ketoacyl reductase, dehydrase, and enoyl reductase) that completely saturate the acyl chain prior to the following round of chain extension. All of these enzymes have been characterized in mammalian mitochondria (1Autio K.J. Kastaniotis A.J. Pospiech H. Miinalainen I.J. Schonauer M.S. Dieckmann C.L. Hiltunen J.K.

Chem. 2007; 282: 14178-14185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The source of malonyl-CoA as the substrate for a mitochondrial fatty acid synthase system is unknown (8Hiltunen J.K. Chen Z. Haapalainen A.M. Wierenga R.K. Kastaniotis A.J. Prog. Lipid Res. 2010; 49: 27-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Both the α- and β-isoforms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase that have been described in animals generate malonyl-CoA in the cytosol, although the β-isoform is associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane (9López-Casillas F. Bai D.H. Luo X.C. Kong I.S. Hermodson M.A. Kim K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 5784-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 10Widmer J. Fassihi K.S. Schlichter S.C. Wheeler K.S.

The α-form generates malonyl-CoA for utilization by the cytosolic fatty acid synthase, whereas the β-form is believed to provide malonyl-CoA primarily for the regulation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, which controls entry of fatty acids into the mitochondria for oxidation. Malonyl-CoA is also produced by the β-oxidation of odd chain length dicarboxylic fatty acids, but this process is thought to be exclusively peroxisomal (12Suzuki H. Yamada J. Watanabe T. Suga T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 990: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). There are no reports indicating that a malonyl-CoA-translocating system might be present in mitochondrial membranes. An alternative way of generating malonyl-CoA intramitochondrially could be via the mitochondrial propionyl-CoA carboxylase, which has some activity toward acetyl-CoA (13Jang S.H. Cheesbrough T.M. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3500-3505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In an earlier study, we found that mitochondrial extracts from bovine heart were capable of incorporating radiolabeled malonic acid into fatty acids, raising the possibility that malonyl-CoA could be generated by a malonyl-CoA synthetase (7Witkowski A. Joshi A.K. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14178-14185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Malonyl-CoA synthetases have been characterized in prokaryotes (14Jung J.W. An J.H. Na K.B. Kim Y.S. Lee W. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1294-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) but not previously in animals. The goal of this study was to determine whether mammalian mitochondria contain a malonyl-CoA synthetase that could play a role in fatty acid synthesis. acyl carrier protein. OmicsLink T7 promoter-driven expression clones encoding ACSF3 (acyl-CoA synthetase family member 3) were obtained as tobacco etch virus protease-cleavable, N-terminally His-tagged (EX-T5643-B01) and GST-tagged (EX-T5643-B03) plasmids from GeneCopoeia (Rockville, MD). Plasmids were chemically transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α and BL21(DE3)pLysS cells according to the GeneCopoeia product protocol. Authenticity of the plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Several single base substitutions were found in the ACSF3 protein coding region when compared with that of another cDNA in the human sequence database (NM_174917). Only one substitution resulted in an amino acid change, V372M. This replacement, which is located in a region that is not highly conserved, was also reported in another genetic variant (AAH28399). Overnight culture of transformed BL21(DE3)pLysS clones in Terrific broth medium containing 0.4% glucose, 50 μg/ml carbenicillin, and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol was used to inoculate 120 ml of Terrific broth medium containing 0.2% glycerol and carbenicillin at 37 °C. When an absorbance unit of 1 (600 nm) was reached, the entire culture was transferred to a fermentor filled with 1.9 liters of Terrific broth medium with 0.2% glycerol and enriched with 2 g/liter (NH4)2HPO4. Cells were grown at 37 °C again to an absorbance unit of 1, cooled to 20 °C, induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and left overnight. Pelleted cells were diluted in 3 volumes of 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 5 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm E-64, 5 μg/ml α1-antitrypsin, and 1 mm PMSF and lysed in a French press; the extract was centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 20 min; and the supernatant flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen at −80 °C. The GST-ACSF3 fusion protein was purified from the lysate using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) essentially according to the manufacturer's batch protocol except that 1% Triton X-100 was added to the lysate, TBS was used in place of PBS, and the fusion protein was eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8). The fusion protein was concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration; cleaved by treatment with AcTEVTM protease (Invitrogen) for 2 days at 4 °C; and dialyzed against 0.1 m MOPS (pH 7.1), 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. The products were separated using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. The ACSF3 protein was recovered in the unbound fraction. Two recombinant ACSF3 mutants were made from the GST-ACSF3 plasmid using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, and primers were designed using the Agilent QuikChange primer Design program: R354A (CG → GC), 5′-acaccctgctggaggcgtatggcatgaccg-3′ and 5′-cggtcatgccatacgcctccagcagggtgt-3′; and R354L (G → T), 5′-caccctgctggagctgtatggcatgaccg-3′ and 5′-cggtcatgccatacagctccagcagggtg-3′. The R354A and R354L plasmids were transformed into E. coli XL1-Gold and BL21(DE3)pLysS competent cells, and authenticity of the mutants was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutant proteins were expressed and purified essentially as described for the wild-type protein. Enzyme activity was assayed routinely by incubating samples at 37 °C in a 50-μl reaction mixture that included 100 mm MOPS (pH 7.1), 2 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 3 mm MgCl2, 200 μm CoA, 2 mm ATP, and 0.1 mm [2-14C]malonate. Control reactions lacked ATP. In some assays, CoA was replaced by 10 μm human mitochondrial holo-ACP, prepared as described previously (5Zhang L. Joshi A.K. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40067-40074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and reactions were continued for either 2 h or overnight. In specificity studies, various di- and monocarboxylic substrates at 100 μm (or at 20 μm for a very long chain) were used in place of malonate. Purified ACSF3 protein (1 or 3 ng/μl) was used in kinetic or specificity assays, respectively. Reactions were stopped after 30 min (kinetic assays) or 2 h (specificity assays) either by the addition of cold 10% TCA for substrates with fewer than eight carbon atoms or by flash-freezing for longer substrates. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were analyzed by HPLC on SpheriSorb C18 column (300 Å, 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm; Waters) at 20 °C. Products were identified by comparison of their elution times with those of authentic standards and quantitated either by radioactivity monitoring or, for nonradioactive substrates, from the absorbance at 258 nm attributable to the CoA thioester. In some cases, the appearance of an absorbance peak corresponding to AMP was also used to detect activity. Stock solution of octanoic and lauric acids were prepared in methanol. The final concentration of methanol in the assay was 2%. Stock solutions of palmitic, oleic, and lignoceric acids were prepared in buffered α-cyclodextrin (15Singh I. Kishimoto Y. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 662-665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α-Cyclodextrin at concentrations up to 2 mm did not affect ACSF3 activity with malonate. Three different HPLC solvent systems were utilized for product identification and quantitation. For [2-14C]malonic acid, [1-14C]acetic acid, [1-14C]butyric acid, and succinic acid, the column was developed at 0.8 ml/min using a two-step gradient: 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 5.6) to 50% 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 5.6) and 20% methanol over 10 min and then to 100% 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 5.6) and 20% methanol over 20 min and held for a further 10 min (gradient system 1). For methylmalonic, oxalic, octanoic, lauric, palmitic, lignoceric, and oleic acids, the column was developed at 1 ml/min with 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 5.6) for 10 min, followed by a three-step gradient to 40% 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 5.6) and 10% acetonitrile over 10 min, to 100% 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 5.6) and 10% acetonitrile over 2 min, and to 90% acetonitrile over 18 min and then continued at 90% acetonitrile for 5 min (gradient system 2). Reaction products with lignoceric and oleic acids were also analyzed on an Inertsil phenyl column (150 Å, 5 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm; Varian) developed in 95% 50 mm potassium phosphate and 5% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min for 5 min, followed by three-step gradient: 95% 50 mm potassium phosphate and 5% acetonitrile to 70% 50 mm potassium phosphate and 30% acetonitrile over 3 min, then 70% 50 mm potassium phosphate and 30% acetonitrile to 31% 50 mm potassium phosphate and 69% acetonitrile over 13 min, and finally 31% 50 mm potassium phosphate and 69% acetonitrile to 20% 50 mm potassium phosphate and 80% acetonitrile over 2 min and held for a further 2 min (gradient system 3). Values for Km and kcat were calculated using EnzymeKinetics (Trinity Software). SDS-PAGE was performed on 10 or 9% gels that were subsequently stained with Pro-Blue Staining Kit (Owl Separation Systems/Fisher Scientific) or blotted onto a PVDF membrane and analyzed as described previously (7Witkowski A. Joshi A.K. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14178-14185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Samples used for quantification were transferred overnight in the cold in 4 mm 3-(cyclohexylamino) propane sulfonic acid (pH 11) in a Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN® II transfer unit with the voltage set at 30 V. All secondary antibodies used in Western analyses were tagged with horseradish peroxidase, which was detected with a chemiluminescent substrate, Pierce ECL or SuperSignal West Femto (Thermo Scientific). The primary polyclonal antibody against human ACSF3 protein (LOC197322) was obtained from Abnova. Some mitochondrial preparations were precipitated with ice-cold 20% TCA in acetone before solubilization in the sample buffer. Images were scanned as transparencies and quantified with NIH ImageJ (1.45i). Each sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE at least twice, and only images that contained limited numbers of black pixels were used for quantification. HEK293T cell culture, siRNA knockdown, and purification of mitochondria were performed as described previously (6Feng D. Witkowski A. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11436-11445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) with minor changes: knockdown experiments were scaled up using T-25 flasks, and 10 mm EDTA in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline was used to detach cells. These mitochondrial preparations were used to assay for malonyl-CoA synthetase activity and for overall activity of the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway as described below. Cells were homogenized and centrifuged at 650 × g for 10 min to remove debris. Mitochondria were sedimented at 10,500 × g for 30 min, the pellet was washed with homogenization buffer, and mitochondria were finally sedimented again at 10,500 × g for 15 min. Both supernatants were combined and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to sediment the microsomal fraction. The microsomal pellet was washed with homogenization buffer and resedimented. Final microsomal and mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in 100 mm MOPS (pH 7.1), 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol; flash-frozen, and stored at −80 °C. Debris-free cell homogenate derived from 15 × 106 cells was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was washed and resuspended in 0.3 ml of homogenization buffer and then applied at 4 °C to the top of a five-layer 10–30% discontinuous iodixanol gradient (OptiPrep) in a total gradient volume of 4.75 ml. Samples were centrifuged for 3 h at 100,000 × g in an SW 50.1 rotor (Beckman) at 4 °C, 0.1 ml was taken from the top of the gradient, and the remainder was collected in 0.35-ml fractions. A 0.225-ml portion of each fraction was diluted with 0.225 ml of homogenization buffer, and organelles were pelleted at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting pellets were suspended in 50 μl of solubilization buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm aminohexanoic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors). After 20 min on ice, extracts were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and supernatants were used for activity assays and Western analysis. The remaining portions of the gradient fractions were treated with methanol and chloroform (16Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3170) Google Scholar), and the precipitates were dissolved in sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Assays and product analysis were carried out as described previously (7Witkowski A. Joshi A.K. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14178-14185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The mitochondrial extract was replaced with whole mitochondria (derived from either HEK293T cells or mouse tissues; 1.2 mg/ml mitochondrial protein), and reaction mixtures contained additionally 0.2% Triton X-100 and 2.5 μm rotenone. Reactions were stopped after 5 h by the addition of 0.35 ml of ice-cold TCA to 10% and 75 μg of BSA and washed twice with 0.4 ml of ice-cold 5% TCA and five times with 0.3 ml of ice-cold 2.4 m ammonium sulfate. This procedure ensured complete washing of free radioactivity, leaving only covalently bound radioactive products (data not shown). Bovine and mouse mitochondria were isolated as described (7Witkowski A. Joshi A.K. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14178-14185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and purified by differential centrifugation (6Feng D. Witkowski A. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11436-11445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) or on a five-layer discontinuous iodixanol gradient as described above. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid reagent (Pierce) in the presence of 0.16% SDS. Citrate synthase was assayed essentially as described (17Srere P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 3-11Crossref Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). [2-14C]Malonate, free of contamination by [14C]acetate, was obtained from Moravek (Brea, CA). Interrogation of the human protein sequence database using malonyl-CoA synthetase sequences from Rhizobium trifolii and Bradyrhizobium japonicum as probes identified a number of putative acyl-CoA synthetases with significant sequence similarity. Among the highest scoring proteins were ACSM2 (acyl-CoA synthetase member 2), a butyryl-CoA synthetase, and ACSF3, a previously uncharacterized protein, each with ∼60% sequence similarity and 28% identity (supplemental Fig. 1). ACSF3 and ACSM2 are acronyms for acyl-CoA synthetases (ACS) according to the classification scheme introduced by Watkins et al. (18Watkins P.A. Maiguel D. Jia Z. Pevsner J. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 2736-2750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). “M2” indicates member 2 of the group active toward medium chain substrates, and “F3” indicates member 3 of the generic family having uncertain specificity. Using the available crystal structure of ACSM2 with a butyryl moiety bound at the active site (Protein Data Bank code 3EQ6) (19Kochan G. Pilka E.S. von Delft F. Oppermann U. Yue W.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 388: 997-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we identified all amino acids within 6 Å of C4 of the butyryl moiety. By aligning the other acyl-CoA synthetases, positionally equivalent residues were identified. Only one of these proteins, ACSF3, included an arginine residue in the putative active site region that also aligned with an arginine in the malonyl-CoA synthetases from Rhizobium leguminosarum and B. japonicum. We reasoned that this arginine might facilitate the binding of a malonyl moiety through formation of a salt bridge. This arginine residue is positioned within a sequence motif (ERYGMTE) that is conserved in the prokaryotic malonyl-CoA synthetases and in ACSF3 proteins but not in other homologous acyl-CoA synthetases. The predicted molecular mass of the ACSF3 protein is 64,131 Da, and, compared with the malonyl-CoA synthetases of R. trifolii and B. japonicum, the hypothetical human protein includes an N-terminal extension that is predominantly basic in character and predicted by iPSORT (20Bannai H. Tamada Y. Maruyama O. Nakai K. Miyano S. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), MitoProt II (21Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J.

Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3618) Google Scholar, 23Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4934) Google Scholar) to have the properties of a mitochondrial targeting sequence (supplemental Fig. 1). Highly homologous ACSF3 and ACSM2 sequences were also found in the bovine, rat, and mouse databases. On this basis, we concluded that ACSF3 was the best candidate for the role of a mitochondrial malonyl-CoA synthetase. However, there was one piece of published information that argued against this conclusion: ACSF3 had previously been tentatively identified as an acyl-CoA synthetase that purportedly exhibits a preference for very long chain fatty acids (18Watkins P.A. Maiguel D. Jia Z. Pevsner J. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 2736-2750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). With this reservation in mind, we initiated attempts to purify a malonyl-CoA synthetase directly from bovine and mouse heart mitochondria but were thwarted by the low abundance of the enzyme and poor yields, particularly in low ionic strength media. For example, although we were able to obtain substantial enrichment of the ACSF3 proteins from both sources, as judged by Western analysis (Fig. 1A), general staining of these preparations subjected to SDS-PAGE indicated that the ACSF3 proteins remained minor components (Fig. 1B). Indeed, although we were able to identify all of the major mitochondrial proteins in the partially purified bovine preparation by in situ tryptic digestion and mass spectrometric analysis, none of them corresponded to bovine ACSF3 (data not shown). Nevertheless, we were able to establish that these partially purified preparations were capable of synthesizing malonyl-CoA from malonate, ATP, Mg2+, and CoA and contained a protein of ∼60 kDa that was recognized by antibodies against ACSF3 (Fig. 1A). We therefore elected to attempt cloning and expression of this protein for detailed biochemical analyses. Two constructs encoding the protein were expressed in E. coli, one as a GST fusion protein and the other with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. Only the GST fusion construct generated detectable amounts of soluble protein. The GST fusion protein was purified; the N-terminal GST domain was removed by proteolysis; and the free synthetase was isolated as a homogeneous protein of 65 kDa, close to the value of 64,940 Da predicted for ACSF3 protein containing an additional 8 residues remaining from the engineered tobacco etch virus protease site (Fig. 1C). The purified enzyme converted malonate to malonyl-CoA with high efficiency (kcat = 0.413 ± 0.003 s−1) and exhibited a Km for malonate of 36.8 ± 0.7 μm (Fig. 1D). Specificity studies (Table 1) revealed that methylmalonate was activated at 70% of the rate observed for malonate, and weak activity was observed with acetate (0.04% of the rate observed with malonate). No detectable activity was found with other dicarboxylic acids (oxalate or succinate) or with the fatty acids (butyrate, octanoate, laurate, palmitate, oleate, or lignocerate). Activity was absolutely dependent on the presence of ATP, Mg2+, and CoA. Human mitochondrial holo-ACP could not replace CoA. These data support the identification of the enzyme as a malonyl-CoA synthetase.TABLE 1Substrate specificity of recombinant ACSF3SubstrateConcentrationACSF3 activityμm%Malonate100100.0 ± 3.0Methylmalonate10070.4 ± 1.2Dicarboxylic fatty acids (C2 and C4)100No activityAcetate1000.04 ± 0.00Saturated fatty acids (C4, C8, and C12)100No activitySaturated fatty acids (C16 and C24)20No activityOleic acid20No activity Open table in a new tab Arg-354 is located within the conserved motif ERYGMTE and is predicted to be positioned at the active site. Engineered Ala-354 and Leu-354 mutants were found to be completely devoid of malonyl-CoA synthetase activity, although the Ala-354 mutant retained the same very low activity toward acetate that we observed with the wild-type enzyme. This evidence supports the possibility that Arg-354 facilitates substrate binding in the human malonyl-CoA synthetase by interacting with the 3-carboxylate of malonate. Fractionation of extracts of (human) HEK293T cells by differential centrifugation or on an iodixanol density gradient (monitored by Western blotting with various antibodies and activity assay) revealed that the malonyl-CoA synthetase sedimented together with the mitochondrial markers pyruvate dehydrogenase, mitochondrial β-ketoacyl synthase, and prohibitin (Fig. 2). No malonyl-CoA synthetase was detected in the post-mitochondrial supernatant and the microsomal fraction. HEK293T cells were exposed to siRNAs targeting either ACSF3 or mitochondrial ACP or to vehicle alone and cultured for 48 h. Cell proliferation was decreased by 30–36% in cultures exposed to either ACSF3 or ACP siRNAs for 48 h. As we had found previously (6Feng D. Witkowski A. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11436-11445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), cells treated with ACP siRNA exhibited defective lipoylation of mitochondrial proteins. However, cells treated with ACSF3 siRNA exhibited normal protein lipoylation profiles (data not shown). Isolated mitochondrial preparations were analyzed by Western analysis, enzyme activity assays, and de novo fatty acid synthesis assays (Fig. 3). In cells treated with ACSF3 siRNA, the level of ACSF3 protein was reduced to 16% (Fig. 3, A and B), and the level of malonyl-CoA synthetase activity was reduced to 37% (Fig. 3C) compared with cells treated with vehicle alone. In contrast, neither the amount nor the enzyme activity of ACSF3 protein was reduced in cells treated with ACP siRNA (Fig. 3, A and B). The levels of β-ketoacyl synthase and prohibitin were relatively unaffected by exposure to either siRNA (Fig. 3, A and B). These results demonstrated that the ACSF3 protein accounts for most, if not all, of the malonyl-CoA synthetase activity in mammalian mitochondria. To evaluate the effect of ACSF3 knockdown on mitochondrial function, we assessed the ability of mitochondria to utilize [2-14C]malonate for fatty acid synthesis. The presence in these mitochondrial preparations of substantial thioesterase activity against malonyl-CoA precluded estimation of the amount of this metabolite formed (7Witkowski A. Joshi A.K. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14178-14185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, we were able to reliably assay the amount of the relatively stable ACP-linked products formed from malonate via malonyl-CoA. They included malonyl-ACP, acetyl-ACP, and the acyl-ACPs produced using the malonyl extender moieties. Acetyl-ACP is formed from malonyl-ACP in an uncoupled decarboxylation reaction catalyzed by the mitochondrial β-ketoacyl synthase (4Zhang L. Joshi A.K. Hofmann J. Schweizer E. Smith S. J. Biol.

Reporter assays of cell extracts from RAW-264.7 macrophages infected with L. (L.) amazonensis or HEK-293T cells cotransfected with TLR2 and PKR promoter constructions were employed. Primary macrophages of TLR2-knockout (KO) or IFNR-KO mice were infected, and the levels of PKR, IFN-1, and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) transcript levels were investigated and compared. Immunohistochemical analysis of human biopsy lesions was evaluated for IFN-1 and PKR-positive cells. Leishmania infection increased the expression of PKR and IFN-β on induction of PKR-promoter activity. The observed effects required the engagement of TLR2. TLR2-KO macrophages expressed low IFN-β and PKR levels postinfection with a reduced parasite load. We also revealed the requirement of PKR signaling for Leishmania-induced IFN-1 expression, responsible for sustaining PKR expression and enhancing infection. Moreover, during infection, SOD1 transcripts increased and were also enhanced when IFN-1 was added to the cultures. Remarkably, SOD1 expression was abrogated in infected, dominant-negative PKR-expressing cells. Finally, lesions of patients with anergic diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis exhibited higher levels of PKR/IFN-1-expressing cells compared to those with single cutaneous leishmaniasis. In summary, we demonstrated the mechanisms and relevance of the IFN-1/PKR axis in the Leishmania infection.—De Carvalho Vivarini, A., Pereira, R. M. S., Dias Teixeira, K. L., Calegari-Silva, T.

https://openalex.org/W1979648977,"Calpains are proteolytic enzymes that modulate cellular function through cleavage of targets, thereby modifying their actions. An important role is emerging for calpains in regulating inflammation and immune responses, although specific mechanisms by which this occurs have not been clearly defined. In this study, we identify a novel target of calpain, selenoprotein K (SelK), which is an endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane protein important for Ca(2+) flux in immune cells. Calpain-mediated cleavage of SelK was detected in myeloid cells (macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells) but not in lymphoid cells (B and T cells). Both m- and μ-calpain were capable of cleaving immunoprecipitated SelK, but m-calpain was the predominant isoform expressed in mouse immune cells. Consistent with these results, specific inhibitors were used to show that only m-calpain cleaved SelK in macrophages. The cleavage site in SelK was identified between Arg(81) and Gly(82) and the resulting truncated SelK was shown to lack selenocysteine, the amino acid that defines selenoproteins. Resting macrophages predominantly expressed cleaved SelK and, when activated through different Toll-like receptors (TLRs), SelK cleavage was inhibited. We found that decreased calpain cleavage was due to TLR-induced up-regulation of the endogenous inhibitor, calpastatin. TLR-induced calpastatin expression not only inhibited SelK cleavage, but cleavage of another calpain target, talin. Moreover, the expression of the calpain isoforms and calpastatin in macrophages were different from T and B cells. Overall, our findings identify SelK as a novel calpain target and reveal dynamic changes in the calpain/calpastatin system during TLR-induced activation of macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1964336064,"Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) and tetanus neurotoxin are the causative agents of the paralytic diseases botulism and tetanus, respectively. The potency of the clostridial neurotoxins (CNTs) relies primarily on their highly specific binding to nerve terminals and cleavage of SNARE proteins. Although individual CNTs utilize distinct proteins for entry, they share common ganglioside co-receptors. Here, we report the crystal structure of the BoNT/F receptor-binding domain in complex with the sugar moiety of ganglioside GD1a. GD1a binds in a shallow groove formed by the conserved peptide motif E … H … SXWY … G, with additional stabilizing interactions provided by two arginine residues. Comparative analysis of BoNT/F with other CNTs revealed several differences in the interactions of each toxin with ganglioside. Notably, exchange of BoNT/F His-1241 with the corresponding lysine residue of BoNT/E resulted in increased affinity for GD1a and conferred the ability to bind ganglioside GM1a. Conversely, BoNT/E was not able to bind GM1a, demonstrating a discrete mechanism of ganglioside recognition. These findings provide a structural basis for ganglioside binding among the CNTs and show that individual toxins utilize unique ganglioside recognition strategies."
https://openalex.org/W1994996846,"Bacteria exploit multiple mechanisms for controlling central carbon metabolism (CCM). Thus, a bioinformatic analysis together with some experimental data implicated the HexR transcriptional factor as a global CCM regulator in some lineages of Gammaproteobacteria operating as a functional replacement of the Cra regulator characteristic of Enterobacteriales. In this study, we combined a large scale comparative genomic reconstruction of HexR-controlled regulons in 87 species of Proteobacteria with the detailed experimental analysis of the HexR regulatory network in the Shewanella oneidensis model system. Although nearly all of the HexR-controlled genes are associated with CCM, remarkable variations were revealed in the scale (from 1 to 2 target operons in Enterobacteriales up to 20 operons in Aeromonadales) and gene content of HexR regulons between 11 compared lineages. A predicted 17-bp pseudo-palindrome with a consensus tTGTAATwwwATTACa was confirmed as a HexR-binding motif for 15 target operons (comprising 30 genes) by in vitro binding assays. The negative effect of the key CCM intermediate, 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate, on the DNA-regulator complex formation was verified. A dual mode of HexR action on various target promoters, repression of genes involved in catabolic pathways and activation of gluconeogenic genes, was for the first time predicted by the bioinformatic analysis and experimentally verified by changed gene expression pattern in S. oneidensis ΔhexR mutant. Phenotypic profiling revealed the inability of this mutant to grow on lactate or pyruvate as a single carbon source. A comparative metabolic flux analysis of wild-type and mutant strains of S. oneidensis using [(13)C]lactate labeling and GC-MS analysis confirmed the hypothesized HexR role as a master regulator of gluconeogenic flux from pyruvate via the transcriptional activation of phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (PpsA)."
https://openalex.org/W2045796707,"In yeast, phosphatidic acid, the biosynthetic precursor for all glycerophospholipids and triacylglycerols, is made de novo by the 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases Ale1p and Slc1p. Ale1p belongs to the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) family, which contains many enzymes acylating lipids but also others that acylate secretory proteins residing in the lumen of the ER. A histidine present in a very short loop between two predicted transmembrane domains is the only residue that is conserved throughout the MBOAT gene family. The yeast MBOAT proteins of known function comprise Ale1p, the ergosterol acyltransferases Are1p and Are2p, and Gup1p, the last of which acylates lysophosphatidylinositol moieties of GPI anchors on ER lumenal GPI proteins. C-terminal topology reporters added to truncated versions of Gup1p yield a topology predicting a lumenal location of its uniquely conserved histidine 447 residue. The same approach shows that Ale1p and Are2p also have the uniquely conserved histidine residing in the ER lumen. Because these data raised the possibility that phosphatidic acid could be made in the lumen of the ER, we further investigated the topology of the second yeast 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, Slc1p. The location of C-terminal topology reporters, microsomal assays probing the protease sensitivity of inserted tags, and the accessibility of natural or artificially inserted cysteines to membrane-impermeant alkylating agents all indicate that the most conserved motif containing the presumed active site histidine of Slc1p is oriented toward the ER lumen, whereas other conserved motifs are cytosolic. The implications of these findings are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1972753930,"Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive intracellular bacterial pathogen that colonizes the cytosol of eukaryotic cells. Recent transcriptomic studies have revealed that intracellular L. monocytogenes alter expression of genes encoding envelope components. However, no comparative global analysis of this cell wall remodeling process is yet known at the protein level. Here, we used high resolution mass spectrometry to define the cell wall proteome of L. monocytogenes growing inside epithelial cells. When compared with extracellular bacteria growing in a nutrient-rich medium, a major difference found in the proteome was the presence of the actin assembly-inducing protein ActA in peptidoglycan purified from intracellular bacteria. ActA was also identified in the peptidoglycan of extracellular bacteria growing in a chemically defined minimal medium. In this condition, ActA maintains its membrane anchoring domain and promotes efficient bacterial entry into nonphagocytic host cells. Unexpectedly, Internalin-A, which mediates entry of extracellular L. monocytogenes into eukaryotic cells, was identified at late infection times (6 h) as an abundant protein in the cell wall of intracellular bacteria. Other surface proteins covalently bound to the peptidoglycan, as Lmo0514 and Lmo2085, were detected exclusively in intracellular and extracellular bacteria, respectively. Altogether, these data provide the first insights into the changes occurring at the protein level in the L. monocytogenes cell wall as the pathogen transits from the extracellular environment to an intracytosolic lifestyle inside eukaryotic cells. Some of these changes include alterations in the relative amount and the mode of association of certain surface proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2079158153,"The eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) delivers aminoacyl-tRNAs to the ribosomal A-site during protein synthesis. To ensure a continuous supply of amino acids, cells harbor the kinase Gcn2 and its effector protein Gcn1. The ultimate signal for amino acid shortage is uncharged tRNAs. We have proposed a model for sensing starvation, in which Gcn1 and Gcn2 are tethered to the ribosome, and Gcn1 is directly involved in delivering uncharged tRNAs from the A-site to Gcn2 for its subsequent activation. Gcn1 and Gcn2 are large proteins, and these proteins as well as eEF1A access the A-site, leading us to investigate whether there is a functional or physical link between these proteins. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells expressing His(6)-eEF1A and affinity purification, we found that eEF1A co-eluted with Gcn2. Furthermore, Gcn2 co-immunoprecipitated with eEF1A, suggesting that they reside in the same complex. The purified GST-tagged Gcn2 C-terminal domain (CTD) was sufficient for precipitating eEF1A from whole cell extracts generated from gcn2Δ cells, independently of ribosomes. Purified GST-Gcn2-CTD and purified His(6)-eEF1A interacted with each other, and this was largely independent of the Lys residues in Gcn2-CTD known to be required for tRNA binding and ribosome association. Interestingly, Gcn2-eEF1A interaction was diminished in amino acid-starved cells and by uncharged tRNAs in vitro, suggesting that eEF1A functions as a Gcn2 inhibitor. Consistent with this possibility, purified eEF1A reduced the ability of Gcn2 to phosphorylate its substrate, eIF2α, but did not diminish Gcn2 autophosphorylation. These findings implicate eEF1A in the intricate regulation of Gcn2 and amino acid homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2141466760,"Cardiac Na/K-ATPase (NKA) is regulated by its accessory protein phospholemman (PLM). Whereas kinase-induced PLM phosphorylation has been shown to mediate NKA stimulation, the role of endogenous phosphatases is presently unknown. We investigated the role of protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1) on PLM phosphorylation and NKA activity in rat cardiomyocytes and failing human hearts. Incubation of rat cardiomyocytes with the chemical PP-1/PP-2A inhibitor okadaic acid or the specific PP-1-inhibitor peptide (I-1ct) identified PLM phosphorylation at Ser-68 as the main substrate for PP-1. Moreover, myocytes adenovirally overexpressing PP-1 inhibitor-1 protein (I-1,Ad-I-1/eGFP) showed a 70% increase in PLM Ser-68 phosphorylation and 65% increase in NKA current, compared with enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP)-infected controls (Ad-eGFP), using Western blotting and voltage clamping, respectively. Notably, in left ventricular myocardium from patients with heart failure, PLM Ser-68 phosphorylation was ~50% lower (n=7) than in nonfailing controls (n=7). We provide the first physiological and biochemical evidence that PLM phosphorylation and cardiac Na/K-ATPase activity are negatively regulated by PP-1 and that this regulatory mechanism could be counteracted by I-1. This novel mechanism is markedly perturbed in failing hearts favoring PLM dephosphorylation and NKA deactivation and thus may contribute to maladaptive hypertrophy and arrhythmogenesis via chronically higher intracellular Na and Ca concentrations.—El-Armouche, A., Wittköpper, K., Fuller, W., Howie, J., Shattock, M.

We undertook this study to examine the biological relevance of Mef2c expression in retinal rod photoreceptors. Bioinformatics analysis, rapid analysis of cDNA ends (5′-RACE), and reverse transcription coupled with qPCR using splice site-specific oligonucleotides suggested that Mef2c is expressed in the mature retina from an alternative promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies showed the association of active RNA polymerase II and acetylated histone H3 just upstream of Mef2c exon 4, providing additional evidence for the utilization of an alternative promoter in the retina. In concordance, we observed the binding of NRL to a putative NRL-response element (NRE) at this location by ChIP-seq and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. NRL also activated the Mef2c alternative promoter in vitro and in vivo. Notably, MEF2C could support Rhodopsin promoter activity in rod photoreceptors.

Spatiotemporal control of gene expression is achieved by integrating multiple regulatory mechanisms, including transient or stable interactions between cis-regulatory DNA elements and trans-regulatory factors, epigenetic code, and signaling molecules (4Heintzman N.D. Ren B. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 386-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The neural retina provides an excellent paradigm to elucidate qualitative and quantitative control of gene expression in the developing and adult central nervous system (5Swaroop A. Kim D. Forrest D. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 563-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In the retina, six types of neuronal cells and one type of glial cell (Muller) differentiate from multipotent progenitor cells in a conserved order of birth, with each key step controlled by transcriptional regulatory proteins (6Marquardt T.

Rod and cone photoreceptors in the retina are light sensors that convert photons into electrical signals (phototransduction) under dim and bright light conditions, respectively (8Luo D.G. Xue T.

Precise control of gene expression is also essential for photoreceptor survival as both under- or overexpression of Rhodopsin and other genes can lead to photoreceptor degeneration (9Lem J.

Although several of these transcriptional regulators are individually essential to generate a normal compliment of rod and cone photoreceptors during development, they also function cooperatively to regulate photoreceptor-specific genes in the mature retina (5Swaroop A.

This “delay” in expression of rod maturation genes suggests the involvement of additional regulatory signals. We previously showed that NR2E3 is a direct transcriptional target of NRL (26Oh E.C. Cheng H. Hao H. Jia L. Khan N.W. Swaroop A. Brain Res. 2008; 1236: 16-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The primary role of NR2E3 appears to be suppression of cone gene expression, although it can contribute to the induction of rod-specific genes (18Chen J. Rattner A. Nathans J. J.

Estrogen-related receptor β, another potential target of NRL, participates in rod survival by regulating the expression of many genes (27Onishi A. Peng G.H. Poth E.M. Lee D.A. Chen J.

To identify additional transcription factors that control rod-specific gene expression, we took advantage of gene profiles generated from wild type and Nrl−/− retina and from their respective purified photoreceptors (33Akimoto M. Cheng H. Zhu D. Brzezinski J.A. Khanna R. Filippova E. Oh E.C. Jing Y. Linares J.L. Brooks M. Zareparsi S. Mears A.J. Hero A. Glaser T. Swaroop A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A survey of genes that are down-regulated in the absence of Nrl identified Mef2c (myocyte enhancer factor 2c) as a potential novel target of NRL. MEF2C belongs to the MADS (MCM1-agamous-deficiens serum response factor) family of transcription factors and is essential for muscle, cardiovascular, and bone development (36McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L.

Among the four vertebrate MEF2 proteins, postnatal expression of MEF2C is restricted to muscle, brain, and spleen, whereas others (MEF2A, MEF2B, and MEF2D) are expressed ubiquitously (39McDermott J.C. Cardoso M.C. Yu Y.T. Andres V. Leifer D. Krainc D. Lipton S.A. Nadal-Ginard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2564-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). MEF2C and two other transcription factors (GATA4 and TBX5) are sufficient to reprogram mouse fibroblasts into functional cardiomyocytes (40Ieda M. Fu J.D. Delgado-Olguin P. Vedantham V. Hayashi Y.

To examine the expression and function of Mef2c in the retina, we have performed a comprehensive analysis using in silico, in vitro, and in vivo methods. Here we show that Mef2c transcripts in the retina originate from an alternative promoter upstream of exon 4. We also demonstrate that the Mef2c promoter is a direct transcriptional target of NRL, and MEF2C contributes to the regulation of Rhodopsin promoter activity in vivo. Animal Care and Use committees of Oakland University and the National Eye Institute approved all animal care and tissue collection procedures. C57BL/6J, rd1, and CD1 mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) or the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The following ChIP grade antibodies were used: anti-Pol II, a polyclonal antibody to total RNA polymerase II (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); anti-Pol-II-S2, an antibody against transcriptionally active Pol II, phosphorylated on serine 2 of the C-terminal repeat domain (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA); anti-H3K9-Ac, a polyclonal antibody to histone H3 acetylated on lysine 9 (Abcam Inc.); and anti-NRL polyclonal antibody (45Swain P.K. Hicks D. Mears A.J. Apel I.J. Smith J.E. John S.K. Hendrickson A. Milam A.H. Swaroop A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36824-36830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A 540-bp genomic fragment around Mef2c exon 4 was amplified from C57BL/6 mouse genomic DNA using Pfu Ultra (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and cloned into pGemTeasy (Promega, Madison, WI) to produce pGemTeasy-Mef2cP-Ret. The PCR primers including restriction sites for KpnI and XhoI are listed here with the genomic sequences underlined: forward KpnI, 5′-CGCAGGTACCTTTCATGTGTGTGTTCATATTTGCAC-3′, reverse XhoI, 5′-TGCACTCGAGATACCCCAATGAGACAAGAAGGC-3′. The Mef2c promoter was subcloned from pGemTEasy-Mef2cP-Ret into the KpnI/XhoI sites of pGL3-basic (Promega) to produce the luciferase-reporter construct: pGL3-Mef2cP-Luc. The same Mef2c promoter was released from pGL3-Mef2cP-Luc using KpnI/XhoI, blunt ended, and ligated into a GFP vector to produce the Mef2cP-GFP construct. Sequencing validated all constructs. The Nrl shRNA plasmid was generated to knockdown Nrl expression (46Matsuda T. Cepko C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Mef2c and Gapdh shRNA plasmids were purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). Total RNA was isolated from mouse skeletal muscle, brain, and retina, respectively, using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 5′-RACE was performed using the GeneRacerTM kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions (47Schaefer B.C. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 255-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 48Maruyama K. Sugano S. Gene. 1994; 138: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of RNA was treated with calf intestinal phosphatase to eliminate truncated mRNA and non-mRNA. End caps were removed from full-length mRNAs with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase, leaving a 5′-phosphate for ligation to the GeneRacer RNA oligo. Reverse transcription with random hexamers was used to synthesize cDNA. To obtain 5′ ends, the first strand cDNA was amplified using a Mef2c-specific reverse primer (5′-ATCTCACAGTCGCACAGCAC-3′) and the GeneRacerTM 5′ primer. The RACE PCR product was visualized on a 1.5% agarose gel, purified, and cloned into the pCR 4-TOPO vector using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) for sequencing. At least 15 clones were sequenced for each reaction. Data for the Mef2c gene were derived from the complete Pol II ChIP-on-Chip data set, which is available under GEO accession number GSE 19999. ChIP-on-chip was performed as previously detailed (49Tummala P. Mali R.S. Guzman E. Zhang X. Mitton K.P. Mol. Vis. 2010; 16: 252-271PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, Pol II ChIP was carried out using retinas from CL57BL/6 mice at age P2 and P25. The ChIP DNA was amplified in a linear fashion using random priming amplification, fragmented, and labeled using the GeneChip Double-stranded DNA Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The resulting biotinylated DNA probe was hybridized to GeneChip Mouse Promoter 1.0R arrays (Affymetrix). Biotinylated probe prepared from total genomic DNA (non-ChIP) was hybridized to a separate GeneChip for paired normalization. Tiling arrays were scanned with an Affymetrix GeneChip scanner. Fluorescence data for the ChIP samples (P2 and P25) were normalized to the total genomic DNA control using Affymetrix Tiling Analysis software. Signal values were exported in bar-file format for interval determination with Affymetrix Tiling Analysis software and visualization with Integrated Genome Browser software. Track intervals parameters were: minimum length 300, gap 180, and intermediate threshold of 4. ChIP assays using an antibody recognizing the active form of Pol II (50Labhart P. Karmakar S. Salicru E.M. Egan B.S. Alexiadis V. O'Malley B.W. Smith C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Mitton K.P. BMC Mol. Biol. 2008; 9: 87Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The ChIP DNA was quantified in triplicate by real time qPCR using SYBR Green Super mixture (Bio-Rad). The copy number of ChIP DNA for each test region was obtained by comparing the Ct values from ChIP DNA with a standard curve composed of known copy numbers of genomic DNA and their corresponding Ct values. The ChIP-qPCR signal was normalized to the qPCR signal from input DNA, and calculated as copies of DNA detected per 1000 genome equivalents of input DNA. An untranslated region on Chromosome-6 (Untr) served as a negative control (49Tummala P. Mali R.S. Guzman E. Zhang X. Mitton K.P. Mol. Vis. 2010; 16: 252-271PubMed Google Scholar). Primer sequences used were: Mef2c exon 4 promoter (forward, 5′-TGCAGAAAAGATTCCCACTTG-3′, reverse, 5′-AGACACTCACAAGGCAAAGAC-3′), Rhodopsin promoter (forward, 5′-CCCCTCTGCAAGCCAATT-3′, reverse, 5′-GCAACTCCAGGCACTGAC-3′), Recoverin (Rcvrn) promoter (forward, 5′-CTCCTCCCTCCAAGGACTG-3′, reverse, 5′-CAAGGCTGTGTGCTGCTATG-3′), Untr (forward, 5′-TCAGGCATGAACCACCATAC-3′, reverse, 5′-AACATCCACACGTCCAGTGA-3′). ChIP using NRL antibody or normal IgG control was performed as described (26Oh E.C. Cheng H. Hao H. Jia L. Khan N.W. Swaroop A. Brain Res. 2008; 1236: 16-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). ChIP DNA from retinas of C57BL/6J mice (age P28), was used to construct NRL and IgG (control) ChIP-seq libraries, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Briefly, ChIP DNA was end-repaired, ligated to universal adaptors, and amplified in a linear fashion. The amplified DNA was purified and used for cluster generation and sequencing analysis using the Illumina 1G Genome Analyzer. The ChIP-seq reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm8) using the Solexa Analysis Pipeline and NRL-binding regions were identified by Model-based Analysis of ChIP-seq (MACS) with a false discovery rate <10−6 (52Feng J. Liu T. Zhang Y. Curr. Protoc. Bioinformatics. 2011; 34: 2.14.1-2.14.14Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). For ChIP assays, separate experiments were performed using retinas from C57BL/6J mice and Nrl−/− mice (on C57BL/6J background) at P2 and P28 using NRL antibody. Normal rabbit IgG was used as a negative control. The ChIP DNA and input DNA control (without immunoprecipitation) were analyzed by PCR using the following primers: Mef2c exon 4 promoter (forward, 5′-TGCAGAAAAGATTCCCACTTG-3′, reverse, 5′-AGACACTCACAAGGCAAAGAC-3′), Rhodopsin promoter (forward, 5′-CCCCTCTGCAAGCCAATT-3′, reverse, 5′-GCAACTCCAGGCACTGAC-3′), Rhodopsin intron negative control (forward, 5′-TGTGGTCTTCACCTGGATCATG-3′, reverse, 5′-TACCTGGACCAGCCAACGA-3′). Total RNA was isolated from C57BL/6 or Rd1 mouse retinas using the Absolute RNA Miniprep kit, and cDNA was synthesized using the AffinityScript qPCR cDNA Synthesis kit (Agilent Technologies, La Jolla, CA). Gene expression was detected by qPCR using TaqMan probes and 2× Gene Expression Master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) on an MX3000P real time PCR unit (Agilent). HEK293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in minimal essential medium-α containing 10% FBS and 100 units/ml of penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The cells were seeded into 24-well plates (150,000 cells/well), 24 h before transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described previously (17Mitton K.P. Swain P.K. Chen S. Xu S. Zack D.J.

Triplicate wells were co-transfected with the Firefly luciferase reporter construct, pGL3-Mef2cP-Luc (667 ng/ml); the transfection control plasmid, Renilla luciferase reporter pRL-CMV (11 ng/ml); and expression plasmid for human NRL (pED-NRL at 55 or 278 ng/ml) and/or expression plasmid for human CRX (pcDNA3.1/HisC-hCRX at 278 ng/ml). The corresponding empty vectors (pED, pcDNA3.1/HisC) were used to adjust the total amount of transfected DNA. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection for assay of Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities using the Dual Reporter Luminescence Reagent and a Turner dual-injector luminometer (Promega). Renilla luciferase activity was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. Fold-activation was calculated relative to transfection with empty expression vectors. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Statistical comparisons used analysis of variance with Tukey-HSD post-analysis using VassarStats. EMSA was performed as previously described (26Oh E.C. Cheng H. Hao H. Jia L. Khan N.W. Swaroop A. Brain Res. 2008; 1236: 16-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts from transfected HEK 293T cells were prepared using a kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). The DNA oligonucleotide (NRE, forward, 5′-TAGACAGTGACCTCCTCCCTGCTGAGCCACTATGCTCT-3′, NRE reverse, 5′-AGAGCATAGTGGCTCAGCAGGGAGGAGGTCACTGTCTA-3′) contain a putative NRL-response element (NRE) (underlined) predicted by Genomatix programs in the mouse Mef2c promoter region. 32P-Labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (40,000 cpm) was incubated with nuclear extracts at 4 °C for 20 min.

https://openalex.org/W2089209266,"The mechanism by which agonist binding to an ionotropic glutamate receptor leads to channel opening is a central issue in molecular neurobiology. Partial agonists are useful tools for studying the activation mechanism because they produce full channel activation with lower probability than full agonists. Structural transitions that determine the efficacy of partial agonists can provide information on the trigger that begins the channel-opening process. The ligand-binding domain of AMPA receptors is a bilobed structure, and the closure of the lobes is associated with channel activation. One possibility is that partial agonists sterically block full lobe closure but that partial degrees of closure trigger the channel with a lower probability. Alternatively, full lobe closure may be required for activation, and the stability of the fully closed state could determine efficacy with the fully closed state having a lower stability when bound to partial relative to full agonists. Disulfide-trapping experiments demonstrated that even extremely low efficacy ligands such as 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione can produce a full lobe closure, presumably with low probability. The results are consistent the hypothesis that the efficacy is determined at least in part by the stability of the state in which the lobes are fully closed."
https://openalex.org/W2009760425,"Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is an intrinsic anti-angiogenic factor and a potential anti-tumor agent. The tumoricidal mechanism of PEDF, however, has not been fully elucidated. Here we report that PEDF induces the apoptosis of TC-1 and SK-Hep-1 tumor cells when they are cocultured with bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). This macrophage-mediated tumor killing is prevented by blockage of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) following treatment with the soluble TRAIL receptor. PEDF also increases the amount of membrane-bound TRAIL on cultured mouse BMDMs and on macrophages surrounding subcutaneous tumors. PEDF-induced tumor killing and TRAIL induction are abrogated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) antagonists or small interfering RNAs targeting PPARγ. PEDF also induces PPARγ in BMDMs. Furthermore, the activity of the TRAIL promoter in human macrophages is increased by PEDF stimulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNA pull-down assays confirmed that endogenous PPARγ binds to a functional PPAR-response element (PPRE) in the TRAIL promoter, and mutation of this PPRE abolishes the binding of the PPARγ-RXRα heterodimer. Also, PPARγ-dependent transactivation and PPARγ-RXRα binding to this PPRE are prevented by PPARγ antagonists.

Therefore, PEDF is considered as a potential agent for treatment of solid tumors. pigment epithelium-derived factor bone marrow-derived macrophages TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma peroxisome proliferator response elements tumor-associated macrophages retinoic acid receptor human monocyte-derived macrophages nucleotides. Inside a solid tumor, in addition to dysregulated blood vessels, stromal cells (including fibroblasts and infiltrating immune cells) also contribute to promote tumor growth, tumor-associated angiogenesis, and metastasis (15Joyce J.A. Pollard J.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2763) Google Scholar, 16Siveen K.S. Kuttan G. Immunol. Lett. 2009; 123: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In addition, the most abundant tumor-infiltrating innate immune cells are macrophages, also termed tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) (15Joyce J.A. Pollard J.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2763) Google Scholar, 16Siveen K.S. Kuttan G. Immunol. Lett. 2009; 123: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). TAMs are considered an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. These proposed strategies include activation of TAMs to a tumoricidal state (17Solis M. Goubau D. Romieu-Mourez R. Genin P.

A recent animal study showed that overexpression of PEDF in a rat prostate tumor by transient transfection of a PEDF-expressing plasmid caused increased macrophage recruitment and expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase in macrophages (12Halin S. Rudolfsson S.H. Doll J.A. Crawford S.E. Wikström P. Bergh A. Neoplasia. 2010; 12: 336-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that PEDF may able to modify the gene expression profile of TAMs. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a transmembrane protein that acts as an apoptosis-inducing ligand by binding to death receptor 5 (DR5) expressed on murine cells or DR4 and DR5 expressed on human cells (24Finnberg N. Gruber J.J. Fei P. Rudolph D. Bric A. Kim S.H. Burns T.F. Ajuha H. Page R. Wu G.S. Chen Y. McKenna W.G. Bernhard E. Lowe S. Mak T. El-Deiry W.S. Mol.

Science. 1997; 276: 111-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar). TRAIL is best known as a tumor suppressor because TRAIL-null mice demonstrate an increase in susceptibility to tumor initiation and metastasis (26Cretney E. Takeda K. Yagita H. Glaccum M. Peschon J.J. Smyth M.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). TRAIL expression can be up-regulated by several cytokines. For example, interferon (IFN)-γ or -α stimulate tumoricidal activity in human monocytes via induction of TRAIL (17Solis M. Goubau D. Romieu-Mourez R. Genin P. Civas A. Hiscott J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 1469-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Griffith T.S. Wiley S.R. Kubin M.Z. Sedger L.M. Maliszewski C.R. Fanger N.A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1343-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). In theory, these tumoricidal effects can be promoted not only by inducing the TRAIL receptor on tumor cells but also by inducting expression of TRAIL on immune cells. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is a ligand-activated transcription factor, and its major sources of endogenous ligands are fatty acid derivatives and oxysterols derived from the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway (28Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar, 29Hihi A.K. Michalik L. Wahli W. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). PPARγ heterodimerizes with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (RXR) to form a transcription factor that binds to peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) in the promoter region of target genes (30Michalik L. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). PPARγ modulates many functions of macrophages, such as promoting cell differentiation (31Tontonoz P. Nagy L. Alvarez J.G. Thomazy V.A. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar), regulating cholesterol homeostasis (32Majdalawieh A. Ro H.S. Nucl. Recept. Signal. 2010; 8: e004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and antagonizing expression of proinflammatory genes (32Majdalawieh A. Ro H.S. Nucl. Recept.

Recent findings indicate that PPARγ activation functions as a signaling mechanism for the anti-angiogenesis and anti-inflammatory function of PEDF (34Ho T.C. Chen S.L. Yang Y.C. Liao C.L. Cheng H.C. Tsao Y.P. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 76: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 35Yang S.L. Chen S.L. Wu J.Y. Ho T.C. Tsao Y.P. Life Sci. 2010; 87: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The participation of PPARγ in the anti-tumor function of PEDF is not clear. On the other hand, an increase of PPARγ activity in TAMs has been reported as a strategy to overcome TAM-mediated cytotoxic T-lymphocyte suppression in the tumor microenvironment (36Van Ginderachter J.A. Meerschaut S. Liu Y. Brys L. De Groeve K. Hassanzadeh Ghassabeh G. Raes G. De Baetselier P. Blood. 2006; 108: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that PPARγ has the potential to modulate the function of TAMs and is thus a possible mediator of the antitumor effect of PEDF. In the present in vitro and animal study, we demonstrated that a TRAIL-mediated tumoricidal activity of macrophages can be stimulated by PEDF. Our observations also indicated that PPARγ mediates this effect. We identified a PPRE located within the promoter of the human TRAIL gene and determined that the binding of the PPARγ-RXRα heterodimer can be induced by PEDF treatment in macrophages. PKH-26 was purchased from Sigma. G3335, GW9662, and benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD(OMe)-fluoromethylketone were purchased from Calbiochem.

Recombinant human TRAIL was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). PEDF was purified from human plasma via collagen I-Sepharose resin as described previously (37Petersen S.V. Valnickova Z. Enghild J.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using an anti-PEDF antibody. Five-week-old C57BL/6 mice were housed under a constant 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and were allowed free access to standard food and water. The experiments were approved by the Mackay Memorial Hospital Review Board for Animal Investigation. Mice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of zoletil (6 mg/kg) and xylazine (3 mg/kg) and subsequent cervical dislocation. To isolate BMDMs, femora were aseptically removed and dissected free of adhering tissues, and then the marrow cavities were flushed by injection of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F-12 medium (Invitrogen). Collected bone marrow cells were incubated in a 100 × 15-mm Petri dish in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% l-glutamine, 1% HEPES, and 10 ng/ml recombinant mouse macrophage colony- stimulating factor (M-CSF; R&D Systems) for 7 days in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Treatments with PEDF (200 ng/ml unless otherwise specified) or inhibitors were performed on BMDMs (4 × 105 cells/well of a 6-well plate) seeded in serum-free DMEM/F-12 medium. THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS. Differentiation of THP-1 cells was induced by resuspending the cells in fresh medium containing 50 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 48 h, as in our previous report (38Ho T.C. Yang Y.C.

Treatments with PEDF and inhibitors were performed on cells (5 × 105 cells/well of a 6-well plate) seeded in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium with 50 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. For primary culture of human monocytes/macrophages, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from heparinized whole blood by density gradient centrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque (Histopaque, Sigma-Aldrich). The monocytes were differentiated into macrophages on culture plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) for 7 days at 37 °C with 7.5% CO2, as in our previous study (38Ho T.C. Yang Y.C. Chen S.L. Kuo P.C. Sytwu H.K. Cheng H.C. Tsao Y.P. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 898-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Treatments with PEDF or inhibitors were performed on cells seeded in serum-free α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen). TC-1 cells, which were established by transforming primary lung epithelial cells of C57/BL6 mice with HPV-16 E6 and E7 as well as c-Ha-ras oncogenes were cultured on RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Human hepatoma SK-Hep-1 and HuH-7 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a humidified environment. C57BL/6 mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 1 × 106 TC-1 cells into their left flanks. At day 21, when the tumor size reached ∼100 mm3, the animals were randomized into five groups (n = 6) and given PEDF (0.6 μg resolved in 100 μl of PEDF solvent), PEDF solvent (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl), PEDF plus 500 ng of TRAIL-R2-Fc chimera, or control IgG by peritumoral injection twice per day for 1 day. One group of mice was intraperitoneally injected with GW9662 (0.5 mg/kg body weight dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline) at 6 h before peritumoral injection of PEDF. For macrophage isolation, mice were euthanized at 24 h after PEDF injection, and tumors (including their capsule) were harvested, dissected into small pieces, and digested with 400 units/ml collagenase type IV, 0.05 mg/ml collagenase type I, and 0.01 mg/ml DNase I (Roche Applied Science) dissolved in DMEM/F-12 at 37 °C for 1 h. A cell suspension pooled from six tumors was sorted for macrophages using CD11b magnetic beads (5 μl of beads/107 cells; Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) at 4 °C for 20 min. CD11b-positive cells were collected for the evaluation of TRAIL expression by flow cytometry. For histology analysis, mouse tumor tissues were surgically excised at 48 h after PEDF injection, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and serially sectioned. Apoptotic cells were detected by a TUNEL assay (In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After TUNEL staining, slides were incubated in blocking buffer (5% normal goat serum in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20) for 30 min. The slides were then incubated with the F4/80 primary antibody (1:150) at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing three times with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, the slides were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500) for 60 min at room temperature. After washing three times, sections were observed under a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope (×200, 10 fields/tumor section; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Thornwood, NY). Images were recorded using Zeiss software. Tumor cells were labeled with the fluorescent membrane stain PKH-26 (final concentration 1 μm) according to the manufacturer's instructions and used as target cells in the cytotoxicity assay. The PKH-26-labeled target cells were incubated with BMDMs (4 × 105 cells, 2 ml of 10% FBS, DMEM/F-12 medium) for 16 h. For treatment, cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM/F-12 medium and treated with PEDF for 24 h. The apoptosis of the target cells was determined by in situ staining using a TACS annexin V-FITC kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Macrophages were stained with PE-conjugated anti-mouse CD253 (TRAIL) antibody (dilution 1:50; catalog no. 109305; BioLegend, San Diego, CA) and PerCP-conjugated anti-mouse F4/80 antibody (dilution 1:50; catalog no. 123126; BioLegend) for quantification of macrophages. PE-conjugated Rat IgG2a, κ Isotype Ctrl antibody (catalog no. 400508; BioLegend), and PerCP Rat IgG2a, κ Isotype Ctrl antibody (catalog no. 400530; BioLegend) were used as isotype controls. Stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScaliber; Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) using CellQuest software. BMDMs were treated with PEDF or its solvent for 24 h, 50 μl of the conditioned medium was analyzed for mouse TRAIL by an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay kit (E90139Mu; Life Science Inc., Cleveland, OH), according to the manufacturer's method. Fragments of the human TRAIL promoter were cloned from human genomic DNA (Promega) by PCR using the primers 5′-gtagactcatttacagatagaaggcaag-3′ (forward) and 5′-gtaagtcagccaggcagccggtcactg-3′ (reverse), yielding a fragment spanning from −1594 to +137 of the promoter sequence (GenBankTM accession number AF178756). Nucleotide numbers indicated for the human TRAIL promoter relates to the transcriptional initiation site (39Kirshner J.R. Karpova A.Y. Kops M. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 9320-9324Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). After the fragments were subcloned into the pSC-A vector, sequences were checked and then cloned into the SmaI site of the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) to produce the pGL3-TRAILp plasmid. The PvuII restriction site at nucleotide −914 and the NdeI restriction site at nucleotide −482 were used to generate the hTRAILp-Luc deletion constructs. The resulting products were blunt cloned into the SmaI site of the pGL3-Basic vector, creating the reporter vectors TRAILp-1-Luc and TRAILp-2-Luc. pGL3-TRAIL-m was generated from pGL3-TRAILp by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChangeTM mutagenesis kit; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using primer 5′-GAGAAAAACCACATATGGAACATTCAGGTC-3′ (GT to CA mutation underlined). The presence of the mutations was confirmed by sequencing. Cell lysis, fractionation, and SDS-PAGE were performed as described previously (40Yang Y.C. Ho T.C. Chen S.L. Lai H.Y. Wu J.Y. Tsao Y.P. BMC Cancer. 2007; 7: 216Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Antibodies used in this study were for PPARα (-fold dilution, 1:1000), PPARβ (1:1000), PPARγ (1:500), RXRα (1:1000), F4/80 (1:500), TRAIL (1:2000), activated caspase-3 antibody (1:500), and β-actin (1:10,000). Proteins of interest were detected using the appropriate IgG-HRP secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). X-ray films were scanned on a model GS-700 imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad) and analyzed using Labworks 4.0 software. For quantification, blots of at least three independent experiments were used. Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Synthesis of cDNA was performed with 1 μg of total RNA at 50 °C for 50 min using oligo(dT) primers and reverse transcriptase (Superscript III; Invitrogen). The amplification mixture (final volume, 20 μl) contained 1× Taq polymerase buffer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 μm primer pair, and 0.5 unit of TaqDNA polymerase. Primer sequences are shown in supplemental Table 1. cDNA was synthesized in an 18–22-cycle amplification reaction (denaturation, 20 s at 94 °C; annealing, 30 s at 57 °C; and polymerization, 40 s at 72 °C). The number of cycles for the primer set was chosen to be in the linear range of amplification. The PCR products were electrophoresed in a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and visualized by UV illumination. For real-time PCR detection of RNA transcripts, the cDNA was analyzed in an ABI PRISM 7500 Fast sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Amplification was carried out in a total volume of 40 μl containing 3 pmol of primers, serially diluted RT product, and SYBR Green I PCR Master Mix reagents (Applied Biosystems) with the following cycling conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s and a 5-min terminal incubation at 72 °C. The data were calculated with ΔΔCt. Primer sequences are shown in supplemental Table 1. All determinations were measured in triplicate. The cycle threshold (Ct) values corresponded to the PCR cycle number at which fluorescence emission in real time reached a threshold above the base-line emission and were analyzed using GeneAmp 7700 SDS software (Applied Biosystems). The Ct value of the PCR product of interest (human TRAIL in these experiments) and a control mRNA (GAPDH) was then used to calculate relative quantities of mRNA between samples. HuH-7 cells (1.5 × 105 cells/well of a 12-well plate) were plated for 16 h and transfected with plasmid DNA by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. Transient transfection was conducted in triplicate in 12-well plates, and 0.5 μg of plasmids were used in each well. To antagonize PPARγ activity, cells were treated with 20 μm GW9662 during transfection. The luciferase assay, including transient transfection studies for THP-1 macrophages, was performed as in our previous report (38Ho T.C. Yang Y.C. Chen S.L. Kuo P.C. Sytwu H.K. Cheng H.C. Tsao Y.P. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 898-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All DNA solutions also contained 0.1 ng/well of the SV40 Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid, which was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. The luciferase assay was conducted using the dual luciferase substrate system (Promega) with a luminometer. The luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase, and a mean value together with an S.E. value of the triplicate samples was used to determine the reporter activity. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Subconfluent BMDMs were transfected with a mixture of mouse PPARγ siRNAs (sc-29456; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen) in serum-free medium according to the manufacturer's instructions. A species-specific siCONTROL nontargeting siRNA (Dharmacon Research, Lafayette, CO) was utilized as a negative control. The final concentration of siRNA was 1 nm. At 24 h after siRNA transfection, cells were resuspended in new medium for a 24-h recovery period. Cell viability was not altered by transfection reagent alone or transfection with siRNA, as examined by the trypan blue exclusion assay. ChIP analysis was performed using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Charlottesville, VA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. In brief, 1 × 107 THP-1 macrophages were treated with PEDF for 16 h and then collected after 1% formaldehyde treatment for 10 min to cross-link DNA-binding proteins to the DNA. The chromatin DNA was extracted by SDS-containing buffer and broken into fragments of 400–1200 bp in length by sonication. Before immunoprecipitation, chromatin samples were precleared using a protein A-agarose slurry containing salmon sperm DNA and BSA (Upstate Biotechnology) and then immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies specific for PPARγ (10 μg/1 × 106 cells) or a normal rabbit IgG control antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) as a control, followed by immunoprecipitation with protein A-agarose. The recovered protein-nucleic acid complexes were incubated for 4 h with 0.4 m sodium chloride at 65 °C to reverse the cross-links. DNA in the immunoprecipitation product was amplified via PCR with the ChIP assay primers (shown in supplemental Table 1) that covered the PPRE site in the human TRAIL gene promoter. The PCR products were calculated with ΔΔCt. Immunoprecipitation with preimmune mouse IgG served as a negative control, and PCR using the same the primers and the input DNA (preimmunoprecipitation samples) was used as an internal control. The pull-down assay, which was similar to electrophoretic mobility shift assays, was performed as previously described with modifications (41Deng W.G. Zhu Y. Montero A. Wu K.K. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 323: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts from THP-1 macrophages were prepared using the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit (Pierce). Double-stranded biotinylated oligonucleotides (500 nm) containing the PPRE sequence (shown in supplemental Table 2) were mixed with 200 μg of nuclear extracts at 4 °C for 1 h with rocking. After incubation, the mixture was then bound to 20 μl of 50% streptavidin-agarose beads (Invitrogen). The complexes were washed five times with buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 300 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture) at 4 °C. Subsequently, the complexes were resuspended in 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. After being heated at 95 °C for 10 min, the supernatant was collected for Western bl"

Contrary to most methyltransferases, the 1- carbon unit transferred by TrmFO derives from 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate and not from S-adenosyl-l-methionine. The enzyme also employs the FAD hydroquinone as a reducing agent of the C5 methylene U54-tRNA intermediate in vitro. By analogy with the catalytic mechanism of thymidylate synthase ThyA, a conserved cysteine located near the FAD isoalloxazine ring was proposed to act as a nucleophile during catalysis. Here, we mutated this residue (Cys-53 in Bacillus subtilis TrmFO) to alanine and investigated its functional role. Biophysical characterization of this variant demonstrated the major structural role of Cys-53 in maintaining both the integrity and plasticity of the flavin binding site. Unexpectedly, gel mobility shift assays showed that, like the wild-type enzyme, the inactive C53A variant was capable of forming a covalent complex with a 5-fluorouridine-containing mini-RNA. This result confirms the existence of a covalent intermediate during catalysis but rules out a nucleophilic role for Cys-53. To identify the actual nucleophile, two other strictly conserved cysteines (Cys-192 and Cys-226) that are relatively far from the active site were replaced with alanine, and a double mutant C53A/C226A was generated. Interestingly, only mutations that target Cys-226 impeded TrmFO from forming a covalent complex and methylating tRNA. Altogether, we propose a revised mechanism for the m5U54 modification catalyzed by TrmFO, where Cys-226 attacks the C6 atom of the uridine, and Cys-53 plays the role of the general base abstracting the C5 proton.

Folate-dependent tRNA methyltransferase TrmFO is a ∼50-kDa FAD-containing protein that catalyzes the site-specific methylation of the C5-uridine 54 in the T-loop of most tRNAs. TrmFO is found exclusively in bacteria and more particularly in Firmicutes, δ- and α-Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Deinococci, and other phyla (1Urbonavicius J. Skouloubris S. Myllykallio H. Grosjean H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 3955-3964Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Unlike most DNA, RNA, and protein methyltransferases that catalyze a direct methyl transfer from S-adenosylmethionine to the target molecule, TrmFO catalyzes the formation of m5U54 in tRNA by using methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH2THF) as a 1-carbon donor and FADH2 as a reductant (2Delk A.S. Nagle Jr., D.P. Rabinowitz J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4387-4390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The agent that reduces FAD of TrmFO in vivo remains to be determined. However, it was recently observed that NADPH enhances the methylation reaction of the purified TrmFO 3The abbreviations used are: TrmFOfolate-dependent tRNA methyltransferaseTrmFOTTTrmFO from Thermus thermophilusTrmFOBSTrmFO from Bacillus subtilisCH2THF5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolateTHFtetrahydrofolateFADoxoxidized FADm5U5-methyluridinem5C5-methylcytosineThyA and ThyXthymidilate synthase A and X, respectivelyMPamegapascal(s). protein from Thermus thermophilus (TrmFOTT) (3Nishimasu H.

It was therefore concluded that TrmFO utilizes NADPH/FAD as a reductant system. Unexpectedly, we (4Hamdane D. Guérineau V. Un S. Golinelli-Pimpaneau B. Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 5208-5219Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and Nishimasu et al. (3Nishimasu H. Ishitani R. Yamashita K. Iwashita C. Hirata A. Hori H. Nureki O. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The methylation activity of TrmFO from Bacillus subtilis (TrmFOBS) was also observed in the absence of added carbon donor, indicating that CH2THF and catalytically competent reduced FAD are locked up in the freshly purified enzyme (4Hamdane D. Guérineau V. Un S. Golinelli-Pimpaneau B. Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 5208-5219Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Spectroscopic characterization of TrmFOBS showed the presence of several other air-stable redox forms of the flavin, notably a catalytically inactive FADH• radical and a potential FAD adduct sharing some spectral similarities with those observed for C4α-FAD-cysteinyl adducts. Interestingly, these flavin species reacted slowly with oxygen (4Hamdane D. Guérineau V. Un S. Golinelli-Pimpaneau B. Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 5208-5219Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), suggesting that the protein matrix may restrain their solvent accessibility.

Because the C5 position of pyrimidine is poorly reactive, an activation step prior to its modification is usually required. All C5-pyrimidine-modifying enzymes activate this position by the formation of a transient covalent linkage between the thiol side chain of an active site cysteine residue and the C6 atom of the targeted base. For example, a cysteine-dependent nucleophilic mechanism is used by S-adenosylmethionine-dependent m5C DNA methyltransferases (5Chen L. MacMillan A.M. Chang W. Ezaz-Nikpay K. Lane W.S. Verdine G.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11018-11025Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and RNA methyltransferases that methylate the C5 atom of pyrimidine (6Kealey J.T. Santi D.V.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6876-6881Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thymidylate synthases catalyze a reaction similar to that of TrmFO, the methylation at C5 of free dUMP to form dTMP. Two types of thymidylate synthases have been reported. Folate-dependent ThyA, which uses CH2THF both as a methylene and hydride donor, produces dihydrofolate and operates via a nucleophilic mechanism involving an active site cysteine residue (14Carreras C.W. Santi D.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 721-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 15Finer-Moore J.S. Santi D.V. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1). The first chemical step consists of the nucleophilic attack of cysteine Sγ at dUMP-C6 to yield a covalent enolate (or enol) binary complex. This activation reaction facilitates the condensation of the CH2THF methylene group to the C5 position of the uracil ring. After proton abstraction from the C5 atom, the resulting ternary enzyme-dUMP-CH2THF complex breaks down into a 5-methylene exocyclic uracil intermediate and THF. Finally, a hydride transfer from THF reduces the exocyclic methylene to the methyl moiety and enables free enzyme to regenerate. Thymidylate synthases from the second class (ThyX) are folate/FAD-dependent enzymes. ThyX synthesizes dTMP by using both CH2THF and FADH2 as a methylene donor and reducing agent, respectively (16Myllykallio H. Lipowski G. Leduc D. Filee J. Forterre P. Liebl U. Science. 2002; 297: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Although several biochemical and structural studies have been reported, the exact catalytic mechanism of ThyX is not settled yet and has been a matter of controversy. Indeed, both a covalent mechanism involving an active site nucleophilic serine residue (17Leduc D. Graziani S. Lipowski G. Marchand C. Le Maréchal P. Liebl U. Myllykallio H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 7252-7257Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and a direct hydride transfer mechanism from FADH2 to the uracil ring (18Koehn E.M. Fleischmann T. Conrad J.A. Palfey B.A. Lesley S.A. Mathews I.I. Kohen A. Nature. 2009; 458: 919-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) have been proposed. Given the common mechanism of C5-pyrimidine-modifying enzymes, it is likely that TrmFO also utilizes a similar nucleophilic catalysis to activate the C5 atom of U54 in tRNA and to facilitate its methylation (Scheme 1A). The recently solved structures of TrmFOTT together with a tRNA docking model have permitted the identification of the FAD-binding pocket and delineation of the enzyme active site (3Nishimasu H. Ishitani R. Yamashita K. Iwashita C. Hirata A. Hori H. Nureki O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 8180-8185Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Several conserved residues have also been mutated, and their critical role in catalysis has been studied. Based on the important loss of enzymatic activity resulting from the replacement of Cys-51 with alanine and on a tRNA docking model, it was inferred that Cys-51, which lies in the immediate vicinity of the N5 atom of FAD, probably acts as the nucleophile. In addition, Ser-52 was supposed to act as a general base, abstracting the C5-U54 proton, which leads to the release of the THF product (Scheme 1A and Fig. 1) (3Nishimasu H. Ishitani R. Yamashita K. Iwashita C. Hirata A. Hori H. Nureki O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 8180-8185Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The goal of the present study was to verify if the catalytic mechanism of TrmFOBS proceeds via a covalent intermediate and to identify the potential nucleophile. Using a gel mobility shift assay, we showed here that, like the classical thymidylate synthase ThyA, TrmFO employs a covalent mechanism because the wild type and several mutants were capable of forming a covalent complex with a substrate analog inhibitor, the 5-FU-U54-mini-RNA (Scheme 1B). Contrary to all expectations (3Nishimasu H. Ishitani R. Yamashita K. Iwashita C. Hirata A. Hori H. Nureki O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 8180-8185Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), our results demonstrate that Cys-53 does not act as a nucleophile in catalysis. Instead, we show that another conserved cysteine far from the active site, Cys-226 (equivalent to Cys-223 in TrmFOTT), fulfills this role (Fig. 1). However, because the C53A mutation abolishes the methylation activity, Cys-53 appears to play another crucial function in the enzymatic mechanism. Moreover, we report that mutation of Ser-54 (corresponding to Ser-52 in TrmFOTT) impaired neither the ability of TrmFO to form a covalent complex nor its ability to methylate tRNA. This leads us to propose that Cys-53 could rather be the general base. In addition to this catalytic role, biophysical characterizations point out a prominent effect of this residue on the dynamics and the conformational stability of the enzyme native state, especially in the vicinity of the FAD cofactor.FIGURE 1Structure of TrmFOTT (Protein Data Bank code 3G5U) showing the two-domain architecture of the protein. The flavin domain is shown in green, and the insertion domain is shown in magenta. The FAD cofactor is in yellow, and the two tryptophan residues, Trp-18 and Trp-283, are in green and magenta, respectively. The details of the flavin binding site showing the residues conserved across the TrmFO family are depicted in the lower panel.

Skouloubris S. Myllykallio H. Golinelli-Pimpaneau B. Protein Expr. Purif. 2010; 73: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The single mutants were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis of pHM408 (19Hamdane D. Skouloubris S. Myllykallio H. Golinelli-Pimpaneau B. Protein Expr. Purif. 2010; 73: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and two complementary oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) (supplemental Table 1). The double C226A/C53A variant was prepared from the C53A plasmid, using the C226A oligonucleotides. The expression and purification of the mutants were carried out as described previously for the wild-type enzyme (19Hamdane D. Skouloubris S. Myllykallio H. Golinelli-Pimpaneau B. Protein Expr. Purif. 2010; 73: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The expression level of the variants was comparable with that of wild-type TrmFOBS (∼30 mg of proteins produced per liter of cell culture). The purity of the proteins was >95% as judged by SDS-PAGE. The flavin content were determined after denaturation of oxidized proteins with 0.2% of SDS and quantification of the released FAD using an extinction coefficient of 11.3 mm−1·cm−1 at 450 nm. The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. The proteins were concentrated to ∼500–800 μm in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol and stored at −80 °C. The kinetics of U54 methylation in tRNA by the wild-type and mutant TrmFOBS proteins were determined, as described previously, using an Escherichia coli [α-32P]UTP-labeled tRNAAsp transcript (4Hamdane D. Guérineau V. Un S. Golinelli-Pimpaneau B. Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 5208-5219Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Grosjean H. Droogmans L. Roovers M. Keith G. Methods Enzymol. 2007; 425: 55-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A nitrocellulose-binding assay was used to measure the affinity of TrmFOBS for an E. coli [α-32P]UTP-labeled tRNAAsp transcript. This assay uses the property of nitrocellulose to retain proteins and protein-nucleic acid complexes but not free nucleic acids. The enzyme (from 3.9 nm to 2 μm) was incubated with ∼200 cps of tRNA in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8, for 30 min at 25 °C. Each sample (50 μl) was filtered on a prewashed nitrocellulose membrane (SM113, 0.45 μm; Sartorius). The membranes were then dried, and the amount of radioactivity retained on the membranes (corresponding to radiolabeled tRNA complexed with protein) was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Dissociation constants were determined by plotting the fraction of bound RNA (fRNA bound) versus the protein concentration and by fitting the curves to the equation, fRNA bound = [enzyme]/(Kd + [enzyme]). Enzyme (30 μm) was incubated at 37 °C for 40 min with a 2-fold molar excess of 31-mer 5-FU mini-RNA (Dharmacon), which corresponds to nucleotides 1–7 and 50–72 of B. subtilis tRNAAsp (Fig. 3A), in a 10-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES-Na (Sigma), pH 7.5, 100 mm ammonium sulfate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 25 mm mercaptoethanol (Promega), 1 unit/ml RNase inhibitor (Sigma), and 20% glycerol. The formation of the covalent RNA-enzyme complex was then analyzed on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel by Coomassie Blue staining. The yield of the covalent complex formed was estimated by the Bradford method after its isolation on an analytical MonoQ HR 5/5 column (GE Healthcare). The column was preequilibrated in 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 10 mm NaCl and eluted by a linear gradient of 0.01–1 m NaCl. The absorbances at 260 nm (RNA), 280 nm (protein), and 450 nm (FAD cofactor) were simultaneously recorded. The formation of the covalent complex between C53A TrmFOBS and 5-FU mini-RNA was also studied in the presence of various concentrations of iodoacetamide (0, 10, 50, and 100 mm) under the aforementioned conditions. 75 μg of TrmFOBS (∼30 μm) was incubated with 5 μg of trypsin (pancreatic bovine; Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm ammonium acetate, 200 mm EDTA, 100 mm mercaptoethanol, and 20% glycerol. For mild proteolysis in the presence of tRNA, the protein was pre-equilibrated with a 2-fold molar excess of bulk tRNA or E. coli tRNAAsp transcript for 20 min at 37 °C before adding trypsin. Bulk tRNA from the B. subtilis strain BSF2838 carrying the inactivated trmfO gene (gidΩermR) was obtained as described previously (21von Ehrenstein G. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 12 (Part A): 588-596Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The proteolysis reactions were stopped by the addition of the serine protease inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride (Perfabloc SC, Euromedex) at 0.5 mm final concentration and heated in loading buffer for 2 min at 90 °C. 7.5 μg of digested protein was loaded on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining. Enzymatic digestion of excised bands (full-length wild type and truncated TrmFOBS) was performed using the Progest robot (Genomic Solutions). Briefly, protein bands were extensively washed with acetronitrile and 25 mm NH4HCO3. Then the excised bands were treated with 100 μl of 10 mm DTT at 57 °C for 1 h. After DTT removal, 100 μl of 55 mm iodoacetamide was added for cysteine carbamidomethylation, and the reaction was left to proceed at room temperature for 1 h. After removal of the supernatant, the washing procedure was repeated, and then gel slices were dried. Twenty microliters of either 10 ng/μl Porcine Gold Trypsin (Promega) or 10 ng/μl Pseudomonas fragi AspN (Roche Applied Science) diluted in 25 mm NH4HCO3 were added, and enzymatic digestion was performed overnight at room temperature. Finally, 20 μl of 40% H2O, 60% CH3CN, 0.1% HCOOH were added, and samples were left for 2 h at room temperature. Peptide extracts (0.5 μl) were mixed with an equal volume of either α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (10 mg/ml, 50% CH3CN; Sigma-Aldrich) or 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (10 mg/ml, 20% CH3CN; Sigma-Aldrich). Protease-generated peptide mixtures were analyzed by MALDI-TOF (Voyager-DE STR, Applied Biosystems). Crystals were obtained using the dried droplet method, and ∼100 MALDI mass spectra were averaged per spot. Mass spectrometry measurements were carried out at a maximum accelerating potential of 20 kV, in the positive reflectron mode. Peak lists were generated by the Data Explorer software (Applied Biosystems), and processed data were submitted to the FindPep software (available on the World Wide Web) using the following parameters: protein sequence, TrmFOBS; mass tolerance, 50 ppm; digest reagents, trypsin or AspN/N-terminal Glu or none; fixed modification, carbamidomethylation of cysteines; possible modification, oxidation of methionines. Fluorescence spectra of wild-type TrmFOBS and C53A mutant (2–5 μm) were recorded on a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian) with excitation and emission slit widths of 5 nm. The flavin was excited at 370 and 450 nm, and the resulting emission was monitored from 380 to 700 nm or from 465 to 700 nm, respectively. The tryptophans of the proteins were excited at 295 nm, and the emission was monitored from 310 to 500 nm. The FAD and Trp fluorescence emissions were also recorded in the presence of different concentrations of freshly prepared KI. The change in the fluorescence intensity of the fluorophore as a function of quencher concentration is expected to obey the Stern-Volmer law, F0/F = 1 + Ksv [KI], where F and F0 are the fluorescence intensities in the presence and absence of quencher, respectively, and Ksv is the Stern-Volmer constant. The nonlinear dependence of the tryptophan fluorescence intensity as a function of iodide concentration, which is typical for a protein containing more than one type of fluorescent tryptophan residue, was fitted to the extended Stern-Volmer equation that takes into account the relative degree of exposure of the various fluorophores, F/F0∑fi/(1+Ki[KI]eVi[KI])(Eq. 1) where fi, Ki, and Vi are the fractional fluorescence intensity, dynamic quenching, and volume constants for fluorescent residue i, respectively (22Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar, 23Geddes C.D. Apperson K. Karolin J. Birch D.J. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 293: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the particular case of TrmFOBS, the solvent accessibilities of the two tryptophans of the protein are very different, Trp-20 being barely accessible, whereas Trp-286 is largely exposed to solvent (Fig. 1; Trp-20 and Trp-286 are equivalent to Trp-18 and Trp-283 in TrmFOTT, respectively). Assuming that Trp-20 is completely buried (dynamic quenching constant KTrp-20 of zero) and that there is no static quenching for either residue, the data in Fig. 7B were fitted to the following. F/F0=fTrp-286/(1+KTrp-286[KI])+fTrp-20(Eq. 2) The fraction of the initial fluorophore accessible to KI, Trp-286, is calculated as fa = f0Trp-286/(f0Trp-286 + f0Trp-20). High pressure experiments were carried out using a 5 × 5-mm quartz cuvette contained within a high pressure cell made of maraging steel and surrounded by a copper jacket for temperature control. The sample compartments of the SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer were modified to accept the high pressure system, which has four sapphire windows for both transmission and 90° fluorescence studies (24Hamdane D. Kiger L. Hoa G.H. Dewilde S. Uzan J. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Moens L. Marden M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36809-36814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The tryptophans of oxidized TrmFOBS protein at a final concentration of ∼35 μm were excited at 295 nm (8-nm slits), and the emission was monitored from 310 to 450 nm (4-nm slits), whereas FAD was excited at 450 nm, and the emission spectra were collected between 465 and 570 nm. No photobleaching was observed under our experimental conditions. Following each pressure increment, the enzyme was allowed to equilibrate at least 5 min before fluorescence emission recording. The standard volume change during the unfolding, ΔV0, at the temperature T, was determined from the simulation of the equation, ΔV0 = (∂ΔG0(p)/∂p)T, where ΔG0(p) is the standard Gibbs free energy change at pressure p, determined from the equilibrium constant for a two-state transition model, ΔG0(p) = −RT ln Keq = −RT ln((FN − Fp)/(Fp − FD)), where Fp is the fluorescence intensity at pressure p, and FN and FD are the asymptotic intensity values of the native and the denatured states, respectively. The standard Gibbs free energy change at 1 bar is obtained according to the equation, ΔG0 = lim ΔG0(p) when p→ 1 bar. The half-transition pressure (P½) is given by the equation, P½ = −ΔG0/ΔV0. Residues in the vicinity of the flavin (Fig. 1) are conserved across the TrmFO family (supplemental Fig. 2). Based on the crystal structure of TrmFOTT and on the C51A variant, which retained less than 3% activity of the wild-type enzyme, the highly conserved cysteine (Cys-51 in TrmFOTT) was proposed to act as a nucleophile in catalysis (Scheme 1A) (3Nishimasu H. Ishitani R. Yamashita K. Iwashita C. Hirata A. Hori H. Nureki O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 8180-8185Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The corresponding residue in TrmFOBS, Cys-53, appears also to be essential for U54 methylation because m5U54-containing tRNA is not synthesized by C53A TrmFOBS (Fig. 2A), even in the presence of a large excess of NAD(P)H and CH2THF. Complete loss of activity cannot be caused by protein structure disruption because wild-type and C53A TrmFOBS exhibit similar far-UV circular dichroism spectra (data not shown). Moreover, the Cys-53 mutation did not significantly affect tRNA binding, as evidenced by the nearly identical dissociation constants for both wild-type and C53A TrmFOBS (0.3 and 0.36 μm, respectively; Fig. 2B). Covalent intermediates, formed by Michael addition between a cysteine nucleophile and the C6 position of the targeted uridine or cytosine base, have been identified in S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent RNA m5U and m5C methyltransferases (6Kealey J.T.

Structure. 2011; 19: 282-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) these covalent protein-RNA intermediates. Similarly, the formation of a 5,6-dihydropyrimidine intermediate resulting from covalent catalysis in TrmFOBS was ascertained using a 31-mer B. subtilis mini-tRNAAsp containing 5-fluorouridine at the target position (5-FU-mini-RNA; Fig. 3A) (Scheme 1B). As visualized on SDS-PAGE after protein Coomassie Blue staining, even in the absence of the addition of CH2THF and NAD(P)H, TrmFOBS forms a complex with 5-FU-mini-RNA that migrates more slowly than free enzyme (Fig. 3B). The adduct appears to be covalent because it is stable at high temperature in the presence of detergent and during migration on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Furthermore, oxidized and reduced TrmFOBS reacted similarly with 5-FU-mini-RNA (data not shown), suggesting that the redox state of FAD is not decisive for the formation of the covalent intermediate. The ability of the C53A mutant to trap a covalent intermediate with 5-FU-mini-RNA was also probed to examine the potential role of Cys-53 as a nucleophile in catalysis. Surprisingly, the covalent complex was still generated, even in the absence of added CH2THF, indicating that Cys-53 is not the catalytic nucleophile in TrmFOBS. The RNA-TrmFOBS covalent complex is readily isolated from nonreacted RNA and protein by anion exchange chromatography (Fig. 3C). In our experimental conditions, we estimate that 7–10% of C53A TrmFOBS forms a covalent complex with 5-FU-mini-RNA. Our results indicate a covalent mechanism for tRNA methylation, which necessarily implicates a nucleophilic residue. To investigate whether this nucleophile is a cysteine, the formation of covalent complex was probed in the presence of iodoacetamide, an alkylating agent that irreversibly modifies reduced cysteines. As shown in Fig. 4A, increasing the iodoacetamide concentration drastically impairs the covalent complex formation with C53A TrmFOBS, indicating that a cysteine residue, other than Cys-53, is most likely the nucleophile. Besides Cys-53, two other cysteines (Cys-193 and Cy"

In ML-II, many lysosomal acid hydrolases are mistargeted out of cells, and lysosomes become filled with undigested substrates, which explains inclusion cell disease as an alternative name for this disease. In this study, we revealed various cellular phenotypes in ML-II skin fibroblasts. We quantitated phospholipid and cholesterol within cells and showed ∼2-fold accumulation in ML-II as compared with normal cells. Lysosomal pH of ML-II cells was higher than that of normal cells (5.29 ± 0.08 versus 4.79 ± 0.10, p < 0.001). The proliferated lysosomes in ML-II cells were accumulated ∼3-fold in amount as compared with normal cells. Intracellular logistics including endocytosis and mannose 6-phosphate receptor recycling were impaired in ML-II cells. To confirm whether these ML-II cellular phenotypes derive from deficient lysosomal acid hydrolases within lysosomes, we performed supplementation of lysosomal enzymes using a partially purified total enzyme mixture, which was derived from the conditioned culture medium of normal skin fibroblasts after NH4Cl treatment. This supplementation corrected all of the previously described ML-II phenotypes. In addition, the autophagic and mitochondrial impairment that we have previously reported improved, and inclusion bodies disappeared on electron micrography following total lysosomal enzyme supplementation.

The first step of mannose 6-phosphorylation of lysosomal enzymes, which is required for their localization in lysosomes, is mediated by GlcNAc-phosphotransferase (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:lysosomal-enzyme N-acetylglucosaminephosphotransferase; EC 2.7.8.17) (1Kornfeld S.

In the case of ML-II, however, there is no ERT to date as lysosomes lack dozens of enzymes targeted by the M6P receptor-dependent pathway. Extrinsic replacement of GlcNAc-phosphotransferase also seems to be difficult because of its hexameric composition and localization. In this study, we analyzed ML-II skin fibroblasts and clarified various cellular phenotypes including the pH increase of lysosomes, accumulation of cholesterol, and impaired intracellular trafficking. These impaired cellular functions were corrected and inclusion bodies disappeared following extrinsic total lysosomal enzyme supplementation. We obtained skin fibroblasts from an unaffected individual and three individuals affected with ML-II. Samples were collected after obtaining written informed consent according to the institute's regulations for using human cells.

We calculated the LysoTracker/DAPI intensity ratio, which estimates the lysosomal amount (i.e. number and size) in each cell. We prepared skin fibroblasts in glass bottom dishes. BODIPY FL C5-ceramide (BODIPY-Cer) complexed to BSA (Invitrogen) was purchased and diluted in standard culture medium at a concentration of 2.5 nm. Cells were cultured in this medium for 30 min, washed once with PBS, and directly observed by confocal microscopy. We also tested the attachment of BODIPY-Cer to plasma membrane in ice-cold medium, which showed no difference between normal, ML-II, and enzyme-treated ML-II cells. Cells were incubated in standard culture medium containing M6P receptor antibody at 1:75 concentration. For the 30-min uptake test, cells were incubated with antibody-containing medium for 30 min, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and quickly fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. Cells were treated with secondary antibody following permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min and blocking with 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. For examination of uptake and subcellular distribution, we incubated cells with antibody-containing medium for 1 h, washed twice with PBS, and then followed by incubation in standard culture medium without antibody for 2 h. Subsequent processing was the same as for the 30-min assay described above. We used Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) as the secondary antibody against the M6P receptor antibody. Skin fibroblasts were collected and subjected to sonication in pure water with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentration was measured (protein assay rapid kit; Wako) and mixed with sample buffer containing SDS. For each lane, 10 μg was applied to a 16% polyacrylamide gel. After SDS-PAGE, protein was transferred to a PVDF membrane followed by blocking in 5% skim milk. For the primary antibodies, anti-LC3 was used at a 1:2000 dilution, and anti-ATP6V1B2, anti-ATP6V0D1, and anti-mucolipin-1 were used at 1:5000 dilution followed by the secondary antibody conjugated with HRP. Detection was performed with chemical luminescence (SuperSignal West Dura; Thermo Scientific). We cultured normal skin fibroblasts with standard culture medium containing 20 mm NH4Cl. After 7 days of culture, supernatant was retrieved and passed through a 0.2-μm sterilization filter to remove large debris and living cells, and lysosomal enzyme activities were measured. Filtered supernatant was centrifuged in a 5000-Da molecular mass filter column (Vivaspin 15R; Sartorius Stedim Biotech) at 0 °C. As a result, this enzyme mixture was condensed into ∼0.025 volume. Finally, we diluted the total lysosomal enzyme mixture to a concentration of 600 nmol/h/mg of protein of α-mannosidase activity with serum-free DMEM. Total lysosomal enzyme supplementation was performed by culturing cells with this enzyme mixture for 7 days. After 7 days, medium was changed to standard culture medium, and samples were subjected to each assay within 24 h. Subsequently within this study, we describe this total lysosomal enzyme supplementation method simply as “enzyme treatment.” We used normal and ML-II cells cultured with standard culture medium for untreated groups, which were divided and seeded at the same time as treated cells. Phospholipid (phospholipids C-test; Wako) and cholesterol (Amplex Red cholesterol assay kit; Molecular Probes) measurements were performed according to the manufacturers' instructions. Activities of lysosomal enzymes were measured by the standard method using artificial 4-methylumbelliferyl substrates. In short, samples were incubated with artificial substrates in acidic phosphate or citrate buffer at 37 °C for 1 h, and fluorescence of excitation at 365 nm/emission at 450 nm was measured with a microplate reader. In the case of galactocerebrosidase, we used 6-hexadecanoylamino-4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-galactopyranoside (Slater & Frith Ltd.) and measured fluorescence of excitation at 385 nm/emission at 450 nm. Enzyme activities were calculated as nmol/h/mg of protein or nmol/h/μl. We first confirmed the normality of values by Shapiro-Wilk W test for each assessment. Next, the distribution of values was tested by F test. For testing significant differences between the samples, we applied two-tailed Student's t test or two-tailed Welch's t test especially in samples that were not equally distributed. All data were obtained from three independent measurements for each sample and reported as means ± S.D. Significant differences are indicated in FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4. We first examined the validity of the total lysosomal enzyme supplementation method (enzyme treatment). NH4Cl is known to cause mistargeting of lysosomal enzymes, resulting in their extracellular secretion (15Brown J.A. Novak E.K. Swank R.T. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1894-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We generated total lysosomal enzyme mixture from the supernatant of normal skin fibroblasts treated with NH4Cl. The supernatant contained many kinds of lysosomal enzymes, and their secretion profile was similar to that of natural ML-II culture supernatant not treated with NH4Cl (Fig. 1A). After enzyme treatment, the activities of major lysosomal acid hydrolases increased in ML-II cells, although the degree of the increase for each enzyme differed between the enzymes (from 3.2% of normal for β-galactosidase to 92.1% of normal for β-glucuronidase) (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. 1A). As enzyme uptake was inhibited by M6P in a concentration-dependent manner, it is considered that the lysosomal enzymes were taken up by the M6P receptor (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. 1B). Incorporated lysosomal enzymes were co-localized with the lysosomal marker, lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP-2) (Fig. 1D). These results show that lysosomal enzymes were supplied to the defective lysosomes of ML-II skin fibroblasts. β-Glucosidase activity is not defective by nature in ML-II skin fibroblasts as it is targeted to lysosomes by lysosomal integral membrane protein 2 (LIMP-2) (16Reczek D. Schwake M. Schröder J. Hughes H. Blanz J. Jin X. Brondyk W. Van Patten S. Edmunds T. Saftig P. Cell. 2007; 131: 770-783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). We confirmed that β-glucosidase was not defective in ML-II and not influenced by the addition of M6P (supplemental Fig. 2). This result indicates that these experiments were appropriately performed. To quantitate lysosomal storage materials, we measured phospholipid and cholesterol in total cellular lysate. Phospholipid and total cholesterol were accumulated about 2-fold in ML-II skin fibroblasts as compared with normal cells, and enzyme treatment decreased these amounts to near normal levels (Fig. 2A). Next, we investigated the amount and localization of these storage materials using fluorescent micrography. Lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA), a phospholipid and marker of late endosome and lysosome (17Kobayashi T. Beuchat M.H. Lindsay M. Frias S. Palmiter R.D. Sakuraba H. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 18Kolter T. Sandhoff K. FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 1700-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), accumulated in ML-II cells and showed a decrease after enzyme treatment on immunocytochemistry (Fig. 2B). Storage of free cholesterol in natural ML-II skin fibroblasts and its clearance by enzyme treatment were also confirmed by filipin staining (Fig. 2C). Lysosomal acidification is essential for the proper function of lysosomes and is one of the definitions of lysosomes. Lysosomal pH of ML-II cells was significantly higher than that of normal cells (5.29 ± 0.08 versus 4.79 ± 0.10, p < 0.001). Enzyme treatment recovered lysosomal acidification in ML-II cells toward a near normal level (4.99 ± 0.07, p < 0.001) (Fig. 3A). To elucidate the effect of storage materials on lysosomal pH, we loaded cholesterol in culture medium of normal cells. Cholesterol loading increased the lysosomal pH dose dependently: from 4.79 ± 0.10 without loading to 5.20 ± 0.08 and 5.59 ± 0.09 with 1/1000 and 1/100 cholesterol loading, respectively (Fig. 3B). Lysosomal acidic pH is produced and modulated by vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) and mucolipin-1. However, analysis of V-ATPase V0d1 subunit, V1B2 subunit, and mucolipin-1 by Western blotting of total cellular lysate from normal and ML-II skin fibroblasts cultured under standard culture conditions revealed no clear difference in V1/V0 protein ratio and the amount of mucolipin-1 protein (controlled by β-actin) between normal and ML-II cells (supplemental Fig. 4A). On immunocytochemistry, V-ATPase V1B2 subunit was co-localized with LysoTracker in both normal and ML-II cells and showed a similar pattern (supplemental Fig. 4B). One specific feature of ML-II skin fibroblasts is the inclusion bodies that represent proliferated lysosomes filled with undigested substrates. These proliferated lysosomes can be observed in ML-II cells using LysoTracker staining (Fig. 4A). To evaluate the lysosomal amount in each cell numerically, we determined the intensity ratio of LysoTracker and DAPI fluorescence of living cells; the lysosomal amount was about 3-fold higher in ML-II cells as compared with normal cells. LysoTracker fluorescence on micrography and the estimated lysosomal amount were decreased after enzyme treatment in ML-II cells (Fig. 4B). Intracellular logistics including the endocytic pathway and M6P receptor movement were analyzed by BODIPY-Cer targeting (Fig. 5A) and M6P receptor antibody uptake tests (Fig. 5B), respectively. Similar to a previous study using BODIPY-lactosylceramide (19Puri V. Watanabe R. Dominguez M. Sun X. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), fluorescence was observed in the Golgi apparatus of normal cells and in the endosome and lysosome of ML-II cells 30 min after BODIPY-Cer treatment. This endosomal and lysosomal pattern was not changed by the duration of BODIPY-Cer uptake from 30 min up to 6 h and was congruent with LysoTracker staining (supplemental Fig. 3). Enzyme treatment of ML-II cells changed the pattern of ceramide toward Golgi distribution, although slight endosomal and lysosomal entrapment remained. The M6P receptor antibody uptake test showed a vesicular and Golgi pattern in ML-II cells but only a vesicular pattern in normal cells. This pattern was not changed by the duration of antibody uptake from 30 min up to 6 h. After enzyme treatment of ML-II cells, the M6P receptor distribution changed from the Golgi pattern to a vesicular pattern, similar to that in normal cells. When we incubated ML-II cells for 1 h with antibody followed by 2 h without antibody, the antibody was only detected as a vesicular pattern. In normal cells, antibody was hardly detected as it is likely to be degraded within 2 h following incubation without antibody. We have previously reported the impairment of autophagy and mitochondria in ML-II skin fibroblasts (20Otomo T. Higaki K. Nanba E. Ozono K. Sakai N. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2009; 98: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). After enzyme treatment of ML-II skin fibroblasts, LC3-II, a specific autophagosome marker (21Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5466) Google Scholar), was decreased in immunoblotting of total cell lysates (Fig. 6A). Immunocytochemistry also showed a decreased number of LC3-positive large vesicles after enzyme treatment, which were highly accumulated without treatment (Fig. 6B). Mitochondria were usually tubular and showed a constructive network in normal cells but were thinned and fragmented in ML-II cells. Enzyme treatment of ML-II cells resulted in a remarkable recovery of mitochondrial structure on MitoTracker staining, showing a normal tubular form and network (Fig. 6C). Many inclusion bodies were seen in ML-II skin fibroblasts using phase-contrast micrography, and they were decreased following enzyme treatment (Fig. 7A). Electron micrography also showed many vacuoles containing dense, uniform materials in untreated ML-II skin fibroblasts. These vacuoles, thought to be inclusion bodies, disappeared after enzyme treatment together with the recovery of many intracellular structures including mitochondria and some void vacuoles (Fig. 7B). In this study, we describe two important results for understanding the pathogenesis of ML-II. First are the various cellular phenotypes of ML-II skin fibroblasts including quantitative analyses and imaging of impaired cellular functions; second is their correction by total lysosomal enzyme supplementation. Phase-contrast micrography of ML-II skin fibroblasts shows accumulation of dense vacuoles, inclusion bodies, that are considered to be swollen and proliferated lysosomes filled with undigested substrates resulting from the lack of lysosomal acid hydrolases. Storage materials in lysosomes are thought to be a mixture of a range of various substrates as ML-II lysosomes lack dozens of lysosomal enzymes. Using lectin staining, Kawashima et al. (22Kawashima I. Ohsawa M. Fukushige T. Nagayama Y. Niida Y. Kotani M. Tajima Y. Kanekura T. Kanzaki T. Sakuraba H. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2007; 378: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) reported that GM2 ganglioside and some glycoconjugates were accumulated in ML-II cells because of the lack of β-hexosaminidase A, sialidase, β-galactosidase, and α-mannosidase. On the other hand, ML-II skin fibroblasts are well known to be stained by filipin, which indicates free cholesterol accumulation within endosomes and lysosomes (23Vanier M.T. Rodriguez-Lafrasse C. Rousson R. Gazzah N. Juge M.C. Pentchev P.G. Revol A. Louisot P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1096: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In this study, we quantitated the amounts of phospholipid and total cholesterol in ML-II total cellular lysate for the first time. In addition, to see the localization of these lipids, LBPA and filipin staining was performed with fluorescence microscopy. LBPA, which is a particular kind of phospholipid that is a marker of late endosomes and lysosomes, has never been investigated in ML-II cells. Phospholipid and LBPA were accumulated in ML-II skin fibroblasts. Together with the result of measurement of lysosomal amount, the inclusion bodies accumulated in ML-II skin fibroblasts originated from late endosomes and lysosomes, although we still believe that these two organelles are a hybrid and cannot be clearly distinguished from each other. Free cholesterol accumulation was obvious by filipin fluorescence staining in ML-II fibroblasts, which is similar to Niemann-Pick type C disease. In Niemann-Pick type C disease, the total amount of cholesterol is not clearly increased; only its distribution is changed to accumulation in late endosomes (17Kobayashi T. Beuchat M.H. Lindsay M. Frias S. Palmiter R.D. Sakuraba H. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In our study, we measured the total amount of cholesterol in ML-II cells and showed a significant increase. Both the amount and the distribution of cholesterol are changed in ML-II as compared with normal cells, which is different from the results seen in Niemann-Pick type C disease. In this study, we found that intracellular logistics, such as endocytosis and M6P receptor recycling, were impaired in ML-II cells. There is no primary defect of M6P receptor movement in ML-II cells (24Braulke T. Bonifacino J.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). However, there seems to be a secondary impairment of M6P receptor trafficking, probably due to the pre-existing massive storage materials such as cholesterol in endosomes and lysosomes as cholesterol has been reported to modulate membrane traffic along the endocytic pathway in sphingolipid storage diseases (19Puri V. Watanabe R. Dominguez M. Sun X. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). M6P receptors cycle between membranes such as plasma membrane, Golgi, and endosomes bidirectionally. In our M6P receptor antibody uptake study, the amount of M6P receptor in the perinuclear region in ML-II is higher than normal after 30 min of uptake. This indicates that M6P receptor movement through the perinuclear compartment appears delayed. This delay would seem to be cleared after 2 h of incubation. We suggest that M6P receptors moved from the perinuclear region to endosomes. However, we cannot exclude other potential explanations, such as the return of perinuclear antibody-labeled M6P receptor to the plasma membrane or elsewhere possibly causing detachment between M6P receptor and antibody or the bivalent antibody possibly cross-linking with the receptor and affecting the intracellular movement of M6P receptor. Intracellular M6P receptor recycling is important for the efficient uptake of lysosomal enzymes from the cell surface, and a smooth endocytic pathway is also important for the targeting of lysosomal enzymes from the cell surface to lysosomes. These two essential pathways are indirectly impaired in ML-II cells, and enzyme treatment was able to correct both pathways gradually. This improvement promotes efficient enzyme uptake and eventually makes total enzyme supplementation more effective. Lysosomal acid pH is mainly produced by the lysosomal vacuolar-type proton pump, V-ATPase, and mucolipin-1 has recently been reported to modulate lysosomal pH (25Casey J.R. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 50-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (1494) Google Scholar, 26Soyombo A.A. Tjon-Kon-Sang S. Rbaibi Y. Bashllari E. Bisceglia J. Muallem S. Kiselyov K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7294-7301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In several lysosomal storage disorders, abnormal lysosomal pH has been reported (27Bach G. Chen C.S. Pagano R.E. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1999; 280: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 28Kogot-Levin A. Zeigler M. Ornoy A. Bach G. Pediatr. Res. 2009; 65: 686-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This is the first study showing impaired lysosomal acidification in ML-II. Lysosomal pH was significantly increased in ML-II skin fibroblasts, and it was normalized by total lysosomal enzyme supplementation. Cholesterol loading effectively increased lysosomal pH in normal cells. These results indicate that storage materials, such as cholesterol within lysosomes, increase lysosomal pH by an unknown mechanism. Accumulated substrates may be at a higher pH, or storage materials may inhibit the function of the proton pump. It is also possible that cholesterol accumulation changes the composition of the membrane lipid raft, which influences proton pump function. V-ATPase is made up of various subunits, and one study has revealed the importance of the lipid raft and V1/V0 subunit ratio in modulating its acidifying function (29Lafourcade C. Sobo K. Kieffer-Jaquinod S. Garin J. van der Goot F.G. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, protein analysis of V-ATPase and mucolipin-1 showed no clear differences in Western blotting and localization between normal and ML-II cells. From these results, lysosomal maturation is impaired by defective lysosomal acid hydrolases and acidification, although the mechanism of increased lysosomal pH remains unclear. Lysosomal storage possibly causes autophagic impairment and leads to accumulation of aberrant mitochondria as secondary storage (30Settembre C. Fraldi A. Jahreiss L. Spampanato C. Venturi C. Medina D. de Pablo R. Tacchetti C. Rubinsztein D.C. Ballabio A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). In the case of ML-II, autophagic and mitochondrial impairment has been reported in skin fibroblasts, mice, and an autopsy case (20Otomo T. Higaki K. Nanba E. Ozono K. Sakai N. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2009; 98: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 31Boonen M. van Meel E. Oorschot V. Klumperman J. Kornfeld S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2011; 22: 1135-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 32Kobayashi H. Takahashi-Fujigasaki J. Fukuda T. Sakurai K. Shimada Y. Nomura K. Ariga M. Ohashi T. Eto Y. Otomo T. Sakai N. Ida H. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2011; 102: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Autophagic status and mitochondrial structure recovered after enzyme treatment of ML-II cells in our study. It is therefore suggested that mitochondrial turnover is also returned to a normal state combined with the functional recovery of autophagy and lysosomes following clearance of storage materials within lysosomes by enzyme treatment. Lysosomal accumulation drives lysosome-related gene expression and increases the amount of lysosomes (33Sardiello M. Palmieri M. di Ronza A. Medina D.L. Valenza M. Gennarino V.A. Di Malta C. Donaudy F. Embrione V. Polishchuk R.S. Banfi S. Parenti G. Cattaneo E. Ballabio A. Science. 2009; 325: 473-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar). On the contrary, clearance of accumulation by enzyme treatment significantly decreased the amount of lysosomes in our study, which is clearly demonstrated on electron micrography. For the first time, we succeeded in the reversal of inclusion bodies by total lysosomal enzyme supplementation. Total lysosomal enzyme supplementation is based on the idea that the enzyme mixture is taken up by M6P receptors on the cell surface and targeted to lysosomes because there is no primary defect of the M6P receptor-dependent targeting pathway itself in ML-II. This concept is similar to that of other commercially available ERTs. Our procedure clearly reduced lysosomal storage and improved cellular phenotypes in ML-II cells and is applicable for the functional correction of ML-II cells. This may imply a potential method for “total lysosomal ERT” in ML-II patients. Animal studies will be indispensable to confirm the in vivo applicability of this enzyme treatment as a therapeutic concept. Furthermore, the classical and convenient method for obtaining the total enzyme mixture using NH4Cl may provide ERT for not only ML-II but also for other lysosomal storage disorders for which ERT has not been developed. In conclusion, storage materials and various cellular phenotypes of ML-II are demonstrated quantitatively in our study. It is presumed that the excessive lysosomal storage materials are the main cause of the diseased state in ML-II and induce various cellular phenotypes that are intricately intertwined with each other. Finally, these phenotypes were reversed by supplementation with an enriched total lysosomal enzyme mixture derived from normal skin fibroblasts, which suggests a potential new, alternative therapeutic approach for ML-II.

https://openalex.org/W2117160465,"Recent transcription of GAL genes transiently leaves an H3K4 methylation mark at their promoters, providing an epigenetic memory for the recent transcriptional activity. However, the physiological significance of this mark is enigmatic. In our study, we show that the transient H3K4 di- and trimethylation at recently transcribed GAL1 inhibited the reinduction of GAL1. The H3K4 methylation functioned by recruiting the Isw1 ATPase onto GAL1 and thereby limiting the action of RNA polymerase II during GAL1 reactivation. Strikingly, the H3K4 methylation was also observed at the promoters of inositol- and fatty acid-responsive genes after recent transcription and played a negative role in their reinduction. Taken together, our data present a new mechanism by which H3K4 methylation regulates gene transcription."

https://openalex.org/W2062272761,"Group V-secreted phospholipase A(2) (GV sPLA(2)) hydrolyzes bacterial phospholipids and initiates eicosanoid biosynthesis. Here, we elucidate the role of GV sPLA(2) in the pathophysiology of Escherichia coli pneumonia. Inflammatory cells and bronchial epithelial cells both express GV sPLA(2) after pulmonary E. coli infection. GV(-/-) mice accumulate fewer polymorphonuclear leukocytes in alveoli, have higher levels of E. coli in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung, and develop respiratory acidosis, more severe hypothermia, and higher IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α levels than GV(+/+) mice after pulmonary E. coli infection. Eicosanoid levels in bronchoalveolar lavage are similar in GV(+/+) and GV(-/-) mice after lung E. coli infection. In contrast, GV(+/+) mice have higher levels of prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)), PGF(2α), and 15-keto-PGE(2) in lung and express higher levels of ICAM-1 and PECAM-1 on pulmonary endothelial cells than GV(-/-) mice after lung infection with E. coli. Selective deletion of GV sPLA(2) in non-myeloid cells impairs leukocyte accumulation after pulmonary E. coli infection, and lack of GV sPLA(2) in either bone marrow-derived myeloid cells or non-myeloid cells attenuates E. coli clearance from the alveolar space and the lung parenchyma. These observations show that GV sPLA(2) in bone marrow-derived myeloid cells as well as non-myeloid cells, which are likely bronchial epithelial cells, participate in the regulation of the innate immune response to pulmonary infection with E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W2014066444,"Mammalian testis-determining factor SRY contains a high mobility group box, a conserved eukaryotic motif of DNA bending. Mutations in SRY cause XY gonadal dysgenesis and somatic sex reversal. Although such mutations usually arise de novo in spermatogenesis, some are inherited and so specify male development in one genetic background (the father) but not another (the daughter). Here, we describe the biophysical properties of a representative inherited mutation, V60L, within the minor wing of the L-shaped domain (box position 5). Although the stability and DNA binding properties of the mutant domain are similar to those of wild type, studies of SRY-induced DNA bending by subnanosecond time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) revealed enhanced conformational fluctuations leading to long range variation in bend angle. (1)H NMR studies of the variant protein-DNA complex demonstrated only local perturbations near the mutation site. Because the minor wing of SRY folds on DNA binding, the inherited mutation presumably hinders induced fit. Stopped-flow FRET studies indicated that such frustrated packing leads to accelerated dissociation of the bent complex. Studies of SRY-directed transcriptional regulation in an embryonic gonadal cell line demonstrated partial activation of downstream target Sox9. Our results have demonstrated a nonlocal coupling between DNA-directed protein folding and protein-directed DNA bending. Perturbation of this coupling is associated with a genetic switch poised at the threshold of activity."
https://openalex.org/W2064531425,"Dictyostelium Formin C (ForC) is involved in the regulation of local actin cytoskeleton reorganization (e.g. during cellular adhesion or migration). ForC contains formin homology 2 and 3 (FH2 and -3) domains and an N-terminal putative GTPase-binding domain (GBD) but lacks a canonical FH1 region. To better understand the role of the GBD, its structure, dynamics, lipid-binding properties, and cellular functions were analyzed by NMR and CD spectroscopy and by in vivo fluorescence microscopy. Moreover, the program CS-Rosetta was tested for the structure prediction based on chemical shift data only. The ForC GBD adopts an ubiquitin-like α/β-roll fold with an unusually long loop between β-strands 1 and 2. Based on the lipid-binding data, the presence of DPC micelles induces the formation of α-helical secondary structure and a rearrangement of the tertiary structure. Lipid-binding studies with a mutant protein and a peptide suggest that the β1-β2 loop is not relevant for these conformational changes. Whereas small amounts of negatively charged phosphoinositides (1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phosphoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) and 1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phosphoinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate)) lower the micelle concentration necessary to induce the observed spectral changes, other negatively charged phospholipids (1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phospho-L-serine) and 1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'-rac-glycerol)) had no such effect. Interestingly, bicelles and micelles composed of diacylphosphocholines had no effect on the GBD structure. Our data suggest a model in which part of the large positively charged surface area of the GBD mediates localization to specific membrane patches, thereby regulating interactions with signaling proteins. Our cellular localization studies show that both the GBD and the FH3 domain are required for ForC targeting to cell-cell contacts and early phagocytic cups and macropinosomes."

https://openalex.org/W1979286857,"Insertions of spliceosomal introns are very rare events during evolution of vertebrates and the mechanisms governing creation of novel intron(s) remain obscure. Largely, gene structures of melanocortin (MC) receptors are characterized by intron-less architecture. However, recently a few exceptions have been reported in some fishes. This warrants a systematic survey of MC receptors for understanding intron insertion events during vertebrate evolution.We have compiled an extended list of MC receptors from different vertebrate genomes with variations in fishes. Notably, the closely linked MC2Rs and MC5Rs from a group of ray-finned fishes have three and one intron insertion(s), respectively, with conserved positions and intron phase. In both genes, one novel insertion was in the highly conserved DRY motif at the end of helix TM3. Further, the proto-splice site MAG↑R is maintained at intron insertion sites in these two genes. However, the orthologs of these receptors from zebrafish and tetrapods are intron-less, suggesting these introns are simultaneously created in selected fishes. Surprisingly, these novel introns are traceable only in four fish genomes. We found that these fish genomes are severely compacted after the separation from zebrafish. Furthermore, we also report novel intron insertions in P2Y receptors and in CHRM3. Finally, we report ultrasmall introns in MC2R genes from selected fishes.The current repository of MC receptors illustrates that fishes have no MC3R ortholog. MC2R, MC5R, P2Y receptors and CHRM3 have novel intron insertions only in ray-finned fishes that underwent genome compaction. These receptors share one intron at an identical position suggestive of being inserted contemporaneously. In addition to repetitive elements, genome compaction is now believed to be a new hallmark that promotes intron insertions, as it requires rapid DNA breakage and subsequent repair processes to gain back normal functionality."

The pore-forming toxin causes profound apoptosis within 3 h of exposure and in parallel supports activation of the defying MΦ. HlyA-induced apoptosis of MΦ remains steady for 24 h, is Toll-like receptor (TLR)-independent, and is driven by caspase-9 and caspase-7, thus involving the mitochondrial or intrinsic pathway. Cell activation is carried forward by time dependent up-regulation of varying TLRs. The promiscuous TLR association of HlyA prompted investigation, which revealed the β-prism lectin domain of HlyA simulated TLR4 up-regulation by jacalin, a plant lectin homologue besides expressing CD86 and type I cytokines TNF-α and IL-12. However, HlyA cytolytic protein domain up-regulated TLR2, which controlled CD40 for continuity of cell activation. Expression of TOLLIP before TLR2 and TLR6 abrogated TLR4, CD40, and CD86. We show that the transient expression of TOLLIP leading to curbing of activation-associated capabilities is a plausible feedback mechanism of MΦ to deploy TLR2 and prolong activation involving CD40 to encounter the HlyA cytolysin domain.

Vibrio cholerae El Tor O1 and non-O1 strains produce a water-soluble cytolytic exotoxin that has been designated HlyA or El Tor hemolysin (1Ichinose Y. Yamamoto K. Nakasone N. Tanabe M.J. Takeda T.

The PFTs lyse target eukaryotic cells and can exist in two stable states, a water-soluble monomer and an oligomeric integral membrane protein (3Heuck A.P. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9065-9073Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Apart from lysing erythrocytes and other mammalian cells, HlyA exhibits enterotoxicity in experimental diarrhea models (1Ichinose Y. Yamamoto K. Nakasone N. Tanabe M.J. Takeda T. Miwatani T. Iwanaga M. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1090-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has been implicated in causing diarrhea during cholera epidemic (4Coelho A. Andrade J.R. Vicente A.C. Salles C.A. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1995; 33: 114-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fully active 65-kDa toxin consists of a central cytolysin domain followed sequentially by two contiguous lectin domains, a β-trefoil domain homologous to the galactose-binding site of ricin and a β-prism domain homologous to the carbohydrate-binding site of the plant lectin jacalin (5Olson R. Gouaux E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 350: 997-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The C terminus β-prism lectin domain, suggested as the only functional sugar-binding site of HlyA, is susceptible to proteolytic deletion (6Dutta S. Mazumdar B. Banerjee K.K. Ghosh A.N. J. Bacteriol. 2010; 192: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). hemolysin antibody pore-forming toxin peritoneal cavity macrophages pathogen-associated molecular pattern Toll-like receptor. Macrophages (MΦ) reside in almost all tissues and are involved as important effector cells at all stages of the innate and adaptive immune response. MΦ are vigorously involved in host defense against microbial infection (7Ray A. Chattopadhyay K. Banerjee K.K. Biswas T. Immunol. Lett. 2003; 89: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 8Aderem A. Underhill D.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 593-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2112) Google Scholar). MΦ produce chemokines, cytokines, and other inflammatory mediators upon recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (9Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6247) Google Scholar) or molecules released by damaged host cells referred to as “danger signals” (10Matzinger P. Science. 2002; 296: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (3378) Google Scholar), which alert the remainder of the immune system of infection and injury. Several distinct classes of receptor proteins participate in PAMP sensing and triggering of signaling cascades, which culminate in expression of immune effector genes. Among such receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are an important group extensively studied in both vertebrates and invertebrates (11Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6751) Google Scholar, 12Beutler B. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 40: 845-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). TLRs, found on cells of the immune system, are sensors of invading pathogens (13Ozinsky A. Underhill D.M. Fontenot J.D. Hajjar A.M. Smith K.D. Wilson C.B. Schroeder L. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 13766-13771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar). PFTs such as pneumolysin from Streptococcus pneumoniae (14Malley R. Henneke P. Morse S.C. Cieslewicz M.J. Lipsitch M. Thompson C.M. Kurt-Jones E. Paton J.C. Wessels M.R. Golenbock D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Immunol. 2004; 172: 4866-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) have been reported to be recognized by TLR4. Here, we identify the TLRs that recognize HlyA and initiate signaling, thus enabling peritoneal cavity (PerC) MΦ to execute the first line of innate defense. Engagement of TLR by PAMP triggers the signaling pathway that drives the innate immune effector functions and leads to initiate and strengthen adaptive immunity (16Reis e Sousa C. Semin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 17Pasare C. Medzhitov R. Semin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). TLRs mediate downstream signaling by recruitment of MyD88 (myeloid differentiation factor 88) (18Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Kopp E. Stadlen A. Chen C. Ghosh S. Janeway Jr., C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 253-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar), leading to activation of IL-1 receptor-associated kinases, TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), followed by proinflammatory transcription factor NF-κB and stress-activated protein kinases (19Yamamoto M. Takeda K. Akira S. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 40: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). On the contrary, TLR4 and TLR2 signaling are inhibited by TOLLIP to check overzealous TLR influence (20Bulut Y. Faure E. Thomas L. Equils O. Arditi M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 987-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The immune cells of a host, in response to a natural immunogen, can take either of two pathways, that of activation or apoptosis. The capacity of an immunogen to drive MΦ activation is reflected by its ability to induce the costimulatory molecules CD80–CD86, activation molecule CD40, MHC class II (21Van Gool S.W. Vandenberghe P. de Boer M. Ceuppens J.L. Immunol. Rev. 1996; 153: 47-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Linsley P.S. Greene J.L. Brady W. Bajorath J. Ledbetter J.A. Peach R. Immunity. 1994; 1: 793-801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), and production of chemokines and cytokines. The cytokines associated with polarized type I responses of activated MΦ, the M1 phenotypes, include production of proinflammatory IL-12 and TNF-α. In contrast, M2 cells typically produce IL-10 (23Rauh M.J. Ho V. Pereira C. Sham A. Sly L.M. Lam V. Huxham L. Minchinton A.I. Mui A. Krystal G. Immunity. 2005; 23: 361-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the cells can get committed toward apoptosis. Listeriolysin O, a PFT induced apoptosis of murine lymphocytes at subnanomolar doses involving the initiator caspase-9 and the effector caspase-3 (15Carrero J.A. Calderon B. Unanue E.R. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 4866-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Similarly, several channel-forming toxins induce apoptosis at low concentrations (24Nelson K.L. Brodsky R.A. Buckley J.T. Cell. Microbiol. 1999; 1: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 25Bantel H. Sinha B. Domschke W. Peters G. Schulze-Osthoff K. Jänicke R.U. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26Chen Y. Zychlinsky A. Microb. Pathog. 1994; 17: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). V. cholerae HlyA also resulted in caspase-9- and caspase-3-mediated apoptosis of B-1a cells (27Mukherjee G. Biswas A. Banerjee K.K. Biswas T. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This study revealed that although HlyA induced apoptosis of the majority of PerC MΦ, some of the defying cells responded by up-regulating varying TLRs, expressing the activation molecule, and releasing type I cytokines. The sequential expression of TLR4, -2, and -6 was obligatory to detect the lectin and cytolysin domains of HlyA and execute activation-related commitments. The transient expression of TOLLIP, a known TLR suppressor was a mechanism for building MΦ survival strategies by integrating with fidelity the effects of two dissimilar HlyA domains in parallel to apoptosis. The HlyA monomer was purified from the culture supernatant of a non-O1 V. cholerae strain V2 grown in brain heart infusion (Difco) broth by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B, size-exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G-50 and chromatofocusing on PBE-94 (Pharmacia) (28Chattopadhyay K. Bhattacharyya D. Banerjee K.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4351-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because the native HlyA is resistant to proteolysis, the 50-kDa variant (VCC50) truncated at the C terminus β-prism lectin domain was prepared by restricted proteolysis with trypsin in 1.7 m urea, at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:100. Urea was removed by dialysis, and the 50-kDa variant was freed from HlyA by chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B. C57BL/6 mice were obtained from National Centre for Laboratory Animal Sciences (National Institute of Nutrition, Jamai-Osmania, Hyderabad, India) and maintained in the animal care facility of the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (Kolkata, India). The C3H/HeJ mice were gifted by the Institute of Life Sciences (Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India). The mice were housed in groups of six and given food and water ad libitum. The experiments with animals were conducted in accordance with the Animal Ethical Committee guidelines of National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (Kolkata, India). PerC MΦ of 6-week-old C57BL/6 or C3H/HeJ mice were cultured as described elsewhere (7Ray A. Chattopadhyay K. Banerjee K.K. Biswas T. Immunol. Lett. 2003; 89: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, the peritoneal washing containing the MΦ was collected in sterile Petri dishes and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 1.5 h. The cells of monocyte-MΦ lineage adhered on the surface of the Petri dishes to form a monolayer. Adhered cells were collected by centrifugation at 400 × g for 8 min and suspended in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen). Cells (200 μl) were seeded per well at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml in 96-well flat-bottomed plates (Corning). MΦ were cultured at 37 °C for designated periods in humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 with absence and presence of 0.5 μg/well HlyA, 0.5 μg/ml FSL-1 (Pam2CGDPKHPKSF) (InvivoGen), 5 μg/ml Pam3CSK4, 100 ng/ml LPS (Escherichia coli 0111:B4) (Sigma-Aldrich) or 1 μg/ml jacalin (Artocarpus integrifolia) (Sigma-Aldrich) in RPMI 1640 containing 5 units/ml penicillin, 5 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.1% gentamicin, 2% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories), and 0.1% insulin-transferrin-selenium (Invitrogen). For inhibition studies, MΦ were incubated with either 10 μg/ml purified anti-mouse TLR2 mAb (Functional Grade; eBioscience), 5 μg/ml purified anti-mouse TLR4 Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or both for 30 min prior to the addition of HlyA. Cells were cultured with and without HlyA and stained at 4 °C for 20 min with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse CD11b mAb (BD Pharmingen) followed by any one of FITC-conjugated anti-mouse TLR1 (eBioscience), TLR2, CD40, CD80 or CD86, or biotin-conjugated anti-mouse TLR4 (eBioscience) or MHC class II (I-Ab). Biotinylated Abs were recognized by streptavidin-FITC. To detect surface expression of TLR6, cells were stained with polyclonal anti-TLR6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A-FITC (Sigma-Aldrich). Parallel sets of cells were incubated with monoclonal Ig isotypes. Stained cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). 1 × 106 cells were cultured for 45 min with and without HlyA for flow cytometric detection of NF-κB translocation. Nuclei were prepared by incubating the cells with 1 ml of Hepes-Triton buffer (pH 7.4), containing 10 mm Hepes, 0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at 4 °C (29Blaecke A. Delneste Y. Herbault N. Jeannin P. Bonnefoy J. Y Beck A. Aubry J.P. Cytometry. 2002; 48: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Nuclei were washed with 1% BSA in PBS (pH 7.2) and stained with either FITC-conjugated anti-NF-κB p65 Ab or monoclonal Ig isotype (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min at 4 °C. After incubation, the nuclei were washed with PBS-BSA and counterstained with 1 μg/ml propidium iodide. Nuclei were gated on the basis of propidium iodide staining (FL-3), after doublet elimination by FL-3 area versus FL-3 width measurement. Voltage settings for FITC parameters were done with the isotype control. Release of IL-12 p70 (eBioscience), IL-10, and TNF-α (R&D Systems) in 24- and 48 h-old culture supernatants was measured in sandwich ELISA with pairs of Abs for binding and detection using ELISA kits according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was isolated from 1 × 106 MΦ using an RNAqueousTM-4PCR kit (Ambion). Equal amounts of RNA from cells treated with and without HlyA were reverse-transcribed using a RETROscriptTM kit (Ambion). cDNA served as template for the amplification of MyD88 and GAPDH transcripts by PCR in an automated thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems GeneAmp PCR System 2700) using SuperTaqTM polymerase (Promega). The primers for amplification of MyD88 and GAPDH were used as described elsewhere (30Ray A. Biswas T. Immunology. 2005; 114: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The images were captured using a gel documentation system (Ultra-Violet Products, U.K.). Amplified RT-PCR product of MyD88 was normalized for the relative quantity of amplified product of GAPDH using Ultra-Violet Products Vision Works LS software. Change in mRNA expression was presented as mean fold induction by HlyA relative to the untreated control. Cells cultured with and without HlyA monomer for 3 and 24 h were incubated with Fc block (anti-CD16/32) followed by phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse CD11b mAb (BD Pharmingen). Phosphatidylserine exposure was measured in these cells by annexin V-FITC and 7-amino actinomycin D (eBioscience) using an annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Pharmingen). To study whether HlyA-induced apoptosis is TLR4-dependent, cells were incubated with anti-mouse TLR4 Ab prior to the addition of HlyA and cultured for 3 h for detection of apoptosis. Intracellular caspase-8 and caspase-9 were detected in the cells by fixing and permeabilizing with Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Pharmingen) and staining with rabbit anti-mouse caspase-8 Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or caspase-9 Ab (Cell Signaling Technology), respectively, followed by FITC-conjugated goat polyclonal anti-rabbit Ig. Intracellular staining of caspase-3 was done with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse active caspase-3 mAb (BD Pharmingen). Treated cells were lysed in cold lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) centrifuged to clear the debris and incubated overnight with rabbit anti-mouse TLR4 Ab-bound (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-mouse TLR2 mAb-bound Protein A SepharoseTM CL-4B (Pharmacia). The Ag-Ab-bound beads were centrifuged, washed, boiled in Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min, and the immunoprecipitates were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. The electrophoresed proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and probed with rabbit anti-mouse MyD88 Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-mouse TLR4/anti-mouse TLR2 Ab for detection of the respective molecules in the MyD88·TLR4/MyD88·TLR2 complex. Immunoblotting was performed to detect the presence of TOLLIP, anti-apoptotic proteins, and caspases. The cell lysates were electrophoresed, Western-blotted, and incubated overnight with rabbit anti-mouse TOLLIP mAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-mouse Bcl-xL, caspase-6, or caspase-7 Ab (Cell Signaling Technology). The Western blots were imaged by incubation with HRP conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and ImmobilonTM Western Chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore). Results were expressed as the means ± S.E. where applicable, of three independent experiments. The data were analyzed by using one-way analysis of variance. A p value of < 0.05 was considered significant, and a p value of < 0.005 was considered highly significant. The TLR4-specific ligand LPS, TLR2 and -1 ligand Pam3CSK4, and TLR2 and -6 ligand FSL-1 up-regulated the respective TLRs on PerC MΦ of C57BL/6 mice (data not shown). Hence, MΦ was cultured with HlyA for 48 h in a time course study of TLR expression. Selective up-regulation of TLR4 was traced from as early as 2 h that continued until 48 h of cell incubation (Fig. 1A). Although not detected in the initial hours, TLR2 expression then that of TLR6 was found after 20 and 24 h of culture with HlyA, respectively, which continued until 48 h. Analysis of relative fluorescence intensity showed a maximum of 3.6-fold (3.61 ± 0.21 S.E., p < 0.05) increase in TLR4 expression followed by a 1.9-fold (1.89 ± 0.84 S.E., p < 0.05) and 1.7-fold (1.69 ± 0.24 S.E., p < 0.005) increase in TLR2 and TLR6 expression, respectively. The expression of TLR1, known to be associated with TLR2 expression, remained unaffected all along the time-course study. Unexpectedly, none of the participating TLRs were found to be present between 8 to 12 h of cell culture, when expression of TOLLIP, known to cast its inhibitory effects on TLR4, was detected at 10 h of culture (Fig. 1B). The data demonstrate that both TLR4 and TLR2, known to recognize absolutely dissimilar PAMPs, are required by MΦ to distinguish HlyA of V. cholerae in its entirety, but their temporal operations seemed to be monitored by TOLLIP. Next, we assessed whether TLR2 up-regulation of MΦ was TLR4-dependent because TLR2 expression through TLR4 signaling has been seen in endothelial cells (31Fan J. Frey R.S. Malik A.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1234-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The up-regulation of TLR2 recorded a drop of only 44% (44.01 ± 1.8 S.E., p < 0.05) and that of TLR6 of 33% in their expression when the cells were preincubated with neutralizing anti-TLR4 Ab before HlyA treatment (Fig. 1C). In TLR4 non-responder C3H/HeJ mice, HlyA treatment up-regulated TLR2 1.6-fold (1.63 ± 0.04 S.E., p < 0.005) over control confirming expression of TLR2 was an event by itself. RT-PCR indicated an increase in the mRNA level of MyD88 by 1.7-fold (1.66 ± 0.04 S.E., p < 0.05) in response to HlyA (Fig. 2A). Thus, we examined the time-dependent association of the adaptor molecule MyD88 with TLR4 and TLR2 by immunoprecipitation after exposure to HlyA (Fig. 2B). The MyD88·TLR4 complex was detected within 15 min of HlyA treatment that persisted until 60 min, whereas no such interaction was observed between MyD88 and TLR2, clearly showing that the PFT singularly depends on TLR4-mediated signaling. Nuclei, prepared from MΦ treated with and without HlyA for 40 min, were used for flow cytometric detection of nuclear translocation of the p65 (RelA) member of NF-κB family. HlyA induced the NF-κB translocation that was 1.8-fold (1.78 ± 0.09 S.E., p < 0.05) higher than the untreated control (Fig. 2C), showing that the transcription factor is responsible for the HlyA-induced MΦ response. MΦ, when pretreated with neutralizing anti-TLR4 Ab, showed 73% (73.15 ± 0.84 S.E., p < 0.05) inhibition of NF-κB-p65 translocation on the nuclei. The data indicate that nuclear translocation of NF-κB in response to HlyA treatment is dependent on TLR4 signaling. HlyA induced a 1.7-fold (1.75 ± 0.89 S.E., p < 0.05) increase of the activation molecule CD40 and 2-fold (2.01 ± 0.75 S.E., p < 0.005) increase of the co-stimulatory molecule CD86 as early as 2–4 h (Fig. 3A). However, there was no expression of the activation and the co-stimulatory molecules on MΦ between 8 to 12 h of HlyA treatment, when none of the participating TLRs could be traced. Interestingly, after 24 h of culture with HlyA, CD40 expression reappeared and was found to be up-regulated 1.5-fold (1.55 ± 0.68 S.E., p < 0.005) (Fig. 3A), although the expression of CD86 did not come back. The inability of the PFT to induce the expression of CD80 on the PerC MΦ supports HlyA-mediated selective up-regulation of B7–2 (CD86) member of the B7 family. In contrast to expression of the activation and co-stimulatory molecules, MHC class II (I-Ab) expression was traced later on at 18–24 h, with maximum increment in expression of 1.7-fold (1.73 ± 0.12 S.E., p < 0.005) at 18 h (Fig. 3B). Pretreatment of MΦ with neutralizing anti-TLR4 Ab inhibited CD86 expression by 48% (47.9 ± 2.94 S.E., p < 0.005) but did not have any effect on CD40 (Fig. 3C), demonstrating that HlyA-induced CD86 expression is TLR4-dependent. Because CD40 expression besides being independent of TLR4 signaling reappeared at a later hour (Fig. 3A), significance for its reappearance with regard to its role in cell activation was tested. It was found that at a later time (24 h), CD40 expression was strongly inhibited by 93% (92.5 ± 0.87 S.E., p < 0.005) with neutralizing anti-TLR2 Ab, 64% (64.15 ± 2.8 S.E., p < 0.005) with anti-TLR4 Ab, and 99.9% with both of the Abs together (Fig. 3D). The HlyA-induced expression of CD40 coupled to its inability to express CD86 in C3H/HeJ mice suggests TLR4-independent activity of CD40 but TLR4-dependent role of CD86 (Fig. 3E). Inhibition of CD40 by anti-TLR2 Ab in C3H/HeJ mice strongly supported the importance of TLR2 signaling in expression of the activation molecule (Fig. 3F), thus indicating that TLR2 played an independent role in cell activation. Preincubation of C57BL/6 MΦ with a pan-caspase inhibitor could neither increase nor inhibit HlyA-induced CD86 and CD40 expression, showing that TLR4 and -2-mediated cell activation is an apoptosis-independent event (data not shown) supported by the moderate presence of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL even after strong depletion due to parallel apoptosis (Fig. 3G). HlyA-treated MΦ (1 × 106) released 33 pg of IL-12 p70, 60.75 pg of TNF-α, and no IL-10 over untreated controls (Fig. 4, left bars). Preincubation of MΦ with neutralizing anti-TLR4 Ab prior to antigen treatment released 9.25 pg of IL-12 p70 and 23.5 pg of TNF-α over untreated cells showing 71.5% (71.55 ± 0.97 S.E., p < 0.05) and 60.6% (60.57 ± 0.71 S.E., p < 0.005) inhibition of the cytokines, respectively. However, pretreatment of MΦ with neutralizing anti-TLR2 Ab could not inhibit the release of the two cytokines. The HlyA-induced TLR4-dependent release of the two type I cytokines, IL-12 and TNF-α, was confirmed by the failure of HlyA to induce the release of both the cytokines by MΦ of C3H/HeJ mice (Fig. 4, right bars). The data show that unlike TLR2 and -4 control over the expression of the activation molecule CD40, TLR4 alone monitors the HlyA-induced cytokine release. The HlyA β-prism lectin homologue jacalin solely up-regulated TLR4, 2-fold (2.1 ± 0.58 S.E., p < 0.005) over control on MΦ of C57BL/6 mice but failed to do so of C3H/HeJ MΦ, indicating that the lectin is a ligand with specificity for TLR4 (Fig. 5). Jacalin did not express TLR2, CD86, and CD40 in both of the mice strains. Truncated VCC50 (lacking the β-prism lectin domain) treated MΦ isolated from both C57BL/6 and C3H/HeJ mice showed 3.2-fold (3.17 ± 0.27 S.E., p < 0.005) and 1.8-fold (1.82 ± 0.1 S.E., p < 0.005) up-regulation of TLR2, respectively. The 50-kDa truncated protein expressed CD86, 2.3-fold (2.31 ± 0.01 S.E., p < 0.005) and 1.7-fold (1.68 ± 0.05 S.E., p < 0.05), and CD40, 2.6-fold (2.61 ± 0.31 S.E., p < 0.005) and 1.9-fold (1.94 ± 0.15 S.E., p < 0.005), more over control in C57BL/6 and C3H/HeJ mice, respectively, thus indicating dependence of the cytolysin domain of full-length HlyA on TLR2 for executing its role in cell activation. Annexin V, which determines the number of cells undergoing apoptosis, and nuclear dye 7-amino actinomycin D, which ensures integrity of the cells, were simultaneously used in presence of HlyA monomer. The MΦ treated with HlyA for 3 h showed apoptosis of 87% (87.39 ± 0.82 S.E., p < 0.005) of the cells compared with 23% (22.88 ± 0.78 S.E.) of the untreated, and cells treated for 24 h with the PFT resulted in 88% (88.44 ± 1.07 S.E., p < 0.005) apoptotic cells compared with 23% (23.3 ± 1.73 S.E.) as control (Fig. 6A, left bars). MΦ apoptosis remained unaltered both in presence of neutralizing anti-TLR4 Ab (Fig. 6A, left bars) and in TLR4-hyporesponsive C3H/HeJ mice (Fig. 6A, right bars), indicating that apoptosis was a TLR4-independent event. HlyA-treated MΦ up-regulated caspase-9, an initiator caspase that participates in the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis by 1.7-fold (1.72 ± 0.37 S.E., p < 0.05) (Fig. 6B). Caspase-8, the other initiator caspase involved in death receptor-induced apoptosis, was found to remain unaffected. Among the effector caspases, caspase-7 alone was found to be involved in HlyA-mediated apoptosis. HlyA is released as an exotoxin in the bacterial milieu and therefore can be postulated to directly influence and regulate the cells of the mucosal immune system. In this work, we evaluated the monitoring skill of HlyA in dictating the fate of PerC MΦ, which could be induced to follow any one of the three pathways: that of activation, apoptosis, or anergy. The decision about which pathway is to be followed by the cell is determined by the interaction of the immunogen with the host cell. Our present study demonstrates an intriguing phenomenon, where V. cholerae HlyA induces simultaneous activation and apoptosis of MΦ (Fig. 7). TLRs, known to detect PAMPs, are crucial for activation of innate immunity as well as connection of the innate with acquired immunity. Like several PFTs that have been recognized by TLR4 (14Malley R. Henneke P. Morse S.C. Cieslewicz M.J. Lipsitch M. Thompson C.M. Kurt-Jones E. Paton J.C. Wessels M.R. Golenbock D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Mody C.H. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), HlyA up-regulated the TLR from as early as 2 h on MΦ. Surprisingly, TLR4 expression disappeared between 8–12 h of HlyA treatment accompanied with the abolishment of activation molecule CD40 and co-stimulatory molecule CD86. To evaluate the status of the cells during this hiatus, we tested the inhibitory role of TOLLIP on HlyA mediated cell activity because it imparts suppression of TLR-induced cell activation directly associated with TLR2 and TLR4 (20Bulut Y. Faure E. Thomas L. Equils O. Arditi M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 987-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 33Zhang G. Ghosh S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7059-7065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). An interesting finding of this study has been the induction of the adaptor protein TOLLIP following TLR4 that went missing when the TLRs again showed up, a mechanism developed by the cell to tackle the toxin effects even more efficiently. Thus, we show feedback regulation of TLR signaling. Although the specificities of TLR2 and TLR4 for PAMPs are absolutely unrelated, TLR2 was unexpectedly expressed from 20 h of HlyA treatment along with the reappearance of TLR4. The expression of TLR6 and TLR1, sometimes associated with TLR2, was assessed. TLR6 alone was found to be up-regulated in concurrence with TLR2. It has been shown that TLR4 up-regulation can induce the recruitment of TLR2 as a part of the signaling cascade in certain cells (31Fan J. Frey R.S. Malik A.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1234-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Because HlyA induced TLR2 at a later stage, we investigated whether it was expressed as a result of TLR4-mediated downstream signaling. Anti-TLR4 Ab treatment of MΦ prior to addition of HlyA mildly inhibited TLR2 expression compared with cells given only HlyA. When TLR2 expression was analyzed in C3H/HeJ mice, which are TLR4-insensitive, it was up-regulated by HlyA confirming that TLR2 was independent of TLR4 signaling. Thus, the data point toward MΦ reliability on both TLR4 and -2 to detect the HlyA molecule on its entirety. Next, we checked the HlyA-induced signaling downstream of TLR recognition. After ligand binding, TLRs dimerize and undergo conformational change required for the recruitment of downstream signaling molecules (11Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6751) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of the TLRs by HlyA-treated MΦ led us to study its effect on the signal transduction molecules that are activated by the receptors. Recognition of HlyA by the TLRs was expected to stimulate the recruitment of MyD88, an intracellular Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor that activates inflammatory pathways (11Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6751) Google Scholar). Because HlyA induced the sequential up-regulation of TLR4 and TLR2, it was imperative to study which MyD88-TLR association drives the downstream signaling. It was found that only the MyD88·TLR4 association had a role in MyD88-mediated downstream signaling, which was further established by the absence of MyD88·TLR2 association in C3H/HeJ mice. Moreover, inhibition of the nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB by anti-TLR4 Ab validated HlyA-induced TLR4-mediated cell activation. Expression of activation molecule CD40, co-stimulatory molecule CD86, and MHC class II (I-Ab) showed the ability of HlyA to activate MΦ. Interestingly, in the presence of TLR4, although HlyA-induced CD86 at 2 h postincubation prior to the MHC class II molecule, the co-stimulatory molecule could not be traced at later period. Preincubation of MΦ with anti-TLR4 Ab before HlyA addition revealed that CD86 expression was indeed TLR4-dependent, more so because it could not be detected on C3H/HeJ MΦ. In contrast, CD40 appeared twice, first with TLR4 at 4 h of culture and next along with TLR2, -4, and -6 at 24 h. The CD40 expression, which remained unaltered in the early stages, was substantially inhibited by anti-TLR4 Ab and strongly by anti-TLR2 mAb or both Abs together at later stages of culture. Unlike CD86, CD40 was up-regulated in C3H/HeJ, which could be strongly inhibited by anti-TLR2 mAb. These data reveal that HlyA-induced expression of CD86 and CD40 are two separate events independently regulated by TLR4 and TLR2, which together cater to MΦ activation. Because PFTs are known to cause pronounced cell damage, unaltered expression of CD40 and CD86 in presence of HlyA plus pan-caspase inhibitors shows cell activation is an event independent of apoptosis supported by the depleted presence of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL. Besides expression of the two cell link molecules CD40 and CD86 on MΦ, HlyA triggered cells to release IL-12 and TNF-α instead of IL-10, thus pointing toward HlyA-induced M1 polarization. Interestingly, unlike expression of the activation molecules where both TLR2 and TLR4 had important roles to play, preincubation with anti-TLR2 or anti-TLR4 Ab showed that both IL-12 and TNF-α release was solely dependent on TLR4. Inability of HlyA to induce the release of the two cytokines by MΦ of C3H/HeJ mice conclusively shows that cytokine activity is TLR4-dependent. The full-length 65-kDa monomeric HlyA can undergo proteolytic deletion giving rise to the 50-kDa truncated protein (VCC50) without the β-prism lectin domain. Thus, up-regulation of only TLR2 by VCC50 from early hours of culture, otherwise detected at later hours with the full-length HlyA, unequivocally demonstrates TLR2 expression is under the purview of the cytolytic protein domain, supported by VCC50-induced up-regulation of the TLR on C3H/HeJ MΦ. Induction of CD86 and CD40 by VCC50 on the cells of both C3H/HeJ and C57BL/6 mice shows the direct role of the domain in cell activation and likely parallels the reappearance of CD40 at later stages in the presence of TLR2 and -6 when cells are cultured with full-length HlyA. In contrast, the plant lectin jacalin, which is homologous to the β-prism lectin domain of HlyA induced TLR4 on MΦ of C57BL/6 mice within 2 h of culture. The inability of jacalin to express TLR4 on MΦ of C3H/HeJ mice shows the lectin to be a definite TLR4 inducer and strongly suggests TLR4 up-regulation is the property linked to HlyA β-prism lectin domain when the cells are cultured with full-length monomer. Thus, our work shows MΦ take a prudent approach to thwart HlyA of V. cholerae by harnessing TLRs that not only recognize the dissimilar domains of HlyA but precisely signal in tandem for the cells to respond. Interestingly, this work demonstrates that apart from getting activated, MΦ were driven to simultaneous apoptosis by HlyA. The PFT-induced caspase-9- and caspase-7-mediated apoptosis of ∼88% of the treated MΦ in as early as 3 h of culture, showing the involvement of the mitochondrial or intrinsic pathway of cell death. These data fall in line with an earlier finding of our laboratory where 90% of the B-1a cells underwent apoptosis (27Mukherjee G. Biswas A. Banerjee K.K. Biswas T. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Signaling through TLRs, besides activating gene expression employing NF-κB, can trigger an apoptotic response in eukaryotic cells as evidenced by TLR4-dependent apoptosis by pneumolysin (34Srivastava A. Henneke P. Visintin A. Morse S.C. Martin V. Watkins C. Paton J.C. Wessels M.R. Golenbock D.T. Malley R. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 6479-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Preincubation of MΦ with anti-TLR4 Ab could not block apoptosis. In C3H/HeJ mice, the percentage of apoptotic MΦ remained similar to that of C57BL/6, confirming apoptosis as a TLR4-independent event. Moreover, TLR involvement in apoptosis requires blocking of NF-κB activation (35Zhang Y. Bliska J.B. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 1513-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although blocking of NF-κB by anti-TLR4 Ab showed HlyA-induced TLR4-dependent expression of NF-κB (Fig. 2C), it failed to prevent apoptosis (Fig. 6A). These observations emphasized that HlyA-mediated apoptosis is TLR-independent. Apoptosis can be initiated through two pathways: the extrinsic pathway and the intrinsic pathway. The extrinsic pathway involves an extracellular receptor belonging to the TNF receptor family, which carries a death domain. The signal transduction initiated by this death domain ultimately culminates in the activation of caspase-8. The TLR-mediated apoptosis takes place through this extrinsic pathway. HlyA is not only unable to up-regulate caspase-8 but also does not involve TLRs in its apoptogenic activity. It recruits caspase-9 as the executor of the apoptotic process. Thus, it can be said that HlyA-mediated cell death takes place through the mitochondrial or intrinsic pathway. Immunoblot analysis of caspase-6 and caspase-7 shows overexpression of caspase-7 in HlyA-treated MΦ. This refers to apoptosis, which is initiated by caspase-9 and terminates through caspase-7, leaving caspase-3 unaffected; therefore, a caspase-3-independent, caspase-7-mediated cellular apoptosis is observed (36Slee E.A. Adrain C. Martin S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7320-7326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). This work sheds new light on how MΦ undergoing HlyA-induced apoptosis, a phenomenon carried out by most PFTs, tackle in parallel the situation for survival by selecting a panel of varying TLRs responsible toward two major PAMPs: a carbohydrate binding β-prism lectin with affinity for TLR4 and a cytolytic protein that engages TLR2 and -6. The promiscuous TLR association of MΦ is maneuvered by TOLLIP for continuity of cell activation with display of surface molecules and cytokines. In conclusion, the current study identifies the mechanism by which a single molecule/ligand stimulates multiple TLRs to turn some cells toward activation while handing out death to the rest."
https://openalex.org/W1973102424,"Laminin α2 (LAMA2)-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy is a severe, early-onset disease caused by abnormal levels of laminin 211 in the basal lamina leading to muscle weakness, transient inflammation, muscle degeneration and impaired mobility. In a Lama2-deficient mouse model for this disease, animal survival is improved by muscle-specific expression of the apoptosis inhibitor Bcl-2, conferred by a MyoD-hBcl-2 transgene. Here we investigated early disease stages in this model to determine initial pathological events and effects of Bcl-2 on their progression. Using quantitative immunohistological and mRNA analyses we show that inflammation occurs very early in Lama2-deficient muscle, some aspects of which are reduced or delayed by the MyoD-hBcl-2 transgene. mRNAs for innate immune response regulators, including multiple Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the inflammasome component NLRP3, are elevated in diseased muscle compared with age-matched controls expressing Lama2. MyoD-hBcl-2 inhibits induction of TLR4, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 in Lama2-deficient muscle compared with non-transgenic controls, and leads to reduced infiltration of eosinophils, which are key death effector cells. This congenital disease model provides a new paradigm for investigating cell death mechanisms during early stages of pathogenesis, demonstrating that interactions exist between Bcl-2, a multifunctional regulator of cell survival, and the innate immune response."
https://openalex.org/W1977678771,"Autoproteolytic cleavage of the inactive acid ceramidase (AC) precursor into the active heterodimer exposes a free cysteine residue, leading us to study whether AC could be regulated by one or more members of the cystatin family. Co-expression of the full-length AC and cystatin SA (cysSA) cDNAs led to significant reduction of AC activity in the transfected cells. Expression of cysSA also inhibited endogenous AC activity in cells and increased ceramide. Conversely, cysSA siRNA expression led to elevated AC activity and reduction in ceramide. The effects of cysSA siRNA expression could be reversed by the addition of recombinant cysSA into the culture media. These results were consistent with detection of a physical interaction between AC and cysSA, assessed by co-immunoprecipitation and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography, and further supported by co-localization of the endogenous proteins using confocal microscopy. In vitro kinetic analysis of purified, recombinant AC and cysSA confirmed the transfection results and suggested a non-competitive type of inhibition with a K(i) in the low micromolar range. Processing of the AC precursor into the active form was not affected by cysSA expression, suggesting that it likely inhibits AC by allosteric interference. Computer modeling and expression studies identified several potential inhibitory domains in cysSA, including a small ""AC-like"" domain (identical to the AC cleavage site, TICT). Small peptides, synthesized with combinations of this and a ""cystatin-like"" domain (QXVXG), exhibited significant AC inhibition as well. Such peptide-based AC inhibitors could potentially be used to regulate AC activity in cancer cells that are known to overexpress this enzyme alone and in combination with conventional anti-cancer drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2073887312,"Acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) thioesterases play a crucial role in the metabolism of activated fatty acids, coenzyme A, and other metabolic precursor molecules including arachidonic acid and palmitic acid. These enzymes hydrolyze coenzyme A from acyl-CoA esters to mediate a range of cellular functions including β-oxidation, lipid biosynthesis, and signal transduction. Here, we present the crystal structure of a hexameric hot-dog domain-containing acyl-CoA thioesterase from Bacillus halodurans in the apo-form and provide structural and comparative analyses to the coenzyme A-bound form to identify key conformational changes induced upon ligand binding. We observed dramatic ligand-induced changes at both the hot-dog dimer and the trimer-of-dimer interfaces; the dimer interfaces in the apo-structure differ by over 20% and decrease to about half the size in the ligand-bound state. We also assessed the specificity of the enzyme against a range of fatty acyl-CoA substrates and have identified a preference for short-chain fatty acyl-CoAs. Coenzyme A was shown both to negatively regulate enzyme activity, representing a direct inhibitory feedback, and consistent with the structural data, to destabilize the quaternary structure of the enzyme. Coenzyme A-induced conformational changes in the C-terminal helices of enzyme were assessed through mutational analysis and shown to play a role in regulating enzyme activity. The conformational changes are likely to be conserved from bacteria through to humans and provide a greater understanding, particularly at a structural level, of thioesterase function and regulation."
