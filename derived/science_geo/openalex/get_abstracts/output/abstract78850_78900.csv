https://openalex.org/W1975432780,"MUCH of the energy for long distance flight in locusts is derived by oxidation of lipids1, and the lipid is transported from the fat body (the principal site of lipid storage) to flight muscle through the haemolymph. During flight the lipid content of the haemolymph of Locusta migratoria increases to four times the resting value2 and this is accounted for by an increase in the glyceride fraction. Chino and Gilbert3 found that diglyceride is released from fat body during in vitro incubations with haemolymph, and suggested that diglyceride is important in lipid transport in the several insect species they studied. In mammals lipids are transported chiefly in the form of lipoproteins, and this is also so in a number of insect species3–5. We have therefore examined the nature of the increase in glyceride which occurs during locust flight, and have attempted to relate this to changes in haemolymph lipoproteins."

Evidence now suggests that ACh is a transmitter in the cerebral cortex, arid several investigators have shown that this substance is continuously released from the cerebral cortex in amounts which can be directly related to the level of cortical activity7–12. This communication describes how changes in local Ca2+ affect the spontaneous and evoked release of ACh from the cat cerebral cortex."

https://openalex.org/W1977120748,"NINE species of coccidia are known to parasitize the domestic fowl. During the past 25 years a succession of drugs has made it possible to control coccidiosis to an increasing degree, but until recently no drug was known which would effectively suppress all species. Wide-spectrum prophylaxis has been most successfully accomplished by the use of mixtures such as amprolium + ethopabate + sulphaquinoxaline. We now report the discovery that methyl 7-benzyloxy-6-n-butyl-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylate (I; R1 = CH3, R2 = n C4H9, R3 = C6H5·CH2·O) has prophylactic activity against all six important species of coccidia and is more than ten times as active as any available alternative coccidiostat."

https://openalex.org/W2038981405,"THE existence of a maintained summating potential (SP) seen in the avian1 and mammalian2 cochleas during strong tonal stimulation is a well established phenomenon and can be explained in terms of non-linear movements of the cochlear transducer mechanism3. Transients are seen at the onset and termination of such stimuli and can be studied with the aid of averaging techniques4. These transients are also asymmetric, their mean values being represented as deflexions of the SP which are of the same polarity (negative-going) both at the onset and cessation of the tone burst. This is, of course, the result to be expected if the asymmetry of the transducer mechanism were such as to produce a negative SP."

https://openalex.org/W2084450167,"TRANSPORT processes in the small intestine are dependent on energy which suggests the participation, directly or indirectly, of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). No evidence has, however, been produced that exogenous ATP can influence intestinal transport processes, which may well result from the difficulty of getting the unstable ATP molecule to the correct place in the cellular organization before its hydrolysis occurs. A way around this difficulty is offered by the study of electrical potentials in the intestine, which are known to be associated with intestinal transfer of various substances. Potential changes can be measured within a few minutes of setting up the intestinal preparation, and appear within seconds after addition of transferable substances. They therefore appear to offer an ideal method for studying the effect of ATP on intestinal transfer."
https://openalex.org/W1982205595,"IN 1966 I published1 results showing that the normal concentration of fluoride in human serum is about one-tenth the generally accepted value—that of Singer and Armstrong. Part of the evidence supporting my results was the “at least five-fold discrepancy” that could be shown in their data2 which is most easily explained by an error in the measurement of the serum fluoride. The discrepancy involves the ratio of urine to plasma fluoride concentrations when determined by fluorine-18 as compared with stable fluoride analyses. Because the concentration of fluoride in urine is well established in contrast to that in serum where analysis is much more difficult, it is reasonable to question the latter when there is a discrepancy. Singer and Armstrong3, however, in their recent rebuttal, think that I came to erroneous conclusions because I .directed attention to only two of their analyses, which they now consider aberrant."

https://openalex.org/W2002844136,Stephen and Waterlow1 have described the use of carbon-14-labelled arginine to measure the catabolic rate of serum and liver proteins in normal rats and rats fed on a diet deficient in protein. Differential assay of the isotope activity in the C(1) and C(6) atoms of arginine shows a variation in values between the true and apparent half lives of the proteins. The technique is of value for studying the recycling of amino-acids and for measuring catabolic rates. The authors have made the observations that the decrease in protein catabolic rate and the increased recycling of amino-acids which occur in the rats fed a diet free of protein may constitute an adaptive phenomenon for the conservation of protein in the deficient animal.
