https://openalex.org/W2002218600,"Double-slit electron interferometers fabricated in high mobility two-dimensional electron gases are powerful tools for studying coherent wave-like phenomena in mesoscopic systems. However, they suffer from low visibility of the interference patterns due to the many channels present in each slit, and from poor sensitivity to small currents due to their open geometry. Moreover, these interferometers do not function in high magnetic fields--such as those required to enter the quantum Hall effect regime--as the field destroys the symmetry between left and right slits. Here we report the fabrication and operation of a single-channel, two-path electron interferometer that functions in a high magnetic field. This device is the first electronic analogue of the optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and opens the way to measuring interference of quasiparticles with fractional charges. On the basis of measurements of single edge state and closed geometry transport in the quantum Hall effect regime, we find that the interferometer is highly sensitive and exhibits very high visibility (62%). However, the interference pattern decays precipitously with increasing electron temperature or energy. Although the origin of this dephasing is unclear, we show, via shot-noise measurements, that it is not a decoherence process that results from inelastic scattering events."

Intense selection from the host immune system drives antigenic change in influenza A and B, resulting in continuous replacement of circulating strains with new variants able to re-infect hosts immune to earlier types. This 'antigenic drift' often requires a new vaccine to be formulated before each annual epidemic. However, given the high transmissibility and mutation rate of influenza, the constancy of genetic diversity within lineages over time is paradoxical. Another enigma is the replacement of existing strains during a global pandemic caused by 'antigenic shift'--the introduction of a new avian influenza A subtype into the human population. Here we explore ecological and immunological factors underlying these patterns using a mathematical model capturing both realistic epidemiological dynamics and viral evolution at the sequence level. By matching model output to phylogenetic patterns seen in sequence data collected through global surveillance, we find that short-lived strain-transcending immunity is essential to restrict viral diversity in the host population and thus to explain key aspects of drift and shift dynamics."

Crystal structures are available only for the detergent-solubilized light receptor rhodopsin. In addition, this receptor is the only GPCR for which the presumed higher order oligomeric state in native membranes has been demonstrated (Fotiadis, D., Liang, Y., Filipek, S., Saperstein, D. A., Engel, A., and Palczewski, K. (2003) Nature 421, 127–128). Here, we have determined by atomic force microscopy the organization of rhodopsin in native membranes obtained from wild-type mouse photoreceptors and opsin isolated from photoreceptors of Rpe65–/– mutant mice, which do not produce the chromophore 11-cis-retinal. The higher order organization of rhodopsin was present irrespective of the support on which the membranes were adsorbed for imaging. Rhodopsin and opsin form structural dimers that are organized in paracrystalline arrays. The intradimeric contact is likely to involve helices IV and V, whereas contacts mainly between helices I and II and the cytoplasmic loop connecting helices V and VI facilitate the formation of rhodopsin dimer rows. Contacts between rows are on the extracellular side and involve helix I. This is the first semi-empirical model of a higher order structure of a GPCR in native membranes, and it has profound implications for the understanding of how this receptor interacts with partner proteins.

Vision is essential for the survival of many organisms ranging from unicellular dinoflagellates to man (1Gehring W.J. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 46: 65-73PubMed Google Scholar). Rhodopsin, the primary molecule in the visual signaling cascade, is activated by a single photon and induces subunit dissociation of transducin (Gt) 1The abbreviations used are: Gt, transducin (rod photoreceptor G-protein); AFM, atomic force microscope/microscopy; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; ROS, rod outer segment(s); EM, electron microscopy; RPE cells, retinal pigment epithelial cells. molecules, the cognate G proteins, amplifying the light signal (2Stryer L. Biopolymers. 1985; 24: 29-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin is also a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and a member of subfamily A, which comprises ∼90% of all GPCRs (3Ballesteros J. Palczewski K. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Dev. 2001; 4: 561-574PubMed Google Scholar). GPCRs are essential proteins in signal transduction across cellular membranes (4Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar). The first crystal structure of a GPCR, rhodopsin, has been determined (5Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar), and two refined models have subsequently been reported (6Teller D.C. Okada T. Behnke C.A. Palczewski K. Stenkamp R.E.

A. 2002; 99: 5982-5987Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). In vertebrate retinal photoreceptors, rod outer segment (ROS) disk membranes are tightly stacked (8Molday R.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 2491-2513PubMed Google Scholar). The stacking of these internal cellular membrane structures ensures a dense packing of light-absorbing rhodopsins, which constitute >90% of all disk membrane proteins, and in turn, a high probability of single photon absorption (9Baylor D.A. Lamb T.D. Yau K.W. J. Physiol. 1979; 288: 613-634PubMed Google Scholar). In ROS disk membranes, rhodopsin occupies ∼50% of the space within the disks (8Molday R.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 2491-2513PubMed Google Scholar). Knockout mice lacking rhodopsin do not develop ROS, which indicates a structural role for this protein (10Lem J. Krasnoperova N.V. Calvert P.D.

The organization of rhodopsin and other GPCRs in their native membranes is of paramount importance because the physiological properties of these receptors may depend on their oligomeric state (reviewed in Refs. 4Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar and 12George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. Lee S.P. Nat. Rev.

In native disk membranes, the existence of distinct, densely packed rows of rhodopsin dimers has been demonstrated by AFM (15Fotiadis D. Liang Y. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K. Nature. 2003; 421: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). To obtain further insight into the native molecular organization of GPCRs, we have used AFM to visualize the organization of rhodopsin and opsin in their native membranes. Finally, we produced a model of rhodopsin oligomers that accounts for all geometrical constraints imposed by AFM and crystallographic data. This model shows, for the first time, the higher order organization of a GPCR in its native environment. The contact sites identified in the model, which are responsible for the oligomerization of rhodopsin, are likely to be crucial for the self-assembly of other GPCRs (4Pierce K.L. Premont R.T.

Isolation of ROS and Disk Membranes—All animal experiments employed procedures approved by the University of Washington Animal Care Committee. Rpe65-deficient mice and wild-type C57BL/6 mice were obtained from M. Redmond (National Eye Institute) (16Redmond T.M. Yu S. Lee E. Bok D. Hamasaki D. Chen N. Goletz P. Ma J.X. Crouch R.K. Pfeifer K. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar) and The Jackson Laboratory, respectively. All animals (4–8 weeks old) were maintained in complete darkness for >120 min before they were sacrificed. The eyes were removed and the retinas isolated in complete darkness with the aid of night vision goggles (Lambda 9, ITT Industries). Twelve mouse retinas were placed in a tube with 120 μl of 8% OptiPrep (Nycomed, Oslo, Norway) in Ringer's buffer (130 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm KCl, 2.4 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm CaCl2,10mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 0.02 mm EDTA) and vortexed for 1 min. The samples were centrifuged at 200 × g for 1 min, and the supernatant containing the ROS was removed gently. The pellet was dissolved in 120 μl of 8% OptiPrep, vortexed, and centrifuged again. The vortexing and sedimentation sequence was repeated six times. The collected ROS supernatants (∼1.5 ml) were combined, overlaid on a 10–30% continuous gradient of OptiPrep in Ringer's buffer, and centrifuged for 50 min at 26,500 × g. ROS were harvested as a second band (about two-thirds of the way from the top), diluted three times with Ringer's buffer, and centrifuged for 3 min at 500 × g to remove the cell nuclei. The supernatant containing ROS was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged for 30 min at 26,500 × g. The pelleted material contained pure, osmotically intact ROS. ROS were burst in 2 ml of 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 0 °C for 15 h. Disks were overlaid on a 15–40% continuous gradient of OptiPrep in Ringer's buffer. The sample was centrifuged for 50 min at 26,500 × g, and the disks were collected from a faint band located about two-thirds of the way from the top of the gradient. The harvested intact disks were then diluted three times with Ringer's solution and pelleted for 30 min at 26,500 × g. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (17Ohguro H. Chiba S. Igarashi Y. Matsumoto H. Akino T. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3241-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation and Reduction Reactions—Phosphorylation of rhodopsin and reduction of all-trans-retinal were carried out as described previously (18Palczewski K. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14067-14073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The indicated samples were sonicated for 30 s in a Bransonic 220 sonicator (Fisher). Atomic Force Microscopy—Washed disk membranes were adsorbed to mica in 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 15–20 min and washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2 (recording buffer). AFM experiments were performed using a Nanoscope Multimode microscope (Digital Instruments) equipped with an infrared laser head, a fluid cell, and oxide-sharpened silicon nitride cantilevers (OMCL-TR400PSA, Olympus), calibrated as described previously (19Müller D.J. Engel A. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1633-1644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Topographs were acquired in contact mode at minimal loading forces (≤100 piconewtons). Trace and retrace signals were recorded simultaneously at line frequencies ranging between 4.1 and 5.1 Hz. The power spectrum displayed in the inset in Fig. 4a was calculated with the SEMPER image processing system (20Saxton W.O. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Scanning EM—The retinas without retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, 2% sucrose, pH 7.4, for 6 h. Fixed disks were allowed to settle on the coated (1% poly-l-lysine-coated) coverslip and washed with water. All samples were washed in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, 2% sucrose, fixed with 1% OsO4 in washing buffer, dehydrated with ethanol, dried using a critical point drying method, sputter-coated with a 5–10-nm thick gold layer, and analyzed employing a JSF-6300F or an XL SFEG scanning electron microscope (FEI Sirion, Philips). Light and Transmission EM—ROS and disks were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 1% OsO4, 0.13 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, for 1 h, washed three times using EM rinsing buffer (0.13 m NaH2PO4, 0.05% MgCl2, pH 7.4) and collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 3 min. ROS and disk pellets were suspended in molten 5% phosphate-buffered low-temperature gelling agarose solution, collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 3 min, and cooled. The ROS and disk pellets were secondarily fixed with 1% OsO4 in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, dehydrated with ethanol, and embedded in Eponate12 resin (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA). Thin sections (1.0 μm) were cut, stained with 10% Richardson's blue solution, and subjected to light microscopy. Ultrathin sections (0.07 μm) were cut and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate solution. Samples were recorded with a Philips CM-10 EM. Electron Microscopy of Immunogold-labeled and Negatively Stained Disk Membranes—Isolated disks were adsorbed to carbon support films mounted on electron microscopy grids, blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and incubated for 1.5 h with 1D4 (C-terminal specificity, R. Molday) (21MacKenzie D. Arendt A. Hargrave P. McDowell J.H. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6544-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), 4D2 (N-terminal specificity, R. Molday) (22Laird D.W. Molday R.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1988; 29: 419-428PubMed Google Scholar), C7 (C-terminal specificity, K. Palczewski), or B6-30N (N-terminal specificity, P. Hargrave) (23Adamus G. Zam Z.S. Arendt A. Palczewski K. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A. Vision Res. 1991; 31: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) anti-rhodopsin antibody at dilutions of 1:10, 1:10, 1:1000, and 1:10, respectively. A secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with 15 nm gold, was used at a dilution of 1:100. Antibody-labeled and unlabeled disk membranes were stained with Nano-W negative stain (Nanoprobes, Stony Brook, NY) or 0.75% uranyl acetate, respectively. Electron micrographs were recorded with a Philips CM-10 or a Hitachi H-7000 electron microscope. The power spectra displayed in Fig. 5 were calculated with the SEMPER image processing system (20Saxton W.O. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Modeling—A monomer of the rhodopsin crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1HZH) (6Teller D.C. Okada T. Behnke C.A. Palczewski K. Stenkamp R.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7761-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) was used to build an oligomeric model of rhodopsin in the lipid membrane. The loops not present in the rhodopsin crystal structure were created using the Modeler module (24Sali A. Potterton L. Yuan F. van Vlijmen H. Karplus M. Proteins. 1995; 23: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar) of Insight II (Insight II, version 2000, Accelrys, San Diego). Verification of the created loops and of the whole structure was accomplished with the Profile-3D module (25Bowie J.U. Luthy R. Eisenberg D. Science. 1991; 253: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (2443) Google Scholar) by evaluating the compatibility between sequence and structure. The MOLMOL program was used to analyze the modeled macromolecular structures (26Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (:29–32): 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). This theoretical model of the native rhodopsin organization was deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the accession number 1N3M. Isolation and Characterization of ROS and Disk Membranes—ROS were isolated from mouse retinae. As demonstrated by transmission EM, scanning electron, and light microscopy, the protocol employed yielded highly enriched and structurally preserved ROS with a diameter of 0.85–1.4 μm and a length of 6–10 μm (Fig. 1). Thus, the diameters of ROS still attached to the retina (Fig. 1a) and isolated ROS (Fig. 1, b–d) were comparable, suggesting structural integrity. Moreover, to check the quality of our preparations, we employed UV-visible spectroscopy and enzymatic assays of rhodopsin phosphorylation using intracellular endogenous rhodopsin kinase (18Palczewski K. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14067-14073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and reduction of the photoisomerized chromophore of rhodopsin (27Palczewski K. Jager S. Buczylko J. Crouch R.K. Bredberg D.L. Hofmann K.P. Asson-Batres M.A. Saari J.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13741-13750Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), all-trans-retinal, using membrane impermeable [γ-32P]ATP and [C4-3H]NADPH, respectively (Fig. 1e). The phosphorylation level was low (8.40 pmol) in untreated samples. Samples that were irradiated by light and subsequently sonicated expressed low quantities of phosphorylated rhodopsin as well. In contrast, the phosphorylation was the highest (49.40 pmol) in samples that were sonicated during light irradiation. The amount of [3H]retinol was lowest in untreated samples and remained low in samples that were sonicated after light irradiation. In samples sonicated under light irradiation, the quantity of [3H]retinol was the highest (Fig. 1e). Thus, the results indicated that the isolated ROS were osmotically intact and that the rhodopsin molecules were fully active. Disks isolated after osmotic bursting of the ROS and prepared by thin sectioning appeared as vesicles in the EM, compatible with the high osmotic pressure expected to inflate the structurally preserved disks (Fig. 1f). Immunogold labeling of disks was performed using antibodies directed against the N-terminal (4D2 antibody) and C-terminal (1D4 antibody) ends of rhodopsin. More than 90% of the disks bound the C-terminal anti-rhodopsin antibody throughout the disk surface (Fig. 1g, arrows). Less than 10% were labeled around their rim (Fig. 1g, inset 1), suggesting that disrupted disks expose their extracellular surface. In agreement, about 10% of the disks were labeled when using the antibody directed against the rhodopsin N terminus (Fig. 1g, inset 2). Taken together, the antibody labeling experiments strongly support the structural preservation of the disk membranes during their isolation. SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1h) revealed that the disk preparation did not contain significant amounts of soluble proteins normally present in ROS and was enriched in rhodopsin (>95%). The latter finding was identified by immunoblotting using the 4D2 and C7 antibodies (data not shown). AFM Imaging of Rhodopsin in Native Disk Membranes—To unveil the native supramolecular arrangement of rhodopsin, isolated disk membranes were adsorbed to freshly cleaved mica and imaged by AFM in buffer solution. The AFM was equipped with an infrared laser to avoid the formation of opsin, the retinal-depleted form of rhodopsin (28McBee J.K. Palczewski K. Baehr W. Pepperberg D.R. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2001; 20: 469-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The morphology of an intact native disk adsorbed to mica is revealed in Fig. 2. Three different surface types are evident: the cytoplasmic side of the disk (type 1), co-isolated lipid (type 2), and mica (type 3). Bare lipid bilayers had a thickness of 3.7 ± 0.2 nm (n = 86) and an unstructured topography (Fig. 2, type 2). Compared with the topography of the lipid, the cytoplasmic surface (type 1) of the disk was highly corrugated, indicating the presence of densely packed proteins (see deflection image in Fig. 2b). Well adsorbed, single- and double-layered disk membranes had a thickness of 7–8 nm and 16–17 nm, respectively, a circular shape, and diameters between 0.9 and 1.5 μm. These disk diameters, determined by AFM, are in excellent agreement with those obtained from ROS by scanning electron microscopy (Fig. 1, a and c) and light and electron microscopy (Fig. 1, b–d). Open, spread-flattened disks adsorbed as round-shaped single-layered membranes to mica and exhibited four different surface types (Fig. 3). The first surface type (Fig. 3a, type 1) was characterized by a highly textured topography consisting of densely packed double rows of protrusions forming paracrystals (Fig. 3b). SDS-PAGE revealed that rhodopsin was present at a high concentration in such disk membrane preparations (Fig. 1h), suggesting that the visualized densely packed rows and paracrystals are related to this major protein. The second and third surface types were the same as in Fig. 2, i.e. lipid and mica. The fourth surface type (Fig. 3a, type 4, and Fig. 3c) had the same morphology as the first except that the paracrystals formed rafts of rhodopsin separated by lipid. At higher magnification, rhodopsin dimers from densely packed regions (Fig. 3b, broken ellipses) or raft-like cluster (Fig. 3c, broken ellipses) to break off the rows were seen, identifying them as the building blocks of the paracrystals. Occasionally, single rhodopsin monomers (Fig. 3b, arrowhead) were detected on such topographs. The packing density in surface type 1 areas ranged between 30,000 and 55,000 rhodopsin monomers/μm2 (15Fotiadis D. Liang Y. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K. Nature. 2003; 421: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), similar to the packing density within the rhodopsin islands in surface type 4 areas (in Fig. 3c the packing density is about 34,000 rhodopsin monomers/μm2). Obviously, the overall packing density of rhodopsin measured by AFM on tightly packed regions (Fig. 3b) or within rhodopsin rafts (Fig. 3c) is higher than that measured by optical methods (29Liebman P.A. Entine G. Science. 1974; 185: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).Fig. 3Topography of an open, spread-flattened disk adsorbed to mica and imaged in buffer solution.a, height image of the open, spread-flattened disk. Four different surface types are evident: the cytoplasmic surface of the disk (types 1 and 4), lipid (type 2), and mica (type 3). The topographies of regions 1 (b) and 4 (c) at higher magnification reveal densely packed rows of rhodopsin dimers. Besides paracrystals, single rhodopsin dimers (broken ellipses) and occasional rhodopsin monomers (arrowhead) are discerned floating in the lipid bilayer. Scale bars: 250 nm (a) and 15 nm (b and c).

Palczewski K. Baehr W. Pepperberg D.R. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2001; 20: 469-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In Rpe65–/– mice, retinoid analyses revealed no detectable 11-cis-products in any of the ester, aldehyde, or alcohol forms (16Redmond T.M. Yu S. Lee E. Bok D. Hamasaki D. Chen N. Goletz P. Ma J.X. Crouch R.K. Pfeifer K. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Although these mice are able to develop ROS, the ROS contain opsin instead of rhodopsin. We used preparations of disks from Rpe65–/– mice to compare the structure and the native supramolecular arrangement of opsin with that of rhodopsin. In general, the morphology of the Rpe65–/– disk membranes was similar to that of the wild-type membranes (see Fig. 3), but occasionally, even better ordered paracrystals could be found in Rpe65–/– preparations (Fig. 4a). From such areas, power spectra (Fig. 4a, inset) were calculated and the unit cell parameters determined (a = 8.4 ± 0.3 nm, b = 3.8 ± 0.2 nm, γ = 85 ± 2° (n = 9)), these values being the same as those found for wild-type paracrystals (15Fotiadis D. Liang Y. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K. Nature. 2003; 421: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). At higher magnification, rows of opsin dimers forming the paracrystal (Fig. 4b, broken ellipse) were visualized, indicating the same oligomeric state as rhodopsin in its native environment (compare Fig. 4b with Fig. 3, b and c, and with Ref. 15Fotiadis D.

Occasionally, single-opsin monomers (Fig. 4b, arrowheads) were seen in such topographs. As with rhodopsin (15Fotiadis D. Liang Y. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K. Nature. 2003; 421: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), opsin protruded by 1.4 ± 0.2 nm (n = 32) out of the lipid moiety on the cytoplasmic surface. On the extracellular surface, no opsin paracrystals were evident (Fig. 4c). The surface was corrugated, irregular, and flexible, preventing the acquisition of highly resolved AFM topographs such as required to reveal the paracrystalline packing. Opsin clusters (Fig. 4c, triangle) protruded 2.8 ± 0.2 nm (n = 60) out of the lipid bilayer (Fig. 4c, asterisk) on the extracellular side, which is twice the height of the cytoplasmic protrusions. The latter finding is also in line with the atomic structure of rhodopsin determined by x-ray crystallography (6Teller D.C. Okada T. Behnke C.A. Palczewski K. Stenkamp R.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7761-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Irregular and flexible surfaces are typical for glycosylated proteins and proteins with long, flexible termini or loops. This observation, along with the fact that opsin has a long N terminus and is glycosylated on the extracellular surface, strengthens the assignment of this surface as the extracellular side of disk membranes. Similar difficulties were encountered with the glycosylated aquaporin-1 and the His-tagged AqpZ proteins where oligosaccharides or long termini impeded the acquisition of highly resolved surface topographs by AFM (30Scheuring S. Ringler P. Borgnia M. Stahlberg H. Muller D.J. Agre P. Engel A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4981-4987Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 31Walz T. Tittmann P. Fuchs K.H. Muller D.J. Smith B.L. Agre P. Gross H. Engel A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 907-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Similar observations were also made for the membranes containing rhodopsin instead of opsin (data not shown). EM of Native Disk Membranes—To exclude the possibility of rhodopsin paracrystal formation upon adsorption on mica, native disk membranes were adsorbed on carbon-coated electron microscopy grids, negatively stained, and investigated by EM (Fig. 5). Power spectra were calculated from different regions of the adsorbed disks. Both the power spectra from a circular region adsorbed directly to the carbon film (Fig. 5, left PS) and from another region lying on disk membranes (Fig. 5, right PS) indicated diffraction patterns documenting the crystallinity of the disks irrespective of the support. Higher Order Organization of Rhodopsin in Native Membranes—The topographic information from AFM suggests a different packing arrangement of native rhodopsin dimers than of dimers observed in the three-dimensional crystal (5Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar). The thickness of single-layered disk membranes, 7.8 nm (15Fotiadis D. Liang Y. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K. Nature. 2003; 421: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), is compatible with the long axis, 7.5 nm, of the rhodopsin envelope derived from the 2.8-Å x-ray structure (6Teller D.C. Okada T. Behnke C.A. Palczewski K. Stenkamp R.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7761-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). This indicates that all rhodopsin molecules are integrated with their long axes perpendicular to the bilayer. The extracellular protrusion measured by AFM, 2.8 nm, is compatible with that estimated from the x-ray structure, 2.7 nm. However, the measured cytoplasmic protrusions of rhodopsin and of opsin, 1.4 nm, are significantly smaller than the 1.8 nm estimated from the atomic model. Unit cell dimensions (a = 8.4 nm, b = 3.8 nm, γ = 85°) of native rhodopsin and opsin paracrystals impose stringent boundary conditions for the packing arrangement of the rhodopsin/opsin dimers. The corresponding surface area (31.8 nm2) barely suffices to house two rhodopsin molecules whose cross-section fits in a rectangle of 4.8 × 3.7 nm2 (6Teller D.C. Okada T. Behnke C.A. Palczewski K. Stenkamp R.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7761-7772Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Thus, a small number of packing models emerged that were thoroughly tested for steric clashes and natures of contacts. The best model revealing the different intra- and interdimeric contacts is shown in Fig. 6a. The largest area of contact is 578 Å2 and intuitively represents the strongest interaction between rhodopsin molecules. It is found between helices IV and V, indicating this as the intradimeric contact (Fig. 6a, contact 1). Contacts involving helices I and II and the cytoplasmic loop between helices V and VI exhibit an area of 333 Å2 (Fig. 6a, contact 2) and represent the intra-row contacts. Finally, rows are weakly held together by interactions between regions of helix I close to the extracellular surface (Fig. 6a, contact 3) with a contact area of 146 Å2. Interactions within the Rho1–Rho2 dimer structure are located on both the cytoplasmic and the extracellular side. In the cytoplasmic part, hydr"

Here we show that γH2AX formation is also a cellular response to topoisomerase I cleavage complexes known to induce DNA double-strand breaks during replication. In HCT116 human carcinoma cells exposed to the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin, the resulting γH2AX formation can be prevented with the phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase-related kinase inhibitor wortmannin; however, in contrast to ionizing radiation, only camptothecin-induced γH2AX formation can be prevented with the DNA replication inhibitor aphidicolin and enhanced with the checkpoint abrogator 7-hydroxystaurosporine. This γH2AX formation is suppressed in ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related) deficient cells and markedly decreased in DNA-dependent protein kinase-deficient cells but is not abrogated in ataxia telangiectasia cells, indicating that ATR and DNA-dependent protein kinase are the kinases primarily involved in γH2AX formation at the sites of replication-mediated DNA double-strand breaks. Mre11- and Nbs1-deficient cells are still able to form γH2AX. However, H2AX-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts exposed to camptothecin fail to form Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1 foci and are hypersensitive to camptothecin. These results demonstrate a conserved γH2AX response for double-strand breaks induced by replication fork collision. γH2AX foci are required for recruiting repair and checkpoint protein complexes to the replication break sites.

Compact chromatin can be a structural barrier for DNA processing during replication, transcription, recombination, and DNA repair. Following DNA damage, chromatin must be modified to permit the access of repair proteins to the DNA lesions (1Smerdon M.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3516-3525Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining are the main repair pathways for DNA double-strand breaks (2van Gent D.C. Hoeijmakers J.H. Kanaar R. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Both processes are assumed to require chromatin alterations for DNA end processing, strand invasion, branch migration, DNA synthesis, and ligation as well as for recruiting checkpoint proteins (3Green C.M. Almouzni G. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The fundamental unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which consists of an octamer of the four core histones, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, around which the DNA is bound. Histone H2A includes three subfamilies whose members contain characteristic sequence elements that have been conserved independently throughout eukaryotic evolution: H2A1-H2A2, H2AZ, and H2AX (4Pehrson J.R.

In mammals, H2AX represents 2–25% total H2A, whereas in yeast, the major H2A is the H2AX ortholog (7Redon C. Pilch D. Rogakou E. Sedelnikova O. Newrock K. Bonner W. Curr. Opin. Genet.

H2AX phosphorylation (at its C terminus on serine 139) has been found at the sites of double-strand breaks in chromosomal DNA (9Rogakou E.P. Boon C. Redon C. Bonner W.M. J.

Because γH2AX appears within minutes after IR, γH2AX focus formation is considered to be a sensitive and selective signal for the existence of a DNA double-strand break (14Modesti M. Kanaar R. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R229-R232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). γH2AX foci co-localize with DNA repair and checkpoint proteins including Rad50, Rad51, and Brca1 (15Paull T.T.

These H2AX knock-out cells are hypersensitive to IR defective in DNA double-strand break rejoining and fail to form 53bp1, Brca1, and Nbs1 foci in response to IR (17Celeste A. Petersen S. Romanienko P.J. Fernandez-Capetillo O. Chen H.T. Sedelnikova O.A. Reina-San-Martin B. Coppola V. Meffre E. Difilippantonio M.J. Redon C. Pilch D.R. Olaru A. Eckhaus M. Camerini-Otero R.D.

An alternative source of DNA double-strand breaks is the conversion of single-strand breaks by advancing replication forks (18Kuzminov A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8241-8246Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). DNA single-strand breaks can be produced by a variety of exogenous and endogenous DNA lesions and by the action of DNA topoisomerase I (top1) in DNA containing base damages (abasic sites, mismatches, oxidized bases, carcinogenic adducts, and UV lesions) and preexisting single-strand breaks (discover.nci.nih.gov/pommier/topo1.htm) (19Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 80: 189-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Pommier Y. Kohlhagen G. Pourquier P. Sayer J.M. Kroth H. Jerina D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 53-58PubMed Google Scholar). Top1 is a ubiquitous enzyme that regulates the topological state of DNA during replication, transcription, recombination, and repair (23Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). The top1 catalytic cycle can be summarized as follows. 1) The enzyme binds to duplex DNA (Fig. 1A). 2) It cleaves one DNA strand by a trans-esterification reaction in which a top1 tyrosine-hydroxyl group becomes covalently linked to the 3′-phosphate of a DNA phosphodiester bond to generate a 5′-hydroxyl DNA terminus. This cleavage intermediate is commonly referred to as a cleavage (or cleavable) complex (Fig. 1B). 3) DNA supercoiling is relaxed by controlled rotation of the 5′-end of the broken DNA around the intact DNA strand (Fig. 1B). 4) After DNA relaxation is complete, the cleaved DNA is religated by nucleophilic attack from the 5′-hydroxyl DNA end and dissociation of the top1 tyrosyl residue from the 3′-end (Fig. 1A) (24Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G.J. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Top1 cleavage complexes are generally widely distributed throughout the genome and normally are transient. Camptothecin and its derivatives (irinotecan and topotecan) are specific top1 inhibitors. Irinotecan has recently been approved by the FDA (Food & Drug Administration) for the treatment of colon cancers (25Stucky-Marshall L. Cancer Nurs. 1999; 22: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and topotecan has been approved for the treatment of ovarian cancers (26Barnett A.A. Lancet. 1996; 347: 1613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Takimoto C.H. Arbuck S.G. Oncology (Huntington). 1997; 11: 1635-1655PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent clinical study revealed that irinotecan is superior to etoposide for the treatment of lung cancers (28Noda K. Nishiwaki Y. Kawahara M. Negoro S. Sugiura T. Yokoyama A. Fukuoka M. Mori K. Watanabe K. Tamura T. Yamamoto S. Saijo N. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). Therefore, top1 is an important cellular target for cancer chemotherapy (29Garcia-Carbonero R. Supko J.G. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 641-661PubMed Google Scholar, 30Liu L.F. Desai S.D. Li T.K. Mao Y.

Pharmacol. 1994; 29B: 73-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Camptothecin and its derivatives trap top1-DNA cleavage complexes by inhibiting the DNA religation step (Fig. 1C) (discover.nci.nih.gov/pommier/topo1.htm) (30Liu L.F. Desai S.D. Li T.K. Mao Y. Sun M. Sim S.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 922: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 31Pommier Y. Tanizawa A. Kohn K.W. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29B: 73-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Despite the abundance of top1 throughout the cell cycle and in quiescent cells, the cytotoxicity of camptothecin is remarkably limited to replicating cells. For instance, when cells are pretreated with the DNA polymerase inhibitor, aphidicolin, they are protected from the cytotoxicity of camptothecins (32Holm C. Covey J.M. Kerrigan D. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6365-6368PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hsiang Y.H. Lihou M.G. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5077-5082PubMed Google Scholar). The replication dependence for the formation of lethal DNA lesions by camptothecins can be explained by the formation of replication-mediated DNA double-strand breaks (Fig. 1D). When a replication fork proceeds toward a top1 cleavage complex, the extension of the leading strand is blocked at the 5′-end of the cleaved DNA template with replication fork runoff, resulting in a DNA double-strand break (34Strumberg D. Pilon A.A. Smith M. Hickey R. Malkas L. Pommier Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3977-3987Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 35Snapka R.M. Mol. Cell.

In this study, we used camptothecin to investigate whether replication-mediated DNA double-strand breaks induce the formation of γH2AX and its concentration in nuclear foci. We also studied the upstream kinases implicated in the phosphorylation of H2AX and the relationship between γH2AX formation and the DNA double-strand break repair and checkpoint proteins, Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1. Finally, the functional role of γH2AX was studied in H2AX knock-out mouse cells.

Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase dead (ATRkd) cells were donated from Dr. William A. Cliby (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) and were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum containing 400 μg/ml G418. Drugs, Chemicals, and Antibodies—Camptothecin and UCN-01 were provided by the Drug Synthesis Chemistry Branch, Division of Cancer Treatment, NCI. Aphidicolin and wortmannin were purchased form Sigma. Aliquots were stored frozen at 10 mm in Me2SO and diluted further in medium immediately prior to each experiment. Anti-γH2AX mouse monoclonal antibody were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Altham, MA). Anti-γH2AX rabbit polyclonal antibody was purchased from Trevigen, (Gaithersburg, MD). Anti-Mre11 and Rad50 antibodies were purchased from Novus (Littleton, CO). Anti-Nbs1 antibody was donated from Dr. Nussenzweig (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). FITC-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Oncogene Research Products (Oncogene Science Inc., San Diego, CA). The second anti-mouse or anti-rabbit Ig antibodies conjugated with AlexaFluor 488 or 546 were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The second anti-mouse Ig antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. IR—Cells growing in T75 flask or on chamber slides were exposed to the indicated dose of IR from a 137Cs source in a Mark I irradiator (J. L. Shepherd and Associates). γH2AX analyses were performed 30 min after irradiation. Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy—Cells were grown on chamber slides. After treatment with indicated doses of camptothecin or IR with or without UCN-01, aphidicolin, or wortmannin at 37 °C, the cell preparations were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 5 min, washed in PBS, permeabilized in 100% methanol at -20 °C for 20 min, washed, blocked with PBS containing 1% BSA and 5% goat serum (Jackson Immunolaboratories, West Grove, PA) for 1 h, incubated with one or two first antibodies at 800-fold dilution for 2 h, washed, incubated with a FITC, AlexaFluor 484, or AlexaFluor 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse Ig second antibody at 200-fold dilution for 1 h, and washed in PBS. Some slides were treated with 10 units/ml ribonuclease (Sigma) and stained with propidium iodide. The slides were mounted with mounting medium (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) and viewed with a PCM2000 laser scanning confocal microscope (Nikon Co., Tokyo, Japan) using a ×40 or ×100 objectives. The projection was saved as a BMP file. Laser Scanning Cytometry—Slides of cells stained with propidium iodide, the anti-γH2AX first antibody, and the FITC-conjugated second antibody prepared by the protocol as described above were subjected to analysis by laser scanning cytometry (LSC®, CompuCute, Cambridge, MA). The DNA content and intensity of FITC signal from each cell were determined. Western Blot Analysis for γH2AX—Cells were grown to 50–80% confluence when treated with different agents. Cells were scraped and pelleted by centrifugation at 0 °C at 1,000 × g for 15 min. The pellets were washed twice in PBS, homogenized in 0.2 n H2SO4, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g. Histones were pelleted from the supernatant by adding 0.25 volume of 100% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The pellets were suspended in 100% ethanol overnight and centrifuged again at 13,000 × g. The pellets were dissolved in ultrapure water, and evaluated for protein concentration (Bio-Rad). Aliquot corresponding to 10 μg of protein was boiled in SDS sample buffer (Tris-glycine SDS sample buffer (twice), Invitrogen) and loaded onto the 4–20% Tris-Glycin precast gel (Novex, San Diego, CA). The separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membrane was blocked with TBST (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat milk for 60 min prior to incubation with 50 ng/ml anti-γH2AX antibody for 2 h. The blots were washed in TBST and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1/1,000 dilution) and visualized by chemiluminescence using the Supersignal kit (SuperSignal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate, Pierce). All of the presented data were confirmed in independent experiments. Western Blotting Analysis for Nbs1—Cells were grown to 50–80% confluency when they were subjected to the treatment with different agents. Cells were harvested by scrape and washed twice with PBS, and then they were incubated on ice for 30 min in lysis buffer (0.3% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm NaF, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μm leupeptin, 2 mm AEBSF (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride)). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was evaluated for protein concentration and either used immediately for assays or stored at -70 °C. Cell lysates containing 20 μg of total protein were electrophoresed in Tris-Glycin precast gels after being boiled with SDS sample buffer and then were electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P membranes for 1 h at 20 V. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 1 h prior to incubation with anti-Nbs1 antibody (1/10,000 dilution) for 2 h. After washing with TBST for 5 min three times, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibody (1/1,000 dilution) and visualized by chemiluminescence using the Supersignal kit. The presented result was confirmed in independent experiments. MTT Assay for Cellular Response of H2AX+/+ and H2AX-/- Cells to Camptothecin—H2AX+/+ and H2AX-/- cells were seeded into 96-well microplates at 1,000 cells/90 μl in each well and incubated overnight. The cells were treated without or with the indicated concentrations of camptothecin for 72 h. After a 72-h incubation, 10 μl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml, Sigma) was added to the each well. 4 h later, the medium was aspirated and 100 μl of Me2SO was added to each well. The optical density of each well (wavelength 520 nm) was measured with a microplate reader (Emax, Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). The survival of cells at each concentration of the drug was expressed as the percentage ratio of the optical density of cells treated with different concentrations of camptothecin to the mean optical density of the untreated cells. Measurements were performed in triplicate. Data were expressed as the mean ± S.D. The statistical difference in overall cellular responses between the two cell lines was assessed by the two-way ANOVA followed by the Scheffe's multiple comparison test. Difference in the survival ratios between the two cell lines at each concentration point was assessed by the Student's t test. When p value was <0.05, the difference was considered statistically significant. Production of γH2AX by Top1 Cleavage Complex—Fig. 2A shows that when human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells were treated with camptothecin for 1 h, γH2AX foci were observed. γH2AX focus formation increased with camptothecin concentration (Fig. 2A, compare a, b, d, and f) and with increasing the time of exposure (Fig. 2A, compare b with c and d with e) (see panels g in Fig. 2A). Western blotting confirmed the time-dependent and concentration-dependent generation of γH2AX in camptothecin-treated cells (Fig. 2B, a and b). Fig. 2C also shows that γH2AX formation required top1, because camptothecin failed to induce γH2AX in top1-deficient mouse leukemia cells (37Pourquier P. Takebayashi Y. Urasaki Y. Gioffre C. Kohlhagen G. Pommier Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). By contrast, γH2AX was generated by IR in both top1-deficient and top1-proficient cells. Together, these results indicate for the first time that top1-mediated DNA lesions induce γH2AX in human and mouse cells in dose-dependent and time-dependent manners. Top1-mediated γH2AX Foci Are Attributed to Replication-mediated DNA Damage—The first suggestion of the replication-dependent induction of γH2AX by camptothecin was the observation that γH2AX focus formation was restricted to a fraction of the camptothecin-treated cells (Figs. 2A and 3A). By contrast, γH2AX focus formation was generally observed in all of the cells irradiated with 10 Gy (Figs. 3A and 4A) as reported previously (9Rogakou E.P. Boon C. Redon C. Bonner W.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 905-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). To determine which fraction of the cells formed γH2AX foci, we performed double staining for both γH2AX and PCNA, because PCNA levels are known to be highest in replicating cells (38Celis J.E. Celis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3262-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). In the case of camptothecin-treated cells, γH2AX focus formation was restricted to PCNA-positive cells (Fig. 3A, panel a), whereas in the case of IR, γH2AX foci formed both in PCNA-positive and PCNA-negative cells (Fig. 3A, panel b). To quantify these results, slides corresponding to camptothecin (611 cells) or IR treatment (605 cells) were scored and cells were classified into four groups: PCNA-/γH2AX-, PCNA-/γH2AX+, PCNA+/γH2AX-, and PCNA+/γH2AX+ (Fig. 3B). In the case of camptothecin, γH2AX focus formation was observed in 51% of the cells. In these γH2AX-positive cells, 92% were also PCNA-positive. Conversely, 86% PCNA-negative cells were negative for γH2AX. By contrast, in cells treated with IR, the percentage of γH2AX-positive cells was similar in PCNA-positive and PCNA-negative cells (94%) (Fig. 3B).Fig. 4Effects of aphidicolin (APH), UCN-01 (7-hydroxystaurosporine), and wortmannin (Wort) on γH2AX formation by camptothecin (CPT) or IR in HCT116 cells.A, γH2AX focus formation (green) in HCT116 cells treated with CPT (1 μm, for 3 h) (e) or IR (10 Gy) (i) in the absence or presence of 1 μm aphidicolin (APH) (f and j). 0.1 μm UCN-01 (g and k), or 100 μm Wort (h and l). Cells were pretreated with APH, UCN-01, or Wort for 15 min prior to the treatment with CPT or IR. APH, UCN-01, or Wort was kept in the medium during the treatment with camptothecin (3 h) or 30 min after exposure to IR. B, Western blot analyses for the effects of APH, UCN-01, and Wort on γH2AX induction by camptothecin (b) or IR (c) in HCT116 cells. Treatment schedules were the same as described in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The relationship between γH2AX focus formation and DNA replication was further examined by comparing the cellular DNA and γH2AX contents using laser scanning cytometry (Fig. 3C). For camptothecin, cells in S-phase had the highest γH2AX contents, whereas γH2AX was lowest in the cells in the G1 and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. By contrast, for IR, γH2AX was equally distributed in all of the cell cycle phases. We also found that mitotic cells failed to form camptothecin-induced γH2AX foci, whereas γH2AX foci were observed after IR treatment (Fig. 3D, compare a with b) (9Rogakou E.P. Boon C. Redon C. Bonner W.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 905-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). We next determined the effect of pretreatment with aphidicolin, a specific inhibitor of replication polymerases that blocks the formation of camptothecin-induced replication-mediated DNA double-strand breaks in camptothecin-treated cells (34Strumberg D. Pilon A.A. Smith M. Hickey R. Malkas L. Pommier Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3977-3987Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A shows that pretreatment with aphidicolin completely suppressed the formation of γH2AX foci by camptothecin (Fig. 4A, compare f with e). By contrast, IR-induced γH2AX foci remained clearly detectable in aphidicolin-treated cells (Fig. 4A, compare j with i). Western blotting analyses confirmed inhibition of γH2AX formation by aphidicolin in camptothecin-treated cells but not in IR-treated cells (Fig. 4B, b and c). These results indicate that camptothecin induces γH2AX focus formation in a DNA replication-dependent manner. The Cell Cycle Checkpoint Modulators, UCN-01 and Wortmannin, Affect the Formation of γH2AX in Response to Top1-mediated and Replication-mediated DNA Damage—UCN-01, an anti-cancer drug in clinical trials, abrogates the S-phase checkpoint induced by camptothecin (39Shao R.G. Cao C.X. Shimizu T. O'Connor P.M. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4029-4035PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4A (panel c) shows that UCN-01 by itself did not induce γH2AX foci. However, pretreatment with UCN-01 markedly enhanced γH2AX focus formation in camptothecin-treated cells but not in cells exposed to IR (Fig. 4A, compare g with e and k with i). Western blotting analysis also demonstrated that UCN-01 enhanced γH2AX generation by camptothecin (Fig. 4B, b). These results are consistent with the findings that camptothecin-induced γH2AX formation by camptothecin is replication-dependent, because γH2AX formation increased in the absence of replication checkpoint (i.e. in UCN-01-treated cells) (see “Discussion”). We next determined the effect of wortmannin, a non-competitive and irreversible inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase-related kinases (PIKKs) (40Sarkaria J.N. Tibbetts R.S. Busby E.C. Kennedy A.P. Hill D.E. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4375-4382PubMed Google"

https://openalex.org/W1994309787,"Morphological, molecular, and biogeographic data bearing on early primate evolution suggest that the clade containing extant (or ‘crown’) strepsirrhine primates (lemurs, lorises and galagos) arose in Afro-Arabia during the early Palaeogene1, but over a century of palaeontological exploration on that landmass has failed to uncover any conclusive support for that hypothesis2. Here we describe the first demonstrable crown strepsirrhines from the Afro-Arabian Palaeogene—a galagid and a possible lorisid from the late middle Eocene of Egypt, the latter of which provides the earliest fossil evidence for the distinctive strepsirrhine toothcomb. These discoveries approximately double the previous temporal range of undoubted lorisiforms and lend the first strong palaeontological support to the hypothesis of an ancient Afro-Arabian origin for crown Strepsirrhini and an Eocene divergence of extant lorisiform families1,3."

Recent discoveries of abundant Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous salamanders are helping to address these issues. Here we report the discovery of well-preserved Middle Jurassic salamanders from China, which constitutes the earliest known record of crown-group urodeles (living salamanders and their closest relatives). The new specimens are from the volcanic deposits of the Jiulongshan Formation (Bathonian), Inner Mongolia, China, and represent basal members of the Cryptobranchidae, a family that includes the endangered Asian giant salamander (Andrias) and the North American hellbender (Cryptobranchus). These fossils document a Mesozoic record of the Cryptobranchidae, predating the previous record of the group by some 100 million years. This discovery provides evidence to support the hypothesis that the divergence of the Cryptobranchidae from the Hynobiidae had taken place in Asia before the Middle Jurassic period."

https://openalex.org/W2052838731,"Some classes of stars, including novae and supernovae, undergo explosive outbursts that eject stellar material into space. In 2002, the previously unknown variable star V838 Monocerotis brightened suddenly by a factor of approximately 10(4). Unlike a supernova or nova, it did not explosively eject its outer layers; rather, it simply expanded to become a cool supergiant with a moderate-velocity stellar wind. Superluminal light echoes were discovered as light from the outburst propagated into the surrounding, pre-existing circumstellar dust. Here we report high-resolution imaging and polarimetry of those light echoes, which allow us to set direct geometric distance limits to the object. At a distance of >6 kpc, V838 Mon at its maximum brightness was temporarily the brightest star in the Milky Way. The presence of the circumstellar dust implies that previous eruptions have occurred, and spectra show it to be a binary system. When combined with the high luminosity and unusual outburst behaviour, these characteristics indicate that V838 Mon represents a hitherto unknown type of stellar outburst, for which we have no completely satisfactory physical explanation."
https://openalex.org/W2017437930,"We describe a vertebrate hyaluronan and proteoglycan binding link protein gene family (HAPLN), consisting of four members including cartilage link protein. The encoded proteins share 45–52% overall amino acid identity. In contrast to the average sequence identity between family members, the sequence conservation between vertebrate species was very high. Human and mouse link proteins share 81–96% amino acid sequence identity. Two of the four link protein genes (HAPLN2 and HAPLN4) were restricted in expression to the brain/central nervous system, while one of the four genes (HAPLN3) was widely expressed. Genomic structures revealed that all four HAPLN genes were similar in exon-intron organization and were also similar in genomic organization to the 5' exons for the CSPG core protein genes. Strikingly, all four HAPLN genes were located immediately adjacent to the four CSPG core protein genes creating four pairs of CSPG-HAPLN genes within the mammalian genome. Furthermore, the two brain-specific HAPLN genes (HAPLN2 and HAPLN4) were physically linked to the brain-specific CSPG genes encoding brevican and neurocan, respectively. The tight physical association of the HAPLN and CSPG genes supports a hypothesis that the first HAPLN gene arose as a partial gene duplication event from an ancestral CSPG gene. There is some degree of coordinated expression of each gene pair. Collectively, the four HAPLN genes are expressed by most tissue types, reflecting the fundamental importance of the hyaluronan-dependent extracellular matrix to tissue architecture and function in vertebrate species. Comparison of the genomic structures for the HAPLN, CSPG genes and other members of the link module superfamily provide strong support for a common evolutionary origin from an ancestral gene containing one link module encoding exon.

Hyaluronan (HA) 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hyaluronan; ECM, extracellular matrix; PCM, pericellular matrix; CSPG, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan; CNS, central nervous system; HAPLN, hyaluronan and proteoglycan link; LTP, long term potentiation; EST, expressed sequence tag; PTR, proteoglycan tandem repeat; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; CRTL1, cartilage link protein 1; MTE, multiple tissue expression. functions at multiple levels within the vertebrate extracellular matrix (ECM) and pericellular matrix (PCM) (1Fraser J.R. Laurent T.C. Laurent U.B. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). HA may be found in variable amounts in many connective tissues, where it is usually bound by large aggregating chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) (1Fraser J.R. Laurent T.C. Laurent U.B. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar), such as versican and aggrecan, or within the ECMs of the brain and central nervous system (CNS), where it is most often bound by the smaller aggregating CSPGs, brevican or neurocan. Engineered and spontaneous loss-of-function mutations in the versican (2Mjaatvedt C.H. Yamamura H. Capehart A.A. Turner D. Markwald R.R. Dev. Biol. 1998; 202: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and aggrecan genes (3Watanabe H. Kimata K. Line S. Strong D. Gao L.Y. Kozak C.A. Yamada Y. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 154-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), result in mid-gestational and early postnatal lethalities, respectively. This illustrates the fundamental importance of these two CSPGs and the HA-CSPG aggregates to normal development and tissue structure and function. In contrast, mice deficient in neurocan develop in an apparently normal fashion (4Zhou X.H. Brakebusch C. Matthies H. Oohashi T. Hirsch E. Moser M. Krug M. Seidenbecher C.I. Boeckers T.M. Rauch U. Buettner R. Gundelfinger E.D. Fassler R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5970-5978Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), although they do display disturbances in long term potentiation (LTP), which suggests a role for neurocan in the normal electrophysiological function of the brain/CNS. The cartilage proteoglycan aggregate, consisting of HA and aggrecan is dependent upon cartilage link protein for its assembly and stability, with cartilage link protein and aggrecan binding along the HA chain in a 1:1 stoichiometry (5Faltz L.L. Caputo C.B. Kimura J.H. Schrode J. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; Google Scholar), i.e. one link protein monomer for each aggrecan monomer. In vitro reassociation studies and in vivo loss-of-function studies have demonstrated the critical role of cartilage link protein in the structure and function of the cartilage proteoglycan aggregate (6Morgelin M. Heinegard D. Engel J. Paulsson M. Biophys. Chem. 1994; 50: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 7Watanabe H. Yamada Y. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in cartilage link protein had a phenotype that was essentially a phenocopy of the spontaneous mouse mutant, cmd, which results from a 7-bp deletion within the aggrecan gene (7Watanabe H. Yamada Y. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 3Watanabe H. Kimata K. Line S. Strong D. Gao L.Y. Kozak C.A. Yamada Y. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 154-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The name cartilage link protein may be somewhat of a misnomer as this protein has been reported to be expressed or present in many other locations within both the developing mammalian and vertebrate embryo and the adult (8Binette F. Cravens J. Kahoussi B. Haudenschild D.R. Goetinck P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19116-19122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kobayashi H. Sun G.W. Hirashima Y. Terao T. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3835-3842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this, the phenotype associated with loss-of-function of cartilage link protein was restricted to the skeleton (7Watanabe H. Yamada Y. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This might suggest that, while cartilage link protein is expressed elsewhere, it is essential only to the stability and function of the cartilage proteoglycan aggregate and is not necessary to stabilize the HA-CSPG aggregates of other tissues, such as the brain and CNS. The recently described brain link protein, encoded for by the brain link protein 1 (BRAL1) gene (10Hirakawa S. Oohashi T. Su W.D. Yoshioka H. Murakami T. Arata J. Ninomiya Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 982-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), is clearly related to but distinct from the cartilage link protein in both amino acid sequence, predicted structure, and gene organization. This suggests that a second link protein may play a role in organizing and stabilizing the HA-CSPG aggregates of the brain and CNS. HA-CSPG aggregates do not act in isolation within the ECM and PCM. These aggregates can interact with numerous other ECM and cell surface components through binding interactions of the CSPG core protein, the chondroitin sulfate and/or the HA chain. Binding partners that have been identified to date, include HA receptors such as CD44 (11Lesley J. Hyman R. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D616-D630Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), EGF receptors (12Zhang Y. Cao L. Yang B.L. Yang B.B. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 669-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Therefore, the HA-CSPG aggregate, although present at relatively low levels in many tissues, may provide an important nucleus within the ECM and PCM around which an extensive matrix can be organized. Accordingly, the three components that make up known HA-CSPG aggregates: HA, a large aggregating CSPG protein, and a link protein, will be expected to be critical to the organization and function of the ECM and PCM of many tissues. Lastly, by providing a relatively high local concentration of negative charge, the HA-CSPG aggregate may act locally to concentrate or sequester cations such as sodium, in addition to maintaining the hydrated state of many tissues. While attempting to identify novel genes encoding HA-binding proteins, we identified multiple expressed sequence tag (EST) clones encoding predicted link module-containing sequences. Further investigation of these partial sequences indicated that they represent four different genes and are predicted to encode link proteins, homologous to cartilage link protein. We present, herein, the first description of the vertebrate link protein gene family and suggest a probable evolutionary history for the link module superfamily. Data Base Searching and Sequence Analyses—We searched the human, mouse, and “other” EST databases using the complete human cartilage link protein amino acid sequence as our search tool and the TBLASTN algorithm. Default search parameters were selected, except that low complexity sequences were permitted. Positive sequences were grouped, according to amino acid identities. The nucleotide sequences from positive EST clones were used to rescreen the EST databases, using BLASTN, in an effort to extend the cDNA sequences at the 5′- and 3′-ends. Derived cDNA sequences were used to screen the public domain human genome sequence (University of California, Santa Cruz) in an attempt to identify the chromosomal localization for each gene, in addition to determination of the probable gene structures. Genomic structures for all additional members of the link module superfamily were also obtained from the public domain human genome databases (University of California Santa Cruz and the Ensembl Web site, Ref. 18Hubbard T. Barker D. Birney E. Cameron G. Chen Y. Clark L. Cox T. Cuff J. Curwen V. Down T. Durbin R. Eyras E. Gilbert J. Hammond M. Huminiecki L. Kasprzyk A. Lehvaslaiho H. Lijnzaad P. Melsopp C. Mongin E.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 38-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence analyses were performed using the OMIGA program with gaps introduced to maximize alignments. BLASTN and Pairwise BLAST (BLAST 2 sequences) were used to confirm nucleotide sequences flanking and spanning exon-intron boundaries from genomic DNA sequences. Molecular Cloning—EST sequences were used as a starting point to obtain full-length cDNAs for each of the link protein sequences from both human and mouse. The sequences of EST clones were determined by automated DNA sequencing. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized to extend the 5′-termini and to confirm the 3′-ends using 5′- and 3′-RACE reactions with PCR-ready cDNA pools derived from human placenta and brain poly(A)+ mRNAs (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using standard PCR conditions defined by the calculated annealing temperatures of the gene-specific primers. Amplified fragments were directly ligated using TOPO-cloning (Invitrogen Corp, Carlsbad, CA), and sequences of resultant plasmids were determined using automated DNA sequencing. Synthetic oligonucleotide primers were also designed to the predicted translation start and stop codons to facilitate the generation of open-reading frames for each link protein gene. Our 5′-RACE attempts to identify the 5′-end of the human and mouse HAPLN4 genes were unsuccessful, presumably due to the high relative GC content of these mRNAs. For this reason, we screened an arrayed cDNA library constructed from human brain thalamus poly(A)+ RNA (www.rzpd.de; RZPD library number 595). Partial cDNAs for human HAPLN4 were labeled using random priming with [α-32P]dCTP, as previously described (19Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5193) Google Scholar), and hybridized to the membrane array at 60 °C overnight in ExpressHyb solution (Clontech) supplemented with 150 μg/ml sheared, denatured salmon sperm DNA. Membranes were washed three times for 30 min each, at 65 °C in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS, then exposed to BioMaxMR film (Kodak) at -80 °C with two intensifier screens. Positive clones were identified and ordered from the RZPD. The insert sizes were determined by restriction endonuclease digestion of mini-prep quality plasmid DNAs. The predicted full-length cDNA for HAPLN4 was 3.5 kilobase pairs. Those clones that possessed inserts in this size range were selected for automated DNA sequencing. To derive sequences for each HAPLN gene, either multiple overlapping ESTs were sequenced, or single cDNAs were sequenced on both strands. Northern and Multiple Tissue Array Analyses—EST clones corresponding to human versican, brevican, aggrecan, and neurocan, MFGE8 and TM6SF2 were obtained from Research Genetics (www.res-gen.com) or the American Tissue Culture Collection (www.atcc.org) as frozen glycerol stocks or stab-cultures. Plasmids were propagated in Escherichia coli and the identity of each clone confirmed using automated DNA sequencing. Inserts were isolated from each plasmid clone, and each cDNA probe was radioactively labeled as described above and sequentially hybridized to either Northern blots (human Poly(A)+ RNA blot, Origene, Rockville, MD) or Multiple Tissue Expression arrays (Clontech) at 60 °C in ExpressHyb solution supplemented with 150 μg/ml sheared, denatured salmon sperm DNA under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Membranes were hybridized overnight and washed at high stringency as described above. After membranes had been subjected to autoradiography, they were stripped by incubation for 2 × 15 min in boiling 0.5% SDS solution, then checked by autoradiography, prior to prehybridization and hybridization with the next probe. The same membrane was hybridized sequentially, to avoid differences in sample loading. Human β-actin was used as a loading control on the MTE arrays and Northerns. The majority of MTEs were exposed for 16–20 h at -80 °C to BioMaxMR film, whereas northerns were typically exposed for between 2–3 days. Two independent MTE array membranes were sequentially hybridized for each probe. Identification of a Vertebrate Link Protein Gene Family— EST data base searches led to the identification of multiple cDNA sequences encoding predicted polypeptides related to cartilage link protein. Numerous EST sequences were identified in human (>300 real hits), mouse (>200 real hits), rat (75 real hits), and zebrafish (21 real hits). In human and mouse, ESTs representing brevican, versican, CD44, TSG-6, LYVE1, and the two recently described stabilins, stabilin1 and stabilin2 (20Politz O. Gratchev A. McCourt P.A. Schledzewski K.

J. 2002; 362: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), were identified in addition to numerous ESTs encoding polypeptides most closely related to cartilage link protein (CRTL1). These particular sequences could be grouped into four classes, corresponding to CRTL1 and three potential new link proteins. In human, only three classes were identified, and were designated HAPLN (hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein) 1–3, where CRTL1 was redesignated HAPLN1. One of the new HAPLN genes, HAPLN2, has subsequently been reported elsewhere as Brain Link Protein 1, BRAL1 (10Hirakawa S. Oohashi T. Su W.D. Yoshioka H. Murakami T. Arata J. Ninomiya Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 982-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition, a partial sequence for HAPLN3 has also been previously reported as OE-HABP (21Tsifrina E. Ananyeva N.M. Hastings G. Liau G. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1625-1633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the mouse, four classes of link protein sequence were identified, which included Crtl1, Bral1, Hapln3, and a fourth member, designated Hapln4. All four members were also identified in the rat, and partial sequences representing four putative hapln genes were identified in the zebrafish, Danio rerio (accession numbers, AL723066, AL723003, AL729072, AL725723, AL727046 (putative zhapln1), AW281205 (putative zhapln2), AI616686, and AW454110 (putative zhapln3), AW422963, and BM889913 (putative zhapln4)). This would suggest that the entire HAPLN gene family is present in all vertebrates, at least as far back as the bony fishes. We obtained our first human HAPLN4 sequences from a search of the human genome (see also below) against mouse Hapln4 sequences. Subsequent data base searching with the predicted human HAPLN4 cDNA sequence yielded multiple ESTs that corresponded to the 3′-untranslated region of human HAPLN4 only. The sequence of each clone was confirmed and a cDNA library was screened in order to obtain full-length cDNA clones for human HAPLN4. A recent search of the ensembl genomic data base confirmed the existence of only four bona fide link proteins in human and mouse. The four link proteins share between 45 and 52% amino acid identity, with overall similarities of 52–62% (Fig. 1A). The percentage identities between human and mouse HAPLN proteins are: 96% (HAPLN1), 91.5% (HAPLN2), 81% (HAPLN3), and 91% (HAPLN4). This would suggest that there may be important functional distinctions between the four link proteins, perhaps in their relative specificity for interaction with one or more CSPG and with HA. All four link proteins are organized in the same way, with an N-terminal signal sequence followed by an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain and two consecutive link modules, or proteoglycan tandem repeats (PTR). The N termini and the Ig domains share the lowest overall sequence identity. Cartilage link protein binds to aggrecan via the Ig domain (22Heinegard D. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4250-4256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, low levels of sequence identity between the Ig domains would suggest that there may be differential specificity of interaction of the individual HAPLN proteins with the CSPGs (Fig. 1B). All ten cysteine residues are conserved across the family, as are the majority of those residues that have previously been shown or predicted to be important for HA binding in other link module superfamily members (Fig. 1A) (23Mahoney D.J. Blundell C.D. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22764-22771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). HAPLN4 differs from the other three members of the family; it possesses a 10-amino acid glycine-rich insertion within the first PTR and has an extended C terminus, which is rich in the amino acids glycine, tryptophan, alanine, proline, and aspartic acid (20/60 amino acids are Gly/Trp; 43/60 are Gly/Trp/Ala/Pro/Asp). Based upon the primary amino acid sequence, all four HAPLN proteins are predicted HA-binding proteins. Indeed, HAPLN1 (CRTL1) and HAPLN2 (BRAL1) are known to bind to HA (24Oohashi T. Hirakawa S. Bekku Y. Rauch U. Zimmermann D.R. Su W.D. Ohtsuka A. Murakami T. Ninomiya Y. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 19: 43-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The functional significance of the extended HAPLN4 C terminus is not known at this time. HAPLN4 possesses one potential site for N-linked glycosylation, while HAPLN2 and HAPLN3 do not contain any consensus N-glycosylation sites. Predicted molecular masses range from 38 to 43 kDa for the four HAPLN proteins. Tissue expression was investigated by Northern analyses with a range of samples from major organs (Fig. 2). While this selection lacked many tissues rich in ECM, it was useful in providing a guide to the range of expression of each HAPLN. Our results indicated that HAPLN3 is the most widely expressed of all the HAPLN genes, with a transcript size of 2.1 kb being found in most tissues, including the brain. The highest levels of expression were observed in spleen and placenta. HAPLN1 was expressed in a restricted manner, being expressed primarily by the small intestine and placenta. In contrast, HAPLN2 and HAPLN4 were essentially restricted to the brain and CNS. One HAPLN2 transcript of ∼1.9 kb was observed in human brain. One HAPLN4 transcript of 3.5 kb was also observed only in human brain. Our Northern analyses are supported by EST data base searches, which indicated that all of the HAPLN2 and HAPLN4 ESTs were derived from brain/CNS (data not shown). Overall, therefore, the HAPLN gene family includes one member that is widely expressed (HAPLN3), two members that are essentially brain/CNS specific (HAPLN2 and HAPLN4) and a fourth member (HAPLN1) that is expressed in a restricted subset of adult tissues. Collectively, HAPLN genes are expressed by most tissues.

We identified all exon-intron boundaries for each HAPLN gene and compared the gene structures for HAPLN2, HAPLN3, and HAPLN4 with the previously described structures for HAPLN1 (CRTL1) and the four large aggregating chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans genes, versican (CSPG2), brevican (BCAN), aggrecan (AGC1), and neurocan (CSPG3) (Fig. 3A). HAPLN2, HAPLN3, and HAPLN4 are comprised of 7, 5, and 5 exons, respectively. All members of the HAPLN gene family are organized in a similar fashion, with the signal peptide, Ig domain, and two PTRs encoded on separate exons. The first PTR of HAPLN2 is split into two exons, by a unique intron (Fig. 3A). Exon-intron boundaries between the signal peptide and the Ig loop, between the Ig loop and PTR1 and between PTR1 and PTR2 were conserved in all HAPLN genes. Furthermore, these exon-intron boundaries were also shared and conserved with the four CSPG genes (Fig. 3A). This conservation of gene structure strongly supports the evolution of the HAPLN and the large aggregating CSPG core protein genes from a common ancestral gene. We extended our comparative gene structure analyses of the HAPLN and CSPG genes to include all the remaining members of the link module superfamily, including CD44, LYVE1, TSG-6, stabilin1, stabilin2, and KIAA0527 (27Nagase T Ishikawa K. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These members each possess a single HA-binding PTR. We identified the exon-intron boundaries flanking the single PTR of each gene and compared the relative position of the boundary within the open-reading frame for each gene (Fig. 3B). The exon-intron boundary immediately preceding PTR1 is relatively close in all members of the link module superfamily. Furthermore, this exon-intron boundary is of the same type (+1 position) in each family member. The exon-intron boundary immediately following the PTR is also of this type and the position of this boundary is identical for CD44, LYVE1, STAB1, STAB2, TSG-6, and KIAA0527, whereas this boundary is shifted by 2 codons in the HAPLN/CSPG family members. Overall, therefore, this PTR encoding cassette can be spliced in or out of each link module superfamily transcript while maintaining the reading frame. As such, this cassette could be recruited by genes and spliced into an existing framework, creating a new HA-binding protein. Our results strongly support the evolution of the 1PTR subfamily of the link module superfamily from a common ancestor (see also Fig. 5) and also suggest that the entire link module superfamily share one common cassette, corresponding to the first PTR of the HAPLN and CSPG genes and the single PTR of the remaining family members. This would support the hypothesis that all members of the link module superfamily were derived from a single ancestral gene containing a link module sequence through a process of gene duplication or exon recruitment and subsequent divergence. Gene structure data and amino acid sequence analyses permit a grouping of TSG-6 with the two stabilin proteins/genes, suggesting that these three genes share a more recent ancestor (Fig. 5). The potential evolutionary relationship between KIAA0527 and other members of the 1PTR subfamily could not be established with current data. While attempting to determine the gene structures"
https://openalex.org/W1968730938,"The retina pigment epithelium (RPE) is fundamental for the development and function of the vertebrate eye. Molecularly, the presumptive RPE can be identified by the early expression of two transcription factors, Mitf and Otx. In mice deficient for either gene, RPE development is impaired with loss of melanogenic gene expression, raising the possibility that in the eye OTX proteins operate either in a feedback loop or in cooperation with MITF for the control of RPE-specific gene expression. Here we show that Otx2 induces a pigmented phenotype when overexpressed in avian neural retina cells. In addition, OTX2 binds specifically to a bicoid motif present in the promoter regions of three Mitf target genes, QNR71, TRP-1, and tyrosinase, leading to their transactivation. OTX2 and MITF co-localize in the nuclei of RPE cells and physically interact, and their co-expression results in a cooperative activation of QNR71 and tyrosinase promoters. Collectively, these data suggest that both transcription factors operate at the same hierarchical level to establish the identity of the RPE.

In vertebrates, melanin is synthesized in specialized cells: the neural crest-derived melanocytes, the pigmented cells of the pineal organ, and the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE). 1The abbreviations used are: RPE, retina pigment epithelium; NR, neural retina; bHLH-LZ, basic helix-loop-helix and leucine zipper family; CMV, cytomegalovirus; EST, expressed sequence tag; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; GnRH, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone; GFP, green fluroescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; DsRed, Discosoma sp red fluorescent protein. Melanin-producing cells share common features like the presence of the melanosome, a specialized organelle where transmembrane glycoproteins of the tyrosinase family synthesize melanin pigment (1Marks M.S. Seabra M.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. 2001; 2: 738-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The RPE is a monolayer of cuboidal pigmented cells playing a key role in the maintenance and function of the vertebrate eye. In mice, genetic ablation of the developing RPE causes immediate arrest of eye growth, followed by its re-adsorption (2Raymond S.M. Jackson I.J. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1286-1295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In the adult, the specific functions of this tissue are turnover of the photoreceptor outer segments, transepithelial transport, retinoid storage, and protection against light and free radicals (3Boulton M Dayhaw-Barker P. Eye. 2001; 15: 384-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In vertebrate embryos, the RPE and neural retina (NR) are generated from common precursors that retain the capacity of trans-differentiate in each other cell type both in vivo and in vitro (4Planque N.

Simeone A. Bovolenta P. Development. 2001; 128: 2019-2030PubMed Google Scholar). During eye development, the presumptive RPE can be molecularly identified by the early expression of the Mitf and Otx genes (8Hodgkinson C.A. Moore K.J. Nakayama A. Steingrimsson E. Copeland N.G.

Mitf is expressed as multiple isoforms termed Mitf-M, Mitf-A, Mitf-D, Mitf-C, and Mitf-H (10Udono T. Yasumoto K. Takeda K. Amae S. Watanabe K. Saito H. Fuse N. Tachibana M. Takahashi K. Tamai M.

Shibahara S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1574: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Mitf-M expression is restricted to neural crest-derived melanocytes, whereas those of Mitf-A and Mitf-D are enriched in the RPE (11Goding C.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1712-1728PubMed Google Scholar, 49Takeda K. Yasumoto K. Kawaguchi K. Udono T. Watanabe K. Saito H. Takahashi K. Noda M. Shibahara S. Biochim. Biophys.

Mutations in the human MITF are responsible for the Waardenburg syndrome type 2, a hereditary disorder causing deafness and pigmentation abnormalities (12Tassabehji M. Newton V.E. Read A.P. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Functional inactivation of Mitf in mice impairs the development of the RPE, which becomes a laminated second NR (6Nguyen M-T.T. Arnheiter H. Development. 2000; 127: 3581-3591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Nakayama A. Nguyen M.T. Chen C.C. Opdecamp K. Hodgkinson C.A. Arnheiter H. Mech Dev. 1998; 70: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Conversely, ectopic expression of this gene in avian NR cells induces a pigmented phenotype (4Planque N. Turque N. Opdecamp K. Bailly M. Martin P. Saule S. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 525-536PubMed Google Scholar). In line with these observations, MITF has been shown to interact and transactivate the promoter regions of genes involved in the terminal differentiation of the RPE, including the melanosome glycoprotein QNR71, the melanogenic enzyme tyrosinase (Tyr), and the tyrosinase-related proteins TRP-1 and TRP-2, through specific binding to the hexameric motif CATGTG (M-box) present in all these promoters (reviewed in Ref. 11Goding C.R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1712-1728PubMed Google Scholar). Otx genes, Otx1 and Otx2, are homeodomain-containing transcription factors known for their essential role in anterior head formation (14Simeone A. Puelles E. Acampora D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A prominent feature of the Otx homeodomains is a lysine residue at position 9 of the recognition helix, which confers high affinity binding to the same functional target sequence motif (TAATC(C/T)) recognized by bicoid on DNA (15Hanes S.D. Brent R. Cell. 1989; 57: 1275-1283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 16Driever W. Nuesslein-Volhard C.

Besides their DNA-binding properties, little is known about how Otx proteins function to activate target genes in selective regions of the embryo, and only a few direct down-stream targets of Otx function have been identified so far (19Boncinelli E. Morgan R. Trends Gen. 2001; 17: 633-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the vertebrate eye, Otx genes are initially expressed in the entire optic vesicle, but their expression soon becomes restricted to the presumptive RPE, where it is maintained throughout adulthood (7Martínez-Morales J.R. Signore M. Acampora D. Simeone A. Bovolenta P. Development. 2001; 128: 2019-2030PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bovolenta P. Mallamaci A. Briata P. Corte G. Boncinelli E. J.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2735-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that mice deficient in Otx genes present clear defects in the patterning of the RPE, which is replaced by a NR-like territory. In Otx mutants, the expression of Mitf and Tyr is largely absent and maintained only in little patches of tissue where residual OTX2 expression is also localized (7Martínez-Morales J.R. Signore M. Acampora D. Simeone A. Bovolenta P. Development. 2001; 128: 2019-2030PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, in Mitf mutants the expression of Otx2 is specifically down-regulated in those areas where RPE does not differentiate (6Nguyen M-T.T. Arnheiter H. Development. 2000; 127: 3581-3591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Bumsted K.M. Barnstable C.J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 903-908PubMed Google Scholar). These data provide genetic evidence that both Otx and Mitf are responsible for the development of the RPE (6Nguyen M-T.T. Arnheiter H. Development. 2000; 127: 3581-3591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Martínez-Morales J.R. Signore M. Acampora D. Simeone A. Bovolenta P. Development. 2001; 128: 2019-2030PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether Otx and Mitf have a hierarchical relationship and act in a feedback loop, or whether they cooperate for the direct control of gene expression in the RPE. Here, we report a series of experiments that address these questions. We show that Otx2, as Mitf, is capable of inducing a pigmented phenotype in avian NR cells. OTX2 binds specifically to a bicoid motif present in the promoter regions of genes encoding melanosome glycoproteins, leading to their transactivation. This activity is enhanced by MITF. Furthermore, MITF and OTX2 co-localize in the nuclei of retinal pigmented cells and are capable of biochemical interaction. Because OTX2 and MITF do not appear to regulate each other's expression, we propose that the two transcription factors operate at the same hierarchical level to establish the identity of the RPE. Plasmid Construction—The CMV-pCT expression vectors containing the coding regions of the hOTX1, the mOtx2, and of its mutated K50Q version were a generous gift of Dr. A. Simeone (17Simeone A.

The in-frame fusion protein GST-mOtx2 was produced by insertion of the XmaI-XhoI full-length mOtx2 fragment from mOtx2-pCVC3 in the pGEX-GST vector (Amersham Biosciences). An EcoRI-XbaI fragment of 8.2 kb containing the region upstream of the first exon of mOtx2 cloned in the pKS vector (Dr. Mallamaci's generous gift) was analyzed by automated DNA sequencing (ABI 377, Applied Biosystems) and compared with the human sequence. The information derived from this analysis was used to determine the existence in human and mouse of two different Otx2 transcripts. The identification numbers of the EST sets corresponding to the two phylogenetically conserved Otx2 transcripts are the following: T0 human (National Institutes of Health Image: 5493541, 3868090, and 5547260); T0 mouse (Image: 5400892, H3030H12, 5359966, G430026K08, 5365867, 528–5K11, 5362013, and G430009N13); T1 human (Image: 6154164, 5495438, 3870686, 3870369, 3872745, and 3353521); T1 mouse (Image: 4527414). The vector pOTX2Luc-1219, containing the 1.8-kb promoter region of the mOtx2 T1 transcript inserted in the pXP2 luciferase vector, was a generous gift of Dr. S. Guazzi (23Guazzi S. Pintonello M.L. Vigano A. Boncinelli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11092-11099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To construct the pOTX2Luc-974 vector a 1-kb 5′-flanking fragment encompassing the putative initiation site of the mOtx2 T0 transcript was amplified using the following primers (5′-ggagatcttctcagggagatttgctgag-3′; 5′-attgtcgaccagtctggaccagaagaag-3′). This fragment was then SalI/BglII-digested and subsequently inserted into the pXP2 luciferase vector. To express Mitf, the coding sequences of the isoform Mitf-A and Mift-M were inserted in the pVNC3 vector.

Cell Cultures, Transfections, and Luciferase and CAT Assays—Baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed with polyethylenimine reagent (ExGen™ 500, Euromedes) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Different amounts of expression vectors were co-transfected as indicated in the respective figures. The total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by adding empty expression vectors. A pcDNA3-lacZ vector was co-transfected for normalizations of luciferase and CAT assays. β-Galactosidase was determined in cell lysates using chemiluminescent assays, either Galacto-Star™ (Applied Biosystems) or the Luminescent β-Galactosidase Detection Kit II (Clontech). Luciferase and CAT assays were performed as previously described (27Plaza S. Dozier C. Saule S. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 1041-1050PubMed Google Scholar). Dissociated 6-day-old quail retinal cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1% minimal essential medium vitamins ×100, and 10 μg/ml conalbumin, and transformed by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (4Planque N. Turque N. Opdecamp K. Bailly M. Martin P. Saule S. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 525-536PubMed Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry—Transfected cells were fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and incubated with a polyclonal antiserum anti-MITF (4Planque N. Turque N. Opdecamp K. Bailly M. Martin P. Saule S. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 525-536PubMed Google Scholar) or anti-OTX2 (9Bovolenta P. Mallamaci A. Briata P. Corte G. Boncinelli E. J. Neuroscience. 1997; 17: 4243-4252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were detected with Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin secondary reagent (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Mitf-A, Otx2, and luciferase (control) proteins were synthesized by using the TnT coupled wheat germ extract system (Promega). 1–2 μl of protein translation extracts was incubated for 15–30 min at room temperature with 1.5 × 104 cpm of each corresponding 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide in 15 μl of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. For Otx2 binding to TRP-1 sequences, the concentration of EDTA was 5 mm and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) was added. The reaction mixture was analyzed by electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. In competition assays a 500-fold excess of cold oligonucleotide was preincubated at room temperature for 15–30 min before the addition of the labeled oligonucleotide. MitfT is a sequence of hTYR known to bind Mitf, and mMitfT is its version with a mutation in the M-box that prevents the binding (wt2 and mt3) (28Mahalingam H. Watanabe A. Tachibana M. Niles R.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). ”Cons.“ is a sequence of the rat GnRH gene previously shown to bind Otx2, and ”mCons“ is its corresponding mutated oligonucleotide (rGnRH Otx and rGnRH mut) (29Kelley C.G.

Mitf1, OtxA, OtxB, and OtxC correspond to sequences of the human TRP-1 promoter (GenBank™ accession number D83059), whereas Mitf2, OtxD, OtxE, and OtxF are sequences of the mouse tyrosinase promoter (GenBank™ accession number D00439). They appear underlined in Figs. 3A and 4A. mOtxA, mOtxB, and mOtxD are versions of OtxA, OtxB, and OtxD, respectively, where the consensus bicoid binding sequence was mutated from GGATTA to GGCCCC. mMitf2 is identical to Mitf2, but the consensus M-box CATGTG is mutated to ACTGTG.Fig. 4Otx proteins transactivate the promoter region of melanogenic genes in cooperation with Mitf-A.A, effect of OTX2 on TRP-1, tyrosinase, and QNR71 promoter transactivation assays. B, effect of MITF alone or in combination with OTX2 in similar assays. Variable amounts (indicated in the panels) of expression vectors containing either Otx2, its K50Q mutated version, Otx1, or Mitf were co-transfected in BHK-21 together with the reporter plasmid. A pcDNA3-LacZ vector was cotransfected for normalization of luciferase assays. Histograms represent values of typical experiments performed at least in duplicates. Note how OTX2 and to a lower extent OTX1 enhance the basal activity of tyrosinase, TRP-1, and QNR71 promoters in a dose-dependent manner, whereas a mutated version of the protein (OTX2 K50Q) does not. Note also the synergic activity of MITF-A and OTX2 on the tyrosinase and QNR71 promoters.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For the QNR71 gene promoter, gel retardation assays were performed as previously described (27Plaza S. Dozier C. Saule S. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 1041-1050PubMed Google Scholar) with 100 ng of bacterially expressed GST-Otx2 proteins. The DNA used as probe was the–90 to –13 QNR71 sequences upstream of the start site: 5′-agctgaagacaaaatcatgcatccctgcttaattccatcacatgatgagtcctggggcccttcatttaatcggagagc-3′ (26Turque N. Denhez F.

This sequence was mutated in either two or three of the Otx2 binding sites to generate the following competitor oligonucleotides: QNR71 2/4m (5′-agctgaagacacccgggatgcatccctgcttaattccatcacatgatgagtcctggggcccttcacgcgcccggagagc-3′) and QNR71 2/3/4m (5′-agctgaagacacccgggatgcatccctgccccgggccatcacatgatgagtcctggggcccttcacgcgcccggagagc-3′). The DNA probe contained double-strand oligonucleotides [γ-32P]ATP-labeled with the polynucleotide kinase T4. GFP and DsRed Fusion Protein Constructs and Wide Field Optical Sectioning Fluorescence Microscopy—The full coding region of mOtx2 was inserted into the BglII and ApaI sites of pVNC3 EGFP to make pVNC EGFP-Otx2. pVNC3 MiRed and pVNC EGFP-Myc were already published (22Planque N.

To determine the localization of the chimerical proteins into the nuclei, cells were fixed for 20 min at room temperature in 3% paraformaldehyde in PHEM buffer (60 mm Pipes, 25 mm Hepes, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm magnesium acetate, pH 6.9). Cells were washed three times in PBS and permeabilized for 25 min in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Chromosomes were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) for 5 min. After a rinse in PBS, coverslips were mounted in 50% PBS/glycerol containing anti-fading reagent 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Sigma) at 100 μg/ml. Pictures of fixed cells were collected with the help of Metamorph software (Universal Imaging), using a three-dimensional deconvolution imaging system. In Situ Hybridization—The 5′-divergent regions of the T0 and T1 transcripts were amplified by RT-PCR from E10.5 mouse embryos using the following primers (T0: 5′-gaaccttcctcagctccaac-3′ and 5′-acagccgcattggacgttag-3′; T1: 5′-caggtttatctggtctcactc-3′ and 5′-caaacaaacagaaatgctgg-3′). The resulting 152- and 200-bp amplicons were cloned in to the pGEM®-T Easy vector (Promega). Digoxigenin-labeled antisense probes were generated to recognize specifically the divergent 5′-ends of the mOtx2 T0 and T1 transcripts. A digoxigenin probe covering the entire coding sequence of Otx2 was used as control. Wholemount in situ hybridizations were performed as described before (9Bovolenta P. Mallamaci A. Briata P. Corte G. Boncinelli E. J. Neuroscience. 1997; 17: 4243-4252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RT-PCR Assays—Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from the indicated tissues, using the Quick-prep-Micro mRNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences, UK). Reverse transcription was performed by random priming with the First-Strand-cDNA Synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. Reactions to amplify fragments specific for the T0 and T1 transcripts of Otx2 were performed using the same primers described above for the in situ hybridization. Control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was amplified with the following primers: forward 5′-tgaaggtcggtgtgaacggatttggc-3′; reverse 5′-catgtaggccatgaggtccaccac-3′. Amplification conditions were: 30 cycles (95 °C 30 s, 59 °C 30 s, and 72 °C 30 s) using the AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Automated DNA sequencing (ABI 377, Applied Biosystems) confirmed identity of the amplified bands. In Vitro Protein-Protein Interaction Assays—The S35-radiolabeled proteins used in pull-down experiments were translated in vitro using the TnT® coupled reticulocyte lysate system according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Promega). The GST chimerical proteins (GSTOtx2-(1–249) and GSTMitf-(193–413)), derived from the above-described vectors, were purified from bacteria lysate using a glutathione-Sepharose™ matrix, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Protein interaction and phosphorimaging analysis were performed as previously described (22Planque N. Leconte L. Coquelle F.M. Martin P. Saule S. J. Biol.

Expression of Otx2 in Quail Neural Retina Cells Induces a Pigmented Phenotype—The ocular phenotypes of Otx- and Mitf-deficient mice indicate that both factors are required for RPE differentiation (6Nguyen M-T.T. Arnheiter H. Development. 2000; 127: 3581-3591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Martínez-Morales J.R. Signore M. Acampora D. Simeone A. Bovolenta P. Development. 2001; 128: 2019-2030PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of the melanocytic isoform of Mitf (Mitf-M) in neural retina cells is sufficient to induce a pigmented phenotype, suggesting that this protein has, on its own, the capability of activating the genetic network that triggers RPE differentiation (4Planque N. Turque N. Opdecamp K. Bailly M. Martin P. Saule S. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 525-536PubMed Google Scholar). To assess whether OTX2 has a similar capability, we stably transfected dissociated cells derived from E6 quail NR with the Otx2 vector. In parallel dishes, we transfected a vector containing one of the retina isoform of Mitf (Mitf-A) (31Amae S. Fuse N. Yasumoto K. Sato S. Yajima I. Yamamoto H. Udono T. Durlu Y.K. Tamai M. Takahashi K. Shibahara S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 710-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) as well as Mitf-M and the empty vector as positive and negative controls. After G418 selection, pigmented foci were evident not only in Mitf-M- and Mitf-A-transfected dishes but also in cells expressing OTX2 (Fig. 1, B–D). No pigmented foci were ever observed in cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 1A). This result demonstrates that Otx2 overexpression can drive NR cells to a pigmented phenotype, although the overall morphology of the cells was different from that observed after Mitf transfection (Fig. 1, compare staining pattern in and F). Interestingly, immunolocalization of MITF was observed in cell nuclei of some, but not all, Otx2-induced pigmented foci (Fig. 1F). Conversely, OTX2 was immunodetected in some of the pigmented foci induced by Mitf transfection (Fig. 1E). OTX2 but Not MITF Regulates the Promoter Region of a Newly Identified Alternative Otx2 Transcript—These data underscore the importance of both Mitf and Otx2 in the induction of a pigment phenotype, but do not clearly point to the hierarchical relationship between Otx2 and Mitf. In fact they are consistent both with the existence of a regulatory loop between the two factors and with the possibility that OTX2 initiates melanogenic gene expression in the absence of Mitf. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we first asked whether Mitf could regulate Otx2 promoter region and vice versa. In vertebrates the proposed genomic structure of the Otx2 gene encompasses three different exons and does not include any identified alternative splicing forms. However, sequencing of an 8.2-kb fragment upstream of the mOtx2 coding region, alignment with its human counterpart, and comparison with the EST databases (see “Experimental Procedures”) revealed the presence of two phylogenetically conserved sets of clones corresponding to two distinct Otx2 mRNAs (Fig. 2A). These mRNAs are splicing variants of the Otx2 gene, both encoding for the same protein but differing in their 5′ untranslated region and consequently in their promoter region. We termed these transcripts T0 and T1, the last corresponding to the previously proposed unique mOtx2 mRNA (17Simeone A. Acampora D. Mallamaci A. Stornaiuolo A. D'Apice M.R. Nigro V. Boncinelli E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2735-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). A schematic representation of the relative position (–4688 from ATG) of the newly identified alternative exon (E0) is shown in Fig. 2A. RT-PCR amplification with specific primers confirmed the presence of both transcripts in E9.5 mouse embryo as well as in postnatal and adult eyes. However, the relative abundance of the two transcripts seemed different, with a stronger expression of the T0 form (Fig. 2B). The trend of these results was further supported by in situ hybridization comparative analysis using specific digoxigenin-labeled probes directed against either the full coding sequence of the protein or the specific 5′ untranslated region of either T1 or T0. At E10.5, both T0 and T1 were expressed, although with different intensities, according to the previously reported distribution, including the developing fore- and midbrain and the presumptive RPE region of the eye (Fig. 2C) (9Bovolenta P.

https://openalex.org/W2080560721,"Aberrant promoter methylation is a fundamental mechanism of inactivation of tumor suppressor genes in cancer. The Ras association domain family 1A gene (RASSF1A) is frequently epigenetically silenced in several types of human solid tumors. In this study, we have investigated the expression and methylation status of the RASSF1A gene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In two HCC cell lines (HepG2 and Hep3B) RASSF1A was inactivated and treatment of these cell lines with a DNA methylation inhibitor reactivated the transcription of RASSF1A. The methylation status of the RASSF1A promoter region was analysed in 26 primary liver tissues including HCC, hepatocellular adenoma (HCA), liver fibrosis, hepatocirrhosis. Out of 15, 14 (93%) HCC were methylated at the RASSF1A CpG island and hypermethylation was independent of hepatitis virus infection. RASSF1A was also methylated in two out of two fibrosis and in three (75%) out of four cirrhosis; the latter carries an increased risk of developing HCC. Additionally, we analysed the methylation status of p16INK4a and other cancer-related genes in the same liver tumors. Aberrant methylation in the HCC samples was detected in 71% of samples for p16, 25% for TIMP3, 17% for PTEN, 13% for CDH1, and 7% for RARβ2. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that RASSF1A and p16INK4a inactivation by methylation are frequent events in hepatocellular carcinoma, but not in HCA, which is in contrast to HCC without cirrhosis, viral hepatitis, storage diseases, or genetic background. Therefore, this study gives additional evidence against a progression of adenoma to carcinoma in the liver. Thus, RASSF1A hypermethylation could be useful as a marker of malignancy and to distinguish between the distinct forms of highly differentiated liver neoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2056790195,"Gain of 12p material is invariably associated with testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) of adolescents and adults, most usually as an isochromosome 12p. We analyzed TGCTs with i(12p) using a global approach to expression profiling targeting chromosomes (comparative expressed sequence hybridization, CESH). This indicated overexpression of genes from 12p11.2-p12.1 relative to testis tissue and fibroblasts. The nonseminoma subtype showed higher levels of expression than seminomas. Notably, 12p11.2-p12.1 is amplified in about 10% of TGCTs and CESH analysis of such amplicon cases showed high levels of overexpression from this region. Microarray analysis, including cDNA clones representing most UniGene clusters from 12p11.2-p12.1, was applied to DNA and RNA from 5 TGCTs with amplification of 12p11.2-p12.1 and seven TGCTs with gain of the entire short arm of chromosome 12. Expression profiles were consistent with the CESH data and overexpression of EST595078, MRPS35 and LDHB at 12p11.2-p12.1 was detected in most TGCTs. High-level overexpression of BCAT1 was specific to nonseminomas and overexpression of genes such as CMAS, EKI1, KRAS2, SURB7 and various ESTs correlated with their amplification. Genes such as CCND2, GLU3, LRP6 and HPH1 at 12p13 were also overexpressed. The overexpressed sequences identified, particularly those in the region amplified, represent candidate genes for involvement in TGCT development."
https://openalex.org/W2036907745,"Thioredoxin is a redox-regulating protein, the expression of which is induced by various forms of oxidative stress. Thioredoxin controls the interactions of various transcription factors through redox regulation. In K562 cells, we have previously reported that hemin induces activation of the thioredoxin gene by regulating NF-E2-related factor (Nrf2) through the antioxidant responsive element (ARE). We showed here that tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), an electrophile stressor, activates the thioredoxin gene through the ARE. In an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, a specific Nrf2/small Maf binding complex was induced by tBHQ and bound to the ARE. Overexpression of Nrf2 increased the tBHQ-induced thioredoxin gene activation through the ARE, whereas that of Jun and Fos suppressed the activation. The tBHQ-induced ARE binding activity was completely abrogated by an oxidizing agent, diamide, whereas 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) reversibly recovered the inhibitory effects of diamide, suggesting that ARE binding activity is redox-dependent. Moreover, overexpression of thioredoxin enhanced the ARE-mediated thioredoxin gene activation by tBHQ. Therefore, ARE-mediated induction of thioredoxin expression is a mechanism of enhancing signal transduction through the ARE in electrophile-induced stress responses."

Here we report the immunopurification, identification and characterization of SIMA135/CDCP1 (subtractive immunization M(+)HEp3 associated 135 kDa protein/CUB domain containing protein 1) using one of these mAbs designated 41-2. Protein expression levels of SIMA135/CDCP1 correlated with the metastatic ability of variant HEp3 cell lines. Protein sequence analysis predicted a cell surface location and type I orientation of SIMA135/CDCP1, which was confirmed directly by immunocytochemistry. Analysis of deglycosylated cell lysates indicated that up to 40 kDa of the apparent molecular weight of SIMA135/CDCP1 is because of N-glycosylation. Western blot analysis using a antiphosphotyrosine antibody demonstrated that SIMA135/CDCP1 from HEp3 cells is tyrosine phosphorylated. Selective inhibitor studies indicated that an Src kinase family member is involved in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein. In addition to high expression in M(+)HEp3 cells, the SIMA135/CDCP1 protein is expressed to varying levels in 13 other human tumor cell lines, manifesting only a weak correlation with the reported metastatic ability of these tumor cell lines. The protein is not detected in normal human fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Northern blot analysis indicated that SIMA135/CDCP1 mRNA has a restricted expression pattern in normal human tissues with highest levels of expression in skeletal muscle and colon. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated apical and basal plasma membrane expression of SIMA135/CDCP1 in epithelial cells in normal colon. In colon tumor, SIMA135/CDCP1 expression appeared dysregulated showing extensive cell surface as well as cytoplasmic expression. Consistent with in vitro shedding experiments on HEp3 cells, SIMA135/CDCP1 was also detected within the lumen of normal and cancerous colon crypts, suggesting that protein shedding may occur in vivo. Thus, specific immunodetection followed by proteomic analysis allows for the identification and partial characterization of a heretofore uncharacterized human cell surface antigen."
https://openalex.org/W2066847074,"Cytokines such as Fas-ligand (Fas-L) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) can induce human colon cancer cell apoptosis through engagement of their death domain receptors. All the cancer cells are not sensitive to these cytokines. We have shown recently that low doses of cytotoxic drugs could restore TRAIL-induced cell death in resistant colon cancer cell lines. The present work further explores the death pathway triggered by the cytotoxic drug/TRAIL combination in HT-29 colon cancer cells (www.alexis-corp.com). Clinically relevant concentrations of cisplatin, doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil synergize with TRAIL to trigger HT-29 cell death. Activation of this pathway leads to apoptosis that involves both caspases and the mitochondria. An increased recruitment of Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and procaspase-8 to the TRAIL-induced death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) was shown in cells exposed to anticancer drugs. Following caspase-8 activation at the DISC level, the mitochondria-dependent death pathway is activated, as demonstrated by the cleavage of Bid, the dissipation of DeltaPsi(m), the release of mitochondrial proteins in the cytosol and the inhibitory effect of Bcl-2 expression. Importantly, besides mitochondrial potentiation, we show here that cytotoxic drugs sensitize HT-29 colon cancer cells to TRAIL-induced cell death by enhancing FADD and procaspase-8 recruitment to the DISC, a novel mechanism whose efficacy could depend partly on Bcl-2 expression level."
https://openalex.org/W2011207598,"Until recently, the ability of ARF (human p14ARF, murine p19ARF) tumour-suppressor protein, encoded by the INK4A/ARF locus, to inhibit cell growth in response to various stimuli was related to its ability to stabilize p53 through the so-called ARF/MDM2/p53 pathway. However, recent data have demonstrated that ARF is not implicated in this unique p53-dependent pathway. By use of transient and stable expression, we show here that human p14ARF inhibits the growth of human tumoral cells lacking functional p53 by inducing a transient G2 arrest and subsequently apoptosis. This p14ARF–induced G2 arrest was correlated with inhibition of CDC2 activity, inactivation of CDC25C phosphatase and induction of the CDK inhibitor p21WAFI. Apoptosis was demonstrated using Hoechst 33352 staining, proteolytic activation of caspase-3 and PARP cleavage. Similar results were obtained in experiments with cells synchronized by hydroxyurea block. Importantly, we were able to reproduce these effects ‘in vivo’ by showing that p14ARF inhibits the growth of p53 nullizygous human tumours in nude mice and induces the regression of p53 −/− established tumours. In these experiments, tumoral regression was associated with inhibition of cell proliferation as well as induction of apoptosis confirming the data obtained in cell lines."

Mutations of six different loci have been associated with HPS in humans, the most frequent of which are mutations of the HPS1 and HPS4 genes.

In a partially purified vesicular/organellar fraction, HPS1 and HPS4 are both components of a complex with a molecular mass of ∼500 kDa, termed BLOC-3. Within BLOC-3, HPS1 and HPS4 are components of a discrete ∼200-kDa module termed BLOC-4. In the cytosol, HPS1 (but not HPS4) is part of yet another complex, termed BLOC-5. We propose that the BLOC-3 and BLOC-4 HPS1·HPS4 complexes play a central role in trafficking cargo proteins to newly formed cytoplasmic organelles. Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS 1The abbreviations used are: HPS, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome; BLOC, biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex; GST, glutathione S-transferase.; Mendelian Inheritance in Man 203300) is a group of autosomal recessive genetic diseases characterized by pulmonary fibrosis, oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding tendency, and progressive pulmonary fibrosis, the result of defective biosynthesis of lysosomes, melanosomes, and platelet dense granules (1Spritz R.A.

However, the great majority of the human and mouse HPS-related genes encode proteins whose functions are not yet known. Most human HPS patients have mutations of either HPS1 or HPS4. Human HPS1 is a 700-amino acid, 79.3-kDa, non-membrane protein, and HPS4 is a 708-amino acid, 76.9-kDa, non-membrane protein, both unrelated to other known proteins and containing no sequence motifs that might provide clues to their functions in organellar biogenesis. Nevertheless, several lines of evidence suggest that the HPS1 and HPS4 proteins may be functionally related. First, Hps1-mutant (pale-ear; ep) and Hps4-mutant (light-ear; le) mice exhibit very similar phenotypes, grossly and at the biochemical and cellular ultrastructural levels (19Lane P.W. J. Hered. 1967; 58: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 20Lane P.W. Green E.L. J. Hered. 1967; 58: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21Meisler M. Levy J. Sansone F. Gordon M. Am. J. Pathol. 1980; 101: 581-594PubMed Google Scholar). Second, ep/ep, le/le double-homozygous mutant mice have a phenotype that is the same as that of the two homozygous single mutants (22Meisler M.H. Wanner L. Strahler J. J. Hered. 1984; 75: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Third, the HPS1 protein is absent in cells of both Hps1-mutant (ep) and Hps4-mutant (le) mice (7Suzuki T. Li W. Zhang Q. Karim A. Novak E.K. Sviderskaya E.V. Hill S.P. Bennett D.C. Levin A.V. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Fong C.-T. Castellan C. Miterski B. Swank R.T. Spritz R.A. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Finally, the HPS1 and HPS4 proteins partially co-localize in cytoplasmic vesicles of transfected melanoma cells (7Suzuki T. Li W. Zhang Q. Karim A. Novak E.K. Sviderskaya E.V. Hill S.P. Bennett D.C. Levin A.V. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Fong C.-T. Castellan C. Miterski B. Swank R.T. Spritz R.A. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Together, these data strongly suggest a functional relationship or interaction between the HPS1 and HPS4 proteins. Herein, we show that the human HPS1 and human HPS4 proteins are both components of a ∼500 kDa complex associated with vesicles and organelles that we named biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 3 (BLOC-3). Within BLOC-3, HPS1 and HPS4 are contained in a discrete ∼200 kDa module that we term BLOC-4. It is likely that BLOC-4, and certainly BLOC-3, contain additional protein components not yet identified. Our findings indicate that, as components of BLOC-3 and BLOC-4, the HPS1 and HPS4 proteins play a coordinated role in trafficking of proteins to newly synthesized organelles. DNA Constructs—Full-length human HPS1 (4Oh J. Bailin T. Fukai K. Feng G.H. Ho L. Mao J.L. Frenk E. Tamura N. Spritz R.A. Nat.

To express GST-HPS4 fusion protein in Escherichia coli, we recombined pENTR3C-HPS4 with pDEST15, a vector for N-terminal GST fusion expression from a T7 promoter, creating pDEST15-HPS4. Recombinant Protein Expression, Purification, and Antibody Production—pDEST15-HPS4 was introduced into E. coli BL21-CodonPlus-RP (Stratagene), and GST-HPS4 fusion protein was purified from inclusion bodies (U.S. Dept. Commerce/NOAA/NMFS/NWFSC/Molecular Biology Protocols; URL: micro.nwfsc.noaa.gov/protocols/inclusion.html), and used as immunogen to prepare anti-hHPS4 polyclonal antisera in rabbits and HPS4 monoclonal antibodies in mice (Covance). Monoclonal antibodies to HPS1 were described previously (23Oh J. Liu Z.-X. Feng G.H. Raposo G. Spritz R.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).

Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 200 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate at 37 °C in a 10% CO2 atmosphere. Melan-ep or melan-le melanocytes were transfected with the pIREShyg2-HPS1 and pIREShyg2-HPS4 constructs using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science), and stable transformants were selected in culture media containing 300 μg/ml hygromycin B.

Cells were visualized by standard bright-field and Hoffman illumination microscopy. Immunoblotting—Proteins were separated in 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked in 5% fat-free milk in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature, and then were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Tween 20, and the appropriate primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then washed extensively, incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature, and washed again. Signals were detected using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Blots were calibrated with pre-stained molecular weight standards (Invitrogen). For analysis of HPS4·HPS1 complexes, immunoblots of gel filtration fractions, previously probed with anti-HPS1 antibody (23Oh J. Liu Z.-X. Feng G.H. Raposo G. Spritz R.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), were stripped in 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, for 30 min at 50 °C and were reprobed as described above. Reverse Transcription-PCR—RNA from melan-a and melan-le melanocytes was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II RNase H- reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT)25 as primer (Invitrogen). PCR was performed using equivalent amounts of melan-a and melan-le RNAs, Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), and mouse Hps1 forward (5′-GACTTCCGCCTGCTCCTACTTCCT-3′) and reverse (5′-GCGTGAGCAGCTCATAGCAC-3′) primers derived from exons 20 and 22, respectively. Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—MNT1 cells were lysed in 50 mm Na-phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1% Tween 20, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). 600 μl of fresh lysate was incubated with 40 μl of rabbit anti-HPS4 antisera, 40 μl of HPS1 monoclonal antibody, 40 μl of rabbit preimmune immunoglobulins (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or 40 μl of mouse preimmune immunoglobulins (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences), pre-washed in lysis buffer, was added and the samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed several times in lysis buffer and then boiled for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer. To test the effect of Tris-HCl on the BLOC-3 complex, we purified the vesicular-organellar fraction from MNT1 cells as described (23Oh J. Liu Z.-X. Feng G.H. Raposo G. Spritz R.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) using 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, as above. The fraction was then resuspended in either phosphate buffer or Tris buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Tween 20), immunoprecipitated using HPS1 antibody or HPS4 antibody, and analyzed by Western blot analysis using HPS4 antibody or HPS1 antibody, respectively. For purification of His-tagged proteins, cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors, and lysates were incubated with TALON metal affinity resins (Clontech) at room temperature for 30 min, washed several times in lysis buffer, and boiled for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer. Yeast Two-Hybrid Assays—Full-length mouse Hps1 and Hps4 cDNAs were inserted in-frame in the DNA binding domain (pGBKT7) and activation domain (pGADT7) Gal4 transcription factor vectors of the Matchmaker Gal4 two-hybrid system 3 (Clontech), and verified by sequencing. Fusion constructs were co-transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109. At least two colonies of each double transformant growing on low-stringency medium (-Trp/-Leu) were suspended in low-stringency broth and grown at 30 °C for 16 h with shaking. Cell cultures were adjusted to 0.4 OD at 600 nm, and 3 μl from each co-transformation were spotted onto low- and high-stringency (-Trp/-Leu/-His/-Ade) SD (Clontech) plates containing X-α Gal. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 5 days and monitored for growth and blue color by visual inspection. Complementation Analysis of HPS1-null and HPS4-null Mouse Melanocytes—We generated cultured melanocyte cell lines from homozygous Hps1 null-mutant (ep) and Hps4 null-mutant (le) mice, designated melan-ep and melan-le, respectively (7Suzuki T. Li W. Zhang Q. Karim A. Novak E.K. Sviderskaya E.V. Hill S.P. Bennett D.C. Levin A.V. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Fong C.-T. Castellan C. Miterski B. Swank R.T. Spritz R.A. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, compared with wild-type melan-a melanocytes, both melan-ep and melan-le melanocytes appear hypopigmented, contain relatively few melanized melanosomes, and show a wide range of melanosome sizes, including macromelanosomes and atypical aggregates of normal-sized melanosomes (not shown), similar to those seen in the corresponding mutant mice in vivo (7Suzuki T. Li W. Zhang Q. Karim A. Novak E.K. Sviderskaya E.V. Hill S.P. Bennett D.C. Levin A.V. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Fong C.-T. Castellan C. Miterski B. Swank R.T. Spritz R.A. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). All aspects of this abnormal phenotype appear more marked in melan-le than in melan-ep cells, even though le-mutant mice are phenotypically indistinguishable from ep-mutant mice (7Suzuki T. Li W. Zhang Q. Karim A. Novak E.K. Sviderskaya E.V. Hill S.P. Bennett D.C. Levin A.V. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Fong C.-T. Castellan C. Miterski B. Swank R.T. Spritz R.A. Nat.

We showed previously that the HPS1 protein is unexpectedly absent in tissues from Hps4-null (le-mutant) mice as well as from Hps1-null (ep-mutant) mice (7Suzuki T. Li W. Zhang Q. Karim A. Novak E.K. Sviderskaya E.V. Hill S.P. Bennett D.C. Levin A.V. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Fong C.-T. Castellan C. Miterski B. Swank R.T. Spritz R.A. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, we obtained the same result on Western blot analysis of cultured melan-ep and melan-le melanocytes; both lack detectable HPS1 protein. We could not assay HPS4 protein in these cells, because our human HPS4 polyclonal antisera and monoclonal antibodies do not recognize the mouse HPS4 protein. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR showed that the amount of Hps1 mRNA is approximately equal in wild-type melan-a versus melan-le cells (data not shown), indicating that HPS4 protein apparently is not required for transcription and biogenesis of Hps1 mRNA. These results suggest instead either that HPS4 is required for biosynthesis of HPS1 or that absence of HPS4 destabilizes HPS1. To determine whether HPS4 is required for biosynthesis of HPS1, we overexpressed human HPS4 in Hps1-null melan-ep mouse melanocytes by stable transformation with a human HPS4 cDNA expression plasmid and human HPS1 in Hps4-null melan-le melanocytes by transformation with a human HPS1 expression plasmid. As expected, melan-ep cells transfected with the HPS1 expression plasmid produced abundant human HPS1 protein (Fig. 2, lane 4) and were complemented to a normal pigmentation and melanosomal cellular phenotype (Fig. 1). Likewise, melan-le cells transfected with the HPS4 expression plasmid produced abundant human HPS4 protein (Fig. 2, lane 8) and were complemented to a normal cellular phenotype (Fig. 1). Moreover, over-expression of human HPS4 protein in transfected melan-le cells fully restored expression of endogenous HPS1 protein (Fig. 2, lane 8). In contrast, melan-ep cells transfected with the HPS4 expression plasmid produced abundant human HPS4 protein (Fig. 2, lane 5), although they of course still expressed no endogenous HPS1 protein (Fig. 2) and showed no apparent correction of the abnormal pigmentary or melanosomal phenotype (Fig. 1). However, melan-le cells transfected with the HPS1 expression plasmid produced abundant human HPS1 protein (Fig. 2, lane 7), demonstrating that HPS4 is not required for biosynthesis of HPS1. Interestingly, these cells showed partial correction of the abnormal cellular phenotype (Fig. 1) presumably because of correction of the secondary HPS1 deficit in these cells. These results show clearly that HPS4 is not required for biosynthesis of HPS1 protein but that HPS4 instead most likely stabilizes HPS1 as part of a protein complex. HPS1 and HPS4 Co-immunoprecipitate—To determine whether HPS1 and HPS4 are in a protein complex, we independently immunoprecipitated HPS1 and HPS4 from human MNT1 melanoma cells and subsequently assayed HPS4 protein in the HPS1 immunoprecipitate and vice versa. As shown in Fig. 3, monoclonal antibody to human HPS1 detected the typical HPS1 doublet in the HPS4 immunoprecipitate. Likewise, polyclonal antibody to human HPS4 detected a single band in the HPS1 immunoprecipitate corresponding to human HPS4. Thus, HPS1 and HPS4 indeed co-immunoprecipitate, indicating that they are in a protein complex. Similarly, we detected interaction between the human HPS4 and mouse HPS1 proteins in vivo, assayed both by co-immunoprecipitation of mHPS1-hHPS4 from melan-le cells transfected by the pIREShyg2-HPS4 expression plasmid (not shown) and by expressing human His-tagged HPS4 in transfected mouse melan-le melanocytes, purifying the His-tagged HPS4 protein on a metal ion column and immunoblotting the bound protein for HPS1 (Fig. 3). Together, these results demonstrate that HPS1 and HPS4 are components of a protein complex in vivo. HPS1 and HPS4 Do Not Interact in a Yeast Two-hybrid System, but HPS4 Binds to Itself—To determine whether HPS1 and HPS4 interact directly, we used a yeast two-hybrid system to test interaction between full-length HPS1 and HPS4. Appropriate combinations of mouse HPS1 and HPS4 binding domain and activation domain constructs were co-transfected into yeast strain AH109 and the co-transformants were plated on SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp. As shown in Fig. 4, we saw no growth for any of the HPS1·HPS4 co-transformants in any combination, indicating that mouse HPS1 and HPS4 do not interact directly, at least in this yeast system. However, as shown in Fig. 4, we observed vigorous growth and blue color for the HPS4·HPS4 combination, indicating that HPS4 monomers interact strongly with each other. We observed no apparent HPS1·HPS1 interaction. We obtained identical results using human HPS1 and HPS4 constructs (not shown). These results indicate that HPS1 and HPS4 may not interact directly but that HPS4 self-associates to at least a dimer. HPS1 and HPS4 Are Components of a ∼500-kDa Cytoplasmic Vesicular-Organellar Complex, BLOC-3—We showed previously that HPS1 is part of a >500-kDa cytoplasmic vesicular-organellar complex and a ∼200-kDa cytosolic complex (23Oh J. Liu Z.-X. Feng G.H. Raposo G. Spritz R.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To determine which of these high molecular mass HPS1 complexes contains HPS4, we reinterrogated the immunoblots used in the previous study, now using antisera to HPS4. As shown in Fig. 5A, HPS1 and HPS4 are both contained in the same >500-kDa cytoplasmic vesicular/organellar fraction from FME melanoma cells. In contrast, the HPS4 protein was undetectable in cytosolic fractions from both FME melanoma cells (Fig. 5B) and human lymphoblastoid cells (not shown). These results demonstrate that the >500-kDa cytoplasmic vesicular-organellar complex represents BLOC-3. A Discrete ∼200-kDa HPS1·HPS4 Complex, BLOC-4, Is a Module of BLOC-3—We showed previously that treatment of the >500-kDa BLOC-3 complex with 100 mm Tris-HCl results in release of HPS1 as a ∼200-kDa post-Tris HPS1 complex, which we speculated might be identical to the ∼200-kDa HPS1 complex observed in the cytosol (23Oh J. Liu Z.-X. Feng G.H. Raposo G. Spritz R.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To determine whether HPS4 is also released from BLOC-3 by Tris-HCl, we reinterrogated the immunoblots used in the previous study, now using antisera to HPS4. As shown in Fig. 5C, treatment of the FME melanoma vesicular/organellar fraction with 100 mm Tris-HCl results in release of both HPS1 and HPS4 into the same ∼200-kDa sub-fractions. Thus, HPS1 and HPS4 are both released from BLOC-3 into a ∼200-kDa post-Tris complex. To determine whether HPS1 and HPS4 released from BLOC-3 by Tris-HCl reside together in a single ∼200-kDa post-Tris complex or in two different ∼200-kDa post-Tris complexes, we tested whether HPS1 and HPS4 could still be coimmunoprecipitated after dissociation from BLOC-3 by 100 mm Tris-HCl. As shown in Fig. 6, treatment of the vesicular/organellar fraction of MNT1 melanoma cells with Tris-HCl did not affect subsequent co-immunoprecipitation of HPS1 and HPS4, indicating that these two proteins are released from BLOC-3 in a single ∼200-kDa post-Tris complex that we designate BLOC-4. BLOC-4 thus represents a discrete module of BLOC-3 and is clearly distinct from the ∼200 kDa cytosolic HPS1 complex, which does not contain HPS4 (Fig. 5B) and which we tentatively designate BLOC-5. The fractionation scheme and relationship of BLOC-3, BLOC-4, and BLOC-5 are shown in Fig. 7.Fig. 7Fractionation scheme of the BLOC-3, BLOC-4, and BLOC-5 complexes. Melanoma cell homogenate is centrifuged at 1,000 × g to yield a postnuclear supernatant that is further centrifuged at 10,000 × g to yield a fraction containing large vesicles and organelles and BLOC-3 (>500 kDa; HPS1 + HPS4). Treatment of the vesicular-organellar fraction with 100 mm Tris-HCl yields BLOC-4 (∼200 kDa; HPS1 + HPS4). Centrifugation of the postnuclear supernatant at 10,000 × g, and subsequently 100,000 × g, yields a cytosol fraction that contains BLOC-5 (∼200 kDa; HPS1, no HPS4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HPS is a group of autosomal recessive diseases associated with defective biogenesis of a specific group of organelles: melanosomes, lysosomes, platelet dense granules, and certain other granular elements. This unique constellation of related disorders suggests that there must be specific biosynthetic path-ways particular to these organelles, an idea supported by recent cell biological evidence (26Raposo G. Tenza D. Murphy D.M. Berson J.F. Marks M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 809-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In the mouse, at least 16 different loci are associated with HPS-like phenotypes (9Bennett D. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 146: 191-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 10Swank R.T. Novak E.K.

In humans, six genes have been associated with HPS, each corresponding to one of the mouse HPS loci (4Oh J. Bailin T. Fukai K. Feng G.H. Ho L. Mao J.L. Frenk E. Tamura N. Spritz R.A. Nat.

These genetically defined loci provide an avenue to elucidate the physical components required for mammalian organellogenesis. There has been considerable progress recently in understanding the relationships among these HPS-related genes, and several of the corresponding proteins have now been shown to be associated with each other in poly-protein complexes. Mouse mocha (mh)/human AP3D1 and mouse pearl (pe)/human AP3B1 both encode components of the heterotetrameric AP-3 adaptor complex (27Robinson M.S. Bonifacino J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 444-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Mouse pallid (pa), muted (mu), and cappuccino (cno) encode components of a novel biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex, BLOC-1 (28Falcon-Perez J.M. Starcevic M. Gautam R.

Peters L.L. Blood. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Very recently, we showed that mouse ruby-eye (ru)/human HPS6 and mouse ruby-eye-2 (ru2)/human HPS5 encode components of another novel complex, BLOC-2 (8Zhang Q. Zhao B. Li W. Oiso N. Novak E.K. Rusiniak M.E. Gautam R. Chintala S. O'Brien E.P. Zhang Y. Roe B.A. Elliott R.W. Eicher E.M. Liang P. Kratz C. Legius E. Spritz R.A. O'Sullivan T.N. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Swank R.T. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the HPS1 and HPS4 proteins are components of two additional lysosome-related organellar protein complexes, BLOC-3 and BLOC-4 (Fig. 7), and that cytosolic HPS1 seems to be part of yet another complex, BLOC-5. Absence of HPS4 seems to result in destabilization of HPS1. Similar observations have been made for other HPS-related protein complexes. Steady-state levels of the AP-3 β3A protein are decreased in mocha (Ap3d1-mutant) as well as in pearl (Ap3b1-mutant) mice (15Kantheti P. Qiao X. Diaz M.E. Peden A.A. Meyer G.E. Carkadon S.L.

Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Similarly, steady-state levels of the pallidin protein are reduced in both muted and reduced pigmentation (rp)-mutant mice (28Falcon-Perez J.M. Starcevic M. Gautam R. Dell'Angelica E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28191-28199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We have shown that the HPS1 protein is absent in light-ear (le) as well as pale-ear (ep)-mutant mice (7Suzuki T. Li W. Zhang Q. Karim A. Novak E.K. Sviderskaya E.V. Hill S.P. Bennett D.C. Levin A.V. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Fong C.-T. Castellan C. Miterski B. Swank R.T. Spritz R.A. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, the level of HPS1 protein is not reduced in pearl (pe; Ap3b1-mutant) mice and the levels of the four AP-3 component proteins are not reduced in pale-ear (ep; Hps1-mutant) mice (7Suzuki T. Li W. Zhang Q. Karim A. Novak E.K. Sviderskaya E.V. Hill S.P. Bennett D.C. Levin A.V. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Fong C.-T. Castellan C. Miterski B. Swank R.T. Spritz R.A. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), suggesting that HPS1 is not integrally associated with the AP-3 adaptor complex. BLOC-4 seems to be a discrete HPS1·HPS4-containing module of BLOC-3 that is released by treatment with Tris-HCl. Studies using a yeast two-hybrid system indicate that HPS1 may not interact directly with HPS4, nor with itself, whereas HPS4 does interact with other molecules of HPS4. The relationship between BLOC-3 and BLOC-4, their other components, and the stoichiometry of these components remain to be determined. In the cytosol, HPS1 is contained in another ∼200-kDa complex (23Oh J. Liu Z.-X. Feng G.H. Raposo G. Spritz R.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) that does not contain HPS4 and which thus seems to be distinct from BLOC-4. We tentatively designate this cytosolic HPS1 complex BLOC-5. BLOC-3 is detected in a partially purified cytoplasmic fraction that contains vesicles and organelles. We have previously shown that non-cytosolic HPS1 is principally localized in uncoated small vesicles, vesiculo-tubular structures, and early-stage melanosomes (23Oh J. Liu Z.-X. Feng G.H. Raposo G. Spritz R.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and that HPS4 partially colocalizes with HPS1 in vesicles and organelles (7Suzuki T. Li W. Zhang Q. Karim A. Novak E.K. Sviderskaya E.V. Hill S.P. Bennett D.C. Levin A.V. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Fong C.-T. Castellan C. Miterski B. Swank R.T. Spritz R.A. Nat.

BLOC-3 and its component BLOC-4 thus seem to play a key role in trafficking newly synthesized cargo proteins to nascent lysosome-related cytoplasmic organelles. We thank D.

At pH 4.5, almost all BLA (>90%) associates to negatively charged small unilamellar vesicles. The conformational changes that binding to these bilayers induced on the protein were characterized by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy. Because binding of BLA to negatively charged vesicles is reverted by adjusting the pH back to >6.0, we also investigated the conformation of the membrane-bound protein by NMR-monitored H-D exchange of the backbone amide protons. The conformation adopted by BLA bound to these bilayers resembles a molten globule-like state but the negative ellipticity at 222 nm and the apparent α-helix content of the bound protein senses the changes in the physical properties of the membrane. Binding to bilayers in the gel state appears to correlate with an increased amount of α-helical structure and with a lower extent of integration into the membrane, corresponding to the adsorbed protein, while the opposite is found for BLA bound to vesicles in the liquid-crystalline phase, corresponding to the embedded conformation. A common feature for the membrane-bound conformations of BLA is that the amphipathic helix C (residues 86 to 99) is an important determinant for the adsorption and further integration of the protein into the membrane.

As a part of their functions, some intracellular proteins can reversibly translocate between the cytosol and membrane surfaces, leading to a change in conformation and a consequent variation in activity (1Johnson J.E.

Similarly, extracellular proteins such as apolipoproteins can alternatively exist free in plasma or bound to lipoprotein lipids, in which case a new conformation is induced (5Fisher C.A. Ryan R.O. J.

The membrane-bound form of these amphitropic proteins is adsorbed or partially embedded in the lipidic surfaces. Secreted soluble toxins may be inserted through both leaflets of the membrane and in vitro studies have shown a transient membrane-triggered shift of their conformation that is necessary for their insertion in the membrane (9Lakey J.H.

Among the different factors that modulate the association of proteins with the membrane, the lipid composition seems to be determinant (1Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B. Mol. Membr.

The composition of the lipid bilayer can also act specifically on the conformation of proteins adsorbed or inserted in the membrane (13Kirsch T. Nah H.D. Demuth D.R. Harrison G. Golub E.E. Adams S.L.

BLA binds to galactosyltransferase, promoting glucose binding and facilitating the synthesis of lactose in the lactating mammary gland (17Schanbacher F.L. Ebner K.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 229: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 18Permyakov E.A. Berliner L.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). BLA can also reversibly associate with lipid membranes under specific conditions. Thus, it has been shown that at pH 4.5, calcium-containing BLA binds to negatively charged liposomes and that the binding is reverted by adjusting the pH back to >6.0 (19Bañuelos S. Muga A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29910-29915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The protein only adsorbs to vesicles made of saturated lipids without disrupting the permeability barrier of the bilayer, whereas it adopts a partial embedded (inserted) state upon binding to vesicles of unsaturated lipids (in the liquid-crystalline phase) able to disrupt the bilayer (20Bañuelos S. Muga A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our recent NMR studies have lead to a mechanism for the partial insertion of BLA into negatively charged membranes that includes initial protonation of acidic side chains at the membrane interface, which involves helixes A and C, and a subsequent conformational change in the protein that adopts a molten globule-like state to maximize the interaction between hydrophobic residues in these helixes and the lipid bilayer (21Halskau O. Froystein N.A. Muga A. Martinez A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Svensson et al. (22Svensson M. Sabharwal H. Håkansson A. Mossberg A.K. Lipniunas P.

As yet, the mechanism by which a larger protein as the HAMLET conformer of α-lactalbumin induces apoptosis is unknown, but both a partially unfolded conformation and a specific fatty acid as bound cofactor, oleic acid (18:1), are required for this new function of the protein. Conversion of α-lactalbumin to the apoptosis inducing form is achieved with both the protein derived from human milk whey and with recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli (23Svensson M. Håkansson A. Mossberg A.K. Linse S. Svanborg C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4221-4226Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). It has also been recently found that the permeabilizing effect of HAMLET on the mitochondria with subsequent cytochrome c release, which may lead to activation of the caspase cascade and apoptotic death in transformed cells, is dependent on the oleic acid cofactor of HAMLET (24Kohler C. Gogvadze V. Håkansson A. Svanborg C. Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The specificity of HAMLET for tumor cells leads the attention to the lipids involved in the recognition mechanism. It appears that the membrane composition is different in healthy cells and its corresponding tumor cells (25Hietanen E. Punnonen K. Punnonen R. Auvinen O. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 1965-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26Chajes V. Lanson M. Fetissof F. Lhuillery C. Bougnoux P. Int. J.

In human breast cancer tissue the amount of phospholipid has been measured to be 3.6-fold higher than in non-tumorous breast tissue (25Hietanen E. Punnonen K. Punnonen R. Auvinen O. Carcinogenesis. 1986; 7: 1965-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and tumor cell membranes contain more anionic phospholipids and a different fatty acid composition (29Van Blitterswijk W.J. De Veer G. Krol J.H. Emmelot P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 688: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Moreover, although the negatively charged phospholipids of the plasma membrane are usually segregated to the inner leaflet (30Cullis P.R. Hope M.J. Vance D.E. Vance J. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. 20. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1991: 1-41Google Scholar), the earliest sign of apoptosis is translocation of phosphatidylserine (PS) from the inner to the outer leaflet (31Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4607) Google Scholar). To further investigate the conformational changes accompanying the binding of α-lactalbumin to membranes, we have studied the interaction of BLA with liposomes of different composition. The conformation of the membrane-bound states of the protein was investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD), and 1H NMR. The interaction of BLA with the membrane seems to be mostly modulated by the nature, physical state, and charge of the major lipid components of the membranes, the glycerophospholipids (20Bañuelos S. Muga A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this study we have studied the interaction of BLA with liposomes made of different molecular forms of PS alone or equimolar mixtures of these lipids and egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (EYPC), thus with bilayers of different fluidity and charge density. Most of the previous studies on the interaction of BLA with model membranes have used liposomes containing negatively charged dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG), although this phospholipid generally contributes to less than 1% to the total animal cellular phospholipids, except for the 2–5% found in lungs (30Cullis P.R. Hope M.J. Vance D.E. Vance J. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. 20. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1991: 1-41Google Scholar). Our results with the more relevant PS are compared with previous results obtained with mixtures of EYPC and DOPG. Materials—1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phospho-l-serine) (DSPS), 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phospho-l-serine) (SOPS), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phospho-l-serine) (POPS) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). EYPC, 1,2-dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG), and bovine α-lactalbumin type III (holo-protein, calcium-saturated) were from Sigma. Deuterium oxide (99.9%) was from ICN Biomedicals Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). Fura-2 was from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Preparation of Unilamellar Lipid Vesicles—The lipids were dissolved in chloroform and mixed in a round-bottom glass flask to the desired proportions. The solvent was evaporated and the lipids freeze-dried overnight. The dried films were then dispersed in 20 mm citric acid/Na2HPO4, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 4.5, by gently mixing and small unilamellar vesicles (SUV), also referred to as liposomes in the text, were then prepared in a bath sonicator (Branson 1200, Bransonic, CT), operating at a nominal frequency of 20 kHz during 60–90 min at 4 °C. The temperature was maintained by continuous exchange of the chilled water. A highly homogeneous vesicle preparation with a diameter of 40 nm was obtained, as seen by electron microscopy and quasi-elastic light scattering using a Malvern Zetasizer (Malvern, United Kingdom). Electron microscopy revealed that SUV were unilamellar. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) (∼1 μm diameter) were prepared by extrusion as described (32Nerdal W. Gundersen S.A. Thorsen V. Hoiland H. Holmsen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1464: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Binding of α-Lactalbumin to Liposomes by Ultracentrifugation—Protein solutions (7 μm) and liposomes were mixed in 1 ml of 20 mm citric acid/Na2HPO4, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 4.5–6.0, at the indicated lipid:protein ratios. Samples were allowed to equilibrate for 30 min at room temperature and were then centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration in the supernatant was determined spectrophotometrically, using the extinction coefficients of 28,500 m–1 cm–1 at 280 nm, pH 7.0 (33Ewbank J.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3694-3707Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To account for the sedimentation of the free protein, samples containing the same protein concentration in the absence of liposomes were treated and centrifuged under the same experimental conditions. Determination of Free Calcium Content—Calcium concentration was measured using the Ca2+ indicator fura-2 (34Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using a LS-50B PerkinElmer luminescence spectrometer, according to the product information manual from the manufacturer of fura-2 (Molecular Probes) and references therein. Calcium was measured in samples of BLA (0.1 mm) prepared in 20 mm citric acid/Na2HPO4, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 4.5 and 6.0, both in the presence and the absence of liposomes composed of EYPC: DOPG (1:1) and EYPC:SOPS (1:1) (7 mm phospholipid). Calcium was also measured after adjusting the pH of the samples to 6.0 in membrane-free protein fractions and in both membrane- and protein-free fractions prepared by ultrafiltration in Centricon 3 microconcentrators (Amicon) using 1 μm fura-2. Differential Scanning Calorimetry—Measurements were performed on a MicroCal VP-DSC differential scanning calorimeter (MicroCal, Inc.) with cell volumes of 0.5 ml at a scan rate of 60 °C/h. All buffer solutions were degassed under vacuum prior to use. Calorimetric cells were kept under an excess pressure of 207 kPa to prevent degassing during the scan. SUV (5 mm in phospholipid) prepared in a 20 mm citric acid/Na2HPO4, 0.1 m NaCl buffer, at the indicated pH, were used, and thermograms of buffer served as reference. When indicated, BLA was present at a concentration of 50–70 μm. Determination of the transition temperature (TC) and the half-widths of the transitions (TC½) was performed by curve fitting with the Origin TM software (MicroCal, Inc.). Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Fluorescence measurements were performed at 25 °C with a PerkinElmer luminescence spectrometer LS-50B with temperature regulation using quartz cuvettes with a light path of 5 mm. Samples contained 1 μm BLA in 20 mm citric acid/Na2HPO4, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 4.5 to 6.0, in the presence or absence of liposomes (300 μm in lipid). The fluorescence emission spectra of the protein were recorded in the 310–500 nm range with excitation at 295 nm using 3- and 5-nm band widths in the excitation and emission pathways, respectively. Protein-free blanks with and without liposomes of identical concentration and composition were subtracted. When indicated, the pH of the sample was adjusted from pH 4.5 to 6.0 by the addition of NaOH and incubation up to 30 min at 25 °C. Circular Dichroism (CD)—CD measurements were performed with a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a PTC-348WI Peltier element for temperature control using quartz cells with path lengths of 1 mm. Samples contained 12.7 μm BLA in 20 mm citric acid/Na2HPO4, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 4.5 to 6.0, in the presence and absence of liposomes (882 μm in lipid) at the indicated temperature. Four consecutive wavelength scans between 195 and 260 nm were recorded for each CD spectrum and buffer blanks were subtracted. Protein thermal denaturation was monitored by following the changes in ellipticity at 222 nm, with a scan rate of 1 °C/min in the 10–95 °C temperature range. Mean residue ellipticity (Θ) was calculated from the formula Θ = ϵ/(10Cnl), where ϵ is the ellipticity (millidegrees), l is the path of the cuvette (cm), C is the protein concentration (mol/liter), and n is the number of amino acid residues in the protein (123 for BLA). Analysis of the data and determination of midpoint denaturation temperatures (Tm) of the protein were performed using the Standard Analysis program provided with the instrument. The amount of secondary structure elements was estimated with the CDNN program that applies a neural network procedure (35Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange and NMR Spectroscopy—Samples of BLA (1 mm final concentration, 550 μl) were prepared in 99.9% D2O-containing 20 mm citric acid/Na2HPO4, 0.1 m NaCl, pD 4.5, in the absence and presence of liposomes of different phospholipid composition to give a final lipid:protein molar ratio of 70. Total binding of the protein was controlled by ultracentrifugation and by the increase in fluorescence emission intensity (see above). Protons of BLA were then allowed to exchange with deuterium by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, together with a reference sample that was prepared in the same buffer but in the absence of SUV. The pD was then adjusted to pD 6.0 by adding NaOH to release the protein from the membrane and NMR spectra were acquired. All NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker DRX 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with pulsed field gradient accessories. Band-selective homonuclear decoupled TOCSY (BASHD-TOCSY) experiments (36Krishnamurthy V.V. Magn. Reson. Chem. 1997; 35: 9-12Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar) were performed at a probe temperature of 308 K, to diminish adverse effects from high viscosity in the samples with liposomes. The spectra were acquired with a spectral width of 2.1 ppm in the evolution dimension (F1) and 14.985 ppm in the acquisition dimension (F2). The strength of the Gaussian cascade Q3 pulse was calibrated by setting its integral equal to a conventional hard π-pulse. The frequency offset of the soft pulse was adjusted to be [4.55-νwater]·600.13 Hz, where νwater is the water resonance frequency in ppm and 4.55 is the center of the excitation profile in the F1 dimension. The pulse program contained water suppression using pulse sculpting (37Hwang T.-L. Shaka A.J. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. A. 1995; 112: 275-279Crossref Scopus (1565) Google Scholar) and the “W5” modification of the 3-9-19 “Watergate” sequence (38Liu M. Mao X. Ye C. Huang H. Nicholson J.K. Lindon J.C. J. Magn. Res. 1998; 132: 125-129Crossref Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The number of scans was 96 and the time domain in F2 and F1 were 2048 and 32 complex points, respectively. Mixing time for the spin-lock field was set to 40 ms, the strength of the DIPSI-2 spin lock field was ≈6 kHz, and the recycling delay was set to 1.0 s. This set-up yielded an experimental time of 1 h and 8 min. Spectra processing was performed using the Xwinnmr (Bruker) software and volume of the cross-peaks in each of the BASHDTOCSY spectra was measured using Sparky 3.95 (39Goddard, T. D., and Kneller, D. G. (1999) SPARKY 3, University of California, San Francisco, CA www.cgl.ucsf.edu/home/sparky/)Google Scholar) by the sum over ellipsoid method. The resulting integrals of the αH-NH cross-peaks were divided by the volume of the non-exchanging cross-peak assigned to W26 H6–H7. Fluorescence and Differential Scanning Calorimetry Measurements—The pH-controlled reversible interaction of BLA with negatively charged liposomes of EYPC:DOPG (1:1) has been characterized by several spectroscopic techniques, including fluorescence spectroscopy (19Bañuelos S. Muga A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29910-29915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). BLA free in solution shows an intrinsic fluorescence emission spectrum with λmax at about 330–331 nm both at pH 4.5 and 6.0 (Fig. 1) and on binding to liposomes of EYPC:DOPG at pH 4.5, the fluorescence intensity increases and the λmax red shifts to 339–340 nm (19Bañuelos S. Muga A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29910-29915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). These changes have been interpreted as being the result of the transition of at least one of its four Trp residues to a more polar environment and the disappearance of tertiary interactions that quench the fluorescence in the native state (19Bañuelos S. Muga A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29910-29915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). No spectral changes occur when liposomes (either LUVs or SUVs) of EYPC:DOPG are added to BLA at pH 6.0 and additional methods, such as ultracentrifugation, have corroborated that no binding takes place at this pH (19Bañuelos S. Muga A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29910-29915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21Halskau O. Froystein N.A. Muga A. Martinez A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Incubation of the protein with SUVs at protein:lipid molar ratios ranging from 1:70 to 1:300 at pH 4.5 and 37 °C, and consequent ultracentrifugation of the samples, reveals that almost all BLA (>90%) associates to SUV made of EYPC:DOPG, EYPC:SOPS, EYPC: POPS, and EYPC:DSPS. Full binding of BLA was also measured after incubation with the same lipid bilayers at 25 °C, except for those composed of EYPC:DSPS, for which no binding was observed at this temperature. Liposomes (either LUVs or SUVs) of EYPC alone do not affect the emission fluorescence of BLA at either pH (Fig. 1). A red-shift and an increase in fluorescence intensity are also observed on binding of BLA to liposomes of EYPC:SOPS and EYPC:POPS, whereas a blue shift was observed for the interaction of the protein with liposomes of EYPC:DSPS at 37 °C (Fig. 1 and Table I).Table IIntrinsic fluorescence parameters for BLA bound to SUV of different lipid compositionsLipid compositionλmaxIF25 °C37 °C25 °C37 °CnmEYPC:DOPG339.0339.075.075.1EYPC:SOPS338.5338.553.052.3EYPC:POPS340.0339.534.934.5EYPC:DSPS336.0328.020.467.0No bilayer (BLA alone)331.0332.516.714.4 Open table in a new tab To check the thermotropic properties of these samples they were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry, and in Table II we have summarized the gel to liquid crystalline phase transition temperatures (TC) of the bilayers. It should be mentioned that we focused on the characterization of SUVs because the advantageous use of these liposomes over LUV in the spectroscopic experiments, where higher lipid concentrations are required, has been discussed elsewhere (21Halskau O. Froystein N.A. Muga A. Martinez A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The values of TC obtained by differential scanning calorimetry for SUV containing pure PS species are consistent with data for the gel to liquid crystalline phase transition for LUV and MLV of the same phospholipids found in the LIPIDAT data base (40Caffrey M. Hogan J. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1992; 61: 1-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The TC values for the mixtures of EYPC and different molecular species of PS in the absence of BLA are lower than for the pure PS species (Table II). The analysis of the pH dependence of TC, sensitive to the degree of ionization, the surface charge density, and the fluidity (41van Dijck P.W. de Kruijff B. Verkleij A.J. van Deenen L.L. de Gier J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 512: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 42Phillips M.C. Ladbrooke B.D. Chapman D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 196: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), indicates that the PS species used in this study are negatively charged in the pH 4.5–6 range.Table IITemperature for the gel to liquid crystalline phase transition (TC) and half-width (TC½) of the transition obtained by differential scanning calorimetry for the SUV preparations studiedSampleNo BLABLA (60 μM)TCTC½TCTC½°C°CSOPS26.7 ± 0.76.8 ± 0.528.0 ± 0.66.9 ± 1.5EYPC:SOPS8.3 ± 0.515.8 ± 0.619.9 ± 0.816.7 ± 1.9POPS12.1 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.118.6 ± 0.10.9 ± 0.2EYPC:POPS4.1 ± 0.89.5 ± 0.715.1 ± 0.27.2 ± 0.5DSPSaNo apparent binding of the protein as measured by ultracentrifugation or other methods.67.6 ± 0.21.2 ± 0.269.0aNo apparent binding of the protein as measured by ultracentrifugation or other methods.1.7aNo apparent binding of the protein as measured by ultracentrifugation or other methods.EYPC:DSPS51.6 ± 0.112.9 ± 0.341.1 ± 0.210.5 ± 0.7a No apparent binding of the protein as measured by ultracentrifugation or other methods. Open table in a new tab When the pH was increased from 4.5 to 6.0, the fluorescence spectrum of BLA in the presence of liposomes essentially reverted to that for free BLA (Ref. 21Halskau O. Froystein N.A. Muga A. Martinez A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, Fig. 1, and data not shown), in accordance with the release of the protein from the bilayer. Measurement of the calcium content in solutions of BLA bound to liposomes of EYPC:DOPG and EYPC:SOPS at a lipid:protein molar ratio of 300:1 at pH 4.5 using the fluorescence properties of fura-2 (34Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) showed that no calcium ion is released to the medium from the protein on binding to the bilayer, indicating that membrane-bound BLA most probably remains as holoenzyme. Moreover, BLA released from the membrane by the pH shift to pH 6.0 appears to be recovered largely (80%) as holoenzyme. The Association of BLA with Liposomes of Different Compositions Studied by CD—The far-ultraviolet spectrum of free BLA shows two minima at 208 and 222 nm, characteristic of proteins with large content of α-helical structure (Ref. 19Bañuelos S. Muga A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29910-29915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar and Fig. 2A). The content of α-helix and β-extended structures in BLA estimated from the CD spectrum was 27 and 10%, respectively, in agreement with the content estimated from the crystal structure (43Pike A.C. Brew K. Acharya K.R. Structure. 1996; 4: 691-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In the presence of liposomes of EYPC:DOPG, EYPC:SOPS, EYPC:POPS, and EYPC:DSPS at pH 4.5 and 10 °C, an increase was observed in the ellipticity of BLA (Fig. 2A), corresponding to larger apparent α-helix content than in free BLA (Table III). When the CD spectra were acquired at 37 °C, the negative ellipticity at 222 nm of BLA and the appar"

A consensus binding sequence (5′-TGTCG(C/T)GA(C/T)A) for hDREF/KIAA0785, determined by the CASTing method, overlapped with that for the Drosophila DREF (5′-TGTCGATA). We found hDREF/KIAA0785 binding sequences in the promoter regions of human genes related to cell proliferation. Analyses using a specific antibody revealed that an hDREF/KIAA0785 binds to the promoter region of the histone H1 gene. Co-transfection experiments with an hDREF/KIAA0785-expressing plasmid and a histone H1 promoter-directed luciferase reporter plasmid in HeLa cells revealed possible activation of the histone H1 promoter. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that hDREF/KIAA0785 is localized in the nuclei. Although the expression level of the factor was found to be low in serum-deprived human normal fibroblasts, the amount was increased by adding serum to cultures and reached a maximum during S phase. RNA interference experiments targeting hDREF/KIAA0785 resulted in inhibition of S phase entry and reduction of histone H1 mRNA in HeLa cells. These results suggest that expression of hDREF/KIAA0785 may have a role in regulation of human genes related to cell proliferation.

We found a specific DREF (DRE-binding factor) consisting of an 80-kDa polypeptide homodimer, and molecular cloning of its cDNA has allowed confirmation that DREF is a trans-activator for DRE-containing genes (8Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Kuroda K. Omori A. Hachiya T. Ikeda M. Nishimoto Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3930-3937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). An important role of the DRE/DREF regulatory system has been indicated by the finding that DRE/DREF is a target of some differentiation signals. The zen (zerknullt) gene encoding a homeodomain-containing protein, Zen, which is expressed in the dorsal region of the early embryo at the cellular blastoderm stage, is involved in differentiation of the amnioserosa and the optic lobe (9Doyle H.J. Kraut R. Levine M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1518-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Zen expression in cultured cells results in repression of DRE-containing genes by reducing the DREF activity (10Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2937-2942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the DRE/DREF system may occupy a cross-road position in growth and differentiation signaling pathways. Recently, Hart et al. (11Hart C.M. Zhao K. Laemmli U.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 999-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 12Hart C.M. Cuvier O. Laemmli U.K. Chromosoma. 1999; 108: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) proposed a novel function of DREF as an antagonist of the boundary element-associated factor (BEAF), which is involved in the boundary activity of the scs′ region of the Drosophila 87A7 hsp70 gene (5Royzman I. Whittaker A.J. Orr-Weaver T.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1999-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 11Hart C.M. Zhao K. Laemmli U.K. Mol. Cell.

Staining of polytene chromosomes with anti-DREF and anti-BEAF antibodies revealed about 50% of signals for the two proteins to overlap. Furthermore, using a chromatin precipitation method, they demonstrated that DREF could bind to the same sequences as BEAF. From these results, they hypothesized that competition of binding between DREF and BEAF is important for the regulation of activity at the chromatin boundary. More recently, we have established transgenic flies, in which ectopic expression of DREF was targeted to the eye imaginal discs (13Takahashi Y. Hirose F. Matsukage A. Yamaguchi M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 510-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Adult flies expressing DREF exhibited a severe rough eye phenotype. We found that this was significantly suppressed by a half-dose reduction of any of the trithorax-group genes, brahma (14Elfring L.K. Daniel C. Papoulas O. Deuring R. Sarte M. Moseley S. Beek S.J.

Matsukage M. Yamaguchi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7231-7242Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These results suggest a possibility that DREF activity is regulated by protein complexes that play a role in determining chromatin structure (for example, establishment, maintenance, or cancellation of the chromatin boundary) such as those involving BEAF (5Royzman I.

Dev. 2002; 12: 210-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Despite its obvious potential importance, identification of a mammalian DRE/DREF system has not yet been achieved. To obtain clues for cDNA cloning of mammalian DREF, we isolated a gene for DREF from Drosophila virilis (13Takahashi Y. Hirose F. Matsukage A. Yamaguchi M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 510-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and determined highly conserved regions in DREFs of this species and Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) (8Hirose F.

Comparison of deduced amino acid sequences for the two species allowed us to identify three highly conserved regions, CR1, CR2, and CR3 (13Takahashi Y. Hirose F. Matsukage A. Yamaguchi M.

Suyama M. Kikuno R. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Comparison of amino acid sequences of KIAA0785 protein and the two Drosophila DREFs revealed obvious conservation of CR1, CR2, and CR3. In the present study, we characterized KIAA0785 protein as a human homologue of DREF (hDREF) and demonstrated sequence-specific DNA binding activity and fluctuation of expression during the cell cycle. Furthermore, we found that hDREF/KIAA0785 binds to the promoter region of the histone H1 gene and stimulates its promoter activity. Cell Culture—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Primary human embryonic lung fibroblast (HEL) cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. For synchronization, exponentially growing HEL cells were starved of serum for 72 h prior to addition of fresh medium with 10% fetal calf serum.

Regions corresponding to the 10-bp binding core sequence for hDREF/KIAA0785 are shown in bold letters, with nucleotides substituted for the wild-type sequence in lowercase with underlining. PCR primers (primer F, 5′-GCTGCAGTTGCACTGAATTCGCCTC; primer R, 5′-CAGGTCAGTTCAGCGGATCCTGTCG) and an oligonucleotide carrying defined ends and a 26-nucleotide region of degeneracy (R76, 5′-CAGGTCAGTTCAGCGGATCCTGTCG-(N)26-GAGGCGAATTCAGTGCAACTGCAGC) were synthesized and used for the CASTing experiments. A full-length cDNA for hDREF/KIAA0785 was generated by PCR using primers hDREF5′, 5′-GGAgctagcATGGAGAATAAAAGCCTGGAG, and hDREF3′, 5′-GCTctcgagCTACAGGAAGCTGCTGTCCCT.

Plasmid Construction—KIAA0785 cDNA/pBluescript ks(–) was obtained from Kazusa DNA Research Institute (20Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Suyama M. Kikuno R. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and used as a PCR template to generate a full-length cDNA for hDREF/KIAA0785. The obtained cDNA was blunt-ended with a DNA blunting kit (Takara) and inserted into the SmaI site of pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) to create pGST-hDREF/KIAA0785. A plasmid expressing hDREF/KIAA0785 was constructed by amplifying the full-length cDNA of hDREF/KIAA0785 by the PCR method using KIAA0785 cDNA/pBluescript ks(–) as a template, cutting with NheI and XhoI and inserting into the NheI-XhoI site of pcDNA3-HA. To construct the expression plasmid CR1hDREF/KIAA0785/pcDNA3-HA, cDNA encoding the CR1 region (1–140 amino acid residue) of hDREF/KIAA0785 was amplified by PCR and inserted into the blunt-ended XhoI site of pcDNA3-HA. The H1-p/pGL3 reporter plasmid was constructed as follows. The promoter region (–537 to –1) of the human histone H1 gene (21van Wijnen A.J. Wright K.L. Massung R.F. Gerretsen M. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 571-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA from HeLa cells as template, cut with NheI and XhoI, and inserted into the NheI-XhoI site of pGL3 promoter vector (Promega), which contains the SV40 promoter placed upstream of the firefly luciferase gene. Then, the SV40 promoter was removed by cutting with HindIII and BglII. The obtained DNA fragment was blunt-ended with a DNA blunting kit (Takara) and self-ligated. All plasmids were propagated in Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue, isolated by standard procedures (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and further purified using a Qiagen Plasmid Midi kit (Qiagen Inc.). Expression of GST Fusion Proteins—Expression and purification of GST-hDREF/KIAA0785 fusion proteins in E. coli XL-1 Blue were carried out as described elsewhere (8Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Kuroda K. Omori A. Hachiya T. Ikeda M. Nishimoto Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3930-3937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Lysates of cells were prepared by sonication in Buffer D containing 0.6 m KCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin, and cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C before application to a glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column to purify the GST-hDREF/KIAA0785 fusion protein. Control GST protein was expressed and purified in the same way. Antibody—The purified GST-hDREF/KIAA0785 fusion protein was used to elicit polyclonal antibody production in a rabbit. Polyclonal antibodies reacting with GST-hDREF/KIAA0785 were purified by sequential passage through affinity resin covalently conjugated with GST or GST-hDREF/KIAA0785. Immunoblotting—Polypeptides in E. coli cell extracts or total cell extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in a solution containing 50 mm borate-NaOH buffer (pH 9.0) and 20% methanol at 4 °C for 16 h. Membranes were blocked with TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3) and 150 mm NaCl) containing 10% skim milk for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with the rabbit anti-hDREF/KIAA0785 polyclonal antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing with TBS, membranes were incubated with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (used at a dilution of 1:2,000) (Promega) for 1 h at room temperature. After further extensive washing with TBS, color was developed in a solution containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.34 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium salt, and 0.175 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoryl phosphate toluidinium salt. Cell Cycle Analysis with Flow Cytometry—Cells were harvested by trypsinization, and the nuclei were stained with propidium iodide using a CycleTest kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Analysis was with a FACScan (BD Biosciences), and the percentages in each phase were calculated with the SOBR model in the CELFIT program. Analysis of the Cellular Localization of hDREF/KIAA0785—Triton X-100-extracted nuclei were prepared as follows. HeLa cells cultured in 100-mm plates were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed for 10 min on ice with 1 ml of ice-cold CSK buffer (10 mm Pipes (pH 6.8), 150 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) (24Blencowe B.J. Nickerson J.A. Issner R. Penman S. Sharp P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 593-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) containing proteinase inhibitors and 0.5% Triton X-100. After low speed centrifugation (3,000 rpm, 3 min at 4 °C), the nuclei were once more extracted with 1 ml of ice-cold CSK buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100. DNase I digestion of Triton X-100-treated nuclei was performed as follows. Triton X-100-extracted nucleus suspension was prepared as described above. The samples (100 μl) were supplemented with 1 mm ATP and 1,000 units/ml DNase I, followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature. To examine the extent of hDREF/KIAA0785 solubilization by salt, Triton X-100-treated nuclei (100 μl) were suspended in CSK containing NaCl at concentrations of 0.15, 0.35, or 0.55 m, followed by incubation for 1 h on ice. The pellet fractions and supernatants were then separated by low speed centrifugation, the former being resuspended in 100 μl of the buffer, and the latter was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 rpm for 15 min using a Beckman TLA100.1 rotor. The samples were then added to the same volumes of 2× SDS sample buffer (1× solution (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue)), boiled, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Immunofluorescence Analysis—Cells grown on 13-mm coverglasses were fixed for 20 min in 100% methanol at –20 °C and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 min. All staining procedures were carried out at room temperature. The samples were incubated with either anti-hDREF/KIAA0785 IgG or normal rabbit IgG at a 1:400 dilution in PBS with 10% normal goat serum for 1 h. After washing three times with PBS, the samples were reacted with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Molecular Probes) at a 1:400 dilution in PBS with 10% normal goat serum for 1 h. After washing a further three times with PBS, the samples were mounted and analyzed by conventional microscopy. Selection of hDREF/KIAA0785 Binding Sites with CASTing Experiments—A 32P-labeled double-stranded degenerate oligonucleotide was prepared by incubating 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 μm each of dATP, dGTP, and dTTP, 20 μm [α-32P]dCTP (740 kBq), 100 μm each of primers F and R76 oligonucleotide, and 2 units of the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I at 37 °C for 1 h. Binding reactions were performed by adding GST-hDREF/KIAA0785 (0.4 μg) to Buffer D (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 120 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Tween 80, and 12% glycerol) containing 400 ng of poly(dI-dC), 400 ng of sonicated salmon sperm DNA, 50 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 32P-labeled double-stranded degenerate oligonucleotide (1.8 ng) and incubating at 4 °C for 30 min. Then, glutathione-Sepharose beads (10 μl) were added with incubation at 4 °C for an additional 1 h. The DNA-protein complexes were then precipitated by centrifugation, and the pellets were washed six times with Buffer D. After elution with 100 μl of Buffer D containing 5 mm reduced glutathione, the oligonucleotides were recovered by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation and amplified by PCR in 20 μl of a mixture containing 300 ng of primers F and R, 20 μm [α-32P]dCTP (740 kBq), 50 μm each of dATP, dGTP, and dTTP, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.5 unit of Taq polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). DNAs were amplified by 20 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, purified by passage through a Sephacryl-200 spin column, precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in 50 μl of a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm EDTA. The amount of amplified oligonucleotide was quantified, and a portion corresponding to 2 ng was used in subsequent CASTing cycles. After five cycles of CASTing, the radiolabeled oligonucleotides (1.5 × 105 cpm) were used as probes in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Oligonucleotides binding to GST-hDREF/KIAA0785 were excised from gels, eluted overnight in 0.2 ml of a solution containing 0.2 m NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, and 0.1% SDS at 37 °C, extracted once with phenol, and then precipitated with ethanol. DNAs were amplified by PCR as described above, digested with EcoRI and BamHI, and then subcloned into EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pBluescript vector. Nucleotide sequences of 50 independent clones were determined. Preparation of HeLa Cell Nuclear Extract—A nuclear extract was prepared by a modified Dignam method (25Dignam J.D. Levovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Cultured HeLa cells in suspension were collected by centrifugation and washed with PBS. Two packed volumes of Buffer A containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2,10mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, and proteinase inhibitor mixture (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.75 μg/ml aprotinin) were added to swell the cells on ice for 10 min. A Dounce homogenizer (size B) was then used to rupture the cell membranes, and nuclei were collected at 1,600 × g at 4 °C and resuspended in high salt Buffer B containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and the proteinase inhibitor mixture to extract nuclear proteins by rocking at 4 °C for 1 h before centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was dialyzed in Buffer C (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20% glycerol), clarified by centrifugation, and stored at –80 °C in small aliquots. The protein concentration of the extract was 4.8 mg/ml. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—EMSA were performed as described earlier (1Hirose F. Yamaguchi M. Handa H. Inomata Y. Matsukage A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2092-2099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with minor modifications. A reaction mixture containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 150 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, and 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA was used with purified GST-hDREF/KIAA0785. Another reaction mixture containing 15 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 120 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 2% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) DNA was employed for EMSA with the HeLa cell nuclear extracts. 32P-Labeled probes (10,000 cpm) were incubated in 15 μl of reaction mixture. When necessary, unlabeled DNA fragments were added as competitors at this step. Then, GST-hDREF/KIAA0785 fusion proteins (20 ng) or aliquots of the HeLa cell nuclear extract (5 μg protein) were added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min on ice. In experiments with antibodies, the HeLa cell nuclear extract was preincubated with the antibody for 1 h on ice. DNA-protein complexes were electrophoretically resolved on 4% polyacrylamide gels in 100 mm Tris-borate (pH 8.3), 2 mm EDTA containing 2.5% glycerol at 25 °C. The gels were dried and then autoradiographed. DNA Transfection into Cells and Luciferase Assays—HeLa cells were plated at about 6 × 104 cells per well in 24-well culture plates for 16 h. 100 ng of firefly luciferase reporter plasmid and 10 ng of pRL-TK plasmid (Promega), carrying sea pansy luciferase under the control of the herpes simplex virus tk gene promoter as an internal control, were co-transfected into cells using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) (26Jain V.K. Magrath I.T. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In the co-transfection experiment with the expression plasmid, reporter plasmids were co-transfected with hDREF/KIAA0785/pcDNA3-HA or CR1hDREF/KIAA0785/pcDNA3-HA with pRL-TK as an internal control. The total amount of expression plasmid was adjusted to 410 ng by addition of pcDNA3-HA. After DNA transfection, cells were cultured for 48 h, and luciferase activity was measured with a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to sea pansy luciferase activity. Transfections were performed several times with at least three independent plasmid preparations. RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc.), and 250 ng of total RNA was subjected to RT-PCR analyses using a high fidelity RNA PCR kit (Takara). The cDNAs were generated using random 9-mers as primers. The PCR condition was 45–50 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 53 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min using 5′-H1 and 3′-H1 as primers. All the PCR were performed within the range of linear amplification. The PCR products were electrophoretically separated in a 2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and quantified using ImageMaster VDS-CL (Amersham Biosciences). siRNA Transfection—siRNAs (short interfering double-stranded RNAs) against hDREF/KIAA0785 were chemically synthesized by Dharmacon Research, Inc. The sequences for hDREFsiRNA1 and hDREFsiRNA2 correspond to regions +221 to +241 and +132 to +152 with respect to the translational start codon, respectively. Scramble siRNA (Dharmacon Research, Inc.) was used as a negative control. siRNAs were transfected into 30% confluent HeLa cells using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) (27Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8184) Google Scholar), and cells were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C. 5-Bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) Labeling—HeLa cells were incubated in the presence of 20 μg/ml BrdUrd (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h. The samples were fixed in methanol for 1 h at –20 °C and further fixed in 80% ethanol-50 mm glycine buffer (pH 2.0) at –20 °C for 2 h. Incorporated BrdUrd was visualized using an anti-BrdUrd antibody and an alkaline phosphatase detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The time of color development for alkaline phosphatase was precisely regulated to be identical for all samples. Comparison of Amino Acid Sequences between hDREF/KIAA0785 and Drosophila DREF—Previously, we isolated genes for DREFs from D. melanogaster (DmDREF; 709 amino acids) and D. virilis (D. virilis DREF; 742 amino acids) (8Hirose F.

https://openalex.org/W1967238591,"We and others have shown that members of the Ets family of transcription factors are involved in morphogenic properties of endothelial cells in vitro. To investigate the role of these factors in the transcriptional regulation of angiogenesis in vivo, we set up a nontraumatic model that allows daily macroscopic examination of both growth factor- and tumor-induced angiogenesis in mouse ears. In the same animal, we were thus able to record variations in the patterns of neovessels induced and cell populations recruited by the angiogenic factors FGF-2 and VEGF. In this model, inhibition of FGF-2-induced angiogenesis by the pharmacological compound TNP-470 was readily observed, demonstrating that the mouse ear model is also useful in the evaluation of antiangiogenic strategies. Our functional analysis of Ets transcription factors activity utilized a competitor protein, Ets1-DB, a dominant negative Ets1 mutant lacking the transactivation domain. Retrovirus-mediated expression of Ets1-DB inhibited FGF-2-induced angiogenesis, while the expression of Ets1-DB in cancerous and stromal cells disturbed tumor-induced angiogenesis. These results illustrate the value of the ear model and highlight the role of Ets family members in the transcriptional regulation of tumor angiogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2049206325,"Escherichia coli flavohemoglobin (HMP) is shown to be capable of catalyzing the reduction of several alkylhydroperoxide substrates into their corresponding alcohols using NADH as an electron donor. In particular, HMP possesses a high catalytic activity and a low Km toward cumyl, linoleic acid, and tert-butyl hydroperoxides, whereas it is a less efficient hydrogen peroxide scavenger. An analysis of UV-visible spectra during the stationary state reveals that at variance with classical peroxidases, HMP turns over in the ferrous state. In particular, an iron oxygen adduct intermediate whose spectrum is similar to that reported for the oxo-ferryl derivative in peroxidases (Compound II), has been identified during the catalysis of hydrogen peroxide reduction. This finding suggests that hydroperoxide cleavage occurs upon direct binding of a peroxide oxygen atom to the ferrous heme iron. Competitive inhibition of the alkylhydroperoxide reductase activity by carbon monoxide has also been observed, thus confirming that heme iron is directly involved in the catalytic mechanism of hydroperoxide reduction. The alkylhydroperoxide reductase activity taken together with the unique lipid binding properties of HMP suggests that this protein is most likely involved in the repair of the lipid membrane oxidative damage generated during oxidative/nitrosative stress.

The alkylhydroperoxide reductase activity taken together with the unique lipid binding properties of HMP suggests that this protein is most likely involved in the repair of the lipid membrane oxidative damage generated during oxidative/nitrosative stress. “Hemoglobin-like” proteins represent an increasingly growing family of globins whose genes are widespread among prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms (1Wittenberg J.B. Bolognesi M. Wittenberg B.A. Guertin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 871-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 2Poole R.K. Hughes M.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). These proteins are structurally related to vertebrate hemoglobins and myoglobins in that their architecture is based on the typical globin fold and the heme is linked to the polypeptide chain through a proximal histidine residue. Two main classes of hemoglobin-like proteins have been identified, namely single domain bacterial hemoglobins (comprising the so-called truncated hemoglobins) and flavohemoglobins in which the globin domain is fused with a ferredoxin reductase-like FAD and NAD binding module. The “functional annotations” of these proteins are still controversial, and different physiological roles have been proposed that span from simple oxygen delivery to terminal oxidases (facilitated diffusion) to more complex enzymatic activities linked to oxidative and/or nitrosative stress cell responses (1Wittenberg J.B. Bolognesi M. Wittenberg B.A. Guertin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 871-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 2Poole R.K. Hughes M.N. Mol.

The flavohemoglobin from Escherichia coli (HMP) 1The abbreviations used are: HMP, Escherichia coli flavohemoglobin; NO, nitric oxide; GC, gas chromatography; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; ESI, electrospray ionization. has been the object of a large number of investigations to unveil its physiological role in the framework of bacterial resistance to nitrosative stress. HMP expression has been demonstrated to respond to the presence of nitric oxide (NO) in the culture medium, and an explicit mechanism has been proposed that involves NO scavenging and its reduction to N2O under anaerobic conditions (3Cruz-Ramos H. Crack J. Wu G. Hughes M.N. Scott C. Thomson A.J. Green J. Poole R.K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In contrast to (or together with) the anaerobic NO reductase activity, HMP has also been shown to be able to catalyze the oxidation of free NO to nitrate (nitric-oxide dioxygenase activity) both in vivo and in vitro in the presence of oxygen and NADH (4Membrillo-Hernandez J.

Alternatively, an NO denitrosylase function has been proposed in which, at low oxygen tensions, HMP turns over in the ferric state with the intermediacy of an iron-bound nitroxyl anion that is subsequently transformed into nitrate in the presence of oxygen (8Hausladen A. Gow A. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10108-10112Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It remains to be established which of these diverse enzymatic activities correspond to a physiologically relevant process. A second set of functional hypotheses has been inferred on the basis of the structural features of the active site of HMP (9Ilari A. Bonamore A. Farina A. Johnson K.A. Boffi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23723-23725Google Scholar) and other closely related proteins. HMP, similar to the single chain hemoglobin from Vitreoscilla sp. (10Tarricone C. Galizzi A. Coda A. Ascenzi P. Bolognesi M. Structure. 1997; 14: 497-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and the flavohemoglobin from Alcaligenes eutrophus (11Ermler U. Siddiqui R.A. Cramm R. Friedrich B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6067-6077Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), displays a structural geometry of the active site that is strongly reminiscent of that of typical peroxidases. In particular, the x-ray crystal structures of all of the above mentioned proteins show that the proximal heme pocket is characterized by a network of hydrogen-bonding interactions that comprises the Nϵ atom (hydrogen-bonding donor) of the proximal histidine, thus conferring an anionic character to the imidazole ring (9Ilari A. Bonamore A. Farina A. Johnson K.A. Boffi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23723-23725Google Scholar, 11Ermler U. Siddiqui R.A. Cramm R. Friedrich B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6067-6077Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This feature allows a clear cut structural distinction between genuine hemoglobins in which the integrity of the ligand in the trans position needs to be preserved and peroxidases in which electron donation to the trans ligand is at the core of the catalytic activity (electron push effect). The spectroscopic signature of the peroxidase-like character of the active site is provided by resonance Raman measurements on the fully reduced, deoxygenated HMP derivative whose spectrum displays a very high iron histidine-stretching frequency, in line with the values observed for typical peroxidases (12Mukai M. Mills C.E. Poole R.K. Yeh S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7272-7277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Subsequently, FTIR measurements conducted on the cyanide-bound ferric species confirmed the structural analogies between HMP and peroxidases highlighting the strong electron donation to the iron-bound ligand (13Bonamore A. Chiancone E. Boffi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1549: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, an extensive screening of possible peroxidase and/or monooxygenase activities toward a number of typical peroxidase and/or cytochrome P-450 substrates has been unfruitful (14Bonamore A. Farina A. Gattoni M. Schininà M.E. Bellelli A. Boffi A. Biochemistry. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). 2A. Bonamore, P. Gentili, A. Ilari, M. E. Schininà, and A. Boffi, unpublished results. As a matter of fact, ferric HMP appears to be inert toward hydrogen peroxide and displays a complex ligand binding behavior toward typical ferric heme substrates (14Bonamore A. Farina A. Gattoni M. Schininà M.E. Bellelli A. Boffi A. Biochemistry. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Lastly, a number of experimental observations carried out on highly similar bacterial hemoglobins have revealed different possible scenarios. In particular, the presence of a tightly bound phospholipid within the heme pocket of A. eutrophus flavohemoglobin initially suggested the participation of the protein to lipid membrane transport and/or processing (15Ollesch G. Kaunzinger A. Juchelka D. Schubert-Zsilavec M. Ermler U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This finding has been completely overlooked in subsequent investigations until very recently where HMP as well as the single chain bacterial hemoglobin from Vitreoscilla sp. (VHB) and even the truncated hemoglobin from Mycobacterium tubercolosis (HbO) have been reported to be preferentially localized in contact with the bacterial inner membrane and capable of reversible binding to liposomes obtained from bacterial lipid extracts (16Ramandeep Hwang K.W.

Dikshit K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15293-15302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). HMP has also been shown to bind unsaturated and/or cyclopropanated fatty acids with high affinity within the heme pocket (14Bonamore A. Farina A. Gattoni M. Schininà M.E. Bellelli A. Boffi A. Biochemistry. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Along the same line, the three-dimensional structures of the flavohemoglobins from A. eutrophus (FHP) and E. coli and of the single chain hemoglobin from Vitreoscilla sp. (VHB) pointed out that lipid binding contact regions are conserved (9Ilari A. Bonamore A. Farina A. Johnson K.A. Boffi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23723-23725Google Scholar). All together, the ensemble of experimental observations just mentioned provides a puzzling picture whose elucidation might be achieved by merging membrane binding properties with the peroxidase-like character and eventually with the NO-induced expression of HMP. In this work, ferrous HMP has been demonstrated to possess a genuine alkylhydroperoxide reductase activity, thus suggesting that HMP itself and possibly other members of the hemoglobin-like protein family are involved in the reduction of lipid membrane hydroperoxides. HMP has been expressed and purified as reported previously (13Bonamore A. Chiancone E. Boffi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1549: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with an additional chromatographic step on a lipid avid hydroxyalkoxy-propyl dextran resin (Type X, Sigma). The protein solution (8 ml, 40–80 μm) was passed through a 2.2 × 6-cm column containing the hydroxy-alkoxy-propyl resin at 20 °C in 20 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 under a flow rate of 0.05 ml/min. This last chromatographic step ensured complete removal of physiologically bound phospholipids (14Bonamore A. Farina A. Gattoni M. Schininà M.E. Bellelli A. Boffi A. Biochemistry. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ollesch G. Kaunzinger A. Juchelka D. Schubert-Zsilavec M. Ermler U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured spectrophotometrically using the molar absorptivity at 421 nm of 156,000 m–1 cm–1 for the ferric cyanide adduct. Kinetic measurements were carried out by mixing anaerobic protein solutions containing 250 mm NADH and 1 mm EDTA with solutions containing different concentrations of tert-butyl, cumyl, linoleic acid hydroperoxides (13(S)-hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid), or hydrogen peroxide (Sigma) in an Applied Photophysics rapid mixing apparatus equipped with a diode array device (Leatherhead, United Kingdom). Stock solutions of tert-butyl, cumyl, and linoleic acid hydroperoxide were prepared in 50% water/ethanol mixtures, degassed in a tonometer, and kept at 4 °C in the dark before use. Solutions containing HMP and NADH and solution containing hydroperoxides were accurately degassed in a tonometer and anaerobically transferred to stopped-flow syringes. The syringes containing HMP and NADH were allowed to stand for 5 min before mixing to ensure the consumption of residual oxygen. Double mixing experiments were also carried out in the same stopped-flow apparatus. NADH (250 μm) reduced HMP (8 μm) was first mixed with H2O2 in the pre-mixing chamber, and after a 2-s delay, it was mixed with 20–1000 μm CO (oxygen-free) solutions. Alternatively, slower kinetic time courses at low protein concentrations (below 1 μm) were carried out by mixing the NADH-reduced protein with the alkylhydroperoxide solutions directly in a tonometer equipped with a 1-cm quartz cuvette and a side arm reservoir. In CO inhibition experiments, a few microliters of a CO gas-saturated solution were added to the tonometer with a microsyringe and equilibrated for 20 min with the aqueous phase before adding the substrate to yield an equilibrium CO concentration of 1–20 μm. Time courses were followed at 340 nm (absorption maximum of NADH) on a Jasco V-570 spectrophotometer. All of the experiments were carried out in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm EDTA at 25 °C. In the case of linoleic acid hydroperoxide, reaction kinetics were carried out in the presence of either 0.1% Triton X-100 or 20% v/v ethanol/water mixture. A complete quantitative analysis of the reaction product was carried out for cumyl hydroperoxide. A 5-ml solution containing 5 μm HMP, 5 mm NADH, and 2.2 mm cumyl hydroperoxide in 0.1 m phosphate buffer was equilibrated under nitrogen for 1 h at 25 °C. A protein-free blank was also prepared under the same conditions. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 5 ml of ethyl acetate, and the organic phase was recovered and split in two aliquots. The first sample was dried under vacuum and resuspended in methanol for HPLC analysis, and the second sample was directly used for GC analysis. In both HPLC and GC analyses, 2 mm benzyl alcohol was used as an internal standard to quantify the cumyl hydroperoxide reaction products. The methanol solutions (blank and sample) were injected onto an Agilent 1100 Series HPLC system equipped with a Supelcosil LC-18DB (25 cm × 2 μm) reverse phase HPLC column. The products were eluted with 30% v/v methanol/water solution at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and monitored at 256 nm. Product elution peaks were identified by comparison with authentic standards under identical elution conditions. GC analysis was carried out using a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatographic apparatus equipped with a CP-Sil 5 CB column (30 cm × 0.25 mm). For ESI mass spectrometry measurements, linoleic acid hydroperoxide or its reaction products were extracted as follows. The reaction mixture (1 ml) containing 2 μm HMP in 0.1 m phosphate, pH 7.0, and 1 mm EDTA and 20% v/v ethanol, 140 μm linoleic acid hydroperoxide, and 500 μm NADH was allowed to stand 15 min under a nitrogen gas atmosphere at 25 °C. At the end of the reaction, the solution was treated with 2 ml of ethyl acetate, vortexed, and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 15 min. Two blank solutions were prepared in which either NADH or HMP was omitted. The ethyl acetate extracts were dried under vacuum and resuspended in 80% ethanol/water containing 0.5% v/v ammonia. The ethanolic solutions were analyzed by infusion (5 μl/min) in an electrospray ion trap mass spectrometer (model LCQ, ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA). Linoleic hydroperoxide standards dissolved in the same solvent were used to optimize the ESI source parameters. The mass spectra were collected over the mass range of 70–700 a.m.u. in negative ion mode. The hydroperoxide reductase activity of HMP was screened by using H2O2, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, cumyl hydroperoxide, and linoleic acid hydroperoxide as substrates. The reaction products analyzed by HPLC, GC, or ESI mass spectrometry revealed transformation of the alkylhydroperoxide species into their corresponding alcohols. A complete quantitative analysis of the reaction products carried out for cumyl hydroperoxide is shown in Fig. 1. The ethyl acetate extracts obtained from the reaction mixture in the absence (blank) and in the presence of HMP, respectively, were analyzed by HPLC. Elution profiles are shown in panel A (blank) and panel B. Benzyl alcohol (peak at 15.1 min) was used as an internal standard to quantify the reaction products. The elution profile of the blank in panel A demonstrates that stock solutions of cumyl hydroperoxide (peak at 42.1 min, 89%) contained both acetophenone (peak at 28.7 min, 3%) and cumyl alcohol (peak at 36.7 min, 8%) as contaminants. Data shown in panel B indicate a complete transformation of cumyl hydroperoxide into cumyl alcohol (peak 36.7 min), whereas the peak at 28.7 min reflects the small amount of acetophenone whose molar absorptivity at 256 nm is approximately 30-fold higher with respect to that of cumyl alcohol already present in the blank. Accordingly, GC mass data, performed in order to take into account the possible formation of other volatile reaction products, revealed full conversion of cumyl hydroperoxide into cumyl alcohol in the reaction mixture (data not shown). ESI mass spectrometric data (Fig. 2) revealed a similar trend in the case of linoleic acid hydroperoxide. Mass spectra of the ethyl acetate extracts of the blank solutions (in which either protein or NADH was absent) yielded a major peak at 311 a.m.u. (corresponding to the molecular weight of linoleic acid hydroperoxide anion), whereas the dominant feature was at 295 a.m.u. (–16 a.m.u. with respect to the 311 peak) in the reaction mixture containing both protein and NADH. Spurious peaks at 334 and 317 a.m.u. (+22 with respect to 311 and 295 a.m.u., respectively, attributed to Na+ ion adducts) are apparent in the blank and in the complete reaction mixture, respectively. Reaction kinetics were monitored on the different substrates by means of UV-visible absorption spectroscopy in both spectrophotometric experiments at low protein concentrations (0.2–1 μm) and in stopped-flow rapid kinetic measurements at higher protein concentrations (4–6 μm). HMP activities determined upon increasing amounts of alkylhydroperoxides or H2O2 to degassed HMP solutions in the presence of excess NADH (250 μm) are depicted in Fig. 3 (panel A). Double reciprocal plots of Fig. 3 are the result of several separate experiments carried out on different protein preparations. Data linearization and fitting yielded the set of steady state kinetic parameters reported in Table I. The highest activity was observed for cumyl and linoleic acid hydroperoxides, whereas the reduction of tert-butyl hydroperoxide and hydrogen peroxide was 2- and 3-fold slower, respectively (Table I). It should be pointed out that reaction with linoleic acid hydroperoxide is strongly solvent-dependent. Data obtained in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100 were fully reproducible and displayed nearly zeroth-order kinetics. In contrast, experiments carried out in 20% ethanol/water mixture in which substrate is soluble up to 2–3 mm concentration at 25 °C exhibited a slightly slower rate and displayed nearly exponential time courses.Table IE. coli flavohemoglobin steady state kinetic constants for hydroperoxide substratesHydroperoxideKMVmaxcFor comparison with data from other authors, activities can be redimensioned “per mol” using the molecular mass of 43,000 g mol-1 for HMP.μMnmol/min/mgH2O2260 ± 28789 ± 102tert-Butyl76 ± 151125 ± 135Cumyl55 ± 152564 ± 155Linoleic26 ± 14a0.1% Triton X-100.1876 ± 188a0.1% Triton X-100.115 ± 33b20% etanol/water mixture.872 ± 215b20% etanol/water mixture.a 0.1% Triton X-100.b 20% etanol/water mixture.c For comparison with data from other authors, activities can be redimensioned “per mol” using the molecular mass of 43,000 g mol-1 for HMP. Open table in a new tab Carbon monoxide inhibition of the hydroperoxide reduction reaction was also determined for cumyl hydroperoxide. The data reported in Fig. 3B indicate a clear competitive inhibition mechanism by CO with an apparent Ki of ∼0.2 μm (calculated from the apparent Kmapp values according to a simple Michaelis-Menten formalism). Rapid kinetic experiments carried out by mixing degassed HMP solutions (8 μm) in the presence of excess NADH (320 μm) with cumyl hydroperoxide (1 mm) solutions are depicted in Fig. 4A. The kinetic spectral profiles were characterized by a fast decay at 340 nm (t½ = 3 s) because of NADH oxidation while HMP remains in its fully reduced (ferrous heme, reduced flavin) deoxygenated derivative. Upon depletion of NADH-reducing equivalents (5–6 s), HMP undergoes complete oxidation (ferric heme, oxidized flavin). A similar trend is observed with linoleic acid hydroperoxide, whereas the formation of a spectroscopically distinct contribution characterized by an absorption peak at 420 nm was noticed under stationary state conditions in the reaction with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (data not shown). The species characterized by the 420-nm peak was the dominant feature in the reaction of ferrous HMP with hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 4B). An analysis of the time-dependent spectral profiles of Fig. 4 allowed the identification of the absorption spectra relative to each species (Fig. 5). The spectral profile 3 obtained from the data of Fig. 4 was thus attributed to an oxo-ferryl heme iron adduct by analogy with the spectra of typical Compounds II of peroxidases and must be distinguished from the ferrous heme iron dioxygen adduct (profile 4). The oxo-ferryl adduct was relatively stable (seconds to minutes) under reducing conditions (250 μm NADH) and 50–250 μm hydrogen peroxide concentrations, whereas it rapidly decayed to a mixture of ferric heme and unidentified heme degradation products in the presence of H2O2 in larger excess (>2 mm). To confirm the oxo-ferryl spectrum assignment, the following set of controls was carried out. (i) The species obtained in the presence of H2O2 and NADH was mixed with CO-saturated solutions (1 mm) in a double mixing experiment (see “Experimental Procedures”), and no spectral changes were observed. (ii) The same compound could not be reduced with sodium dithionite.Fig. 5UV-visible absorption spectra of E. coli flavohemoglobin intermediates in its reaction with alkylhydroperoxides.

NADH-reduced deoxygenated HMP spectrum (2Poole R.K. Hughes M.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) was collected before mixing with cumyl hydroperoxide. The spectrum of the HMP Compound II intermediate (3Cruz-Ramos H. Crack J. Wu G. Hughes M.N. Scott C. Thomson A.J. Green J. Poole R.K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) obtained as a transient species from the experiment carried out with H2O2 (see Fig. 3B) can be compared with the spectrum of fully reduced dioxygen HMP adduct (4Membrillo-Hernandez J.

Spectra 2–4 have been corrected by subtracting the contribution of NADH. All of the spectra have been taken at pH 7.0 in 0.1 m phosphate buffer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The results here presented demonstrate that HMP is capable of a very efficient alkylhydroperoxide reductase activity toward a set of synthetic substrates, namely tert-butyl, cumyl, and linoleic acid hydroperoxides (Figs. 1 and 2). Interestingly, the hydroperoxide reductase activity is higher toward cumyl, tert-butyl, and linoleic acid hydroperoxides than toward H2O2, thus indicating a preference for highly hydrophobic substrates (Table I). This finding must be analyzed in parallel with recent investigations in which HMP was also shown to interact with bacterial lipid membranes and to be able to bind specifically phospholipids and/or fatty acids within the heme pocket (14Bonamore A. Farina A. Gattoni M. Schininà M.E. Bellelli A. Boffi A. Biochemistry. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ollesch G. Kaunzinger A. Juchelka D. Schubert-Zsilavec M. Ermler U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations pave the way to a functional role for HMP and possibly other members of the bacterial hemoglobin family. HMP is involved in the repair of peroxidized membrane phospholipids, thus reducing hydroperoxides into their corresponding alcohols. The alkylhydroperoxide reductase activity is widespread among diverse bacterial species and is thought to represent a major functional response of the cell to oxidative stress (18Nishihama Y. Massey V. Takeda K. Kawasaki S. Sato J. Watanabe T. Niimura Y. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 138: 2431-2438Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In E. coli, oxidative stress involves among others the activation of OxyR, a hydrogen peroxide sensor and transcriptional activator that elicits the expression of a number of proteins and enzymes involved in hydrogen peroxide scavenging and/or repair of peroxidized substrates (19Pomposiello P.J. Demple B. Trends Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 109-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Among these, the 2-Cys peroxiredoxin/flavoprotein complex (ahpCF) has been shown to be able to reduce a broad class of peroxides spanning from hydrogen peroxide to unsaturated and aromatic hydrocarbon hydroperoxides and thus has been considered as a key enzyme in the bacterial alkylhydroperoxide reductase activity (18Nishihama Y. Massey V. Takeda K. Kawasaki S. Sato J. Watanabe T. Niimura Y. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 138: 2431-2438Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 19Pomposiello P.J. Demple B. Trends Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 109-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 20Hillas P.J. Soto del Alba F. Oyarzabal J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18801-18809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the structural diversity of peroxidized compounds possibly formed within the cell under oxidative stress is difficult to reconcile with the presence of a single enzyme capable of recognizing specifically the hydroperoxide moiety within complex molecular frames such as a DNA strand or a phospholipid acyl chain. So far, phospholipid-specific alkylhydroperoxidases have been identified in a number of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (21Gaber A. Tamoi M. Takeda T. Nakano Y. Shigeoka S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 499: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22Fisher A.B. Dodia C. Manevich Y. Chen J.W. Feinstein I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21326-21334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Along the same line, recent observations demonstrated that AhpCF peroxiredoxin complex plays a pivotal role in removing hydrogen peroxide in E. coli cells under stationary phase conditions (in virtue of a lower Km value with respect to catalases, whereas it is less efficient as a lipid hydroperoxide scavenger (23Seaver L.C. Imlay J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7173-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). HMP-catalyzed conversion of cumyl hydroperoxide to cumyl alcohol (currently used as a standard for comparing the alkylhydroperoxide reductase activity among different enzymes) occurs at a rate (2564 nmol/min/mg) that is at least two orders of magnitude higher than that measured for the E. coli AhpCF complex under similar experimental conditions (Ref. 18Nishihama Y. Massey V. Takeda K. Kawasaki S. Sato J. Watanabe T. Niimura Y. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 138: 2431-2438Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar and references cited therein) and ∼2-fold higher than that measured for the most efficient Amphibacillus xylanus peroxiredoxin reductase under saturating conditions of AhpC (24Niimura Y. Poole L.B. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25645-25650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Such a high activity corresponds to a turnover number (mol of substrate per mol of protein) of 110 min–1 (see Fig. 2 and Table I). CO inhibition experiments (Fig. 3, panel B) demonstrate that the activity is heme-linked and is not a spurious effect because of the presence of the highly reactive flavin prosthetic group within the protein. The residual activity observed in HMP in the presence of CO is in fact fully compatible with a competitive inhibition mechanism in which substrate binding is limited kinetically by the rate of CO release from the heme iron. Simple inspection of the time-dependent absorption spectra offers several interesting insights into the mechanism of the alkylhydroperoxide reductase activity. An analysis of the spectroscopic data of Figs. 4 and 5 together with previous experimental observations on lipid binding to HMP permits an un-equivocal elucidation of the early steps in the mechanism of alkylhydroperoxide reduction and establishes differences and analogies with classical heme-based peroxidase enzymes. HMP is capable of recognizing the alkylhydroperoxide moiety because of the highly hydrophobic distal heme pocket, and in the case of peroxidized phospholipids containing unsaturated fatty acids, HMP has been inferred to be able to adjust the hydrocarbon chain kink in correspondence of the cis double bond above the heme iron (14Bonamore A. Farina A. Gattoni M. Schininà M.E. Bellelli A. Boffi A. Biochemistry. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ollesch G. Kaunzinger A. Juchelka D. Schubert-Zsilavec M. Ermler U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thereafter, the binding of the hydroperoxide to the ferrous heme iron occurs with the concomitant two-electron reduction and cleavage of the dioxygen bond and consequent formation of a peroxidase-like Compound II and an alkyl alcohol. It is important to note that this first step does not imply electron transfer from the flavin to the heme iron but rather a direct two-electron iron oxidation. The fate of the ferryl-oxo compound thus generated is less obvious. Reduction of the ferryl-oxo compound to water and ferric heme with concomitant flavin oxidation and release of the hydroxyphospholipid to the membrane may be hypothesized. Most intriguingly, the active form of the protein capable of binding a new molecule of substrate is the ferrous derivative and not the ferric one. In fact, at variance with classical peroxidases, no alkylhydroperoxide and/or H2O2 binding to the heme iron can be detected when the heme iron is in the ferric state. Consistently, ferric HMP is unable to perform monooxygenations typically catalyzed by peroxidases and/or cytochrome P-450 on a broad variety of substrates (14Bonamore A. Farina A. Gattoni M. Schininà M.E. Bellelli A. Boffi A. Biochemistry. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). At present, a direct in vivo determination of the HMP-dependent alkylhydroperoxide reductase activity still needs to be explored. Nevertheless, a number of experimental observations on HMP expression in response to oxidative stress conditions provide convincing evidence for a genuine physiological role of the protein in the repair of oxidative damage. In particular, it was observed that HMP expression, controlled by the fumarate nitrate regulator transcription factor, is enhanced under conditions of prolonged oxidative stress such as those imposed by administrating paraquat and other agents generating oxygen reactive species to the culture medium (4Membrillo-Hernandez J. Coopmah M.D. Anjum M.F. Stevanin T.M. Kelly A. Hughes M.N. Poole R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 748-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 25Anjum M.J. Ioannidis N. Poole R.K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 166: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with HMP being transcribed in a later phase after the oxidative pulse. In fact, whereas the fast response to oxidative stress is governed by enzymes that are directly under the control of the transcription factor OxyR (18Nishihama Y. Massey V. Takeda K. Kawasaki S. Sato J. Watanabe T. Niimura Y. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 138: 2431-2438Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 27Zheng M. Wang X. Templeton L.J. Smulski D.R. LaRossa R.A. Storz G. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 138: 4562-4570Crossref Scopus (656) Google Scholar), the late response to oxidative stress involves a web of interactions that ultimately lead to HMP transcription (25Anjum M.J. Ioannidis N. Poole R.K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 166: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, enzymes involved in hydrogen peroxide scavenging (AhpCF and KatG/E gene products) or DNA protection (Dps gene product) are rendered available as a first barrier against peroxidation, whereas HMP and possibly other substrate-specific enzymes may play a role in the repair of diverse peroxidized species. In this framework, the link between the reported NO-induced (fumarate nitrate regulator-mediated) expression of HMP (3Cruz-Ramos H. Crack J. Wu G. Hughes M.N. Scott C. Thomson A.J. Green J. Poole R.K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and oxidative stress may reflect another facet of the complex and intimately correlated responses of the bacterial cell to NO and oxygen reactive species. NO induction of enzymes involved in the oxidative stress response is in fact well documented (28Ding H. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5146-5150Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and explicit mechanisms that envisage an increase of the alkylhydroperoxide reductase activity in the presence of NO have been proposed (29Bryk R. Griffin P. Nathan C. Nature. 2000; 407: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). In particular, nitroperoxide species formed at a diffusion-limited rate by the reaction of NO with superoxide anion is known to be a strong promoter of membrane lipid peroxidation (30Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Accordingly, NO-induced HMP expression under low oxygen tensions might well allow a direct (fumarate nitrate regulator-mediated) mechanism for lipid hydroperoxide reduction, whereas peroxiredoxins actively scavenge nitroperoxide anions (29Bryk R. Griffin P. Nathan C. Nature. 2000; 407: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). On the basis of the considerations just presented, HMP and other bacterial hemoglobins would be key enzymes in maintaining the cell membrane integrity at the aerobic/anaerobic interface. Such a hypothesis also provides a plausible explanation for the reported high growth performance of E. coli over-producing bacterial hemoglobins under microaerobic environments (31Bollinger C.J.T. Bailey J.E. Kallio P.T. Biotechnol. Prog. 2001; 17: 798-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, other catalytic options must also be considered in further studies. In fact, lipid-hydroperoxide reductase activity might be part of a specific reaction pathway that leads to the formation of lipid hydroperoxide-derived active compounds whose functions are yet to be established. It is worth mentioning that in chloroplasts, for instance, unsaturated fatty acid hydroperoxides are converted to signaling molecules by specific cytochrome P-450-like proteins such as hydroperoxide lyase and allene oxidase (26Baier M. Dietz K.J. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 166-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Unsaturated fatty acid processing by heme-based cyclo-oxygenase enzymes is also at the basis of the eicosanoids pathway in eukaryotic cells. Intriguingly, cyclo-oxygenases have been proposed to be activated by NO (or by nitroperoxide) to trigger the catalytic cycle. In the same way, bacterial hemoglobins might be involved in the (possibly NO-driven) processing of phospholipids in the framework of a more complex physiological response.

In cardiac precursor cells, BMP-2 has recently been shown to induce expression of cardiac transcription factors, including myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF-2A). The specific signal transduction mechanism by which BMP-2 regulates these actions is not known. We investigated the role of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase in regulating these processes in cardiomyocyte precursor CL6 cells. BMP-2 increased PI 3-kinase activity in these cells in a time-dependent manner, resulting in increased expression of sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MHC) and MEF-2A. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase abolished these actions of BMP-2, indicating the involvement of PI 3-kinase in these processes. Furthermore, BMP-2 stimulated specific protein·DNA complex formation when an MEF-2 DNA recognition element was used as probe. Antibody supershift assay confirmed the presence of MEF-2A in this protein·DNA complex. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity completely prevented the MEF-2A·DNA complex formation. BMP-2 also increased transcription of a reporter gene driven by an MEF-2-specific DNA element in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. Ectopic expression of MEF-2A increased BMP-2 transcription to the same extent induced by BMP-2, indicating that MEF-2A may participate in BMP-2 autoregulation in CL6 cells. Expression of dominant negative PI 3-kinase completely abolished BMP-2-induced as well as MEF-2A-mediated BMP-2 transcription. Furthermore expression of MEF-2A increased MHC expression in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. Together these data provide the first evidence that BMP-2-induced PI 3-kinase signaling regulates MEF-2A expression and define a mechanism of MEF-2A-dependent BMP-2 transcription.

Bone morphogenetic proteins were originally identified as growth and differentiation factors for osteogenic cells and are now considered as multifunctional polypeptides (1Sakou T. Bone. 1998; 22: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). BMPs 1The abbreviations used are: BMPs, bone morphogenetic proteins; MEF, myocyte enhancer factor; PI, phosphatidylinositol; MHC, myosin heavy chain; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PKC, protein kinase C.1The abbreviations used are: BMPs, bone morphogenetic proteins; MEF, myocyte enhancer factor; PI, phosphatidylinositol; MHC, myosin heavy chain; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PKC, protein kinase C. play important roles in the development of many organs, including lung, kidney, gut, skin, teeth, and heart (2Hogan B.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). BMP-2, a member of this family of proteins, is expressed during mouse embryonic heart development (3Abdelwahid E. Rice D. Pelliniemi L.J. Jokinen E. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A similar expression pattern of BMP-2 is conserved in Xenopus, where this growth and differentiation factor is expressed in the heart progenitor cells and in the mature heart (4Knochel S. Dillinger K. Koster M. Knochel W. Mech. Dev. 2001; 109: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). During chick embryogenesis, the tissues that express BMP-2 are in contact with the precursor cells committed to cardiac muscle lineage. Furthermore, introduction of BMP-2 in vivo induces expression of cardiac-specific transcription factors (5Schultheiss T.M. Burch J.B. Lassar A.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 451-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Finally, abnormal heart development leads to embryonic lethality in BMP-2 null mice (6Zhang H. Bradley A. Development. 1996; 122: 2977-2986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MEF-2 family of transcription factors has been shown to play a pivotal role in myogenesis of smooth muscle, skeletal, and cardiac cells (7Olson E.N. Perry M. Schulz R.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). MEF-2 DNA binding elements are present in many cardiac muscle genes. MEF-2A, MEF-2C, and MEF-2D bind the consensus DNA element with the same specificity, whereas MEF-2B binds with relatively reduced affinity (8Black B.L. Olson E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Addition of noggin, a BMP-2 antagonist, to chick embryo explants induced loss of cardiac-specific transcription factors, including MEF-2A (9Schlange T. Andree B. Arnold H.H. Brand T. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). One of the major kinases that regulate MEF-2 transcriptional activity is the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (10McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 40-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). More recently, PI 3-kinase, which is activated by the receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, has been shown to regulate MEF-2 transcriptional activity and myogenesis (11Jiang B.H. Zheng J.Z. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14179-14183Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 12Tamir Y. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34424-34432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus PI 3-kinase is required for insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor tyrosine kinase-induced myogenesis in culture and during mouse embryogenesis (13Florini J.R. Ewton D.Z. Coolican S.A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 481-517PubMed Google Scholar, 14Powell-Braxton L. Hollingshead P. Warburton C. Dowd M. Pitts-Meek S. Dalton D. Gillett N. Stewart T.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2609-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). BMP-2 acts as a survival factor for neonatal cardiac myocytes via Smad 1, the downstream target of BMP receptor (15Izumi M. Fujio Y. Kunisada K. Negoro S. Tone E. Funamoto M. Osugi T. Oshima Y. Nakaoka Y. Kishimoto T. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Hirota H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31133-31141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). BMP-2 also induces expression of cardiac transcription factors in embryonic teratocarcinoma cells (16Monzen K. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Oka T. Takimoto E. Hayashi D. Hosoda T. Habara-Ohkubo A. Nakaoka T. Fujita T. Yazaki Y. Komuro I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7096-7105Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which BMP-2 regulates cardiac development and cardiac gene expression is largely unknown. Here we show that BMP-2 activates PI 3-kinase in P19CL6 embryonic carcinoma cells, which differentiate along the cardiomyocyte lineage. BMP-2-induced expression and DNA binding of MEF-2 transcription factor are dependent upon PI 3-kinase activity. In addition we show that BMP-2-induced PI 3-kinase activity regulates MEF-2-dependent reporter gene transcription. Finally, we demonstrate that BMP-2-induced BMP-2 gene transcription is regulated by MEF-2 in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner.

Cell Culture—P19CL6 cells, described as CL6 in this report, and CL6-Noggin cells expressing noggin were kind gifts of Dr. I. Komuro, Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan. CL6 cells undergo differentiation in the presence of 1% Me2SO into beating cardiomyocyte and express cardiac-specific genes (16Monzen K. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Oka T. Takimoto E. Hayashi D.

The cells were grown in α-minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were serum-deprived for 24 h to make them quiescent. To induce MEF-2A expression, the cells were grown in 1% Me2SO or in the indicated concentration of BMP-2. Adenovirus Infection—CL6 cells were infected with a multiplicity of infection of 50 for Ad Myr-p110, essentially as described before (17Ghosh-Choudhury N. Abboud S.L. Nishimura R. Celeste A.

Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence detection of sarcomeric MHC was performed essentially as described previously (17Ghosh-Choudhury N. Abboud S.L. Nishimura R. Celeste A. Mahimainathan L.

Briefly, treated cells in eight-well chamber slides were fixed in cold methanol for 15 min followed by blocking with donkey IgG for 15 min. The cells were then incubated with MF-20 for 30 min. Stained cells were treated with Cy-tagged secondary anti-mouse antibody for 30 min. The cells were visualized using a confocal microscope (Olympus FluoView 500) and photographed using FluoView software. Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, and PI 3-kinase Assay— Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05% aprotinin, and 1% Nonidet P-40). Cleared cell lysates were prepared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined in the lysate, and an equal amount of protein was immunoprecipitated with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The immunoprecipitates were used in the PI 3-kinase assay using PI as substrate in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, and the products were separated by thin layer chromatography followed by autoradiography (18Choudhury G.G.

Nuclear extracts were prepared using a kit according to the method provided by the vendor. An MEF-2 DNA probe was prepared by annealing the oligonucleotide 5′-GATCGCTCTAAAAATAACCCTGTCG-3′ with its complementary strand and labeling the double-stranded oligonucleotide consensus sequence using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (24Martin J.F. Schwarz J.J. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5282-5286Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The EMSA was performed using 10 μg of the nuclear extract as described previously (25Choudhury G.G. Ghosh-Choudhury N. Abboud H.E. J. Clin.

To determine the specificity of protein·DNA interaction, the nuclear extract was incubated with a 100-fold excess of cold double-stranded oligonucleotide and incubated farther with the labeled probe. For supershift analysis, the nuclear extracts were incubated with the MEF-2A or cyclin D1 antibody on ice for 30 min before binding reaction was performed as described before (25Choudhury G.G.

BMP-2-LUC reporter plasmid was cotransfected with different expression plasmids using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent as described (20Choudhury G.G. J. Biol.

A cytomegalovirus promoter-driven Renilla luciferase plasmid was included in the transfection mix to correct for transfection efficiency. Luciferase activity was determined using a dual luciferase assay kit. BMP-2 Stimulates PI 3-kinase Activity—CL6 cells, a clonal derivative of embryonic P19 teratocarcinoma cells, undergo differentiation into beating cardiomyocytes when treated with Me2SO in a BMP-2-dependent manner (16Monzen K. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Oka T. Takimoto E. Hayashi D. Hosoda T. Habara-Ohkubo A. Nakaoka T. Fujita T. Yazaki Y. Komuro I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7096-7105Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of PI 3-kinase in response to BMP-2, CL6 cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml BMP-2 for different periods of time. The lysates were then immunoprecipitated with an antibody recognizing the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase. The immunoprecipitates were used in immunocomplex PI 3-kinase assays. BMP-2 increased PI 3-kinase activity in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). The mechanism by which PI 3-kinase is activated by receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases is by direct association of the SH-2 domain of the regulatory subunit with the phosphotyrosine of the proteins (31Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assayed PI 3-kinase activity in the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates from BMP-2-treated CL6 cells. BMP-2 significantly increased PI 3-kinase activity in the anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that activation of BMP receptor serine threonine kinase in CL6 cells activated PI 3-kinase in the tyrosine-phosphorylated protein fraction. BMP-2-induced PI 3-kinase Is Required for Cardiomyocyte Differentiation—To examine the role of PI 3-kinase in BMP-2-induced cardiomyocyte differentiation, we used Ly294002, a pharmacological inhibitor of PI 3-kinase. Incubation of CL6 cell with this inhibitor completely blocked BMP-2-induced PI 3-kinase activity (Fig. 2A). Mature cardiomyocytes express sarcomeric MHC. During differentiation of CL6 cells to cardiomyocytes, MHC is highly expressed and serves as a marker for mature cardiomyocytes (16Monzen K. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Oka T. Takimoto E. Hayashi D. Hosoda T. Habara-Ohkubo A. Nakaoka T. Fujita T. Yazaki Y. Komuro I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7096-7105Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To test the effect of PI 3-kinase on BMP-2-induced cardiomyocyte differentiation, CL6 cells were incubated with Ly294002 in the presence and absence of BMP-2. The cells were stained with anti-MHC antibody MF-20. As expected, BMP-2 efficiently stimulated expression of MHC, suggesting induction of mature cardiomyocytes (Fig. 2B, compare panel b with panel a). Inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity by Ly294002 abolished BMP-2-induced MHC expression (Fig. 2B, compare panel d with panel b). To further confirm the involvement of PI 3-kinase, we used an adenovirus vector (Ad Myrp110) containing the constitutively active myristoylated p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase. Infection of CL6 cells with this adenovirus vector showed expression of p110 within 24 h (Fig. 2C). To test the effect of PI 3-kinase on MHC expression, CL6 cells were infected with Ad Myr-p110. The cells were stained with MF-20. Expression of the constitutively active PI 3-kinase increased expression of sarcomeric MHC (Fig. 2D). These data indicate that PI 3-kinase is required for MHC-expressing mature cardiomyocyte formation in response to BMP-2. PI 3-kinase Regulates BMP-2-induced MEF-2A Expression— Me2SO-mediated cardiomyocyte differentiation of CL6 cells has previously been shown to induce MEF-2C expression (16Monzen K. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Kudoh S. Oka T. Takimoto E. Hayashi D. Hosoda T. Habara-Ohkubo A. Nakaoka T. Fujita T. Yazaki Y. Komuro I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7096-7105Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether MEF-2A, which is also a marker for heart development, is expressed in CL6 cells (9Schlange T. Andree B. Arnold H.H. Brand T. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To address this and to examine the effect of BMP-2, CL6 cells were incubated with different concentrations of BMP-2. The lysates were immunoblotted with an antibody that recognizes MEF-2A. BMP-2 at a concentration of 40–100 ng/ml increased MEF-2A protein abundance (Fig. 3A). Me2SO also induced MEF-2A expression in these cells (Fig. 3B). To test the effect of PI 3-kinase on BMP-2-induced MEF-2A expression, we incubated CL6 cells with Ly294002 in the presence or absence of BMP-2. Cells were also treated with Me2SO or Me2SO plus Ly294002. As expected, BMP-2 and Me2SO alone increased MEF-2A expression (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 3 and 2 with lane 1). Addition of both BMP-2 and Me2SO did not further increase the abundance of MEF-2A (Fig. 3C, lane 4). Inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity abolished both BMP-2-induced and Me2SO-induced MEF-2A expression (Fig. 3C, compare lane 7 with 3 and lane 6 with 2, respectively). These data indicate that PI 3-kinase regulates a common target, which modulates MEF-2A expression in CL6 cells in response to BMP-2 as well as Me2SO. PI 3-kinase Regulates BMP-2-induced MEF-2A DNA Binding—Because BMP-2 increased MEF-2A protein expression, we tested whether the growth and differentiation factor stimulates the DNA binding activity of the transcription factor. Nuclear extracts isolated from BMP-2-treated CL6 cells were incubated with a 32P-labeled MEF-2 consensus oligonucleotide, and the products were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. BMP-2 increased formation of protein·DNA complex (Fig. 4A, compare lane 2 with 1). Inclusion of a 100-fold excess of cold oligonucleotide completely prevented the protein·DNA complex formation, indicating the specificity of DNA-protein interaction (Fig. 4A, compare lane 3 with 2). To test the involvement of MEF-2A in the formation of protein·DNA complex, an antibody specific for MEF-2A was used in the EMSA. MEF-2A antibody inhibited the protein·DNA complex formation (Fig. 4B, compare lane 3 with 2). Note that the antibody partially supershifted the complex (Fig. 4B, lane 3, indicated by the bracket). A heterologous antibody against cyclin D1 did not have any effect on protein·DNA complex formation (Fig. 4B, lane 4). These data indicate that BMP-2 not only regulates the expression of MEF-2A in CL6 cells but also modulates its DNA binding activity to its cognate DNA element. PI 3-kinase regulates receptor tyrosine kinase-induced transcription of target genes, which modulate cell survival (32Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5328) Google Scholar). However, nothing is known about regulation of BMP-receptor serine threonine kinase-induced PI 3-kinase-dependent MEF-2 transcriptional activation. Therefore, to assess the functional consequences of BMP-2-induced PI 3-kinase activation in MEF-2A DNA binding, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay was carried out with nuclear extracts isolated from CL6 cells incubated with BMP-2 alone and BMP-2 plus Ly294002. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity by this pharmacological agent abolished BMP-2-induced MEF-2A·DNA complex formation (Fig. 4C, compare lane 4 with 2). These data indicate that activation of PI 3-kinase regulates BMP receptor serine threonine kinase-induced MEF-2-DNA interaction. PI 3-kinase Regulates BMP-2-induced MEF-2-dependent Transcription—Transcriptional activation of MEF-2 family transcription factors is mediated by tyrosine kinase-dependent PI 3-kinase. For example, activation of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor tyrosine kinase induces myogenic differentiation via PI 3-kinase-dependent increase in MEF-2 transcriptional activity (12Tamir Y. Bengal E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34424-34432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To directly examine the effect of PI 3-kinase on MEF-2-dependent transcription in BMP-2 receptor serine threonine kinase activation, we constructed a reporter plasmid in which four copies of the MEF-2 DNA binding element were cloned upstream of the SV-40 basal promoter driving luciferase cDNA (Fig. 5A). The reporter plasmid was transfected into CL6 cells. Incubation of these transiently transfected cells with BMP-2 increased transcription of the reporter gene, indicating that BMP-2 stimulates transcription from the MEF-2 DNA element (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, cotransfection of MEF-2A cDNA with the reporter plasmid resulted in a significant increase in the transcriptional activity demonstrating that the reporter construct is responsive to the MEF-2A transcription factor (Fig. 5B). Addition of BMP-2 to these cotransfected cells showed no further significant additive effect. To test the involvement of PI 3-kinase in the BMP-2-induced transcription of this reporter gene, transiently transfected cells were incubated with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, Ly294002, before addition of BMP-2. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase significantly blocked BMP-2-induced transcription of the reporter gene driven by the MEF-2 DNA element (Fig. 5C). To confirm this observation, reporter construct was cotransfected with a dominant negative 85-kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase. Transiently transfected cells were incubated with BMP-2. Dominant negative PI 3-kinase significantly prevented BMP-2-induced transcription of the reporter gene (Fig. 5D). These data indicate that BMP-2-induced PI 3-kinase activity is necessary for transcriptional activation of MEF-2. MEF-2ARegulatesBMP-2GeneTranscriptioninaPI3-kinase-dependent Manner—We have shown previously that BMP-2 autoregulates its own transcription in osteogenic cells (29Ghosh-Choudhury N. Windle J.J.

To investigate the involvement of PI 3-kinase in BMP-2 transcription, we used a reporter construct in which the firefly luciferase gene is driven by the promoter of the BMP-2 gene (BMP-2-LUC) (29Ghosh-Choudhury N.

This plasmid was transfected either with vector alone or dominant negative p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase into CL6 cells. Incubation of transiently transfected cells with BMP-2 increased the reporter gene expression, indicating that BMP-2 autoregulates its own transcription in these cells similar to autoregulation in osteoblasts (Fig. 6A) (28Ghosh-Choudhury N. Harris M.A. Feng J.Q. Mundy G.R. Harris S.E. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 1994; 4: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 29Ghosh-Choudhury N. Windle J.J.

However, transfection of dominant negative PI 3-kinase completely blocked BMP-2-induced BMP-2 transcription (Fig. 6A). These data indicate that, in CL6 cardiomyocyte precursor cells, PI 3-kinase regulates BMP-2 gene transcription induced by BMP-2. To investigate the role of MEF-2 family of transcription factors in regulating the transcription of BMP-2, we analyzed the 5′-flanking sequence of BMP-2 gene. This analysis revealed the presence of three MEF-2 elements (30Ghosh-Choudhury N. Choudhury G.G. Harris M.A. Wozney J. Mundy G.R. Abboud S.L. Harris S.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To examine involvement of MEF-2A in BMP-2 transcription, we transfected the BMP-2-LUC reporter plasmid along with the MEF-2A expression vector into CL6 cells. Ectopic expression of MEF-2A increased BMP-2 promoter activity to an extent similar to that induced by BMP-2 alone (Fig. 6B), suggesting that MEF-2A regulates BMP-2 gene transcription in CL6 cells. Next, we examined the involvement of PI 3-kinase in the regulation of the MEF-2A-dependent transcription of BMP-2 gene. BMP-2-LUC was cotransfected with the MEF-2A expression vector alone or along with dominant negative PI 3-kinase. As expected, MEF-2A increased transcription of the BMP-2 gene (Fig. 6C). Expression of dominant negative PI 3-kinase completely blocked the MEF-2A-dependent BMP-2 transcription (Fig. 6C). Together these data indicate that BMP-2-induced PI 3-kinase may regulate MEF-2A transcriptional activity, which in turn regulates BMP-2 gene transcription. MEF-2A Induces Formation of Mature Cardiomyocyte-expressing MHC—Because MEF-2A regulates BMP-2 expression and BMP-2 is necessary for differentiation of CL6 cells to form mature cardiomyocytes (16Monzen K.

The oxidation of LDL generates a variety of reactive aldehydic products, which covalently bind to the LDL apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB). In the present study, to investigate the mechanisms contributing to the modification of LDL, we analyzed oxidized cholesteryl esters generated during the autoxidation of LDL and characterized their covalent binding to the lysine residues of LDL apoB. In addition, we raised a monoclonal antibody specific to a lysine-bound oxidized cholesteryl ester and determined its production in human atherosclerotic lesions. The peroxidation of LDL with Cu2+ produced 9-oxononanoylcholesterol (9-ONC) and 5-oxovaleroylcholesterol as the major oxidized cholesteryl esters. We observed that the levels of 9-ONC and 5-oxovaleroylcholesterol peaked at 12 h and significantly decreased thereafter. The reduction of the core aldehyde levels was accompanied by (i) the formation of free 7-ketocholesterol and 7-ketocholesteryl ester core aldehydes and (ii) an increase in the amounts of apoB-bound cholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol, suggesting that the cholesteryl ester core aldehydes were further converted to their 7-ketocholesterol- and apoB-bound derivatives. To detect the protein-bound 9-ONC, we raised the monoclonal antibody 2A81, directed against 9-ONC-modified protein, and found that it extensively recognized protein-bound cholesteryl ester core aldehydes. Agarose gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblot analysis of the oxidized LDL clearly demonstrated the formation of antigenic structures. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis of the atherosclerotic lesions from the human aorta showed that immunoreactive materials with mAb 2A81 were indeed present in the lesions, in which the intense immunoreactivity was mainly located in the macrophage-derived foam cells and the thickening neointima of the arterial walls. The results of this study suggest that the binding of cholesteryl ester core aldehydes to LDL might represent the process common to the oxidative modification of lipoproteins.

Atherosclerosis is a complex vascular disorder that can lead to more serious conditions such as myocardial infarction. The events in atherosclerosis are monocyte migration from the blood stream, its differentiation into macrophages in situ, the uptake of low density lipoprotein (LDL) 1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein(s); 9-ONC, 9-oxononanoylcholesterol; 5-OVC, 5-oxovaleroylcholesterol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; KLH, keyhole limpet hemocyanin; LC-MS, liquid chromatographymass spectrometry; TBARS, 2-thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; DNPH, 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine; MDA, malondialdehyde; mAb, monoclonal antibody. by the macrophage scavenger receptor, transformation of the lipid-laden macrophage into foam cells, smooth muscle cell proliferation and transformation into foam cells, and thus the accumulation of foam cells leading to fatty streaks and subsequent plaque formation. Various lines of evidence indicate that an important part of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is the oxidative modification of plasma LDL (1Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Steinberg D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 369: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that LDL undergoes oxidative modification before it can give rise to foam cells, the key component of the progression of atherosclerosis, and that the oxidation of LDL in vivo can be reproduced by the in vitro incubation of LDL with cultured cells, such as endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and macrophages, or by autoxidation catalyzed by cupric ion in the absence of cells (1Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During the oxidation of LDL, the LDL molecule undergoes a large number of structural changes that alter its metabolism (1Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the detailed mechanism for the modification of LDL has not yet been established, it is generally accepted that the primary generation of lipid hydroperoxides initiates a reaction cascade leading to rapid propagation and to amplification of the number of reactive oxygen species formed; this ultimately leads to extensive fragmentation of the fatty acid chains (3Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5891) Google Scholar) and conversion of the LDL to a more atherogenic form (4Quinn M.T. Parthasarathy S. Fong L.G. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2995-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Lipid peroxidation leads to the formation of a broad array of different products with diverse and powerful biological activities. Among them are a variety of different aldehydes (5Witz G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1989; 7: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The primary products of lipid peroxidation, lipid hydroperoxides (6Girotti A.W. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1529-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), can undergo carbon-carbon bond cleavage via alkoxyl radicals in the presence of transition metals, giving rise to the formation of short-chain, unesterified aldehydes (6Girotti A.W. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1529-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Terao J. Pelfrey C. Membrane Lipid Oxidation. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 219-238Google Scholar) or a second class of aldehydes still esterified to the parent lipid. These esterified aldehydes are commonly termed core aldehydes (8Itabe H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1998; 37: 181-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although these compounds have received less attention, the formation of phospholipid and cholesteryl ester core aldehydes during the oxidation of LDL has been demonstrated (9Watson A.D. Leitinger N. Navab M. Faull K.F. Horkko S. Witztum J.L. Palinski W. Schwenke D. Salomon R.G. Sha W. Subbanagounder G. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Due to their structural similarity to the platelet-activating factor and their rather hydrophilic nature, phospholipid core aldehydes display a number of platelet-activating factor-related biological activities. More recently, Podrez et al. (11Podrez E.A. Poliakov E. Shen Z. Zhang R. Deng Y. Sun M. Finton P.J. Shan L. Gugiu B. Fox P.L. Hoff H.F. Salomon R.G. Hazen S.L. J. Biol.

On the other hand, with regard to oxidized cholesteryl esters, Kamido et al. (10Kamido H. Kuksis A. Marai L. Myher J.J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) isolated and identified 9-oxononanoylcholesterol (9-ONC) and 5-oxovaleroylcholesterol (5-OVC) as the oxidation products of cholesteryl linoleate and cholesteryl arachidonate, respectively, in oxidized LDL. The oxidation of high density lipoprotein resulted in the formation of primarily 5-OVC and 9-ONC and, although to a lesser extent, the corresponding 7-ketocholesterol derivatives (12Kamido H. Kuksis A. Marai L. Myher J.J. Pang H. Lipids. 1992; 27: 645-650Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In line with the potential pathophysiological role of these compounds, the cholesteryl ester and 7-ketocholesteryl ester core aldehydes of varying chain lengths were identified in human atheromas (13Hoppe G. Ravandi A. Herrera D. Kuksis A. Hoff H.F. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1347-1360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Karten B. Boechzelt H. Abuja P.M. Mittelbach M. Oettl K. Sattler W. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1508-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the phospholipid core aldehydes, however, much less is known about the formation, metabolism, and biological properties of cholesteryl ester core aldehydes. In the present study, to investigate the mechanisms contributing to the modification of LDL, we analyzed the oxidized cholesteryl esters generated during the autoxidation of LDL and characterized their covalent binding to lysine residues of LDL apoB. In addition, based on the fact that the cholesteryl ester- and 7-ketocholesteryl ester core aldehydes of varying chain length were identified in human atheromas (13Hoppe G. Ravandi A. Herrera D. Kuksis A. Hoff H.F. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1347-1360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Karten B. Boechzelt H. Abuja P.M. Mittelbach M. Oettl K. Sattler W. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1508-1519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we raised a monoclonal antibody directed to a lysine-bound oxidized cholesteryl ester and determined its production in human atherosclerotic lesions. Materials—Cholesterol, cholesteryl linoleate, cholesteryl arachidonate, cholesteryl oleate, Nα-benzoyl-glycyl-lysine, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were obtained from Sigma. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) was obtained from Pierce. Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG immunoglobulin and ECL Western blotting detection reagents were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Synthesis of 9-ONC—9-ONC was prepared by the two-step oxidation of cholesteryl oleate as previously described (10Kamido H. Kuksis A. Marai L. Myher J.J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 304: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with some modification. Briefly, cholesteryl oleate (325 mg, 0.5 mmol in 20 ml of tetrahydrofuran) was mixed with N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (70 mg, 0.6 mmol in 10 ml of H2O) and 250 μl of OsO4 (10 mg/ml in dioxane) and magnetically stirred overnight at room temperature. After the incubation, 50 ml of 10% sodium sulfite was added and mixed. After 1 h at room temperature, the lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). The formed diol, 9,10-dihydroxyoctadecanoate, was purified by a silica gel column equipped with n-hexane/ether (6:7). The Rf value was 0.23. The obtained diol (2 mg/ml in ethanol) was mixed with an equal volume of 0.5% periodic acid. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, the lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). The chloroform phase was evaporated and dissolved in ethanol, and 9-ONC was purified by reverse-phase HPLC using a Develosil ODS-HG-5 column (8 × 250 mm) (Nomura Chemicals, Aichi, Japan). The gradient condition (solvent A, methanol; solvent B, isopropyl alcohol/methanol (8:2)) was as follows: 100% A (0 min), 50% B (30 min), 100% B (35 min), 100% B hold (35–50 min), 100% A (55 min). The retention time of 9-ONC was around 21–25 min. Characterization of 9-ONC was done by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis following derivatization with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH). The LC-MS analysis of the product gave a pseudomolecular ion peak (M + H)+ at m/z 718.7, which corresponded to the expected dinitrophenylhydrazone derivative of 9-ONC. Autoxidation of Cholesteryl Esters—The autoxidation of the cholesteryl esters was performed by incubating the emulsified cholesteryl ester liposome (20 mm) with Fe2+ (10 μm) and ascorbate (1 mm) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). In Vitro Oxidation of LDL—LDL (1.019–1.063 g/ml) was prepared from the plasma of healthy humans by sequential ultracentrifugation and then extensively dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.01% EDTA at 4 °C. The LDL used for the oxidative modification by Cu2+ was dialyzed against a 1000-fold volume of phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. The oxidation of LDL was performed by incubating 0.5 mg of LDL with CuSO4 (5 μm) in 1 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C. Informed consent was obtained under the study approved by our institutional review board. The study was performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 as revised in 1983. Lipid Peroxidation Assay—The degree of lipid peroxidation of the cholesteryl ester and LDL was determined by measurement of 2-thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS). The reaction mixture (0.1 ml) was treated with 0.5 ml of 2.8% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 0.5 ml of 1% 2-thiobarbituric acid in 0.05 n NaOH and then boiled for 20 min. After cooling, the sample was centrifuged (11,000 × g, 3 min), and the absorbance of the supernatant solution was measured at 532 nm. Malondialdehyde bis(dimethyl acetal), which yields malondialdehyde (MDA) by acid treatment, was used as a standard. Core Aldehyde Analysis—The cholesteryl ester core aldehydes in the reaction mixtures (100 μl) were derivatized with an equal volume of 0.1% DNPH in 2 n HCl at room temperature for 30 min. The formed DNPH derivatives were extracted with chloroform, evaporated, and dissolved in ethanol. 10 μl of the aliquot was injected and analyzed on a Develosil ODS-MG-5 column (4.6 × 250 mm) with a linear gradient elution from isopropyl alcohol/methanol (2:8) to isopropyl alcohol/methanol (8:2) for 45 min at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The elution profiles were monitored by absorbance at 370 nm. For the LC-MS measurement with a Jasco PlatformII-LC instrument, 0.5% ammonium hydroxide was added to the mobile phases. Cholesteryl Ester Analysis—Lipids in LDL samples (100 μl) were extracted with an equal volume of chloroform/methanol (1:1), and the 25-μl chloroform layer was directly injected on a Develosil ODS-MG-5 column (4.6 × 250 mm) with a linear gradient elution from isopropyl alcohol/methanol (2:8) to isopropyl alcohol/methanol (8:2) for 45 min at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min and monitored at 210 nm. Quantification was performed by peak area comparison with external standards. Analysis of ApoB-bound Cholesteryl Esters—The isolation of apoB was performed as previously described (15Gillotte K.L. Horkko S. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 824-833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μl of 1 n HCl and 100 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1) were added to 100 μl of LDL samples, mixed, and centrifuged at 7,000 rpm for 10 min. The insoluble apoB was collected and washed twice each with ether, H2O, and acetone. The isolated apoB was solubilized in 10 mm NaOH containing 2% octyl glucoside. The cholesteryl esters associated with the apoB were saponified by incubation of the protein with 1 n KOH in methanol for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation, 6 n HCl was added until an acidic pH was reached, and chloroform was added to extract the lipids. The chloroform phase was evaporated to dryness and dissolved in 50 μl of ethanol. 10 μl of the aliquot was injected on a Develosil ODS-MG-5 column (4.6 × 250 mm) in a solvent system of isopropyl alcohol/methanol (2:8) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min with UV detection at 210 nm. Quantification was performed by peak area comparison with external standards. Reaction of Nα-Benzoyl-glycyl-lysine with 9-ONC—9-ONC (0–10 mm in methanol) was mixed with an equal volume of 2 mmNα-benzoyl-glycyl-lysine in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), sonicated for 1 min, and incubated for 4 h at room temperature. After the incubations, the reaction mixtures were treated with 50 mm NaCNBH3 for 1 h at room temperature. The 9-ONC-Nα-benzoyl-glycyl-lysine adducts were extracted with an equal volume of chloroform, evaporated, dissolved in methanol, and analyzed by LC-MS equipped with a Develosil ODS-HG-5 column (4.6 × 250 mm) using a linear gradient from 90% aqueous acetonitrile to 100% acetonitrile for 30 min with UV detection (240 nm). The elution profiles were monitored by absorbance at 240 nm. Modification of BSA by 9-ONC—250 μl of 9-ONC dissolved in methanol was added to the BSA solution in 750 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The final concentrations of BSA and 9-ONC were 0.5 mg/ml and 0–5 mm, respectively. Amino Acid Analysis—An aliquot (0.1 ml) of the protein samples incubated in the absence or presence of 9-ONC was treated with 10 mm EDTA (10 μl), 1 n NaOH (10 μl), and 100 mm NaBH4 (10 μl). After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the mixture was treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 3 min, the proteins were hydrolyzed in vacuo with 6 n HCl for 24 h at 105 °C. The hydrolysates were then concentrated and dissolved in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The amino acid analysis was performed using a JEOL JLC-500 amino acid analyzer equipped with a JEOL LC30-DK20 data analyzing system. Antibody Preparation—The antigen was prepared by incubating KLH (1.0 mg/ml) with 5 mm 9-ONC in 10 ml of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 24 h. The 9-ONC-treated KLH was further treated with NaCNBH3 to reductively aminate the 9-ONC-lysine Schiff base adducts. Female BALB/c mice were immunized three times with the 9-ONC-modified KLH. Spleen cells from the immunized mice were fused with P3/U1 murine myeloma cells and cultured in hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine selection medium. The culture supernatants of the hybridoma were screened using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), employing pairs of wells of microtiter plates on which were absorbed 9-ONC-treated BSA as the antigen (0.5 μg of protein/well). ELISA—A 100-μl aliquot of the antigen solution was added to each well of a 96-well microtiter plate and incubated for 20 h at 4 °C. The antigen solution was then removed, and the plate was washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 10% Tween 20 (TBS/Tween). Each well was incubated with 200 μl of 1% BSA in TBS/Tween for 30 min at 37 °C to block the unsaturated plastic surface. The plate was then washed once with TBS/Tween. A 100-μl aliquot of the antibody was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After discarding the supernatants and washing three times with TBS/Tween, a 100 μl of a 5 × 103 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgM conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in TBS/Tween was added. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the supernatant was discarded, and the plates were washed three times with TBS/Tween. The enzyme-linked antibody bound to the well was revealed by adding 100 μl/well of 1,2-phenylenediamine in 0.1 m citrate/phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 0.003% hydrogen peroxide. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 m sulfuric acid, and the absorbance at 492 nm was read on a micro-ELISA plate reader. In a competitive ELISA, a competitor was incubated with antibody for 20 h at 4 °C to yield competitor/antibody mixtures containing antibody at 0.8 μg/ml and variable concentrations of the competitor. A 100-μl aliquot of competitor/antibody mixtures was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After discarding the supernatants and washing three times with TBS/Tween, the second antibody was added, and the enzyme-linked antibody bound to the well was revealed as described above. Results were expressed as the ratio B:Bo, where B represents absorbance in the presence of competitor minus background absorbance (no antibody, and Bo is absorbance in the absence of competitor minus background absorbance. Agarose Gel Electrophoresis/Immunoblot Analysis—Agarose gel electrophoresis of LDL was performed with the Helena TITAN GEL High Resolution Protein System (Helena Laboratories, Saitama, Japan). The samples were run on two separate gels. One gel was used for staining with Fat Red 7B; the other was transblotted to nitrocellulose membranes, incubated with Block Ace (40 mg/ml) for blocking, washed, and treated with the primary antibody (mAb 2A81). This procedure was followed by the addition of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to a goat anti-mouse IgM and ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The bands were visualized by exposure of the membranes to autoradiography film. Immunohistochemistry—This investigation was carried out on aortic wall samples obtained at autopsy from five patients with generalized arteriosclerosis without diabetes mellitus. Each autopsy was performed at Tokyo Women's Medical University after the patients' family members granted informed consent according to the established guideline. The postmortem time before starting autopsy varied from 1 to 3 h. No significant difference of morphological changes in the aorta was seen among these cases with different postmortem time. Each sample was prepared for 10% formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded materials and for frozen materials embedded in the optimum cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetechnical, Tokyo, Japan) at -80 °C. Multiple 6-μm-thick sections were cut from these paraffin-embedded and frozen materials and used for histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations. Paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized in xylene and ethanol, rehydrated in distilled water, quenched for 10 min with 3% hydrogen peroxide for inhibiting endogenous peroxidase activity, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.6, and pretreated for 30 min at room temperature with 3% nonimmune animal serum, from the same species as those producing secondary antibodies, in phosphate-buffered saline for blocking nonspecific antibody binding. Prior to immunostaining for CD68, paraffin sections were treated for 30 min at 37 °C with 0.1% trypsin in phosphate-buffered saline for antigen retrieval. Frozen sections were dried, postfixed or not in 10% formalin, rehydrated, processed with the same subsequent procedures as those for paraffin sections, and pretreated with the endogenous avidin/biotin blocking kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). For staining of frozen sections, 1 mm EDTA was added to each solvent for removal of transition metals. These prepared sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with mAb 2A81 at a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml and the mouse monoclonal anti-CD68 IgG antibody (KP-1; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) at a dilution of 1:500. CD68 was used as a specific marker of macrophages. Immunoreaction was visualized by the avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase complex method using Vectastain ABC kit (Vector). The chromogen was 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride, and the counterstain was hematoxylin. Sections from which the primary antibodies were omitted served as negative reaction controls. An immunoabsorption test was performed on sections incubated with mAb 2A81 pretreated with 50 μg/ml 9-ONC-conjugated BSA. Immunohistochemical localization of the immunoreaction product deposits was verified by light microscopy on consecutive sections with hematoxylin-eosin or immunostained for CD68. Transient Accumulation of Cholesteryl Ester Core Aldehydes during Peroxidation of Cholesteryl Esters and LDL—We analyzed the aldehydic molecules generated during the peroxidation of cholesteryl linoleate and cholesteryl arachidonate. As shown in Fig. 1A, when cholesteryl linoleate was treated with 10 μm Fe2+ and 1 mM ascorbate in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), the TBARS values reached a maximum at 24 h and decreased thereafter. The LC-MS analysis following the DNPH derivatization demonstrated that, in addition to the short-chain aldehydes such as acetaldehyde, hexanal, and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (Fig. 1B), the metal-catalyzed peroxidation of cholesteryl linoleate mainly produced 9-ONC (Fig. 1C). Upon autoxidation of cholesteryl arachidonate, 5-OVC was detected as the major product (Fig. 1D). These core aldehydes were estimated to account for a minimum of 1–2% of the consumed cholesteryl esters. Subsequently, we characterized the formation of these core aldehydes during the peroxidation of LDL. To efficiently induce LDL peroxidation, Cu2+, instead of Fe2+, was used as the catalyst. Both Cu2+ and Fe2+ can be used to initiate LDL oxidation in vitro, since the resulting oxidized LDL has similar biological activities to that oxidized in vivo. However, Cu2+ is more frequently used for the in vitro LDL oxidation, because Cu2+ alone can effectively oxidize LDL, whereas a chelating agent, such as citrate, is required for the Fe2+-initiated LDL oxidation (16Lynch S.M. Frei B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5158-5163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, the TBARS values reached a maximum between 12 and 24 h. In addition, the cholesteryl esters contained in the LDL were eventually consumed, and all of them disappeared within 24 h of incubation (Fig. 2B). In parallel to the extent of the LDL oxidation, there was a progressive increase in the number of cholesteryl ester core aldehydes, 9-ONC and 5-OVC (Fig. 2C). The decrease in the cholesteryl ester concentrations closely reflected the formation of these core aldehydes. It was noted that the amounts of both core aldehydes peaked (150 nmol of 9-ONC and 25 nmol of 5-OVC per mg of LDL) at 12 h and continuously decreased thereafter (Fig. 2D). This result suggests that these cholesteryl ester core aldehydes may be the intermediates that undergo further reactions during the LDL peroxidation. Oxidative Conversion of Cholesteryl Ester Core Aldehydes to Their 7-Ketocholesterol Derivatives—It was anticipated that the decrease in the cholesteryl ester core aldehyde concentrations during LDL peroxidation might be due to their conversion to the corresponding oxidized products, such as the 7-ketocholesterol ester core aldehydes. To assess this presumption, we examined the formation of 7-ketocholesterol and its ester core aldehydes by LC-MS following DNPH derivatization. Because the peak for the DNPH derivative of 7-ketocholesterol overlapped with the peaks for the DNPH derivatives of 5-oxovaleroyl-7-ketocholesterol and 9-oxononanoyl-7-ketocholesterol (Fig. 3A), we determined these products together as the total amounts of 7-ketocholesterol and its ester core aldehydes. As shown in Fig. 3B, in contrast to the formation of TBARS and the cholesteryl ester core aldehydes (Fig. 2), the yields of 7-ketocholesterol and its ester core aldehydes were relatively low during the early incubation period of 8 h; however, accompanied by the decrease in the 9-ONC and 5-OVC concentrations after 12 h, the formation of 7-ketocholesterol and its ester core aldehydes was dramatically enhanced. These data suggest that the consumption of the cholesteryl ester core aldehydes closely reflects, at least in part, the oxidation of the cholesterol moieties to their corresponding 7-keto derivatives. Covalent Binding of Cholesteryl and 7-Ketocholesteryl Ester Core Aldehydes to LDL ApoB—An alternative mechanism for the consumption of the cholesteryl ester core aldehydes may include their covalent binding to the apoB of LDL. During the oxidation of LDL, there is a progressive decrease in the amino groups. It has been generally assumed that this reflected the conjugation of short-chain aldehydes (e.g. malondialdehyde or 4-hydroxy-2-nonenol) with the lysine ϵ-amino groups (17Uchida K. Free Radic. Biol.

In the present study, we showed that IL-9 induced a transient phosphorylation of MEK, ERK2 and p90/RSK in murine lymphoid and mast cell lines. ERK2 in vitro kinase activity was also increased upon IL-9 stimulation. Similar results were obtained with IL-4, which had not been previously reported to activate these kinases in hematopoietic cells. Analysis of IL-9 receptor mutants showed that activation of the pathway was correlated with proliferation and with phosphorylation of the adaptor protein SHC, but not IRS2 or GAB2. The MEK inhibitor PD98059 reduced the mitogenic response to IL-4 and IL-9. In addition, expression of a dominant-negative RAS variant blocked ERK phosphorylation and significantly decreased Ba/F3 cell growth in the presence of IL-9, but did not affect expression of pim-1, a STAT target gene. In summary, these results indicate that IL-9 can transiently activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, which contributes to growth stimulation of hematopoietic cell lines."

https://openalex.org/W2002987728,The oncoprotein Qin is a member of the winged helix family of transcriptional regulators. The region C-terminal to its winged helix DNA-binding domain is required for transformation of chicken embryo fibroblasts. We isolated the corepressor TLE1 as a binding partner for Qin in a yeast two-hybrid screen and localized the TLE1-binding region to a 60 amino-acid stretch directly C-terminal of the winged helix domain of Qin. We show in vivo interaction of full-length Qin and TLE1 in a mammalian two-hybrid system. Coexpression of TLE1-binding Qin and TLE1 induces phosphorylation of TLE1. The DNA-binding activity of Qin is not required for this function. Binding of Qin to TLE1 correlates with Qin-induced transformation. Addition of the TLE1-binding motif WRPW to the C-terminus of a transformation-defective Qin deletion mutant restores binding to TLE1 and significantly enhances transformation. Expression of TLE1 in CEF by the retroviral vector RCAS enhances cell growth and induces formation of agar colonies.

Hydrogenases are metalloenzymes that catalyze the reaction H2 [rlhar2] 2 H+ + 2 e–. Three distinct groups of hydrogenases can be defined, depending on the metal content of the protein. The iron-only enzymes can be found in strict anaerobic bacteria and usually display high sensitivity toward oxygen. [Ni-Fe] and [Ni-Fe-Se] hydrogenases are mostly membrane-bound enzymes found in different kinds of bacteria. They are relatively heat and oxygen stable. A vast majority of known (characterized) hydrogenases belong in the [Ni-Fe] class (1Vignais P.M. Billoud B. Meyer J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 455-501Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The [Ni-Fe] enzymes are usually heterodimers involving a small (∼30 kDa) and a large (∼60 kDa) subunit with an overall molecular mass of ∼90–100 kDa. The metals are organized into two or three FeS clusters and a [Ni-Fe] binuclear center. The [Ni-Fe] binuclear center or its ligand environment is believed to be the hydrogen-binding site, though the exact binding location has not yet been determined. It is also generally accepted that the FeS clusters transfer electrons from the [Ni-Fe] binuclear center to the terminal electron acceptor, as evidenced from the crystal structure (2Volbeda A.

The ability of nitrogen laser flash-reduced methyl or benzyl viologen to initiate a redox transition of a redox protein has been demonstrated previously (14Czege J. Cs Bagyinka Kovács K.L. Photochem. Photobiol. 1989; 50: 697-700Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Here we report fast kinetic measurements of the hydrogenase enzyme reaction involving the use of an excimer laser flash-reduced redox dye. The results are evaluated on the assumption of an autocatalytic reaction in the hydrogenase kinetic cycle. Strain and Cultivation—Thiocapsa roseopersicina BBS was a kind gift from Prof. E. N. Kondratieva (Moscow State University, Moscow). The bacteria were grown under standard photosynthetic conditions as described earlier (15Cs Bagyinka Kovács K.L. Rak E. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested in the logarithmic phase of growth and were stored at–20 °C. Protein Purification—The wet cell paste of T. roseopersicina was treated with 90% cold (–20 °C) acetone, and the pellet was dried and stored at–4 °C. For purification, 15 g of pellet was dissolved in distilled water at 50 °C. The solution was centrifuged at 12,500 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was used. The first purification step comprised batch chromatography with Whatman DEAE DE-52 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The hydrogenase was washed off with 450 mm NaCl. The next step was butyl-Sepharose column chromatography in 1 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5 with 10% ammonium sulfate, using the Amersham Biosciences FPLC system. Hydrogenase eluted at ∼0% ammonium sulfate. Two Q-Sepharose Fast Flow columns were used for further purification steps using different buffer systems (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 50 mm MES, pH 5.5). In both cases, the hydrogenase eluted in the interval 350–500 mm NaCl. Final purification of the hydrogenase was achieved by 9% native preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The hydrogenase band was excised, and the electrophoretically pure enzyme was collected on a small Q-Sepharose column. Sample Preparation—Control samples containing 10 mm oxidized methyl viologen in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, were incubated overnight under anaerobic conditions. Before measurement, the sample was poured into a 0.1-mm quartz cell under anaerobic conditions. Samples containing 5 mg/ml hydrogenase (50 μm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer were incubated overnight in an anaerobe box (Coy Laboratories) containing ∼10% of hydrogen and 90% of nitrogen. After incubation, the hydrogenase was in activated form (Form C) as revealed by the EPR spectrum. The sample was poured into a 0.1-mm quartz cell and oxidized to Form B by adding a negligible volume of concentrated oxidized methyl viologen to a final concentration of 10 mm under anaerobic conditions. The cell was sealed with a quartz cover plate, which maintained anaerobic conditions for several hours. Kinetic Measurements—The nanosecond flash photolysis setup involved an excimer laser, a controlled-temperature sample holder, a Xenon lamp, a detector, and a DSA sampling oscilloscope connected to an IBM personal computer. The data collection, evaluation, and model fitting were performed with a specifically modified SPSERV program. 4Copyrighted in 2000 by Csaba Bagyinka. The program was modified so it would be able to supervise the DSA sampling oscilloscope and collect and process the data. The geometry of excitation was pseudo front face, and the analyzed volume was completely irradiated by the excitation beam from the excimer laser at 307 nm. The frequency of laser flashes was 10 Hz. The samples were slowly rotated so that each laser flash came into contact with a fresh portion of the sample. After each measurement, a new cylinder of the cell was selected to avoid saturation of the sample (for an explanation of the saturation, see “Results and Discussion”). In every experiment, the temperature of the cell was maintained at 25 °C. The wavelength of the measuring light beam for the methyl viologen (control) sample was varied in the range 360–680 nm in 20-nm steps. The bandwidth was 10 nm. 100 flashes were averaged and collected for each wavelength. The wavelength of the measuring light beam for hydrogenase samples was varied in the range 350–600 nm, and kinetic measurements were made at indicated wavelengths. The bandwidth was 30 nm. Data collected from 1000 individual flashes were averaged at each wavelength. The ability of nitrogen laser flash-reduced methyl viologen to initiate a fast redox transition in redox proteins was demonstrated earlier with flavocytochrome c552 as a model (14Czege J. Cs Bagyinka Kovács K.L. Photochem. Photobiol. 1989; 50: 697-700Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The methyl viologen was reduced by the nitrogen laser flash in less than 100 ns and donated electrons to the protein. Via monitoring of the absorption changes at different wavelengths, the rate constant of reduction and the difference spectrum of reduced and oxidized flavocytochrome c552 could be calculated. The disadvantage of using a nitrogen laser is that the excitation wavelength is close to the absorption minimum of oxidized methyl viologen. Accordingly, a high oxidized methyl viologen concentration had to be maintained to furnish a suitable amount of reduced methyl viologen after the laser flash. In this experiment, we preferred excitation with an excimer laser, which permitted a dramatic reduction of the methyl viologen concentration (from 160 mm, in the case of the nitrogen laser, to 10 mm in this case). On the use of a Nd-YAG laser with frequency quadrupling, the laser flash would excite the oxidized methyl viologen at almost exactly the absorption maximum (260 nm), allowing a further reduction of the methyl viologen concentration to 1 mm or even lower. 5Cs. Bagyinka and M. J. Maroney, unpublished data. This concentration is about the same as the concentration of the methyl viologen used in conventional activity measurements (16Der A. Cs Bagyinka Pali T. Kovács K.L. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In the control samples (containing no hydrogenase) the concentration of reduced methyl viologen produced after one excimer laser flash was 1.5 μm. The activation spectrum reconstructed from the signal amplitude of the samples containing only methyl viologen is in excellent agreement with the absorption spectrum of reduced methyl viologen (Fig. 1). The correspondence of the activation spectrum reconstructed from the signal amplitude demonstrates that methyl viologen reduction did occur. This confirms our previous findings with the nitrogen laser (14Czege J. Cs Bagyinka Kovács K.L. Photochem. Photobiol. 1989; 50: 697-700Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In the case of hydrogenase, it is more difficult to demonstrate a redox transition as compared with flavocytochrome c552. Hydrogenase is not only a redox protein but also a catalyst that produces hydrogen in this reaction. Because the volume of the sample is limited and hydrogen cannot leave it, after a while the back reaction of the hydrogenase should be taken into account. Thus, upon prolonged irradiation the forward and back reactions of the hydrogenase will come into equilibrium, and, therefore, no further net methyl viologen oxidation will be observed. Rotation of the sample holder and irradiation of a fresh portion of the sample can partially resolve this problem; but, after the entire surface of the cell has been irradiated, the whole sample becomes saturated with hydrogen gas, and no further disappearance of the reduced dye can be observed despite the presence of hydrogenase in the sample. Hence, one sample is suitable for only a limited number of experiments. The results of fast kinetic measurements on the hydrogenase-methyl viologen reaction at different wavelengths are presented in Fig. 2. The rate of change of the absorption of hydrogenase samples on reaction with methyl viologen is very characteristic. At every wavelength where reduced methyl viologen absorbs, a fast initial increase can be observed, followed by damped oscillatory behavior of the kinetic trace. The spectral dependence of the initial amplitude follows the methyl viologen absorption spectrum (there is no observable initial increase in Fig. 2 at 450- and 500-nm excitation, where the reduced methyl viologen absorption spectrum exhibits a minimum). This is exactly the same phenomenon as observed in hydrogenase-free samples. The measured rate of change of ΔOD for a hydrogenase/methyl viologen sample can be fitted with the sum of a fast and a slow decay curve (A1·exp(–t/τ1) and A2·exp(–t/τ2)) and two damped sinusoidal time functions (A3·sin(ω(t–t01)) ·exp(/τ3) and A4·sin(ω(t–t02)) ·exp(–t/τ4)) (Fig. 3). The amplitude of the fast decay curve (A1) reflects the methyl viologen spectrum, and the τ value for this exponential (τ1) remains constant throughout the wavelength range measured. The reduced methyl viologen concentration decreases as the hydrogenase takes over the electrons from the reduced methyl viologen. We therefore assign this process to the disappearance of reduced methyl viologen by the transfer of electrons to hydrogenase. The rate constant for the electron transfer from the reduced methyl viologen to the hydrogenase (calculated according to Ref. 14Czege J. Cs Bagyinka Kovács K.L. Photochem. Photobiol. 1989; 50: 697-700Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar) is k = 1.33(5)·108m–1 s–1. This value is of the same order of magnitude as the 109m–1 s–1 found for Chromatium vinosum hydrogenase by cyclic voltammetry (17Pershad R.H. Duff J.L.C. Heering H.A. Duin E.C. Albracht S.P.J. Armstrong F.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8992-8999Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We have not been able to assign the second decay to any process. This decay can be visualized at some wavelengths as a slight decrease in the kinetic trace with time. This is clearly pronounced at 350 nm in Fig. 2, where the damped oscillations are not around the zero value. The dependence of the amplitude (A2) on the wavelength demonstrates no clear-cut tendency. The τ value for this exponential (τ2) changes from 15,000 μs at 350 nm to 400 μs at 600 nm, but the fitting error for the high values was high (>50%). This change in A2 and τ2 indicates that the concentration of a corresponding reaction partner is changing during the measurement. Because we collected 1000 flashes with a frequency of 10 Hz in order to obtain a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio, a slow process can develop during the data collection (100 s), and a hydrogenase component, the substrate (the reduced viologen dye) or the product (the hydrogen gas) can diffuse over the cell and interfere with the following measurement. We therefore assign this process as a methodological artifact. The kinetic characteristics of the hydrogenase reaction, obtained by conventional activity measurements, led us to the conclusion that there should be an autocatalytic reaction step in the hydrogenase cycle or during the activation process.2,3 The autocatalytic interaction between two enzyme forms results in a conformational change of the enzyme, thereby activating it. We know from experimental results that such conformational changes are possible and that different conformations of hydrogenase exist. Following the changes in behavior of the hydrogenase under SDS-PAGE conditions, we were able to distinguish between three different states of the enzyme. The first conformer is present under aerobic conditions. Incubation of the enzyme under anaerobic conditions changes it to a different conformer, whereas incubation under hydrogen and methyl viologen transforms it into a third conformational state (18Kovacs K.L. Bagyinka. Cs. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 87: 407-411Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 19Kovacs K.L. Tigyi G. Thanh L.T. Lakatos S. Kiss Z. Cs Bagyinka J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 947-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Tigyi G. Cs Bagyinka Kovacs K.L. Biochimie (Paris). 1986; 68: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We do not know, however, if these conformational changes are associated with an autocatalytic reaction. It is very interesting to note, however, that, similarly to prion proteins, the hydrogenases are partially resistant to proteolytic digestion (20Tigyi G. Cs Bagyinka Kovacs K.L. Biochimie (Paris). 1986; 68: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The autocatalytic behavior of an enzyme reaction leads to an oscillating concentration of enzyme products contributing to the autocatalytic step. On the assumption of a simple autocatalytic reaction for hydrogenase activation, as shown in Reaction 1 (the autocatalytic step is between E2 and E3, as indicated by the curved back arrow), the changes in concentration of E2 and E3 would be reflected by a damped oscillation with ω2 = k1·k0·E1, if k1·k0·E1 « k22 and if we can neglect second-order terms (21Lotka A.J. J. Phys. Chem. 1910; 14: 271-274Crossref Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 22Romanovskii J.M. Stepanova N.V. Chernavskii D.S. Klimontovich V.L. Judina A.I. What Is Mathematical Biophysics? Prosveshchenie, Moscow1970: 82-84Google Scholar). E4 is the active form of the enzyme that is able to catalyze hydrogen evolution or hydrogen splitting. The reaction cycle closes back to E2 (recent model) or E3, the autocatalytic step being included in the enzyme cycle or left only in the activation process. k0 describes an intraenzyme reaction (probably a conformation change or charge redistribution), while k1 is the autocatalytic rate constant. It should be noted that, at the start of the experiment, the hydrogenase is in the E1 form, and this is not the oxidized form (Form A) of the enzyme (see sample preparation). The two oscillating concentrations observed in our experiment would correspond to E2 and E3 in the above model. The spectral dependence of the initial amplitudes of both of the damped sine curves can be described as the difference in absorption of the spectra of reduced and oxidized hydrogenase, which has a maximum at around 440 nm, though the fitting errors are rather large (Fig. 4). The spectral dependence of the amplitude of the second oscillation is the mirror image of the first. This implies that the oscillation occurs between an oxidized and a reduced form of hydrogenase. An alternative explanation is that, while the first oscillation proceeds from a reduced hydrogenase, the second oscillation originates from the reduced dye. As a consequence, it is possible that an enzyme form (if any) binding the reduced dye is responsible for this spectral component, or, alternatively, the methyl viologen plays the role of the autocatalytic partner2. To be able to select between these two possibilities, the rate of changes of the spectra of the hydrogenase-methyl viologen samples should be measured in smaller wavelength steps. Unfortunately, the saturation of the hydrogenase samples by hydrogen and the limited volume did not allow us to obtain more precise wavelength information by using the same hydrogenase sample. The frequencies (0.9 (1) ·103/s and 1.04 (9) ·103/s) of the two damped oscillations are very close (within the fitting error); only the phases differ. This is in accordance with the above autocatalytic model, where the two oscillations should have the same frequency. The k1·k0·E1 value calculated from the average ω of this fit is roughly 6·106 s–2. For the conditions discussed above, k0·k1·E1 « k22, which puts k2 at > 3·103 s–1. In the knowledge of the overall concentration of the enzyme and on the assumption that the enzyme is in the E1 form at the beginning of the experiment, k0·k1 ∼ 1011m–1 s–2. The rate of the autocatalytic process should be higher than or at least the same order of magnitude as that of the reaction with the real substrate (reduced methyl viologen in our case); otherwise, we would not be able to observe the autocatalytic behavior of the reaction because it would be very fast. A comparison of the reaction rate constant of the reduced methyl viologen binding, calculated from the fast decay of the reduced dye, puts k1 at around or higher than 108m–1 s–1. As a result, k0 < 103 s–1. In summary, the ability to use flash-reduced methyl viologen as a light-induced trigger in transient kinetic phenomena associated with the intermolecular electron transfer of hydrogenase has been demonstrated. The possibility of fitting the kinetics with a hydrogenase autocatalytic process has been demonstrated, and the kinetic constants of the autocatalytic reaction and the binding of methyl viologen or its release from hydrogenase have been determined. Limits of the kinetic constants relating to the intramolecular (intraenzyme) reactions have also been set."
https://openalex.org/W2007536519,"The human protein MDDX28 is a putative RNA helicase and a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein also localized to the mitochondria. Its localization is novel among RNA helicases. We have studied its intracellular targeting signals and show that the first 20 amino acids of MDDX28 are necessary and sufficient for both mitochondrial import and nuclear export of the protein. Mutation of the five leucines in the sequence to alanines abolished the mitochondrial targeting signal as well as greatly reducing the nuclear export signal, indicating that these signal sequences are highly overlapping. Two short stretches of basic amino acids separated by 44 residues were both necessary and sufficient for full nuclear localization. However, they were not absolutely essential, because the protein was present in 7% of the nuclei when both signals were mutated. This indicates that MDDX28 contains another unidentified weak nuclear localization signal(s). Three basic domains in the N-terminal half of the protein and its RNA binding ability were essential for nucleolar localization as well as transcription-inhibition-dependent localization to nuclear subcompartments. Two of these basic domains were the same as those constituting the nuclear localization signal, suggesting that they are responsible for bringing the protein into the nucleus to the sites of RNA binding. Our results indicate that MDDX28 nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling is dependent on the availability of nascent RNA."
