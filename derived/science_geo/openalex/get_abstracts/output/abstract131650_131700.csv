https://openalex.org/W2046187238,"Working memory is the process of maintaining an active representation of information so that it is available for use. In monkeys, a prefrontal cortical region important for spatial working memory lies in and around the principal sulcus, but in humans the location, and even the existence, of a region for spatial working memory is in dispute. By using functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans, an area in the superior frontal sulcus was identified that is specialized for spatial working memory. This area is located more superiorly and posteriorly in the human than in the monkey brain, which may explain why it was not recognized previously."

A mutation in the Arabidopsis thaliana CRY2 gene encoding a blue-light receptor apoprotein (CRY2) is allelic to the late-flowering mutant, fha . Flowering in cry2/fha mutant plants is only incompletely responsive to photoperiod. Cryptochrome 2 (cry2) is a positive regulator of the flowering-time gene CO , the expression of which is regulated by photoperiod. Analysis of flowering in cry2 and phyB mutants in response to different wavelengths of light indicated that flowering is regulated by the antagonistic actions of phyB and cry2."
https://openalex.org/W2016333231,"Viral infection is sometimes associated with the initiation or exacerbation of autoimmune disease, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. One proposed mechanism is that viral determinants that mimic host antigens trigger self-reactive T cell clones to destroy host tissue. An epitope expressed by a coat protein of herpes simplex virus-type 1 (HSV-1) KOS strain has now been shown to be recognized by autoreactive T cells that target corneal antigens in a murine model of autoimmune herpes stromal keratitis. Mutant HSV-1 viruses that lacked this epitope did not induce autoimmune disease. Thus, expression of molecular mimics can influence the development of autoimmune disease after viral infection."
https://openalex.org/W2017884988,"Increasing evidence suggests that mineralo- and glucocorticoids modulate cardiovascular homeostasis via the effects of circulating components generated within the adrenals but also through local synthesis. The aim of this study was to assess the existence of such a steroidogenic system in heart.Using the quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, the terminal enzymes of corticosterone and aldosterone synthesis (11β-hydroxylase and aldosterone synthase, respectively) were detected in the rat heart. This pathway was shown to be physiologically active, since production of aldosterone, corticosterone, and their precursor, deoxycorticosterone, was detected in both the homogenate and perfusate of isolated rat hearts using radioimmunoassay after Celite column chromatography. Perfusion of angiotensin II or adrenocorticotropin for 3 h increased aldosterone and corticosterone production and decreased deoxycorticosterone, suggesting that aldosterone and corticosterone are formed within the isolated heart from a locally present substrate.Chronic regulation of this intracardiac system was then examined. As in adrenals cardiac 11β-hydroxylase and aldosterone-synthase mRNAs were independently regulated by 1 week's treatment with either low sodium and high potassium diet (which increased aldosterone synthase mRNA level only), angiotensin II (which raised level of both mRNAs), or adrenocorticotropin (which stimulated the 11β-hydroxylase gene exclusively). Changes in cardiac steroid levels during treatment were not directly related to their plasma levels suggesting independent regulating mechanisms. This study, therefore, provides the first evidence for the existence of an endocrine cardiac steroidogenic system in rat heart and emphasizes its potential physiological and pathological relevance.

This study, therefore, provides the first evidence for the existence of an endocrine cardiac steroidogenic system in rat heart and emphasizes its potential physiological and pathological relevance. Glucocorticoids (corticosterone in the rat and cortisol in humans) and mineralocorticoids (mainly aldosterone in both species) are synthesized from cholesterol, predominantly in the adrenal cortex. The two forms of the cytochrome P-450 enzyme which catalyze the final step of these synthetic pathways are encoded by two closely related genesCYP11B1 and CYP11B2, respectively (1Nomura M. Morohashi K.I. Kirita S. Nonaka Y. Okamoto M. Nawata H. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 144-152Google Scholar) but display differences in their enzymatic activity, regulation, and tissular distribution (2Fardella C.E. Miller W.L. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1996; 16: 443-470Google Scholar). P-450 11β-hydroxylase (11β-OHase) 1The abbreviations used are: OHase, hydroxylase; DOC, 11-deoxycorticosterone; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; Aldo, aldosterone; Ang, angiotensin; RT, reverse transcriptase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s).1The abbreviations used are: OHase, hydroxylase; DOC, 11-deoxycorticosterone; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; Aldo, aldosterone; Ang, angiotensin; RT, reverse transcriptase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s). synthesizes corticosterone from 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) in the zona fasciculata reticularis and is mainly regulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). P-450 aldosterone (Aldo)-synthase, which catalyzes synthesis of aldosterone from DOC, is present only in the zona glomerulosa. Its activity is principally controlled by angiotensin II (Ang II) and potassium and more weakly by ACTH and sodium (3Tremblay A. Waterman M.R. Parker K.L. Lehoux J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2245-2251Google Scholar, 4Shibata H. Ogishima T. Mitani F. Suzuki H. Murukami M. Saruta T. Ishimura Y. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2534-2539Google Scholar). While ACTH is a chronic inhibitor of aldosterone secretion, it is also a potent stimulator of its synthesis in some acute conditions (5Biglieri E.G. Arteaga E. Kater C.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1987; 512: 426-437Google Scholar, 6Aguilera G. Fujita K. Catt K.J. Endocrinology. 1981; 108: 522-528Google Scholar). Two other P-450c11 genes, CYP11B3 and CYP11B4 were recently cloned from a rat genomic library (7Mukai K. Imai M. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9130-9137Google Scholar). CYP11B3 was 97% identical to CYP11B1 and encoded an enzyme with activities intermediate between those of 11β-OHase and Aldo-synthase (8Mellon S.H. Bair S.R. Monis H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1643-1649Google Scholar), whereas CYP11B4 appeared to be a pseudogene (7Mukai K. Imai M. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9130-9137Google Scholar).Besides this classical adrenal biosynthetic pathway, extra-adrenal sites of steroid hormone production have been identified (9Casey M.L. MacDonald P.C. Endocr. Rev. 1982; 3: 396-403Google Scholar), for example in brain (10Mellon S.H. Deschepper C.F. Brain. Res. 1993; 629: 283-292Google Scholar) and more recently in vessels. Indeed, aldosterone and corticosterone production and 11β-OHase and Aldo-synthase gene expression have been demonstrated in mesenteric rat artery and in endothelial and smooth muscle cells isolated from human pulmonary artery (11Takeda Y. Miyamori I. Yoneda T. Iki K. Hatakeyama H. Blair I.A. Hsieh F.Y. Takeda R. Endocrinology. 1996; 135: 2283-2286Google Scholar, 12Takeda Y. Miyamori I. Yoneda T. Iki K. Hatakeyama H. Blair I.A.

Moreover, Hatakeyama et al. (13Hatakeyama H. Miyamori I. Fujita T. Takeda Y. Takeda R. Yamamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24316-24320Google Scholar) showed that this vascular aldosterone potentiates Ang II-induced hypertrophy of cultured vascular smooth muscle cells, suggesting a physiological role for this locally generated steroid. To date, there is no information regarding aldosterone or corticosterone synthesis within the heart. However, Knox and Lockett (14Knox J.R. Lockett M.F. J. Endocrinol. 1969; 43: 315-316Google Scholar) have previously demonstrated that isolated hearts produce a substance whose physicochemical properties are consistent with those of aldosterone. The detection of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity (which produces progesterone from pregnenolone) in rat heart also indicates the potential for steroid metabolism in cardiac tissue (15Zhao H.F. Labrie C. Simard J. de Launoit Y. Trudel C. Martel C. Rheaume E. Dupont E. Luu-The V. Pelletier G. Labrie F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 583-593Google Scholar).Several lines of evidence indicate that glucocorticoids and aldosterone may influence cardiac function. (i) Glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors have been identified in human and rodent heart (16Agarval M.K. Philippe M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1979; 11: 115-126Google Scholar, 17Funder J.W. Duval D. Meyer P. Endocrinology. 1973; 93: 1300-1308Google Scholar, 18Lombes M. Oblin M.E. Gasc J.M. Baulieu E. Farman N. Bonvalet J.P. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 503-510Google Scholar); (ii) 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which converts glucocorticoids to their inactive 11-keto metabolites and confers mineralocorticoid specificity to aldosterone target tissues (19Funder J.W. Pearce P.T. Smith R. Smith A.I. Science. 1988; 242: 583-585Google Scholar), has also been detected in cardiac cells (20Walker B.R. Yau J.L. Brett L.P. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 3305-3312Google Scholar); (iii) aldosterone triggers cardiac fibrosis (21Brilla C.G. Pick R. Tan L.B. Janicki J.S. Weber K.T. Circ. Res. 1990; 67: 1355-1364Google Scholar, 22Robert V. Nguyen V.T. Cheav S.L. Mouas C. Swynghedauw B. Delcayre C. Hypertension. 1994; 24: 30-36Google Scholar) and electrolyte imbalance (23Campbell S.E. Janicki J.S. Mastubara B.B. Weber K.T. Am. J. Hypertens. 1993; 6: 487-495Google Scholar, 24Ikeda U. Hyman R. Smith T.W. Medford R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12058-12066Google Scholar); and (iv) glucocorticoids regulate the cardiac expression of a subset of steroid-responsive genes (25Lindpaintner K. Manwen J. Nierdermaier N. Wilhelm M.J. Ganten D. Circ. Res. 1990; 67: 564-573Google Scholar, 26Della Bruna R. Ries S. Himmelstoss C. Kurtz A. J. Hypertens. 1995; 13: 763-769Google Scholar). We hypothesize that mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids modulate cardiac homeostasis not only via the effects of circulating components generated within the adrenal glands, but also through local synthesis. The aim of this study was, therefore, to assess the existence of such a local system in the rat heart.To test this hypothesis, we investigated 11β-OHase and Aldo-synthase gene expression in rat heart by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription. We then measured basal aldosterone and corticosterone production in the isolated rat heart using Celite column chromatography coupled with radioimmunoassay. Finally, we examined the regulation of this cardiac endocrine system using 1 week of treatment with a low sodium/high potassium diet, Ang II, or ACTH. This study provides direct evidence that local pathways of aldosterone and corticosterone synthesis exist in rat heart. Furthermore, this cardiac steroid production is regulated by the classical stimuli of adrenal steroid biosynthesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimalsThe study, which was conducted in accordance with both institutional guidelines and those formulated by the European community for the use of experimental animals (L358-86/609/EEC), was performed using 2-month-old male Wistar rats (Iffa Credo, Lyon, France). For chronic experiments (protocol 2 below), animals were randomly divided into four groups, each group receiving one of the following treatments: (i) a low sodium and high potassium group (0.01% Na+ and 2% K+ in chow); (ii) Ang II (100 ng/kg/min) infused via a subcutaneous osmotic minipump (Alzet 2002, Charles River, Paris, France); (iii) ACTH (5 ng/kg/min) infused by osmotic minipump; and (iv) a sham-operated group, with an osmotic minipump containing only physiological serum. Systolic blood pressure was measured by the tail-cuff method. After 1 week of treatment, rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg), and blood was collected for measurements of aldosterone, corticosterone, and deoxycorticosterone concentration and renin activity.Cardiac PerfusionHearts were excised and immediately dropped into ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer. After cessation of beating, hearts were rapidly mounted on an aortic cannula, and retrograde perfusion was initiated as described previously (27Delcayre C. Klug D. Nguyen V.T. Mouas C. Swynghedauw B. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: H1537-H1545Google Scholar). Briefly, hearts were perfused with modified Krebs-Henseleit solution (pH 7.4, 37 °C) containing (in mm) NaCl 120, KCl 5, NaHCO3 25, MgSO4 1.2, KH2PO4 1.2, CaCl2 1.2, glucose 11, sodium pyruvate 5, and bovine serum albumin 0.15% (fraction V, Pentex, Miles), oxygenated with a 95% O2, 5% CO2 gas mixture. Contractile parameters, oxygen consumption, and coronary flow were continuously recorded until cardiac perfusion was completed.Experimental Protocol 1In this set of experiments, hearts from control rats were perfused for 3 h under different conditions. To wash out plasma components from the heart and allow equilibration, hearts were perfused during the first 15 min at a pressure of 60 mm Hg without recycling of the buffer. They were then perfused for 3 h with 100 ml of recirculating buffer containing either Ang II (10−8m) or ACTH (10−8m) (Sigma, St. Quentin Fallavier, France). Thus, time 0 of perfusion indicates the onset of Ang II or ACTH perfusion. 10-ml samples of cardiac perfusate were collected at times 0, 1, 2, and 3 h, and steroid concentrations were corrected for volume variation due to sample removal.At times 0 or 3 h, perfusion was stopped, and the heart was homogenized in 2 volumes of methanol using an Ultra-Turrax apparatus and centrifuged for 15 min at 3000 × g. The recovered supernatant was used for steroid assays. 3000 cpm of each tritiated steroid were added before homogenization to assess steroid loss. Recovery from tissue was 80–90%, and results were corrected accordingly. The protein concentration of cardiac homogenate was determined according to the method of Bradford (28Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar), with bovine serum albumin used as a standard.Many of the effects of Ang II and ACTH have well characterized dose-response curves. To assess a putative dose-related effects of Ang II and ACTH on cardiac steroid production, hearts were perfused with increasing peptide concentrations (10−10, 10−9, 10−8, and 10−7m) for 3 h, as described above.Experimental Protocol 2Hearts excised from rats treated for 1 week with a low Na+/high K+ diet, Ang II, or ACTH were perfused without recycling the buffer. After the initial wash out and equilibration (15 min), 10 ml of perfusate were collected, perfusion was stopped, and hearts were homogenized as described above.Hormone AssaySteroids were extracted from the collected perfusates using chloroform. Extracted perfusate and cardiac homogenate were dried under vacuum and redissolved in a 0.25 m phosphate buffer (pH 7) containing sodium azide (2 g/liter) with 3000 cpm of each tritiated steroid to calculate recovery. Steroids were separated in a column composed of Celite and silica gel (Celite 545, Silica Gel 60, Fluka, Paris, France) using a polarity gradient of isoacetane and ethyl acetate. Recovery ranged from 40 to 60%, and results were corrected for this. Levels of aldosterone, corticosterone, and deoxycorticosterone were determined in duplicate by radioimmunoassay using rabbit polyclonal antibodies. The cross-reactivity of each specified antibodies with different biological steroids has been previously described (29Aupetit-Faisant B. Battaglia C. Zenatti M. Emeric-Blanchouin N. Legrand J.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 76: 38-43Google Scholar). Radioimmunoassay was performed in a 0.25m phosphate buffer (pH 7), containing sodium azide (2 g/liter) and gelatin (1 g/liter). The accuracy of each series of assays was determined by the addition of various known amounts of unlabeled steroid. To verify that the hormones released into perfusate were not degraded in Krebs buffer, exogenous steroids were added during perfusion.Incubation of Cardiac Homogenate with 11-[3H]DeoxycorticosteroneTo confirm that immunoassays measured bona fide steroids and did not cross-react with other steroidal compounds, cardiac homogenate was incubated with [3H]DOC. Briefly, hearts from control rats were perfused with or without Ang II (10−8m) as described in experimental protocol 1. After 3 h, perfusion was stopped, and the heart was minced with scissors and washed twice in physiological serum. The heart was then homogenized using a chilled glass homogenizer in ice-cold buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.25m sucrose, 15 mm malate, 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm KH2PO4, 0.075% bovine serum albumin (fraction V, Pentex, Miles), and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 1 μmpepstatin, 1 μm leupeptin, and 0.1 μmaprotinin). Insoluble matter was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was then incubated aerobically for 1 h at 37 °C in 2 ml of buffer (composition as above) containing 90 pmol of deoxy-[1α,2α-3H]corticosterone (specific activity, 47 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp., Les Ulis, France), as described previously (30Aupetit B. Accarie C. Emeric N. Vonarx V. Legrand J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 752: 73-78Google Scholar). Steroids were then extracted by chloroform and separated as described under “Hormone Assay.” Unlabeled steroids were added with chloroform to assess steroid loss. The radioactivity of the corresponding fraction was counted using a scintillation counter. Aliquots of each fraction were used for radioimmunoassay to assay unlabeled steroids and to calculate recovery. The protein concentration was determined according to the method of Bradford (28Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar), with bovine serum albumin used as a standard.Total RNA ExtractionEach heart was separated into its four constituent chambers. Total RNA was extracted from these cardiac tissues and the adrenal glands according to Trizol reagent protocol (Life Technologies, Inc., Cergy Pontoise, France). The yields of total RNA extracted were similar in all four cardiac chambers, in control and treated hearts, and in nonperfused and perfused hearts. The quality of RNA was confirmed by ethidium bromide staining in 1% agarose gel.Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)PrimersOligonucleotide primers (Bioprobe Systems, Montreuil, France) were chosen in homologous parts of the coding region of 11β-OHase and Aldo-synthase genes (Fig. 1, panel A). The sense primer was 5′-ACTCCGTGGCCTGAGACG-3′ (position 363–381 bp, exon II) and the antisense primer 5′-CTGTGTGGTGGACTTGAA-3′ (position 709–691 bp, exon IV) according to the sequence published by Nomura et al.(1Nomura M. Morohashi K.I. Kirita S. Nonaka Y. Okamoto M. Nawata H. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 144-152Google Scholar). We obtained a PCR product of 346 bp for each transcript after RT-PCR amplification (Fig. 2 A,left panel).Figure 2Panel A, RT-PCR analysis of cardiac 11β-hydroxylase and Aldo-synthase mRNA levels in the four cardiac chambers of adult rat heart. 400 and 800 ng of total RNA with 1500 molecules of internal standard were assayed for 32 cycles. Amplified products were electrophoresed onto a 5% polyacrylamide gel. After RT-PCR amplification, we obtained a PCR product of 346 bp for each transcript (left panel). The two PCR products are then size-differentiated using XhoI, which hydrolyzed the Aldo-synthase PCR product into two fragments of 177 and 169 bp (right panel).

(7Mukai K. Imai M. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9130-9137Google Scholar). CYP11B3-specific primers are compared with the 11β-OHase nucleotide sequence in Fig. 1, panel B. We obtained a PCR product of 445 bp after RT-PCR amplification (see Fig. 3), as described previously (8Mellon S.H. Bair S.R. Monis H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1643-1649Google Scholar).Figure 3RT-PCR analysis of CYP11B3mRNA levels in heart and adrenals of 21-day- and 2-month-old rats. 500 and 1000 ng of total RNA were assayed for 32 cycles.

The PCR product was subcloned into a pSP(64) poly(A) vector (Promega, Charbonnières, France). Sequence analysis of the subcloned cDNA (Euro Séquences Gènes Services, Montigny le Bretonneux, France) confirmed 100% identity with the published sequence of 11β-OHase (1Nomura M. Morohashi K.I. Kirita S. Nonaka Y. Okamoto M. Nawata H. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 144-152Google Scholar). Since the cardiac 11β-OHase mRNA level was 7-fold higher than that of Aldo-synthase, we subcloned 11β-OHase cDNA. The 11β-OHase PCR product was then linearized with NcoI and ligated with a 100-bp insert (PvuI/ScaI fragment of pBluescript II SK phagemid). The internal standard was obtained using SP6 RNA polymerase after template linearization with PstI, and the transcription reaction was performed using labeled UTP as a precursor. Transcript concentration was determined after measurement of the radioactivity incorporated into the RNA product. After RT-PCR, we obtained a PCR product of 446 bp (Fig. 2 A, left panel).Quantitative RT-PCR ProtocolTotal RNA was incubated with a fixed amount of internal standard and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus RT (Life Technologies, Cergy pontoise, France) in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dNTP, 0.2 μm oligo-p(dT)15primer (Boehringer Mannheim, Meylan, France), and 50 units of RNase inhibitor (Promega, Charbonnières, France). This reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min at 25 °C, then for 75 min at 40 °C, and the reaction was stopped by heating for 3 min at 94 °C. The resultant single strand cDNA was amplified using 0.5 μm of each sense and antisense primer and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim, Meylan, France) in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 3.75 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dNTP, and 0.01% gelatin. 32 and 30 amplification cycles were undertaken for heart and adrenals, respectively, as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing of primers at 61 °C for 1 min, and primer extension at 72 °C for 1 min. A trace of [α-P32]dCTP was included in the PCR reaction for quantification of the different products. The number of C residues present in each fragment (11β-OHase = 69, Aldo-synthase = 74, and internal standard = 95) was taken into account for this quantification.CYP11B3 mRNA amplification was carried out using the same protocole but annealing of the CYP11B3 primer was performed at 59 °C for 32 cycles.Differentiation by Enzymatic Digestion of 11β-OHase and Aldo-Synthase PCR ProductsAfter RT-PCR amplification, we obtained a PCR product of 346 bp for each transcript as expected (Fig. 2 A, left panel). The two PCR products were then size-differentiated using XhoI, which hydrolyzed the Aldo-synthase PCR product into two fragments of 177 and 169 bp.XhoI did not affect the PCR products of 11β-OHase or the internal standard (Figs. 1, panel A, and 2 A,right panel). Digestion efficiency was verified in preliminary experiments using other restriction enzymes (TaqI, MaeII) and the hydrolyzed 11β-OHase PCR product (PstI, PvuII).PCR products were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel, and radioactive signals were analyzed using a computer-based imaging system (Bas 1000, Fuji Medical Systems, Clichy, France).Validity of the RT-PCR Method(Data not shown.) Cardiac mRNA concentrations were determined after 32 cycles,i.e. within the exponential amplification phase of both cardiac mRNA and standard RNA sequences. Indeed, a linear increase in the number of log amplified target molecules was observed between 28 and 33 PCR cycles. The amplification efficiency was the same (93%) for 11β-OHase, Aldo-synthase, and their specific internal standard as demonstrated by their parallel amplification curves. The absence of competition between endogenous and synthetic RNA was indicated by the linear relationship between the amount of radioactivity incorporated into the PCR products and the initial amount of RNA. In contrast, the radioactivity incorporated into the internal standard of each tube remained unchanged. These PCR tests were also performed for adrenal tissue RNA.Statistical AnalysisStatistical significance was estimated between two groups using one-way analysis of variance and group-to-group comparison using Student's t test. Tests were considered significant whenp < 0.05. All values presented are the mean ± S.E.RESULTS11β-OHase and Aldo-Synthase mRNA Levels and Steroid Production in Normal HeartsCardiac Gene Expression11β-OHase and Aldo-synthase mRNA levels were higher in atria than in ventricles (1.5- and 1.3-fold for the 11β-OHase mRNA level and 1.3- and 1.4-fold for the Aldo-synthase mRNA level in right and left atriaversus right and left ventricles, respectively). 11β-OHase mRNA levels were 7-fold higher than those of Aldo-synthase in each cardiac cavity (Fig. 2, A and B).CYP11B3 gene expression was undetectable in the heart of 2-month-old rats (Fig. 3). In contrast, a low level of CYP11B3 mRNA was observed in the heart of 21-day-old rats.

Thus, an intriguing question is whether such proteins can be forced to fold by adding solutes found in the cells of some organisms.

The issue of shifting a protein or domain from an unfolded to a folded ensemble is a topic of interest not only for these proteins, but also for a host of marginally stable proteins. A question of interest is whether such proteins can be induced to adopt unique and functionally important ordered structures by addition of solutes found in the cells of some organisms. According to Anfinsen, “The native conformation of protein is determined by the totality of interatomic interactions and by the amino acid sequence, in a given environment ” (10Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Scopus (5107) Google Scholar). Although the statement by Anfinsen acknowledges the importance of both amino acid sequence and the physiological milieu in defining the native (Gibbs energy minimum) conformation of proteins, the overwhelming emphasis in the protein folding field has been on the interatomic interaction aspect of the process (11Dill K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7133-7155Google Scholar). Nature, however, has not ignored the powerful effect that the solution can have on protein stability and has developed the strategy of using specific solutes (called organic osmolytes) to maintain the structure of proteins in cells exposed to denaturing environmental stresses (12Yancey P.H. Clark M.E. Hand S.C. Bowlus R.D. Somero G.N. Science. 1982; 217: 1214-1222Google Scholar). Thus, through the power of natural selection, solutes were evolved that have exceptional ability to promote the native states of proteins in the presence of denaturing stresses. The implication is that in the absence of denaturing stresses, osmolytes continue to exert a force to fold proteins that are highly unstable in an aqueous environment. Two examples of proteins that exist in the unfolded state in buffer are considered. These two unfolded proteins are forced to fold cooperatively into native-like species by the presence of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), 1The abbreviations used are: TMAO, trimethylamineN-oxide; RCAM-T1, reduced and carboxyamidated ribonuclease T1; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; wt, wild type; SNase, staphylococcal nuclease T62P, SNase mutant protein. a solute found in the cells of elasmobranchs that stabilizes the intracellular proteins against the presence of urea (12Yancey P.H. Clark M.E. Hand S.C. Bowlus R.D. Somero G.N. Science. 1982; 217: 1214-1222Google Scholar, 13Wang A. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9101-9108Google Scholar). The two proteins are: 1) reduced and carboxyamidated ribonuclease T1 (RCAM-T1), a chemical modification that releases conformational constraints and greatly stabilizes the unfolded state relative to the native state, and 2) staphylococcal nuclease mutant protein (T62P), in which replacement of a threonine with proline in a helix greatly destabilizes the native state relative to the unfolded ensemble. We show that TMAO folds these two highly unfolded proteins to species that acquire functional activity and secondary and tertiary structures much like that of wild type or unmodified protein. Reduction and carboxyamidation of RNase T1 was performed using iodoacetamide, in the manner described by Mücke and Schmid (14Mücke M. Schmid F.X. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7848-7854Google Scholar). Ribonuclease T1 with all four cysteines carboxyamidated migrated as a single band in native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and as a single peak when chromatographed on a Phenomenex Biosep SEC-S3000 gel-filtration column. The assay for free thiols with Ellman's reagent was negative. RNase T1 and RCAM-T1 concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 278 nm (1 mg/ml = 1.9 absorbance units). Activity measurements of RNase T1 and RCAM-T1 are described in Ref. 15Kiefhaber T. Quaas R. Hahn U. Schmid F.X. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3053-3061Google Scholar. Proteins equilibrated at different concentrations of TMAO (in 30 mm MOPS, 0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.0, 25 °C) for 4 h was diluted 20-fold into the same TMAO buffer containing 75 μm GpC at 25 °C. The resulting increase in absorbance at 257 nm caused by cleavage of GpC was recorded and the initial velocity presented in terms of ΔA257/min/mg of protein. TMAO-induced folding of RCAM-T1 (10 μg/ml) was monitored using a Spex FluoroMax spectrofluorimeter and involved intrinsic fluorescence (278 or 295 nm excitation and 319 nm emission) measurements in solution (30 mm MOPS, 0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) as a function of TMAO concentration. All measurements were made using 1-cm square cuvettes thermostatted at 25 °C, and all data were corrected for the contribution of the respective solute concentrations. CD spectra were recorded at 40 nm/min in 0.1-cm cuvettes (0.3 mg/ml protein) for the peptide region (<250 nm), and in 1-cm cuvettes (1.5 mg/ml protein concentration) in the aromatic region (310–260 nm) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, buffer at 25 °C. The bandwidth was 1.5 nm, and each spectrum shown is the result of eight spectra accumulated and averaged. All spectra were corrected for the contributions of the respective buffers. Size exclusion chromatography was carried out using a Phenomenex Biosep SEC-S3000 HPLC gel filtration column 300 × 7.80 mm, equilibrated in buffer (30 mmMOPS, 0.2 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.0) in the absence or presence of the indicated concentration of TMAO at 25 °C. Prior to their injection, RNase T1 and RCAM-T1 samples (10 μg/ml) were incubated using the buffer and [TMAO] conditions for chromatography equilibration. In all experiments the samples were incubated at 25 °C at least 4 h before measurement. Purification and specific activity measurements of wild type SNase and T62P mutant protein were performed as described in Ref. 16Shortle D. Meeker A.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 936-944Google Scholar. Protein solutions equilibrated at different concentrations of TMAO (in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mmCaCl2, pH 8.8) for 30 min were then diluted 60-fold into assay solutions (thermostatted at 25 °C) containing the same buffer and solute concentrations as the sample. The resulting increase in absorbance at 260 nm caused by the cleavage of DNA was recorded and the initial slope presented in terms of ΔA260/min/mg was used as a measure of specific activity. Wild type SNase and T62P mutant concentrations were determined by UV absorption at 280 nm (1 mg/ml = 0.93 absorbance units), purity was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and molecular weight was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. The fluorescence spectra of SNase samples were collected upon excitation at 278 nm (in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mNaCl, 10 mm CaCl2 containing 50 μg/ml protein (1-cm path length) thermostatted at 25 °C in a Spex FluoroMax spectrofluorimeter). All spectra were corrected for contributions from the solution. Here, we provide two examples of proteins whose unfolded ensemble dominates in buffer, but in the presence of TMAO are forced to fold into native-like species having significant functional activity. The first of these two protein examples is RCAM-T1, whose unfolded state is favored by a large gain in conformational entropy derived from disruption of disulfide bonds. With RNase T1, it has been estimated that reduction and carboxyamidation of its two disulfide bonds (RCAM-T1) destabilizes the protein by nearly 9 kcal/mol, resulting in a chemically modified protein that is extensively unfolded (17Pace C.N. Grimsley G.R. Thomson J.A. Barnett B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11820-11825Google Scholar). Size exclusion chromatography experiments in Fig. 1 A show, from the elution volumes of RNase T1 and RCAM-T1, that RCAM-T1 has a significantly expanded structure relative to RNase T1. At TMAO concentration above 2.5 m, both RNase T1 and RCAM-T1 are found to have identical elution volumes (see Fig. 1 B), indicating that the two proteins have identical degrees of structural compactness under these conditions. The close correspondence of the fluorescence emission spectra of RCAM-T1 in buffer and RNase T1 in 6 mguanidinium chloride strongly indicates extensive unfolding in both cases (Fig. 2 A). But in the presence of 2.7 m TMAO, the fluorescence emission spectrum of RCAM-T1 changes dramatically to that of native RNase T1. This result shows that both wt RNase T1 and RCAM-T1 are folded in the presence of 2.7 m TMAO and that both are essentially equivalent in terms of their fluorescence properties. The fluorescence emission data of RCAM-T1 given as a function of TMAO concentration in Fig. 2 B illustrates that TMAO induces RCAM-T1 to fold in a cooperative manner, reaching a maximum in folding at concentrations above 2.5 m TMAO.Figure 2A, fluorescence emission spectra (278 nm excitation) of RCAM-T1 in the presence (—) and absence of 2.7m TMAO (– – – –); RNase T1 in 2.7 m TMAO (- - - -) and in 6 m GuHCl (— — — —) all containing 10 μg/ml protein. All spectra were corrected for solution background contributions. B, reversible TMAO-induced folding of RCAM-T1 monitored at 319 nm emission with excitation at 278 nm (□) or excitation at 295 nm (○). C, specific activities of RNase T1 (▵) and RCAM-T1 are presented as a function of TMAO concentration. Specific activity for RCAM-T1 (○) has already been normalized with respect to the effect of TMAO on the specific activity of RNase T1. The dashed line in B and the solid line in C are nonlinear least squares best fits of the data using the linear extrapolation model (ΔG = ΔG 0 − m[denaturant]) (29Pace C.N. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 3: 1-43Google Scholar) analyzed according to Santoro and Bolen (30Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Google Scholar). To apply the linear extrapolation model to the specific activity (SA) data, it has been assumed that specific activity of RCAM-T1 represents the amount of folded protein, SAmin is the specific activity in the absence of TMAO, and SAmax is the maximum specific activity represented by the total amount of folded protein in the limit of high concentration of TMAO. At any fixed concentration of TMAO in the transition zone, the fraction of folded active protein (N) becomes (N = (SA − SAmin)/(SAmax − SAmin)), and the fraction of denatured protein (U) can be determined from (U = (SAmax − SA)/(SAmax − SAmin)). Apparent equilibrium constants for the N ⇆ U equilibrium can be obtained from the U/N ratio at each concentration of TMAO and expressed as ΔG versus [TMAO] as given by Pace (29Pace C.N. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 3: 1-43Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Using GpC as a substrate, the specific activity of RNase T1 is not observed to change substantially as a function of TMAO concentration (see Fig. 2 C). By contrast, the specific activity of RCAM-T1 increases some 50-fold from its level of around 0.4% of the specific activity of wt RNase T1 in the absence of TMAO, to a specific activity in 2.7 m TMAO that is approximately 20% of the wt RNase T1 enzyme under these conditions. So, despite the fact that the folding of RCAM-T1 accommodates four carboxyamido groups into its compact structure, a substantial amount of catalytic activity is observed for this protein. It is important to note that regardless of the parameter used in monitoring the stability of the protein (fluorescence or specific activity), the sign and magnitude of the ΔG 0 values derived from the data in Fig. 2,B and C, show RCAM-T1 is thermodynamically unstable in buffer solution (ΔG 0 = −2.23 kcal/mol (m = −1.77) from fluorescence data, ΔG 0 = −2.48 kcal/mol (m = −1.70) from activity measurement). In terms of secondary and tertiary structure, Figs.3, A and B, illustrate that spectrally, RCAM-T1 is dramatically different from RNase T1. But in the presence of 2.7 m TMAO, the secondary (Fig. 3 A) and tertiary (Fig. 3 B) folded characteristics of RCAM-T1 become very much like those of native RNase T1, indicating that the overall fold of RCAM-T1 in TMAO is very similar to that of wild type RNase T1. In the case of RCAM-T1, the denatured state is favored by the increase in entropy of the denatured state, brought about by disruption of the disulfide bonds. Protein destabilization can also be brought about by mutations that specifically destabilize the native state while having much less of an effect on the denatured ensemble. Such is the case with the SNase mutant T62P, which we present as another example of TMAO induced protein folding. The native state of the SNase mutant is extensively disrupted by putting proline in the center of the helix that is packed against the protein's β sheet. The fact that the fluorescence emission spectrum of T62P in buffer is very much like that of wt SNase obtained in the presence of 6 m guanidinium chloride (see Fig. 4 A) illustrates that T62P is intrinsically unfolded in buffer solution. Upon gel filtration chromatography, the elution volume of T62P in buffer is equivalent to a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 34 kDa, while the elution volume of wt SNase (molecular mass of 17 kDa) is equivalent to a protein of 16 kDa (data not shown). However, upon dialyzing T62P against 2.5 m TMAO in buffer, the emission spectrum of mutant protein changes dramatically, giving a fluorescence wavelength maximum equal to that of wt SNase native protein (Fig. 4 A). In comparison with the wt SNase fluorescence spectrum, T62P exhibits a lower quantum yield. The lower quantum yield of T62P arises from protein-protein association and may also be due to differences in the folded structures of the mutant and wt SNase. Regardless of the reasons for fluorescence differences between wt SNase and T62P, these data strongly suggest that TMAO forces T62P to fold. The specific activity of T62P in the absence of TMAO is 0.08% of wt SNase, but in the presence of increasing amounts of TMAO, the specific activity of T62P increases some 2 orders of magnitude. The specific activity of T62P increases to about 90% of the specific activity of wt SNase in 2.7 m TMAO, while the specific activity of wt SNase itself decreases by about an order of magnitude in going from 0 to 2.7 m TMAO (see Fig. 4 B). If the specific activity of T62P is normalized to the specific activity of wt SNase, the normalized data in Fig. 4 B can be fitted in the same manner as described for RCAM-T1. Fitting gives ΔG 0 = −4.02 kcal/mol (m = −2.55) and the large negative ΔG 0 shows that the fraction of folded (active) T62P is extremely small in the absence of TMAO. Moreover, ΔG changes from −4.0 kcal/mol in buffer solution to +2.9 kcal/mol in 2.7 m TMAO, which represents a shift in equilibrium from the unfolded ensemble to “native” state of nearly 5 orders of magnitude. TMAO induces both RCAM-T1 and T62P to fold, despite the fact that their folding motifs are very different, and their reasons for being unfolded (loss of disulfide bonds in RCAM-T1 and destabilization of the native state in T62P) are also very different. The ability to force proteins to fold, regardless of the source of the instability, suggests TMAO is a versatile folding agent, a property compatible with its role in elasmobranchs (13Wang A. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9101-9108Google Scholar). By means of transfer free energy measurements, we have recently shown that the ability of TMAO to increase the driving force for protein folding is due to its solvophobic effect on the peptide backbone exposed in the unfolded state (13Wang A. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9101-9108Google Scholar). Folding of thermodynamically unstable protein can be forced by a number of naturally occurring osmolytes, and the efficacy of these osmolytes in folding is related to the relative strengths of their solvophobic effect on the peptide backbone, with TMAO being the most effective osmolyte. 2I. Baskakov and D. W. Bolen, manuscript in preparation. The recent demonstration that synthetic polymers assume helical structures through the action of solvophobic effects highlights the importance of this force (18Nelson J.C. Saven J.G. Moore J.S. Wolynes P.G. Science. 1997; 277: 1793-1796Google Scholar). In addition, it has long been known that organic solutes (e.g. chloroethanol and trifluoroethanol) can drive formation of helices in peptides and proteins, but this leads to non-native species (19Timasheff S.N. Acc. Chem. Res. 1970; 3: 62-68Google Scholar). The driving force for helix formation has been attributed to the solvophobic (highly unfavorable) interaction of alcohol with the peptide backbone, in combination with favorable alcohol-side chain interactions (20Nozaki Y. Tanford C. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2211-2217Google Scholar). Our measurements show that the exposed (hydrophobic) side chains are little affected by TMAO, and in fact, the propensities of hydrophobic groups to interact with solvent are essentially the same in water as they are in TMAO solution (13Wang A. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9101-9108Google Scholar). The commonly held explanation of spontaneous folding of proteins in dilute buffer stresses hydrophobic interactions as important in folding to the native state (11Dill K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7133-7155Google Scholar), and because TMAO has little effect on hydrophobic interactions, the rules for protein folding that occur in dilute buffer are unchanged by the presence of TMAO. The solvophobic effect of TMAO on the peptide backbone makes the unfolded state of protein in osmolyte solution very unfavorable relative to the folded state (21Lin T.-Y. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12695-12701Google Scholar), and it is this strongly destabilizing effect of TMAO on the unfolded state that forces the protein to fold. Based on our results and the results of others, there are two distinctly different mechanisms to force intrinsically unstable proteins to fold: one is to lower the Gibbs energy of the native state by using the binding energy of ligands to drive folding (ULand NL in Scheme FS1) (1Spolar R.S. Record M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Google Scholar, 22Frankel A.D. Kim P.S. Cell. 1991; 65: 717-719Google Scholar) and the other is to make use of the solvophobic effect of osmolytes on the peptide backbone to raise the free energy of unfolded state higher than that of native protein (UTMAO and NTMAO in Scheme FS1) (13Wang A. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9101-9108Google Scholar). Examples of folding being driven by ligand binding include proteins with disordered domains that are induced to fold on binding DNA (1Spolar R.S. Record M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Google Scholar, 23Pan B. Deng Z. Liu D. Ghosh S. Mullen G.P. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1237-1247Google Scholar, 24Weiss M.A. Ellenberger T. Wobbe C.R. Lee J.P. Harrison S.C. Struhl K. Nature. 1990; 347: 575-578Google Scholar), the case of the (unstructured) prodomain of subtilisin being induced to fold when complexed with subtilisin (25Bryan P. Wang L. Hoskins J. Ruvinov S. Strausberg S. Alexander P. Almog O. Gilliland G. Gallagher T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10310-10318Google Scholar,26Shinde U.P. Liu J.J. Inouye M. Nature. 1997; 389: 520-522Google Scholar), and several cases of preferential anion and/or cation binding to the native state of some proteins (23Pan B. Deng Z. Liu D. Ghosh S. Mullen G.P. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1237-1247Google Scholar, 27Oobatake M. Takahashi S. Ooi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1979; 86: 65-70Google Scholar), shifting the equilibrium in favor of the folded state. According to the induced-fit model, ligand binding provides the driving forces for folding and the ligand serves as a template for the disordered domain to adopt its final conformation (1Spolar R.S. Record M.T. Science. 1994; 263: 777-784Google Scholar, 28Koshland D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1958; 44: 98-104Google Scholar). Since TMAO induces folding not by binding but by solvophobic effects on the backbone, it may be possible to use TMAO to determine the extent to which the induced-fit model of folding is applicable. For the purpose of forcing proteins to fold, there is considerable advantage in leaving the side chain forces alone while using the unfavorable interaction between osmolyte and backbone as an additional force for folding. The principal advantages are: 1) the backbone is the most numerous functional group in proteins so focusing on the backbone ensures that the effect of the osmolyte is generic in scope, and 2) when the side chain forces are the same in TMAO as in buffer, the tendency will be to fold the protein to the same native species that prevails in buffer. As can be seen from the examples, significant advantage can be taken of these properties for the study of proteins that are intrinsically unstable or partially folded. We are indebted to Dr. N. Pace for providing ribonuclease T1 and to Dr. W. Stites for providing the strains of E. coli for overexpression of SNase mutant T62P."

Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is necessary to induce LTP. Here, induction of LTP in CA1 pyramidal cells of rats was prevented by blocking the tyrosine kinase Src, and Src activity was increased by stimulation producing LTP. Directly activating Src in the postsynaptic neuron enhanced excitatory synaptic responses, occluding LTP. Src-induced enhancement of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor–mediated synaptic responses required raised intracellular Ca 2+ and N -methyl- d -aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Thus, Src activation is necessary and sufficient for inducing LTP and may function by up-regulating NMDA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2071482962,"Adhesion and the ability to form filaments are thought to contribute to the pathogenicity of Candida albicans, the leading cause of fungal disease in immunocompromised patients. Int1p is a C. albicans surface protein with limited similarity to vertebrate integrins. INT1 expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was sufficient to direct the adhesion of this normally nonadherent yeast to human epithelial cells. Furthermore, disruption of INT1 in C. albicans suppressed hyphal growth, adhesion to epithelial cells, and virulence in mice. Thus, INT1 links adhesion, filamentous growth, and pathogenicity in C. albicans and Int1p may be an attractive target for the development of antifungal therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2027222274,"The nocturnal increase in circulating melatonin in vertebrates is regulated by 10- to 100-fold increases in pineal serotonin N -acetyltransferase (AA-NAT) activity. Changes in the amount of AA-NAT protein were shown to parallel changes in AA-NAT activity. When neural stimulation was switched off by either light exposure or l -propranolol–induced β-adrenergic blockade, both AA-NAT activity and protein decreased rapidly. Effects of l -propranolol were blocked in vitro by dibutyryl adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) or inhibitors of proteasomal proteolysis. This result indicates that adrenergic-cAMP regulation of AA-NAT is mediated by rapid reversible control of selective proteasomal proteolysis. Similar proteasome-based mechanisms may function widely as selective molecular switches in vertebrate neural systems."

However, the exact role of CETP in the development of atherosclerosis has not been determined. In the present study, we examined the effect of the suppression of increased plasma CETP by intravenous injection with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) against CETP targeted to the liver on the development of atherosclerosis in rabbits fed a cholesterol diet. The ODNs against rabbit CETP were coupled to asialoglycoprotein (ASOR) carrier molecules, which serve as an important method to regulate liver gene expression. Twenty-two male Japanese White rabbits were used in the experiment. Eighteen animals were fed a standard rabbit chow supplemented with 0.3% cholesterol throughout the experiment for 16 weeks. At 8 weeks, they were divided into three groups (six animals in each group), among which the plasma total and HDL cholesterol concentrations did not significantly change. The control group received nothing, the sense group were injected with the sense ODNs complex, and the antisense group were injected with the antisense ODNs complex, respectively, for subsequent 8 weeks. ASOR·poly(l-lysine) ODNs complex were injected via the ear veins twice a week. Four animals were fed a standard rabbit diet for 16 weeks. The total cholesterol concentrations and the CETP mass in the animals injected with antisense ODNs were all significantly decreased in 12 and 16 weeks compared with those injected with sense ODNs and the control animals. The HDL cholesterol concentrations measured by the precipitation assay did not significantly change among the groups fed a cholesterol diet, and triglyceride concentrations did not significantly change in the four groups. However, at the end of the study, when the HDL cholesterol concentrations were measured after the isolation by ultracentrifugation and a column chromotography, they were significantly higher in the animals injected with antisense ODNs than in the animals injected with sense ODNs and in the control animals. A reduction of CETP mRNA and an increase of LDL receptor mRNA in the liver were observed in the animals injected with antisense ODNs compared with those injected with sense ODNs and the control animals. Aortic cholesterol contents and the aortic percentage lesion to total surface area were significantly lower in the animals injected with antisense ODNs than in the animals injected with sense ODNs and in the control animals.

J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 361-367Google Scholar, 2Hesler C.B. Swenson T.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2275-2282Google Scholar). The homozygotes for CETP deficiency demonstrated markedly elevated HDL cholesterol and plasma apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) levels as well as decreased LDL cholesterol and plasma apoB levels (3Koizumi J. Mabuchi H. Yoshimura A. Michishita I. Takeda M. Itoh H. Sakai Y. Sakai T. Ueda K. Takeda R. Atherosclerosis. 1985; 58: 175-186Google Scholar, 4Inazu A. Brown M.L. Hesler C.B. Agellon L.B. Koizumi J. Tanaka K. Maruhama Y. Mabuchi H. Tall A.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 323: 1234-1238Google Scholar). CETP deficiency may be associated with protection against ischemic heart disease, based on the observed longevity (5Saito F. Metab. Clin. Exp. 1984; 33: 629-633Google Scholar) as well as the lack of any evidence of coronary heart disease (4Inazu A. Brown M.L. Hesler C.B. Agellon L.B. Koizumi J. Tanaka K. Maruhama Y. Mabuchi H. Tall A.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 323: 1234-1238Google Scholar). However, recently it was reported that in some patients with CETP deficiency there were increased coronary heart diseases (6Hirano K. Yamashita S. Kuga Y. Sakai N. Nozaki S. Kihara S. Arai T. Yanagi K. Takami S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1849-1856Google Scholar, 7Zhong S. Sharp D.S. Grove J.S. Bruce C. Yano K.

Sci. 1995; 748: 599-602Google Scholar). Even in the study using CETP transgenic mice, the exact role of CETP in the development of atherosclerosis has yet to be clarified. Marotti et al. (9Marotti K.R. Castle C.K. Boyle T.P. Lin A.H. Murray R.W. Melchior G.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 73-75Google Scholar) demonstrated that transgenic mice expressing cynomolgus monkey CETP had significantly more early atherosclerotic lesions in the proximal aorta than controls when fed a high cholesterol diet. On the other hand, more recently Hayek et al. (10Hayek T. Masucci-Magoulas L. Jiang X. Walsh A. Rubin E. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2071-2074Google Scholar) concluded that transgenic mice expressing human CETP and apoCIII showed the inhibition of the development of early atherosclerotic lesions. To determine how CETPs affect atherosclerosis in clinical situations, plasma CETP levels must be changed in the experimental models because the studies in the patients with CETP deficiency or CETP transgenic mice go from one extreme to another. We have showed that intravenous injection with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) against CETP coupled to asialoglycoprotein carrier molecules targeted to the liver could inhibit the plasma CETP activity, and as a result, induced a decrease in the plasma LDL + VLDL cholesterol and an increase in the plasma HDL cholesterol in cholesterol-fed rabbits (11Sugano M. Makino N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19080-19083Google Scholar). In the present study using an intravenous injection with antisense ODNs to the liver, we examined the effect of the suppression of increased plasma CETP on the plasma cholesterol concentrations and the development of atherosclerosis in rabbits fed a cholesterol diet. The sequences of ODNs against rabbit CETP and asialoglycoprotein·poly(l-lysine) ODNs complex used in this study were same as described previously (11Sugano M. Makino N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19080-19083Google Scholar). Twenty-two male Japanese White rabbits weighing 2.0–2.5 kg were used in the experiment. All animals were housed individually and had free access to water. Eighteen animals were fed a standard rabbit chow supplemented with 0.3% cholesterol for 8 weeks and divided to three groups (six animals in each group), among which the plasma total and HDL cholesterol concentrations did not significantly change. After 8 weeks, the control group again received only a 0.3% cholesterol diet, the sense group had a 0.3% cholesterol diet and were injected with asialoglycoprotein (ASOR)-poly(l-lysine) sense ODNs complex, and the antisense group also had a 0.3% cholesterol diet and were injected with ASOR-poly(l-lysine) antisense ODNs complex; all animals were fed until 16 weeks. Four animals were fed a standard rabbit diet for 16 weeks (standard group). ASOR-poly(l-lysine) antisense ODNs complex were injected via the ear veins twice a week. The amount of ODNs injected was 30 μg/kg for each rabbit. Every 4 weeks, about 1 ml of the blood was drawn from all the animals via their ear veins. At the end of the study, all rabbits were sacrificed, and liver specimens, aorta, and blood samples were taken. Total RNA was isolated from the liver, and the rabbit-labeled cDNA probes for CETP and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA were produced by the nonradiolabeled reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) according to the rabbit sequence (12Nagashima M. McLean J.W. Lawn R.M. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1643-1649Google Scholar) as described previously (11Sugano M. Makino N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19080-19083Google Scholar). The sense and antisense primers used for PCR, the size of PCR products, and PCR cycles in each labeled cDNA probe were as follows: CETP: sense, 5′-CTTTCCATAAACTGCTCCTG-3′; antisense, 5′-CCTGGGTCTCCGCACTTTCT-3′; size, 482 base pairs, 30 cycles; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase: sense, 5′-ATGGTCTACATGTTCCAGTA-3′; antisense, 5′-TAAGCAGTTGGTGGTGCAGG-3′; size, 343 base pairs, 30 cycles. To make the cDNA probe for LDL-receptor (LDL-R), reverse transcription-PCR was done according to the rabbit sequence (13Yamamoto T. Bishop R.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Russell D.W. Science. 1986; 232: 1230-1237Google Scholar) using the following primers: sense, 5′-TGCATCCATGGCAGCCGGCAGTGT-3′; antisense, 5′-AGGCGGCGGCTCAGGCCACGTCGT-3′; size, 1822 base pairs; 35 cycles. The probe was cloned into pGem3zf(3) SmaI site. The labeled cRNA probe for LDL-R were produced using ECL random prime labeling system (Amersham, Japan). Poly(A+) RNA was isolated from total RNA with Oligotex Super (Rosche, Japan), and the abundance of each mRNA was determined by Northern blotting. Rabbit CETP mass was measured as follows. 2H. Okamoto, M. Kamada, and A. Mizushima, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, rabbit CETP was purified from rabbit plasma according to the purification method of human CETP described by Kato et al. (14Kato H. Nakanishi T. Arai H. Nishida H.I. Nishida T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4082-4087Google Scholar). Rabbit CETP was emulsified in equal volumes of Freund's complete adjuvant and was injected into the foot pads of Balb/c mice. After the first injection of rabbit CETP solution, it was injected 4 times every 5 days. Popliteal lymph node cells of the mice were obtained 2 days after the final injection. Then, the cells were fused with mouse myeloma cells using polyethylene glycol 4000. Media conditioned by the resulting hybridomas were screened for CETP inhibition as described previously (11Sugano M. Makino N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19080-19083Google Scholar). Two monoclonal antibodies to neutralize the activity to rabbit CETP, JRC1 and JRC2, were obtained and used in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system. JRC1 was used as the capture monoclonal antibodies, and biotinylated JRC2 was used as the detection monoclonal antibodies. A CETP preparation isolated from rabbit plasma with a JRC1-Sepharose affinity column was used as a standard of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system. The detection limit of the assay was approximately 10 ng of CETP/ml (1 ng/well). The aorta was opened longitudinally along the mid-thoracic line, and the surface area containing lesions were measured without staining by planimetry from the enlarged color photograph as described previously (15Sugano M. Nakashima Y. Matsushima T. Takahara K. Takasugi M. Kuroiwa A. Koide O. Arteriosclerosis. 1986; 6: 237-241Google Scholar). The aorta was then cut into pieces (2 × 2 mm) and was delipidated with a chloroform/methanol solution (2:1 v/v). The aortic cholesterol content was measured as described previously (16Sugano M. Makino N. Yanaga T. Atherosclerosis. 1996; 127: 123-129Google Scholar) and was expressed as mg/g wet weight of aorta. The plasma cholesterol concentrations were measured in whole plasma and in the HDL-containing supernatant after the precipitation of VLDL + LDL with dextran Mg2+using the Wako total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol measuring kit (Wako Ltd., Japan). Concerned with the plasma taken at the end of the study when all rabbits were sacrificed, HDL were isolated from the plasma by ultracentrifugation and fractionated by size using a 1.6 × 50-cm Suprose 6B HPLC column as described previously (17Sugano M. Makino N. Yanaga T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1346: 17-24Google Scholar), and the HDL cholesterol concentrations were measured. The plasma constituents related to liver function were analyzed using an automatic analyzer (Hitachi Ltd., Japan). All values are presented as the mean ± S.E. of the mean. Comparisons among three or more groups were made using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnetts' modified t test. Differences were considered to be statistically significant at a value of p < 0.05. In the rabbits injected with antisense ODNs, the total cholesterol concentrations and the CETP mass were all significantly decreased in 12 and 16 weeks compared with those injected with sense ODNs and the control animals (Fig. 1). The HDL cholesterol concentrations measured by the precipitation assay did not significantly change among the groups fed a cholesterol diet until 12 weeks (Fig. 1). However, the HDL cholesterol concentrations, measured after the isolation by ultracentrifugation and HPLC, were significantly increased at 16 weeks in the rabbits injected with antisense ODNs compared with those injected with sense ODNs and the control animals (21.57 ± 1.70 mg/dl versus 15.95 ± 1.36 mg/dl, 16.35 mg/dl ± 2.10) (Fig. 1). Triglyceride concentrations did not significantly change in the four groups (Fig. 1). Fig. 2 shows a typical example of Northern blot analyses of hepatic mRNAs in each group. When the amount of hepatic CETP mRNA and LDL-R mRNA were measured by scanning and expressed as a ratio to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA, the values were (0.87 ± 0.07, 0.33 ± 0.05) in the control group, (0.85 ± 0.06, 0.41 ± 0.03) in the sense group, (0.68 ± 0.04, 0.63 ± 0.06) in the antisense group, and (0.63 ± 0.06, 0.66 ± 0.06) in the standard group, respectively. A significant reduction of CETP mRNA and a significant increase of LDL-R mRNA were observed in the animals injected with antisense ODNs compared with those injected with the sense ODNs and the control animals. Aortic cholesterol contents and the aortic percentage lesion to total surface area were significantly lower in the animals injected with antisense ODNs than in the animals injected with sense ODNs and in the control animals (Fig. 3). We measured the plasma constituents related to liver function (glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, γ-GTP, alkaliphosphatase, and total bilirubin; data not shown). These levels did not significantly different among the animals fed a cholesterol diet.Figure 2The typical example of the Northern blot analyses of hepatic CETP, LDL-R, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA in the four groups.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3Aortic cholesterol contents (left panel) and the aortic percentage lesion to total surface area (right panel).

As a result, it suppressed atherosclerosis, whereas it did not affect HDL cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. Although we used the oligodeoxynucleotides of phosphodiesters, our antisense injection was considered to be successful for the following reasons. (a) The asialoglycoprotein·poly(l-lysine) antisense complex is rapidly and preferentially taken up by the liver (18Wu G.Y. Wu C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14621-14624Google Scholar, 19Chowdhury N.R. Wu C.H. Wu G.Y. Yerneni P.C. Bommineni V.R. Chowdhury J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11265-11271Google Scholar) and has enhanced resistance to nuclease degradation in plasma (20Chiou H.C. Tangco M.V. Levine S.M. Robertson D. Kormis K. Wu C.H. Wu G.Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5439-5446Google Scholar). Within 10–20 min of the intravenous administration of ASOR·poly(l-lysine) DNA complex, 80–85% of the total amount was found within the liver, 80% of which was localized specifically to hepatocytes (18Wu G.Y. Wu C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14621-14624Google Scholar, 19Chowdhury N.R. Wu C.H. Wu G.Y. Yerneni P.C. Bommineni V.R. Chowdhury J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11265-11271Google Scholar). In the above time frame for intravenous delivery, the vast majority of the oligodeoxynucleotides of phosphodiesters bound to asialoglycoprotein·poly (l-lysine) conjugate remained intact (20Chiou H.C. Tangco M.V. Levine S.M. Robertson D. Kormis K. Wu C.H. Wu G.Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5439-5446Google Scholar). In the rabbits fed a cholesterol diet, increased plasma CETP mass could be explained by the effects on CETP synthesis, which was consistent with the observed effects of cholesterol on liver mRNA (21Mcpherson R. Lau P. Kussie P. Barret H. Tall A.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 203-210Google Scholar, 22Quinet E.M. Agellon L.B. Kroon P.A. Marcel Y.L. Lee Y.C. Whitlock M.E. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 357-363Google Scholar). CETP activities contribute to elevated cholesterol concentrations in the patients with hypercholesterolemia and those with combined hyperlipidemia, although they do not constitute final proof (23Tato F. Vega G.L. Tall A.R. Grundy S.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 112-120Google Scholar). In humans with CETP deficiency, LDL catabolic rate is enhanced (24Ikewaki K. Nishiwaki M. Sakamoto T. Ishikawa T. Fairwell T. Zech L.A. Nagano M. Nakamura H. Brewer Jr., H.B. Rader D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1573-1581Google Scholar), and down-regulation for the LDL receptor in transgenic mice containing human CETP has been also observed (25Jiang X.C. Masucci-Magoulas L. Mar J. Lin M. Walsh A. Breslow J.L. Tall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27406-27412Google Scholar). In our study, it was shown that plasma CETP was reduced possibly by suppression of the production of CETP by an antisense ODNs against CETP and that suppression of the increased LDL-R mRNA in the liver might also contribute to the reduction of the total cholesterol concentrations. Plasma CETP concentration showed a positive correlation with LDL cholesterol concentration and molecular weight in cynomolgus monkey when CETP levels and LDL cholesterol concentration were in wide ranges (26Quinet E. Tall A. Ramakrishnan R. Rudel L.J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 87: 1559-1566Google Scholar). In our study, however, HDL cholesterol concentrations did not significantly change at 12 weeks in spite of the reduction of CETP. We previously showed that the total cholesterol concentrations and the CETP activities were all significantly decreased for 96 h, whereas the HDL cholesterol concentrations returned to the base line at 96 h, when ASOR·poly(l-lysine) antisense ODNs against CETP was injected (11Sugano M. Makino N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19080-19083Google Scholar). Blood samples were drawn 4 days (96 h) after the injection of ODNs in the present study, which may partly explain why HDL cholesterol levels were not significantly changed. However, the main reason why HDL cholesterol levels were not significantly changed was possibly due to the method used. Unfortunately, we used the precipitation assay using Dextran Mg2+ to measure HDL cholesterol, which may be inaccurate when VLDL + LDL cholesterol are much increased as in our study. In fact, in the rabbits injected with antisense ODNs, the HDL cholesterol concentrations were significantly increased at 16 weeks compared with those injected with sense ODNs and the control animals, when they were measured after the isolation by ultracentrifugation and a HPLC. In our study, the total cholesterol decreased substantially more than the HDL cholesterol increased. Although the homozygotes for CETP deficiency, which showed almost no CETP levels, demonstrated markedly elevated HDL-C and plasma apoA-I levels (3Koizumi J. Mabuchi H. Yoshimura A. Michishita I.

Tall A.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 323: 1234-1238Google Scholar), wide-ranged CETP levels showed no significant correlation to HDL cholesterol in healthy Japanese (27Kinoshita M. Teramoto T. Shimazu N. Kaneko K. Ohta M. Koike T. Hosogaya S. Ozaki Y. Kume S. Yamanaka M. Atherosclerosis. 1996; 120: 75-82Google Scholar) and normotriglyceridemic man (28Foger B. Ritsch A. Doblinger A. Wessels H. Patsch J.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1430-1436Google Scholar). In our study, since the CETP is from low to high levels in the four groups, it might be speculated that the reduction of CETP affected HDL cholesterol little. In CETP inhibition in the rabbits fed a standard diet with antibody, the major phenotypic effect is increased HDL levels (29Whitlock M.E. Swenson T.L. Ramakrishnan R. Leonard M.T. Marcel Y.L. Milne R.W. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 84: 129-137Google Scholar). In the transgenic mice expressing human CETP, CETP monoclonal antibody, TP2 suppressed plasma CETP activity, whereas the liver CETP mRNA was increased (30Oliveira H.C.F. Ma L. Milne R. Marcovina S.M. Inazu A. Mabuchi H. Tall A.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1045-1052Google Scholar). In our study, however, the rabbits were fed with a cholesterol diet, and the liver CETP mRNA was suppressed with antisense ODNs against CETP. Further studies are called for to elucidate the exact effect of suppression of CETP in the liver on HDL metabolism in hypercholesterolemia. The exact role of CETP in the development of atherosclerosis has been controversial (4Inazu A. Brown M.L. Hesler C.B. Agellon L.B. Koizumi J. Tanaka K. Maruhama Y. Mabuchi H. Tall A.R. N. Engl. J.

Invest. 1996; 97: 2917-2923Google Scholar) reported that the increased risk of coronary heart disease in Japanese-American men with CETP gene mutation was largely present in individuals with HDL cholesterol 40–60 mg/dl, which was in the normal range and that LDL cholesterol levels in the patients were not different compared with the control men (7Zhong S. Sharp D.S. Grove J.S. Bruce C. Yano K. Curb J.D. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2917-2923Google Scholar). In consideration of the lipoprotein cholesterol profile, these findings are hard for us to explain why atherosclerosis developed in the patients. These findings may suggest the anti-atherogenicity of CETP independent of plasma LDL and/or HDL cholesterol. Although Yamashita et al. (33Yamashita S. Ishigami M. Arai T. Sakai N. Hirano K. Kameda-Takemura K. Tokunaga K. Matsuzawa Y. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 748: 606-608Google Scholar) showed that very high density lipoprotein called pre-β HDL, induced by CETP, had a potent anti-atherogenic function, it should be remembered that pre-β HDL was increased in the hypercholesterolemic patients or in the patients with the disorder of other lipid metabolisms (34Ishida B.Y. Frolich J. Fielding C.J. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 778-786Google Scholar). Inazu et al. (4Inazu A. Brown M.L. Hesler C.B. Agellon L.B. Koizumi J. Tanaka K. Maruhama Y. Mabuchi H. Tall A.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1990; 323: 1234-1238Google Scholar) previously showed that the homozygotes for CETP deficiency had increased levels of HDL cholesterol and decreased levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol and that there was no evidence of premature atherosclerosis in the families with CETP deficiency, which might be associated with an increased life span. In the studies using CETP transgenic mice, the transgenic mice expressing only CETP had significantly more early atherosclerotic lesions in the proximal aorta than controls (9Marotti K.R. Castle C.K. Boyle T.P. Lin A.H. Murray R.W. Melchior G.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 73-75Google Scholar), whereas the transgenic mice expressing both human CETP and apoCIII showed the inhibition of the development of early atherosclerotic lesions (10Hayek T. Masucci-Magoulas L. Jiang X. Walsh A. Rubin E. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2071-2074Google Scholar). CETP was more closely associated with carotid intima media thickness than HDL cholesterol in human (32Foger B. Luef G. Ritsch A. Schmidauer C. Doblinger A. Jechleitner F. Aichner F. Patsch J.R. J. Mol. Med. 1995; 73: 369-372Google Scholar). In conclusion, in this study we showed for the first time that increased plasma VLDL or/and LDL could be reduced by suppression of CETP, which as a result suppressed atherosclerosis. Although fenofibrate has been reported to reduce plasma CETP activity and normalize the dense LDL profile (35Guerin M. Bruckert E. Dolphin P.J. Turpin G. Chapman M.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 763-772Google Scholar), the development of the new drug that can reduce plasma CETP as a main effect is called for to reduce plasma VLDL or/and LDL cholesterol and to prevent atherosclerosis.

https://openalex.org/W1997974981,"We have shown previously that UV radiation and other DNA-damaging agents induce the ubiquitination of a portion of the RNA polymerase II large subunit (Pol II LS). In the present study UV irradiation of repair-competent fibroblasts induced a transient reduction of the Pol II LS level; new protein synthesis restored Pol II LS to the base-line level within 16–24 h. In repair-deficient xeroderma pigmentosum cells, UV radiation-induced ubiquitination of Pol II LS was followed by a sustained reduction of Pol II LS level. In both normal and xeroderma pigmentosum cells, the ubiquitinated Pol II LS had a hyperphosphorylated COOH-terminal domain (CTD), which is characteristic of elongating Pol II. The portion of Pol II LS whose steady-state level diminished most quickly had a relatively hypophosphorylated CTD. The ubiquitinated residues did not map to the CTD. Importantly, UV-induced reduction of Pol II LS level in repair-competent or -deficient cells was inhibited by the proteasome inhibitors lactacystin or MG132. These data demonstrate that UV-induced ubiquitination of Pol II LS is followed by its degradation in the proteasome. These results suggest, contrary to a current model of transcription-coupled DNA repair, that elongating Pol II complexes which arrest at intragenic DNA lesions may be aborted rather than resuming elongation after repair takes place.

These results suggest, contrary to a current model of transcription-coupled DNA repair, that elongating Pol II complexes which arrest at intragenic DNA lesions may be aborted rather than resuming elongation after repair takes place. Ubiquitination of cellular proteins is a covalent modification that plays several important physiological roles (1Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Google Scholar, 2Jentsch S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 179-207Google Scholar). Proteins become ubiquitinated by the sequential action of three enzymes: a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; Pol II, RNA polymerase II; NER, nucleotide excision repair; LS, large subunit; TCR, transcription-coupled repair; CS, Cockayne syndrome; CTD, COOH-terminal domain of Pol II LS; IIa, hypophosphorylated Pol II LS; IIo, hyperphosphorylated Pol II LS; mAb, monoclonal antibody; XP, xeroderma pigmentosum; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild type.1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; Pol II, RNA polymerase II; NER, nucleotide excision repair; LS, large subunit; TCR, transcription-coupled repair; CS, Cockayne syndrome; CTD, COOH-terminal domain of Pol II LS; IIa, hypophosphorylated Pol II LS; IIo, hyperphosphorylated Pol II LS; mAb, monoclonal antibody; XP, xeroderma pigmentosum; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild type. a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3). Because ubiquitinated proteins are usually targeted for degradation in the proteasome, this modification enables cells to control the level of many regulatory proteins (1Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Google Scholar, 2Jentsch S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 179-207Google Scholar, 3Hochstrasser M. Ellison M.J. Chau V. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4606-4610Google Scholar). Some ubiquitinated proteins, however, are not targeted to the proteasome (4Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Google Scholar, 5Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1996; 84: 853-862Google Scholar, 6Wang Y. Yeung Y.-G. Langdon W.Y. Stanley E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17-20Google Scholar). Ubiquitination plays a role in the response of the cell to DNA damage including the accumulation of p53 (7Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 8Maki C.G. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2649-2654Google Scholar). Mammalian cells with a temperature-sensitive E1 show increased sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) radiation when grown at the non-permissive temperature (9Ikehata H. Kaneda S. Yamao F. Seno T. Ono T. Hanaoka F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1484-1489Google Scholar). The yeastRAD6 gene encodes an E2 (10Jentsch S. McGrath J.P. Varshavsky A. Nature. 1987; 329: 131-134Google Scholar), and the product of the yeastRAD23 gene possesses an NH2-terminal ubiquitin-like domain that is essential for its role in DNA repair (11Watkins J.F. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7757-7765Google Scholar). Lastly, a proteasomal subunit (SUG 1) copurifies with TFIIH, a multiprotein complex required for transcriptional initiation by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) as well as DNA repair via the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway (12Weeda G. Rossignol M. Fraser R.A. Winkler G.S. Vermeulen W. van't Veer L.J. Ma L. Hoeijmakers J.H. Egly J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2274-2283Google Scholar, 13Friedberg E.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 15-42Google Scholar). 7–10% of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (Pol II LS) becomes ubiquitinated within minutes of exposing cultured human cells to UV radiation and the anti-cancer agent cisplatin (14Bregman D.B. Halaban R. van Gool A.J. Henning K.A. Friedberg E.C. Warren S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11586-11590Google Scholar). These two agents cause DNA lesions subject to repair by NER (7Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Lesions induced by UV radiation and cisplatin can stop transcription by creating a physical block for the elongating Pol II apparatus when the lesions are located on the transcribed strand of a gene. Such lesions are repaired more rapidly by the NER pathway than are lesions located elsewhere in the genome. This preferential repair, called transcription-coupled repair (TCR), requires a functional Pol II LS (for review, see Ref. 13Friedberg E.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 15-42Google Scholar). Cells from patients with Cockayne syndrome (CS) demonstrate deficient TCR and hampered recovery of transcriptional activity after UV irradiation (15van Gool A.J. van der Horst G.T.J. Citterio E. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4155-4162Google Scholar). Two complementation groups (CS-A and CS-B) have been identified, and in both cases the defective gene has been cloned (16Henning K.A. Li L. Narayan I. McDaniel L.D. Reagan M.S. Legerski R. Schultz R.A. Stefanini M. Lehmann A.R. Mayne L.V. Friedberg E.C. Cell. 1995; 82: 555-564Google Scholar, 17Troelstra C. van Gool A. de Wit J. Vermeulen W. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 939-953Google Scholar). Interestingly, CS-A and CS-B cells also demonstrate deficient UV-induced ubiquitination of Pol II LS (14Bregman D.B. Halaban R. van Gool A.J. Henning K.A. Friedberg E.C. Warren S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11586-11590Google Scholar). A portion of Pol II binds to the CS-B protein (18van Gool A.J. Citterio E. Rademakers S. van Os R. Vermeulen W. Constantinous A. Egly J.-M. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5955-5965Google Scholar). During the transcription cycle, the COOH-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II LS undergoes a cycle of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (19Corden J.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 213-218Google Scholar, 20Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Google Scholar). A relatively hypophosphorylated form of Pol II LS (IIa) preferentially binds to most promoters. Promoter clearance and transcript elongation are associated with phosphorylation of the CTD to yield a hyperphosphorylated (IIo) form. The CTD is an essential component of Pol II LS. It is comprised of a heptapeptide with the consensus sequence Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser repeated 52 times in mammalian cells. Many proteins involved in transcriptional regulation (21Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Google Scholar, 22Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 466-469Google Scholar) as well as pre-mRNA processing (23Kim E. Du L. Bregman D.B. Warren S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 19-28Google Scholar, 24McCracken S. Fong N. Yankulov K. Ballantyne S. Pan G. Greenblatt J. Patterson S.D. Wickens M. Bentley D.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 357-361Google Scholar, 25Steinmetz E.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 491-494Google Scholar) bind to the CTD, and it appears likely that the phosphorylation status of the CTD helps determine which proteins will bind (26Yuryev A. Patturajan M. Litingtung Y. Joshi R.V. Gentile C. Gebara M. Corden J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6975-6980Google Scholar). Studies of CTD phosphorylation have been assisted by the characterization of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that recognize distinct epitopes within the repeated heptapeptide (27Bregman D.B. Du L. van der Zee S. Warren S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 287-298Google Scholar, 28Thompson N.E. Steinberg T.H. Aronson D.B. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11511-11520Google Scholar). Some mAbs recognize a phosphorylated Ser residue (H5 or H14) and others recognize a dephosphorylated Ser residue (8WG16) within the repeated heptapeptide. 2Patturajan, M., Schulte, R. J., Sefton, B. M., Berezney, R., Vincent, M., Bensaude, O., Warren, S. L., and Corden, J. L. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 4689–4694.2Patturajan, M., Schulte, R. J., Sefton, B. M., Berezney, R., Vincent, M., Bensaude, O., Warren, S. L., and Corden, J. L. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 4689–4694. Because the status of Pol II LS after the cell has sustained DNA damage may affect NER as well as the recovery of transcription, we wished to determine the metabolic fate of Pol II LS subsequent to UV-induced ubiquitination. In the present study we establish that UV-induced ubiquitination of a portion of Pol II LS is followed by transient diminution of its steady-state level. Whereas the ubiquitinated Pol II LS molecules have a hyperphosphorylated CTD, the portion that appears to diminish most rapidly has a hypophosphorylated CTD. In repair-competent fibroblasts, new protein synthesis permits recovery of base-line Pol II LS level. In repair-deficient xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) cells, the loss of Pol II LS is sustained. Proteasome inhibitors block the loss of Pol II LS in repair-competent or -deficient cells. The ubiquitinated residues are not located in the CTD. Cell culture was performed as described previously (14Bregman D.B. Halaban R. van Gool A.J. Henning K.A. Friedberg E.C. Warren S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11586-11590Google Scholar). The following XP fibroblast lines were used: DNA repair-competent, GM5659C and GM639D; XP-A, GM2009; XP-C, GM671; XP-D, GM8207; and XP-G, GM3021 from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Camden, NJ). They were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1 × penicillin-streptomycin-neomycin (Sigma). UV irradiation at 254 nm was performed as described previously (14Bregman D.B. Halaban R. van Gool A.J. Henning K.A. Friedberg E.C. Warren S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11586-11590Google Scholar). For individual experiments, the following agents were added to the cell culture media 1 h before UV irradiation and were maintained in the media after irradiation: cycloheximide, 20 mg/ml (Sigma); MG132, 1 μm (Peptides International, Louisville, KY); and lactacystin, 5 μm (Prof. E. J. Corey, Harvard). 6% SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblot analysis of whole cell extracts of cultured cells were performed as described previously (14Bregman D.B. Halaban R. van Gool A.J. Henning K.A. Friedberg E.C. Warren S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11586-11590Google Scholar) with the following mAbs directed against Pol II LS: H5 and H14 (27Bregman D.B. Du L. van der Zee S. Warren S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 287-298Google Scholar), ARNA 3 (Research Diagnostics, Flanders, NJ), and 8WG16 (QED Biosciences, San Diego, CA). Protein bands were visualized via chemiluminescence (Pierce) after blotting with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM for H5 (diluted 1:10,000) and H14 (diluted 1:20,000) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for 8WG16 and ARNA 3 (diluted 1:10,000). The cell fractionation experiment was performed by extracting fibroblasts with TD buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) as described previously (27Bregman D.B. Du L. van der Zee S. Warren S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 287-298Google Scholar). Insoluble material was solubilized with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and equicellular amounts of TD extractable and unextractable material were subjected to immunoblot analysis. HeLa cells were stably transfected with two different constructs expressing α-amanitin-resistant Pol II LS: pHA-Wt, which expresses a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged, α-amanitin resistant, full-length murine Pol II LS; and pHA-D31, which is identical to pHA-Wt except that the CTD has only 31 heptapeptide repeats such that all 8 CTD lysine residues are removed. The HeLa cells were transfected via lipofection with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), and then cells expressing the α-amanitin-resistant Pol II LS were selected with 2 mg/ml α-amanitin. Clones of cells expressing pHA-Wt or pHA-D31 were then UV irradiated, allowed to recover at 37 °C, and were subjected to lysis in hot 1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were incubated in a boiling water bath for 5 min and then diluted with 6 volumes of cold 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and placed in on ice. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (14Bregman D.B. Halaban R. van Gool A.J. Henning K.A. Friedberg E.C. Warren S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11586-11590Google Scholar) with anti-HA mAb 12CA5 (Babco, Richmond, CA) non-covalently coupled to protein G-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Immunoprecipitated material was then subjected to immunoblot analysis with mAb H14. Because ubiquitinated proteins are often targeted to the proteasome, we investigated whether UV-induced ubiquitination of Pol II LS was followed by its degradation. Repair-competent fibroblasts were subjected to UV irradiation and allowed to recover at 37 °C for 1–24 h. Whole cell extracts from equivalent numbers of cells were prepared and subjected to Western immunoblot analysis with H14, a mAb that binds specifically to Pol II LS (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1–6). The H14 immunoreactive band from unirradiated cells is characteristically broad because H14 recognizes the hyperphosphorylated (IIo), hypophosphorylated (IIa), and intermediate forms of Pol II LS (Fig. 1 A, lane 1). 1 h after a dose of UV radiation which would be expected to kill 10–25% of repair-competent fibroblasts (29Bohr V.A. Okumoto D.S. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3830-3833Google Scholar, 30Andrews A.D. Barrett S.F. Robbins J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 1984-1988Google Scholar), ubiquitinated forms of Pol II LS could be identified (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). These forms migrate more slowly than IIo and have been demonstrated previously to represent ubiquitinated Pol II LS (14Bregman D.B. Halaban R. van Gool A.J. Henning K.A. Friedberg E.C. Warren S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11586-11590Google Scholar). In addition, the samples isolated 1–8 h after UV irradiation have a less broad Pol II LS band in which the relatively hypophosphorylated (IIa) forms appear preferentially diminished (lanes 2–4). By 16–24 h after UV irradiation, the band width and intensity more closely resemble the unirradiated sample (lanes 5 and 6). This loss of Pol II LS was not appreciated in earlier studies (14Bregman D.B. Halaban R. van Gool A.J. Henning K.A. Friedberg E.C. Warren S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11586-11590Google Scholar) most likely because sublethally irradiated HeLa cells divide and resynthesize Pol II LS very rapidly. Similar results were obtained when cell extracts were normalized for total protein content (data not shown). Because H14 recognizes a phosphorylated CTD epitope,2 the UV-induced diminution of hypophosphorylated Pol II LS forms detected in Fig. 1 A, lanes 2–4, could be caused by the altered steady-state level of the protein or altered phosphorylation status of the CTD. For example, if Pol II LS were acted upon by a kinase subsequent to UV irradiation, the broad Pol II LS band might be narrowed because of a shift of all Pol II LS forms toward IIo. To investigate why the Pol II LS band became narrower after UV radiation, the cell extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis with different anti-Pol II LS mAbs. The level of hypophosphorylated (IIa) forms diminishes when the Pol II LS is detected with H14 as well as ARNA 3 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–6), which recognizes a non-CTD epitope (31Kontermann R.E. Liu Z. Schulze R.A. Sommer K.A. Queitsch I. Dubel S. Kipriyanov S.M. Breitling F. Bautz E.K. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 473-481Google Scholar), or 8WG16 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 13–18), which recognizes a non-phosphorylated CTD epitope (28Thompson N.E. Steinberg T.H. Aronson D.B. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11511-11520Google Scholar). These data support a UV-induced loss of Pol II LS protein rather than a change in phosphorylation status. In addition, the same samples were immunoblotted with H5, which is specific for the hyperphosphorylated (IIo) form of Pol II LS (27Bregman D.B. Du L. van der Zee S. Warren S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 287-298Google Scholar). The ubiquitinated forms reacted with H5 (Fig. 1 A, lanes 14–17) as well as with H14 (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2–5), indicating that the ubiquitinated forms were also hyperphosphorylated even though the forms whose steady-state level diminishes after UV irradiation were relatively hypophosphorylated (see “Discussion”). We also performed a UV time course in an NER-defective xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XP-D) fibroblast cell line. In Fig. 1,A and B, it can be seen that ubiquitination and deubiquitination occur with similar kinetics in the repair-competent and XP-D cells. However, in the XP-D cell line the UV-induced diminution of the hypophosphorylated forms of Pol II LS is sustained. The broad Pol II LS band seen in the unirradiated base line is not restored by 16–24 h as it is in the repair-competent cells (compare Fig. 1 A, lane 12 with lane 6, or Fig. 1 B, lane 24 with lane 18). The fact that the diminution of Pol II LS from XP-D cells can be demonstrated in the immunoblots performed with H14, ARNA 3, and 8WG16 provides further proof that UV induces a net loss of protein rather than a change in CTD phosphorylation. Furthermore, the XP-D data demonstrate the preferential binding of mAb H5 to the IIo form of Pol II LS and its ability to recognize the ubiquitinated forms of Pol II LS (compare Fig. 1 A, lanes 19 and 20 with lanes 7 and 8). If the UV-induced down-regulation of the Pol II LS steady-state level was caused by protein degradation, recovery of Pol II LS to the base-line level in repair-competent cells should require new protein synthesis. A UV time course performed in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide demonstrated that this is indeed the case (Fig. 2). Using pharmacologic agents that block the ability of the proteasome to degrade ubiquitinated proteins we demonstrated that the ubiquitinated Pol II LS was targeted to the proteasome. Both the specific and irreversible proteasomal inhibitor lactacystin (32Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Google Scholar) and the reversible albeit less specific inhibitor MG132 (33Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Google Scholar) led to less loss of Pol II LS 1–9 h after UV irradiation (Fig. 3, compare lanes 8–11 with lanes 2–5 and comparelanes 20–23 with lanes 14–17). In the absence of UV irradiation the inhibitors did not alter the level of Pol II LS (Fig. 3, lanes 6, 12, 18, and 24). The ubiquitinated portion of Pol II LS was shown to be hyperphosphorylated (IIo) by virtue of its immunoreactivity with mAb H5 (Fig. 1 A). Whereas many studies have shown that Pol II LS that is actively engaged in transcriptional elongation is in the IIo form, we have shown previously that a portion of IIo is also present in a transcriptionally quiescent extrachromosomal location where splicing factors are also located (23Kim E. Du L. Bregman D.B. Warren S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 19-28Google Scholar, 27Bregman D.B. Du L. van der Zee S. Warren S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 287-298Google Scholar). These two different pools of IIo differ substantially in their ability to be extracted from mammalian nuclei with non-ionic detergents (27Bregman D.B. Du L. van der Zee S. Warren S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 287-298Google Scholar). The non-chromosomal (transcriptionally inactive) form is considerably more resistant to detergent extraction than the non-speckle-associated form. We demonstrated that the ubiquitinated form of Pol II LS is readily extractable with non-ionic detergent (Fig. 4). None of the ubiquitinated IIo was detected in the detergent-inextractable fraction, even when long exposures of the immunoblot were examined (data not shown). This is consistent with ubiquitinated IIo being the transcriptionally active (elongating) form of Pol II LS. Because the ability of Pol II LS to be ubiquitinated appears to depend on the phosphorylation status of the CTD, we wished to determine whether ubiquitination was also localized to this important regulatory domain. The CTD of Pol II LS is comprised of 52 tandem repeats of a heptapeptide with the consensus sequence Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser. All covalent modifications of Pol II LS besides ubiquitination, including serine/threonine phosphorylation, tyrosine phosphorylation, and O-linked glycosylation, have been mapped to the CTD (34Zhang J. Corden J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2290-2296Google Scholar, 35Baskaran R. Dahmus M.E. Wang J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11167-11171Google Scholar, 36Kelly W.G. Dahmus M.E. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10416-10424Google Scholar). We therefore wished to determine whether ubiquitination maps to this domain of Pol II LS. We were able to replace functionally the Pol II LS of HeLa cells with a truncated molecule in which all potential ubiquitination sites within the CTD were removed. Ubiquitination occurs exclusively on lysine residues (1Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Google Scholar). The CTD includes 8 lysines all of which are located in the COOH-terminal third of the CTD (comprising heptapeptide repeats 34–52) (37Wintzerith M. Acker J. Vicaire S. Vigneron M. Kedinger C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 910Google Scholar). Truncation of more than half of the CTD prevents its normal function, but truncation of the portion of the CTD including all 8 lysine residues yields a molecule capable of supporting a viable cell (38Gerber H.P. Hagmann M. Seipel K. Georgiev O. West M.A. Litingtung Y. Schaffner W. Corden J.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 660-662Google Scholar). Furthermore, a mutated variant of mouse Pol II LS has been cloned which will render cells resistant to the transcriptional inhibitor α-amanitin. This mutant bears a single amino acid change at a non-CTD amino acid (39Bartolomei M.S. Corden J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 586-594Google Scholar). In a cell expressing both WT (human) Pol II LS and mutant (mouse) Pol II LS, only the mutant will function in the presence of α-amanitin (40Bartolomei M.S. Halden N.F. Cullen C.R. Corden J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 330-339Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of WT mouse and human Pol II LS are nearly identical; there are only two sequence differences, neither of which involves CTD lysine residues (37Wintzerith M. Acker J. Vicaire S. Vigneron M. Kedinger C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 910Google Scholar). We therefore isolated HeLa cells stably transfected with α-amanitin-resistant Pol II LS expression constructs bearing either full-length CTD with all 52 heptapeptide repeats (WT) or a truncated CTD with only 31 of 52 heptapeptide repeats which therefore lacked all 8 CTD lysine residues (Δ31). These constructs were HA epitope tagged so the product of the transfected construct could be separated from the host Pol II LS via specific immunoprecipitation. After UV irradiation, both WT and truncated HA-tagged Pol II LS molecules demonstrated ubiquitination thus proving that non-CTD lysine residues were being ubiquitinated (Fig. 5). To address the question of whether UV-induced ubiquitination of Pol II LS plays a mechanistic role in NER, we investigated Pol II LS ubiquitination in fibroblast cell lines established from patients with XP complementation groups A through G. Each complementation group lacks a functional gene product required for a mechanistic “step” of NER (7Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). In addition several forms yield defects in TCR (XP-B, -D, and -G) (13Friedberg E.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 15-42Google Scholar). If ubiquitination of Pol II LS plays a mechanistic role in NER or TCR, ubiquitinated Pol II LS might accumulate to unusually high levels in one or more of the XP subtypes, or the kinetics of the appearance/disappearance of ubiquitinated Pol II LS might be altered. In Fig. 6 A, UV time courses of two different repair-competent human fibroblast lines are shown (lanes 1–5 and 6–10). Ubiquitinated forms of Pol II LS are induced within 1 h after UV irradiation and diminish thereafter until they become undetectable by 16–24 h. In all XP cells, ubiquitination and deubiquitination occurred to an extent similar to that seen in repair-competent cells and with similar kinetics (lanes 11–25). The results of XP-B, -D, -E, and -F cells (data not shown) were the same as those shown for XP-A and -G cells. These results do not support a mechanistic role for ubiquitination of Pol II LS in NER. However, in all XP cell types in which no residual NER activity remains (i.e. all types except XP-C, see below) there is a sustained loss of Pol II LS forms less phosphorylated than IIo beginning by 1 h after UV irradiation and easily detectable by 8 h after UV irradiation (lanes 18 and 23). In fibroblasts with normal levels of NER and TCR there was a transient loss of less phosphorylated forms of Pol II LS at 1–8 h after UV irradiation (lanes 2, 3, and 7) which subsequently returned to base-line levels. Similarly in XP-C cells, which are deficient in “genome overall” NER but which maintain TCR (41Venema J. van Hoffen A. Karcagi V. Natarajan A.T. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4128-4134Google Scholar), the level of less than maximally phosphorylated Pol II LS forms transiently diminishes but subsequently (and reproducibly) returns to at least base-line levels (lanes 12–15). Furthermore, when repair-competent fibroblasts were subjected to a higher dose of UV radiation (which would be expected to kill most cells; see Ref. 30Andrews A.D. Barrett S.F. Robbins J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 1984-1988Google Scholar) the loss of less phosphorylated forms of Pol II LS was also sustained (lanes 27–30). This study establishes that UV radiation induces ubiquitination of a fraction of Pol II LS which is followed by the degradation of a fraction of Pol II LS in the proteasome. Another recent study identified a specific ubiquitin-protein ligase (Rsp5) capable of ubiquitinating Pol II LS in vitro and in vivo(43Huibregtse J.M. Yang J.C. Beaudenon S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3656-3661Google Scholar). The ability to inhibit the UV-induced reduction of Pol II LS steady-state level with MG132 or lactacystin, two proteasomal inhibitors, supports the conclusion that degradation takes place in the proteasome (Fig. 3). Thus DNA repair-competent cells appear capable of temporarily down-regulating their Pol II LS level upon transcriptional arrest and then reaccumulating new Pol II LS when transcription resumes (Figs. 1and 6). In repair-deficient cells or in those repair-competent cells subjected to a lethal (50 J/m2) UV dose, Pol II LS levels remain low (Fig. 6). In XP-C cells, which maintain the ability to repair DNA damage and therefore recover transcriptional activity through TCR (they are only deficient in genome overall repair), Pol II LS levels also return to the base-line level within 16–24 h (Fig. 6). Evidence for post-transcriptional regulation of the Pol II LS level already exists in Caenorhabditis elegans (44Dalley B.K. Rogalski T.M. Tullis G.E. Riddle D.L. Golomb M. Genetics. 1993; 133: 237-245Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, α-amanitin and actinomycin D can also trigger Pol II LS degradation (45Nguyen V.T. Giannoni F. Dubois M.F. Seo S.J. Vigneron M. Kedinger C. Bensaude O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2924-2929Google Scholar). Pol II LS is a component of the nuclear matrix, and its degradation may render DNA more susceptible to fragmentation of the sort observed during apoptosis (46Damgaard J. Balslev Y. Mollgaard K. Wassermann K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 677-683Google Scholar). The results of this study are complicated by the fact that multiple phosphorylated forms of Pol II LS exist. Although the form that gets ubiquitinated is highly phosphorylated, the forms whose steady-state level decreases most rapidly are less phosphorylated (e.g.see Fig. 1 A). Because mAb H5, which is specific for highly phosphorylated Pol II LS (27Bregman D.B. Du L. van der Zee S. Warren S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 287-298Google Scholar), reacts with the ubiquitinated forms of Pol II LS (Fig. 1 A, lanes 14–17 and 20–23) it can be concluded that the ubiquitinated form of Pol II LS is also highly phosphorylated. Furthermore, an antibody that recognizes a non-phosphorylated CTD epitope (mAb 8WG16) does not react with the ubiquitinated forms (Fig. 1 B, lanes 14–17 and 20–23). It should be noted that both H14 and 8WG16 recognize overlapping broad Pol II LS bands because the CTD of one Pol II LS molecule may have phosphorylated as well as non-phosphorylated heptapeptides. Presumably, the number and identity of phosphorylated versus non-phosphorylated residues among the approximately 250 serines, threonines, and tyrosines within the CTD determine the migration rate in SDS-PAGE. A plausible interpretation of these steady-state results is that UV-induced ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Pol IIo prevent its being recycled (via dephosphorylation) to the IIa form so that the steady-state level of IIa diminishes. The pool of IIa gets converted to IIo via the action of one or more CTD kinases. Some CTD kinases phosphorylate IIa to IIo during the normal transcription cycle, and others may be activated by heat shock or other cellular stresses (47Dahmus M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 273: 185-193Google Scholar,48Venetianer A. Dubois M.F. Nguyen V.T. Bellier S. Seo S.J. Bensaude O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 83-92Google Scholar). In the present study, some reduction in the level of Pol IIo did become apparent when resynthesis of Pol II LS was prevented with cycloheximide (Fig. 2) or when XP-D cells were irradiated so that transcription could not resume (see Fig. 1 A). Although the present study does not demonstrate directly that the fraction of Pol II LS which gets ubiquitinated and degraded is stalled at intragenic lesions, the results are consistent with this conclusion. It is known that UV-induced DNA lesions constitute a potent block to transcription at which elongating Pol II becomes stably arrested (49Selby C.P. Drapkin R. Reinberg D. Sancar A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 787-793Google Scholar). The large subunit of arrested Pol II would be expected to exist in the IIo form. Western immunoblot analysis demonstrated that ubiquitinated Pol II LS reacts with mAb H5, which is specific for the IIo form. Although a previous study demonstrated a transcriptionally quiescent fraction of H5-immunoreactive Pol II LS present in structures called speckles or interchromatin granule clusters (27Bregman D.B. Du L. van der Zee S. Warren S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 287-298Google Scholar), we utilized the extractability of non-speckle-associated IIo with non-ionic detergent to strengthen the argument that the ubiquitinated IIo is not present in the speckles (Fig. 6). Furthermore, we have shown previously that UV-induced ubiquitination of Pol II LS is deficient in CS-A and CS-B fibroblasts, which have a defect in TCR. Thus it seems quite likely that elongating Pol II LS that arrests at intragenic DNA lesions becomes ubiquitinated and gets degraded in the proteasome. Future studies will be aimed at demonstrating directly that the stalled Pol II molecules get ubiquitinated. The results presented here also establish that ubiquitination occurs on non-CTD lysine residues (Fig. 5). It will be of interest to determine whether the ubiquitinated lysine residues are located within DNA binding domains and whether ubiquitination per se promotes dissociation of the stalled Pol II from the DNA before Pol II LS degradation in the proteasome. A current model of TCR in eukaryotes suggests that arrested transcripts back up, possibly assisted by elongation factor SII, then resume elongating after the lesion has been repaired (50Reines D. Mote Jr., J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1917-1921Google Scholar, 51Reines D. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 351-355Google Scholar). This model is supported by the stability of DNA·Pol II·pre-mRNA ternary complexes arrested at intragenic lesions in in vitro DNA damage systems as well as by the belief that it would be metabolically wasteful for cells to abort partially elongated RNA transcripts. An important implication of the results presented in this study is that an elongating Pol II complex that arrests at an intragenic lesion will not finish elongating the interrupted transcript after repair takes place. If Pol II LS is ubiquitinated and degraded in the proteasome it suggests that the arrested transcript is aborted. Thus eukaryotic Pol II LS may behave as Escherichia coli RNA polymerase behaves. In E. coli the product of the mfd gene, TRCF, releases the arrested DNA·RNA polymerase·RNA ternary complex and recruits the bacterial NER apparatus (the UvrA2UvrB1 complex) to the intragenic lesion (52Selby C.P. Sancar A. Science. 1993; 260: 53-58Google Scholar). Two lines of evidence (in addition to the results presented in this study) support the idea that SII, although essential for allowing Pol II to negotiate intrinsic pause sites, may be less important for TCR and/or the ability of cellular transcription levels to resume base-line levels after being arrested by UV-induced DNA damage. First, yeast with mutated SII does not demonstrate a deficiency in TCR (53Verhage R.A. Heyn J. van de Putte P. Brouwer J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 254: 284-290Google Scholar), suggesting that SII is not essential for either the preferential repair of intragenic DNA lesions or the ability of transcription to resume once such lesions have been repaired. Second, a recent in vitrostudy leads to the conclusion that SII may be more effective at allowing Pol II to bypass lesions that cause the slowing of transcriptional elongation than allowing Pol II to bypass transcriptional arrest sites (54Donahue B.A. Fuchs R.P.P. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10588-10594Google Scholar). In this study, a bulkyN-2-acetylaminofluorene-DNA adduct located on the transcribed strand served as an absolute block to elongating Pol II. SII did not increase the ability of Pol II to transcribe through such a lesion. SII did however improve the ability of Pol II to read through a transcriptional pause site created by placing the N-2-acetylaminofluorene adduct on the non-transcribed DNA strand. In another study, N-2-acetylaminofluorene located on the transcribed strand promoted the dissociation of the stalled ternary Pol II·DNA·RNA complex (55Chen Y.H. Matsumoto Y. Shibutani S. Bogenhagen D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9583-9587Google Scholar). Furthermore, although an elegantin vitro study demonstrated that SII promoted the retrograde (3′ to 5′) movement of Pol II from a T-T dimer, SII failed to displace stalled Pol II sufficiently to permit repair of the T-T dimer by photolyase (56Donahue B.A. Yin S. Taylor J.S. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8502-8506Google Scholar). The stalled Pol II complex appears to help recruit the repair apparatus to intragenic damage sites. It also appears to play a role in UV-induced signal transduction (57Bender K. Blattner C. Knebel A. Iordanov M. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1997; 37: 1-17Google Scholar) and may inhibit basal transcription by binding up nuclear transcription factors such as the TATA box-binding protein, TBP (42Coin F. Egly J.M. Mutat. Res. 1997; 379: S33Google Scholar). The ability to disassemble this complex, perhaps by degradation of Pol II LS, could be a critical step in the resolution of DNA damage response of the cell and the restoration of basal transcription after DNA repair is completed.

https://openalex.org/W2084279234,"Stimulation of macrophages with endotoxin and/or cytokines is responsible for the expression of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Because macrophages are exposed to low pH within the microenvironment of inflammatory lesions, the potential role of acidic pH as an additional regulator of iNOS was investigated. Substitution of the culture medium of rat peritoneal macrophages at pH 7.4 with medium at pH 7.0 up-regulated iNOS activity, as reflected by a 2.5-fold increase in nitrite accumulation. The increase in iNOS activity was associated with a similar increase in iNOS mRNA expression that reflected an increase in iNOS mRNA synthesis rather than stability. Low environmental pH-induced iNOS gene transcription involved the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) transcription factor since exposure of macrophages to low environmental pH both increased NF-κB binding activity in the nucleus and enhanced NF-κB-driven reporter gene expression. In addition, treatment of macrophages with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate orn-acetyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-norleucinal, two drugs preventing NF-κB translocation to the nucleus, canceled low pH-induced nitrite accumulation. The overall mechanism required the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). Indeed, 1) elevated TNFα bioactivity was observed in the medium of macrophages exposed to pH 7.0, and 2) incubation of macrophages with a neutralizing anti-TNFα antibody impaired both NF-κB activation and nitrite accumulation in response to acid challenge.

Acidosis is a hallmark of both ischemia and inflammation processes. The decrease of pH in tissue ischemia is secondary to the release of H+ during ATP hydrolysis and to the accumulation of CO2 (1Weinberg J.M. Kidney Int. 1991; 39: 476-500Google Scholar). The acidic environment in inflammatory lesions and abscesses (2Bryant R.E. Rashad A.L. Mazza J.A. Hammond D. J. Infect. Dis. 1980; 142: 594-601Google Scholar) is due to increased metabolic acid generation during cell activation. This originates primarily from the hexose monophosphate shunt, by the dissociation of hydrated CO2(3Wright J. Schwartz J.H. Olson R. Kosowsky J.M. Tauber A.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 782-788Google Scholar). In most cases, acidosis occurs along with nitric oxide (NO) 1The abbreviations used are: NO, nitric oxide; AP-1, activator protein 1; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HMA, 5-(N,N-hexamethylene) amiloride; iNOS, inducible NO synthase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; nor-LEU,n-acetyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-norleucinal; PDTC, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; IFN, interferon; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein; MEM, minimum Eagle's medium; IRF-1, interferon regulatory factor-1; DRB, 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl benzimidazole. generation. In ischemia, NO generation is due in one part to the acidification and reduction of the large pool of nitrite present within the tissue (4Zweier J.L. Wang P. Samouilov A. Kuppusamy P. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 804-809Google Scholar). In inflammatory processes, macrophage exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) causes the expression of the inducible isoform of NO synthase (NOS II or iNOS) that is responsible for high output production of NO (5Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Google Scholar). The expression of iNOS is regulated mainly at the transcriptional level. Analyses of the murine iNOS promoter have shown the presence of numerous consensus sequences for the binding of transcription factors (6Xie Q.-W. Whisnant R. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1779-1784Google Scholar, 7Lowenstein C.J. Alley E.W. Raval P. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9730-9734Google Scholar), of which nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (8Xie Q.-W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Google Scholar), interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) (9Martin E. Nathan C. Xie Q.-W. J. Exp.

Chem. 1977; 272: 1226-1230Google Scholar) are functionally important for iNOS induction. NF-κB is composed of a p50/p65 (or p50/RelA) heterodimer that is retained in the cytoplasm of macrophages by its binding to the inhibitory protein IκBα (11Grimm S. Bauerle P.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 297-308Google Scholar). Macrophage exposure to LPS or TNFα results in the rapid phosphorylation of IκBα and its degradation by the proteasome, allowing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus and promote iNOS gene transcription. Whether an acidic environment beside LPS and cytokines contributes to the regulation of iNOS in inflammatory processes has not been investigated. Thus, the experiments reported here were performed to investigate if a low environmental pH was able to activate iNOS in macrophages and, if so, to examine the signal transduction pathway involved. Our results provide the first evidence that, indeed, limited acidification of macrophage environment is sufficient to induce the expression of iNOS gene and the synthesis of NO. This effect is due to increased translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus. Additionally, our data show that an amplification loop involving TNFα production and NF-κB activation is required for this process. Resident macrophages were obtained from male Sprague-Dawley rats by peritoneal lavage with MEM (Life Technologies, Inc., Cergy Pontoise, France). Peritoneal cells were washed by centrifugation and then resuspended in MEM containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and supplemented with 10% FCS. Cells were plated either in 24-well culture plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) (106 cells in 0.5 ml/well) or in 60-mm Petri dishes (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) (107 cells in 5 ml). After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere, the nonadherent cells were removed by aspiration, and the macrophage monolayers were then overlaid with MEM supplemented with 1% FCS and adjusted by addition of HCl to pH ranging between 7.4 and 6.8. The pH of the culture medium was checked just before use. In addition, and when so indicated, culture media were supplemented with 5-(N,N-hexamethylene) amiloride (HMA, LC Services, Woburn, MA), monensin, actinomycin D, 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl benzimidazole (DRB), pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), orn-acetyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-norleucinal (nor-LEU) (all from Sigma) or anti-murine TNFα neutralizing antibody (106neutralizing units/ml; Genzyme, Cambridge, MA). At indicated times, cell-free culture supernatants were harvested and assayed for nitrite concentration. Adherent cells were used for nucleus or RNA extraction. RAW 264.7 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. Macrophages at 107 cells/ml were washed twice with MEM and loaded with the acetoxymethyl ester of 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF, Sigma) at 10 μm by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were washed twice, and the cell suspension was immediately analyzed in a Perkin-Elmer model LS-5 spectrofluorometer for the fluorescence of BCECF. The sample was alternately excited at 450 and 500 nm, and the emission was measured at 530 nm using 2.5-nm slits. At the end of each experimental procedure, the cells were permeabilized with 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, and aliquots of the suspension were titrated with 1n HCl and 1 n NaOH to establish the fluorescence at known pH values. Calibration curves of fluorescenceversus pH were obtained as described previously (12Baud L. Healy A. Cragoe E.J. Goetzl E.J. Koo C.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 136: 355-360Google Scholar). Inducible NOS activity was assayed indirectly by measuring nitrite production. Nitrite was measured by a colorimetric assay based on the Griess reaction, as described previously (13Boutard V. Havouis R. Fouqueray B. Philippe C. Moulinoux J.-P. Baud L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2077-2084Google Scholar). Briefly, 75-μl aliquots of macrophage-conditioned medium were incubated with 150-μl aliquots of Griess reagent (1% sulfanilamide, 0.1% naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride, 2.5% H3PO4). The absorbance was read at 540 nm after 15 min. Nitrite concentration was determined with reference to a standard curve by using concentrations from 1.5 to 50 μm sodium nitrite in culture media. Total RNA was isolated using a commercially available kit (Trizol reagent, Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA by using Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (200 units/μl; Life Technologies, Inc.). Reverse-transcribed samples were analyzed for iNOS and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)-specific cDNA by PCR amplification. Specific primers for iNOS and GAPDH were as follows: CACAAGGCCACATCGGATTTC (sense) and TGCATACCACTTCAACCCGAG (antisense); TCCCTCAAGATTGTCAGCAA (sense) and AGATCCACAA CGGATACATT (antisense), respectively (14Liu S. Adcock I.M. Old R.W. Barnes P.J. Evans T.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1208-1213Google Scholar). PCR was performed in a 50-μl reaction volume containing Taq polymerase buffer, deoxynucleotide mixture (0.2 mm each), MgCl2 (1.5 mm), Taq DNA polymerase (2.5 units) (Promega, Southampton, UK), oligonucleotide primers (0.5 μm each), and reverse-transcribed RNA. Complementary DNA was amplified in a temperature cycler as follows: 4 min at 94 °C, and 30–32 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C, with a final extension step of 10 min at 72 °C. Thirty and 32 PCR cycles were found in the exponential phase of PCR amplification of GAPDH and iNOS cDNA, respectively. Ten-μl samples of PCR products were analyzed on 1.7% agarose gels containing 0.2 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Densitometry of the bands was performed on the gels using an Imager scanner (Appligene, Illkirch, France) and NIH image densitometry software (version 1.44). Quantitative PCR amplification was carried out with a pair of primers of which one was biotinylated (15Lantz O. Bendelac A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1097-1106Google Scholar). Specific primers for iNOS and GAPDH were GGAGCTGTAGCACTGCATCAGAA (sense), AGACCTCTGGATCTTGACCGTGA (antisense), and GGTGAAGGTCGGTGTCAACGGA (sense), GCGGGATCGCGCTCCTGGAAGA (antisense), respectively. PCR was performed in a 50-μl reaction volume containing Taqpolymerase buffer, deoxynucleotide mixture (0.2 mm each), MgCl2 (1.5 mm), Taq DNA polymerase (1.25 units) (Promega) preincubated with Taq Start antibody (0.125 μl) (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), oligonucleotide primers (0.25 μm each), and reverse-transcribed RNA. Temperature was initially at 94 °C for 4 min, followed by cycles at 94 °C for 20 s, 60 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 40 s. At sequential cycle numbers, 5 μl of the reaction mixture was taken through oil and transferred onto avidin-coated microtiter plates for quantification of the amplified products by hybridization with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled internal oligonucleo tide probe. Specific probes for iNOS and GAPH were CGCTTCGATGTGCTGCCT and AGAAGGCAGCCCTGGTGA, respectively. The amount of probe was then measured by an alkaline-phosphatase coupled anti-fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody (16Alard P. Lantz O. Sebagh M. Calvo C.F. Weill D. Chavanel G. Senik A. Charpentier B. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 730-737Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from adherent macrophages by the method previously described (17Bertrand F. Philippe C. Antoine P.J. Baud L. Groyer A. Capeau J. Cherqui G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24435-24441Google Scholar) and were stored at −80 °C until analysis. Protein was determined by using the Bio-Rad reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Where indicated, nuclear extracts were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with polyclonal antibodies against p50 or RelA subunits of NF-κB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), before the binding reaction. The double-stranded NF-κB site probe: 5′-AGCTTCAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAGAGG-3′; 3′-AGTCTCCCCTGAAAGGCTCTCCA GCT-5′ (18Zabel U. Schreck R. Bauerle P.A. J. Biol.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2574-2578Google Scholar) were annealed and labeled using a commercially available kit (Rediprime DNA labeling system, Amersham Corp., Buckinghamshire, UK) in the presence of 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (10 mCi/ml, Amersham Corp.). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by passage through Nuctrap purification columns (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Binding reactions were carried out in a 20-μl binding reaction mixture (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 3 μg of poly(dI-dC)) containing 5–10 μg of nuclear proteins and the DNA probe (40,000–200,000 cpm). In some experiments, the binding reaction mixture also contained a large excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 25 min and fractionated by electrophoresis on a 7% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in TAE buffer (7 mmTris, pH 7.5, 3 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA), which had been pre-electrophoresed for 1 h at 80 V. Gels were run at 160 V for 2.5 h. Following electrophoresis, gels were transferred to No. 3MM paper (Whatman Ltd.), dried in a gel dryer under vacuum at 80 °C, and exposed to x-ray Hyperfilm-MP at −20 °C using an intensifying screen. RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with (Igκ)3-conaluc, a reporter plasmid that contains three copies of the immunoglobulin κ chain enhancer κB site upstream of the minimal conalbumin promoter fused to the luciferase reporter gene (generous gift from Dr. A. Israel, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France), using the DEAE-dextran procedure (6Xie Q.-W. Whisnant R. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1779-1784Google Scholar, 20Selden R.F. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 9.2.1-9.2.6Google Scholar). Briefly, after cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline solution, 10 μg of plasmid was added per 107 cells in 1 ml of warm Tris-buffered saline solution containing 250 μg of DEAE-dextran. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h followed by a 2-min shock with 10% Me2SO at room temperature. The cells were washed twice, plated in 35-mm plates at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml in 2 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Twenty-four h later, the medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 1% FCS and adjusted at different pH, and the cells were incubated for additional 2 h. The cells were then washed, exposed for 15 min to chilled lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, and 15% glycerol), and scraped. The lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. Luciferase activity was assayed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm ATP and 100 μm luciferin, using a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (Berthold Bad Wildbad, Germany) (17Bertrand F. Philippe C. Antoine P.J. Baud L. Groyer A. Capeau J. Cherqui G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24435-24441Google Scholar). The concentration of bioactive TNFα in the culture medium of macrophages was measured by a L-929 fibroblast lytic assay, as described previously (21Philippe C. Philippe B. Fouqueray B. Perez J. Lebret M. Baud L. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 1713-1723Google Scholar). Results were expressed as percent cytotoxicity. Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was determined by Student's t test. Substitution of the medium of adherent macrophages with media at different pH modified iNOS activity as reflected by changes in nitrite accumulation; as the environmental pH became more acidic, more nitrite was detected in the culture media (Fig. 1). Its amount plateaued at pH 6.9–7.0. Because modification of the microenvironmental pH generally induces parallel modification of the steady-state intracellular pH (22Mellergård P. Ou-Yang Y. Siesjö B.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C581-C589Google Scholar), involvement of intracellular acidification in this process was tested. First, intracellular pH decreased from 7.04 ± 0.03 to 6.77 ± 0.01 after lowering environmental pH from 7.4 to 6.9–7.0, as measured fluorimetrically with the H+ indicator dye BCECF. Second, pharmacological control of the Na+/H+antiport, which exchanges extracellular Na+ for intracellular H+, caused measurable changes in NO synthesis. As indicated in Fig. 2, the addition of the amiloride analog HMA, a Na+/H+exchange inhibitor which decreases intracellular pH (23Baud L. Perez J. Cherqui G. Cragoe E.J. Ardaillou R. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C232-C239Google Scholar), caused a dose-dependent increase in nitrite accumulation. Conversely, the addition of monensin, a Na+ ionophore mimicking the effects of the antiporter activation (24Ghigo D. Bussolino F. Garbarino G. Heller R. Turrini F. Pescarmona G. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Pegoraro L. Bosia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19437-19446Google Scholar), caused a dose-dependent decrease in nitrite accumulation. These results suggested that intracellular acidification was sufficient to trigger NO synthesis.Figure 2Effect of Na+/H+exchange on nitrite accumulation in the culture medium of macrophages. Adherent macrophages were treated with the indicated concentrations of HMA (▪) or monensin (▨) for 18 h, before nitrite analysis was performed. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of five separate experiments. *, p < 0.05 as compared with untreated macrophages.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Inducible NOS is susceptible to control mainly at the transcriptional level (6Xie Q.-W. Whisnant R. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1779-1784Google Scholar, 7Lowenstein C.J. Alley E.W. Raval P. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9730-9734Google Scholar). Thus DRB, a specific RNA polymerase II inhibitor, was used to determine to what extent nitrite accumulation in response to low environmental pH was due to increased transcription of the iNOS gene. Pretreatment of macrophages with this drug reduced nitrite accumulation in the macrophage culture medium adjusted at pH 7.4 and blunted the response to acid challenge (Fig. 3 A). To confirm the involvement of increased expression of the iNOS gene, semi-quantitative RT-PCR was first performed. A detectable expression of the iNOS mRNA was always observed in control macrophages, as described previously (25Chesrown S.E. Monnier J. Visner G. Nick H.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 126-134Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B). Exposure of cells to low environmental pH determined a marked increase in this mRNA expression. The amount of iNOS mRNA quantified by densitometry and expressed as iNOS/GAPDH ratio was 0.76 ± 0.11 and 1.75 ± 0.08 for macrophages exposed to culture medium at pH 7.4 and 7.0, respectively (p < 0.01, n = 3). For further verification, quantitative RT-PCR was performed (Fig. 3 C). The amount of iNOS mRNA was sharply increased in cells exposed to acidic pH as judged by the difference in the number of amplification cycles necessary to generate similar amounts of PCR products. Next, iNOS mRNA stability was assessed in actinomycin D experiments. After exposure to media at different pH for 1 h, macrophages were treated with actinomycin D to inhibit further transcription. At various times after the addition of actinomycin D, total RNA was isolated and examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-PCR (Fig. 3 C). The decay of iNOS mRNA, which was revealed by a shift to the right of OD curves, was enhanced in cells exposed to acidic pH. Thus low environmental pH increased iNOS mRNA expression by up-regulating its synthesis rather than its stability. The 5′-flanking region of mouse iNOS gene contains numerous consensus sequences for the binding of transcription factors, including NF-κB, IRF-1, STAT 1α, and AP-1 (6Xie Q.-W. Whisnant R. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1779-1784Google Scholar, 7Lowenstein C.J. Alley E.W. Raval P. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9730-9734Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that low environmental pH stimulates iNOS gene transcription by modulating the activity of some of these factors. To test the above hypothesis, the effect of extracellular pH on the DNA binding activity of these transcription factors was measured by EMSA. Nuclear extracts from control macrophages cultured at neutral environmental pH exhibited weak DNA binding activity to the NF-κB site-containing oligonucleotide (Fig. 4 A). As the environmental pH became more acidic, more binding activity of NF-κB was detected. At pH 7.0, NF-κB activation was similar to that promoted by LPS challenge. By contrast, acidic pH did not affect DNA binding activity of IRF-1, STAT 1α, or AP-1, whereas LPS was stimulatory (Fig. 4 B). The specificity of low pH-induced bands was assessed in competition experiments. These bands disappeared in the presence of the unlabeled oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB binding sites (Fig. 4 A). We further characterized the two NF-κB·DNA complexes by using antibodies directed against the p50 and RelA NF-κB subunits (Fig. 4 A). Incubation of macrophage nuclear extracts with the anti-p50 antibody reduced the density of both bands with a concomitant supershift suggesting the presence of p50 in the two complexes. The anti-RelA antibody suppressed the upper band suggesting the presence of RelA. Thus we identified the lower and upper complexes as the p50 homodimer and the p50/RelA heterodimer, respectively. To test whether low extracellular pH enhanced NF-κB-driven reporter gene expression, RAW 264.7 cells were transfected transiently with (Igκ)3-conaluc, a reporter plasmid in which the activity of the minimal conalbumin promoter could be enhanced by three copies of the NF-κB response element (17Bertrand F. Philippe C. Antoine P.J. Baud L. Groyer A. Capeau J. Cherqui G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24435-24441Google Scholar). Luciferase activity from such transfected cells after exposure to media at different pH is shown in Fig. 5; low pH stimulation of luciferase activity was analogous to that of nitrite accumulation under the same conditions. The contribution of NF-κB in low pH-induced iNOS up-regulation was investigated using two inhibitors of NF-κB activation in macrophages as follows: the thiol compound PDTC, a radical scavenger (26Schreck R. Rieber P. Bauerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Google Scholar), and the peptide aldehyde nor-LEU, a proteasome inhibitor (27Griscavage J.M. Wilk S. Ignarro L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3308-3312Google Scholar). Addition of either drug blunted the macrophage response to low environmental pH (Fig. 6). Because NF-κB initiates the transcription of a variety of genes that are all involved in inflammatory processes, it is likely that low environmental pH-induced NF-κB activation amplifies the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines beside that of iNOS. To address this issue, the capacity of macrophages exposed to acidic pH to release bioactive TNFα was determined. Fig. 7 shows that a decrease in environmental pH from 7.4 to 7.0 caused a 1.8-fold increase in TNFα release. PDTC blunted this response. We next evaluated whether the rise of TNFα level in the culture medium of macrophages was involved in the observed increase in nitrite accumulation. To this end, a neutralizing anti-TNFα antibody diluted at 1/100 was added to the culture medium. This concentration was sufficient to totally inactivate the TNFα released by macrophages (data not shown). Anti-TNFα both prevented the activation of NF-κB and suppressed the accumulation of nitrites (Fig. 8), indicating that an autocrine loop involving TNFα induction of NF-κB was responsible for the induction of iNOS by low environmental pH.Figure 8Activation of NF-κB and iNOS in response to low environmental pH requires the autocrine production of TNFα. A, effects of anti-TNFα antibody on NF-κB activation. Adherent macrophages were cultured for 2 h in MEM adjusted at indicated pH and supplemented with or without anti-TNFα neutralizing antibody, before NF-κB activity was assayed.

Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. of 10 separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Our results provide evidence that low environmental pH stimulates NO synthesis by macrophages and, more specifically, up-regulates iNOS mRNA expression. These responses were observed for a range of extracellular pH values occurring in inflammatory lesions (2Bryant R.E. Rashad A.L. Mazza J.A. Hammond D. J. Infect. Dis. 1980; 142: 594-601Google Scholar). The decrease in intracellular pH in macrophages exposed to low environmental pH and the increase in nitrite accumulation in the culture medium of macrophages treated by the amiloride analog HMA indicate that acidic intracellular pH is involved in triggering NO synthesis. Since NO has been shown to impair intracellular pH recovery in macrophages following acid loading (28Swallow C.J. Grinstein S. Sudsbury R.A. Rotstein O.D. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1009-1021Google Scholar), an amplification loop involving low pH induction of NO synthesis is likely in these cells. The mechanisms responsible for low pH-induced NO synthesis are potentially numerous. First, changes in pH might affect the activity of the enzyme iNOS. Indeed, in vitro analysis has shown that iNOS activity was pH-dependent (29Yaqoob M. Edelstein C.L. Wieder E.D. Alkhunaizi A.M. Gengaro P.E. Nemenoff R.A. Schrier R.W. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1314-1319Google Scholar). However, the optimum activity was reached at pH 8.0, whereas reduced activity occurred at acidic pH. Second, a low environmental pH might influence the availability of substrates such as l-arginine and cofactors necessary for NO production. However, l-arginine and its precursor, l-citrulline, are transported by pH-insensitive specific carriers (30Baydoun A.R. Bogle R.G. Pearson J.D. Mann G.E. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 112: 487-492Google Scholar). In fact, the main rate-limiting step for NO production by macrophages in low environmental pH is transcriptional since DRB blunted this response. The possibility that pH controls the transcription of genes has been demonstrated previously. For instance, Yamaji et al. (31Yamaji Y. Moe O.W. Miller R.T. Alpern R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1297-1303Google Scholar) reported that exposure of epithelial cells from mouse proximal tubule to an acid environment led to transcriptional activation of immediate early genes such as c-fos and c-jun. Similarly, an acute decrease in extracellular pH from 7.4 to 6.9 caused a marked increase in the expression of mRNA for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in epithelial cells from pig proximal tubule (32Kaiser S. Curthoys N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9397-9402Google Scholar). Transcription factors such as NF-κB (8Xie Q.-W. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Google Scholar), IRF-1 (9Martin E. Nathan C. Xie Q.-W. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 977-984Google Scholar, 33Spink J. Evans T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24417-24425Google Scholar), and STAT 1α (10Gao J. Morrison D.C. Parmely T.J. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 272: 1226-1230Google Scholar) underlie the synergistic activation of the promoter of the murine iNOS gene in response to LPS and IFN-γ. Thus, we directly assessed the ability of environmental pH to control the induction or the activation of these factors. By using an EMSA we observed that low environmental pH increased the DNA binding activity of NF-κB. The stimulatory effect was specific for NF-κB since the DNA binding activity of IRF-1 and STAT 1α was not modified under these conditions. Dose-response experiments indicated a biphasic effect. A slightly acidic environment (7.2 to 6.9) amplified NF-κB activation (Fig. 4 A), whereas a more acidic environment (below 6.9) reduced NF-κB activation (data not shown). The inhibitory effect of marked acidosis on NF-κB activation has already been demonstrated (34Douvdevani A. Abramson O. Tamir A. Konforty A. Isakov N. Chaimovitz C. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 1537-1545Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that weak acidosis in settling inflammation may amplify NF-κB-dependent iNOS expression, resulting in a more efficient defense against bacteria. Once acid generation is high, protons may limit the induction of iNOS and prevent its toxicity toward the surrounding tissue. The mechanisms whereby low environmental pH increases NF-kB activation may include up-regulation of NF-κB synthesis and/or down-regulation of NF-κB degradation and/or reduction of NF-κB binding to cytosolic IκB. Acidic pH could potentially alter the linkage between NF-κB and IκB without modifying IκB phosphorylation or degradation (11Grimm S. Bauerle P.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 297-308Google Scholar). However, the fact that the low environmental pH responses could be abrogated by addition of PDTC or nor-LEU is consistent with the involvement of IκB degradation. Indeed, both drugs prevent IκB inactivation as follows: PDTC, as other antioxidants, limits IκB phosphorylation and nor-LEU, as other proteasome inhibitors, inhibits IκB degradation but not phosphorylation (27Griscavage J.M. Wilk S. Ignarro L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3308-3312Google Scholar). Furthermore, the results of experiments with nor-LEU suggest that low environmental pH induces NF-κB activation by promoting IκB degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Our study did not address the relationship between environmental pH and expression of proteins involved in this pathway. However, Bailey et al. (35Bailey J.L. Wang X. England B.K. Price S.R. Ding X. Mitch W.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1447-1453Google Scholar) recently reported that acidosis in chronic renal failure stimulated muscle proteolysis by activating the ATP-ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent pathway. This response included increased transcription of genes encoding ubiquitin and proteasome subunits C3 and C9. Thus, further studies would be required to determine whether low environmental pH induces NF-κB activation in macrophages by these mechanisms. In addition, a possibility to explain the in vivo effect of low pH on the transcription step is that acidosis could directly affect the binding of NF-κB subunits to DNA. However, this is unlikely. Indeed, studies by Zabel et al. (18Zabel U. Schreck R. Bauerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 252-260Google Scholar) have demonstrated that NF-κB could form a complex with DNA within a large pH range, the highest amount of protein-DNA complex being formed at the physiological pH of 7.5. The NF-κB transcription factor regulates the transcription of a great variety of genes that are involved in inflammatory responses. They include genes coding for cytokines such as IFN-β, interleukin-1, -2, -6, and -8, granulocyte/macrophage or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, TNFα, as well as genes coding for acute phase response proteins and cell adhesion molecules (reviewed in Ref. 36Kopp E.B. Ghosh S. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 58: 1-27Google Scholar). One could speculate that transcription of these genes might be similarly susceptible to induction by low environmental pH. Accordingly, acidosis was found to potentiate TNFα synthesis by macrophages (Fig. 7). We addressed the issue of whether low environmental pH-induced TNFα synthesis was in turn responsible for NO synthesis by using a neutralizing antibody specific for TNFα (Fig. 8). This antibody blunted both NF-κB activation and nitrite accumulation. Thus, TNFα appears to be involved in NF-κB activation which eventually leads to iNOS gene transcription. A similar amplification loop involving TNFα induction of NF-κB has been already described. For instance, O'Connell et al. (37O'Connell M.A. Cleere R. Long A. O'Neill L.A.J. Kelleher D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7399-7404Google Scholar) demonstrated that the proliferation rate of cells derived from a Sezary lymphoma was stimulated by the autocrine production of TNFα. This response resulted from the activation of NF-κB which also led to further TNFα production. In summary, in addition to hypoxia (38Melillo G. Musso T. Sica A. Taylor L.S. Cox G.W. Varesio L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1683-1693Google Scholar), LPS, and cytokines (5Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Google Scholar), low environmental pH causes amplification of NO synthesis in inflammatory tissues. Evidence that this up-regulation is mediated through the activation of NF-κB suggests a novel mechanism whereby the nuclear translocation of this transcription factor may be triggered. Our studies also suggest that correction of acidosis in inflammatory processes may have a therapeutic role by limiting the transcription of cytokine genes with a conserved NF-κB binding site in the promoter.

Here, we show that triggering the ceramide pathway by sphingomyelinase or C2- and C6-ceramide enhances collagenase-1 (matrix metalloproteinase-1; MMP-1) gene expression by fibroblasts. C2-ceramide activates three distinct mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in dermal fibroblasts, i.e.extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), stress-activated protein kinase/Jun N-terminal-kinase (SAPK/JNK), and p38. Stimulation of MMP-1 promoter activity by C2-ceramide is dependent on the presence of a functional AP-1 cis-element and is entirely inhibited by overexpression of MAPK inhibitor, dual specificity phosphatase CL100 (MAPK phosphatase-1). Activation of MMP-1 promoter by C2-ceramide is also effectively inhibited by kinase-deficient forms of ERK1/2 kinase (MEK1/2) activator Raf-1, ERK1 and ERK2, SAPK/JNK activator SEK1, or SAPKβ.

These results show that triggering the ceramide signaling pathway activates MMP-1 gene expression via three distinct MAPK pathways, i.e. ERK1/2, SAPK/JNK, and p38, and suggest that targeted modulation of the ceramide signaling pathway may offer a novel therapeutic approach for inhibiting collagenolytic activity, e.g. in inflammatory disorders. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IL, interleukin; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; SAPK/JNK, stress-activated protein kinase/Jun N-terminal kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; SEK1, SAPK/ERK kinase-1; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; CS, calf serum; kb, kilobase pair; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; mU, milliunit(s). are a family of zinc-dependent metalloendopeptidases collectively capable of degrading essentially all extracellular matrix components (1Birkedal-Hansen H.

Dermatol. 1997; 6: 199-213Google Scholar). MMPs play an important role in tissue remodeling during fetal development, angiogenesis, and tissue repair, and they are also responsible for excessive breakdown of connective tissue in inflammatory disorders, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, autoimmune blistering disorders of skin, dermal photoaging, and periodontitis (1Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G.I. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Google Scholar, 2Kähäri V.-M. Saarialho-Kere U. Exp. Dermatol. 1997; 6: 199-213Google Scholar). In addition, degradation of basement membrane and extracellular matrix by MMPs is crucial for invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. To date, the MMP gene family consists of 16 members, which according to structure and substrate specificity can be divided into subgroups of collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins, and membrane-type MMPs (2Kähäri V.-M. Saarialho-Kere U. Exp. Dermatol. 1997; 6: 199-213Google Scholar). Collagenase-1 (MMP-1) is the principal fibroblast-derived secreted neutral proteinase capable of degrading native fibrillar collagens of types I, II, III, and V, and it apparently plays an important role in the remodeling of collagenous connective tissues in various physiological and pathological situations. The expression of MMP-1 by fibroblasts is potently up-regulated by cytokines, growth factors, and tumor promoters (see Refs. 1Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G.I. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Google Scholar, 2Kähäri V.-M. Saarialho-Kere U. Exp. Dermatol. 1997; 6: 199-213Google Scholar, 3Mauviel A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 288-295Google Scholar). Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is a proinflammatory cytokine, which potently inhibits accumulation of connective tissue components. TNF-α stimulates degradation of extracellular matrix by inducing the expression of MMP-1 and stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) by fibroblasts (4Brenner D.A. O'Hara M. Angel P. Chojkier M. Karin M. Nature. 1989; 337: 661-663Google Scholar, 5MacNaul K.L. Chartrain N. Lark M. Tocci M.J. Hutchinson N.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17238-17245Google Scholar, 6Westermarck J. Häkkinen L. Fiers W. Kähäri V.-M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 197-202Google Scholar). In addition, TNF-α inhibits type I collagen gene expression by fibroblasts in culture (6Westermarck J. Häkkinen L. Fiers W.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11692-11700Google Scholar) gene expression at the transcriptional level, and is able to abrogate the activation of type I collagen and elastin gene expression by transforming growth factor-β (9Kähäri V.-M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 26134-26141Google Scholar). The effects of TNF-α on extracellular matrix formation partially overlap with those of interleukin-1 (IL-1), which also induces expression of MMP-1 and MMP-3 in fibroblasts (see Refs. 1Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G.I. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Google Scholar, 2Kähäri V.-M. Saarialho-Kere U. Exp.

Chem. 1990; 265: 17238-17245Google Scholar). The cellular effects of TNF-α are mediated by two distinct cell surface receptors: TNF-RI (TNF-R55) and TNF-RII (TNF-R75), both of which are expressed by fibroblastic cells (see Ref. 13Vandenabeele P. Declerq W. Beyaert R. Fiers W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 392-399Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the effects of TNF-α on the expression of MMP-1, MMP-3, and type I collagen in dermal fibroblasts are primarily mediated by TNF-R55 (6Westermarck J. Häkkinen L. Fiers W. Kähäri V.-M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 197-202Google Scholar). It has been shown that binding of TNF-α to TNF-R55 activates neutral sphingomyelinase, a cell membrane-associated phospholipase, which hydrolyzes cell membrane structural phospholipid sphingomyelin to phosphocholine and ceramide, a novel lipid second messenger (see Refs. 14Spiegel S. Foster D. Kolesnick R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 159-167Google Scholar and 15Obeid L. Hannun Y.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 191-198Google Scholar). The role of the ceramide pathway in TNF-α-induced apoptosis in various cells has been recently elucidated (15Obeid L. Hannun Y.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 191-198Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that ceramides activate the expression of cyclooxygenase, stimulate synthesis of prostaglandin E2 (16Ballou L.R. Chao C.P. Holness M.A. Barker S.C. Raghow R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20044-20050Google Scholar), and enhance production of IL-6 by cultured fibroblasts (17Laulederkind S.J. Bielawska A. Raghow R. Hannun Y.A. Ballou L.H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 599-604Google Scholar), indicating a role for this signaling pathway in mediating the inflammatory effects of TNF-α on fibroblasts. However, the role of the ceramide pathway as a mediator of the effects of TNF-α and IL-1 on the synthesis and degradation of extracellular matrix is not known. In this study, we show for the first time that triggering the ceramide pathway with neutral sphingomyelinase or cell-permeable ceramides in human skin fibroblasts results in marked stimulation of MMP-1 expression and that this effect is dependent on the presence of a functional AP-1 cis-element in the MMP-1 promoter region as well as on the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), stress-activated protein kinase/Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). These results show that the effects of TNF-α and IL-1 on MMP-1 gene expression can be mimicked by activating the ceramide pathway in dermal fibroblasts, suggesting that targeted modulation of this pathway may offer a novel approach for therapeutic inhibition of matrix degradation, e.g. in inflammatory disorders. Neutral sphingomyelinase (fromStaphylococcus aureus) and cycloheximide were obtained from Sigma. C2- and C6-ceramide, C2-dihydroceramide, and PD 98059 were obtained from Calbiochem. SB 203580 was provided by SmithKline Beecham (King of Prussia, PA). Human recombinant interleukin-1β was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany). Human TNF-R55-specific TNF-α (double mutant R32W/S86T) (18Barbara J.A.J. Smith W.B. Gamble J.R. Van Ostade X. Vandenabeele P. Tavernier J. Fiers W. Vadas M.A. Lopez A.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 843-850Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Walter Fiers (University of Gent, Belgium). Normal human skin fibroblast cultures were established from punch biopsy obtained from a voluntary healthy male donor (age 23) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mmglutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Murine NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and cultured in similar medium supplemented with 10% calf serum (CS). For experiments, fibroblast cultures were maintained in culture medium supplemented with 0.5% FCS for 18 h. Thereafter, sphingomyelinase, ceramides, TNF-R55-specific human TNF-α, or IL-1β was added in concentrations and combinations indicated, and incubations were continued for 24 h. In experiments involving MAPK inhibitors or cycloheximide, these were added to the cultures 1 h prior to the addition of ceramides. To estimate the viability of cells after a 24-h incubation with ceramides and sphingomyelinase, cells were washed with PBS and stained with 0.4% trypan blue in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min. Cells were then washed with PBS and fixed with 10% formaldehyde, and the number of stained cells was counted. Total cellular RNA was isolated from cell cultures using the single step method (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Aliquots of total RNA were fractionated on 0.8% agarose gels containing 2.2 mformaldehyde, transferred to Zeta Probe filters (Bio-Rad) by vacuum transfer (VacuGene XL, LKB, Bromma, Sweden), and immobilized by heating at 80 °C for 30 min. The filters were prehybridized for 2 h and subsequently hybridized for 20 h with cDNAs labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using random priming. The filters were then washed, the final stringency being 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C (20Westermarck J. Lohi J. Keski-Oja J. Kähäri V.-M. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 1205-1213Google Scholar). The following cDNAs were used for hybridizations: a 2.0-kb human cDNA for collagenase-1 (MMP-1) (21Goldberg G.I. Wilhelm S.M. Kronberger A. Bauer E.A. Grant G.A. Eisen A.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6600-6605Google Scholar); a 1.5-kb human cDNA for stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) (22Saus J. Quinones S. Otani Y. Nagase H. Harris Jr., E.D. Kurkinen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6742-6745Google Scholar); a 0.7-kb human cDNA for TIMP-1 (23Carmichael D.F. Sommer A. Thompson R.G. Anderson D.C. Smith C.G. Welgus H.G. Stricklin G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Google Scholar); a human 0.4-kb cDNA for c-jun (25Angel P. Allegretto E.A. Okino S.T. Hattori K. Boyle W.J. Hunter T. Karin M. Nature. 1988; 332: 166-171Google Scholar); a human 1.2-kb cDNA for junB(26Schütte J. Viallet J. Nau M. Segal S. Fedorko J. Minna J. Cell. 1989; 89: 987-997Google Scholar); and a human 3.1-kb genomic fragment for c-fos(obtained from Amersham Corp.). The [32P]cDNA-mRNA hybrids were visualized by autoradiography, and the mRNA levels were quantitated by scanning densitometry of the autoradiographs using MCID software (Imaging Research Inc., St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada). MMP-1 and MMP-3 mRNA levels were corrected for the levels of GAPDH mRNA in the same samples. The cells were maintained in serum-free DMEM for 18 h, after which sphingomyelinase (100 mU/ml) or C2-ceramide (10 μm) was added either alone or in combination with TNF-R55-specific TNF-α (20 ng/ml) or IL-1β (5 units/ml), and the incubations were continued for 24 h. Equal aliquots of the conditioned media, relative to cell number (27Kueng W. Silber E. Eppenberger U. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 16-19Google Scholar) were analyzed for the amount of MMP-1 by Western blotting, as described previously (6Westermarck J. Häkkinen L. Fiers W. Kähäri V.-M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 197-202Google Scholar) using a polyclonal rabbit antiserum against human MMP-1 (kindly provided by Dr. Henning Birkedal-Hansen, NIDR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), in a 1:2000 dilution, and the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham). The levels of immunoreactive MMP-1 were quantitated by densitometric scanning of the x-ray films. Confluent NIH-3T3 fibroblast cultures were transiently transfected either with 4 μg of the construct p2278CLCAT, which contains 2.278 kb of the human MMP-1 promoter linked to the CAT reporter gene, or with a similar construct with a mutated AP-1 element (28Pierce R.A. Sandefur S. Doyle G.A.R. Welgus H.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1890-1899Google Scholar) (both kindly provided by Dr. William C. Parks (Washington University, St. Louis, MO)). In co-transfection experiments, the cells were transiently transfected with the MMP-1 promoter/CAT construct pCLCAT3 (2 μg), which contains 3.8 kb of the 5′-flanking region of human MMP-1 gene linked to the CAT gene (29Frisch S.M. Reich R. Collier I.E. Genrich L.T. Martin G. Goldberg G.I. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 75-83Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. Steven Frisch (La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation, La Jolla, CA)), together with 10 μg of the following expression plasmids: RSV/AS-c-jun (30Mauviel A. Chung K.-Y. Agarwal A. Tamai K. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10917-10923Google Scholar), a c-junantisense expression construct (kindly provided by Dr. Alain Mauviel (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA)); SG5-CL100 (31Alessi D.R. Smythe C. Keyse S.M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2015-2020Google Scholar) for MAPK inhibitor; dual specificity phosphatase CL100 (MAPK phosphatase-1) (32Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. Steven Keyse (Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, Scotland)); RSV-Raf-C4 (33Bruder T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 6: 545-556Google Scholar) for kinase-deficient Raf-1 and SAPKβKK→RR (34Ludwig S. Engel K. Hoffmeyer A. Sithanandam G. Neufeld B. Palm D. Gaestel M. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6687-6697Google Scholar) for kinase-deficient SAPKβ (both kindly provided by Dr. Ulf Rapp (University of Würzburg, Germany)); pEBG-SEK1-K→R (35Sánchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zion L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Google Scholar), specific for kinase-deficient SEK1 (kindly provided by Dr. John Kyriakis (Harvard University, Boston, MA)); and CEp4LK71RERK1 or CEp4LK52RERK2 (36Frost J.A. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. Feramisco J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3844-3848Google Scholar), specific for kinase-deficient ERK1 and ERK2, respectively (kindly provided by Dr. Melanie Cobb, Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Control cultures were co-transfected in parallel with the respective empty expression vectors. Transfections were performed with the calcium phosphate/DNA co-precipitation method, followed by a 2-min glycerol shock, as described previously (20Westermarck J. Lohi J. Keski-Oja J. Kähäri V.-M. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 1205-1213Google Scholar). The cultures were then maintained in DMEM and 1% CS for 16 h, C2-ceramide was added, and the incubations were continued for 24 h. Cells were harvested and lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing. As an index of promoter activity, CAT activity was measured from aliquots of cell extracts in reactions containing 0.25 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 5 μg of n-butyryl-coenzyme A (Sigma), and 0.0625 μCi of [14C]chloramphenicol (Amersham), in a total volume of 125 μl. The butyrylated chloramphenicol products were extracted with 300 μl of xylene after overnight incubation at 37 °C. The CAT activity was quantitated by scintillation counting after two back-extractions of the xylene phase with 100 μl of 0.25 m Tris-HCl. The transfection efficiency was monitored by co-transfecting cells with 4 μg of RSV/β-galactosidase construct and correcting the CAT activities for β-galactosidase activity (20Westermarck J. Lohi J. Keski-Oja J. Kähäri V.-M. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 1205-1213Google Scholar). For assay of ERK1/2 and SAPK/JNK activity, confluent cultures of human skin fibroblasts were incubated for 18 h in DMEM containing 0.5% FCS. Thereafter, ceramide was added, and the incubations were continued for different periods of time. Cells (2 × 106/sample) were lysed in 400 μl of lysis buffer (PBS, pH 7.4; 1% Nonidet P-40; 0.5% sodium deoxycholate; 1 mm Na3VO4; 0.1% SDS; 1 mm EDTA; 1 mm EGTA; 20 mmNaF; 1 mm PMSF; and 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). For immunoprecipitation of ERK1/2, cell lysates were centrifuged (3000 × g for 15 min), and the supernatant was incubated with an antibody generated against ERK2 (p42 MAPK; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), coupled to protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). This antibody also cross-reacts with ERK1. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer and three times in kinase assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). The kinase reaction was carried out by adding to the immunoprecipitate 20 μl of kinase assay buffer, including 25 μm ATP, 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham), and 1 μg/μl myelin basic protein (Sigma) as substrate. The reaction was carried out for 15 min at 37 °C and stopped by adding 3 × Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were resolved on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and myelin basic protein phosphorylation was quantified with a phosphor imager (Bio-Rad). To measure SAPK/JNK activity, the cells were lysed in 400 μl of lysis buffer as described above. The cell lysates were centrifuged (3000 × g for 15 min), and SAPK/JNK was immunoprecipitated by incubating the supernatant with an antibody generated against SAPK/JNK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) coupled to protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer, three times in LiCl wash buffer (500 mm LiCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol), and three times in kinase assay buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol). The kinase reaction was carried out by adding to the immunoprecipitate 20 μl of kinase assay buffer, including 25 μm ATP, 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham), and 6 μg of bacterially expressed glutathioneS-transferase-c-Jun (a kind gift from Eleanor Coffey, Åbo Akademi, Turku, Finland) as substrate. The reaction was carried out for 20 min at 37 °C and stopped by the addition of 3 × Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were resolved on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and c-Jun phosphorylation was quantified as above. To determine the activation of p38 MAPK, confluent cultures of human skin fibroblasts were treated with C2-ceramide for different periods of time and lysed in 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were then sonicated, fractionated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham). The levels of activated, phosphorylated p38 in the samples were determined by Western blotting performed as described above using a phosphospecific p38 antibody (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in a 1:400 dilution. The levels of activated p38 were quantitated by densitometric scanning of the x-ray films. To elucidate the role of ceramide pathway in the regulation of fibroblast collagenase (collagenase-1, MMP-1) gene expression, we first activated this signaling pathway by treatment of human skin fibroblasts with S. aureus neutral sphingomyelinase for 24 h and assayed MMP-1 mRNA levels with Northern blot hybridizations. As shown in Fig. 1 A, sphingomyelinase treatment of cells with 1 mU/ml resulted in a marked enhancement (7-fold) in MMP-1 mRNA expression, and an even more potent increase (14-fold) was noted with a concentration of 100 mU/ml after correction of the MMP-1 mRNA abundance for the level of GAPDH mRNA in the same samples (Fig. 1 A). Next, we triggered the ceramide pathway in dermal fibroblasts by treatment with cell-permeable ceramide analogs C6- and C2-ceramide. Exposure of cells to C6-ceramide resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of MMP-1 mRNA abundance (6- and 19-fold) with concentrations of 10 and 100 μm, respectively (Fig. 1 B). The mRNA abundance for TIMP-1 was slightly (25%) reduced with the highest C6-ceramide concentration when corrected for the levels of GAPDH mRNA (Fig. 1 B). In a parallel experiment, fibroblasts were treated with different concentrations of C2-ceramide, which stimulated the expression of MMP-1 mRNA even more potently (22- and 385-fold) with the two highest concentrations, 10 and 100 μm, respectively (Fig. 1 C). In addition, the level of stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) mRNA was markedly enhanced with C2-ceramide (100 μm). Treatment of cells with an inactive ceramide analog, C2-dihydroceramide (10 μm) had no effect on MMP-1, MMP-3, or TIMP-1 mRNAs (not shown). The viability of fibroblasts was only affected by 100 μmC2-ceramide, whereas lower concentrations of C2-ceramide as well as all concentrations of C6-ceramide or sphingomyelinase used did not affect the viability of cells as estimated by trypan blue exclusion (not shown). To examine the effect of sphingomyelinase and C2-ceramide on the production of MMP-1 by dermal fibroblasts, we assayed the amount of immunoreactive MMP-1 in the conditioned media of cells treated with sphingomyelinase (100 mU/ml) and C2-ceramide (10 μm) using Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2 A, both sphingomyelinase and C2-ceramide stimulated production of MMP-1 by fibroblasts by 5-fold. We have recently shown that the effect of TNF-α on MMP-1 expression in dermal fibroblasts is primarily mediated via TNF-R55 (6Westermarck J. Häkkinen L. Fiers W. Kähäri V.-M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 197-202Google Scholar). In this context, we examined whether the activation of the ceramide pathway by sphingomyelinase augments the maximal enhancement of MMP-1 production obtained with 20 ng/ml TNF-R55-specific TNF-α (6Westermarck J. Häkkinen L. Fiers W. Kähäri V.-M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 197-202Google Scholar). In this experiment, TNF-R55-specific TNF-α enhanced production of immunoreactive MMP-1 into the culture media of dermal fibroblasts 45-fold, and simultaneous treatment with sphingomyelinase (100 mU/ml) potentiated this stimulation of MMP-1 production 1.8-fold, the final stimulation being 81-fold, as compared with the untreated control cultures (Fig. 2 B). The cellular signaling of IL-1 also involves activation of neutral sphingomyelinase and subsequent triggering of the ceramide pathway (14Spiegel S. Foster D. Kolesnick R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 159-167Google Scholar,15Obeid L. Hannun Y.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 58: 191-198Google Scholar). Therefore, we also examined the effect of sphingomyelinase on IL-1β-elicited induction of MMP-1 production. As expected, IL-1β (5 units/ml) enhanced (18-fold) the production of immunoreactive MMP-1 by dermal fibroblasts (Fig. 2 C), and sphingomyelinase augmented this maximal IL-1β-elicited induction of MMP-1 production by 2.7-fold, the final enhancement being 49-fold over the control cells (Fig. 2 C). Stimulation of MMP-1 gene transcription by various stimuli involves induction of dimeric AP-1 trans-activating factor complex (Jun plus Fos), which binds to the correspondingcis-element in the MMP-1 promoter (see Refs. 1Birkedal-Hansen H.

Dermatol. 1997; 6: 199-213Google Scholar, 3Mauviel A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 288-295Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of C2-ceramide on the expression of members of Jun and Fos families in dermal fibroblasts. Treatment of cells with C2-ceramide (100 μm) resulted in rapid stimulation of c-jun mRNA expression, first noted at 1 h of incubation with further increase up to 6 h (Fig. 3 A). The levels of junB mRNA were also enhanced by C2-ceramide, the peak induction noted at 2 and 6 h (Fig. 3 A). In addition, a rapid induction of c-fos mRNA was detected maximally after 1- and 2-h incubations (Fig. 3 A). Interestingly, the levels of c-jun, junB, and c-fos mRNAs were still enhanced after 24 h (Fig. 3 A). In the same experiment, the expression of MMP-1 mRNA was first induced after a 6-h exposure to C2-ceramide (Fig. 3 A). In parallel experiments, C6-ceramide (100 μm) and sphingomyelinase (100 mU/ml) also induced expression of MMP-1 mRNA with similar kinetics (not shown). As shown in Fig. 3 B, enhancement of MMP-1 expression by C2-ceramide was abrogated by co-treatment of cells with cycloheximide (10 μg/ml). Similarly, activation of MMP-1 expression by sphingomyelinase was inhibited by cycloheximide (not shown). These observations show that ceramide-elicited activation of MMP-1 gene expression is dependent on synthesis of new regulatory proteins. To examine whether ceramide treatment of fibroblasts results in transcriptional activation of MMP-1 promoter, we transiently transfected NIH-3T3 fibroblasts with an MMP-1 promoter/CAT construct p2278CLCAT, in which a 2.278-kb human MMP-1 promoter segment is linked to the CAT reporter gene. Treatment of transiently transfected NIH-3T3 cells with C2-ceramide (50 μm) potently (7.7-fold) enhanced the activity of this MMP-1 promoter construct (Fig. 3 C). To elucidate the role of AP-1 in ceramide-elicited activation of the MMP-1 promoter, we transfected parallel cultures with an MMP-1 promoter/CAT construct containing the same promoter segment except with a mutation rendering the AP-1 binding site at −72 to −65 incapable of binding AP-1. As shown in Fig. 3 C, loss of the functional AP-1 cis-element reduced the basal activity of p2278CLCAT by 95%. Interestingly, the C2-ceramide-elicited enhancement of the MMP-1 promoter construct lacking the AP-1 element was clearly lower (2.4-fold), as compared with the wild type MMP-1 promoter, the final promoter activity being 12% of the untreated wild type (Fig. 3 C). To elucidate the role of c-Jun in ceramide-mediated activation of the MMP-1 promoter, we transiently co-"

OCIF is present both as a ∼60-kDa monomer and a disulfide-linked homodimer. We attempted to characterize the seven structural domains of OCIF by determining the capabilities of various OCIF mutants to inhibit osteoclastogenesis, to interact with heparin, and to form dimers. We also examined a potential of domains 5 and 6, death domain homologous regions (DDHs), for inducing cell death by expressing OCIF/Fas fusion proteins. Our results show that: (i) the N-terminal portion of OCIF containing domains 1–4, which have structural similarity to the extracellular domains of the TNFR family proteins, is sufficient to inhibit osteoclastogenesis; (ii) a heparin-binding site is located in domain 7, and affinity for heparin does not correlate with the inhibitory activity; (iii) Cys-400 in domain 7 is the residue responsible for dimer formation; and (iv) the C-terminal portion containing domains 5 and 6, DDHs, has a high potential for mediating a cytotoxic signal when it is expressed in cells as an OCIF/Fas fusion protein in which the transmembrane region of Fas is inserted in front of DDHs.

In the vertebrate, homeostasis and remodeling of bone are by strictly controlled by mostly unrevealed mechanisms. Much effort has been made to clarify the mechanisms, and several protein factors were found to participate in bone homeostasis (1Chambers T.J. Hall T.J. Vitam.

Recently, we have isolated one such factor termed osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor (OCIF) 1The abbreviations used are: OCIF, osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor; DDH, death domain homologous region; TRAP, tartaric-resistant acid phosphatase; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; IMDM, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s). from the conditioned medium of human embryonic lung fibroblasts, IMR-90 (4Tsuda E. Goto M. Mochizuki S.-i. Yano K. Kobayashi F. Morinaga T. Higashio K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 137-142Google Scholar). Both a ∼60-kDa monomer and a disulfide-linked homodimer are present in the conditioned medium, and the two forms have similar specific activity in inhibition of osteoclast formation in vitro (4Tsuda E. Goto M. Mochizuki S.-i. Yano K. Kobayashi F. Morinaga T. Higashio K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 137-142Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which OCIF inhibits osteoclastogenesis is not yet known. Based on the partial amino acid sequence, cDNA for human OCIF was molecularly cloned. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of OCIF cDNA predicted that it consists of 401 amino acid residues, including a putative 21-amino acid residue signal sequence (5Yasuda H. Shima N. Nakagawa N. Mochizuki S.-I. Yano K. Fujise N. Sato Y. Goto M. Yamaguchi K. Kuriyama M. Kanno T. Murakami A. Tsuda E. Morinaga T. Higashio K. Endocrinology. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence analysis has revealed that OCIF is identical to osteoprotegerin (6Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Kelley M. Chang M.-S. Lüthy R. Nguyen H.Q. Wooden S. Bennett L.

OCIF has seven major domains (domains 1–7) and has overall similarity to proteins of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family, although OCIF lacks an apparent transmembrane region (5Yasuda H.

Domains 5 and 6 share structural features with “death domains” of TNFR 1, Fas, DR 3 (also designated as Apo 3, Wsl 1, and TRAMP), the TRAIL receptor, and the several recently identified cytoplasmic proteins mediating apoptosis (5Yasuda H.

However, unlike previously characterized death domains, two death domain homologous regions (DDHs), domains 5 and 6 of OCIF, exist in extracellular environments, because OCIF is secreted into conditioned medium. Domain 7, which does not resemble any protein motifs characterized thus far, consists of 50 amino acid residues and has a relatively high net positive charge; it contains eight basic amino acid residues (Lys and Arg) and only one acidic residue (Glu). To determine which residue(s) or domain(s) is/are involved in the in vitro biological activity, binding to heparin, and dimer formation, we generated and characterized various mutants of OCIF. We also examined the potential of domains 5 and 6 for mediating cell death by overexpressing chimeric proteins in which portions containing the transmembrane domain derived from Fas were inserted into OCIF. Escherichia coli DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to propagate and amplify plasmids. 293-EBNA (CLONTECH), a human fetal kidney cell line, was grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 250 μg/ml geneticin (Sigma). A mouse bone marrow-derived stromal cell line, ST2 (Riken Cell Bank RCB0224, Japan) was grown in minimum essential medium-α containing 10% FBS. Mammalian expression plasmid pCEP4 (CLONTECH) was used for expression of OCIF mutants, Fas, and OCIF-Fas chimeric proteins. Full-length OCIF cDNA was subcloned into the XhoI and BamHI sites of pCEP4 to yield pCEP4-OCIF in which the cDNA is expressed under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Human Fas cDNA (18Itoh N. Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. Mizushima S.-I. Sameshima M. Hase A. Seto Y. Nagata S. Cell. 1991; 66: 233-243Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using Ex Taq polymerase (Takara Shuzo) and primers 5′-TCTTTCACTTCGGAGGATTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCTAGACCAAGCTTTGGATTTC-3′ (antisense). A human activated T cell cDNA library (CLONTECH) was used as a template for the PCR. Mutagenesis and genetic fusions were performed according to a method called “recombinant polymerase chain reaction” (19Higuchi R. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, New York1990: 177-183Google Scholar). To generate the expression vector for OCIF mutants, DNA fragments amplified by PCR were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes (DNA fragments for ΔD1, ΔD2, and ΔD3 byXhoI/NdeI; ΔD4 byXhoI/SphI; ΔD5, C195S, C202S and C277S byNdeI/SphI; ΔD6 and C319S byNdeI/BstEII; ΔCL and C400S bySphI/BstEII; ΔD7 bySphI/BamHI; and ΔD67 and ΔD567 byNdeI/BamHI) and were substituted for the corresponding region of OCIF cDNA in pCEP4-OCIF. The plasmids thus constructed were designated pCEP4-ΔD1, pCEP4-ΔD2, pCEP4-ΔD3, pCEP4-ΔD4, pCEP4-ΔD5, pCEP4-C195S, pCEP4-C202S, pCEP4-C277S, pCEP4-ΔD6, pCEP4-C319S, pCEP4-ΔCL, pCEP4-C400S pCEP4-ΔD7, pCEP4-ΔD67, and pCEP4-ΔD567, respectively. To construct a vector expressing OCIF-Fas, DNA fragment coding for domains 1–4 of OCIF (amplified using primers 5′-TGACAAATGTCCTCCTGGTA-3′ and 5′-AGATCTCGATCCATCTATTCCACATTTTTGAGTTG-3′) and that for the transmembrane domain through the intracellular region of Fas (amplified using primers 5′-TGTGGAATAGATGGATCGAGATCTAACTTGGGGTGGCTT-3′ and 5′-CCGGATCCTCTAGACCAAGCTTTGGATTTC-3′) were fused as described previously (19Higuchi R. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, New York1990: 177-183Google Scholar). The fused fragment was digested with NdeI and BamHI, and the resultant fragment was substituted for the NdeI/BamHI fragment of OCIF cDNA in pCEP4-OCIF to generate pCEP4-OCIF-Fas. To generate pCEP4-TM-OCIF, first, a DNA fragment encoding the transmembrane region of Fas was amplified by PCR with primers 5′-GGCTCGAGTCTTTCACTTCGGAGGATTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCTCCGGAACCTTGGTTTTCCTTTCTGTG-3′ (antisense), and the human activated T cell cDNA library as a template. Next, the amplified fragment was digested with BspEI, and the ∼700-bp fragment produced was ligated with the 0.4-kbBspEI/SphI fragment of OCIF cDNA. Then, the ligated DNA fragment was digested with BglII and SphI, and a ∼550-bp fragment was isolated. Finally, a ∼700-bp BglII/XhoI fragment from pCEP4-OCIF-Fas, the ∼550-bp fragment, and an ∼11-kbXhoI/SphI fragment from pCEP4-OCIF were ligated. To construct pCEP4-TM-OCIFΔD567, a DNA sequence encoding domains 5 to 7 was deleted from pCEP4-TM-OCIF by recombinant PCR (19Higuchi R. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, New York1990: 177-183Google Scholar). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For the production of ΔD1, ΔD2, ΔD3, ΔD4, ΔD5, ΔD6, ΔD7, ΔD67, ΔD567, ΔCL, C195S, C202S, C277S, C319S, and C400S, 293-EBNA cells were seeded on 24-well plates at a cell density of ∼2 × 105/well, and the cells in each well were transfected with 1 μg of the respective expression vector on the following day using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Five hours after transfection, the DNA precipitate was removed, and the cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 40 h. Cells transfected with pCEP4-ΔD567 were cultured in IMDM containing 10% FBS and 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Wako) to establish stable transformants. An ELISA employing rabbit anti-OCIF polyclonal antibody was used to quantify OCIF mutants in the conditioned medium. The polyclonal antibody was prepared as follows. OCIF produced in 293-EBNA harboring pCEP4-OCIF was purified to homogeneity as described previously (4Tsuda E. Goto M. Mochizuki S.-i. Yano K. Kobayashi F. Morinaga T. Higashio K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 137-142Google Scholar). JW rabbits were immunized with the purified OCIF. Anti-OCIF antibody was purified from serum of the rabbits using protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-OCIF antibody was prepared using a maleimide-activated peroxidase kit (Pierce). Osteoclastogenesis inhibitory activity was determined by observing the suppression of osteoclast-like cell formation. Osteoclast-like cell formation was evaluated by measuring tartaric acid-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity in co-culture of mouse spleen cells and ST2 cells after cultivating for 1 week in the presence of 10 nm 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and 100 nm dexamethasone concomitant with various concentrations of OCIF mutants as described previously (4Tsuda E. Goto M. Mochizuki S.-i. Yano K. Kobayashi F. Morinaga T. Higashio K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 137-142Google Scholar). TRAP activity is expressed in absorbance at 405 nm as described previously (4Tsuda E. Goto M. Mochizuki S.-i. Yano K. Kobayashi F. Morinaga T. Higashio K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 137-142Google Scholar). Mutant ΔD567 was purified from conditioned medium of a stable 293-EBNA transfectant using rabbit anti-OCIF polyclonal antibody-immobilized HiTrap NHS-activated column (Pharmacia). The conditioned medium (∼100 ml) was applied to the column at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. After washing the column with 21.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1m NaCl and 0.1% CHAPS (Sigma) and subsequently with 8 ml of 0.15 m NaCl containing 0.1% CHAPS, proteins were eluted from the column with 0.2 m acetic acid (pH 2.5) containing 0.15 m NaCl and 0.1% CHAPS at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions containing ΔD567 were determined by an ELISA employing anti-OCIF polyclonal antibody, collected, and applied to a HiTrap Blue (Pharmacia) column equilibrated with 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.1% CHAPS. After washing the column with the same buffer, proteins bound to the column were eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 2 m NaCl at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions containing ΔD567 (∼10 μg) were concentrated and desalted using Centricon 10 (Amicon). The affinity of wild-type OCIF and OCIF mutants for heparin was determined by FPLC on HiTrap heparin column (Pharmacia). Conditioned medium (∼1 ml) containing each OCIF mutant was applied to the column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) containing 0.1% CHAPS. The column was developed with a 40-min linear gradient of 0 to 1 m NaCl in equilibration buffer at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, and fractions (1.0 ml) were collected. The concentration of the mutant in each fraction was determined by ELISA employing rabbit anti-OCIF polyclonal antibody. Proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10 or 13%) electrophoresis. Rainbow-colored molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) were used as standards. Proteins were blotted onto ProBlott (Perkin-Elmer Corp.) using a semidry-type electroblotter (Bio-Rad). OCIF or OCIF mutants were detected using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated rabbit anti-OCIF polyclonal antibody, and the membrane was exposed to x-ray film using enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Corp.). Total RNA was isolated from cells 24 h posttransfection using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed with Super Script preamplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.) using 1 μg of the total RNA. Primers for the reverse transcriptase-PCR were 5′-ATGAACAACTTGCTGTGCTGCGCGCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAAACTGTATTTCGCTCTGG-3′ (antisense). The primers were designed to amplify a 424-bp fragment corresponding to the putative signal peptide and domains 1–3 of OCIF. Size of the amplified products was determined by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. 293-EBNA cells were inoculated into each well in a 96-well plate at a cell density of ∼2 × 104cells/200 μl/well. The cells in each well were transfected on the following day with 250 ng of empty vector, pCEP4-Fas, pCEP4-OCIF-Fas, pCEP4-TM-OCIF, or pCEP4-TM-OCIFΔD567 using LipofectAMINE. Twenty hours after transfection, cells were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde (Wako) for 10 min at room temperature. After washing the cells twice with 200 μl of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), HRP-conjugated anti-OCIF polyclonal antibody was added to the wells, and the plate was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washing the cells five times with 200 μl of PBS, 100 μl of substrate solution (0.4 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) and 0.006% H2O2 in 0.1 m citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 4.5) was added to the cells, and the incubation was continued for additional 3 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of 6 nH2SO4 to each well, and the absorbance at 490 nm was measured. 293-EBNA cells were inoculated into each well in a 24-well plate at a cell density of ∼5 × 104 cells/2 ml/well. The cells in each well were transfected on the following day with 1 μg of empty vector, pCEP4-Fas, pCEP4-OCIF-Fas, pCEP4-TM-OCIF, or pCEP4-TM-OCIFΔD567, together with 0.2 μg of pCH110, an expression plasmid for β-galactosidase (Pharmacia), using LipofectAMINE. Five hours after transfection, the DNA precipitate was removed, and IMDM containing 10% FBS (500 μl/well) was added to each well. After 15 h of cultivation, cells were fixed by treating with 1% glutaraldehyde for 5 min at room temperature, washed twice with 1 ml of PBS, and stained with X-gal (Wako). Cell morphology was examined under a phase-contrast microscope, and the percentage of round-shaped blue cellsversus total blue cells was calculated. For the assay of lactate dehydrogenase activity in the medium, aliquots of conditioned medium were removed before fixing the cells. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was measured using a colorimetric kit (Shino-test, Tokyo, Japan). DNA fragmentation assay was performed as described previously (20Hertmann M. Lorenz H.-M. Voll R. Grunke M. Woith W. Kaldin J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5506-5507Google Scholar) using cells cultivated for 20 h after transfection. A schematic representation of OCIF and mutants of OCIF used in this work is shown in Fig. 1. We constructed a series of expression vectors and transfected them into 293-EBNA cells to produce deletion mutants, ΔD1, ΔD2, ΔD3, ΔD4, ΔD5, ΔD6, and ΔD7. We also constructed expression vector for C-terminal truncation mutants, ΔD67 and ΔD567. Furthermore, to identify a residue responsible for dimer formation of OCIF, a series of Cys to Ser mutants, C195S, C202S, C277S, C319S, and C400S, in which each Cys residue in domains 5, 6, and 7 was replaced with Ser, and a deletion mutant, ΔCL, which lacks two C-terminal amino acid residues, Cys-400 and Leu-401, were prepared. All but two mutants (ΔD1 and ΔD2) were detected in the conditioned medium by Western blot analysis (see below) employing anti-OCIF polyclonal antibody. OCIF mutants were quantified by ELISA using anti-OCIF polyclonal antibody. ΔD1 and ΔD2 were not secreted at levels detectable by Western blotting or ELISA. The concentration of most of the mutants in their conditioned media ranged from 200 ng/ml to 2 μg/ml. Accurate determination of inhibitory activity of ΔD6 was impossible due to poor productivity (∼50 ng/ml). Fig. 2 A shows the osteoclastogenesis inhibitory activity of the deletion mutants measured based on the inhibition of TRAP-positive osteoclast-like cell formation in the cocultures. Although wild-type OCIF inhibited the osteoclast-like cell formation in a dose range of 5 to 40 ng/ml (half-maximal inhibitory dose (ID50) of ∼6 ng/ml), ΔD3 and ΔD4 failed to inhibit the osteoclast-like cell formation at concentrations 35 and 40 ng/ml, respectively. In contrast, ΔD5 retained the inhibitory activity with an ID50 of ∼15 ng/ml. Furthermore, ΔD7 had a specific activity comparable to that of wild-type OCIF. A C-terminal truncation mutant ΔD67, which lacks domains 6 and 7, possessed the osteoclastogenesis inhibitory activity, although potency in the inhibitory activity was considerably lower than that of wild-type OCIF (an ID50 of 10 ng/ml) (Fig. 2 A). For the accurate determination of the inhibitory activity of ΔD567, which lacks DDHs entirely, we purified it using an anti-OCIF-antibody-immobilized affinity column. The purified ΔD567 inhibited osteoclastogenesis (Fig. 2 B), indicating that truncation of domains 5–7 (consisting of the C-terminal 204 residues) does not abolish the biological activity. However, the potency of ΔD567 was approximately 10% of that of wild-type OCIF (Fig. 2 B) as estimated from their ID50. These results indicate that the N-terminal portion containing the first four domains is sufficient for exerting the osteoclastogenesis inhibitory activityin vitro. To examine the significance of the binding of OCIF to heparin in the inhibition of osteoclastogenesis, we analyzed the affinity of ΔD7, ΔD67, and ΔD567 for heparin by FPLC on HiTrap heparin column. Conditioned medium of the cells transiently expressing each OCIF mutant was loaded on the column and each mutant was eluted from the column with NaCl-containing buffer. Wild-type OCIF was eluted at NaCl concentrations of 0.55 m and 0.74 m, which correspond to those at which the monomer and the dimer form of OCIF are eluted, respectively (Fig. 3). ΔD7 was eluted as a single peak at an NaCl concentration of 0.24m. Further truncation had only marginal effects on the binding of OCIF to heparin (Fig. 3). These three mutant proteins were eluted as single peaks, probably because they are present as monomers (see below). These results strongly suggest that domain 7, which occupies the C-terminal 50 amino acid residues, contains a heparin-binding site. The fact that deletion of domain 7 did not affect the inhibition of osteoclastogenesis (Fig. 2 A) but significantly decreased the binding of OCIF to heparin (Fig. 3) indicates that binding ability of OCIF to heparin does not correlate with its osteoclastogenesis inhibitory activity in vitro. OCIF from IMR-90-conditioned medium is present as two forms, a monomer with an approximate molecular mass of 60 kDa and a disulfide-linked dimer with an approximate mass of 120 kDa (4Tsuda E. Goto M. Mochizuki S.-i. Yano K. Kobayashi F. Morinaga T. Higashio K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 137-142Google Scholar). To identify (a) domain(s) responsible for the dimer formation, the capability of the domain deletion mutants to form dimers was analyzed using immunoblotting as shown in Fig. 4 A. A protein with a mass of 80–100 kDa was detected for ΔD3, ΔD4, ΔD5, and ΔD6 as a major band. In contrast, ΔD7 is present almost exclusively as a ∼55-kDa protein. Thus, ΔD7 is present mainly as a monomer, while ΔD3, ΔD4, ΔD5, and ΔD6 are present in two forms, a monomer and a dimer (or a multimer) in the conditioned medium, suggesting that domain 7 is involved in the dimer formation. ΔD67 and ΔD567, both lacking domain 7, migrated as monomers as expected (Fig. 4 A). Difference in size between ΔD3 and ΔD4 (Fig. 4 A) is probably due to a different degree of glycosylation. Indeed, there are three potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) in domain 3, whereas there is no such site in domain 4 (5Yasuda H. Shima N. Nakagawa N. Mochizuki S.-I. Yano K. Fujise N.

Pattison W. Campbell P. Sander S. Van G. Tarpley J. Derby P. Lee R. Boyle W.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 309-319Google Scholar). Since there is only one Cys residue (Cys-400) in domain 7 (5Yasuda H. Shima N. Nakagawa N. Mochizuki S.-I. Yano K. Fujise N. Sato Y. Goto M. Yamaguchi K. Kuriyama M. Kanno T. Murakami A. Tsuda E. Morinaga T. Higashio K.

Cell. 1997; 89: 309-319Google Scholar), participation of the residue in the intermolecular disulfide-linkage was suspected. To confirm this, two mutants, one with substitution of a Ser residue for Cys-400 (C400S) and the other with a deletion of the two C-terminal amino acid residues Cys-400 and Leu-401 (ΔCL) were produced. As a control, a series of Cys to Ser mutants, C195S, C202S, C277S, and C319S, in which each Cys residue in domains 5 and 6 was replaced with a Ser residue, were generated. The mutants were transiently expressed in 293-EBNA cells, and the structure of the mutants was analyzed by Western blotting as shown in Fig. 4 B. The results indicate that both C400S and ΔCL exist almost exclusively as a monomer with a mass of ∼60 kDa (Fig. 4 B). No monomer-form OCIF with a mass of ∼60 kDa was detected in the conditioned medium of C195S, C202S, C277S, or C319S (Fig. 4 B). These four mutants migrated even slower than the dimer form OCIF with a mass of ∼120 kDa. The slower migrating bands may represent higher order multimers derived from unusual disulfide bonding. These results demonstrate that Cys-400 is responsible for the dimer formation of OCIF. Thus, we conclude that the 120-kDa protein detected in the conditioned medium of OCIF-producing cells is a homodimer consisting of two 60-kDa monomers linked together by an intermolecular disulfide bond between two Cys-400 residues. C400S and ΔCL, which are present almost exclusively as a monomer in the conditioned medium, were as potent as wild-type OCIF in the inhibition of the in vitro osteoclast formation (Fig. 5). These results provide further evidence that formation of the dimer is not essential for exerting the in vitro osteoclastogenesis inhibitory activity. C195S, C202S, C277S, and C319S, which are present mainly as multimers as shown in Fig. 4 B, maintained the biological activity (data not shown). We next asked whether domains 5 and 6 (DDHs) have a potential for mediating cytotoxic signals. For this purpose, we transfected plasmids encoding various OCIF/Fas fusion proteins together with pCH110, an expression plasmid for β-galactosidase, in 293-EBNA cells. The structure of OCIF, Fas, and their fusion proteins used in this experiment is schematically illustrated in Fig. 6 A. The presence of mRNA derived from each chimeric construct in the transfected cells was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Primers were designed to amplify a 424-bp fragment corresponding to the 5′ portion of OCIF mRNA. As shown in Fig. 6 B, reverse transcriptase-PCR using RNA from the cells transfected with pCEP4-OCIF-Fas, pCEP4-TM-OCIF, or pCEP4-TM-OCIFΔD567 generated the 424-bp fragment, but not with pCEP4 or pCEP4-Fas. HRP-labeled anti-OCIF polyclonal antibody specifically bound to the cells transfected with pCEP4-OCIF-Fas, pCEP4-TM-OCIF, or pCEP4-TM-OCIFΔD567, but not with the empty vector or pCEP4-Fas (Fig. 6 C). These results indicate that each chimeric cDNA was efficiently expressed, and the fusion products were translocated to the surface of the transfected cells. These cells were then stained with X-gal to examine the size and the shape of the cells harboring each expression plasmid. Microscopic examination of the cells transfected with pCEP4-Fas, pCEP4-OCIF-Fas, or pCEP4-TM-OCIF revealed that 30–60% of the blue cells were round and shrunken, showing signs of cell death (Fig. 7 A). In contrast, when transfected with the empty vector, pCEP4-OCIF or pCEP4-TM-OCIFΔD567, more than 90% of the blue cells retained the flat and adherent appearance (Fig. 7 A). Lactate dehydrogenase activity in the conditioned medium of the cells transfected with pCEP4-OCIF-Fas or pCEP4-TM-OCIF was significantly higher than that transfected with the empty vector or pCEP4-TM-OCIFΔD567 (Fig. 7 B), showing that overexpression of OCIF-Fas or TM-OCIF induced cell death. The transfection efficiency was almost the same (approximately 40%) in all transfection experiments. Cytotoxic signal induced by OCIF-Fas was apparently stronger than that induced by Fas for a currently unknown reason. To examine whether the cell death was caused by apoptosis, we next analyzed the integrity of DNA in the cells transfected with the empty vector, pCEP4-OCIF-Fas or pCEP4-TM-OCIF. Cells transfected with pCEP4-OCIF-Fas or pCEP4-TM-OCIF showed severe fragmentation of DNA, a clear symptom of"
https://openalex.org/W2083267551,"We have recently demonstrated that neutrophils oxidize nearly all of the amino acids commonly found in plasma to a corresponding family of aldehydes in high yield. The reaction is mediated by hypochlorous acid (HOCl), the major oxidant generated by the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl−system of phagocytes. We now present evidence for the underlying mechanism of this reaction, including the structural requirements and reaction intermediates formed. Utilizing mass spectrometry and isotopically labeled amino acids, we rule out hydrogen atom abstraction from the α-carbon as the initial event in aldehyde formation during amino acid oxidation, a pathway known to occur with ionizing radiation. Aldehyde generation from amino acids required the presence of an α-amino moiety; β- and e-amino acids did not form aldehydes upon oxidation by either the myeloperoxidase system or HOCl, generating stable monochloramines instead. UV difference spectroscopy, high pressure liquid chromatography, and multinuclear (1H,15N) NMR spectroscopy established that the conversion of α-amino acids into aldehydes begins with generation of an unstable α-monochloramine, which subsequently decomposes to yield an aldehyde. Precursor product relationships between α-amino acid and α-monochloramine, and α-monochloramine and aldehyde were confirmed by high pressure liquid chromatography purification of the reaction intermediate and subsequent 1H and 15N NMR spectroscopy. Collectively, these results detail the chemical mechanism and reaction intermediates generated during conversion of amino acids into aldehydes by myeloperoxidase-generated HOCl."
https://openalex.org/W2060427624,"In this study we have quantitatively assessed the basal turnover of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) and M3-muscarinic receptor-mediated changes in phosphoinositides in the human neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y. We demonstrate that the polyphosphoinositides represent a minor fraction of the total cellular phosphoinositide pool and that in addition to rapid, sustained increases in [3H]inositol phosphates dependent upon the extent of receptor activation by carbachol, there are equally rapid and sustained reductions in the levels of polyphosphoinositides. Compared with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P), PtdIns(4,5)P2 was reduced with less potency by carbachol and recovered faster following agonist removal suggesting protection of PtdIns(4,5)P2 at the expense of PtdIns(4)P and indicating specific regulatory mechanism(s). This does not involve a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein regulation of PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase. Using wortmannin to inhibit PtdIns 4-kinase activity, we demonstrate that the immediate consequence of blocking the supply of PtdIns(4)P (and therefore PtdIns(4,5)P2) is a failure of agonist-mediated phosphoinositide and Ca2+ signaling. The use of wortmannin also indicated that PtdIns is not a substrate for receptor-activated phospholipase C and that 15% of the basal level of PtdIns(4,5)P2 is in an agonist-insensitive pool. We estimate that the agonist-sensitive pool of PtdIns(4,5)P2turns over every 5 s (0.23 fmol/cell/min) during sustained receptor activation by a maximally effective concentration of carbachol. Immediately following agonist addition, PtdIns(4,5)P2 is consumed >3 times faster (0.76 fmol/cell/min) than during sustained receptor activation which represents, therefore, utilization by a partially desensitized receptor. These data indicate that resynthesis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 is required to allow full early and sustained phases of receptor signaling. Despite the critical dependence of phosphoinositide and Ca2+ signaling on PtdIns(4,5)P2 resynthesis, we find no evidence that this rate resynthesis is limiting for agonist-mediated responses.

Rhee S.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 183-189Google Scholar). Thus, PtdIns(4,5)P2 is a substrate for both phospholipase C (PLC) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) activities. The importance of the signaling pathway initiated by PI3-K and resulting in the generation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) is rapidly emerging (2Stephens L.R. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 27-75Google Scholar, 3Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 153-158Google Scholar). However, all estimates so far suggest that the PI3-K pathway utilizes only a small fraction of the PtdIns(4,5)P2 pool compared with that hydrolyzed by PLC in a signaling cascade (4Jackson T.R. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16627-16636Google Scholar, 5Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 347-351Google Scholar). The latter enzyme liberates both inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) and 1,2-diacylglycerol, which mobilize Ca2+ from intracellular stores and activate several isoforms of protein kinase C, respectively (6Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Google Scholar). Both Ins(1,4,5)P3 and diacylglycerol are recycled to provide the substrates (myo-inositol and CMP-phosphatidate) necessary for phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) resynthesis. PtdIns(4,5)P2 can then be regenerated by the sequential phosphorylation of PtdIns and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P) by phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PtdIns 4-kinase) and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase), respectively (6Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Google Scholar). This resynthesis is vital in maintaining an agonist-sensitive PtdIns(4,5)P2pool, as the cellular content of PtdIns(4,5)P2 is small in comparison to the rate at which it may be consumed during receptor-mediated activation of PLC (7Downes C.P. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. Michell R.H. Drummond A.H. Downes C.P. Inositol Lipids and Cell Signalling. Academic Press, London1989: 3-39Google Scholar). Although it is possible that changes in substrate/product concentrations, particularly the dramatic changes that might occur in the immediate vicinity of activated PLC, may play a role in regulating PtdIns(4,5)P2 supply, the pathway is likely to possess more sophisticated regulatory features that enable supply to be matched to demand under agonist-stimulated conditions. In this context a number of potential regulatory mechanisms for PtdIns 4-kinase and/or PtdIns(4)P 5-kinase activities have been proposed (8Conway B.R. Withiam-Leitch M. Rubin R.P. Mol.

Acta. 1993; 1179: 27-75Google Scholar). Furthermore, although the resupply of PtdIns(4,5)P2 must occur to allow sustained or repetitive phosphoinositide signaling, there is little information to indicate the extent to which its resynthesis contributes to regulatory aspects of signaling mediated by PLC-coupled receptors. It is unclear, for example, whether resynthesis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 is required during acute agonist-mediated responses and indeed whether depletion of this substrate can contribute to the rapid receptor desensitization that is an almost universal feature of receptors activating this signal transduction pathway (16Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 279-285Google Scholar, 17Fisher S.K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 288: 231-250Google Scholar). Cells of the human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line have many features characteristic of fetal sympathetic ganglion cells and have been used extensively in studies from signal transduction to neurotransmitter release (18Vaughan P.F.T. Peers C. Walker J.H. Gen. Pharmacol. 1995; 26: 1191-1201Google Scholar, 19Lambert D.G. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 555-562Google Scholar, 20Willars G.B. Nahorski S.R. Br. J.

Neurochem. 1994; 63: 177-185Google Scholar). Our laboratory has used this neuroblastoma extensively to examine mechanistic and regulatory aspects of muscarinic receptor-mediated phosphoinositide and Ca2+ signaling (19Lambert D.G. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 555-562Google Scholar, 20Willars G.B. Nahorski S.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 1133-1142Google Scholar, 21Willars G.B. Nahorski S.R. Mol.

Nahorski S.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 279-285Google Scholar, 17Fisher S.K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 288: 231-250Google Scholar). In the current study we have, therefore, used SH-SY5Y cells to examine quantitatively the regulation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis and resynthesis during stimulation of their muscarinic acetylcholine receptors which are predominantly of the M3 subtype (23Lambert D.G. Ghataorre A.S. Nahorski S.R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 165: 71-77Google Scholar). In addition we have sought to assess the impact of reduced PtdIns(4,5)P2 supply on transmembrane signaling via PLC and to determine whether agonist-mediated depletion of PtdIns(4,5)P2 contributes to the rapid desensitization of muscarinic receptor-mediated phosphoinositide signaling. Experiments were performed on SH-SY5Y cells (originally a gift from Dr. J. Biedler, Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York) between passages 70 and 90. Cells were maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 50 IU ml−1 penicillin, 50 μg ml−1 streptomycin, 2.5 μg ml−1amphotericin B, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 10% (v/v) newborn calf serum. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2/humidified air and passaged weekly. For experiments, cells were harvested with 10 mm HEPES, 154 mmNaCl, 0.54 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) and where required reseeded at an approximately equivalent density into 24-well multidishes. Cells were always maintained and the experimental manipulations performed at 37 °C. For the determination of 3H-labeled inositol mono- and poly-phosphates ([3H]InsPx), cells were prelabeled with 3 μCi ml−1 myo-[3H]inositol (86 Ci mmol−1) for 48 h in 24-well multidishes. Media were then removed, and the cell monolayers were washed and incubated for 30 min in 1 ml of Krebs/HEPES (pH 7.4, composition (mm): HEPES 10, NaHCO3 4.2, glucose 11.7, MgSO4 1.2, KH2PO4 1.2, KCl 4.7, NaCl 118, and CaC12 1.3) with 10 mm inositol. Buffer was then aspirated, and the cells were challenged with 200 μl of buffer (± agonist). Where carbachol was removed to examine recovery, the agonist-containing buffer was aspirated, each well washed (2 × 1 ml Krebs/HEPES), and the incubation continued in the presence of 200 μl of buffer. In antagonist reversal experiments, agonist incubation was in 100 μl followed by addition of 100 μl of atropine (final concentration, 10 μm). Reactions were terminated with an equal volume of ice-cold 1 m trichloroacetic acid. After 15 min on ice the aqueous phase was removed and 100 μl of 10 mm EDTA added. After vortexing with 0.5 ml of a 1:1 (v/v) freshly prepared mixture of tri-n-octylamine and 1,1,2-trichloro-trifluoroethane, 20 μl of 250 mmNaHCO3 was added to a 300-μl aliquot of the aqueous phase. This was applied to a Dowex (AG1-X8) formate column which was then washed with 20 ml of water and 10 ml of 25 mm ammonium formate. [3H]InsPx were eluted with 10 ml of 1m ammonium formate, 0.1 m formic acid and quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Glycerophosphoinositol ([3H]GroPIns) and the glycerophosphoinositol phosphates ([3H]GroPIns(4)P and [3H]GroPIns(4,5)P2) as indices of PtdIns, PtdIns(4)P, and PtdIns(4,5)P2, respectively, were prepared from cell monolayers based upon previously described methods (24Jenkinson S. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1138-1148Google Scholar). After removal of the acidified aqueous phase for the determination of [3H]InsPx as described above, lipids were extracted into 0.94 ml of acidified chloroform/methanol (40:80:1 v/v, 10 m HCl). Chloroform (0.31 ml) and 0.1 m HCl (0.56 ml) were then added to induce phase partition. A sample of the lower phase (400 μl) was removed, dried in a stream of N2, and stored at −20 °C prior to further processing. These samples were dissolved in 1 ml of chloroform and 0.2 ml of methanol and hydrolyzed by addition of 0.4 ml of 0.5 m NaOH in methanol/water (19:1, v/v). Samples were vortex mixed at regular intervals during a 20-min incubation at room temperature. Chloroform (1 ml), methanol (0.6 ml), and water (0.6 ml) were then added, and the samples were mixed and centrifuged (3,000 × g, 10 min). A 1-ml aliquot of the upper phase was neutralized using 1-ml bed volume Dowex-50 (H+ form) columns that were washed with 2 × 2 ml of water. The pooled eluate was brought to pH 7 by addition of NaHCO3 and applied to a Dowex (AG1-X8) formate anion exchange column. The [3H]GroPIns, [3H]GroPIns(4)P, and [3H]GroPIns(4,5)P2 were then eluted as described elsewhere (24Jenkinson S. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1138-1148Google Scholar) and quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. PtdIns(4,5)P2 mass was determined by assay of Ins(1,4,5)P3 released by alkaline hydrolysis following a previously described protocol (25Chilvers E.R. Batty I.H. Challiss R.A.J. Barnes P.J. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 373-379Google Scholar). Briefly, dried lipid extracts, prepared as described above from cells not labeled with [3H]inositol, were dissolved in 0.25 ml of 1m KOH and heated to 100 °C for 15 min during which time they were vortex mixed at regular intervals. Tubes were then placed on ice for 15 min and then samples added to 0.5-ml bed volume Dowex-50 (H+ form) columns. Columns were washed (3 × 0.25 ml) with water. NaHCO3 (100 μl, 60 mm) and EDTA (100 μl, 30 mm) were then added to the pooled column eluates that were stored at 4 °C. The Ins(1,4,5)P3 which had been released from the PtdIns(4,5)P2 was assayed as described below within 48 h. Recoveries from each processing step were assessed (25Chilvers E.R. Batty I.H. Challiss R.A.J. Barnes P.J. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 373-379Google Scholar) to allow levels of Ins(1,4,5)P3determined to be extrapolated to the amount of PtdIns(4,5)P2. Cell monolayers were preincubated in Krebs/HEPES, challenged, and the reaction terminated as described above. Experiments examining recovery following termination of carbachol action by addition of atropine were performed as described above. A series of experiments were also designed to examine the potential desensitization and resensitization of the peak (10 s) Ins(1,4,5)P3 response. Cells were treated as described above for experiments examining the recovery of inositol phosphates and phosphoinositides. However, following aspiration of the initial carbachol challenge and washing of the monolayer (2 × with 1 ml Krebs/HEPES), incubation was continued for the required recovery time in 1 ml of buffer before aspiration and rechallenge with carbachol (200 μl) for 10 s. Reactions were again stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 1 mtrichloroacetic acid. A 160-μl aliquot of the acidified aqueous phase was removed, processed, and assayed for Ins(1,4,5)P3 by a radioreceptor assay (26Challiss R.A.J. Chilvers E.R. Willcocks A.L. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 421-427Google Scholar). The intracellular [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]i) was determined in suspensions of fura-2-loaded cells. Briefly, confluent cells were harvested, washed with Krebs/HEPES, and resuspended in 2.5 ml of the same buffer. A 0.5-ml aliquot was removed and manipulated as below but with the exclusion of the acetoxymethyl ester of fura-2 (fura-2-AM) thereby allowing the determination of cellular autofluorescence. Fura-2-AM was added to the remaining cells at 5 μm and the cells left with gentle stirring for 40–60 min at room temperature. Supernatant containing extracellular fura-2-AM was removed following gentle centrifugation of 0.5-ml aliquots. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min prior to further centrifugation and resuspension in 3 ml of buffer at 37 °C. With emission at 509 nm, the 340/380 nm excitation ratio was recorded every 3.8 s as an index of [Ca2+]i. Cells were challenged by the addition of 50 μl of carbachol to give a final concentration of 1 mm. The 340:380 ratio was converted to [Ca2+]i as reported previously (27Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar) using 0.1% Triton X-100 in the presence of 1.3 mmCa2+ to determine Rmax followed by the addition of 6.7 mm EGTA to determineRmin. The effects of Li+ on muscarinic receptor-mediated phosphoinositide signaling was determined as described above with the exception that the preincubation and incubation buffers were inositol-free and contained 10 mmLi+. Although wortmannin is better known for its ability to inhibit PI3-K (28Okada T. Sakuma L. Fukui Y. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3563-3567Google Scholar), this fungal metabolite has recently been demonstrated to inhibit some isoforms of PtdIns 4-kinase (29Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Google Scholar, 30Downing G.J. Kim S. Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3587-3594Google Scholar). We have, therefore, used wortmannin in an alternative strategy to Li+ to examine the immediate consequences of blocking the provision of PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2 under basal and agonist-stimulated conditions. For experiments in which cells were pretreated with wortmannin, this was added during the final 10 min of incubation and incorporated with agonist additions. In experiments investigating the time course of the effects of wortmannin on inositol phosphates and phosphoinositides, wortmannin was added in a 10-μl volume. Reagents of analytical grade were obtained from suppliers listed previously (20Willars G.B. Nahorski S.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 1133-1142Google Scholar, 21Willars G.B. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 509-516Google Scholar, 24Jenkinson S. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1138-1148Google Scholar).myo-[3H]Inositol was from Amersham Corp. (Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK) [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 was from NEN Life Science Products (Stevenage, UK). Wortmannin was obtained from Sigma (Poole, UK). 2-(4-Morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (LY-294002) was obtained from Affiniti Research Products Ltd. (Exeter, UK). For quantitative determinations, cell incubations were carried out in duplicate. Duplicate values for [3H]InsPx and Ins(1,4,5)P3 were averaged to give a single value representative of one experiment, whereas for [3H]phosphoinositides and PtdIns(4,5)P2 mass, duplicates were pooled at the lipid extraction stage. All data are presented as mean ± S.E. with the number of experiments given in parentheses. Concentration-response curves were fitted by GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) using a standard four-parameter logistic equation. EC50 and IC50values are presented as log10 M. Statistical comparisons were by Student's two-tailed paired or unpaired t test or, where multiple comparisons were required, by one-way analysis of variance followed by Duncan's multiple range test at p< 0.05 and p < 0.01. Incubation of SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells with [3H]inositol resulted in marked changes in the absolute and relative amounts of radioactivity incorporated into the phosphoinositides over the first 20 h (data not shown). However, there were little or no differences between cells labeled for either 44 or 48 h under basal or agonist-stimulated (1 mmcarbachol, 5 min) conditions (data not shown), and the phosphoinositide pools were judged to be in equilibrium. In all subsequent experiments, cells were therefore labeled for 48 h and under these conditions [3H]PtdIns comprised the major fraction (94.3 ± 0.3% (n = 4)) of the inositol phospholipid pool, whereas [3H]PtdIns(4)P and [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 represented only minor fractions (2.5 ± 0.1% (n = 4) and 3.2 ± 0.2% (n = 4) respectively). Upon addition of a concentration of carbachol that is maximal for the muscarinic receptor-mediated phosphoinositide-linked responses in these cells (1 mm), there was a rapid and marked accumulation of [3H]InsPx (Fig. 1 a). We emphasize that this accumulation of [3H]InsPx is in the absence of a Li+ block of inositol monophosphatase activity. Accumulation therefore represents the net result of both generation and metabolism to free inositol. Over the first 60 s of stimulation with carbachol there was an increase in [3H]InsPxto 291 ± 23% (n = 4) of basal levels that was sustained throughout the remaining period of agonist stimulation. In the same cell monolayers, there were rapid and marked decreases in the levels of [3H]PtdIns(4)P and [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 upon agonist challenge to 32.4 ± 2.9% (n = 4) and 24.7 ± 2.8% (n = 4) of basal levels, respectively, by 60 s (Fig. 1 b). These reductions were again sustained throughout the period of agonist challenge. In contrast, the level of [3H]PtdIns decreased to only 85.8 ± 4.2% (n = 4) of basal levels over the experimental period (900 s) (Fig. 1 b). Given this relatively small reduction of [3H]PtdIns, it is unlikely that the specific activities of the 3H-polyphosphoinositides change greatly during this period of stimulation, and therefore the changes in radioactivity are likely to accurately reflect the changes in mass. The ability of carbachol to mediate the accumulation of [3H]InsPx and depletion of the phosphoinositides was concentration-related (Fig. 2). EC50 values (log10 M, determined at 60 s following agonist addition) were −5.43 ± 0.17 (n= 5) (3.7 μm) for [3H]InsPxaccumulation, −5.82 ± 0.15 (n = 5) (1.5 μm) for the depletion of [3H]PtdIns(4)P, and −5.25 ± 0.11 (n = 5) (5.6 μm) for the depletion of [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2. The 3.7-fold difference between EC50 values for agonist-stimulated changes in polyphosphoinositide levels was statistically significant (p < 0.02), indicating that carbachol was more potent at depleting [3H]PtdIns(4)P than [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2. The relatively minor reductions in [3H]PtdIns, particularly at lower concentrations of carbachol, precluded an accurate assessment of agonist potency for this response. The kinetics of recovery from carbachol-induced alterations of [3H]InsPx, [3H]PtdIns(4)P, and [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 were determined upon agonist washout following 1 min exposure to a maximal concentration of the agonist (Fig. 3). These data indicated clear differences in the rates of resynthesis of the polyphosphoinositides. Thus, recovery of [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 occurred with no apparent lag following removal of carbachol, whereas there was a delay of some 30 s before any significant recovery of [3H]PtdIns(4)P (Fig. 3, a and b). The rate of recovery of [3H]PtdIns(4)P was significantly (p = 0.009) slower compared with that of [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 (t½ values of 130 ± 22 s (n = 5) and 25.9 ± 3.9 s (n = 5), respectively, by one phase exponential fit). Levels of [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2recovered to within 10% of basal levels in <200 s following carbachol washout, whereas [3H]PtdIns(4)P took approximately 10 min for full recovery to occur. [3H]InsPx returned to basal levels with a t½ of 76.8 ± 17.0 s (n = 5) (Fig. 3 a, inset). Reversal of carbachol-mediated changes occurring after washing the cells indicated a dependence of the sustained alterations on persistent muscarinic receptor occupation. This was confirmed by the ability of the muscarinic antagonist, atropine, to reverse these changes. Addition of 10 μm atropine, 1 min following addition of a maximally effective concentration of carbachol (1 mm) reduced [3H]InsPx accumulation from 378 ± 20% (n = 4) to 229 ± 11% (n = 4) of basal over a 100-s period. During this time [3H]PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels were restored from 23.6 ± 2.4% (n = 4) to 81.8 ± 4.1% (n = 4) of basal. However, the rate and extent of recovery of [3H]PtdIns(4)P was less, returning from 25.7 ± 4.4% (n = 4) to 49.5 ± 5.4% (n = 4) of basal over the same period. The addition of atropine during challenge with carbachol had no effect upon the small agonist-induced reduction of [3H]PtdIns (data not shown). That changes in [3H]inositol-labeled phospholipids reflect changes in mass levels was further indicated by the measurement of PtdIns(4,5)P2 mass during carbachol stimulation and following addition of atropine. Thus, challenge with carbachol for 60 s resulted in an approximately 80% reduction in the mass of PtdIns(4,5)P2 which was approximately restored within 100 s of atropine addition (Table I). These experiments also allowed the measurement of Ins(1,4,5)P3 mass from the same cells. This demonstrated the characteristic “peak and plateau” response characteristic of muscarinic receptor activation in these cells (19Lambert D.G. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 1990; 265: 555-562Google Scholar, 20Willars G.B. Nahorski S.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 1133-1142Google Scholar, 21Willars G.B. Nahorski S.R. Mol.

Pretreatment of cells for 24 h with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin had no effect on either the extent of depletion or the rate and extent of recovery of the [3H]inositol-labeled inositol phosphates or phosphoinositides following 5 min exposure to 1 mm carbachol (Fig. 4 and data not shown). Incubation of cells with carbachol in the presence of 10 mm Li+ resulted in an accumulation of [3H]InsPx that was rapid over the 1st min of stimulation (increase of 90% of the basal value which was 13,877 ± 1495 (n = 4) dpm/well). Following this there was a slower but sustained accumulation over a further 19 min of carbachol stimulation (increase of 50% of basal/min). The sustained linear increase between 1 and 20 min of stimulation demonstrate an effective block of inositol monophosphatase activity that will prevent the recycling of inositol back into the phospholipids. Despite this the carbachol-mediated depletion of the phospholipids was identical in the presence and absence of Li+ (data not shown). We were, therefore, unable to use Li+ to manipulate cellular levels of the phosphoinositides, and an alternative strategy using inhibitors of PtdIns 4-kinase (wortmannin and LY-294002) was employed. Addition of 10 μm wortmannin to unstimulated cells produced a decrease in [3H]InsPx over a 10-min"
https://openalex.org/W2058511448,"Inhibitor titrations using antimycin have been used to study the pool behavior of ubiquinone and cytochromec in the respiratory chain of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. If present in a homogeneous pool, these carriers should be able to diffuse freely through or along the membrane respectively and accept and subsequently donate electrons to an infinite number of the respective respiratory complex. However, we show that under physiological conditions neither ubiquinone nor cytochromec exhibits pool behavior, implying that the respiratory chain in yeast is one functional unit. Pool behavior can be introduced for both small carriers by adding chaotropic agents to the reaction medium. We conclude that these agents disrupt the interaction between the respiratory complexes, thereby causing them to become randomly arranged in the membrane. In such a situation, ubiquinone and cytochrome c become mobile carriers, shuttling between the large respiratory complexes. Furthermore, we conclude from the respiratory activities found for different substrates that the respiratory units in yeast vary in composition with respect to the ubiquinone reducing enzyme. All units contain the cytochrome chain, supplemented with either succinate dehydrogenase or the internal or the external NADH dehydrogenase. This implies that when only one substrate is available, only a certain fraction of the cytochrome chain is used in respiration. The molecular organization of the respiratory chain in yeast is compared with that of higher eukaryotes and to the electron transfer systems of photosynthetic membranes. Differences between the organization of the respiratory chain of yeast and that of higher eukaryotes are discussed in terms of the ability of yeast to radically alter its metabolism in response to change of the available carbon source.

Differences between the organization of the respiratory chain of yeast and that of higher eukaryotes are discussed in terms of the ability of yeast to radically alter its metabolism in response to change of the available carbon source. The mitochondrial respiratory chain consists of large multisubunit enzymes that are embedded in the inner membrane. These complexes are electronically connected by smaller components, ubiquinone and cytochrome c. Numerous studies have been performed to elucidate the molecular organization of the respiratory chain, and two extreme models have been considered (1Rich P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 53-79Google Scholar). In the first, components of the respiratory chain are free to diffuse laterally and independently of one another in the membrane plane and electron transfer is coupled to diffusion-based collisions between these components (2Gupte S.S. Wu E.-S. Hoechli L. Hoechli M. Jacobson K. Sowers A.E. Hackenbrock C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2606-2610Google Scholar, 3Gupte S.S. Hackenbrock C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5248-5253Google Scholar, 4Gupte S.S. Hackenbrock C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5241-5247Google Scholar). In the other model, respiratory components are arranged as an ordered macromolecular assembly or chain. Although the vast majority of studies performed lend weight to favor the first model, numerous observations have been reported indicating that multicomplex units can be isolated (see Ref. 1Rich P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 53-79Google Scholar and references therein). The two models for the organization of the respiratory chain are kinetically distinguishable, the first implying that the components exhibit “pool behavior,” whereas the latter implies the opposite. A homogeneous pool for ubiquinone was originally postulated by Kröger and Klingenberg (5Kröger A. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 39: 313-323Google Scholar) to account for the sigmoidal inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by antimycin A. The other small component of the respiratory chain, cytochrome c, was also shown to function in a common pool (3Gupte S.S. Hackenbrock C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5248-5253Google Scholar). These findings imply that the two small components of the respiratory chain are mobile carriers, mediating electron transfer between freely diffusible large respiratory complexes. Physical evidence for this organization was provided by the group of Hackenbrock, who showed that lateral diffusion of ubiquinone is the rate-limiting step in succinate-linked electron transport (6Chazotte B. Hackenbrock C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4978-4985Google Scholar). In the case of chloroplasts and intact cells of photosynthetic bacteria, a number of observations are incompatible with a model of freely diffusible electron transfer carriers (reviewed in Ref. 7Joliot P. Verméglio A. Joliot A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1141: 151-174Google Scholar). In chloroplasts, reduction of plastoquinone (PQ) 1The abbreviations used are: PQ, plastoquinone; Q, ubiquinone; Q2H2, 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-geranyl-1,4-benzoquinol; IMS, intermembrane space.1The abbreviations used are: PQ, plastoquinone; Q, ubiquinone; Q2H2, 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-geranyl-1,4-benzoquinol; IMS, intermembrane space. displays only partial pool behavior, indicative of limitation of PQ diffusion in the membrane (8Joliot P. Lavergne J. Béal D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 1-12Google Scholar) and suggesting that small size domains exist which limit the rapid time-scale diffusion of PQ. In photosynthetic bacteria, ubiquinone is freely diffusible, but diffusion of the other mobile carrier of this system, cytochrome c2, is restricted to the domain of one supercomplex, which also includes two reaction centers and one cytochrome bc1 complex (9Joliot P. Verméglio A. Joliot A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 336-345Google Scholar). It should be noted that most of the studies on the mitochondrial respiratory chain have been performed with mammalian mitochondria. In this study, we show that, in mitochondria from the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae under conditions of approximately physiological ionic strength, neither ubiquinone nor cytochromec functions in a pool. These results indicate that, at least in yeast, the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes form one functional respiratory unit. When the respiratory components are arranged as an ordered macromolecular assembly, also referred to as the “solid state,” the number of acceptors a carrier can reach (N) is 1. In the other model, where the carriers can freely diffuse through the membrane, the number of acceptors is determined by the lifetime of the reduced state of the carrier of interest and its diffusion constant, but will generally be large (“liquid state”). Other possible states have been described (1Rich P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 53-79Google Scholar), which are intermediate between solid and liquid states. As a consequence, the number of potential acceptors (N) is larger than 1, yet smaller than in the liquid state. In the situation that all ubiquinone or cytochrome c is present in a pool, respiratory activity (Vo) can be described as a function of the maximum rate of reduction (V1) of that component and the maximum rate of oxidation (V2) of that component (5Kröger A. Klingenberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 39: 313-323Google Scholar).Vo=V1×V2(V1+V2)Equation 1 We have studied pool behavior for both ubiquinone and cytochromec mainly by titration of the respiratory activity with antimycin, a high affinity inhibitor of bc1activity. When studying the Q pool, antimycin titrates the oxidation rate (V2). Data were fitted according to Equation 2, where x is the fraction of bc1 activity inhibited by antimycin.Vx=V1×V2×(1−x)(V1+V2×(1−x))Equation 2 In the case of the cytochrome c pool, antimycin titrates the reduction rate (V1). Data were fitted according to Equation 3.Vx=V1×(1−x)×V2(V1×(1−x)+V2)Equation 3 The reaction that is being titrated, V2in the case of succinate oxidation and V1 in the case of NADH oxidation, is also referred to asVtitr. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain DL1 (α, his3, ura3, leu2) was grown on lactate medium (0.5% yeast extract, 0.2% (w/v) magnesium sulfate, 0.6% (w/v) ammonium phosphate, 2% sodium lactate (70% w/v), 1.3% lactic acid (75% w/v), pH 4.5) until late logarithmic phase. Mitochondria were isolated as described previously (10Schoppink P.J. Hemrika W. Reynen J.M. Grivell L.A. Berden J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 115-122Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with the Lowry method (11Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar). Mitochondria were diluted to 10 mg/ml in the mitochondrial respiratory buffer (see below) prior to the measurements. Oxygen consumption rates were measured at 30 °C with a Clark oxygen electrode (Gilson) in a 1.8-ml thermostatically controlled chamber. Rates were determined from the slope of a plot of O2concentration versus time. Mitochondria (0.5 mg of mitochondrial protein) were incubated in the mitochondrial respiratory buffer containing 0.6 m sorbitol, 25 mmpotassium Pi, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2 (also referred to as the standard buffer in this paper). Mitochondria were preincubated with specific inhibitors (antimycin A, KCN) for 2 min. Antimycin A was dissolved in methanol. Substrates (0.5 mm NADH, 5 mmsuccinate, 0.5% ethanol, 5 mm ascorbate + 0.1 mm N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine) were directly added to the reaction chamber. Titrations with different effectors were carried out by taking new mitochondria for each measurement. All measurements were carried out at least twice. The Q2H2:cytochrome c oxidoreductase (bc1) assay was performed spectrophotometrically at 30 °C by measuring the reduction of 18 μmhorse-heart ferricytochrome c at 550–540 nm by 25 μm Q2H2. The buffer used contained 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm potassium cyanide, and 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, to obtain maximal activity with horse-heart cytochrome c as acceptor (12Schoppink P.J. Hemrika W. Berden J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 974: 192-201Google Scholar). Antimycin A is a specific inhibitor of the quinone reduction site and binds to the bc1complex in a 1:1 ratio. Titration of the Q2H2:cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity of S. cerevisiae mitochondria with antimycin results in a linear relationship between inhibitor and electron transfer activity (Fig. 1). In other words, the relative saturation with inhibitor directly provides the relative inhibition of the bc1 activity. The respiratory chain of S. cerevisiae, unlike that of mammals, does not contain complex I. Instead, at least three NADH dehydrogenases are present, two of which transfer electrons to ubiquinone (13de Vries S. Marres C.A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 895: 205-239Google Scholar). When NADH is used as a substrate for respiration of isolated mitochondria, reduction of ubiquinone occurs via the external NADH dehydrogenase. This enzyme is bound to the mitochondrial inner membrane and faces the intermembrane space (IMS). In contrast, when ethanol is used as substrate, ubiquinone is reduced by the internal NADH dehydrogenase, which faces the matrix. Control experiments showed that no (significant) electron transfer occurs via the external NADH dehydrogenase during ethanol oxidation (data not shown), because the mitochondrial isolation procedure used depletes the IMS of NAD+. A third pathway, in which ubiquinone is reduced by succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, is used with succinate as the substrate. As can be seen from Table I, this third pathway is the slowest, whereas use of NADH as a substrate results in the highest oxygen consumption rate. These differences must be due to different rates of ubiquinone reduction, while the total capacity of ubiquinol oxidation by the cytochrome chain remains constant.Table IRespiratory activities using various substratesSubstrate (+ additions)Respiratory Activitynmol O2 min−1 mg−1Succinate60Succinate + cytochromec61Succinate + Q2H291NADH156NADH + cytochrome c223NADH + Q2H2166Ethanol89Ethanol + succinate151NADH + succinate165NADH + ethanol171 Open table in a new tab When studying a putative pool function for a carrier, the fastest reaction rate, either reduction (V1) or oxidation of that carrier (V2), should be titrated to get a clear distinction between pool or no pool. We have chosen to use antimycin, thus titrating the bc1activity, in the study of a pool function for both ubiquinone and cytochrome c. In the case of ubiquinone, the bc1 complex is part of the oxidation reaction. Succinate was used as the substrate to provide a relatively slow Q reduction rate. When considering a possible cytochrome cpool, NADH was used as the substrate to provide a fast reduction rate, because the bc1 complex in this case is part of the reduction reaction. The validity of this set-up is confirmed by the respiratory activities after addition of Q or cytochrome cto the reaction medium; addition of Q increases the succinate oxidation activity, and addition of cytochrome c does not (Table I). In contrast, addition of Q does not increase the NADH oxidation rate, and addition of cytochrome c does. We have also used the cytochrome c oxidase inhibitor KCN to analyze a putative pool function of cytochrome c, thus titrating the oxidation reaction, V2. However, the relatively low affinity of this inhibitor makes it unsuitable for distinguishing between pool or no pool. These measurements did show however that the maximum activity of cytochrome c reduction is approximately the same as the maximum cytochrome coxidation activity, in agreement with previous findings (14Hemrika W. Berden J.A. Grivell L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 601-609Google Scholar). Titration of succinate oxidation using antimycin and using the standard buffer conditions (50 mm ionic strength) generates a linear relationship between activity and the relative amount of inhibitor (Fig. 2), thus indicating that under these conditions ubiquinone does not exhibit pool behavior. However, because the physiological ionic strength in yeast lies around 200 mm (15Prieto S. Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. Rial E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 487-491Google Scholar), we repeated the titration with 125 mmpotassium Pi in the buffer, thereby providing an ionic strength of 250 mm for the reaction medium. As can be seen in Fig. 2, this results in a hyperbolic relationship between succinate oxidation and the relative amount of inhibitor, indicative for a pool function of ubiquinone under these reaction conditions. These data points can be fitted with the equation that describes pool-function kinetics, Vo = V1 ×V2/(V1 +V2), as is described under “Experimental Procedures.” The value for V2 found in the fitting procedure is given in Table IIand is referred to as Vtitr, the maximum rate of the reaction that is titrated with antimycin relative to the overall rate (Vo). When the same procedure is applied to the data found with a buffer containing 25 mm potassium Pi, Vtitr is found to be close to 1, whereas V1 is calculated to be very large, indicating that the pool function kinetics in this case do not apply. In other words, the value found for Vtitr, and in particular its deviation from 1, reflects the degree of pool function of the carrier of interest, in this case ubiquinone.Table IIReaction rates of succinate and NADH oxidation titrated using antimycin under different ionic strength conditionsBuffer (+ additions)Ionic strengthVtitrsuccinate oxidationVtitr NADH oxidationmm25 mmPi501.171.0125 mm Pi + Q2H2503.26ND2-aND, not determined.25 mm Pi + cytochromec50ND0.98125 mm Pi2502.621.6025 mmPi/200 mm KCl2501.081.745 mm Pi/200 mmKCl210ND1.2025 mmPi/50 mm trichloroacetic acid (pH = 7)1002.811.7025 mm Pi/50 mm KCl100ND1.042-a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab However, increase of the phosphate concentration in the reaction buffer may not only increase the ionic strength, but may in addition have an effect on the integrity of the respiratory complexes, because phosphate is a weak chaotropic agent. We therefore investigated which of the two properties of the high phosphate concentration is responsible for creating a pool function for ubiquinone by using different buffers in the reaction medium of the respiratory activity measurements. The results are summarized in Table II in terms of the Vtitr values found after fitting the titration data. Increasing the ionic strength using KCl instead of phosphate does not result in pool behavior, indicating that the pool function of ubiquinone is not dependent on the ionic strength. Furthermore, using the strong chaotropic agent trichloroacetic acid, adjusted to neutral pH, pool function can be introduced even at an intermediate ionic strength. We conclude from these results that, under physiological conditions, there is no ubiquinone pool, due to the fact that succinate dehydrogenase and the bc1 complex together form a functional unit by some form of physical interaction. Chaotropic agents such as trichloroacetic acid and, to a lesser extent, phosphate can disrupt this interaction, thereby introducing pool behavior of ubiquinone. A hyperbolic titration curve can also be obtained at low ionic strength, namely by adding Q2 to the reaction medium. The difference between this Q analogue and ubiquinone present in vivo (Q6) is the length of the hydrophobic isoprenoid site chain. It has been shown before that short-chain ubiquinones exhibit greater lateral mobilities within the membrane (16Schneider H. Lemasters J.J. Hackenbrock C.R. Trumpower B.L. Function of Quinones in Energy Conserving Systems. Academic Press, New York1982: 125-139Google Scholar). We conclude that, even under conditions where succinate dehydrogenase and the bc1 complex physically interact, Q2 exhibits pool behavior because, due to its greater lateral mobility, it can transfer electrons between different succinate dehydrogenase-bc1 complex units. A putative pool function of cytochrome c was studied by titrating NADH oxidation using antimycin. Using the standard buffer conditions a linear relationship between respiratory activity and amount of inhibitor is obtained (Fig. 3), reflected by the value for Vtitr found after fitting these data (Table II). Increasing the phosphate concentration gives similar results as for ubiquinone; titration with antimycin results in a hyperbolic inhibition curve and a value for Vtitr (in this case corresponding to V1) clearly higher than 1 is found. When the standard buffer containing 25 mm phosphate is supplemented with 200 mm KCl, thereby raising the ionic strength to 250 mm, cytochrome c exhibits pool behavior as well. The phosphate concentration was subsequently lowered to 5 mm, which is close to the physiological concentration of 3.6 mm reported for yeast cells in stationary phase (17Wallace P.G. Pedler S.M. Wallace J.C. Berry M.N. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 404-408Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 3 and Table II, titration of NADH oxidation with antimycin produces an inhibition curve intermediate between a straight line and the curve obtained in case of pool behavior of cytochrome c. The results obtained with a buffer containing trichloroacetic acid indicate that, as for ubiquinone, pool behavior of cytochrome c can be introduced at an ionic strength lower than the physiological value. Replacing trichloroacetic acid by the same concentration of KCl, thus giving the same ionic strength, confirms that the chaotropic nature of trichloroacetic acid is responsible for the observed pool behavior of cytochromec (Table II). Addition of cytochrome c to the reaction medium did not induce pool behavior (Table II), presumably because at low ionic strength all cytochrome c is bound to the inner membrane, independent of concentration. The conclusions drawn from these data are depicted in a model in Fig. 4. The standard conditions are reflected in Fig. 4 A. At this low ionic strength cytochromec diffuses in two dimensions, parallel to the inner membrane (2Gupte S.S. Wu E.-S. Hoechli L. Hoechli M. Jacobson K. Sowers A.E. Hackenbrock C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2606-2610Google Scholar). Because the bc1 complex and cytochromec oxidase physically interact, a cytochrome cmolecule that is reduced by a given bc1 complex can only donate its electron to the adjacent cytochrome coxidase (N = 1). At higher ionic strength, cytochromec diffuses in three dimensions, part of it being free in the intermembrane space (2Gupte S.S. Wu E.-S. Hoechli L. Hoechli M. Jacobson K. Sowers A.E. Hackenbrock C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2606-2610Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 B). Although the bc1 complex and cytochrome c oxidase still physically interact, an intermediate pool function of cytochromec is present because the IMS-soluble cytochrome cis able to reach other respiratory units. This, however, results only in a “partial pool function,” because the diffusion in the IMS is relatively slow and, as a consequence, the number of possible acceptors (N) limited. Chaotropic agents present in the reaction buffer cause the dissociation of the respiratory units into separate complexes (Fig. 4 C). A cytochrome c molecule can now theoretically donate its electron to any cytochrome coxidase molecule (N is large), thus showing maximal pool behavior. The mitochondrial inner membrane is generally viewed as a fluid structure in which the two-dimensional movement of the respiratory chain components is a central feature of the process of electron transfer. This view has been confirmed by a large number of studies on the mammalian respiratory chain, where the components behave as independent lateral diffusants. It has been well established that there is a Q pool in mammals as well as a cytochrome c pool, irrespective of the ionic strength (3Gupte S.S. Hackenbrock C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5248-5253Google Scholar). Although there are reports that do not fit with the Q-pool model, Ragan and Cottingham (18Ragan C.I. Cottingham I.R. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 811: 13-31Google Scholar) have shown that, using minor adjustments in the calculation methods, even these data, which at first sight are in conflict with the Q-pool model, can be fitted accordingly. The organization of the respiratory chain in mammals is described by the “random-collision model,” which was proposed by the group of Hackenbrock, based on a large number of studies on diffusion coefficients of the respiratory components (2Gupte S.S. Wu E.-S. Hoechli L. Hoechli M. Jacobson K. Sowers A.E. Hackenbrock C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2606-2610Google Scholar, 3Gupte S.S. Hackenbrock C.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 4978-4985Google Scholar, 19Schneider H. Lemasters J.J. Höchli M. Hackenbrock C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3748-3756Google Scholar). These studies on mitochondrial membranes show the free mobility of the respiratory complexes in vivo. Although structures as complex I/III and complex II/III units could be isolated from mammalian cells (see Ref. 1Rich P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 768: 53-79Google Scholar, and references therein), indicating physical interaction between these complexes under certain in vitroconditions, this is not a reliable criterion for association in vivo. We show in this study that the two small carriers of the respiratory chain of S. cerevisiae, ubiquinone and cytochromec, do not exhibit pool behavior under physiological conditions. This behavior differs clearly from that of the corresponding components of the mammalian respiratory chain, and it implies that these carriers in yeast can only transfer electrons to one specific acceptor molecule. We conclude from this that the respiratory chain complexes in this organism physically interact, thereby forming a functional unit. Because different respiratory pathways exist, differing in the ubiquinone reduction enzyme, different units must exist. A unit consists of the cytochrome chain, supplemented with either succinate dehydrogenase or one of the NADH dehydrogenases. The existence of such units, as based on the kinetic data presented here, does not exclude the possibility that association/dissociation events take place at rates significantly lower than the rate of electron transfer. If occurring, the relative low rates of these events will make them irrelevant with respect to the kinetic behavior of the system and will therefore not introduce pool behavior. This is in contrast to the situation proposed for the respiratory chain in bovine heart by Heron et al. (20Heron C. Ragan C.I. Trumpower B.L. Biochem. J. 1978; 174: 791-800Google Scholar). In their model, electron transfer from NADH to cytochrome b requires interaction between complexes I and III (21Ragan C.I. Heron C. Biochem. J. 1978; 174: 783-790Google Scholar), but to explain the Q-pool behavior in this organism, it is assumed that these supercomplexes are formed and re-formed at rates higher than that of electron transfer. The interpretation of an organization of the yeast respiratory chain in units is additionally supported by the respiratory activities found using different substrates (see Table I). The activity of succinate oxidation plus that of ethanol oxidation equals the respiratory activity when both substrates are used together, inconsistent with the formula for pool function kinetics. This implies that both ubiquinone reduction pathways operate independently, only a fraction of the ubiquinone available being involved and only a fraction of the quinol oxidase system being used in each pathway. When a combination of substrates including NADH is used, the outcome is not so clear. When succinate or ethanol are added together with NADH, the respiratory activity is higher than that of oxidation of NADH alone, although only partial additivity is obtained. We propose that this is because of the fact that the interaction of the external NADH dehydrogenase with the unit is weaker, thereby resulting in a higher rate of associations/dissociations. Based on the fact that partial additivity is observed, despite the fact that the reaction capacity of external NADH:Q6 oxidoreductase is about 11 times higher than that of the total flux of NADH to oxygen (22de Vries S. Grivell L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 377-384Google Scholar), it has to be concluded that this rate is within the same order as the rate of electron transfer. Thus, using NADH as a substrate partial pool behavior is introduced (which, however, is not observed using antimycin) because of the fact that the Q reduction rate is so much higher than the Q oxidation rate. In the case of succinate and ethanol oxidation, pool behavior can be introduced for both ubiquinone and cytochrome c by addition of chaotropic agents, which are known to weaken hydrophobic interactions between proteins inside the membrane. In relation to the view that associations and dissociations take place at a low rate under normal conditions, it can be imagined that addition of chaotropic agents increases this rate to a rate higher than that of electron transfer. Alternatively, the interaction between the respiratory complexes can be disrupted by solubilization of the mitochondrial membranes. When the mild detergent lauryl maltoside was added to the reaction medium, respiratory activity dropped to less than 10% and was only restored by addition of both Q and cytochrome c to the reaction chamber (data not shown). This behavior clearly differs from that of bovine heart, where solubilization of submitochondrial particles did not decrease the succinate:cytochrome c oxidoreductase activity (23Bryla J. Kaniuga Z. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 189: 317-326Google Scholar). These results provide strong support for the idea that the respiratory complexes physically interact and that after solubilization both ubiquinone and cytochrome c become carriers that shuttle between the different respiratory complexes. It has been shown for mammalian mitochondria that an increase of the lipid volume results in a corresponding decrease in the electron transfer reaction rates (16Schneider H. Lemasters J.J. Hackenbrock C.R. Trumpower B.L. Function of Quinones in Energy Conserving Systems. Academic Press, New York1982: 125-139Google Scholar, 19Schneider H. Lemasters J.J. Höchli M. Hackenbrock C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3748-3756Google Scholar), that could be restored by addition of ubiquinone. We propose that, in solubilized yeast mitochondria, the respiratory complexes diffuse freely and a similar organization exists as in “diluted” mammalian mitochondrial membranes. In chloroplasts, rapid diffusion of PQ is restricted to isolated domains (8Joliot P. Lavergne J. Béal D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 1-12Google Scholar, 24Lavergne J. Bouchaud J.-P. Joliot P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 13-22Google Scholar), which may vary in size. The structural interpretation given to account for these domains is the crowding of the membrane by integral proteins. The surface fraction of the membrane occupied by proteins in chloroplasts is close to the two-dimensional percolation threshold, resulting in a network of barriers to diffusion (8Joliot P. Lavergne J. Béal D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 1-12Google Scholar, 24Lavergne J. Bouchaud J.-P. Joliot P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 13-22Google Scholar). The absence of pool behavior for ubiquinone in the respiratory chain in yeast, however, cannot be explained by such a model. First, an organization in isolated domains will result in partial pool behavior (the fast pool fraction in chloroplasts represents 50–70% of the total; Ref. 8Joliot P. Lavergne J. Béal D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 1-12Google Scholar). In the case of the yeast respiratory chain, no Q pool is observed. Second, if such an organization were to exist in yeast, addition of chaotropic agents would not result in introduction of pool behavior. Furthermore, crowding cannot explain the differences in pool behavior of the small carriers in yeast compared with those in higher eukaryotes, inasmuch as the fraction of the mitochondrial inner membrane in mammals occupied by protein is at least as high as in yeast (and in heart tissue even higher). In the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides, reaction centers and cytochrome c2 and bc1 complexes form supercomplexes, thereby limiting diffusion of cytochrome c2. About 70% of these supercomplexes include two reaction centers, one cytochromec2, and one bc1 complex, whereas the remaining ones only include two reaction centers and one cytochrome c2 (9Joliot P. Verméglio A. Joliot A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 336-345Google Scholar). In contrast to the organization in chloroplasts, these structures have a precise stoichiometry and correspond to reproducible oligomeric entities. Such an organization thus corresponds to that of the respiratory chain in yeast. It is proposed that the cytochrome c2molecules trapped in a supercomplex lacking abc1 complex, can slowly escape and react withbc1 complexes located in another area of the membrane (9Joliot P. Verméglio A. Joliot A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 336-345Google Scholar), similar to the model given in Fig. 4 B to account for the partial pool behavior of cytochrome c at high ionic strength. It is interesting to note that the binding affinity of cytochrome c2 to reaction centers is dependent upon the ionic strength of the medium (25Rosen D. Okamura M.Y. Feher G. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5687-5692Google Scholar). Our findings with the yeast S. cerevisiae, showing that both ubiquinone and cytochrome c are not in a pool under physiological conditions and the subsequent interpretation of these data resulting in a unit-model, permit a rational explanation of intercomplex effects observed by others. Bruel et al. (26Bruel C. Brasseur R. Trumpower B.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 59-68Google Scholar) found that certain mutants of subunit VIII of the bc1 complex result in a decrease of the succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity by 40–60%, while leaving the bc1 complex activity unaltered (26Bruel C. Brasseur R. Trumpower B.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 59-68Google Scholar). Interaction between the bc1 complexes and cytochrome c oxidase in yeast is suggested by the studies carried out by Pearce and Sherman (27Pearce D.A. Sherman F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3735-3739Google Scholar), who showed that certain labile forms of cytochrome c are protected from degradation by the interaction with its physiological partners. Because both cytochromesa·a3 and c1 are required for protection, it can be concluded that cytochromec is in close proximity to both of these cytochromes (27Pearce D.A. Sherman F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3735-3739Google Scholar). Recently, it was found that disruption of the ABC1 gene in yeast results in a decrease of activity of complexes II, III, and IV (28Brasseur G. Tron P. Dujardin G. Slonimski P.P. Brivet-Chevillotte P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 103-111Google Scholar). It was concluded that the ABC1 gene product acts as a chaperone-like protein essential for correct folding of the bc1 complex, and that the effects on complexes II and IV might result from interactions with the modifiedbc1 complex. Beattie and co-workers (29Beattie D.S. Japa S. Howton M. Zhu Q.-s. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 499-505Google Scholar) have shown that the reduction of exogenous quinones by the internal NADH dehydrogenase could be almost completely inhibited by myxothiazol, indicating that the exchange of endogenous ubiquinone with the added quinone does not occur at the level of the Q reduction site of NADH dehydrogenase, but at the level of the bc1complex, implying that these two enzymes physically interact during electron transfer. Reduction of quinones by the external NADH dehydrogenase could only be inhibited by 18% using myxothiazol, which made the authors conclude that the external NADH dehydrogenase does not interact with the bc1 complex (29Beattie D.S. Japa S. Howton M. Zhu Q.-s. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 499-505Google Scholar). However, we propose that these data do not argue against the unit-model. As discussed above, we propose that the interaction of the external NADH dehydrogenase in the respiratory unit is rather weak, thus resulting in partial pool behavior. This interpretation is in agreement with the partial sensitivity to myxothiazol of ubiquinone reduction by the external NADH dehydrogenase (29Beattie D.S. Japa S. Howton M. Zhu Q.-s. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 499-505Google Scholar). Furthermore, the unit-model clarifies our recent findings with certain yeast mutants, which exhibit a reduced assembly efficiency of the bc1 complex, resulting in a lower steady-state level of this complex. Parallel to this, a lower steady-state level of cytochrome c oxidase is found in these mutants, implying a regulatory mechanism that prevents an overcapacity of this complex with respect to the bc1 complex activity. 2H. Boumans, J. A. Berden, L. A. Grivell, and K. van Dam, manuscript in preparation. The ability to “sense” the steady-state level of the bc1complex in our view supports the idea that physical interaction exists between the two complexes. Why should yeast organize its respiratory chain differently from higher eukaryotes? The single-unit organization we describe is reminiscent of that found in many bacteria. The organization of the respiratory chain in many prokaryotes is very complex, in that it contains alternative terminal oxidases in addition to the pathway similar to that in eukaryotes. The possession of respiratory branches enables the bacterium to adapt its efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation to changes in the environmental conditions (30de Gier J.-W.L. Lübben M. Reijnders W.N.M. Tipker C.A. Slotboom D.-J. van Spanning R.J.M. Stouthamer A.H. van der Oost J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 183-196Google Scholar). One of the respiratory branches exists of a ubiquinol oxidase, which can be considered to be a supercomplex constituted of both a bc1 complex and a cytochrome c oxidase and which can be found in,e.g., Paracoccus denitrificans (31Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2458-2467Google Scholar),Sulfolobus acidocaldarius (32Iwasaki T. Matsuura K. Oshima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30881-30892Google Scholar), and the thermophilic bacterium PS3 (33Sone N. Sekimachi M. Kutoh E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15386-15391Google Scholar), and can be considered to be a primitive characteristic. The physical interaction between the bc1 complex and cytochrome c oxidase in ubiquinol oxidase implies that a pool function for cytochromec is absent. In respect of the supracomplex organization in S. cerevisiae, it can be imagined that this offers advantages in terms of response to rapidly fluctuating availability of different substrates. S. cerevisiae is known for its capacity to radically alter metabolism by availability of a fermentable carbon source. When glucose is available, synthesis of respiratory chain components is strongly repressed. If the respiratory chain in yeast would be organized in separate complexes, a decrease in concentration of these complexes would result in a dramatic decrease in respiratory capacity. It has been shown for mammalian mitochondria that when the phospholipid to protein ratio increases, the respiratory activity proportionally decreases, due to an increase in average distance between respiratory complexes (19Schneider H. Lemasters J.J. Höchli M. Hackenbrock C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3748-3756Google Scholar). When the concentration of respiratory complexes decreases by, e.g., a factor of 5, the respiratory capacity of a chain organized in freely diffusing respiratory components will decrease by approximately a factor 25, inasmuch as the activity per protein also decreases. However, in the case of a unit-organized chain, the respiratory capacity will only decrease by a factor of 5. In other words, the organization in units might serve to “buffer” respiratory capacity at low concentrations of respiratory complexes under glucose-repressive conditions. For multicellular organisms, there is much less need for a compact organization of the respiratory chain in a unit (or even a supercomplex), because of cellular homeostasis. An organization of separate, independently diffusing complexes, however, provides the advantage that all enzyme complexes of the cytochrome chain can participate in electron transfer, irrespective of the substrate available. How might interaction between the complexes in yeast be achieved? Two possibilities can be envisaged; either differences exist in function of subunits of the individual complexes, or the accessory factors required for assembly of the respiratory chain differ between yeast and mammals. The latter is made less likely in view of the strong evolutionary conservation of many of these proteins (from prokaryotes to higher eukaryotes in the case of, e.g., Abc1p (34Bousquet I. Dujardin G. Slonimski P.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2023-2031Google Scholar), Sco1p (35Glerum D.M. Shtanko A. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20531-20535Google Scholar), and Oxa1p (36Bonnefoy N. Kermorgant M. Groundinsky O. Minet M. Slonimski P.P. Dujardin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11978-11982Google Scholar)) and examples that show functionality of human homologues in yeast (36Bonnefoy N. Kermorgant M. Groundinsky O. Minet M. Slonimski P.P. Dujardin G. Proc. Natl.

We therefore consider it more likely that some of the supernumerary subunits (subunits that are not directly involved in electron transfer), especially those which show a high level of sequence variation and have been shown to be involved in intracomplex assembly, are involved. As an example, subunit VIII of the yeastbc1 complex can be mentioned (only 18% sequence identity with the bovine heart homologue), which was recently shown to be involved in intercomplex interaction with succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (26Bruel C. Brasseur R. Trumpower B.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 59-68Google Scholar). We thank A. F. Hartog for the synthesis of ubiquinone-2."

Shinkai K. Akedo H. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1991; 82: 493-496Google Scholar), and this effect of serum was completely substituted by 1-oleoyl-lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (8Imamura F. Horai T. Mukai M. Shinkai K. Sawada M. Akedo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 497-503Google Scholar). The effect of LPA on the induction of transmigration was abolished by the pretreatment of MM1 cells with C3 ADP-ribosyltransferase (C3) (Clostridium botulinum) (9Imamura F. Shinkai K. Mukai M. Yoshioka K. Komagome R. Iwasaki T. Akedo H. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 65: 627-632Google Scholar), which is known to specifically inhibit the function of small GTP-binding protein Rho (10Aktories K. Hall A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 415-418Google Scholar, 11Sekine A. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8602-8605Google Scholar), suggesting that Rho plays a pivotal role in this transmigration. Rho protein is a well known member of the p21 Ras superfamily of small GTPases, which exhibits both GDP/GTP binding and GTPase activities. Rho regulates signal transduction from receptors in the membrane to a variety of cellular events related to cell morphology (12Paterson H.F. Self A.J. Garrett M.D. Just I. Aktories K. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1001-1007Google Scholar), motility (13Takaishi K. Kikuchi A. Kuroda S. Kotani K. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Mol. Cell.

Morii N. Mishima M. Narumiya S. Zygote. 1993; 1: 325-331Google Scholar), and tumor progression (16Perona R. Esteve P. Jiménez B. Ballestero R.P. Cajal S.R. Lacal J.C.

Recently, a series of reports suggested that Rho plays an important regulatory role in induced myosin light chain (MLC) 20 phosphorylation, actomyosin stimulation, and the consequent contraction of smooth muscles (21Hirata K. Kikuchi A. Sasaki T. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Matsuura Y. Seki H. Saida K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8719-8722Google Scholar, 22Noda M. Yasuda-Fukazawa C. Moriishi K. Kato T. Okuda T.

Rho-dependent contraction was also found in the neurites of mouse neuroblastoma (NIE-115) and rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Treatment with C3 inhibited LPA-induced actomyosin-based contractile forces and thereby prevents this neurite retraction and cell rounding (25Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Google Scholar). Rho also might involve the myosin-based contractility in the formation of focal adhesion and stress fibers in Balb/c 3T3 fibroblast (26Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Google Scholar). Here we have focused on how Rho regulates the actomyosin system, leading to transmigration of tumor cells, and how Rho controls signal transduction pathways during the LPA-induced transmigration of tumor cells. Preliminary reports of this work have appeared (27Yoshioka K. Imamura F. Shinkai K. Miyoshi J. Ogawa H. Mukai M. Komagome R. Akedo H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 25-28Google Scholar, 28Itoh K. Yoshioka K. Akedo H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7 (abstr.): 234Google Scholar). G418 (Geneticin) and all culture medium were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Pwo DNA polymerase was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany). LPA and KT5926 were from Sigma. LPA was dissolved in PBS containing 0.1% BSA. KT5926 was dissolved in Me2SO. [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mol), [α-32P]NAD (800 Ci/mmol), and [α-35S]dATP (1000 Ci/mol) were from Daiichi Pure Chemicals (Tokyo, Japan). Mesothelial cells were isolated from Donryu rat mesentery and cultured in minimum essential medium containing 2-fold concentrations of amino acid and vitamins (M-MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), as reported previously (5Akedo H. Shinkai K. Mukai M. Mori Y. Tateishi R. Tanaka K. Yamamoto R. Morishita T. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2416-2422Google Scholar). MM1 cells (a highly invasive clone) (5Akedo H. Shinkai K. Mukai M. Mori Y. Tateishi R. Tanaka K. Yamamoto R. Morishita T. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2416-2422Google Scholar) and W1 cells (a very low invasive clone) (6Akedo H. Shinkai K. Mukai M. Komatsu K. Invasion Metastasis. 1989; 9: 134-148Google Scholar), isolated from the same parental AH130 cells, were maintained as a suspension in the M-MEM supplemented with 10% FCS and split at a 1:20 ratio every 3 days. The expression plasmids were designed to generate from pEXV-active (Val14) RhoA vector, provided by Dr. A. Hall (University college, London). A 0.63-kilobase pairEcoRI–NotI fragment, containing full-length human RhoA cDNA tagged at the N terminus with FLAG sequence (8 amino acids; DYKDDDDK) (29Brizzard B.L. Chubet R.G. Vizard D.L. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 730-734Google Scholar), was generated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique using the forward primer 5′-CTTGAATTCATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGGCTGCCATCCGGAAGAAACTGGTG-3′ (60-mer) and the reverse primer 5′-TTTGCGGCCGCTCATCACAAGACAAGGCAACC-3′ (32-mer) with pEXV-active RhoA as the template. PCR was carried out as follows: denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C, annealing for 1 min at 56 °C, extension for 1 min at 72 °C with 30 thermal cycles, following 7-min extension using Pwo DNA polymerase. This fragment contained the FLAG tag sequence at the N terminus of full-length human RhoA cDNA with an EcoRI site engineered before the start ATG codon and a NotI site after the 3′-end of the open reading frame. The generated mutant cDNA was introduced into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) at the site of EcoRI and NotI. Mutation of active RhoA (C3-sensitive) to constitutively active RhoA (Val14, codon 41 Asn (AAC) to Ile (ATC)) was generated as follows. First PCR used two sets of primers: first set forward primer, 5′-CGGAAGAAACTGGTG-3′ (15-mer); first set reverse primer, 5′-ACATAGATCTCAAACACTGT-3′ (20-mer); second set forward primer, 5′-TTGAGATCTATGTGGCAGAT-3′ (20-mer); second set reverse primer, 5′-TCACAAGACAAGGCAACC-3′ (18-mer) with pcDNA3-FLAG-Val14 RhoA as the template. 30 cycles of PCR were carried out as follows: denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C, annealing for 1 min at 60 °C, extension for 1 min at 72 °C following a 7-min extension. The PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and were extended to generate double-stranded DNA in the presence of Pwo polymerase and dNTPs for 5 min at 72 °C. The products were gel-purified and then served as the template for the second series of PCR using the forward primer 5′-CGGAAGAAACTGGTG-3′ (15-mer) and the reverse primer 5′-TCACAAGACAAGGCAACC-3′ (18-mer). The mutant cDNAs were introduced into the expression vector pcDNA3 at the sites of EcoRI and NotI. All plasmids were sequenced with the dideoxy termination method (30Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) using [α-35S]ATP and the Sequi-Gen sequence apparatus (Bio-Rad) to verify the correct substitutions. Cells (MM1 or W1) in log phase growth were centrifuged and resuspended in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml. 5 μg of plasmid was added to 80 μl of cell suspension, and electroporation was performed using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser (capacitance, 25 microfarads; field strength, 2.5 kV/cm) as described previously (27Yoshioka K. Imamura F. Shinkai K. Miyoshi J. Ogawa H. Mukai M. Komagome R. Akedo H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 25-28Google Scholar). After the transfection, the cells were grown in the M-MEM with 10% FCS for 48 h, following the selection with G418 (200–300 μg/ml). Clonal transfectants were isolated with limiting dilution method. The assay procedure of in vitro invasive ability of tumor cells was described previously (5Akedo H. Shinkai K. Mukai M. Mori Y. Tateishi R. Tanaka K. Yamamoto R. Morishita T. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2416-2422Google Scholar). Briefly, after mesothelial cells from rat mesentery had reached confluency in a 35-mm dish, the culture medium was removed, and 2 × 105 tumor cells were seeded onto the mesothelial cell monolayer in the M-MEM containing LPA or FCS. The number of the penetrated single tumor cells and tumor cell colonies (invasion foci) was counted under a phase contrast microscope (Olympus, Japan) in 16 different visual fields (0.59 mm2 each). The in vitro invasion ability was quantitatively calculated as the percentage of infiltrated cells out of total seeded cells. In some experiments, tumor cells were pretreated with 50 μg/ml C3 for 24 h or with 15 μm KT5926 for 30 min, followed by washing twice with M-MEM. Statistical comparisons were made using Student's t test. Escherichia coli expression of C3 was achieved by use of the pGEX2T vectors, kindly provided by Dr. Larry Feig (Tufts University, Boston, MA), encoding the glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-C3 fusion protein. The purification procedure of recombinant C3 was described previously (31Dillon S.T. Feig L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 174-184Google Scholar). Briefly, pGEX-transformed E. coli (strain RR1) was grown to midexponential phase, induced for 3 h with 0.1 mmisopropyl-thio-β-galactoside, and centrifuged at 5000 ×g for 10 min. The precipitated material was lysed in the lysis buffer (PBS containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The bacterial lysate was incubated with glutathione-coupled Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia, Sweden) and eluted with glutathione. Separation of C3 from the GST was carried out by the cleavage with 250 units/ml thrombin (Sigma) for 20 h at 22 °C. MM1 and W1 cells and their active RhoA transfectants were plated at 5 × 105 cells/35-mm dish and cultured in M-MEM containing 10% FCS with or without 50 μg/ml of C3 for 24 h. The cells were then washed with PBS and spun down by brief centrifugation. Cell pellets were suspended in 50 μl of homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 5 μm leupeptin) and were homogenized on ice by 10 strokes in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant (20 μg of protein) or GST-RhoA (60 ng) was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h with 1 μg of C3 and 50 μm[32P]NAD (final concentration of 250 μCi/ml) in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), containing 10 mmnicotinamide, 10 mm thymidine, 10 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2 in a total volume of 100 μl. After the reaction, the mixture was added to 400 μl of 0.02% sodium deoxycholate and 200 μl of 24% trichloroacetic acid. The mixture was chilled on ice for 20 min and then centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), heated at 100 °C for 3 min and subjected to SDS-12% PAGE. After staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, the gel was dried and was exposed for 16 h to Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Corp.). ADP-ribosylation was estimated with a previously reported method (33Morii N. Narumiya S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 196-206Google Scholar, 34Tominaga T. Sugie K. Hirata M. Morii N. Fukata J. Uchida A. Imura H. Narumiya S. J. Cell. Biol. 1993; 120: 1529-1537Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from culture cells using Trizol Reagent (Life Technologies). RNA was denatured by the treatment with 1.1m glyoxal, run in a 1% agarose gel, and then transferred for 16 h by capillary action to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham) and UV cross-linked with a cross-linker (1200 watts) (Stratagene). A [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probe was made with Multiprime DNA labeling systems (Amersham). Membrane was hybridized for 2 h at 65 °C with the Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham) containing the radioactive probe. After hybridization, the filters were washed twice for 10 min at room temperature in 0.1% SDS, 2 × SSC and twice for 30 min at 65 °C in 0.1% SDS, 0.2 × SSC. Processed filter was exposed for 16 h to Hyperfilm-MP. The human RhoA cDNA of the plasmid pcDNA3-FLAG-RhoA was cut with NheI and EcoRI, generating a N-terminal FLAG-RhoA fragment of 424 base pairs used for specific detection of the human RhoA. The rat RhoA cDNA was generated with RNA-PCR using 1 μg of total RNA from MM1 cells and a set of primers: RhoA forward primer 5′-ATGGCTGCCATCCGGAAGAA-3′ (20-mer) and RhoA reverse primer 5′-TCACAAGACAAGGCAACCA-3′ (18-mer). The reverse transcriptase reaction was carried out using random hexamers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Takara, Otsu, Japan). The PCR reaction profile included 35 cycles of denaturation for 1 min at 95 °C, annealing for 1 min at 65 °C, and extension for 1 min at 72 °C usingPwo DNA polymerase. The PCR product was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, subcloned into pCR-ScriptSK(+) vector (Stratagene), and sequenced. 2K. Yoshioka and K. Itoh, unpublished results.The 579 base pairs of rat full-length RhoA cDNA was used for a specific probe for rat RhoA. The RhoA probe for RNA blotting was an equal mixture of the human RhoA probe and the rat RhoA probe. Full-length cDNA of MLC20 from MM1 cells was generated with RNA-PCR using 1 μg of total RNA prepared from MM1 cells and a set of primers (forward, 5′-ATGTCGAGCAAAAGAGCGAAG-3′ (21-mer), and reverse, 5′-TCAGTCATCTTTGTCTTTCGC-3′ (21-mer)). PCR conditions were the same as for rat RhoA cDNA. The gel-purified PCR products were cloned into pCR-Script vector and sequenced. The sequence was almost identical to the reported sequence of cultured rat aortic smooth muscle MLC20 (35Taubman M.B. Grant J.W. Nadal-Ginard B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1505-1513Google Scholar), besides the 31st codon from CAG (Gln) to GAG (Glu). 3K. Itoh, unpublished data. This cDNA was inserted into pVL1392 transfer vector (Invitrogen) at NotI and EcoRI sites, and recombinant baculoviruses were generated with the plasmid and linear wild type Autographa californica multiple nuclear polyhydrosis virus (AcMNPV) DNA (Invitrogen) using a cationic liposome-mediated technique. The recombinant virus was isolated by a plaque assay according to the instruction manual (Invitrogen). Sf9 cells (1 × 107 cells) (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) were infected with the recombinant baculoviruses and cultured for 3 days in Grace's insect medium supplemented with 10% FCS. The cells were harvested, washed with PBS twice, and homogenized in 1 ml of cell extraction buffer (7 m urea, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)) in ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, an equal volume of ethanol was added to the supernatant. The mixture was then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C again, and an equal volume of ethanol was added to the supernatant and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C again. Final pellet was dissolved with 100 μl of the extraction buffer and used for the control of MLC20 of MM1 cells. To analyze MLC20 phosphorylation, cells were plated in the M-MEM with 10% FCS and grown to confluency. Confluent cells were then washed twice with the M-MEM without FCS and rendered quiescent by incubating in the medium for 16 h. In some experiments, 15 μmof KT5926 was added to the M-MEM and incubated for 30 min and washed with the same medium. 25 μm of LPA were added to the same medium and incubated for various times. Medium was removed, cells were washed with PBS twice, and 10% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid was added for 30 min in ice. Cells were centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 10 min, and the precipitated material was washed twice with acetone containing 10 mm DTT to remove trichloroacetic acid, dried at room temperature, and dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Samples were then heated at 100 °C for 3 min and subjected to SDS-12% PAGE. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (0.2 μm, Bio-Rad) with the semidry method and blocked with 3% BSA in TPBS (PBS plus 0.05% Tween) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were anti-PMLC20 polyclonal Abs (specific for phosphorylated Ser19) at a 1:100 dilution, and secondary antibody was anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Promega) used at a 1:7500 dilution. Final signal was developed using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (Promega) as substrate. The blot membrane was scanned with a GT-9500 flat scanner (Epson, Japan) and analyzed with NIH Image software using a Power Macintosh computer (Apple, Japan). Relative phosphorylation level of MLC20 in MM1 cells was estimated from the signal of P-MLC20 normalized with the signal of MLC20, which was obtained by immunoblotting using MY21 monoclonal Abs on the duplicate blot. The absolute phosphorylation level of MLC20 was estimated using the extracts from cultured human endothelial cells (as internal control) by the comparison of signal density reacted to PMLC20 Abs with in situ MLC20 phosphorylation level determined by the previously reported urea-PAGE immunoblotting method using anti-MLC20 Abs (36Itoh K. Hara T. Yamada F. Shibata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1136: 52-56Google Scholar). Cells were washed with PBS twice and lysed in a lysis buffer (10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 50 mm NaCl, 50 mmNaF, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μm leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) for 30 min in ice. The lysates were centrifuged to remove insoluble materials, normalized according to their protein content, and loaded onto SDS-12% PAGE. The gel was transferred to a Finetrap NT-31 membrane (Nippon Eido, Tokyo, Japan) with a semidry blotting apparatus and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 3% BSA (Promega, Madison, WI) in TPBS. Primary antibodies were 1 μg/ml anti-RhoA polyclonal Abs (SC-179, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), which could detect human and rat RhoA equally. Secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham) used at a 1:50,000 dilution, and final signal was detected by ECL (Amersham). Next, FLAG-RhoA proteins were detected on the same blots. Membrane was stripped with a solution containing 2% SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) for 30 min at 50 °C, washed with TPBS, and blocked with 3% BSA in TPBS for 16 h at 4 °C. Membrane was then reprobed with anti-FLAG M5 monoclonal Abs (Eastman Kodak Co.) (9 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature, washed with TPBS, and incubated with a 1:20,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody (Amersham) for 1 h at room temperature following detection by ECL. Cells were starved in the M-MEM without FCS for 16 h and subsequently treated with LPA at 37 °C for various times. The cell lysate was prepared as described under “Estimation of MLC20 Phosphorylation in Situ.” The lysates were separated by SDS-8% PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane with the semidry blotting method and blocked with 3% BSA in TPBS for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were a 1:1000 dilution of anti-phosphospecific MAPK polyclonal Abs (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and secondary antibody was goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase used at a 1:7500 dilution and developed with the same alkaline phosphatase substrate. Membrane was stripped and then reprobed with 1 μg/ml anti-p44/42 MAPK polyclonal Abs (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at room temperature, washed with TPBS, and incubated with a 1:7500 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase for 30 min at room temperature following detection with the alkaline phosphatase substrate. To examine the role of RhoA protein in tumor cell motility and morphology, we expressed RhoA protein mutants in MM1 cells (a highly invasive cell line from parental AH130 cells). Full-length cDNA of active and C3-sensitive Val14 (V14), or active and C3-insensitive (Asn41, the catalytic site of C3 to Ile, Val14/Ile41 (V14/I41) form of human RhoA was constructed with N-terminal FLAG tag sequence and introduced into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (see Fig. 1; compare the size of transcripts of endogenous and expressed RhoAs). These plasmids were transfected into MM1 cells, and stably expressed transfectants were isolated by the selection using G418. We obtained a number of clones of stable transfectants and analyzed them with RNA blotting using a RhoA probe as shown in Fig. 2 A. The expression levels of active RhoA transcript varied from 10 to 80% of those of endogenous RhoA in these transfectants. Immunoblotting analysis using anti-FLAG monoclonal Abs or anti-RhoA polyclonal Abs (Fig. 2 B) revealed that the protein expression level of FLAG-RhoA was 5–10% of that of endogenous RhoA in these cells (Fig. 2, compare A and B), suggesting posttranscriptional regulation in the expression of RhoA. The mobility difference between V14RhoA and V14/I41RhoA on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B) was likely to be the conformational difference in these RhoA mutants, which has already been reported previously (12Paterson H.F. Self A.J. Garrett M.D. Just I. Aktories K. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1001-1007Google Scholar). Fig. 2 C demonstrates that these transfectants showed 25–100 times higher in vitro invasiveness through the MCL in the absence of FCS in the assay medium than did mock transfectants. It is of note that there was a positive correlation between the expression level of active RhoA and in vitro invasiveness among these transfectant clones (Fig. 2 C).Figure 2Induction of in vitroinvasiveness in transfected MM1 cells with human active RhoA. A, RNA blot analysis. 4 μg of total RNA isolated from several clones (clones 1–3) of transfectants, MM1 cells, and transfectant of vector alone were separated in a 1% agarose gel. Filter was prepared and hybridized with the radioactive probe indicated on the left. GAPDH, glyceroaldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. B, immunoblot analysis. Cell lysates prepared from each cells were separated on SDS-12% PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-RhoA Abs. Blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-FLAG Abs. The expression levels of V14RhoA and V14/I41RhoA were determined by scanning the intensity of each band on the blots and averaging. C, in vitro invasion assay. Cells (2 × 105 cells/dish) were seeded on the mesothelial cell layer in the absence of FCS in the assay medium. In vitro invasion ability was calculated as the percentage of the infiltrated cells out of the total seeded cells. Dotted barsrepresent in vitro invasiveness, and closed barsrepresent the level of expression of active RhoA estimated frompanel B. Error bars indicate the S.E. of three different experiments for the in vitro invasion assay and duplicate scanning of the blot for the expression level.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next examined the morphology of these cells in the presence of serum. In contrast to mock transfectants, which grew in suspension, the V14RhoA and V14/I41RhoA transfectants adhered to the plastic culture dish with scattered shape (Fig. 3,A, B, and D). Treatment with 50 μg/ml exoenzyme C3 for 24 h made V14RhoA cells completely round up, and the cell morphology was reversed to that of parental MM1 cells (Fig. 3 C); however, V14/I41RhoA cells were resistant to the C3 treatment and remained adhered to the culture dish (Fig. 3 E). To examine the in vivo invasive ability of these transfected cells, 2 × 107 cells were implanted in the peritoneal cavity of the syngenic rat. The active RhoA-transfected cells invaded more extensively into the peritoneum and formed many more tumor nodules as compared with mock transfectants (data not shown). The incidence of macroscopic tumor nodule present in the peritoneum of rats implanted with active RhoA transfectants (6 of 10 for V14RhoA and 5 of 7 for V14/I41RhoA) was higher than that of rats implanted with mock transfectants (2 of 8) (see Table I). These results suggested that the activation of RhoA greatly promoted the tumor invasive ability in vivo as well as in vitro. We could not find any macroscopic metastatic legion (lung, liver, spleen, stomach) in th"

The mechanisms involved in the lymphoid specificity of the disease are not fully understood due to the inaccessibility of human tissues for detailed analysis and the absence of an adequate animal model for the disease. We report the use of a two-stage genetic engineering strategy to generate ADA-deficient mice that retain many features associated with ADA deficiency in humans, including a combined immunodeficiency. Severe T and B cell lymphopenia was accompanied by a pronounced accumulation of 2′-deoxyadenosine and dATP in the thymus and spleen, and a marked inhibition of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase in these organs. Accumulation of adenosine was widespread among all tissues examined. ADA-deficient mice also exhibited severe pulmonary insufficiency, bone abnormalities, and kidney pathogenesis. These mice have providedin vivo information into the metabolic basis for the immune phenotype associated with ADA deficiency. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency in humans leads to a combined immunodeficiency. The mechanisms involved in the lymphoid specificity of the disease are not fully understood due to the inaccessibility of human tissues for detailed analysis and the absence of an adequate animal model for the disease.

These mice have providedin vivo information into the metabolic basis for the immune phenotype associated with ADA deficiency. Genetic defects in purine metabolism in humans result in serious metabolic disorders, often with pronounced tissue-specific phenotypes (1Blaese R.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 3. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 3895-3909Google Scholar). A striking example of this is adenosine deaminase (ADA) 1The abbreviations used are: ADA, adenosine deaminase; SCID, severe combined immunodeficiency disease; AdoHcy,S-adenosylhomocysteine; kb, kilobase pair(s); RBC, red blood cell.1The abbreviations used are: ADA, adenosine deaminase; SCID, severe combined immunodeficiency disease; AdoHcy,S-adenosylhomocysteine; kb, kilobase pair(s); RBC, red blood cell. deficiency, which results in impaired lymphoid development and a severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) (2Hershfield M.S. Mitchell B.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 1. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 1725-1768Google Scholar). ADA-deficient SCID was the first of the inherited immunodeficiencies for which the underlying molecular defect was identified (3Giblett E.R. Anderson A.J. Cohen F. Pollara B. Meuwissen H.J. Lancet. 1972; 2: 1067-1069Google Scholar); however, despite over 20 years of subsequent research, a satisfactory explanation for the lymphoid specificity of this metabolic disease has not emerged. This is largely due to the inaccessibility of human tissue for detailed phenotypic and metabolic analysis and the absence of an animal model which retains features of ADA deficiency in humans. The availability of a genetic animal model for ADA deficiency would make possible a wide range of biochemical and immunological experiments that are not permissible with humans. Additional interest in ADA deficiency stems from recent attempts to use novel therapeutic strategies, including enzyme therapy (4Hershfield M.S. Chaffee S. Sorensen R.U. Pediatr. Res. 1993; 33: S35-S41Google Scholar) and gene therapy (5Bordingon C. Notarangelo L.D. Nobili N. Ferrari G. Casorati G. Panina P. Mazzolari E. Maggioni D. Rossi C. Servida P. Ugazio A., G. Mavilia F. Science. 1995; 270: 470-480Google Scholar, 6Blaese R.M. Culver K.W. Miller A.D. Carter C.S. Fleisher T. Clerici M. Shearer G. Chang L. Chiang Y. Tolstoshev P. Greenblatt J.J. Rosenberg S.A. Klein H. Berger M. Mullen C.A. Ramsey W.A. Muu L. Morgan R.A. Anderson W.F. Science. 1995; 270: 475-480Google Scholar), to treat the condition in humans. Although the results of these therapeutic approaches are encouraging, unexpected outcomes have raised numerous important questions regarding the efficacy of specific treatment protocols (4Hershfield M.S. Chaffee S. Sorensen R.U. Pediatr. Res. 1993; 33: S35-S41Google Scholar, 7Blaese R.M. Pediatr. Res. 1995; 33: S49-S55Google Scholar). The pace with which new enzyme and gene therapy protocols can be tested would be greatly increased by the availability of an animal model for ADA deficiency. Successful attempts to generate ADA-deficient mice were initially reported by two groups (8Wakamiya M. Blackburn M.R. Jurecic R. McArthur M.J. Geske R.S. Cartwright J. Mitani K. Vaishnav S. Belmont J.W. Kellems R.E. Finegold M.J. Caskey C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3673-3677Google Scholar, 9Migchielsen A.A.J. Breuer M.L. van Roon M.A. te Riele H. Zurcher C. Ossendorp F. Toutain S. Hershfield M.S. Berns A. Valerio D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 279-287Google Scholar), resulting in animals with independent sites of Ada gene disruption. In each case, a similar phenotype was observed. ADA-deficient fetuses died perinatally due to severe liver damage (8Wakamiya M. Blackburn M.R. Jurecic R. McArthur M.J. Geske R.S. Cartwright J. Mitani K. Vaishnav S. Belmont J.W. Kellems R.E. Finegold M.J. Caskey C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3673-3677Google Scholar, 9Migchielsen A.A.J. Breuer M.L. van Roon M.A. te Riele H. Zurcher C. Ossendorp F. Toutain S. Hershfield M.S. Berns A. Valerio D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 279-287Google Scholar). This phenotype was accompanied by profound disturbances in purine metabolism, including marked increases in the ADA substrates adenosine and 2′-deoxyadenosine. Both adenosine and 2′-deoxyadenosine are biologically active purines that can have profound impact on cellular physiology. Adenosine is an extracellular signaling molecule that binds G-protein-coupled receptors on the surface of target cells to elicit a wide variety of physiological responses (10Stiles G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6451-6454Google Scholar) including T lymphocyte cell death (11Szondy Z. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 877-885Google Scholar, 12Kizaki H. Suzuki K. Tadakuma T. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5280-5284Google Scholar). 2′-Deoxyadenosine is a cytotoxic metabolite that can kill cells through mechanisms that include disturbances in deoxynucleotide metabolism (13Ullman B. Gudas L.J. Cohen A. Martin Jr., D.W. Cell. 1978; 14: 365-375Google Scholar,14Cohen A. Hirschhorn R. Horowitz S.D. Rubinstein A. Polmar S.H. Hong Martin Jr., D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 472-476Google Scholar) and the inhibition of cellular transmethylation reactions (15Hershfield M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 22-25Google Scholar, 16Hershfield M.S. Kredich N.M. Ownby D.R. Ownby H. Buckley R. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 63: 807-811Google Scholar). ADA-deficient fetuses exhibited evidence for both of these mechanisms of 2′-deoxyadenosine cytotoxicity, in that levels of the 2′-deoxyadenosine metabolite, dATP, were markedly elevated, and the enzyme S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase was inhibited (8Wakamiya M. Blackburn M.R. Jurecic R. McArthur M.J. Geske R.S. Cartwright J. Mitani K. Vaishnav S. Belmont J.W. Kellems R.E. Finegold M.J. Caskey C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3673-3677Google Scholar, 9Migchielsen A.A.J. Breuer M.L. van Roon M.A. te Riele H. Zurcher C. Ossendorp F. Toutain S. Hershfield M.S. Berns A. Valerio D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 279-287Google Scholar). These metabolic disturbances are thought to contribute to the liver damage and subsequent death of ADA-deficient fetuses. The perinatal death of ADA-deficient fetuses precluded our ability to assess the consequences of ADA deficiency in postnatal animals. In the current report, we describe the use of a transgenic strategy whereby we rescued ADA-deficient fetuses from perinatal lethality by restoringAda expression to trophoblast cells. This provided us with postnatal animals that were completely ADA-deficient. These ADA-deficient mice retain many features seen in ADA-deficient humans, in particular a severe lymphopenia and combined immunodeficiency. In addition, ADA-deficient mice develop severe pulmonary insufficiency, and bone and kidney abnormalities were detected. The ability to examine metabolic disturbances in a variety of tissues of ADA-deficient mice revealed a widespread accumulation of adenosine, whereas 2′-deoxyadenosine accumulated in a predominantly lymphoid-specific manner. AdoHcy hydrolase inhibition and dATP accumulation were greatest in the thymus and spleen of ADA-deficient mice. These genetically engineered ADA-deficient mice have thus provided novel in vivo information into the metabolic basis for the immune phenotype associated with ADA deficiency. An ADA minigene (18Blackburn M.R. Wakamiya M. Caskey C.T. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23891-23894Google Scholar) was fused to a 2.0-kb BamHI to EagI genomic fragment in the 5′-flanking region of the murine Ada gene that contained a 770-base pair trophoblast regulatory element (17Shi D. Winston J.H. Blackburn M.R. Datta S.K. Hanten G. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2334-2341Google Scholar). This construct was purified and used to generate transgenic mice (18Blackburn M.R. Wakamiya M. Caskey C.T. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23891-23894Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was isolated from tails at postnatal days 15–22, digested with BamHI, and hybridized with the internal 3.5-kb probe shown in Fig. 1 C (8Wakamiya M. Blackburn M.R. Jurecic R. McArthur M.J. Geske R.S. Cartwright J. Mitani K. Vaishnav S. Belmont J.W. Kellems R.E. Finegold M.J. Caskey C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3673-3677Google Scholar, 18Blackburn M.R. Wakamiya M. Caskey C.T. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23891-23894Google Scholar). ADA transcript levels in placentas and fetuses were monitored by RNase protection; ADA enzymatic activity and zymogram analysis was conducted as described previously (18Blackburn M.R. Wakamiya M. Caskey C.T. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23891-23894Google Scholar, 19Blackburn M.R. Datta S.K. Wakamiya M. Vartabedian B. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15203-15210Google Scholar). Mice were housed in microisolator cages in a colony free of common murine viruses and pathogens. Tissues of interest were dissected from control and ADA-deficient mice on postnatal day 15. Tissues were rinsed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. Tissues were then dehydrated, cleared, and embedded in paraffin according to established procedures. Sections 7 μm in thickness were collected on positively charged microscope slides and stained with hematoxylin and eosin using a Rapid Chrome staining kit (Shandon). Photographs of sections were generated using an Olympus BX60 microscope with bright field illumination. Analysis of bone using alyzarin red and azure blue was conducted according to established protocols. Determination of lymphoid cell counts in thymuses and spleens were conducted as described previously (19Blackburn M.R. Datta S.K. Wakamiya M. Vartabedian B. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15203-15210Google Scholar). For examination of peripheral lymphocytes, 200 μl of blood was collected from the tail vein of mice directly into EDTA-coated microcentrifuge tubes. Complete blood counts were determined using an H1 analyzer (Technicon Instruments Corp.). For determination of serum immunoglobulins, whole blood was collected by cardiac puncture, allowed to set on ice for 15 min and then centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 × g at 4 °C. Serum was removed and stored at −70 °C until analyzed. Serum immunoglobulin levels were determined using a single radioimmunodiffusion assay (Charles River Laboratories). Direct two-color analysis with antibodies against the cell surface antigens CD3, CD4, CD8, TCR α/β, IgM, and B220 was performed according to established methods (19Blackburn M.R. Datta S.K. Wakamiya M. Vartabedian B. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15203-15210Google Scholar). Tissues were quickly removed from control or ADA-deficient mice and frozen in liquid nitrogen, and nucleosides and nucleotides were extracted and analyzed according to established procedures (18Blackburn M.R. Wakamiya M. Caskey C.T. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23891-23894Google Scholar, 20Knudsen T.B. Winters R.S. Otey S.K. Blackburn M.R. Airhart M.J. Kellems R.E. Teratology. 1992; 45: 91-103Google Scholar, 21Gao X. Blackburn M.R. Knudsen T.B. Teratology. 1994; 49: 1-12Google Scholar). AdoHcy hydrolase enzymatic activity was determined in freshly prepared tissue extracts according to established procedures (19Blackburn M.R. Datta S.K. Wakamiya M. Vartabedian B. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15203-15210Google Scholar). Previous studies suggest that Adaexpression in trophoblast cells of the placenta is critical for fetal development in the mouse (18Blackburn M.R. Wakamiya M. Caskey C.T. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23891-23894Google Scholar, 22Knudsen T.B. Blackburn M.R. Chinskey J.M. Airhart M.J. Kellems R.E. Biol. Reprod. 1991; 44: 171-184Google Scholar). Thus, to generate completely ADA-deficient postnatal mice, an ADA minigene (Fig. 1 A) that targeted expression specifically to the trophoblast lineage (Fig. 1 B) was introduced onto the ADA-deficient background. This was accomplished by intercrossing mice carrying the trophoblast-specific ADA minigene (Tg) with mice heterozygous for the null Ada allele (m1/+). Subsequent intercrosses yielded litters that contained mice harboring the ADA minigene (Tg) that were also homozygous for the nullAda allele (m1/m1) (Fig. 1 D). Given that the regulatory elements used targeted Ada expression only to trophoblasts, once born, and with the loss of the placenta, Tg-m1/m1 mice should lack ADA enzymatic activity. To monitor Adaexpression in rescued mice, control and Tg-m1/m1 mice were sacrificed on postnatal day 15 and ADA enzymatic activity determined in various tissue extracts (Fig. 1 E). ADA enzymatic activity was not observed in any of the tissues examined in Tg-m1/m1 mice. Therefore, expression in trophoblast cells alone was sufficient to rescue ADA-deficient fetuses from perinatal lethality, and provide postnatal mice that were ADA-deficient. ADA-deficient humans fail to thrive and die within the first few months of life if not properly diagnosed and treated (2Hershfield M.S. Mitchell B.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 1. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 1725-1768Google Scholar). ADA-deficient mice generated by trophoblast rescue also fail to thrive and die by approximately 3 weeks of age. Nevertheless, these mice provided us the opportunity to directly assess the effect of ADA deficiency on the thymus and spleen, critical immune organs that are not accessible for analysis in ADA-deficient humans. The status of the immune system in ADA-deficient mice was assessed between postnatal days 15 and 17 prior to a severe decline in health to minimize the influence of physiologic stress on the immune phenotype. Gross examination of the thymus and spleen in ADA-deficient mice revealed a substantial decrease in organ size that corresponded with a greater than 50% reduction in organ-to-body weights (data not shown). Histological analysis revealed a decrease in the size of the thymus (Fig. 2 b) and spleen (Fig. 2 f) of ADA-deficient mice. Examination at a higher magnification showed that there was a decrease in cortical-medullary demarcation in ADA-deficient thymuses, and Hassel's corpuscles were not found (Fig. 2 d). Examination of spleens revealed a decrease in the number of red blood cells found in the red pulp, and few megakaryocytes were observed (Fig. 2 h). Consistent with the decrease in organ size, lymphoid cell counts were substantially reduced in the ADA-deficient thymus (8-fold) and spleen (3-fold) (Fig. 3 A). Lymphopenia was also seen in the peripheral circulation where ADA-deficient mice contained one-third the number of peripheral lymphoid cells seen in control mice (Fig. 3 B). Serum immunoglobulin levels were measured to determine if the humoral branch of the immune system was affected by ADA deficiency. Total serum immunoglobulin levels were reduced 3-fold in ADA-deficient mice (Fig. 3 C), suggesting an immunodeficiency. Because mice were analyzed prior to weaning, it is likely that maternal IgG accounts for most and possibly all of the serum immunoglobulins (23Malanchere E. Huetz F. Coutinho A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 788-793Google Scholar). Therefore, the ability of ADA-deficient mice to produce immunoglobulins is likely to be severely reduced. These data demonstrate that ADA-deficient mice exhibit a combined T and B cell lymphopenia and immunodeficiency.Figure 3ADA-deficient mice exhibit a severe lymphopenia and immunodeficiency. Panel A, lymphoid cell numbers from thymuses and spleens are given as mean cell numbers in millions ± S.E. (n = 7 for control organs (open bars) and n = 6 for ADA-deficient organs (solid bars)). Panel B, peripheral lymphoid cell counts are given as cells/μl blood ± S.E. (n = 29 for control values (open bar) and n = 16 for ADA-deficient values). Panel C, total immunoglobulin levels were measured in the serum of control (open bars) and ADA-deficient (solid bars) mice. Values are given as μg/ml ± S.E. (n = 7 for control mice; n = 6 for ADA-deficient mice). *** represents a significant difference from control values withp > 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It has not been possible to assess the distribution of lymphocyte populations in the immune organs of ADA-deficient humans. To determine whether genetic ADA deficiency leads to alterations in thymic cell populations, flow cytometry was performed on cellular populations from the thymuses of ADA-deficient mice. There were substantial differences in the distribution of thymocytes bearing cell surface antigens specific for different stages of T lymphocyte development. In ADA-deficient thymuses, there was a significant increase in the percentage of CD4−CD8− double-negative immature thymocytes, whereas there was a decrease in the percentage of CD4+CD8+ double-positive thymocytes and CD4+ and CD8+ single-positive thymocytes (Fig. 4 A). These data suggest that developing thymocytes at the transition from the double-negative to double-positive stage are sensitive to the consequences of ADA deficiency. Lymphoid cells from ADA-deficient spleens were examined to determine whether there were alterations in mature lymphoid populations. There was a substantial decrease in the percentage of mature CD4+and CD8+ T lymphocytes in ADA-deficient spleens (Fig. 4 B). An increase in granulocytes and macrophages, eosinophilia, and anemia were also noted in ADA-deficient mice (data not shown), whereas there was not a significant difference in the distribution of splenic cells harboring the B lymphocyte markers IgM or B220 (Fig. 4 B). The decrease in the percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, together with the general T and B cell lymphopenia and hypogammaglobulinemia, suggest that ADA-deficient mice exhibit a combined immunodeficiency. Metabolic disturbances associated with ADA deficiency in humans have only been monitored in fluid and cellular components that are accessible, such as plasma, serum, and urine (2Hershfield M.S. Mitchell B.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 1. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 1725-1768Google Scholar, 24Morgan G. Levinsky R.J. Hugh J.K. Fairbanks L.D. Morris G.S. Simmonds H.A. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1987; 70: 491-499Google Scholar, 25Donofrio J. Coleman M.S. Hutton J. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 62: 884-887Google Scholar). The levels of adenosine and 2′-deoxyadenosine are readily detected in these samples; however, little to nothing is known with regard to the metabolic disturbances in tissues of ADA-deficient individuals. Monitoring metabolic disturbances in the tissues of ADA-deficient mice, in particular immunologic tissues, would provide important information into the mechanism of the immunodeficiency associated with ADA deficiency. To monitor metabolic disturbances in tissues of ADA-deficient mice, animals were sacrificed on postnatal day 15 and various tissues were rapidly collected and processed for nucleoside analysis. Consistent with observations made in ADA-deficient humans, there was a marked accumulation of adenosine (Fig. 5 A) and 2′-deoxyadenosine (Fig. 5 C) in the serum of ADA-deficient mice. Upon examination of various tissues, adenosine levels were found to be elevated in all tissues examined with the greatest accumulation occurring in the liver, kidney, and lung (Fig. 5 B). 2′-Deoxyadenosine was also detected in all ADA-deficient tissues examined with the greatest accumulation occurring in the lymphoid organs (Fig. 5 D). 2′-Deoxyadenosine was elevated more than 500-fold in the thymus to levels greater than 200 times that found in the serum of ADA-deficient mice (Fig. 5 C). These studies demonstrate that there are severe metabolic disturbances in tissues of ADA-deficient mice. The inhibition of AdoHcy hydrolase and the accumulation of dATP are common features monitored in red blood cells of ADA-deficient individuals (2Hershfield M.S. Mitchell B.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 1. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 1725-1768Google Scholar, 16Hershfield M.S. Kredich N.M. Ownby D.R. Ownby H. Buckley R. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 63: 807-811Google Scholar, 26Kaminska J.E. Fox I.H. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1980; 96: 141-147Google Scholar). Disturbances in these pathways have been noted in mice treated with the ADA inhibitor 2′-deoxycoformycin (27Ratech H. Thorbecke G.J. Hirschhorn R. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1981; 21: 119-127Google Scholar); however, nothing is known with regard to the involvement of these toxic pathways in tissues of ADA-deficient individuals. To determine if these metabolic end points were effected in tissues of ADA-deficient mice, AdoHcy hydrolase enzymatic activity and dATP levels were monitored in various tissues (Fig. 6). In red blood cells, it was found that, as in humans, AdoHcy hydrolase activity was inhibited (Fig. 6 A) and dATP accumulated to very high levels (Fig. 6 C). AdoHcy hydrolase enzymatic activity was inhibited in all tissues examined with the greatest degree of inhibition seen in the thymus (85%) and spleen (90%) (Fig. 6 B). dATP levels were increased in all tissues examined (Fig. 5 D). The greatest accumulation of dATP was in red blood cells (Fig. 6 C); however, among other tissues examined, the greatest accumulation (50-fold) was seen in the thymus (Fig. 6 D). Therefore, ADA-deficient mice retain metabolic disturbances associated with ADA deficiency in humans. Moreover, of numerous tissues examined, the most severe metabolic disturbances occur in lymphoid tissues. In addition to a combined immunodeficiency, ADA-deficient humans exhibit pathologic findings including, liver, kidney, adrenal, and bone abnormalities (28Bollinger M.E. Arredondo-Vega F.X. Santisteban I. Schwarz K. Hershfield M.S. Lederman H.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1367-1371Google Scholar, 29Ratech H. Greco A. Gallo G. Rimoin D.L. Kamino H. Hirschhorn R. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 120: 157-169Google Scholar, 30Cederbaum S.D. Kaitila I. Rimoin D.L. Stiehm E.R. J. Pediatr. 1976; 89: 737-742Google Scholar). To determine if there were pathological alterations in nonlymphoid tissues of ADA-deficient mice, tissues were harvested on postnatal day 15 and examined histologically. Severe histological observations were found in the lung of ADA-deficient mice (Fig. 7 b). There was a large increase in the number of inflammatory cells in the lung, together with massive thickening and shedding of airway epithelium and occlusions of the airways with cellular debris and mucus (Fig. 7 b). Consistent with these histological observations, mice began to show signs of tachypnea as early as postnatal day 12, and this labored breathing became increasingly severe up to the death of the animals between days 18 and 22. This severe pulmonary insufficiency is speculated to lead to the death of ADA-deficient mice, and the basis for the lung inflammation is under investigation. Bone abnormalities of the rib cage were also noted in ADA-deficient mice (Fig. 7 c). There was an enlargement of the costochondral junctions, as well as a severe rib curvature (Fig. 7 d). Abnormal pathogenesis was also seen in the kidneys of ADA-deficient mice. Kidneys appeared normal in size but were dark red in comparison to control kidneys, which were pink (data not shown). Histological examination revealed a normal organization in the ADA-deficient kidney; however, there was a substantial increase in red blood cells found in glomeruli and convoluted tubules of ADA-deficient kidneys (Fig. 7 f). These results suggest that ADA-deficient mice exhibit many of the nonlymphoid phenotypes observed in ADA-deficient humans. ADA-deficient fetuses die perinatally in association with profound disturbances in purine metabolism and severe liver damage (8Wakamiya M. Blackburn M.R. Jurecic R. McArthur M.J. Geske R.S. Cartwright J. Mitani K. Vaishnav S. Belmont J.W. Kellems R.E. Finegold M.J. Caskey C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3673-3677Google Scholar, 9Migchielsen A.A.J. Breuer M.L. van Roon M.A. te Riele H. Zurcher C. Ossendorp F. Toutain S. Hershfield M.S. Berns A. Valerio D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 279-287Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that Ada expression in trophoblasts of the placenta is essential for prenatal survival in the mouse (18Blackburn M.R. Wakamiya M. Caskey C.T. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23891-23894Google Scholar). In the current study, we used a transgenic approach to genetically restore ADA specifically to trophoblasts of otherwise ADA-deficient fetuses. Expression of Ada in trophoblasts was sufficient to rescue ADA-deficient fetuses from perinatal lethality, and, with loss of the placenta at birth, rescued mice were found to be completely ADA-deficient. These ADA-deficient mice provided for the first time the opportunity to examine the phenotypic and tissue-specific metabolic disturbances associated with ADA deficiency in postnatal mice. Among the most striking observations made in ADA-deficient mice was a profound T and B cell lymphopenia. Furthermore, levels of serum immunoglobulins were greatly diminished, suggesting these animals suffer from a combined T and B cell deficiency. These features are consistent with the immune phenotype observed in ADA-deficient humans (2Hershfield M.S. Mitchell B.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 1. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 1725-1768Google Scholar). The ability to analyze tissues from ADA-deficient mice, which are not easily attainable in ADA-deficient humans, allowed us to make additional observations regarding the immune phenotype associated with ADA deficiency. In the thymus of ADA-deficient mice, the percentage of CD4−CD8− double-negative immature thymocytes increased, whereas the percentage of CD4+CD8+double-positive thymocytes and CD4+ and CD8+single-positive thymocytes decreased accordingly (Fig. 4 A). This suggests that developing thymocytes are sensitive to the metabolic consequences of ADA deficiency at the transition from the double-negative to double-positive stage. This observation is consistent with those seen in mice treated with the ADA inhibitor 2′-deoxycoformycin (31Doherty P.J. Pan S. Mulloy J.C. Thompson E. Thorner P. Barankiewiecz J. Roifman C.M. Cohen A. Scand. J. Immunol. 1991; 33: 405-410Google Scholar, 32Benveniste P. Cohen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8373-8377Google Scholar). However, the severe reduction in lymphoid cell number in the thymus suggests that there is a general lymphotoxicity associated with ADA deficiency, possibly a block at a prethymic stage of T cell development. The ability to analyze individual tissues also provided novel information into potential metabolic mechanisms that lead to the combined immunodeficiency associated with ADA deficiency. There was a widespread accumulation of adenosine in all tissues examined in ADA-deficient mice, whereas 2′-deoxyadenosine accumulated predominantly in the thymus and spleen (Fig. 5). This suggests that 2′-deoxyadenosine cytotoxicity may be involved in the immunodeficiency observed. 2′-Deoxyadenosine can be cytotoxic to cells by directly inhibiting the enzyme AdoHcy hydrolase (15Hershfield M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 22-25Google Scholar, 16Hershfield M.S. Kredich N.M. Ownby D.R. Ownby H. Buckley R. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 63: 807-811Google Scholar). This inhibition can lead to the accumulation of AdoHcy that in turn functions as an inhibitor of transmethylation reactions that utilize S-adenosylmethionine as a methyl donor (2Hershfield M.S. Mitchell B.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 1. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 1725-1768Google Scholar, 16Hershfield M.S. Kredich N.M. Ownby D.R. Ownby H. Buckley R. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 63: 807-811Google Scholar). AdoHcy has also been shown to modulate Apo-1-mediated apoptosis (35Ullman B. Levinson B.B. Hershfield M.S. Martin Jr., D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 256: 848-852Google Scholar). AdoHcy hydrolase enzymatic activity was inhibited in all tissues examined in ADA-deficient mice with the greatest degree of inhibition occurring in the thymus and spleen (Fig. 6 A). Therefore, disruption of critical transmethylation reactions or induction of apoptosis following AdoHcy hydrolase inhibition may play a key role in the immune phenotype observed. Little is known regarding transmethylation reactions that may be affected; however, it is likely that ADA-deficient mice will serve as a tool to uncover potential transmethylation targets. Accumulation of dATP in red blood cells of ADA-deficient patients has long been used as a benchmark for the severity of this metabolic disorder (2Hershfield M.S. Mitchell B.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 1. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 1725-1768Google Scholar, 14Cohen A. Hirschhorn R. Horowitz S.D. Rubinstein A. Polmar S.H. Hong Martin Jr., D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 472-476Google Scholar, 34Coleman M.S. Donofrio J. Hutton J.J. Hahn L. Daoud A. Lampkin B. Dyminski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1619-1626Google Scholar). Here, we show that dATP is not only elevated in red blood cells of ADA-deficient mice, but in all tissues examined (Fig. 6 B). Levels of dATP in ADA-deficient thymuses and spleens were among the highest measured, suggesting that the phosphorylation of 2′-deoxyadenosine to dATP may play a role in the ensuing immune phenotype. Elevated dATP can interfere with deoxynucleotide metabolism by acting as an allosteric inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, an essential enzyme in the production of deoxynucleotides utilized in DNA synthesis and repair (13Ullman B. Gudas L.J. Cohen A. Martin Jr., D.W. Cell. 1978; 14: 365-375Google Scholar, 14Cohen A. Hirschhorn R. Horowitz S.D. Rubinstein A. Polmar S.H. Hong Martin Jr., D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 472-476Google Scholar, 35Ullman B. Levinson B.B. Hershfield M.S. Martin Jr., D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 256: 848-852Google Scholar, 36Seto S. Carrera C.J. Kubota M. Wasson D.B. Carson D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 377-383Google Scholar). In the case of ADA deficiency, disruption of deoxynucleotide pools may influence lymphocyte proliferation, or their ability to repair DNA, and thus resulting in apoptosis. 2′-Deoxyadenosine-induced apoptosis in thymocytes has been shown to be dependent on expression of the DNA damage checkpoint protein p53 (32Benveniste P. Cohen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8373-8377Google Scholar), suggesting that accumulation of DNA strand breaks may play a role in thymocyte apoptosis associated with ADA deficiency. More recently, it has been demonstrated that dATP is required for the activation of the caspase CPP32 that plays a pivotal role in the apoptotic pathway (37Lui X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Google Scholar). In this manner, dATP accumulation in response to ADA deficiency may directly influence apoptosis in T and B lymphocytes. The existence of an ADA-deficient mouse will allow for further genetic manipulation and biochemical analysis to assess the role of these mechanisms in the immune phenotype associated with ADA deficiency. Both AdoHcy hydrolase inhibition and dATP accumulation correlate with the high levels of 2′-deoxyadenosine seen in the thymus and spleen, suggesting 2′-deoxyadenosine cytotoxicity may be involved with the combined immunodeficiency seen. However, the accumulation of adenosine seen in the thymus and spleen suggests that perturbations in normal adenosine signaling may also play a role in the immune phenotype. Several studies suggests that adenosine signaling is involved in the normal development of the immune system (38Huang S. Apasov S. Koshiba M. Sitkovsky M. Blood. 1997; 90: 1600-1610Google Scholar, 39Apasov S.G. Koshiba M. Chused T.M. Sitkovsky M.V. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5095-5105Google Scholar, 40Resta R. Thompson L.F. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 371-374Google Scholar), and adenosine and adenosine agonists have been shown to induce T cell death in the absence of ADA activity (11Szondy Z. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 877-885Google Scholar, 12Kizaki H. Suzuki K. Tadakuma T. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5280-5284Google Scholar). The expression of adenosine receptors in the developing immune system supports the hypothesis for the involvement of adenosine signaling (41Stehle J.H. Scott A.R. Lee J.J. Weaver D.R. Deeds J.D. Reppert S.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 384-393Google Scholar, 42Puffinbarger N.K. Hansen K.R. Resta R. Laurent A.B. Knudsen T.B. Madara J.L. Thompson L.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1126-1132Google Scholar); however, functional analysis at the cellular and genetic levels are needed to assess the role of adenosine signaling in ADA-deficient immunodeficiency. The fact that ADA-deficient murine fetuses die perinatally (8Wakamiya M. Blackburn M.R. Jurecic R. McArthur M.J. Geske R.S. Cartwright J. Mitani K. Vaishnav S. Belmont J.W. Kellems R.E. Finegold M.J. Caskey C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3673-3677Google Scholar, 9Migchielsen A.A.J. Breuer M.L. van Roon M.A. te Riele H. Zurcher C. Ossendorp F. Toutain S. Hershfield M.S. Berns A. Valerio D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 279-287Google Scholar), whereas ADA-deficient humans do not (2Hershfield M.S. Mitchell B.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 1. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 1725-1768Google Scholar), suggests that there is a significant difference in the requirement for ADA during prenatal stages of murine and human development. This difference is manifested in the high levels of ADA that are found in the murine placenta (22Knudsen T.B. Blackburn M.R. Chinskey J.M. Airhart M.J. Kellems R.E. Biol. Reprod. 1991; 44: 171-184Google Scholar) that do not appear to be present in the human placenta (43Dooley T. Fairbanks L.D. Simmonds H.A. Rodeck C.H. Nicolaides K.H. Soothil P.W. Stewart P. Morgan G. Levinsky R.J. Prenatal Diagn. 1987; 7: 561-565Google Scholar). Despite this prenatal difference, results from this study show that once ADA-deficient fetuses have been rescued from perinatal lethality, the postnatal phenotypes observed are similar to those seen in ADA-deficient children. This similarity extends beyond the combined immunodeficiency to include a pulmonary insufficiency, bone abnormalities, and kidney findings. Many of these observations in humans were made during patient autopsy (29Ratech H. Greco A. Gallo G. Rimoin D.L. Kamino H. Hirschhorn R. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 120: 157-169Google Scholar, 30Cederbaum S.D. Kaitila I. Rimoin D.L. Stiehm E.R. J. Pediatr. 1976; 89: 737-742Google Scholar), making it difficult to establish whether these phenotypes are a primary effect of ADA deficiency or secondary to the immunodeficiency. The metabolic disturbances seen in effected organs suggest that these phenotypes may be a primary consequence of ADA deficiency related to perturbations in adenosine signaling. Although the mechanisms by which the metabolic disturbances lead to tissue damage are still not understood, it is clear that these mice will provide a model system to learn more about pathways involved in the ontogeny of these phenotypes in ADA-deficient mice and humans. In addition, these genetically engineered mice will make possible a wide range of biochemical and immunological experiments that are not permissible in humans, which will be directed at understanding the mechanism and treatment of ADA deficiency. In particular, ADA-deficient mice will aid the advancement of enzyme and gene therapy to ultimately treat this and related disorders in humans.

In contrast, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) potently enhances bone matrix apposition. The rat TGF-beta type I receptor gene promoter contains cis-acting elements for transcription factor CBFa1, which increases in parallel with osteoblast differentiation. Here we present molecular data linking these events. We show that previously unexplained effects of glucocorticoid on bone loss may be mediated in part by suppression of CBFa1, with a resultant decrease in the expression and activity of the TGF-beta type I receptor on matrix-producing bone cells."
https://openalex.org/W2054187948,"The Munc-18-syntaxin 1A complex has been postulated to act as a negative control on the regulated exocytotic process because its formation blocks the interaction of syntaxin with vesicle SNARE proteins. However, the formation of this complex is simultaneously essential for the final stages of secretion as evidenced by the necessity of Munc-18's homologues in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sec1p), Drosophila (ROP), and Caenorhabditis elegans (Unc-18) for proper secretion in these organisms. As such, any event that regulates the interaction of these two proteins is important for the control of secretion. One candidate for such regulation is cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), a member of the Cdc2 family of cell division cycle kinases that has recently been copurified with Munc-18 from rat brain. The present study shows that Cdk5 bound to its neural specific activator p35 not only binds to Munc-18 but utilizes it as a substrate for phosphorylation. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that Munc-18 that has been phosphorylated by Cdk5 has a significantly reduced affinity for syntaxin 1A. Finally, it is shown that Cdk5 can also bind to syntaxin 1A and that a complex of Cdk5, p35, Munc-18, and syntaxin 1A can be fashioned in the absence of ATP and promptly disassembled upon the addition of ATP. These results suggest a model in which p35-activated Cdk5 becomes localized to the Munc-18-syntaxin 1A complex by its affinity for both proteins so that it may phosphorylate Munc-18 and thus permit the positive interaction of syntaxin 1A with upstream protein effectors of the secretory mechanism.

Many of the key proteins involved in membrane targeting and synaptic vesicle neurotransmitter release have been identified, and a fundamental set of interactions has been defined and placed into a model termed the SNARE hypothesis (1Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2559-2563Google Scholar, 2Sollner T. Whiteheart W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-323Google Scholar, 3Sudhof T.C. De Camilli P. Niemann H. Jahn R. Cell. 1993; 75: 1-4Google Scholar, 4Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Google Scholar). Essential to the SNARE hypothesis is the idea that a complex of proteins is formed from soluble cytosolic proteins and from proteins integral to the synaptic vesicle (termed v-SNAREs) and target membranes (termed t-SNAREs). The soluble proteins include the ATPaseN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF) 1The abbreviations used are: NSF,N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase. and a family of proteins necessary for membrane attachment and activation of NSF termed SNAPs (soluble NSF attachmentproteins). The SNAP receptors (i.e. the SNAREs) were identified as synaptic vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP, also termed synaptobrevin), and the plasma membrane proteins syntaxin andsynaptosome-associatedprotein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) (2Sollner T. Whiteheart W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-323Google Scholar, 5Schekman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 587-592Google Scholar). In the SNARE hypothesis, the core of the vesicle docking interaction results from the interaction of v-SNAREs with cognate t-SNAREs via coiled-coil domains to create a protein complex that further recruits cytosolic factors α/β- and γ-SNAP and then NSF to form a 20 S complex. This assemblage of proteins is required for the donor and target membranes to come into close apposition and, upon ATP hydrolysis by NSF, become fusion-competent (4Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Google Scholar, 5Schekman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 587-592Google Scholar). A specialization imposed on the SNARE hypothesis with regard to neurotransmitter and neurohormone release is the strict Ca2+-dependence of release, which necessitates incorporation of a Ca2+ sensor into the fusion machine (1Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2559-2563Google Scholar,3Sudhof T.C. De Camilli P. Niemann H. Jahn R. Cell. 1993; 75: 1-4Google Scholar). Consistent with the SNARE hypothesis, proteins that regulate SNARE complex assembly in either a positive or negative fashion may substantially alter a cell's secretory response. The presence of regulatory proteins is suggested functionally both by the highly controlled nature of neurotransmitter release and by the description of multiple forms of synaptic plasticity that are of presynaptic cause (6Zucker R.S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1989; 12: 13-31Google Scholar). Proteins from two gene families have been identified as key regulators of SNARE complex assembly. These include members of the small GTP-binding family (e.g. Rabs) and of the SEC1 family (7Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 893-897Google Scholar, 8Lupashin V.V. Waters M.G. Science. 1997; 276: 1255-1258Google Scholar). The SEC1 gene is one of 10 genes identified as essential for the final stages of protein secretion in the yeast,Saccharomyces cerevisiae (9Aalto M.K. Ruohonen L. Hosono K. Keranen S. Yeast. 1991; 7: 643-650Google Scholar). Sec1p protein has sequence similarity to three other yeast proteins, Sly1p, Vps33p (Slp1p), and Vps45p, which are also important for vesicle targeting and fusion (10Cowles C.R. Emr S.D. Horazdovsky B.F. J. Cell Science. 1994; 107: 3449-3459Google Scholar). The mammalian homologue of yeast Sec1p was initially identified as a syntaxin-binding protein (Munc-18) (11Hata Y. Slaughter C.A. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 347-351Google Scholar) and independently isolated by two groups and designated n-Sec1 and rbSec1 (12Pevsner J. Hsu S-C. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1445-1449Google Scholar, 13Garcia E.P. Gatti E. Butler M. Burton J. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2003-2007Google Scholar), although they represent identical genes. rbSec1 is expressed in two alternatively spliced isoforms termed rbSec1A and -B, although, no functional differences have been found (14Garcia E.P. McPherson P.S. Chilcote T.J. Takei K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 105-120Google Scholar). Recent reports have demonstrated the existence of at least five additional mammalian Munc-18 homologues, with several forms being expressed ubiquitously (15Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13022-13028Google Scholar, 16Katagiri H. Terasaki J. Murata T. Ishihara H. Ogihara T. Inukai K. Fukushima Y. Anai M. Kikuchi M. Miyazaki J. Yazaki Y. Oka Y. J. Biol.

Sec1p interacts with yeast syntaxins (Sso1p, Sso2p) based on genetic interactions (20Aalto M.K. Ronne H. Keranen S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4095-4104Google Scholar), and Munc-18 has been shown to interact with mammalian syntaxins (11Hata Y. Slaughter C.A. Sudhof T.C.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 353-361Google Scholar) particularly with syntaxin isoforms 1a, 2, and 3 but not with isoforms 4 or 5 (15Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13022-13028Google Scholar, 21Pevsner J. Hsu S-C. Braun J.E.A. Calakos N. Ting A.E. Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 353-361Google Scholar). Munc-18 has not, however, been found to be part of the 20 S SNARE/SNAP/NSF protein assemblage and was thus postulated to be a negative regulator of v- and t-SNARE protein interactions (7Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 893-897Google Scholar, 15Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13022-13028Google Scholar, 21Pevsner J. Hsu S-C. Braun J.E.A. Calakos N. Ting A.E. Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 353-361Google Scholar). Sec1p protein homologues have also been reported to be important for vesicle trafficking. For example, Unc-18 (for uncoordinated) (22Gengyo-Ando K. Kamiya Y. Yamakawa A. Kodaira K.I. Nishiwaki K. Miwa J. Hori I. Hosono R. Neuron. 1993; 11: 703-711Google Scholar) and ROP (for Ras opposite) (23Salzberg A. Cohen N. Halachmi N. Kimchie Z. Lev Z. Development. 1993; 117: 1309-1319Google Scholar) represent neural enriched SEC1 homologues in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila, respectively. Mutation in the unc-18 gene in C. elegans caused abnormal accumulation of acetylcholine and resistance to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (22Gengyo-Ando K. Kamiya Y. Yamakawa A. Kodaira K.I. Nishiwaki K. Miwa J. Hori I. Hosono R. Neuron. 1993; 11: 703-711Google Scholar, 24Hosono R. Hekimi S. Kamiya Y. Sassa T. Murakami S. Nishiwaki K. Miwa J. Taketo A. Kodaira K-I. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 1517-1525Google Scholar), while ROP overexpression in Drosophilareduced the number of spontaneous vesicle fusions in half and significantly decreased evoked responses in response to repetitive stimulation (25Schulze K.L. Littleton J.T. Salzberg A. Halachmi N. Stern M. Lev Z. Bellen H.J. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1099-1108Google Scholar). A separate study has shown a DrosophilaROP mutant to result in reduced light-evoked synaptic responses (26Harrison S.D. Broadie K. van de Goor J. Rubin G.M. Neuron. 1994; 13: 555-566Google Scholar). Recent investigations have found that Munc-18, like SNAP-25 and syntaxin, is not restricted to the synaptic region but distributed throughout the axon and soma, suggesting the possibility of additional actions of Munc-18 protein (14Garcia E.P. McPherson P.S. Chilcote T.J. Takei K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 105-120Google Scholar). Consistent with this possibility, Munc-18 has recently been reported to interact with members of a family of double C2 domain proteins termed DOC2 (27Verhage M. Jan de Vries K. Røshol H. Burbach J.P.H. Gispen W.H. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 453-461Google Scholar) and also with cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5; also termed PSSALRE and Nclk for neuronal Cdc2-likekinase), to which it can be tightly bound (28Shetty K.T. Kaech S. Link W.T. Jaffe H. Flores C.M. Wray S. Pant H.C. Beushausen S. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1988-1995Google Scholar). Cdk5, found in adult neural tissue, phosphorylates neurofilament protein and microtubule-associated tau protein (29Lew J. Qi Z. Huang Q-Q. Paudel H. Matsuura I. Matsushita M. Zhu X. Wang J.H.

Wada E. Battey J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10867-10871Google Scholar). Cdk5 is a proline-directed kinase that can bind cyclin D but in brain is often associated with and activated by a 35-kDa protein (34Lew J. Huang Q-C. Qi Z. Winkfein R. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 423-426Google Scholar). Munc-18 possesses predicted consensus sequences for phosphorylation by protein kinase A, tyrosine kinase, protein kinase C, casein kinase II, and, interestingly, two sites for Cdk5 (12Pevsner J. Hsu S-C. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1445-1449Google Scholar, 35Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Google Scholar). A recent in vitro study demonstrated that phosphorylation by protein kinase C of Munc-18 shifted its binding affinity for recombinant GST-syntaxin fusion protein (36Fujita Y. Sasaki T. Fukui K. Kotani H. Kimura T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Scheller R.H. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7265-7268Google Scholar). The purpose of the present investigation was to define the interactions between Cdk5, Munc-18, and syntaxin that occur at nerve endings and to determine their regulation by Cdk5 kinase activity. Furthermore, we investigated whether Munc-18 is subject to phosphorylation within isolated mammalian secretory nerve endings. Recombinant pGEX plasmid constructs encoding glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, pGEX-kg-Munc-18 (rat), pGEX-syntaxin 1A11 (rat), and pGEX-2T-CDK5 (human) and pGEX-2T-P25 (bovine) were gifts of R. Scheller and J. Wang, respectively. The plasmids were individually transformed into Escherichia coli strain TG-1. The syntaxin construct used throughout was restricted to the cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin 1A. Antibodies used included a mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal anti-Munc18 (Transduction Laboratories), a mouse monoclonal anti-syntaxin (HPC-1, Sigma), a rabbit polyclonal anti-Cdk5 directed against the carboxyl terminus (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), and a rabbit polyclonal COOH-terminally directed anti-p35 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Protein kinase C purified from rat brain (α, β, γ mixture) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology.32PO4 and [γ-32P]ATP radioactive tracers were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Olomoucine and iso-olomoucine were from L. C. Laboratories. Recombinant GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli (TG-1) and subsequently purified by glutathione linked to Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) as described (37Calakos N. Bennett M.K.

Removal of the GST moiety from the purified fusion protein, when necessary, was accomplished by thrombin (human, Sigma) treatment (0.2 NIH unit/μl, 4 h, 22 °C) in phosphate-buffered saline followed by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (175 μg/ml) to inhibit thrombin action, centrifugation, and collection of the supernatant. Expressed fusion proteins were generally used immediately following purification for in vitro protein/protein interactions or protein phosphorylation studies. Induction of appropriate recombinant protein expression and its subsequent purification was verified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining or by Western blotting and probing with specific antibodies. Protein interactions were determined by incubation of syntaxin 1A, Cdk5, p25, and Munc-18 fusion proteins (individually or combinations) with an individual GST fusion protein, which was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. Proteins were incubated in protein binding buffer with end-to-end rotation for 1 h or overnight at 4 °C. Protein binding buffer contained 4 mmHepes/NaOH (pH 7.4), 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 3.5 mm CaCl2, 3.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Following incubation, protein bound to the GST fusion protein was collected by centrifugation of the samples and washed three more times in binding buffer. Controls for each experiment consisted of analysis of fusion protein binding to GST protein alone immobilized on glutathione beads and elimination of binding through inclusion within the reaction of a 2–5-fold molar excess of a GST-free form of the fusion protein. In each case, protein bound on the beads and the final wash supernatant were dissolved in SDS-sample buffer, boiled and subjected to SDS-PAGE, and Western blotted onto nitrocellulose (0.2-μm Protran, Schleicher & Schuell), which was probed with different antibodies. ECL (Amersham Corp.) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, and chemiluminescence was quantitated with a GS-250 Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad) or visualized by x-ray film. The EC50 in saturation binding experiments was defined as half-maximal binding between two proteins with concentrations of the reactants kept below the point where significant nonspecific binding to GST immobilized on beads occurred. Quantitation of protein binding was based on pixel intensity obtained by phosphor imaging as above. To facilitate comparison between experimental determinations, data for each protein concentration were generally expressed as a percentage of the value observed upon binding saturation. Determination and monitoring of Cdk5 kinase activity utilized either purified Cdk5 and p25 fusion proteins or native Cdk5 immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-Cdk5 and protein A-agarose beads (Pierce) from rat brain homogenate. The rat brain sample was prepared by homogenization of whole brain in 5 ml of lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1% Nonidet P-40, 40 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 175 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A. The homogenate was then left on ice for 30 min, after which it was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. A 1-ml aliquot of the resulting supernatant was used for Cdk5 immunoprecipitation after preclearing with 60 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-agarose beads. Protein kinase activity of aliquots of immunoprecipitated protein and Cdk5/p25 fusion protein (1 μm) were determined using a Cdc2 kinase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) by following incorporation of32P radiotracer (0.025 μCi/μl, 3000 Ci/mmol) into a histone H1 peptide (22 μm) from bovine calf thymus containing predicted Cdc2 phosphorylation sites. Incubation of reactants was carried out for 15 min at 30 °C. Labeling was quantitated following reaction termination via binding of the histone substrate to phosphocellulose P81 paper, which was then extensively rinsed in 0.75% phosphoric acid and liquid scintillation-counted. Background controls included no added kinase. Specificity of tracer incorporation to Cdk5 activity was tested by inclusion of protein kinase C inhibitor peptide (RFARKGALRQKNV; 5 μm), protein kinase A inhibitor peptide (TYADFIASGRTGRRNAI; 0.5 μm), and a calmodulin-dependent protein kinase inhibitor (R24571; 5 μm) in the reaction mixture. In addition, kinase activity was tested for sensitivity to the highly specific Cdk5 inhibitor olomoucine (25 μm) or the much less active analog iso-olomoucine (25 μm). Labeled phosphate incorporation into Munc-18 fusion protein by both immunoprecipitated Cdk5 and purified Cdk5/p25 kinase activity was also determined by subjecting reaction samples to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. GST-Munc-18 purified from bacterial lysates by immobilization onto glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads was eluted off the beads in buffer containing 10 mm reduced glutathione and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at room temperature for 10 min. The eluate was then dialyzed (Slide-a-lyzer, Pierce, 10-kDa cut-off) overnight at 4 °C against buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EGTA, 6.25 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm CaCl2. The sample was recovered, and protein concentration was determined (Bio-Rad protein assay). GST-Munc-18 was then phosphorylated with either protein kinase C (0.42 μg/ml) or Cdk5 immunoprecipitated from rat brain according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology). Protein kinase C reactions included Ca2+ (1 mm), phosphatidylserine (83.3 μg/ml), and diglyceride (8.3 μg/ml) activators along with a protein kinase A inhibitor peptide (R24571, 3.3 μm). Phosphate incorporation was determined by inclusion of [γ-32P]ATP radiotracer (0.017–0.025 μCi/μl, 3000 Ci/mmol) during the kinase reaction, which was followed by SDS-PAGE, extraction of the Munc-18 protein band from the gel, and liquid scintillation counting of each sample. Analysis of effects of Munc-18 phosphate incorporation on binding to syntaxin 1A were performed using nonradioactive ATP and by rebinding phosphorylated Munc-18 to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (1 h, room temperature) following the kinase reaction. The glutathione-Sepharose-linked GST-Munc-18 was then centrifuged and washed extensively with protein binding buffer. The phosphorylated Munc-18 fusion protein at a concentration of 200 nm was next incubated with increasing concentration of syntaxin 1A11 fusion protein with rotational agitation for 30 min at 4 °C in protein binding buffer. Following incubation, samples were centrifuged, pellets were extensively washed, and protein was bound to beads solubilized in SDS-sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotted. Blots were probed with monoclonal anti-syntaxin followed with a horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody. Immunoreactive syntaxin bound to GST-Munc-18 was visualized with ECL and quantitated by phosphor imaging analysis. Nonphosphorylated Munc-18 incubated with syntaxin 1A served as control. GST alone was not phosphorylated by the above kinases, and no Cdk5 phosphorylation consensus sequences occur in syntaxin 1A11. Over the concentration range examined, no binding of GST to syntaxin 1A11 was observed. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5- and Munc-18 protein-specific antibodies were used on immunoblots to demonstrate localization of the respective proteins within lysates of the mammalian neurohypophysis (i.e. neural lobe). Immunoreactivity within the lysates was found to comigrate with immunoreactivity to the respective recombinant bacterially expressed GST fusion proteins for Cdk5 or Munc-18 that had been thrombin-digested to release the GST moiety (Fig. 1 A). Further localization of Cdk5 and Munc-18 to nerve endings was demonstrated by their continued presence in a preparation of purified isolated nerve endings (>90% peptidergic nerve endings) termed neurosecretosomes. Both Munc-18 and Cdk5 antibody were also capable of immunoprecipitating the respective proteins from neural lobe homogenates. To evaluate a potential interaction between Munc-18 and Cdk5, we next utilized GST-Munc-18 fusion protein attached to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads in an in vitro binding assay that included neural lobe lysate. Incubation of the GST-Munc-18 bead complex at increasing concentration with the nerve ending lysate was followed by collection and extensive washing of the pellet to remove unbound protein and then elution and analysis by Western blotting of bound Cdk5. Binding of Cdk5 was found to be saturable with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 0.89 μm, as determined by analysis of quantitative phosphor imaging of immunoreactivity (Fig. 1 B). Specificity of binding was demonstrated by lack of binding of Cdk5 to GST protein adhered to glutathione-Sepharose 4B when used at a concentration corresponding to the highest used for GST-Munc-18 protein. Carryover of free Cdk5 was unlikely, since analysis of the final wash supernatants exhibited no detectable Cdk5 immunoreactivity. Analysis of the amount of Cdk5 remaining within the supernatant following incubation demonstrated that even at saturating concentrations of GST-Munc-18, at most only approximately 50% of the total Cdk5 immunoreactivity within a sample was bound. Catalytically active Cdk5 purified from bovine brain extracts exists as a heterodimer of Cdk5 and a regulatory and neural specific subunit termed p25 (34Lew J. Huang Q-C. Qi Z. Winkfein R. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 423-426Google Scholar, 39Lew J. Beaudette K. Litwin C.M. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13383-13390Google Scholar). Subsequent reports on a bovine cDNA clone for the 25-kDa Cdk5 activator protein have revealed that it is derived from a larger 35-kDa protein precursor, suggesting that the native form of the heterodimer consists of Cdk5 and a 35-kDa protein, although the p25 fragment was found fully competent for Cdk5 activation (29Lew J. Qi Z. Huang Q-Q. Paudel H. Matsuura I. Matsushita M. Zhu X. Wang J.H. Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16: 263-270Google Scholar, 34Lew J. Huang Q-C. Qi Z. Winkfein R. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 423-426Google Scholar). We therefore attempted to determine if the Cdk5 bound to the GST-Munc-18 fusion protein following incubation with the neural lobe lysate also contained the p35/p25 activator protein. Analysis of immunoblots demonstrated both Cdk5 and p35 immunoreactivity in washed glutathione-Sepharose 4B GST-Munc-18 pellets that had previously been incubated with the nerve ending lysate (Fig. 2 A). In additional experiments, Cdk5 was directly immunoprecipitated from neural lobe lysate and washed extensively, and the precipitate and final wash were analyzed for p35 immunoreactivity. Fig. 2 B demonstrates the presence of p35 along with Cdk5 in the precipitate, but not the final wash, demonstrating that a Cdk5 and p35 interaction was present within the nerve ending lysate. Complementary experiments in which p35 was immunoprecipitated from the neural lobe lysate and the precipitate was probed for Cdk5 and p35 immunoreactivity resulted in a similar conclusion (Fig. 2 C). Comparison of the Cdk5 with the p35 immunoprecipitation data demonstrated a heterodimer complex of p35 and Cdk5 proteins with p35 being of limited abundance. Further studies were therefore performed to determine if formation of a heterodimer protein complex was required prior to interaction of Cdk5 with Munc-18. Initial experiments found that preincubation of lysate of the neural lobe with recombinant p25 (3 μm for 1 h at 4 °C) increased by 33% from control (i.e. no added p25) the binding during a subsequent incubation (1 h at 4 °C) of lysate Cdk5 to GST-Munc-18 (10 μm). These data indicate that the level of Cdk5 bound to Munc-18 was, in part, determined by available p25 and its interaction with Cdk5. No direct interaction between recombinant p25 and Munc-18 proteins has been found (see below). We next investigated whether the enhanced Cdk5/GST-Munc-18 interaction was a direct result of p25 interaction with Cdk5 or resulted from p25 activation of kinase activity and was therefore ATP-dependent. To test these possibilities, the effects of p25 fusion protein (0.25 μm; soluble p35 has not been expressed successfully in bacteria) and ATP on the binding interaction between Cdk5 (0.25 μm) and GST-Munc-18 (0.25 μm) fusion proteins in vitro were determined. As shown in Fig. 2 D, the addition of recombinant p25 resulted in no significant enhancement of the interaction between Cdk5 and GST-Munc-18. In comparison, the addition of ATP (1 mm) together with the recombinant p25 protein resulted in a significant (p < 0.05, n = 6) enhancement of Cdk5 bound to the washed glutathione-Sepharose 4B-linked GST-Munc-18 compared with the Cdk5 alone control. These data are consistent with an increase in the level of interaction resulting from conditions that support formation of the active heterodimer kinase (i.e. the presence of p25 or p35 and ATP) and increased substrate turnover. Thus, the increased binding of Cdk5 to Munc-18 in the neural lobe lysate supplemented with recombinant p25 probably resulted from an increased formation of heterotrimer complex and the presence of ATP in the lysate. Munc-18 possess consensus phosphorylation sequences for a variety of protein kinases including two (Ser158, Thr574) for the proline-directed kinase Cdk5. Cdk5 immunoprecipitated from nerve ending lysates demonstrated enzymatic activity as measured by labeled phosphate incorporation into a histone peptide (Fig. 3 A). Phosphorylation activity was inhibited by 73% (mean, n= 3) by the specific Cdk5 inhibitor olomoucine (25 μm; reported IC50 = 3 μm (39Lew J. Beaudette K. Litwin C.M. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13383-13390Google Scholar)). A less active olomoucine analog, iso-olomoucine (IC50 > 1 mm) was found to have limited inhibitory effects (∼15%) on the immunoprecipitated kinase activity. Protein A-agarose beads alone following incubation with the neural lobe lysate served as control samples and demonstrated low kinase activity of nonspecifically adhered proteins. Of particular interest is whether Munc-18 may serve as a phosphorylation substrate for Cdk5 and if a phosphorylation event may serve to regulate the strength of the interaction between Munc-18 and syntaxin. To evaluate these possibilities, we incubated GST-Munc-18 fusion prot"

A 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical intermediate produced by the activase has been suggested as the species that abstracts the pro-S hydrogen of the glycine 734 residue in PFL (Frey, M., Rothe, M., Wagner, A. F. V., and Knappe, J. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 12432–12437). To enable mechanistic investigations of this system we have worked out a convenient large scale preparation of functionally competent PFL activase from its apoform. The previously inferred metallic cofactor was identified as redox-interconvertible polynuclear iron-sulfur cluster, most probably of the [4Fe-4S] type, according to UV-visible and EPR spectroscopic information. Cys → Ser replacements by site-directed mutagenesis determined Cys-29, Cys-33, and Cys-36 to be essential to yield active holoenzyme. Gel filtration chromatography showed a monomeric structure (28 kDa) for both the apoenzyme and holoenzyme form. The iron-sulfur cluster complement proved to be a prerequisite for effective binding of adenosylmethionine, which induces a characteristic shift of the EPR signal shape of the reduced enzyme form ([4Fe-4S]+) from axial to rhombic symmetry. The glycyl radical (Gly-734) contained in the active form of pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL) of Escherichia coli is generated by the S-adenosylmethionine-dependent pyruvate formate-lyase-activating enzyme (PFL activase). A 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical intermediate produced by the activase has been suggested as the species that abstracts the pro-S hydrogen of the glycine 734 residue in PFL (Frey, M., Rothe, M., Wagner, A.

Pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL) 1The abbreviations used are: PFL, pyruvate formate-lyase; PFL activase, pyruvate formate-lyase-activating enzyme; RNR, ribonucleotide reductase; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; DTT, dithiothreitol; Mops, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. is a key enzyme of the anaerobic glucose fermentation in Escherichia coli and other microorganisms, catalyzing the CoA-dependent cleavage of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and formate (1Knappe J. Sawers G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 75: 383-398Google Scholar). In its active form, this enzyme contains a stable glycyl radical (Gly-734) required for catalysis (2Wagner A.F.V. Frey M. Neugebauer F.A. Schäfer W. Knappe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 996-1000Google Scholar). Studies of mutants and substrate analogs propose that on substrate binding, the spin is transferred from Gly-734 to the reaction center (Cys-418/Cys-419), where a thiyl radical initiates the homolytic cleavage of the pyruvate C–C bond (3Knappe J. Elbert S. Frey M. Wagner A.F.V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 731-734Google Scholar, 4Parast C.V. Wong K.K. Lewisch S.A. Kozarich J.W. Peisach J. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2393-2399Google Scholar). The PFL radical is produced post-translationally by abstraction of the Hsi atom from the Gly-734 methylene group (5Frey M. Rothe M. Wagner A.F.V. Knappe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12432-12437Google Scholar). This occurs by the action of pyruvate formate-lyase-activating enzyme (PFL activase), which employs adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) and dihydroflavodoxin (or artificial 1e− donors) as co-substrates, yielding 5′-deoxyadenosine and methionine as stoichiometric co-products (Equation 1).[-NH-CH2-CO-]+AdoMet+e−→[-NH-CH-CO-]+5′­deoxyadenosine+MetEquation 1 Because the abstracted H atom is recovered in the 5′-CH3 of deoxyadenosine, a 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical intermediate has been proposed as the actual H abstracting species in this system. How this nucleoside radical is generated from AdoMet is an intriguing problem, requiring in the first place PFL activase to be fully characterized at the molecular level. Previous work has identified PFL activase as a monomer of 28 kDa, and its primary structure, as deduced from the DNA-nucleotide sequence (246 amino acids), has been established by N- and C-terminal amino acid sequencing (6Conradt H. Hohmann-Berger M. Hohmann H.-P. Blaschkowski H.P. Knappe J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 133-142Google Scholar, 7Rödel W. Plaga W. Frank R. Knappe J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 151-158Google Scholar). The enzyme has long since been recognized to require Fe2+ for catalytic activity (6Conradt H. Hohmann-Berger M. Hohmann H.-P. Blaschkowski H.P. Knappe J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 133-142Google Scholar), and iron contents in the order of one iron/polypeptide chain were determined in purified preparations (3Knappe J. Elbert S. Frey M. Wagner A.F.V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 731-734Google Scholar, 8Wong K.K. Murray B.W. Lewisch S.A. Baxter M.K. Ridky T.W. Ulissi-DeMario L. Kozarich J.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14102-14110Google Scholar). Only more recently, an iron-sulfur cluster has been reported in anaerobically purified enzyme (9Broderick J.B. Duderstadt R.E. Fernandez D.C. Wojtuszewski K. Henshaw T.F. Johnson M.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 7396-7397Google Scholar). Previously, a [4Fe-4S] cluster had been identified in the analogous activating protein of anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) (10Ollagnier S. Mulliez E. Gaillard J. Eliasson R. Fontecave M. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9410-9416Google Scholar). We report here a new procedure for the isolation of larger quantities of PFL activase from overproducing E. coli cells. The enzyme was carried through the apoform and reconstituted in vitrowith Fe2+ and sulfide. The holoenzyme form obtained has full catalytic activity under modified assay conditions that omit the previous free Fe2+ supplement. UV-visible and EPR spectroscopic data indicate that the metal center comprises a redox-interconvertible [4Fe-4S] cluster, which is essential for the interaction of the enzyme with AdoMet. In addition, single Cys → Ser mutations were performed that corroborate that the cysteinyl residues in the Cys-Xaa3-Cys-Xaa2-Cys motif of the N-terminal polypeptide section, proposed previously as metal interaction site (7Rödel W. Plaga W. Frank R. Knappe J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 151-158Google Scholar), are essential for reconstituting enzyme activity. Our data place PFL activase, together with the AdoMet-dependent activating protein of anaerobic RNR (11Reichard P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 81-85Google Scholar), into a new subclass of iron-sulfur proteins that generate glycyl radicals in free radical enzymes. Pyruvate formate-lyase (nonradical form) was prepared by previous procedures (2Wagner A.F.V. Frey M. Neugebauer F.A. Schäfer W. Knappe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 996-1000Google Scholar, 6Conradt H. Hohmann-Berger M. Hohmann H.-P. Blaschkowski H.P. Knappe J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 133-142Google Scholar). High potential iron-sulfur protein from Ectothiorhodospira halophila was available in the laboratory. [8-14C]Adenosylmethionine was prepared enzymatically as described in Ref. 5Frey M. Rothe M. Wagner A.F.V. Knappe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12432-12437Google Scholar using [8-14C]ATP from Amersham-Buchler. AdoMet, S-adenosylhomocysteine, catalase, DNase I, and RNase were from Boehringer Mannheim; Q-Sepharose FF, Sephadex G-25 fine, Superdex 75 HR, and Ultrogel AcA44 were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.; Polymin G35 was from BASF AG (Ludwigshafen, Germany). E. coli strain 234M1 (2Wagner A.F.V. Frey M. Neugebauer F.A. Schäfer W. Knappe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 996-1000Google Scholar), a MC4100 derivative carrying the Cmr gene inserted into the chromosomal act gene, was used as host for the overproduction of activase proteins (wild type or mutants). The parental expression plasmid pXA-1 contained the act gene encompassing the 1-kilobase pair DNA fragment comprising nucleotides 2529–3541 in the sequence (7Rödel W. Plaga W. Frank R. Knappe J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 151-158Google Scholar) linked to the Tac promotor of pKK223–3 (Pharmacia). This construct differs from the earlier pKE-1 (5Frey M. Rothe M. Wagner A.F.V. Knappe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12432-12437Google Scholar) by deleting 0.4 kilobase pairs of the act downstream region. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the phosphorothioate method (12Sayers J.R. Eckstein F. McPherson M.J. Directed Mutagenesis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1991: 49-69Google Scholar) using the Sculptor™ in vitro mutagenesis system (RPN 1526, Amersham) according to the supplier's manual. This comprised single Ser substitutions of the six Cys residues: TGT codons (for Cys in amino acid positions 12, 36, and 102) and TGC codons (for Cys in amino acid positions 29, 33, and 94) were mutated to TCT and TCC codons, respectively, by using 24–30-mer antisense mutagenic oligonucleotides that were synthesized by R. Frank (Zentrum für Molekulave Biologie, Heidelberg, Germany). All mutant genes were proof sequenced. The reaction mixtures (0.5 ml) for PFL conversion to the radical form contained in general: 0.15 mTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m KCl, 5 mm DTT, 10 mm potassium oxamate, 0.2 mm AdoMet, 50 μm 5-deazariboflavin, 1 μm riboflavin, 10 μg of catalase, 60 μg (340 pmol) of PFL, and 0.1–2 μg of the activase sample. A slide projector light was used for continuous photoreduction of deazaflavin, and reactions were run at 30 °C under argon, usually for 10 min. In the assay version termed “holoactivase assay” (see “Results”), the reaction mixture contained additionally 10 μm EDTA, and the reaction was started with the activase sample. In the “standard assay,” which was used to determine intact activase together with iron center defective enzyme forms, the reaction mixture contained additionally 0.2 mmFe(NH4)2(SO4)2 (and optionally 0.1 mm Na2S) and was preincubated, in the presence of activase, in the dark for 20 min; the reaction was started by illumination. The produced radical form of PFL was determined by activity measurement (coupled optical assay with a 5–10-μl aliquot); 35 IU correspond to 1 nmol of PFL dimer containing one Gly radical. One unit of activase activity was defined to produce 1 nmol of the PFL radical/min. (Activity data reported here are lower by a factor of 700 when compared with those in previous work (6Conradt H. Hohmann-Berger M. Hohmann H.-P. Blaschkowski H.P. Knappe J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 133-142Google Scholar), which used a different unit definition. Protein concentrations of purified apoenzyme solutions were determined by the 280-nm absorption using a 1 mg/ml value of 1.38 (as calculated from the Trp and Tyr residues in the polypeptide and verified by amino acid analysis). On reconstituted enzyme and other enzyme fractions, the Bradford assay (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) or a biuret procedure, preceded by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, was employed; these assays were standardized against apoenzyme. For quantitation of polypeptides or enzyme concentrations we used the protein values and the molecular mass of 28.1 kDa. Iron was determined according to Ref. 14Makino T. Kiyonaga M. Kina K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1988; 171: 19-28Google Scholar, and sulfide was determined according to Ref.15King T.E. Morris R.O. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 10: 634-641Google Scholar. E. coli 234M1/pXA-1 cells were grown in LB medium with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 30 °C under aeration, maintaining pH 7 by addition of 5 n KOH. Cells were harvested at the transition to the stationary growth phase (A550 = 4.8) and frozen in liquid nitrogen (yield = 5 g/liter). Purification of the enzyme was made at 0–6 °C, except for the Q-Sepharose step. Buffer solutions were previously degassed and flushed with argon, but column operations were not strictly anoxic. Enzyme fractions collected were stored under argon. A 50-g portion of cell paste was suspended in 100 ml of 50 mm Mops/KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. After sonication, DNase I (1 mg) and RNase (1 mg) were added, and the sample was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant (138 ml, 45 mg of protein/ml) was adjusted to pH 7.5 and 31 ml of 1% (w/v) PolyminG35 (neutralized with H2SO4) were added during 60 min of stirring; the precipitate was discarded. The enzyme solution was then chromatographed on a column of Ultrogel AcA44 (20 cm2 × 85 cm) with 50 mm Mops/KOH, pH 7.5, 0.1 m KCl, 5 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm EDTA (flow rate = 5 cm/h). The brown-red fractions containing activase activity, which eluted between 0.75 and 0.85 column volumes, were concentrated by ultrafiltration on a Amicon PM-10 membrane (32 ml, 25 mg/ml). For final chromatographic purification with simultaneous removal of protein-bound iron, we used Q-Sepharose FF (20 cm2 × 9 cm). The column was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-phosphate (KH2PO4 titrated with Tris base), pH 8.0, containing 5 mm DTT and 1 mm EDTA and was operated at 25 °C. A 490-mg portion of the AcA44 fraction, previously gel filtered into the same buffer and warmed to 25 °C, was applied at a flow rate of 12 cm/h. After a wash with 450 ml of the starting buffer, 90 mm Tris-phosphate pH 8.0 (with DTT and EDTA as before) was applied, which eluted the apoactivase as a symmetric protein peak (275 ml), whereas the iron-based color remained column-bound. The colorless solution was concentrated (in the cold) over a PM-10 membrane, then gel filtered into 50 mmMops/KOH, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 m KCl, 5 mmDTT, and 0.1 mm ETDA (18 ml, 8.7 mg/ml). Long term storage was at −70 °C. Analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% gel) showed the 28-kDa band of PFL activase (6Conradt H. Hohmann-Berger M. Hohmann H.-P. Blaschkowski H.P. Knappe J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 133-142Google Scholar, 7Rödel W. Plaga W. Frank R. Knappe J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 151-158Google Scholar) in addition to a few minor bands comprising ≤5% of the total protein. The same protocols (but down-scaled) of bacterial growth and isolation as apoenzyme were applied for C12S, C29S, C33S, C36S, and C102S mutant enzymes. The C94S mutant was carried only to the Ultrogel AcA44 stage (protein purity = 85%). Samples of holoenzyme were prepared in batches up to 20 ml composed of 50 mm Mops/KOH, pH 7.5, 0.1 m KCl, 0.1 m mercaptoethanol, 1 mg (36 nmol) of apoprotein/ml, 0.2 mm Na2S, and 0.25 mmFe(NH4)2(SO4)2. Prior to the addition of iron, the mixture was purged with argon and cooled to 0 °C; Fe2+ was admixed from an anaerobic 10 mm stock solution. Incubation was performed routinely for 10 h. With protein concentrations of ≤0.1 mg/ml (see Fig. 1), reconstitution was complete within 5 min. For analyses of the iron center, reconstitution mixtures were gel filtered anaerobically at 2 °C through Sephadex G-25 columns into 50 mm Mops/KOH, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 m KCl, 10 mm mercaptoethanol, and 10 μg/ml of catalase. The sample size was 0.1 column vol. and the protein fraction collected between 0.38 and 0.51 column vol.; excessive free iron appeared at >0.65 column vol. Concentrations up to 15 mg/ml (for EPR spectra) were made by ultrafiltration. The greenish brown colored solutions were stored in closed tubes under argon at 0 or −70 °C, conditions under which the holoactivase activity was stable for days and several weeks, respectively. UV-visible spectra were recorded anoxically, using septum-sealed cells (type 117, Hellma, Müllheim, Germany). EPR first derivative spectra (5–10 accumulations) were recorded with a Bruker ESP 300 X-band spectrometer (9.50 GHz), using a continuous flow helium cryostat (ESR 900, Oxford Instruments) in a temperature range from 4 to 80 K. The microwave frequency and the magnetic field were measured with a frequency counter and a Gaussmeter, respectively. Recording conditions are indicated in the legends to Figs. 6 and 8. Samples (0.2 ml) with 0.5 mm enzyme were filled into 0.36-cm quartz tubes under argon and stored in liquid nitrogen. Spin quantification was performed by comparing the double integrals of the activase sample and the [4Fe-4S]3+ cluster of E. halophila of known concentration determined for nonsaturating conditions.Figure 8EPR spectra of dithionite-reduced PFL activase incubated with AdoMet (A) orS-adenosylhomocysteine (B).Dithionite-reduced holoenzyme (Fig. 6) was preincubated for 3 min with AdoMet (1 mm) for spectrum A orS-adenosylhomocysteine (1 mm) for spectrum B. The recording conditions were: temperature, 20 K; microwave power, 20 mW; other parameters as in Fig. 6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the apparent molecular weight of holoactivase, a 100-μl sample (0.1 mg) of the reconstitution mixture was gel chromatographed on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 that was preequilibrated and operated (at ambient temperature) with anoxic buffer composed of 50 mm Mops/KOH, pH 7.5, 0.15m KCl, 10 mm mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm Fe2+, and 0.05 mm sulfide (flow rate = 0.4 ml/min). The eluate was monitored for protein (280 nm) and holoactivase activity (see Fig. 3). For the apoenzyme sample monitored at 280 nm, the column was run with anoxic buffer that lacked Fe2+ and sulfide. Proteins for column calibration were bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, carbonic anhydrase, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and cytochrome c. The centrifuged column procedure (16Penefsky H.S. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 56: 527-530Google Scholar) for separating enzyme-bound and free small molecules was used to monitor binding of [14C]AdoMet to various activase forms. Bio-Spin columns (Bio-Rad) in which the plastic support was replaced by a glass fiber disc (GF-C, Whatman) were employed with a 1-ml filling of Sephadex G-25 fine (Pharmacia), which was equilibrated with anaerobic buffer composed of 50 mmMops/KOH, pH 7.5, 0.15 m KCl, and 30 mmmercaptoethanol. The experiments were carried out in the cold room (4 °C), using a swing bucket table top centrifuge. After precentrifugation at 380 × g for 30 s, which displaced 400 μl of buffer, a 150-μl sample of the enzyme-[14C]AdoMet mixture was applied, and the centrifugation was run as before. The effluent (155–160 μl) was analyzed for radioactivity and protein content. The total amount of enzyme-bound AdoMet (see Fig. 7) was estimated from the effluent radioactivity with accountancy of the protein recovery, which was typically 42%. To study the molecular properties of wild-type and mutant forms of PFL activase, we overproduced the protein in the E. coli act null strain 234M1 carrying the expression vector pXA-1, wherein the actgene is under control of the Tac promoter. Optimal yields of activase protein, amounting to 15% of the soluble protein fraction, were obtained by aerobic cell growth in LB medium at 30 °C. Glucose/minimal medium, at aerobic or anaerobic conditions, proved unsuitable because this produced the enzyme chiefly deposited in inclusion bodies. Two protocols were used to assay PFL activase activity via the production of the radical form of PFL. In the first protocol, which has been used in previous work (6Conradt H. Hohmann-Berger M. Hohmann H.-P. Blaschkowski H.P. Knappe J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 133-142Google Scholar, 8Wong K.K. Murray B.W. Lewisch S.A. Baxter M.K. Ridky T.W. Ulissi-DeMario L. Kozarich J.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14102-14110Google Scholar) and will be termed now standard assay, free Fe2+ (0.2 mm) is contained in the DTT-based anaerobic reaction mixture, which is preincubated (20 min) before initiating the reaction by photoreduced 5-deazaflavin. We recognized during our present work that both the intact enzyme and iron center-defective or -deficient enzyme forms are measured by this procedure. The native iron center is readily restored during preincubation, with the DTT reagent furnishing the sulfide source. To assay specifically the intact enzyme, we turned to a modified protocol, termed holoactivase assay, that omits free Fe2+ from the reaction mixture and starts the reaction by the activase sample. In both assay versions, oxamate, replacing the physiological pyruvate, was present as the effector compound required for the PFL activation process (17Knappe J. Blaschkowski H.P. Gröbner P. Schmitt T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 50: 253-263Google Scholar). It should be noted that oxamate or pyruvate are allosteric ligands to the nonradical form of PFL, not to the activating enzyme. Table I summarizes our experimental strategy that led finally to 20-mg quantities of homogeneous PFL activase with a virtually full complement of the native iron center. As in previous work (5Frey M. Rothe M. Wagner A.F.V. Knappe J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12432-12437Google Scholar, 6Conradt H. Hohmann-Berger M. Hohmann H.-P. Blaschkowski H.P. Knappe J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 133-142Google Scholar), the high speed centrifuged cell extract was first subjected to molecular sieve chromatography on Ultrogel AcA44, where the enzyme elutes, after 0.8 column volume, in fractions displaying a red-brown color. At this stage, the protein purity, estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, is about 50%. The fraction of intact enzyme molecules, determined by the two activase assays, is only about 0.1, compared with a value of 0.5 at the cell extract stage. EDTA (0.1 mm) was routinely included in the column buffer, which was not rigorously made anoxic; this probably caused substantial degradation of the native iron center. The spectral properties (see below) suggest that the iron content of the AcA44 prep is largely due to inactive [3Fe-4S] clusters.Table IPreparation of functionally competent PFL activase by isolation of apoenzyme and chemical Fe-S center reconstitutionPurification stepProteinContentSpecific activityIronSulfideHoloactivase assayStandard assaymgnmol/mgunits/mgCentrifuged extract1-aFrom 30 g of packed cells.37004.38.6Ultrogel AcA444901629433Q-Sepharose (apoenzyme)160≤0.2≤0.4060Reconstituted holoenzyme1-bReconstitution was performed on 20-mg batches. as prepared6060 gelfiltered928846601-a From 30 g of packed cells.1-b Reconstitution was performed on 20-mg batches. Open table in a new tab Various standard anion-exchange columns, which we tested for further purification, proved unsatisfactory because of low recoveries and separation into subfractions. Therefore we turned to removal of any protein-bound iron as a first step. Although standard metal chelators proved generally suitable, the optimal method was finally found in using a Q-Sepharose column that is operated with 50 mmphosphate buffer, pH 8, at a temperature of 25 °C. The iron center is disintegrated upon enzyme adsorption to this column, and the virtually homogeneous apoenzyme can be eluted subsequently by a single elution step with 90 mm phosphate. The isolation protocol is described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the purification analysis is shown in Fig. 1. Through monitoring the appearance of holoactivase activity, the native iron center was then found to become rapidly reconstructed by anaerobic incubation of the apoenzyme, at pH 7.5 and 0 °C, with Fe2+ and S2−. With 2-mercaptoethanol in place of dithiothreitol as protective thiol reagent in the reconstitution mixture, the sulfide requirement was total (Fig. 2), thus immediately demonstrating a polynuclear Fe-S cluster in the catalytically competent enzyme form. The specific activity values of reconstituted enzyme were in the range of 60 ± 5 units/mg. This calculates the turnover number to be 1.7 min−1 at assay conditions with 0.7 μm PFL (Km = 1.4 μm) or 5 min−1at a saturating PFL concentration. It is interesting to note that the presence of up to 5 mm EDTA in the holoactivase assay mixture does not impair the catalytic efficiency within the usual reaction period of 10 min. Reconstituted enzyme alone, however, is quite labile against EDTA (see below). To structurally characterize the functional competent enzyme form, we determined in the first place its molecular size using a calibrated Superdex-75 column. Holoactivase activity migrated as a single band, together with the principal protein band, according to 25 ± 1 kDa (Fig. 3). For the apoenzyme (data not shown) the molecular size was found to be 23 ± 1 kDa. These values compare with the sequence-deduced molecular mass of the polypeptide of 28.1 kDa (7Rödel W. Plaga W. Frank R. Knappe J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 151-158Google Scholar), indicating that activase is monomeric with or without the Fe-S complement. On Superdex-75 chromatography, which was operated with anaerobic reconstitution medium containing iron and sulfide, the recovery of holoactivase activity was routinely ≥95%. However, yields dropped to ≤10% when free Fe2+ and sulfide was omitted from the running buffer, even at 4 °C column operation. The residual activity was again found exclusively in the fractions corresponding to a monomeric size. Removal of excessive ligand components contained in the reconstitution mixture without damaging the Fe-S center proved technically difficult and has as yet been accomplished only partially. With Sephadex G25 columns run at 4 °C with anaerobic Mops buffer, pH 7.5 (see “Experimental Procedures”), activase preparations were obtained that showed activity values from 40 to 50 units/mg in the holoactivase assay and about 60 units/mg in the standard assay. Iron and sulfide contents were determined in such samples to be 2.6 ± 0.2 iron/polypeptide chain and 2.5 ± 0.2 sulfur/polypeptide chain. Taken that the deficiency of holoactivase activity is due to partial loss of the iron-sulfur center, a content of 3.3 ± 0.3 iron and 3.2 ± 0.3 sulfide/polypeptide would result for the fully complemented enzyme. In SG25 gel filtered enzyme samples stored under argon at 0 °C, the functionally competent Fe-S cluster, as monitored by the holoactivase activity, proved to be totally stable for at least several days. However, exposure to air under slight agitation destroyed the activity with a half-time of about 2 min. Likewise, incubation with metal chelators under anaerobic conditions caused rapid inactivation, the half-life with 0.3 mm EDTA being 5 min. Gel filtered holoenzyme samples, which are greenish brown in color, showed a UV-visible spectrum (Fig. 4) comprising a prominent 280 nm peak followed by a shoulder at 320 nm and a broad peak at 370–420 nm, with extensions of the absorbance to wavelengths >600 nm, which is typical for Fe-S proteins containing [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters. The difference spectrum of holo versus apoenzyme calculates absorption coefficients for iron at maximum wavelengths of 310 and 420 nm to be 5.3 and 3.8 mm−1 cm−1, respectively. These spectral data closely match those reported for [Fe4S4(SEt)4]2− (18DePamphilis B.V. Averill B.A. Herskovitz T. Que Jr., L. Holm R.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1974; 96: 4159-4167Google Scholar) but are different from those for [Fe2S2(SEt)4]2−(19Hagen K.S. Watson A.D. Holm R.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 3905-3913Google Scholar). Addition of ≥0.1 mm dithionite (≥5-fold excess) reduced the 420-nm absorption by 45% (Fig. 4, inset), and a subsequent short exposure (1–2 min) to air restored the original spectrum, which, however, became bleached upon prolonged admission of air. For comparison, Fig. 5 shows the optical spectrum of the Ultrogel AcA44 fraction of the enzyme purification scheme, which is largely defective as to holoenzyme activity (Table I). The prominent feature is a pronounced peak at 416 nm (estimated absorption coefficient for iron = 6 mm−1cm−1), followed by shoulders at 470 and 580 nm, giving such samples a characteristic red-brown color appearance. These spectral data suggest the presence of 3Fe-4S clusters, possibly a mixture of linear and cubic forms, when the spectrum is compared with the optical spectra of the 3Fe-4S forms of aconitase (20Beinert H. Kennedy M.C. Stout C.D. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2335-2373Google Scholar). This is supported by the EPR spectrum of the Ultrogel fraction (not shown), which displays a strong nearly isotropic signal atgav = 2.026 similar to the g = 2.01 signal of the (cubic) [3Fe-4S]+ cluster form of aconitase (20Beinert H. Kennedy M.C. Stout C.D. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2335-2373Google Scholar, 21Surerus K.K. Kennedy M.C. Beinert H. Münck E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9846-9850Google Scholar). It should be noted here that the functionally defective Fe-S core is usually retained on carrying the Ultrogel fraction through conventional protein purification protocols. This occurred most probably also with the first isolation of chromosomally encoded PFL activase from wild-type E. coli, where an associated color had been ascribed to an organic factor (6Conradt H. Hohmann-Berger M. Hohmann H.-P. Blaschkowski H.P. Knappe J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 228: 133-142Google Scholar). However, this possibility was dismissed later on by studies of overproduced or heterological"

The cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; N-SMase, neutral sphingomyelinase; LDL, low density lipoprotein; SRE, sterol regulatory element; SREBP-1, SRE binding protein-1; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; C2-ceramide,N-acetylsphingosine.-α) elicits a wide range of biological effects including inflammatory, cytotoxic, antiviral, and proliferative processes (1Goeddel D.V. Aggarwal B.B. Gray P.W. Leung D.W. Nedwin G.E. Palladino M.A. Patton J.S. Pennica D. Shepard H.M. Sugarman B.J. Wong G.H.W. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1986; 51: 597-609Google Scholar). Despite significant progress in our understanding of the signal transducing mechanisms employed by TNF-α (2Bazzoni F. Beutler B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1717-1725Google Scholar), they remain incompletely characterized. Elucidation of these pathways is complicated by the existence of at least two TNF receptors. These receptors share some common downstream effectors but also signal via receptor specific pathways. One of the earliest events in TNF signaling is the activation of neutral sphingomyelinase (N-SMase). Neutral sphingomyelinase is a membrane bound enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramide and phosphocholine at a pH optima of 7.4 (3Chatterjee S. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 25-48Google Scholar). The role of neutral sphingomyelinase in signal transduction has primarily been ascribed to its ability to generate the lipid second messenger ceramide. In addition to TNF-α, Fas receptor ligand (4Tepper C.G. Jayadev S. Liu B. Bielawska A. Wolff R. Yonehara S. Hannun Y.A. Seldin M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 484-489Google Scholar) have all been shown to increase ceramide levels. Sphingolipids, including ceramide, are increasingly appreciated as regulators of cell growth and differentiation (8Dobrowsky R.T. Werner M.H. Castellino A.M. Chao M.V. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1596-1599Google Scholar, 11Cuvillier, O., Pirianov, G., Kleuser, B., Vanek, P. G., Coso, O. A., Gutkind, J. S., and Spiegel, S., Nature, 381, 800–803.Google Scholar). Other lipids, such as cholesterol, have long been appreciated for their roles in cell physiology and pathophysiology. Cholesterol homeostasis in particular is a tightly regulated process. Dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism can lead to a variety of pathophysiological states including heart disease and stroke (12Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1986; 343: 425-430Google Scholar). The focus of regulation for cholesterol homeostasis is the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (12Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1986; 343: 425-430Google Scholar). The LDL receptor binds to cholesterol rich particles in the plasma and delivers them to cells. Transcription of the LDL receptor gene is suppressed when sterols accumulate and induced when sterols are depleted. Sterol sensitivity is conferred by a 10-base pair sequence upstream of the LDL receptor gene known as the sterol regulatory element (SRE) (13Dawson P.A. Hofmann S.L. van der Westhhuyzen D.R. Sudhof T.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3372-3379Google Scholar). The mature form of the sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) binds to the SRE and promotes transcription (14Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Google Scholar). The activity of SREBP-1 is controlled by an extranuclear sequestration mechanism. Like nuclear factor-kB, SREBP-1 is synthesized as an inactive precursor that is proteolytically processed into a mature transcriptionally active form that translocates to the nucleus. Unlike nuclear factor-kB, however, SREBP-1 proteolysis is induced by sterol depletion and suppressed by sterol accumulation. Both molecules are proteolyzed in response to treatment with TNF-α. Here we report that TNF-α is capable of inducing SREBP-1 proteolysis independent of the presence of sterols. Exogenously supplied sphingomyelinase and ceramide are also capable of inducing SREBP-1 proteolysis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The kinetics of SREBP-1 maturation is consistent with those of neutral sphingomyelinase activation by TNF-α. Further, SREBP-1 maturation can be blocked with anti-N-SMase antibodies suggesting that neutral sphingomyelinase is necessary for TNF-α-induced sterol-independent SREBP-1 cleavage. The product of sterol-independent SREBP-1 proteolysis is capable of nuclear translocation and binds to the sterol regulatory element. A continuous line of human hepatocytes designated HH-25 was prepared from normal human tissue (18Wang X. Zelenski N.G. Yang J. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1012-1020Google Scholar). Alpha-modified minimal essential medium was purchased from Mediatech (Herndon, VA). Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Hyclone (Salt Lake City, UT). F10 medium and the insulin-transferrin-selenium supplement were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Human recombinant epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and TNF-α were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). C2-ceramide (N-acetylsphingosine) was obtained from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA). [14C]Sphingomyelin (specific activity 50 mCi/mmol) was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Anti-SREBP-1 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Sphingomyelinase from Streptomyces species and all other reagents were obtained from Sigma. HH-25 cells were grown in alpha-minimal essential medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 μg/ml insulin, 0.1 μm selenium, 5.5 μg/ml transferrin, 0.5 μg/ml linoleic acid, and 10% fetal bovine serum (medium A). The cells were incubated in serum free F10 media for 30 to 60 min prior to initiating treatment with TNF-α, C2-ceramide, or sphingomyelinase. Following treatment, the cells were washed with 5 ml of PBS and pelleted at 1500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was stored at −70 °C and lysed in 0.5 ml buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 7 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.35 m sucrose, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin). The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C to prepare a nuclear fraction. After stimulation with TNF-α for the indicated time intervals, the cells were washed once with 5 ml of PBS and harvested. The pellet was stored frozen at −70 °C and resuspended in 0.5 ml of buffer B (100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors). The cell suspension was sonicated 3 times (3-s bursts) using a probe sonicator and centrifuged at 500 ×g at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was used as the enzyme source. 100 μg of protein was assayed for neutral sphingomyelinase activity in a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg of bovine serum albumin, 5 mmMgCl2, and 50 μmol of [14C]sphingomyelin (12,000 dpm). The assay was incubated at 37 °C for 1.5 h and terminated with the addition of 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitate was pelleted (1000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min) and 1 ml of the supernatant was extracted with 1 ml of anhydrous diethyl ether. 0.5 ml of the aqueous phase was removed for liquid scintillation counting. 50 μg of nuclear protein was separated by gel electrophoresis on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were calibrated by high range molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) which were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and visualized with Coomassie staining. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against SREBP-1 were used at 0.5 μg/ml according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The antibody was visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG made in donkey (Amersham) using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting detection system kit (Amersham). Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were exposed to hyperfilm ECL (Amersham) for the indicated time. Immunoblots were quantified via densitometry performed on a PDI densitometer scanner (model 20J7) coupled to a SPARC IRC workstation. Cultured HH-25 cells were grown on coverslips and treated as described. After treatment, the cells were washed 3 times with PBS containing 1 mm MgCl2and 0.1 mm CaCl2 (solution A). The cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in solution A for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in solution A for 6 min at room temperature. The coverslips were then washed 3 times for 5 min with solution A. Primary antibody (anti-SREBP1) was used at a dilution of 0.5 μg/ml in PBS and applied for 1 h with gentle shaking. The cells were washed as above and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody was applied for 30 min according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The coverslips were washed, mounted on microscope slides, viewed, and photographed at the indicated magnification on a Zeiss Axiovert 25 fluorescence microscope. Cells were treated with either TNF-α, sphingomyelinase, or C2-ceramide for 1 h at concentrations identical to those used in the SREBP-1 maturation studies. The cells were then washed twice with minimal essential medium and refed with medium A for 6 h. The cells were harvested and genomic DNA was prepared as described (22Clejan S. Bittman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10823-10826Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was electrophoresed and stained with ethidium bromide. Gel mobility shift assays were performed as follows. Each 20-μl reaction mixture contained 8–10 μg of nuclear protein plus a α-32P-labeled 25-base pair oligonucleotide probe containing the SREBP-binding site (14Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Google Scholar) in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm spermidine, 0.15 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.35 mm sucrose). The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min and loaded directly onto a 6.5% polyacrylamide (49:0.6 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) gel in a buffer of 25 mmTris borate (pH 8.0), 0.25 mm EDTA. In some experiments, antisera specific for SREBP or preimmune sera were added to reaction mixtures to determine the composition of protein-probe complexes. For these “supershift” assays, extracts were incubated with 1 μl of preimmune sera or an equal volume of anti-SREBP antisera at 4 °C for 30 min prior to addition of α-32P-labeled probe. In all experiments, proteins were separated by electrophoresis at 200 V for 2 h at room temperature. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XAR film with intensifying screens. Assays were repeated with nuclear extracts obtained from three unique experiments and evaluated by phosphoimage analysis to ensure reproducibility of results. Neutral sphingomyelinase activity increased rapidly with the addition of TNF-α (Fig. 1). A maximal 2.5-fold increase in activity was observed 15 min after TNF-α was added to the cells. The gradual return of N-SMase activity to control levels within 1 h contrasted the rapid onset of activation and is reflected in the asymmetric kinetic profile observed. Sterol-independent SREBP-1 maturation in response to TNF-α closely paralleled the kinetics of TNF-α induced N-SMase activation. The mass of the mature form of SREBP-1 was found to increase 2-fold after 5 min and 3-fold after 15 min of incubation with TNF-α (Fig. 2). The amount of mature SREBP-1 returned to control levels within 1 h. This effect could not be recapitulated with epidermal growth factor or platelet-derived growth factor treatment (data not shown). The increase in mature SREBP-1 levels was accompanied by a concomitant decrease in the intensity of the band corresponding to the precursor form of SREBP-1 see Fig. 2. After 60 min of treatment, significantly less precursor SREBP-1 is visible. To incorporate the observed increase in mature SREBP-1 and the concomitant decrease in precursor SREBP-1 into a single variable, we plotted the ratio of precursor SREBP-1 to mature (Fig. 2). A maximal 1.5-fold decrease in the precursor to mature ratio occurred 45 min after TNF-α was added to the medium. The decrease in precursor to mature ratio was more pronounced in the initial 30 min of treatment. This is also consistent with the kinetics of TNF-α-induced N-SMase activation. To explore the possibility that plasma membrane sphingomyelinase was involved in the signal transduction pathway leading to SREBP-1 proteolysis, we treated cells with exogenously supplied bacterial sphingomyelinase. Sphingomyelinase induced a dramatic change in the relative amounts of precursor and mature SREBP-1. As seen in Fig. 2, a 2.5-fold increase in mature SREBP-1 levels was observed after 15 min of treatment. Unlike TNF-α, the increase in mature SREBP-1 induced by sphingomyelinase persisted after 60 min. Sphingomyelinase was also capable of reducing the level of the precursor form of SREBP-1 (Fig. 2). Treatment with purified recombinant human sphingomyelinase produced similar results. Since much of the signal-transducing ability of N-SMase has been ascribed to its ability to generate the lipid second messenger ceramide, we tested the ability of a cell-permeable ceramide analog C2-ceramide (N-acetylsphingosine) to induce SREBP-1 maturation. C2-ceramide also induces SREBP-1 maturation in a sterol-independent manner with greater magnitude than what was observed with either TNF-α or sphingomyelinase. C2-ceramide increased the level of mature SREBP-1 4-fold after 30 min of treatment (Fig. 2). The persistent elevation of mature SREBP-1 levels observed with sphingomyelinase treatment also accompanied C2-ceramide treatment. The increase in mature SREBP-1 is recapitulated with the addition of bovine brain ceramides but could not be induced with C2-dihydroceramide, phospholipase A2, or phospholipase D treatment (data not shown). To demonstrate that the observed maturation of SREBP-1 was not an artifact of the more general phenomenon of apoptosis-induced proteolysis, we performed DNA laddering assays. The 160-base pair DNA ladder characteristic of cells undergoing apoptosis was not observed in any of the samples (data not shown). The extent of TNF-α induced SREBP-1 maturation did not vary appreciably with concentration. A maximal effect was observed with 10 ng/ml of TNF-α (Fig. 3). 250 milliunits of sphingomyelinase activity induced an 80% decrease in the precursor to mature ratio (Fig. 3). As little as 1 μm of C2-ceramide was effective in producing an 81% maximal effect. The maximal effect, however, was obtained with a C2-ceramide concentration of 50 μm (Fig. 3). The availability of anti-N-SMase antibodies allowed us to examine the effects of TNF-α on this pathway independent of N-SMase activation (10Kim M.Y. Linardic C. Obeid L. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 484-489Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-N-SMase antibodies at a dilution of 1:200 completely block TNF-α-induced SREBP-1 maturation (Fig. 4). The suppression of TNF-α-mediated SREBP-1 maturation was relieved with increasing antibody dilution. Preincubation with preimmune serum at the same dilution had no appreciable effect. To determine if the SREBP-1 fragment generated by TNF-α, C2-ceramide, or sphingomyelinase treatment was capable of nuclear translocation, we pursued immunofluorescence studies. Previous immunofluorescence studies have relied on the overexpression of precursor and mature forms of SREBP-1 (14Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Google Scholar). We were able to visualize endogenous SREBP-1 in treated and untreated cells with polyclonal antibodies directed against the DNA binding domain of SREBP-1. Since the DNA binding domain is common to both the precursor and mature forms, we were able to examine the total distribution of endogenous SREBP-1. TNF-α, C2-ceramide, and sphingomyelinase are all capable of inducing changes in the subcellular localization of SREBP-1 (Fig. 5 A). Untreated cells display an even staining pattern throughout their cell bodies. This is consistent with the localization of precursor SREBP-1 to intracellular membranes (14Wang X. Sato R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 53-62Google Scholar). However, cells treated with TNF-α, C2-ceramide, or sphingomyelinase exhibit intense nuclear staining and little extranuclear staining (Fig. 5, B,C, and D). The rapid change in the subcellular localization of SREBP-1 is consistent with a precursor/product relationship between the two forms and provides additional evidence that the mature SREBP-1 fragment generated by treatment is capable of nuclear translocation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were pursued to demonstrate that the mature SREBP-1 fragment is additionally capable of binding to its consensus sequence. The amount of electrophoretically retarded probe increases with time following TNF-α treatment (Fig. 6 A). The kinetics of this process is consistent with the activation of N-SMase. The amount of probe bound increases with sphingomyelinase and ceramide treatment. As expected, C2-ceramide induces a more rapid accumulation of active nuclear SREBP-1 than either TNF-α or sphingomyelinase (Fig. 6,A-C). Antibodies directed toward the DNA binding domain of SREBP successfully compete with the oligonucleotide probe for binding (Fig. 6 D). Binding of the probe is not titrated by an unrelated oligonucleotide but is decreased with the addition of a nonradioactive competing probe (data not shown). The importance of cholesterol homeostasis is underscored by the significant amount of redundancy that has been incorporated into its regulation. Cholesterol homeostasis is regulated at the transcriptional, translational, and enzymatic levels. The observation that feedback inhibition plays an important role in cholesterol homeostasis has stimulated much work in elucidating the exact role of sterols in this process (12Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1986; 343: 425-430Google Scholar). The current data suggest a novel pathway by which SREBP-1 maturation could be effected in a sterol-independent manner. TNF-α is capable of inducing SREBP-1 maturation in a sterol-independent manner in human hepatocytes. These findings are not a general response to growth factors, as they could not be recapitulated with epidermal growth factor or platelet-derived growth factor. The maturation, nuclear translocation, and SRE binding activity of SREBP-1 in response to TNF-α closely paralleled the kinetics of N-SMase activation. The effect of TNF-α on SREBP-1 maturation could be reconstituted with exogenously supplied bacterial or human sphingomyelinase (data not shown) or C2-ceramide but could not be recapitulated with dihydroceramide, phospholipase A2, or phospholipase D. Preincubation with anti-N-SMase antibody effectively blocked TNF-α-induced SREBP-1 maturation. Inhibition was not observed with preimmune serum treatment and was relieved with increasing antibody dilution. Such findings are also confirmed by the ability of the antibody to inhibit TNF-α-induced increases in cholesterol ester synthesis and N-SMase-induced increases in 125I-LDL binding, internalization, and degradation in human fibroblasts (15Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 879-882Google Scholar,16Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3401-3406Google Scholar). The addition of C2-ceramide, a water soluble ceramide analog, or bacterial sphingomyelinase mimicked the effect of TNF-α on SREBP-1 maturation. In fact, C2-ceramide and sphingomyelinase induced more extensive SREBP-1 maturation than TNF-α. This may reflect the presence of a regulatory event upstream of ceramide generation that is effectively bypassed with exogenous ceramide or sphingomyelinase. The lack of apparent dose dependence observed with TNF-α treatment might be attributable to saturable binding of the TNF-α receptors or an internal regulatory event that reduces the signaling capacity of the TNF-α receptors. Previous studies have shown that an increase in SREBP-1 levels increases LDL receptor levels and sterol biogenesis (13Dawson P.A. Hofmann S.L. van der Westhhuyzen D.R. Sudhof T.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3372-3379Google Scholar). Our gel mobility shift experiments (Fig. 6) clearly indicate that TNF-α, N-SMase and C2-ceramide all induce SREBP-1 levels in hepatocytes. In addition, we have previously shown that TNF-α induces sterol metabolism in cultured human fibroblasts (15Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 879-882Google Scholar) and LDL receptors (16Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3401-3406Google Scholar, 17Hamanaka R. Kohno K. Seguchi T. Okamura K. Morimoto A. Ono M. Ogata J. Kuwano M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13160-13165Google Scholar). Finally, our preliminary data indicate that indeed TNF-α induces LDL receptor mRNA levels in human hepatocytes. Collectively, these observations suggest that TNF-α-induced increase in mature SREBP-1 level is accompanied by increased LDL receptors and sterol metabolism. TNF-α, C2-ceramide, and sphingomyelinase did not induce apoptosis in our studies demonstrating that in hepatocytes, SREBP-1 maturation is not part of the more general phenomenon of apoptotic protein hydrolysis. It has been speculated that cells undergoing apoptosis require cholesterol to maintain the integrity of their plasma membranes (18Wang X. Zelenski N.G. Yang J. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1012-1020Google Scholar). The 160-base pair DNA ladder characteristic of cells undergoing apoptosis generally appears 4–8 h after an apoptosis-initiating stimuli is introduced. The kinetics of SREBP-1 maturation presented in this study would suggest that SREBP-1 proteolysis is a sufficiently early event to be involved in providing cholesterol to apoptotic cells. However, there was no evidence of apoptosis in the HH-25 human hepatocyte cell line used in this study. It is possible that the sterol-independent induction of SREBP-1 maturation in hepatocytes is a physiologic process that does not require that apoptosis be induced. Alternatively, the two pathways may diverge before the cell has been committed to apoptosis suggesting a manner in which sterol-independent SREBP-1 proteolysis could be employed independent of the induction of apoptosis. TNF-α is known to activate the apoptotic protease CPP32, and it has been shown that SREBP-1 is a physiological substrate (18Wang X. Zelenski N.G. Yang J. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1012-1020Google Scholar). In a recent study, a cell-permeable ceramide was shown to induce the proteolytic cleavage of CPP32, a ced-3 interleukin-1β converting enzyme-like protease but not interleukin-1β converting enzyme (19Mizushima N. Koike R. Kohsaka H. Kushi Y. Handa S. Yagita H. Miyasaka N. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 267-271Google Scholar). Thus, sterol-independent cleavage of SREBP-1 observed in our studies with human hepatocytes could also occur by ceramide generated by the TNF-α-induced N-SMase activation. This phenomenon may be reconstituted by the exogenous addition of N-SMase and/or C2-ceramide to the hepatocytes. It is tempting to speculate that this pathway may represent a role for the apoptotic protease CPP32 in normal cellular homeostasis. Previous studies have shown that cholesterol efflux from the membrane into the cytosol occurs with increased neutral sphingomyelinase activity (16Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3401-3406Google Scholar). This effect is attributed to the depletion of plasma membrane sphingomyelin, which has been shown to exert a stabilizing effect on plasma membrane cholesterol stores through favorable thermodynamic interactions (20Bittman R. Kasireddy C.R. Mattjus P. Slotte J.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11776-11781Google Scholar, 21Kan C. Ruan Z. Bittman R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10746-10754Google Scholar, 22Clejan S. Bittman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10823-10826Google Scholar). We propose a model (Fig. 7) that incorporates these data and suggests a mechanism by which TNF-α could initiate SREBP-1 proteolysis. According to this hypothesis, TNF-α binds to one or more of its cell surface receptors and in so doing promotes the activation of N-SMase. Recently, a candidate protein that mediates this activation has been cloned (23Adam-Klages S. Adam D. Weigmann K. Struve S. Kolanus W. Schneider-Mergener J. Kronke M. Cell. 1996; 86: 937-947Google Scholar). N-SMase hydrolyzes membrane sphingomyelin into ceramide and phosphocholine. Ceramide, in turn, activates a protease perhaps CPP32 that mediates SREBP-1 maturation. The mature SREBP-1 then migrates into the nucleus as shown and drives the transcription of genes with an upstream sterol regulatory element. This model may be invoked to explain how sterol homeostasis can occur in the presence of increased cytosolic sterols, which would be predicted to suppress SREBP-1 maturation. The advantage conferred by the participation of neutral sphingomyelinase in cholesterol homeostasis is that it is capable of providing a short term solution to cholesterol starvation through mobilization of plasma membrane cholesterol and can facilitate long term compensatory mechanisms by promoting the maturation of SREBP-1. Here, we report that TNF-α is capable of inducing SREBP-1 proteolysis independent of the presence of sterols. Exogenously supplied sphingomyelinase and ceramide are also capable of inducing SREBP-1 proteolysis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The kinetics of SREBP-1 maturation is consistent with the activation of neutral sphingomyelinase by TNF-α. Furthermore, our preliminary data indicates that recombinant human N-SMase can also exert a time- and concentration-dependent induction of SREBP-1 maturation. In addition, anti-N-SMase antibodies block SREBP-1 maturation. Taken together, these findings suggest that neutral sphingomyelinase is necessary for TNF-α-induced sterol-independent SREBP-1 cleavage. Our data implicate N-SMase in the TNF-α initiated signal transduction pathway leading to SREBP-1 maturation and provide evidence that ceramide is the second messenger employed. Further, they suggest a role for TNF-α in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis. Additional studies are required to establish the role of cholesterol in apoptotic cells and the role of the different tumor necrosis factor receptors in SREBP-1 maturation. Better understanding of this pathway may yield novel targets for the pharmacological manipulation of serum cholesterol levels.

https://openalex.org/W2088240158,"The propagation of activity is studied in a spatially structured network model of γ-aminobutyric acid–containing (GABAergic) neurons exhibiting postinhibitory rebound. In contrast to excitatory-coupled networks, recruitment spreads very slowly because cells fire only after the postsynaptic conductance decays, and with two possible propagation modes. If the connection strength decreases monotonically with distance (on-center), then propagation occurs in a discontinuous manner. If the self- and nearby connections are absent (off-center), propagation can proceed smoothly. Modest changes in the synaptic reversal potential can result in depolarization-mediated waves that are 25 times faster. Functional and developmental roles for these behaviors and implications for thalamic circuitry are suggested."

Moreover, Spi-1/PU.1 binds RNA and interferes in vitro with the splicing process. Here we report that Spi-1 interacts in vivo with TLS (translocated in liposarcoma), a RNA-binding protein involved in human tumor-specific chromosomal translocations. This interaction appears functionally relevant, since TLS is capable of reducing the abilities of Spi-1/PU.1 to bind DNA and to transactivate the expression of a reporter gene. In addition, we observe that TLS is potentially a splicing factor. It promotes the use of the distal 5′ splice site during the E1A pre-mRNA splicing. This effect is counterpoised in vivo by Spi-1. These data suggest that alteration of pre-mRNA alternative splicing by Spi-1 could be involved in the transformation of an erythroblastic cell.

McKercher S.R. Celada A. Van Beveren C. Maki A. Cell. 1990; 61: 113-124Google Scholar) is an Ets protein that plays a central role in the differentiation of macrophages and B cells during normal hematopoiesis. Indeed, the disruption of the Spi-1/PU.1 gene in mouse (2McKercher S.R. Torbett B.E. Anderson K.L. Henkel G.W. Vestal D.J. Baribault H. Klemz M. Feeney A.J. Wu G.E. Paige C.J. Maki R.A.

Science. 1994; 265: 1573-1577Google Scholar) induces an early lethality of animals that lack mature macrophages, neutrophils, B and T cells, and also osteoclasts (4Tondravi M.M. McKercher S.R. Anderson K. Erdmann J.M. Quiroz M. Maki R. Teitelbaum S.L. Nature. 1997; 386: 81-84Google Scholar). These animals present no alteration in erythrocytic and megacaryocytic lineages. Consistent with this phenotype, Spi-1-responsive elements have been identified in transcriptional promoters and enhancers of many myeloid and B lymphoid genes (for review, see Ref. 5Moreau-Gachelin F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 149-163Google Scholar). In murine Friend acute erythroleukemia, the mutation of the spi-1 gene by retroviral insertional mutagenesis induces its transcriptional activation. The erythroleukemic process developed in spi-1 transgenic mice reveals that Spi-1 is involved in blocking the differentiation of the proerythroblast (6Moreau-Gachelin F. Wendling F. Molina T. Denis N. Titeux M. Grimber G. Briand P. Vainchenker W. Tavitian A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2453-2463Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms that lead Spi-1 to arrest the erythroid differentiation are not yet understood. The up-regulation of Spi-1 related to the transformation of the proerythroblast suggests that Spi-1 may induce a transcriptional dysregulation of some erythroid genes or/and may be abnormally associated with erythroid partners. Some nuclear proteins interacting with Spi-1 have already been identified such as the transactivator NF-IL6β/C/EBPδ (7Nagulapalli S. Pongubala J.M.R. Atchison M.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4330-4338Google Scholar), the transcription factor Pip/NF-EM5 (8Pongubala J.M.R. Nagulapalli S. Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Maki R.A. Atchison M.L. Mol. Cell.

We reported previously that Spi-1 interacts with the RNA-binding protein p54nrb (nuclear RNA-binding protein, 54 kDa), binds to RNA by its DNA-binding domain and interferes in vitro with the splicing of a β-globin minigene (10Hallier M. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11177-11181Google Scholar). Here, we describe that Spi-1/PU.1 interacts with another RNA-binding protein TLS and that this association impedes the transcriptional functions of Spi-1. In addition, TLS influences,in vivo, the selection of the 5′ splice site during the alternative splicing of the adenovirus E1A pre-mRNA, and Spi-1 interferes with this selection process. These data suggest that the transcription factor Spi-1 may change the alternative selection of pre-mRNA splicing sites and may consequently modulate the splicing of some pre-mRNA.

The pellet was resuspended in HNN buffer (HN buffer with 420 mm NaCl), stirred gently for 30 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged for 20 min at 45,000 rpm (TLA-45 rotor, TL100 ultracentrifuge). The supernatant (nuclear extracts) was diluted in HNTBSA buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 g/l BSA, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% Triton X-100, 2 mm PMSF, and antiproteases), precleared three times with GST-Sepharose beads, and then incubated with GST-Spi-1 beads for 1 h at 4 °C. After washes with HNTBSA buffer, bound proteins were eluted with HNTBSA buffer containing 1.0m KCl. The resulting eluate was diluted in HNTBSA buffer, precleared with GST-Sepharose beads and rechromatographed on GST-Spi-1 beads. The beads were washed with HNT buffer (HNTBSA buffer without BSA). Proteins were eluted with HNT buffer containing 1.0 mKCl, separated on SDS-PAGE, visualized by Amido Black staining, purified, and subjected to internal amino acid sequence determination. The nuclear extracts from 745A and IW1–32 cells were precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads. The polyclonal anti-TLS antibodies prepared against the 165 NH2-terminal amino acids of TLS fused to GST and the anti-Spi-1 antibodies (14Delgado M.D. Hallier M. Meneceur P. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1723-1727Google Scholar) were affinity-purified and bound to protein A-Sepharose in HNK buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 250 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm PMSF, antiproteases). Immunoprecipitations of nuclear extracts from 107 cells were performed in HNK buffer. After alternative washing with HN buffer and HNK buffer, immunoprecipitates were migrated on 10% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose filter. The filter was incubated with affinity-purified anti-TLS or anti-Spi-1 antibodies, and Western blot analysis was performed according to the ECL protocol (Amersham Corp.). In vitro translated TLS and Spi-1 proteins were synthesized using TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysates (Promega) and [35S]methionine. Labeled proteins were incubated 1 h in NDT buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm DTT) with GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. After extensive washing, the bound proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. For interaction in the presence of RNase A,in vitro 35S-translated TLS and GST-Spi-1 bound to Sepharose beads were first incubated 15 min at 30 °C in HNDT buffer containing 200 μg/ml RNase A (Boehringer Mannheim) before association. For experiment with microccocal nuclease, the same protocol was used except that buffer NDT was supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and 150 units of microccocal nuclease (Boehringer Mannheim). Electromobility shift assays were performed as described elsewhere (15Ray-Gallet D. Mao C. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 303-313Google Scholar) with in vitrotranslated Spi-1, TLS, AD-RGG1-TLS, RRM-TLS, and RGG2–3-TLS proteins and 32P-labeled c-fes (15Ray-Gallet D. Mao C. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 303-313Google Scholar) DNA probe. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and transfected, using the calcium phosphate procedure, at 60% confluence in 60-mm plates. 2 μg of reporter plasmid, various amounts of expression vectors, and DNA carrier up to 10 μg were used for each plate. The total amount of expression vector was kept constant by addition of the control expression plasmid pCS3. Conditions for CAT assay and determination of CAT activity have been described previously (15Ray-Gallet D. Mao C. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 303-313Google Scholar). Transfection efficiencies were standardized by cotransfection of a β-galactosidase reporter construct, and all experiments were repeated three times. IW1–32 cells (2 × 106cells) were resuspended in 0.8 ml of Opti-MEM. Each transfection experiment was performed with 0.3 μg of the adenovirus E1A reporter vector pCS3-MT-E1A and 1 μg of pCS3-MT, pCS3-MT-A1, pCS3-MT-Spi-1, pCS3-MT-TLS, pCS3-MT-Fli-1, or pCS3-MT. The total amount of expression vector was kept constant by addition of the control expression plasmid pCS3. 7 μl of DNA in water were diluted in 93 μl of Opti-MEM and mixed with 100 μl of Opti-MEM containing 12.5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). The DNA/LipofectAMINE mixtures were added to the IW1–32 cells, and after 4 h at 37 °C, 3.5 ml of minimum Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum were added to the transfected cells. Cells were harvested 20 h after transfection and total RNAs were purified using guanidine hydrochloride extraction procedure and DNase treatment. RT-PCR detection of E1A isoforms was performed as described by Caceres et al. (16Caceres J.F. Stamm S. Helfman D.M. Krainer A.D. Science. 1994; 265: 1706-1709Google Scholar). Detection was carried out by autoradiography and quantification by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamic). A glutathione S-transferase-Spi-1 fusion protein was used as affinity chromatography reactant to search for proteins interacting with Spi-1 from nuclear extracts of murine Friend erythroleukemic cells 745A (17Friend C. Scher W. Holland J.G. Sato T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 378-382Google Scholar). Analysis of the Spi-1-bound proteins by SDS-PAGE revealed that several proteins with apparent molecular masses between 120 and 34 kDa bind specifically to the GST-Spi-1 fusion protein (Fig. 1 A). The 70-kDa protein was purified and an internal peptide was subjected to amino acid sequence determination. This sequence (GEATVSFDDPPSAK) allowed to identify in GenBank™ the 70-kDa protein as TLS (translocated in liposarcoma) (11Crozat A. Aman P. Mandahl N. Ron D. Nature. 1993; 363: 640-644Google Scholar,18Rabbitts T.H. Forster A. Larson R. Nathan P. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 175-180Google Scholar), a protein involved in various human tumor-specific chromosomal translocations; such as the translocation observed in an acute myeloid leukemia where the 5′ region of TLS is fused to the DNA-binding domain of the Ets protein Erg (19Ichikawa H. Shimizu K. Hayashi Y. Ohki M. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2865-2868Google Scholar). To determine whether the interaction of Spi-1 with TLS occurs in vivo, we looked for the presence of a TLS/Spi-1 complex in nuclear extracts from 745A cells. Spi-1 was immunoprecipitated at reduced stringency with anti-Spi-1 antibodies, and the presence of TLS in Spi-1 immunoprecipitates was assessed with anti-TLS antibodies. Fig. 1 B revealed the presence of TLS in the Spi-1 immune complexes. To assess the specificity of the coimmunoprecipitation with anti-Spi-1 antibodies, the same procedure was carried out with nuclear extracts from the erythroid cell line IW1–32 (20Tambourin P. Casadevall N. Choppin J. Lacombe C. Heard J.M. Fichelson S. Wendling F. Hankins W.D. Varet B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6269-6273Google Scholar) that do not express Spi-1 (Fig. 1 B, Input). TLS was not detected, even though it is expressed in these cells (Fig. 1 B, Input). Reciprocally, TLS was first immunoprecipitated from 745A nuclear extracts with anti-TLS antibodies, and the presence of Spi-1 and TLS was searched by immunoblotting of the TLS immunoprecipitates with anti-Spi-1 or anti-TLS antibodies. Spi-1 was present in anti-TLS immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 B). Thus, protein complexes that contain both Spi-1 and TLS occur in vivo. To delineate the Spi-1 regions that interact with TLS, we investigated whether TLS could associate with GST fusion proteins containing either the transactivation domain with the PEST domain (aa 1–158) or the DNA-binding domain (aa 158–266) of Spi-1 (Fig. 2 A). The35S-translated TLS protein was retained on the entire Spi-1 (GST-Spi-1) and on its DNA-binding domain (GST-DBD-Spi-1) (Fig. 2 B). To gain further insight into the specificity of TLS interaction with Spi-1, we analyzed whether another Ets family protein; the Fli-1 protein fused to GST, could bind TLS (Fig. 2 B). Neither GST-Fli-1 nor its functional domains interacted with TLS. The same result was observed with Ets-2 (data not shown). In these experiments, we ensured that the DNA-binding domains of Spi-1 and Fli-1 were functional when fused to GST in a band shift assay (data not shown). These experiments reveal that the interaction of TLS with the Ets domain of Spi-1 is not a general feature of the Ets proteins. The TLS protein contains a transcriptional activation domain rich in glutamine residues (AD) (aa 1–165), three RGG domains (repeats of the tripeptide Arg-Gly-Gly) (aa 165–246, 372–425, and 454–526) and an 80-amino acid RNA recognition motif (RRM) (aa 287–372), both involved in the binding to RNA (11Crozat A. Aman P. Mandahl N. Ron D. Nature. 1993; 363: 640-644Google Scholar). To identify the TLS domain(s) involved in the interaction with Spi-1, a series of deleted TLS proteins fused to GST (Fig. 2 A) were evaluated for their abilities to retainin vitro 35S-translated Spi-1 protein (Fig. 2 B). Spi-1 binds to the GST-TLS protein as well as to the GST-RRM-TLS (271–392) and the GST-RGG2–3TLS (aa 392–526) proteins, showing that TLS interacts in vitro with Spi-1 through its central RRM domain and its two RGG COOH-terminal domains. Taken together, these results reveal that the Spi-1-TLS interaction occurs through its respective DNA- and RNA-binding domains. Moreover, addition of RNase A or microccocal nuclease in such GST-Spi-1 pull down experiments did not affect the binding of TLS to GST-Spi-1 (Fig. 2 C), revealing that Spi-1-TLS interaction did not depend on RNA as a third partner. To investigate whether the interaction between TLS and Spi-1 could interfere with the transcriptional activity of Spi-1, we examined whether TLS affects the binding of Spi-1 to DNA in a band shift assay with the c-fes Spi-1 binding site (fes-RE) (15Ray-Gallet D. Mao C. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 303-313Google Scholar). In contrast to AD-RGG1-TLS, when increasing amounts of either TLS, RRM-TLS, or RGG2–3-TLS were mixed to a constant amount of Spi-1 protein, a progressive decrease in the formation of the fes-RE-Spi-1 complex was observed (Fig. 3 A). This result reveals that TLS, by its 271–526-amino acid region, is able to prevent Spi-1 to bind its responsive element. We investigated whether TLS could interfere with the transactivator function of Spi-1 in cotransfection experiments performed in HeLa cells with a reporter vector containing three direct repeats of the fes-RE upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter and the CAT gene (15Ray-Gallet D. Mao C. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 303-313Google Scholar). TLS did not, per se, affect the expression of the reporter gene. Cotransfection of the Spi-1 expression vector with increasing quantities of the TLS expression vector resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of the CAT expression (Fig. 3 B). It was ascertained, by Western blotting, that the Spi-1 protein level, in all cotransfected HeLa cells, was identical (data not shown). Moreover, the TLS-induced inhibition of Spi-1 transcriptional activity did not result from titration of a limited component of the basal transcriptional machinery by the TLS transactivator domain. Indeed, the expression of the TLS amino-terminal domain (AD-RGG1-TLS) did no affect this Spi-1 function (Fig. 3 B). In light of our results on the alteration of Spi-1 DNA binding activity by TLS, we hypothesized that TLS could repress the transcriptional activity of Spi-1 by inhibiting its DNA binding. The Spi-1-TLS interaction interferes with the functions of Spi-1. Conversely, it was more difficult to determine the consequences of this interaction on TLS function. Indeed, little is known about the function of this ubiquitously expressed protein. TLS presents 95% amino acids identity with the small nuclear RNP-associated protein 69KD (21Hackl W. Luhrmann R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 843-851Google Scholar) and forms in vivo a complex with the hnRNP A1, a splicing factor capable to favor the selection of the most distal 5′ splice site during alternative splicing of some pre-mRNA (16Caceres J.F. Stamm S. Helfman D.M. Krainer A.D. Science. 1994; 265: 1706-1709Google Scholar, 22Zinszner H. Albalat R. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2513-2526Google Scholar). These data prompted us to address the role of TLS in regulation of alternative splicingin vivo. As a first approach, we analyzed the effect of transient overexpression of TLS in the IW1–32 erythroid cells on the pattern of alternative splicing of a cotransfected adenovirus E1A gene (Fig. 4). The E1A pre-mRNA contains alternative 5′ splice sites that lead to the formation of three primary isoforms of RNA (13, 12, and 9 S) when expressed alone in IW1–32 cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Noteworthily, cotransfection of TLS resulted in a clear increase in the generation of the E1A 9 S, which is correlated to a decrease of the 13 and 12 S isoforms formation. This result reveals that TLS induces the preferential use of the most distal 5′ splice site during E1A pre-mRNA splicing. The TLS effect is similar to that of hnRNP A1 ((16) and Fig. 4 C). We then wondered whether Spi-1 alters the effect of TLS in alternative splicing process. Since we showed previously that Spi-1 inhibits in vitro the splicing process of a β-globin minigene (10Hallier M. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11177-11181Google Scholar), we first investigated the consequences of overexpression of Spi-1 on E1A splicing in IW1–32 cells that do not express endogenous Spi-1. Spi-1 faintly increased the formation of 13 and 12 S species and reduced the formation of the 9 S RNA as compared with control cells (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1 and 3). In contrast, the Fli-1 expression in IW1–32 cells did not alter the pattern of expression of the E1A mRNA isoforms (Fig. 4 B, lane 8). This was consistent with the absence of effect of Fli-1 onin vitro splicing (10Hallier M. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11177-11181Google Scholar). These results suggest that Spi-1 may modify the alternative splicing of the E1A gene in erythroid cells. In all the transfection experiments, the expressions of the transfected plasmids were ascertained by RT-PCR with primers that discriminate exogenous from the endogenous genes (data not shown). When Spi-1 and TLS were coexpressed in IW1–32 cells, the pattern of E1A mRNA isoforms became similar to the pattern observed in control cells (Fig. 4 C). Thus Spi-1 counteracts in vivo the effect of TLS on promoting the use of the distal 5′ splice site. The biological significance of this Spi-1-TLS interaction in pre-mRNA splicing requires additional knowledge on the specificity of the interactions of Spi-1 and TLS with RNA. TLS contains RNA binding motifs and binds to homoribopolymers (23Prasad D.D.K. Ouchida M. Lee L. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S.P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3717-3729Google Scholar) and RNA (11Crozat A. Aman P. Mandahl N. Ron D. Nature. 1993; 363: 640-644Google Scholar), but no RNA target elements for TLS are known to assess its RNA binding specificity. In addition, TLS and Spi-1 exhibit the same binding ability to poly(G) (10Hallier M. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11177-11181Google Scholar, 11Crozat A. Aman P. Mandahl N. Ron D. Nature. 1993; 363: 640-644Google Scholar). This prevents the analysis of Spi-1 effect on the binding of TLS to homoribopolymers. In Friend erythroleukemic cells, the up-regulation of Spi-1 is related to the arrest of proerythroblast differentiation. The prevailing view is that Spi-1 may deregulate the transcription of genes involved in the differentiation of the proerythroblast. Our previous data (10Hallier M. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11177-11181Google Scholar), showing the loss of splicing activity of HeLa nuclear extracts depleted on GST-Spi-1 affinity chromatography, suggested that Spi-1 may alter the splicing process by trapping splicing factors. We report here that interaction of Spi-1 and TLS alters, in vivo, the transactivator function of Spi-1 and counterpoises the TLS effect on 5′ splice site selection. Thus, we hypothesized that ectopic expression of Spi-1 in a proerythroblastic cell, such as in the Friend erythroleukemic cell or in the Spi-1-transgenic proerythroblast, leads Spi-1 to interfere with TLS or other RNA-binding proteins that together participate to the spliceosome assembly. Consequently, Spi-1 overexpression would disturb the balance of such splicing complexes involved in post-transcriptional regulation and could lead to an aberrant expression of some erythroid protein isoforms. This interaction of the protooncoproteins Spi-1/PU.1 and TLS could bring about a modulation of the alternative splicing process in vivo and establish an additional hypothesis implicating RNA processing alterations in the oncogenic processes. We are grateful to D. Ron for the gift of TLS cDNA, S. Riva for the gift of hnRNP A1 cDNA, and J. Stevenin for providing us with the Sp4 plasmid."
https://openalex.org/W2018894673,"In cells in which the lipoprotein assembly process had been inactivated by brefeldin A (BFA), membrane-associated apoB-100 disappeared without forming lipoproteins or being secreted, indicating that it was degraded. Reactivation of the assembly process by chasing the cells in the absence of BFA, gave rise to a quantitative recovery of the membrane-associated apoB-100 in the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) fraction in the medium. These results indicate that the membrane-associated apoB-100 can be converted to VLDL.A new method was developed by which the major amount (88%) of microsomal apoB-100 but not integral membrane proteins could be extracted. The major effect of this method was to increase the recovery of apoB-100 that banded in the LDL and HDL density regions, suggesting that the membrane-associated form of apoB-100 is partially lipidated. We also investigated the role of the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) in the assembly of apoB-100 VLDL using a photoactivatable MTP inhibitor (BMS-192951). This compound strongly inhibited the assembly and secretion of apoB-100 VLDL when present during the translation of the protein. To investigate the importance of MTP during the later stages in the assembly process, the cells were preincubated with BFA (to reversibly inhibit the assembly of apoB-100 VLDL) and pulse-labeled (+BFA) and chased (+BFA) for 30 min to obtain full-length apoB-100 associated with the microsomal membrane. Inhibition of MTP after the 30-min chase blocked assembly of VLDL. This indicates that MTP is important for the conversion of full-length apoB-100 into VLDL. Results from experiments in which a second chase (−BFA) was introduced before the inactivation of MTP indicated that only early events in this conversion of full-length apoB-100 into VLDL were blocked by the MTP inhibitor. Together these results indicate that there is a MTP-dependent “window” in the VLDL assembly process that occurs after the completion of apoB-100 but before the major amount of lipids is added to the VLDL particle. Thus the assembly of apoB-100 VLDL from membrane-associated apoB-100 involves an early MTP-dependent phase and a late MTP-independent phase, during which the major amount of lipid is added.

In humans apoB-100 is expressed in the liver, while apoB-48 is synthesized in the intestine (3Glickman R.M. Rogers M. Glickman J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5296-5300Google Scholar). In some animals, such as the rat, both proteins are expressed in the liver. When expressed in liver, both apoB-100 and apoB-48 assemble into VLDL particles (4Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Google Scholar, 5Sjöberg A. Oscarsson J. Borén J. Edén S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Lipid. Res. 1996; 37: 275-289Google Scholar). When expressed in the intestine, they both have the capacity to assemble into chylomicrons (6Farese R.V. Véniant M.M. Cham C.M. Flynn L.M. Pierotti V. Loring J.F. Traber M. Ruland S. Stokowski R.S. Huszar D. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6393-6398Google Scholar).Lipoprotein assembly is a complex process that is not yet understood in all detail. The availability of the McA-RH7777 rat hepatoma cell line, which assembles bona fide VLDL (4Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Google Scholar), has facilitated studies of this process. In addition, we have recently demonstrated that brefeldin A (BFA) reversibly inhibits the assembly of all apoB-100 lipoproteins, in particular VLDL (7Rustaeus S. Lindberg K. Borén J. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28879-28886Google Scholar). During BFA treatment, apoB-100 appeared in a non-VLDL form that pelleted with the microsomal membrane after sodium carbonate extraction of the lumenal content of the microsomes (7Rustaeus S. Lindberg K. Borén J. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28879-28886Google Scholar). Since it was possible to remove the BFA and reactivate the assembly process, we were able to demonstrate that this membrane-associated form of apoB-100 can be a precursor to apoB-100 VLDL (7Rustaeus S. Lindberg K. Borén J. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28879-28886Google Scholar). Thus it seems that, under certain conditions, the assembly of apoB-100 VLDL involves the following steps: 1) translation and association with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and 2) conversion of the membrane-associated VLDL precursor into VLDL.The microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) catalyzes the transfer of triglycerides, cholesteryl esters, and phospholipids between phospholipid surfaces (8Atzel A. Wetterau J.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10444-10450Google Scholar, 9Jamil H. Dickson Jr., J.K. Chu C.H. Lago M.W. Rinehart J.K. Biller S.A. Gregg R.E. Wetterau J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6549-6554Google Scholar). Mutations that inactivate or abolish MTP give rise to the phenotype of abetalipoproteinemia, an almost total absence of apoB-containing lipoproteins in the plasma (10Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P.

Thus MTP is essential for the assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins (12Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Sharp D. Mullaney D. Yao Z. Gregg R.E. Wetterau J.R. Prc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Very recent results indicate that MTP is important for the early events in the assembly of endogenous rat apoB-48 VLDL. However, MTP was not needed for the addition of the major amount of lipid during the later stages of the apoB-48 VLDL assembly (14Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Gregg R.E. Olofsson S.-O. Borén J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33047-33053Google Scholar). Currently, no direct data describing the role of MTP in the early or late phases of apoB-100 assembly have been reportedThis report describes the results of studies designed to follow the fate of apoB-100 after it associates with the microsomal membrane. The formation of VLDL from this pool of apoB-100 was elucidated by pulse-chase analysis. The role of MTP in this assembly process was determined using the photoactivatable inhibitor BMS-192951.DISCUSSIONPrevious results from our group (21Borén J. Wettesten M. Sjöberg A. Thorlin T. Bondjers G. Wiklund O. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10556-10564Google Scholar), as well as from other investigators (22Thrift R.N. Drisko J. Dueland S. Trawick J.D. Davis R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9161-9165Google Scholar), have indicated that membrane-associated apoB-100 is sorted to degradation. Recently however, we obtained results which indicated that this form of apoB-100 can also be a precursor to VLDL (7Rustaeus S. Lindberg K. Borén J. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28879-28886Google Scholar). In these previous experiments we used BFA to reversibly block the assembly of apoB-100-containing lipoproteins, in particular VLDL. It was demonstrated that BFA caused the association of apoB with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. When the BFA was removed, the cells resumed assembly of apoB-100 VLDL. In this study, we used the same system, but continued to follow the fate of the membrane-associated apoB-100 during a chase in the presence of BFA, under conditions that inhibited the VLDL assembly process. The results showed a clear decrease in the amount of membrane-associated apoB-100. Since no apoB-100 lipoproteins were formed or secreted, these results indicate that the membrane-associated apoB-100 was removed by degradation. Releasing the BFA block, before the membrane-bound apoB-100 was degraded, resulted in formation of apoB-100 VLDL, which was quantitatively recovered in the medium. These results demonstrate that the membrane-associated apoB-100 is a precursor to VLDL. However, when the assembly process is inhibited, this VLDL-precursor will be degraded in the cell. In agreement with our previous results (20Borén J. Rustaeus S. Wettesten M. Andersson M. Wiklund A. Olofsson S.-O. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1743-1754Google Scholar), the present observations indicate that the assembly process plays a critical role in the sorting of apoB-100; apoB-100 that is not recruited to the assembly process will gradually be degraded intracellularly.The physical nature of the membrane-associated apoB-100 is unknown. In this report we demonstrate that the microsomal membranes could be almost completely depleted of apoB-100 by extraction with sodium carbonate together with small amounts of deoxycholate and 1.2m potassium chloride. The concentrations of deoxycholate are well below the critical micellar concentration and have been shown to remove lumenal proteins and peripheral membrane proteins but not integral membrane proteins (18Kreibich G. Debey P. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell. Biol. 1973; 58: 436-462Google Scholar). In an analogous fashion, we observed that the extraction procedure did not significantly influence recovery of membrane proteins from the membrane pellet during the extraction compared with ordinary sodium carbonate extraction. Of interest was that, although a general increase in the recovery of apoB-100 in all density classes was seen, we observed that the major effect of deoxycholate and high salt was to liberate apoB-100 that banded in the HDL and LDL density ranges. We have previously demonstrated the presence of such forms of apoB-100 lipoproteins in sodium carbonate extracts of the microsomes, and we have suggested that the form that bands in the HDL density range (apoB-100 HDL) may be a precursor to less dense apoB-100-containing lipoproteins (15Boström K. Borén J. Wettesten M. Sjöberg A. Bondjers G. Wiklund O. Carlsson P. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4434-4442Google Scholar). Such a precursor role for apoB-100 HDL is supported by the results of the present study (compare Fig. 1). One possibility is that apoB-100 HDL represents a lower percentage of the membrane-associated pool that is released during extraction with carbonate alone, implying that the membrane-associated form of apoB-100 and the carbonate-released dense particles belong to the same pool of apoB-100. This in turn may explain why both the membrane-associated form of apoB-100 (i.e. the carbonate-resistant form) and apoB-100 HDL (i.e. the dense particles extracted by sodium carbonate) appear to be precursors for apoB-100 VLDL (compare Fig. 1).Previous studies have demonstrated that MTP is essential for the assembly of apoB-containing lipoproteins (12Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Sharp D. Mullaney D. Yao Z. Gregg R.E. Wetterau J.R. Prc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7628-7632Google Scholar, 13Leiper J.M. Bayliss J.D. Pease R.J. Brett D.J. Scott J. Shoulders C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21951-21954Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that mutations in the MTP gene give rise to the phenotype of abetalipoproteinemia (10Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Bouma M.-E. Eisenberg C. Munck A. Hermier M. Schmitz G.G. Rader D.J. Gregg R.E. Science. 1992; 258: 999-1001Google Scholar, 11Sharp D. Blinderman L. Combs K.A. Klenzie B. Ricci B. Wager-Smith K. Gil C.M. Turck C.W. Bouma M.-E. Rader D.J. Aggerbeck L.P. Gregg R.E. Gordon D.A. Wetterau J.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 65-69Google Scholar). Despite the fact that MTP is characterized in great detail, relatively little is known about the molecular details of the role of this protein in the assembly of the lipoprotein. An interaction with apoB has been demonstrated (23Wu X. Zhou M. Huang L.-S. Wetterau J. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10277-10281Google Scholar, 24Patel S.B. Grundy S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18686-18694Google Scholar) and suggested to involve the N-terminal globular domain of apoB, which is needed for the action of MTP (25Gretch D.G. Sturley S.L. Wang L. Lipton B.A. Dunning A. Grunwald K.A.A. Wetterau J.R. Yao Z. Talmud P. Attie A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8682-8691Google Scholar, 26Shelness G.S. Thornburg J.T. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 408-419Google Scholar). In a recent study, we demonstrated that MTP is necessary for the early events in the assembly of endogenous apoB-48 VLDL in the McA-RH7777 cells, but does not appear to be essential for the step in which the major amount of lipids was added to the particle (14Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Gregg R.E. Olofsson S.-O. Borén J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33047-33053Google Scholar). In addition, it has recently been shown that inhibition of MTP up to 10 min after a pulse of [35S]methionine blocked the secretion of apoB-100 from HepG2 cells (27Benoist F. Nicodeme E. Grand-Perret T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 713-720Google Scholar). After this time, the MTP inhibitor lost its effect, and apoB secretion was observed. This suggests that, as in the case of apoB-48, MTP also plays a role in the early stages of apoB-100 lipoprotein assembly, but not in the later stages. One drawback with the HepG2 cells is that they do not assemble any substantial amount of bona fide VLDL (20Borén J. Rustaeus S. Wettesten M. Andersson M. Wiklund A. Olofsson S.-O. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1743-1754Google Scholar), but rather an LDL-size particle rich in triacylglycerol. The assembly of this particle occurs to a significant degree cotranslationally (28Borén J. Graham L. Wettesten M. Scott J. White A. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9858-9867Google Scholar).As discussed above, a precursor to apoB-100 VLDL appears to be a membrane-associated form of full-length apoB-100 (7Rustaeus S. Lindberg K. Borén J. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28879-28886Google Scholar). We observed that a photoactivatable MTP inhibitor could block the assembly and secretion of apoB-100 VLDL not only when the inhibitor was photoactivated prior to the labeling of the cells, but also when the photoactivation was carried out after completion of the membrane-associated apoB-100 (a VLDL precursor). This indicates that MTP takes part in the post-translational conversion of membrane-associated apoB-100 to VLDL. Our results also indicate that there is a “window” within which this process is MTP-dependent. This window occurs in BFA-treated cells after translation is complete, but before they have recovered their capacity to assemble and release VLDL particles into the secretory pathway after BFA is withdrawn. This in turn indicates that MTP is not involved in the loading of the major amount of lipid to the particle, but rather in the preparation of apoB-100 for this process. This agrees with our observations that the addition of the major amount of lipid to apoB-48 VLDL occurs in an MTP-independent step (14Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Gregg R.E. Olofsson S.-O. Borén J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33047-33053Google Scholar).The identification of the window during which the assembly process was MTP-dependent was based on BFA-treated cells. To confirm that this was not due to an artifact introduced by the BFA treatment, an alternate strategy was applied. In this case we used CHX to achieve the necessary manipulations. Qualitatively, the results were nearly identical, showing a distinct post-translational window during which apoB-100 lipoprotein assembly was MTP-dependent. However, since the CHX-treated cells, contrary to BFA-treated cells, continue to assemble and secrete apoB-100 VLDL (4Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Google Scholar), the exact time window of MTP dependence cannot be compared.Our results thus indicate that MTP is of importance for the creation of a situation that allows full-length membrane-associated apoB-100 to be assembled into VLDL and secreted. This suggests that an important function of MTP is to prepare apoB-100 for the assembly with the major amount of lipid. The nature of this preparation is a key question that needs to be addressed in future studies; however, possible mechanism can be discussed.The fact that inhibition of MTP mediated lipid transfer has such a profound effect on the assembly process during translation of apoB suggests that MTP is essential for stabilizing the protein during or immediately after translocation, perhaps by facilitating the folding of the protein. It has been pointed out that mature apoB contains large regions of amphipathic structures, in particular long regions of amphipathic β-strands that fold into amphipathic β-sheets (29Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Mishra V.K. Anantharamaiah G.M. Garber D.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1674-1685Google Scholar). The amphipathic β-sheets, that are unique for apoB, are generally believed to mediate the irreversible binding between apoB and the lipoprotein particle (29Segrest J.P. Jones M.K. Mishra V.K. Anantharamaiah G.M. Garber D.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1674-1685Google Scholar). It could be speculated that these amphipathic structures require MTP-mediated lipid transfer to fold correctly to form a structure capable of receiving the bulk of the core neutral lipid. In the absence of MTP, these structures would misfold leading to the degradation of the apoB polypeptide.The observation that MTP is also needed after the completion of apoB-100 could suggest that portions of the protein remains unfolded after the translation of the protein. There is a possibility that at least part of apoB-100 is post-translationally translocated to the lumenal side of the membrane (20Borén J. Rustaeus S. Wettesten M. Andersson M. Wiklund A. Olofsson S.-O. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1743-1754Google Scholar, 30Davis R.A. Thrift R.N. Wu C.C. Howell K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10005-10011Google Scholar, 31Dixon J.L. Chattapadhyay R. Huima T. Redman C.M. Banerjee D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1161-1169Google Scholar). MTP may participate in such a translocation indirectly by allowing this part of the protein to properly fold as it enters the interior of the endoplasmic reticulum. In this way the protein may acquire a structure that allows it to interact with the downstream VLDL assembly process. It should, however, be kept in mind that the association between apoB-100 and the microsomal membrane is not completely understood. Contradictory results have appeared in the literature concerning the exposure of apoB-100 on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (17Boström K. Wettesten M. Borén J. Bondjers G. Wiklund O. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13800-13806Google Scholar, 20Borén J. Rustaeus S. Wettesten M. Andersson M. Wiklund A. Olofsson S.-O. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1743-1754Google Scholar,30Davis R.A. Thrift R.N. Wu C.C. Howell K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10005-10011Google Scholar, 31Dixon J.L. Chattapadhyay R. Huima T. Redman C.M. Banerjee D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1161-1169Google Scholar, 32Shelness G.S. Morris-Rogers K.C. Ingram M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9310-9318Google Scholar, 33Pease R.J. Harrison G.B. Scott J. Nature. 1991; 353: 448-450Google Scholar). An alternative explanation is that apoB-100 is completely translocated cotranslationally (like ordinary secretory proteins) and that the folding of the C terminus occurs post-translationally, involving chaperone proteins in addition to MTP. The observation that the tentative membrane-associated precursor could be extracted under conditions that have been shown not to extract integral membrane proteins (18Kreibich G. Debey P. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell. Biol. 1973; 58: 436-462Google Scholar) (verified in this study) would favor the possibility that apoB-100 is more loosely associated with the membrane than is an integral protein. This does not rule out a transmembrane orientation mediated by chaperones or membrane channels. It should be remembered that the translocation channel Sec 61 has recently been demonstrated to participate not only in the translocation of proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum lumen but also in the retraction of lumenal protein for degradation by proteasomes (see, for example, Cresswell and Hughes (34Cresswell P. Hughes E.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 552-555Google Scholar) for a review and references therein).Together our data suggest a model for the assembly of apoB-100 VLDL. According to this model, apoB-100 is translated and at least partially translocated into a membrane-associated VLDL precursor form. This process is highly dependent on MTP. The assembly of VLDL from this precursor pool occurs first in an MTP-dependent step during which an immediate VLDL precursor is formed. The final step(s) is MTP-independent and allows the major amount of lipids to be loaded onto the protein. There exist two forms of apolipoprotein B (apoB), 1The abbreviations used are: apoB, apolipoprotein B; BFA, brefeldin A; CHX, cycloheximide; HDL, high density lipoproteins; LDL, low density lipoproteins; MTP, the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein; VLDL, very low density lipoproteins.1The abbreviations used are: apoB, apolipoprotein B; BFA, brefeldin A; CHX, cycloheximide; HDL, high density lipoproteins; LDL, low density lipoproteins; MTP, the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein; VLDL, very low density lipoproteins. apoB-100 and apoB-48 (1Kane J.P. Hardman D.A. Paulus H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2465-2469Google Scholar, 2Kane J.P. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1983; 45: 637-650Google Scholar). In humans apoB-100 is expressed in the liver, while apoB-48 is synthesized in the intestine (3Glickman R.M. Rogers M. Glickman J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5296-5300Google Scholar). In some animals, such as the rat, both proteins are expressed in the liver. When expressed in liver, both apoB-100 and apoB-48 assemble into VLDL particles (4Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Google Scholar, 5Sjöberg A. Oscarsson J. Borén J. Edén S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Lipid. Res. 1996; 37: 275-289Google Scholar). When expressed in the intestine, they both have the capacity to assemble into chylomicrons (6Farese R.V. Véniant M.M. Cham C.M. Flynn L.M. Pierotti V. Loring J.F. Traber M. Ruland S. Stokowski R.S. Huszar D. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6393-6398Google Scholar). Lipoprotein assembly is a complex process that is not yet understood in all detail. The availability of the McA-RH7777 rat hepatoma cell line, which assembles bona fide VLDL (4Borén J. Rustaeus S. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25879-25888Google Scholar), has facilitated studies of this process. In addition, we have recently demonstrated that brefeldin A (BFA) reversibly inhibits the assembly of all apoB-100 lipoproteins, in particular VLDL (7Rustaeus S. Lindberg K. Borén J. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28879-28886Google Scholar). During BFA treatment, apoB-100 appeared in a non-VLDL form that pelleted with the microsomal membrane after sodium carbonate extraction of the lumenal content of the microsomes (7Rustaeus S. Lindberg K. Borén J. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28879-28886Google Scholar). Since it was possible to remove the BFA and reactivate the assembly process, we were able to demonstrate that this membrane-associated form of apoB-100 can be a precursor to apoB-100 VLDL (7Rustaeus S. Lindberg K. Borén J. Olofsson S.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28879-28886Google Scholar). Thus it seems that, under certain conditions, the assembly of apoB-100 VLDL involves the following steps: 1) translation and association with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and 2) conversion of the membrane-associated VLDL precursor into VLDL. The microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) catalyzes the transfer of triglycerides, cholesteryl esters, and phospholipids between phospholipid surfaces (8Atzel A. Wetterau J.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10444-10450Google Scholar, 9Jamil H. Dickson Jr., J.K. Chu C.H. Lago M.W. Rinehart J.K. Biller S.A. Gregg R.E. Wetterau J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6549-6554Google Scholar). Mutations that inactivate or abolish MTP give rise to the phenotype of abetalipoproteinemia, an almost total absence of apoB-containing lipoproteins in the plasma (10Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P.

Thus MTP is essential for the assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins (12Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Sharp D. Mullaney D. Yao Z. Gregg R.E. Wetterau J.R. Prc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Very recent results indicate that MTP is important for the early events in the assembly of endogenous rat apoB-48 VLDL. However, MTP was not needed for the addition of the major amount of lipid during the later stages of the apoB-48 VLDL assembly (14Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Gregg R.E. Olofsson S.-O. Borén J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33047-33053Google Scholar).

The Rho family of GTPases play a key role in mediating cell motility and adhesion through dynamic regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, members of this family have other diverse roles, including signaling to stress-activated MAP kinase modules, control of membrane traffic, and regulation of the generation of lipid second messengers (1Machesky L.M. Hall A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 304-310Google Scholar, 2Ridley A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1256-1263Google Scholar). The downstream signaling pathways from Rho GTPases are largely unknown. Recently, progress has been made in several laboratories with the identification of a large number of candidate Rho effectors. The challenge now is to assign these effector proteins to the various Rho signaling pathways. We have investigated the cellular role of one such candidate Rho effector, the PRK1 (PKN) 1To avoid confusion with the earlier description of the nerve growth factor-activated kinase “PKN,” the nomenclature employed here will be PRK throughout. protein kinase. PRK1 has been shown previously to interact with the RhoA GTPase (3Amano M. Mukai H. Ono Y. Chihara K. Matsui T. Hamajima K. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 271: 648-650Google Scholar, 4Watanabe G. Saito Y. Madaule P. Ishizaki T. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Mukai H. Ono Y. Kakizuka A. Narumiya S. Science. 1996; 271: 645-648Google Scholar). We have been unable to demonstrate a role for PRK1 in RhoA signaling. However, we show here that PRK1 is targeted to the endosomal compartment by another member of the Rho GTPase family, RhoB. There is increasing evidence for a role for Rho family GTPases in the control of intracellular trafficking. While the localization of the RhoB GTPase to endosomes is well described, the pathways downstream of this signaling protein are totally obscure. Our findings indicate that RhoB acts through the PRK1 kinase and suggest a role for PRK1 in the control of endosomal traffic.

Mammalian expression vector constructs were generated in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) using standard methods. Truncated PRK1 constructs PTS-3 and PTS-6 comprised amino acids 294–943 and 1–307 of PRK1, respectively, and contained a C-terminal HA-epitope tag. A GTPase-deficient RhoB construct, RhoB-QL, was engineered by using oligonucleotide-based site-directed mutagenesis with the Chamelion System (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions, to change Gln-63 to Leu. A dominant negative RhoB construct, RhoB-TN, was made by using the same methodology to change Thr-19 to Asn. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Swiss 3T3 cells were microinjected with mammalian expression vectors and prepared for indirect immunofluorescence as described previously (5Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Google Scholar). 293 cells were transfected using standard calcium phosphate-mediated transfer and were processed for immunofluorescence 36 h later. The cells were fixed for 15 min in 4% fresh paraformaldehyde in PBS and then washed with PBS and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. The cells were washed again in PBS and then incubated for 10 min in 0.1% sodium borohydride in PBS. The cells were then washed twice with PBS, once with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and then incubated for 1 h with the primary antibody diluted 1:200 in PBS with 1% BSA. The cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated for 1 h with the secondary antibody diluted 1:200 in PBS. The cells were then washed three times in PBS and mounted under MOWIOL 4–88 (Calbiochem) containing 0.6% 1,4-diazabicyclo-(2.2.2)octane as an antiphotobleaching agent. The cells were viewed using a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope, and the images were captured by a cooled charge-coupled device (Photometrics). The captured images were processed using the Spectrum software package (IP Laboratories). 293 cells were co-transfected with PRK1 and expression vectors containing various myc epitope-tagged Rho protein constructs. Cells were harvested 36 h after transfection, in cell lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm sodium vanadate, 100 nm okadaic acid, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and precleared by incubation with 0.1% (v/v) insoluble protein A for 20 min. The extracts were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were taken and incubated with 4 μg of 9E10 antibody each for 20 min, tumbling at 4 °C. The extracts were then incubated for a further 1 h with 20-μl packed volume of protein G-Sepharose, tumbling at 4 °C. The Sepharose beads were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C, washed three times in 1 ml of cell lysis buffer, and then the bound protein was solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Endosomal fractions were prepared from 293 cells by sedimentation on discontinuous sucrose gradients as described previously (6Gorvel J.P. Escola J.M. Stang E. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2741-2746Google Scholar). Fractions (500 μl) were removed from the top of the gradient and diluted 3-fold with ice-cold harvesting buffer (3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 nm okadaic acid). The membranes were then pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. For gel electrophoresis the membranes were then solubilized in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The distribution of endosomal membranes on the gradient was determined by incubating cells prior to harvest in medium containing 1 mg/ml horseradish peroxidase for 5 min, followed by a chase in horseradish peroxidase-free media. Chase times were 0 min for early endosomes, 25 min for late endosomes, and 110 min for lysosomes (6Gorvel J.P. Escola J.M. Stang E. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2741-2746Google Scholar). Sucrose gradient fractions were solubilized in 1 ml of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and assayed for horseradish peroxidase activity using ς-dianisidine as a substrate in a spectrophotometric assay. PRK1 has been shown to bind activated RhoA and is therefore a candidate RhoA effector. We sought to define a possible role for PRK1 in RhoA signaling through overexpression studies. Overexpression of PRK1 caused no stimulation of two well established RhoA pathways, the formation of actin stress fibers or the activation of the serum response element (data not shown). However, these studies revealed a distinctive subcellular localization pattern of PRK1. When expressed in Swiss 3T3 cells, PRK1 showed a diffuse cytoplasmic staining pattern in most cells (Fig. 1 A). However, at later times following microinjection, a subset (approximately 5–10%) of cells showed a punctate staining pattern, suggestive of a vesicular localization (Fig. 1 B). RhoA is found largely in the cytoplasm with a small amount of protein present at the plasma membrane (7Adamson P. Paterson H.F. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 617-627Google Scholar). In contrast the RhoB GTPase has been shown to be localized exclusively to the endosomal compartment (7Adamson P. Paterson H.F. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 617-627Google Scholar). The punctate pattern of PRK1 staining raised the possibility of a functional coupling of PRK1 and RhoB. This was investigated in HEK 293 cells, chosen in part for their low levels of endogenous RhoB in comparison with Swiss 3T3 cells (data not shown). PRK1 overexpressed in 293 cells shows a diffuse cytoplasmic staining pattern with no apparent vesicular localization (Fig. 2 A). However, when co-expressed with RhoB, the PRK1 was translocated to the RhoB compartment, indicating that RhoB does indeed target PRK1 to endosomes (Fig. 2, C and D). In agreement with previous studies in other cell types, overexpressed RhoA was largely cytosolic in HEK 293 cells. Co-expression of RhoA with PRK1 did not result in the localization of either protein to endosomes or any other membrane compartment (data not shown).Figure 2Co-localization of PRK1 and RhoB by fluorescence microscopy. 293 cells were transfected with PRK1 (A), RhoB (B), PRK1 and RhoB (C and D).

Mukai H. Inagaki Y. Homma Y. Kimura K. Kaibuchi K. Narumiya S. Ono Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 221-224Google Scholar). We examined whether this domain also mediates the targeting of PRK1 to endosomes by RhoB. The PRK1 HR1 domain expressed on its own showed a broad cytoplasmic distribution (Fig. 3 A). Its overexpression caused an increase in the number of multinucleate cells in the transfected population. This suggests that this construct had a dominant-negative effect on Rho activity, since inhibition of Rho function has been shown to block cell division (9Moorman J.P. Bobak D.A. Hahn C.S. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4146-4153Google Scholar). Co-expression of the HR1 domain with RhoB caused a translocation of the HR1 polypeptide to the endosomal compartment (Fig. 3, B and C). Moreover, a PRK1 truncation mutant which lacks the HR1 domain failed to localize to endosomes with RhoB (Fig. 3, E and F). Taken together, these data show that the HR1 domain is both necessary and sufficient for the targeting of PRK1 to endosomes by RhoB. We examined the cellular interaction of RhoB and PRK1 further using mutant Rho proteins. The Rho proteins were co-expressed in 293 cells with PRK1 and then isolated by immunoprecipitation. The presence of any associated PRK1 was detected by Western blotting. The activated mutants of RhoA and RhoB were seen to form an association with PRK1 in cells that was stable to extraction (Fig. 4). Although there was some variation in the level of expression of the various Rho proteins in cells, the interaction with RhoA appeared to be qualitatively similar to that with RhoB. PRK1 fulfilled the criteria required of a RhoB effector in that it formed a stable association with the activated RhoB-QL mutant but not with the wild-type protein or with the dominant-negative RhoB-TN mutant (Fig. 4). The failure of PRK1 to co-immunoprecipitate with wild-type RhoB would seem to be at variance with translocation of PRK1 to endosomes by wild-type RhoB observed by immunofluorescence. We have shown recently that PRK1 makes two interactions with the RhoA GTPase: a weak interaction through the PRK1 HR1b motif, which is not dependent on GTP-loading of RhoA, and a strong interaction through the PRK1 HR1a motif, which requires activated (GTP-loaded) RhoA (10Flynn P. Mellor H. Palmer R. Panayotou G. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2698-2705Google Scholar). It would seem likely that a similar situation occurs with RhoB and that a weak interaction with wild-type RhoB is sufficient to target PRK1 to endosomes. Indeed, the activated RhoB-QL mutant is no better than the wild-type protein at translocating PRK1 to endosomes as judged by immunofluorescence (data not shown). The weak interaction would then survive the procedures involved in preparing cells for immunofluorescence (which involves a rapid fixation step), but not the more stringent immunoprecipitation protocol where only the strong, GTP-dependent interaction is observed. Overexpression studies can sometimes yield anomalous results. As the RhoB and PRK1 antibodies are not good enough to detect endogenous proteins by immunofluorescence, we determined the subcellular localization of endogenous PRK1 and RhoB in 293 cells by cell fractionation. Crude cell membranes were purified by centrifugation on a discontinuous sucrose gradient, optimized for the isolation of endosomes (6Gorvel J.P. Escola J.M. Stang E. Bakke O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2741-2746Google Scholar). Endosomes were isolated as a single peak on these gradients (Fraction 5) as determined by quantifying the distribution of endocytosed horseradish peroxidase marker (data not shown). By following a time course of horseradish peroxidase uptake, it was seen that Fraction 5 contained both early and late endosomes (data not shown). The gradient fractions were analyzed for distribution of endogenous RhoB and PRK1. Although endogenous RhoB could not be detected by Western blotting in crude 293 cell lysates, it could be readily detected after enrichment by sucrose gradient fractionation, and it was seen to be present solely in the endosomal fraction (Fig. 5 B). Endogenous PRK1 was distributed in two peaks on the gradient (Fig. 5 A), one of which was in the endosomal fraction coinciding with the distribution of endogenous RhoB. This suggests that the targeting of PRK1 to endosomes by RhoB is not simply a consequence of overexpression of these proteins. PRK1 protein was also seen in the heavier (40.6% sucrose) fractions. These fractions were of particular interest as the PRK1 showed the presence of additional, slower migrating forms on SDS-PAGE. PRK1 has been shown to become heavily phosphorylated upon activation (11Peng B. Morrice N.A. Groenen L.C. Wettenhall R.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32233-32240Google Scholar), and these slower migrating species appear to correspond to hyperphosphorylated forms of the enzyme. 3P. Flynn and P. J. Parker, unpublished data. The slowest migrating form of PRK1 was present in Fraction 10 from the gradient, which contains insoluble cytoskeletal proteins. PRK1 has been shown to interact with the intermediate filament protein, vimentin (12Mukai H. Toshimori M. Shibata H. Kitagawa M. Shimakawa M. Miyahara M. Sunakawa H. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9816-9822Google Scholar). We therefore determined the distribution of vimentin in the sucrose gradient fractions. Interestingly, vimentin was seen to be concentrated in Fraction 10 (data not shown), suggesting the possibility that the PRK1 associated with this intermediate filament component in vivo may be hyperphosphorylated. Finally, we determined what effect overexpression of RhoB would have on the localization of endogenous PRK1. Overexpression of RhoB caused a highly reproducible increase in the amount of endogenous PRK1 associated with the endosome fraction (Fig. 5 C). Interestingly, the endogenous PRK1 that was recruited to this compartment appeared to be composed of a single, slower migrating form of the kinase on SDS-PAGE. This suggests that activation of PRK1 occurs on translocation. Similar results were observed with the overexpression of the constitutively active RhoB-QL mutant (data not shown). The efficiency of transfection of the 293 cells in these experiments was estimated to be approximately 20%. Although the level of RhoB expression in these cells is very high, the experiment samples the whole cell population, so the translocation of endogenous PRK1 is only about 20% of that which would be observed if 100% of the cells were transfected. There is increasing evidence for an involvement of Rho GTPases in endocytosis (2Ridley A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1256-1263Google Scholar). Although RhoB has been shown to be restricted in its localization to endosomes, both by immunofluorescence (7Adamson P. Paterson H.F. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 617-627Google Scholar) and electron microscopy (13Robertson D. Paterson H.F. Adamson P. Hall A. Monaghan P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 471-480Google Scholar), its function in cell trafficking in unknown. The elucidation of the cellular function of other Rho family members has come with the identification of downstream effectors. Presently, the signaling pathways downstream from RhoB are totally obscure. In this study we have shown that PRK1 interacts with activated RhoB through its HR1 domain and is targeted to the endosomes. This translocation leads to a decreased mobility of PRK1 on SDS-PAGE, indicating phosphorylation and activation of the PRK1 kinase. Taken together, these data suggest that PRK1 is the downstream effector of RhoB and executes Rho-mediated control of endocytosis.

Rather, the kcat is reduced, proposing that these hydrophobic residues are required for a fine tuning of the redox partners in the initial collisional complex to obtain a configuration optimal for electron transfer. Electron transfer between redox proteins has been under extensive investigation during the last years. The protein surfaces involved in complex formation have been of particular interest as it became clear that electron transfer depends on specific recognition with an affinity low enough to allow rapid dissociation. Several studies with cytochromec and its different redox partners demonstrated the involvement of electrostatic interactions mediated by lysines surrounding the heme edge on cytochrome c and acidic residues on the counterpart (1Staudenmayer N. Ng S. Smith M.B. Millet F. Biochemistry. 1997; 16: 600-604Google Scholar, 2Ferguson-Miller S. Brautigan D. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 149-159Google Scholar, 3Rieder R. Bosshard H.R. J.

Nevertheless, it became obvious from ionic strength dependence measurements that electrostatic interactions are not the only criterion governing optimal electron transfer (2Ferguson-Miller S. Brautigan D. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 149-159Google Scholar). The bell-shaped dependence of activity on ionic strength lead to the proposal that at low ionic strength the redox partners lack the conformational flexibility to achieve a configuration optimal for electron transfer (7Tollin G. Hazzard J.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 287: 1-7Google Scholar, 8Meyer T.E. Zhao Z.G. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4552-4559Google Scholar) besides the fact that product dissociation becomes rate-limiting. At high ionic strength the rate of non-productive collisions increases due to the shielding of charges. Around the ionic strength optimum, when long range electrostatic forces have roughly aligned the reacting proteins, configurational freedom still prevails for short range forces such as hydrophobic interaction to contribute significantly to a configuration optimal for electron transfer.Cytochrome-c oxidase (cytochrome aa3; EC 1.9.3.1) (for reviews see Refs. 9Gennis R.B.

The three main subunits of cytochrome aa3 show significant homology to the mitochondrially encoded subunits of the eukaryotic cytochrome oxidase. Heme a and the binuclear center (heme a3·CuB) are located in subunit I, whereas the CuA center which is the primary electron acceptor resides in subunit II. As stated above, the involvement of electrostatic interactions in the reaction between cytochrome c and cytochrome-c oxidase mediated by acidic residues predominantly located on subunit II of the P. denitrificans oxidase has already been demonstrated (6Witt H. Malatesta F. Nicoletti F. Brunori M. Ludwig B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 367-373Google Scholar).To investigate the contribution of hydrophobic residues to the electron transfer reaction, we analyzed the interaction domain on subunit II of cytochrome-c oxidase for exposed residues. From the crystal structures of oxidase (13Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H. Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Google Scholar, 14Tsukihara T. Aoyama H. Yamashita E. Tomizaki T. Yamaguchi H.

We mutated residues in 4 positions and investigated the isolated mutant enzymes W121Q, Y122S, Y122K, I117Q, and L137Q by burst (stopped-flow) and steady-state kinetics. Results indicate that Trp-121 is the electron entry site to the oxidase. Comparison of the kinetic parameters reveals that the initial binding of cytochrome c, as reflected by KM, is not affected by the mutations but the electron transfer is impaired, suggesting that an optimal configuration cannot be achieved in the mutant enzymes.MATERIALS AND METHODSP. denitrificans strain ST4 is a deletion mutant (16Steinrücke P. Gerhus E. Ludwig B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7676-7681Google Scholar) lacking the heme aa3 cytochrome oxidase; it is complemented in trans with the cta operon conveying the different mutations in subunit II. For enzyme purification, strains were grown on succinate medium (17Ludwig B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 126: 153-159Google Scholar) including streptomycin (25 μg/ml).Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the altered sites mutagenesis protocol (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany).Enzyme preparation was performed as described (18Hendler R.W. Pardhasaradi K. Reynafarje B. Ludwig B. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 415-423Google Scholar) with membranes solubilized with n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside according to Ref. 19Gerhus E. Steinrücke P. Ludwig B. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2392-2400Google Scholar. Protein determination, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotting, and cytochrome oxidase spectra were carried out as described (5Witt H. Zickermann V. Ludwig B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 74-76Google Scholar).Steady-state activity of oxidase was assayed spectrophotometrically in 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 g/liter dodecyl maltoside, and either 20 or 40 mm KCl at 25 °C. The oxidation of reduced cytochrome c (horse heart, Sigma) was followed at 550 nm with the concentration varied between 0.5 and 40 μm after addition of purified enzyme (40–400 pm). The ionic strength dependence was assayed under the same conditions with the ionic strength adjusted to between 1.8 (2 mm Tris/HCl) and 296 mm by addition of KCl.Stopped-flow kinetics were performed on a thermostated Applied Photophysics DX.17MV stopped-flow (Leatherhead, UK) at 20 °C in 20 mm KPi (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 g/liter dodecyl maltoside and KCl to obtain a final ionic strength of 140 mm. Cytochrome oxidase (between 6 and 10 μm) was mixed 1:1 with reduced cytochrome c(4–32 μm) and the reaction followed as the oxidation of cytochrome c at 550 nm or the reduction of heme a at 605 nm. The average of three independent measurements was fitted to the sum of two exponentials, and the pseudo-first-order rate constantkobs of the fast phase was plotted against the cytochrome concentration. From the slope, the bimolecular rate constantkon was calculated.RESULTSBy applying standard site-directed mutagenesis techniques, we constructed several mutants in subunit II of cytochrome oxidase to investigate the contribution of hydrophobic residues to the interaction with cytochrome c. The mutant enzymes W121Q, Y122S, Y122K, L137Q, and I117Q were isolated and investigated by steady-state and presteady-state kinetics. We also monitored the ionic strength dependence of the mutants in comparison to the wild type.Burst KineticsThe electron entry to cyanide-inhibited oxidase, used to prevent turnover, was monitored by following the oxidation of reduced cytochrome c. The time course was fitted by the sum of two exponentials, and the derived pseudo-first-order rate constant kobs of the fast phase was plotted against the cytochrome cconcentration. The apparent bimolecular rate constantkon was calculated from the slope, and the results are presented in Table I. Substitution of Tyr-122 by Ser does not affect the bimolecular rate constant, yielding a value comparable with the wild type, whereas mutation against Lys drastically reduces kon to about one-tenth. This difference is most likely due to the introduction of a positively charged residue although sterical constraints cannot be excluded. The kon of I117Q is slightly increased, whereas that of L137Q is decreased to about one-fourth compared with wild type. Strikingly, no electron entry at concentrations lower than 100 μm cytochrome ccould be measured when Trp-121 was mutated to Gln, yielding strong evidence that Trp-121 is the actual electron entry site to cytochrome oxidase (Fig. 1). It seems that under these experimental conditions, the exchange of hydrophobic residues against hydrophilic ones has very different effects. Besides the fact that one of the mutated residues serves as the entry to the oxidase, the others obviously contribute to the interaction to different degrees.Table ICytochrome c oxidation by cyanide-inhibited oxidasekon× 106 m−1 s−1Wild type7.6W121Q(kobs= 0.04 s−1)1-aNo determination of the bimolecular rate constant was possible; the observed pseudo-first-order rate constant is given instead; see also Fig. 1.Y122S6Y122K0.71L137Q1.75I117Q13.51-a No determination of the bimolecular rate constant was possible; the observed pseudo-first-order rate constant is given instead; see also Fig. 1.

When data were analyzed in a Lineweaver-Burk plot, two phases could be distinguished, each characterized by a KM and akcat value resulting in a high and a low affinity phase as observed earlier (5Witt H. Zickermann V. Ludwig B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 74-76Google Scholar, 20Ferguson-Miller S. Brautigan D. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1104-1115Google Scholar). The parameters for the high affinity phase are presented in Table II. The absolute KM values for the wild type are 1.3 μm at I = 36 mm and 4.5 μmat I = 56 mm.

Haight G.P. Kamen M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 113-117Google Scholar, 22Garber E.A.E. Margoliash E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1015: 279-287Google Scholar). We suppose from our earlier investigations that this holds at least for the condition of I = 56 mm (6Witt H. Malatesta F. Nicoletti F. Brunori M. Ludwig B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 367-373Google Scholar). At lower ionic strength, product dissociation seems to be one of the rate-limiting factors, and therefore interpretation of KM, although less straightforward, nevertheless provides a good indication of the affinity. It is obvious that the dissociation constants (Michaelis constants) of Y122S, L137Q, and I117Q are virtually identical to that of the wild type, indicating that the affinity of the oxidase for cytochrome c has not changed. In contrast, the KM of Y122K is significantly increased demonstrating a reduced affinity. As already indicated by the burst experiments, this can probably be attributed to the introduction of a bulky and positively charged residue.The different contributions to the interaction with cytochromec are evident from the comparison of the catalytic constantkcat. All mutants and the wild type show an increased catalytic constant at I = 56 mm compared with I = 36 mm. W121Q displays a drastically reducedkcat compared with wild type (around 1% at I = 56 mm) just like Y122K, although these results may be attributed to different effects. The three remaining mutants (with unaltered affinity) show a varying decrease in their catalytic constants. Again, like in the burst experiment, L137Q is affected to the highest degree, followed by Y122S and I117Q revealing the smallest deviation from wild type.Ionic Strength Dependence of the Turnover Number of OxidaseThe interaction between several redox proteins was shown to be ionic strength-dependent as a result of the electrostatic forces driving complex formation. Introduction of a charged residue on the interacting surface should be experimentally detectable, whereas mutation of hydrophobic ones against uncharged hydrophilic ones should not. Fig. 2presents the effects of ionic strength on the turnover number of the Tyr-122 mutants. As expected, Y122S reveals a similar profile as wild type but with a decreased rate over the whole range. In contrast, the optimum of Y122K is significantly shifted toward lower ionic strength, and at the same time this mutant displays a drastically reduced activity. The profile of I117Q is virtually identical to wild type with reduced activity in the low ionic strength region up to the optimum and only slightly lower turnover numbers at higher ionic strength. Likewise, no shift of the optimum, but a reduced activity is seen for L137Q, whereas W121Q lacks an actual optimum between 36 and 56 mm (data not shown).Figure 2Ionic strength dependence of wild type and two Tyr-122 mutant oxidases.

Nevertheless, from several investigations and structural data derived from co-crystals with other redox proteins (see Introduction), the involvement of additional factors such as hydrophobic interactions was postulated.Analysis of the docking site on subunit II of oxidase (6Witt H.

Nature. 1995; 376: 660-669Google Scholar) revealed several surface-exposed hydrophobic residues. For mutagenesis, we chose four positions because of their location within the acidic patch; in addition, two of them are highly conserved aromatic amino acids. Ile-117, Trp-121, and Leu-137 were mutated to Gln, whereas Tyr-122 was exchanged against Ser and Lys. The purified enzymes containing single mutations were investigated by burst experiments and steady-state kinetics.It is obvious from the burst experiment that electrons enter the W121Q mutant oxidase only very slowly under the given conditions (I = 140 mm). Determination of the apparent bimolecular rate constant kon was impossible as no electron entry was detectable below 100 μm cytochrome c. We therefore conclude that Trp-121 is the electron entry site to cytochrome oxidase. This is in accordance with theoretical simulations. 1L. Dutton, personal communication. An electron was placed on CuA and allowed to reach a surface residue. The rate of transfer was calculated and was highest for Trp-121, although, with a much slower rate, residues in close proximity could also be reached. This could explain the residual activity we observe for W121Q in the steady-state experiments, when we assume different tunneling paths for the electron to arrive at CuA although with drastically different probabilities. There is no indication that an aromatic residue at this position is an essential prerequisite for enzyme function as has been postulated previously (23Overholtzer M.H. Yakowec P.S. Cameron V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7719-7724Google Scholar); however, from a theoretical point of view, non-aromatic residues are capable of accepting electrons as well. We exclude any serious sterical constraints due to the exchange of Trp against Gln in particular since the molecular volume of Gln is even slightly smaller than that of Trp (24Caffrey M.S. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 622-630Google Scholar). At present, we cannot decide whether in the W121Q mutant enzyme electron transfer through this residue is only diminished or whether it is completely blocked and a neighboring residue such as Tyr-122 takes over this function, accounting for the 1% residual activity. In addition, the burst experiments employed cyanide-inhibited oxidase, whereas for the steady-state measurements the enzyme was in turnover. If the inhibition at the binuclear site was sensed by CuA, the barrier for an electron to enter the oxidase should be higher under these conditions.An additional argument for the role of Trp-121 is the lack of a genuine ionic strength optimum. Although a precise orientation of cytochromec, which is critically dependent on the salt concentration, is of great importance for activity in wild type and the other mutants, this criterion seems to be negligible for W121Q.Trp-121 is located about 5 Å above the CuA site and, interestingly, is conserved not only among cytochrome oxidases (mitochondrial and bacterial, with the exception of Bacillus subtilis where it is replaced by Tyr) but also among quinol oxidases. A role in electron transfer of these aromatic residues has already been proposed long ago (25Buse G. Steffens G.J. Steffens G.C.M. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1978; 359: 1011-1013Google Scholar, 26Millett F. de Jong C. Paulson L. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 546-552Google Scholar).Tyr-122 protruding from the surface close to Trp-121 is also highly conserved among cytochrome oxidases but is replaced by Lys in quinol oxidases. However, exchanging Tyr-122 against Lys in the cytochrome oxidase has drastic consequences concerning the activity as well as the affinity for cytochrome c visualized by the increasedKM. The initial docking reaction of oxidase with cytochrome c relies on electrostatic interaction which is mediated by several glutamates and aspartates clustered in negatively charged patches on subunits I and II. Introduction of a positively charged residue not only disrupts the electrostatic potential but probably leads to repulsion of the positively charged patch on cytochrome c and thereby prevents the association of the redox partners; in addition, steric effects of the lysine residue may have to be considered which could increase the redox center distance. Moreover, the positive charge in close proximity to the electron entry site could have some influence on the electron transfer. Mutation against Ser at this position does not affect the initial binding reaction (KM unchanged) but decreases the activity. We therefore assume this residue to play a role in the fine tuning of both partners necessary for optimal electron transfer. The interesting question still remains why this position is occupied by Lys in quinol oxidases whereas other aromatic side chains in this area, Trp-121, Trp-123, Tyr-125, and Tyr-127, are strictly conserved; however, the three latter residues are not surface-exposed. With the vastly different nature of both substrates in the two different classes of oxidases, substrate interaction and electron entry pathways must be drastically different in quinol and cytochrome-c oxidases, as evidenced by the complete loss of acidic, cytochrome cbinding residues in quinol oxidases during evolution (27Castresana J. Lübben M. Saraste M. Higgins D.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2516-2525Google Scholar).Ile and Leu have an almost identical side chain volume and no difference in hydrophobic free energy (24Caffrey M.S. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 622-630Google Scholar); replacement of Ile-117 and Leu-137 by Gln from this point of view should lead to similar effects. This is actually not the case; L137Q displays a strongly reduced activity whereas I117Q is in the range of wild type. The differences of both mutations can most likely be attributed to their different spatial position. Like Y122S, the affinity of the mutant enzymes for cytochromec remains unchanged, arguing against a function in the initial docking reaction which we showed to be mediated through long range electrostatic forces (6Witt H. Malatesta F. Nicoletti F. Brunori M. Ludwig B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 367-373Google Scholar). The lowered electron transfer rate is evidence that in the subsequent step following initial recognition, these residues contribute to the rearrangement of the proteins as a prerequisite for efficient electron transfer. This fine tuning means that hydrophobic residues stabilize an energetically favorable conformation representing a more specific complex than that formed in the initial encounter. The conformational equilibrium between this initial encounter complex and the subsequent electron transfer complex might be described by an equilibrium binding constant, as already postulated in general (28Davidson V.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14035-14039Google Scholar) and for other proteins (29Harris T.K. Davidson V.L. Chen L. Mathews F.S. Xia Z.-X. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12600-12608Google Scholar). This constant contributes to the electron transfer rate; assuming that the various mutations alter the equilibrium between the initial encounter complex and the electron transfer complex, this would be reflected in a change of this equilibrium constant thereby reducing the rate constant to different degrees.ConclusionWe have demonstrated that hydrophobic residues play an important role in the docking reaction between cytochrome-c and cytochrome oxidase, in addition to the contribution of charged amino acids. We suggest a two-step model for oxidase, in which long range electrostatic forces (varying with 1/r 2) dominate the diffusional encounter, followed by a short range hydrophobic interaction for closer apposition (7Tollin G. Hazzard J.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 287: 1-7Google Scholar, 30Bendall D.S. Bendall D.S. Protein Electron Transfer. BIOS Scientific Publishers, Oxford1996: 43-68Google Scholar). Our results on the structure of the interaction domain are in line with the analysis of docking surfaces on electron transfer proteins by Williams et al. (31Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Leung Y.-C. Chan C. Moir J.W.B. Howlett G. Ferguson S.J. Radford S.E. Hajdu J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 975-982Google Scholar) who proposed “pseudo-specific” surface patches comprised of hydrophobic and charged residues. However, the sequence of events is at variance with their model which implies promiscuity in the primary docking mediated by hydrophobic residues requiring further stabilization by charged residues of a complex efficient in electron transfer (31Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Leung Y.-C. Chan C. Moir J.W.B. Howlett G. Ferguson S.J. Radford S.E. Hajdu J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 975-982Google Scholar). The pseudo-specificity would also account for the fact that a single redox protein is capable of reacting with several other partners.The results presented here together with those from a preceding paper (6Witt H. Malatesta F. Nicoletti F. Brunori M. Ludwig B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 367-373Google Scholar) define the docking site for cytochrome c on the oxidase. The acidic residues are organized in an extended, negatively charged cluster interspersed with hydrophobic residues (Fig. 3). We also conclude that our results are valid for other oxidases, including the mitochondrial enzyme, where these acidic and hydrophobic residues are either identical or exchanged conservatively. Electron transfer between redox proteins has been under extensive investigation during the last years. The protein surfaces involved in complex formation have been of particular interest as it became clear that electron transfer depends on specific recognition with an affinity low enough to allow rapid dissociation. Several studies with cytochromec and its different redox partners demonstrated the involvement of electrostatic interactions mediated by lysines surrounding the heme edge on cytochrome c and acidic residues on the counterpart (1Staudenmayer N. Ng S. Smith M.B. Millet F. Biochemistry. 1997; 16: 600-604Google Scholar, 2Ferguson-Miller S. Brautigan D. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 149-159Google Scholar, 3Rieder R. Bosshard H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4732-4739Google Scholar, 4Lappalainen P. Watmough N.J. Greenwood C. Saraste M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5824-5830Google Scholar, 5Witt H. Zickermann V. Ludwig B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 74-76Google Scholar, 6Witt H. Malatesta F. Nicoletti F. Brunori M. Ludwig B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 367-373Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it became obvious from ionic strength dependence measurements that electrostatic interactions are not the only criterion governing optimal electron transfer (2Ferguson-Miller S. Brautigan D. Margoliash E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 149-159Google Scholar). The bell-shaped dependence of activity on ionic strength lead to the proposal that at low ionic strength the redox partners lack the conformational flexibility to achieve a configuration optimal for electron transfer (7Tollin G. Hazzard J.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 287: 1-7Google Scholar, 8Meyer T.E. Zhao Z.G. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4552-4559Google Scholar) besides the fact that product dissociation becomes rate-limiting. At high ionic strength the rate of non-productive collisions increases due to the shielding of charges. Around the ionic strength optimum, when long range electrostatic forces have roughly aligned the reacting proteins, configurational freedom still prevails for short range forces such as hydrophobic interaction to contribute significantly to a configuration optimal for electron transfer.

Here we compare AD and control brain for the relative amounts of APP protein containing KPI to APP protein lacking this domain. APP protein was purified from the soluble subcellular fraction and Triton X-100 membrane pellet extract of one hemisphere of AD (n = 10), normal (n = 7), and neurological control (n= 5) brains. The amount of KPI-containing APP in the purified protein samples was determined using two independent assay methods. The first assay exploited the inhibitory action of KPI-containing APP on trypsin. The second assay employed reflectance analysis of Western blots. The proportion of KPI-containing forms of APP in the soluble subcellular fraction of AD brains is significantly elevated (p < 0.01) compared with controls. Species containing a KPI domain comprise 32–41 and 76–77% of purified soluble APP from control and AD brains, respectively. For purified membrane-associated APP, 72–77 and 65–82% of control and AD samples, respectively, contain a KPI domain. Since KPI-containing species of APP may be more amyloidogenic (Ho, L., Fukuchi, K., and Yonkin, S. G. (1996) J. Biol.

The principal component of extracellular amyloid is a 4-kDa peptide, the Aβ protein (1Glenner G.G. Wong C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 885-890Google Scholar, 2Masters C.L. Simms G. Weinman N.A. Multhaup G. McDonald B.L. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4245-4249Google Scholar) (also called the βA4 protein). The Aβ peptide is not expressed as a functional protein entity (3Citron M. Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Neurobiol. Aging. 1993; 14: 571-573Google Scholar) but is released by the processing of a much larger transmembrane protein, the amyloid protein precursor (APP). The pathogenesis of AD is thought to involve the disregulated expression or abnormal processing of APP. APP is encoded by a single 18-exon gene on chromosome 21 (4Kang J. Lemaire H. Unterbeck A.

Science. 1987; 235: 880-884Google Scholar). Exons 7, 8, and 15 of the APP gene can be alternatively spliced to produce multiple isoforms. In brain the predominant isoform transcripts demonstrated to date are APP695, APP751, and APP770 (7Kitaguchi N. Takahashi Y. Tokushima Y. Shiojiri S. Ito H. Nature. 1988; 331: 530-532Google Scholar, 8Tanzi R.E. McClatchey A.I. Lamperti E.D. Villa-Komaroff L. Gusella J.F. Neve R.L. Nature. 1988; 331: 528-530Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 9Ponte P.

These transcripts code for species containing 695, 751, and 770 amino acids, respectively. The isoforms APP751 and APP770 both contain a Kunitz protease inhibitory (KPI) motif that APP695 lacks. APP770 contains an additional OX.2 domain (7Kitaguchi N. Takahashi Y. Tokushima Y. Shiojiri S. Ito H. Nature. 1988; 331: 530-532Google Scholar, 10Weidemann A. König G. Bunke D. Fischer P. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Cell. 1989; 57: 115-126Google Scholar). The secreted form of APP751 is identical to protease nexin II, a plasma serine protease inhibitor (11Oltersdorf T.

In addition to KPI and OX.2 domains several other structural features have been identified on APP, including binding domains for heparin (12Small D.H. Nurcombe V. Reed G. Clarris H. Moir R.

Masters C.L. Multhaup G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 109-116Google Scholar), and N-linked carbohydrate attachment sites (10Weidemann A. König G. Bunke D. Fischer P. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Cell. 1989; 57: 115-126Google Scholar). Normal catabolism of APP involves proteolytic cleavage of full-length membrane-associated forms within the extracellular domain of the Aβ region and release of soluble COOH-terminal truncated species (sAPP) (16Esch F.S. Keim P.S. Beattie E.C. Blacher R.W. Culwell A.R. Oltersdorf T. McClure D. Ward P.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1122-1124Google Scholar, 17Sisodia S.S. Koo E.H. Beyreuther K. Unterbeck A. Price D.L. Science. 1990; 248: 492-495Google Scholar). The proteases that release sAPP have yet to be identified but have been named the α- and β-secretases. The α-secretase cleaves within the Aβ sequence of APP and its products are non-amyloidogenic. The β-secretase cleavage site is the NH2 terminus of the Aβ domain. The proteolytic activities that release intact Aβ from the transmembrane domain of APP (COOH terminus of Aβ) have been designated γ-secretases. The catabolic pathway for Aβ generation is unclear but probably involves internalization of full-length APP from the cell surface and degradation in endosomal-lysosomal complexes (18Estus S. Golde T.E. Kunishita T. Blades D. Lowery D. Eisen M. Usiak M. Qu X. Tabira T. Greenberg B.D. Younkin S.G. Science. 1992; 255: 726-728Google Scholar, 19Golde T.E. Estus S. Younkin L.H. Selkoe D.J.

In cultured hamster cells one route for Aβ production involves a coated pit-mediated endocytic pathway (21Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Google Scholar). Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) has recently been shown to also mediate the internalization and degradation of KPI-containing (KPI+) APP forms (22Kounnas M.Z. Moir R.D. Rebeck G.W. Bush A.I. Argraves W.S. Tanzi R.E. Hyman B.T. Strickland D.K. Cell. 1995; 82: 331-340Google Scholar, 23Knauer M.F. Orlando R.A. Glabe C.G. Brain Res. 1996; 740: 6-14Google Scholar). Internalization via LRP has been shown to increase if APP is complexed to the binding protein for epidermal growth factor (EGFBP) (23Knauer M.F. Orlando R.A. Glabe C.G. Brain Res. 1996; 740: 6-14Google Scholar, 24Van Nostrand W.E. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8508-8514Google Scholar). EGFBP is specific for APP forms that contain a KPI domain and does not form complexes with APP695. At present it is unclear if LRP mediated internalization of APP leads to Aβ production. Transcripts for APP695 are expressed almost exclusively in brain where they are a major neuronal APP mRNA species (25Neve R.L. Boyce F.M. McPhie D.L. Greenan J. Oster-Granite M.L. Neurobiol. Aging. 1996; 17: 191-203Google Scholar, 26Golde T.E. Estus S. Usiak M. Younkin L.H. Younkin S.G. Neuron. 1990; 4: 253-267Google Scholar). The KPI+ isoforms APP751 and APP770are expressed in both the central nervous system and in peripheral tissues. Several lines of evidence suggest that expression levels of KPI+ isoforms of APP may be important in AD pathogenesis.

Tan H. Power M. Masliah E. Mucke L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28257-28267Google Scholar). Finally, it has recently been confirmed that KPI+ isoforms of APP are more amyloidogenic, at least in transfected cells (48Ho L. Fukuchi K. Younkin S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30929-30934Google Scholar). At present it is unclear if an increase in KPI+ isoforms of APP occurs at the protein level in the brains of AD patients. In this study, APP was purified from the soluble subcellular fraction and Triton X-100 membrane pellet extract of AD and normal brains and then compared for KPI+ isoforms by two different assay methods. We find that the level of APP-KPI+ in purified material from the soluble subcellular fraction of AD brains was significantly elevated (doubled) relative to control patients. Lyophilized purified trypsin from bovine pancreas and carbobenzoxy-valyl-glycyl-arginine-4-nitranilide acetate (Chromozym TRY) were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). Electrophoretic molecular weight markers were purchased from Amersham (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Electrophoresis reagents were from Bio-Rad and polyvinylidene difluoride membrane from Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA). Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay reagent was from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Protein A-Sepharose and other chromatographic resins were from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden). The monoclonal antibody (mAb) 22C11 (available from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH) and polyclonal (pAb) R45 rabbit antiserum recognize an epitope near the amino terminus of APP (10Weidemann A. König G. Bunke D. Fischer P. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Cell. 1989; 57: 115-126Google Scholar, 49Hilbich C. Mönning U. Grund C. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26571-26577Google Scholar). MAb 7H5 was raised against a bacterial construct encompassing the KPI domain (residues 289–347 of APP770) and was kindly provided by Dr. Dale Schenk, Athena Neurosciences. Secondary antibodies used in Western blots were purified IgG fractions of anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Promega, Sydney, Australia). Human brains were obtained 12–24 h post mortem. At the time of autopsy one cerebral hemisphere was frozen at −70 °C and the other hemisphere was fixed in formalin for histological examination. The clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was confirmed by subsequent histological evidence of amyloid plaques or neurofibrillary tangles. Neurological control patients were clinically diagnosed as having Parkinson's disease or Huntington's disease with subsequent pathological confirmation. All clinical groups were age matched. APP was purified to homogeneity from the ultracentrifuge soluble fraction and Triton X-100 membrane pellet extract of human brain homogenate according to the method of Moir et al. (50Moir R.D. Martins R.N. Small D.H. Bush A.I. Milward E.A. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1490-1498Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated human brain cortex was homogenized and centrifuged. The supernatant (soluble subcellular fraction) was removed and the pellet incubated with Triton X-100. Insoluble material was pelleted by a second centrifugation and the supernatant (membrane extract) removed. Purification of APP from the crude brain subcellular fractions involves a sequential series of chromatographic steps: anion exchange (MacroPrep high Q resin), affinity chromatography (heparin-Sepharose gel), a second anion exchange step (Mono Q column) and hydrophobic interaction chromatography (phenyl-Superose column). Peak APP fractions from the final phenyl-Superose elute were concentrated and desalted into 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl (TBS) on Centricon 30 Protein Concentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA). APP was monitored at each purification step by mAb 22C11 immunoblots. Total APP protein yields were determined by amino acid analysis and BCA assay. MacroPrep high Q column effluent was titrated against corresponding starting material (crude brain subcellular fractions) on mAb 22C11 Western blots. Crude starting material and MacroPrep high Q column effluent is unsuited to analysis by direct immunoblotting on our Western blotting system because of severe band distortion and poor resolution on SDS-PAGE caused by the relatively large sample volumes and high protein loading required for a detectable APP signal. Therefore, all samples were concentrated by immunoprecipitation with pAb R45 (raised against the same epitope as mAb 22C11) before electrophoresis. PAb R45 immunoprecipitates prepared from increasing volumes of MacroPrep high Q effluent (500–1500 μl in 100-μl increments) and 75 μl of corresponding starting material were compared on mAb 22C11 Western blots by reflectance analysis. Purification efficiency was calculated from the volume of column effluent observed to give an equivalent signal (sum of all bands) to the sample of starting material. Calculations included an adjustment for the change in sample volume during chromatography. Samples were also analyzed to determine if 100–110- or 120–130-kDa immunoreactive species are selectively absorbed by the MacroPrep high resin. For this analysis, effluent concentrations with similar total APP signals as starting material were selected. The density of the 100–110- and 120–130-kDa bands were determined for the selected lanes. The ratio of the upper band density to lower band density (density of the upper band/density of the lower band) was then calculated for starting material and corresponding column effluents. MacroPrep high Q and desalted phenyl-Superose eluates were also compared on mAb 22C11 immunoblots. Since APP signal in chromatographic eluates is readily detected without prior concentration, these samples were not immunoprecipitated with pAb R45 before electrophoresis. The ratio of 100–110- to 120–130-kDa immunoreactive material in the eluates was calculated as described previously for immunoprecipitates of crude brain subcellular fractions and MacroPrep high Q effluents. Trypsin (30 ng) was incubated with or without APP in TBS (175 μl) for 20 min at 20 °C in 96-well microtiter plates. Trypsin activity was then determined in each well by the addition of 25 μl of the synthetic trypsin substrate Chromozym TRY (4 mm) and monitoring the change in absorbance (415 nm) over 20 min. Under the conditions used, assay linearity was maintained for at least 40 min after the addition of substrate and no increase in absorbance was detected in the presence of APP alone. Samples for immunoprecipitation were incubated overnight at 4 °C with pAb R45 or mAb 7H5 in TBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20. R45·antigen complexes were precipitated by addition of protein A-Sepharose (10 μl of swollen beads). For precipitation of 7H5·antigen complexes, protein A-Sepharose was first preincubated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG to increase capture efficiency. The Sepharose beads were washed three times prior to release of immunoprecipitated material from the resin by addition of 100 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide gels) and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were blocked with bovine serum albumin (3%) before incubation with mAb 22C11 (1:3000) or mAb 7H5 (1:1000) for 3 h at room temperature. Following a 2-h incubation at room temperature with anti-mouse IgG coupled to alkaline phosphatase (1:10000), blots were developed for 15 min with Fast Red (3 mg/ml) and naphthol (0.2 mg/ml) in 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0. Quantitation of APP on protein blots were determined by reflectance analysis as described by Bush et al. (51Bush A.I. Whyte S. Thomas L.D. Williamson T.G. Van Tiggelen C.J. Currie J. Small D.H. Moir R.D. Li Q.X. Rumble B. Mönning U. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L Ann. Neurol. 1992; 32: 57-65Google Scholar). APP was purified to homogeneity from the soluble subcellular fraction and Triton X-100 membrane pellet extract of cerebral cortex isolated from AD (n = 10), normal (n = 7), and neurological control (three Huntington's disease and two Parkinson's disease cases) brains. Purity was confirmed by protein staining of SDS-PAGE gels using silver and by NH2-terminal sequencing. Purified APP samples contained one minor (80–90 kDa) and two major (100–110 and 120–130 kDa) bands on mAb 22C11 Western blots and silver-stained SDS-PAGE gels. Identity of each band was confirmed by amino-terminal sequencing. Starting material, chromatographic fractions, and purified protein from AD and control brains were compared and monitored for selective loss or concentration of APP species during purification. APP-KPI+levels in the test brains used in these experiments are typical for their respective clinical groups. Initial experiments compared crude brains subcellular fractions and corresponding column effluents from the first chromatographic step (MacroPrep high Q column). Under the conditions used, positive absorption of mAb 22C11 immunoreactive material by MacroPrep high Q resin is greater than 90% for both soluble and detergent extract fractions of control and AD brains (Table I). Addition of eluates back to the effluents restored APP signal to that of corresponding starting material (data not shown). Consistent with uniform absorption of APP forms by the MacroPrep high Q resin, immunoprecipitates of starting material and chromatographic effluents contain similar relative amounts of 100–110- and 120–130-kDa species (Table II). Eluates from the MacroPrep high Q column and the last purification step also have similar relative amounts of the two major APP bands (Table II). In addition, Western blot analysis at each chromatographic step found no evidence of proteolytic degradation of APP during purification. These results are concordant with close conservation of the relative amounts of different APP forms during purification of both control and AD subcellular fractions.Table IAPP absorption from AD and control brain subcellular fractions by MacroPrep high Q anion exchange resinSoluble fractionMembrane fractionControlADControlAD>92%1-a% of total APP captured from brain subcellular fractions by MacroPrep high Q column (first chromatographic step).>92%>91%>90%1-a % of total APP captured from brain subcellular fractions by MacroPrep high Q column (first chromatographic step).

AD brains yield significantly less cortex (p = 0.0011 by t test) per hemisphere than pooled controls. The yield of purified APP protein is also significantly less for AD brains (p = 0.0023). Table III also shows the yield of APP for each clinical group after normalizing for the reduced mass of cortex recovered from AD brains (APP yield per g of cortex). Recovery of purified APP from AD brains remains significantly less than controls after normalizing for the different yields in cortex, although the difference is barely significant at the p = 0.05 level (p = 0.048). The subcellular distribution of APP is similar for all clinical groups, with equivalent soluble and membrane extract fractions yielding similar amounts of purified material. These results are consistent with the widespread neuronal loss associated with AD.Table IIIYields of cerebral cortex and purified APP protein from control and AD brainsnYield of cortex per hemisphereAPP yield soluble fractionAPP yield membrane fractionTotal APP yield per hemispheregμg/g of cortexμgNormal controls7370 ± 800.99 ± 0.210.98 ± 0.29744 ± 258Neurological controls5390 ± 821.04 ± 0.251.10 ± 0.17825 ± 142Pooled controls12377 ± 813-aPooled control cortex versus AD cortex;p = 0.0011.1.01 ± 0.231.02 ± 0.26773 ± 2263-bPooled control total APP versus AD total APP;p = 0.0023.AD10270 ± 383-aPooled control cortex versus AD cortex;p = 0.0011.0.83 ± 0.260.89 ± 0.30463 ± 1513-bPooled control total APP versus AD total APP;p = 0.0023.3-a Pooled control cortex versus AD cortex;p = 0.0011.3-b Pooled control total APP versus AD total APP;p = 0.0023. Open table in a new tab Two methods were used to determine the amount of KPI+isoforms in the purified APP samples. The first assay exploits the inhibitory action of KPI+ isoforms on trypsin. The second KPI+ isoform assay employs immunoblotting techniques and anti-NH2-terminal (mAb 22C11) and -KPI domain (mAb 7H5) antibodies. Trypsin was preincubated for 20 min with purified APP and then assayed for activity using the synthetic trypsin substrate Chromozym TRY. Initial experiments confirmed that trypsin activity decreased linearly with increasing concentrations of both soluble and membrane-associated APP (Fig. 1). The purified APP samples from normal, AD, and neurological disease control brains were then compared for trypsin inhibition. The proportion of KPI+ isoforms in each sample was calculated from the inhibition of trypsin (30 ng) after preincubation with 50 ng of purified protein (Table IV). The calculations assume that trypsin and KPI+ forms of APP interact with a 1:1 stoichiometry (52Kitaguchi N. Takahashi Y. Oishi K. Shiojiri S. Tokushima Y. Utsunomiya T. Ito H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1038: 105-113Google Scholar, 53Hynes T.R. Randal M. Kennedy L.A. Eigenbrot C. Kossiakoff A.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10018-10022Google Scholar), that total binding approaches 100% and that the average molecular mass of APP is 80 kDa and trypsin 24 kDa (based on the amino acid sequences of these proteins). Soluble and membrane-associated APP purified from control brain (pooled) have significantly different levels (p < 0.0001) of KPI+ isoforms. Membrane-associated material is predominantly KPI+, while most APP purified from the soluble fraction is KPI−. Both normal and neurological disease control groups display similar subcellular distributions of KPI+ isoforms. However, for AD brains, soluble and membrane-associated APP contain similar levels of KPI+ material. Furthermore, KPI+ isoforms in APP from the soluble subcellular fraction of AD brains are significantly elevated (p = 0.0014) compared with corresponding material from pooled controls. The level of KPI+ isoforms in membrane-associated APP from AD-affected patients is not significantly different from control subjects.Table IVTrypsin inhibition by purified APP from AD and control brainsSubcellular fraction% KPI+ APP; trypsin inhibitionNormal control (n = 7)Diseased control (n = 5)Pooled control (n = 12)AD (n = 10)Soluble31 ± 734 ± 2132 ± 154-aPooled control soluble fraction versuspooled control membrane fraction; p < 0.0001.,4-bPooled control soluble fraction versus AD-soluble fraction; p = 0.0014.76 ± 294-bPooled control soluble fraction versus AD-soluble fraction; p = 0.0014.Membrane81 ± 1770 ± 1777 ± 184-aPooled control soluble fraction versuspooled control membrane fraction; p < 0.0001.82 ± 204-a Pooled control soluble fraction versuspooled control membrane fraction; p < 0.0001.4-b Pooled control soluble fraction versus AD-soluble fraction; p = 0.0014.

https://openalex.org/W2041628014,"Treatment of cultured rat Kupffer cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in a time-dependent increase in the expression of the inducible isoform of nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS). Agents that elevated intracellular cAMP levels (e.g. forskolin, dibutyryl cAMP, cholera toxin, and isoproterenol) markedly decreased nitrite production and iNOS protein formation by LPS-stimulated Kupffer cells. Furthermore, inhibition of LPS-induced nitrite formation and iNOS protein levels by these agents was enhanced in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Forskolin, the most potent inhibitor of LPS-induced nitrite formation by Kupffer cells, decreased iNOS mRNA levels in a time-dependent manner. Time course studies indicated that forskolin was most effective at inhibiting LPS-induced nitrite formation and iNOS mRNA levels by Kupffer cells when added before LPS. Message stability studies established that forskolin did not enhance the rate of decay of LPS-induced iNOS mRNA. Nuclear run-on assays revealed that forskolin decreased LPS-induced transcription of the iNOS gene. Treatment of Kupffer cells with LPS induced the translocation of the p65 subunit of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) into the nucleus, and this process was abolished by forskolin. In addition, the LPS-dependent degradation of IκBα was not observed in forskolin-treated cells; the levels of the p65 subunit of NF-κB were minimal in the nucleus at the same time. Also, we observed that forskolin induced transcription of the IκBα gene in a time-dependent manner and in addition up-regulated LPS-induced IκBα mRNA levels. Taken together, this study indicates that the attenuation of LPS-induced iNOS formation in Kupffer cells by elevated intracellular cAMP levels occurs by preventing the degradation of IκBα which suppresses the activation of NF-κB and inhibits the onset of transcription of the iNOS gene.

Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142Google Scholar). NO is generated froml-arginine and molecular oxygen in the presence of the enzyme NO synthase (NOS) (2Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Google Scholar). To date three distinct NOS isoforms have been identified from molecular cloning and sequencing analyses (3Lowenstein C.J. Glatt C.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6711-6715Google Scholar). The endothelial (eNOS) and neuronal (nNOS) isoforms are expressed constitutively in endothelial and neuronal cells, respectively. The amount of NO generated by these cell types is dependent upon the cellular content of NOS (4Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Google Scholar). NO generated by endothelial cells plays an important role in the control of vascular tone, whereas in neuronal tissue NO acts to regulate cGMP-mediated neurotransmission (1Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142Google Scholar, 2Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Google Scholar). The third isoform of NOS, termed inducible NOS (iNOS), was first identified in macrophages stimulated with interferon-γ and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (3Lowenstein C.J. Glatt C.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6711-6715Google Scholar). iNOS has been identified in a wide variety of cell types including macrophages, mesangial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, keratinocytes, chondrocytes, osteoclasts, and hepatocytes (1Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142Google Scholar, 5Nathan C. Xie Q.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Google Scholar). NO generated within these cells mediates macrophage cytotoxicity during host defense reactions, alterations in the contractile responses of mesangial cells, and in instances where NO exceeds normal physiological levels, instigates the inhibition of vascular smooth muscle tone, hepatocyte metabolism, and protein synthesis (6Kunz D. Walker G. Pfeilschifter J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 337-340Google Scholar, 7Wang M.H. Cox G.W. Yoshimura T. Sheffler L.A. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. J. Biol.

Recent evidence indicates that elevated levels of NO play a major role in the pathogenesis of several chronic disorders and inflammatory processes. In particular, studies have indicated that an overproduction of NO in response to LPS and cytokines contributes to the development and prolongation of severe hypotension and peripheral vasodilation observed during endotoxic shock (9Szabo C. Wu C.C. Mitchell J.A. Gross S.S. Thiemermann C. Vane J.R. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 991-999Google Scholar). The activities of nNOS and eNOS are regulated by rapid, transient elevations of intracellular free calcium which enhance the binding of calmodulin to the NOS enzyme resulting in NO release over a time frame of seconds and minutes (10Bredt D.S. Ferris C.D. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10976-10981Google Scholar). In contrast, the expression of iNOS is thought to be regulated primarily at the transcriptional level of the iNOS gene. Once induced, iNOS produces NO for periods of several hours or days. Thus, given the magnitude of the wide variety of inhibitory actions of NO, it is of considerable interest and even may be of some therapeutic utility to delineate the mechanism(s) by which the production and resultant activity of NOS can be controlled or attenuated. In the presence of LPS, Kupffer cells, the resident macrophage found in the sinusoids of the liver, produce large amounts of nitrite and nitrate, the stable end products of the NO pathway (11Billiar T.R. Curran R.D. Stuehr D.J. West M.A. Bentz B.G. Simmons R.L. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1467-1472Google Scholar). It has become apparent recently that overproduction of NO by hepatic cells plays a major role in hepatic injury/necrosis associated with endotoxic shock. Kupffer cells also synthesize and release several cytokines in response to LPS which in turn stimulate neighboring hepatocytes to generate NO (8Curran R.D. Billiar T.R. Stuehr D.J. Ochoa J.B. Harbrecht B.G. Flint S.G. Simmons R.L. Ann. Surg. 1990; 212: 462-471Google Scholar). The consequent overproduction of NO in the liver results in profound degenerative changes observed in hepatocytes (12Laskin D.L. Rodriguez del Valle M. Heck D.E. Hwang S.M. Ohnishi S.T. Durham S.K. Goller N.L. Laskin J.D. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 223-234Google Scholar). These changes include a decrease in total protein synthesis, cellular proliferation, and an increase in cGMP formation (13Nussler A.K. Di Silvio M. Liu Z.Z. Geller D.A. Freeswick P. Dorko K. Bartoli F. Billiar T.R. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 1552-1560Google Scholar). The induction of iNOS by LPS in Kupffer cells requires the initiation of gene expression and de novo protein synthesis over a period of several hours. It is unclear whether classical second messengers such as cAMP are involved in iNOS gene expression and NO formation. Recent studies have indicated that agents that elevate levels of cAMP improve circulatory function in animal models of endotoxic shock; in particular isoproterenol was found to inhibit the development of vascular hyporeactivity in the endotoxic rat (14Harbrecht B.G. Johnson B. Pitt B. Billiar T.R. Endothelium. 1995; 3: S95Google Scholar, 15Szabo C. Hasko G. Zingarelli B. Nemeth Z.H. Salzman A.L. Kvetan V. Pastores S.M. Vizi E.S. Immunology. 1997; 90: 95-100Google Scholar). In contrast, certainin vitro studies have shown that elevation of cAMP caused an induction of iNOS, whereas in other studies increased levels of cAMP caused a reduction in iNOS (6Kunz D. Walker G. Pfeilschifter J. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 337-340Google Scholar, 7Wang M.H. Cox G.W. Yoshimura T. Sheffler L.A. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14027-14031Google Scholar, 16Bulut V. Severn A. Liew F.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1134-1138Google Scholar). The present study was designed to investigate whether iNOS gene expression and/or enzymatic activity is regulated by elevated levels of cAMP in cultured rat Kupffer cells. Following enzymatic digestion of the rat liver, Kupffer cells were isolated by centrifugal elutriation as described previously (17Knook D.L. Sleyster E.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 99: 444-449Google Scholar). The viability of the Kupffer cell preparation was greater than 95% as determined by trypan blue exclusion. Freshly isolated Kupffer cells were maintained at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 culture medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 25 mm HEPES,l-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT), 112 units/ml penicillin, and 112 units/ml streptomycin in 24-well plates or 60-mm tissue culture dishes. All cells were incubated in an atmosphere of 90% air and 10% CO2. On the 2nd day of culture the RPMI medium was changed. For experimental purposes, Kupffer cells were used within 3–4 days of their establishment in culture. Production of NO by iNOS was quantified by measuring the accumulation of nitrite in the culture medium using the Griess reaction (18Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Google Scholar). Kupffer cells were cultured in 24-well plastic tissue culture plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml (1 ml/well) at 37 °C. After 4 days in culture the cells were washed, and complete medium without phenol red was added to each well. The cells were then exposed to several cAMP-elevating agents. After a specified incubation interval the medium from each well was removed. The nitrate in each sample was reduced to nitrite using the method described by Grisham et al. (19Grisham M.B. Johnson G.G. Lancaster J.R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 237-246Google Scholar). Samples were then mixed with an equal volume of the Griess reagent (1% sulfanilamide, 5% H3PO4, 0.1% naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The absorbance of each sample was measured spectrophotometrically at 543 nm using sodium nitrite as a standard. Nitrite formation was expressed as nmol/106 cells. Values denote the mean ± S.D. of quadruplicate determinations from at least two separate experiments, unless otherwise stated. Kupffer cells were plated at a density of 1 × 107 cells/60-mm dish. After 3 days in culture, the cells were rinsed with fresh medium and stimulated with LPS alone or with cAMP-elevating compounds. Following treatment, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline three times; then 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) containing 5 mmEDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, 1 μm aprotinin, and 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to each dish, and the cells were scraped quickly. The resulting cell suspensions were subjected to three rapid freeze-thaw-vortex cycles to disrupt the Kupffer cells completely. A 100-μl sample of the broken cell preparation was used for protein quantitation, and the remainder of the sample was stored at −80 °C until analyzed. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared according to Schreiber et al. (20Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 106 Kupffer cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in 400 μl of lysis buffer (10 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1m EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol), 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μmleupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 1 μmaprotinin. The cells were allowed to swell on ice for 15 min, after which 12.5 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added. The tube was vortexed vigorously for 10 s, and the homogenate was centrifuged for 30 s in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant (cytoplasmic extract) was removed carefully and stored at −80 °C until required. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 25 μl of cold nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 1 μm aprotinin), and the tube was incubated on ice for 30 min with frequent vortexing. The nuclear extract was then centrifuged for 5 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C, and the supernatant was stored at −80 °C for later use. Before SDS-PAGE the disrupted cell suspensions were dried using a Savant vacuum centrifuge. Sample pellets were solubilized in buffer containing 0.1 mdithiothreitol, 50% glycerol, 0.5 m Tris, pH 6.8, 2.5 mm pyronine Y, and 20% SDS and subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% gel) using the buffer system of Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, using a semidry transfer blot system, and the membranes were soaked for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 5% non-fat dried milk powder and incubated for 24 h with anti-iNOS antibody in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20, and 1% bovine serum albumin. The blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG in the same buffer for 2 h. Finally, the blots were rinsed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.01% Tween 20. Peroxidase-labeled proteins were visualized by incubation with the peroxidase color development reagent 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and hydrogen peroxide. Cytoplasmic and nuclear samples were resolved using SDS-PAGE (11% gel). The separated proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were then incubated in blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4) containing 10% non-fat dried milk powder for 1 h and then exposed to diluted primary antibodies against the p65 subunit of NF-κB or IκBα overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 5,000-fold diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody. Protein bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) assay kit. Kupffer cells were plated at a density of 1 × 107 cells/60-mm dish. After 3 days in culture and the appropriate treatment, total RNA from cultured rat Kupffer cells was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA (3–4 μg) was separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde gel and transferred using a Possiblot (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) onto a Magna nylon membrane (Microns Separations Inc. Westborough, MA). A full-length murine iNOS cDNA probe kindly provided by Dr. S. H. Snyder (The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore) or Iκ-B cDNA kindly provided by Dr. A. Baldwin Jr. (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) was labeled with a multiprime DNA labeling system using [α-32P]dCTP (specific activity, 3,000 Ci/mmol). Northern blot hybridizations were performed in 50% formamide, 1m NaCl, 10% dextran sulfate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, and 0.2% Denhardt's solution at 42 °C for 16 h. The membranes were washed twice in 2 × SSC, 1% SDS at 65 °C for 20 min, twice in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C for 15 min, and finally at room temperature in 0.1 × SSC for 15 min. Radioactivity was visualized using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Control hybridizations were performed using a 32P end-labeled oligonucleotide complementary to rat 18 S rRNA. Nuclei were isolated from treated Kupffer cells (5–6 × 107) according to standard protocols (22Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley and Sons, New York1994: 4.0.1-4.0.5Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were rinsed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped gently in 6 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged at 800 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. Lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 2 ml) was added followed by vortexing for 10 s to disrupt the cell pellets. The cells were incubated on ice for 5 min and nuclei pelleted by centrifugation at 800 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The pelleted nuclei were resuspended in storage buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 40% (v/v) glycerol), frozen, and then stored in liquid nitrogen until needed. For in vitro transcription, freshly thawed nuclei were incubated in reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl; 5 mm MgCl2; 0.3 m KCl; 100 mm ATP, CTP, GTP; 1 m dithiothreitol; 10 mCi/ml [α-32P]UTP (3,000 mCi/mmol, Amersham Corp.), shaking for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was quenched by the addition of RNase-free DNase I (10 mg/ml, Worthington) and proteinase K (20 mg/ml, Ambion, Austin, TX) and incubated for 30 min at 42 °C. Nascent labeled RNAs were purified by extraction with phenol/chloroform and two sequential precipitations with ammonium acetate. Equal amounts of32P-labeled RNA were resuspended in 1 ml of TES/NaCl solution (10 mm TES, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 0.3 m NaCl) and hybridized for 60 h at 65 °C to denatured DNA probes immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes. Following hybridization, the filters were washed twice in 2 × SSC at 65 °C for 1 h, once at 37 °C in 2 × SSC containing RNase A (10 mg/ml, Ambion) for 30 min, and once in 2 × SSC at 37 °C for 1 h. Radioactivity was visualized using a PhosphorImager. Anti-mac iNOS was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against p65 and IκBα were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate and prestained SDS-PAGE standards were obtained from Bio-Rad. Bacterial LPS (fromEscherichia coli, serotype 011:B4), dibutyryl cAMP, cholera toxin, forskolin, isoproterenol, IBMX, and actinomycin D were purchased from Sigma. Cultured unstimulated Kupffer cells exhibited a low basal level of nitrite production, whereas LPS caused an 8-fold increase in nitrite formation during the 24-h observation period (Table I). The addition of various cAMP-elevating agents attenuated LPS-induced nitrite formation by Kupffer cells, each in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). The effect of the highest concentration of each agent used in this study is noted in Table I. The diterpene forskolin activates adenylate cyclase directly, resulting in an increase of intracellular cAMP levels; forskolin inhibited LPS-induced nitrite formation strongly. The membrane-permeable cAMP analog dibutyryl cAMP reduced LPS-induced nitrite formation by 34%. Both isoproterenol and cholera toxin stimulate adenylate cyclase via the stimulatory G-protein Gs, isoproterenol by binding to cell surface β-adrenergic receptors and cholera toxin by ADP-ribosylation of Gs. We have used these agents previously to demonstrate cAMP-dependent changes in platelet-activating factor binding in Kupffer cells, and we have confirmed that isoproterenol causes an increase in intracellular cAMP in these cells (23Chao W. Liu H.L. Zhou W.G. Hanahan D.J. Olson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17576-17583Google Scholar). It is important to note that none of the cAMP-elevating agents (at the indicated concentrations) caused 1) any significant change in the rate of formation of nitrite above the control value when added to Kupffer cells in the absence of LPS (Table I) and 2) any morphological alterations or detachment of Kupffer cells after an incubation period of 24 h. In addition, LPS-induced nitrite formation by Kupffer cells in the combined presence of the aforementioned cAMP-elevating agents and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX was inhibited to a greater degree than in the absence of IBMX (Table I). Thus cAMP-elevating agents clearly are capable of decreasing LPS-induced iNOS activity in Kupffer cells.Table IEffects of various cAMP-elevating agents on LPS-stimulated nitrite production by Kupffer cellsTreatmentNitrite productionnmol/106Kupffer cells/24 hNo addition5.1 ± 0.9LPS (10 ng/ml)39.7 ± 1.1Forskolin (50 μm)5.4 ± 0.9LPS + forskolin16.3 ± 2.0LPS + forskolin + IBMX11.3 ± 1.5Bt2cAMP (10 μm)6.1 ± 1.1LPS + Bt2cAMP26.1 ± 1.4LPS + Bt2cAMP + IBMX17.3 ± 0.9Cholera toxin (1 ng/ml)5.9 ± 0.5LPS + cholera toxin24 ± 0.4LPS + cholera toxin + IBMX15.7 ± 0.9Isoproterenol (10 μm)4.2 ± 1.3LPS + isoproterenol26 ± 1.8LPS + isoproterenol + IBMX17.5 ± 2.0 Open table in a new tab Elevated cAMP levels might exert direct metabolic control on preexisting iNOS or might decrease the synthesis of iNOS protein. To distinguish between these alternatives, the nitrite inhibition experiments were repeated, and the levels of iNOS protein in Kupffer cells were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-iNOS antibody. As depicted in Fig. 1, in untreated Kupffer cells immunoreactive iNOS was undetectable, whereas LPS-treated cells produced a heavily stained band. The iNOS protein bands from Kupffer cells that had been treated with LPS, cAMP-elevating agents, and IBMX appeared to be lightly stained (lanes 3–6), indicating a substantial decrease in the amount of iNOS protein formed after 24 h. As forskolin was the most effective inhibitor of LPS-induced nitrite and iNOS protein formation by cultured Kupffer cells (Table I and Fig. 1) it was used for all subsequent experiments. Kupffer cells were treated with either LPS or LPS and forskolin; nitrite formation was measured at the time intervals indicated in Fig. 2 A. In agreement with other research groups, LPS stimulated nitrite formation by Kupffer cells in a time-dependent fashion. The inhibitory effects of forskolin on LPS-induced nitrite formation by Kupffer cells became apparent after 6–8 h of treatment and continued up to 24 h. The time dependence of LPS-induced iNOS mRNA accumulation in Kupffer cells is shown in Fig. 2, B and D; the iNOS mRNA level increased rapidly between 3 and 6 h and then declined by 24 h. The addition of forskolin caused a considerable decrease in the accumulation of iNOS mRNA, and the levels of message were barely detectable at 24 h (Fig. 2, C and D). Forskolin was added to Kupffer cells before, at the same time as, or at different times after the addition of LPS to determine the optimum time for the inhibition of LPS-induced nitrite production and iNOS mRNA levels. Nitrite accumulation in the culture medium was measured 24 h after the addition of LPS. Fig. 3 A shows that maximal suppression of LPS-induced nitrite formation by Kupffer cells occurred when forskolin was present 1 h before the addition of LPS. When forskolin was added after LPS, its inhibitory effect decreased gradually with time. Fig. 3 B depicts a similar experiment except iNOS mRNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern blotting. When Kupffer cells were pretreated with forskolin for 1 h before the addition of LPS, the level of iNOS mRNA formed after 6 h was barely detectable. However, the intensities of the iNOS mRNA bands increased when forskolin was added at the same time as LPS and subsequently 2 and 4 h after the addition of LPS. To examine whether forskolin attenuated LPS-induced steady-state levels of iNOS mRNA by decreasing its stability, we assessed the effects of forskolin on the half-life of LPS-induced iNOS mRNA by coincubation of Kupffer cells with the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D. Kupffer cells were treated with LPS in the presence and absence of forskolin for 6 h to induce maximal iNOS mRNA accumulation. Actinomycin D (10 ng/ml) was added to the cells at this point to inhibit further transcription. At different times after the addition of actinomycin D, total RNA was isolated and examined by Northern analysis. To allow for differences in loading, the signal density of each RNA sample hybridized to the iNOS probe was corrected by that hybridized to the 18 S probe. Fig. 4 shows the decay of iNOS mRNA as ln (relative intensity) against time. Under these conditions, the half-life of iNOS mRNA can be calculated as −(ln (2Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Google Scholar)/gradient of regression line). The calculated half-lives of iNOS mRNA in LPS-stimulated Kupffer cells in the absence and presence of forskolin were 2.4 and 2.3 h, respectively; therefore, the reduction of LPS-induced iNOS mRNA levels by forskolin in Kupffer cells was not caused by a decrease in message stability. iNOS gene transcription in Kupffer cells was measured directly using a nuclear run-on assay to confirm that forskolin caused inhibition of this process. Kupffer cells were incubated either alone, or with LPS or LPS and forskolin for 3 h and 5 h; cells were lysed and nuclei isolated. The transcription of iNOS and β-actin by isolated nuclei was determined by hybridizing the elongated, labeled RNA transcripts to iNOS- and β-actin-specific cDNA fragments that had been slot blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Fig. 5 A shows that iNOS gene transcription was barely detectable in control cells (lane 1), was increased greatly by 3-h exposure to LPS (lane 2), and that pretreatment with forskolin for 1 h attenuated the LPS effect (lane 3). In a similar experiment using a 5-h stimulation with LPS, a 1-h pretreatment with forskolin caused no apparent attenuation of iNOS gene transcription (compare lanes 2 and 3 in Fig. 5 B). These results are in agreement with time-dependent changes in iNOS mRNA. Fig. 2 D shows that after a 3-h stimulation with LPS a pulse of iNOS gene transcription has just commenced, and the effect of added forskolin will be maximal, i.e. the gradients of the curves with and without forskolin differ considerably. After 5 h of LPS stimulation the pulse of iNOS gene transcription is ending; mRNA levels fall after 6 h. At this time the effect of added forskolin will be minimal; the gradients of the curves with and without forskolin will differ very little as both approach their highest values. Taken together, the above findings indicated that forskolin attenuates LPS-induced iNOS mRNA formation, mainly at the transcriptional level. Recent studies by Xieet al. (24Xie Q.W. Whisnant R. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1779-1784Google Scholar) have shown that activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and its binding to the promoter region of the iNOS gene are critical steps in the induction of iNOS synthesis by LPS in macrophages. In addition, Tran-Thi et al. (25Tran-Thi T.A. Decker K. Baeuerle P.A. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 613-619Google Scholar) reported NF-κB-binding activity in Kupffer cells treated previously with LPS. In view of these findings, we decided to investigate the effect of forskolin on NF-κB activation in the presence and absence of LPS. Kupffer cells were either untreated, treated with LPS for 30 min, pretreated with forskolin for 1 h and then stimulated with LPS for 30 min, or pretreated with forskolin for 1 h and then stimulated with vehicle for 30 min; cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were then isolated. A representative experiment is depicted in Fig. 6. Panel A represents cytoplasmic extracts, and panel B represents nuclear extracts. In untreated cells (lane 1) the p65 subunit of NF-κB was located main"

The α-formylglycine is essential for the catalytic activity. Klebsiella pneumoniae expresses an inducible arylsulfatase for which the DNA predicts a serine at the position occupied by the α-formylglycine residue in eukaryotic sulfatases.

This novel posttranslational modification occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and is directed by a linear sequence surrounding the cysteine to be modified (1Schmidt B. Selmer T.

Crystallographic analysis of two sulfatases has shown that the FGly residue is part of the catalytic site (4Bond C.S. Clements P.R. Ashby S.J. Collyer C.A. Harrop S.J. Hopwood J.J. Guss J.M.

In prokaryotes expression of sulfatases is generally controlled by the sulfur or the carbon content of their environment. Under appropriate conditions such as the absence of SO42− and the presence of alkyl sulfates, the sulfatases are expressed in the periplasmic space (for review see Ref. 7Fitzgerald J.W. Bacteriol. Rev. 1976; 40: 698-721Google Scholar). The sequences of five prokaryotic sulfatases have been reported (8Murooka Y. Ishibashi K. Yasumoto M. Sasaki M. Sugino H. Azakami H. Yamashita M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2131-2140Google Scholar, 9Daniels K.L. Plunkett III, G. Burland V. Blattner F.R. Science. 1992; 257: 771-778Google Scholar, 10Beil S. Kehrli H. James P. Standemann W. Cook A.M.

A. 1996; 96: 3132-3137Google Scholar), and they share sequence homology with eukaryotic sulfatases to a similar extent as the members of the eukaryotic sulfatase family among each other. Surprisingly, in the genes encoding the sulfatases from Klebsiella pneumoniae (8Murooka Y. Ishibashi K. Yasumoto M. Sasaki M. Sugino H. Azakami H. Yamashita M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2131-2140Google Scholar) and fromEscherichia coli (9Daniels K.L. Plunkett III, G. Burland V. Blattner F.R. Science. 1992; 257: 771-778Google Scholar), a serine residue is predicted at a position where all other known sulfatase DNAs predict a cysteine that is known to be converted into FGly in eukaryotes. To examine whether the FGly residue is found also in prokaryotic sulfatases and whether it can be generated also from a serine residue, we purified arylsulfatase from K. pneumoniae and examined the protein for the presence of a FGly residue. K. pneumoniae strain DSM 681 was obtained from DSM GmbH, Braunschweig. [3H]NaBH4 was from Amersham Buchler. Bacterial culture and purification of arylsulfatase were performed as described by Okamuraet al. (13Okamura H. Yamada T. Murooka Y. Harada T. Agr. Biol. Chem. 1976; 40: 2071-2076Google Scholar) with some modifications: K. pneumoniae DSM 681 from blood agar plates was grown overnight in aliquots of 0.4 liters of medium containing methionine as sulfur source. At an A600 of 1.5–2.5 cells were sedimented, washed, and disrupted for 20 min in aliquots of 30 ml using a Sonicator W 220-F, Heat Systems-Ultrasonics, Inc. For analysis of arylsulfatase activity 200 μl of sample were incubated with 200 μl of 20 mm p-nitrocatecholsulfate in 10 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, for 10 min at 37 °C. After addition of 1 ml of 1 m NaOH, absorbance at 515 nm was measured. The initial ammonium sulfate precipitation (13Okamura H. Yamada T. Murooka Y. Harada T. Agr. Biol. Chem. 1976; 40: 2071-2076Google Scholar) was omitted, and Sephadex G-100 was substituted by Superdex 75 (120-ml volume, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with 20 mmTris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2 on a fast protein liquid chromatograph. Arylsulfatase activity eluted after 66 ml. After concentration in an ultra thimble and dialysis against 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4 arylsulfatase was loaded on a MonoQ fast protein liquid chromatography column replacing the DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column (13Okamura H. Yamada T. Murooka Y. Harada T. Agr. Biol. Chem. 1976; 40: 2071-2076Google Scholar). By this procedure arylsulfatase was purified about 224-fold to a specific activity of 123 units/mg protein yielding about 1 mg of enzyme from 30 liters of culture with a recovery of 7%. For further analysis the sulfatase was desalted by RP-HPLC on a SMART system (Pharmacia) using an Aquapore Butyl 7 micron (220 × 2.1 mm) column (Applied Biosystems) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/H2O. Arylsulfatase A was eluted by an acetonitrile gradient from 0 to 90% in 36 min. 30 μg of arylsulfatase were lyophilized and solubilized in 4 mguanidinium hydrochloride, 25 mm Tris/HCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 9. Reduction with [3H]NaBH4, desalting, tryptic digestion, and purification of the peptides on RP-HPLC were performed as described, omitting reductive carboxymethylation with dithiothreitol and iodacetic acid (1Schmidt B. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. von Figura K. Cell. 1995; 82: 271-278Google Scholar, 3Selmer T. Hallmann A. Schmidt B. Sumper M. von Figura K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 341-345Google Scholar). Before digestion with trypsin an aliquot of the3H-labeled arylsulfatase was analyzed by SDS-PAGE using high Tris gels containing 10% acrylamide, 0.13% bis-acrylamide (14Dierks T. Volkmer J. Schlenstedt G. Jung C. Sandholzer U. Zachmann K. Schlotterhose P. Neifer K. Schmidt B. Zimmermann R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6931-6942Google Scholar), followed by Coomassie Blue staining and phosphoimaging. Fractions from RP-HPLC were analyzed by liquid scintillation counting, mass spectrometry, amino acid sequencing, and radiosequencing (1Schmidt B. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. von Figura K. Cell. 1995; 82: 271-278Google Scholar, 3Selmer T. Hallmann A. Schmidt B. Sumper M. von Figura K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 341-345Google Scholar). 180 μg of arylsulfatase were lyophilized and subjected to SDS-PAGE (see above). After staining with Coomassie Blue (0.195% Coomassie R-250, 0.005% Coomassie G-250, 0.5% acetic acid, 20% methanol) for 20 min and destaining with 30% methanol, the gel slice containing arylsulfatase was excised and cut into small pieces. The gel pieces were washed twice with 0.5 ml of 50% acetonitrile, 50% 100 mm ammonium carbonate (buffer A) and dried on air. 3.6 μg of trypsin in 100 μl of buffer A were added. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature buffer A was added to cover the gel pieces. Following incubation for 16 h at 37 °C, peptides were extracted with 0.2 ml of 50% acetonitrile, 50% trifluoroacetic acid, 0.2 ml of 50% acetonitrile/H2O, and 0.2 ml of 75% acetonitrile/H2O, each at 60 °C for 30 min. The supernatants were pooled, concentrated to 20 μl, filled up to 100 μl with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/H2O and subjected to RP-HPLC (see above). Fractions containing nonmodified and modified peptide 2, as identified by mass spectrometry (MALDI III, Shimadzu), were pooled, concentrated to 50% volume, and applied to a μpeak C2/C18 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/H2O. The peptides were eluted by an acetonitrile gradient (0.5%/min) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Fractions were analyzed by mass spectrometry using indole-2-carboxylic acid or p-nitroaniline as matrices (1Schmidt B. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. von Figura K. Cell. 1995; 82: 271-278Google Scholar, 3Selmer T. Hallmann A. Schmidt B. Sumper M. von Figura K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 341-345Google Scholar). Fractions containing modified or nonmodified peptide 2, respectively, were pooled and subjected to amino acid sequencing (1Schmidt B. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. von Figura K. Cell. 1995; 82: 271-278Google Scholar). K. pneumoniae was grown in the presence of 1 mm methionine to induce the expression of arylsulfatase (8Murooka Y. Ishibashi K. Yasumoto M. Sasaki M. Sugino H. Azakami H. Yamashita M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2131-2140Google Scholar). The arylsulfatase was purified from the periplasmic fraction to a specific activity of 123 units/mg. The final preparation contained one major polypeptide (Fig. 1, lane 1), which was identified as arylsulfatase by protein sequencing. Among the contaminating proteins, which became visible upon overloading the gel, the xylose binding protein (15Sofia H.J. Burland V. Daniels D.L. Plunkett III, G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2576-2586Google Scholar) represented the major species accounting for up to 5% of total protein (data not shown). In the arylsulfatase from K. pneumoniae, serine 72 is equivalent to the cysteine residue that in eukaryotic sulfatases is converted into FGly. To examine whether serine 72 is converted to FGly, the arylsulfatase was incubated with NaB[3H]H4 in the presence of 4 mguanidinium chloride. This would reduce the aldehyde group of FGly and generate a [3H]serine residue (1Schmidt B. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. von Figura K. Cell. 1995; 82: 271-278Google Scholar, 3Selmer T. Hallmann A. Schmidt B. Sumper M. von Figura K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 341-345Google Scholar). An aliquot of the reduced arylsulfatase was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining and phosphoimaging. Phosphoimaging showed that the arylsulfatase had incorporated 3H radioactivity (Fig. 1,lane 2). The [3H]arylsulfatase was digested with trypsin, and the tryptic peptides were separated by RP-HPLC (Fig. 2 A). The fractions were analyzed for radioactivity and by mass spectrometry. The peak of3H radioactivity eluted with a retention time of 26.7 min and was collected in fraction 36. Mass spectrometry of fraction 36 yielded a mass of 1590 Da (Fig. 2 B), which corresponds to the mass calculated for the tryptic peptide 2 comprising residues 63–76. Mass spectrometry of other fractions identified seven tryptic peptides representing 126 of the 444 amino acids of arylsulfatase fromK. pneumoniae (8Murooka Y. Ishibashi K. Yasumoto M. Sasaki M. Sugino H. Azakami H. Yamashita M. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2131-2140Google Scholar). Radiosequencing of the HPLC fraction 36 showed that the radioactivity was released in the tenth cycle (Fig. 2 C). In peptide 2 this position corresponds to residue 72, for which the DNA sequence predicts a serine. The association of the radioactivity with residue 72 strongly suggests that serine 72 in newly translated arylsulfatase of Klebsiella had been oxidized to FGly, which by treatment with NaB[3H]H4 had been reduced to [3H]serine. When sulfatases are expressed at high level in mammalian cells, a fraction of the cysteine can escape conversion to FGly, presumably due to saturation of the oxidizing machinery (1Schmidt B. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. von Figura K. Cell. 1995; 82: 271-278Google Scholar). Because the Klebsiella arylsulfatase had been reduced prior to tryptic digestion, it was not possible to determine whether a fraction of the arylsulfatase had retained serine 72 predicted by the DNA. Therefore the experiment was repeated with the omission of the reduction of the arylsulfatase. In addition the tryptic digestion was performed after separation by SDS-PAGE to remove the remaining contaminants. The tryptic peptides were separated by RP-HPLC. Fractions containing masses predicted for the nonmodified serine 72-containing form of peptide 2 (1590 Da) or for the modified FGly 72-containing form of peptide 2 (1588 Da, designated as peptide 2*) were identified by mass spectrometry and subjected to rechromatography (Fig. 3, upper panel). A3H-labeled standard of peptide 2 (obtained as described above) eluted in fractions 31–34 as indicated in Fig. 3 (upper panel) by a horizontal bar. The material in these fractions had a mass of 1589–1590 Da, and sequencing of the pooled fractions 31–34 yielded the full-length sequence of peptide 2 (Fig. 3,lower panel). The peptide(s) in fractions 26–30 had a mass of 1587–1589 Da. To determine whether this material corresponds to the modified peptide 2*, the mass was additionally determined after embedding the material in a p-nitroaniline matrix. If a peptide contains an aldehyde group, a Schiff's base is formed withp-nitroaniline, and the mass of the peptide increases by 120 Da (1Schmidt B. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. von Figura K. Cell. 1995; 82: 271-278Google Scholar, 3Selmer T. Hallmann A. Schmidt B. Sumper M. von Figura K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 341-345Google Scholar). The peptide in fractions 26–30 formed a Schiff's base of 1707–1708 Da (not shown). Fractions 26–30 were pooled and subjected to amino acid sequencing. The first eight amino acids of peptide 2 were clearly detectable. The recovery of the ninth amino acid, a methionine, was markedly reduced, and no signal was obtained for the following five residues (Fig. 3, lower panel). The presence of an FGly residue in a peptide is known to block Edman degradation at the position of the FGly and to reduce the efficiency in the preceding cycle (1Schmidt B. Selmer T. Ingendoh A. von Figura K. Cell. 1995; 82: 271-278Google Scholar, 2Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11068-11963Google Scholar, 3Selmer T. Hallmann A. Schmidt B. Sumper M. von Figura K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 341-345Google Scholar). Thus, amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry using the p-nitroaniline matrix clearly demonstrated the presence of the modified peptide 2* containing the FGly residue in fractions 26–30. The relative frequency of peptide 2 and peptide 2* estimated from the sequencing data was about 2:3. The present data clearly demonstrate that the arylsulfatase fromK. pneumoniae contains an FGly residue at position 72, where its DNA predicts a serine residue. About 40% of the arylsulfatase polypeptides, which were synthesized under conditions of strong induction, still contained the predicted serine 72, suggesting that the capacity of the machinery generating the FGly residue is saturable. FGly 72 in the Klebsiella sulfatase occupies a position that is homologous to that of the FGly residue in eukaryotic sulfatases. Thus, the FGly residue, which is critical for sulfate ester cleavage, is conserved between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The pathways responsible for this unusual protein modification, however, may be different. If in eukaryotic sulfatases the cysteine is replaced by a serine, catalytically inactive sulfatases are formed (6Brooks D.A. Robertson D.A. Bindloss C. Litjens T. Anson D.S. Peters C. Morris C.P. Hopwood J.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 457-463Google Scholar)2in which the serine residue is not converted into FGly.2Whether the prokaryotic machinery converting serine into FGly can also catalyze the conversion of cysteine to FGly remains to be determined. At least one prokaryotic sulfatase is known in Pseudomonas aeruginosa for which the DNA sequence predicts a cysteine at the position occupied by FGly in sulfatases from eukaryotes and K. pneumoniae (10Beil S. Kehrli H. James P. Standemann W. Cook A.M. Leisinger T. Kertesz M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 385-394Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2054050890,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated apoptotic signaling has been characterized by activation of specific protease or protein kinase cascades that regulate the onset of apoptosis. TNF has also been shown to induce oxidative or genotoxic stress in some cell types, and apoptotic potential may be determined by the cellular response to this stress. To determine the role of genotoxic stress in TNF-mediated apoptosis, we examined cellular accumulation of p53 in TNF-treated ME-180 cells selected for apoptotic sensitivity (ME-180S) or resistance (ME-180R) to TNF. Although TNF was able to activate receptor-mediated signaling in either cell line, p53 accumulation was measurable only in apoptotically sensitive ME-180S cells. TNF-induced changes in p53 levels were detected 1 h after treatment, and peak levels were measurable 4–8 h after TNF exposure. TNF was unable to induce p21WAF1 in either cell line but affected the stability of this protein in apoptotically responsive ME-180S cells. Evidence of p21WAF1 proteolysis was detected by monitoring the appearance of a 16-kDa immunoblottable p21WAF1 fragment, which became detectable 4 h after TNF addition and increased in content before the onset of DNA fragmentation (16–24 h). The kinetics of p21WAF1 proteolysis closely paralleled those of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, suggesting cleavage of p21WAF1 by activation of an apoptotic protease. Pretreatment of ME-180S cells with the apoptotic protease inhibitor YVAD blocked TNF-induced apoptosis and prevented both poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and p21WAF1 degradation but did not affect p53 induction. These results provide evidence for the early onset of genotoxic stress in cells committed to TNF-mediated apoptosis and for divergence in propagation of this signal in non-responsive cells. In addition, TNF-induced p21WAF1 proteolysis may be mediated by an apoptotic protease and may contribute to the apoptotic process by disrupting p53 signaling, altering cell cycle inhibition, and limiting cellular recovery from genotoxic stress.

In addition, TNF-induced p21WAF1 proteolysis may be mediated by an apoptotic protease and may contribute to the apoptotic process by disrupting p53 signaling, altering cell cycle inhibition, and limiting cellular recovery from genotoxic stress. The process of cell death or apoptosis has gained wide recognition as an important mediator of organismal development and pathology. Inappropriate onset or defects in sensitivity to an apoptotic stimulus can give rise to a number of clinical conditions including autoimmunity, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer (1Clark H.M. Jones D.B. Wright D.H. J. Pathol. 1992; 166: 129-137Google Scholar, 2Levine A.J. Momard J. Finlay C.A. Nature. 1991; 351: 453-456Google Scholar, 3Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Google Scholar). Therefore, research efforts have focused on understanding both the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis and the elements that constitute an apoptotic signal. While the terminal events in the apoptotic process are evolutionarily conserved and involve activation of proteases with specificity for aspartic acid residues in target proteins (termed caspases; Refs. 4Zhivotovsky B. Burgess D.H. Vanags D.M. Orrenius S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 481-488Google Scholar and 5Fraser A. Evans G. Cell. 1996; 85: 781-784Google Scholar), the elements that signal an apoptotic event and controls that regulate the apoptotic signal are varied and numerous. There have been reports of apoptotic cell death by activation of death cascades coupled to cytokine receptors (6Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Google Scholar, 7Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Google Scholar), withdrawal of growth factors (8Hockenberry D.M. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 631-638Google Scholar), physical alterations in DNA through structural damage after cytotoxic drug exposure or radiation (9McDonnell T.J. Meyn R.E. Robertson L.E. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 53-60Google Scholar, 10Wertz I.E. Hanley M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 359-364Google Scholar, 11Martin S.J. Green D.R. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1994; 6: 616-621Google Scholar) and by expression of specific genes in tumor cells that alter cell cycle control (12Janicke R.V. Lin X.Y. Lee F.H.H. Porter A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5245-5253Google Scholar, 13Meikrantz W. Schlegel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10205-10209Google Scholar). Each of these conditions may increase the level of cellular stress and activate cellular signals that alleviate stress or promote elimination of damaged cells by apoptosis (14Liu Z.G. Baskaran R. Lea-Chou E.T. Wood L.D. Chen Y. Karin M. Yang J.Y.J. Nature. 1996; 384: 273-276Google Scholar, 15Yonish-Rouach E. Experientia (Basel). 1996; 52: 1001-1007Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that cellular or genotoxic stress above a threshold level, controlled by many elements and varied within cell types, will activate a cell death program (16Bellamy C.O. Malcomson R.D. Harrison D.J. Wyllie A.H. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 3-16Google Scholar). Understanding these elements and their coupling to the apoptotic signaling cascade will be of critical importance in understanding and treating diseases associated with aberrant apoptosis. Several proteins have been described that may be involved in regulating cellular stress and stress-induced signaling, and functional defects or alterations in their expression have been associated with specific diseases (1Clark H.M. Jones D.B. Wright D.H. J. Pathol. 1992; 166: 129-137Google Scholar, 2Levine A.J. Momard J. Finlay C.A. Nature. 1991; 351: 453-456Google Scholar, 3Thompson C.B.

Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 3-16Google Scholar). One of the most investigated proteins for which loss of function is associated with cancer is p53, which may function as a critical regulator of genotoxic stress and apoptosis (14Liu Z.G. Baskaran R. Lea-Chou E.T. Wood L.D. Chen Y. Karin M. Yang J.Y.J. Nature. 1996; 384: 273-276Google Scholar, 15Yonish-Rouach E. Experientia (Basel). 1996; 52: 1001-1007Google Scholar, 16Bellamy C.O. Malcomson R.D. Harrison D.J. Wyllie A.H. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 3-16Google Scholar). Studies of the wild-type protein have shown that DNA damage or oxidative stress can enhance the cellular accumulation of this protein by its increased stability in stressed cells (15Yonish-Rouach E. Experientia (Basel). 1996; 52: 1001-1007Google Scholar, 16Bellamy C.O. Malcomson R.D. Harrison D.J. Wyllie A.H. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 3-16Google Scholar, 17Hainaut P. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1995; 7: 76-82Google Scholar). Induced changes in the level of p53 may directly facilitate DNA repair or through transactivation of other genes, inhibit cell cycle progression, or induce apoptosis (15Yonish-Rouach E. Experientia (Basel). 1996; 52: 1001-1007Google Scholar, 16Bellamy C.O. Malcomson R.D. Harrison D.J. Wyllie A.H. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 3-16Google Scholar). Loss of p53 function may allow inappropriate survival of damaged cells and permit the accumulation of DNA damage, further promoting cellular transformation (17Hainaut P. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1995; 7: 76-82Google Scholar, 18Gottlieb T.M. Oren M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 77-102Google Scholar, 19Holstein M. Sidranski D. Vogelstein M. Harris C.C.

Therefore, genotoxic stress surveillance and concomitant p53 accumulation are important primary responses in damaged cells. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.has been shown to initiate several biological activities including apoptosis of some tumor cells (21Beyaert R. Fiers W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 9-16Google Scholar). These activities are mediated through TNF receptor oligomerization, which activates several downstream signaling events including protein kinase and apoptotic protease cascades (22Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Google Scholar, 23Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Google Scholar, 24Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Widmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Google Scholar). Recent identification of proteins with distinct affinities for specific TNF receptor domains and the recruitment of other proteins to these signaling complexes have provided insight into the process of TNF-mediated signaling and apoptosis (22Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Google Scholar, 25Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Google Scholar, 26Muzio M. Chinn A.M. Kischkel F.C.

However, some of the signal cascades activated by TNF are also activable by a number of stress-inducing stimuli, suggesting common stress signals as mediators of TNF signal transduction and apoptosis (24Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Widmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Google Scholar, 27Liu Z. Hus H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Google Scholar). There is also evidence for oxygen radical formation, lipid peroxidation, and other oxidative damage in TNF-treated cells and the signaling pathway that mediates these responses is unknown (21Beyaert R. Fiers W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 9-16Google Scholar, 28Goosens V. Grooten J. DeVos K. Fiers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8115-8119Google Scholar, 29Wong G.H.W. Elwell J.H. Oberly L.W.

Importantly, these responses may be altered in tumor cells that are unable to undergo apoptosis after TNF incubation (21Beyaert R. Fiers W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 9-16Google Scholar, 29Wong G.H.W. Elwell J.H. Oberly L.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1989; 58: 923-931Google Scholar). Therefore, the nature, onset, and requirement of these stress-activated signals in TNF-initiated apoptosis will need to be more fully defined. In the present report, we examine the affects of TNF on p53 accumulation as a measure of the onset of genotoxic stress in ME-180 clonal cells previously selected for apoptotic sensitivity or resistance to TNF (31Donato N.J. Yan D.H. Hung M.C. Rosenblum M.G. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 411-419Google Scholar, 32Perez M. Donato N.J. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1996; 16: 307-314Google Scholar). The results suggest that although TNF activated stress signaling cascades (JNK, NF-κB) in both cell types, early genotoxic stress, as measured by p53 accumulation, was detected only in apoptotically sensitive cells. These results suggest a possible defect in propagation of a genotoxic signal, with little change in TNF receptor-associated signaling in cells resisting TNF-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, p53 accumulation in response to TNF did not result in the induction of p21WAF1 but stimulated its proteolysis with characteristics similar to that of other apoptotic protease substrates (33Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Google Scholar). ME-180S and ME-180R clonal response variants have been previously described and characterized (31Donato N.J. Yan D.H. Hung M.C. Rosenblum M.G. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 411-419Google Scholar, 32Perez M. Donato N.J. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1996; 16: 307-314Google Scholar). 2M. Perez, B. Haschke, and N. J. Donato, submitted for publication.Recent studies have shown similarities between cell lines in TNF-initiated signal transduction but defects in TNF-mediated apoptosis in non-responsive ME-180R cells.2 Cells were tested for quantitative TNF sensitivity by crystal violet assays and apoptotic potential by monitoring the appearance of DNA fragments as described previously (31Donato N.J. Yan D.H. Hung M.C. Rosenblum M.G. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 411-419Google Scholar, 35Nishikawa K. Rotbein J. Vijjeswarapu D. Owen-Schaub L. Rosenblum M.G. Donato N.J. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1994; 13: 37-45Google Scholar).2 Antibodies used in these studies were anti-p53 (Ab-6; Oncogene Sciences, Cambridge, MA), anti-p21WAF1, anti-PARP, (PharMingen, San Diego, CA), anti-bax (N-20), and anti-PCNA (Santa Cruz Biologicals, Santa Cruz, CA). YVAD-cmk was obtained from Bachem (King of Prussia, PA) and was dissolved in Me2SO as a stock solution of 40 mm. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-murine Ig was purchased from Bio-Rad. ECL reagent was obtained from Amersham Corp. and was used according to the procedure provided by the supplier. Recombinant human TNF was kindly provided by Genentech Corp. (South San Francisco, CA). Cells were grown to ∼80% confluence in 60-mm culture dishes (∼2 × 106 cells) and treated with TNF for the interval described. Dishes were placed on ice and rinsed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were released with a cell scraper. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (1 min, 4 °C, 15,000 × g), and the cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After centrifugation (15,000 × g, 15 min), equal protein aliquots from each supernatant were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting. ECL reagent was used for antigen detection in all experiments. Previously, we reported the isolation and characterization of ME-180 clonal populations, which expressed complete sensitivity or resistance to TNF-induced apoptosis (31Donato N.J. Yan D.H. Hung M.C. Rosenblum M.G. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 411-419Google Scholar, 32Perez M. Donato N.J. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1996; 16: 307-314Google Scholar). These studies, and more recent analysis, suggested that resistance to TNF was not associated with TNF receptor-associated signaling defects but was restricted to the loss of TNF-induced apoptosis.2 As shown in Fig. 1, DNA fragmentation was detectable in ME-180S cells 16–24 h after TNF addition but TNF had no affect on DNA integrity in ME-180R cells. Therefore, distinctions in the apoptotic process and other signaling processes were examined and compared in these cell lines. Evidence for accumulation of oxidative molecules and activation of stress responses in TNF-treated cells suggested a possible role for oxidation in TNF action and apoptosis (21Beyaert R. Fiers W.

However, the link between these responses and TNF-induced apoptosis has not been firmly established (21Beyaert R. Fiers W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 9-16Google Scholar, 30Stoian I. Oros A. Moldoveanu E.

Science. 1991; 253: 49-53Google Scholar), the affect of TNF on p53 accumulation was examined in apoptotically responsive and non-responsive ME-180 cells. As shown in Fig. 2, TNF rapidly induced an increase in the level of p53 in apoptotically responsive cells but did not affect p53 levels in resistant cells. One hour after TNF addition, p53 levels were 2-fold greater than control cells and achieved maximal cellular levels (∼4-fold over control) 4–8 h after treatment. Based upon these results, early genotoxic stress and p53 accumulation precede the onset of apoptosis in ME-180 cells. To determine whether p53 induction was regulated by other stress mediators or genotoxic damage, ME-180 cells were exposed to DNA-damaging ultraviolet radiation and p53 levels were compared in control and irradiated cells. As shown in Fig. 3 (left), lysates from either ME-180S or ME-180R irradiated cells expressed elevated levels of p53 when compared with control populations. These results suggest that other stress-inducing stimuli can regulate p53 protein levels in both TNF-sensitive and -resistant ME-180 cells. Induction of p53 has been shown to result in transactivation of several genes that participate and coordinate the cell cycle inhibitory and apoptotic activities of p53 (15Yonish-Rouach E. Experientia (Basel). 1996; 52: 1001-1007Google Scholar, 16Bellamy C.O. Malcomson R.D. Harrison D.J. Wyllie A.H. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 3-16Google Scholar, 17Hainaut P. Curr. Opin.

The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory protein, p21WAF1, has been shown to be regulated by growth factor signaling cascades (36Fan Z. Lu Y. Wu X. DeBlasio A. Koff A. Mendelsohn J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 235-242Google Scholar) and p53 (37Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Google Scholar, 38El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Leu D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Google Scholar) and may control cell cycle progression by changes in its level of expression and affiliation with other proteins (39Shivji M.K. Podust V.N. Hubscher U. Wood R.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5011-5017Google Scholar, 40Pan Z.-Q. Reardon J.T. Li L. Flores-Rozas H. Legerski R. Sancar A. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22008-22016Google Scholar). To determine whether p53 accumulation in DNA-damaged ME-180 cells also induced changes in p21WAF1 levels, cell lysates from UV-irradiated and untreated ME-180 cells were immunoblotted with p21WAF1-directed antibody. As shown in Fig. 3 (right), UV radiation increased p21WAF1 levels in both ME-180S and ME-180R cells, providing evidence for transactivation of genes involved in mediating wild-type p53 downstream activity in either cell type. The influence of TNF-induced p53 accumulation on p21WAF1 expression was also examined in both apoptotically responsive and non-responsive cells. As shown in Fig. 4, TNF failed to induce p21WAF1 in either cell line. However, the stability of p21WAF1 was affected by TNF in ME-180S cells, as determined by the appearance of a 16-kDa p21WAF1 fragment, which correlated with a reduction in the level of the full-length p21WAF1 protein. This cross-reactive protein was detectable 4 h after the addition of TNF and increased in intensity with increasing time after TNF addition. Twenty-four hours after TNF addition and after the onset of DNA fragmentation, p21WAF1 protein was not detectable by immunoblotting apoptotic cell lysates. Other proteins, such as PCNA (as shown in Fig. 4), were unaffected by TNF incubation, providing evidence for specific proteolysis of p21WAF1. Together, the results provide evidence for the induction of p53 and proteolytic processing of p21WAF1 in ME-180S cells before the onset of DNA fragmentation through TNF-initiated apoptosis. To determine whether expression of other p53-regulated proteins was affected by TNF or susceptible to TNF-stimulated proteolysis, bax expression was analyzed in TNF-treated ME-180 cells. Although TNF increased bax protein levels in Sen cells (∼2-fold over control), basal bax levels in R cells were slightly reduced after TNF incubation (Fig. 5). Therefore, under conditions that result in proteolysis of p21WAF1 in ME-180S cells (1 nm TNF, 8–24 h), both p53 and bax protein levels were increased. We were unable to detect evidence for TNF-induced proteolysis of bax in ME-180S or ME-180R cell lysates (Fig. 5). Examination of lysates derived from cells treated with TNF for 8 h yielded similar results (data not shown). Proteolytic processing of specific target proteins, such as PARP, has been shown to occur after a number of apoptotic stimuli (33Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Google Scholar, 41Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyer S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985Google Scholar, 42Tewari M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3255-3260Google Scholar). To determine possible similarities between PARP and p21WAF1 cleavage, the TNF-initiated time-dependent cleavage of PARP was examined and compared with the onset of p21WAF1 proteolysis in ME-180S cells. As shown in Fig. 6, the onset of PARP cleavage was measurable 4–8 h after TNF incubation, and 12 h after TNF addition, only the 85-kDa caspase cleaved PARP fragment was detectable in cell lysates. Additional studies confirmed similarities between the onset of p21WAF1 and PARP proteolysis and the cellular half-lives of these proteins (9–12 h) in TNF-treated ME-180S cells. Apoptotic protease inhibitors have been shown to block the proteolytic degradation of specific target proteins and inhibit apoptosis (33Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Google Scholar, 43Enari M. Hug H. Nagata S. Nature. 1995; 375: 78-81Google Scholar,44Schlegel J. Peters I. Orrenius S. Miller D.K. Thornberry N.A. Yamin T.-T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1841-1844Google Scholar). To determine whether protease inhibition would protect ME-180S cells from TNF-initiated apoptosis, cells were treated with YVAD-cmk (40 μm; Inh) or Me2SO alone (Con) for 1 h before the addition of TNF (1 nm) to cell growth media. Twenty-four hours after TNF addition, cell survival was determined (Fig. 7). TNF reduced cell viability by ∼70% after 24 h, while preincubation with YVAD reduced TNF-induced apoptosis by greater than 2-fold. These results suggest that caspase inhibition suppresses TNF-driven apoptosis in ME-180S cells. To determine whether YVAD pretreatment also inhibited PARP cleavage, ME-180S and ME-180R cells were pretreated with YVAD (40 μm) for 60 min before the addition of 1 nmTNF for 9 h. Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for PARP cleavage by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 8, TNF induced PARP proteolysis in ME-180S cells but had no effect on PARP expressed in ME-180R cells. The tetrapeptide analogue YVAD-cmk was an effective inhibitor of TNF-mediated PARP proteolysis (and apoptosis) in ME-180S cells.Figure 8Effect of YVAD-cmk on TNF-mediated PARP cleavage in ME-180 cells. ME-180 Sen (left) or Res (right) cells were treated with buffer alone (Con), TNF alone (1 nm), or pretreated with YVAD-cmk (40 μm) for 1 h before the addition of 1 nm TNF (TNF+YVAD). Ten hours after TNF addition, cell lysates were prepared and equal protein aliquots were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted for PARP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The effect of YVAD on TNF-initiated p21WAF1 proteolysis was also examined in TNF-sensitive and -resistant ME-180 cells. As shown in Fig. 9, when p21WAF1 was examined 8 h after the addition of TNF, the 16-kDa fragment was again detectable and its appearance correlated with a concomitant decrease in the level of full-length p21WAF1 in apoptotically sensitive ME-180S cells. The 16-kDa fragment was not detected in ME-180R cells under similar conditions (longer film exposures also failed to provide evidence for a 16-kDa fragment in ME-180R cells). YVAD treatment alone (9 h; 40 μm) failed to alter p21WAF1 levels in either cell line. Pretreatment with YVAD (1 h) effectively blocked proteolysis of p21WAF1 when analyzed 8 h after TNF addition. Similar results were obtained with the CPP32 caspase inhibitor (43Enari M. Hug H. Nagata S. Nature. 1995; 375: 78-81Google Scholar, 44Schlegel J. Peters I. Orrenius S. Miller D.K. Thornberry N.A. Yamin T.-T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1841-1844Google Scholar), DEVD (data not shown). Together, these results provide evidence for the possible involvement of apoptotic proteases as mediators of p21WAF1 cleavage in ME-180S and their deficiency in ME-180R cells. To determine whether TNF-induced p53 accumulation required activation of apoptotic proteases as cellular stress mediators, p53 levels were measured in control and YVAD-pretreated ME-180S after TNF incubation. As shown in Fig. 10, TNF induced a 3-fold increase in cellular p53 levels in the presence or absence of YVAD, suggesting that p53 accumulation in TNF-treated ME-180S cells does not require early activation of a YVAD-sensitive protease. In this report, the distinctions in specific genotoxic stress signals were investigated in ME-180 cells selected for sensitivity or resistance to TNF-induced apoptosis. We had shown previously that TNF signaling was not defective in resistant cells since both JNK and NF-κB, activities mediated through TRADD/TRAF2 recruitment to the TNF receptor complex (27Liu Z. Hus H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Google Scholar), were activated by TNF in either cell line.2 Importantly, in this study, we demonstrate that p53 accumulation occurred rapidly after TNF exposure in apoptotically sensitive cells and preceded the onset of PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation. Despite evidence for activation of stress signaling by TNF in resistant cells, there was no evidence for alterations in p53 levels in resistant cells. Mutations in p53 and general defects in apoptosis in ME-180R cells do not appear to account for the loss of sensitivity to TNF since other apoptotic stimuli (cis-platinum, adriamycin, radiation) were able to induce equivalent or greater levels of apoptosis in ME-180R and ME-180S cells (45Nishikawa K. Rosenblum M.G. Newman R.A. Pandita T.K. Hittelman W.N. Donato N.J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4758-4765Google Scholar). In addition, both p53 and p21WAF1 levels could be coordinately elevated in response to DNA damage in either cell line (UV exposure; Fig. 3). Other TNF-sensitive cell lines with wild-type p53 function (MCF-7) have also been shown to accumulate p53 in response to TNF (46Jeoung D. Tang B. Sonenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18367-18373Google Scholar), and our studies of MCF-7 cells have shown similar rapid accumulation of p53 only in apoptotically responsive MCF-7 cells but not in a TNF-resistant MCF-7 variant. Since p53 has been shown to be a universal sensor of genotoxic stress (14Liu Z.G. Baskaran R. Lea-Chou E.T. Wood L.D. Chen Y. Karin M. Yang J.Y.J. Nature. 1996; 384: 273-276Google Scholar, 15Yonish-Rouach E. Experientia (Basel). 1996; 52: 1001-1007Google Scholar, 16Bellamy C.O. Malcomson R.D. Harrison D.J. Wyllie A.H. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 3-16Google Scholar, 17Hainaut P. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1995; 7: 76-82Google Scholar, 18Gottlieb T.M. Oren M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 77-102Google Scholar), our results suggest that TNF-induced genotoxic stress may be an early marker of commitment to apoptosis in ME-180 and other cell types. It is clear, however, that TNF-induced apoptosis can occur in p53-deficient tumor cells (MDA-MB-361; Ref. 47Shepard H.M. Lewis G.D. J. Clin. Immunol. 1988; 8: 333-341Google Scholar) and those expressing mutations in the p53 gene (BT-20; Refs. 48Bartek J. Iggo R. Gannon J. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 893-899Google Scholar and 49Bellomo G. Perotti M. Taddei F. Mirabelli F. Finardi G. Nicotera P. Orrenius S. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1342-1346Google Scholar). Therefore, p53 induction may not contribute to TNF-mediated apoptosis in all tumor types but may participate in stress signaling and destabilization of cell survival in some populations. The cellular mediator of TNF-promoted p53 accumulation and genotoxic stress is unknown but is currently being investigated. Importantly this activity appears to be upstream of cellular activation of apoptotic proteases and does not appear to be correlated with activation of other stress signaling cascades (such as JNK; Refs. 14Liu Z.G. Baskaran R. Lea-Chou E.T. Wood L.D. Chen Y. Karin M. Yang J.Y.J. Nature. 1996; 384: 273-276Google Scholar and 27Liu Z. Hus H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Google Scholar) or require the early activation of an apoptotic protease cascade. Tumor cell sensitivity to TNF-induced apoptosis may be determined by the combined but independent activation of stress and stress response signaling events (such as those mediating p53 accumulation) as well as those controlling activation of caspase cascades. Examination of the downstream effectors of p53 in TNF-treated ME-180S cells provided evidence for the proteolytic processing of p21WAF1 but not other p53-regulated proteins (e.g. bax; Fig. 5). The onset of p21WAF1 proteolysis was similar to that of PARP and was inhibited by protease inhibitors active in protecting cells from apoptosis. Neither PARP or p21WAF1 proteolysis was detected in ME-180R cells after TNF incubation, providing evidence for defects in TNF-mediated protease activation in these cells that correlate with specific loss of TNF-directed apoptosis. Therefore, this study provides first evidence for p21WAF1 proteolysis in TNF-mediated apoptosis and is one of the first reports of tumor cell resistance to TNF through specific loss of a TNF-activated protease cascade (25Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Google Scholar, 26Muzio M. Chinn A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Schevchenki A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Google Scholar, 27Liu Z. Hus H. Goeddel D.V. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 565-576Google Scholar). The specific defects in this cascade have not as yet been determined, but initial evidence suggests defects in TNF receptor-complexing caspases but not downstream apoptotic proteases. Importantly, TNF-stimulated degradation of p21WAF1 may be mediated by specific proteases expressed in ME-180 cells since p21WAF1 degradation has not been described in other cell lines that induce p53 in response to TNF (46Jeoung D. Tang B. Sonenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18367-18373Google Scholar). Preliminary mapping of the proteolyzed p21WAF1 protein suggests that TNF-induced truncation of its C terminus produced the p16 fragment detectable by immunoblotting. If caspases are involved in the proteolysis of p21WAF1, aspartic acid residue cleavage site specificity of these proteases restricts the number of possible target sites on the p21WAF1 protein. Only four potential candidate cleavages sites exist in the C terminus of this protein, and only two of these would yield fragments of the appropriate size as those detected by immunoblotting (37Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Google Scholar, 38El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Leu D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Google Scholar). These include Asp-109 and Asp-112, and the DHVD sequence bracketed by these aspartic acid residues bears similarity to the cleavage site on PARP (DEVD) recognized by CPP32 (33Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Google Scholar, 42Tewari M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3255-3260Google Scholar, 43Enari M. Hug H. Nagata S. Nature. 1995; 375: 78-81Google Scholar). Cleavage of this protein in vitro with recombinant protease will provide additional support for direct p21WAF1 proteolysis by apoptotic proteases. p21WAF1 has been shown to suppress cell cycle progression by inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases (37Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Google Scholar, 38El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Leu D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Google Scholar). However, recent studies have shown that the expression of this protein may be regulated by growth stimulatory cascades, suggesting a more complex role for p21WAF1 in regulating cell cycle transition and evidence of a role for this protein in feedback regulation of growth factor-stimulated proliferation (36Fan Z. Lu Y. Wu X. DeBlasio A. Koff A. Mendelsohn J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 235-242Google Scholar). In addition, the existence of p21WAF1 in both an active and inactive state suggests that association of this inhibitor with other proteins may alter its function and nuclear distribution (50Zhang H. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1750-1758Google Scholar). PCNA may play an important role in this sequestering by its affinity for the C terminus of p21WAF1 and its proposed role in DNA replication and excisional repair of DNA lesions (39Shivji M.K. Podust V.N. Hubscher U. Wood R.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5011-5017Google Scholar, 40Pan Z.-Q. Reardon J.T. Li L. Flores-Rozas H. Legerski R. Sancar A. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22008-22016Google Scholar, 51Li R. Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 371: 534-537Google Scholar). TNF-induced p21WAF1 proteolysis may alter the association of cdk with PCNA and disrupt the nature of the replication or repair complex. In addition, studies have shown that enhancement or disruption of cdk enzymatic activity alone can stimulate or repress TNF-induced apoptosis, respectively (12Janicke R.V. Lin X.Y. Lee F.H.H. Porter A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5245-5253Google Scholar, 13Meikrantz W. Schlegel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10205-10209Google Scholar). Interestingly, others have shown that expression of a C-terminally truncated form of p21WAF1, such that PCNA binding is disrupted, results in the slow onset of apoptosis (52Prabhu N.S. Blagosklonny M.V. Zeng Y.X. Wu G.S. Waldman T. El-Deiry W.S. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 1221-1229Google Scholar). Thus, evidence suggests that modulation of cdk function and PCNA association with p21WAF1 may influence the apoptotic sensitivity of cells. TNF-induced proteolysis of p21WAF1 may alter both functions by first reducing PCNA/p21WAF1/cdk association and subsequently affecting cdk activity by loss of its cdk inhibitory effects through its accelerated degradation in apoptotic cells. This may contribute to the changes in cell cycle progression seen in TNF-treated cells (53Shih S.C. Stutman O. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1591-1598Google Scholar, 54Belizario J.E. Dinarello C.A. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2379-2385Google Scholar, 55Darzynkiewicz Z. Williamson B. Carswell E.A. Old L. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 83-90Google Scholar). In this report, evidence for TNF-induced genotoxic stress and p53 accumulation in ME-180 cells committed to undergo apoptosis is presented. The accumulation of p53 as genotoxic damage is surveyed may induce the recruitment of repair proteins, which are known targets of apoptotic proteases (56Casciola-Rosen L. Nicholson D.W. Chong T. Rowan K.R. Thornberry N.A. Miller D.K. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1957-1964Google Scholar). Both PARP and PCNA have been shown to play a role in DNA repair and may assemble at sites of DNA damage (39Shivji M.K. Podust V.N. Hubscher U. Wood R.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5011-5017Google Scholar, 40Pan Z.-Q. Reardon J.T. Li L. Flores-Rozas H. Legerski R. Sancar A. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22008-22016Google Scholar, 44Schlegel J.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1591-1598Google Scholar). Complex formation between the C terminus of p21WAF1 and PCNA may direct p21WAF1 to the repair site and in proximity to activated caspases with affinity for other repair protein substrates (PARP). Proteins with sensitive aspartic acid sequences (e.g. DHVD in p21WAF1) may also present as specific targets of these proteases. Importantly, PCNA was not cleaved in TNF-treated cells, demonstrating target protein specificity. The identity of the protease active in cleaving p21WAF1 is unknown and additional analysis of the role of p21WAF1 proteolysis in apoptosis is required. However, although the mechanism is unknown, studies by other investigator have already provided evidence of a role for a truncated p21WAF1 in apoptosis (52Prabhu N.S. Blagosklonny M.V. Zeng Y.X. Wu G.S. Waldman T. El-Deiry W.S. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 1221-1229Google Scholar). We have reported that early activation of the apoptotic signal in ME-180 cells results in p53 accumulation and evidence of genotoxic stress that were not detectable in cells unable to commit to TNF-mediated apoptosis. Stress-induced p53 accumulation and TNF-mediated caspase activation may lead to the proteolysis of p21WAF1 and commit cells to apoptosis by altering p53 effectors, cell cycle controls, and recovery from genotoxic stress. Since p21WAF1 expression is involved in protection against a variety of apoptotic stimuli (34Zhang W. Kornblau S.M. Kobayashi T. Gambel A. Claxton D. Deisseroth A.B. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 1051-1057Google Scholar,57Gorospe M. Wang X. Guyton K.Z. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 6654-6660Google Scholar), its proteolytic degradation may be an appropriate target of some apoptotic proteases."
https://openalex.org/W2004565358,"Abstract Early atherosclerotic lesions are characterized by the presence of cholesterol-rich, macrophage-derived foam cells. It has recently been shown that macrophage proliferation occurs during the development of early lesions and that oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL) stimulates macrophage growth. Possible mechanisms for this induction of macrophage growth include potentiation of mitogenic signal transduction by a component of oxidized LDL following internalization and degradation, interaction with integral plasma membrane proteins coupled to signaling pathways, or direct or indirect activation of growth factor receptors on the cell surface (e.g. GM-CSF receptor) through an autocrine/paracrine mechanism. The present study was undertaken to characterize some of the early intracellular signaling events by which oxidized LDL mediates macrophage cell growth. Extensively oxidized LDL increased protein-tyrosine phosphorylation and caused a 2-fold increase in phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase activity in phorbol ester-pretreated THP-1 cells (a human monocyte-like cell line). Similar concentrations of native LDL had no effect. Oxidized LDL also stimulated growth of resident mouse peritoneal macrophages, and this effect was reduced by 40–50% in cells treated with PI 3-kinase inhibitors (100 nm wortmannin or 20 μmLY294002). These results suggest that PI 3-kinase mediates part of the mitogenic effect of oxidized LDL, but parallel pathways involving other receptors and signal transduction pathways are likely also involved."
https://openalex.org/W2087277315,"G13 belongs to the G12 family of heterotrimeric G proteins, whose effectors are poorly defined. The present study was designed to test if phospholipase D (PLD) is regulated by G13 and if Rho-type small GTPases are involved. Expression of the constitutively active Q226L mutant of the α-subunit of G13 in COS-7 cells stimulated the activity of a rat brain phospholipase D isozyme (rPLD1) co-expressed in the cells. Wild type Gα13 was ineffective unless the cells were incubated with AlF4−. rPLD1 was previously shown to be activated by constitutively active V14RhoA in COS-7 cells (Park, S. K., Provost, J. J., Bae, C. D., Ho, W. T., and Exton, J. H. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 29263–29272). When the endogenous Rho proteins of the cells were inactivated by treatment with C3 exoenzyme fromClostridium botulinum, the ability of Gα13Q226L to activate rPLD1 was greatly attenuated. Co-transfection of dominant negative N19RhoA and N17Rac-1, but not N17Cdc42Hs or N17Ras, also inhibited the activation. Expression of constitutively active Gαq in COS-7 cells also activated rPLD1, but constitutively active forms of Gαi2 and Gαs were without effect. These findings support an effector role for PLD in G13 signaling and demonstrate a requirement for Rho GTPases in this response.

J., Bae, C. D., Ho, W. T., and Exton, J. H. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 29263–29272). When the endogenous Rho proteins of the cells were inactivated by treatment with C3 exoenzyme fromClostridium botulinum, the ability of Gα13Q226L to activate rPLD1 was greatly attenuated. Co-transfection of dominant negative N19RhoA and N17Rac-1, but not N17Cdc42Hs or N17Ras, also inhibited the activation. Expression of constitutively active Gαq in COS-7 cells also activated rPLD1, but constitutively active forms of Gαi2 and Gαs were without effect. These findings support an effector role for PLD in G13 signaling and demonstrate a requirement for Rho GTPases in this response. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) 1The abbreviations used are: PC, phosphatidylcholine; PLD, phospholipase D; PA, phosphatidic acid; PKC, protein kinase C; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase. specific phospholipase D (PLD) hydrolyzes its substrate into phosphatidic acid (PA) and choline in response to growth factors and G protein-coupled receptor agonists (1Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Google Scholar). PA may act as a lipid messenger in the cell, inducing cytoskeletal rearrangements or growth-regulatory responses, and is implicated in the regulation of NADPH-oxidase and intracellular membrane trafficking and fusion events (1Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Google Scholar, 2Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Google Scholar). PA can also be converted to the protein kinase C (PKC) activator diacylglycerol by phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase or to the G protein-coupled receptor agonist lysophosphatidic acid by a PA-specific phospholipase A2(1Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Google Scholar). Analysis of PLD activity from various tissues and subcellular fractions supports the existence of biochemically distinct isozymes differing in subcellular localization and responses to Ca2+, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), oleate, and detergents in vitro (1Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Google Scholar, 3Liscovitch M. Chalifa-Caspi V. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 80: 37-44Google Scholar). Studies of signal transduction pathways in intact cells support the involvement of PKC and Rho GTPases in the regulation of PLD (1Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Google Scholar, 2Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Google Scholar). In vitro experiments confirm a direct regulatory role for PKC, Rho-family, and ARF GTPases in PLD activation (1Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Google Scholar, 2Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Google Scholar). PIP2 also activates PLD in vitro and may be required for PLD regulation in vivo(1Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Google Scholar). Mammalian PLD isoforms have been cloned including hPLD1a, hPLD1b, hPLD2, and rPLD2 (4Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Sung T.-C. Rudge S.A. Rose K.

Cadwallender K. Gu Q.-m. Cook S. Nozawa Y. Prestwich G.D. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3860-3868Google Scholar). hPLD2 is also PC-specific, has high basal activity bothin vitro and in vivo, and is activated by PIP2, but not PKC, ARF, or RhoA (6Colley W.C. Sung T.-C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammonds S.M. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Google Scholar). rPLD1, cloned in our laboratory from a rat brain library using a fragment of hPLD1, is 91% identical to hPLD1b in amino acid sequence and is expressed in a wide variety of tissues (8Park S.K. Provost J.J. Bae C.D. Ho W.T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29263-29272Google Scholar). It is stimulated when co-expressed with constitutively active V14RhoA in COS-7 cells (8Park S.K. Provost J.J. Bae C.D. Ho W.T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29263-29272Google Scholar) and also by treatment of the cells with a PKC-activating phorbol ester (8Park S.K. Provost J.J. Bae C.D. Ho W.T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29263-29272Google Scholar) or lysophosphatidic acid. 2S. K. Park, D. S. Min, and J. H. Exton, unpublished observations. Like hPLD1, rPLD1 is activated directly by RhoA, Arf, and PKCα in vitro.2 The Rho-related G proteins Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 are members of the Ras superfamily of low molecular weight GTPases. They regulate multiple downstream effects, including the contractility and organization of the actin cytoskeleton (9Nobes C. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 77-81Google Scholar, 10Nobes C.

Rho is required for cytoskeletal, transcriptional, and PLD responses to some G protein-coupled receptor agonists (2Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Google Scholar, 12Ridley A.J. Curr.

J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13135-13139Google Scholar), although the pathways involved and the precise nature of the Rho-requirement remain to be defined. G13, a member of the G12 family of heterotrimeric G proteins, was first identified by the cDNA cloning of its α-subunit (15Strathmann M.P. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5582-5586Google Scholar, 16Dhanasekaran N. Dermott J.M. Cell. Signalling. 1996; 8: 235-245Google Scholar). G13 is expressed in most cell lines and tissues and is especially abundant in human platelets (17Milligan G. Mullaney I. Mitchell F.M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 297: 186-188Google Scholar). G13 is coupled to platelet thrombin and thromboxane A2 receptors (18Offermanns S. Laugwitz K.L. Spicher K. Schultz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 504-508Google Scholar, 19Harhammer R. Nurnberg B. Harteneck C. Leopoldt D. Exner T. Schultz G. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 165-171Google Scholar), suggesting a possible role in platelet activation. Immediate downstream effectors have not been identified for the G12 family, although downstream effects resulting from overexpression of constitutively active mutant forms of Gα12 and Gα13 have been described, including neoplastic transformation of cultured fibroblasts (20Xu N.

A number of these effects can be blocked by dominant negative mutant forms of Rho-related G proteins, indicating a requirement at some level for these low molecular weight GTPases (13Fromm C.

The present study examines if PLD is a downstream effector of G13 and if Rho family GTPases are involved in the signal transduction pathway. A partial Gα13 cDNA, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplified from mouse brain total RNA, was used to clone a full-length cDNA from a mouse liver cDNA library (Stratagene) using standard methods. A Gα13Q226L mutant was made by overlap-extension polymerase chain reaction and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Wild type and Q226L were subcloned into the HindIII and EcoRI sites of the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). rPLD1 in pcDNA3 (8Park S.K. Provost J.J. Bae C.D. Ho W.T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29263-29272Google Scholar), N19RhoA in pcDNA3, and GαqQ209L in pCMV4 were described previously (31Venkatakrishnan G. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5066-5072Google Scholar). GαsQL and Gαi2QL in pcDNA3 were provided by Dr. N. Dhanasekaran (Temple University, Philadelphia, PA), N17Cdc42 in pcDNA3 was provided by Dr. Shubha Bagrodia (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY), and N17Rac-1 in pCGT was provided by Dr. Linda Van Aelst (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). COS-7 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagles's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) plus 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) under 5% CO2. Six-well plates were seeded with 2 × 105 cells/well and transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA and 6 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) per well according to the manufacturer's instructions. Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) was substituted for Dulbecco's modified Eagles's medium during reduced serum incubations. Cells were washed 24 h post-transfection, twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and once with scraping buffer (114 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 5.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-Cl pH 7.4) and then scraped off the plate in the absence or presence of 5 μg/mlClostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme (List Biologicals) as described (14Malcolm K.C Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13135-13139Google Scholar). Cells were replated on polylysine and serum-starved 12 h later. Cells were serum-starved (0.5% fetal bovine serum in Opti-MEM) at 24 h post-transfection for 16 h in the presence of 1 μCi/ml [3H]myristate (NEN Life Science Products), washed with PBS, and incubated in serum-free medium (Opti-MEM) for 50 min. PLD activity was then assayed as described previously (14Malcolm K.C Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13135-13139Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in 0.3% 1-butanol for the indicated times. Cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS and stopped with methanol. Lipids were extracted, and the phosphatidylbutanol product was resolved by thin layer chromatography as described (14Malcolm K.C Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13135-13139Google Scholar). Bands co-migrating with a phosphatidylbutanol standard were quantitated by scintillation counting. To study the effect of G13 signaling on PLD, we expressed wild type Gα13 and GTPase-deficient, constitutively active Gα13Q226L together with a Rho-responsive PLD isoform, rPLD1, by liposome-mediated transient transfection of COS-7 cells. High level expression of the proteins and similar levels of rPLD1 expression between different co-transfections were confirmed by Western analysis (not shown). Expression of wild type Gα13 had little or no effect on either endogenous PLD activity or that of rPLD1. Gα13Q226L also had no effect on the activity of the endogenous PLD, but markedly stimulated rPLD1 activity (Fig. 1 A). This activation of rPLD1 by Gα13Q226L was consistent with an effector role for PLD in G13 signaling. However, since Gα13signaling was chronically activated by the prolonged expression of the Q226L mutant in this experiment, it was not clear how direct or indirect the activation of rPLD1 might be. To rule out mechanisms arising from long term activation of the pathway or consequently altered expression of PLD regulators, we examined Gα13 signaling in an acutely regulated system. Aluminum fluoride activates heterotrimeric G proteins due to its ability to mimic the γ-phosphoryl group of GTP when complexed with the GDP-bound α-subunit (32Wu D.Q. Lee C.H. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1811-1817Google Scholar). We expressed wild type Gα13 with and without rPLD1 and then treated the cells with aluminum fluoride for 30 min (Fig. 1 B). Fluoride treatment of the cells yielded a small stimulation of the endogenous PLD activity, which was not affected by overexpression of wild type Gα13. rPLD1 activity was potently stimulated by fluoride treatment when co-expressed with Gα13, but not when expressed alone. This Gα13-dependent acute stimulation of rPLD1 by aluminum fluoride effectively rules out mechanisms requiring long term activation of Gα13 and is consistent with an effector role for PLD in G13 signaling. To investigate the potential role of Rho in the regulation of rPLD1 by Gα13, we inhibited its function by treating the cells with C3 exoenzyme fromC. botulinum, an ADP-ribosyltransferase that inactivates Rho (33Dillon S.T. Feig L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 174-184Google Scholar). Efficient ADP-ribosylation was confirmed by in vitroassays with C3 (33Dillon S.T. Feig L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 174-184Google Scholar), which showed that cellular Rho from the C3-scraped cells was efficiently modified as indicated by a subsequent loss of ADP-ribosylation in vitro (Fig. 2 A). We then looked at the effect of C3 toxin on the activation of rPLD1 by Gα13Q226L. C3 had little or no effect on the endogenous PLD activity or that of the expressed rPLD1. It did, however, significantly diminish the effect of Gα13Q226L on rPLD1 activity, consistent with a requirement for Rho in the activation of rPLD1 by active Gα13 (Fig. 2 B). To further address the requirement for Rho and related GTPases, we expressed dominant negative mutant forms of these G proteins together with Gα13Q226L and rPLD1 and measured PLD activity. These dominant negative mutants are thought to inhibit signaling through endogenous Rho-related small G proteins by forming stable, inactive complexes with guanine nucleotide exchange factors required for their activation (34Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4822-4829Google Scholar). N17Ras, N19RhoA, N17Rac, and N17Cdc42 alone had no effect on rPLD1 activity (not shown). When co-expressed with both Gα13Q226L and rPLD1, N19RhoA and N17Rac partially blocked the activation of rPLD1 while N17Ras and N17Cdc42 did not (Fig. 3). Combination of N19RhoA and N17Rac completely blocked the activation. These results are consistent with a requirement for exchange factor-mediated regulation of Rho family GTPases such as Rho and Rac in the activation of rPLD1 by constitutively active Gα13. To determine the selectivity of G12 family proteins in the activation of rPLD1, we examined its regulation by other heterotrimeric G protein α-subunits. Accordingly, we expressed mutationally active α-subunits of the G12, Gq, Gi, and Gs families with and without rPLD1 and then measured PLD activity (Fig. 4). We found that the activity of rPLD1 was potently stimulated by constitutively active Gα13Q226L and GαqQ209L, but not by Gαi2Q205L or GαsQ227L. This report supports the hypothesis that rPLD1, a widely expressed rat hPLD1b homolog, serves as a downstream effector in G13signaling. Both mutational activation and fluoride stimulation of expressed Gα13 led to potent stimulation of co-expressed rPLD1 activity (Fig. 1). 3The related Gα12Q229L was also found to activate rPLD1 (S. G. Plonk and J. H. Exton, unpublished observations). The acute regulation by fluoride-stimulated Gα13 rules out mechanisms requiring long term activation of the pathway and is consistent with an effector role for rPLD1. 4Acute activation of rPLD1 was also observed in thromboxane A2-treated COS cells expressing thromboxane A2 receptors (S. G. Plonk and J. H. Exton, unpublished observations). Mutational and fluoride-stimulated activation of Gα13 had no effect on endogenous PLD (Fig. 1). This is probably due to differences between rPLD1 and the endogenous PLD in COS cells. Previous work in this laboratory has indicated the absence of Rho-reponsive PLD activity in COS cells (8Park S.K. Provost J.J. Bae C.D. Ho W.T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29263-29272Google Scholar). This has been observed both in cells transfected with V14RhoA and also with in vitro assays performed by incubation of COS cell extracts with RhoA and GTPS (8Park S.K. Provost J.J. Bae C.D. Ho W.T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29263-29272Google Scholar). In both cases, the Rho response could be reconstituted by expression of rPLD1 (8Park S.K. Provost J.J. Bae C.D. Ho W.T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29263-29272Google Scholar). We found that C3 toxin, which is selective for Rho (33Dillon S.T. Feig L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 174-184Google Scholar), significantly blocked rPLD1 activation by Gα13 (Fig. 2). Dominant negative N19RhoA and N17Rac-1 alone partially but significantly blocked rPLD1 activation and, in combination, completely blocked the effect (Fig. 3). These data support a requirement for guanine nucleotide exchange factor-dependent regulation of Rho family G proteins such as Rho and Rac in this response (34Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4822-4829Google Scholar). Cytochalasin D treatment of the cells did not block the response (not shown), suggesting that the inhibitory effects of C3 toxin, N19RhoA, and N17Rac are not simply due to a general disruption of signaling responses as a consequence of altered cytoskeletal organization or function induced by these treatments. All together, these data are consistent with the involvement of Rho family G proteins in the signaling pathway between Gα13 and rPLD1. We showed that rPLD1 was also activated by mutationally active Gαq, but not by Gαi2 or Gαs. This observation is consistent with reports of PLD activation by Gq-coupled receptors and PKC-activating phorbol esters (1Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Google Scholar). rPLD1 is stimulated by the α- and β-isozymes of PKC in vitro 2 and by phorbol ester when expressed in COS-7 cells (8Park S.K. Provost J.J. Bae C.D. Ho W.T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29263-29272Google Scholar). Our results indicate that rPLD1 is selectively activated by α-subunits of the G12 and Gq families, although βγ-subunit mediated regulation of rPLD1 or activation of other PLD isoforms by heterotrimeric G proteins other than Gq and G12 family members remain a possibility. Gα13Q226L expression triggers actin stress fiber formation and focal adhesion assembly (26Buhl A.M. Johnson N.L. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Google Scholar), JNK activation (27Collins L.R. Minden A. Karin M. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17349-17353Google Scholar, 28Voyno-Yasenetskya T.A. Faure M.P.

Hooley R. Lin C.-Y. Orlowski J. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22604-22610Google Scholar), serum response element-dependent gene transcription (13Fromm C. Coso O.A. Montaner S. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10098-10103Google Scholar), and apoptosis (30Althoefer H. Eversole-Cire P. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24380-24386Google Scholar) by pathways also inhibited by dominant negative Rho family G proteins. For several reasons, rPLD1 activation is likely to occur either upstream of these effects or by an entirely separate pathway. First, Rho family G proteins are direct regulators of rPLD13 (5Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallender K. Gu Q.-m. Cook S. Nozawa Y. Prestwich G.D. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3860-3868Google Scholar), while the Gα13-mediated effects listed above are likely to be downstream of a cascade of Rho-initiated signals. Second, cytochalasin D disrupts cytoskeletal responses, but did not inhibit rPLD1 activation (not shown). Apoptotic responses and gene induction typically require hours to develop, while rPLD1 is activated within minutes by fluoride-stimulated Gα13(Fig. 1). Finally, activation of the JNK cascade by Gα13in COS-7 cells is blocked by N17Ras, but not N19RhoA (27Collins L.R. Minden A. Karin M. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17349-17353Google Scholar, 28Voyno-Yasenetskya T.A. Faure M.P. Ahn N.G. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21081-21087Google Scholar, 29Mitsui H. Takuwa N. Kurokawa K. Exton J.H. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4904-4910Google Scholar), while rPLD1 activation is blocked by N19RhoA, but not N17Ras (Fig. 3). Phospholipases are key components of transmembrane signal transduction pathways. PLD-catalyzed production of phosphatidylcholine-derived messengers could mediate critical downstream responses in G13 signaling. Further study is needed to more precisely define the role of PLD in G13-mediated responses. We suggest that G13 may play a role in the regulation of Rho-responsive PLD activity by G protein-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2029165441,"The eIF4 group initiation factors are required for cap-dependent translation initiation. Infection of mammalian cells by picornaviruses results in proteolytic cleavage of one of these factors, eIF4G, which severely restricts cap-dependent initiation but permits cap-independent initiation to proceed from an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in picornaviral RNAs. The first 357 nucleotides (nt) of the 5′-untranslated region of eIF4G mRNA also contains an IRES. Using bicistronic constructs for expression in K562 cells, we have now shown that progressive deletions of the 5′-untranslated region can have either stimulatory or inhibitory effects. Furthermore, a 101-nt segment exhibits full IRES activity, and an 81-nt segment exhibits detectable IRES activity. A polypyrimidine tract (PPT) at the 3′ terminus is essential for internal initiation, a property which is characteristic of picornaviral IRESs but not the other host cellular IRESs studied to date. IRES activity does not require sequences beyond 357 nt. Out-of-frame AUGs have no effect on IRES-driven luciferase expression when introduced upstream of the PPT but markedly decrease expression when introduced at sites between the PPT and the authentic initiation codon at nt 369. These results suggest that the ribosomal subunit enters at or near the PPT and then scans downstream for the initiation codon.

These results suggest that the ribosomal subunit enters at or near the PPT and then scans downstream for the initiation codon. Initiation of nearly all eukaryotic mRNAs proceeds by a cap-dependent mechanism whereby the AUG nearest the 5′-end serves as the initiation codon (1Kozak M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 197-225Google Scholar). Yet other modes of initiation codon selection are used in special cases, e.g. leaky scanning, termination-reinitiation, ribosome shunting, and internal initiation (2Jackson R.J. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 71-112Google Scholar). In the latter case, ribosomes are directed to internal AUGs by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). 1The abbreviations used are: IRES, internal ribosome entry site; 5′-UTR, 5′-untranslated region; BiP, immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein; nt, nucleotide(s); CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; LUC, luciferase; nt, nucleotide; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PPT, polypyrimidine tract.1The abbreviations used are: IRES, internal ribosome entry site; 5′-UTR, 5′-untranslated region; BiP, immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein; nt, nucleotide(s); CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; LUC, luciferase; nt, nucleotide; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PPT, polypyrimidine tract.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1714-1721Google Scholar). Picornaviral IRESs have been the most characterized to date (3Ehrenfeld E. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 549-573Google Scholar). The minimal size of picornaviral IRESs is ∼450 nt, with further deletion into this sequence dramatically decreasing IRES activity. These IRESs have been divided into three groups: (i) entero- and rhinoviruses, (ii) cardio- and aphthoviruses, and (iii) hepatoviruses. Within each group, there is strong conservation of IRES secondary structure, somewhat less conservation of primary structure, but little conservation between groups apart from the existence of a polypyrimidine tract (PPT) located ∼25 nt from the 3′-end of the IRES and a 3′-terminal AUG. The precise sequence of the PPT is important for IRES function in entero- and rhinoviruses but not cardioviruses (2Jackson R.J. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 71-112Google Scholar). Several host cellular proteins bind to, and in some cases stimulate translation from, picornaviral IRESs, including La (13Meerovitch K. Svitkin Y.V. Lee H.S. Lejbkowicz F. Kenan D.J. Chan E.K.L.

RNA. 1995; 1: 924-938Google Scholar) and eIF4G (18Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Hellen C.U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6870-6878Google Scholar). The mechanisms of initiation codon selection in picornaviral IRESs are likewise divided into three models. For cardioviruses such as encephalomyocarditis virus, and perhaps hepatoviruses as well, the 40 S ribosomal subunit is thought to enter at the 3′-terminal AUG of the IRES and use it as the translation initiation codon (the “landing” model). For entero- and rhinoviruses, the ribosomal subunit appears to enter at the same AUG but then scans for the next downstream AUG (the “scanning” model). The aphthoviruses, e.g. foot and mouth disease virus, may combine landing and scanning, as translation initiates at both the 3′-terminal AUG of the IRES and also at the next downstream AUG. Another determinant of IRES utilization is the host protein synthesis machinery. Under normal conditions, most mRNAs utilize the cap-dependent translation pathway, but in cells infected with entero-, rhino-, and aphthoviruses, this pathway is shut down and viral mRNAs use instead a cap-independent mechanism (3Ehrenfeld E. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 549-573Google Scholar). The switch from cap-dependent to cap-independent initiation is mediated by the proteolytic cleavage of eIF4G (19Etchison D. Milburn S.C. Edery I. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14806-14810Google Scholar, 20Etchison D. Fout S. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 634-638Google Scholar, 21Lloyd R.E. Grubman M.J. Ehrenfeld E. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4216-4223Google Scholar). eIF4G functions as a linking protein which joins, by virtue of its binding sites for eIF4E, eIF3, eIF4A, and poly(A)-binding protein, the various factors involved in mRNA recruitment to the 40 S ribosomal subunit (22Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21975-21983Google Scholar, 23Mader S. Lee H. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4990-4997Google Scholar, 24Tarun S.Z.

Sommergruber W. Sobrino F. Hohenadl C. Blaas D. Rhoads R.E. Skern T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5677-5684Google Scholar) releases the N-terminal portion of eIF4G, bound to the cap-binding protein eIF4E, from the initiation complex but leaves the C-terminal portion of eIF4G bound to eIF3 and eIF4A in the initiation complex (22Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21975-21983Google Scholar). Such modified initiation complexes can apparently participate in internal initiation but not cap-dependent initiation, although the mechanism is not clear (18Pestova T.V. Shatsky I.N. Hellen C.U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6870-6878Google Scholar, 28Ohlmann T. Rau M. Pain V.M. Morley S.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1371-1382Google Scholar, 29Borman A.M. Kirchweger R. Ziegler E. Rhoads R.E. Skern T. Kean K.M. RNA. 1997; 3: 186-196Google Scholar). In comparison with picornaviral IRESs, relatively little is known about cellular (non-viral) IRESs. The 5′-UTRs of BiP (7Macejak D.G. Sarnow P. Nature. 1991; 353: 90-94Google Scholar),Ultrabithorax (12Ye X. Fong P. Iizuka N. Choate D. Cavener D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1714-1721Google Scholar), and Antennapedia (8Oh S.-K. Scott M.P. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1643-1653Google Scholar) mRNAs are, respectively, 220, 968, and 252 nt, but the locations and sizes of the IRESs within them are not known. In the case of the 318-nt 5′-UTR of fibroblast growth factor 2 mRNA, the IRES resides in a 165-nt segment (9Vagner S. Gensac M.C. Maret A. Bayard F. Amalric F. Prats H. Prats A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 35-44Google Scholar). In the 1022-nt 5′-UTR of platelet-derived growth factor 2 mRNA, the IRES is present in a 395-nt segment (11Bernstein J. Sella O. Le S.-Y. Elroy-Stein O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9356-9362Google Scholar). None of these cellular mRNAs contains a picornavirus-like PPT nor is there significant homology among them or with picornaviral IRESs. The 5′-UTR of human eIF4G mRNA (30Yan R. Rychlik W. Etchison D. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23226-23231Google Scholar) is unusually long (368 nt), compared with typical 5′-UTRs of cellular mRNAs (31Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Google Scholar), and contains four upstream open reading frames, suggesting that its translation would be extremely inefficient if the scanning mechanism were used. Previously we demonstrated, using reporter constructs transfected into K562 cells, that the first 357 nt of the 5′-UTR of eIF4G mRNA has IRES activity (10Gan W. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 623-626Google Scholar). In the present study we have further characterized the IRES of eIF4G with respect to size, sequence requirements, and mechanism of initiation codon selection. Knowledge of this mechanism may shed light on how internal initiation occurs in other RNAs, both viral and cellular. Because of the unique role of eIF4G in protein synthesis initiation, this may also give insight into such questions as the mechanism by which intracellular levels of eIF4G are maintained and the balance between cap-dependent and cap-independent initiation. Luciferin, restriction endonucleases, the DNA Cycle Sequencing System (fmol ®), enzymes used for in vitro transcription, and S1 nuclease were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). RNase T1 was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). RNase V1 was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. (Piscataway, NJ). Acetyl-coenzyme A was obtained from Sigma. Radioisotopes were purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Silica gel thin layer chromatography plates (LK5F, 150 Å) were obtained from Whatman (Clifton, NJ). Pfu polymerase was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Deletions in the DNA corresponding to nt 1–357 of human eIF4G mRNA (30Yan R. Rychlik W. Etchison D. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23226-23231Google Scholar) were made from both 5′- and 3′-ends by PCR using Pfu polymerase. The PCR products used to make the first three 5′-deletions contained HindIII sites at the 3′ but not 5′ termini. It was therefore necessary to incorporate a 5′-HindIII site by cloning into pBluescript KS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at the EcoRV site, which is adjacent to aHindIII site, and then screening for an insert with the same orientation as the T3 promoter. The fragments were excised withHindIII and inserted into pGL2/CAT/LUC (10Gan W. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 623-626Google Scholar) at the uniqueHindIII site between coding regions for CAT and luciferase. (Henceforth, plasmids names are abbreviated, e.g.pGL2/CAT/LUC is abbreviated C/L, pGL2/CAT/4G/LUC is abbreviated C/4G/L, etc.) PCR products for the rest of the plasmids shown in Fig. 1 A and the 3′-deletion plasmids shown in Fig. 2 Acontained HindIII sites at each end. These were digested with HindIII and inserted into the HindIII site of C/L. The plasmid C/4G+/L contained DNA corresponding to the full-length 5′-UTR and the first three codons of eIF4G mRNA (nt 1–377), fused upstream and in-frame with the luciferase gene. This plasmid was made by a three-step PCR strategy. In the first step, pHFC5 (30Yan R. Rychlik W. Etchison D. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23226-23231Google Scholar) was used as template. The product contained sequences corresponding to nt 1–377 of eIF4G mRNA followed by nt 1–17 of the luciferase coding region. In the second step, pGL2/LUC (10Gan W. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 623-626Google Scholar) was used as template. The product contained sequences corresponding to nt 358–377 of eIF4G mRNA followed by nt 1–55 of the luciferase coding region. In the third step, gel-purified PCR products from the first two steps were mixed and used as templates for PCR. The product, which had a HindIII site at its 5′-end and a NarI site at its 3′-end, was digested with both enzymes and inserted into C/L at the same sites. Plasmids containing mutations in the 3′-region of the 5′-UTR (Figs. 3 A, 4 A, 5 A, and6 A) were made by the same strategy but with C/4G+/L as template. Plasmid C/4G+BΔ322–363/LA (Fig. 6 A) was made by PCR with C/4G+B/LA as template. The resulting product, which had a 5′HindIII site and 3′ BclI site, was digested with the same enzymes and inserted into C/4G+B/LA at the same sites. The plasmid used for in vitro transcription, pKS4GΔMCS, was made in the following way. The PCR product corresponding to nt 1–357 of human eIF4G mRNA (10Gan W. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 623-626Google Scholar) was inserted into pKS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at the HindIII site. The polylinker upstream of the insert was removed by digesting with XbaI and SacI and re-ligating the plasmid. The structures of plasmids were confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing (32Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 623-626Google Scholar). Electroporation was performed in triplicate for each plasmid and utilized 30 μg of DNA unless otherwise specified. Luciferase activity was measured (33Braster A.R. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1122Google Scholar) using a Monolight 2010 Luminometer from Analytical Luminescence Laboratory (San Diego, CA). CAT activity (10Gan W. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 623-626Google Scholar) was used as an internal control to normalize luciferase activity in each sample. Corrected luciferase activity values were averaged and standard deviations determined. Total RNA was isolated from transfected K562 cells (34Chomcynski P. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, Inc. and John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1991: 4.2.4-4.2.8Google Scholar) and poly(A)-containing mRNA was purified (35Kingston R.E. Sheen J. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, Inc. and John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1994: 9.6.2-9.6.9Google Scholar). Poly(A)-containing mRNA from each sample (∼1 μg) was used for electrophoresis and Northern blot analysis (36Selden R.F. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates, Inc. and John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1994: 4.9.1-4.9.7Google Scholar). The hybridization probe was synthesized as described previously (10Gan W. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 623-626Google Scholar) and consisted of RNA complementary to nt 47–547 of luciferase mRNA (where the initiating AUG is nt 1). A 5′-end labeled form of the eIF4G 5′-UTR (nt 1–357) was produced by in vitro transcription of HindIII-linearized pKS4GΔMCS in the presence of 10 μCi/μl [γ-32P]GTP (37Titus D.E. Second Ed. Promega Protocols and Applications Guide. Promega Corp., Madison, WI1991Google Scholar). The nucleotide concentrations used in 100-μl reactions were 0.5 mm for ATP, CTP, and UTP but 0.25 mm for GTP. The 32P-end labeled RNA was subjected to partial digestion with S1 and V1 nuclease as described previously (38Zhang Y. Dolph P.J. Schneider R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10679-10684Google Scholar, 39Evstafieva A.G. Ugarova T.Y. Chernov B.K. Shatsky I.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 665-671Google Scholar). RNA markers were synthesized by limited alkaline hydrolysis and RNase T1 nuclease digestion of the labeled RNA. The initial characterization of IRES activity in eIF4G mRNA employed a portion of the 5′-UTR representing 357 nt of the total 368 nt (10Gan W. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 623-626Google Scholar). However, it was not clear how much of this sequence was required for IRES activity. We therefore prepared a series of plasmids expressing forms of the 5′-UTR that were deleted from either 5′- or 3′-ends. To serve as a guide in choosing segments to be deleted, we examined the distribution of single- and double-stranded regions in the 5′-UTR. Subjecting the 357-nt sequence to a folding algorithm (M-fold, GCG Sequence Analysis Package) produced a series of structures, all having free energies of folding between −105 and −110 kcal/mol. Many of the predicted stems and loops were common among the structures. To test the validity of these various structures, a 5′-end labeled transcript representing nt 1–357 was subjected to partial enzymatic digestion with single- and double-strand-specific nucleases (S1 and V1; see “Experimental Procedures”). In the theoretical structure exhibiting the best agreement with experimental results, 75% of the digestion sites were in the predicted single- and double-stranded regions (data not shown). These results indicate that additional experimental information will be required to arrive at a precise secondary and tertiary structure of the 5′-UTR. Nonetheless, the regions of double- and single-stranded structure were used as a guide for making deletions in the 5′-UTR. Each successive 5′-deletion (Fig. 1 A) corresponded to the removal of an additional region of double-stranded RNA (based on nuclease sensitivity). The truncated DNA segments were inserted between CAT and luciferase coding regions to permit the use of CAT activity as an internal control for mRNA levels (Fig. 1 A). Surprisingly, deletion of the first 57 nt enhanced IRES activity by 80% rather than diminishing it (Fig. 1 B, C/4GΔ1–57/L versus C/4G/L). IRES activity decreased progressively from this value with further deletions, except for C/4GΔ1–256/L, which expressed the same level of luciferase activity as the wild type IRES. There were no consistent differences between IRESs containing upstream AUGs (Fig. 1 A, asterisks) and those that did not, in keeping with the earlier observation that mutation of these AUGs to AAGs had no effect on IRES activity (10Gan W. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 623-626Google Scholar). An RNA with three-fourths of the 5′-UTR deleted was considerably reduced in IRES activity (C/4GΔ1–276/Lversus C/4G/L) but was still 55-fold higher than the bicistronic mRNA containing no IRES (C/4GΔ1–276/Lversus C/L). Northern blot analysis showed that these bicistronic mRNAs were intact (data not shown), indicating that the reduction in activity was not due to RNA cleavage. Previous studies also showed that monocistronic RNAs containing the luciferase coding region downstream of the eIF4G IRES, or variants of it, were intact (10Gan W. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 623-626Google Scholar). It was possible that some of the changes in luciferase activities observed in Fig. 1 B were underestimated because the amount of expression of bicistronic mRNA exceeded the cell's capacity to translate it, i.e. the assay was not in the linear range. To test this, different amounts of plasmid DNA were used for transfection of K562 cells (Fig. 1 C). Luciferase activity increased in response to the amount of transfected DNA for the parent (wt) plasmid (C/4G/L), for a mutant exhibiting higher activity than the parent (C/4GΔ1–57/L), for a mutant exhibiting the same activity as the parent (C/4GΔ1–256/L), and for a mutant exhibiting lower activity (C/4GΔ1–230/L). These results indicate that the changes in activity observed in Fig. 1 B are not distorted due to saturation of some limiting component necessary for expression. The 3′-boundary of the IRES was similarly defined by deletion analysis (Fig. 2 A). Removal of 58 nt from the 3′-end completely abolished IRES activity (Fig. 2 B, C/4GΔ300–357/L versus C/4G/L). However, an RNA with only 38 nt deleted, transcribed from plasmid C/4GΔ322–357/L, restored wild-type levels of luciferase. This indicates that the sequence between nt 300 and 321 is critical for IRES activity. More than half of this sequence consists of a 12-nt PPT. The experiments described in Figs. 1 and 2 utilized vectors which produced an RNA containing nt 1–357 of the 5′-UTR, but the complete 5′-UTR is 368 nt (30Yan R. Rychlik W. Etchison D. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23226-23231Google Scholar). It was conceivable that the 11 nt from 358 to 368 played a role in IRES activity. In hepatitis C virus, for instance, the first 10 codons are required for internal initiation and hence are considered part of the IRES (40Reynolds J.E. Kaminski A. Kettinen H.J. Grace K. Clarke B.E. Carroll A.R. Rowlands D.J. Jackson R.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6010-6020Google Scholar). To study the IRES activity of the complete 5′-UTR plus the initial coding region, we fused DNA corresponding to the full-length eIF4G 5′-UTR and the first three codons of eIF4G (nt 1–377) upstream of, and in-frame with, the initiating ATG of luciferase (Fig. 3 A, C/4G+/L). This construct generated the same level of luciferase expression as C/4G/L (nt 1–357) within experimental error (data not shown), indicating that the sequence responsible for IRES activity does not extend beyond nt 357. Variations of this extended construct (4G+) were used for subsequent studies. Since deletion of the region containing the PPT abolished IRES activity (Fig. 2), it was of interest to determine whether a PPT per se was needed or merely a spacer between the IRES and the initiation codon. We therefore substituted a polypurine stretch consisting of six A and six G residues for the 12-nt PPT (Fig. 3 A, C/4G+Pu/L). This polypurine tract completely abolished IRES activity (Fig. 3 B, C/4G+Pu/Lversus C/4G+/L), indicating the need for a PPT. To determine whether a specific sequence in the PPT was required, we inverted the PPT sequence (Fig. 3 A, C/4G+yP/L). This reduced IRES activity by 50%, but the modified 5′-UTR was still 50-fold more effective in directing luciferase expression than the negative control (Fig. 3 B, C/4G+yP/L versus C/L). The plasmid expressing this inverted PPT contains a central sequence of CTTTC that is the same as in the original plasmid (Fig. 3 A). To rule out the possibility that this precise sequence was important, we made a different construct in which the original six T residues and six C residues were rearranged into a TC repeat sequence (Fig. 3 A, C/4G+TC/L). Expression from C/4G+TC/L was further decreased but still 30-fold higher than expression from C/L (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that a PPT is needed, but that the wild-type sequence is not critical for IRES activity. The extended construct C/4G+/L (Fig. 3 A) expresses an RNA containing two in-frame AUG codons immediately upstream of the luciferase coding region, either one of which could, in principle, initiate translation of luciferase. The first of these, at nt 369 of the eIF4G mRNA (30Yan R. Rychlik W. Etchison D. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23226-23231Google Scholar), is presumed to be the in vivoinitiation codon for eIF4G, although this has not heretofore been proven. This supposition is based on its location at the beginning of a 4191-nt open readin"
https://openalex.org/W2052355511,"Leukotriene D4(LTD4) is a major lipid mediator involved in inflammatory and allergic disorders including bronchial asthma. Despite its potent biological activity, little is known about the receptor and intracellular signaling pathways. Here we analyzed the signal transduction mechanisms through LTD4 receptors using human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells. When these cells were stimulated with LTD4, intracellular calcium concentration was increased and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) was activated severalfold. This activation was inhibited by staurosporine or GF109203X treatment or abolished by protein kinase C depletion. Cytosolic protein kinase Cα was translocated to the membrane, and Raf-1 was activated by LTD4 treatment in a similar time course. LTD4-induced Raf-1 activation was diminished by protein kinase C depletion in the cells. A chemotactic response of THP-1 cells toward LTD4 was observed which was inhibited by pertussis toxin (PTX) pretreatment. Thus, LTD4 has at least two distinct signaling pathways in THP-1 cells, a PTX-insensitive mitogen-activated protein kinase activation through protein kinase Cα and Raf-1 and a PTX-sensitive chemotactic response. This cellular signaling can explain in part the versatile activities of LTD4 in macrophages under inflammatory and allergic conditions.

Although the cell-surface LTD4 receptor is presumed to be a seven-transmembrane receptor coupling to a heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein(s) (G protein(s)) (4Watanabe T. Shimizu T. Miki I.

We report here that in human monocytic THP-1 cells, LTD4 increased the intracellular calcium concentration and activated MAP kinase through a PTX-insensitive G protein, PKCα and Raf-1 pathway. Furthermore, THP-1 cells showed a chemotaxis toward LTD4 through a PTX-sensitive G protein. Thus, LTD4 receptors have at least two signal transduction pathways in THP-1 cells, the PTX-insensitive MAP kinase cascade and the PTX-sensitive pathway leading to chemotaxis. LTD4 was obtained from Cascade Biochem (Reading, UK). A human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1 cells, obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), was kept in RPMI 1640 medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co, Tokyo) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Moregate, Melbourne, Australia) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Serum-starved cells were obtained by incubation for 24 h in the medium without fetal bovine serum. TPA was purchased from Sigma.

A Diff-Quick staining kit was from International Reagents Corp. (Kobe, Japan). MK-571 was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Protein determination reagents (BCA kit) were from Pierce. Other chemicals and reagents were of analytical grade. ONO-1078 was a kind gift from Ono Pharmaceutical Co (Osaka, Japan). A His-tagged MAP kinase kinase and a GST fusion kinase-negative (GST-kn) MAP kinase were generous gifts from Drs. Y. Gotoh and E. Nishida (Kyoto University). THP-1 cells suspended in Hepes-Tyrode's-BSA buffer (Hepes-Tyrode's-BSA buffer contains the following: 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 0.49 mm MgCl2, 12 mm NaHCO3, 5.6 mm d-glucose, 0.37 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), containing 0.1% (w/v) of fatty acid-free BSA) were loaded with 3 μm Fura-2/AM at 37 °C for 1 h, washed twice, and resuspended in Hepes-Tyrode's-BSA buffer to a concentration of 1.0 × 107 cells/ml. After 5 min of stirring at 37 °C, ligands were added, and elevations in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were measured using a spectrofluorometer (model CAF-100, JASCO, Tokyo), with emission wavelength set at 510 nm and excitation wavelengths at 340 and 380 nm. Cells were seeded on 24-well dishes 24 h prior to start of experiments. After aspirating off the medium, the cells were incubated for 20 min in Hepes-Tyrode's-BSA buffer containing 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine at 37 °C. Next, the cells were exposed for 20 min to 50 μm forskolin in the presence of ligands. The supernatant was aspirated after centrifugation, and the reaction was terminated by adding 200 μl of 30% perchloric acid. After a 20-min incubation, the supernatant was collected by centrifugation. The concentrations of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in the supernatant were determined using a radioimmunoassay kit from Yamasa (Chiba, Japan). Aliquots (3.0 × 106cells in 1 ml of Hepes-Tyrode's-BSA buffer) of serum-starved cells were stimulated with ligands at 37 °C. The supernatant was aspirated after centrifugation, and the reaction was terminated by adding an ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 10 μg/ml aprotinin (final concentration) in a total volume of 200 μl. Aliquots were then assayed for the MAP kinase as described previously (6Waga I. Kume K. Ferby I. Honda Z. Shimizu T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 190: 71-77Google Scholar). When examining the effects of PTX, cells were incubated overnight with 100 ng/ml PTX. Aliquots (3.0 × 106 cells in 1 ml of Hepes-Tyrode's-BSA buffer) of serum-starved cells were stimulated with ligands at 37 °C. The supernatant was aspirated after centrifugation, and the reaction was terminated by adding an ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). After sonication at 30 watts for 30 s and removal of the nuclei and unbroken cells by centrifugation (1,000 × g for 15 min), the supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 60 min to obtain the cytosol (supernatant) and the membrane (pellet) fractions. The pellet was extracted with the lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and sonicated. After leaving on ice for 30 min, the membrane extract was obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min. Proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto Hybond-N+ membranes. After blocking the membrane with 10% BSA, immunoblot analysis was performed with an anti-PKC antibody. Blots were visualized with ECL detection reagents. A His-tagged MAP kinase kinase and a GST-kn MAP kinase were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by column chromatography as described (7Gotoh Y. Matsuda S. Takenaka K. Hattori S. Iwamatsu A. Ishikawa M. Kosako H. Nishida E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1891-1898Google Scholar). Aliquots (3.0 × 106 cells in 1 ml of Hepes-Tyrode's-BSA buffer) of serum-starved cells were stimulated with ligands at 37 °C. The supernatant was aspirated after centrifugation, and the reaction was terminated by adding an ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS. The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatants were precleared with 70 μl of 1:1 slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads. They were then incubated for 2 h with 20 μl of an anti-Raf-1 antibody and 70 μl of 1:1 slurry of protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C. The immune complex on the beads was washed three times with the lysis buffer, twice with a solution containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.5 m LiCl, and once with a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm EGTA, and 10 mm MgCl2. This preparation was referred to as the immunoprecipitate. To assay Raf-1 kinase toward an exogenous substrate, the His-tagged MAP kinase kinase (1.5 μg) and the GST-kn MAP kinase (2.5 μg) were incubated with the immunoprecipitate at 30 °C in a 24-μl solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP (370 kBq). The reaction was stopped by adding Laemmli's sample buffer and boiling. After SDS-PAGE separation, the radioactivity incorporated in the His-tagged MAP kinase kinase or the GST-kn MAP kinase was detected and quantified using an image analyzer (Fujix BAS 2000). Polycarbonate filters with 8-μm pores were coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin in phosphate-buffered saline for 60 min. A dry coated filter was placed on a 96-blind well chamber containing the indicated amounts of LTD4, and the THP-1 cells (200 μl, 1.0 × 106 cells) were added to the top wells. The ligand solution and cell suspension were prepared in the same buffer (RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% BSA). After incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 4 h, the filter was disassembled. Cells on the filter were fixed with methanol and stained with a Diff-Quick staining kit. The upper side of the filter was then scraped free of cells. The number of cells that had migrated to the lower side was determined by measuring optical densities at 595 nm using a 96-well microplate reader (Bio-Rad model 3550) (8Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Google Scholar). The membrane fractions of THP-1 cells were examined in a binding assay as described (4Watanabe T. Shimizu T. Miki I. Sakanaka C. Honda Z. Seyama Y. Teramoto T. Matsushima T. Ui M. Kurokawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21237-21241Google Scholar, 9Rochette C. Nicholson D.W. Metters K.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1177: 283-290Google Scholar). [3H]LTD4-specific binding to THP-1 cell membranes was estimated, and the value for the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was 1.8 nm and for the maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) was 31 fmol/mg protein. LTD4 induced a rapid increase of intracellular calcium concentration in THP-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 A). ONO-1078, a specific LTD4 receptor antagonist (10Nakagawa N. Obata T. Kobayashi T. Okada Y. Nambu F. Terawaki T. Aishita H. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 60: 217-225Google Scholar, 11Obata T. Okada Y. Motoishi M. Nakagawa N. Terawaki T. Aishita H. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 60: 227-237Google Scholar), inhibited the response (Fig. 1 A). 100 nm LTD4induced an increase in intracellular calcium concentration about 250 nm above basal levels (Fig. 1 B). Pretreatment of the cells with PTX reduced the LTD4-elicited calcium response by 30% and the ATP-elicited response by 20%, whereas it did not inhibit the thrombin-elicited calcium response (data not shown). Next, we determined the effects of LTD4 on cAMP accumulation. LTD4 dose-dependently inhibited the forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation with an IC50 value of 100 nm and did not increase cAMP level in the absence of forskolin (data not shown). This inhibitory effect of LTD4was completely blocked by PTX or by ONO-1078 pretreatment (data not shown), indicating that the LTD4 receptor couples to PTX-sensitive G protein(s). These data show that LTD4receptors are functionally active in THP-1 cells and couple to both PTX-sensitive and -insensitive G proteins. We then investigated LTD4-induced signal transduction mechanisms in THP-1 cells. After stimulation with 100 nmLTD4, the bands of MAP kinase (Erk2) were time-dependently gel-shifted in the immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2 A). This gel shift became most evident 5 min after LTD4 stimulation. MAP kinase assay with an epidermal growth factor receptor peptide as a substrate showed a severalfold activation with 100 nmLTD4 (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2 B, the EC50 value of MAP kinase activation was about 0.1 nm, and the activation was saturable at a higher dose (higher than 1 nm). When cells were pretreated with MK-571 or ONO-1078, both specific antagonists for the LTD4receptor (Cys-LTR1, see Ref. 12Alexander S.P.H. Peters J.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 50-51Google Scholar), LTD4 did not elicit the MAP kinase activation (Fig. 2 B). These data suggest that the LTD4-elicited MAP kinase activation is Cys-LTR1-mediated. Next, effects of various inhibitors on LTD4-elicited MAP kinase activation were examined. When the cells were pretreated overnight with PTX, the LTD4-elicited MAP kinase activation was slightly inhibited (Fig. 3). Treatment of the cells with BAPTA/AM (intracellular calcium chelator) inhibited the enzyme activity by half (Fig. 3). Pretreatment with a nanomolar order of wortmannin (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor) (13Ui M. Okada T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 303-307Google Scholar, 14Ferby I. Waga I. Sakanaka C. Kume K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30485-30488Google Scholar, 15Ferby I. Waga I. Hoshino M. Kume K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11684-11688Google Scholar) or with several nonreceptor type tyrosine kinase inhibitors (i.e. tyrphostin, methyl 2,5-dihydroxycinnamate, and genistein) did not inhibit the LTD4-elicited MAP kinase activation (data not shown). 10 μm or 30 μmGF109203X or 300 nm staurosporine, both inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC), inhibited LTD4-elicited MAP kinase activation (Fig. 3). We thus considered that PKC might be involved in LTD4-elicited MAP kinase activation. To confirm this notion, cells were pretreated overnight with TPA to deplete endogenous PKCs. MAP kinase activation by LTD4 was completely blocked by this treatment (Fig. 3). Thus, in THP-1 cells, LTD4receptors mediate MAP kinase activation via a signaling pathway that may depend on the activity of PKCs. We then examined which PKC isozyme is involved in the signaling pathway. PKCα and PKCδ were detected in THP-1 cells by immunoblot analysis. In the resting state, almost all PKCα and PKCδ were present in the cytosol, but 100 nm LTD4caused a translocation of PKCα and PKCδ from the cytosol to the membrane in 10 min (Fig. 4, A and B). As a positive control, TPA also caused a translocation of PKCα and PKCδ from the cytosol to the membrane. This translocation of PKCα was inhibited by pretreatment with BAPTA/AM but that of PKCδ was not affected by the same pretreatment (data not shown). Finally, we examined the role of Raf-1 in LTD4-elicited MAP kinase activation. After stimulation with LTD4, THP-1 cells were treated with the ice-cold lysis buffer, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Raf-1 antibody. The Raf-1 immunoprecipitate activated the His-tagged MAP kinase kinase and the GST-kn MAP kinase by about 2-fold in several minutes (Fig. 5 A). When cells were pretreated overnight with TPA to deplete endogenous PKCα, the Raf-1 immunoprecipitate failed to activate the exogenous substrates (Fig. 5 B). These data strongly suggest that activation of Raf-1 by PKCα plays a dominant role in LTD4-elicited MAP kinase activation. It has been reported that LTD4 induces a chemotaxis of eosinophils (16Chan C.C. McKee K. Tagari P. Chee P. Ford-Hutchinson A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 191: 273-280Google Scholar, 17Spada C.S. Nieves A.L. Krauss A.H.-P. Woodward D.F. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 183-191Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether LTD4 would induce a chemotaxis of THP-1 cells. As shown in Fig. 6, LTD4 did induce chemotaxis in THP-1 cells with the maximal response at 30 nm. After the cells were pretreated overnight with PTX, the LTD4-induced chemotaxis completely disappeared (Fig. 6). These data indicate that LTD4-stimulated chemotaxis occurs through a PTX-sensitive mechanism. LTD4 is produced from arachidonic acid, triggered by the activation of 5-lipoxygenase. LTD4 together with other cysteinyl LTs constitute a slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis, a major mediator in bronchial asthma and various allergic disorders (1Samuelson B. Science. 1983; 220: 568-575Google Scholar, 2Smith W.L. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 315-324Google Scholar, 3Shimizu T. Wolfe L.S. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 1-15Google Scholar). We and others (4Watanabe T. Shimizu T. Miki I. Sakanaka C. Honda Z. Seyama Y. Teramoto T. Matsushima T. Ui M. Kurokawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21237-21241Google Scholar, 5Metters K.M. Zamboni R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6487-6495Google Scholar) previously provided indirect evidence that the LTD4 receptor couples to heterotrimeric G protein(s) in the cells and mobilizes intracellular calcium (18Chan C.C. Ecclestone P. Nicholson D.W. Metters K.M. Pon D.J. Rodger I.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 269: 891-896Google Scholar). However, the biochemical properties of the LTD4 receptor are unknown, and intracellular signaling mechanisms through the LTD4receptor are not well understood. This is mostly because only scanty numbers of LTD4 receptors are expressed in the cells, and suitable cell lines that respond strongly to LTD4stimulation have not been readily available. We studied various macrophage and monocytic cell lines (RAW264.7, P388D1, J774A.1, PU5–1.8, THP-1 cells, etc.) by examining the LTD4-induced calcium response and MAP kinase activation. Among them, a human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1 cells, showed most obvious responses toward LTD4. THP-1 cells exhibited a specific binding to LTD4, an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, and activation of MAP kinase. By comparing the potency of LTD4 and (5S,6R,7E,9E,11Z,14Z)-5-hydroxy-6-(S-glutathionyl)-icosatetraen-1-oic acid (LTC4) (data not shown), the receptor expressed on the THP-1 cell membranes can be classified as Cys-LTR1 (12Alexander S.P.H. Peters J.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 50-51Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this is the first detailed description of MAP kinase activation by LTD4. Since MAP kinase is a key enzyme that transmits signals from the cell surface to the nucleus (19Nishida E. Gotoh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 128-131Google Scholar) and activates several molecules including a cytosolic phospholipase A2 (20Lin L.L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Google Scholar), we further studied the mechanisms of how LTD4 caused an activation of MAP kinase. The MAP kinase is activated by a variety of extracellular stimuli, including those mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases and by G protein-coupled receptors (21Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J.

A. 1995; 92: 9284-9287Google Scholar), depending on the cell types or ligands. Some experiments were performed using receptor overexpression systems, and this may differ from the native cells possessing endogenous receptors. In this study we provided evidence that LTD4 receptors couple to the PTX-insensitive G protein (Gq or G11) and cause a transient intracellular calcium mobilization, which in turn activates PKCα and Raf-1, a well-known MAP kinase kinase kinase. The involvement of Gq, PKCα, and Raf-1 in this sequence was demonstrated by the following observations. 1) The activations of MAP kinase and PKCα were scarcely inhibited by PTX treatment (Fig. 3, data not shown), although inhibition of adenylate cyclase was completely restored by the same treatment (data not shown). 2) LTD4 induced a translocation of PKCα from the cytosol to the membrane and activation of Raf-1 (Figs. 4 A and 5 A). 3) The LTD4-elicited MAP kinase activation was inhibited by staurosporine or GF109203X but not by wortmannin or tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Fig. 3, data not shown). 4) The activation of Raf-1 and MAP kinase was inhibited by PKC depletion in the cells (Fig. 3 and Fig. 5 B). Moreover, calcium-independent PKCδ was also translocated by LTD4 in a similar time course (Fig. 4 B), and this may be also the consequence of an elevation in diacylglycerol levels through a Gq-phospholipase Cβ pathway. To date, the role of MAP kinase in macrophages/monocytic cells remains elusive. The activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 may yield a production of various eicosanoids (i.e.prostaglandins or leukotrienes) or platelet-activating factor, which either amplify or regulate inflammatory reactions (30Krump E. Pouliot M. Naccache P.H. Borgeat P. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 681-688Google Scholar, 31Xing M. Firestein B.L. Shen G.H. Insel P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 805-814Google Scholar). Furthermore, MAP kinase activation may induce various genes that relate to tumoricidal or bactericidal activity of macrophages. Another finding in this study relates to the chemotactic activity of LTD4 in THP-1 cells. LTD4 has been considered to function as a potent chemoattractant for human eosinophils (16Chan C.C. McKee K. Tagari P. Chee P. Ford-Hutchinson A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 191: 273-280Google Scholar, 17Spada C.S. Nieves A.L. Krauss A.H.-P. Woodward D.F. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 183-191Google Scholar). Considering that chemotactic responses by other ligands, such as interleukin-8 (32Knall C. Young S. Nick J.A. Buhl A.M. Worthen G.S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2832-2838Google Scholar, 33Kuang Y. Wu Y. Jiang H. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3975-3978Google Scholar), C5a (34Hartmann K. Henz B.M. Kruger-Krasagakes S. Kohl J. Burger R.

Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Google Scholar), are also inhibited by PTX-pretreatment, the common molecule(s) probably locates downstream of Gi-like protein(s). In conclusion, THP-1 cells have functional LTD4 receptors (Cys-LTR1) that couple to both Gq-like and Gi-like proteins. LTD4 activates MAP kinase mostly through a Gq, PKCα, and Raf-1 pathway, whereas the chemotactic response is mediated through Gi-like protein. THP-1 cells proved to be an appropriate cell line for elucidation of LTD4-induced cellular signaling as well as for purification of the Cys-LTR1 molecules. We are grateful to Drs. Y. Gotoh and E.

We analyzed the signaling pathway involved in HLA class I-mediated apoptosis in comparison with Fas (APO-1, CD95)-dependent apoptosis. The mouse mAb90 or the rat YTH862 monoclonal antibodies which bind the human HLA class I α1 domain induced the production of ceramide which was blocked by addition of the phosphatidylcholine-dependent phospholipase C inhibitor, D609. Furthermore, HLA class I-mediated apoptosis involved at least two different caspases, an interleukin-1 converting enzyme-like protease and another protease inhibited by the CPP32-like protease inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO. Despite similarity between Fas and HLA class I signaling pathways, we failed to demonstrate any physical association between these two molecules. We also report that the pan-caspase inhibitory peptide zVAD-fmk, but not Ac-DEVD-CHO and Ac-YVAD-CHO, inhibited decrease of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and generation of ceramide induced by anti-HLA class I and anti-Fas monoclonal antibodies, whereas all three peptides efficiently inhibited apoptosis. Altogether these results suggest that signaling through Fas and HLA class I involve caspase(s), targeted by zVAD-fmk, which act upstream of ceramide generation and mitochondrial events, whereas interleukin-1 converting enzyme-like and CPP32-like proteases act downstream of the mitochondria.

Apoptosis is a process that occurs in physiological or pathological conditions, in many different cell types, which serves as a fundamental control during the development of multicellular organisms. In the immune system, apoptosis induced by surface receptors is a central mechanism for the homeostasis of T and B lymphocytes.With regard to human T cells, apoptosis can be triggered by several membrane receptors including three members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R) 1The abbreviations used are: TNF-R, tumor necrosis factor receptor; CsA, cyclosporin A; Δψm, mitochondrial transmembrane potential; Fas-L, Fas ligand; ICE, interleukin-1 converting enzyme; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBL, peripheral blood lymphocytes; PC-PLC, phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; PHA, phytohemagglutinin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate.1The abbreviations used are: TNF-R, tumor necrosis factor receptor; CsA, cyclosporin A; Δψm, mitochondrial transmembrane potential; Fas-L, Fas ligand; ICE, interleukin-1 converting enzyme; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBL, peripheral blood lymphocytes; PC-PLC, phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; PHA, phytohemagglutinin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate. family (1Smith C.A.

We recently described two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind to the α1 domain of HLA class I heavy chain and induce apoptosis of activated, but not resting, T and B lymphocytes (14Genestier L.

Waldmann H. Engelhard V.H. Banchereau J. Revillard J.P. Blood. 1997; 90: 3629-3639Google Scholar). Apoptosis induced by anti-HLA class I mAbs did not result from Fas/Fas-L interaction and distinct though partly overlapping populations of activated T cells were susceptible to Fas- and HLA class I-mediated apoptosis, respectively (15Genestier L. Paillot R. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Meffre G. Flacher M. Fèvre D. Le Bouteiller P. Waldmann H. Engelhard V.H. Banchereau J. Revillard J.P. Blood. 1997; 90: 3629-3639Google Scholar).Regarding apoptosis signaling, TNF-RI and Fas have been shown to trigger rapid sphingomyelin hydrolysis into ceramide. Mutations in the TNF-RI cytoplasmic domain that abolished acidic sphingomyelinase and NF-κB activation in response to TNFα, also prevented cell death (16Showronski E.W. Kolesnick R.N. Green D.R. Cell Death Differ. 1996; 3: 171-176Google Scholar). Furthermore, in a Fas-resistant tumor cell line which expresses a death domain-defective Fas splice isoform, Fas ligation does not activate acidic sphingomyelinase although neutral sphingomyelinase and ERK-2 activities are still intact (17Cifone M.G. Roncaioli P. De Maria R. Camarda G. Santoni A. Ruberti G. Testi R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5859-5868Google Scholar). In addition to TNFα and Fas-ligand (Fas-L), anti-IgM, ionizing radiation, heat shock, ultraviolet light, and oxidative stress (18Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M.

Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Google Scholar) have been shown to induce ceramide production by cells in which they initiate apoptosis, suggesting that ceramide might be a general mediator of apoptosis. Recent studies have provided compelling evidence that a cascade of Asp-directed cysteine proteases, renamed caspases (23Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G. Thornberry N.A. Wong W.W. Yuan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 171Google Scholar), plays a pivotal role in transduction of apoptotic signals. Particularly, interleukin-1 converting enzyme (ICE)-like proteases have been implicated in Fas- and TNFα-induced cell death (24Los M. Van de Craen M. Penning L.C. Schenk E. Westendorp M.

Caspases can be clustered into three groups according to their specificities and their biological functions: group I/ICE (caspase-1), TX/ICH2/ICErel-II (caspase-4), ICErel-III/TY (caspase-5), group II/Yama/CPP-32/apopain (caspase-3), Mch3/ICE-LAP3/CMH-1 (caspase-7), and 3/ICH-1/Nedd2 (caspase-2), and group III/Mch2 (caspase-6), MACH/FLICE/Mch5 (caspase-8) ICE-LAP-6/Mch6 (caspase-9), and Mch4 (caspase-10) (reviewed in Refs. 23Alnemri E.S.

Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Google Scholar). The specificity of the caspase family has been defined by cleavage sequences in their respective substrates, which permitted the generation of specific inhibitory peptides, such as Ac-DEVD-CHO, which inhibits CPP32-like protease activity but also other members of caspase family (31Henkart P.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 195-201Google Scholar), Ac-YVAD-CHO, a specific inhibitor of ICE-like protease activity (27Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Google Scholar), and Ac-zVAD-fmk, a pan-caspase inhibitor.The relationship between ceramide production and caspases activation in apoptosis signaling is still not well defined. Recently, a control of ceramide production by caspases has been proposed in REAPER- and TNFα-induced apoptosis models (32Pronk G.J. Ramer K. Amiri P. Williams L.T. Science. 1996; 271: 808-810Google Scholar, 33Dbaibo G.S. Perry D.K. Gamard C.J. Platt R. Poirier G.G. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 481-490Google Scholar), but remains to be demonstrated in other models of apoptosis.In the present study we investigated the HLA class I signaling pathway leading to apoptosis of activated T lymphocytes, and we examined the possible connection between ceramide and caspases in both Fas- and HLA class I-apoptosis pathways. Our results point toward activation of caspases upstream and downstream of ceramide production, leading to reduction of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψm) and subsequent propagation of the death signal.DISCUSSIONThis study was undertaken to define the molecular events involved in HLA class I-mediated apoptosis and examine the relationship between caspases and ceramides, two mediators implicated in different apoptosis pathways. We show here that cell death induced by HLA class I molecules involves activation of caspases and ceramide production, similarly to what is observed during Fas apoptosis, despite the fact that HLA class I-mediated apoptosis is independent of Fas/Fas-L interaction (15Genestier L. Paillot R. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Meffre G. Flacher M. Fèvre D. Le Bouteiller P. Waldmann H. Engelhard V.H. Banchereau J. Revillard J.P. Blood. 1997; 90: 3629-3639Google Scholar). Recently two other reports described induction of apoptosis by HLA class I molecules (11Woodle S.E. Smith D.M. Bluestone J.A. Kirkman III, W.M. Green D.R. Skowronski E.W. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2156-2164Google Scholar, 12Skov S. Bregenholt S. Claesson M.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3189-3196Google Scholar). Apoptosis induced by the anti-HLA class I α3 domain, 5H7, was not inhibited by zVAD-fmk and was triggered in cell lines derived from patients with Niemann-Pick disease that lack acidic sphingomyelinase activity, suggesting that neither ceramide nor caspases were involved in 5H7-mediated apoptosis (11Woodle S.E. Smith D.M. Bluestone J.A. Kirkman III, W.M. Green D.R. Skowronski E.W. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2156-2164Google Scholar). Furthermore, Skov et al. (12Skov S. Bregenholt S. Claesson M.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3189-3196Google Scholar) demonstrated that herbimycin A inhibits rabbit anti-β2m-induced apoptosis of Jurkat T cells, suggesting that TPK might be involved in this type of apoptosis. The difference with our results may be explained by the fact that our antibodies (mAb90 and YTH862) recognize the α1 domain of HLA class I molecules and do not need to be cross-linked to induce apoptotic cell death (15Genestier L. Paillot R. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Meffre G. Flacher M. Fèvre D. Le Bouteiller P. Waldmann H. Engelhard V.H. Banchereau J. Revillard J.P. Blood. 1997; 90: 3629-3639Google Scholar).Several reports have demonstrated that activation induced by cross-linking of HLA class I molecules depends on an association between these molecules and other cell surface proteins such as interleukin-2R or CD3/TCR (45Tsherning T. Cësson M.H. Scand. J. Immunol. 1994; 39: 117-121Google Scholar). We further observed that inhibition of cytoskeleton rearrangement by cytochalasin B or D, which may inhibit association of cell surface molecules, prevents HLA class I- but not Fas-mediated apoptosis. However, HLA class I-induced apoptosis seems to be independent of associated cell surface molecules. Indeed we showed that monovalent Fab′ fragments from mAb90 were nearly as efficient as intact IgG to induce apoptosis (15Genestier L. Paillot R. Bonnefoy-Berard N. Meffre G. Flacher M. Fèvre D. Le Bouteiller P. Waldmann H. Engelhard V.H. Banchereau J. Revillard J.P. Blood. 1997; 90: 3629-3639Google Scholar). Furthermore, using two different methods, energy transfer and immunoprecipitation, we failed to demonstrate any physical association between HLA class I and Fas molecules. This argues in favor of a death signal transduced by the HLA class I molecule itself which differ from Fas-mediated apoptosis at least by cytoskeleton rearrangement requirement. The cytoplasmic region of the α chain of the HLA class I molecule which comprises 33 amino acids does not bear the typical death domain found in the intracellular C terminus region of both Fas and TNF-RI. So we can speculate that HLA class I molecules will interact with specific intracellular proteins that can initiate cell killing, and then converge in a route common with Fas. HLA class I-specific associated proteins that are involved in proximal events which control HLA class I cell death signaling remain to be identified.The two anti-HLA class I mAbs which induce apoptosis, mAb90 and YTH862, increased ceramide levels as did the anti-Fas mAb (Fig. 2, Ref. 17Cifone M.G. Roncaioli P. De Maria R. Camarda G. Santoni A. Ruberti G. Testi R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5859-5868Google Scholar). Evidence for the requirement of a PC-PLC/acidic sphingomyelinase pathway in this process was suggested by using the xanthate D609 which inhibits ceramide production induced by Fas (17Cifone M.G. Roncaioli P. De Maria R. Camarda G. Santoni A. Ruberti G. Testi R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5859-5868Google Scholar) and anti-HLA class I mAbs. Indeed D609 specifically blocks the PC-PLC and subsequent activation of acidic sphingomyelinase but not neutral sphingomyelinase (46Shütze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Weigmann K. Krönke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Google Scholar, 47Müller-Decker K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 198-205Google Scholar). The complete inhibition of ceramide production in the presence of D609 suggests that anti-HLA class I mAbs activate only acidic sphingomyelinase and not neutral sphingomyelinase. The major role for ceramide in apoptosis signaling was recently demonstrated by genetic models. Santana et al. (48Santana P. Pena L.A. Haimowitz-Freidman A. Martin S. Green D. McLoughlin M. Cordon-Cardo C. Schuchman E.H. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1996; 86: 189-199Google Scholar) reported that lymphoblasts from Niemann-Pick patients, which bear an inherited deficiency of acidic sphingomyelinase activity, as well as cells from acidic sphingomyelinase knockout mice, failed to respond to ionizing radiations with ceramide generation and apoptosis. Finally our results extend the list of apoptotic stimuli which use ceramides for the propagation of their death signal since TNFα (18Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M.

Expression of crmA, a cowpox virus encoding a serpin that is a specific inhibitor of ICE-like proteases, suppressed TNFα-, Fas-, and granzyme B-induced apoptosis (28Tewari M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3255-3260Google Scholar, 29Miura M. Friedlander R.M. Yuan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8318-8322Google Scholar, 49Darmon A.J. Nicholson D.W. Bleackley R.C. Nature. 1995; 377: 446-448Google Scholar). By measuring the cleavage of a fluorogenic substrate specific for ICE-like proteases as well as PARP cleavage, and using synthetic inhibitors specific for ICE-like (Ac-YVAD-CHO) and CPP32-like (Ac-DEVD-CHO) proteases, we found that these two caspases subfamilies that are involved in Fas-mediated apoptosis, are also activated during HLA class I-induced apoptosis. More importantly our data demonstrate that the large spectrum caspases inhibitor, zVAD-fmk, inhibits ceramide production induced by both anti-HLA class I and anti-Fas mAbs, suggesting that zVAD-fmk targets (a) protease(s) acting upstream of ceramide generation. In agreement with this hypothesis zVAD-fmk has no effect on the decrease of mitochondrial transmembrane potential induced by addition of exogenous ceramide (Fig. 6). Control of ceramide production by caspases was already proposed in other models. The Drosophila melanogaster protein REAPER, which is critical for the Drosophila embryo, was found to induce generation of ceramide and apoptosis, both being blocked by the zVAD-fmk peptide (32Pronk G.J. Ramer K. Amiri P. Williams L.T. Science. 1996; 271: 808-810Google Scholar). More recently it was demonstrated that Ac-YVAD-CHO and CrmA, two potent inhibitors of ICE-like proteases, inhibited ceramide generation and prevented TNF-α-induced cell death in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells (33Dbaibo G.S. Perry D.K. Gamard C.J. Platt R. Poirier G.G. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 481-490Google Scholar). Despite the observation that, in Fas- and HLA class I-mediated apoptosis, a different pattern of inhibition is obtained with the tetrapeptide Ac-YVAD-CHO compared with TNF-α-mediated apoptosis, our results support the role of caspases in controlling ceramide generation in cell death signaling. Furthermore, the strong accumulation of ceramides observed when cells were pretreated with either Ac-DEVD-CHO or Ac-YVAD-CHO suggests that blockade of ICE-like or CPP32-like proteases inhibits or delays ceramide consumption. It was recently reported that CD95- and ceramide-induced apoptosis requires GD3 ganglioside, newly synthesized from ceramide (50De Maria R. Lent L. Malisan F. D'Agostino F. Tomassini B. Zeuner A. Rippo M.R. Testi R. Science. 1997; 277: 1652-1655Google Scholar). The authors documented that a DEVD- and/or YVAD-sensitive caspase controls GD3 accumulation. According to these data, a possible control of GD3 synthase by caspases can be proposed and certainly deserves further investigations.A possible candidate for the proximal caspase targeted by zVAD-fmk peptide, could be the recently identified FLICE protease (51Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Google Scholar, 52Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Google Scholar) proposed to be the most receptor-proximal caspase activated in Fas signaling (53Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C.

Immunol. 1997; 27: 1207-1212Google Scholar). The recruitment of FLICE in the death-inducing complex is mediated by the N terminus prodomain of the molecule, which interacts with the death effector domain of FADD. However, FLICE was also shown to be activated by granzyme B (51Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1996; 85: 817-827Google Scholar), indicating that FLICE can be recruited and activated by proteins which do not possess a death domain. Whether FLICE is also activated in HLA class I-mediated apoptosis remains to be demonstrated. Recent data from Medema et al., (53Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Google Scholar) on the B lymphobastoid cell line SKW6.4 showed that in an in vitro cleavage assay, where 35S-labeled FLICE is added to immunoprecipitates of the death-inducing signaling complex, autocatalytic cleavage of FLICE is blocked by the peptide inhibitors zVAD-fmk or DEVD-fmk but not by CrmA or Ac-YVAD-CHO. In the cell, however, inhibition of FLICE was only documented with zVAD-fmk. It is possible that DEVD-fmk (or Ac-DEVD-CHO) would not inhibit FLICE activity in vivo because of a higher affinity for other proteases such as CPP32. This would explain why we did not see any effect of the tetrapeptide Ac-DEVD-CHO on ceramide generation, despite its capacity to inhibit HLA class I and Fas-mediated apoptosis.According to our results, we propose a model (Fig. 7) where a first set of proteases targeted by the inhibitory peptide zVAD-fmk control generation of ceramide. Whether proteases directly affect PC-PLC or acidic sphingomyelinase activities remains to be investigated. One consequence of ceramide production would be a loss in mitochondrial membrane potential as suggested by the major decrease of ΔΨm in cells treated by exogenous ceramides (Fig. 6). We described above that anti-Fas and anti-HLA class I mAbs partially reduced ΔΨm. The decrease of ΔΨm is inhibited by zVAD-fmk but not by Ac-DEVD-CHO and Ac-YVAD-CHO, suggesting that DEVD- and YVAD-specific proteases act downstream of mitochondrial events. Cytochrome c was recently reported to be released from mitochondria in apoptotic cells, to activate DEVD-specific caspases and induce apoptotic effects in cell-free systems containing cytosol (55Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Google Scholar, 56Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T-I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Google Scholar). However, in these cell-free assays, release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria was not accompanied by changes in ΔΨm. In Jurkat cells undergoing apoptosis after Fas ligation, a loss of cytochrome c function was also reported (57Krippner A. Matsuno-Yagi A. Gottlieb R.A. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21629-21636Google Scholar). Interestingly this cytochome c inactivation was accompanied by a slow and partial decrease of ΔΨm and inhibited by zVAD-fmk peptide. Therefore the loss of cytochromec activity during Fas-mediated apoptosis is likely to involve a step dependent on a zVAD-specific protease. Altogether these results support a close relationship between caspases and ceramide in the signaling of apoptosis mediated by Fas and HLA class I molecules. Apoptosis is a process that occurs in physiological or pathological conditions, in many different cell types, which serves as a fundamental control during the development of multicellular organisms. In the immune system, apoptosis induced by surface receptors is a central mechanism for the homeostasis of T and B lymphocytes. With regard to human T cells, apoptosis can be triggered by several membrane receptors including three members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R) 1The abbreviations used are: TNF-R, tumor necrosis factor receptor; CsA, cyclosporin A; Δψm, mitochondrial transmembrane potential; Fas-L, Fas ligand; ICE, interleukin-1 converting enzyme; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBL, peripheral blood lymphocytes; PC-PLC, phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; PHA, phytohemagglutinin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate.1The abbreviations used are: TNF-R, tumor necrosis factor receptor; CsA, cyclosporin A; Δψm, mitochondrial transmembrane potential; Fas-L, Fas ligand; ICE, interleukin-1 converting enzyme; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBL, peripheral blood lymphocytes; PC-PLC, phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; PHA, phytohemagglutinin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate. family (1Smith C.A.

Thus, NCp7 was shown to promote annealing of the tRNA3Lys to the primer binding site, a key step in reverse transcription. However, previous in vitro experiments were unable to clarify the role of the zinc fingers in this process, due to nucleic acid aggregation induced by the basic N- and C-terminal domains of NCp7.

Reverse transcription is a key step in the retroviral life cycle, allowing conversion of the single-stranded RNA genome into double-stranded DNA (1Coffin J.M. Field B.N. Knippe D.M. Fields B.N. Knippe D.M. 2nd Ed. Retroviridae and Their Replication: Virology. 51. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1990: 1437-1500Google Scholar). The initiation of this process begins with the annealing of a primer tRNA to the viral RNA primer binding site (PBS). 1The abbreviations used are: PBS, primer binding site; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; NC, nucleocapsid. In HIV-1, the PBS sequence, located at the 5′ end of the genomic RNA (position 179–196) in the leader region and referred to as the ψ region (2Aldovini A. Young R.A. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1920-1926Google Scholar), has a strict complementarity with the 18 nucleotides of tRNA3Lys end (3Van Beveren C. Coffin J.M. Hughes S. Weiss N. Teich H. Varmus H. Coffin J.

Ehresmann C. Keith G. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 236-250Google Scholar) and shows that the interaction between the two RNAs is more extended than expected, involving a highly compact and complex structure. The annealing of the tRNA primer to the PBS is promoted by nucleocapsid (NC) proteins (5Prats A.C. Sarih L. Gabus C. Litvak S. Keith G. Darlix J.L.

In vitro, NCp7 was found to be necessary for the dimerization and the encapsidation of the ψ containing genomic RNA, the annealing of the tRNA primer to the PBS, and the initial strand transfer event (review in Ref. 10Darlix J.L. Lapadat-Tapolsky M. de Rocquigny H. Roques B.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 523-537Google Scholar). In the virions, viral RNAs and NCps are tightly associated to form the nucleocapsid (11Méric C. Darlix J.L. Sparh P.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 173: 531-538Google Scholar). In the case of HIV-1, the mature NC product, NCp7 (12Di Marzo Veronese F. Rahman R. Copeland T.D. Oroszland S. Gallo R.C. Sarngadharan M.G. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1987; 3: 253-264Google Scholar), is a small basic protein (72 amino acids) containing two copies of a conserved zinc finger-like domain with the sequence Cys-X2-Cys-X4-His-X4-Cys, designated as the CCHC motif (13Berg J.M. Science. 1986; 232: 485-487Google Scholar). NCp7 has been synthesized by a stepwise solid phase method (14de Rocquigny H. Ficheux D. Gabus C. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Darlix J.L. Roques B.P. Biochem.

NMR studies have shown that, whereas the N- and C-terminal parts of the protein are flexible, the finger domains are folded around the divalent ion (16Summers M.F. South T.L. Kim B. Hare D.R.

Moreover, the two zinc complexed domains are spatially close, a property that has been confirmed as being biologically important (17Morellet N. Jullian N. de Rocquigny H. Maigret B. Darlix J.L.

In apparent discrepancy with the results of mutation experiments, the basic regions of the NCp7, rather than the zinc fingers, were proposed to be involved in its promoting effect of annealing complementary nucleic acids “in vitro” (7De Rocquigny H. Gabus C. Vincent A. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.P. Darlix J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6472-6476Google Scholar, 22Lapadat-Taposky M. Pernelle C. Borie C. Darlix J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 21: 831-839Google Scholar). With the aim of investigating more precisely the role of the zinc finger domains in the hybridase activity of NCp7, we have developed a method allowing the free and complexed nucleic acids to be directly visualized by gel electrophoresis and eliminating the usual extraction of the protein by a phenol-chloroform treatment (6Darlix J.L. Gabus C. Nugeyre M.T. Clavel B. Barré-Sinoussi F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 689-699Google Scholar, 7De Rocquigny H. Gabus C. Vincent A. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.P. Darlix J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6472-6476Google Scholar). Using (12–53)NCp7 and various derivatives, our results show that the presence of both zinc fingers is necessary and sufficient to promote the annealing of the radiolabeled33P tRNA3Lys with the 77–257 domain of HIV-1 RNA, which contains the PBS sequence. The presence of the N- and C-terminal parts of NCp7 induced aggregation, precluding visualization of the hybrid complex. Moreover, the conformational rearrangement of the two finger domains observed in the Cys23NCp7 mutant (21Déméné H. Dong C.Z. Rouyez M.C. Ruffault A. Jullian N. Morellet N. Mély Y. Ottmann M. Darlix J.L. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11707-11716Google Scholar) led to a severe loss of in vitro annealing activity, while the replacement of the Trp37 residue by Leu completely inhibited this activity, although interaction with nucleic acids was preserved in both mutants. These findings demonstrate unambiguously the critical importance for the annealing activity of NCp7 of a well structured zinc finger domain and of an aromatic residue (Trp) in position 37. They give structural explanations for the loss of virus infectivity observed in vivo following point mutations in the CCHC boxes and emphasize the interest of the zinc finger domain as a possible target for antiviral agents. NCp7 and derived peptides were synthesized on a 433 automated peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystem) using the hydroxymethylphenoxy-methyl-polystyrene resin as already described (7De Rocquigny H. Gabus C. Vincent A. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.P. Darlix J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6472-6476Google Scholar, 14de Rocquigny H. Ficheux D. Gabus C. Fournie-Zaluski M.C.

Amino acid side chains were protected byt-butyl or trityl groups and the NH2 group by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl). Amino acids were incorporated using dicyclohexylcarbodiimine/hydroxybenzotriazole as coupling reagents. At the end of the synthesis, the peptidyl-resin was treated for 2 h with trifluoroacetic acid in the presence of scavengers to obtain the crude peptide. Purification was performed by reverse-phase HPLC with acetonitrile-water gradients. The purity of the peptides was checked by electrospray mass spectroscopy. NCp7 and NCp7 derivatives (13–30, 34–51, 12–53, Cys23(12–53), Leu37(12–53)) were lyophilized in presence of 1.5 eq of ZnCl2 per zinc finger (14de Rocquigny H. Ficheux D. Gabus C. Fournie-Zaluski M.C.

The (13–56)NCp7dd in which the two zinc fingers have been replaced by a Gly-Gly unit has the following sequence: VKGGRAPRKKGGGTERQANF. pDM3/BssHII and pTL9/BanI plasmids were used for the in vitro HIV-1 RNA-(77–257) and tRNA3Lys transcription, respectively. The latter was kindly supplied by Dr. J. L. Darlix and C. Gabus (INSERM 412, Lyon). Ribo-Max™ large scale RNA production system T7 was used, following the supplier's instructions (Promega). The synthesis of tRNA3Lys was performed by using [α-33P]UTP as a marker (250 μCi per 10 μg of plasmid). The RNAs were purified by an 8% urea-polyacrylamide gel, and their concentrations were determined by UV measurements, using ε260 = 10,800 m−1cm−1, the ratio at 260 and 280 nm was around 2. RNA-protein interactions were initiated by incubation for 15 min at 37 °C in 15 μl of a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 80 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2. The different RNAs used were heat-denatured by heating for 2 min at 95 °C and then chilled at 0 °C for 2 min prior to use. The amount of RNA, 5.10−12 mol per assay, was kept constant. Different concentrations of protein were used depending on the experiment. The reaction was stopped by two addition of 1 μl of 20% glycerol containing 0.01% bromphenol blue. RNA-protein complexes were analyzed by native 7% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 100 mm Tris borate buffer (pH 8.0). The gel was run at 35 V/cm and 4 °C for 2 h and stained with ethidium bromide. The bands were visualized with a Polaroid MP-4 Land Camera on a Bio-Profil imager (Vilber Lourmat, Paris). The gel was then fixed with 10% acetic acid, 20% ethanol, dried, and autoradiographed.

Coffin J. RNA Tumor Viruses. II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1984: 559-1209Google Scholar). In vitro studies have shown that the nucleocapsid protein NCp7 is an important factor in promoting this hybridization process (7De Rocquigny H. Gabus C. Vincent A. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.P. Darlix J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6472-6476Google Scholar). To determine the role of the different parts of NCp7 in this activity, annealing of [33P]tRNA3Lys to RNA-(77–257), which contains the PBS, was measured in presence of NCp7 or various peptides derived from (12–53)NCp7, a fragment that encompasses the two zinc fingers (Fig. 1). RNAs and the peptide were co-incubated, for 15 min at 37 °C, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The samples were then directly analyzed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized using both ethidium bromide staining and autoradiography. Due to its construction, RNA-(77–257) has a tendency to spontaneously dimerize (Fig. 2 A, lane 1) (23Muriaux D. Girard P.M. Bonnet-Mathonière B. Paoletti J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8209-8216Google Scholar), and the experiment must be carried out at room temperature to obtain almost exclusively the monomeric form of RNA (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). However, a comparison of the experiments made at 4 °C and at room temperature (Fig. 2, A and B) shows that RNA dimerization did not interfere with the results, and further experiments were performed at 4 °C to reduce RNA degradation. As depicted in Fig. 2 D, preliminary experiments were carried out by using NCp7, but even at low concentrations (10 molar equivalents) the protein induced the formation of large aggregates unable to penetrate the gel, thus preventing the characterization of a RNA·tRNA hybrid complex.Figure 2Annealing of tRNA3Lys to RNA-(77–257) is promoted by (12–53)NCp7. Fixed concentrations of [33P]tRNA3Lys and RNA-(77–257) (5.10−12 mol of each denaturated RNA/assay) were incubated in a buffer with 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm MgCl2, and 80 mm NaCl, for 30 min at 37 °C, in the presence of 0, 10, 40, 70, 100, and 130 molar equivalents of (12–53)NCp7 (lanes 1–6, respectively) or 0, 10, 50 molar equivalents of NCp7 (lanes 7–9, respectively).

Vuilleumier G. Stoylova E. de Rocquigny H. Roques B.P. Gérard D. Mély Y. Biopolymers. 1997; 41: 301-312Google Scholar). When tRNA3Lys and RNA(77–257) were co-incubated in the presence of increasing (12–53)NCp7 concentrations, several features occurred depending on the ratio of protein/nucleic acids. At low concentrations of peptide (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2), a shift of the two RNAs was observed corresponding to the fixation of the peptide on both tRNA3Lys and RNA-(77–257). Addition of larger amounts of (12–53)NCp7 (Fig. 2 A, lane 3) led to a decrease of complexed tRNA3Lys and the appearance of a new band (noted c on Fig. 2 A) revealed both by ethidium bromide staining and autoradiography, which was attributed to the formation of a tRNA·RNA complex. The annealing activity of (12–53)NCp7 was maximum for 70 molar equivalents corresponding to one peptide for a total of 4–5 nucleotides. The hybrid complex coexisted with complexes formed between (12–53)NCp7 and both types of RNA, suggesting that the reaction is not complete in these conditions. In contrast to the large band corresponding to RNA·(12–53)NCp7 complexes, the ternary tRNA3Lys·RNA·(12–53)NCp7 complex migrated under the form of a fine band, suggesting a finite number of bound NCp7 molecules and a well defined conformation for this complex. When the peptide concentration was increased further, the binary complexes RNA·(12–53)NCp7 disappeared to the profit of both the ternary complex and high molecular weight aggregates containing the radiolabeled tRNA3Lys in the deposing wells. No gel shift was observed for the ternary complex (Fig. 2,band c), suggesting that the number of (12–53)NCp7 molecules bound to the complex is constant whatever the peptide concentration used. To determine if a particular domain of (12–53)NCp7 could direct the peptide hybridase activity, different fragments were tested. They correspond to the structural elements assumed to be involved in NCp7 functions: (13Berg J.M. Science. 1986; 232: 485-487Google Scholar, 14de Rocquigny H. Ficheux D. Gabus C. Fournie-Zaluski M.C.

When the two fingers were used separately, no gel shift was observed (Fig. 3, lanes 1–7). The (13–56)NCp7dd interacts with nucleic acids, as illustrated by a gel shift, but was unable to induce the annealing of tRNA3Lys to the PBS sequence of RNA-(77–257) (Fig. 3, lanes 8–10). This suggests that the presence of the three elements is necessary for NCp7 hybridase activity. The role of the conformational behavior of the finger domains of NCp7 was then studied by using two mutants of the (12–53)NCp7. The Cys23(12–53)NCp7 corresponds to the mutation of His23 of the first CCHC box to Cys. In NCp7, this mutation was shown to induce a rearrangement of the residues around the zinc ion and increase the distance between the two finger motifs (21Déméné H. Dong C.Z. Rouyez M.C. Ruffault A. Jullian N. Morellet N. Mély Y. Ottmann M. Darlix J.L. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11707-11716Google Scholar). The Cys23(12–53)NCp7 interacts with nucleic acids, since a gel shift was observed (Fig. 4, lanes 12–14), and promotes the formation of the ternary complex (Fig. 4, lane 13). However, the annealing activity of the mutant was considerably reduced as shown by the weakness of the hybrid band (band c, lane 3) obtained for a higher concentration of peptide. Leu37(12–53)NCp7 corresponds to the replacement of Trp37 in the second finger by a leucine. No structural data are yet available for this mutant, but Trp37 was shownin vivo and in vitro to be important for the interaction with nucleic acids, very likely through intercalation (19Dorfman T. Luban J. Goff S.P. Haseltine W.A. Göttlinger H.G. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6159-6169Google Scholar,26Lam W.C. Maki A.H. Casas-Finet J.R. Erickson J.W. Kane B.P. Sowder R.C. Henderson L.E.

Fig. 4 shows that, despite its ability to bind nucleic acids, this mutant peptide has completely lost the annealing activity of NCp7 as illustrated by the absence of a ternary complex (lanes 8–11). Taken together these results show that not only the presence of the fingers domain, but also their spatial arrangement and some specific amino acids (Trp37) are necessary for its hybridase activity. The retroviral NC proteins are highly basic molecules that contain one or two well conserved CX2CX4HX4C motifs capable of coordinating a zinc ion with a very high affinity (13Berg J.M. Science. 1986; 232: 485-487Google Scholar, 29Mély Y. Cornille F. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. Darlix J.L. Roques B.P. Gérard D. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 899-906Google Scholar, 30Mély Y. de Rocquigny H. Morellet N. Roques B.P. Gérard D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5175-5182Google Scholar). In HIV-1 virions, NCp7 contains two zinc fingers flanked by several basic residues. Mutation experiments have shown that the presence of the two fingers are required for all the in vivofunctions of NCp7 (19Dorfman T. Luban J. Goff S.P. Haseltine W.A. Göttlinger H.G. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6159-6169Google Scholar, 20Gorelick R.J. Chabot D.J. Rein A. Henderson L.E. Arthur L.O. J. Virol. 1993; 64: 3207-3211Google Scholar, 21Déméné H. Dong C.Z. Rouyez M.C. Ruffault A.

This has been strongly reinforced by point mutations of NCp7, such as the replacement of His23 by Cys or of Pro31 by Leu, which were shown to modify the structure of the zinc finger domain of NCp7 and to result in the complete loss of viral infectivity of the mutants (18Morellet N. de Rocquigny H. Mély Y. Jullian N. Déméné H. Ottman M. Gérard D. Darlix J.L. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 287-301Google Scholar, 21Déméné H. Dong C.Z. Rouyez M.C. Ruffault A.

Virol. 1995; 69: 1778-1784Google Scholar). However, in vitro experiments showed that annealing activity was apparently due mainly to the presence of a large number of basic amino acids in the flexible N- and C-terminal sequences surrounding the neutral zinc finger domain. Thus deletion of this domain and replacement of each CX2CX4HX4C box by a Gly-Gly moiety did not inhibit the formation of RNA·tRNA3Lys complexes (7De Rocquigny H. Gabus C. Vincent A. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.P. Darlix J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6472-6476Google Scholar). However, the conditions used in these experiments promoted the formation of high molecular weight aggregates also found to be induced by polylysine (23Muriaux D. Girard P.M. Bonnet-Mathonière B. Paoletti J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8209-8216Google Scholar) through nonspecific ionic interactions between basic amino acids of the protein and the negatively charged ribose phosphate backbone of nucleic acids. This avoided the direct visualization of tRNA·RNA hybrid complex in the gel as illustrated in this study (Fig. 2 D). Therefore, with the aim of studying the role of the zinc finger of NCp7, the N- and C-terminal parts of this highly basic protein were removed, and the resulting (12–53)NCp7 peptide was used in a new assay in which it was incubated with 33P tRNA3Lys and a shorter RNA-(77–257) fragment, which contains the PBS. The mixture was then directly analyzed by native gel electrophoresis without preliminary treatment with phenol to remove the protein (6Darlix J.L. Gabus C. Nugeyre M.T. Clavel B. Barré-Sinoussi F. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 689-699Google Scholar, 7De Rocquigny H. Gabus C. Vincent A. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.P. Darlix J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6472-6476Google Scholar, 23Muriaux D. Girard P.M. Bonnet-Mathonière B. Paoletti J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8209-8216Google Scholar). At low concentrations of (12–53)NCp7, the protein interacts with tRNA3Lys and RNA-(77–257) in agreement with previous results showing that NCp7 has a similar affinity for different types of RNA (27Mély Y. de Rocquigny H. Sorinas-Jimeno M. Keith G. Roques B.P. Marquet R. Gérard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1650-1656Google Scholar). In these experiments we cannot determine the exact number of peptide molecules bound on each species, but it is interesting to notice that in presence of 40 molar equivalents of NCp7, the ternary complex tRNA3Lys·RNA-(77–257)·(12–53)NCp7 was already formed and that the migration of the corresponding band was observed in its final position (in the presence of an excess of (12–53)NCp7). Moreover, the large reduction in the migration of the bands corresponding to binary complexes formed with tRNA3Lys and RNA-(77–257) suggest that most of the (12–53)NCp7 are bound to these RNAs and that only a small number of (12–53)NCp7 molecules are necessary to induce the annealing of tRNA3Lys to the PBS. Different approaches allowing the quantification of NCp7 molecules bound on the ternary complexes are required to answer this question. Another interesting observation is the shape of the band corresponding to the ternary complex, which is relatively discrete, suggesting a well defined conformation for this complex. The annealing of tRNA onto RNA-(77–257) requires the presence of both zinc fingers of NCp7, as shown by the lack of ternary complex formation observed with the isolated N- or C-terminal zinc fingers or with a peptide in which these domains have been replaced by a Gly-Gly linker. In the latter case, a shift of the tRNA3Lys band is in agreement with the binding of the basic linear peptide, indicating that ionic interactions involving the basic spacer plays a role in (12–53)NCp7 nucleic acids recognition. The presence of high molecular weight complexes embedding the tRNA3Lys was observed for high concentrations of (12–53)NCp7, a result which emphasizes the nucleic acids aggregating properties through nonspecific electrostatic interactions of highly basic peptides. This phenomenon, which was also observed with polylysine (23Muriaux D. Girard P.M. Bonnet-Mathonière B. Paoletti J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8209-8216Google Scholar), is dependent on the number of positively charged amino acids in the peptide (25Stoylov S.P. Vuilleumier G. Stoylova E. de Rocquigny H. Roques B.P. Gérard D. Mély Y. Biopolymers. 1997; 41: 301-312Google Scholar, 31Berkowitz R.D. Goff S.P. Virology. 1994; 202: 233-246Google Scholar) as clearly shown here when we compare the aggregation induced by NCp7 or its central (12–53) domain. The nonspecific RNA binding activity of the N- and C-terminal domains was previously observed in the binding of fusion proteins constituted by GST and NCp7 or various fragments to HIV-1 RNA domains (31Berkowitz R.D. Goff S.P. Virology. 1994; 202: 233-246Google Scholar). The requirement of the zinc fingers to ensure a specificity to this latter interaction was proposed to be due to complementary structural particularities in both NCp7 and HIV-1 RNA (31Berkowitz R.D. Goff S.P. Virology. 1994; 202: 233-246Google Scholar). The specificity of the annealing activity of the NCp7 zinc fingers is clearly illustrated by a comparison of the formation and position in the gel of the ternary complexes generated by the (12–53)NCp7 and its mutants. The replacement of His23 by Cys in NCp7 was shown to induce changes in the folding around the zinc atom in the proximal finger and a loss of the spatial proximity between the two zinc fingers (21Déméné H. Dong C.Z. Rouyez M.C. Ruffault A. Jullian N. Morellet N. Mély Y. Ottmann M. Darlix J.L. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11707-11716Google Scholar). The important loss of ternary complex formation observed here for this mutant demonstrates that the spatial arrangement of the central domain of the NCp7 encompassing the two zinc fingers and the short linker are critical for the hybridase activity. Interestingly, the migration of the ternary complex is different from that of the complex formed with the wild-type (12–53)NCp7, suggesting that either a smaller number of Cys23(12–53)NCp7 molecules are involved in the complex formation or that the complexes have structural differences. The biological relevance of the NCp7 folded conformation was demonstrated in vivo by mutations such as His23 → Cys or Pro31 → Leu, which give mutants with a complete loss of infectivity (18Morellet N. de Rocquigny H. Mély Y. Jullian N. Déméné H. Ottman M. Gérard D. Darlix J.L. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 287-301Google Scholar, 21Déméné H. Dong C.Z. Rouyez M.C. Ruffault A.

Virol. 1995; 69: 1778-1784Google Scholar). This was attributed, in the case of the His23 → Cys mutant, to a defect in reverse transcription and/or NCp-dependent steps leading to proviral integration (8Li X. Quan Y. Arts E. Li Z.

This could be due to a severe reduction in the hybridization of the tRNA3Lys to the PBS observed here and/or to other steps requiring nucleic acids hybridization, such as DNA strand transfer. In almost all retroviruses, aromatic amino acids are present either in each finger (HIV) or in one finger (Rous sarcoma virus, Moloney murine leukemia virus) (13Berg J.M. Science. 1986; 232: 485-487Google Scholar, 24Ottmann M. Gabus C. Darlix J.L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1778-1784Google Scholar, 34Covey S.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 623-633Google Scholar). Moreover, several studies have underlined the importance of Trp37 in HIV-1 (19Dorfman T. Luban J. Goff S.P. Haseltine W.A. Göttlinger H.G. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6159-6169Google Scholar, 26Lam W.C.

Marquet R. Gérard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1650-1656Google Scholar), its replacement by a nonaromatic amino acid leading to a loss of viral infectivity. When, Trp37 was replaced by a hydrophobic amino acid such as leucine in Leu37(12–53)NCp7, no ternary complex was observed, illustrating the crucial importance of Trp for the NCp7 hybridase activity. This could be related to the intercalation observed by NMR of Trp between two successive bases of short oligonucleotides such as d(ACGCC) (35Roques B.P. Morellet N. Déméné H. Schueler W. Jullian N. de Rocquigny H. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 673-680Google Scholar). The aim of this work was to characterize the domains of the HIV-1 NCp7 necessary for its hybridase activity. Our results show that the zinc fingers are necessary and sufficient for the NCp7-promoted annealing of tRNA3Lys to the PBS and underline the critical role of the three-dimensional structure of the peptide. The basic residues of NCp7 could be the driving force for NCp7·RNA complexation, whereas the fingers structure could ensure a proper orientation of the protein allowing for instance intercalation of Trp between two successive bases of single- or double-stranded nucleic acids (36Cameron C.E. Ghosh M. Le Grice S.F.J. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6700-6705Google Scholar). Therefore because of their requirement for NC protein activity, the zinc fingers represent an interesting target for the design of compounds aimed at selectively inhibiting the annealing of tRNA3Lys to viral RNA, a critical step for HIV-1 virus replication.

https://openalex.org/W2017298052,"Gene alterations in the retproto-oncogene, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, have been found to associate with several human diseases. In this study, we showed that induction of the vgf promoter activity is a good molecular indicator for RET activation in PC12 cells, a rat pheochromocytoma cell line. We demonstrated that all forms of RET oncoprotein, including RET chimeric oncoproteins found in human papillary thyroid carcinomas (RET/PTC) as well as RET oncoproteins found in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A and 2B (2A/RET and 2B/RET) can induce vgf promoter activity in PC12 cells. In contrast, a RET mutant found in a patient with Hirschsprung's disease, as well as a RET/PTC1 mutant with deletion of the dimerization domain, failed to induce vgf promoter activity in PC12 cells. We further determined that the signaling events mediated by phosphorylated Tyr294 and phosphorylated Tyr451 binding sites are essential for RET/PTC1 to inducevgf promoter activity in PC12 cells. We also showed that RET/PTC1, 2A/RET, and 2B/RET induce ELK-, cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB), or JUN-mediated gene expression in PC12 cells, and these three signaling events are mediated by phosphorylated Tyr294 and phosphorylated Tyr451 binding sites in RET/PTC1."
https://openalex.org/W1967052196,"The human vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) 1 receptor belongs to the new class II subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. Specific change by mutagenesis of a strictly conserved histidine into arginine at position 178 of the human VIP1 receptor resulted in its constitutive activation with respect to cAMP production. Transfection of the H178R mutant into COS cells resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in the cAMP level as compared with cells transfected with the wild type receptor or the vector alone. This increase was proportional to the amount of transfected cDNA. The H178R mutant exhibited an otherwise normal cAMP response to VIP as well as a dissociation constant similar to that of the wild type receptor. Other mutants at position 178 such as H178K, H178A, and H178D were not constitutively activated. They were otherwise expressed at the cell surface of transfected nonpermeabilized cells. Double mutants were then constructed in which the H178R mutation was associated with a point mutation in the the N-terminal extracellular domain that totally abolished VIP binding or VIP-stimulated cAMP production,i.e. E36A or D68A. The corresponding double mutants H178R/E36A and H178R/D68A were no longer constitutively activated. A control double mutant (H178R/D132A) with an unaltered dissociation constant for VIP and cAMP response to VIP was still constitutively activated. Our findings demonstrate that constitutive activation of the VIP1 receptor by mutation of His178 into R requires the functional integrity of the N-terminal extracellular VIP binding domain.

They might provide interesting generalities about the activation process of G protein-coupled receptors. G protein-coupled receptors with seven transmembrane domains, which constitute a large multigene family of eucaryotic proteins, interact with alkaloids, biogenic amines, peptides, glycoprotein hormones, light, and odorants (1Van Rhee A.V. Jacobson K.A. Drug Develop. Res. 1996; 37: 1-38Google Scholar). During the past few years, a subfamily of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors has emerged that shares the seven-membrane-spanning domain topography but has a low overall amino acid sequence homology (<20%) with other members of the superfamily (2Segre G.V. Goldring S.R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 4: 309-314Google Scholar, 3Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 805: 94-109Google Scholar). This subfamily, now referred to as the class II G protein-coupled receptor family, comprises receptors for a family of structurally related peptides that includes vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), 1The abbreviations used are: VIP, vasoactive intestinal peptide; PTH, parathyroid hormone; EMR1, epidermal growth factor module-containing, mucin-like hormone receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PTHrP, parathyroid hormone-related peptide. pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, glucagon, secretin, glucagon-like peptide 1, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, and growth hormone-releasing peptide and more unexpectedly also comprises receptors for parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitonin (2Segre G.V.

Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 805: 94-109Google Scholar) with the discovery of subtypes of the above mentioned receptors as well as two new members having an extraordinary long N-terminal domain: the putative EGF module-containing, mucin-like hormone receptor EMR1 (5Baud V. Chissoe S.L. Viegas-Pequignot E. Diriong S. N'Guyen V.C. Roe B.A. Lipinski M. Genomics. 1995; 6: 334-344Google Scholar) and the leukocyte activation antigen CD97 (6Hamman J. Eichler W. Hamman D.

Class II G protein-coupled receptors for peptides have homologies ranging between 30 and 50% and among several common structural properties have a large N-terminal extracellular domain (>120 amino acid residues) that contains highly conserved amino acids, including numerous cysteine residues and several potential N-linked glycosylation sites (2Segre G.V.

Chem. 1986; 261: 14482-14489Google Scholar), as a prototype of class II G protein-coupled receptors, we recently provided evidence for an important role of the N-terminal domain for ligand binding with several crucial residues (9Couvineau A. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 246-252Google Scholar) probably positioned in a tertiary structure maintained by multiple disulfide bonds (10Gaudin P. Couvineau A. Maoret J.J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 901-908Google Scholar). We also demonstrated the mandatory role of two glycosylation sites in this domain for correct delivery of the receptor to the plasma membrane (11Couvineau A. Fabre C. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Laburthe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1745-1752Google Scholar). Other functional domains for ligand recognition do exist, since we showed, by constructing receptor chimeras, that a structural determinant for peptide selectivity was made of three nonadjacent amino acid residues in the first extracellular loop and third transmembrane domain (12Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Maoret J.-J. Gaudin P. Nicole P. Laburthe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12795-12800Google Scholar). The role of extracellular domains in natural ligand binding has now been documented for several members of class II G protein-coupled receptors such as rat VIP1 and secretin (13Holtmann M.H.

Lusis A.J. Sawchenko P.E. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1993; 364: 208-213Google Scholar) receptors. Constitutively active mutants of several G protein-coupled receptors have been characterized experimentally by site-directed mutagenesis (24Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Google Scholar) and have been also described as disease-causing in humans (25Parma J. Duprez L. Van Sande J. Paschke R. Tonacherra M. Dumont J. Vassart G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 159-162Google Scholar,26Spiegel A.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 58: 143-170Google Scholar). A constitutively active mutant of a class II G protein receptor has been reported for the PTH-PTH-related peptide receptor in Jansen-type metaphyseal chondrodysplasia affecting a strictly conserved histidine residue in the first intracellular loop of this class of receptor (27Schipani E. Kruse K. Juppner H. Science. 1995; 268: 98-100Google Scholar). In view of the fact that class II G protein-coupled receptors display an original structure-function relationship with respect to ligand recognition and very low sequence homology with other G protein-coupled receptors (2Segre G.V. Goldring S.R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 4: 309-314Google Scholar, 3Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 805: 94-109Google Scholar), we further investigated their constitutive activation in the human VIP1 receptor whose structure-function relationship has been previously documented (3Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 805: 94-109Google Scholar). In this paper, we demonstrate that specific mutation of histidine 178 in the VIP receptor causes its constitutive activation. Moreover, we take advantage of the fact that the VIP binding site is located, at least in part, in the N-terminal extracellular domain to construct double mutants in which the histidine-to-arginine mutation critical for constitutive activation has been associated with point mutations in the N-terminal domain that prevent VIP binding. This new approach allowed us to show that the agonist-independent constitutive activation of the histidine-to-arginine mutant appears to require the integrity of the natural ligand binding site. These data provide new insight into the constitutive activation of G protein-coupled receptors. Enzymes for cloning, sequencing, and oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI) or Life Technologies, Inc. (Cergy-Pontoise, France), and synthetic oligonucleotides were from Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). [α-35S]dATP (1000 Ci/mmol) and other radioactive reagents were obtained from Amersham (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Synthetic porcine VIP was purchased from Neosystem (Strasbourg, France), and culture medium and horse fetal serum from Life Technologies. [125I]VIP was prepared and purified as described (28Laburthe M. Rousset M. Rouyer-Fessard C. Couvineau A. Chantret I. Chevalier G. Zweibaum A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10180-10184Google Scholar). The monoclonal anti-Flag antibodies were obtained from Eastman Kodak Co., and 125I-labeled antimouse IgG whole antibody from goat was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. All other chemicals of the highest quality commercially available were purchased from Sigma (Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France). The 1.4-kilobase EcoRI fragment containing the entire coding sequence of the human VIP1 receptor (7Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Darmoul D. Maoret J.J. Carrero I. Ogier-Denis E. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 769-776Google Scholar) was subcloned into the EcoRI site of the pAlter-1 vector, and single-stranded DNA ((+)-strand) was produced in Escherichia coli JM109. Full-length VIP receptor mutants were generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis as described (11Couvineau A. Fabre C. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Laburthe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1745-1752Google Scholar). Identification of the desired mutations was obtained by direct double-stranded sequencing of the regions encompassing mutations. Inserts encoding mutant sequences were subcloned in the eucaryote expression vector pCDNA3. The wild type and mutant receptors were all tagged in the N-terminal extracellular domain by inserting the marker octapeptide DYKDDDDK (Flag) between Ala30 and Ala31. The Flag sequence was inserted by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis as described above using 5′-GGGCCGGCGGGCGGCCAGGCGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGGCCAGGCTGCAGGAG-3′ oligonucleotide. This site of insertion was selected because it is localized between the end of the putative signal peptide (3Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 805: 94-109Google Scholar, 7Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Darmoul D. Maoret J.J. Carrero I. Ogier-Denis E. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 769-776Google Scholar) and Glu36 which has been shown to be the first crucial amino acid residue for human VIP1 receptor's functional properties (29Nicole P. Du K. Couvineau A. Laburthe M. Regul. Pept. 1996; 64 (abstr.): 139Google Scholar). It was verified that insertion of the Flag octapeptide sequence between Ala30 and Ala31 did not modify the dissociation constant for VIP or the dose response of VIP in stimulating cAMP production, as compared with the native human VIP1 receptor. Wild type and mutant VIP receptors were transfected into COS-7 cells or CHO cells. Cells were grown in medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for COS-7 or Ham's F-12 for CHO) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were transfected by the electroporation method using an Electropor II apparatus (Invitrogen). Briefly, 4 × 106 cells were preincubated in ice for 5 min with 15 μg of salmon sperm DNA used as carrier and 15 μg of wild type or mutant receptor cDNA constructs in phosphate-buffered saline. After electroporation (330 V, 500 microfarads for COS-7 cells or 1,000 microfarads for CHO cells, infinite resistance), cells were put on ice for 5 min and then transferred into culture medium containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin before seeding in Petri dishes for binding assay, 12-well trays for the cAMP assay or 24-well trays for antibody binding experiments, or on glass slides in 24-well trays for immunofluorescence studies. The culture medium was changed 16–18 h after transfection, and cells were used 48 h after transfection. The functional properties of wild type and mutant VIP receptors were analyzed by [125I]VIP binding to transfected cell membranes. Transfected COS-7 cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Then they were harvested with a rubber policeman and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and the cell pellets were incubated for 30 min on ice in a hypotonic 5 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4. Thereafter, cells were homogenized as described (28Laburthe M. Rousset M. Rouyer-Fessard C. Couvineau A. Chantret I. Chevalier G. Zweibaum A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10180-10184Google Scholar), and the homogenate was centrifuged at 11,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed with 20 mm HEPES buffer and stored at −80 °C until use. This pellet was referred to as the membrane preparation. Membranes (200 μg of protein/ml) were incubated for 60 min at 30 °C in 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.1% (w/v) bacitracin, 0.05 nm125I-VIP in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled VIP. The reaction was stopped as described (28Laburthe M. Rousset M. Rouyer-Fessard C. Couvineau A. Chantret I. Chevalier G. Zweibaum A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10180-10184Google Scholar). Specific binding was calculated as the difference between the amount of125I-VIP bound in the absence and the presence of 1 μm unlabeled VIP. Binding data were analyzed using the LIGAND computer program (30Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Google Scholar). Protein content in membrane preparations was evaluated by the procedure of Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 78: 248-254Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Transfected COS-7 cells or CHO cells were grown in 12-well trays as described above. The culture medium was discarded, and attached cells were gently rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7). They were then incubated with or without VIP under continuous agitation in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.1% (w/v) bacitracin, 0.01 mg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine as described (7Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Darmoul D. Maoret J.J. Carrero I. Ogier-Denis E. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 769-776Google Scholar). At the end of the incubation (30 min at room temperature), the medium was removed, and cells were lysed by 1 m perchloric acid. The cAMP present in the lysate was measured by radioimmunoassay as described (32Laburthe M. Rousset M. Boissard C. Chevalier G. Zweibaum A. Rosselin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2772-2775Google Scholar). Cell number was determined in parallel wells, and data are reported as pmol of cAMP/106 cells. Transfected cells were grown on 12-mm glass coverslips for 48 h as described above. After they were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), nonpermeabilized cells were incubated for 60 min at room temperature with the mouse monoclonal anti-Flag antibodies diluted 1:50 in PBS containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The cells were then washed three times with PBS and exposed for 60 min to the secondary antibody (FITC-goat anti-mouse IgG (Fab-specific) at a 1:250 dilution). Cells were then fixed for 5 min in PBS containing 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. The coverslips were mounted in 50% (v/v) glycerol in PBS, and selected fields were scanned using a Leica TCS 4D true confocal scanner composed of a Leica Diaplan inverted microscope equipped with an argon-crypton ion laser (488 nm) with an output power of 2–50 milliwatts and a VME bus MC 68020/68881 computer system coupled to an optical disc for image storage (Leica Lasertchnik GmbH). The emitted light was collected through a long pass filter on the target of the photo multiplier. Each sample was treated with a kalman filter to increase the ratio signalversus background. All image generating and processing operations were carried out using the Leica CLSM software package. Screen images were taken on Kodak Ektachrome film using a 35-mm camera. Cell surface expression of mutated receptors was assessed using the mouse monoclonal anti-Flag antibodies as described (33Gardella T.J. Luck M.D. Fan M.H. Lee C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12820-12825Google Scholar) with modifications. Transfected cells grown in 24-well trays (see above) were rinsed twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, and 0.5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (binding buffer), incubated for 4 h at room temperature with anti-Flag antibodies diluted 1:50 in binding buffer. Cells were then washed three times with binding buffer and exposed for 2 h at room temperature to the radiolabeled (400,000 cpm/well) second antibodies (125I-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG). Cells were rinsed again four times with binding buffer and then lysed with 250 μl of 0.5 m NaOH, and the radioactivity of the lysate was counted. Nonspecific binding was determined with cells that were incubated only with the125I-labeled second antibody. Binding of anti-Flag antibodies to epitope-tagged mutant receptors was given as a percentage of anti-Flag antibodies binding to epitope-tagged wild type receptor. Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of the wild type human VIP1 receptor, pointing out the amino acid residues that have been changed by site-directed mutagenesis in the present study. We first mutated histidine 178, which is highly conserved in class II G protein-coupled receptors. The histidine-to-arginine mutant (H178R) of the human VIP1 receptor, which mimics the situation found in constitutively activated PTH receptors (27Schipani E. Kruse K. Juppner H. Science. 1995; 268: 98-100Google Scholar), was transfected into monkey kidney COS-7 cells, and intracellular cAMP was measured. The basal cAMP level was 3.5-fold higher than the basal cAMP level measured after transfection of the wild type human VIP1 receptor (Fig. 2) or the vector alone (not shown). This latter observation suggests that the wild type receptor was not constitutively activated. Similar constitutive activity of the H178R mutant was observed upon transfection of the CHO cell line derived from Chinese hamster ovary (not shown). Indeed, basal cAMP level in CHO cells transfected with the H178R mutant was 5 times higher than that observed for the wild type receptor, i.e.19.5 ± 5.6 and 3.7 ± 1.4 pmol/106 cells (three experiments), respectively. Therefore, constitutive activation does not appear to be dependent on the nature of the cell line expressing the mutated receptor cDNA. Fig. 3 shows the cAMP response in COS-7 cells transfected by H178R mutant and wild type receptors upon stimulation by VIP. Maximal cAMP responses were identical. Half-maximal stimulations above basal level were obtained for similar concentrations of VIP in cells transfected with the H178R receptor or the wild type receptor, i.e. 1.5 ± 0.5 × 10−10m and 0.4 ± 0.1 × 10−10m, respectively. Scatchard analysis of VIP binding to COS-7 cell membranes indicated that the H178R receptor mutant bound VIP with a similar dissociation constant as compared with the wild type receptor (Table I). In these experiments, the concentration of VIP binding sites was higher in cells transfected with the wild type receptor than in cells transfected with the H178R receptor mutant (Table I). This observation did not favor the hypothesis that the higher basal cAMP level in cells transfected with H178R could be merely related to a higher expression of the receptor as compared with cells transfected with the wild type receptor inasmuch as the wild type receptor is not constitutively activated by itself (see above). However, to document this issue, we transfected COS cells with increasing concentrations of cDNA encoding the H178R mutant or wild type receptor. For the receptor mutant, it was observed that basal cAMP levels increased when increasing amounts of cDNA were transfected in COS cells (Fig. 4). In sharp contrast, the basal cAMP level in COS cells transfected with the wild type receptor was constant regardless of the amount of cDNA transfected (Fig. 4). This latter observation further argued against constitutive activity of the wild type human VIP1 receptor itself. For both the mutated and wild type receptors, we verified that VIP (10−6m)-stimulated cAMP levels increased with the amount of transfected cDNA (Fig. 4). Likewise, the ligand binding assay showed that the amount of 125I-VIP specifically bound to transfected cell membranes increased with the amounts of transfected cDNA for both the mutated and wild type receptors (not shown).Figure 2Basal (A) and VIP-stimulated (B) cAMP levels in COS cells expressing wild type (WT) human VIP1 receptor or His178 mutants of the receptor.

We mutated H178 into a neutral residue (H178A), an acidic one (H178D), or a basic one (H178K). Among these mutants, none was constitutively activated after transfection in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2). Moreover, these mutants were unable to mediate VIP-stimulated cAMP production (Fig. 2), probably because they no longer bound VIP (Table I). To determine the pattern of expression of these inactive mutants in transfected COS-7 cells, immunofluorescence studies and antibody binding experiments were performed. No antibodies to native human VIP1 receptors are currently available. However, the Flag sequence DYKDDDDK could be inserted between Ala30 and Ala31 in the N-terminal extracellular domain of the human VIP1 receptor without altering its phenotype with regard to VIP binding and VIP-stimulated cAMP production (see “Experimental Procedures”), indicating that insertion of the Flag epitope had no impact on the receptor's functional properties. Insertion of this extracellular epitope enabled us to perform immunofluorescence studies with the wild type and mutated receptors in nonpermeabilized transfected COS cells and also to assess cell surface expression of receptors by anti-Flag antibody binding to nonpermeabilized transfected COS cells. Confocal laser microscopy of nonpermeabilized COS cells expressing the epitope-tagged wild type receptor revealed intense fluorescence when incubated with the anti-Flag antibodies and subsequently with an FITC-labeled antimouse antibody (Fig. 5). This observation supported delivery of the receptor protein at the cell surface as expected for the wild type receptor. Untransfected COS cells that were incubated with both antibodies or COS cells expressing the epitope-tagged wild type receptor that were incubated only with the FITC-labeled antimouse antibodies showed no fluorescence (Fig. 5). Next, we examined all epitope-tagged mutants including H178R, H178A, H178D, and H178K mutants. It appeared that COS cells transfected with these mutants also showed intense fluorescence, indicating that mutants were expressed at the cell surface. Since immunofluorescence techniques are not quantitative, we measured cell surface expression of mutated receptors by antibody binding to cells expressing mutants and wild type receptor (Table II). It appeared that mutation of His178 into Arg or Lys caused no alteration in cell surface expression as compared with that of wild type receptor, whereas mutations into Asp or Ala caused significant although moderate reductions in cell surface expression (42 and 54% of wild type receptor, respectively). Altogether, these data indicated that the absence of VIP binding (Table I) and VIP-stimulated cAMP production (Fig. 2) observed for the H178A, H178D, and H178K mutants was not related to absence of expression at cell"

Cross-linking studies with the photoactivable phospholipid analog 1-O-hexadecanoyl-2-O-[9-[[[2-[125I]iodo-4-(trifluoromethyl-3H-diazirin-3-yl)benzyl]oxy]carbonyl]nonanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine reveal insertion of DnaA protein into the hydrophobic region of the bilayer; this insertion is accompanied by membrane-mediated dissociation of the tightly bound allosteric nucleotides ADP and ATP. Photolabeling of DnaA protein occurred with membrane properties that resembled those needed for reactivation of ADP-DnaA protein; efficient labeling of DnaA protein was observed only when the lipid analog was incorporated into anionic vesicles and the temperature during treatment was above the gel to liquid crystalline phase transition. Predominant hydrophobic photolabeling was localized within a single region of DnaA protein, a region that contains putative amphipathic helices and has been shown to contain information essential for functional interaction with membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1971312285,"The expression of cartilage-derived retinoic acid-sensitive protein (CD-RAP) is initiated at the beginning of chondrogenesis and continues throughout the cartilage development. In chondrocytes, CD-RAP is down-regulated by retinoic acid. To understand the molecular mechanism underlying this regulation and the cell-specific expression, the deletion constructs of the mouse CD-RAP promoter were transfected into chondrocytes and a melanoma cell line. The results revealed a domain that demonstrated high levels of expression specifically in chondrocytes. In this functional domain, we show that a cis-acting element, 5′-GCCTGAGGC-3′, binds to the trans-acting factor protein AP-2. Mutation of the AP-2 site on the CD-RAP promoter led to decreased transcription in C5.18 chondrocytes, indicating that this site may act as an activator of transcription. In contrast, increased concentration of AP-2, stimulated by retinoic acid, led to decreased transcription of the CD-RAP promoter, an effect that was abolished by mutation of the AP-2 binding site. The effect of AP-2 was further examined by co-transfection of C5.18 and HepG2 cells with the CD-RAP promoter constructs and an AP-2 expression plasmid. In a dose-dependent manner, cotransfection with AP-2 elevated and then decreased CD-RAP promoter activity. Taken together, these results suggest that AP-2 is involved in the biphasic regulation of CD-RAP transcription.

Cartilage-derived retinoic acid-sensitive protein (CD-RAP) 1The abbreviations used are: CD-RAP, cartilage-derived retinoic acid-sensitive protein; MIA, melanoma inhibitory activity; RA, retinoic acid; FCS, fetal calf serum; RCS, rat chondrosarcoma; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT, reverse transcription. is a newly discovered secretory protein cloned from chondrocytes (1Dietz U.H. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3311-3316Google Scholar). Its human homologue, melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA), was originally isolated from the media of a highly metastatic melanoma and exerts autologous growth-inhibitory effects on melanoma cells in vitro (2Blesch A. Bosserhoff A.K. Apfel R. Behl C. Hessdoerfer B. Schmitt A. Jachimczak P. Lottspeich F. Buettner R. Bogdahn U. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5695-5701Google Scholar, 3Bogdahn U. Apfel R. Hahn M. Gerlach M. Behl C. Hoppe J. Martin R. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5358-5363Google Scholar). CD-RAP is co-regulated with type II collagen by retinoic acid (RA) and is expressed exclusively by chondrocytes in adult rat and fetal bovine tissues (1Dietz U.H. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3311-3316Google Scholar). CD-RAP protein inhibits DNA synthesis in primary mature chondrocytes (4Kondo S. Cha S.H. Oganesian A. Zhu Y. Xie W.-F. Sandell L.J. Orthop. Trans. 1998; 21: 28Google Scholar), but its normal function during chondrogenesis remains unknown. CD-RAP was originally isolated as an mRNA down-regulated by RA in primary bovine articular chondrocyte cultures (1Dietz U.H. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3311-3316Google Scholar). Retinoids affect target genes by interacting with two families of ligand-dependent nuclear receptors, the RA receptors (RARα, -β, and -γ) and retinoid X receptors (RXRα, -β, and -γ) (5Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. Raven Press, NY1994: 319-349Google Scholar). Among the target genes identified for RA signaling are RARα3, RARβ isoforms, RARα2, and cellular retinoic acid-binding protein I and II genes. Synthesis of the transcription factor AP-2 is increased in response to RA with a lag period of 24–48 h in NT2 cells (6Luscher B. Mitchell P.J. Williams T. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1507-1517Google Scholar). Eukaryotic gene expression is subject to the combined action of multiple DNA-binding proteins interacting with specific DNA motifs present in the promoters and enhancers. The transcription factor AP-2 recognizes the palindromic sequence 5′-GCCNNNGGC-3′ (7Williams T. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 670-682Google Scholar). AP-2 has been shown to play a crucial role in the control of gene expression in response to cell differentiation signals within neural crest and epidermal cell lineages (8Mitchell P.J. Timmons P.M. Hebert J.M. Rigby P.W.J. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 105-119Google Scholar). So far, three isoforms of the AP-2 gene have been identified from humans and mice that recognize the same binding motif (9Oulad-Abdelghani M. Bouillet P. Chazaud C. Dolle P. Chambon P. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 338-347Google Scholar, 10Moser M. Imhof A. Pscherer A. Bauer R. Amselgruber W. Sinowatz F. Hofstadter F. Schule R. Buettner R. Development. 1995; 121: 2779-2788Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation by AP-2 may involve both positive and negative regulatory effects on gene expression (11Gaubatz S. Imhof A. Dosch R. Werner O. Mitchell P. Buettner R. Eilers M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1508-1519Google Scholar, 12Kannan P. Buettner R. Chiao P.J. Yim S.O. Sarkiss M. Tainsky M.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1258-1269Google Scholar, 13Duan C. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24844-24851Google Scholar). Two independent groups have recently generated the mouse lines where the AP-2 gene has been disrupted by homologous recombination (14Schorle H. Meier P. Buchert M. Jaenisch R. Mitchell P.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 235-238Google Scholar, 15Zhang J. Hagopian-Donaldson S. Serbedzija G. Elsemore J. Plehn-Dujowich D. McMahon A.P. Flavell R.A. Williams T. Nature. 1996; 381: 238-241Google Scholar). The AP-2 null mice died perinatally with cranio-abdominoschisis and severe dismorphogenesis of the face and skull, suggesting an AP-2 effect on the skeletal development. Recent studies have shown that the human MIA/CD-RAP promoter directs a high level of gene expression specifically in human and murine melanoma cells (16Bosserhoff A.K. Hein R. Bogdahn U. Buettner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 490-495Google Scholar). We have recently cloned and analyzed the mouse CD-RAP gene (17Bosserhoff A.K. Kondo S. Moser M. Dietz U.H. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Buettner R. Sandell L.J. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 516-525Google Scholar). In the present study, we evaluated the functional regulatory domains in the mouse CD-RAP promoter by transient transfection into chondrocyte and melanoma cell lines and demonstrated that an AP-2 binding motif may be a positive regulatory domain for chondrocyte-specific promoter activity. In contrast, the increase in AP-2 plays an important role in transcriptional reduction of CD-RAP in response to RA in chondrocytes. CD-RAP is the first gene specifically expressed in the skeletal development found to be regulated by AP-2. As CD-RAP is expressed during the chondrogenesis phase of endochondral bone formation, these findings may provide insight into the severe skeletal deformation observed in the AP-2-deficient animals.

The rat calvaria chondrogenic cell line RCJ 3.1 C5.18 was kindly provided by Drs. Jane Aubin and Johan Heerche. The rat chondrosarcoma (RCS) cell line was provided by Dr. James H. Kimura. Human AP-2αA expression plasmid in pCMX-PL1 vector was provided by Dr. Reinhard Buettner. Human AP-2 expression plasmid SP-AP-2 and the control vector SP-NN were from Dr. Trevor Williams (7Williams T. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 670-682Google Scholar). RCJ 3.1 C5.18 cells were maintained in α-modified Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS and 10 nm dexamethasone to preserve their cartilage phenotype (18Grigoriadis A.E. Aubin J.E. Heersche J.N.M. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 2103-2110Google Scholar). Primary chondrocytes were prepared from bovine articular cartilage as described by Kuettner et al.(19Kuettner K.E. Pauli B.U. Gall G. Memoli V.A. Schenk R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 743-750Google Scholar) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FCS as were B16 (mouse melanoma cell line), BALB/3T3 (mouse fibroblast), and RCS cells. HepG2 (human liver hepatoblastoma) cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium with 2.0 mm l-glutamine, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, Earle's buffered salt solution, and 10% FCS. To investigate the RA effect on CD-RAP expression and protein binding, all-trans-RA was dissolved in absolute ethanol to obtain the 1000 × stock solution at various concentrations. An aliquot of the stock solution was added to the prewarmed medium, which was then added to the culture. The ethanol vehicle served as a control and was added to the medium to a final concentration of 0.1%. To construct the CD-RAP promoter 5′-deletion constructs, the mouse CD-RAP template was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a 3′-antisense primer that bound at −3 relative to the CD-RAP translational start site in conjunction with different 5′-sense primers that bound at varying distances within the CD-RAP upstream flanking sequence. To facilitate subcloning of the amplified fragments, the antisense primer contained aHindIII restriction site adaptor, and the sense primer contained a SmaI site. The PCR fragments and the luciferase expression vector pGL3-Basic were digested separately withSmaI and HindIII before ligation. The nomenclature used for each deletion construct (shown in Fig. 1) indicates the number of base pairs of the upstream 5′-flanking sequence with respect to the ATG translation start codon. Site-directed mutagenesis within the CD-RAP promoter was performed by PCR (20Aiyar A. Leis J. Biotechniques. 1993; 14: 366-368Google Scholar). The wild type and the mutated DNA constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. DNA transfection of RCS cells was performed by electroporation as described by Mukhopadhyay et al. (21Mukhopadhyay K. Lefebvre V. Zhou G. Garofalo S. Kimura J.H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27711-27719Google Scholar). C5.18, B16, HepG2, and 3T3 were transfected by the lipofection method. Briefly, the cells were cultured in the 35-mm dishes. Each cationic lipid/plasmid DNA suspension was prepared by mixing 2 μg of the luciferase reporter plasmid and 0.5 μg of the internal control plasmid pCMV-β-Gal with a solution of DOTAP in Hepes (20 mm, pH 7.4) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were harvested 48 h later, and the lysate was analyzed for luciferase activity with a Turner TD 20e luminometer using Promega luciferase assay reagent. The galactosidase activity was measured with 50 μl of the lysate using the colormetric assay as described by the manufacturer. The luciferase activities were normalized to the β-galactosidase value. At least three independent transfection experiments were carried out for each construct. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Nuclear extracts were prepared from the cultured cells by the method of Dignam et al. (22Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar), except that all of the buffers were supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm each of leupeptin and pepstatin). For RA stimulation, the C5.18 cells were harvested after treatment with 1 μmof RA for 2 days. Fragment A (between −401 and −548 relative to the mouse CD-RAP translational start site) was amplified by PCR. All oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer. The fragment A was end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Band shifts were performed by incubating 4 μg of the extract in the mobility shift buffer (2.5 μg of poly(dI-dC)·(dI-dC), 4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) with the DNA probe. For the competition studies, the cold oligonucleotides were added at a 100-fold molar excess and incubated for 10 min at room temperature before adding the DNA probe. DNA protein complexes were resolved on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel at 120 V for 2–3 h. For the antibody interference experiments, the antibody or preimmune serum was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 30 min at room temperature before being analyzed on a polyacrylamide gel. The AP-2 antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology reacts with AP-2α but not with AP-2β or AP-2γ. Total RNA was isolated from C5.18 and B16 cells using Qiagen RNeasy Midi Kits. For the study of the RA effect on AP-2 expression, the C5.18 cells were treated with 1 μmof RA for 2 days before they were harvested. RT-PCR was performed as described previously (10Moser M. Imhof A. Pscherer A. Bauer R. Amselgruber W. Sinowatz F. Hofstadter F. Schule R. Buettner R. Development. 1995; 121: 2779-2788Google Scholar). 2 μg of total RNA was used to synthesize the first strand. Primers 5′-CTGTTCAGTTCCGGGTCGCC-3′ and 5′-CGGTCCTGAGCCAGCAGG-3′ were added to amplify the AP-2αA and expected to yield a 426-base pair product. 10 μl of PCR products was electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel. To facilitate quantification, DNA was transferred to Hybond-N membrane and hybridized with the32P-labeled specific human AP-2αA cDNA. Amplification of the β-actin mRNA served as a control as described by Covert and Splitter (23Covert J. Splitter G. Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1995; 49: 39-50Google Scholar). Northern blot was carried out as described previously (10Moser M. Imhof A. Pscherer A. Bauer R. Amselgruber W. Sinowatz F. Hofstadter F. Schule R. Buettner R. Development. 1995; 121: 2779-2788Google Scholar). 8 μg of total RNA was loaded on 1.0% agarose formaldehyde gels and blotted onto nylon membranes. Hybridization was performed using radiolabled specific AP-2αA cDNA probe. The bands of the autoradiograph were quantitated by densitometry using the ISS SepraScan 2001TM1-D system (ISS-Enprotech). The 5′-flanking sequence of the mouse CD-RAP gene was fused to a promoterless luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-Basic and tested for its ability to generate luciferase activity in the transiently transfected cells (Table I). As expected, the construct m2251 generated expression in melanoma cell line B16 and no expression in BALB/3T3. In addition, m2251 also demonstrated relatively high luciferase activity in chondrocytes and chondrosarcoma cells, suggesting that this CD-RAP upstream sequence contains the elements necessary for chondrocyte activity. Subsequent experiments were performed using RCJ 3.1C5.18 cells as the representative chondrocytes.Table IComparison of the mouse CD-RAP promoter activity in different cell typesPlasmidsCell typeRCSC5.18B163T3pGL3-B0.18 ± 0.041.52 ± 0.8932.46 ± 16.810.47 ± 0.27pGL3-C2317.00 ± 102.23233.45 ± 96.612299.66 ± 414.58508.50 ± 42.32m225110.78 ± 3.5672.04 ± 1.41326.37 ± 45.110.61 ± 0.20m2251/pGL3-B59.947.410.01.3 Open table in a new tab The rat calvaria chondrogenic cell line RCJ 3.1 C5.18 cells maintain their cartilage phenotype under the appropriate conditions (18Grigoriadis A.E. Aubin J.E. Heersche J.N.M. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 2103-2110Google Scholar). The synthesis of type II collagen, aggrecan, and CD-RAP mRNA by C5.18 cells was confirmed by Northern blot analysis (data not shown). To identify the cis-acting elements mediating the mouse CD-RAP expression in chondrocytes, we transfected a series of the nested deletion CD-RAP promoter-luciferase expression plasmids into C5.18 and B16 cells and measured the luciferase activities generated in these cells. In B16 melanoma cells, the construct m277 generated the highest activity, while the activities of longer promoter constructs were consistently lower (Fig. 1 A). In C5.18 cells, although the construct m277 could confer high activity, the longer constructs were also active, for example the construct m475 generated a 75-fold higher activity compared with the promoterless luciferase vector (Fig. 1 B). The luciferase activity was altered when upstream sequences of the CD-RAP promoter were deleted and transfected into the C5.18 cells, suggesting the presence of several positive and negative regulatory elements (Fig. 1 B). Deletion of the promoter sequence from −1051 to −898 resulted in increased expression approximately 2-fold, identifying one or more silencer(s). The comparison of promoter activities generated by the constructs m657 and m548 revealed at least one negative regulatory element in this region. Deletion of the promoter sequence from −401 to −277 suggested another negative element. In contrast, truncation of the promoter sequences from −898 to −657, from −475 to −401, and from −277 to −216 showed a reduction of the promoter activity, suggesting the presence of at least three positive cis-acting sequences among these sites. According to the transient transfection analysis, the addition of the sequences from −401 to −475 relative to the ATG protein start codon showed a remarkable increase in the promoter activities in C5.18 cells, implying that this region contained the positive regulatory elements for chondrocyte expression. In contrast, the luciferase activity of the constructs m401 and m475 varied slightly in the melanoma cells, and both of them expressed lower activities in B16 compared with the construct m277. We amplified a fragment (fragment A, −401 to −548) by PCR and performed gel mobility shift analyses to test whether this fragment binds to any protein factor that might regulate the CD-RAP promoter activity in chondrocytes. One strong DNA protein complex was observed with the B16 cell lysate (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). An identical but fainter band was observed in the nuclear extracts of bovine articular cartilage and C5.18 cells (data not shown). To more precisely localize the DNA binding site, we carried out mobility shift assays using a series of synthetic oligonucleotides to compete against the labeled fragment A for protein binding. Fig. 2 A shows the relative position of the five 30- or 20-mer oligonucleotide competitors. The competition was performed using the nuclear extract prepared from B16 cells. As shown in Fig. 2 B, a 30-base pair competitor designated oligo 3 effectively inhibited the binding of the probe. The oligo 3 contains an AP-2 cis-acting motif as shown in Fig. 2 A. The AP-2 site is located between −456 and −463 relative to the ATG protein start codon. To determine whether the protein binding could be competed by the known cis-acting sequences, we carried out gel shift analysis with the consensus oligonucleotides. The bandshift was inhibited by the consensus AP-2 oligonucleotide but not by the oligonucleotides containing AP1, Sp1, and OCT1 consensus sequences (data not shown), suggesting that AP-2 or a related protein bound to the CD-RAP promoter. To determine which nucleotides of CD-RAP were important for the protein binding, mutations were introduced into the oligonucleotide competitors. Fig. 3 A shows the sequences of oligo 3 with the wild type and the mutated AP-2 motifs. In the competition study, the mutations of GCC residues in the AP-2 core sequence (MuA and MuB) partially abolished the binding properties of the oligonucleotides, and they were not able to act as the effective competitors (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, the oligo 3 still competed for the protein binding when mutated at T and A residues (MuC and MuD). This result is consistent with the AP-2 core recognition element for the AP-2 binding site, 5′-GCCNNNGGC-3′, where the internal 3 nucleotides are not critical for the binding (7Williams T. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 670-682Google Scholar). To confirm the binding of AP-2, a supershifted DNA-protein complex was obtained by incubating the labeled fragment A with the B16 extract and the antibody directed against AP-2. The preimmune serum did not alter the electrophoretic mobility pattern of the complex (Fig. 3 C). To investigate the function of the cis-acting AP-2 motif in the CD-RAP promoter, we introduced the same mutations that abolished the binding activities in mobility shift experiments (MuA and MuB) by site-directed mutagenesis within the context of the strongly expressing reporter plasmid m475 and the longest promoter construct m2251. As shown in Fig. 4, the activities generated by the AP-2 mutant plasmid m2251-MuA decreased approximately 2-fold in comparison with its wild type promoter construct in C5.18 cells. In addition, the same mutation A within the construct m475 (m475-MuA) resulted in reduction of the promoter activity almost 3-fold. The construct m475-MuB also decreased the promoter activity. These results suggest that the AP-2 motif may act as a positive regulatory element necessary for the full expression of CD-RAP in chondrocytes under normal culture conditions. The remaining levels of CD-RAP promoter activity suggest that additional elements also contribute to its constitutive expression in chondrocytes. Since the previous experiment suggested that inhibition of the binding of AP-2 by mutagenesis of the AP-2 site reduced the CD-RAP transcription, and the binding of AP-2 in chondrocytes was faint in the gel shift assay, we expected that the constitutive concentration of AP-2 would be very low in C5.18. AP-2 gene expression is up-regulated in many cell types by the developmental morphogen, RA (6Luscher B. Mitchell P.J. Williams T. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1507-1517Google Scholar). We therefore speculated that RA might stimulate the AP-2 expression in chondrocytes, resulting in more AP-2 binding to the CD-RAP promoter. Semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed to investigate the effect of RA on AP-2 gene expression. Equal amounts of total RNA harvested from the C5.18 cells treated with ethanol control or RA were used. As shown in Fig. 5 A, AP-2αA transcript levels were increased after 48 h of exposure to RA. Northern blot confirmed the stimulation of AP-2 expression in C5.18 cells by RA (Fig. 5 B). Densitometric analysis revealed low levels of AP-2 RNA in the untreated C5.18 cells that increased 6-fold at 48 h of RA treatment. The AP-2 level in B16 cells was about 10 times higher than that in the untreated C5.18 cells. We then conducted a gel shift assay using the C5.18 lysates derived from the cells treated with RA for 2 days. A DNA-protein complex appeared at the AP-2 corresponding position (Fig. 6). This complex was inhibited by the oligo 3, which contains the AP-2 binding site and a consensus AP-2 oligo, but not by the mutant A of the oligo 3 (CC → AA). A supershift complex was specifically induced by the antibody against AP-2. As a control, the Sp1 antibody was unable to shift the DNA-protein complex. These experiments confirmed that RA increased the AP-2 expression in C5.18 cells, leading to more binding to the CD-RAP promoter in the gel shift assay. We have previously shown that RA down-regulates the CD-RAP expression (1Dietz U.H. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3311-3316Google Scholar). Since we now have shown that RA increases the AP-2 expression in C5.18 cells, we sought to determine whether AP-2 plays a role in the regulation of CD-RAP expression by RA. The wild type construct m2251, the mutated construct m2251-MuA, and the AP-2 deletion construct m455 were employed. RA or ethanol was added just prior to the transfection. RA caused a reduction of promoter activity in the construct m2251 in a concentration ranging from 10 nm to 1 μm (Fig. 7). Mutation of the AP-2 site (construct m2251-MuA) and deletion of the AP-2 site (construct m455) abolished the ability of RA to inhibit CD-RAP gene expression. In addition, RA also inhibited the promoter activity of the construct m475 containing the AP-2 site but had no effect on the construct m415 lacking the AP-2 site (data not shown). This experiment strongly suggests that the AP-2 binding site is involved in the RA-induced reduction of the CD-RAP transcription. We have shown that AP-2 may stimulate CD-RAP transcription, since mutation of the AP-2 motif reduces its promoter activity in C5.18 cells. On the other hand, high levels of AP-2 expression apparently inhibit the transcriptional activation of CD-RAP. The RT-PCR result revealed that the AP-2 transcript levels were significantly elevated upon RA treatment, and the increase in AP-2 with RA treatment is correlated with a decrease in CD-RAP promoter activity. These results suggest that AP-2 may have a biphasic effect on CD-RAP transcription dependent on the AP-2 concentration. To test this hypothesis, HepG2 cells that are considered to be AP-2-deficient (24Williams T. Admon A. Luscher B. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1557-1569Google Scholar) were transfected with the construct m2251 and a human AP-2 expression plasmid AP-2αA in pCMX-PL1 vector. In the absence of the AP-2 expression vector, the activity of m2251 was low in HepG2 cells. In contrast, CD-RAP activity was induced by AP-2 in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 8 A). As control, AP-2 had no effect on the promoterless construct pGL3-B and the construct m455, which does not include the AP-2-binding site (data not shown). To determine whether expression of AP-2 affects the transcriptional activity of CD-RAP in C5.18 cells, the plasmid AP-2αA was cotransfected with the construct m2251. Fig. 8 B shows that AP-2 slightly increased CD-RAP expression at low doses. Maximal activity was obtained at a dose of 0.25 μg of DNA/dish (35 mm). The CD-RAP expression was inhibited by high doses of AP-2. AP-2 reduced the CD-RAP promoter activity approximately 2-fold at a dose of 2.0 μg of AP-2αA DNA/dish. Similarly, another AP-2 expression plasmid (SP-AP2) also inhibited the CD-RAP promoter activities at high concentrations (data not shown). These results demonstrate that high expression of AP-2 results in the reduction of the CD-RAP promoter activity in C5.18 cells. Last, to confirm that the exogenous AP-2 protein binds to the AP-2 DNA motif, we cotransfected the wild type and mutated CD-RAP promoter constructs into C5.18 cells along with 2 μg of human AP-2αA plasmid. 2 μg of AP-2 plasmid was shown above to decrease CD-RAP expression. As shown in Table II, the transcription of the wild type constructs m2251 and m475, both containing the AP-2 motif, was down-regulated more than 50% by AP-2. In contrast, mutation of the AP-2 binding site (m2251-MuA and m475-MuA) and deletion of AP-2 site (m455) abolished the AP-2 effect. This experiment confirms that the AP-2 motif is the primary site for AP-2 binding and is responsible for the reduction of the mouse CD-RAP transcription in C5.18 cells.Table IIAP-2 effect on the CD-RAP expression: effects of the mutated AP-2 cis-acting sequencesConstructsAP-2-induced reduction%m225154 ± 6.7m47558 ± 8.1m2251-MuA11 ± 3.8m475-MuA5 ± 2.3m4550 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab CD-RAP is thus far known to be expressed in chondrocytes (1Dietz U.H.

Dyn. 1997; 208: 516-525Google Scholar) and melanoma cells (2Blesch A. Bosserhoff A.K. Apfel R. Behl C. Hessdoerfer B. Schmitt A. Jachimczak P. Lottspeich F. Buettner R. Bogdahn U. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5695-5701Google Scholar, 16Bosserhoff A.K. Hein R. Bogdahn U. Buettner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 490-495Google Scholar). The function of CD-RAP is unclear, although it is thought to be involved in the regulation of DNA synthesis and cell shape (2Blesch A. Bosserhoff A.K. Apfel R. Behl C. Hessdoerfer B. Schmitt A. Jachimczak P. Lottspeich F. Buettner R. Bogdahn U. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5695-5701Google Scholar). In this report, we present evidence for the involvement of the trans-acting factor, AP-2, in the regulation of CD-RAP transcription. These results show, for the first time, a functional role of AP-2 in cartilage differentiation and a potentially physiologically relevant RA effect mediated through AP-2 binding. The results are particularly significant in light of the recent reports of a severe skeletal phenotype resulting from disruption of the mouse AP-2 gene (14Schorle H. Meier P. Buchert M. Jaenisch R. Mitchell P.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 235-238Google Scholar, 15Zhang J. Hagopian-Donaldson S. Serbedzija G. Elsemore J. Plehn-Dujowich D. McMahon A.P. Flavell R.A. Williams T. Nature. 1996; 381: 238-241Google Scholar). AP-2 functions in mediating the regulation of gene expression in response to a number of different signal transduction pathways. Phorbol esters and cyclic AMP induce AP-2 activity independent of protein synthesis (25Imagawa M. Chiu R. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 51: 251-260Google Scholar). RA induces AP-2 activity by increasing AP-2 mRNA levels in human teratocarcinoma cells (6Luscher B. Mitchell P.J. Williams T. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1507-1517Google Scholar) and P19 embryonic carcinoma cells (9Oulad-Abdelghani M. Bouillet P. Chazaud C. Dolle P. Chambon P. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 338-347Google Scholar). In addition, AP-2 is associated with the programmed gene expression during retinoid-controlled murine embryogenesis (8Mitchell P.J. Timmons P.M. Hebert J.M. Rigby P.W.J. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 105-119Google Scholar). Restricted spatial and temporal expression patterns of AP-2 have been detected in several embryonic tissues, in particular in neural crest-derived cell lineages and in limb bud mesenchyme during the developmental stage when they are known to be retinoid-sensitive. Analyses of AP-2 expression in the embryonic and adultXenopus tissues suggest a role for AP-2 in regulation of keratin gene expression during skin differentiation (26Snape A.M. Winning R.S. Sargent T.D. Development. 1991; 113: 283-293Google Scholar). Our deletion analysis of the CD-RAP promoter identified a fragment that includes an AP-2 motif and generates a high level of expression specifically in chondrocytes. Mutation or deletion of this AP-2 site led to decreased CD-RAP transcription in the transiently transfected chondrocytes, indicating that AP-2 may act as an activator of transcription for CD-RAP. Since mutation of the AP-2 site did not completely inhibit CD-RAP transcription, factors other than AP-2 may also be important in chondrocyte expression. Sox9 has recently been shown to be involved in the control of the cell-specific activation of COL2A1 in chondrocytes and to directly regulate the type II collagen genein vivo (27Lefebvre V. Huang W. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Google Scholar, 28Bell D.M. Leung K.K.H. Wheatley S.C. Ng L.J. Zhou S. Ling K.W. Sham M.H. Koopman P. Tam P.P.L. Cheah K.S.E. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 174-178Google Scholar). Gel shift and mutation analysis have identified a potential protein binding site for Sox9 at −409, and an Sp1 binding site at −100. The role of these sites in CD-RAP transcription is currently under investigation. RA plays an important role in the regulation of growth during embryonic development and cell differentiation. RA is involved in induction and morphogenesis of limbs (29Tickle C. Alberts B. Wolpert L. Lee J. Nature. 1982; 296: 564-566Google Scholar) and, in excess, is a potent teratogen predominantly deforming limbs, craniofacial structures, and the central nervous system (30Tamarin A. Crawley A. Lee J. Tickle C. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1984; 84: 105-123Google Scholar, 31Kochhar D. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scand. 1967; 70: 398-404Google Scholar, 32Langman J. Welch G.W. J. Comp. Neurol. 1967; 131: 15-26Google Scholar). RA also participates in the regulation of chondrocyte metabolism during endochondral ossification of the growth plate. Pacifici and colleagues (33Iwamoto M. Golden E.B. Adams S.L. Noji S. Pacifici M. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 205: 213-224Google Scholar) have shown that 10–100 nm RA stimulates the maturation of chondrocytes including causing growth plate chondrocytes in culture to flatten, thus favoring cell adhesion and spreading (33Iwamoto M. Golden E.B. Adams S.L. Noji S. Pacifici M. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 205: 213-224Google Scholar). RA clearly suppresses CD-RAP expression in chondrocytes at the mRNA level (1Dietz U.H. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3311-3316Google Scholar), and we show here that it inhibited the CD-RAP gene transcription. Mutation or deletion of the AP-2 site abolished the RA effect on CD-RAP expression, suggesting that AP-2 plays a critical role in the RA-induced down-regulation of CD-RAP in chondrocytes. AP-2 can both activate and inhibit gene expression in genes other than CD-RAP. For example, a biphasic response has been observed in the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-5 gene after cotransfection of AP-2 expression plasmid with the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-5 promoter construct. Our results showed that exogenously added AP-2 expression vector increased transcription of the transfected CD-RAP promoter in AP-2-deficient HepG2 cells. In chondrocytes, due to endogenous AP-2 expression, the addition of low levels of AP-2 exerted only slight activation of the CD-RAP promoter, while higher amounts of AP-2 inhibited CD-RAP promoter activity. Altogether, these results suggest that AP-2 may play a dual role in the control of CD-RAP expression. At low levels, as occur constitutively in chondrocytes, it may activate CD-RAP expression; at high levels, as occur with RA treatment, it suppressed CD-RAP expression. AP-2 has been shown to inhibit gene transcription by three mechanisms. First, an alternative splice product of AP-2αA, called AP-2αB, contains the activation domain of AP-2 and part of the DNA binding domain but lacks the dimerization domain necessary for DNA binding. AP-2αB is a potent inhibitor of transactivation by AP-2αA by interfering with binding of AP-2αA with DNA (34Buettner R. Kannan P. Imhof A. Bauer R. Yim S.O. Glockshuber R. Van Dyke M.W. Tainsky M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 7: 4174-4185Google Scholar). Second, AP-2 can inhibit transactivation of Myc by competing with an overlapping binding site as well as binding directly to Myc and impairing DNA binding of the Myc-Max complex (11Gaubatz S. Imhof A. Dosch R. Werner O. Mitchell P. Buettner R. Eilers M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1508-1519Google Scholar). Third, high levels of AP-2 can down-regulate gene expression by the mechanism of “self-interference” (12Kannan P. Buettner R. Chiao P.J. Yim S.O. Sarkiss M. Tainsky M.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1258-1269Google Scholar). Self-interference is thought to occur when excess AP-2 molecules interact with one or more putative AP-2 cofactors, making them unavailable for AP-2 function (12Kannan P. Buettner R. Chiao P.J. Yim S.O. Sarkiss M. Tainsky M.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1258-1269Google Scholar). Since there is no AP-2αB as detected by RT-PCR in the chondrocytes (data not shown) and no obvious overlapping cis-acting sequence and the RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis revealed that the AP-2 expression was significantly increased after RA treatment, we speculate that down-regulation of the CD-RAP promoter activity in chondrocytes by RA is due to the “self-interference” of AP-2. AP-2 recently, and unexpectedly, has been associated with the lethal skeletal defects in mice (14Schorle H. Meier P. Buchert M. Jaenisch R. Mitchell P.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 235-238Google Scholar, 15Zhang J. Hagopian-Donaldson S. Serbedzija G. Elsemore J. Plehn-Dujowich D. McMahon A.P. Flavell R.A. Williams T. Nature. 1996; 381: 238-241Google Scholar). The AP-2 knockout mice exhibited anencephaly, craniofacial defects, and thoraco-abdominoschisis. In the trunk and head, many bones were deformed or absent. The expression of skeletal patterning genes Pax-3, twist, and Msx-1 (14Schorle H. Meier P. Buchert M. Jaenisch R. Mitchell P.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 235-238Google Scholar) was normal, indicating that they were unaffected by removal of AP-2. Taken together with the involvement of AP-2 in the regulation of the CD-RAP gene expression, it is possible that this cartilage gene is abnormally expressed in the AP-2-deficient animals. We have generated a transgenic mouse line harboring the 2.2-kb mouse CD-RAP promoter used in the present studies, which shows chondrocyte-specific expression. 2W.-F. Xie and L. J. Sandell, manuscript in preparation. Mutations of the AP-2 motif in the CD-RAP promoter will be made using transgenic mice to clarify the role of AP-2 in CD-RAP expression in vivo.

We also thank Dr. Sherri Davies for helpful comments and suggestions."

Basal luciferase activities in vitro were the same for cells infected with either adenovirus-containing luciferase cDNA driven by GAL4/TATA (Ad/GT-Luc) or adenovirus-containing luciferase cDNA not driven by a promoter (Ad/PO-Luc). In vitro induction of GAL4/TATA by coinfection of cells with adenovirus expressing the GAL4/VP16 fusion protein (Ad/3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK)-GV16) was dose-dependent and reached as high as 4 × 104- to 9 × 104-fold above basal levels when GAL4/TATA and GAL4/VP16 were delivered at a ratio of 10:1.In vivo studies in Balb/c mice showed no detectable luciferase activities in liver or other tissues examined in mice infused with either Ad/GT-Luc or Ad/PO-Luc. High levels of luciferase activity were, however, elicited when animals were infused with Ad/GT-Luc and Ad/PGK-GV16. Together, these results suggest that combination of the GAL4 gene regulatory system with adenovirally mediated in vivo gene delivery may be applicable to the in vivo evaluation of promoter activities and in vivo targeting of gene expression.

Together, these results suggest that combination of the GAL4 gene regulatory system with adenovirally mediated in vivo gene delivery may be applicable to the in vivo evaluation of promoter activities and in vivo targeting of gene expression. The yeast GAL4 gene expression system is one of the most thoroughly studied eukaryotic transcriptional regulatory systems and has been used as a research tool in a variety of fields (1Sadowski I. Genet. Eng. 1995; 17: 119-148Google Scholar). Yeast regulatory protein GAL4 binds specifically to the GAL upstream activating sequence (UASG) to activate transcription of the adjacentGAL1 and GAL10 genes. It was consequently found that four related 17-base pair dyad symmetrical sequences within the UASG are responsible for GAL4-specific binding and transcriptional activation (2Giniger E. Varnum S.M. Ptashne M. Cell. 1985; 40: 767-774Google Scholar). In other research, a synthetic GAL4-responsive promoter containing GAL4-binding sites and a TATA box with minimal transcriptional activity in mammalian cells was found to be efficiently transactivated in the presence of a GAL4 transactivator (3Sadowski I. Bell B. Broad P. Hollis M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 11: 137-141Google Scholar, 4Chang C. Gralla J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7469-7475Google Scholar, 5Wang Y. O'Malley Jr., B.W. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8180-8184Google Scholar). Moreover, fusing the DNA binding domain of GAL4 protein to a highly acidic portion of the herpes simplex virus protein VP16 was shown to greatly increase the ability of GAL4 to activate transcription while preserving its DNA-binding specificity (6Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Google Scholar). This system was successfully used to target gene expression in Drosophila(7Fischer J.A. Giniger E. Maniatis T. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 332: 853-856Google Scholar, 8Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Google Scholar) and transgenic mice (9Ornitz D.M. Meredith R.W. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 698-702Google Scholar) and to control gene expression in mammalian cells (5Wang Y. O'Malley Jr., B.W. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8180-8184Google Scholar, 10Braselmann S. Graninger P. Busslinger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1657-1661Google Scholar). More recently, the technology has been used to induce the expression of transgenes delivered via the herpesvirus (11Oligino T. Poliani P.L. Marconi P. Bender M.A. Schmidt M.C. Fink D.J. Glorioso J.C. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 892-899Google Scholar) and to shut off the expression of viral genes (12Fang B. Koch P. Roth J.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4798-4803Google Scholar). Yet even though the synthetic GAL4/TATA promoter has been well characterized in cultured cells in vitro (3Sadowski I. Bell B. Broad P. Hollis M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 11: 137-141Google Scholar, 4Chang C. Gralla J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7469-7475Google Scholar, 5Wang Y. O'Malley Jr., B.W. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8180-8184Google Scholar), little is known about its basal activity and GAL4-mediated inducibility in various organs in vivo. Therefore, to characterize the basal transcriptional level and inducibility of the GAL4/TATA promoter, we constructed adenoviral vectors containing reporter luciferase cDNA driven by GAL4/TATA or expressing GAL4/VP16 fusion protein. Then we tested the induction of the GAL4/TATA promoter in vivo by adenovirally mediated gene codelivery. As a result, we found that the transcriptional activities of GAL4/TATA promoter were undetectable in a variety of organs in the absence of GAL4/VP16 and induced to several orders of magnitude in its presence. Our results therefore indicate that combining the GAL4 regulatory gene expression system with adenovirally mediated gene delivery might be a powerful tool for evaluating promoter activities and specificities in vivo. Construction of the Ad/RSV-Luc vector has been reported elsewhere (13Zhang W.W. Fang X. Mazur W. French B.A. Georges R.N. Roth J.A. Cancer Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 5-13Google Scholar). Vectors Ad/GT-Luc, Ad/GT-LacZ, Ad/PO-Luc, and Ad/PGK-GV16 1The abbreviations used are: PGK, 3-phosphoglycerate kinase; MOI, multiplicity of infection; RSV, Rous sarcoma virus. (Table I) were constructed as described previously (14Fang B. Eisensmith R.C. Li X.H. Finegold M.J. Shedlovsky A. Dove W. Woo S.L. Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 247-254Google Scholar). In brief, Ad/GT-Luc was constructed by placing luciferase cDNA from pGL3-Basic Vector (Promega, Madison, WI) at the downstream of the GAL4/TATA promoter (GT) derived from pG5EC (a gift from Dr. I. Sadowski, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada). A vector containing only the luciferase gene and a poly(A) signal sequence but no promoter (Ad/PO-Luc) was also constructed and used as a negative control. To induce GAL4/TATA activities in vitro and in vivo, an adenoviral vector (Ad/PGK-GV16) expressing a GAL4/VP16 fusion protein (GV16) driven by a housekeeping promoter (PGK) was constructed. This is accomplished by placing the cDNA for the GAL4/VP16 fusion protein excised from plasmid pM2/VP16 (also a gift from Dr. Sadowski) at the downstream of the mouse 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) gene promoter (15McBurney M.W. Sutherland L.C. Adra C.N. Leclair B. Rudnicki M.A. Jardine K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 19: 5755-5761Google Scholar). Recombinant virus from a single plaque was identified by DNA analysis, then expanded in 293 cells, and twice purified by ultracentrifugation on a cesium chloride gradient. Virus titers were determined by both optical absorbance at A260 (oneA260 unit = 1012 particles/ml) and by median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) assays as described previously (16Huyghe B.G. Liu X. Sutjipto S. Sugarman B.J. Horn M.T. Shepard H.M. Scandella C.J. Shabram P. Hum. Gene Ther. 1995; 6: 1403-1416Google Scholar). Titers determined by TCID50assay were used in subsequent experiments. All viral preparations were tested for E1+ adenovirus contamination by polymerase chain reaction (17Fang B. Eisensmith R.C. Wang H. Gordon G. Bellinger D.A. Read M.S. Brinkhous K.M. Woo S.L.C. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 217-222Google Scholar) and for cross-contamination by Ad/RSV-Luc by polymerase chain reaction using primers located in RSV long terminal repeat and luciferase cDNA. No contamination was detected in viral preparations used in our experiments.Table IThe adenoviral constructs and their expression cassettes of used in this studyVector namePromotercDNAAd/GT-LucGAL4/TATAFirefly luciferaseAd/PO-LucNo promoterFirefly luciferaseAd/RSV-LucRous sarcoma virus long terminal repeatFirefly luciferaseAd/GT-LacZGAL4/TATAE. coli LacZ geneAd/PGK-GV16Mouse 3-phosphoglycerate kinase gene promoterGAL4/VP16 fusion gene Open table in a new tab H1299 and A549 cells were plated at densities of 2 × 106/100-mm plate. The cells were then infected with recombinant adenoviral vectors at a multiplicity of infection (MOI)1 of 10 and grown at 37 °C. Cells were harvested 48 h after infection and frozen at −20 °C until used for protein and luciferase assays. All animals were cared for according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health publication number 85-23) and the institutional guidelines of The University of Texas, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. In vivo infusion of adenoviral vectors into and subsequent tissue removal from Balb/c mice were done as described previously (14Fang B. Eisensmith R.C. Li X.H. Finegold M.J. Shedlovsky A. Dove W. Woo S.L. Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 247-254Google Scholar). Cultured cells were lysed or tissues from Balb/c mice were homogenized in luciferase assay buffer. Cell or tissue debris was then removed by microcentrifugation. Protein concentrations were determined using a kit from Life Technologies, Inc. according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activities were determined using a luminometer and a luciferase assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). DNA was isolated from tissues of Balb/c mice infused with vectors or buffer alone. A semiquantitative assay of viral DNA in the tissues was performed via the polymerase chain reaction as described previously (14Fang B. Eisensmith R.C. Li X.H. Finegold M.J. Shedlovsky A. Dove W. Woo S.L. Gene Ther. 1994; 1: 247-254Google Scholar). The following polymerase chain reaction primers were used: 5′-TGCCTAGGCAAAATAG-3′ and 5′-CATCATCAATAATATAC-3′, located at the right end of the adenovirus genome. Differences between treatment groups were assessed by analysis of variance using SPSS software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). P values less than 0.05 were considered significant. In our studies, luciferase was used as a reporter to evaluate GAL4/TATA promoter activity in vivo because firefly luciferase assays are sensitive enough to detect even trace levels of promoter activity. Established human lung carcinoma cell lines H1299 and A549 were used to determine basal activity levels of GAL4/TATA in the adenoviral backbone. In brief, cells were infected with Ad/GT-Luc, Ad/PO-Luc, Ad/RSV-Luc, and Ad/GT-LacZ at MOI 10. Preliminary experiments showed that over 80% of the H1299 cells and over 20% of the A549 cells were transduced at MOI 10. Cells were then harvested 48 h after infection. Mock-infected cells were used as background controls. Luciferase activity was measured and expressed as relative light units/μg of cellular protein (Fig. 1). In both H1299 and A549 cells, the luciferase activity was significantly higher in cells infected with Ad/GT-Luc or Ad/PO-Luc than in cells infected with Ad/GT-LacZ (p < 0.05). These results are consistent with earlier reports of low basal activity of GAL4/TATA-driven reporters in HeLa and Chinese hamster ovary cells (3Sadowski I. Bell B. Broad P. Hollis M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 11: 137-141Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the same basal level of luciferase activity was observed in constructs without promoters (Ad/PO-Luc), thus suggesting that the basal activity may be unrelated to the GAL4/TATA promoter. It has been reported previously by others that expression of the GAL4-VP16 fusion protein via plasmid cotransfection increases the in vivoinduction of GAL4/TATA activity at least 1200-fold (3Sadowski I. Bell B. Broad P. Hollis M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 11: 137-141Google Scholar). To test whether the induction of GAL4/TATA activities might be similarly induced through adenovirally mediated gene codelivery, H1299 and A549 cells were infected at MOI 10 with a mixture of Ad/GT-Luc and Ad/PGK-GV16 in ratios of 1000:1, 100:1, and 10:1. Luciferase activities were then determined 48 h postinfection. As the ratio moved from 1000:1 to 10:1, the luciferase activities increased about 1 × 104- to 4.1 × 104-fold in H1299 cells and 75- to 9 × 104-fold in A549 cells. In contrast, no change in luciferase activity was observed in cells infected with mixtures of Ad/PO-Luc and Ad/PGK-GV16 at the same ratios. Moreover, mixing Ad/GT-LacZ or Ad/RSV-Luc with Ad/PGK-GV16 at a ratio of 10:1 had no significant effect on luciferase activities either. Thus, induction by adenovirally mediated gene codelivery appears to be dose-dependent and highly effective. In addition, the difference between the two cell lines in their response to the induction may be reflected by their sensitivity to adenoviral infections (12Fang B. Koch P. Roth J.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4798-4803Google Scholar). To determine the basal level of GAL4/TATA promoter activity in vivo, 6–8-week-old female Balb/c mice were infused through the tail vein with Ad/RSV-Luc, Ad/PO-Luc, Ad/GT-Luc, or Ad/GT-LacZ at a dose of 1 × 109/mouse. Mice infused with phosphate-buffered saline alone served as negative controls. All mice were killed 2 days after infusion, after which liver, spleen, lung, kidney, intestine, ovary, and brain were collected and homogenized for luciferase and protein assays. Luciferase activities were readily detected in liver, lung, spleen, heart, ovary, and kidney of mice infused with Ad/RSV-Luc. Levels of luciferase activities were absent or very low in all organs tested in animals infused with other viral constructs, including those infused with Ad/GT-Luc (Fig. 2). Together, these results demonstrated that the GAL4/TATA promoter was not activein vivo in the adenoviral backbone. To test whether GAL4/TATA promoter activity could be induced in vivoby adenovirally mediated gene codelivery as we demonstrated in vitro, a group of Balb/c mice infused with 1 × 109 plaque-forming unit of vector mixtures containing Ad/GT-Luc and Ad/PGK-GV16 (10:1) was included in the animal experiment mentioned above. Mice infused with Ad/RSV-Luc plus Ad/PGK-GV16 or Ad/PO-Luc plus Ad/PGK-GV16 at the same dose and ratio were used as controls. Although no luciferase activity was detected in mice infused with Ad/GT-Luc alone, luciferase activities were dramatically induced in all organs of mice treated with Ad/GT-Luc plus Ad/PGK-GV16. The induction ranged from 1.4 × 104-fold in brain to 9.3 × 106-fold in liver. No induction was found in animals treated with Ad/PO-Luc plus Ad/PGK-GV16, and no significant differences in luciferase activities were observed between animals infused with Ad/RSV-Luc alone or Ad/RSV-Luc plus Ad/PGK-Luc. Thus, these results demonstrated that in vivo induction of GAL4/TATA by GAL4/VP16 through adenovirally mediated gene codelivery is highly specific and efficient. These results also ruled out loss of vector infectivity as the reason why luciferase activity was undetectable in animals treated with Ad/GT-Luc alone. In conclusion, the undetectable transcriptional activity of GAL4/TATAin vivo supports our hypothesis that viral genes can be inactivated by promoter replacement (12Fang B. Koch P. Roth J.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4798-4803Google Scholar), a concept that may be used for the development of viral vectors or vaccines. Our results also suggest that combination of the GAL4 gene regulatory system and adenovirally mediated gene delivery will be sensitive tools for evaluating promoter activities and for inducing or amplifying gene expression in vivo. Thus, this technology may be applied in two ways: 1) in vivo evaluation of promoter activity and 2) targeted expression of transgenes. In the first case, tissue- or cell type-specific promoters can be easily evaluated by substituting a testing promoter for the PGK promoter to drive GAL4/VP16 cDNA. The sensitivity of in vivo measurement for a testing promoter could be markedly increased through the magnification of gene expression via the GAL4 regulatory system. As for the targeted expression of transgenes, replacing the PGK promoter with a tissue- or cell type-specific promoter may result in high levels of tissue- or cell type-specific expression of the transgenes driven by the GAL4/TATA promoter, thus overcoming the fact that most tissue-specific promoters have relatively low activities. Moreover, because current vector technology allows several expression cassettes to be incorporated into one vector, the efficiency of gene codelivery might be even further increased. We thank Dr. I. Sadowski for providing us the plasmids used in this study, Jude Richard for editorial review, Patricia Koch for technical assistance, and Monica Contreras for assistance in preparing this manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1569446107,"We have characterized the hyaluronan (HA) synthase activity of the Xenopus DG42 gene product in vitro. The recombinant enzyme produced in yeast does not possess a nascent HA chain and, therefore, is an ideal model system for kinetic studies of the synthase's glycosyltransferase activity. The enzymatic rate was optimal from pH 7.6 to 8.1. Only the authentic sugar nucleotide precursors, UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcA) and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), were utilized to produce a large molecular weight polymer. UDP-glucose or the galactose epimers of the normal substrates did not substitute. The Michaelis constant, Km, of recombinant DG42 in membranes was 60 ± 20 and 235 ± 40 μm for UDP-GlcA and UDP-GlcNAc, respectively, which is comparable to values obtained previously from membranes derived from vertebrate cells. The apparent energy of activation for HA elongation is about 15 kilocalories/mol. DG42 polymerizes HA at average rates of about 80 to 110 monosaccharides/s in vitro. The resulting HA polysaccharide possessed molecular weights spanning 2 × 106-107 Da, corresponding to about 104 sugar residues.

This is the first report characterizing a defined eukaryotic enzyme that can produce a glycosaminoglycan. Glycosaminoglycans (GAG), 1The abbreviations used are: GAG, glycosaminoglycan; HA, hyaluronic acid, hyaluronan, hyaluronate; HAS, hyaluronan synthase; GlcA, glucuronic acid; GlcNAc,N-acetylglucosamine; Glc, glucose; GalA, galacturonic acid; GalNAc, N-acetylgalactosamine; DTT, dithiothreitol; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2–2(hydroxymethyl)-propane1,3-diol.1The abbreviations used are: GAG, glycosaminoglycan; HA, hyaluronic acid, hyaluronan, hyaluronate; HAS, hyaluronan synthase; GlcA, glucuronic acid; GlcNAc,N-acetylglucosamine; Glc, glucose; GalA, galacturonic acid; GalNAc, N-acetylgalactosamine; DTT, dithiothreitol; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2–2(hydroxymethyl)-propane1,3-diol. linear polysaccharides based on a repeating disaccharide that usually consists of an amino sugar and a negatively charged sugar, are essential constituents of higher animals. Hyaluronan (HA), heparin, and chondroitan, dermatan, and keratan sulfates are members of this class of carbohydrates. HA (→4)-β-d-GlcA(1→3)-β-d-GlcNAc(1→) is a prominent GAG that plays roles as a structural element and a recognition molecule in vertebrates (1Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Google Scholar). The enzymes that catalyze the production of HA, the HA synthases, were the first glycosyltransferases capable of forming the disaccharide repeat of a GAG to be cloned and described at the molecular level. The initial HA synthase to be identified was HasA of Streptococcus pyogenes which is the enzyme responsible for the formation of an extracellular capsule of HA in this human bacterial pathogen (2DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14568-14571Google Scholar, 3DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Google Scholar). The HasA protein is strongly associated with the phospholipid membrane and is predicted to possess 4 or 5 membrane-spanning segments (3DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Google Scholar, 4DeAngelis P.L. Yang N. Weigel P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1-10Google Scholar). The enzyme utilizes UDP-GlcA and UDP-GlcNAc precursors found in the cytosol and extrudes the growing HA chain out of the cell during polymerization. HasA, a single protein, transfers both GlcA and GlcNAc residues to HA based on genetic and biochemical evidence (3DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Google Scholar, 5DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9033-9039Google Scholar). A Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog) protein, DG42 (fordifferentially expressed in gastrulation), with a previously unknown function (6Rosa F. Sargent T.D. Rebbert M.L. Michaels G.S. Jamrich M. Grunz H. Jonas E. Winkles J.A. Dawid I.B. Dev. Biol. 1988; 129: 114-123Google Scholar) was found to be quite similar at the amino acid sequence level to the bacterial HasA enzyme (3DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Google Scholar, 4DeAngelis P.L. Yang N. Weigel P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1-10Google Scholar) as well as fungal chitin synthases (7Atkinson E.M. Long S.R. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1992; 5: 439-442Google Scholar). These observations led to the hypothesis that this vertebrate protein was also a HA synthase (4DeAngelis P.L. Yang N. Weigel P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1-10Google Scholar, 7Atkinson E.M. Long S.R. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1992; 5: 439-442Google Scholar). DG42 contains predicted transmembrane segments clustered at both the amino and carboxyl termini; this positioning is similar to that of the membrane-associated regions found in HasA (4DeAngelis P.L. Yang N. Weigel P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1-10Google Scholar). DG42 was subsequently shown to be involved in HA biosynthesis by overexpression studies. Infection of mammalian cells with a recombinant vaccinia virus construct containing the DG42 cDNA directed these cells to produce more HA than the uninfected host cells alone or vector-infected cells (8Meyer M.F. Kreil G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4543-4547Google Scholar). Definitive proof that DG42 was a bona fide HA synthase was obtained through overexpression studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an eukaryotic host that doesnot normally make the HA polysaccharide. Yeast with the cloned DG42 cDNA on an expression plasmid produced a functional HA synthase (9DeAngelis P.L. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23657-23660Google Scholar). The recombinant enzyme transferred both GlcA and GlcNAc residues from UDP-sugar nucleotide donors to form a high molecular weight polymer. This material was degraded by the specific HA lyase from Streptomyces (9DeAngelis P.L. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23657-23660Google Scholar), an enzyme that does not digest any other GAG (10Ohya T. Kaneko Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 198: 607-609Google Scholar). The resulting fragments from the yeast-derived polymer were identical to those generated from authentic vertebrate HA as deemed by high performance liquid chromatography analysis (9DeAngelis P.L. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23657-23660Google Scholar). The HA synthase activity of the recombinant yeast was localized to the membrane fraction in agreement with both the predictions derived from the DG42 primary sequence and the previous characterizations of the HA synthase from mammalian sources. In 1996, at least four reports were made of mammalian homologs possessing ∼50% identity to the DG42 protein (11Itano N. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9875-9878Google Scholar, 12Spicer A.P. Augustine M.L. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23400-23406Google Scholar, 13Shyjan A.M. Heldin P. Butcher E.C. Yoshino T. Briskin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23395-23399Google Scholar, 14Watanabe K. Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22945-22948Google Scholar). Two of these reports utilized polymerase chain reaction and degenerate primers based on the hasA and DG42 sequences to obtain their clones (12Spicer A.P. Augustine M.L. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23400-23406Google Scholar, 14Watanabe K. Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22945-22948Google Scholar). The cDNAs corresponding to these homologs, when overexpressed on recombinant plasmids, substantially increased HA production of transfected mammalian cells in comparison to the host cells' basal levels. It appears that at least three putative hyaluronan synthases encoded by three separate but related genes, namedHAS1, HAS2, and HAS3, exist in human and mouse. 2A. P. Spicer, personal communication.2A. P. Spicer, personal communication. The Xenopus DG42 gene is most closely related to mammalian HAS1based upon conservation of exon/intron boundaries.2 In this report, we have characterized the requirements and kinetics of recombinant DG42 produced in yeast. All reagents were from Sigma unless noted otherwise. The construction and the use of the DG42 expression plasmid for studies in yeast were described by DeAngelis and Achyuthan (9DeAngelis P.L. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23657-23660Google Scholar). Briefly, the DG42 cDNA, encoding a polypeptide of 588 residues, was cloned into the pYES2 vector (Invitrogen) under control of the GAL1 promoter to form pYES/DG+. Upon induction with galactose, active DG42 accumulated in the plasma membrane fraction. Membranes were prepared by the same glass-bead disruption protocol except for three alterations: (i) the more soluble and stable protease inhibitor aminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride was substituted for phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride; (ii) the repeated freeze-thawing cycles were omitted; and (iii) some preparations were lysed utilizing a MiniBeadbeater-8 (Biospec). Preparations with about 10-fold higher specific activity than our previous report were obtained when all of these modifications were utilized. Protein was quantitated by the Coomassie dye-binding assay (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) with a bovine serum albumin standard (Pierce). A DNA fragment encoding the open reading frame of 419 residues corresponding to streptococcal HasA (original Val codon switched to Met; Ref. 3DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Google Scholar) was also subcloned by standard methods into the pYES2 yeast expression vector to produce pYES/HA. Membranes from cells with this construct were prepared in the same fashion as pYES/DG+. The samples derived from pYES/HA constructs contained substantial HA synthase activity and a unique 42-kDa protein could be detected on Western blots with antibodies against HasA; membranes from cells with vector alone possessed neither activity nor the immunoreactive band (not shown). The incorporation of sugars into high molecular weight HA polysaccharide was monitored using UDP-[14C]GlcA (291 mCi/mmol; ICN) and/or UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (27.3 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products Inc.) precursors as described previously (9DeAngelis P.L. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23657-23660Google Scholar). For determining optimal reaction conditions, the membrane preparations were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h, unless noted otherwise, in a buffer typically containing: 50 mm buffer ion, 0–30 mm divalent metal ion, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0–150 μm UDP-GlcA, and 0–300 μm UDP-GlcNAc. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS to 2% (w/v). Descending paper chromatography (65:35, ethanol, 1 mammonium acetate, pH 5.5) was utilized to separate products from substrates; the radioactive polymers at the origin of the paper chromatogram were detected by liquid scintillation counting. Assays for characterization of the kinetic optima of DG42 were set so that <5% of the radiolabeled substrate was consumed and the enzyme concentration was in the linear range. For determining the temperature dependence of DG42 activity, 360 μm UDP-GlcA and 1 mm UDP-GlcNAc were employed in 30-min assays to obtain maximal velocity measurements. For the sugar nucleotide specificity studies, one of the authentic HA precursors was substituted with a closely related structural analog.Km values for the substrates were obtained by holding one radiolabeled UDP-sugar at a constant and saturating concentration while titrating the other UDP-sugar. The data were analyzed by graphing on Hanes-Woolf plots. Membranes (385 μg of protein) were incubated with 400 μmUDP-[14C]GlcA (1 μCi) and 900 μmunlabeled UDP-GlcNAc in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT (550 μl reaction volume) at 30 °C and samples (100 μl) of the reaction mixture were withdrawn at various times. The synthase was inactivated by the addition of SDS to 0.5% and the samples were deproteinized by Pronase® treatment (0.5 mg/ml final, overnight at 37 °C; Boehringer Mannheim). A parallel study with membranes containing yeast-derived recombinant HasA was performed as above except that the buffer was pH 7.0. The unincorporated precursors and small molecules (≤3 × 103 Da) were removed by ultrafiltration (3 buffer changes with a Microcon® 3 unit; Amicon). After clarification by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 5 min), one-third of the sample was injected onto a Sephacryl S-500HR gel filtration column (Pharmacia: 1 × 51 cm, 40 ml) equilibrated in 0.2 mNaCl, 5 mm Tris, pH 8. The column was eluted at 0.5 ml/min and radioactivity in the fractions (1 ml) was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting after adding EconoSafe mixture (4.5 ml, Research Products Int.). The Mr of the HA chains was calculated using the linear relationship of the Kav to log Mr(Kav = (Ve −Vo)/(Vt −Vo), where Ve is elution volume;Vo is void volume; and Vt is the total column volume) (16Determan H. Gel Chromatography. Springer-Verlag, Inc., New York1968Google Scholar). The column was calibrated with blue dextran 2000 (Pharmacia, average ∼2 × 106 Da), the only available carbohydrate standard that elutes in the linear range of the column. The size of dextran molecules excluded from Sephacryl S-500HR beads was estimated by the manufacturer (using defined microsphere standards and extrapolation) to be ∼2 × 107 Da. Even if the excluded size was actually 1.5 × 107 Da, however, our polymerization rates would be only 10% lower because the HA peaks used for the rate determinations eluted with midrange or higher Kav values. We found that the transport and the availability of sugar nucleotides across the phospholipid membranes were not the rate-limiting steps with our yeast preparations. Similar HA polymerization experiments using treatments that permeabilize lipid vesicles (preincubation with 0.05% (w/v) digitonin (final) or a pore-forming protein, perfringolysin O (1 μg/150 μg of membrane protein; generously provided by R. Tweten, University of Oklahoma)) did not alter the chromatography profiles from experiments using untreated membranes (data not shown). The DG42 enzyme in membranes was assayed under various conditions to determine the optimal pH, metal ion concentration, and ionic strength for HA polymerization. The enzyme displayed a pH optima around neutrality and the highest activities were observed in Tris-based buffers at pH 7.6 to 8.1 (Fig. 1). The synthase retained ∼80% of maximal activity from pH 7.0 to 8.4. The enzyme activity was linear for at least 2 h at pH 7.6 (data not shown). The enzyme did not perform as well in phosphate buffer; in this case, the phosphate ion probably chelates a substantial proportion of the required Mg2+ ion (data not shown). We explored the possibility that metal ions other than Mg2+could substitute as a cofactor for HA polymerization using reactions buffered at pH of 7.6. No other metal ion, including Mn2+, Co2+, Cu2+, or Ni2+, was as effective as Mg2+ (Fig. 2). No more than 13 or 23% of the incorporation observed for 20 mm Mg2+ was detected when Ni2+ or Mn2+, respectively, were substituted at the same concentration. The dependence of HA polymerization on ionic strength was measured by addition of NaCl to reactions at pH 7.6 containing 20 mmMg2+ (data not shown). The Tris buffer and Mg2+alone contribute an ionic strength of 0.11 molal. The activity remained fairly constant up to ∼0.4 molal. At higher ionic strengths, the activity gradually diminished and reached 15% of the maximal activity at 1.3 molal. DG42 was assayed at various temperatures from 0 °C to 70 °C with limiting enzyme (Fig. 3). The enzyme was not active when assayed at ≤4 °C. DG42 exhibited a roughly linear response with respect to temperature from 30 °C to 42 °C. The activity at 42 °C was twice as great as that measured at 30 °C. At 50 °C, only ∼20% of maximal activity was observed, and DG42 was completely inactive when assayed at 75 °C. The initial velocity data from reactions at 30 °C to 42 °C were plotted versus the reciprocal of temperature on an Arrhenius plot (not shown). The slope yielded a value of ∼15 kcal/mol for the apparent energy of activation, Ea, for the glycosyltransferase reactions. The Km of DG42 for the substrates UDP-GlcA and UDP-GlcNAc was determined by measuring synthase activity as a function of UDP-sugar concentration. We obtainedKm values of 60 ± 20 and 235 ± 40 μm for UDP-GlcA and UDP-GlcNAc, respectively (Figs.4 and5).Figure 5Hanes-Woolf plot estimation of Km for UDP-sugars precursors of DG42. The specific incorporation data used to generate Fig. 4, A(UDP-GlcNAc, ▪) and B (UDP-GlcA, •), were graphed as [S]/v versus [S]. The x axis intercept, which signifies −Km, yielded the Kmvalues of 235 ± 40 and 60 ± 20 μm for UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcA, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We examined if UDP-sugars other than UDP-GlcA and UDP-GlcNAc, the natural HA precursors, could be polymerized by DG42 (Table I). The galactose analogs, UDP-GalA and UDP-GalNAc, which are C-4 epimers of the normal substrates, could not substitute. UDP-Glc, without the C-6 carboxyl or the C-2 deoxy acetamido group of UDP-GlcA and UDP-GlcNAc, respectively, could not be polymerized in place of the natural substrates. In addition to measuring radioactivity at the origin of the paper chromatograms, where high molecular weight HA is typically found, samples were also taken at positions between the origin and the peak of the unincorporated precursors. No difference in the level of radioactivity was observed among any of the assays with various precursors. This finding suggests that no appreciable amounts of smaller polymer chains (e.g.3–6 sugars), which could possibly migrate away from the origin in our solvent system, were formed with the tested unnatural precursors.Table ISugar nucleotide specificity of recombinant DG42 hyaluronan synthaseSecond sugar nucleotide present[14C]GlcA dpm[3H]GlcNAc dpm%None90 (0.3)3501-aThe small amount of radioactive material at the origin in this reaction was chitin polysaccharide produced by the endogenous chitin synthase activity; the material was susceptible to degradation by chitinase 63 (provided by P.

Open table in a new tab We estimated the average HA polymerization rate by incubating the HASs in reactions with saturating concentrations of precursors (as determined in the Km studies) for defined times and determining the HA product size by gel filtration. Only data from early time points was utilized to assure that a single round of HA elongation was being observed. The rate was calculated by dividing the average chain length of the polymer peak by the duration of the HAS reaction. Recombinant yeast-derived DG42 enzyme is particularly useful in these experiments because there are no endogenous HA chains on the freshly isolated enzyme; S. cerevisiae does not produce UDP-GlcA, which is a required precursor of HA (9DeAngelis P.L. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23657-23660Google Scholar). This is in contrast to HA synthases isolated from vertebrate cells which contain partially formed or completed HA chains. High molecular weight HA of 2–4 ×106Da was formed by DG42 within 2.5 min (Fig. 6 A), corresponding to an average polymerization rate of 110 ± 30 monosaccharides/s. After 5 min, DG42 produced molecules of at least 3–7 × 106Da which corresponds to an average rate of 80 ± 30 monosaccharides/s. The peak of radiolabeled HA gradually increased in both molecular weight and amplitude over time. Using the data in the central portion of the HA peak after a 45-min reaction (∼50% of the total incorporation was in these fractions), we estimate that the average molecular weight of the final product of DG42 is about 9 ± 3 × 106 Da. However, some chains (∼20% of total) are ≥2 × 107 Da since they eluted in the void volume of the Sephacryl S-500 column (Fig. 6 C). In parallel experiments, streptococcal HasA produced material at an average rate of 60 ± 20 monosaccharides/min, which is almost as rapid as DG42 (Fig. 6 B), but the final product had a higher average molecular weight (≥2 × 107 Da; Fig. 6 C). Before the advent of the recombinant enzymes, several groups had studied the native HA synthase(s) derived from various vertebrate cell lines. The enzymes' requirements and Km for the UDP-sugar substrates were measured (17Ishimoto N. Temin H.M. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2052-2057Google Scholar, 18Appel A. Horwitz A.L.

There were potential complications with these studies because (i) multiple HA synthase isozymes exist, and (ii) the enzymes isolated from mammalian cells possess partially elongated nascent chains and/or completed HA chains. We have utilized the yeast expression system to circumvent these pitfalls. First, since yeast do not normally make HA, the activity of a cloned synthase can be analyzed without the contributions of other endogenous HA synthases that are found in the mammalian systems. Second, yeast is a host which does not form the required UDP-GlcA precursor of HA in vivo, therefore the recombinant enzyme produced in this system cannot make a HA chain until the precursor is added to the isolated membrane preparations. This feature facilitates analysis of HA biosynthesis since all polymerization occurs de novo. In particular, the controversy surrounding the direction of HA polymer growth may be answered in the near future utilizing the yeast system. Most other known carbohydrates are synthesized by the addition of the new saccharide residue from an activated sugar nucleotide to the nonreducing end of the nascent chain. In contrast, the current model advocated by Prehm (22Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 181-189Google Scholar, 23Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 191-198Google Scholar) is that HA is polymerized by transfer of sugars to the reducing end of the molecule. One line of evidence that led to this hypothesis was that the nascent HA polymers synthesized by mammalian cell membranes apparently contain a covalently attached UDP moiety (23Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 191-198Google Scholar). All of the HA synthases described to date, from Gram-positiveStreptococcus and Gram-negative Pasteurellabacteria and from vertebrates, including Xenopus, utilize UDP-sugar nucleotide precursors at neutral pH (9DeAngelis P.L. Achyuthan A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23657-23660Google Scholar, 17Ishimoto N. Temin H.M. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2052-2057Google Scholar, 18Appel A. Horwitz A.L. Dorfman A. J.

Chem. 1959; 234: 2343-2350Google Scholar, 25DeAngelis P.L. Biochem. 1996; 35: 9768-9771Google Scholar). These HA synthases require a divalent metal ion to function, but the enzymes display different preferences in vitro. Mg2+ supports the highest efficiency polymerization of HA for all enzymes tested to date, except for Pasteurellaenzyme for which 1 mm Mn2+ serves ∼2-fold better than 10 mm Mg2+ (25DeAngelis P.L. Biochem. 1996; 35: 9768-9771Google Scholar). The temperature dependence of HA synthase activity of DG42 suggests that the apparent Ea, the energy of activation for elongating HA, is ∼15 kcal/mol. This value is similar to that observed for a wide spectrum of other biosynthetic enzymes. If the transfer of one of the sugar groups, either GlcA or GlcNAc, to the HA chain had a greater energy barrier, then our calculated apparentEa value would be a reflection of the reaction with the higher activation energy. However, the GlcA and GlcNAc groups are both transferred by a UDP donor and both of the resulting glycosidic bonds are β-linked. Therefore, the actual Eavalues may be very similar for both reactions catalyzed by HAS. To make the proper assumptions concerning the similarities in reactive encounters or transition states during catalysis, it would be useful to know if the HASs possess (i) a common binding site that interacts with both UDP-sugars or (ii) two distinct binding sites for UDP-GlcA and UDP-GlcNAc. DG42 displays a greater affinity for the UDP-GlcA precursor than UDP-GlcNAc, a characteristic of all other known HA synthases. We found that the Km values of recombinant DG42 in yeast for the precursors were higher but quite similar in magnitude to values (UDP-GlcA, 3–50 μm; UDP-GlcNAc, 21–100 μm) reported by others for the membrane-associated enzyme derived from adult human, murine, or chicken cells (17Ishimoto N. Temin H.M. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2052-2057Google Scholar, 18Appel A. Horwitz A.L. Dorfman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12199-12203Google Scholar, 19Philipson L.H. Schwartz N.B. J.

Int. 1995; 35: 1123-1132Google Scholar). The variance in Km values may be due to the intrinsic characteristics among the different HA synthase isozymes, but further analysis will be required to resolve if this disparity is just a matter of different source species, purification protocols, or assay methods. Yeast-derived DG42 exhibited exquisite specificity for the authentic sugar nucleotide precursors of the HA polysaccharide. The galactose epimers and UDP-Glc could not substitute for UDP-GlcA and UDP-GlcNAc. Similarly, streptococcal HasA only incorporated the authentic precursors into polymer (5DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9033-9039Google Scholar). This selectivity suggests that the enzyme needs to make several critical contacts with the substrates, including the substituents at C-2 and C-4 of GlcNAc, and the substituents at C-4 and C-6 of GlcA. We estimated the average rates of HA polymerization by measuring the length of the HA chains produced in vitro by gel filtration and then dividing the average size by the reaction time. Our method of calculating the product size is limited by several factors: (i) the experimental difficulty in separating polymers in the 106-108 Da range with existing aqueous-based chromatography media; (ii) the relative lack of defined high molecular weight standards; and (iii) the intrinsic polydisperse nature of polysaccharides. To combat the imprecision of the gel filtration estimates of Mr, we used data from sequential reaction times and calculated the size across the median fractions of the HA peak. We presented conservative estimates of the polymerization rate based on the average size of the product molecules, but some of the HA chains are longer than the average value. Therefore, the enzyme may elongate HA at even higher rates. Our parallel studies indicate that both yeast-derived recombinant DG42 and HasA polymerize HA rapidly. Interestingly, comparison of the gel filtration profiles reveals that the ultimate size of the HA products from the two enzymes are different. DG42 produces HA polysaccharide with a smaller average size (6–12 × 106 Da) than that formed by HasA (≥2 × 107 Da). The HA size distribution produced by DG42, nonetheless, is comparable to high quality HA isolated from vertebrate tissues (1Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Google Scholar). Overall, the findings in this report substantiate yeast as a useful expression system for studies of HA synthases. Apparently no post-translational modifications unique to vertebrates, and absent in Saccharomyces, are required for correct enzymatic function of DG42, a putative HAS1-type vertebrate synthase. Furthermore, since yeast-derived HasA also functioned very well as a HA synthase, no other bacterial-specific components for HA synthesis are required; this is further evidence that one glycosyltransferase can indeed utilize two distinct substrates. It will be interesting to examine other vertebrate HA synthases to determine if the enzymological characteristics of a particular synthase isozyme customize its function in different tissues of the body and/or at various times during development. A comparison of the enzymology of the other GAG glycosyltransferases, yet to be molecularly cloned, to the HA synthases should also prove illuminating in a mechanistic as well as evolutionary sense. We thank Drs. Paul H. Weigel and Pierre Neuenschwander for helpful discussions. We also thank Dr. Andrew P. Spicer for sharing preliminary information concerning the multiple vertebrate HAS genes."

Lithostathine (pancreatic stone protein, PSP) or Reg protein is a 144-residue glycoprotein synthesized by the exocrine pancreas (1De Caro A.M. Bonicel J.J. Rouimi P. De Caro J.D. Sarles H. Rovery M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 201-207Google Scholar, 2De Reggi M. Calliope C. Gharib B. Wieruszeski J.M. Michel R. Fournet B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 503-510Google Scholar). It is also expressed in the endocrine compartment of the regenerating pancreas (3Terazono K. Yamamoto H. Takasawa S. Shiga K. Yonemura Y. Tochino Y. Okamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2111-2114Google Scholar, 4Watanabe T. Yonekura H. Terazono K. Yamamoto H. Okamoto H. J. Biol.

Cancer. 1992; 70: 1857-1863Google Scholar). The function of the protein is uncertain. It has been shown to stimulate islet regeneration in partially depancreatized rats (6Watanabe T. Yonemura Y. Yonekura H. Suzuki Y. Miyashita H. Sugiyama K. Moriizumi S. Unno M. Tanaka O. Kondo H. Bone A. Takasawa S. Okamoto H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3589-3592Google Scholar), and it is regarded by several authors as a β-cell growth factor implicated in the maintenance of β-cell mass and function (7Perfetti R. Egan J.M. Zenilman M.E. Shuldiner A.R. Transplant. Proc. 1994; 26: 733Google Scholar, 8Baeza N.J. Moriscot C. Figarella C. Guy-Crotte O. Vialettes B. Diabetes Metab. 1996; 22: 229-234Google Scholar, 9Moriscot C. Renaud W.

Reg protein may be involved also in cell proliferation and differentiation in nonpancreatic structures (12Fredj-Reygrobellet D. Hristova D. Balas D. Senegas-Balas F. Ophtalmic Res. 1996; 28: 130-136Google Scholar). The occurrence of lithostathine in the pancreatic juice has led to the suggestion that it may prevent stone formation by controlling nucleation, growth, and aggregation of calcite crystals. The two main arguments that have been developed to support this assumption are as follows. First, lithostathine has been shown to delay crystal nucleation and to inhibit growth of preformed CaCO3 from supersaturated solutions (13Bernard J.P Adrich Z. Montalto G. De Caro A. De Reggi M. Sarles H. Dagorn J.C Gastroenterology. 1992; 103: 1277-1284Google Scholar), and second, it acts as a calcite crystal habit modifier, leading to the formation of smaller crystals (14Geider S. Baronnet A. Cerini C. Nitsche S. Astier J.-P. Michel R. Boistelle R. Berland Y. Dagorn J.-C. Verdier J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26302-26306Google Scholar). This presumed physiological function has been challenged recently (15Bimmler D. Graf R. Scheele G.A. Frick T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3073-3082Google Scholar). At least three conditions must be met to demonstrate the presumed role of lithostathine: 1) Crystal nucleation and growth occur only under certain critical conditions; thus any interference, such as for example the uncontrolled presence of certain salts, will lead to false positive results. 2) A partially denatured protein may give rise to artifacts; therefore, the sample of lithostathine employed must have the correct three-dimensional structure. 3) It is essential that a “standard” protein, such as BSA, 1The abbreviation used is: BSA, bovine serum albumin. be employed as control. Because these conditions were not all met in the experiments cited earlier, we decided to reinvestigate the role of lithostathine using the approach of Ref. 13Bernard J.P Adrich Z. Montalto G. De Caro A. De Reggi M. Sarles H. Dagorn J.C Gastroenterology. 1992; 103: 1277-1284Google Scholar, with rigorous purification of the protein and with the checking of its folding (16Patard L. Stoven V. Gharib B. Bontems F. Lallemand J.Y. De Reggi M. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 949-957Google Scholar). We found that under these conditions lithostathine does not inhibit calcium carbonate precipitation and crystal growth. Moreover, we demonstrated that a slight contamination of the protein solution by the buffer used for immunopurification mimics the reported inhibitory effects of lithostathine. Because the inhibitory activity had been attributed to the N-terminal undecapeptide, we determined also the effects of this peptide, in both its glycosylated and nonglycosylated forms, as well as the effects of synthetic peptides of related sequence. We showed also that inorganic compounds in the pancreatic juice, such as NaCl and above all phosphate, are powerful inhibitors of calcium carbonate crystal growth. Lastly, we performed competitive adsorption experiments to determine the affinity of lithostathine to calcite crystals, as compared with an amorphous phase (glass), using BSA as a control. We concluded that lithostathine cannot be a specific inhibitor of pancreatic stone formation. In a critical examination of this phenomenon, lithostathine would instead appear as a promoter of stone formation through its 133-residue isoform (PSP-S1). Human pancreatic juice was collected by endoscopic cannulation of the main pancreatic duct of patients suffering from various pancreatic diseases. Collection of the pancreatic juice was part of the clinical routine. Lithostathine was immunopurified as described previously (2De Reggi M. Calliope C. Gharib B. Wieruszeski J.M. Michel R. Fournet B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 503-510Google Scholar). It was then concentrated on a cation exchange cartridge (MemSep SP, Millipore), which was eluted with pH 9.0, 50 mmborate buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl. The latter step had the advantage of completely removing the salts used in immunopurification, namely glycine/HCl buffer neutralized with Tris. For the isolation of the N-terminal peptide, the Arg11-Ile12 bond was cleaved by trypsin as described in Ref. 16Patard L. Stoven V. Gharib B. Bontems F. Lallemand J.Y. De Reggi M. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 949-957Google Scholar. The glycosylated N-terminal peptide was isolated from the resulting supernatant. The dry material was dissolved in 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid, and the solution was then loaded onto a 4.6 × 150 mm C18 column (Altex) equilibrated in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–60% methanol for 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The peptide eluted at 18 min. The eluate was partly evaporated under nitrogen and lyophilized. In addition, several peptides were synthesized (Neosystem). The natural and the synthetic peptides were quantified by amino acid analysis. The initiation of CaCO3 precipitation in vitro was examined as described in Ref. 17Okido M. Shimizu S. Ostrow J.D. Nakayama F. Hepathology. 1992; 15: 1079-1085Google Scholar. To 0.2 ml of a solution of lithostathine (10 mg/ml in 0.15 m NaCl), 10 ml of 25 mm sodium bicarbonate, pH 8.8, and 10 ml of 16 mm calcium chloride were added with gentle stirring at 25 °C. Calcium carbonate precipitation was monitored by the decrease in pH; 0.2 ml of 0.15m NaCl served as control. CaCO3 crystal growth was investigated according to Ref. 13Bernard J.P Adrich Z. Montalto G. De Caro A. De Reggi M. Sarles H. Dagorn J.C Gastroenterology. 1992; 103: 1277-1284Google Scholar. A metastable supersaturated CaCO3 solution containing 0.27 mm CaCl2 and 4.8 mmNaHCO3, adjusted to pH 8.8, was seeded with calcite crystals in the proportion of 1 mg of crystals for 4 ml of metastable solution. Seed crystals were prepared as described in Ref. 13Bernard J.P Adrich Z. Montalto G. De Caro A. De Reggi M. Sarles H. Dagorn J.C Gastroenterology. 1992; 103: 1277-1284Google Scholar; their mean linear size was 0.5 mm, with a specific surface area of 0.5 m2/g. The mixture was maintained at 25 °C with gentle stirring. The free calcium concentration decreased as Ca2+ions were incorporated into the crystals. Ca2+concentration changes were determined by colorimetric assay (Boehringer Mannheim) performed on aliquots, which were collected at 1, 2, 4, and 6 h after seeding (beyond that, the concentration remained stable for more than 24 h). The compounds to be tested were diluted in the metastable solution before crystal seeding. The concentrations mentioned in this report refer to the latter metastable solution. Lithostathine and its N-terminal undecapeptide were used at the highest concentration described in Ref. 13Bernard J.P Adrich Z. Montalto G. De Caro A. De Reggi M. Sarles H. Dagorn J.C Gastroenterology. 1992; 103: 1277-1284Google Scholar, i.e. 6 μm. BSA and synthetic peptides were at the same concentration by weight (100 μg/ml). The following peptides were used: The peptide lith-I had the same sequence as the N-terminal undecapeptide of human lithostathine,i.e. pEEAQTELPQAR. To determine the effect of the glutamic residues, we used the peptide lith-Is, which had the same sequence as lith-I, except that Glu was substituted by Gln,i.e. pEQAQTQLPQAR. The peptide lith-II had the same sequence as the N-terminal undecapeptide of human lithostathine II, product of the regl gene (18Bartoli C. Gharib B. Giorgi D. Sansonetti A. Dagorn J.C. Bergé-Lefranc J.L. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 289-293Google Scholar), i.e.QESQTELPNPR. The peptide rat had the same sequence as the N-terminal undecapeptide of rat lithostathine, i.e.pEEAEEDLPSAR (19Rouquier S. Verdier J.M. Iovanna J. Dagorn J.C. Giorgi D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 786-791Google Scholar). All synthetic peptides were provided by Neosystem (Strasbourg, France) In all experiments described in the present report, assays were done at least in quadruplicate. The inhibitory activity of the various substances tested, in the experiments described above and in the following, was analyzed as follows: the Ca2+ concentrations reached at the end of the assays, i.e. after 6 h, were compared using Student'st test. For the study of lithostathine binding to calcite crystals, regression analysis was performed according to Ref. 21Sokal R.R. Rohlf J.F. Biometry. Freeman, New York1981: 454-460Google Scholar. The protein used in Ref. 13Bernard J.P Adrich Z. Montalto G. De Caro A. De Reggi M. Sarles H. Dagorn J.C Gastroenterology. 1992; 103: 1277-1284Google Scholar was prepared according to Ref.20Montalto G. Bonicel J. Multigner L. Rovery M. Sarles H. De Caro A. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 227-232Google Scholar. The protocol includes an elution step using 0.2 mglycine buffer, pH 2.8. The solution was then neutralized with 10% of 1 m Tris, pH 8.9, and dialyzed overnight against phosphate-buffered saline. Here is a potential source of artifact, because the phosphate buffer used contains 10 mmPO42− i.e. 10 times the concentration required for the complete inhibition of Ca2+incorporation into crystals (see “Results”). In addition, because dialysis is unlikely to be 100% effective, the final lithostathine solution would contain residual glycine/Tris buffer. The critical aspect of this experiment is that the amount of phosphate and glycine/Tris introduced into the inhibition assay would parallel the amount of protein (increasing lithostathine concentrations were obtained by adding to a given volume of metastable solution increasing volumes of a stock solution of lithostathine). For this reason, we checked the possible inhibition of calcium crystal growth by glycine/Tris at a final concentration ranging from 0.125 to 1 mm, i.e. 0.5% or less of the buffer used in the immunopurification process. Moreover, we determined the effects of some components of the pancreatic juice, either inorganic compounds or proteins, namely 0.15 m NaCl, 50 μm sodium phosphate, 6 μm trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen. To determine the relevancy of inorganic phosphate and 6 μmas a potential inhibitor of pancreatic stone formation, we measured the physiological phosphate levels in 10 samples of human pancreatic juice (basal secretion) using the kit provided by Boehringer Mannheim. Lithostathine and BSA were equilibrated in metastable CaCO3 solution (pH 8.8, 0.27 μmCaCl2 and 4.8 mm NaHCO3) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. 500 μg of protein were iodinated with 2 MBq of [125I]iodine in the presence of 10 μg of Iodogen (Pierce). Proteins were then desalted on PD10 columns (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The specific radioactivity of lithostathine and BSA were 3.5 and 3.1 KBq/μg, respectively. 500 μl of a metastable solution containing 62.5 μg of iodinated lithostathine or BSA, respectively, were incubated for 2 h with 5 mg of calcite crystals. Iodinated lithostathine was also incubated with an equivalent amount of glass microspheres, i.e. an amount that bound the same quantity of radioactivity. The solution was then centrifuged (2,000 × g for 1 min), and the pelleted crystals or microspheres were rinsed twice with 2.5 ml of metastable solution. They were then incubated with 2.5 ml of unlabeled protein solution equilibrated in metastable buffer, according to the data in Table I. The solution was periodically renewed, and the radioactivity of the collected supernatants was measured. All incubations were performed with gentle shaking. The concentration of unlabeled lithostathine was equal to 6 μm; unlabeled BSA was used at the same concentration by weight (i.e. 100 μg/ml or 1.5 μm).Table IRelease of iodinated protein (lithostathine or BSA) adsorbed to calcite crystal, in the presence of unlabelled lithostathine or BSASolid phaseExperimentsa: crystalsb: crystalsc: glassd: glasse: crystalsIodinated proteinBSALithoLithoLithoLithoTotal bound (ng · cm−2)220180NDND190Unlabelled competitorBSALithoLithoBSABSAFcomp645.7155.3154.3195.3653.7F0.055.115.115.995.995.11Half-life (h)11.28.88.07.46.495% limits11.6–10.89.6–8.28.7–7.48.0–6.96.6–6.1 Open table in a new tab Fig. 1 shows the decrease in free Ca2+ ions, resulting from Ca2+incorporation into calcite crystals. Ca2+ concentration dropped from 270 nm to about 70 nm in 2 h, and then it stabilized at about 50 nm after 6 h. Adding carefully purified native human lithostathine did not significantly modify the phenomenon: the Ca2+ concentration reached at the end of the assay did not differ significantly from one experiment to another (p ≫ 0.05). A similar result was obtained when the isolated N-terminal undecapeptide of lithostathine was added to the metastable solution; the same was true with BSA. All compounds were at 6 μm in the final metastable solution,i.e. the concentration used by previous workers (13Bernard J.P Adrich Z. Montalto G. De Caro A. De Reggi M. Sarles H. Dagorn J.C Gastroenterology. 1992; 103: 1277-1284Google Scholar). The figure shows also a nucleation experiment, where the pH of the solution decreases as a consequence of CaCO3 precipitation. Again, unlike in previous reports, lithostathine had no effect on the reaction. Following Ref. 13Bernard J.P Adrich Z. Montalto G. De Caro A. De Reggi M. Sarles H. Dagorn J.C Gastroenterology. 1992; 103: 1277-1284Google Scholar, we checked the effect of the synthetic peptide named lith-I, which reproduces the N-terminal sequence of lithostathine. It did not reduce the rate of Ca2+ incorporation into calcite crystals when used at 6 μm (Fig. 2, fcompared with g). This observation is consistent with the fact that considering its amino acid chain, one can predict that the peptide is unlikely to display an organized three-dimensional structure. However, the peptide showed a marked effect, provided it is used at a much higher concentration, i.e. 80 μm (about 100 μg/ml) (Fig. 2 b). Other synthetic peptides with related sequences were also checked for their potential inhibitory effectiveness. The peptide rat, derived from the N-terminal region of rat lithostathine, had the same effect as peptide lith-I when used at the same concentration (Fig. 2 a). Glutamic residues were involved in this activity because free glutamic acid, when used at a concentration equivalent to its occurrence in peptide lith-I (160 μm), displayed some inhibitory effect (Fig. 2 e). However, glutamic acid itself is not sufficient, because the reduction of the Ca2+ incorporation into crystals was partially, but not totally, abolished when the glutamic residues of peptidelith-I were substituted by glutamine (peptidelith-Is) (Fig. 2, d compared with b). Moreover peptide lith-II, derived from human lithostathine II, with the same glutamic acid equivalent as lith-I but with a slightly different sequence, had a significantly reduced inhibitory activity (Fig. 2, c compared with b). These findings indicate that a number of different compounds can reduce the rate of Ca2+ incorporation into calcium carbonate crystals. Electrostatic interactions via glutamic acid are presumably involved, and synergy of action with the peptide fragment is probable. Fig. 3 shows that the inhibitory activity attributed to immunopurified lithostathine might reflect the effect of traces of the glycine/Tris buffer used in the purification procedure. Minute amounts of the buffer added to the test solution (final concentrations as low as 0.05–0.6% of that of the initial buffer) led to an inhibition that mimicked that previously found with lithostathine. The Ca2+ concentration reached at the end of the assay (after 6 h) differed significantly from one experiment to another, i.e. with increasing glycine/Tris concentration. The figure shows also that NaCl at a physiological level had a strong inhibitory effect, and 50 μm phosphate totally inhibited the growth of calcium crystals (higher phosphate concentrations gradually disaggregated the crystals; data not shown). To determine the physiological relevance of the latter finding, we measured the phosphate levels in 10 human pancreatic juice samples (basal secretion). The concentration was 95.8 ± 18.6 μm, with a 77–150 μm range; one sample, however, markedly differed from the others, displaying only 14 μm, and it was excluded from the calculation of the mean. Thus, according to our analysis, phosphate levels in pancreatic juice are usually higher than 50 μm, a concentration that has been shown above to totally inhibit calcium crystal growth in vitro. We determined also the inhibitory activity of 6 μmtryspsinogen and chymotrypsinogen. The inhibition, expressed as the difference in free Ca2+ concentration in test experiments versus the control shown in Fig. 3, was 30.8 and 18.8%, respectively. To gain further insight into the interaction of lithostathine with calcite crystals, we determined the kinetics of the binding of lithostathine to the crystals, using iodinated protein and unlabeled competitors. As control, we used on the one hand a protein frequently employed for this purpose, BSA, and on the other hand glass microspheres as the amorphous solid phase. Quantitatively, binding of either lithostathine or BSA to calcite crystals, expressed as weight of the protein per surface area, was similar i.e. about 200 ng·cm−2, despite the large difference in the molecular weights of the two proteins (Table I). Kinetic analysis showed that bound iodinated proteins were released by their unlabeled counterparts. The rate of release fitted a linear regression on a semi-logarithmic scale, as shown by the coefficient of determination: the nul hypothesisH0 β = 0 was rejected for all the experiments. The comparison of the slope of the regression lines at the p = 0.05 threshold showed that three experiments did not differ significantly from each other (Table I and Fig. 4). We can deduce that the half-life on the calcite crystals was significantly greater for BSA than for lithostathine (11.2 and 8.8 h, respectively); therefore we can assume that BSA has a higher affinity for the crystals (Table I, experiments a and b). In agreement, free BSA released bound lithostathine, with the half-life of lithostathine being reduced significantly to 6.4 h (p = 0.001) (Table I, experiments b and e). Another important aspect was the finding that the half-life of lithostathine on glass microspheres (8.0 h) was not significantly different from that on crystals; this means that lithostathine binds to calcite crystals in the same way as to glass (Table I, experiments b and c). Our investigations showed that lithostathine does not inhibit the in vitro incorporation of Ca2+ into CaCO3 crystals, even at 6 μm (about 100 μg/ml), the highest concentration employed by other workers (13Bernard J.P Adrich Z. Montalto G. De Caro A. De Reggi M. Sarles H. Dagorn J.C Gastroenterology. 1992; 103: 1277-1284Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect described by Bernard et al. (13Bernard J.P Adrich Z. Montalto G. De Caro A. De Reggi M. Sarles H. Dagorn J.C Gastroenterology. 1992; 103: 1277-1284Google Scholar) was probably due to the presence, in the lithostathine preparation employed, of contaminants such as PO42−and Tris-neutralized glycine buffer. Phosphate was introduced by dialysis of the protein solution against phosphate-buffered saline. We stress that according to the method used (20Montalto G. Bonicel J. Multigner L. Rovery M. Sarles H. De Caro A. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 227-232Google Scholar), the PO42− concentration in the stock solution of lithostathine was 10 times the level required for complete inhibition of Ca2+ incorporation into calcite crystals. Glycine/Tris was used to immunopurify the protein, and it was hardly totally removed by the dialysis procedure: we showed that increasingly minute amounts (less than 0.5% of the initial concentration) of Tris/glycine can reproduce the inhibition graphs attributed to lithostathine. We stress that specific protein-crystal interactions require a correct folding of the protein; improper folding may lead to nonspecific interactions, with potentially irrelevant effects. For this reason, the three-dimensional structure of our lithostathine preparation, isolated from human pancreatic juice, has been investigated by high resolution NMR spectroscopy (16Patard L. Stoven V. Gharib B. Bontems F. Lallemand J.Y. De Reggi M. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 949-957Google Scholar). The protein appeared to be properly folded, because the secondary structure elements assigned by NMR were in agreement with those present in the three-dimensional organization obtained by x-ray diffraction (22Bertrand J.A. Pignol D. Bernard J.P. Verdier J.M. Dagorn J.C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2678-2684Google Scholar). In apparent contradiction with some of our findings, “measurable calcite crystal inhibitory activity” was observed recently with a rat lithostathine produced in a baculovirus expression system (15Bimmler D. Graf R. Scheele G.A. Frick T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3073-3082Google Scholar). We have no explanation for the discrepancy. However, the latter protein preparation was stabilized by protease inhibitors. This indicates that contaminants, such as proteases, may be present, because we observed that lithostathine is stable when completely purified (our preparation did not need any stabilizing agent). Knowing the inhibitory effect of trypsinogen, no definitive conclusion should be drawn before the protein produced by genetic engineering has been demonstrated to be devoid of trace contaminants, especially proteases, and its three-dimensional structure has been checked. We showed also that the undecapeptide derived from the N-terminal region of lithostathine inhibits Ca2+ incorporation into CaCO3 crystals, however only at a concentration equivalent to about 1 mg/ml of lithostathine, i.e. at a physiologically irrelevant level. Similar results were obtained with the N-terminal undecapeptide from rat lithostathine; substituted peptides had intermediate effects, indicating that no change in the peptide sequence has a determinant effect on the rate of Ca2+ incorporation into calcium crystals. A number of pancreatic juice constituents can also prevent Ca2+ binding, especially NaCl at a physiological level and, among the proteins, trypsinogen. Moreover, special attention should be drawn to phosphate, because of its well known potency as an inhibitor of calcite precipitation (23Bachra B.N. Trautz O.R. Simon S.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1963; 103: 124-138Google Scholar, 24Hay D.I. Schluckebier S.K. Moreno E.C. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1986; 39: 151-160Google Scholar). Our assays show that generally the phosphate level in normal pancreatic juice may suffice per se to inhibit calcium carbonate precipitation. According to Ref. 23Bachra B.N. Trautz O.R. Simon S.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1963; 103: 124-138Google Scholar, calcium carbonate precipitation cannot occur in biological fluids, unless the phosphate to carbonate ratio decreases because of physiological or pathological changes in cellular activity. This aspect of lithogenesis control has not yet received the attention it deserves. In addition to this, our findings show that the adsorption of lithostathine to calcite crystals was similar to that of albumin. Under the conditions of our test, the concentration of both proteins at the crystal surface was about 200 ng·cm−2. This means that binding is a function of total protein mass rather than molecular concentration. Lithostathine bound to calcite crystals was released more effectively by BSA than by lithostathine itself. This means that BSA adheres to crystal surface with higher affinity than lithostathine. Thus, lithostathine is unlikely to act on crystal growth in a way different from albumin, which is present in the pancreatic juice at a mean concentration of 600 μg/ml (25Geigy Scientific Tables (1985) pp. 662–664, Ciba-Geigy, Basel.Google Scholar). As a comparison, lithostathine occurs at 25–60 μg/ml (26Bernard J.P. Barthet M. Gharib B. Michel R. Lilova A. Sahel J Dagorn J.C. De Reggi M. Gut. 1995; 36: 630-636Google Scholar); according to Ref. 27Mariani A. Mezzi G. Malesci A. Gut. 1995; 36: 622-629Google Scholar, the highest value attained is 137 μg/ml. Moreover, the binding of lithostathine to an amorphous phase such as glass microspheres and its rate of release therefrom is comparable with what is observed with calcite crystals. It has been shown that lithostathine alters crystal growth by interfering with the apposition of new layers of calcite (14Geider S. Baronnet A. Cerini C. Nitsche S. Astier J.-P. Michel R. Boistelle R. Berland Y. Dagorn J.-C. Verdier J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26302-26306Google Scholar). However, the same general loss of well defined crystal edges and shapes was observed with plasma fibronectin, which shows high nonspecific affinity for the {104} faces of calcite; again, the result is the reduction of average crystal size, even at a much lower protein concentration (28Hanein D. Geiger B. Addadi L. Langmuir. 1993; 9: 1058-1065Google Scholar). Hanein et al. (28Hanein D. Geiger B. Addadi L. Langmuir. 1993; 9: 1058-1065Google Scholar) state that they have reason to believe that this result may be applicable to a variety of globular proteins. One may expect, from our adsorption experiments, that the reduction in crystal size by globular proteins may also apply to albumin. In conclusion, not only does lithostathine not inhibit Ca2+incorporation into calcium carbonate crystals, but also no relevant specific function can be attributed to it with respect to the control of lithogenesis. In the light of these findings, the role postulated for lithostathine in the development of stones during the course of chronic calcifying pancreatitis should be re-evaluated. We underline that the onset of chronic pancreatitis is marked by precipitation of protein plugs in the pancreatic ducts; proteinaceous calculi later calcify (29Sarles H. Gastroenterology. 1974; 66: 604-616Google Scholar), as confirmed by successive examination of patients (30Sarles H. Bull. Acad. Natle Méd. 1992; 176: 153-162Google Scholar). These calculi are made mainly of PSP-S1, the 133-residue isoform of lithostathine. PSP-S1, which is generally present in the pancreatic juice (2De Reggi M. Calliope C. Gharib B. Wieruszeski J.M. Michel R. Fournet B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 503-510Google Scholar), tends to precipitate because it is insoluble at the physiological pH. As a result, PSP-S1 is the major component of the organic matrix of pancreatic stones and was first isolated from these structures (31De Caro A. Lohse J. Sarles H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 87: 1176-1182Google Scholar). In this sense, lithostathine can actually promote stone formation. In apparent contradiction with this assumption, it has been shown that patients at risk with chronic calcifying pancreatitis display reduced levels of pancreatic lithostathine (26Bernard J.P. Barthet M. Gharib B. Michel R. Lilova A. Sahel J Dagorn J.C. De Reggi M. Gut. 1995; 36: 630-636Google Scholar, 27Mariani A. Mezzi G. Malesci A. Gut. 1995; 36: 622-629Google Scholar). We should consider, however, that these patients may have higher levels of altered lithostathine isoforms, which are likely to be ignored by the assays used, based on chromatographic methods. In addition, it should be underlined that patients at risk with chronic calcifying pancreatitis include users of alcohol and that the calcification of proteinaceous calculi is known to be stimulated by alcohol abuse (30Sarles H. Bull. Acad. Natle Méd. 1992; 176: 153-162Google Scholar). In conclusion, in agreement with Ref. 15Bimmler D. Graf R. Scheele G.A. Frick T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3073-3082Google Scholar, the name “lithostathine” is inappropriate, and the function(s) of the protein remain(s) to be elucidated. We are indebted to Michel Delaage and Howard Rickenberg (Immunotech SA, Marseille, France) for useful comments and criticisms and to Christiane de Reggi (Université Joseph Fourier, Grenoble, France) for help with statistical analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1998247221,"To explore the domain interactions that are required for catalytic activity of the multifunctional, homodimeric fatty acid synthase (FAS), we have formulated a strategy that allows isolation of modified dimers containing independently mutated subunits. Either a hexahistidine or a FLAG octapeptide tag was incorporated into the FAS at either the amino terminus, within an internal noncatalytic domain, or at the carboxyl terminus. The presence of the tags had no effect on the activity of the wild-type FAS. His-tagged dimers were mixed with FLAG-tagged dimers, and the subunits were randomized to produce a mixture of His-tagged homodimers, FLAG-tagged homodimers, and doubly tagged heterodimers. The doubly tagged heterodimers could be purified to homogeneity by chromatography on an anti-FLAG immunoaffinity column followed by a metal ion chelating column. This procedure for isolation of FAS heterodimers was utilized to determine whether the two centers for fatty acid synthesis in the FAS dimer can function independently of each other. Doubly tagged heterodimers, consisting of one wild-type subunit and one subunit in which the thioesterase activity had been eliminated, either by mutation or by treatment with phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, have 50% of the wild-type thioesterase activity and, in the presence of substrates, accumulate a long chain fatty acyl moiety on the modified subunit, thus blocking further substrate turnover at this center. Nevertheless, the ability of the heterodimer to synthesize fatty acids is also 50% of the wild-type FAS, demonstrating that an individual center for fatty acid synthesis has the same activity when paired with either a functional or nonfunctional catalytic center.

The de novo synthesis of long chain fatty acids from malonyl-CoA requires several enzyme activities that in most bacteria and plants are associated with discrete monofunctional polypeptides (1Magnuson K. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 522-542Google Scholar,2Ohlrogge J. Browse J. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 957-970Google Scholar). In animals, however, six enzymes and an acyl carrier protein, which collectively are responsible for catalyzing the entire series of reactions, are integrated into a single multifunctional polypeptide chain, the FAS 1The abbreviations used are: FAS, fatty acid synthase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; PMSF, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22508-22513Google Scholar) have established that each polypeptide contains three amino-terminal catalytic domains, β-ketoacyl synthase, malonyl/acetyltransferase, and dehydrase, separated by a stretch of approximately 600 residues from four carboxyl-terminal domains, enoyl reductase, β-ketoacyl reductase, acyl carrier protein, and thioesterase (16Smith S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1248-1259Google Scholar). The monomeric form of the FAS is unable to couple the individual reactions to form a long chain fatty acid, whereas in the dimer the two subunits are juxtaposed such that two centers for palmitate synthesis are created (17Singh N. Wakil S.J. Stoops J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3605-3611Google Scholar, 18Smith S. Stern A. Randhawa Z.I. Knudsen J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 152: 547-555Google Scholar). The discovery that the two subunits could be cross-linked, via the 4′-phosphopantetheine associated with the ACP domain of one subunit and the β-ketoacyl synthase active site cysteine of the opposite subunit, provided the first indication that some of the individual reactions probably were catalyzed across the subunit interface (19Stoops J.K. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3230-3235Google Scholar). More recently, we have used a mutant complementation strategy to explore in detail the functional interactions taking place between domains located on the same and on opposite subunits (20Witkowski A. Joshi A.K. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10569-10575Google Scholar, 21Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2316-2322Google Scholar). Utilization of this approach has facilitated confirmation of several features of the current model for the FAS, namely that the condensation reaction can be catalyzed by cooperation of the β-ketoacyl synthase and ACP domains from opposing subunits, whereas the release of the fatty acid product involves cooperation of the ACP and thioesterase domains of the same subunit (20Witkowski A. Joshi A.K. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10569-10575Google Scholar, 21Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2316-2322Google Scholar). On the other hand, the mutant complementation strategy has also revealed some unanticipated topological features of the FAS. For example, the dehydrase domain, which is located in the amino-terminal half of the polypeptide, cooperates with the ACP domain of the same subunit, although these domains are separated by more than 1100 residues (21Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2316-2322Google Scholar). This finding provided the first experimental evidence indicating that the two constituent polypeptides are not simply positioned side-by-side in a fully extended conformation but are coiled such that contact is possible between functional domains distantly located on the same polypeptide. The question as to whether the two centers for palmitate synthesis function entirely independently or whether they are interactive has not been rigorously addressed. Two studies in the mid-1980s reported that 50% inhibition of acyl chain assembly by the FAS dimer was achieved when approximately 50% of the dimers were cross-linked by dibromopropanone, suggesting that the two centers for fatty acid synthesis function independently (17Singh N. Wakil S.J. Stoops J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3605-3611Google Scholar, 18Smith S. Stern A. Randhawa Z.I. Knudsen J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 152: 547-555Google Scholar). Using a different approach, Wang et al. (22Wang Y.-S. Tian W.-X. Hsu R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13644-13647Google Scholar) formed hybrid dimers from normal FAS and FASs modified with either iodoacetamide or chloroacetyl-CoA, reagents believed to react specifically with the ketoacyl synthase active-site cysteine (23Stoops J.K. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5128-5133Google Scholar) and the phosphopantetheine thiols (24McCarthy A.D. Hardie D.G. FEBS Lett. 1982; 147: 256-260Google Scholar), respectively. Wang et al. (22Wang Y.-S. Tian W.-X. Hsu R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13644-13647Google Scholar) found that a mixture of normal and chemically modified FASs, after subunit randomization, had ∼ 50% of the normal FAS activity, whereas a mixture of iodoacetamide-treated and chloroacetyl-CoA-treated FASs, after randomization, had ∼10% of normal activity. Were the two sites to be functioning entirely independently, one would have predicted values of 50 and 25% activity in these two experiments, so that the authors concluded that the two sites do indeed function independently. Subsequently, however, it was discovered that, under the conditions used in these experiments, labeling of the FAS by chloroacetyl-CoA is not specific for the phosphopantetheine (25Yuan Z.Y. Hammes G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13532-13538Google Scholar), and in 1989 Kyushiki and Ikai (26Kyushiki H. Ikai A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 434-438Google Scholar) challenged the conclusion that the two centers for palmitate synthesis functioned independently, based on two experimental observations: first, the fatty acid synthesizing activity of the FAS was reduced only by 25% when the thioesterase activity was reduced 50% by treatment with phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride; second, the activity of heterodimers formed between native and thioesterase-compromised subunits was higher, per center, than that of the native dimer. These authors suggested that the two centers for fatty acid synthesis in the dimer exhibit a negative interference on each other. Recent studies from our own laboratory have revealed that some of the catalytic domains of the FAS can participate in the reactions occurring at either of the two centers for fatty acid synthesis, again raising the possibility that communication between the two centers can occur (27Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). We have now developed a methodology to tackle the question of independent or interactive centers for fatty acid synthesis in a precise manner that avoids many of the limitations inherent in the earlier experimental approaches. In particular, we can engineer specific mutants deficient in a particular partial activity, avoiding problems of limited specificity associated with the use of chemical modifications, and as described in this paper, we have designed a strategy that permits the isolation of dimers that are composed of nonidentical subunits, avoiding the previous problem of assaying activities of heterodimers in the presence of the parental homodimers (22Wang Y.-S. Tian W.-X. Hsu R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13644-13647Google Scholar, 26Kyushiki H. Ikai A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 434-438Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody and anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel were purchased from Eastman Kodak Co. Anti-His6 monoclonal antibody was obtained fromCLONTECH Laboratories Inc. (Palo Alto, CA), and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated, goat anti-mouse IgG was purchased from Bio-Rad. Nickel-NTA-agarose and PMSF were obtained from Qiagen Inc. (Santa Clarita, CA) and Pierce, respectively. FLAG octapeptide (DYKDDDDK) was synthesized at the PAN Facility (Beckman Center, Stanford University Medical Center). Construction and expression of full-length wild-type rat FAS and its thioesterase mutant using the baculovirus insect cell expression system has been described in detail elsewhere (20Witkowski A. Joshi A.K. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10569-10575Google Scholar, 21Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2316-2322Google Scholar, 28Joshi A.K. Smith S. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 143-149Google Scholar). Two kinds of affinity tags now have been incorporated into these proteins: a His6 tag that permits purification by metal ion chelation chromatography and a FLAG-tag (N′-DYKDDDDK) that permits purification by immunoaffinity chromatography. The affinity tags were incorporated either at the amino or carboxyl terminus or between amino acid residues 1154 and 1157 of the FAS. To accommodate the amino-terminal tags, we used the polymerase chain reaction and the primer pair 27T5/54B1152 (see Table I) to generate a unique BssHII site immediately upstream of, and in frame with, the start codon in the partial rat cDNA construct, pFAS74.20 (5′-XbaI; base pairs 70–2544 in pUCBM20). The amplified fragment was digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and used to replace the corresponding fragment of pFAS74.20. The sequence of the amplified region was confirmed, and the DNA was digested with XbaI and BssHII to facilitate introduction of the FLAG tag linker.

Open table in a new tab To tag the carboxyl-terminal end, first a NheI restriction site was generated, in frame with the coding sequence and immediately upstream of the stop codon, by the polymerase chain reaction using a rat FAS carboxyl-terminal, partial cDNA construct, pFAS 5.20 (base pairs 6928–7615 in pUCBM20) and the primer pair 5T/5B2 (Table I). The amplified fragment was cloned into pUCBM20 to generate pFAS 5B2.20; its sequence was confirmed; and the His6 or FLAG tag linkers, with a properly located stop codon, were incorporated in frame with the coding sequence using NheI and NotI sites. The sequence of the linker region was confirmed, and an appropriate fragment from these partial constructs was used to replace the corresponding region in the full-length FAS cDNA constructs in the modified pFastBac 1 vector. Interdomain tagging was accomplished by creating two adjacentAccB7I restriction sites between the Thr-1154 and Gly-1157 codons by polymerase chain reaction. This procedure resulted in the introduction of three new residues, Gly, Tyr, and Gly, encoded at the restriction site. Thus, a Gly was added as the new residue at position 1155 followed by the affinity tag, either His6 or the FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK), and then the residues Tyr-Gly followed by the residue formerly identified as Gly-1157 and the normal FAS sequence. The partial cDNA construct pFAS 13.20 (base pairs 2539–4858 in pUCBM20) was used as template together with two pairs of primers, M878T/13B3518 and 13T3550/13B376 (Table I). The amplified fragments were used to replace the corresponding region of pFAS13.20, the sequence was confirmed, and the His6 or FLAG-tag linkers were introduced in frame with the coding sequence between the AccB7I sites. Degeneracy in the AccB7I recognition sequence allowed us to carry out directional ligation with a single enzyme digestion and minimal changes in the original sequence. The resulting partial cDNA fragments were moved into full-length FAS cDNA constructs in the modified FastBac 1 vector. Sf9 cells were infected with purified recombinant viruses and cultured for 48 h at 27 °C, and the tagged FAS proteins were purified from the cytosols as described earlier (28Joshi A.K. Smith S. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 143-149Google Scholar); glycerol (10%, v/v) was included in all buffers used for chromatography. FLAG-tagged FAS was applied to a column (4.5 × 0.5 cm) of anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel equilibrated with buffer A (250 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 0.2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol) at a flow rate of about 20 ml/h. The column was washed twice with 10 ml of buffer A, and the bound proteins were eluted with 8 ml of buffer A containing 1.5 mg/ml of FLAG octapeptide. The presence of FAS in the column eluate was conveniently monitored and quantitated by measuring the β-ketoacyl reductase activity associated with the protein. The His6-tagged FAS was applied, at a flow rate of 30 ml/h, to a column (4.5 × 0.5 cm) of nickel-NTA equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 12 ml of buffer A containing 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, to remove weakly bound proteins. More strongly bound proteins were eluted with 10 ml of buffer A containing 200 mm imidazole, pH 7.0. DTT (2 mm, final concentration) was added to the eluate immediately. The presence of FAS in the column eluate was detected by monitoring the β-ketoacyl reductase activity associated with the protein. Typically, FLAG-tagged and His6-tagged FASs (in 25–35 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mmEDTA, and ∼1% glycerol) were aged at 4 °C for 7–9 days to promote dissociation into their component subunits (29Smith S. Abraham S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6428-6435Google Scholar). Spontaneous reassociation of the subunits was induced by adjustment of the solvent to approximately 200 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 10% glycerol and incubation at 30 °C for 75 min. A randomized population of dimers consisting of FAS carrying the His6 tag on both subunits (His6-tagged homodimers), FAS carrying the FLAG tag on both subunits (FLAG-tagged homodimers), and FAS carrying the His6 tag on one subunit and the FLAG tag on the other subunit (doubly tagged heterodimers) was prepared as described above. This mixture of homo- and heterodimers was first applied to the anti-FLAG immunoaffinity column under the conditions described above. Proteins that initially bound to the column and were subsequently released with 1.5 mg/ml FLAG octapeptide in buffer A were immediately applied to the nickel-NTA-agarose column pre-equilibrated with buffer A. Weakly bound proteins were washed from the column with buffer A containing 25 mm imidazole, and more tightly bound proteins were eluted with 200 mm imidazole in buffer A. In a routine preparation of heterodimers, where the anti-FLAG column was utilized after the nickel-NTA column, the FLAG octapeptide was removed from the FAS using an DE-53 anion exchange cartridge (28Joshi A.K. Smith S. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 143-149Google Scholar). In some experiments, where the order of application to the affinity columns was reversed, the same procedure was used to remove imidazole from the FAS. In both cases, this procedure also simultaneously facilitated concentration of the protein. Prior to application of the samples to the cartridge, the ionic strength of the solvent was adjusted to the equivalent of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, by dilution with 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. Typically, FAS was eluted from the cartridge in 1 ml of 250 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol and stored at −70 °C. FAS preparations were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, using 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, and by Western analysis employing either murine anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (10 μg/ml) or murine anti-His6 monoclonal antibody (1:2000 dilution) as the primary antibody and alkaline phosphatase-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies as the secondary antibody. For Western analysis, experimental conditions suggested by the manufacturers of monoclonal antibodies were followed. Amino-terminal FLAG-tagged, wild-type FAS (2.0 mg/ml) was incubated at 30 °C with 1 mm (initial concentration) PMSF in 125 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmDTT, and 2% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol (added with the inhibitor). About 97% inhibition of FAS activity was achieved in 2 h. Excess PMSF was removed by applying the protein to a DE-53 ion exchange cartridge. The amino-terminally FLAG-tagged, PMSF-treated FAS was mixed with an equimolar amount of carboxyl-terminally His6-tagged, wild-type FAS and subjected to the cold-induced, subunit randomization procedure, as described above. Thioesterase activity was assessed by measuring the free radiolabeled palmitic acid formed from [1-14C]palmitoyl-CoA (30Smith S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 181-188Google Scholar). Overall fatty acid synthesizing activity was measured spectrophotometrically (31Smith S. Abraham S. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 35: 65-74Google Scholar); a unit of FAS activity is defined as 1 μmol of NADPH oxidized per min. Kinetic studies on the overall FAS reaction were performed under conditions described previously (28Joshi A.K. Smith S. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 143-149Google Scholar). β-Ketoacyl reductase activity was monitored using trans-1-decalone as a model substrate (20Witkowski A. Joshi A.K. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10569-10575Google Scholar, 21Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2316-2322Google Scholar). FASs were incubated with substrates, in a final volume of 0.5 ml, at 37 °C for 10 s, and then CoASH (0.1 mm, final concentration) was added, and the incubation continued for a further 5 s to promote unloading of unutilized substrates from the FAS (32Stern A. Sedgwick B. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 799-803Google Scholar). Protein was precipitated by the addition of an equal volume of 95% ethanol, with bovine serum albumin (0.2 mg/ml, final concentration) added as carrier. Radioactive fatty acyl moieties bound to the FAS were released by performic acid treatment, extracted into petroleum ether (33Libertini L.J. Smith S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 192: 47-60Google Scholar), and then derivatized with phenacyl-8 (Pierce) and analyzed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography as described earlier (34Naggert J. Narasimhan M.L. De Veaux L. Cho H. Randhawa Z.I. Cronan Jr., J.E. Green B.N. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11044-11050Google Scholar). Quantitative evaluation of the activities of engineered heterodimers previously has been hampered by uncertainty as to the exact composition of the dimer population that results from randomization of the subunits from two different homodimers. Theoretically, if the rates of dissociation and reassociation of the various mutant FASs employed are unaffected by point mutations, then the mutant subunits should reassemble randomly, yielding a population consisting of 50% heterodimers and 25% of each homodimer. Surprisingly, however, some single mutations at the active site of a particular catalytic domain have a marked effect on the rate of dissociation of the dimers, so that there is some doubt as to whether the heterodimers do in fact constitute 50% of the total dimer population (20Witkowski A. Joshi A.K. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10569-10575Google Scholar, 21Joshi A.K. Witkowski A. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2316-2322Google Scholar). To solve this problem, we explored the possibility of introducing affinity tags into the recombinant FAS that might facilitate isolation of a homogeneous population of heterodimers. Because of initial uncertainty as to whether the introduction of peptide tags at certain locations might affect the activity of the FAS, we engineered tags at three different sites, the amino terminus, the carboxyl terminus, and at an internal location. Several factors were taken into consideration in choosing a site for insertion of an affinity tag in the interior of the FAS. First, the chosen site, between residues 1154 and 1157, falls within a region of the polypeptide that has no known catalytic function (16Smith S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1248-1259Google Scholar). Second, this region is relatively poorly conserved between rat and chicken FASs (7Witkowski A. Rangan V.S. Randhawa Z.I. Amy C.M. Smith S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 571-579Google Scholar), and immediately adjacent to the chosen site there is a six-residue insertion in the chicken sequence (between residues 1166 and 1167; rat numbering). Third, the site is located in a region predicted to lie on the surface of the protein, and indeed the adjacent lysine residues, Lys-1152 and Lys-1159, are sites for attack by trypsin in the native dimer (7Witkowski A. Rangan V.S. Randhawa Z.I. Amy C.M. Smith S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 571-579Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that residues inserted at this site are unlikely to be disruptive to the FAS structure and are likely to be accessible to either the metal ion or the anti-FLAG antibody. In fact, subsequent analysis of the engineered tagged FASs revealed that the presence of either peptide tag had little or no effect on overall fatty acid synthesizing activity of the wild-type FAS, regardless of location (Table II).Table IIFatty acid synthesizing activity of various tagged wild-type FASsTag, locationSpecific activitymilliunits/mgNone2050 ± 20FLAG, amino-terminal2770 ± 35FLAG, carboxy-terminal2250 ± 40FLAG, internal2230 ± 35His6, carboxy-terminal2290 ± 60His6, internal2140 ± 75 Open table in a new tab Initially, optimum conditions for affinity chromatography were established using amino-terminally FLAG-tagged and carboxyl-terminally His6-tagged wild-type FAS homodimers. The binding capacity of the anti-FLAG column was approximately 2 mg of FLAG-tagged FAS/ml of affinity matrix. A minimum concentration of 1 mg/ml of FLAG octapeptide was required to elute the bound protein from the column. Typically, more than 90% of the applied FAS activity was recovered from the column and the presence of the FLAG octapeptide, at least up to 1.5 mg/ml, had no effect on FAS activity. Under identical conditions, carboxyl-terminally His6-tagged, wild-type FAS did not bind to the affinity column, and all of the applied His6-tagged FAS protein was recovered in the initial wash. Similarly, optimum conditions were established for binding of the His6-tagged FAS to the nickel-NTA-agarose column. In the absence of imidazole in the equilibration buffer, untagged wild-type FAS, FLAG-tagged wild-type FAS, and His6-tagged FAS all bound to the column. However, inclusion of only 25 mm imidazole in the equilibration buffer eliminated the weak binding displayed by both the untagged and FLAG-tagged wild-type FASs. Subsequently, the His6-tagged FAS could be eluted from the column by inclusion of 200 mmimidazole in the elution buffer. The binding capacity of the column was approximately 4 mg of His-tagged homodimeric FAS/ml of bed volume. Typically, the yield of His6-tagged FAS in the fraction containing 200 mm imidazole was approximately 90%, as judged by the recovery of FAS activity. These preliminary experiments confirmed the specificities of the two affinity matrices and demonstrated that both matrices could be utilized to isolate FASs carrying the appropriate peptide tag without cross-contamination with FAS carrying the other tag. Doubly tagged heterodimeric FAS species were generated by randomization of the subunits derived from a mixture of carboxyl-terminally FLAG-tagged and His6-tagged homodimeric wild-type FASs. Initial attempts to facilitate the randomization process by utilizing a TSK-DEAE column, as described previously (20Witkowski A. Joshi A.K. Smith S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10569-10575Google Scholar), were hampered by the fact that the elution properties of both the FAS monomers and dimers are influenced by the presence of the tags: DYKDDDDK in the case of the FLAG tag and hexahistidine in the case of the His6 tag. Consequently, the FLAG-tagged and His6-tagged"

In contrast, 50 mm oxalate resolved a thapsigargin-sensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake rate (IC<sub>50</sub> ≃ 1 nmthapsigargin) five times that of a thapsigargin-insensitive rate. This remaining ∼20% of the total ATP-dependent accumulation was insensitive to thapsigargin (up to 10 μm), slightly less sensitive to vanadate inhibition, and unresponsive to 5 μm inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate or 10 mmcaffeine. Measuring both 12-min Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake rates, the apparent thapsigargin sensitivity increased as oxalate concentrations increased from 10 to 50 mm, corresponding to a range of luminal free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations of ∼300 down to 60 nm.

https://openalex.org/W2060444111,"Abstract The interaction of thrombin with several potent and selective α-ketoamide transition state analogs was characterized. L-370,518 (H-N-Me-d-Phe-Pro-t-4-aminocyclohexylglycylN-methylcarboxamide) a potent (K i = 90 pm) and selective (>104-foldversus trypsin) ketoamide thrombin inhibitor was shown to bind thrombin via a two-step reaction wherein the initially formed thrombin-inhibitor complex (EI1) rearranges to a more stable, final complex (EI2). A novel sequential stopped-flow analysis showed thatk −1, the rate constant for dissociation ofEI1, was comparable tok 2, the rate constant for conversion ofEI1 to EI2 (0.049 and 0.035 s−1, respectively) indicating that formation of the initial complex EI1 is partially rate controlling. Replacement of the N-terminal methylamino group in L-370,518 with a hydrogen (L-372,051) resulted in a 44-fold loss in potency (K i = 4 nm) largely due to an increase in k −1. Consequently in the reaction of L-372,051 with thrombin formation of EI1 was not rate controlling. Replacement of the P1′N-methylcarboxamide group of L-370,518 with an azetidylcarboxamido (L-372,228) produced a 58-fold increase in the value of the equilibrium constant (K −1) for dissociation of EI1. Nevertheless, L-372,228 was a 2-fold more potent thrombin inhibitor (K i = 40 pm) than L-370,518 due to its 16-fold higherk 2 and 10-fold lowerk −2 values. The desketoamide analogs of L-370,518 and L-372,051, namely L-371,912 and L-372,011, inhibited thrombin via a one-step process. The K i value for L-371,912 and the K −1 value for its α-ketoamide analog, L-370,518, were similar (5 and 14 nm, respectively). Likewise, the K i value for L-372,011 and the K −1 value for its α-ketoamide analog, L-372,051, were similar (330 and 285 nm, respectively). These observations are consistent with the view that the α-ketoamides L-370,518 and L-372,051 form initial complexes with thrombin that are similar to the complexes formed by their desketoamide analogs, and in a second step the α-ketoamides react with the active site serine residue of thrombin to form a more stable hemiketal adduct."
https://openalex.org/W1971886617,"The Flp recognition target site contains two inverted 13-base pair (bp) Flp binding sequences that surround an 8-bp core region. Flp recombinase has been shown to carry out strand ligation independently of its ability to execute strand cleavage. Using a synthetic activated DNA substrate bearing a 3′-phosphotyrosine group, we have developed an assay to measure strand exchange by Flp proteins. We have shown that wild-type Flp protein was able to catalyze strand exchange using DNA substrates containing 8-bp duplex core sequences. Mutant Flp proteins that are defective in either DNA bending or DNA cleavage were also impaired in their abilities to carry out strand exchange. The inability of these mutant proteins to execute strand exchange could be overcome by providing a DNA substrate containing a single-stranded core sequence. This single-stranded core sequence could be as small as 3 nucleotides. Full activity of mutant Flp proteins in strand exchange was observed when both partner DNAs contained an 8-nucleotide single-stranded core region. Using suicide substrates, we showed that single-stranded DNA is also important for strand exchange reactions where Flp-mediated strand cleavage is required. These results suggest that the ability of Flp to induce DNA bending and strand cleavage may be crucial for strand exchange. We propose that both DNA bending and strand cleavage may be required to separate the strands of the core region and that single-stranded DNA in the core region might be an intermediate in Flp-mediated DNA recombination."
https://openalex.org/W2058571997,"It has been shown in vitro thatSaccharomyces cerevisiae strand exchange protein 1 (Sep1) promotes the transfer of one strand of a linear duplex DNA to a homologous single-stranded DNA circle. Sep1 also has an exonuclease active on DNA and RNA.

The results in this work also demonstrate that the joint molecule between the linear duplex and single-stranded circle observed from the Sep1-promoted strand transfer reaction is just the pairing between the long single-stranded tail of the linear duplex DNA (generated by the exonuclease activity of Sep1) and the single-stranded circular DNA. When a synthetic Holliday junction was used as substrate, branch migration facilitated by Sep1 could not be detected.

The Sep1 (also known as Kem1, Xrn1, Rar5, DST2/Stpβ) protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a 175,000-kDa protein with proposed roles in nuclear fusion (1Kim J. Ljungdahl P.O. Fink G.R.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1057Google Scholar), G4 DNA pairing (7Liu Z. Gilbert W. Cell. 1994; 77: 1083-1092Google Scholar) and DNA recombination (8Tishkoff D.X. Johnson A.W. Kolodner R.D. Mol.Cell.

Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1995; 139: 495-509Google Scholar). Most of our knowledge about homologous pairing and strand exchange processes comes from the studies of Escherichia coli RecA protein. The RecA paradigm has wide generality. Analogues of RecA have been isolated recently from a number of organisms, including bacteriophage T4 UvsX (11Yu X. Egelman E. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1-4Google Scholar, 12Griffith J. Formosa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4484-4491Google Scholar), yeast Rad51 and Dmc1 (13Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Google Scholar, 14Bishop D.K. Park D. Xu L. Kleckner N. Cell. 1992; 69: 439-456Google Scholar), as well as human Rad51 (15Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Matsuda Y. Ushino N. Ikeo K. Ogawa T. Nature Genet. 1993; 4: 239-243Google Scholar). However, it has been suggested that Sep1 is a member of a different class of homologous pairing proteins, the E. coli RecT-RecE family (16Kolodner R. Hall S.D. Luisi-DeLuca C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 23-30Google Scholar). The characteristic feature of this family is that an exonuclease first exposes complementary single strands, a plectonemic joint is formed in the absence of a high-energy cofactor (ATP), and strand exchange is subsequently promoted. RecT-RecE homologs, like RecA, are widespread in nature and include the bacteriophage l, α and β proteins (17Muniyappa K. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7472-7478Google Scholar). Sep1, like RecA of E. coli, has been shown to promote the transfer of one strand of a linear duplex DNA to a homologous single-stranded DNA circle (18Dykstra C.C. Hamatake R.K. Sugino A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10968-10973Google Scholar, 19Johnson A.W. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14046-14054Google Scholar). Sep1 not only promotes this type of strand transfer, but also performs the renaturation of homologous single-stranded DNA molecules (20Heyer W.-D. Evans D.H. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15189-15195Google Scholar). Furthermore, it contains an intrinsic 5′ to 3′ exonuclease activity, which exposes a terminal single-stranded region in linear duplex DNA. It has been shown that the exonuclease activity of Sep1 is slow and nonprocessive, with a turnover number of 20 nucleotides/min and a processivity of ∼45 nucleotides on duplex DNA (21Johnson A.W. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3673-3681Google Scholar, 22Johnson A.W. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3664-3672Google Scholar). It was shown that for Sep1 to initiate strand exchange, the linear duplex must have a single-stranded tail greater than 20 nucleotides in length; this single-stranded tail can be produced by Sep1 or by an exogenous exonuclease (21Johnson A.W.

Once the small single-stranded DNA tail has been produced, Sep1 nuclease activity is dispensable for the strand displacement and branch migration phase of the strand exchange reaction (21Johnson A.W. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3673-3681Google Scholar, 22Johnson A.W. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3664-3672Google Scholar). The assumption that Sep1 is involved in DNA recombination came from genetic analysis of Sep1 mutants (9Dykstra C.C. Kitada K. Clark A.B. Hamatake R.K. Sugino A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2583-2592Google Scholar, 10Tishkoff D.X. Rockmill B. Roeder G.S. Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1995; 139: 495-509Google Scholar, 23Bashkirov V.I. Solinger J.A. Heyer W.-D. Chromosoma. 1995; 104: 215-222Google Scholar) and the in vitro strand exchange activity of the purified Sep1 protein mentioned above (18Dykstra C.C. Hamatake R.K. Sugino A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10968-10973Google Scholar, 24Kolodner R.D. Evans D.H. Morrison P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5560-5564Google Scholar, 25Heyer W-D. Johnson A.W. Reinhart U. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 13: 2728-2736Google Scholar, 26Kaslin E. Heyer W.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14094-14102Google Scholar). It was proposed that in the presence of Mg2+ or Ca2+ (when single-stranded tails are provided), Sep1 could promote a strand-exchange reaction, replace one strand in the double-stranded DNA with the homologous single-stranded circular DNA, to form a nicked double-stranded circle and a single-stranded linear molecule (21Johnson A.W. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3673-3681Google Scholar, 22Johnson A.W. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3664-3672Google Scholar). However, it is yet to be demonstrated that Sep1 has a direct role in recombination in S. cerevisiae. In fact, Sep1 has several biochemical activities in vitro that seem to have little to do with recombination (6Interthal H. Bellocq C. Baehler J. Bashkirov V.I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1057Google Scholar, 7Liu Z. Gilbert W. Cell. 1994; 77: 1083-1092Google Scholar, 27Kersey S. Kipling D. Trends Cell Biol. 1991; 1: 110-112Google Scholar). In addition, Sep1 mutants do not have a strong Rec− phenotype and the results are strikingly assay dependent (24Kolodner R.D. Evans D.H. Morrison P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5560-5564Google Scholar). Furthermore, sep1 gene has not been picked up in general screens for yeast recombination mutants (e.g. Ref. 28Firmenich A.A. Elias-Arnanz M. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1620-1631Google Scholar). In this work, the standard strand transfer assay (the transfer of single-stranded DNA from a linear duplex to circular ssDNA) was re-examined using exonuclease III-generated linear duplex molecules with various lengths of single-stranded tails, in combination with the presence of Ca2+, to inhibit the exonuclease activity of Sep1. The results show that the processivity of the exonuclease activity of Sep1 is much greater than previously reported. The data also indicate that the joint molecule apparently formed between the linear duplex and the single-stranded circle observed from the Sep-promoted strand transfer reaction is just the pairing between the long single-stranded tail of the linear duplex and the single-stranded circle. Furthermore, with a synthetic Holliday junction as substrate, we cannot detect any branch migration promoted by Sep1. In addition, electron microscopic studies failed to show the so-called α-structure, an intermediate joint molecule with a displaced ssDNA tail, a characteristic indicator that DNA strand exchange had occurred. We conclude that Sep1 cannot promote branch migration in vitro. Therefore, the main biochemical functions of Sep1 appear to be its exonuclease activity and its function as an aggregating agent. Further investigation is needed to determine the role of Sep1 in recombination. E. coli Xl1-Blue and helper phage VCSM13 were from Stratagene Cloning Systems. S. cerevisiae strain BJ5464/pRDK249 was generous gift from Dr. Richard D. Kolodner of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. All restriction endonucleases were from Promega. T4 DNA ligase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and shrimp alkaline phosphatase were from New England Biolabs. DE52 was from Whatman Inc. PBE94 and Sephacryl S-200 were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Benzamidine hydrochloride, leupeptin, pepstatin A, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and dithiothreitol were from Sigma. Phagemid pBluescript II KS+ (hereafter called KS+) was from Stratagene Cloning Systems. The double-stranded pBluescript KS+ supercoiled DNA was purified according to a standard procedure (29Sambrook J. Fritisch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and linearized by digestion with XhoI (called KS+/XhoI hereafter) or by EcoRV (called KS+/EcoRV hereafter). Single-stranded DNA was purified from Xl1-Blue/KS+ infected by the helper phage VCSM13 according the manufacture's manual. Sep1 was purified from yeast strain BJ5464/pRDK249 following a published method (19Johnson A.W. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14046-14054Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The cells were broken using a French Press at 1,500 p.s.i. followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min in a Sovall SS34 rotor. The pellet was resuspended and fractionated by Polymin P precipitation and ammonium sulfate precipitation. Redissolved proteins were purified using a DE52 column (2.5 cm2 × 100 cm), a single-stranded DNA cellulose column (1.8 cm2 × 11 cm), a PBE 94 column (0.38 cm2 × 9.8 cm), a Sephacryl S-200 column (2 cm2 × 68 cm), and a Mono S column (Pharmacia HR 5/5). The final fraction was dialyzed against storage buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mm NaCl, and 60% glycerol overnight) and stored at −80 °C. The step of concentrating Sep1 by dialysis against 20% PEG 8000 1The abbreviations used are: PEG, polyethylene glycol; kb, kilobase(s); ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA. in the published method (19Johnson A.W. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14046-14054Google Scholar) was omitted, because we found that PEG could interfere with the strand exchange assay. The Sep1 protein was >99% pure as judged by 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In a reaction volume of 30 μl, 0.05 μg of single-strand circular pBluescript KS+ DNA (5 μm) and 0.1 μg (5 μm) of linear double-stranded pBluescript KS+ DNA were incubated either with 1 μg of Sep1 (0.19 μm) in a Mg2+ buffer containing 33 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, or in Ca2+ buffer containing 33 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin at 30 °C for 30 min or as indicated. The reaction was stopped by adding 2.5 × stop solution containing 15% glycerol, 5% SDS, and 0.125% bromphenol blue. The product was analyzed by running on a 0.8% agarose gel in 0.5 × TBE buffer. The Holliday Junction structure was constructed following Panyutin and Hsieh (Ref. 30Panyutin I.G. Hsieh P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2021-2025Google Scholar; see Fig. 4 A) with the following modifications. Plasmid pBluescript KS+ was digested with NaeI and EcoRI. The 377-base pair fragment was purified from low-melting agarose gel electrophoresis and used as the homologous arms in the junction structure. The synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-ACCATGCTCGAGATTACGAGATATCGATGCATGCG-3′ and 5′-AATTCGCATGCATCGATATAATACGTGAGGCCTAGGATC-3′ were annealed and ligated to the 377-base pair arm, and formed the partial duplex substrate S1 for the Holliday junction. The synthetic oligonucleotides 5′-GATCCTAGGCCTCACGTATTATATCGATGCATGCG-3′ and 5′-AATTCGCATGCATCGATATCTCGTAATCTCGAGCATGGT-3′ were annealed and ligated to the 377-base pair to form S2. These partial duplex substrates S1 and S2 were then purified from 6% native acrylamide gel. S2 was then labeled at its 5′-end with [32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotides kinase. The 32P-labeled S2 described above was mixed with a 10-fold molar excess of S1 (unlabeled) in different reaction buffers as indicated in the text in a total volume of 10 μl. After incubation at an appropriate temperature, the reaction was stopped by 10 μl of ice-cold reaction buffer containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide and kept on ice prior to electrophoresis. The branch migration products of Holliday junctions were analyzed by electrophoresis in 4% native polyacrylamide gel in 1 × TAE buffer containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide and 10 mm MgCl2 or 5 mm CaCl2 at 5 V/cm for 10 h at 4 °C. Gels were dried, autoradiographed, and quantified using a Bio-Rad Molecular Analysis System. The DNA samples were prepared for microscopy using a method by Pe'rez-Morga and Englund (31Pe'rez-Morga D. Englund P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1327-1328Google Scholar) which is modified from Davis et al. (32Davis R.W. Simon M. Davidson N. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 21: 413-428Google Scholar). Samples on Parlodion-coated copper grids were stained with uranyl acetate, rotary shadowed with Pt/Pd, and viewed in a Zeiss CEM 902 electron microscope. Fig. 1 A shows that purified Sep1 has an intrinsic exonuclease activity in the presence of Mg2+ buffer; this exonuclease activity is strongly inhibited by Ca2+ (19Johnson A.W. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14046-14054Google Scholar). It has also been shown that Sep1 can promote joint molecule formation and subsequently strand transfer between single-stranded circular DNA and double linear DNA in the presence of Mg2+ (diagrammed on top of Fig. 1 B). However, if Ca2+ instead of Mg2+ buffer is used, then no joint molecule can be detected (19Johnson A.W. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14046-14054Google Scholar). Using a 3-kb linear duplex DNA and its homologous single-stranded circular DNA as substrates, we were able to reproduce those published results. As shown in Fig. 1 B, Sep1 promotes joint molecule formation between single-stranded circular DNA and double-stranded linear DNA in the presence of Mg2+, regardless of whether the duplex DNA has sticky ends or blunt ends, but not in Ca2+. Note that none of the joint molecules formed from the Mg2+ reactions are the complete strand transfer reaction products, nicked circular duplex DNA, despite the long reaction time. Fig. 1 C shows that if the duplex DNA was first treated with exonuclease III to produce single-stranded tails then the joint molecule could be formed in the presence of Ca2+ buffer. Again, none of the joint molecules formed from the Ca2+ reactions are the complete strand transfer reaction products (nicked duplex circle). These results confirm the earlier conclusions that a limited exonuclease digestion from the ends of the double-stranded DNA is required to initiate the strand-exchange reaction promoted by Sep1 (21Johnson A.W. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3673-3681Google Scholar, 22Johnson A.W. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3664-3672Google Scholar). Also, if the intrinsic exonuclease activity of Sep1 is inhibited, then for Sep1 to initiate strand transfer reaction, the double-stranded DNA molecules have to have single-stranded tails that are homologous to the circular single-stranded DNA (21Johnson A.W. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3673-3681Google Scholar, 22Johnson A.W. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3664-3672Google Scholar). As mentioned above, in the reactions shown in Fig. 1, the substrates used were pBluescript phagemid (3 kb) which are much smaller than generally used in this type of reaction (M13, 8 kb). Under these conditions, the Sep1-mediated strand exchange reaction does not go to completion within 90 min. However, the same reaction performed by E. coli protein RecA could be completed in less than 30 min (data not shown). To investigate whether Sep1 can drive the reaction to completion if enough time is given, we decided to repeat the Sep1-mediated strand transfer reaction with Mg2+ buffer. However, in this experiment we monitored the reaction during a period of 3[frax,1,2] h. As shown in Fig. 2, in the presence of Mg2+, we detected increasing amounts of joint molecules between 10 and 120 min of reaction time (lanes 2–10 in Fig. 2). In agarose gels, the joint molecules formed during this period of time migrate slower than the nicked duplex circle (lane 17 in Fig. 2) that one would expect to see if the strand transfer were completed. The joint molecules in this group also show increasing mobility with increasing reaction time (lanes 2–10). The samples taken after 120 min of reaction (from 135 to 210 min; lanes 11–16) indicate surprisingly that the joint molecules migrate much faster than the nicked duplex circle (lane 17). It has been shown that Sep1 can aggregate DNA, and thus promote reannealing of complementary single-stranded DNA (20Heyer W.-D. Evans D.H. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15189-15195Google Scholar). Therefore, as diagrammed on the right of Fig. 2, we suspected that the joint molecules we observed from this experiment were just the reannealing products of the single-stranded tail of the duplex DNA (generated by the intrinsic exonuclease activity of Sep1), and its complementary bases on the single-stranded circular DNA. The exonuclease activity of the Sep1 continuously digests the linear duplex DNA from 5′ → 3′ even after the initial joint molecules have been formed; thus, we observed the joint molecules migrate faster and faster (from lanes 2 to 10) until there was no linear duplex tail protruded from the circular ssDNA, resulting in a partial duplex circular DNA with a gap region, whose length extends with increasing reaction time (lanes 11–16). These results imply that the intrinsic exonuclease activity of Sep1 is processive, and Sep1 does not promote branch migration. The results shown in Fig. 2indicate that the exonuclease activity of Sep1 is processive in the presence of Mg2+ and does not promote branch migration. It has been shown that when provided with 20–40 nucleotides of the single-stranded region at the ends of the linear duplex DNA, Sep1 can promote branch migration if its exonuclease activity is inhibited by Ca2+ (21Johnson A.W. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3673-3681Google Scholar, 22Johnson A.W. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3664-3672Google Scholar). To test this directly, we first digested the double-stranded DNA substrate with exonuclease III to produce single-stranded tails (the polarity of these tails are opposite to the tails produced by Sep1). The Sep1-mediated strand transfer reaction in the presence of Ca2+ was then performed. If Sep1 could promote branch migration under these conditions, then one should expect to see the fully exchanged circular duplex DNA with a small gap which should migrate a little faster than the nicked circular DNA on the gel. On the other hand, if Sep1 could promote only the reannealing of the complementary single-stranded regions from the resected duplex DNA and the circular ssDNA, then the joint molecules formed (ς-structures) should move slower than nicked circular DNA in agarose gels. The lower mobility would result from the protruded linear duplex DNA tail in the joint molecule. However, if the linear double-stranded DNA substrate is overdigested with exonuclease III, the joint molecules formed will be a circular DNA with a large gap, which should move much faster than the nicked circular DNA. The results are shown in Fig. 3 A. The Sep1-mediated strand transfer reaction between exonuclease III-resected linear dsDNAs (pBluescript) with various lengths of single-stranded tails on the linear duplex DNAs and its homologous circular ssDNA was performed in Ca2+ buffers for 150 min. Even after such long reaction times, the products of the performed strand transfer reactions are joint molecules that either migrate slower (ς-structures, lanes 6–11) or faster (gapped circular, lane 12) than nicked circular DNA (lane 2). Fig. 3 A shows again that Sep1 does not promote branch migration, and the joint molecules observed here are formed from reannealing of the single-stranded regions of two substrate molecules. To confirm this conclusion, we decided to compare the joint molecule formed from exonuclease III-resected double-stranded DNA and single-stranded circular DNA using either Sep1 in Ca2+ buffer or spontaneous reannealing in the same buffer. The results are shown in Fig. 3 B. Lanes 4–8 show the results where the double-stranded DNA were first resected with exonuclease III for increasing periods of time, and then used as substrates. The reactions were carried out with the resected linear duplex DNA plus circular ssDNA and Sep1 for 90 min in Ca2+ buffer. Lanes 9–13 show the reactions of the same substrates as in lanes 4–8 but approximately 4-fold more concentrated without the addition of Sep1. Clearly both sets of experiments produce exactly the same products, with or without Sep1. We conclude again that Sep1 does not promote branch migration. Note that higher concentrations of the substrates have to be used for the spontaneous reannealing reactions to produce the same joint molecules as those promoted by Sep1. This is not surprising, since Sep1 aggregates DNA, thus facilitating the reannealing process (20Heyer W.-D. Evans D.H. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15189-15195Google Scholar). To test further the ability of Sep1 to promote branch migration, we used a synthetic Holliday junction (30Panyutin I.G. Hsieh P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2021-2025Google Scholar) to test directly whether Sep1 can promote branch migration on this complex. The synthetic Holliday junction as shown in Fig. 4 A, was constructed by annealing two homologous duplex DNAs each having two single-stranded tails at one end that are complementary to the corresponding single-stranded tails of the other duplex. Upon annealing of the two duplex DNAs, a four-stranded complex (Holliday junction) is formed. In this complex, branch migration can only proceed to the opposite end of the duplexes (only at this direction is there sequence homology between the two original duplexes). The ultimate product of branch migration in this system is complete strand exchange and the formation of two duplex DNA products. Using this system, the rate of branch migration can be determined by the appearance of the product duplex which migrate much faster than the four-stranded complex (Holliday junction) during gel electrophoresis. The top two panels of Fig. 4 Bshow the spontaneous branch migration of the synthetic Holliday junction in Mg2+ and Ca2+ at 50 °C. It is clear that the duplex products are evident after ∼60 min in Mg2+, and after ∼30 min in Ca2+. the smears at the tops of these two gels indicate the Holliday junctions at different stages of branch migration. The spontaneous branch migration rates measured from these two experiments agree with the published results using a similar synthetic Holliday junction (30Panyutin I.G. Hsieh P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2021-2025Google Scholar). Therefore, we are confident that we have constructed the proper synthetic Holliday junction (30Panyutin I.G. Hsieh P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2021-2025Google Scholar). The third panel of Fig. 4 B is the result of spontaneous branch migration of the synthetic Holliday junction in Ca2+ at 30 °C, which is the condition for Sep1-promoted strand transfer reaction. Without any protein, the spontaneous branch migration at this temperature in Ca2+ is so slow that no products can be detected after 5 h. If Sep1 could promote significant branch migration, some duplex products should be observed under these conditions. the bottom panel of Fig. 4 B shows no detectable duplex products in the presence Sep1. Except on the top of this gel, the bands corresponding to the synthetic Holliday junctions show a small degree of smearing, indicating that there is a little bit of branch migration, but not enough to produce the products. Note that the duplex DNAs used to construct this synthetic Holliday junction are only about 400 base pairs. Finally, we have examined the products of the Sep1-promoted strand transfer reaction directly by electron microscopy. Portions of reactions used in agarose gel analysis shown in Fig. 2 were analyzed directly by electron microscopy (as described under “Experimental Procedures”) without being deproteinized first. Branch migration should lead to joint molecules containing an α-structure, where one of the DNA strands from the duplex was displaced by the circular single-stranded DNA. On the other hand, if Sep1 cannot promote branch migration, then one should expect to see only ς-structures, where there is no displaced single-stranded tail in the joint molecule. The products of strand transfer reactions promoted by Sep1 in the presence of Mg2+ were analyzed by EM (as shown in Fig. 5). Panels A-I, are representative micrographs taken from samples of increasing reaction times as those shown, respectively, in lanes 4 (A and B, 30 min), 8 (C and D, 90 min), 10 (E and F, 120 min),12 (G, 150 min), 14 (H, 180 min), and 16 (I, 210 min) of Fig. 2. Out of ∼20 joint molecules scored from each sample, we could only detect ς-structures, no other types of joint molecules were observed. The electron micrographs also show that joint molecules of samples from longer reaction times have shorter tails than those from shorter reaction times. The EM results confirm the interpretations of the agarose gel shown in Fig. 2, indicating that the intrinsic exonuclease activity of Sep1 in Mg2+ is processive and that Sep1 cannot promote branch migration. Unlike RecA of E. coli, we have found that Sep1 does not promote complete strand transfer reactions in vitro; the assay is a model strand exchange reaction, in which a single-stranded circular DNA (pBluescript, 3 kb) and its homologous linear duplex DNA were used as substrates. The joint molecules observed appear to be just the annealing of the single-stranded tail of the duplex DNA (generated by the intrinsic exonuclease activity of Sep1), and its complementary bases on the single-stranded circular DNA. As shown in Fig. 6, we propose that Sep1 initially digests the double-stranded DNA in 5′ → 3′ direction and produces two single-stranded DNA tails. The complementary tail then anneals with the single-stranded circular DNA and produces an initial joint molecule. Sep1 continuously hydrolyses both ends of the linear duplex DNA in the joint molecule and produces longer single-stranded tails. The joint region between the single-stranded circular DNA and the complementary single-stranded tail gets longer, while the double-stranded region in the linear duplex DNA gets shorter. As a consequence, the joint molecule moves faster and faster on agarose gels but still moves slower than double-stranded nicked circular DNA. When the linear DNA is digested to half of its original length, the single-stranded tail on the joint molecule is released, yielding a gapped double-stranded circular DNA, which moves faster than the double-stranded nicked circular DNA. The gapped duplex DNA is continuously digested by Sep1 resulting in only single-stranded circular DNA in the reaction mixture. This model strand exchange reaction has been used extensively for in vitro studies on recombination of DNA molecules, especially for reactions promoted by RecA protein; the reaction with RecA is presumably preceded by a homology search and pairing process. The results shown in this work suggest that detection of joint molecules or even strand exchange in vitro promoted by a protein does not necessarily imply that this particular protein is capable of seeking homology and promoting branch migration. This is especially important for those proteins, such as Sep1, that have an intrinsic exonuclease activity. In many studies concerning the strand exchange proteins, volume-occupying agents such as PEG are added to enhance the strand exchange reaction, presumably to increase the local concentration of substrate DNA (26Kaslin E. Heyer W.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14094-14102Google Scholar, 33Lavery P.E. Kowaslczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9307-9314Google Scholar, 34Kaslin E. Heyer W.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14103-14110Google Scholar). PEG has also often been used to concentrate protein during the final stages of protein purification, including the published protocol for purification of Sep1 (19Johnson A.W. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14046-14054Google Scholar). We have found that even without any protein, PEG 8000 alone promotes strand exchange, provided the linear duplex DNA is first treated with exonuclease to produce single-stranded tails. 2Z. Zhang and J. Chen, manuscript in preparation. It has also been reported that using systems similar to those used here, DNA strand-exchange reactions can be promoted in protein-free solutions under mild conditions with PEG, high concentrations of salt, or by proteins without any known roles in genetic recombination (35Kmiec E.B. Holloman W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10163-10168Google Scholar). These results indicate that in the presence of volume-occupying agents such as PEG, or proteins that can aggregate DNA, any protein which could produce single-stranded tails on duplex DNA would appear to promote strand exchange in this type of in vitro assay system. Sep1 has an intrinsic exonuclease activity and can aggregate DNA, therefore it can promote the formation of joint molecules without branch migration. Previously we have shown that Sep1 can promote the formation of paranemic joints between two homologous DNA molecules (36Chen J. Kanaar R. Cozzarelli N.R. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1356-1366Google Scholar). In those experiments we excluded the possibility that the exonuclease activity of Sep1 exposes complementary single-stranded regions that constitute the joint. Since Sep1 can aggregate DNA molecules, it is possible that Sep1 can facilitate homology searching by increasing the local concentration of DNA molecules and providing the single-stranded tail for proteins such as Rad 51 (a RecA homolog of S. cerevisiae) to perform the actual homology search and subsequent branch migration. Hence, although the results here show that Sep1 cannot promote branch migration in vitro, we still cannot exclude the possibility that Sep1 could be indirectly involved in recombination in vivo.
